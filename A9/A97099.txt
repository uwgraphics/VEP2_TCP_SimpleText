A help to the right understanding of a Discourse concerning INDEPENDENCY, etc.
AS it is a very great benefit to the world when wise and considerate men,
suffer for maintenance of a just cause: so also it proves oftentimes very
prejudicial to a Nation, when rash inconsiderate men, wise only in their own
strong conceits, do suffer, though for a cause as just as common freedom it
self: because suffering wins reputation to the person that suffers,
whereby his sayings, opinions, and writings carry authority with them: and
though never so much blended with slightness, arrogance, impurity, violence,
error, and want of charity: yet make they deep impression in the minds of many
well meaning people, and sway them to the like, or dislike of things: not as
they are really good, or palpably evil in themselves, but according to the
gloss, or dirt, that such men through ignorance, impatience, or malice cast
upon them.

For instance whereof, I am somewhat troubled that I must allege Mr. William
Pryn, who to his great commendation in the late arbitrary times suffered for
the maintenance of the just liberties of his Country: but in a great example of
late it is too sadly proved that he that did the greatest service, may live to
do the greatest mischief: and I am fully instructed. That only perseverance
in well-doing, is praiseworthy: and therefore I conceive I may without breach
of charity, be as bold with him as with any other man whatsoever: that others
may learn by me to respect good men no longer then they continue so.

Of late he is fallen upon so unhappy a subject (The difference of judgment in
matters of Religion) and has so totally engaged himself therein, that even
men who have formerly had him in great repute for integrity, begin to doubt his
ends; supposing that he strikes in with the rising party in hope to raise
himself with them, and by them; and that he is carried away with that
infirmity unto which men of his tribe have been much subject.

Others there are that conceive he is defective only in his understanding, and
easily outwitted, and wrought to do that, which he intended not to do,
charitably hoping by his endeavors in the argument of Church government, that
he really intended the reconciling of all parties, and that he has unhappily
wrought a contrary effect, and made the division greater, through his want of
judgment, and naturally passionate weakness: inconsiderately engaging, and
(being engaged) and prosecuting with violence: and they argue it to be so, from
his publishing Romes masterpiece; and the Archbishops Diary; intending, no
doubt, to blazon the vileness of that Arch Incendiary to the world; whereas to
an advised Reader, it will be evident, that the first is framed of purpose to
lay the design of all our troubles upon the Papists; and make the Archbishop
such an enemy thereunto, as that they plotted to take away his life; as if
Satan were divided against Satan; and his Diary is so subtly contrived, as
that among those from whom he expects honor, it cannot fail to work most
powerfully thereunto, so great are his good works therein expressed, so large
are his pious intentions, so watchful over his ways, so seldom offending, so
penitent after offenses, so devout in prayer, so learned and patheticall in his
expressions; that to any that are but tainted with the least Prelaticall
superstition, he will appear a Saint, if not equal to Noah, Lot and David,
yet full parallel with the most holy Primitive Fathers; especially when they
shall consider that these his works were published by his greatest enemy, which
was the Archbishops Masterpiece indeed, being both written of purpose to be
published in their best season; and by a person that should most advantage the
deceit: if it had not been so, they had easily been fiend or concealed, past
his finding: no man can think the Bishop so impolitick, as after so long
imprisonment, not to be warned concerning his notes.

Others judge him to be much of the Archbishops spirit, his late adversary, and
fear that if he had equal power to that he once had, he would exceed him in
cruelty of persecution; and their reason is, because he is so violently busy
already, egging and inciting the Parliament, like their evil Genius, to acts
of tyranny against a people he knows innocent: how much more would he rage
against them had he that command of censure, fine, pillory, imprisonment and
banishment, which the Archbishop unjustly usurped; especially since his rage
against them has so exceeded all bounds of modesty already, as to affirm that
their writings are destructive to the very being of Parliaments, and as bad or
worse then the Popish Gunpowder-plot, and to term their honest and submisse
demeanours, Insolences, unparalleld public violations and impeachments of
the rights and privileges of Parliament, and of the tranquillity and safety of
our Church and State. I am at stand Methinks, and cannot but grieve within my
self to consider how full swollen with bitter malice, yea and the very poison
of Aspes, that breast must needs be from whence proceeds such malevolent and
scandalous speeches, yet so grossly untrue and unsuitable to the spirits of the
Independents.

Men likewise say that this must needs proceed from spleen: for if he were a
really conscientious man he would first pull the beam out of his own eye, as
he is a Lawyer, and examine his own ways in the course of his practice, or
set out something to set out the unlawfulness of tithes, as learned Mr. Seldom
has done. Mr. Pryn professes the true Christian Religion, and that most
zealously, yet continues to take fees for pleading men's causes, a thing that
the virtuous men amongst the very heathens accounted base, and would do it
gratis: and what fees takes he? no less then treble the value of what is
taken by pleaders in Popish Countries; but he takes as little as any man of
his calling, and no more but what is lawful for him to take: therein, say
they, consists the misery of the Commonwealth, with all other the extreme
abuses of our Laws, the very way of the ending of controversies, being so
totally pernicious and full of vexation: that were he truly conscientious for
the good of the whole Nation, as he pretends, he would have laid open to the
Parliament, how improper it is that our Laws should be written in an unknown
language, that a plain man cannot understand so much as a Writ without the
help of Council; how prejudicial it is that for ending a contoversie, men
must travel Term after Term from all quarters of the Land to London, tiring
their persons and spirits, wasting their estates, and beggering their families;
tending to nothing but the vexation of the people, and enriching of Lawyers;
with a little labor had he been so virtuously disposed, he could have
discovered the corrupt original thereof, and have laid open all the
absurdities therein, and showed the disagreement thereof to the rules of
Christianity: he could also have showed to the Parliament what of our Laws
themselves are unnecessary, what are prejudicial to good men, and have moved
for reducing all to an agreement with Christianity: were he (say they) truly
pious, and could deny himself, this he would have done, though he had thereby
made himself equal to men of low degree, both in estate, food, and raiment:
yea though for his livelihood he had been constrained to have labored with
his hands, etc. This indeed had been a proper work for him a Christian Lawyer
in a time of Reformation: What needed he to have meddled against the
Independent and Separation, there being so many learned Divines (as he
himself esteems them) sitting in Council so near the Parliament, which
shows him to be too officious?

And as concerning Church Government: If he had really intended the good of
the Nation, and the weal^ of all peaceable minded men, he would have had in
mind such considerations as these.

The Parliament are now upon settling the affairs of the Church, a thing of a
very nice and dainty nature, especially being undertaken in a time of a
homebred War: If it be not very advisedly and cautiously done, it may soon
divide the well-affected party within it self, then which nothing can be more
pernicious and destructive: already I have seen some that have laid down
Arms, and many withdraw their persons and estates into foreign parts, for no
other cause but for being disturbed or discouraged in exercising of their
consciences in matters of Religion: And it was but thus in the Prelaticall
time. I find by my self, that Christians cannot live, though they should
enjoy all natural freedom and content, where they are not free to worship God
in a way of Religion: And I find also by my self that Christians cannot
worship God in any way but what agrees with their understandings and
consciences; and although I may be at liberty to worship God according to that
way which the Parliament shall set up for a general rule to the whole Nation;
yet if I were not persuaded that I might lawfully submit thereunto, all the
torments in the World should not enforce me: and this I find to be the case
of many conscientious people, very well affected to the Parliament and to
common freedom: Men that have spent their estates, and hazarded their lives as
freely in defense of just Government, as any men whatsoever; and whether they
are under the names of Anabaptists, Brownists, Separation, Independents, or
Antinomies; we have had all their most affectionate help in throwing down
Episcopacy and arbitrary government: men they are that still remain in most
opposition to the Popish and malignant parties; somewhat we must do for the
ease of these our brethren, it must not be in the settlement of our Reformation
that they remain under the same restraint or molestation for their consciences
as they were in the Prelaticall time; we must do as we would be done unto: if
any sort of them were greater in number then we, and had authority to
countenance them, we should esteem it hard measure, to be restrained from
exercising our Religion according to our consciences, or to be compelled by
fines, imprisonments, or other punishments, to worship contrary to our
consciences, we must bear with one another infirmities; no condition of men
in our days have an infallibility of judgment: every one ought to be fully
persuaded in his own mind of the lawfulness of the way wherein he serves
God; if one man observe a day to the Lord, and others not; and both out of
conscience to God, both are allowed by the Apostle; and the one is not to
molest, no not to despise or condemn. Romans 14. v. 3. much less compel the
other to his judgment, because whatsoever is not of faith or full assurance of
mind is sin: had Mr. Pryn debated thus with himself, he had showed himself a
true Disciple of Christ and his Apostle: differing opinions would not then have
appeared such abominable, damnable things in his sight: The dealing of our
Savior with those most erroneous Sadduces, would have come into his mind, they
believed that there was neither Angel nor Spirit, and that there was no
resurrection: Opinions as contrary to the current of the then Interpreters, as
any in our time, and yet they professed it openly, as appears by their
attempting our Savior, and were as unreproved of him as of authority; he
resolves their question by an answer which removed that absurdity which they
thought impossible: briefly telling them, That they neither marry nor are
married, but as the Angels of God in heaven; using them gently, without threats
or reproaches.

If Mr. Pryn had thought of this Subject, with such like considerations, he
would soon have seen, That the people of a Nation in choosing of a Parliament
cannot confer more then that power which was justly in themselves: the plain
rule being this: That which a man may not voluntarily bind himself to do, or
to forbear to do, without sin: That he cannot entrust or refer unto the
ordering of any other: Whatsoever (be it Parliament, General Councels, or
National Assemblies:) But all things concerning the worship and service of
God, and of that nature; that a man cannot without wilful sin, either bind
himself to do any thing therein contrary to his understanding and conscience:
nor to forbear to do that which his understanding and conscience binds him
to perform: therefore no man can refer matters of Religion to any others
regulation. And what cannot be given, cannot be received: and then as a
particular man cannot be robbed of that which he never had; so neither can a
Parliament, or any other just Authority be violated in, or deprived of a power
which cannot be entrusted unto them.

That Emperors, and Kings, and Popes, have assumed an absolute power over
Nations in matters of Religion, need not to have been so laboriously proved;
nor that Councels and Parliaments have done the like: the matter is what they
have done of right: who knows not that all these have erred as often as they
did so: our present Parliament have greater light then any former, and propose
to themselves to abandon what ever former Parliaments have either assumed, or
done upon misinformation; and have not yet declared themselves to dissent from
the fore recited rule: and then Mr. Pryn may consider, whether he has not
extremely misspent his time, and with much uncharitableness injured that
faithful servant of God, and sincere lover of his Country, Mr. John Goodwin, a
man that to my knowledge, and to the knowledge of many, values neither life nor
livelihood, could he therewith, or with loss thereof, purchase a peaceable
liberty to his Country, or a just Parliamentary government; so far is he, or
that other worthy man Mr. Burton; or any Independent, Anabaptist, Brownist, or
any of the Separation now extant, from deserving either those slight, but
arrogant expressions of his in his said Epistle, telling the honorable
Parliament, That he knows not what evil Genius, and Pithagorian
Metempsychosis, the Antiparliamentary souls formerly dwelling in our defunct
Prelates earthly Tabernacles, are transmigrated into, and revived into a new
generation of men (started up of late amongst us) commonly known by the name
of Independents: such bumbast inckhorne terms, savouring so much of a mere
pedanticke, as ill beseems his relation to that supreme power of Parliament:
And though those Independents, for the most part are such by his own
acknowledgement, whose affections and actions have demonstrated them to be
real and cordial to the Parliament and Church of England, for which (says
he) and for their piety they are to be highly honored, yet has not he so much
charity as to show any inclination that they should be relieved in their just
desire of Christian liberty; but prosecutes all those their several
judgments, as derogatory and destructive unto Parliament and Church in their
Anarchicall and Antiparliamentary positions; for which, and for their late
gathering of Independent Churches, contrary to Parliamentary injunctions (which
were never seen) they are he says, to be justly blamed as great Disturbers of
our public peace and unity: these his great words make a great noise, I
confess: a man that did not converse amongst these people, may easily be
induced to believe them to be very dangerous. Mr. Pryn is of great credit with
many in authority, and how far he has therein done them wrong, his own
conscience will one day tell him to his cost.

If Mr. Pryn were a stranger to the Separation, and unacquainted with the
innocence of their ways and intentions, I might charitably judge him to plead
for the persecution of Gods people ignorantly, as St. Paul did: but since he
cannot but know that they are both in affection and action re all and cordial
to the Parliament, as himself confesses, and has found them for his own
particular compassionate in his sufferings, and liberally assistant to him in
his miseries: I profess, I can make no other construction of his so violent
pleading for persecution, and incensing the Parliament against a People he
knows harmless, and modest and reasonable in their desires whose utmost end
is only not to be molested in their serving of God: I can make no other
construction of it, I say, that engagement to the Divines, and some interest of
his own has begot a hardness over his heart, and clouded that noble courage,
and common spirit which did possess him. If he wanted information, I would
labor with him, but since I cannot doubt but that he has sufficient of that,
I will leave him till the truth and excellency of that freedom against which
he fights, till the sincerity and uprightness of the Separation which he
delivers up to the sword, in these words, Immedicabile vulnus ense recidendum
est, make him one day appear even to his present admirers, the man he is
indeed.

In the mean time, I turn to the people, and desire them to enquire after the
Separation, and have full knowledge of them: they will then find they are
extremely misunderstood by authority, and all others that apprehend them to be
any other then a quiet harmless people, no way dangerous or troublesome to
humane society: I have found them to be an ingenious enquiring people, and
charitable both in their censures of others, and due regard to the poor. I am
become their advocate, out of no engagement or relation to them, I profess,
more then what my knowledge of their sincerity and true affection to their
Country has begotten in me.

Mr. Goodwin, I need not speak much of, he is a man so well known, that Mr.
Pryns so rigid urging of his expressions upon him, as he has too largely and
spleenishly done in his Epistle, making so unsavory and utterly
disproportioned comparisons betwixt him, and the malignant Prelates, and
Antiparliamentary Cavaliers, that a man that knows the antipathy between them
cannot but stand amazed thereat; and necessarily conclude that something has
blinded not only the light of Mr. Pryns conscience, but of his understanding
also, and then after a most unchristian application, his sentence is in these
dismal old Antichristian and Prelaticall terms; if they will not be
reclaimed, fiat justitia, better some should suffer then all perish: but happy
it is, that the power of Parliament is not in Mr. Pryn: if it were (in the
mind he is now in) it is much to be doubted, his part would differ little from
Bonners or Gardiners in Queen Mary's days: but blessed be God, it is
otherwise; nor will that just Authority I presume be moved either with his
fierce exclamations, or incomparable flatteries to do any thing contrary to
right reason and true Christianity: nor is there indeed (the fore mentioned
rule holding) any cause why that supreme Authority should be offended: for all
sorts of Independents, whether Anabaptists or Brownists, or Antinomians, or any
other do all agree, that in all Civil and Military causes and affairs, they
have an absolute supreme power: And if they shall conceive it just and
necessary for the State to propose one way of worship for a general rule
throughout the Land, and shall ingratiate the same by an exemption from all
offense and scandal of weak consciences as far as is possible; The
Independents, etc. have nothing to oppose against their wisdoms: and if the
public way should be such as should agree with any of their judgments and
consciences, they would most readily join in fellowship therein: but if their
judgments and consciences should not be fully satisfied concerning the same,
then whatsoever is not of faith is sin; and they cannot but disjoyne: and in
such a case, all good men that know them will show themselves true Christians
indeed, in becoming humble suitors to the Parliament, that as for convenience
to the State they propose one general public way: so for the ease of tender
consciences, and for avoiding of sin either in compelling of worship contrary
to conscience, or in restraint of conscientious worship; they would be pleased
to allow unto all men (that through difference of judgment could not join
with the public congregations) the free and undisturbed exercise of their
consciences in private congregations.

And if they should be pleased so to do; it is but what is agreeable to common
equity and true Christian liberty: It has been the wisdom of all judicious
Patriots to frame such laws and government as all peaceable well minded people
might delight to live under; binding from all things palpably vicious by the
greatest punishments, and proposing of rewards and encouragements to all
public virtue: but in things wherein every man ought to be fully persuaded in
his particular mind of the lawfulness or unlawfulness thereof; there to
leave every man to the guidance of his own judgment; and where this rule is
observed, there all things flourish, for thither will resort all sorts of
ingenious free borne minds: such Commonwealths abound with all things either
necessary or delightful, and which is the chief support of all: such a
government abounds with wise men, and with the general affections of the
people: for where the government equally respects the good and peace of all
sorts of virtuous men, without respect of their different judgments in matters
of Religion: there all sorts of judgments cannot but love the government, and
esteem nothing too precious to spend in defense thereof.

Who can live where he has not the freedom of his mind, and exercise of his
conscience? look upon those Governments that deny this liberty, and observe
the envyings and repinings that are amongst them, and how can it be otherwise,
when as if a man advance in knowledge above what the State allows, he can no
longer live freely, or without disturbance exercise his conscience? what
follows then? why he takes his estate, and trade, and family, and removes where
he may freely enjoy his mind, and exercise his conscience: and as this has
been the sad condition of this Nation to its extreme loss diverse ways: so
Mr. Pryn would have it continued for ought by his writings can be discovered;
nor is he any whit troubled in spirit to see at this day of Jubilee, and of
Reformation unto all just liberty: thousands of well-affected persons at their
wits end, not knowing where to set their foot, for want of encouragement in the
cause of conscience.

I but, says Mr. Pryn, our Covenant binds us to maintain an absolute
Ecclesiastic power in the Parliament: it binds us to maintain their
undoubted rights, power, privileges: but Mr. Pryn must ever bear in mind,
that what the people cannot entrust that they cannot have; which will answer
all objections of that nature.

As for our Brethren of Scotland: there is no doubt, but they are sad observers
of all the distempers and misunderstandings that are amongst us, and would be
most glad that the wisdom of Parliament would minister a speedy remedy;
although therein they should somewhat vary from their way of Church Government;
as well knowing there can be no greater advantage given to our common Enemy,
then the continuance of these our divisions and disaffections.

And where Mr. Pryn may suppose all liberty of this kind, would tend to the
increasing of erroneous opinions, and disturbance to the State; I believe he is
mistaken; for let any man's experience witness whether freedom of discourse be
not the readiest way both to give and receive satisfaction in all things.

And as for disturbance to the State: admit any man's judgment be so
misinformed, as to believe there is no sin; if this man now upon this
government should take away another man's goods, or commit murder or adultery;
the Law is open, and he is to be punished as a malefactor, and so for all
crimes that any man's judgment may mislead him unto.

And truly you are to consider in reading his great Book (improperly entitled,
Truth triumphing over falsehood) that he acknowledges them to be but nocturnall
lucubrations, distracted subitane collections; and if you truly weigh them you
will find them very light, and little better compacted then mere dreams, or
such fumes as men use to have betwixt sleeping and waking: and when you have
viewed all those many sheets, consider them as in one, and it will resemble
Saint Peter's vision, a mixed multitude of unclean testimonies raked out of the
serpentine dens of mere tyrannous Princes, Antichristian and Machivillian
Counsels, erroneous Parliaments, and bloody persecuting Counsels and
Convocations, which he has produced, to be perswaders and controlers in these
times of pure Reformation. Certainly if a man were not in a deep Lethargy, such
a mass of so gross excrements could not pass from him without offense to his
own nostrill; if it be his case, he that scracheth him most, and handles him
most roughly, is his best friend, there being no other remedy; when he is
recovered and broad awake he will thank his Physician: in the mean time thus
much is presented to his admirers, to preserve them from that malevolent
infection, unto which his writings and reputation of former sufferings might
subject them unto; and this by one who is no more obliged to any Independent,
Anabaptist, Brownist, Separation, or Antinomian, then Mr. Pryn himself; but
has taken pains to know them somewhat better, and cannot but love them for
their sincere love to our dear Country, to the just liberties thereof, and to
our just Parliamentary Government: most heartily wishing them their just
desires, and a peaceful life amongst us: That they might be encouraged to
join heart and hand with us, in prosecution of the common Enemies, of our
common liberties, knowing no reason why I should not love and assist every
person that loves his Country unfeignedly, and endeavors to promote the good
and freedom thereof, though of different judgment with me in matters of
Religion; in which case I am not to judge or control him, nor he me: and I
heartily wish all true lovers of their Country were in this mind; and when
they are so, then the miseries of this Nation will soon be ended, and until
then, they will continue, as is too much to be feared: I could heartily wish
that what is here written, might work a good alteration in Mr. Pryn: but when
I remember the story, That a certain Lawyer came to our Savior, tempting him;
I fear it is in respect of himself, but washing of a Blackamoore: self denial,
is too hard a lesson for him; and if so, you shall have him in some bitter
reply instantly; for though he cannot out-reason men, yet if he can but
out-write his opposers, he claps his wings and crows victoria, that he has
silenced them all. Truly for writing much, I verily believe that he out-does
any man in England, which is no commodity at all to a State or the Truth, and
then considering what free liberty he has to Print whatsoever he writes,
discreet men will consider what a great advantage he has therein, and will not
deem it want of ability in his opposers, though they do not see him presently
answered to their full satisfaction; and yet I am confident his great Book
will be suddenly answered thoroughly: but if Mr. Pryn would deal upon equal
terms, and use means that the Press may be open for all Subjects, but for
six months next coming free from the bonds of Licencers; if Mr. Pryn be not
so silenced, as that all his former and late books do not under sell brown
paper; let me be henceforward esteemed as vain a boaster, as now I esteem him:
for his opposers, as in the justness of this cause they cannot regard his
spleen; so nothing would be more welcome to them then his love, and change of
mind, whereof some do not despair: however, I end with his own words, more
justly applied fiat justitia; better it is that he undergo this my plain
dealing, then that either the Readers of his books should be seduced, or so
many innocent well-affected persons be so grossly abused by him.

FINIS.
