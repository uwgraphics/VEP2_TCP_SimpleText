The true and faithful Discharge of RELATIVE DUTIES Is a very great Honor and
Ornament to the DOCTRINE of the GOSPEL; Without, which the talk of Godliness,
and Profession of Religion, is vain; and therefore all Christians should labor
to understand their Relative Duties, and be careful and conscionable in the
discharge of them.
The Duties of Wives.
1. It Is their duty to love their Husbands: this is a duty that helps to the
right performance of every duty no; duty will be well discharged without it,
it is so necessary that the Apostle would not only have Titus press it himself,
but put the aged women upon teaching the younger to love their Husbands. Tit.
24.

2. To be subject to their husbands, this is the Cardinal, virtue, the prime
virtue of a wife, therefore the Apostles do so often in plain express terms
require and press it, Ephesians. 5. 22. 23. Col. 3. 18. 1 Pet. 3. 1. it is a breach of
God's order when Wives are not subject.

3. To be faithful, etc. they must not in word or action be unfaithful to their
Husbands, this is a breach of Covenant, yea the Lords Covenant, Prove 2. 17.

4. To be careful to please, etc. 1 Cor. 7. 34. the Apostle takes it for
granted, that a good wife dos so, because she ought to do so.

5. To endeavor to win the souls of their Husbands, and that; 1. By a holy
Conversation a good carriage, 1 Pet. 3. 1. 2. By gentle persuasions, persuading
them to mind the good of their souls, 1 Cor. 7. 16.

6. To bear quietly and patiently with their Husbands. 1 Pet. 3. 4. as wives
should not provoke their Husbands, so they should not easily be provoked by
them.

7. To reverence their Husbands, the Holy Ghost takes notice of it as a
commendable thing in Sarah, she called her Husband Lord, 1 Pet. 3. 6. it is
mentioned as an usual thing done by her.

8. To be helpful to, etc. one end of the Wives Creation was to help her
Husband, Genesis 2. 18. they must be helpful to their Bodies, Estates, Souls, Pro.
31. 12.

Of Husbands.
1. TO love their Wives, it is the duty of Wives to love their Husbands,
Children their Parents, Servants their Masters, etc. but more especially the
Husband is to love the Wife, or with a more special love, this is the prime
virtue of a Husband, Col. 3. 19. Ephesians. 5. 25. Christ is the Pattern and Example,
28, and 33.

2. To dwell with their Wives, 1 Pet. 3. 7. the Husband must forsake Father and
Mother and cleave to his Wife, G. 2. 24. Where the Apostle states the question
of separating for fasting and prayer by consent, he shows must be only for a
time, and then they must come together again, 1 Cor. 7. 5. Christ condemns the
Jews putting away their Wives when they disliked them. Mat. 11.

3. To pray for their Wives, G. 25. 21. he did not curse his Wife, nor was
bitter against her because she had no children, but entreated the Lord for her.

4. To pray with his Wife. 1 Pet. 3. 9. the Apostle takes it for granted that
good Husbands and Wives pray together, that it is their manner and custom to do
so. They have mutual need of protection, direction, many blessings.

5. To be faithful to their Wives, otherwise the Lord will be a witness against
them. Mat. 2. 14.

6. Wisely to manage their authority, must not be with passion and bitterness,
but with wisdom, meekness, patience. 1 Pet. 3. 7.

7. To maintain their Wives authority; if it is weakened, they will prevail the
less in their Husbands absence. G. 16. 6.

8. To honor their Wives, 1 Pet. 3. 7. the Husband is to respect and esteem
his Wife, or otherwise he will discourage her, and occasion unquietness.

9. To cover the infirmities of their Wives, Joseph had great cause to suspect
his Wife of incontinency, a foul crime, yet he would not make her a public
example. Mat. 1. 19.

10. To advise with their Wives. God has made the Wife of her Husbands
Privy Council. G. 31. 4.

11. To comfort their Wives. Have they trouble of spirit, affliction of body,
loss of Children etc. Husbands must endeavor to comfort them in all their
troubles and afflictions, outward, inward. Ephesians. 5. 29.

Of Children.
1, TO honor their Parents; this is express in the fifth Commandment, where,
1. It Is directly mentioned, not by consequence. 2. It has a promise annexed to
it, that thy days may be long, etc. and under long life is included a
prosperous life, so far as shall be for Gods Glory and their good, which
shows the special respect God has to those that honor their Parents, and
how ready he is to bestow his Blessing on them, Ephesians. 6. 2, 3. Children must
honor their Parents, 1. in Heart; they must keep an inward reverence of them,
Lev. 19. 3. 2. In Word; give them honorable Titles, and meek and courteous
speech, G. 22. 7. Pro. 31. 28. 3. In behavior, giving them obey sance; thus we
find the Saints of old, even those eminent ones that are gone up to glory, G.
46. 12. Ex. 18. 7. 1 King. 2. 19.

2. To obey their Parents, in their commands, instructions, repoofs, Ephesians. 6. 1.
Pro. 1. 8, 9.

3. To submit to their corrections, Heb. 12, 9. the Apostle does not only
mention what they had done, but intimates what Children should do.

4. To bear with the infirmities of their Parents, cover them in love, Pro. 23.
22. old Women are many times full of infirmities, pettish, sroward, humerous,
but Children must not therefore despise them, but bear with and cover their
infirmities, G. 9. 23.

5. To requite their Parents their kindness care and cost toward them, 1 Timothy
5. 4. this Children should do, 1. By acknowledging their Parents Love and
pains. 2. By a dutiful behavior; this is the crown of Parents, a great
comfort to them. 3. By visiting of them, especially in time of sickness, and
discomfort. G. 48. 2. 3. and 37. 35. 4. By aiding and relieving them, if they
be low and in necessity, G. 45. 10. Christ shows it was wicked doctrine, to
free persons from relieving their poor necessitous parents, Mat. 7. 11, 12. 5.
By endeavoring to protect them in time of danger, 1 Samuel 22. 3. 4.

Of Parents.
1. TO pray with and for their Children. Your Children have their natural
blindness and corruption from you, and should not you pray for their good? G.
17. 18.

2. To teach them the holy Scripture, and that both by reading to them, and
bringing them up in reading; it was the special commendation of Lois and
Eunice. 2 Timothy 1. 5. 3. 15.

3. To catechize their Children, Pro. 22. 6. train up or catechize.

4. To inculcate spiritual instructions, not only to teach, but frequently,
diligently, Deuteronomy. 6, 6, 7. and 11. 9.

5. To deliver to their Children those memorable passages of providence that
have been in their days, or their fathers have told them, Josh. 4. 21, 22.
Deuteronomy. 4. 9. Psa. 78. 4.

6. To have their Children to the solemn Worship of God. Parents must not
suffer their Children to serve the Devil while they are serving the Lord. G.
35. 3.

7. To correct their Children. They must not only charge and command their
Children, G. 18. 19. but correct them if they do not observe their Commands.
Prove. 13. 24. and 22. 15. and 23. 14. Elies. indulgence cost him dear, 1 Samuel
2. 31.

8. Not to exasperate their Children; Parents shonld endeavor always to
evidence that what they do is out of love. Ephesians. 6. 4. Col. 3. 21. it is an
exhortation to Parents not to be over harsh and sharp toward their Children,
that may give them occasion rather to hate, than love them.

9. To bring them up in honest calling's Adam, that was Lord of the whole
world, and the father of all living, brought up his sons in honest Callings,
one was a shepherd, the other an Husbandman. G. 4. 2. Tit. 3. 14.

10. To guide their Children in their Matches, the glory of God; the credit of
Religion, the good of Children, and comfort of Parents themselves, are all
concerned in it; great evils have come into the world by ill Matches, G. 6. 24.
how careful Abraham was, G. 24. 3. what a strict charge, Deuteronomy 7. 3. the Father
is to dispose of his daughter, 1 Cor. 7. 38.

11. To provide for their Children, G. 30. 30. 1 Timothy 5. 8. 2 Cor. 12. 14.

12. To give them good examples; the Parents actions be copies for their
Children, very prevalent. David resolved, Psalm. 101. 2. Good counsel's vain,
without good examples.

Of Servants.
1. TO reverence their Governors of both Sexes; it is an ill beseeming thing,
yea a thing contrary to Scripture, for Servants to be saucy and checkmate, with
their Masters, 1. Tim. 6. 1. all honor. i. e. in speech and behavior. 1 Pet.
2. 18. they must inwardly reverence their Masters from the heart, and outwardly
declare it in word and carriage, yea though they be not good and gentle, but
froward. Servants are apt to despise and contemn those that are peevish and
froward, but this they must not do, they must have respect to the Ordinance of
God, implied Mat. 1. 6.

2. To obey their Masters. Religion does not teach Servants to be loose and
careless; this obedience must be, 1. Cheerful, not by compulsion, but free,
willing. 2. Sincere, aiming at the good and welfare of their Masters. 3.
Universal, in all things, i. e. all lawful things; for otherwise they must obey
God rather than men, Ephesians. 6. 5. 7. Col. 3. 22. Tit. 29.

3. To be diligent in their Masters business, the wicked and slothful Servant
are joined together, Mat. 25. 26. This diligence must not only be in the
Masters presence, but in his absence, Ephesians. 6. 6.

4. To bear patiently the checks and reproofs of their Masters, they must not
be cross and currish, not give word for word, gainsaying is a great evil in a
Servant, Tit. 2. 9.

5. To be faithful to their Masters, the other are nothing without this: Let a
Servant be skilful, painful, diligent, and of good carriage, it is nothing
without faithfulness, all other properties of a Servant stink without
faithfulness, this is the prime virtue of a servant. Christ joins good and
faithful Servant together, Mat. 25. 21, 23. a Servant can never be a good
Servant that is not a faithful Servant. Tit. 2. 10. Must show all good
fidelity. This faithfulness must extend to their Masters name, estate, bodies,
souls, relations, and must be equal and entire in all parts of faithfulness,
in all kind of business.

Of Masters.
1. TO be gentle, not harsh and rigorous, like the Taskmasters of Egypt, this
is unbecoming Chrstian Masters, the Apostle joins the good and gentle together,
1 Pet. 2. 18. must not be outrageous for every trifle, but gentle, kindly, bear
with their Servants. Masters should be as fathers to their Servants, not only
in point of superiority over their Servants, but in point of loving and tender
respect to their Servants, 2 King. 5. 13. Ephesians. 6. 9.

2. To keep up their authority; lose this, and the beauty of a family is lost,
and, it is much if sad confusion don't creep into the family; remember in whose
stead thou art, as a Master and Governor of a family thou representest God
himself, who is the Master and Governor of all, and therefore thou should
maintain the dignity of the place wherein the Lord has set thee.

3. To provide convenient, comfortable food and raiment for their Servants.
Prove. 31. 15, 21. are clothed with scarlet, or double garments, i. e. they are
well clothed against the cold, Col. 4. 1.

4. To look to their commands; both as to, 1. The matter of them; Masters must
see their Commands be lawful and good, must not impose any thing upon Servants
which the Lord has not warranted in his word, not require Servants to lie or
filch for them, or break the Sabbath. 2. The measure, Masters must not impose
more labor upon their Servants than they have strength well and comfortably to
perfom; this is oppression and cruelty, Esai. 58. 6.

5. To protect and shelter their Servants, must not suffer them to be wronged
and abused by others; as the Lord is a shield to his Servants, Psa. 84. 11.

6. To take care of their Servants in their sickness and weakness, and use
means for their recovery, Mat. 8. 6.

7. To endeavor the good of the souls of their Servants: of all duties this is
the greatest, and yet most neglected; good Joshua would not Serve God alone,
but have his household serve God with him, Jos. 24. 15. what a Religious family
Abraham had; as they were trained in civil affairs, and military postures. Genesis
14. 14. so in Religious matters too.
