SEVERAL PROPOSALS FOR THE GENERAL GOOD OF THE COMMONWEALTH. WITH The
Grounds and Reasons thereof.

Seriously propounded out of a real desire of a firm establishment of the
peace and Liberties of the Commonwealth.

LONDON: Printed for Stephen Dagnall, Bookseller at Alsbury. 1651.

Several Proposals for the general good of the Commonwealth. With the
Grounds and Reasons thereof.
1. THat, for the more orderly proceeding in all cases of Law, the Courts of
Judicature may be continued still at Westminster (or so many of them, as upon
serious examination shall be judged necessary) with such Offices thereon
depending, as shall be found apparently useful, and not burdensome to the
Commonwealth; And that the Terms may be kept at certain times of the year,
and not according to the former moveable Feasts, whereby the superstitious
observation of those Feasts may be forgotten; and the people the better attend
their seasons, and employments in the Country; And that the several Terms
may be made equal in length, whereby they may be the fitter for the dispatch
of all business relating unto each Term; For should the Courts of Judicature,
and the Terms now kept at Westminster be discontinued there, and settled in
several Counties, or Provinces, many inconveniences would inevitably follow.
As first there must be as many Offices erected in each County, or Province, as
necessarily depend upon all the Courts at Westminster, all which must either be
maintained by the State, or by particular persons, whose Suits shall be
depending there. 2ly, The several Judges of those Provincial, or County
Courts, having no society together, will cause a great alteration in the Laws,
by their various Interpretations of them; which would bring so great a
confusion with it, that no person could either safely travel, or traffic in
another Jurisdiction as being ignorant of the Laws, and Customs there in use.
3ly, The Courts in the several Provinces, or Counties being of equal power,
there could be no Appeals in case of any unjust proceedings; or admit a Court
should be set up in any place, for Appeals, the oppression would be very great,
by reason of the multitude of Appeals, and the great charge all parties would
be put unto in the prosecution, and defense of them, the whole business being
to be heard again, with all the witnesses therein. 4ly, The continual
residence of the Judges of each Province, or County, amongst their kindred, and
acquaintance, would often tempt them unto partiality. 5ly, Not only the Cities
of London, and Westminster, and parts adjacent would be impoverished for want
of trading, and commerce, but the greatest part of the Commonwealth be decayed
also; for every man that lives by trading (being enforced to utter his
commodities in several parts, many times remote from his own habitation) must
of necessity undergo both trouble, and hazard in recovering his just debts, it
being impossible a Trade should be continued without trusting; and there being
no Attorneis that will remove from one Jurisdiction to another to attend the
Causes there depending, the Creditor must be enforced, for want of an Attorney
to prosecute his Action, to repair in person to the place, where he lays his
Action, how remote soever it be from his own dwelling, and thither also bring
his witnesses at the hearing of his Cause, which, many times, through age, or
other infirmities are unable to take so long a journey; and if the Debtor after
judgment shall remove into another Jurisdiction, the prosecutor must go in
person thither also, and there proceed upon that judgment; but if the Judges
there should not allow his former judgment, as, being ignorant of the grounds
thereof, the prosecutor after his great expense, and loss of time, would still
remain without remedy. 6ly, Trading decaying, there will likewise follow a
general fall in Rents in all places, and in all other commodities, so that all
Tenants, which have taken Leases of lands, or houses for any term to come at a
full Rent will also be undone; and though the State should grant them liberty
to resign their Leases, yet, that would not keep them long from poverty,
although it might be some refreshing for the present, there being no visible
means left them, to employ the remainder of their stock for their subsistence;
And not only Tenants would be thus impoverished, but all others much weakened
in their Estates, and so unable to bear such taxes, as shall necessarily be
imposed upon them for the supportation of the burdens of the Commonwealth, or
to relieve those many Laborers, and Artificers, which would be brought to
beggary, for want of work, and employment, which might produce some sad
effects, and cause those Laborers, and Artificers to take such evil courses,
as may exceedingly disturb the peace, and quiet of the Commonwealth: 7ly,
Each several Jurisdiction would in time endeavor to become a Free State of
themselves, and deny dependence, or subordination unto others, and refuse, to
join in counsel for the general good of the Commonwealth, or give their
common assistance in time of imminent danger arising in any other parts,
unless they may make their own conditions, whereby many mischiefs and
calamities will undoubtedly follow, to the ruin of the Common wealth, the
particular members whereof being once disjoined, the whole body will soon
become a prey to the Enemy; these inconveniences are apparent, many more will
then discover themselves, when it may be too late to seek a remedy.

2. That a severe course may be taken against the buying and selling of
Offices, and that the fees, and allowance of all Officers, Lawyers, and other
Ministers depending upon any Courts of Justice may be settled, and made known,
And that no Office be imposed upon any by compulsion, but that such
encouragement may be given to the undertakers of any Office, that they may
willingly undergo the burden thereof by having an allowance given them
proportionable to the trouble, and charge incident to their respective Offices;
For there is no reason that some should be enricht by Offices of prosit
conferred upon them, whilst others waste themselves, and their estates in the
service of the Commonwealth. And to the end the number of Offices may not be
overburthensome to the Commonwealth, a strict inquiry may be made of the
usefulnes of all Offices, and such continued only as shall be found useful for
the service of the Commonwealth, with such a number of Officers as shall be
necessary for the managing thereof: that so the Commonwealth may not be
overburthened with the multitude of superfluous Offices, or Officers thereunto
belonging, or the revenue thereof thereby exhausted. And, that for prevention
of all abuses committed by Bayliffes chosen by the Shrief, the Constable in
each Parish may be joined to execute all Writs, Warrants, and other process
with liberty to break open any doors at seasonable times, for the better
execution of such Writs, and Warrants as shall be directed unto him, and that a
severe penalty may be inflicted upon all that shall resist him in the execution
of his Office, or rescue any apprehended by him, And that such men may be put
into that Office, as are known for their integrity, and may be responsable for
their actions. And that all Officers may be continued in their places, either
during life, or so long as they discharge their several truths with
faithfulness, and none to be chosen annually, as heretofore, that by their
long continuance in their Offices, they may the better know the duties of their
places. And that the fees, and duty of all Officers may be published in Print,
that their several powers and duties being made known unto all, they may be
the better questioned for their injustice, or neglect; And that all Officers,
or Ministers depending upon any Courts of Justice, taking bribes or greater
fees, or rewards then shall be allowed them by the appointment of the State,
may be severely punished, and be for ever after held incapable of any Office or
public employment in the Commonwealth.

3. That the Statute Laws, and other Laws may be well revised, and such only
left in force, as shall be useful for the Commonwealth freed from the former
niceties, and obscurities; And that the benefit of all Fines, Issues,
forfeitures of recognizances, and all penalties, upon such penal statutes as
upon the review shall be judged necessary to be continued, or hereafter to be
enacted, may either be employed, to the use of the respective parties
dampnified, or so much thereof as may make them satisfaction for their loss
sustained thereby, or to the public use of the County, where the offense shall
be committed, with allowance of such proportion thereof to the prosecutors, as
shall be judged requisite for their encouragement to discover those offenses,
whereby the abuse of Officers in estreating the said Fines, or conniving
thereat will be wholly taken away, and those misdemenours rectified, for which
the said fines, and penalties were imposed, and the public charge of the
County thereby lessned; And, to the end encouragement may be given for the
apprehending of Robbers, and other felons, some allowance may be given to the
apprehenders of them, proportionable to the quality of their offenses, out of
the goods, and estates of those Robbers and felons, forfeited upon their
attainders, and that part of the residue may be allotted to the looser of his
goods, in satisfaction of his loss, and the remainder, if any be) may be
reserved to defray the public charge of the County, where the offense shall be
committed, or the party apprehended.

4. That no persons goods, or other estate may be exempted from the payment of
their debts, and that Commissioners in each County from time to time, be
authorized to sell the estates of such debtors, as shall refuse to satisfy
their creditors within convenient time appointed by the said Commissioners,
rendering to the debtor the overplus, that shall arise upon the sale of his
estate, after satisfaction given to the several creditors, and to alott to
each creditor his just proportion where the estate is not sufficient to
satisfy them all; And that the said Commissioners may be empowered to examine
the said debtors upon Oath, what sums of money they owe, and to whom; and to
examine all others upon Oath concerning the debtors estate, and that a severe
penalty may be inflicted upon the concealors thereof, to be employed toward the
further satisfaction of the creditors.

5. That care be taken for prevention of abuses daily committed by guardians,
and such as are trusted with the managing of the estates of Infants, and that
no married woman may be guardian to any, in regard she being under the power of
another cannot improve the estate of the Infant to the best advantage, but must
submit both the managing of the estate, and marriage of the Infant to the will
of her husband, who often strives to raise his fortune by the Infants ruin And
that all guardians may give security to be accomptable for the profits of the
Infants Lands, and may be liable to account to some friends of the Infants in
the next degree, or to such as shall be thereunto appointed by Authority,
either every year, or as often as those appointed to take the said Account
shall find convenient; for it is impossible that the Infant when he comes of age
should have a clear account of all the profits of his Lands received by his
Guardian during his minority, or discover what has been disbursed for him
during all that time, but must either take his Guardians word, or else exhibute
a Bill for the discovery thereof, which often proves a fruitless remedy, And
that Guardians may be allowed during the minority of the Infant out of the
revenew of his estate, to pay these debts the Infant shall be liable to pay
when he comes to age, or his estate stand charged withal, whereby creditors
may be relieved, which otherwise must stay, to their exceeding prejudice until
the Infant comes to age, And that executors may give security to perform the
Will of the testator, and Administrators to give security for the payment of
the debts of the intestate, and for the equal distribution of the remainder of
the goods to all that have right thereto according to Law: And that
exemplifications of Wills, legally proved under the Seal of the Office, may be
allowed in evidence upon trials for Land, as well as the Original Will; And
that all provisoes, or conditions in Wills, or deeds may be adjudged void in
Law, which shall restrain any persons under any penalty, or upon the
forfeiture of any Lands or goods settled upon them, from suing for any other
Lands or goods settled upon any other persons, by the said Wills, or Deeds, or
by any other, or from endeavoring to overthrow the validity of the said Wills,
or Deeds; that so all persons may have free liberty to recover their just
rights, without hazarding any part thereof, for by means of such provisoes, and
conditions, many Heirs are dis-inherited of great estates, and dare not sue for
any part thereof for fear of loosing all, or endeavor to overthrow such Wills,
or Deeds, whereby that estate is settled upon others, who, working upon the
weakness of the owners of such estates, when they are not of perfect, and
disposing memory, do procure such provisoes, and conditions to be inserted,
which may secure their broken titles, and prevent all future claims.

6. That, for the prevention of the daily mis-imployment of lands, and money
given to Hospitals, Colleges, and Schools, and to other charitable uses,
Commissioners may be settled in each County, for the calling to an account of
all Governors of Hospitals, Colleges, and Schools, and of all other Feoffees
in trust for charitable uses, how they have employed the said Lands, or money
committed to their trust, that so there may be a clear discovery of all abuses
therein, and those abuses rectified, and the offenders punished; And that the
chargeable feasts daily made by such Governors, and Feoffees may be
discontinued, and the expenses thereof converted to a better use; And that
special care may be taken for the erecting of Schools in places convenient,
and for the admitting to Scholerships, and Fellowships, in the first place the
children of the poorer sort, whose ingenuities shall make them capable thereof;
And that the yearly allowance of the governors of Hospitalls, and Colleges may
be so moderated, that they may not exceed in wealth by the poores revenues, and
that the surplusage of their revenues, may either be employed for increasing
the number of the Poor, or Scollers in the respective Hospitalls, and
Colleges, or augmenting their allowance, where they have not sufficient
maintenance; or for the erecting of free Schools in places convenient, for the
fitting of Scholars, to supply the vacancies in the respective Colleges those
Schools shall be appropriated unto; And that a severe course may be taken
against the buying and selling of Scholerships, and Fellowships, by inflicting
penalties, upon both buyers, and sellors thereof.

7. That Tithes, which are found by sad experience to be oppressive to many
people may be taken away, and care taken for the satisfaction of such
impropriators, at a general charge, and that a strict inquiry may be made
therein, for many are usurpt by several patrons, without any color of a title
to them, and that some other unoppressive way may be appointed for the
maintenance of a faithful Ministry in some measure suitable to their deserts,
and the greatness of the charge they undertake; And that each Congregation may
be restored to the election of their Ministers, with certain rules and cautions
prescribed for the more orderly proceedings therein, and for the casting out of
such, as shall be scandalous, and unfit for the work of the Ministry.

8. That care be taken for the ballancing of Trade with foreign States, and
making the Coin here current equal in allay, and value with the Coin of other
States, that this Commonwealth may not be impoverished by foreign Merchants
gaining the Trade, and by the transportation of Coin; And that foreign
Nations may be prohibited the fishing upon the English Coast, that so the
people of this Land might reap the profit thereof unto themselves, and not be
forced to buy their own Fish of forreiners; And that customs may either be
moderated or taken away, unles it may be a policy in State to continue the
payment of customs upon all commodities brought in by foreign Merchants; for
if the yearly income accrewing to the State by customs, should be compared to
the vast sums, the people pay by the exchantment of the price of all
commodities passing through many hands before they come to be made use of, the
disproportion would seem almost incredible, for every Trader looks to gain,
as well, by the sum he paies for Custom, as by the sum he first disbursed for
the commodity, which carries with it an increase of gain through every hand it
passes, so that the people who are necessitated to make use of those
commodities, pay much more then comes in clearly to the State, besides the sums
expended, in collecting of it in Fees to the several Officers employed
therein; for remedying of which inconvenience, and lessning of the peoples
burdens such a course may be taken that all moneys to be raised for the
public use, may be leavied by an equal rate proportionally to men's real and
personal estate, without exemption of any Land from the payment of its due
proportion, if the people would consider the benefit they should reap thereby,
and therewith rest contented, until the great affairs of the Commonwealth
would permit a relaxation of those taxes, which are the easier to be born in
regard they are brought, in at a certain, and cheap rate, and the collectors
thereof more subject to a strict account.

9. That care be taken for the encouragement and increase of Trade throughout
the Commonwealth, by prohibiting the transportation of such commodities, which
may any ways prejudice the manufactures of this Land; that so there may be
employment in profitable Trades for all those that being willing to work, are
now ready to perish for want of work and employment, And for the avoiding the
many misdemenours committed daily by persons of dissolute life and
conversation, care to be taken for the compelling such to work, and punishing
those that shall refuse, and spend their time, and estates in Innes, and
Alhouses, for prevention of which inconveniences, the licensing and suppressing
of Taverns, Innes, and Alehouses may be referred to the discretion of the
Justices of peace in the^ several Limits, whereby, the number of such houses
being lessned, those that continue, may the better maintain themselves without
disorder; And that some stricter course may be taken, for the freeing this Land
from that cursed crew of Rogues, and Vagabonds, which spend as much, or more
then would maintain the poor, and renders this Land the scorn and derision of
other Nations, who might more profitably be set on work at home, or being
incorrigeable, transported into other plantations abroad; And, that the number
of laborers may not increase beyond the portion of work that may conveniently
be provided for them, care be taken for the prohibiting the building new
cottages in Buroughs, and Market Towns without laying some considerable
portion of Land thereunto; and that no new Cottage may be erected out of Market
Towns without laying thereunto a double portion of Land required by the
statute, and the like portion of Land to be laid to all Cottages already built,
where the owner of such Cottage has sufficient Land in the same Parish to make
up that proportion; for where Cottages depend wholly upon their labor, and
have neither Corn, not Cattle to supply wants through sickness, or other
casualties, they soon are brought to poverty; And whereas the owners of
Cottages, by the excessive rents reserved upon them, do often cause their
Tenants to be chargeable to the respective Parishes where they live, such care
may be taken therein that the Landlords may be compelled to allow such a
proportion of their Rents to their decayed, and impoverisht Tenants as may free
the Parish from the burden of maintaining them.

10. That confederation may be taken of the sufferings of Copy holders by the
excessive fines, and Heriots taken at every change according to the will of the
several Lords, which coppyholders are often also enforced by the exactions of
their Lords, to renew their estates for years instead of lives, which Leases
once expired, their coppyhold estate is quite extinct, and so those Lands
become wholly at the Lords dispose; The condition also of the several Tenants
to corporations, and companies in Cities, and Buroughs is grown of late as
miserable as the other, whose Tenants having estates for lives, or years have
expended large sums of money in building, and other improvements of the Land
they held, in hope of having their estates renewed at the usual rates upon the
expiration of their several terms, but of late such excessive Fines have bin
imposed upon them, that they have been incapable of renewing their estates, and
so have been compelled to leave those Lands which they and their predecessors
have enjoyed for many years to be possessed by some of the alliance, or
dependants of their Landlords, without any satisfaction had for their
disbursements and improvements, the Fines so taken seldom being employed to
any other use but the feasting of themselves, and others, the yearly rents, and
profits of those Lands being sufficient to discharge the several uses those
Lands were first appointed for, without the taking such excessive Fines, And
further that such a course may be taken, that all other Tenants also (who by
their own particular charge, and industry shall much improve the Lands they
hold, may have reasonable satisfaction made them by their Landlords, in case
they shall not reap the benefit of their improvement before the expiration of
their Leases; that so they may the better be encouraged to improve the Lands
they hold to the best advantage of the Commonwealth, without receiving any
prejudice by such improvements.

11. That consideration may be taken of the large, and vast circuits of ground
lying waste, and in great measure unprofitable, and some course taken for the
improvement thereof for the benefit of those that are interested therein,
according to their several interests, and proportions. And that, where the
commoners, or owners of such grounds refuse to make an improvement thereof
themselves, liberty may be given to any others to improve those wastes, allowing
such reasonable satisfaction to the proprietors, as shall be thought fit, by
such Commissioners as shall be appointed for that purpose, and for the deciding
of all other differences that shall arise amongst the improvers; and that
liberty may be given to the owners of all other Lands to improve the same,
where the advantage to the Commonwealth by such improvement may out balance
particular interests, and advantages, and no depopulation thereupon ensue; and
to the end the poorer sort of people may enjoy the benefit of such commons as
shall be thought fit to be continued, as well as others who have greater stocks,
all right of commoning without number may be taken away, and every commoner
allowed his due proportion, according to the proportion of his Lands; And that
for the avoiding many suits in Law, each Parish may enjoy the commons therein
unto themselves, and no others not having any Lands therein, to be
entercommoners with them, either by prescription, or by any other title; And
that encouragement may be given for the more diligent searching after mines of
all sorts by permitting the owners of the ground, where any mine of any metal
shall be found, to reap the sole benefit thereof without any seizure by the
State, as heretofore.

12. That a strict inquiry may be made by Commissioners in every County of all
general nusances, erecting of Mills, planting of Warrens, turning of water
courses, or Highwaies, or the like, or of any thing else that may be more
prejudicial to the borderers, then either advantageous to the party or the
Commonwealth, and such of them rectified or taken away that shall be so found;
And to the end all Highwaies leading to Market Towns may be made more passable,
all persons may be compellable under a certain penalty to repair those ways
as far as his own Land lies, with the like liberty for the gathering of
stones, or digging stones, or gravel in any man's Land within the same Parish
as formerly was given to the Parish by the statute, and where the highway lies
between two persons ground both of them to join in the charge of the repairing
of it, as far as their Land lies, in that manner, for commonly such ways are
made defective by the means of those that border thereupon, and therefore the
more fit to be repaired by them, rather then by such poor people, who are not
able to support themselves, and Families during the time required by the
statutes now in force, for their assistance, and that those Highwaies as lie
through wastes, and commons, may be repaired by the Commoners, and Lord of the
Soil, where his profit out of the said wastes, and Commons is considerable, by
such proportions as shall be reasonable, and where the owner of Land adjoining
to the way, is not able through poverty to repair his part, that defect
either so be supplied by the Parish, or by such therein, as have no Land
adjoining to those Highwaies; that so the burden may be born with most
equality.

13. That all Faires may be kept upon certain days of the month, and not
according to the former moveable Feasts; for those days will never be
forgotten by the people, so long as they continue to be a guide for any
business, and that after a general settlement of all Faires, a catalogue
thereof may be set forth in Print, that all may have sufficient notice of the
alterations; And that for the better prevention of the frequent stealing of
Horses, a strict course may be taken, that no Horse may be sold in Fair, or
Market without being entered into the Toll Book, with the names of the buyer,
seller, and voucher, and of the place of their several residencies, and that
the keeper of the toll Book enter no Horse therein, unless the seller, or
voucher be known unto him, upon pain of making satisfaction for the Horse to
the owner that has lost him; and that the voucher not knowing the seller and
his place of residence may undergo the like penalty; and that an Office may be
erected in London, into which all keepers of toll Books shall certify all
horses entered into their several Toll Books, with their particular marks, and
prizes, with the names of the buyer, seller, and voucher, and of the places of
their several residencies, within one month afrer the entrance of them, that
being recorded in the said Office all loosers of Horses may repair thither,
and be informed where their Horses were sold, and the stealer thereby
discovered; And that some fitting allowance may be given to the keeper of the
said Office; and some additionall allowance given to the keeper of the toll
Book by the buyer and seller of the Horse, if it shall be thought requisite in
respect of his trouble in certifying the sale thereof into the said Office.

14. That none by virtue of any tenure, grant, charter, Office, degree, or
place of residence, may be exempted from the ordinary course of Law, but that
the same justice may be equally administered unto al; And that all privileges
heretofore granted to any persons, or to any corporations, or companies in
Cities, or Buroughs may be seriously considered, and such of them made void,
as shall be found unresonable, or oppressive to the people, And that all
persons resident in Corporations, and Borough Towns, may have liberty to
appeal to the Judges of Assize, or Justices at the general Quarter Sessions,
upon any unjust proceedings against them by the Justices of the said
corporations, or Burrough-towns otherwise Justices in corporations being either
ignorant of the Laws, or led by private interests, may do injustice without
control, who are Justicss only by their Charter, and not by Commission.

15. That some titles of Honor may be conferred upon the eminent maintainers
of the Liberties of the Commonwealth, answerable to the greatness of their
services they have performed; for there is no reason, that such as have been
enemies to the Commonwealth and Liberties thereof should enjoy their titles of
Honor, whilst those that have subdued them, and so often hazarded their lives
for the service of the Commonwealth should still remain as private men,
without any notice taken of their deserts; And further it may be considered,
whether it may not be more advantageous to the Commonwealth, and add more to
the reputation of all those that shall be honored with such titles, That all
titles of Honor may continue but for life, and not be made hereditary unles
the successor inheriting the virtues of his predecessor shall be thought worthy
by the State, to have the same honors conferred upon him, which course may
cause such persons to endeavor to exceed their Predecessors in their virtues,
and engagements to the State, and be a means that honors may be looked upon as
badges of desert, and not be stained by the dissolute, and unworthy carriage of
any, as has been too often seen; And further it may be considered, whether it
may not be convenient, and for the service of the Commonwealth, rather to cast
an eye of favor upon such persons, who having formerly opposed the State,
shall now show an evident demonstration of their true conversion, by the
acknowledgment of their former errors, and cordial submission to the present
Government, then still to let such persons, eminent for their parts and
ingenuities, to live like drones in a Commonwealth, incapable of employment,
whose future services might countervaile their former errors, and heal the
breaches made amongst us, by a former union.

16. That for the better holding correspondency with foreign States, and
managing the weighty business of the Commonwealth with greater safety, the
Members of the Council of State may be continued, so long as they discharge
their trust with faithfulness, and not be subject to a yearly change; for a
succession of persons often changed cannot manage the weighty affairs
committed to their trust, with that advantage and security to the Commonwealth
or so easily discover the secret stratagems contrived by Foreign States, or so
well frustrate their devices, often long in hatching as those, that by their
long experience in affairs of State, and by their holding of intelligence in
Foreign Princes Courts, do observe the growth of such designs, whereby they
may prevent the evils that would follow, and carry on the grand concernments
of the State with greater safety; for no man's born a Statesman, And if a
yearly change of Counselors, as some desire should be admitted by the State,
what encouragement would any have to waste their time, and treasure to fit them
selves for that employment, which would last but so short a time? and what
mischiefs would attend the State, which would be swaied by raw, and ignorant
Statesmen? for in King James his time, it was observed, that when the ancient
stock of grave, and prudent Councillors was decayed, and others placed in
their rooms, not having that experience in the affairs of State, the honor of
this Nation was exceedingly impaired, and some foreign States gained those
advantages so prejudicial to this Nation, that to this day could never be
regained.

17. That to prevent the many inconveniences that may arise by the often change
of persons in authority, secure provision may be made, from the dissolution of
this present Parliament, for the equal distribution of elections in all
Counties, with certain rules and cautions prescribed for the more orderly
proceeding at elections; and for making disaffected persons incapable of being
elected, or electors or being present at elections; and that none under a
severe penalty shall give any reward, or other recompense to any person for his
vote at any election, or before, or after; And that none but freeholders of
such a yearly value, as shall be judged fit, may have a vote at any election,
and all tenants, and Coppyholders to continue still disabled, to elect, or to
be present at elections; for should all Tenants any coppyholders (who depend
upon the will of their Landlords and other Lords of mannours) be allowed to
give their votes at such elections, many disaffected persons (which should be
thought fit to be disabled themselves to vote at such elections) instead of
their own single votes, would procure many to vote according to their own
defires; whereby many disaffected persons would become members of the supreme
Council of the Commonwealth, and so the Commonwealth betrayed; And, that the
continuance of each Parliament may be left to the wisdom of the particular
members thereof, that so they may have time for the dispatch of the great
affairs committed to their care, and for the remedying of the grievances of the
Commonwealth; for it is impossible to predict what weighty business may befall
each Parliament, and what obstructions they may meet withal in the dispatch
thereof; what rules can then exactly be prescribed unto them for the time of
their continuance or had this present Parliament been either limited a certain
period, or tied to the exact performance of such rules, as should have been
prescribed unto them by any former Parliaments; instead of that happy peace,
and liberty is enjoyed, this Commonwealth had been involved in perpetual
slavery.

FINIS.
