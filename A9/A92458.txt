THE LETTER FROM THE COMMISSIONERS Of the Parliament of SCOTLAND TO THE
Commissioners of both Houses, concerning His Majesty's coming to the Scottish
Army.
Dated at Southwel the fifth of May. 1646. Right Honorable,
THe discharging of our Selves of the duty we owe to the Kingdom of England, to
You as Commissioners from the same, moves Us to acquaint You with the Kings
coming into Our Army this Morning; which having overtaken Us unexpectedly, has
filled Us with amazement, and made Us like Men that dream. We cannot think
that He could have been so unadvised in His Resolutions, to have cast Himself
upon Us, without a real Intention to give full satisfaction to both Kingdoms in
all their just and reasonable Demands in all those things that concern Religion
and Righteousness; whatsoever be His Disposition or Resolution, You may be
assured, That We shall never entertain any thought, nor correspond with any
purpose, nor countenance any Endeavors that may in any Circumstance incroach
upon Our League and Covenant, or weaken the Union or Confidence between the
Nations: That Union, unto Our Kingdom was the matter of many Prayers; and as
nothing was more joyful to Us, then to have it set on foot, so hitherto have
We thought nothing too dear to maintain it; and We trust to walk with such
faithfulness and truth in this particular, That as We have the testimony of a
good Conscience within Our Selves, so You and all the World shall see, that
We mind Your Interest with as much Integrity and Care as Our Own, being
confident you will entertain no other Thoughts of Us.

Southwel, May 5. 1646. For the Right Honorable, the Commissioners of the
Parliament of England. Signed by the Warrant and Command of the CommisLothian.
