A Grain of Incense: OR, SVPPLICATION For the Peace of Jerusalem, the CHURCH
and STATE.
O Eternal God, and most gracious Father, abundant in mercy and truth, slow to
anger, and of great patience toward miserable sinners, whose death thou
desire not, but their conversion; We humbly acknowledge, That not only this
heavy rod of Iron (wherewith thou do now chastise us, in a dreadful and
devouring Civil War) is due untous, by reason of our great and grievous sins,
but also all those plagues which thou have sealed up in the Book of thy Laws,
against obstinate and impenitent sinners: For we have broken all thy holy
Commandments, in the thoughts of our corrupted hearts, words of impure tongues,
and works of our sinful hands; and that not in ignorance of thy holy will,
that we might expect but few stripes, but even in the cleerest light of thy
Gospel long bestowed upon us; nor out of infirmity only, that we might thence
pretend to some excuse, but out of wilful presumption we have cast thy Laws
behind us, contemned thy Messengers, and stopped our ears to those gracious
Conditions of mercy and peace which thou have with infinite mercy and long
patience, sent to us by their Ministry, warning us of these very Judgments
which now are come upon us. O Lord, our sins have, like a filthy Leprosy,
overspread every part and faculty of our bodies and souls, so that we are
become loathsome in thy sight, a sinful Nation, a People laden with iniquity:
there is nothing sound nor sincere in us, which sin, superstition, or
profanation of thy holy Ordinances has not polluted: the vices and
uncleanness of other Nations have flowed in upon us: As thou have multiplied
thy favors of peace and plenty upon us, so have we our rebellions against
thee, and our impiety toward men: so that even the righteous become a prey,
justice is turned into wormwood, truth vanished, oppression and rapine every
where exercised, and blood touches blood: So that the cries of the injured,
and deep sighing of the oppressed, daily ascends into thy holy presence, to
provoke thy justice, and to solicit for revenge: And if we should be charged
by none other witnesses, our own consciences convince us; if we might be our
own judges, our hearts condemn us: So that we cannot but expect that thou, who
art the great Judge of all the world, should now be avenged on this sinful
Nation. But yet the Sanctuary door is not shut up; yet thou, who still warnest
us by thy Messengers to return every man from his wicked ways, therein
proferest mercy and free pardon to all those who shall so do: Therefore, though
our sins testify against us, deal with us according to thy mercy: Thou have
not in vain invited the heavy laden to come unto thee, to call upon thee in the
day of trouble, that thou may deliver them, and they glorify thee. O Lord
God of Truth, who never failest in any of thy promises, now ease us, grouing
under the heavy burden of our calamities; now hear, and have mercy upon us, who
call upon thee out of the deepest sense of our troublesse and helpless
perplexities: and Lord make no long tarrying, lest we be consumed by this
fierre wrath which is come out of thy presence against us: Wherefore should our
adversaries rejoice at our ruin, seeing thy holy Name is called upon among us?
Wherefore should our insulting enemies say in our destruction, Where is now
their God, their Religion, who thus spoil and destroy each other, seeing thou
have given us a glorious light of thy Gospel, that we might know thee? O Lord,
when thou broughtest our Fathers from the kingdom of darkness, into thy
mavelous light, leaving many millions to this day in their sins, and the
region and shadow of death; it was not because they (or we, to whom thou
continuest those favors) were better then others, but for thy own Names sake,
and because thou had a favor to them and us. O Lord let it not seem little
unto thee, That the paths of Sion mourn, That our fields are waste, That thy
servants blood is openly shed, That so many weeping Rachells in the loss of
their dear children, your out their afflicted souls before thee, That so many
helpless widows, in bitterness of spirit, bewail their murdered husbands,
That death is come up into our windows, and palenesse has possessed every
face, because fear, horror, and terrible dread of utter ruin and desolation
appears on every side. Lord we have sinned; what shall we say unto thee, O
thou preserver of man, save only pardon our sins? We are guilty, and have
nothing to plead before thee, but only thine own mercy; nothing to answer, but
that thy Christ has answered for us. O thou God of Truth, who have promised to
hear and grant whatsoever we ask in his Name: now, for his sake forgive us, now
for thy wonted mercy sake, look upon our afflictions; cause the destroyers to
sheath the sword again, that it may not be extreme bitterness in the end:
Correct us not in thine anger, chasten us not in thy heavy displeasure, lest we
be consumed.

Thy mercy is not changed, which wont to pardon and deliver thy sinning Israel,
when they cried unto thee in their distresses, and to be entreated of them,
when they sought thee and thy saving health, though thou correctedst them with
the rods of men; thine ear is not heavy, nor thine arm shortened: Lord,
therefore in this Judgment also, remember mercy; Lord hear the cries of thy
faithful servants calling on thee day and night, and giving thee no rest,
until thou repair; let them through the merit and mediation of thy son Christ
Jesus, prevail against all the crying sins of this Nation. Lord let thine arm
help us, vain is the help of man; neither the counsels of the prudent, nor any
arm of flesh can save us; thou only can, thou only art our refuge; we have
none other in heaven or earth to fly unto for deliverance; Lord reject us not
who trust in thee: remove from us all those known and secret sins, which
separate between us and thy mercies, which have caused thee to take away thy
Peace from us, and feed us with the bitter fruits of our own inventions, who
loved not the blessings of peace, and they are now far from us: Give us true
and unfaigned Repentance, Humiliation, and amendment, from the first to the
last, that thy indignation may cease from us: Heal our rebellions and
backslidings; bind up the wounds which our unnatural and unhappy divisions
have made in this Church and State; cure our distempers, reconcile us one to
another, and all to thee in Christ Jesus: give us grace to keep the unity of
the Spirit, in the bond of Peace: Restore us the life of Religion, beauty of
holiness, mark of thy son Christ's disciples, badge of true Christians,
ornament of the Gospel, and the happy condition of the primitive Saints, Love
and Charity; restrain all those desperate spirits of Division, which for our
unthankfulness and surfeiting on thy blessings of peace, thou have justly
permitted to come out of the bottomiesse pit amongst us: give us in these days
of our visitation, a prudent knowledge of those things which concern our Peace:
Take away those fears and jealousies which now unhappily have armed every man
against his neighbor: Remove all those Schisms and Factions which any way
obscure the Lamps of thy Tabernacle, and the light of Truth: Suppress all the
secret and professed Incendiaries, who kindle sedition, and endeavor to lay
waste Cities and Villages, and to even the Palace and Cottage in one common
ruin.

Lord bless thine Anointed Servant, our Sovereign Lord the King, in the safety
of His Royal Person, Crown and Dignity; in His gracious Consort, and those
hopeful Plants which thou have set about his Table, The Royal Issue:
Establish His Throne with Righteousness; Give an happy Understanding and
Accord between Him and His great Counsel the Parliament: Counsel them with
thy Wisdom, let thy fear rest on them, so that all their Consulations may be
blessed, that Truth, Justice, and Peace may be restored, and abundantly
flourish amongst us again, that we may make a right use of thy fatherly
corrections, by fearing thy holy Name, detesting and forsaking our sins,
learning hereafter better to value the sweet and comfortable fruits of long
Peace, by a short want thereof, and praising thee for thy clemency and tender
mercy, in the Congregation of thy Saints.

And now, O Lord, as thou have commanded us, we humbly entreat thee, as for our
selves, so for thy distressed servants in Ireland; Lord cover their heads in
the days of Battle, teach their hands to war, and their fingers to fight;
lead their Leaders, and counsel their Counselors, thou who can make one to
chase a thousand, and as easily deliver by few as by many (because thou only
art the Lord of Hosts, the Battle is thine, and thou only give Victory unto
kings) Help them against their numerous enemies; Take the Honor unto thine own
self (as is most due) make it appear to all the world, That thou never
rejectest the petitions of humble and contrite hearts, nor forsakest those who
put their trust in thee: Lord command their deliverance and ours: Let us not be
like that distressed woman, so long languishing, till all be spent on helpless
Physicians; Let our miseries come speedily into thy gracious presence, that
touching the hem of thy Garment (that tender mercy and compassion wherewith
thou art clothed) these issues of blood may speedily be stayed. O Lord incline
thine ear, and hear us; O Lord consider and do it: Lord hear our Prayers for
them, and theirs for us, and both for thy beloved Son, our blessed Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ his sake. Amen.

FINIS.
