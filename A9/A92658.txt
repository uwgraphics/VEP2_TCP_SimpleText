A PROCLAMATION, Anent Field Conventicles and House-Meetings.
JAMES, by the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, To Macers of Our Privy Council, or Messengers at Arms,
Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly and severally, specially constitute, and
to all and sundry Our Leidges and Subjects, whom it effeirs; Greeting: Whereas,
We having by Our Proclamation of the twentieth of February last past, and Our
other Proclamation of the twenty eight of June thereafter, Explaining and
extending the same in favors of all Our Subjects of this Kingdom, of
whatsoever Profession, Granted full Liberty to them to Meet, and Serve God in
their own Way and Manner, on the Terms therein expressly mentioned; Yet We
understanding, That several seditious Preachers, and others declared Fugitives,
Do, nevertheless of that Our great and unexpected Clemency and Favor, Meet in
the open Fields, and there keep Conventicles (these Rendevouzes of Rebellion)
And that great numbers of persons of all sorts, do frequent these seditious
Meetings, and many in Arms: We have thought fit therefore, with Advice of Our
Privy Council, Hereby to Declare, That not only all such persons (whether
Preachers or Hearers, that shall presume to be at any Conventicle in the open
Fields) But also, all Dissenting Ministers, who shall take upon them to Preach
in Houses, without observing such Directions as are prescribed by Our said late
Proclamation* viz. That nothing be Preached or Taught among them, which may any
way tend to alienat the Hearts of Our People from Us, or Our Government, and
that their Meetings be peaceable, openly, and publicly held, and all persons
freely admitted to them, and that they do signify and make known to some one
or more of Our next Privy Counselors, Sheriffs, Stewarts, Baillies, Justices of
Peace, or Magistrates of Royal Burrows, what place or places they set apart for
these Uses, with the Names of the Preachers; Shall be Prosecuted with the
utmost rigor and severity that Our Laws, Acts of Parliament, and Constitutions
of this Our Ancient Kingdom, will allow: Requiring hereby all Our Officers,
Civil and Military, and al^ other Our good Subjects, who are, or may be any way
concerned in the Execution thereof, to see this Our Royal Will and Pleasure
duly performed, and put in Execution, conform to Our said Laws, Acts of
Parliament, and Constitutions aforesaid, every manner of way, as is thereby
Prescribed, and under the Pains and Certifications thereinmentioned; And to the
end Our said Proclamation of the twenty eight of June last, may receive due
obedience, We, with Advice foresaid, Do strictly Require all such as shall
Preach, by virtue thereof, at any time, or in any place, to make Intimat^on of
their Preaching, as to the time and place before their Meetings* to some one,
or more of Our next Privy Counselors, Sheriffs, Stewarts, Baillies, Justices of
Peace, or Magistrates of Our Royal Burrows, and of their fixing their abodes
there, which shall be sufficient to them during their Residence at that place,
or places, only; And in case they be transient Preachers, that they give the
same Intimation to some one, or more of Our Privy Council, or others aforesaid,
Both, as they will be answereable. And further, We, in Prosecution of Our said
late Proclamation, Do hereby Require all and every person aforesaid, to whom
such Intimation shall be given respective, to send in to the Clerks of Our
Privy Council, once every Month, the Name and Surname of the persons
Preachers, and the times and places of their Meetings, as they will answer the
contrary at their peril; And that Our Royal Pleasure in the Premises may be
known, and due and exact obedience given thereto; OUR WILL IS HEREFORE, and We
Charge you strictly and Command, that incontinent, these Our Letters seen, ye
pass to the Market Cross of Edinburgh, and all the other Mercat-Crosses of the
Head-Burghs of the Shires of this Kingdom, and other places needful, and there,
in Our Name and Authority, by open Proclamation, make Publication of Our
Pleasure in the Premises, that none may pretend ignorance.

Given under Our Signet at Edinburgh, the fifth day of October One thousand six
hundred eighty seven. And of Our Reign the third year. Per actum Dominorum
