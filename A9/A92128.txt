A true Relation of the Surrendering of COLCHESTER to his Excellency the Lord
General FAIRFAX.
As it was sent in a Letter to the Honorable William Lenthal, Esquire, Speaker
of the Honorable House of Commons.
SIR,
THE last night about ten of the Clock the Articles were Signed by the
Commissioners on both sides, which were to this purpose, That all Horses, with
furniture, should be delivered this day by ten of the Clock, That all private
Soldiers, and Officers under Captains shall have fair quarter, and render
themselves prisoners. That the Lords, and all Captains, and superior Officers,
and Gentlemen be drawn together to the King's Head Inn, with their Clothes and
Baggage, by eleven of the Clock, and there to render themselves to the Mercy of
the Lord General.

That the Enemies Guards be drawn off, and Guards of this Army appointed in
their stead: That all Ordnance, Ammunition, Wagons, etc. be delivered to the
Comptroller. That the sick and wounded be provided for, with Accommodation,
until recovered. And accordingly this forenoon Col. Rainsboroughs Regiment,
and another Regiment entered the Town, and the Articles in all things else
performed: You will very suddenly receive an Account from his Excellency, of
the particulars, of this business, as also a List of what persons of quality,
Officers, and Commanders are at Mercy, and the number of Ordnance, Arms, and
quantity of Ammunition. This morning we rode round about the Wall of the Town,
and find it to be a very strong place in all parts of it; Where it was
weakest, there they made strong Works, or strengthened it with Earth. It was a
sad spectacle to see so many fair Houses burnt to Ashes, and so many
Inhabitants made so sickly and weak with living upon Horses and Dogs. Many glad
to eat the very Draught and Grains for preservation of life. I remain,

Your humble Servant, John Rushworth.
