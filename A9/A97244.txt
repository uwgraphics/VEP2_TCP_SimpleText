The Young-womans Complaint: OR, A Caveat to all Maids to have a care how they
be Married to Old Men.
The Tune is, What should a young woman do with an old man, etc. Or, The Tyrant.





COme all you young damsels
both beauteous and free,
I Will Summon you all
to listen to me;
A Song of misguiding,
concerning my Marriage,
Sorrow's the cause of
this my ill carriage;
A Maiden of fifteen
as it may appear
She Married an Old Man
of Seventy-two year;
And by her misfortune
well prove it I can,
That she is sore troubled
with an Old Man.
When he sits down by me,
he will presently blame me,
He often does chide me
and threatens to lame me;
Then fain would I hide me
but cannot tell where.
He calls me young Giglet,
and sometimes bold whore;
But hold thy tongue man,
for I am none such,
I dare not call Cuckold
though I think as much:
She throws by her Bracelets
her Hat and her Fan,
Sing cursed be the time
that I saw this Old Man.
To speak of his Livings
his Land or his Fee,
Or of his Relations
too tedious 'twill be;
His humping, his grumping
his cursing, and swearing,
He Is almost quite blind,
and heard of his hearing,
His Pate it is bauld, and
his Beard it is thin,
His Breath it does stink,
and short is his thing:
And now let him do
what ever he can,
Judge if it be fitting
to love this Old Man.
In Bed as I lie,
he groaneth he cries
Like one that is dyeing
in sorrow he lies:
Instead of Loves blisses
he scraches and grambles
And all the night long
he tosses and tumbles,
And lying and dyeing
and telling the Clock,
Weeping and wailing,
expecting a Knock:
And wiping away her
tears as they ran,
What shall a young woman
do with this old man.
The second part, to the same Tune.
HE stoops in the shoulders
and goes almost double
He is always to me
a continual trovble,
His Breast it sticks forth
even almost with his snout,
He seldom goes far without
letting a rout,
His hands they do shake,
and he is very lame,
And all his whole body is
quite out of frame,
His Nose it is long, and
his face pale and wan.
With all the ill properties
of an Old man.
When he walks abroad with me
sometimes in the street
He limps, and he stumbles,
the boys they do see it,
And laugh him to scorn,
he creeps and he grumbles,
He coughs and he spits,
and at last he down tumbles
Then I cry and lament
that ere I was born*
But to quit his love, I Will
make him wear the horn;
For let me do what
ever I may or can,
I still shall be plagued
with this doting old man.
If I with some young men
do chance for to meet,
And do but them freindly
and courteously greet,
Then he begins presently
to scold and brawl,
And a thousand base names
he then will me call,
Which makes me with grief
and sorrow lament,
And now it is too late
I fear to repent:
But I Will get a Youngster that
please me well can,
Then a fig for this doting
feeble old man.
I forced was to marry him
'cause of his Wealth,
But I Will have another now*
and then by stealth:
For with him I must never
expect any joy;
Which vexes me worst
I shall nere have a boy;
Therefore I Am resolved to
live merry and ^olly,
And take the best course
to quite Melancholy.
For what should a yo^ng-woman
do with this old man
But make him a Cuckold
as soon as she can
There Is young men enough,
Which will make much of me
And I unto them will be
gallant and free:
They Will court me and kiss
and please me full well,
And I will not want it,
the truth I you tell;
His Chests I Will set open,
his money let fly,
For I Will lead a merry life,
until I dye.
What should a yo^ng-woman
do with this old man,
But make him a Cuckold
as soon as she can.
My advice is to you all
Maids that are young,
That you get you Husband,
that will you not wrong,
For sure youth with age
will never agree,
As by this Ditty you
plainly may see;
Therefore take you warning
all by my miscarriage,
Be sure to be wise in
your choice of Marriage:
For I Will assure you,
do what you can,
You never can love such,
an Old doting man.
Finis.
