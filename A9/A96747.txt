MAJOR Wither's Disclaimer: BEING A Disavowment of a late Paper, ENTITLED The
Doubtful Almanac. Jan: 8th 1646
LATELY PUBLISHED In the name of the said Major WITHER.

AMong the many abusive Practices and Pamphlets now frequent, there is a Paper
lately printed, and sold, called The Doubtful Almanac; which being Published
in the Name of G: Wither, is therefore commonly reputed to have been composed
and set forth by Geo. Wither Esquire, lately known, by the Titles of Captain
and Major Wither; who having had a view thereof, and considering how great an
impudence it is in the Divulger to entitle him thereunto, and how injurious,
Forgeries of that nature might become if they should be tolerated or passed by
without dislike; He does hereby publicly disclaim the said Paper, as neither
of his making, nor justifiable in its own nature; And protests that though it
were as worthy the owning, as he could wish it had been; yet, he is no more
ambitious to father other men's best Fancies; then desirous to be thought Author
of their basest, and most mischievous Inventions.

Excuse ^^m therefore if he make have to send abroad this plea of Di^cl^imer,
especially seeing he conceives, there is as well Malignancy coached in the
Discourse, as injurious dealing in the manner of recommending it to the People:
For, that which to him appears to be principally designed (though it makes a
show of somewhat else) seems to be of a very dangerous and seditious
consequence; and to be nothing suitable to that Piety and Peace which is
pretended by the Author: And if the Piece be well heeded and considered, he
conceives it will be found an Engine contrived to help blow that Flame, which
is too much kindled, and to widen that Breach which is too far enlarged
already, and which Flame and Breach, the said Major Wither, upon whom that
paper is falsely fathered, has seriously (though without thank from the
generality of either Party) endeavored to quench and close up to his utmost
power.

It was not his intention, to express any thing in confutation of what is
contained in the paper, but only to acquit himself from being Author thereof;
yet, for prevention of what evil may else ensue, he thinks it his duty having
just occasion given to signify what he suspecteth both of the matter, and the
Author, which in plain terms is this; that the Author is some Malignant
Incendiarie, who according to the strength of his wit contributeth to that
secret Design, which is prosecuted by other Jesuiticall Projectors to ruin
these Kingdoms, and to re-advance Tyranny and the Throne of Antichrist among
us; And that to whomsoever he seems to adhere, that, whomsoever he openly
strikes at, and whatsoever he dissemblingly pretends, his main scope is to
increase the Rent, and to divide the Nations, the King, the Parliament, and the
People further from each other; and by exasperating the Presbyterians against
the Independents, and the Independents against the Presbyterians, to renew the
war, to the weakening, or tearing of all in pieces, that so either the enraged
and untamed Lions, or Leopards at home may prey upon us; or, that when we have
acted over the fabulous Battles of the Frogs and Mice, we may be devoured by
the Kites and Eagles from abroad,

And, this may justly enough be suspected, though there were no other
probabilities thereof, but the said Authors acting of a lie, in fathering the
spurious issue of his brain upon another man without his consent or knowledge,
that he might play the Incendiary with the more security, at another man's
hazard: For he has sufficiently manifested thereby, that neither he himself
nor his Designs, are so honest as they should be; And doubtless, if that God
had been in his heart, whose name in his Paper, he has so often taken in
vain; or, if his zeal to the preservation of purity in Religion had been as
hearty and as true as he would have insinuated; that Religion would have
informed him, we ought not to make a lie for God; much less to the injury, or
disadvantage of our Brother.

But, by the thanks which was this day given unto the said Major for the Paper,
by some who believed it to be his, and by the commendations which is applied
thereto by many, the Malignancy of the said Paper seemth to be either none at
all, or so couched, that every Reader cannnot discover it; And indeed, the
poison is so cunningly infused, that it may be received, and operate also so
insensibly, that the mischief may be done, before it will be discovered, that
any thing else but a benefit was intended. Be pleased therefore, for your
better discovery thereof, to examine the Authors parallelling of the King and
the Parliament, with David and Absalom. For, though to blind your eyes he
confounds you in the parallel, and puzzells you in the Allegory, with an
Application thereof to Sectaries and Schismatics, whose insinuations and
Treacheries he alludeth to the practices of Rebellious Absalom; yet if you heed
his legerdemain and what is cast in, whilst you are looking another way; and
what real Friends of our are covertly stabbed whilst they pretend to be in a
furious pursuit of our seeming enemies, you shall find that your
Almanack-Maker who usurpes the name of Geo: Wither, is likely to be as well a
fatherer, as a Presager, of the Calamities which his Prognostication says are
yet to ensue.

Let them who yet perceive not this juggling, but take Major Withers Spectacles
and read the last five lines of the third page of that Doubtful Almanac,
especially these words in a parenthesis, ( a Prince a great while since David's
days, did himself the greatest injury, when he intended to his people the
greatest Boon) consider well these words; for by them, weighed with what
precedes and follows you may plainly perceive the Authors opinion of a large
bounty and indulgence in the King toward his Parliament, and of of a traitorous
ingratitude of the Parliament toward him.

In the fourth page he has these words, Oh! nothing is so favouable for the
Covert of black-Designes, as some exercise of Religion: Be sure that be
strongly pretended, when you mainly intend this, and all is well: to act
devotion, while one plots villainy, frees the Design, not only from suspicion;
but procures a good opinion of it; And that this is spoken to insinuate that
the Parliament has under the color of a Religious Reformation, abused the
Kings Grace, and his trust reposed therein, it seems very manifest, by the
dependence it has on what goes before, and by the impertinency of that clause
to any other purpose: For, the Parallel is not yet restrained to the Sectaries,
but relates to those for whose sake, as he says, a Prince a great while since
David's days, did himself the greatest injury by intending the greatest boon
to his people; which must unquestionably mean the Parliament and the
Privileges by him granted thereunto, or signify nothing; as must also that
which follows in the fifth page, (mentioning Sadocks and Abiathars and Gods
chief Priests in Ordinary, sticking close to David, etc. For it appears as if
purposely inserted, to illustrate the faithfulness of the Prelates and those
Court-Chaplaines, with their companions of the Clergy, who followed the King
when he deserted the Parliament, and tacitly to impute traiterousnesse to
those, who adhered thereunto, in their Absalom-like Rebellion against the King,
as he would have it understood by his Parallel.

A little afterward, in the same page, you may perceive him following his
falsely applied Allegory, to the giving of the Parliament two other secret
wounds, as he perhaps hoped; The one by insinuating, as if they had raised
their Armies with no better warrant then Absalom; and to as wicked a purpose,
which is intimated in these words, though scarce sense; He marched into the
field with a puissant Army, and give him but a pitched battle, both for King
and David; The other wound which he seems to hope he shall give them, is, by
intimating that they had unjustly slandered the Kings Government, and abused
the people with fair promises, to place themselves at the helm; which (he
says) is a wile much practiced among us within these few years, and whom can
he mean hereby but the Parliament, though they have given no just occasion that
he should so mean? for neither the Independents nor Presbyterians by themselves
can be said to have assumed on them any Supreme Government.

In the sixth page (though in a confused manner) the Story is made use of also
to hint unto the People (as very probably appears) by David's indulgence to
Absalom (notwithstanding his horrible unnatural rebellion) how tenderly
sensible the King is of the great plagues which are like to fall on his
Absalom-like Parliament; and yet, how stubbornely they still persevere in their
Rebellion against him, yea, this Author seems desirous to have thereby inferred
(if his perplexed expressions could have reached thereunto) that the King is
and was so far from being an enemy to the Parliament, or from seeking the
destruction thereof, that he could be as well content to die for the
preservation thereof, as David was, for the salvation of his Son: If this be
not his meaning, it is hard to say what meaning he has in all that which is
inserted of David's greeving for Absalom: And, if that be his meaning, then what
opinion he has, of the Parliaments arming in defense of the peoples
Privileges and safety, it may easily be judged. And if it may justly be
insinuated, that the King is, and hath-been so affected, as this Prognosticator
would by his Parallel imply (and as many do now begin to persuade the People as
far as they yet dare) then doubtless all the world is not able to excuse the
Parliament and their Adherents, from being as treacherous and ungrateful as
Absalom; Let the King (in Gods name) be justified or excused, or his failings
connived at, so far forth as it may stand with justice and charity; yea let
that be given to Caesar, which is due unto Caesar, but let Gods due and the
Peoples Rights and Privileges be therewith preserved.

Now to color over all his malignancy (hitherto not so fully shadowed, but
that it might have been descride, without some other cloak or evasion) that
Author leads you aside, by improperly making the Sectaries seem to be his
intended Parallel to Absalom; which, how absurdly it will quadrate with the
Story, let the prudent judge. If the Independents or Sectaries (call them what
you please) may be so justly parallelled with Absalom as this Pamphleter
affirms, let them look to it whom it concerns; The Major, for his part,
resolves to be as wary as he can, neither to justify the wicked, nor
condemn the innocent, but to look to his own ways, and his own heart, as
well as he may: And (if his council might be taken) would advise his brethren
of both Parties, that their affairs might be managed with so much justice,
prudence and charity, toward all men hereafter, that the wheat may discreetly
be divided from the straw and the chafe, by the flaile and the fan; and not
purged according to the humor of those Incendiaries, who will set the whole
barn on fire, if they be not looked unto in time.

It is plainly enough to be seen without an extraordinary Perspective, and to
be foreseen, without an Almanac, what Designs are now in prosecution, and
what will certainly follow, if the bitterness of contradictory Parties be not
sweetened with more charity and discretion then yet appears among us; and it is
evident how little hope there would be of having it ever otherwise, if every
man should engage himself as wilfully and as unreasonably, to strengthen one
Party, as many do, and none be as third Persons or Mediums, to cement us
together, before the policy which is now working, has irreconcileably divided
us, to our irrecoverable destruction.

Thus much has Major Wither thought fit to signify upon the occasion offered
by the divulging of the foresaid paper in his name; not for such ends as may
be perhaps imagined; but, lest by being silent, he might fail of his duty, and
have many other things falsely imputed unto him, and fathered upon him
hereafter, to the wronging of himself and his Readers, whom he would not
willingly permit to be deceived by ought divulged in his name. He is neither of
Paul, nor of Apollo, nor of Cephas, but as they are of Christ; nor against any
but in that which is against him, and his Kingdom: nor has he so learned him,
as wittingly to seek his own peace, or profit, by dividing from, or by
adhering to any Party, to the infringement either of the peace of Christ's
Kingdom, of these Kingdoms, or of his own conscience: but has ever
endeavored, according to his power, to put himself into such a Christian, and
civil posture, and so to continue therein, that he may be an instrument of
general reconciliation, and one of those Peacemakers, that shall be numbered
among the Children of God, whatsoever he be esteemed among men. And he having
hitherto spoken for himself in a third person, will now add a brief
conclusion thereunto, in his own Person, and in his proper Strain.

This Brat, to him that got it, I return;
Or, to the Parish, where the same was born;
Lest half the misbegotten in the Town,
To find a father, at my door be thrown:
Or, lest they shame me; or, may me constrain
To father more, then I can well maintain.
For, you already in most houses find
So many several children, in this kind,
Of my begetting; and, I have at home
So many too, not strong enough become
To walk abroad) that I much more had rather
To let my neighbors those Escapes to father,
Then father theirs; although it be no shame
To have them known, and called by my name.
This Bastard is not like me in the pace,
Nor in the language; neither in the face,
Nor in condition, so resembling me,
As that, it mine, it may appear to be.
For, when two Parties I do guilty know,
I strike not one, and let the other go,
But give them all their due, without regard,
Or fear, of what may follow afterward;
Though often thereby I fair preferments lose,
Displease my Friends, and multiply my foes.
I am not so reserved, as to make
(As this man did) a Doubtful Almanac,
Of that which might be certainly foretold,
If they whom it concerns regard it would.
Nor will I do it, though I shall be sure
Of such requital while my days endure.
And they who doubt this, shall their error see,
As often as occasions offered be.
But ere I next adventure on the Press,
I mean to get my self another Dress;
And come forth clear from dirt, late sprinkled on me.
Mean while, I Am pleased, that they who wrong have done me,
Should brag a while; and have a time to show
Their malice: and that I my friends may know.
Yea, I am pleased a while to be your Debtor,
For answering the late injurious LETTER,
Writ by the KNAVE OF SPADES, or by his CLARK,
And published by the DEVIL in the dark.
Till then therefore, my Readers all, adieu;
And be to me, as I shall prove to you.
Geo. Wither. Printed by R. Austin. 1647. 1646
