The Swearers Chorus TO THE First Presbyterian PLOT.
^ THere was a Monstrous Doctor; This Doctor had no Peer, a Rogue from his
Cradle, and bred ^ to Lie and Swear; And a Swearing we will go, will go, will
go, and a Swearing we will go,

II.
A Bag for my Pilgrims,
Another for Black Bills,
Ten thousand blank Commissions
To move as many Hills:
And a Swearing we will go, will go, will go,
And a Swearing we will go.
III.
A Bag for my Sallery,
From every Fool suborns,
Three brawny Bums to follow me,
And bugger them by turns:
And a Bugg'ring we will go, etc.
IV.
A Bag for my Plunder,
Sir William's on the scent;
The Pole did never so thunder
In the Grand Vizier's Tent*
And a Plund'ring we will go, etc.
V.
A Bag for my Necklace,
Another for my Plate;
And all shall be Fish
That comes in Wallers Net;
And a Plund'ring we will go, etc.
VI.
A Bag for our Pistols
And Consecrated Knives,
And one for Tormentillio's,
T'fright Fools out of their Lives:
And a Plotting we will go, etc.
VII.
A Bag for the Parson,
Another for Don John;
Though I swore like a Whoreson,
Yet still I would swear on:
And a Swearing we will go, etc.
VIII.
Through four and twenty Key-holes
I sallied like a Witch,
And through as many Brick walls
I Will swear I went through -- stitch:
And a Swearing we will go, etc.
IX.
To Lambeth we will go,
Where we first made the PLOT;
While Prance and I can swear and lie,
They all shall go to pot;
And a Plotting we will go, etc.
X.
Then we will to Godfrey go,
And find Him killed of the spot,
And swear the Papists did it,
To make a Popish Plot:
And a Murdering we will go, etc.
XI.
A Gown I have for show
Amongst the Clergy grave,
And, when I please, a Cloak
To hide the double Knave:
And a Plotting we will go, etc.
XII.
I had a pretty knack
To Wheedle, Swear and Lie;
By the Rebellious Rabble
How much admired was I!
And a Swearing we will go, etc.
XIII.
In fair London Town
I live, and pay no Rent;
The Brethren they provide for me,
And I am well content:
And a Swearing we will go, etc.
XIV.
Of all Occupations
The Swearer is most blessed;
For when he swears most falsely,
He Is always paid the best:
And a Swearing we will go, etc.
XV.
I fear no Plot against me,
Although the Whigs rebel;
Then who would be honest,
Since such Rogues fare so well?
And a Plotting we will go, will go, will go;
And a Plotting we will go.
