PROT RELIGION AND LIBERTY IE MAINTIENDRAY
blazon or coat of armsTHE DECLARATION OF HIS HIGHNESS WILLIAM HENRY, By the
Grace of God PRINCE OF ORANGE, etc.
Of the reasons inducing him, To Appear in Arms in the Kingdom of England,
for Preserving of the Protestant Religion, and for Restoring the Laws and
Liberties of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND and IRELAND.
IT is both certain, and Evident to all men, that the Public Peace and
Happiness of any State or Kingdom, can not be preserved, where the Laws,
Liberties, and Customs established, by the Lawful authority in it, are openly
Transgressed and Annulled: More especially where the alteration of Religion is
endeavored, and that a Religion which is contrary to Law is endeavored to be
introduced: Upon which those who are most Immediately Concerned in it, are
Indispensably bound, to endeavor to Preserve and maintain the established
Laws Liberties and Customs: and above all the Religion and worship of God,
that is Established among them: And to take such an effectual care, that the
Inhabitants of the said State or Kingdom, may neither be deprived of their
Religion, nor of their Civil Rights. Which is so much the more Necessary
because the Greatness and Security both of Kings, Royal families, and of all
such as are in Authority, as well as the Happiness of their Subjects and People,
depend, in a most especial manner, upon the exact observation, and maintenance
of these their Laws Liberties, and Customs.

Upon these grounds it is, that we cannot any longer forbear, to Declare that
to our great regret, we see that those Councillors, who have now the chieffe
credit with the King, have overturned the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of
those Realms: and subjected them in all things relating to their Consciences,
Liberties, and Properties, to Arbitrary Government: and that not only by secret
and Indirect ways, but in an open and undisguised manner.

Those Evil Councillors for the advancing and coloring this, with some
plausible pretexts, did Invent and set on foot, the Kings Dispencing power, by
virtue of which, they pretend that according to Law, he can Suspend and
Dispense with the Execution of the Laws, that have been enacted by the
Authority, of the King and Parliament, for the security and happiness of the
Subject, and so have rendered those Laws of no effect: Tho there is nothing
more certain, then that as no Laws can be made, but by the joint concurrence
of King and Parliament, so likewise laws so enacted, which secure the Public
peace, and safety of the Nation, and the lives and liberties of every subject
in it, can not be repealed or suspended but by the same authority.

For tho the King may pardon the punishment, that a Transgressour has incurred,
and to which he is condemned, as in the cases of Treason or Felony; yet it
cannot be with any color of reason, Inferred from thence, that the King can
entirely suspend the execution of those Laws, relating to Treason or Felony:
Unless it is pretended, that he is clothed with a Despotick and Arbitrary
power, and that the Lives, Liberties, Honors and Estates of the Subjects,
depend wholly on his good will and Pleasure, and are entirely subject to him;
which must infallibly follow, on the Kings having a power to suspend the
execution of the Laws, and to dispense with them.

Those Evil Councillors, in order to the giving some credit to this strange
and execrable Maxim, have so conducted the matter, that they have obtained a
Sentence from the Judges, declaring that this Dispencing power, is a Right
belonging to the Crown; as if it were in the power of the twelve Judges, to
offer up the Laws, Rights, and Liberties, of the whole Nation, to the King, to
be disposed of by him Arbitrarily and at his Pleasure and expressly contrary to
Laws enacted, for the security of the Subjects. In order to the obtaining this
Judgment, those Evil Councillors did before hand, examine secretly, the
Opinion of the Judges, and procured such of them, as could not in Conscience
concur in so pernicious a Sentence, to be turned out, and others to be
substituted in their Rooms till by the changes which were made, in the Courts
of Judicature, they at last obtained that Judgment. And they have raised some
to those Trusts, who make open Profession of the Popish Religion, tho those are
by Law Rendered Incapable all such Employments.

It is also Manifest and Notorious, that as his Majesty was, upon his coming
to the Crown, received and acknowledged by all the subjects of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, as their King without the least opposition, tho he made
then open profession, of the Popish Religion so he did then Promise, and
Solemnly Swear, at his Coronation, that he would maintain his subjects, in the
free enjoyment of their Laws, and Liberties, and in particular, that he would
maintain the Church of England as it was established by Law: It is likewise
certain, that there have been at diverse and sundry times, several Laws
enacted for the preservation of those Rights, and Liberties, and of the
Protestant Religion: and among other Securities, it has been enacted that all
Persons whatsoever, that are advanced to any Ecclesiastical Dignity, or to
bear Office in either University, as likewise all other, that should be put in
any Employment, Civil or Military, should declare that they were not Papists,
but were of the Protestant Religion, and that, by their taking of the Oaths of
Allegange, and Supreamacy and the Test, yet these Evil Councillors have in
effect annulled and abolished all those Laws, both with relation to
Ecclesiastical and Civil Employments.

In order to Ecclesiastical Dignities and Offices they have not only without
any color of Law, but against most express Laws to the contrary, set up a
Commission, of a certain Number of persons, to whom they have committed the
cognizance and direction of all Ecclesiastical matters: in the which
Commission there has been and still is, one of His Majesty's Ministers of
State, who makes now public profession of the Popish Religion, and who at the
time of his first professing it, declared that for a great while before, he had
believed that to be the only true Religion. By all this, the deplorable State
to which the Protestant Religion is reduced is Apparent, since the Affairs of
the Church of England, are now put into the hands of Persons, who have accepted
of a Commission that is manifesty Illegal; and who have executed it contrary to
all Law; and that now one of their chieffe Members has abjured the Protestant
Religion and declared himself a Papist; by which he is become Incapable of
holding any Public Employment: The said Commissioners have hitherto given such
proof, of their submission to the directions given them, that there is no
reason to doubt, but they will still continue to promote all such designs as
will be most aggreable to them. And those Evil Councillors take care, ta
raise none to any Ecclesiastical dignities, but persons that have no zeal for
the Protestant Religion, and that now hide their unconcernednes for it, under
the specious pretense of Moderation. The said Commissioners have suspended the
Bishop of London, only because he refused to obey an order, that was sent him
to suspend a Worthy Divine, without so much as citing him before him, to make
his own Defense, or observing the common forms of Process. They have turned
out a President, chosen by the fellows of Magdalen College, and afterward all
the Fellows of that College, without so much as citing them before any Court
that could take legal cognissance of that affair; or obtaining any Sentence
against them by a Competent Judge. And the only reason, that was given, for
turning them out, was their refusing to choose for their President; a Person
that was recommended to them, by the Instigation of those Evil Councillors.
Tho the right of a free Election belonged undoubredly to them. But they were
turned out of their freeholds, contrary to Law, and to that express provision
in the Magna Charta; that no man shall lose life or Goods, but by the Law of
the land. And now these Evil Councillors have put the said College wholly
into the hands of Popists, tho as is abovesaid, they are Incapable, of all such
Employments, both by the Law of the Land, and the statutes of the College.
These Commissioners have also cited before them all the Chancellours and
Archdeacons of England, requiring them to certify to them the names, of all
such Clergymen, as have read the Kings declaration for Liberty of Conscience,
and of such as have not read it: without considering that the reading of it,
was not enjoined the Clergy, by the Bishops, who are their Ordinaries. The
Illegality and Incompetency of the said Court of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, was so notoriously known, and it did so Evidently appear, that
it tended to the Subversion of the Protestant Religion, that the Most Reverend
Father in God, William Archbishop of Canterbury Primate and Metropolitan of all
England, seeing that it was raised for no other end, but to oppress such
persons as were of Eminent Virtue, Learning, and Piety, refused to sit or to
concur in it.

And tho there are many express Laws against all Churches or Chapells, for
the exercise of the Popish Religion, and also against all Monasteries and
Convents, and more particularly against the order of the Jesuits, yet those
Evil Councillors have Procured orders for the building of several Churches
und Chapels, for the Exercise of that Religion: They have also procuted
diverse Monasteries to be Erected, and in contempt of the Law they have not
only set up several Colleges of Jesuits, in diverse places, for the
corrupting of the youth, but have raised up one of the Order, to be a Privy
Counselor and a Minister of State. By all which they do evidently show, that
they are restrained by no rules or Law whatsoever; but that they have subjected
the Honors and Estates of the subjects, and the Established Religion, to a
Despotick power and to Arbitrary Government: In all which they are served and
seconded by those Ecclesiastical Commissioners.

They have also followed the same methods with Relation to Civil affairs: For
they have procured Orders, to examine all Lords Lieutenants, Deputy
Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, and all others that were in any
Public Employment, if they would concur with The King in the Repeal of the
Test and Penal Laws: and all such, whose Consciences did not suffer them, to
comply with their designs, were turned out; and others were put in their
places, who they believed would be more Compliant to them; in their Designs of
defeating the Intent and Execution of those Laws; which had been made with so
much care and caution, for the Security of the Protestant Religion. And in many
of these places they have put professed Papists, tho the Law has disabled them,
and warranted the subjects not to have any regard to their Orders.

They have also invaded the Privileges, and seized on the Charters of most of
those Towns that have a right to be represented by their Burgesses in
Parliament: and have procured surrenders to be made of them, by which the
Magistrates in them have delivered up all their Rights, and Priveledges, to be
disposed of, at the pleasure of those Evil Councillors: who have thereupon,
placed new Magistrates in those Towns, such as they can most entirely confide
in: and in many of them, they have put Popish Magistrates, notwithstanding the
Incapacities under which the Law has put them.

And whereas no Nation what soever can subsist without the administration of
good and impartial Justice, upon which men's Lives, Liberties, Honors, and
Estates, do depend; those Evil Councillors have subjected these to an
Arbitrary and Despotick power: In the most important affairs, they have studied
to discover before hand, the Opinions of the Judges; and have turned out such,
as they found would not conform themselves to their intentions: and have put
others in their places, of whom they were more assured, without having any
regard to their abilities. And they have not stuck to raise even professed
Papists, to the Courts of Judicature, notwithstanding their Incapacity by Law,
and that no Regard is due to any Sentences flowing from them. They have carried
this so far, as to deprive such Judges, who in the common administration of
Justice, showed that they were governed by their Consciences, and not by the
directions, which the others gave them. By which it is apparent that they
design to render themselves the absolute Masters of the Lives, Honors and
Estates of the subjects, of what rank or dignity soever they may be: and that
without having any regard either to the equity of the cause, or to the
Consciences of the Judges, whom they will have to submit in all things, to
their own will, and pleasure: hoping by such ways, to Intimidate those who are
yet in Employment, as also such others, as they shall think fit, to put in the
Rooms of those whom they have turned out; and to make them see, what they must
look for, if they should at any time act in the least contrary to their good
liking^ and that no failings of that kind, are pardoned, in any persons
whatsoever. A great deal of blood has been shed in many places of the
Kingdom, by Judges governed by those Evil Councillors, against all the rules
and forms of Law; without so much as suffering the persons that were accused,
to Plead in their own Defense.

They have also, by putting the administration of justice, in the hands of
Papists, brought all the matters of Civil Justice into great uncertainties:
with how much exactnes and Justice soever that these Sentences may have been
given. For since the Laws of the Land do not only exclude Papists from all
places of Judicature, but have put them under an Incapacity, none are bound to
acknowledge or to obey their Judgments, and all Sentences given by them, are
null and void of themselves: so that all persons who have been cast, in Trialls
before such Popish Judges, may justly look on their Pretended Sentences, as
having no more force, then the Sentences of any private and unauthorised person
whatsoever. So deplorable is the case of the Subjects, who are obliged to
answer to such Judges, that must in all things stick to the rules, which are
set them by those Evil Councillors, who as they raised them up to those
Employments, so can turn them out of them at pleasure; and who can never be
esteemed Lawful Judges; so that all their Sentences are in the Construction of
the law, of no Force and Efficacy. They have likewise disposed of all Military
Employments, in the same manner: For tho the Laws have not only Excluded
Papists, from all such Employments, but have in particular, Provided that they
should be Disarmed; yet they in Contempt of these Laws, have not only armed
the Papists, but have likewise raised them up to the greatest Military Trusts,
both by Sea and Land, and that Strangers as well as Natives, and Irish as well
as English, that so by those means, having rendered themselves Masters both of
the affairs of the Church, of the Government of the Nation, and of the course
of Justice, and subjected them all to a Despotick and Arbitrary power, they
might be in a Capacity to maintain and Execute their wicked designs, by the
assistance of the Army, and thereby to enslave the Nation.

The dismal effects of this subversion of the established Religion, Laws and
Liberties in England appear more evidently to us, by what we see done in
Ireland: Where the whole Government is put in the hands of Papists, and where
all the Protestant Inhabitants are under the daily fears of what may be justly
apprehended, from the Arbitrary power which is set up there: which has made
great numbers of them, leave that Kingdom and abandon their Estates in it,
remembering well that Cruel and Bloody Massacre which fell out in that Island
in the year 1641.

Those Evil Councillors have also prevailed with the King to declare in
Scotland that he is clothed with Absolute power, and that all the subjects are
bound to obey him without Reserve: upon which he has assumed an Arbitrary
power, both over the Religion and Laws of that Kingdom, from all which it is
Apparent, what is to be looked for in England, as soon as matters are duly
prepared for it.

Those great and insufferable Oppressions, and the open Contempt of all Law,
together with the apprehensions of the sad Consequences that must certainly
follow upon it, have put the subjects under great and just fears; and have made
them look after such lawful Remedies as are allowed of in all Nations: yet all
has been without effect. And those Evil Councillors have endeavored to make
all men apprehend, the loss of their Lives, Libertys, Honors, and Estates, if
they should go about to preserve themselves from this Oppression, by
Petitions, Representations, or other means authorized by Law. Thus did they
proceed with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the other Bishops, who having
offered a most humble petition to the King, in terms full of Respect, and not
exceeding the number limited by Law, in which they set forth in short, the
Reasons, for which they could not obey that order, which by the Instigation of
those Evil Councillors, was sent them, requiring them to appoint their Clergy
to read in their Churches the Declaration for Liberty of Conscience; were sent
to prison and afterward brought to a Trial, as if they had been guilty of
some enormous Crime. They were not only obliged, to defend themselves in that
pursuit, but to appear before Professed Papists, who had not taken the Test and
by Consequence were men whose interest led them to condemn them: and the
Judges that gave their opinion in their favors were thereupon turned out.

And yet it can not be pretended, that any Kings; how great soever their power
has been, and how Arbitrary and Despotick soever, they have been in the
exercise of it, have ever reckoned it a crime for their Subjects to come, in
all Submission and Respect, and in a due number, not exceeding the limits of
the Law, and represent to them the Reasons that made it impossible for them to
obey their orders. Those Evil Councillors have also treated a Peer of the
Realm, as a Criminal, only because he said that the subjects were not bound
to obey the orders of a Popish Justice of Peace: tho it is Evident, that they
being by Law rendered incapable of all such trusts, no regard is due to their
orders. This being the security which the people have by the Law for their
Lives, Liberties, Honors and Estates, that they are not to be subjected to the
Arbitrary procedings of Papists, that are contrary to Law, put into any
Employments Civil or Military.

Both We our selves, and our Dearest and most Entirely Beloved Consort, the
Princess, have endeavored to signify in terms full of respect, to the King
the just and deep Regret which all these Proceedings have given us; and in
Compliance with his Majesty's desires signified to us, We Declared both by
word of mouth, to his Envoy, and in writing; what our Thoughts were touching
the Repealing of the Test and Penal Laws; which we did in such a manner,
that we hoped we had proposed an Expedient, by which the Peace of those
Kingdoms, and a happy aggreement among the Subjects, of all Persuasions, might
have been settled: but those Evil Councillors, have put such ill Constructions
on these our good Intentions, that they have endeavored to alienate the King
more and more from us: as if We had designed, to Disturb the quiet and
Happiness of the Kingdom.

The last and great Remedy for all those Evils, Is the Calling of a
Parliament, for securing the Nation, against the evil practices of those
wicked Councillors: but this could not be yet compassed, nor can it be easily
brought about. For those men apprehending that a lawful Parliament, being once
assembled, they would be brought to an account, for all their open violations
of Law, and for their Plots and Conspiracies against the Protestant Religion,
and the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, they have endeavored under the
specious Pretense of Liberty of Conscience; first to Sow divisions among
Protestants, between those of the Church of England and the Dissenters: The
design being laid to engage Protestants; that are all equally Concerned, to
pteserve themselves from Popish Oppression; into mutual quarrellings; that so
by these, some advantages might be given to them to bring about their Designs;
and that both in the Election of the Members of Parliament, and afterward in
the Parliament it self. For they see well that if all Protestants, could enter
into a mutual Good Understanding, one with another, and Concur together, in
the Preserving of their Religion, it would not be possible for them to compass
their wicked ends. They have also required all Persons in the several Counties
of England, that either were in any Employment, or were in any Considerable
Esteem, to declare before hand, that they would concur in the Repeal of the
Test and Penael Laws; and that they would give their voices in the Elections
to Parliament, only for such as would concur in it: Such as would not thus
Preingage themselves were turned out of all Employments: And others who entered
into those engagments, were put in their places, many of them being Papists:
And contrary to the Charters and Privileges of those Buroughs, that have a
Right to send Burgesses to Parliament, they have ordered such Regulations to be
made, as they thought fit and necessary, for assuring themselves of all the
Members, that are to be chosen by those Corporations: and by this means they
hope to avoid that Punishment which they have Deserved: tho it is apparent,
that all Acts made by Popish Magistrates are null, and Void of themselves; So
that no Parliament can be Lawful, for which the Elections and Returns are made
by Popish Sheriffs and Majors of Touns; and Therefore as long as the Authority
and Magistrary is in such hands, it is not possible to have any Lawful
Parliament. And tho according to the Constitution of the English Government,
and Immemoriall Custom, all Elections of Parliament men ought to be made with
an Entire Liberty, without any sort of force, or the requiring the Electors to
choose such Persons as shall be named to them, and the Persons thus freely
Elected, ought to give their Opinions freely, upon all Matters, that are
brought before them, having the good of the Nation ever before their Eyes, and
following in all things the dictates of their Conscience, yet now the People of
England can not expect a Remedy from a free Parliament, Legally Called and
Chosen. But they may perhaps see one Called, in which all Elections will be
carried by Fraud or Force, and which will be composed of such Persons, of whom
those Evil Councillors hold themselves well assured, in which all things will
be carried on according to their Direction and Interest, with out any regard to
the Good or Happiness of the Nation. Which may appear Evidently from this, that
the same Persons tried the Members of the last Parliament, to gain them to
Consent to the Repeal of the Test and Penal Laws, and procured that Parliament
to be dissolved, when they found that they could not, neither by promises nor
Threatenings, Prevail with the Members to Comply with their wicked Designs.

But to Crown all, there are Great and Violent Presumptions, Inducing us to
Believe, that those Evil Councillors, in order to the carrying on of their
ill Designs, and to the Gaining to themselves the more time for the Effecting
of them, for the encouraging of their Accomplices, and for the discouraging of
all Good Subjects, have published that the Queen has brought forth a Son: tho
there have appeared both during the Queens pretended Bigness, and in the manner
in which the Birth was managed, so many just and Visible grounds of suspicion,
that not only we our selves, but all the good Subjects of those Kingdoms, do
Vehemently suspect, that the pretended Prince of Walss was not born by the
Queen. And it is notoriously known to all the world, that many both doubted of
the Queens Bigness, and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any one
thing done to Satisfy them, or to put an end to their Doubts.

And since our Dearest and most Entirely Beloved Consort, the Princess, and
likewise we Our Selves, have so great an Interest in this Matter, and such a
Right, as all the world knows, to the Succession to the Crown, Since also the
English did in the year 1672. when the States General of the United Provinces,
were Invaded, in a most Injust war, use their uttermost Endeavors to put an
end to that War, and that in opposition to those who were then in the
Government: and by their so doing, they run the hasard, of losing, both the
favor of the Court, and their Employments; And since the English Nation has
ever testified a most particular Affection and Esteem, both to pur Dearest
Consort the Princess, and to Our selves, WE cannot excuse our selves from
espousing their Interests, in a matter of such high Consequence, and from
Contributing all that lies in us, for the Maintaining both of the Protestant
Religion, and of the Laws and Liberties of those Kingdoms, and for the
Securing to them, the Continual Enjoyment of all their just Rights. To the
doing of which, we are most Earnestly Solicited by a Great many Lords, both
Spiritual and Temporal, and by many Gentlemen and other subjects of all Ranks.

THEREFORE it is, that we have thought fit, to go over to England, and to
Carry over with us a force, sufficient by the blessing of God, to defend us
from the Violence of those Evil Councillors. AND WE being desirous that our
Intentions in this, may be Rightly Understood, have for this end prepared this
Declaration, in which as we have hitherto given a True Account of the Reasons
Inducing us to it, So we now think fit to DECLARE that this our Expedition, is
intended for no other Design, but to have a free and lawful Parliament
assembled, as soon as is possible: and that in order to this, all the late
Charters by which the Elections of Burgesses are limited contrary to the
Ancient custom, shall be considered as null and of no force: and likewise all
Magistrates who have been Injustly turned out, shall forthwith resume their
former Employments, as well as all the Borroughs of England shall return again
to their Ancient Prescriptions and Charters: And more particularly that the
Ancient Charter of the Great and famous City of London, shall again be in
Force: and that the Writts for the Members of Parliament shall be addressed to
the Proper Officers, according to Law and Custom. That also none be suffered
to choose or to be chosen Members of Parliament but such as are qualified by
Law: And that the Members of Parliament being thus lawfully chosen they shall
meet and sit in Full Freedom; That so the Two Houses may concur in the
preparing of such Laws, as they upon full and free debate, shall Judge
necessary and convenient, both for the confirming and executing the Law
concerning the Test and such other Laws as are necessary for the Security and
Maintenance of the Protestant Religion; as likewise for making such Laws as
may establish a good aggreement between the Church of England, and all
Protestant Dissenters, as also for the covering and securing of all such, who
will live Peaceably under the Government as becomes good Subjects, from all
Persecution upon the account of their Religion, even Papists themselves not
excepted; and for the doing of all other things, which the Two Houses of
Parliament shall find necessary for the Peace, Honor, and Safety of the
Nation, so that there may be no more danger of the Nations falling at any time
hereafter, under Arbitrary Government. To this Parliament we will also refer
the Enquiry into the birth of the Pretended Prince of Wales, and of all things
relating to it and to the Right of Succession.

And We for our part will concur in every thing, that may procure the Peace
and Happiness of the Nation, which a Free and Lawful Parliament shall
determine; Since we have nothing before our eyes in this our undertaking, but
the Preservation of the Protestant Religion, the Covering of all men from
Persecution for their Consciences, and the Securing to the whole Nation the
free enjoyment of all their Laws, Rights and Liberties, under a Just and
Legal Government.

This is the design, that we have Proposed to our selves, in Appearing upon
this occasion in Arms: In the Conduct of which, We will keep the Forces under
our Command, under all the Strictnes of Martial Discipline: and take a
special Care, that the People of the Countries through which we must march,
shall not suffer by their means: and as soon as the State of the Nation will
admit of it, We promise that we will send back all those Foreign Forces,
that we have brought along with us.

We do therefore hope that all People will judge rightly of us, and approve
of these our Proceedings: But we chiefly rely on the blessing of God, for the
success of this our undertaking, in which We place our whole and only
Confidence.

We do in the last place invite and require all Persons whatsoever, All the
Peers of the Realm, both Spiritual and Temporal, all Lords Lieutenants,
Deputy Lieutenants, and all Gentlemen, Citisens and other Commons of all ranks,
to come and assist us, in order to the Executing of this our Design; against
all such as shall Endeavor to Oppose us; that so we may prevent all those
Miseries, which must needs follow upon the Nations being kept under Arbitrary
Government and Slavery: And that all the Violences and disorders, which have
overturned the whole Constitution of the English Government, may be fully
redressed, in a FREE AND LEGAL PARLIAMENT.

And We do likewise resolve that as soon as the Nations are brought to a
state of Quier, We will take care that a Parliament shall be called in
Scotland, for the restoring the Ancient Constitution of that Kingdom, and for
bringing the Matters of Religion to such a Setlement, that the people may live
easy and happy, and for putting an end to all the Injust Violences that have
been in a course of so many years Committed there.

We will also study to bring the Kingdom of Ireland to such a state, that the
Setlement there may be Religiously observed: and that the Protestant and
British Interest there, may be secured. And we will endeavor by all possible
means, to procure such an establishment in all the Three Kingdoms that they
may all live in a happy Union and Correspondence together; and that the
Protestant Religion, and the Peace, Honor, and Happiness of those Nations, may
be established upon Lasting Foundations.

His Highnesses Additionall Declaration.
AFter we had prepared and printed this our Declaration, we have understood,
that the subverters of the Religion and Laws of those Kingdoms, hearing of
our Preparations, to assist the People against them, have begun to retract some
of the Arbitrary and Despotick powers, that they had assumed, and to vacate
some of their Jujust Judgments and Decrees. The sense of their Guilt, and the
distrust of their force, have induced them to offer to the City of London some
seeming relief from their Great Oppressions: hoping thereby to quiet the
People, and to divert them from demanding a Secure Reestablishment of their
Religion and Laws under the shelter of our Arms: They do also give out that
we Intend to Conquer and Enslave the Nation, And therefore it is that we have
thought fit to add a few words to our Declaration.

We are Confident, that no persons can have such hard thought of us, as to
Imagine that we have any other Design in this Undertaking, then to procure a
setlement of the Religion and of the Liberties and Properties of the subjects
upon so sure a foundation, that there may be no danger of the Nations relapsing
into the like miseries at any time hereafter. And as the forces that we have
brought along with us, are utterly disproportioned to that wicked design of
Conquering the Nation, if we were Capable of Intending it, so the Great
Numbers of the Principal Nobility and Gentry, that are men of Eminent Quality
and Estates, and persons of known Integrity and Zeal both for the Religion and
Government of England, many of them being also distinguished by their Constant
fidelity to the Crown, who do both accompany us in this Expedition, and have
earnestly solicited us to it, will cover us from all such Malicious
Insinuations: For it is not to be imagined, that either those who have Invited
us, or those that are already come to assist us, can join in a wicked attempt
of Conquest, to make void their own lawful Titles to their Honors, Estates
and Interests: We are also Confident that all men see how little weight there
is to be laid, on all Promises and Engagments that can be now made: since there
has been so little regard had in time past, to the most solemn Promises. And as
that Imperfeit redress that is now offered, is a plain Confession of those
Violations of the Government that we have set forth, So the Defectivenes of it
is no less Apparent: for they lay down nothing which they may not take up at
Pleasure: and they reserve entire and not so much as mentioned, their claims
and pretenses to an Arbitrary and Despotick power; which has been the root of
all their Oppression, and of the total subversion of the Government. And it is
plain, that there can be no redress nor Remedy offered but in Parliament: by a
Declaration of the Rights of the Subjects that have been invaded: and not by
any Pretended Acts of Grace, to which the extremity of their affairs has driven
them. Therefore it is that we have thought fit to declare, that we will
refer all to a Free Assembly of the Nation, in a Lawful Parliament.

October in the year of our Lord 1688. WILLIAM HENRY, PRINCE OF ORANGE. By his
Highnesses special Command C: HUYGENS.
