I Loved no King in Forty One,
When Prelacy went down;
A Cloak and Band, I then put on,
And Preached against the Crown.

That Cants to Admiration;
And Prays for any King, to gain
The Peoples Approbation.

From Pop'ry to refine 'em;
And taught the People to serve God,
As if the Devil were in 'em.

And so became a Courtier.

And found there was no harm in it;

With Honesty or Evil;

Pray for his Foes Confusion;
And shall remain a Williamite,
