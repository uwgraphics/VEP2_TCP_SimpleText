Valiant Monmouth REVIVED. Or, an account of Young JEMMY's great Victory in his
last Engagement with the French.
To an Excellent New French Tune, Sung at the Duke's Playhouse.
WHen out of England we did go,
Into Flanders, if you would know,
And in Ostend for to lie,
Because the French were got so nigh.
Fa la, fa la, fa la, fa la.
But when in that Garrison we did lie,
Then on the Straw most pitifully,
Which caused many a brave Soldier to dye.
With a fa la, etc.
At length an order there did come,
That to the French we must be gone,
With Fife and Drum we march along.
Fa la, etc.
But when from Ostend we did march,
With merry looks and cheerful Voice,
Against the French that was so strong,
So cheerfully we march along,
Fa, la, etc.
But when to Antwerp we came nigh,
Aboard of the Bilinders we did hie,
And there we was forced all night to lie.
Fa la, etc.
But when at Brussels we drew near,
We heard the French they had been there,
But that was so strong they could do no good there.
Fa la, etc.
Ten days and more we did them pursue,
Thinking of their Army to take our view,
But they away from us did fly,
Not caring for our Company.
Fa la, etc.
At Charleroy we sound them out,
And there we gave them such a damnable rout,
That they were forced to wheel about,
Fa la, etc.
The Duke of Monmouth most Valiantly,
Rode foremost of our whole Army,
And he brought us again where the French did lie.
Fa la, etc.
Saying cheer up, my Hearts of Gold,
For in England it never shall be told,
That ever our English Boys did fly,
But all resolved for to dye.
Fa la, etc.
Seven hours and more we did them fight,
Till at the last we put them to the flight,
But it was so late that we lost them that night.
Fa la, etc.
Ten thousand French on the ground did lie,
Besides what was wounded mortally:
There we left them to remain
Until we did return again.
Fa la, etc.
But the Dutch most Cowardly,
Behind our Backs all day did lie,
And would not bear up for company.
Fa la, etc.
On the next morning by break of day,
We drew up our selves in Battle array,
But the Dutch got all the Plunder away,
That the English had fought for all the day.
Fa la, etc.
But the French most cunningly,
All night within a Wood did lie,
And marched away most privately.
Fa la, etc.
Fifteen Pieces of Ordnance we took that day,
That they against our Bodies did play,
And the Prince of Orange has them to this day.
Fa la, etc.
And now the Holland Wars is done,
Every English man to his own home;
Where we will drink good Ale and Beer,
And with our Friends will keep the New Year.
Fa la, fa la, fa la, fa la, fa la, fa la, fa la.
LONDON, Printed for Absalon Chamberlain, 1684.
