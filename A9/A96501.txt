A CALL TO ALL THE SOLDIERS OF THE ARMY, BY THE FREE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.

1. JUSTIFYING THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE FJVE REGJMENTS. 2. Manifesting the
necessity of the whole ARMIES joining with them, in all their faithful
endeavors, both for removing of all Tyranny and oppression, chiefly TITHES and
EXCISE, and establishing the just liberties and peace of this Nation. 3.
Discovering (without any respect of persons) the chief Authors, contrivers and
increasers of all our miseries, especially the new raised hypocrites, by whose
treacherous practices, all the just intentions and actions of the ADJUTATORS
and other well minded Soldiers, have been made fruitless.
Isaiah 58.6. Is not this the fast that I have chosen? To loose the bands of
wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and
that ye break every yoke?

Mat. 23.27, 28. Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hipocrites; for ye are
like unto whited Sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are
within full of dead men's bones, and all uncleanness.

Even so, ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full
of hypocrisy and iniquity.

Printed in the Year 1647.

TO THOSE FIVE REGJMENTS OF THE ARMY, WHO HAVE already declared themselves to
stand for maintenance of our just liberties, and for removal of those heavy
oppressions, mentioned in that worthy discourse, entitled, THE CASE OF THE
ARMY: AND To all, who intend to join timely and speedily with them.
YE, true lovers of Justice and the Commonwealth, the work which ye have
undertaken, is so just and necessary, that ye cannot but be exceedingly
comforted in the very thoughts thereof, ye have Justice and necessity on your
side, which will powerfully draw all free-principled men of all estates and
conditions unto you, nor can ye fail of good success, unless contrary to the
will and mind of God, who has moved your hearts, and raised you to this so
excellent, eminent and needful a work, ye give ear in aniwise to the
Syrene-songs of flatterers, temporizers, neuters and hypocrites.

As for martiall-force, we know you to be of such und anted courage, fidelity
and valor, as that ye will incur no danger in that kind, but what ye may
easily prevent and avoid, if ye be so wise, provident and circumspect as we
hope; besides, ye may be consident, that no just man's conscience will suffer
him to oppose you; and as for the unjust, God has made them as chafe before
you.

Take heed of crafty politicians and subtle Machivelians, and be sure to trust
no man's painted words, it being high time now to see actions, yea, and those
constantly upright too; if any man (by bringing forth unexpected bitter fruits)
has drawn upon himself a just suspicion, let him justly bear his own blame,
such a one is no more to be trusted whatsoever be pretended, until he as far
exceed others, as he has come short, in prosecution of your just ends and
purposes.

One of the surest marks of deceivers, is to make fair, long and eloquent
speeches, but a trusty or true-hearted man studieth more to do good actions,
then utter deceitful orations; and one of the surest tokens of confederates in
evil, is not only when one of his fellows is vehement, fiery or hot in any o^
^h^ir pursuits, to be patient, cold or moderate to pacify his partner, and like
deceitful Lawyers before their Cliants to quallify matters; but sometimes
seem to discord or fall out, and quarrel in Councels, reasonings and debates;
and yet nevertheless in the end to agree in evil; which they do purposely,
to hold upright men in a charitable (though doubtful) opinion, that if such
and such a man be not godly and upright, they know not whom in the world to
trust, whiles in the mean time, under the vizards of great professions, gilded
with some religious actions, they both deceive the world, and bring their
wicked designs and selfe-interests to pass.

Those of you, that use your thursday general-Councels of late, might have
observed so much of this kind of juggling, false-hood and double dealing, as
might have served to some good use at this point of extremity, but truly most
that have been there have been deluded, to our great grief; which appears
by the unreasonable proceedings of that Court; as in many things, so especially
in their debates about the aforesaid Case of the ARMY, now published and
subscribed by you.

Wherein though the General was so ingenuous, as to move for the public
reading thereof, yet the Commissary General Ireton, and Lieutenant General
Cromwell, yea, and most of the Court, would and did proceed to censure and
judge both it and the Authors and promoters thereof, without reading it, and
ever since do impudently boast and glory in that their victory.

It is very wonderful, that such understanding men, should so soon fall in^^
the same pernicious courses of those late impeached fugitives, their
predecessors, Hollis and Stapleton, seeming to account all other men mere
fools but themselves; and because they were able to carry al things (as it
were with a strong stream) in the House according to their own wills, they
thought that either all other men abroad were blind, or must necessarily be of
their mind: but as they were in some degree, so will these in a greater
measure, be taught some new lessons of better manners; and in Gods own time,
will be forced also to acknowledge, that a sincere conscience will bear out in
the day of trial, when a wounded conscience (with wicked acts and false
tricks) will bewray guiltiness, and make the party odious.

In the Council they held forth to you, the bloody Flagge of threats and
terrous, talked of nothing but Faction, dividing principles, Anarchy, of
hanging punishing, yea, and impudently maintained that your Regiments were
abused, and the aforesaid Case, not truly subscribed, and did appoint a
Committee Ad terrorem; and abroad they hold forth the white-flag of
accommodation and satisfaction, and of minding the same thing which ye mind,
and to be flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone; and to invite you to
their headquarters, where they hope either to work upon you, as they have
most lamentably done upon others, even to betray your trust, confound both your
understandings and Councels, corrupt your judgments, and blast your actions;
and though they should not prevail with you, yet there they keep so great a
state and distance, that they suppose ye will not dare to make good the things
yeee have published.

But if ye be as wise as ye had need, keep both from thence altogether, and
as much at a distance from these pretended friends, as ye did once from open
enemies; believe it (if ye please) ye may as well hazard at Hampton Court as
where they are, for the King and they are become one, as by the ensuing
discourse is made manifest.

If ye do adventure to go thither, beware that ye be not frighted by the
word ANARCHY, unto a love of Monarchy, which is but the gilded name for
Tyranny; for Anarchy had never been so much as once mentioned amongst you, had
it not been for that wicked end; it is an old threadbare trick of the profane
Court, and does amongst discreet men show plainly who is for the Court, and
against the liberties the people, who, when soever they positively insist for
their just freedoms, are immediately flap't in the mouths with these most
malignant reproaches, O, ye are for Anarchchy, ye are against all Government,
ye are Sectaries, sedicious persons, troublers both of Church and State, and
so not worthy to live in a Commonwealth; there shall be a speedy course taken
both against you and such as you: Away with all such from Parliament doors and
headquarters.

And if ye can escape these delusions, as through Gods assistance (we trust)
ye will, and not be satisfied with half or quarter remedies, or things
holding a shadow only of good, without the substance, we cannot in the least,
doubt of your good success, being firmly resolved to stand by you, and to live
and die with you.

Ye had need to be well armed and fortified against the devices that will be
put upon you, Ireton (ye know) has already scandalized the Case of the Army in
the general counsel where, by his own, and his confederats craft and policy,
he reigns as sole master, in so much as those friends ye have there (which
we hope, ye will see in dew time not to be few) find it to little purpose to
show them selves active in opposing him: and as he undertook, so has he
answerdy your Case, wherein he shows himself so full of art and cunning
smooth delusion (being skilled in nothing more) that if ye did not censibly
know the things to be really and experimentally true, which ye have therein
expressed and published, it is ten to one but he would deceive you.

This is certain, in the House of Commons, both he and his Father Cromwell,
do so earnestly and palpably carry on the Kings design, that your best
friends there are amazed thereat, and even ready to weep for grief to see such
a sudden and dangerous alteration; and this they do in the name of the whole
Army, certifying the House, that if they do not make further address to the
King, they cannot promise that the Army will stand by them; if they should find
opposition; and what is this, but as much in effect, as in the name of the
whole Army, to threaten the House into a compliance with the King your most
deadly enemy, and who if things go on thus, will deceive both you and them,
yea, and all that act most for him?

To what purpose then should you either debate, confer or treat, with such
false sophisters, or treacherous deceivers as these, who like the former
Courtiers can always play the hypocrites, without any check of conscience? To
what end should ye read, or spend time, to consider what they either write or
speak, it being so evident that as they did intend, so they proceed to hold
you in hand till their work be done?

But if you will show your selves wise, stop your ears against them; resist
the Devil and he will fly from you: hold not par lee with them, but proceed
with that just work ye have so happily begun, without any more regarding one
word they speak, for their consciences being at liberty to say or do any thing
which may advance their own ends, they have great advantage against you, whose
consciences will not permit you to say or do any thing but what is just and
true, and what ye mean to perform, they having shamfully proved themselves to
be large promisers, thereby to deceive both you and all the people, but the
worst performers that ever lived.

And therefore, certainly, ye have no warrant from God to treat either with
them or their deceitful instruments, who will be speedily (in great numbers)
sent amongst you; but as ye know most of them for evil, so are ye to avoid
them, as the most venomous Serpents: and faill not in this your just enterprise
to cast yor selves chiefly upon God in the use of all the knowledge,
experience, means and power wherewith he has furnished you; and secondly upon
the people, who will be ready with all their might and strength to assist you;
whilst ye are fathfull and real for them; join and be one with them in
heart and hand, with all possible speed in some substantial and firm
AGREEMENT, for just freedom and common right, that this nation may no longer
flote upon such wavering uncertain and sandy foundations of Government, which
have been one of the greatest causes both of all your, and our predicessors
miseries

Otherwise, if ye be not at a firm established certainty of all particulars
therein, conducing both to the prosperity and safety of the People, we see no
other remedy, but that now after all your victories, both ye and we will come
to live that dying life, even at the cruel mercies of most wicked Tyrants and
blood oppressors.

Thus ye may assure your selves, if ye now suffer your strength either to be
wronng or flattered out of your hands (though it be a most sad thing to speak)
before many months pass, both ye and we are like to be driven, yea, and
even glad to beg our bread; and why is it they keep you still so poor as
they have a long time done (to the great grief of us all) but that ye might
not be able to help or stir more then as many prisoners? Yea, they intend
when they are advanced to the hight of their preferment, that many both of you
and us, shall be whipped, or banished as Vagabons, starved in prisons, or hanged
on Gallowses by dosens, scores and hindreds, as thieves and murderers.

Therefore let the foresight and consideration of these sad rewards of all our
good services, which are fast hatching for us, make you wise and provident in
time, who have sufficient power with our assistance, to defend both your selves
and us; and the rather use all lawful means to prevent, then to be in any
wise forced to repent; work whilst it is called to day; the night comes on a
pace, even the blackness of darkness, of a most wicked accommodation, and
then no man can work: Up therefore and be doing what is just, and the Lord our
God will assist you, and we shall spend our lives and estates with you.

Farewell.
A CALL TO ALL THE SOLDIERS OF THE ARMY, by the free People of England.
FAITHFUL friends, ye and we have had so much experience of all sorts of men,
that if now we be any longer deceived, we are to complain of none but our
selves; for as concerning the King, ye know the whole time of his reign before
this Parliament, (...) time of most intolerable oppression, as his deferring
and (...) ^^^ng up of Parliaments, knighthood and loane-money, enfo^^^^^ent of
customs and impost, cruel and bloody censures in Sta^^ ^^mber and high
Commission, selling of Offices, bribery and exte^^^^^s in all Courts, extention
of lawsuits, multitudes of Pat^^^^ and projects, Ship Money, coat and conduct
money, innovation in Religion, and continual oppression of conscience.

And as his first war was made purposely to betray Rochell, (that ancient
Sanctuary of the Protestants) so now by the same his arbitrary power, he
raises a bloody war against his own native Country of Scotland, purposely
to betray and enslave both us and them; so that a verier tyrant then King
Charles, even when this Parliament began, was not living upon earth.

And our hopes (ye know) were very great, that this Parliament would have
punished him in the first place, as the chief author of our miseries; but so
it proved, that he no more abused his Office, then they instantly fell to abuse
their trust; and frustrate our hopes; for they let him alone, and fall only
upon his evil Counselors; by which treacherous means they gave him
opportunity to raise a war against the People, which ye full dearly know,
proved a very cruel and bloody one, to the destruction of many thousand worthy
men and families, all which seems too soon to be forgotten.

A great part of which time, the Parliament so managed the war as if they
intended merely to rob and spoil the People, by pilling and polling them with
variety of new devised taxes, especially with that unmercifull taxation of
EXCISE; which (like the disease called the woolfe) both eats the flesh and
sucketh the blood of the middle and poorer sort, and so to moold and fashion the
people, to bear such heavy burdens as the King should impose upon them, with
the less grudging and repining.

But in the very point of time, when both the Parliament and their Armies under
Essex and Manchester, had all shamefully betrayed their trusts, and that all
well-affected people were ready to be given up into his merciles hands, naked
and stripped of all their wealth and strength, even then, it pleased God by
undiscernable means, to raise the n^w modle and put power into your hands,
which we thankfully acknowledge, ye so faithfully, industriously and valiantly
employed, as soon curbed the peide and power of the King, and freed the land
from all his cruel and bloody forces.

Yet whiles ye were thus busy abroad for good, the Parliament and City do
confederate, and are as industrious at home for evil; as to admit none to bear
office of any trust or command, but such as would submit to the Covenant and
Presbytery; an Ordinance is brought into the House, and countenanced against
opinions in Religion, of a more bloody and dangerous consequence then any that
ever was in the high Commission; a Committee is appointed and exercised with
most vile parciallity, by Colonel Leigh and his accomplices, against godly
peaceable People, for preaching without their deceitful Cleargies Ordination;
the House of Lords imprison Commoners at their pleasure, Larner, Lilburne,
Overton, Tew and others, and the House of Commons approve thereof, and give up
the liberties of the people to any.

Their own Committees arbitrary commitments, and the violent behavior of their
own members are justified, whiles those whom they abuse, are upon false
suggestions unheard, imprisoned; and in conclusion, they blush not to burn
just Petitions by the common hangman.

Indeed, there were no end of reckoning up the innumerable treacheries, and
mischieveous practices of this your Parliament, their intolerable pride, and
covetous in-riching of themselves, their children and alliances, their
allowance of the oppressions of all Committees and Courts, that should be
courts of justice, but are indeed forges of oppression and injustice: And in
all these times, and amidst all businesses, what is there done for the people?
If in the beginning, they removed one oppression, (as if they repented
themselves) they have brought in two in place thereof; and ever and anon, their
grand Master the King, must be treated withal; his honor and authority (for
sooth) that ever sought most violently the ruin of you and us, must be
tendered, and have propositions sent to him, and the poor ignorant people must
be deluded by this Parliaments double dealing, as if all the peoples peace and
happiness depended only on him, who ever oppressed them to his utmost power:
All his plots to ruin the honest party in the Parliament and City, must not in
the least be laid either to his charge, nor almost to any others, but searcht'
into by halves and hudled up, like Deering, and Walers plots and the like; the
Earl of Manchesters teachery as foul as any, not so much as questioned.

And until the wickedness of the House of Commons came to such a mass, that
they had plotted your disbanding, and thereby gave you just cause to stand upon
your own guard, there appeared no hope, but that we and ye with all who had
al-waies stood for common freedom, against both Kingly, Lordly, and
Parliamentary tyranny, shoul'd have been made the objects of their scorn, and
subjects of their malice, and had ere this, been delivered up as slaves into
the cruel hands of the King their Master.

But God has put it into your hearts to take care both of your selves and us,
and by your wisdom and resolution wrought a mighty alteration: Ye of the
plainer sort, were thought by him who is only wise, to be the meetest
instruments for so great a work, and we are grieved, that those who were
raised by your valor to places of honor and greatness, should so soon despise
the way of the Lord, and should not still make use of you, in finishing the
work so happily begun.

Your Adjutators (we hear) are esteemed but as a burden to the chief Officers,
which we judge to be the reason, that all things now are in such a languishing
condition; our hopes die daily within us, and we fear ye will to soon give your
selves and us, with our joint and just cause, into their hands: Ye should have
considered, that they along time staggered, before they engaged with you, and
certainly had never engaged, but that they saw no other way nor means to
shelter and preserve themselves, from the power of Hollis and Stapleton with
their confederates.

We have now too much cause to fear, that your and our good, or the promoting
of the common freedom of the Nation, was the least part of their care or
intention; for they no sooner by your unanimous resolution, became Masters of
the King, Parliament and City, and thereby of a power to do whatsoever good,
was desirable either by you or us, but they wholly despise and neglect you; for
notwithstanding your joint engagement, and thereby your just power of voting
with them, in all things concerning the Army as an Army, or as members of the
commonwealth, they (at Branford or Hunslow) made an agreement with the
Parliament, without your knowledge or consent; and likewise, both against your
sound advice and their engagement, permit the usurpers of Parliament authority
to sit and vote in the House, not considering, or (at least) not regarding how
impossible it is, to promote the good of the people, to punish Delinquents, or
to bring any security to you or us, whilst they are there.

Ye persist never the less in your care of the common good, and urge again and
again, that these intruders be removed out of Parliament, and in the end
prevail with your chief officers, to present to the Parliament, and publish to
the world a Declaration, and therein a Protestation against their sitting
there, in very large and fit expressions; notwithstanding all which, these
corrupt and rotten members still retain their places, and the chief domineering
Officers of the Army, Cromwell and Ireton sit with them, without any endeavor
to dismiss them thence; and not only so, but seem insensible or regardlesse of
all the evil that has been done by them, in endeavoring to make a new war,
or to bring in the King, upon most unjust, unsafe, and unconscionable terms.

Surely we cannot but grieve to consider, how the Parliament have spent their
time since ye entered the City; the House of Lords still imprison Commoners
without control, Lilburne continues most unjustly and shamelesly a prisoner
in the Tower, and Manchester at liberty.

People from many Counties petition against the oppression of Tithes, without
any relief at all, but made more grieveous by a most unreasonable Ordinance;
the Assembly of Parsons continue sitting, to the great charge of the people,
whilst they hatch nothing but mischief.

No just nor equal way is ordered for due and timely payment of you in the
Army, but is omitted of set-purpose, that free quarter may make you odious, and
incens the people against you; and nothing is now so much minded by your
Officers and their Parliament, then how to please, satisfy and establish the
King, who hates both you and us with an inveterate hatered; and were your
Officers of the same mind they have sometimes been, he would hate them in the
like manner, but it appears, he by his insinuations has so wrought upon
their affections, that he and they seem to be of one heart, and of one mind, so
that all their care is to please him; and that they may do it the more
effectually (swallowing up their duty to God, their engagement with you, their
Declaration and protestation, with all the innocent blood that he has spilt)
they for his sake, forbear to clear the House, of so many of his trusty
friends, who in the countersiut Parliam. so vehemently endeavored his speedy
coming to London, where certainly your Officers earnestly desire to have him:
otherwise why are they so importunate (after his denial of the Propositions)
to present their weak and lame Proposals to the House, and so to prepare them,
or some result thereof to be sent to him for his agreement and consent? why
make they an Idol of him, and bear him up so high in the eyes and fancies of
the people, as if he were in there esteem, the very light of their eyes, and
the breath of their nostrels?

Why are they so familliar with Ashburnhame and other his chief agients? Why
permit they so many of his deceitful Clergy to continue about him? Why do
themselves kneel, and kiss, and fawn upon him? Why have they received
favors from him, and sent their wives or daughters to visit him, or to kiss
his hand, or be kissed of him?

Oh shame of men! Oh sin against God! What, to do thus to aman of blood; over
head and ears in the blood of your dearest friends and fellow Commoners? To
him that thirsts for your blood, yea, and theirs too, however they flatter
and befoole themselves. Hear oh Heavens, and regard oh earth, If this in these
exceed not the wickedness of the most wicked upon earth?

And think ye oh friends, to escape the severe judgment of Almighty God, who
by your silence and want of reproof of these things, give countenance
thereunto, for your officers durst not go on in these unworthy courses, but
that they presume upon you to back them: For alas, what are they without you,
but as so many single persons, ready to be hunted by all the great parties in
the land? So that ye are in effect, the abetters of all their evil courses,
the Bauds and Panders to their adulterate practices with the King; nor can ye
make amends for your so sinful neglect, but by a speedy impeachment of him,
and exemplary punishment of them, for their private tampering with him, who if
he were a politic tyrant when this Parliament began, how bloody a one has he
proved himself ever since?

We beseech you therefore, yea, we beg of you all Commanders and Soldiers,
that are yet untainted in your integrity, and have not yet bowed your knees to
Baal, that ye will not betray your selves, your just cause and us so
unworthily, nor seem to distrust that power and wisdom of God, by which ye
have done so great and mighty works; but that now ye will be bold and
courageous for your God and for his people, and for justice against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, without respect of persons.

And before it be to late deal plainly with Ireton, by whose cowardy or
ambicious policy, Cromwell is betrayed into these mischievous practices; and by
whose craft the power of your Adjutators is brought to nothing; and by whose
dissimulation many of them are corrupted, and become treacherous unto you; none
but flatterers, tale-bearers and turn-coats are countenanced by him: let him
know ye know him, and hate his courses; your general councels by his
imperious carriage, are like unto Star-chambers; a plain man is made an
offender for a word.

And if Cromwell instantly repent not, and alter his course, let him know also,
that ye loved and honored just, honest, sincere and valiant Cromwell, that
loved his Country, and the liberties of the people above his life, yea, and
hated the King as a man of blood, but that Cromwell ceasing to be such, he
cease to be the object of your love.

And since there is no remedy, ye must begin your work anew, ye are as ye were
at Bury, ye are no strangers to the way, ye have already made a good beginning,
wherein we rejoice, ye have men amongst you as fit to govern, as others to be
removed, AND WITH A WORD, YE CAN CREATE NEW OFFICERS, necessity has no law,
and against it there is no plea, the safety of the people is above all law; and
if ye be not very speedy, effectual, and do your work thoroughly, and not by
halves as it has been, ye and we perish inevitably.

What your General is ye best know, but it is to late to live by hopes, or to
run any more hazzards, none can deceive you but whom ye trust upon doubtful
terms; be ware of the flattery and sophistry of men: bargain with your
Officers, not to court it in fine or gaudy apparel, nor to regard titles,
fine fare or complements; those that do, are much more liable to temptations
then other men; a good conscience is a continual feast; and let your ourside
testify that ye delight not to be Soldiers, longer then necessity requires.

Draw your selves into an exact council, and get amongs you, the most
judicious and truest lovers of the people ye can find, to help you; and let
your end be justice without respect of persons, and peace and freedom to all
sorts of peaceable people, establish a free Parliament, by expulsion of the
usurppers: free the people from all burdens and oppressions speedily and
without delay; take an exact account of the public treasure, that public
charges may be defrayed by subsidees, Tithes abolished, the laws and
proceeeings therein regulated, and free quarter abandoned.

Let nothing deter you from this so just and necessary a work, none will
oppose you therein, or so long as ye continue sincere and uncorrupted; for all
sorts of people have been abused, Kings have abused them, Parliaments have
abused them, and your chief Officers have most grossly deceived the honest
party: be confident none will oppose, and be as confident, that thousands and
ten thousands are ready and ripe to assist you.

Be strong therefore, our dear true hearted brethren and fellow Commoners, and
be of good courage, and the Lord our God will direct you by his wisdom, who
never yet failed you in your greatest extremities; stay for no farther, look
for no other Call: for the voice of necessity is the Call of God; al other
ways for your imdemonity are but delusive, and if ye trust to any other,
under the fairest promises, ye will find your selves in a snare.

Whom can ye trust, who has not hitherto deceived you? Trust only to justice,
for God is a God of justice, and those that promote the same shall be
preserved; free the Parliament from those incendiaries with all your might; the
true and just patrion (yea, all but deceivers) therein long for your
assistance; and that being effectually done, ye may safely put your selves and
the whole Nation, upon them both for provision indemnity and just liberty.

In the mean time, let your friends that are about the King, be sure to keep
him, as they keep their lives, and not to part with him upon any terms, till
you can refer him to a free Parliament; if you do not this, but that any
agreement be now made with him, ye will find that in an instant, his Judges
and Lawyers, and Lords and Priests, will be your Judges, and what rebels ye
appear in their eyes both ye know, and some of your friends have already felt
sufficiently; a free Parliament therefore only can secure both you and us.

Let no policy, art or stratagem divide you in affection, or separate your
Regiments far distant from one another, for that must necessarily be your
unavoidable ruin; beware of Neuters, and such as have carried two faces under
one hood, hollow-hearted or aspiring men, such as Say Wharton, Fines, Vain,
St. John's, etc. the greatest deceivers this day living; above all harden not
your consciences by a custom in dissimulation, as some eminent professors
amongst you have lamentably done, as knowing that none are so hateful in the
sight of God as hipocrits.

Do what ye can to recover the credit of your Army, which has been betrayed
and lost, as shamefully as the public faith (both which deserve severe
punishments) for if once ye loose your reputation, ye will soon be but as a
mere shadow; therefore be very careful of keeping a good, upright and sincere
conscience before God, and then ye need not fear what men can do unto you.

But in these and all other things, the wisdom and goodness of God (we
trust) will be your guide, to lead you into all the paths of righteousness,
unto whose will and mind if ye carefully give care, ye shall certainly be
blessed in all your undertakings.

FINIS.
