An Extract of a Letterwritten from some Ministers of the Gospel to the Author
of the Exercitation or Vindication.
SIR,
WE bless God that has inclined your heart in your vacant hours (specially in
the sad time of Gods visitation) to appear for Jesus Christ, in a controversy
of so high concernment. As we cannot but acknowledge strength of parts in your
adversary, in his managing of so bad a cause; howsoever; streights (as it fares
with all in such engagements) put him upon contradictions; so we rejoice to see
your accurate diligence answered with such acuteness, that his wiles have no
lurking hole left to avoid the force of Truth in your Answer, -- We would fain
see that eldest son of Anak fall. The Lord in whose cause you engage, give an
happy success, etc.

To Master JOHN KNOWLES late Preacher at Chester.
SIR,
IT is reported of Valens Jubet Valens edictum de Basilio in exilium mittendo
conscribi, quod cum sua manu ratum facere conaretur, ne apicem quidem unum
alicujus literae facere potuit; siquidem ruptus est calamus, neque id semel sed
iterum ac tertio accidit. Ac cum impium illud Edictum confirmate impensius
laboraret, concussa est dextera, tremorque eum occupavit. Atque cum animo esset
prae metu prope attonito, chartam manibus dilaceravit. Theodor. Eccl. Hist. l.
4. c. 17.
(that Arrian Emperor) that as he was attempting to sign an Edict for the
banishing of Basil, he could not write one tittle of a Letter, Providence
breaking his Pen three several times; at the fourth assay his hand was stricken
with a shaking Palsy, and thereupon as a man affrighted with his own hands, he
tore in pieces the Paper. In this you might have imitated him, if the spirit of
horror had seized on you, when you first put Pen to paper to print your
conference with Master Eaton. Howsoever, you are beholding to free grace in
sparing you, who have not spared to rob Jesus Christ (as much as in you lies)
of his Deity. I have no leisure to reply to your whole book (though its
feasible, being for the most part but a Magazine of the rusty Armor of Arrius,
Samosatenus, Servetus, Socinus, Valentinus Gentiles, etc. scoured up and trimmed
anew) I have only pitched upon one Scripture, and the rather because you The
words I confess at the first blush seem to stand on your side. Confer. p. 11.
hint, it speaks most clearly for Master Eatons cause. And if (but) this one
Fort be maintained against your scaling Ladders, battering Pieces and powder
Mines, you have no great reason to cry VICTORIA (though you may be beaten off
from the rest too, notwithstanding your desperate assaults.) I have (according
to the advice of your High-flown Epistoler) studied to reason and not to
revile, especially you being so much as by face unknown to me. Beseeching you
to draw (with an unbyassed judgment and an unbrib'd affection) your own
Conference p. 30. f.
rule into Act: Betake your self to reason, whereby the spirit may convince you
of WHOM the text under Examination is to be understood. Let all be taken by
you, as tendered by me, with a spirit of love and meekness. And the Lord give
you the Spirit of a sound mind and understanding in all things, which is the
Cordial prayers of him who is

Yours if you be indeed for Christ, T. P.

AN EXERCITATION On 1 JOHN 5. 10. This is the true God and eternal life.
THese words relate not to the Son but to the Mr. Knowls p. 11. Sect. 1.
Father only. For 1. If we consider those words, as an entire body of
themselves, not having dependence on the words immediately preceding, as
probably they have not, being by a full point separated from them, then they
are the Epitome, Abridgment, or Sum of the whole Epistle. And so the Apostles
mind seems to be this: This father which I have in this my Epistle treated of,
is the true God; and this Jesus Christ of whom I have spoken, and in whom ye
have believed, is eternal life, i.e. the way to it.

1. Sir consider, how you can acquit your self from the Reply.
guilt of two contradictions. 1. These words relate to the father -- AS AN
ENTIRE body of themselves. Are the same words in the same respect, absolute and
not absolute, relative and not relative? is not here an implicit contradiction?
2. You say, line 10, 11. The words relate not to the Son, but to the Father
only; And yet you say, line 20. These words, viz. eternal life are spoken of
Jesus Christ. Is not here an explicit contradiction? For if the words which you
call an Epitome, etc. relate in whole or in part to the Son Jesus Christ, then
not to the Father ONLY.

2. Consider whether you have observed the rule Deuteronomy. 4. 1. with 12. 32.
of not adding to the word, when you say, This Father, -- and THIS Jesus Christ
is eternal life. I am sure that term THIS is but once mentioned in the text
under debate, and that only in the beginning, not in the middle of the
sentence. Indeed Quaerat hic aliquis annon liceat addere verbo dei Glossas sive
Declarationes. Resp. licet; Dummodo illae sint consentaneae verbo Dei scripto,
and genuinum Scripturae sensum, ex ipsa sententiarum cohaerentia and collatione
Scripturae milium locorum aperiant. Pisc. in lec. Obs. 2.
Piscator moves a question, whether it be lawful to add a Gloss or Exposition
to the Word written, and answers affirmatively with this Caution, That it be
agreeable to the Word, and that it opens the genuine sense of Scripture, etc.
Which whether it be observed by you, let the learned judge, when both Parties
are heard fully. Your crude expressions could not be pretermitted without such
(rude yet) just Animadversions.

3. The reducing of this your answer into an argument, will be sufficient to
discover its vanity and weakness, as you be speak Master Eaton. p. 51.

The Epitome, etc. of this whole Epistle relates to the Father only. But these
words: This is the true God and eternal life are such an Epitome -- Therefore
--

Sir, (not to repeat the forenamed contradictions) you (your self being judge,)
cannot but condemn the major of palpable falsehood, and if you would assay to
prove it, (to use your own phrase) would be an endless labor. Your Minor is
of the same stamp. For in all reason the last, verse. 20. (Babes keep your
selves from idols) should be a part of the Epitome, (if there be any suchthing)
of the whole Epistle, specially consisting of (Agenda as well as Credenda)
Practical as well as Doctrinal matter.

But how prove you the Minor? Because (say you) they are as an entire body of
themselves, not depending on the words immediately preceding. Is this all? Sir,
your major employed is false, (viz.) The words which are, As an entire body of
themselves -- are the Epitome of this Epistle; For, are the words mentioned in
the last verse an Epitome of the whole Epistle? which yet are as an entire body
of themselves, etc. and do they therefore relate to the Father only? But how
prove you that these words under examination, are an entire body of themselves,
not having dependence on the words immediately foregoing? Its probable (you
say) because they are by a full point separated from them.

But Sir, must probabilities pass for proofs? and Criticisms for Syllogisms?
Among sundry instances (even in this chapter, to go no further) I shall cull
out one or two, which I fairly present to your serious consideration. Its said
ver. 3. -- And his Commandments are not grievous: These words are by a full
point separated (in the Greek) from the words immediately preceding, yet must
needs have dependence on them, as evidently appears by the (...).
Relative HIS. Again ver. 7. its said -- And these three are one; Which words
are so separated (yet its as clear as the Sun, that) they depend on the words
immediately foregoing, viz. The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. Again it is
said, v. 9. -- For this is the witness of God. -- These words also are
separated by a full point, and yet they have dependence on the words
immediately preceding, as is manifest by the Conjunction (...).
FOR, and the Relative THIS, yea in this very ver. 20. -- And we are in him
that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. These words are also separated by
a full point; yet (if you adhere to Erasmus or Tindals reading, and your own
gloss thereupon) they must have dependence on the words immediately foregoing.
You may (if you please) peruse the chapter, and so be an eyewitness of more
instances; and you may more probably conclude, that though these words are by a
full point separated from the words immediately preceding, yet they have a
dependence on them. If all this will not leave a conviction on your spirit, may
I not say with the Apostle in another case, James 2. 4.
Are you not then partial in your self?

You have been unhappy in your first Answer; sure you will be more successeful
in the second, which runs thus.

2. Were it granted, that these words, (This is the true God, etc.) do depend
on the foregoing words: yet will it Mr. Knowles Sect. 2.
not follow of necessity, that the Son, not the Father is the antecedent to the
Relative THIS, and so that the sentence must be thus understood, This Son is
the true God. In the precedent words there is mention made of the Father, And
we know that the Son of God is come, i.e. we believers assuredly know that the
Son of God is already come in the flesh, notwithstanding many at this time
gainsay and deny it; And has given us an understanding that we may know him
that is true, i.e. and this Jesus Christ being in the bosom of the Father, and
having received from him the promise of the Spirit; has anointed the eyes of
our minds that we might savingly know him, i.e. the true God, as some Greek
Copies have it, And we are in him that is true etc. -- If with Erasmus and
Tindal we read the words, thus, And we are in him that is true through his Son
Jesus Christ; the meaning is this, we have not only apprehension of, but also
union and Communion with him who is the true God, by the means of his Son Jesus
Christ; but if we follow Piscator, the words hold out that Omnes, and
fellowship which the Saints have with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ; for
thus he would have them read; And we are in him that is true; (to wit the
Father) and in his Son Jesus Christ. But last of all, if we consent with
Hierom, who by making a redundant, has them thus; False; for he reads thus,
And we are in his true Son.
And we are in this true Son Jesus Christ. Now the words that follow, relate to
the Father, This is the true God, and the Apostle intends the Father.

Sir, me thinks I see you here like a bird in a net, hopping and fluttering to
get out; but all in vain. For Reply.


1. If by the foregoing words, you mean immediately preceding (as in your first
answer) it will and does of NECESSITY follow, that the Son, not the Father, is
the Antecedent to the Relative THIS. Weigh well the Argument.

If the words (This is the true God) depend on the words immediately foregoing,
then the Son and not the Father is the Antecedent to the Relative This. But
these words (This is the true God) depend on the words immediately foregoing.
Therefore --

The Major is undeniable, unless a man will deny snow to be white. The Minor
you seem to grant, and so yield the cause. If not, I pray you tell me which are
the words immediately foregoing the Relative THIS? Are not these words, Jesus
Christ? Look on the Original, our English Translation, or any of the three
Versions mentioned by you, and its evident there is nothing but a full point
(as you say) between the words Jesus Christ, and the Relative THIS.

2. I know not to what purpose you mention three several readings, and three
several meanings accordingly, unless it be to cast a mist before your Readers
eyes (as they say, the fish Polypus does cast out a black humor) thereby to
escape; you fix not on any of these readings or meanings. Orthodox Divines
maintain it for a truth against Papists, Revera unicus duntaxat uniuscujusque
loci Sacrae Scripturae sensus est. Alsteds Praecog. Theol. l. 2. c. 100. Vide
Ames. Prolegom. in Psalm. 2. and Chamier. Panstrat. Cath. De Scripturae sensu l.
5. c. 1. and 2 It. Rivet. Isagog. ad Scripturam sacram. c. 14.
There is but one sense of Scripture. I know several men give several meanings
of one and the same place of Scripture, and its difficult to determine which is
the genuine; but this is to be imputed to the Relics of darkness in man's
understanding, since the fall of Adam. The Scripture sure is no Nose of wax.

But to the Authority of Erasmus and Tindal I oppose (with Zanch. detribus
clohim; pars altera. l. 3. c. 6.
Zanchius) the Authority of all the Fathers almost, and of the Church of God,
who read and understand the words as we do, For if that of Erasmus -- be
current, it should be (...), not (...), through, not in his Son; -- To the
Authority of Piscator I oppose the Authority of Oecumenius, who has collected
the Fathers sentences and sense too on the text, making the latter clause
exegetical to the former. Neither can you with reason consent with Hierom (I
suppose you mean the old Latin Translation, which is doubted, nay denied by
the learned Rivet. Isag. c. 11. Chamier. de vulg. Lat. editione l. 24. c. 4. s.
7. etc.
to be Hieroms) for if of two Prepositions one is redundant (...).
, then of two articles one is redundant also, (which is somewhat uncouth) and
perhaps the Relative too, or else miserably perverted, for its not in THIS Son,
but in HIS Son.

3. Its either an untrue or an improper expression to say in the precedent
words there is mention made of the Father; for the word MENTION does not
signify an implicit intimation, but an explicit nomination. You say p. 10. no
mention made of any other nature in the man Christ. But I say its employed in
Isa. 46. Review also your p. 15. Pos. 1. and p. 39.
e. g. Heb. 11. 22. Joseph made MENTION of the departing of the children of
Israel, -- what kind of mention that was, you may read, Genesis 50. 24, 25.
Therefore elsewhere, the term BY NAME is added exegetically, Josh. 21. 9. 1 Chronicles. 4. 38. I grant the Father is employed, (because of the Relative -- Son)
but the Father is not mentioned (to speak properly and truly) in the precedent
words; but this by the By, let it go.

4. Compare head and foot of this your answer, and I Petitio Principii, idem
per idem.
am much mistaken if you do not shamefully beg the question, and too
confidently assert, the Apostle intends the Father. Sir, is not this ((...))
the thing controverted and to be proved?

But because this assertion (the Apostle intends the Father only) Mr. Knowles
Sect. 3.
is contrary to many men's interpretation, take for the backing of it these few
reasons.

Sir, you might have said EVERY man's interpretation Reply.
saving old and new Opposers of Christ's Deity. I hope you are not like Ishmael,
Genesis 16. 12.
whose hand will be against every man, -- not like those Jews mentioned, 1
These. 2. 14. 15. who were contrary to all men. There is a singularity which is
a shrewd sign of Arrogance. 2. If your Assertion be contrary to ALL, MOST or
MANY men's interpretation, you have need not only of many but strong reasons,
for the backing of it and flanking of it too. 3. No matter (I confess) how
few, but how strong reasons are. I would not take reasons Nonnumero sed pondere.
by number, but by weight. Let it therefore appear what strength or weight is
in your reasons, as you call them.

Reas. 1. Because the text will Grammatically bear it; for Mr. Knowles Sect. 4.
the words may be thus rendered, That is the true God, and so the Antecedent to
the Relative is not the person immediately foregoing, which is Jesus Christ,
but another spoken of at a further distance, to wit the Father.

1. Sir your skill in Grammar is not so great as your Reply.
skill in Logic seems to be. Calvin says, Relativum (...) ad PROXIMAM
Personam restringi solet. Calv. loc.
the Relative THIS is wont to be restrained to the next person, i.e. To the
person immediately foregoing, which is Jesus Christ, and not to another spoken
of at a further distance, to wit the Father. Beza says, Pronominis istius
propria significatio postulat ut ad Christum hoc referatur. Beza Annot. in loc.
The proper signification of this Pronoun, requires that THIS be referred unto
Christ, Zanchius says, Ad PROXIMUM membrum referendum esse Pronomen (...)
Grammatica docet. Zanch. loc. praedict.
GRAMMAR teaches, that the Pronoun THIS is to be referred to the next number.
To name no more, I suppose these or any of these eminent Ministers of the
Gospel were as good Grammarians as Master KNOWLES.

2. You allege not one place of Scripture, wherein the Relative THIS is
rendered THAT. If you could, you would not (I suppose) have left it so naked
without arms in the open field. What? must we take again your word for proof?
I wish a better, for there is no goodness in that. I hope Sir, you will take
the language which you bestow on Mr. Eaton, p. 51.

3. Its more then probable, it ought not to be rendered THAT; for even in this
Epistle, its an eleven times translated THIS (beside this text in hand) and so
always to my best observation in the Gospel of John. Now if this be the proper
signification of the Relative THIS, and so used constantly by the Apostle in
his Gospel and Epistle; ought it not to be so rendered here?

4. Its said John 1. 20. This is he of whom I said, etc. Also 1 John 5. 6. This
is he that came by water and blood. -- Would it not be a silly shift to say the
Apostle intends the Father, because the text will Grammatically bear it? For
may not the words be thus rendered? THAT IS, etc. -- when he that has but half
an eye may see, that not the Father, but Jesus Christ is the Antecedent to the
Relative.

5. You say the words MAY be thus rendered, THAT IS the true God. If you mean De
posse, who denies it? your subtle (but unsound) wit can do it and has done it;
If de jure, I deny it on the former grounds.

6. What an absurd illogical and Atheological argument is this? If the words
may be thus rendered -- then the Apostle intends the Father. But the words may
be thus rendered -- Therefore --

Sir, you may perceive the weakness of the Minor by weighing the Premises.
Your Major or Consequence I deny; for the translation of the words can never
sufficiently prove the intention of the Apostle.

Reas. 2. Because Jesus Christ nowhere in Scripture is Mr. Knowles Sect. 5.
called the true God, and therefore is it the more questionable whether he be
so called here; the place being somewhat doubtful and ambiguous.

Somewhat doubtful and ambiguous; to whom Sir? Reply.
Not to Beda, Quid apertius hic verbis? quid dulcius? -- Verum Deum dixerat
esse filium, verum Deum HUNC esse multoties repetit. Bed. loc.
who says, What is more plain then these words? what is more sweet? -- He
(viz. the Apostle) calls the Son of God the true God, -- he repeats it over and
over again, This is the true God; nor to Calvin, who says Tamersihunc locum
eludere ARRIANI conati sunt, and illis hodie subscribunt QuIDAM; Hic tamen
insigne habemus Divinitatis Christi Elogium. Calv. loc.
Although the Arrians have endeavored to elude this place, and some at this
day subscribe to them, yet here we have a notable proof of Christ's Divinity.
Nor to Beza, Continet etiam hic locus EXPRESSVM Divinitatis Christi
testimonium, Beza. in loc. and Piscat.
who says, This place contains an express testimony of Christ's Divinity.
Nor to Zanchius, who says, Hic APERTE Apostolus Christum vocat verum Deum --
Locus est insignis ad asserendam Christi Divinitatem. Zanc. loc. Praedict. 1.
Here the Apostle clearly calls Christ the true God. -- -- A notable place to
prove the true and eternal Deity of Jesus Christ. But is the place doubtful and
ambiguous to your self? I do not believe it, because of your mincing the
matter, being SOMEWHAT doubtful -- I cannot but think, in writing this your
heart checked your hand. The place is plain; he that runs may read it; The
water is clear enough if the Elephant would not mud it. But your second reason
shall now be examined; Which is this; Jesus Christ is no where in Scripture
called the true God.

1. Sir, Many things are so and so, though not called so in Scripture; to say
nothing of the Christian Sabbath which is nowhere in Scripture called Sunday,
is it no' therefore Sunday? or may it not be so called by us, as well as by
Diodate, 1 Cor. 16. 2. and Justin Martyr, (...), etc, SOLIS DIE communiter
omnes conventum agimus. Just. Martyr. Apol. 2.
that most ancient and incorrupt Writer, as learned Gomarus De investigatione
Sab. c. 6. s. 39.
styles him? But Baptism and the Lords Supper are nowhere in Scripture called
Sacraments; are they not therefore Sacraments? 2. Nowhere in Scripture it is
said there are only two Sacraments of the New Testament; Are there any more? or
therefore are there not only two Sacraments of the new Testament? 3. The whole
Church of Christ is nowhere in Scripture called Catholic; is there not
therefore a Catholic Church? Though the term is not, yet the thing is in
Scripture, Ephesians. 3. 15, Of whom the whole Family in heaven and earth is named.
4. Christ's death is nowhere in Scripture called satisfactory or meritorious; is
it not therefore satisfactory or meritorious? 5. A sinners justification is
nowhere in Scripture called justification by faith only; is it not therefore by
faith only? 6. Its observed to my hand by Camero, Certe nusquam legas, vera
fides, vera spes, vera charitas. Came. Resp. ad epist. viri docti. c. 19. p. 777.
that nowhere in Scripture is a Christians faith called true faith, his hope a
true hope, his charity true charity; is therefore his faith not a true faith,
his hope and charity not true?

2. Are you such a great stranger in Israel, that you know not that received
and undoubted maxim? There are sundry things but once mentioned in Scripture;
were it granted that Jesus Christ is no where else in Scripture called the true
God, its enough if he be so called here, Pronomine illo (...) significatum
fuisse
as most certainly he is. This one text (if there be no more) is a sufficient
foundation for a Saint to bottom his faith upon. The Christian Sabbath is but
once in the New Testament called the Lords day, Revel. 1. 10. a Johanne
Christum ipsum CERTO CERTIVS est. Zanch. ib.
I was in the Spirit on the Lords day. Is it not therefore the Lords day? I
confess indeed Beza says in his Annotations on 1 Cor. 16. 2. upon the first
day of the week he found in an ancient copy added (...), being the Lords day;
to wit, on the first day of the week, being the Lords day, but we find it not
so in our books in the forenamed place of the Corinthians. Again,
Churchofficers are but once in the New Testament called The Church, Mat. 18.
17. Tell the Church. Are they not therefore the Church? but because those
instances are liable to exceptions, and men of parts and Piety differ in their
opinion and exposition; I shall wave them, and give you some few pregnant and
pertinent instances among many. e. g. The Lattesse in Cant, 2. 9. (showing
himself through the Lattesse) is nowhere else used in the Hebrew, if Mr.
Ainsworth may be believed. Nor that casting down (of the lapsed Angels) to hell
or hel-ward, 2 Pet. 2. 4. is no where else used, if Mr. Mede The word (...) in
S. Peter is (...). Vide los-Medes works, 4o. p. 101. 102.
may be believed; and I ammuch deceived if that word (...) in 1 Timothy 2. 12. --
(Nor to usurp authority over the man) be any where else in Scripture used; Are
these things therefore any whit the more questionable? Secondly, Though Ames.
explicatio Analytica in 1 Pet. 2. 13
Superiority of Power and Civil Government it self be simply and absolutely
commanded by God, and therefore called an Ordinance of God, Romans 15. 1, 2. yet
this or that form of Government, or special manner of Power, is not determined
by God, but by men; therefore called in 1 Pet. 2. 13. an ordinance of man, or
as it might be rendered, (...). So the Vulg. and Erasm.
an humane creature or creation, a phrase used nowhere else; is it therefore
the more questionable, whether a Magistrate or Magistracy be an Ordinance of
man? 3. The Church compact of Jews and Gentiles, is but once called one new
man, Ephesians. 2. 15. -- to make in himself of twain one new man; is it therefore
the more questionable? Fourthly, To put all out of doubt, (because the matter
in agitation is about Christ) Christ himself is but once said to be in the
form of God, Phil. 2. 6. The express image of his Person, Heb. 1. 3. (or as
the words may be read) The Character of his substance: The beginning of the
Creation of God, Rev. 3. 14. The firstborn of every creature, Col. 1. 15. The
true bread, John 6. 32. The true vine, cap. 15. 1. Is it therefore any whit the
more questionable whether Jesus Christ may be so called? I trow not.

3. Admit (for Argument sake) that Jesus Christ is no where else in Scripture
called the true God: yet (by your leave) he is called God, John 1. 1. Blessed
God, Romans 9. 5. Great God, Tit. 2. 13. The mighty God, Isa. 9. 6. etc. All
which (and many more Titles ascribed to him in holy Scripture) amount to this,
The true God, notwithstanding your exceptions against the forenamed places,
which like Fig Leaves (if I be not prevented by a better pen) shall be removed,
and your nakedness discovered. Jesus Christ is no where called in Scripture
Gods Minister, Gods Instrument, Gods Viceroy, Gods Reprseentative, etc. yet you
believe Scripture holds forth that which amounts thereto; else you would not so
frequently call Christ by such names, and will you be a Didymist here? But to
use a better instance, The Scripture says we are justified without works, we
are justified by faith, does not all amount to this, we are justified by faith
only? So here --

4. What will you say if Jesus Christ be elsewhere in Scripture called the true
God? I humbly conceive so, Jer. 10. 10. But the Lord is the true God. I am not
ignorant it is in the Original Aelohim Aemeth, the God of truth. But it is an
usual Hebraisme, as in the same verse, A King of eternity, i.e. an eternal
King, and so (to name no more) 2 Cor. 1. 3. -- Genitivus pro Adjectivo -- i.e.
Pater sum misericors. Grot.
The father of mercies, i.e. A merciful father. Now that Jesus Christ is here
employed, and to be understood, take for the clearing and confirming of it these
few reasons.

1. Because these words in the beginning of the seventh verse (Who would not
fear thee O King of Nations!) spoken and applied to Christ, Praebet hic
Titulus NON OBSCVRVM Divinitatis Agni argumentum, cui tanquam Authori opus
illud stupendum devictae bestiae acceptum ferunt, and praedicant sancti. Pareus
in loc.
Rev. 15. 3, 4. Thus our Translators of the Bible into English understood it,
as appears by the interchangable quotation. And this is more probable, because
Beza says Arethas reads the words in Revel. forenamed -- (...)
King of Nations, i.e. Of all the Saints of, in, or among the Nations.

2. Because the work of Creation, mentioned ver. 12. which is proper to the
most High, Psalm. 104. 25, 26. is ascribed to Christ, Heb. 1. 10, 11, 12. your
distinction, p. 35. of an Agent principal and instrumental, in the work of
Creation, and your bold assertion thereupon, that Jesus Christ was only an
instrumental Agent in the Creation of the world (which shall be examined in its
proper place,) will not help you a jot at this dead lift.

3. Because of the name of this true God, verse. 16. The Lord of Hosts is his
name, You acknowledge p. 10. This noble name is by the Apostle from Isay 6. 3.
translated Lord Almighty, Rev. 4. 8. And given to him that sits on the Throne.
Which name is given to Jesus Christ, if you will compare, Isa. 6. 10. with
John 12. 41. These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory and spoke of HIM.
The relative refers to Christ in the precedent verse. 37. Though HE had done so
many miracles before them, yet they believed not on HIM. Who is he? The Lord
Jesus, verse. 36. These things spoke Jesus, -- And it refers to Christ in the
subsequent, verse. 42. -- Many believed on HIM, -- but they did not confess
HIM. If the context carry it to Christ, therefore of necessity here, verse. 41.
So that (I hope) it is evident that Jesus Christ is elsewhere in Scripture
called The true God; and that your second reason is very frail and false. Mr.
Knowles Sect. 6.


Reas. 3. Because the father is called the true God distinct from the Son, 1 Thessalonians. 1. 9, 10. -- How ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and
true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
even Jesus, etc. -- It is evident from this text, that the Father distinct from
the Son is called the living and true God; and therefore it is probable in the
text under examination, the Father only is intended in this expression, This is
the true God.

Give me leave to trusse up this reason into an Argument Reply.
without wronging you; if in the 1 These. 1. 9, 10. the Father distinct from the
Son is called the true God, then also its probable in 1 John 5. 20. But the
former is true. Therefore --

Or thus. He that is distinct from the true God, is not the true God; Jesus
Christ is distinct from the true God; Therefore --

Sir, if you take to the first Syllogistical form, I deny your consequence;
for the Father even distinct from the A mea non sequit^r.
Son, may be called the true God in 1 These. 1. 9, 10. and yet the Son -- may be
called the true God in 1 John 5. 20. you your self foresaw the inconsequence,
and therefore you assert it but as probable; and probabilities (I imagine) will
not carry it.

If you own the latter Argument, The major is false; for the Spirit as well as
Christ is distinct from the true God (in some sense) and yet is the true God,

May not I as well argue out of Mark 16. 7. Tell his disciples and Peter, that

hand of Saul, that Saul was none of David's enemies; for he is distinct from
them. But as he appealed from Philip to Philip, so do I from Mr. Knowls to Mr.
Knowls, who seems to answer with indignation. page 39. What? Was Saul none of
David's enemies? He was; -- But why do I go so far? will you conclude waiting is
no serving, because its evident from this text, 1 These. 1. 9, 10. That waiting
is distinguished from serving -- to serve and to wait --

Reas. 4. Bcause the Father is called the ONLY true Mr. Knowles Sect. 7.
God, John 17. 3. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
true God, and whom thou have sent, Jesus Christ. Here the Father is called the
only true God, and so the Son is excluded from being the true God, and
therefore of necessity in 1 John 5. 20. The Father only is intended. Reply.


Your Argument (I take it) runs thus. If the Father be called the only true God
in John 17. 3. Then of necessity in 1 John 5. 20. But the former is true.
Therefore. -- or thus, The Son is excluded from being true God, in Ioh. 17.
3. Therefore of necessity in 1 Ioh. 5. 20.

Sir, your former inference must be probable, this last necessary, if you must
be believed; but in truth there is no probability in the former, much less
necessity in this. For,

1. If from this place you are so bold as to argue Jesus Christ out of his
Deity; I imagine, you will make no bones to argue Diverse passages in your book
hint as much as page 22. 27, 34. etc.
the Holy Ghost also out of his Deity. Your Argument does militate as strongly
(in show) against the one, as against the other; and then quo vadis? whither
are you going?

2. This word ONLY is not always an So Chrysostom. citing 1 Cor. 9. 6 where the
particle ONLY does not exclude but commend Barnaba^.
exclusive particle, as may appear, 1. By your own allegations. For you, p. 11.
line 10. The words, 1 John 5. 20. This is the true God and eternal life, relate
to the Father only, and yet you do not exclude the Son, line 19. 20. of the
same page; you say page 18. Isaac is called Abraham's only begotten Son, yet you
exclude not Ishmael by Hagar, and others he had by Keturah, though I grant he
was Abraham's only begotten Son by promise. Again, you in page 46. quote Mat. 4.
10. Him only shall thou serve. Though God only is to be worshipped and served,
yet it seems to me you do not exclude Christ. If you do, is it not contrary to
Joh. 5. 23? That all men should honor the Son EVEN as they honor the Father.
If you do not, then (your self being Judge) the term Only is not always
exclusive. But secondly it will appear by other instances, Job. 9. 8. Which
alone spreads out the heavens, -- Although you understand it spoken of God
the Father, yet can you not exclude the Son; for those words, Heb. 1. 10. (And
the heavens are the works of thy hands) are spoken to Christ, as appears by
your conjunction. And -- in the beginning of your tenth page compared with page,
8. Again Zanc. l. 3. c. 10 p. 484.
Peter says of Christ, Acts 4. 12. Neither is there salvation in any other,
there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved,
will you exclude the Father from savingus? no. Tit. 3. ver. 4, 5, 6. -- yea,
will you exclude Jesus Christ, (I say not your self emitting such Arguments and
Answers against the Deity of Jesus Christ) from being wise? because its said,
Romans 16. 27. -- Thus Greg. Nazianz. argued long since. Si soli sapienti Deo,
aut soli habenti immortalitatem, lucem inaccessam habitanti -- sic intelligas,
non abibit, quin ad mortem condemnatus filius, aut tenebrae aut NON SAPIENS sit
-- de Theologia. l. 4. p 265. Edit. Lat-Muscul. --
to God only wise? -- when yet you acknowledge page 26. according to the
Scripture of truth, Col. 2. 3. In him are hid all treasures of Wisdom and
Knowledge, yea, and he is expressly called the Wisdom of God, 1 Cor. 1. 24.
To say nothing of your not daring (I believe) to exclude Jesus Christ from
having immortality, when Paul says of the Father, 1 Timothy 6. 16. Who ONLY has
immortality. To conclude, will you exclude Sarah from being called of God,
because its said Isa. 51. 2. I called Abraham alone? No, Piscator Vxorem
habebat cum vocaretur. Pisc. in loc.
can tell you he had a wife when he was called, and the story confirms it. If
it be said Abraham might be called alone, though Sarah named in the same verse
were called in him, she being one with him; So the Father may be called here
the only true God, though Jesus Christ is not to be excluded, he being one with
him in nature and essence, not in work only, as you say, John 10. 30. which
hereafter (God willing) shall be demonstrated.

3. What if the words may be read thus? -- To know thee, and Jesus Christ whom
thou have sent, the only true God. Thus the Son is not excluded from being the
true God, but included (or rather expressed) to be the true God. Such
trajections are very frequent in Scripture. To instance only in the Scripture
quoted by you in your second reason, 1 These. 1. 10. -- And to wait for his Son
from heaven, even Jesus whom he raised from the dead. Your learned man Grotius
Ethic transpositio, pro (...) ut Act. 6 10.
expressly asserts a transposition here, reading the words thus, -- And to
wait for his Son, -- even Jesus whom he raised from the dead. And that it is so
here in the text under debate. Dan. Heinsius Hic si Chrysostomo credimus, hoc
volebat Dominus (...). Heins. in loc.
(a Critical man, and therefore more likely to take with your Critical wit)
confirms it out of sundry Greek Authors, alleging that Chrysostom so reads
them, as the mind of Jesus Christ, and concludes: This therefore is the true
sense, that they may know thee, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent, the only
true God. This is no new interpretation, (and if it were new, no matter if it
be right) It is very ancient. Beside Chrysostom aforementioned, Augustine
says, Ordo verborum est, ut te and quem misisti Jesum Christu^ cognoscant
verum Deum. Aug. Tract. 105. in Joh.
This is the order of the words, that they may know thee, and Jesus Christ whom
thou have sent, the only true God. And Quod quidem Arriani sic solent accipere
quasi non sit Filius verus Deus -- -- answers; ordo verborum. est, etc. de
Trin. l. 6. c. 9.
elsewhere telling us that the Arrians were so wont to take this place, as if
the Son were not God, uses the same expression, This is the order of the
words, etc. Ambrose also says, Christum non EXCLVDERE se, quin verus sit Deus,
ex hoc ipso loco perspicuum est; illu^ enim in cujus cognitione, vita aeterna
positasit, qui possit non esse Deum? Ambr. de side l. 5. c. 2.
Its evident from this place, that Christ does not EXCLUDE himself from being
the true God, because life lies in knowing HIM. I shall conclude with
Tertullian who argues from this text otherwise then you do. If Christ would not
have himself to be understood the true God also, why did he add [and whom thon
have sent Jesus Christ] Else he had said [And whom thou have sent, the MAN
Jesus Christ -- ] But since he has joined himself with God, he BY THIS
CONJUNCTION, would be understood, as indeed he is, THE TRUE GOD.

4. But take the words as they lie in our English translation, Yet it will not
of NECESSITY follow, that Christ is excluded from being the true God. For the
Father is not opposed to the Son, but to idols and false Gods: And then the
sens^ seems to be this: Life eternal consists in this, that leaving the
multitude of false Gods, we might know even Jesus Christ, not a false god, as
idols are, hut the true God also as the father is. Thus many ancient Writers
understood it, Sane mea est opinio, illud, cognoscant te solum verum Deum, ad
eos, qui cum Dii dicantur, tamen non sunt, toll^ndos valere. Alioquin, si
Christo ex adverso responderit -- adjectum non esset and quem misisti Jesum
Christum. Greg. Naz. ibid.
My opinion (says Nazian.) is, That those words, the only true God, Take away
those who are called gods but indeed are not, NOT Jesus Christ, for then it had
not been added, -- and whom thou have sent Jesus Christ. To the same purpose
Basil Qui verus est Deus, ad eos, qui ex opposito falso distinguntur, dicitur,
scnon existentes. Bas. contra Eunom. l 4. p. 177.
the Great, and Cyril Patrem a falsis and solo nomine Diis distinguens, solum
verumque Deum appellat. Cyril. in loc. l. 11. c. 16. and in Thesauro. l. 10. c.
6.
Alexander, and others (whom I could name) deliver themselves. But because you
profess you like Reason and Scripture best, I will deal with you that way.
That this is spoken in opposition to, and exclusion of salse gods, its more
then probable by the constant language of the Scriptures elsewhere. e. g. Ier.
10. 10. But the Lord is the true God -- compared with v. 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16.
Where Jehovah the true and living God is abundantly opposed to false gods; and
is it not evident in the text forementioned? 1 Thessalonians. 1. 9. -- How ye turned
from idols -- to serve -- THE TRUE GOD. Nay, is it not clear in the text under
Examination? 1 John 5. 20. That we may know him that is TRUE, and we are in him
that is TRUE. This is the TRUE God. Now it follows immediately, ver. 21. -- Keep
your selves from IDOLS. Is not the true God in all these places opposed to
idols?

To wind up all, this particle ONLY, is not to be Particula exclusiva (...) non
conjungitur cum subjecto TE, sed cu^ praedicato VERUM Deum. Sancti. de trib.
Elohim. pars altra. l. 3. c. 10. p. 483.
joined with the subject THEE, but with the Predicate GOD, as is apparent by
the other epithet TRUE, which belongs to the Predicate GOD, and not to the
subject THEE. Its one thing to say -- that they might know THEE ONLY the true
God, and another thing to say -- that they might know thee the ONLY true God.
This Answer has cut in sunder the sinews of the Arrians Argument heretofore
out of this place, Maldonat. in loc.
and is as keen now (through Gods blessing) for ought I know. Suppose one
should argue thus; The Sun is the only true light in the day time to inlighten
our Hemisphere, therefore the beams of the Sun are not, who sees not the fallacy
and falsehood of this consequence? Does it not rather follow, that the beams
with the Sun are the only true light. So it is here (only let not the
comparison be stretched beyond my intention) This text rather holds him forth
to be the true God then excludes him (as you harshly speak) from being the true
God. Now (the premises being considered) it will not (I think) of NECESSITY
follow that in 1 John 5. 20. The Father is ONLY intended.

Sir, having (I hope) taken off the edge of your reasons, (whereby you
endeavored to prove, that the Sect. 8.
words under examination relate not to the Son but to the Father only) Give me
leave on the contrary to tender to you some reasons, why the words -- relate
not to the Father, but to the Son.

1. Because the Incipit primum omnium a Christi Personae descriptione -- Hujus
igitur primum omnium Deitatem aeternam proponit. Beza.
beginning of John's Epistle, holds forth the subject of his preaching and
writing, viz. the person -- (...) --
of Jesus Christ, chapter 1. 1. -- of (or concerning) the Word of life. Now its
more then probable, that the End or Conclusion of the Epistle, is suitable to
the Preface or beginning. This reason may be cogent, (if not to others, yet) to
Mr. Knowls, who is carried with mere probabilities for the most part.

2. Because there is no great necessity rationally imaginable, that should move
or constrain the Apostle so strenuously and industriously to assert, the Deity
of the Father. For what man (within the pale of the Christian Church) did deny
or doubt of it? But there might be just and necessary cause of asserting the
Deity of Jesus Christ. You say Page 11.
many at this time did arise, who did gainsay and deny the coming of the Son
of God in the flesh. So (say I) many at this time Ebion and Cerinthus solum
hominem censuerunt Christum. Eusebius. Eccl. Hist. l. 3. c. 21, 22. and Epiphan.
Haeres. 51. and August. de Hares. c. 8. and 10.
did arise, who did gainsay and deny the Deity of Jesus Christ, holding Christ
to be a mere man, or whole Christ to be a creature, as Master Knowls does, page
20. etc. --

3. Because of the great work ascribed to the Son of God verse. 20. -- And has
given us an understanding to know him. -- This is the Royal Privilege of the
most high, as appears by the Saints prayers, Ephesians. 1. 17. Col. 1. 9. And by Gods
performance, 1 King. 3. 12. I have given thee a wise and understanding heart.
-- Or if you please, let me form your Gloss into an Argument.

He that has anoint the eyes of our minds, that we might savingly know God is
the true God. But Jesus Christ has so anointed -- Therefore --

The Minor is your own, p. 11. The Major is as clear as the Sun, yet take the
strength of it in these few positions briefly. 1. Saving knowledge is a gift,
Mat. 13. 11. To you it is GIVEN to know -- 2. Its God only who gives this
knowledge, 2 Cor. 4. 6. God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
has shined in our hearts -- 3. This knowledge can never be had, God not giving
it, Deuteronomy. 28. 4. -- Now its your own Concession, Jesus Christ gives this
knowledge.


4. Because believers are said (in the same verse) to be in him that is true,
which the Apostle expounds to be even in his Son Jesus Christ, In him that is
true, who is he? his Son Jesus Christ. And least any should doubt of whom he
speaks, he adds immediately. This is the true God.

5. Because of the proper signification, and frequent, nay constant use of the
Relative (...).
THIS, which relates to the next member or antecedent, and therefore to the Son
of God, as has been showed before. For if John had meant as you do, he should
have said; (...) or (...), not (...), Ille not Iste, THAT not THIS. And I
challenge you to produce any one text in the New Testament to the contrary, and
I shall heartily confess my ignorance or inadvertency.

6. Because Jesus Christ (you confess) is here said to be eternal life, and
why then is not Jesus Christ this true God, when De uno certi ac eodem utrumque
praedicat, quod ((...). Christus verus sit deus ac vita aeterna. Calv. in loc.
both are spoken of one and the same Person? Certainly if Jesus Christ be
acknowledged here to be Illa aeterna vita. Pisc.
the eternal life, it cannot be denied (according to the laws of a true
copulate Axiom) that THIS JESUS CHRIST IS THE TRUE GOD. Indeed if we take your
Gloss by it self in the close of your first answer, it will not of necessity
follow, For Gods ordinances and our performances, Via and Regnum, non causa
regnandi. Bern.
are the way to eternal life. If this be your meaning, what is it but a crumb
of Socinianism, and contrary to the stream of Expositors? But in charity I will
judge you to be of the same mind Page 8.
with Pareus, and your learned and godly man mentioned. page 9. That Christ is
also the Author of eternal life to all that obey him. In this sense pure reason
cannot but bring in this Verdict (to use your own expression, page 35.) THIS
JESUS CHRIST IS THE TRUE GOD.

FINIS.
