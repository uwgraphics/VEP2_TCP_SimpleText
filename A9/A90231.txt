THE COMMONERS COMPLAINT: OR, A DREADFVL WARNING FROM Newgate, to the Commons
of England.

PRESENTED To the Honorable Committee for consideration of the Commoners
Liberties.

Wherein (as in a Glass) every Freeman of England may clearly be hold his own
imminent insufferable bondage and slavery under the Norman-Prerogative Men of
this Kingdom, represented by the present sufferings of Richard Overton; who for
his just Vindication of the Commoners Rights and Freedoms against the Arbitrary
Domination of the House of Lords, has by them bin imprisoned these 6 Months in
the Goal of Newgate, his wife and his brother also by them most unjustly cast
into Maidenlace prison: And from thence, she (with her tender babe of half a
years age in her arms) was, for refusing active subjection to their Arbytrary
Orders, dragged most barbarously and inhumanely headlong upon the stones
through the streers in the dirt and mire (as was her husband formerly (November.
3. 1646) for the said cause) worse then Rebels, Traitors, Thieves, or
Murderers, to the place of execution: And in that most contemptible and
villainous manner cast into the most reproachful, infamous Goal of Bridewell:
And their 3 small children (as helpless Orphans bereft of Father and Mother,
Sister and Brother) exposed to the mercy of the wide world.

Whereunto is annexed the respective Appeals of his wife, and of his brother,
unto the High Court of Parliament, the Commons of England assembled at
Westminster.

Isa. 59. 14. And judgment is turned backward, and justice stands a far
off: for Truth is fallen in the street, and Equity cannot enter.

Printed Anno Dom. 1646.

To his honored friend, Col. Henry Martin, a Member of the House of Commons,
and Chairman to the honorable Committee, for consideration of the Commoners
Liberties, and in him, to all the M^mbers of the said Committee; The humble
Information and Complaint of Richard Overton, prisoner in the infamous Goal of
Newgate; concerning the barbarous cruelties, and inhumane practices of the
house of Lord (and of their Prerogative-Agents) exercised upon himself, his
wife, children, and whole family, since his legal trial before the said
honorable Committee.
Jam. 2 13. He shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy.
Psalm. 41. 1, 2. Blessed is he that considers the poor, the Lord will
deliver him in the time of trouble, the Lord will preserve him, and keep him
alive, and he shall be blessed upon the Earth.
Master Chair man,
AS B^ndage and Liberty are two contraries, so you cannot truly consider the
one, but you must reflect your eye upon the other: For, though one be so
destuctive to the Being of the other, that, where the one is, the other cannot
be; yet, each by other is more eminently distinguished: And look how much the
one is exceeding the other, by so much the other is deficient, and loses of
its Property: for, quorum unum altero latius est, non suntre anum.

Therefore, I humbly conceive, that, to the consideration of the Commoners
Liberties, the usurpations, encroachments, and destructions thereof, fall
inavoydably into like consideration, even so, as the one cannot be truly
considered without the other: If you will cast your eye upon the glory and
beauty of the one, your ear must be open to the cry and complaint of the
other; And therefore, answerably, as you are by the Sovereign power of the Land
ordained and deputed for the due and grave consideration of the Common^rs
Liberties, you are by the same Authority also empowered for the rec^ption of all
Petitions, Informations, and Complaints of the Afflicted Commoners, touching
their Birthright, Liberties, and Freedoms, and thereof to judge, and
accordingly to make Report unto the House.

Wherefore Sir, I shall presume to present this honorable Committee, with the
late most barbarous inhumanities, and Turkish Cruelties, by the most Arbytrary
Tyrannical House of Lords, and their Prerogative-Butchers perpetrated upon my
self, upon my wife, my three small children, upon my brother, and the rest of my
family, in all, consisting of 8 persons, all committed and acted since the late
legal consideration and trial of my cause before you, yet still depending upon
the Report of this honorable Committee: As for their former illegal
usuapations over me, I shall omit their repetition, they being already made
public unto the world and only acquaint you with the latter.

But first, I shall present you with those their illegal cruelties See the
defiance, and the Arrow against ryrannie.
which concern my self (they falling first in order) together with the mutual
passages concerning the same, betwixt their Instruments and me, then answerably
I shall descend to their barbarous unheard of inhumanities (such as never were
acted by their Norman Progenitors, since the Prerogative-Foundation of that
Norman house was ever laid, or ever since they bore the name of an House of
Peers) now lately upon the 6. and 8. of this instant Ian. 1646, most
villainously perpetrated upon my wife, children, and the rest of my family, and
commit the mutual passages on both sides (faithfully pend and presented) unto
your grave and judicious consideration, to judge impartially betwixt us: And
all that I in the behalf of my self, and of mine, shall crave from this
honorable Committee, is but the Benefit of what the Lord himself has
commanded, Lev. 19. 15. Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, thou shall
not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty, but in
rightousnesse shall thou judge thy neighbor.

If I be found a transgressour, then let me speedily suffer my doom; but if I
be found none, then let me have speedy relief: I crave no favor, nor boon at
your hands; it is only justice which I desire, and that's but a reasonable
suit; a suit, which of Pagans, Turks, and Infidels would not be condemned, and
therefore justly may be expected from you.

Thus, then Sir, give me leave to acquaint you, that after my last departure
from you in the Palace yard (November. 3. 1646.) and that I was cleared from your
presence, and the presence of my friends, and was only left in the hands of my
Gaolers, my indignation and detestation (fore-uttered in your presence in the
inward Court of Wards) against the Arbytrary tyranny and usurpation of the
house of Lords over the Commoners natural and legal Freedoms and Rights, and
over mine in particular burst out afresh; and upon consideration, whether I
should be so base to my Country, and to my self in particular, as to yield
these Arbytrary Lords, so much Villain-service, as to become their Lordships
Prerogative-Porter, to carry my self to the stinking, lousy, barbarous Goal of
Newgate again or no; I resolved in my self, that as in heart I defied all
injustice, cruelty, tyranny, and oppression, all arbitrary usurpation and
usurpers whatsoever, so in person (come life, come death, come what come would)
I would not be so treacherous to my own self, to my wife and children, and
especially to this Nation (the Land of my Nativity) in general, as personally
to yield my active submission of any limb that was mine (either in substance,
or in show) in the least, to any Arbitrary Vipers or Pests, Egyptian
Grasshoppers, Norman Invaders and Destroyers of the Commoners legal inheritance
and birthright, their liberties and freedoms confirmed to them, both by
divine, natural, and humane Right: or once to set one leg before another in
subjection or at endance to any of their Canibal, Canker-worm, Arbytrary Orders
Warrants, Significations of their pleasures (so flatly contrary to all good
laws, justice, and equity) being as so many Mothes in the Royal Roabe of the
State, or rather as so many Wild-Bores out of the Forest, to root up, devour,
disfrancnise and destroy this Nation of all her ancient legal immunities and
freedoms, root and branch; yea, and of those tender Plants and Seeds of the
Commoners Rights and Liberties, which, in the dreadful face of so many late
turbulent, tempestuous, impetuous G^sts of opposition rage, bloodshed, and
fury have been implanted and sown in the oppressed Common-field of the State,
the which for want of their own natural Dew and Rain from the Superior Orb
of Authority, but withheld by some Luciferean Angels of State, Regal,
Parliamentary, Synodian Sottish and Scottish; the natural, free-Commoners of
England have been forced to wet, moysten, and manure the same with their blood,
their flesh, and their bones, etc. that those tender Plants of freedom, equity
and justice, might take root, be preserved, spring up, flourish, and bring
forth fruit, if not for themselves, yet for their Posterities.

And upon these or the like considerations, I told my Jaylors, that if they had
no other Order or Warant for the remanding back of my person to the Goal of
Newgate I would not set one leg before another in subjection thereto; but was
fully resolved, that if they would have me back to the Goal, they should carry
me.

But (Sir) least the rarity and strangeness of this Act should incur yours
and the Committes unjust censure and condemnation, like as of the inconsiderate
multitude, whose judgments are guided by custom, more then by reason; be
pleased to consider, that,

All State-Deprivation of life, limb, goods, liberty or freedom, either is,
or should be, all and every particle thereof, the just execution of the Law
executing: For in Equity* the Action executing is indivisible from the Law, and
only and precisely proper thereto and not at all to the party executed: yea,
though a man legally guilty of death should be condemned by the same legal
Authority (or rather by persons therein entrusted) to cut his own throat; yet
were he in equity not bound thereunto, but in so doing should be guilty of his
own blood. And the Law of our Land makes no man his own Executioner, but has
provided Ministers and Executioners, as Majors, Sh^riffes, Constable, Goalers,
Hangmen, etc. for that very end and purpose: And the Law of God leaves it as a
matter out of all doubt and dispute, and nature it self teaches, that no man
shall be his own Butcher or Executioner, for in so doing, he should sin against
his own flesh, which is a thing most unnatural and inhumane.

But my rejection of carrying my own Body to the Goal, was no other but the
refusal to be my own Executioner thereins for though it were not of that
degree of cruelty and inhumanity to my own flesh, as to cut my own throat; yet
was it of the same nature and kind. And therefore if the one must be condemned
as unjust, illegal and unnatural, so must the other in its kind, so that as I
was not bound, with my hands to cut my own throat, so with my feet, I was not
bound to carry my self to prison.

And from hence is it (as I conceive) that the Law has provided Portage with
Carts, Sledges, or the like, for Malefactors to the place of Execution, that
they might not any ways (either actually or apparently) be guilty of their own
Execution, a thing abhominated and abhorred of nature.

But if it be objected, it is only in Capital matters, as of death, and the
like, I answer, that from the equity whereon that is founded, the other is
necessarily employed, one equity being relative and essential unto both, and so
need not be expressed in the less: for by the equity and au^hority for the
greater, the like is justified and commanded to be for the less, for omne
majus includit minus the less is included in the greater, so that the equity
in the greater cannot be denied to the less.

Therefore, in case I were legally a prisoner, yet were I not bound thereby to
set one leg before another in my own execu^io^ although there were no precise
prescript therefore in the letter of the law to discharge me thereof, which needs
no further probation, yet for exemplary illustration: be pleased to consider,
that in the case of a Generals Commission, it is needless to enjoin him by
litterall expression, not to turn the mouths of his Cannons against his own
Soldiers, for that is so necessarily and naturally employed, that it is
needless to be expressed: and as ^t is in the millitary, even so and much more
is it in the pollitick capacity, the millitary being but thereto subservient.

Yet further, though the letter of the Law should enjoin its Condemnants to be
their own executioners, yet were that by its own equity condemned, nuld, and
made void, for the letter must be subject to the equity: and look how much the
letter transgresses the equity, even so much it is unequal, and is of no
validity or force, for the Law taken from its original reason and end is made
a shell without a kernel, a shadow without a substance, a Carkesse without
life: for the equity and reason thereof is that which gives it a legal being
and life, and makes it authoritative and binding, if this be not granted,
injustice may be a Law, tyranny may be a Law, lust, will, pride, covetousness,
and what no? may be Laws; for if equity be not the bounder of the Law, over
the corrupt nature of man, all will fall into confusion, and one man will
devour another.

Besides, as no man by Law may be his own Judge, so by the same reason no man
may be his own Executioner, for as in equity it appropriateth sole Judgment to
it self, so to it self it makes sole Challenge to its execution: for the
contraction and unity of reason betwixt them may not be divided. So that in
reason as it is bound to the one, in reason it is bound to provide for the
other, and the guilty be suspended from both, and to the Law wholly made
passive, both for Judgment and execution.

But, if any, for want of president, shall condemn this Act of mine; to such
its proved rationally will answer, that reason has no president; for, reason
is the fountain of all just presidents, and so used, granted and applied by
this very Parliament. 1 Book. declar. fol. 264. 298. 709. 726.

And from this accustomary pedant vassalage formerly tho pursevants (and such
like catchpole devouring vermin) have made use for argument safe against those
which have complained of their Imprisonment to the Parliament, saying, they did
not carry them to prison, but, that they went into prison; But I think I have
prevented the use of that objection against me.

Thus Sir, if the Law impose no such obligation upon its Subjects, then can
that which is contradictory thereto so vassalage any? if the Law fetch not that
within its compass and bounds, then much less may that which is contrary
thereto, which was my then present condition, for I was not in their hands,
then under any legal warrant of the Law of the Land, but under an arbitrary
order of the House of Lords, directly contrary to the very Being of the Law of
the Land: Therefore for me to be my own Executioner or its Executioner upon my
self (for going or carrying cannot be denied to be in a great measure its
Execution) were to prefers the Law of Lust, or Will, before the Law of the
Land: to do more for that Power which is contrary to the very being of the Law,
then the very Law it self does require in its own behalf, and if that were
not to make the Law of none effect, judge ye. To do that homage to such a power
which is not due to the Law (for no more is due to the Law then the Law does
require, and the Law does require no more then its due) is to make Lust and
Will predominant thereto, to make Will to take the Wall of the Law, to abrogate
Law, and in the room thereof to introduce an arbitrary power.

And therefore as their Lordships in that their arbitrary capacity found
Warrants, so should their Lordships find Legs to obey them, for I was
resolved, mine should not be enslaved to that their usurpation to do their
Arbitrary Drudgery, I would rather loose my life, then in that kind to do them
that vassalage: My Legs were borne a free as the rest of my Body, and
therefore I scorn that Legs, or Arms, or hands of mine should do them any
villeine-Service, for as I am a Freeman by Birth, so I am resolved to live and
dye, both in heart word and deed, in substance and in show, maugre the
Arbitrary malice of the House of Lords: yea if ought else I can devise to show
my actual enmity and defiance against their arbitrary power, I Will do it,
though it cost the life of me, and mine, and therefore I care not who lets them
know, that, that Act of mine was done in despite and defiance of their Warrant.

But in case you object, that I knew well enough, that if I would not go, they
would carry me, therefore it had been better for me to have gone, then to have
exposed my self to their cruelty.

I Answer.

1. If I had known they would have hanged me, must I therefore have hanged my
self?

2. A good conscience had rather run the hazard of cruelty then to abate an
hairs breadth of contestation and opposition against illegality, injustice, and
tyranny.

3. If they had had any legal justifiction over my legs, then at their
Commands my legs were bound to obey: And then (in that case) I confess it had
been better to obey, then to have exposed m^ person to the cruelty of
threatening merciless Goalers: But being free from their Jurisdiction from the
Crown of my head to the Soale of my foot, I know no reason, why I should
foot it for them, or in the least dance any attendance to their Arbitrary
Warrants; their Lordships may put up their pipes, except they will play to the
good old tune of the Law of the Land, otherwise their Orders and Warrants are
never like to have the Service of my legs or feet, for they were never bred to
tread in their Arbitrary Steps, but I shall leave their Orders and their
execution to themselves. And therefore, Sir, concerning that action of mine, I
shall continue in the said esteem thereof, till my defense be made void, and
it be legally proved, that by the Law of the Land, I was bound to set one leg
before another in attendance to that Order.

And further touching this matter, I desire you to remember, that in the inward
Court of Wards, when I discovered those resolutions, in the Audience of diverse
Gentlemen there present, unto you, I told you, that I was no longer under the
Arbitrary power of that illegal warrant of the Lords, but under the power of
the House of Commons, from which I was resolved not to depart, which in some
measure you seemed to oppose, whereat I demanded of you, How then I came there?
And if I were not brought thither bp virtue of an Order from that Committee? So
that though being formerly Commanded by the Lords Order to be kept in the
Custody of Newgate till their pleasures should be further signified, whereof to
that time there had been no further signification at all, yet notwithstanding I
was brought from thence by virtue of an Order from that Committee, contrary to
the end and intent of that Order of the Lords, so that I conceived, and still
do conceive than though that Warrant were not void of it self, yet were it
made void by that Order of their own, under the power and protection of which
Order I was, sothat being there, I would not depart from the roof and verge of
your Authority, and this you know was the substance of my words, and thereupon
indeed, I sat we downs in the window, and told my Jailer, (but one at that
time being present) that if he would have me to prison, he should carry me:
notwithstanding you would give him no further charge of me, for conceiving from
the equity of the Law (which though contradicted by the letter is absolutely
binding and valid) that I could not be remanded back unto prison without a new
Commitment, I demanded of you, if you would commit me? and I told you, that if
you would, I then would goo, but that you plainly denied with an absolute No,
then I asked you if you would command me to go and I would, but that you also
denied, then I told you, that if you would but entreat me for formallity sake,
(without any relation to that Order of the Lords) to go, I would go, but if you
would neither commit, command, nor entreat me, then I would not go, nothing
then being against me for my imprisonment, but that Order of the Lords, And as
I was resolved I told you, that I would not obey it to set one leg before
another after its humor. Therefore Sir, how you can blame me, either of
illegality or so much as of disrespect unto you, or this Honorable Committee I
cannot see, for no Law did I break, and to prevent all misconstructions I
offered you more, then by Law I needed to have done.

Sir,
Had there been the letter of the Law directly against me, yet if it were
contradicted by the equity of the Law, I had not been at all bound thereunto,
except to oppose it: for the Letter if it control and over throw the equity,
it is to be controlled and overthrown it self, upon peril of treason to the
equity, and the equity to be preserved as the thing only legally obligatory
and binding.

But (Sir) there was neither letter nor equity of the Law against me, but that
which was directly contrary to both: for the Lords warrant was directly
oppugnant and destructive both to the legal letter and equity.

Therefore (Sir) I conceive that I was in no measure bound thereunto, but was
as free legally, as in case that warrant of the Lords never had been. So that I
had good cause, in case you would have had me part with my liberty, to demand,
if that you would commit me, command me, or entreat me, and upon your denial
of all these to tell you, that then I would not go: For do you think that I am
such a fool to part with my liberty, for nothing? Sir, our liberties have been
bought at a dearer rate, then so to be trifled and slighted away, especially to
captivate the same to the exhorbitant wills of the Lords, and to cast my self
in prison during their boundless pleasures.

Had you committed me, commanded me, or entreated me; and thereupon I had gone,
and been caught in my own net, yet had I been delivered from a worse, and of
two evils the less is to be chosen, for thereby the pretended power of the
House of Lords over me (even in its very formality) had been utterly routed;
and my self absolutely cleared from their prerogative Bondage. But at that
time you were not aminded to do it, but left me to their Lordships Arbytrary
power.

But now Sir, I would not have you think from these demands of mine, that I
would be subject to an arbitrary power more in you then in the other, for truly
in those demands there was tacitly couched a supposition of that which I knew
could not be granted, and therefore I was the freer in my proposal thereof,
having an assurance that they would never be granted, yet I thought I would
make trial, but and if I had been imprisoned thereon, after I had given their
Lordships that Fob, you should have heard from me with a witness; for I cannot
suffer oppression and be silent.

Sir excuse my prolixity about this matter, for by reason of the rarity and the
common condemnation thereof, I have therefore the more enlarged my self, for
the better removal of all scruple thereon. Now Sir I shall further acquaint
you with the mutual proceedings betwixt the Goalers and me, and judge
indifferently and impartially betwixt us.

Thus Sir, as I have told you, having declared my set resolution to my
attendant Goalers, away I was borne to the Boat, and when I was landed at
Blackfriars, they would have forced me along up the hill on my feet, yea,
they entreated me, but at that time I was not minded to be their DRVDG, or to
make use of my feet to carry the rest of my body to the Goal, therefore I let
them hang as if they had been none of my own, or like a couple of farthin
Candles dangling at my knees, and after they had dragged me in that admire-able
posture a while, the one took me very reverently by the head, and the other as
reverently by the feet, as if he had intended to have done Homage to His
Holinesses great Toe, and so they carried me: but truly Sir, I laughed at the
conceit in my sleeve. But this their reverend usage did not continue long, for
they grew rerie irreverend and deboyst of a sudden, for ever when they were a
little weary, they let my body fall upon the stones, and then again most
vallarrouslie like men well appointed for the Cause, they took me by the head
and shouldiers, and just as if I had been a dead Dog, they dragged and trayl'd
my body upon the stones, and without all reverence to my cloth, drew me through
the dirt and mire, and plucked me by the hair of the head, just as if the John
of all Sir John's had got little Martin by the feathers, notwithstanding the
peoples several exclamations against their inhumane incivility and tyranny
toward me, and their several desires to carry me in a Chair: And indeed ^n
case I had been legallie their prisoner, yet had they no authority, to keep
me in evil custody, incivilie or inhumanely to use me, but were bound only
to keep me in safe custody, and therein to use me like a man, and therefore in
case they would not have so honored me, as to have made me a Chairman, they
might have carried me in a Porters Basket, or in a Cart, (provided it had not
been Westward) or in some other such decent necessary Tool, And in this like
unheard of barbarous manner they brought me into the lower room in Newgate;
called the Lodge, and there they threw me down upon the Bords, and having Sir
Edward Cooks 2. part instit. upon Magna Charta the Mr. Briscoe offered to
wrest it out of my hands: Then I demanded of him if he intended to rob me, and
he told me he would have it from me whether I would or no.

To whom I replied, that he should not, if to the utmost of my power I could
preserve it from him, and I would do my utmost, where upon I clapped it in my
Arms, and I laid my self upon my belly, but by force, they violently turned
me upon my back then Briscoe (just as if he had been staving off a Dog from the
Bear) smote me with his fist, to make me let go my hold, whereupon as loud as
I could, I cried out, murder, murder, murder. And thus by an assault they
got the great Charter of Englands Liberties and Freedoms from me; which I
labored to the utmost of power in me, to preserve and defend, and ever to the
death shall maintain, and forth with without any warrant poor Magna Charta was
clapped up close prisoner in Newgate, and my poor fellow prisoner derived of the
comfortable visitation of friends: And thus being stripped of my armor of
proof, the Charter of my legal Rights, Freedoms, and Liberties, after the
aforesaid barbarous manner they hurried me up into the common Goal, and as
they carried me up stairs, as their custom is, when they bring in a fellon,
they gave 3. knocks at the door, and so they cast me into that Goal as a
fellon, and then because they would be sure I should have a pair of
prerogative letters, they clapped 2. great Irons with a Chain betwixt them upon
my legs, and I Will assure you, Sir, me thought they were the comlyest gingling
Spurs that ever I wore in my life, and if your worship will be but pleased to
travel with me to the Land of Liberty, come but and take horse at Newgate, and
you shall be furnished I Will warrant you, after the gallan^est manner, and if
need be for the conduct, we ca^ raise up the Trained Bands of Newgate, even
thousands, and ten thousands of lice to guard you: which indeed and in truth
may too soon be the general portion of all the best Members in the House, if
you be not active, vigulant, and faithful to your friends.

And in those Irons I continued that night and till the next day at evening,
and then Woleston the vice Master Jailer of Newgate sent to me by one of his
substitute Goalers, the Turn-key, to speak with me below, to whom I returned
this answer, go tell your master that I do not owe him so much service, as to
come down to him to speak with him in Irons, he knows well enough where I am,
if he have any business with me let him come and speak with me, and he came
again, and again, with the like message; and I returned the same answer: in
the mean time one of his underling Goalers asked me if I would pay for my
Irons, and then they should be knocked off, but I told him, I neither set him a
work to knock them on, neither would I set him a work to knock them off, and he
that sets you a work let him pay you your wages, for you shall not have a
farthen of me, then departing and as I conceive, acquainting Woelston
therewith, he returned again with his hammer in his hand, and told me, he must
knock them off, and so he did. And when I came down to Woleston, he would needs
have made me believe, that I sent to speak with him, and to desire him to take
off my Irons, and to be removed to the Masters side again; but I told him no
such matters, for indeed that was far from me, in thought, word, or deed: for
I scorn to crouch or debase my Spirits to the lawless cruelty of any
merciless tyrants or Goalers whatsoever: they may devour my Carkase, and make
that bend and break with their cruelty, but I trust in God, that in heart and
action to the umost of my power in the pursuance of justice and truth, I shall
bid defiance to the last gasp of breath to all their oppressions and tyrannios
whatsoever.

Now Sir, having discovered their oppressions and grievances against me, I
shall now make bold to present this honorable Committee with the salvage and
barbarous inhumanity exercised upon my Wife, and upon the rest of my Family:
Thus then be pleased further to consider, that those Norman
Prerogative-Invaders, have not been herewith content thus to rob me in
particular of my just liberty and freedom, and for these six months to
incarcerate and corrode my person in their prerogativedevouring jaws of
Newgate, but to fill up the measure of their iniquity against me, they send
forth their Bloodhounds, the Bishops old Catch-poles, the Master and Wardens
of the Company of Stationers, to surprise my wife and my brother, and to bring
them up to their Prerogative-Barre, who for refusing to be entangled and
enslaved to their High Commission Star-chamber-bondage of catching
Interrogatories, were both upon the sixth of this instant January 1646.
committed by them to Mayden-lane-prison. But being not therewith content, the
next day, without all remorse or compassion over my helpless children, just as
if they had intended to destroy me root and branch, they send forth their
Catch-poles again to my house to fetch away my Brother-in-law, and my sister
(his wife) which, for their present necessity, were forced to live with me, and
only remained for the oversight, ordering and tendance of my three children
in the absence of their Father and Mother. But he being out of the way; and she
by the great mercy of God, escaping their hands, (through their ignorance of
her face) fled, and hid her self, and some adjacent neighbors (touched with
compassion and pity over the poor, afflicted, destitute, helpless children)
took them, for the present, into their houses; and so, Father, Mother,
Children, and All, being driven out of House and home, the Doors were shut up;
and I, and mine, exposed to utter ruin and confusion by those insulting,
domineering, merciless* Usurpers and Tyrants, The House of Lords.

But here, their most inhumane, tyrannical desires not ceasing, out of the
boundless limits of their orbitrary domination, they issue forth yet another
prerogative order against my wife, not counting it miserable and dishonorable
enough, that she should lie in the Goal at Mayden-lane, but, as much as in
them lies, for ever to obliterate the honor of her modesty, civility, and
chastity; they order, that she shall be cast into the most infamous Goal of
Bride-well, that common Center and receptacle of bauds, whores, and strumpets,
more fit for their wanton retrograde Ladies, then for one, who never yet could
be taxed of immodesty, either in countenance, gesture, words, or action.

Now, this order being brought to her by the City Marshall to command her away
to Bride-well, she thereupon refused (as by Law she was bound, as has been
proved before this Honorable Committee in the case of Lieut: Coll. John
Lilburne, and of mine) to yield in the least manner any subjection or obedience
thereto, but to the utmost testimony of her weak power made opposition and
resistance against it, for in plain downright terms (like a true bred English
woman brought up at the feet of Gamaliel) she told the Marshall that she would
not obey it, neither would she stir after it, so much as to set one leg before
another in attendance thereto: yet, Sir, this rejection and contempt here of
the Lords usurped jurisdiction was not uttered without all due respect and
acknowledgment of your indubitable Authority, for she told him, that if he
brought any Order or Warrant from the House of Commons, she would freely and
willingly yield all humble obedience and subjection thereto, which was as
absolute an evidence of her acknowledgment and submission unto Englands
legitimate lawful authority as the other was of defiance and contempt to all
arbitrary usurpation whatsoever.

Now the Gentleman Jailer hearing her resolution and honest intentions for the
freedoms of her Country, that rather then she would yield any subjection or
connivence to the arbitrary usurpations of any, how great or powerful soever,
she would expose her self to the merciless cruelty of the whole House of
Norman-prerogative tyrants, I say no sooner had this Turky-cock Marshall heard
of her uprightness to the Commons of England, but up he brisled his feathers
and looked as bigg and as bugg as a Lord, and in the height and scorn of
derision (just as if he had been Speaker to the House of Peers protempore) out
he belched his fury and told her, that if she would not go, then she should be
carried in a Porters Basket, or else draged at a Carts Arse.

But she modestly replied that he might do as it seemed good into him, for she
was resolved on her course, but thereat his worship being put into a
prerogative chafe; out he struts in his Arbitrary Fury, as if he would have
forthwith leavied whole Armies, and Droves of Porters and Carr-men, to advance
the poor little harmless innocent woman and her tender Babe to Bridewell:

But going (as I conceive to consult with their Lordships what was best to be
done) he upon his return finding her constant to her honest and just
resolutions, our again he flings in his wonted fury, and finding some of her
friends attending to see the event of the business, he shut them out of the
doors and abused them with infamous scurrilous reproaches, nicknames, and
derisions, with several menacies to imprison them, threatening them to fetch a
warrant to bring them before the now (present pretended illegal) Lord Mayor of
London; but departing in that insolent turbulent chafe, he sent for a couple of
Porters, but when they came to her like honest and discreet men, they told him,
that they would not meddle with a woman that was with child, and had a young
sucking Insant in her Arms, least in so doing they might do that to day which
they might answer for to morrow.

Then the Marshall thinking to bugbear them with the cracking sound of the
House of Lords told them, that the Lords had ordered that she should be carried
to Bridewell: but one of the Porters wisely answered, that their Lordships
Order was for Goalers, and not for Porters to carry her, and for their parts,
they would carry no quick flesh, if he had any dead flesh they would carry it,
and so they departed and left their Lordships prerogative drudgery to their
prerogative vassals.

Then forth again goes this their Lordship: furious Champion with his
prerogative Commission of Array, to raise up new Forces to encounter this weak
woman, and her tender Babe on her breast, and having leavied a Cart for the
prerogative Wars of the House of Peers, which being brought under the conduct
of that most puissant Marshall of London to the prison Gate, the Car-man
hearing what this beleagred woman was, wisely refused to lay any hands on her,
and departed in peace.

Then this grim Phylistin of the House of Peers, being thus deserred of his
foreign forces, mustered up his Life Guard of Goalers servants, or hangmen
Deputies, and therewith resolved to storm her, and advancing to her Chamber
door, first he attempted to circumvent her by his policy with fair,
hypocritical, specious promises of his and their Lordships favor and grace,
in case she should open the door and submit her self, but she slighted his
proffers, and contemned all favor flowing from that most bitter and corrupt
prerogative Fountain.

Whereupon he caused his men to break open the door, and entering her Chamber,
struts toward her like a Crow in a gutter, and with his valiant looks like a
man of mettle assailes her and her Babe, and by violence attempt to pluck the
tender Babe out of her Arms, but she forcibly defended it, and kept it in
despite of his Manhood: then he and Christopher Marshall his brother Sam:
Tolson, and diverse of his servants by the Marshalls Command example and
Authority laid violent hands upon her, and dragged her down the stairs, and in
that infamous barbarous manner, drew her headlong upon the stones in all the
dirt and the mire of the streets, with the poor Infant still crying and
mourning in her Arms, whose life they spared not to hazard by that inhumain
barbarious usage, and all the way as they went, utterly to defame and render
her infamous in the streets, the fellows which dragged and carried her on two
Cudgels, calling her Strumpet and vild Whore, thereby to possess the people,
that she was no woman of honest and godly Conversation, whom they so
barbarously abused, but a vile strumpet or whore, and were dragging to
Bridewell that common shore and sink of Bauds and Whores, etc.

For no man could reasonably imagine that any modest civil woman should be so
shamefully used, especially in her way to Bridewell; which dishonorable
infamous usage was a sufficient matter to blast her reputation for ever, and to
beget such a perpetual odium upon her, that for the future (if ever delivered
from her bondage) she should not pass the streets upon her necessary
occasions any more without cont^mely and derision, scoffing, hissing, and
poynting at her, with such or the like sayings, as, see, see, there goes a
Strumpet that was dragged through the streets to Bridewell, and this is the
honor that their Lordships are pleased to confer on the free Commoners wives
who stand for their Freedoms and Liberties.

A Charg against the house of Lords
Now Sir, I humbly desire this Honorable Committee to consider, whether it be
reasonable or sufferable, or any wise suitable to the freedoms of the Commons of
England, or to the great trust reposed in you, either for you to suffer, or for
them to usurp such an unlimited prerogative jurisdiction, to deprive husbands
of their wives, and wives of their husbands; Fathers and Mothers of their
Children, and Children of their Fathers and Mothers; cast them into several
infamous tormenting prisons, hale and drag in most barbarous manner, the
Commoners wives and their tender Infants upon the stones of the streets
through all the dirt, and the mire, as if the Commoners, their wives and
Children were but as dirt and mire under their Lordships feet, to be trod and
trampled upon at their pleasure; also to reproach, revile, and dishonor
modest, chaste, and civil women with the imputation and scandal of whores,
strumpets, etc. expose whole families to ruin, out them out of house and home,
and instead of pity and compassion over such tender Infants whom they have
made Orphants to their Arbitrary pleasures to turn them (without all remorse
and compunction of heart) to the mercy of the wide world, and not in the least
to look after them, take any charge or care over them, or to send them or
their imprisoned Parents so much as a crum of bread, or a drop of pottage for
their comfort or relief; but as much as in them lies, to expose such tender
innocent babes with their parents to famine for want of sustenance and relief,
as also to send forth their armed men in an hostile manner, with muskets,
swords, pistols, etc. to besett and assault the Commoners Houses; forcibly to
enter their Bed-Chambers with drawn swords, and pistols ready cocked, even
while such persons are in their beds also daily to commit Burglary, flat
felony, break in pieces the Commoners doors, burst open their locks, their
Trunks, Chests, Deskes, etc. pick their pockets, ransacke their houses,
plunder, rob, steal, and felloniously bear away their proper goods and
livelihood, as also to shutt up such as are most faithful for the freedoms of
the Commons of England, close prisoners, deprive them of the benefit of pen,
ink, and paper, of the comfortable countenance and visitation of friends,
tumble and toss them from Goal unto Goal, lay most unreasonable fines upon
them, as of 2000. 1. or the like, ten times beyond the estate of persons so
fined, censure them to seven years imprisonment, endeavor to enforce the
Commoners wives, to dip their hands in the blood of their husbands, and to
betray their friends and faithful lovers of their Country into their
merciless hands, impose oaths upon servants to betray their Masters Councels,
and secrets, imprison, fine, censure, and molest the Commoners of England, for
their vindication and defense of the great Charter of their Liberties, and
freedoms, for appealing from their usurped jurisdiction to the House of Com:
and for refusing to be again entangled in the Star Chamber High Commission
abolished Bondage of Interrogatories and the like; as also for those Lords to
overturne the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, both for liberty, property,
and freedom, endeavoring the Introduction of an Arbitrary Government, and to
crush and destroy all such as shall adventure the discovery of their
oppressions or shall (as legally they are bound) resist their arbitrary
proceedings, stop all free progress in the Law, commit the Compter Sergeants,
and such Ministers of the Law unto prison for arresting their sons or kindred
for debt, and that by the authority of that House, as a contempt offered
thereto. All which insufferable oppressions, and cruelties with manifold
others, I can and will (God permitting) justify and prove to their faces, if I
shall be called thereto. And I do hereby, before this honorable Committee, and
consequently before the whole Commons of England, both represented and
representative, Charge the House of Lords (which usually assemble at
Westminster and which do arrogate unto themselves a Parliamentarie title, and
power without the free election and common consent of the free borne people of
England) with those forementioned usurpations and devastations of the Commoners
Liberties and Freedoms: Which Charge I am ready everyday upon the Peril of my
vital blood to make good against them, for the case of Lieutenant Col. John
Lilhurne, of Mr. Learner, of mine, and of some others, if but duly considered,
is sufficient to evidence and confirm the truth then of to every common
capacity, as also to their Prerogative Lordships everlasting shame and
confusion of face, if not to the utter extirpation of that their unlimited
Arbitrary Domination and power, the which I shall faithfully endeavor to the
utmost of my power for the freedom and weal of the rest of my National
Brethren the free borne Commons of England, though in that hot and desperate
service I, and mine, wife, children and all be devoured by their unreasonable
cruelty.

Thus Sir having made my complaint unto you, and in mine, to this Honorable
Committee, the complaint of the whole Commons of England, all being equally
interrested with me in this contest betwixt the Lords and the Commoners both in
life, limb, liberty, and estate; I present my cause, and in mine, the cause of
the whole Commons of England to your grave and judicious consideration: for,
look what is done unto me or to any other (though never so mean or of
inferior degree) for mine or their vindication and maintenance of the just
Rights and freedoms of the Commons of England, is as done unto the whole
Commons of England, for by those their insultings all as well as one, are made
liable to the unlimited cruelty and oppression of their prerogative
jurisdiction. And if they may rule by prerogative, then farewell all liberty and
property, all Laws, justice, and equity; and if it must be so, I pray you
bear us no longer in suspense and expection of redress, but forthwith let our
Doom be proclaimed to the whole world, that the Commons of England may know
what to trust to; that we may loose our labor no longer in petitioning,
appealing, complaining, and seeking for relief at your hands, that such as
will may sit down as contented slaves with halters about their necks to be
hanged up till the pleasure of that House (forsooth) shall be further signified.

Now Sir, I shall use no other provocations, incitations or Arguments to this
Honorable Committee, to the discharge of their duty, but shall altogether
leave the whole matter hereof to your consciences, whether for justice or
injustice, mercy or cruelty; for my part I care not though you and all men
forsake me, so long as I know the Lord lives, who will once judge every man
according to his deeds, whether good or evel, and then I am sure I shall have
righteous judgment, without respect of persons; and against that, to deprive me
thereof, neither the gates of Hell nor the powers of Earth are able to
prevail; that is my comfort, my hope and support, against all afflictions
cryalls, and troubles: And therefore in that sure confidence though I be thus
enthralled and encompassed on ev^ry sidewith Bands and Aff^ictions, I am
resolved not to yield an haires-bredth of subjection, no, not so much, as the
appearance of subjection either in word or deed to any arbitrary power, orders,
significations of their pleasures, etc. maugre their Prisons, Irons, Halters,
etc. either for me or mine: And this I pronounce to this Honorable Committee
and to the whole Commons of England in open defyance and contempt of the
Arbitrary Domination of the House of Peers, their usurpation and encroachments
over the Rights and freedoms of the Commons of England; come what come will, or
what the utmost of their usurped might and power can inflict upon me for it,

I scorn their mercy, and dare them to do their worst: let them find Prisons,
Dungeons, Irons, Halters, etc. I Will find Carkesse, Neck, and Heels, for one in
contempt to their usurped jurisdiction; for resolved I am to break before I
bend to their oppressions, etc. Sir I am

From Newgate the place of my Prerogative Captivity. Feb. 1. 1647. Yours and
all men's for their just Rights and Freedoms, faithful, to the death. Richard
Overton.

FINIS.
