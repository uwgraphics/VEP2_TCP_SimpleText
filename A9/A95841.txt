it be fit or lawful for a good Man, to beat his bad Wife. Some Mysteries of
Iniquity are likewise unmasked, and a little unfolded. A Subject, to some,
perhaps, as unwelcom as uncoth. (Art thou he that troubles Israel?

TO THE READER.
I Had long since learned to read or speak English, and that of the
revealed-written Word of God; but could never yet attain (with some) an
acceptable Idiom, utterance or pronouncing of it, how carefully or heartily
soever I endeavored it. It gained me so little Ear and Credence, that (by
like) it was not current; so that I am (at length) constrained to put it upon
the public Touch and Trial: and here thou have an Essay or Taste of it.

There falls but little for an Epistle or Preface, save a few Directions and
Reasons to facilitate or further thy reading; all other Occurrents being
comprised in the first or last Chapter of the Book. Of which (All) I can expect
no fairer Construction from any, then the Conceptions and Expressions, appear
gall-less, ingenuous, and guided by the Word and Reason.

Briefly, for the Book it self: It will be found, rather a strait and
compendious Paraphrase then a laxed Discourse. For, laboring that Conciseness,
with Fullness and Plainness, which I do justly (as I think) affect in others;
I have thronged both the Text and Comment as thou see; which if it seem
retardable to thy reading, let not that discourage or divert thee: For if thou
proposest either Profit or pleasure to thy self therein, thou shall nor be
utterly unsatisfied. If thy Progress be flower, it will be so much the surer;
thou shall fasten the Scripture-Phrases in thy Memory, and find large and
delightful matter of Meditation. For, indeed the Marginall Quotations, though
least in show, are most in substance, solidity and sweetness (a fit
Hieroglyphick of all spirituall-heavenly things) the Margin presenting thee the
Meat, the Page but the Sauce, which (probably) cannot please all Palats Besides
(for both our sakes) I could not have thee ( Truant-like) to take any thing on
trust; but (like the Acts 17.11.
noble Bereans) lay it to the rule, search and try whether these things be so,
and censure not before thou see I hope this may invite or occasion some (even
out of curiosity) to become better acquainted with the Bible, and be caught in
Mat. 4.19. L. 5.10.
Christ's net before they be aware. And the honestly ingenious will easily judge
it my main end, even throughout to drive or d^rect to the pure Fountain, and
not to detain thee longer then needs, in the muddy Channels of these shallow
lines. Howbeit I can well approve, that thou first read over the Tract by it
self, to acquaint thee with the Scope (I am fain to lead thee the way, in
another respect) and the second time (and thereafter) to take along with thee
the Texts and Proofs: which are neither so many as to sundry Points, might have
been produced; nor yet so few as to leave any needful Truth naked of (mostly)
several Testimony; that so in the Deu. 19.15. Mat. 18.16. Jo. 8.17. 2 Co. 13.1.
Mouths of (at least) two or three witnesses, every Word may be established.
Where I had most plenty under my hand, and saw them swell the Margin, I
expunged or dismissed a few, and was minded to do more. But finding all so
precious; and none (as I conceived impertinent, I was (at last) loath to part
with any of these; and so let all pass: the rather because some Proofs to one
may seem less pregnant; to another, more: here is therefore choice and of the
choicest (I hope) the scripture yields: As also that unto these, as to a Common
Place, my self as well as others, may have recourse on such occasions.

And let it not be nauseous to any, Isa. 28.10.13.
if he meet with one Text in several places (which yet is not frequent) since,
we know, many such there be, whereof the same may serve to sundry good Proofs
and purposes. Some Scripture-Phrases, falling compactly, are inter-woven with
the discourse; the rest (of equal weight, though differing in words) are
referred to the Margin.

It is to be noted, That the names God or Christ, are mutually and
indifferently used throughout in relation to the Church: The reasons whereof
are plain to the pious, by Psalm. 31.5. Isa. 9.6. and 54.5. Joh. 10.30. Romans
5.8. Col. 2.9,10. and many like.

I rather affect and use the word Scripture, (yea the Word it self) singularly
for eminence sake, because it is now a Rev. 22.18.19.
complete, perfect, individual Body; and was not exactly so, when the Lord
Jesus, his Apostles and others in those Times, plurally termed it Scriptures.

If any thing chance to be touched in several parts, (as, Gods Eternity, etc.)
the Proofs are referred to the first, and that expressly, for ease of the weaker
sort, who will be loath to seek them too far.

I have desired to draw as many Proofs and Confessions as I could, from
Adversaries of God and Godliness, as tending to greater Deu. 32.31. 1 K.
20.40.42. Mat. 12.27. L. 19.22. Jo. 5.45. To. 2.1. Jo. 8.54.
Conviction and Confirmation: therefore none needs to stumble at them.

The style is nothing lofty, but low and professedly humble to all Men; not
ambitious of equipage with any; yet assuming that familiar Decorum which (I
hope) may beseem the Husband to the Wife, at whose information this chiefly
aims.

If any Term seem obscure to the common sort, let it be excused thus: 1. That,
for ease of all, I labored Brevity: Much Matter may sometime be couched in a
Word. 2. That one Word is often suited to sundry Texts, and must bear the sense
of them all. The best way for such therefore is, to examine the Texts, which
will clearly interpret and explane it.

But I have need (I confess) to beg the candid and christian Forbearance (or
rather Furtherance) of All, in this Birth. It is, indeed, my Firstborn; Genesis
49.3.
but I cannot say of it, as Jacob of his son Reuben; for it is a mere Embryon
and Abort, wanting many of its due Months; Insomuch as being unacquainted with
the Press, I was fearful to offer it a Piece so unprepared.

And, truly, how curt and compendious soever this Treatise may seem, I found it
so vast and copious in the Contrivall, that I had some reluctance in my self
about the Proceeding. And (its no dissembling before the searcher of Hearts)
could I have foreseen the length or difficulty of the (seeming little) Way; or
had I not in the way felt a stronger Impulse and better Faculties then my own,
to direct and drive me forward; I had fainted and fallen off; yea, laid me down
quite discouraged in the sense of my Imbecility. But my good Shepherd, Jo.
10.14.
who best knows how to deal with Lambs; Isa. 40.11.
and those that are with Young, was both so wise as to conceal it from me, and
so gracious as to lead me on along with some Ease and Alacrity. While thus
sensible of Divine Assistance, I stirred up my self to a little more
Elaboration; and feeling a daily confluence of new-fresh Forces and Supplies, I
grew ashamed to think of Lagging or Lassitude; and (at length somewhat confirmed
as I conceived) was loath to leave Place, either for just Objection, or future
Exercise of my own in the Point here disputed. And now, although (the Lord
knows) I am confcious of but little knowledge in my self, (less then the least
of Saints) yet somewhat more it is then Satan wishes me, or would persuade me
that I have; as You Will hear anon.

This slender Piece then, being in such Manner as God pleases, accomplished; I
have no cause of doubt, but some ground of Hope, that (in Point of Knowledge, at
least) it will further some, confirm others, and offend none that fear God, nor
be slighted of any as unconcerned; since no (married) Man dares profess but
that he ought to know thus much and much more.

In short. May thou enjoy the Profit, Pleasure and Comfort, of that which I
have collected, not without some Pains and Perplexity. The Body may be
enthralled, the Mind and thoughts cannot; 2 Timothy 2.9.
much less can the Word of God be bound.

CHAP. I. AN Introduction, touching the Occasion of this Discourse.
IT has been as little suspected by my self, as expected by any other the
Natives of this Nation, that I should undergo the Press; especially on so
sudden and sad Occasion. And I have even trembled to think, that the mighty
Creator of the world, who is Deu. 4.24. and 9.3. Heb. 12.29.
a consuming fire, who rendeth, shakes, and throws down the Nah. 1.6.
Rocks, 1 K. 19.11.
Mountains, yea the Ps. 18.7. Isa. 13 13. Joel 3.16. Hag. 2.6.
whole Earth and Heavens, and Ezr. 38.20.
what not? should Isa. 41.2.
call to his foot, a despicable poor worm, and not crush him in pieces, rather
then set him on work: Or that the living and dreadful God, should look upon 2
S. 9.8.
a dead dog without utter distaste and abhorrence. But when I consider what he
says, who Number. 23 19. 1 S. 15.29. Tit. 1.2.
cannot lie; That as he is the Isa. 57.15. Job 36.5. Ps. 113.5,6. and 138.6.
high and lofty one inhabiting Eternity, so he dwells with him also that is
of an humble and contrite spirit, that To. 4.17.
quickneth the dead, and calls those things which be not, as though they
were: that 1 Co. 1.27,28. Mat. 11.25.
has chosen the foolish, weak, base, despised things of the World, to confound
the wise and mighty, that Ps. 8.2. Mat. 21.16.
out of the mouths of babes, and sucklings, yea L 19.40.
from stones, can extract and perfect his praise, it being the glory of his
highest Power to shine forth in the 2 Co. 12.9.
lowest weakness, and his good pleasure ( I hope) not only to Ps. 103.14.
Heb. 2.16.17.
pity and Deu. 32.73. Isa. 26.12. and 40.11.
support my frailty, but to wink at my filthiness, and Isa. 4.4. and 6.5,6 7.
Ez. 16.6,8,9. Jo. 13.8.
wash me from it.

I have, (in these respects) taken the humble and bashful boldness, (as under
the Ps. 61.4.
Covert and Ps. 36.7.
shadow of his Wings, imploring the constant Presidence and direction of Neh.
9.20.
his good spirit) to present what is promised. In pursuance whereof, I may
profess, as in his Presence, to whose eyes, 1 Chapter 28.9. and 29.17. Job. 42.2.
Ps. 2.7.9. and 44.21. Pro. 17.2. Jer. 17.10. To. 8.27. 1 Th. 2.4. Rev. 2,23.
all hearts Heb. 4.13.
all Things are naked and opened. That what I shall here express, is principally
to show forth his sacred Authority and mine Integrity under it. And if the
deviations or obliquities of others must needs light in my way, I shall touch
as tenderly on them as is possible, with some few Inferences for pious and
public use and caution.

This first Chapterand the last may be termed a Prooemium and Appendix to this
Discourse. And if any demand why These? or why Thus? and not together ward,
either before or after. I answer, 1. I am confident they will be found fit and
needful. 2. It may suffice to know, that they appear in such Order, as they
were suggested or occurred to me.

I entreat that none expect a terse, polite or methodicall Piece; but take All.
1. As a few brief, and confused Notions, prompted for present satisfaction,
defense and comfort, amidst Obloquy, Oppression and Distraction; wherein it
concerned me now and then, to cast an eye at the waking Malice and Rage of 2
Th. 3.2.
unreasonable Men; and therefore where any Pleonasms appear, be pleased to pass
over them with Patience. 2. As a crosse-unwelcome Parenthesis, (to a more
pleasing, not profane Employment) whereon I confess, I tarry all the while as
on thorns, which will permit no long nor easy Pausure: howbeit the ingenious
may easily spell the Meaning at spare times. I am assured of the candid
Construction of good Christians; and for my petulant-censorious Adversaries, if
(in their opinions) I bewray either Lunacy or Levity, I must accuse those
erraticas Stellas, or Ignes fatuos, for leading me out of my Way.
Nevertheless, (upon the main) if the revealed Word of God be sure, I am not
far excentric. However, if I shall be convinced, (either by any readers
Judgment or my own) of ought amiss, I promise Amendment, as God affords
intelligence and opportunity.

No question, but I am concluded a married man, and to have tasted some sour,
not all the sweet of Wedlock; and not far amiss. Ps. 55.12,13,14.
For it was not an enemy that reproached me, then could I have born it, neither
was it he that hated me, that magnified himself against me, then I would have
hid myself from him. But it was thou, a man, mine Equal, my Guide, and mine
acquaintance. We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the House of God
in company. Nay, not only so, neither, but it was Thou, mine own Flesh, that
have insulted; whose rage has not rested here, but has Isa 37.28.
reached up to heaven, and 1 S 17.26.36. 1 Th. 4.8.

living God.

I trust there is none of the Ephesians. 2.19. and 3.15.
genuine-true Family, that expects so much as a summary representation of all
the sad Occuraences or Ez. 4.2.
Engines of Assault and Slight, in a ten-years siege; much less, a ruthful
complaint or bemoaning of a laesa or victa patientia, (which hardly holds Plea
in Foro Christi though mutually passable among Fellow Christians, conscious of
common frailty, and) which is no further conquered or won upon then thou see.
My meaning and hope is, That none looks for an Genesis 9.22,23.
Ham-like, (or more horrid) discovery of conjugall Deformities or Infirmities,
but will rather be ready with Shem and Japhet to cover and conceal them. There
are 2 S. 1.20.24.
Daughters of the Philistines, as well as of Israel, there are also Isa 28.1.
Drunkards of Ephraim. And if the best men, and things, be spoken or acted
against by some that (should) sit in the Ps 69.12.
Gate; how shall the Meaner and less worthy escape the song of the Drunkards?
it is enough and too much to publish, that the last Decade of my life has been
extremely embitter'd (not with hard Bondage or Servitude; I needed not endure
it, but) with constantly tempestuous-windy Weather; save for some lucida
Intervalla, wherein mortals must needs Quod caret alterna requie, etc.
rest (for none but Devils themselves are Job 1.7. 1 P. 5.8.
restless) or when I enjoyed the Calm of another Climat. I returned, Jer.
14.19.
I looked and waited for Peace, and there was no good for the time of Healing,
and behold Trouble.

One instance may serve instar omnium. The Rev. 12.10 Job 2.3r.
Accuser of the Brethren (for him alone do I criminate) that Genesis 3.1. Job 41
1,34. Isa. 27.1 2 Co. 11.3. Rev. 12.9. and 20.2.
old serpent has laid at lurch a long time under the ground or latet anguis,
etc.
grass; and at length, having (it seems) perfected his Artifice, rusheth out
like a roaring Lion, and proclaims me Madman. And thus was the matter. Within
two or three of twenty years ago, it pleased Isa. 54.5.
our Husband Christ, to afflict me with an hot and horrid Fever, for a long
season, which brought me to deaths door Being much of that time under the
torrid zone, no mervail if I learned a little of the Natives Language,
(Barbarism, Neh. 13.24.
half Ashdod) and that my Actions were answerable (yet if I be not flattered,
they were far short of the high strains, I have heard related of others in like
Case) I never had in my life, much less was it like I should then have any
great judgment or mind of Phlebotomy or Incision; and because in the Heat of
my Sickn^sse, I would not yield (forsooth, to be blooded without binding my
Arms, my said grand Accuser then (my too diligent Attendant) lays it in my
Dish, and will needs have me bound to be a Madman whilst I live. 1 K. 18.27.
Risum teneatis?

By like (Satan) no drop of my Blood fell to thy share, nor ever shall. Where
thou Jo. 13.27,28,30 Act. 5.3.9.
winnest upon any, thou art not wont to prate so much, there is nothing but Isa.
28.15. Jer. 6.14. Pro. 7.13. to 23.
Peace and Pleasure: thy rooms are all and always, as ready swept and
garnished for such Guests, as Mat. 12.44.
theirs for thee. Let me expostulate with thee a little: was not Hos. 7.1. etc.
Ephraim more dangerously diseased then with a Fever, yet he kicked against
his Cure, and Hos. 11.3.
was healed he knew not by whom or how. Will thou not (yet thou must) allow
Gods dearest Children a little reluctance against the rod. Our sweet Savior,
thy severe Judge, and master, Job 24.12. and 42.7,8. Ja. 5.11.
winks at it; witness that holy Innocent whom thine Job. 1.12. etc. 2.7.
hellish malice tormented. Because thou art Jude. 6.
reserved in everlasting Chains under darkness, to the Judgment of the great
Day, for 2 Th. 1.8.
flaming Fire; cannot I or my Brethren, by the power of our Redeemer, Isa. 43.2.
pass through the waters, and not be overflown? walk through the Fire (hotter
then a Fever) and not be burnt? neither the flame kindle on us? But I bare,
and Mic. 7.9. Job 19.5,6. Ps. 39.9. Isa. 30.15.1 S. 3.18.
will bear his indignation, because I have sinned against him, have repented
and am parden'd: Mat. 25.41. Rev. 20.10.
thou shall abide eternal Fire, for thy fore passed, fatal, and final
Defection, and can neither repent,- nor rid thy self; that is Ps. 49.8
ceased from thee for ever.

But my memory, though then sore shaken and enseebled, is yet (it seems) more
faithful then thine. Thou might have charged more and grosser Absurdities
in that Sickness, then this, upon me. As that in the Waning and Languor or my
spirit, I forgot and refused to know my best Friends; yea, once mistook my
Physician (whom God made an Instrument of my Recovery) for thee, beside many
other Feats, the effects of Sickness. But this (belike) was thy best and last
Project, [thy Master-piece] to talk of my Binding, that I might be taken and
kept bound [for so thou threatnedst] from binding thee: But it needed not; My

trust) thou shall find and feel. Thou remembrest, also, That when I have cited
and urged the sacred Scripture for Edification or good Ends (which thou art not
wont to do) thou have slily retorted it saying, the Devil could allege
Scripture. Its true thou can; but never affect, observe or obey it. I allow
also, that thou; L. 4.41. M. 1.24. Ja. 2.19.

temporary Accuser and Adversary, so art thou doomed for the eternal Object of
Gods fiery Indignation, and to Court thee in thine own Complement, Thou hear
me well enough.

I should here address a Word or two to my Physician whom I have not seen
these many years. Howbeit he has already some intimation, that I have laid
a-bleeding under his helpless hand, and I thought to salute him a little more
largely, but this (perchance) may save that labor. He has a deep share in
this Occasion, he knows what he has done, and what he has to do: for he is a
pretending Physician as well for soul as body, and so I leave him L. 4.23.

living can show me more Infirmities and Failings in me, then my self do see,

Tyrant, but on Terms dishonorable to God, disadvantagious and discomfortable to
my self, I am resolved still to keep him at the staffes end and to stand See p.

on my best bottoms.

This recited Passage was not the sole and pro^er (though most specious) Ground
of Quarrel: there are diverse other known and no less impious Pretenses, but it
was the fairest and largest Livery Cloak mine Accuser had to color and cover
the rest; it was (it may be, causa sine qua non.) In brief, take all together
thus: That for a moderate use of the Power and Liberty which the Laws of God
and man have entrusted to me to procure (if it might be) a godly oeconomicall
Quiet, I have been treated (I lap it in my cleanest linen) as a Perturber of
the public Peace. Wherein I have no reason to complain of Hardship at the
Hands of men: For besides that the causes of my sufferings, are grown of a
wider Notion then I could wish; God has also bountifully restored and
distilled his Refreshments into my Bosom. I do gladly therefore draw the
Curtain, as well before Court- as Chamber-Proceedings.

mine Incentive lay in the later, and was chiefly This; That, since I began to
heed or listen to Scripture Language, I could hear Many, (but mostly Women)
occasionally to allege, That 1 P. 3.7.
Men ought to dwell with their Wives according to Knowledge: that is, (I
presume, I much mistake not) pleasingly or patiently: Good Properties both.
And, (which came a little nearer me) when of late I addressed my self (not
unbidden) before Authority, and thought to make some Christian Advantage of one
of their Chaplains, my quondam Acquaintance; He abstained from owning (in any
degree acceptable) so gross an Offender, either in or out of that To. 13.4.
dreadful Presence. His Reasons, if not expressed by himself, may be imagined
by others. He had only the Leisure and Patience to school me (as above) with
The Husband must dwell, etc. (his meaning was not very hard to apprehend) And
(not remembering belike, that Mal. 2.7. Deu. 17.9,10,11.
the Priests lips are as well to communicate as to keep Knowledge) was, and is,
content to leave me as ignorant as he found me; although I have since, also,
saluted and solicited him by Letter (whereof I am informed, he made more then a
Pastoral use) humbly offering either to satisfy or submit unto the Church. And
it may be added, (not altogether unfitly) That I, likewise, submisly proposed
something in this kind, to them of Power, Wisdom, and Experience; whose Reply
was short and suitable to their Place, Job 32.9.
but nothing satisfactory to my Doubt or Quaere.

The Confluence (I say) of these, and other like Motives, caused me first Ps.

to examine mine own Heart, and then stirred me up to study the Point for my
fuller Information; the Pursuance whereof has forcibly produced these public
Expresses both of my Quality and Conceptions; which, with all humbleness, I
submit to judicious, christian and charitable Censure. And I come now within
view of our expected Port of Knowledge: But ere I arrive at it, somewhat would
be premised, touching the Scripture, the Genesis 1.26,27. Jo. 5.39. 1 T. 3.16 Isa.

CHAP. II. The Certainty, Truth, Authority, Consent, and other peculiar
Excellencies of the sacred Scripture.
BEcause our Husbands Authority is grounded on the Word of God, and that we are
to deal, especially, with divine Texts and Truths; It were first to be wished,
That all sorts of People were satisfied of the Truth and Authority of the
Scripture; for to some, even the plain written Word of God is no prevailing
Proof; wherein, it is doubtful, consists a great part of the Weakness of some
of the weaker Vessels. Very needful therefore, it is, that such were convinced
of This; That the Deu. 8.3. Ps. 119 89. Mat. 4.4. L. 4.4. Heb. 1.3. 1 Jo. 5.7.

And here (before we pass further) its not unfit to be noed, that (albeit there

special Cases, yet) the Phrases of holy Scripture referring to former Times
and Prophesies, and running on this wise, viz. As L. 1.70. Acts 3.18. and 4.25.

he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets, as it Mat. 2.23. and 3.3. and
21.4. M. 13.14 L. 24.25. Acts 13.40. 2 P. 3.2.
was spoken by the Prophets, and the like, are indifferently to be understood,
as well of the Word written, as spoken. This is easily apparent, by comparing 2
Co. 10.11. 2 P. 1.20,21. 2 Th. 2.15.
the sacred Writ with it self, which ascribes speaking of Scripture, sometime
to Acts 1.16. and 28.25.

the Scripture it self (Examples of this sort are so many and obvious, that a
few may serve here) And our own common Practice (if need were) confirms it
also; these Words being usual with us in Writing, viz. As I said before, or As
aforesaid, etc. while we (plainly) hear no Word spoken, but see it only
Written. And we cannot otherwise conceive of the Scripture, unless (which were
horrible to think) the Words of our blessed Savior (who never Mat. 7.29. M. 1.
22. Jo. 5.30. and 7.46. and 8.16.
spoke, Jo. 11.42.
prayed, nor Mat. 12.18. M. 1.11. L. 3.22. Jo. 15.16. and 16.23,24. and 17.24.

the World: and again, Jo. 17.20.
I Pray not for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me
through their Word. For He knew better then Any, and Mat. 24.9. and 23.34. L.

so vast a Peragration and Task, as (viva voce) to teach all Nations. Nor meant
he, therefore, any longer to accompany them carnally or corrorally here on
Earth (for they were, even then, Ph. 1.23. 2 T. 4.6,7. 2 P. 1.13,14.

Pastonrs, the Teachers thereof, while the World endures. Now, had their Word
rested in, and expired with their vive or vocal Expression (the Article of
their natural Breath) how should any People or Persons far distant, or future,
who were never like to see or hear them) either believe, or benefit ought
thereby? And to clear this unto us, We see the Lord Jesus expressly sets on Work
his beloved Apostle John (as doubtless he did implicitly and virtually the
rest) bidding him Rev. 1.11,19. see 2 P. 3.1,2.
Write what he sees, has seen, and shall be hereafter in a Book. I say,
therefore, we are to conclude, all such Phrases to signify and intend as well
the written as vocal Word of God. And that all the Writings of these holy Men
before mentioned, being (by divine Providence, and faithful Hands) collected
into One just Volume, are the same which we have in common (not so careful or
conscionable) Use, and in way of Eminency, do call To. 1.2. 2 T. 3.15.
The holy Scriptures, and might as justly term them, Ps. 119.142,160 Pro.

It may be hoped, there are not many incredulous in this Point; yet such as be
are earnestly recommended to those Orthodox Divines and Writers who have fully
cleared it: for the recital would take up too much room in this narrow
Treatise. But we take and use it (as indeed it is) for that undoubted Rule of
Verity by which with influence of the Spirit of God alone, we are to be Isa.

everlastingly doomed hereafter. Nevertheless, because those Tracts are not
ready at hand to All, these brief Considerations (for the present) may
something sway the Mind of the Doubtful, and convince the Truth hereof, as

1. Its on all hands gladly granted, (by those that bear the name of
Christians) That eternal Life and Felicity is to be looked after, and is only
attainable by the Knowledge of God in Jesus Christ. This cannot surely be
through brain-fancies and airy Notions, and therefore some direct and regular
Job 23.11.
Way must needs lead thereunto. To confirm this (if Scripture can do it,)
compare Jo. 5.39. with Jo. 17.3.
None can know or learn the way to God, but by God teaching the Truth; This
Truth cannot be known to Any without Christ, nor Christ without his revealed
Word and Will; and What can be so probable and fair a Manifest hereof as these
holy Scriptures; which, for All this is obvious to any seeing and single eye.
Purity and Perduration, Impartiality and Majesty, Profundity and (yet)
perspicuous and pleasing Facility, do excel and eclipse all other Writings in
the World.

2. Christ bids us 1 Jo. 4.1, etc.
try the Spirits: and if He did not, Equity and Reason would evince it: For we
know, that One Spirit may be as errone ous as another, and some so deeply and
dangerously, that they shall Mat 24.24. M. 13.22. 1 T. 4.1. Rev. 16.14.
go near to deceive the very Elect; if every Spirit may be his own Moderatour
and Judge; and therefore no doubt but Ez. 34.17. To. 16.2.
the Lord Paramount, Number. 16.22. and 27.16.
the God, and Heb. 12.9.
Father of Spirits, intended and appointed some determinative Rule of Trial,
in case of 1 K. 22.20. L. 9.55.
dissent or difference 'twixt Spirit and Spirit: and what may we imagine (under
the Sun) a truer Touchstone herein then the Scripture we treat of?

3. Although by Gods absolute unrevealed Will all things were made, yet are
they not preserved, ruled, or directed, without his conditionate and revealed
Will. For if there be not such a supreme, directive, restrictive Providence,
Why does not each One live as they list? (which the most desperate Wretch dares
not profess to do) Why is not every Jud. 7.22. 1 S. 14 20. 2 S. 2.16.
Man's sword in his fellows side? Certainly, then, he ordained a Vicegerence and
subordinate Government here on Earth, and to this End, is that Expression (if
we believe Scripture) Den. 30.11, etc. Joh. 6.45,46.
This Commandment is not hidden from thee; neither is it far off, etc. It would
be judged an absurd Presumption to trouble a supreme earthly Magistrate with
every trifling Trespass or breach of Peace, (in this he would easily incline to
imitate Ex. 18.21,22.
Jethro's Counsel to Moses, yea to desire God's Indulgence Number. 11.14,15,17.
as Moses did) and shall we dare to think God either less Ex. 19.12,13,23 and

ours (as we may call it; though the sole, or chief Actor in us) is (1 Co.

feebleness of our life, by the fast or slow Beating (as we term it) of our
Pulse, the Motion of our animal Spirit. Just thus is it with the written Word (
Ez. 1.12,20. 2 Co. 3.3.
or Works) and Spirit of God: yet with this Difference, That the Spirit of God
unspeakably and inconceivably Job 32.8. Isa. 38.16.

as the Wind, blows where it lusts, and Eccl. 11.5.

So then, while this written Word is but offered, accepted, and eyed, as a
dead Letter, no mervail it be so much neglected and so little operative as it
is. And (certainly) till we feel some beating, or motion of this Divine Pulse
in or upon it, we may sadly conclude, our selves to be ( Ephesians. 2.1,5. Jo 14.17.
1 Co. 2.14.
spiritually) as dead as the Letter, or Jo. 11.39.
Lazarus his Body. For, as our Spirit is the life of our Body, so is the Spirit
of Christ the Job 32.8. Psalm 36.9. and 66.9. and 119.175. Isa. 38.16. Jo.
14.17. Acts 17.24.25. To. 8. 2,10. 1 Co. 2.4. Col 3.3.
life both of our Spirit and of the Letter.

Much less may this written Word avail any thing, either to enliven,
enlighten, or lead us, whilst it lies by us unused, neglected, contemned as a
Moth-eaten Clout (not of so much account with many.) And therefore, to the
attaining of the spirituall-saving Knowledge here treated, there belongs a
serious, studious, and diligent search. The Heb. 2.10.
Captain of our Salvation, our most curious and faithful Number. 13.2,30. and
14.6,7,8,9.
spy and discoverer of the holy Land, sets us in the ready way. Jo. 5.39. Isa.
8.20. 2 P. 1.19.
Search the Scriptures (says he; which even ye Jews, ye Scribes and
Pharisees, account infallible, impartial Guides to your eternal life and
felicity) for they are they that testify of me; who alone, am that most
precious permanent Pearl and Possession, worth Search and seeking after, which
they point at; yea, am their proper-inseparable Subject and Substance. And, for
our Incitement and Example, we see himself did, L. 4.16,17,21,22.
customarily preach and practice out of them. They were his own Mat. 4.4,7,10.

To this end, we often hear him, and his Worthies, the blessed Apostles and
other Saints (sometimes in a repugnant, sometime in a persuasive way) producing
and alleging Scripture, viz. Mat. 2.5. L. 24.46.

through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures, we might have Hope,

But yet, without Search (it seems) no finding, no Profit: This rich
Inheritance, this precious Treasure, this pleasant Fruit drops not into our
hands or mouths, without earnest Desire, assiduous Industry, constant
vigilance, careful Endeavor. Surely, to be Acts 18.24.
mighty (that is Acts 18.25,26,27,28.
powerful as well as prompt and copious) in the Scriptures, is not easily
attained; not with superficial Discourse without-Book (though this beneficial

CHAP. III. Of divine Knowledge: the Fountain, Streams, Force and Effects of it.
THe Hushand is required to dwell with the 1 P. 3.7.
Wife according to Knowledge: and this is so much objected and insisted on, as
if He were more apt to err of Ignorance, then she of Petulance and Presumption.
The definition and Display of this Knowledge, ('it is doubtful) may prove fully
as hard as that of Madness, if the divine Power attended with Propension and
Sedulity make it not more easy: Nil tam difficile, etc.
but all these complying, can, of the most rude or knotty Mass and Lump, render
a right square, plain and polished Piece, fit for the most excellent Uses under
Heaven.

For an Essay in this Particular; let us examine, 1. What Knowledge is. 2. What
kind of Knowledge is here meant. 3. Whence derived. 4. What are the Parts of
it.


1. By Knowledge, we conceive the understanding and determinative Faculty of
the Soul; comprehending Wisdom, Prudence discretion, Reason, Counsel, and
Judgment; yet submitting herein to professed Philosophers.

2. We understand to be meant here, a Knowledge both Jo. 4.24. 1 Co. 2.12. and
14.37. Col. 1.9. Ja. 1.5. Ephesians. 4.24.

are to act or think otherwise in the the Things of God, then Jo. 4.24.
spiritually and divinely; whence we are said, to be 1 P. 2.5.
built up a spiritual House.

3. It is 1. Primitively, originally, essentially and unspeakably in God. 2.
Derivatively and dimanantly in the Creature, and particularly in Man. In whom
we are first to lay this divine, masculine, and majestic Knowledge, as low as
some good Women would have it; and then, by Gods Direction, raise it unto its
proper seat and state; Which (not this weak Paraphrase, but) the powerful Word
of God will perform.

4. The Parts (or rather the Offices) of it are, either 1. Contemplative and
speculative, viz. reflecting upon God, his Word and Works; the Fall and
Restoration of Man; Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell and Eternity. But with this
part we meddle not; (save that we have needfully dilated somewhat on the sacred
written Word of God (the Means and Rule of this Knowledge) and happily may now
and then give a glance at the rest for Illustration, Ornament or good use;)
these Points being amply and exactly handled, and abundantly branched forth by
many able and worthy Divines of this and other Nations. 2 Practical, whereof
principally in this Tract, with limitation to our proper subject.

The two first Heads are dispatched; We proceed with the next.

who do thus explain them) Wisdom is Pro: 14.6.

is found with them only, that fear the Lord. And because the word Wicked has
so wide a Construction as none will own or apply it; Remember it is the proper
and peculiar Badge of those who Ps: 1.1. Pro: 6.13. and 10.23. Isa: 5.18. Jer:

as those Texts may tell them. This by (not much out of) the way. Take them in
whether sense ye will, for sinners or simplicians, they are (I say) in Gods
repute, all Fools; but the second sort are they whom in this place we are to
explode.

subject to like Passions as we are; and these Depressions or Heightnings, the
Eb^ings or Flowings, Eclipses or Glearness of the Spirit and Wisdom of God in
them.

Take two or three special Instances hereof: 1. In the Jos. 5.14,15. Heb. 2.10.
Captain and Champion of our Salvation, (whom we must except from the Account
of mere Man, and treat with all heed full and dreadful respect.) Is He not
that Pr. 8.12. toth' end. L. 11.49. 1 Co. 2.7. Rev. 5.11,12,13.
Wisdom of God, or God-wisdom, in whom are hid Col. 2.3. Isa. 11.2.
all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge? and consequently 1 Co. 1.30. L.
21.15.
our Wisdom and Isa. 9.6.
everlasting Counselor? Is it not he of whom his deadly Foes confessed, Heb.
5.7.
in the days of his flesh, that Jo. 7.46. L. 2.52.
Never Man spoke like this Man? And yet did he not plainly affirm, that What he
spoke Jo. 12.49,50, and 14.10.
was not of himself, but of and from the Father, who gave Influence and
Efficacy to his Words? Did He not also L. 12.14. Jo. 6.15. and 8.11,15. and
12.47.
decline Dignity and Judicature (with M. 13.32.
some kind of knowledge) Acts 8.33.
as if he were deprived of it? Yet he says, If I judge, my Judgment is Jo.
8.16.
true and Jo. 5.30.
just; and indeed he did Jo. 5.30. and 8.16,26. Isa. 42.4. Genesis 49.10.
actually and effectually, though Isa. 42.2,3. Jo. 8.12.
silently and meekly assume it, as Jo. 5.27. Mat. 28.18. Isa. 9.6.
given him by the Father, who (says he) Jo. 5.22.
judges no man, but has committed all Judgment to the Son, even Ver. 27.
because he is the Son of Man; wherefore he affirms after, Jo. 9.39.
For Judgment am I come into this World. And further, Mat. 9.17. L. 18.19. M.
10.18.
Did he not seem to disclaim even Goodness it self to be in him? Yet again,
challenges he the Jews, Jo. 8.46.
to convince him of sin; it being most faithfully and truly affirmed of him
alone, Acts 10.38.
that he went about doing good, and Isa. 53.9. 1 P. 2.22. 1 Jo. 2.1.
that he did no sin, neither was guile found in his Mouth.

Presence and Power of God,) We are (says the same Paul) 2 Co. 3.6. 1 Co. 3.10.
able Ministers of the New Testament: Col. 1.28.
We can teach every man in all Wisdom: 1 Co. 2.16. Acts 20.27. and 22 14.
We know the very Mind of Christ. And though he was fain to speak To. 6.19. 1
Co. 3.1,2.
plain and low to the shallow Capacity of some, yet he can, and does speak as 1
Co. 2.6,7. and 3.1. and 10.15. and 15.51. Heb. 5.14.

and Memory) L. 24.6,7,8,9,11.

this they remained dull and incredulous: and yet these were the Mat. 9.15. M.

In this sense then is all our Knowledge and Ability to be understood, viz. as
derived from God in Christ, and to be continued and directed by him, for him,
and to him. And if he make it ours Who shall murmur? Or if he call it
Perfection, Who may dispute it? Mat. 20.15.
Is it not lawful for him to do what or how he will with his own? See we not 1
Co. 1.26,27,28,29.
many a silly Creeple or contemned poor Wretch have more Knowledge or Insight
in the Word or Ways of God (which the worst of Men dase not deny to be the
best of Knowledge) then the most composed Gallant that walks? Let this satisfy
all sober Minds in the point of Gods Dispensations, and let none dare Ps.

Power is irresistible (for Job 9.4. and 22.16,17. and 40.2. To. 9.19.
Who ever hardened himself against God and prospered?) I am confident no
Christian arrogates to himself any stock of spiritual Gists or Graces at all,
nor indeed has he any but (as we say) from hand to mouth: while God by his
Zec. 12.10.
Spirit of Grace stands with and in us, See page 31. x.
we stand or stir; when he leaves never so little we faint and fall; the
Defections are our own, the Perfections (if any) are Gods: and while he reaps
the Glory and Thanks, he allows us to glean the Gain.

Thus far have we seen (not fully, for it is impossible) the Fountain of divine
Wisdom opened, and plentifully watering the World, with some Fruits and Effects
thereof in general. We are now to discover some more special Dispensations
thereof. And here we must either grant a Competency of Knowledge and Wisdom,
communicated and distributed by God, indifferently, respectively, and
particularly to every Station, Function, Calling and Person in the World, (at
least to the genera singulorum) or else (which God rightly may and does, as
before noted) we may deem all Men and Angels Fools, not sinful only (as in the
precedent Distinction) but silly Fools; which were a Conclusion as unsafe as it
is unsavory. Therefore we will not suspect there is any such muddy Current as
dares to cross the strong and clear stream of the sacred Word of God, which
runs thus, viz.

We have heard what rare and admirable Effects this divine spark of Wisdom has
wrought in its Possessors, or (rather) Possessed, and unto what sublimity it
has already lifted them. Yet we must not leave it here: Leave it here? Nay,
here it leaves us, and soareth up to its proper Seat and Throne in Heaven,
even into the hand and heart of God, (We must speak after the Manner of Men,
for the Infirmity of our Flesh, although the Expression seems to be warranted
by his own Word, where he is said to have an 1 S. 13.14. and 2.35. 2 K. 10.30.

What Honor then can be imagined high enough to be ascribed to this

it. For Isa: 53.8.

Generation? How Ps: 87.3.

Edification of others and our selves.

This Proposition (we hope) being pretty clear, that God has dispensed to and
among the sons of Men, indefinitly and generally, a respective Competency of
Knowledge as above: It were needless to prove Acts 17.26. To. 5.12,16. 1 Co.
15.22.
Mankind a Body, and the Husband a main and eminent Member or species thereof:
but it will conduce to know that He has his Dole in the divine Largess. And
this will appear by proof or Argument briefly thus.

All these Degrees or sorts of Men before mentioned, taken generally or
specially (which ye will) thus plentifully, completely, and magnificently
furnished with Knowledge, are but yet the Objects of Gods Liberality, in a
mediate, or (as we may say) remote Consideration. Christ is not said to be
incorporate with any of these Persons or Societies, as they are such; but as
being Cant. 6.9. Jo. 11 52. and 17.11,21,22,23. Acts 4.32. To. 12.5. 1 Co.

2.7,19,20. 2 Co. 11.2.
Husband, and consequently the Husbands Husband; that is, One and the same with
him, individually, specially, spiritually, mystically. Christ says indeed, I
am the good Jo. 10.11,14.
Shepherd, the Jo. 14.6.
Way, the Jo. 15.1.
Vine, my Father is the Husbandman, etc. But we know the Shepherd and Sheep,
the Traveller and Way, the Husbandman and Vine, (though near Relatives, yet)
are not the same Body or Thing: Yet so is Vine and Branches, Christ and the
Church, Husband and Wife. Christ and the Husband are Terms convertible and
symbolical; and the Ephesians. 5.23. 1 Co. 11.3.
Husband is Head of the Wife (in perfection of Parts) as Christ is of the
Church. Now shall we, dare we, or can we (without Impeachment of the divine
Wisdom, with Improvidence at least) imagine he would leave the Husband who is
so intimately related to him, and (rather) mystically incorporated with him,
defective or imperfect, in any Part or Faculty whatsoever? Or not rather
suppose him (for the Reasons alleged) a more abundant share in the divine
Bounty then all sorts of Men beside? And above all other, the pious Husband,
who bears it as the peculiar Pr. 28.5. Eccl. 2.26.
Cognizance and Token of his Masters, his Makers, Favor? This last is
illustrated by the contrary, showing in Whom only the Ephesians. 4.17, etc.
understanding is dark and blind. Moreover, if we grant any Man to be a godly
Husband, (that is, One that Deu. 4.29, etc. 2 Chapter 7.14. and 17.4,5. and 22.9.

control, prescribe or limit him in the Improvement of any divine Gift or
Faculty, consonantly, or not contrary to the revealed Will and Word of God. And
to wipe away all seeming Cause of Cavil or Suspicion in this kind, we need
not, we may not, think, that God does, or Isa. 48.11
will lose ought by his Liberality to his Creature, animate or inanimate; for
it all returns with Advantage to Him. The more Graces, Gifts and Ornaments he
confers, the more abundant Gratitude, Splendour and Glory (which is all he looks
for) he gains by it: all 1 S. 4.5. Job 38.7. Ps. 19.1, etc. and 65.13. and 89

Hearts, Tongues and Things yielding him so sweet an Harmony, so loud Eccho's
of Praise, that Heaven and Earth do ring again.

Yet in all this 1 Co. 12.6. and 15.28. Ephesians. 4.6.
God is all in all, and in these Results enjoys no more but himself, even his
own All Sufficiency, Perfection, Infinity. Job 22.2,3. and 35.6,7. Pr. 9.12.

Who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? For of
him, and through him, and to him are all Things, to whom be glory for ever.
Amen.

Thus have we (by Gods help) squared out this knotty Piece of Knowledge, and
rendered it somewhat fitter for our spiritual Edifice; or (if you will) have
wound it up into a Clew ready for the Warp and Weft; which all the idle (or
rather too active) Hous-wives of the World (this slandereth none) will never be
able to ravell or unready while the World or Deu. 6.7, etc. and 29.29. Ps.

CHAP. IV. Practical Knowledge relating to the Husbands Power. Sharpest
Correction consistent with choicest Affection. 1. In Christ.
AS th 'invisible God is the Ground of our Theory, so is his revealed Word the
Rule of our Practice in all Things moral and imitable. And because we are only
to treat of his oeconomical and conjugal Relation to us, we are chiefly to set
forth, First, his own Practice, as Husband and Head of the Church, and then our
Conformity thereunto. Herein, We are to eye his Power and good Pleasure. Whereof
the first is not much disputable, Only a Taste thereof is not amiss (which the
few marginal Quotations afford) To show us, That he who made Genesis 1.1.
All Things of Nothing, has the same Right and Power, in a Word, either by

See here Christ's own Commission and Command, yea his bare Hand, for all this
(seeming) Cruelty. And why should not this be as true as the Contrary; to wit,
That God imploys his Genesis 24.7. Ex. 23.20. Number. 20.16. Ps. 91.11. Isa. 63.9.

he sorteth his Punishments suitably into Isa. 27.7.
Chastisements and Judgments. We read not, that he terms (or at least Ps
94.10. and 135 14. Eccl. 3.17. Zep 3.7. Heb. 10.30. 1 P. 4.17. compared.
intends) his Punishing of the Wicked for Isa. 27.7. 1 Co. 11.32.
Chastisement, or of the Godly for Judgment. But as even the Pr. 12.10.
tender Mercies of the Wicked are cruel: so even his 1 P. 2.14.
gentlest Punishing of them is Judgment; how much more his Mat. 25.46. 2 Th.
1.9. Heb. 10.28,29. 2 P. 2.9.
greatest! Whereas of the Godly it is said, Ps. 94.12. Job 5.17.
Blessed is the Man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teach him out of thy
Law. Lo, here is Gods end in punishing these. And therefore though he often
dealt with David, (the 1 S. 13.14.
Man after his own heart) Ps. 6.1. and 118.18. and 71.20
very severely, in hot displeasure, and Ps. 13.1. and 77.7, etc. and 88.14. and
89.46.
at a gloomy distance; enough to drive him to Ps. 22.1,2. and 27.13. and 31.22.
and 43.2. and 51.11. and 73.13. and 88.14, etc.
an utter despair of favor. Yet he (good Man) knowing well where the Failing
was (to wit Ps. 25.11. and 38.3,4. and 51.3,4,9. and 69.5. and 130.3.
in himself, Ps. 51.4.
not in God, whose Ps. 30.5.
Anger also endures but a Moment) took all but as Chastenings, and fatherly
Tokens of Love, Ps. 33.9. and 131.2.
kissed the Rod, and concluded; Ps. 119.71,67.
It is good for me that I have been afflicted, and thou Ps. 119.75.
in very faithfulness and favor have done it. Had any Thing been wholsomer for
him, God would not (sure) have withheld it from his most dear and cordial
Servant David, for whose 1 K. 11.12,13.34. and 15.4. 2 K. 8.19. and 19.34. Ps.
132.10,11.
sake even future Generations fared the better. Even holy Job also, whom God
himself for Job 1.8. and 2.3. and 42.8.
Perfection and Uprightness prefers to all Men on Earth of his time, at whose
Mediation he Ez. 14.14,20.
would have done very much too, was corrected and punished by him, even to a As
poor as Job.
Proverb, (yet which of us repines not to 1 P. 2.20.
be buffeted for our faults?) How deals he with his most Number. 12.7. Jos. 1.7.

faithful and Number. 12.8. Ex. 33.11. and 34.28,29.
familiar Servant Moses? In stead of correcting, he Ex. 4.24.
goes about to kill him, yet Number. 12.8.
endures not others to give him a wry Word. The same Genesis 18.3,10. Dan. 9.17.
L. 2.11 Acts 2.36. and 9.10 11,17.
Christ the Lord gives Paul poor Heartening, sets him an hard Lesson at his
Matriculation or Admittance into his School. As Acts 9.15. and 22 14.
choice a Vessel as he was, he must be 2 Co. 4.8,9. and 11,23,24,25. Gal. 6.17.
tossed, crazed and cracked. Acts 9.16.
I will show him (says Christ) how great Things he must suffer for my Name.
Which Lesson he had so 2 Co. 6.4, etc.
patiently and perfectly conn'd within a while, that he (Doctor-like) lays it
down, as an undoubted Axiom or inevitable doom (which ye will) That 2 T. 3.12.
Acts 14.22. Jo. 16.33. 1 Th. 3.4.
All that will live godly in Christ Jesus (not only may, but) must suffer
Persecution. Good Hezekiah gives the Reason of all This; Isa. 38.16.
O Lord, (says he) by these things (to wit, Chastisements) Men live, etc. As
if they were as needful and certain to the Saints as their very Ps. 23.4. Mic.
7.14.
Food and Raiment, and without these were but Isa. 38.16.
dead Men, or Ps. 119.67,176.
Vagrants Heb. 12.8.

12.8.
Without Chastisement, or Pr. 3.11. Heb. 12.5.
weary and faint under it, We are but Pr. 24.10.
weaklings, cowards and Heb. 12.8.
Bastards: Nay, a Am. 6.1.
Woe is pronounced to them that are at ease in Zion, and a Zep. 3.1,2,5.
Curse to the Incorrigible and Impudent. By all which God would make Correction
a greater Argument of his Love then most (if not all) other his Mercies, and
our Deu. 8.5. compared with 6.
strongest Tie to Obedience. And (behold!) as well Ps. 103.14. Mat. 8.17. 1 Co.

Duty in the poorest Christian, to have the like Reckoning of himself, and
Resolution to stand it out which Nehemiah had, when he said, Neh. 6.11.
Should such a Man as I flee?

This Point may yet be briefly illustrated by the Contrary; to wit, That
Silence and Impunity (upon sinful Causes) are sad Presages of Job 12.6, etc.
and 21.9,30. and 27 14, Ps. 73.5, etc. Hos. 4.14,17. and 9.12. and 13.12.

yet more) it is evident enough to Any that will see, That the sharpest Rebuke
or Correction is compatible and consistent with the choicest and dearest Love;
which is presumed to be 'twixt Christ and his Church, Husband and Wife; and
Punishment being (as above) distinguished from Judgment; whom has Christ now
to punish or Correct but the Church his Wife? and what of his Wife, but her (or

In sum; his Relation, Interest, Prerogative and Power in and over his

Thus admiring and submitting to Christ the highest Husband in the glorious
Exercise of his own Power, we come now (still within his Limits, and by his
leave and strength) to view his honorable Delegation of his Vicegerent Man.

CHAP. V. The Symbol betwixt CHRIST and the Husband, in the Point and Power of
Practical Knowledge.
SO strong and stable a Symbol and Sympathy is there (indeed) between Christ
and his Church, Husband and Wife; that it may well, and must on all hands be
alleged and insisted on. And as it is gladly granted in Point of Cherishing,
so there will appear no ground of declining it in Case of Chastening other then
the Tenderness of Humanity, which how far it is requisite and tolerable is now
to be discussed.

In Order, and for Introduction hereunto, we are first to weigh well Gods Deu.

irrevocable Councels and Edicts; and chiefly (as to our present Purpose) to
carry along with us, that his primitive-peremptory Decree at the Creation, viz.
Genesis 3.16.
Thy Desire shall be to thine Husband, and he shall rule over thee. Where note
that 1. Cupimus clariora and potiora. 2. Here Is not Regula but Regimen, the Man
was not only to direct but rule her: and what implies Regimen, if not (as even
an Heathen defines it) Parcere Subjectis and debellare Superbos? How else,
differs it from Parity or Equality? Or, what more golden Rule of Regiment or
Government can there be? Now, as the Number: 25.5. Deu. 17.12. and 25.1,2. L.

find it delivered us by divine Authority (as in Confirmation of the said
Decree) That Ephesians: 5.23. 1 Co: 11.3. Compare and consider well Ephesians: 5.19 30.
the Husband is Head of the Wife, even as Christ is Head of the Church. Not
politically as in other Unions or Relations, but spiritually, mystically,
sacramentally: He is so the Head of the Wife as Christ is the Head of the
Church. And these two are to stand for impregnable Maxims, instar Omnium,
adversus Omnia. The Wife is also enjoined in sundry Places of Sacred Writ, a
similar or suitable Ephesians. 5.22,24,33 Col. 3.18. Tit. 2.5 1 P. 3.1. Est. 1.22.
Subjection and Obedience: the holy Ghost expressly directing, as Col. 3.22.
Servants to obey their Masters in all Things; so Ephesians. 5.24.
Wives to be subject to their Husbands in every Thing: And especially the Tit.
2.3,4,5.
aged Women, to be not Actors only but Teachers of Obedience to Husbands, the
words subjection and obedience being (it seems) Convertibles, and putting no
difference 'twixt Wives and Servants, 1 P. 3.6.
Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him Lord. And (ere we pass) lo here how the
holy Spirit also pleases to make use of a very Heathen to check this dear
Daughter of his in case of but a supposed slighting of her Husband: Genesis 20.16.
Behold (says Abimelech to Sarah) He is to thee a Covering of the Eyes, unto
all that are with thee, and with all other: as if her Eye ought have been
terminated in Him; at least that she should not have looked out, much less
abroad without his privity, leave and presence: which is a stricter (I say not
more servile) Observance then can be required from any Servant. So that for the
too large Liberty which ('it is like) Sarah took to look about her, the Spirit
says, She was reproved. Wherein, we may not but imagine some forward or
offensive Carriage in her, in her Husband Abraham's Absence, for God uses not
to chide his Isa. 41.8. Ja. 2.23. Ez. 14.23. 2 Chapter 20.7.

are enjoined to 1 Co. 14.35.

silence.

But it is further to be observed, That the divine Wisdom in all Places where
it directs the Conjugal Duties, Ephesians. 5.22. Col. 3.18. 1 P. 3.1.
first lays down the VVomans Subjection and Obedience, as a Leading and
Allurement to the Man's Affection, and then wills that he bear toward her in
Knowledge, Love and Lenity befitting, as the cited Texts do show. And (which is
yet to be noted) least she should either insist too much on his Love without
Merit, or forget her Duty, the Command is doubled and pressed upon her; Ephesians.
5.22,33.
Let the Wife see (as the Translators render it; be sure) that she reverence (
viz. fear, not affright) her Husband; implying, and as it were pointing at a
greater proneness of Neglect and Forgetfulness in her, and the petulancy
adhering to that Sex; at least enforcing the Duty more upon Her, which some
good Wives do not brook to hear.

The Reasons of Gods original Decree, and the succeeding Confirmations thereof,
although we are not to dispute or dive into; yet himself is pleased partly (and
indeed plainly) to signify unto us, That this very primitive Institution for
the VVomans Subjection, proceeded (as Ex. 9.27. 1 S. 12 7,9. 2 Chapter 12.5,6 Ezr.
9.14,15. Neh 9.33. Job 34.10,12,23. Ps. 97.2. and 119.137. and 145.17. Pr. 8.8.

partly on his own, and partly on the Man's behalf, As 1. The Genesis 1.26. and

2.14. 2 Co. 11.3.
construe it otherwise; the Man's Eating in it self being but an improvident Act
and Effect of the VVomans and her Suggestors wicked Counsel. And so we see her
Punishment proportionally aggravated, in that she not only shares in the Curse
of the Ground, but must be pinched with Pains in Conception and Childbearing,
and laden the yoke of Subjection to her Husband. 5. If the former were
wanting, yet (to us especially 1 Co. 10.11.
upon whom the Ends of the World are come) that redoubled rational Position

plain and forcible. But 1 Co. 2.14. and 14.37,38.

Which as we expect not at all in those that are Ph. 3.19.

know any thing of it as we ought to know; much less, dare promise or attempt
otherwise to describe this mystical Union, then in Ps. 118.22. M. 12 10. Acts

the same summary expressions by which the spirit of God exhibits it unto us.

And here, (not as in proof or confirmation, (it needs not) but, partly for
Illustration, and partly satisfaction or Conviction, in their own element, of
some Politicians (of whom a little more in due place) or others, who rest in
the Heb. 7.16.
carnal Commandments or Customs) we may demand (let it be answered at any
leisure) wherefore the Statute-Laws, do make the Wives Killing the Husband, Pety
Treason; and his Killing her, but Murder, and their sentence suitable; ranking
her, also, with Children and Servants (his known and confessed Inferiors and
Patients) as equally guiltable with them; and whether all conducent practices
be not, in proportion, punishable in her? Whether do not the Laws, also, look
upon the Husband as the Wises Protector, and Provider of Alimony (though in
some Particulars it hapens otherwise?) Is he not answerable for all her
expenses, exorbitances and Abuses of others; and if so, has he no liberty of
discretion, or Power of Coertion to regulate or restrain her? Lastly, whether
know they not some ridiculous customs or Practice (not worth the mention, but
in way of disdain) to disgrace the Man, who may not command (but must obey) his
Wife?

This Power, then, (such as it is) has the meanest Man, over the most eminent
Woman, if once his Wife. Therefore, let none mistake: (no matter who hears) Her
highness or Honor, is (nor ought to be) no Covert or Canopy to him (whilst
well conditioned.) The Scripture gives no such direction but rather makes him
(how course soever) a Cover and confinement to her eyes, as before. We read,
indeed of Acts 13.50. and 17.12.

are expressly thus: Giving honor unto the wife, etc. Where we see Honor in
honorante, not in honorata, which is cleared by 1. Co. 11.7,8,9,10. Its a Gift,
and lies in Arbitrio Datoris; she has it not till he give it her, and then is
it but an honoring Indulgence; and she so far to be honored and indulged, as
she is weak, not wayward or wilful.

Digress.
Its not unworthy noting by the way (for we may not tarry on it, or stand to
distinguish Nobility native and dative) what should be the true Original of
this thing called Honor, in either sex. All wise Men, and some Women (I
presume) can tell, Its not in Riches or Revenues (we need not instance any
more Negatives, because all other Grounds are now almost engrossed in these;
nor yet meddle we with those german, and truly generous Branches the Blood of
whose most noble Ancestors, (attended with ample Revenues, as Genesis 13.2,6. and
32.10. and 36.7. 1 K. 3.13. and 10.23,27. 2 Chapter 17 5 and 32.27,29. Job 1.3. and

visibly run in their veins.) It Is not, I say, Jer. 9.23.
in Riches or Revenues; for, if these either Eccl. 7.11.
be not mixed and tempered with Wisdom, or Pr. 23.5.
take wing and away, where is, then your (Laps) Honor?

Honor and Riches to their own Birth, Wit or Industry, and impute the Bereaving

both reflecting on God. As Genesis 32.10. 1 K. 3.13. 1 Chapter 29.12 14,16. Ps. 24.1.
and 50.10, etc. Ecc. 2.26. Acts 14.17. 1 Co. 10.26,28.
Riches (then) and all good things else; so Honor is originally derived from
God himself and shines forth in divine Virtue, learning Valor or Magnanimity.
But the truth is, and in a word; its Honesty (which is to much pinched or
straightened in our common use and acceptance, as Etymologists do best know) I
say, Non locus Hominem, sed Homo locum Honestat.
it is plain Honesty, that imports and comprehends (under God) all Grounds and
accedents of Honor whatsoever. Bravery but begs Honor, Honesty begets and
claims it. This, as it is the gennine Parent; so must it needs be the milchy
Nurse of Honor; else it will be quickly stained and extinct.

Those Gentlemen (not suspecting Gentlewomen) whose Business is but Sophism,
and whose Recreation or delight, but to dable, and, even, drown themselves in
boun society (so called) sometimes in more beastly Sensualities, are but dry
Nurses to their Honor. For, if by such Mis-government or Disguise they forget
and forfet the Honest Man, (or happily) Man himself; how much more the Gentleman!
In which regard some (if story be true) have justly assumed (not without
supreme appointment) a Piper to their Herald, and a Cole-rake and Malkin for
their Ensign. It was not unfitly replied by an honest Critic, to a debauched
Gent. vaunting of his own Antiquity, and vilifying the others Novelty: Rerum
omnium vicissitudo est.
Be it so: (says he) I am indeed, the First of my Family, but thou art the
last of thine. These love to talk of their Generation, but they cannot endure
to hear of their Degeneration. Nevertheless, it is neither new nor rare
conceit, That he is no Gentleman, who loves not The Attendants interpret this.
good Company, an Hawk, Hound. etc. nor she a Gentlewoman, that is not
enamored of such a Man.

The Application ayms, especially, at the Women; in whom it were an high Point
of Wisdom, that when they are conscious or sensible of their greater Honor,
Wealth, Wit or Worth, they insist upon and improve it at first, before
Marriage; For that once past, they must of necessity (for Matter of Superiority
or Parity) for ever strike Sail, and, in plain Terms, keep under Hatches: which
honest caution cannot justly incurr any Blame, of the unmarried, at least.

This Digression, though it be displeasing to a few, yet may profit Many. To
proceed.

Its not unknown to all that know any thing, that subjection imports as well
Command as Power; that actual Obedience is due to Jos. 1.9. Ex. 4.21 Lev.
25.18. Deu. 4 6. and 5.32. and 11.32. and 12.32. and 17.19. and 26.16. and

discretion (regulated with Ps. 103.13,14. Jer. 30.11. 1 Co. 10.13.
Moderation) of the Commander. If therefore the Wife (how eminent soever) be
Subject to lawful Command of the Husband; how is she exempt from the Penalty
of (not a weak, but a wilful and perverse) disobedience? his Power and Command
being inseparably symbolicall to that of Christ over his Church, which (we
doubt not) will now be as readily believed and confessed, as it is really
manifested. Although, indeed, it be far easier to profess it, then be thoroughly
persuaded of it, which will appear (a Majori) if we but examine the Beating of
our Pulse even to Christ-ward, in the proceeding of his own immediate hand upon
us. We can most cheerfully embrace his cherishing Power expressed in our
Health, Plenty, Prosperity: but how slowly do we assent unto, how grievously do
we admit and accept, his chastising Power, in Poverty, Sickness and the like!
Now, if we shrink and shuffle from under his own visible Hand, no marvel if we
storm and startle at the vigor and dint thereof inflicted by the hand of
others. And therefore, in deriving this just, exercitive-practick Power, from
Christ to the Husband, lies all the skill and difficulty. And this, indeed,
cannot otherwise be done, then (as the contrary may be endeavored) by proper
and necessary diduction, and probable Argument from the Word; wherein we level
only at the rational and believing Husband; The other, being not limitable by
any Rules of Law, or Bands of Love, we leave to himself. Briefly thus.

As the To. 10.8,17. 1 Co. 4.15. Ja. 1 18.

If Scripture, then, and Reason so concur, as in the present case they seem to
do; what lets from believing, that the Christian Husband, being Head of his
Wife as Christ is of his Church, and so completely qualified as before, may for
urgent Cause, as well and warrantably chasten as cherish his Wise? Now Christ
(we have heard) has sundry ways to correct his Church, his Wife; but we are
here to take Correction for Blows or actual Beating of the Body. A servant, (or
other offending Inferior, says Solomon) will Pr. 29.19.
not be corrected by words.

In our Progress, we are to note, that the practical knowledge of our (humane)
Husband, is expressed of the holy spirit by the Word 1 P. 3.7.
Dwelling. Which, as it is exercised in the contemplative, doctrinall or
directive way, we are here to wave or omit, (for Reasons Page 20.
before showed) and apply us only to the disciplinary Part.

To our readier Access, and proceeding, it will conduce much to know, That by
my Dwelling and converse in the World, among Men and Women, I have discerned
and discovered, some odd and uncoth Tenets and Principles (the ordinary ones
do follow too) of certain-uncertain Wives; by virtue whereof, when they
please, they can (as they talk of Hocus) wipe off even all Affinity with their
Husbands; or at least, will live and LADY is too low a style for them.
Lord it by them. They were hatched (I suppose (in Ignatius his Conclave, for
they chirp on this fashion. 1. That their Husband has nothing to do with them;
viz. as to reprove or admonish them: For, 2. Their Soul, their Tongue, and Alls
their own; they may speak what they please in their own (not their Husbands)
House, without Control or Question, yea, may lawfully swear, while wronged or
provoked. 3, That the disposing of unfort unate Marriages (so they call them)
are not by appointment or Providence of God, but brought about by the Devil
and his Agents. 4. That, if a Woman have had one or more former Husbands; he
that she now has, is not her Husband (longer then he pleases her: what is he
then, I pray, and what she?) And they cite Jo. 4.18. Isa, 4.1
Scripture for it: if any, therefore, were ignotum Ignatio, it is (likely)
This. 5. If they have an Husband that is conscious of his Place and Duty, they
presently apply this Plaster (which was hardly fitted) to their wounded
spirit, Job 3.25.
The thing I greatly feared is come upon Me; to wit, the Plague of subjection
to my Husband: as with a Jer. 31.18.
Bullock unaccustomed to the Yoke. 6. Though they may yield themselves, a
little akin to their Husband, and, perchance somewhat kind, for carnal ends;
yet the Sea p. 48. a, etc.
noble or gentle Blood bubbling and boiling in their veins; or the pregnant
Mother-wit capering in their Brain; or the Dan. 4.30.
inestimable-matchless Means they brought, still rolling in their mind and
mouth (as indeed the most Eccl. 10.19.
obvious and sensible Incentive;) All, or any of these (say they) is evidence
enough for Priority, Predominance, or (in English) Mastery, over the
simple-honest Man, the Husband; Who, if he can but keep himself from abusing
his Laydy-Lord's Allowance to surfeit, or (further) Blemishing her Honor, has
as much Command and Charge as he is capable of; or as many an unworthy Man
cares for. And there are some good Women, under the honored degree of
Ladies-indeed, whom we know loath to bear, or be known by, their Husbands Name,
whether out of Modesty or Majesty, judge ye: The Custom of this your Nation
condemning them, and the Isa. 4.1.
Scripture also seeming to comfirm it. But we leave this schismatic Sect to
enjoy themselves and their Husband (or what they call him) at their pleasure.

What shall we say to these Women? or, how may they be treated withal, to
their own content or satisfaction? It would be too tedious, and almost
impossible to fit them all with Answers suitable to their Fancy or Size. These
their Tenets are all (no doubt) the spurious Issue or Products of adulterous
Parents, Ps. 73.6. Pr. 6.16,17. and 21.4. and 30.13. To. 1.30.
Pride and Job 21.14. Ps. 10.4. and 14.1. and 73.11. Ephesians. 2.12. Tit. 1.16.

But the five first, being more monstrous then the last, we shall at once rid
them out of our way, by referring those Phoenix's (if the simile will reach and
hold) the Professors thereof, to a few Genesis 2.24. and 20.16. Number. 5.27,31 and
30.6. to the end and 36. all. Pr. 31.11. Isa. 45.7. Am. 3.6. Mal. 2.14,15 Mat.

sort these Texts themselves, and apply them.
Texts of holy Scripture, which, if it will not fit our Turn as well as
their's, we shall subscribe to their Principles.

The 6 Tenet, being more frequent and familiar (and so more infectious) we
shall more intensly pursue, by answering and absolving it as God enableth; For
under this (not excluding the rest) are couched, all the Cases wherein, or
Quaere's whether the Christian Husband, dwelling or walking in a conscientious
Knowledge with his Wife, is to exercise any coactive or corrective Power over
her; or how he shall fadg with such harsh and hateful Interferings, as partly
are, and are to be deciphered; and are possibly and too apparently to be found
in some Wives. These will distinctly appear in their Order and season, and (we
conceive) come more clearly off, in way of Objection and Answer, then otherwise.

CHAP. VI. Whether a good Man must or may, correct or beat his bad Wife.
Objections answered.
WE are here to encounter an Army of Objections, which, on every Wing, come
like Swarms buzzing about our ears. Those of most Weight and Worth, are
admitted and respectively answered; the rest dismissed till other Opportunity.
For even the best and soundest here presented, will, happily be found to relish
of, and flow as much from Affection (which, indeed, is commendable, if not
merely natural) as from Judgment in the Objectors, though otherwise, it may
be, most judicious: Who need not be minded, what, 1 K. 11.3. Neh. 13.26.
Weaknesses the wisest Men on earth have incurred or contracted by too much
Indulgence in this kind. There needs no great curiosity in their Order, but
take them as they come to hand. Some have either fully or in part their Answer
already, to which we will referr as they pass.

Object. 1.
1. This Objection, indeed, may justly challenge Precedence: That, Christ Jesus,
the Head and Husband of his Church, being infallibly and infinitely wise,
knows exactly, wherefore, when, and how to correct. But Man not so; and
therefore must forbear to beat his Wife. This was especially proposed to me,
not long ago, by an ingenuous Friend, and good Christian (I doubt not) who
speaking occasionally on this Subject, did first urge (as most do) the Point of
Knowledge. And when I came somewhat close unto him, he evaded (discreetly and
well) replying (as in the Obj.) that Christ infallibly knows to correct in due
Measure and Season; but Man's wisdom being weak and erroneous is apt to abuse
his Authority; and so he cannot safely exercise it in that way. He Instanced,
in a Man, who upon urgent occasion soon after Marriage, beat his Wife: but
(says he) it was under pretense of some Lunatica and turbida Intervalla; so as
afterward, he would not own the Act, insinuating that had he then been sui
Compos, he should not, or would not have done it. As if it were not fit for a
Wise Man, Pr. 26.5.
to answer a fool according to his folly: Or, if lawful Subjects will needs
rebel, to L. 19 27. To. 13 1, etc.
repress and reduce them by plain and direct ways. But, for the maine
resolution.

Answ.
I confess, that (at first) I was secretly a little swayed by the Objection, as
one who 2 Co. 11.31. and 12.9. and 13.4.
conscious of my own Weakness, am ever apt 1 Co. 4.4.
to suspect the worst. But when I revolved the matter, and advised, that (at
the best) we Pr. 3.5,6. Jer 10 23. Ez. 34.12. See page 31. u,
walk nor act not by our own Wisdom; I took Courage, and (to confirm me) have
gleaned some more special Truths and Notions then I had before from the Word of
God, which being already thetically offered page 21. l. m. and p. 27. d. e.
etc. I thither referr my said Friend and the rest of my Readers, where they
shall find how little Cause any Christian (especially) has to complain, or to
be accused, of scantness from Gods Hand, of Wisdom to manage his Place or
employment; for which we are to be as well accountant as craving.

Object. 2.
The Scripture yields neither Precept nor example for Beating a Man's Wife.

Answ. 1.
1. For Precept. We see as slender Grounds for Women's partaking of the holy
Snpper or for Infant Baptism: Yet, the One is never disputed, and the Other
(almost) generally practiced. Look we a little aside into a like (perhaps a
stronger) Case. Fathers to whom are ascribed Mal. 1.6. Heb. 12.9,10.
undoubted Rule over their Children, are directly forbidden Ephesians. 6.4.
to provoke them to Wrath, and yet are elsewhere, as plainly Pr. 22.15. and
23.13,14. and 29.17.
enjoined to correct them. Now what Child see we patient, or not in some degree
provoked, by Correction (especially, when he sees his Parent, (as it were) Pr.
19.18.
merciless, not moved with his Crying? There are indeed some Children, whom
moderate Correction enrageth more, then boisterous Usage does others. But must
it, now, be quite omitted? Whereto serves the Parents Power and Discretion? The
Result is, as if he should say: parents, correct your Children; but in Measure:
though he seems, again, not to limit them, in that he says Pr. 19.18.
Let not thy soul spare for his crying. To apply this: There are as plain
Commands (already proved) for Obedience from the Wife, as from either Child or
Servant. Only the punishment of her Disobedience, is (not gainsaid, but)
silenced and passed over: Perhaps disposed thus by the Divine Wisdom on
purpose; that godless, barbarous, inhumane Wretches, might not have an express
Rule to plead for their outrageous Beating their Wives: as a sword (though a
lawful Weapon) is not to be trusted in the hand of a Pr. 26.18.
mad or lawless Man. So, why may we not conceive the meaning thus? That a
knowing, spiritual, Godly Man, and he only, may correct his bad Wife: He
needs no minding either of Necessity, seasonableness or Moderation: Mat. 11.19.
L. 7.35.
Wisdom is justified of her Children: And for my own part; Let the Ps. 25.6.
and 51.1. and 86.15. and 89 1. and 103.4. and 111 4. and 145.8,9. Lam. 3.22.
God of Compassions and tender Mercies accept Me, according to my sympathy and
Tenderness to any suitable Object whatsoever.

There Is no mention of either Discipline or Doctrine used by the 1 Co. 7.12,16.
believing Corinthians, in the Conversion of their unbelieving Wives: Must we
therefore understand neither? or why not both? Would the Work be (likely)
wrought, by mere looking on them, or walking by or before them? Briefly, to
what end is See p. 50. l, etc.
Command, if the Commanded, may both neglect and rebel without Control? Or,
what is Control, if it may not Pr. 26.3.
coerce and quell the stoutest and strongest Contumacy? Or, rather (it cannot
be urged too often) what more infallible Token can there be of our pious
Affection to any stubborn Offender (in that sense only) whom God subjecteth to
our Government, then moderate and seasonable Correction? So far is it from
Cruelty or unkindness. In a word; as there must be granted no express Precept
or Rule; so there cannot be denied, a strong Consequence from the Word of God,
for the Chastisement in Question. Let but Lev. 19.17. Mat. 11.9. Ephesians. 5.29.
these Texts and the like be prudently compared and impartially weighed, and
they will clear the equity of this Answer.

Answ. 2.
2. For Practice or Example: Neither do we there read, or believe, That any
Believers Wife was ever so rampant or outrageous, in affronting or abusing her
Husbands Authority, as to need Beating. If Wives will invent strange new
Fashions and frisking strains of Disobedience, which their 1 P. 3.5.
holy Ancestors (and, for ought we find by the Word, even the worst of Women)
abhorred, why should not their Husbands suit them with new Forms of Discipline?
To what end, else, are they to dwell with them as Men of Knowledge? Does this
Knowledge (think we) import nothing but Pusillanimity or Patience? Is he Gods
Vicegerent for nothing? Belongs there none Effects to the Bow but Bending? Can
he not be a Saint, unless a Sot too? But wherefore (intruth) a Man of
knowledge? Surely, to treat and act, according to the Jude 22.
temper and strength of his Vessel: which if brittle and weak, to touch it
tenderly; but if tough, rugged and boisterous to handle it more boldly. It is
the Expression of an undoubted judicious and pious Dr. S.
Divine: With some, a spirit of Meekness prevails most, but with some a rod;
some must be pulled out of the Fire with violence, and they will bless God for us
in the day of their Visitation. -- An hard Knot must have an answerable Wedg,
else in a cruel Pity we betray their souls. -- The Wounds of secure sinners
will not be healed with sweet Words. The holy Ghost came as well in fiery
Tongues as in the likeness of a dove, etc.

Object. 3.
The Opinions of most orthodox Divines, who treat or speak on this subject or
of Conjugall Duties, are against Beating of Wives: and although some seemed to
allow it, yet they have since retracted, and are reduced into the stream of
Dissenters; who leave none other Remedies or Comforts to the aggrieved Husband
in his greatest Conflicts, but Humiliation for his ill Choice, together with
Prayer, Patience and Yiedling. Some (I suppose, pleasantly) noting that he
rather deserves Beating for choosing no better. And (for illustration or
instruction) an Instance is added in a choleric Couple, who meeting in
Marriage, and the good Man asked how they could ever accord, etc. He answered,
That when the Fit was on his Wife, he yielded to her, as Abraham did to Sarah;
and so she on the contrary.

Answ. 1.
I confess, that after I had made a large entrance into this Theme, and heard
of some worthy Men to be otherwise minded (especially when I was told of the
said Retractation by a reverend Divine) I was a little disheartened from
proceeding to a period: And, although I never harbored so much as a thought of
thwarting any good Man's Opinion (much less many) as laboring only to enlighten
my own Judgment and conscience; yet, I have been carried on Neh. 2.18. Pr.
16.9. Ezr. 7.28.
under Gods powerful directing hand, with these and the like Considerations.
As 1. That they being but Men, as others, will not (I suppose) affirm their
Judgments Witness the said Retractation of an esteemed orthodox Divine; if yet
it may be counted a Retractation; For I hear not so much as a syllable in it
sounding toward a Retreat. These Words, indeed, and the like I find therein,
viz. Let nothing be counted a Sin which Scripture does not condemn as a Sin;
and what the Word (the Rule of Truth and Falsehood) does not show us to be
unlawful, That let us hold to be lawful. Safely may one conclude in all
manner of Actions: I will take that as warrantable against which I find
nothing written. Care-cl. p. 12. And -- Generals not limited by God, do give
our Consciences Warrant to their utmost Generality, so far as they may not
dash against some other Commandment: Ibid. p. 20,
infallible, in Matters wherein the Word is not express; but rather, what they
speak, in such case, to be (at most) 1 Co. 7.6.
by permission, and not of Commandment: and that all Men fetching their
Arguments from the same Fountain, One may hit or miss the Mark as soon as
another. And truly, it may stand as a just Apology for many judicious worthy
Divines, That their urgent Avocations otherwise, have not allowed them a through
Search or Pensitation of this Point; especially, the case not pinching so near
upon them.

2. I could not but contract some Animation even from the said Retractation it
self; which must needs be more slenderly grounded then the Authors foregoing
Assertion. 3. I have seen (I suppose) the most eminent or accepted Writers on
this Subject Heb. 11.4.
who being dead, do yet speak; whose Memory I have good cause to honor. But
(with humble submission to graver Judgments) these have not (perhaps, for the
preceding Reason) come fully home to the Point, nor raught me satisfaction.
They allow the Wife, indeed, (which no good Man denies to his good One) to be
sublevant to his Burden of guiding the Household; which (rightly understood)
does more betoken his Trust then her Authority, his Ease then her Honor: and
she is to take the Staff as he delivers it, not twitch it out of his hand and
usurp his Authority, (for she may chance have more need of ordering then all
the rest.) This seems to be the Meaning of these good Men, in that they require
a precedent, strict Obedience in the Wife: but (herein I humbly conceive they
come short) they leave the Husband lame and remediless in point of Coertion,
the life of Power and Command. 4. I presume, they hold not Marriage it self
unlawful to All, or Any sorts of Men, because 1 Co. 7.7, etc.
Paul that chaste and chosen Vessel, and some few of his temper have contained;
or yet, because Paul himself (who had good cause, to 1 Co. 7.40.
think he had the spirit of God, yea to be sure, he knew 1 Co. 2 16.
the Mind of Christ) 1 Co. 7.1,7 8.
wished that all Men (universally, indefinitly) were even as he, (to wit,
unmarried or unminded that way) seeming, also, directly 1 Co. 7.37,38. 1 T. 5.11
to dissuade from Marriage; or, yet, because even all the Disciples (the Sea p.
25. n, ult. etc.
secretaries, and especial L. 22.28,29. Jo. 16.27.
Favorites of God, the Lights of the World, etc.) said Mat. 19.10.
It is not good to Marry. For, then how should Genesis 1.28. and 9.7 and 35.11.
Mankind be propagated, and the Isa. 66.5 Jo. 17.12,20,21. and 10.16. 1 Th.
4.15,17.
elect Number (especially) made up and perfected, according to Gods Purpose and
appointment? Therefore Paul (for his part) concludes 1 Co. 7.9.
it is better to Marry then to burn, and Ver. 36. 1 T. 5.14.
bids, let them marry; insinuating a Necessity, which is, also, to be
understood in our present Case (as at large anon). And for the Disciples: see
in the place forecited, Christ his most wise and mild Arguing and Answer, to
take off their erroneous Conceit. Besides, Genesis 15.2,4,5. and 21.2,3. and
25.21. and 49.25. Ex. 23.26. Deu. 7 13,14 Jud. 13.3,24. 1 S. 1,5,11,20. and 2.5
2 K. 4.14,16. Ps. 113 9. and 127.3. L. 1.7,13,36,57. 1 T. 2.15. and 5.14.
Childbearing is pronounced a Blessing; but Genesis 20.17,18. Lev. 20.20,21. 2 S.
6.20,23. Pr. 30.16. Jer. 22.30.
Barrenness, Hos. 9.14.
miscarrying Womb, dry Breasts, and Ps. 78.63.
Maidens not given to Marriage are accounted sore Judgments. Yet, howsoever,
there seems more restraint from Marriage, then here from Beating. For, why
might we not thence argue thus? It were well, and better, the Wife could not
deserve Blows; but, if they be due, or needful, or best for her, why should
they be denied her? This Branch of Answer were more genuine to the 2. Obj. but,
I hope not altogether improper here. 5. That, commonly, these Men of God, have
Offertures made unto them, of none but Godly-disposed, or (at least) well bred,
and civilized Women to Wives: Or, if they find them not so, yet the very Lev.
21.6,8. Ez. 42.14. L. 1.70. Jo. 20.22,23. Acts 3.21. 1 Co. 4.1. Tit. 1.8. 2 P.
1.21
sacred Function and sublime Parts of such Men, inviteth and inforceth an
awfull-reverent Respect unto them: this again, must needs beget in Men so
ingeniously ingenuous (and I think in most others, all are not 1 S. 25.17.
Nabals) a tender and melting Indulgence to their Wives, and consequently in
both a reciprocal and mutual Complacence and endeerment. 6. They being well
retired from the Noise and Tumult of the World, may charitably conceive, most
Women like their own; at least, none so ill as they are represented (for we will
imagine few so impudent as to bristle and brawl in the presence or hearing of
their Minister) 7. Although, there may be happily found a little spice of
Haughtiness or Arrogance, even in these Men's Wives; yet their better Breeding
directs them to carry above that baseness (whereof by and by) that may incite
unto Blows. 8. Lastly, I dispute not, whether they, of all Men, be expressly
forbidden (or others implicitly allowed) to 1 T. 3.3.
strike in this Case. And therefore, no mervail, if (in these or the like
regards) Beating be uncoth and odious to them: for certainly no Godly Man else,
can use so grievous an outward Remedy, without much inward Reluctance and
secret sorrow, according to the Bowels of his Isa. 60.10. Jer. 31.20. and
^2.10. Hos. 11.8. L. 6.36 and 15.20.
compassionate Heavenly Husband; Who is content to cover all former Faults, 2
Chapter 30.9. Job 33.22,23,24. Ps. 85.8. Jer. 3.1,7.
upon condition (which is ever intended) of Return and Reformation. And,
surely, in a Gracious Man (so granted) we may not imagine the least Cruelty at
all. He is merciful to Pr. 12.10.
his very beast; how much more to his Brother, Wife and own Flesh, to whom he
acts or intends nothing, but temporal and eternal Good: Yea, his seeming
Cruelties are Kindness and Compassion: He is but Am. 4.11. Zec. 3.2.

that 1 Co. 5.5.
the spirit may be saved. For he has, and is guided by, the Mat. 5.48. L. 6.2.
Wisdom, Justice and Mercy of his heavenly Father.

Answ. 2.
Touching the Choice of a Wife. I see not how any can properly deduce this
choosing (which some do) from the Word 1 P. 3.7.
Dwell: Choice and Cohabitation or use (we know) being different Things; though
it must needs be granted that a Man's Knowledge, were well and needfully
exercised that way. But, allowing them their full scope, we address to the
Answer. Wherein, since we have no Precept for Choice (more then for
Chastisement) we must apply our selves to Paterns, whereof the Word yields us
Plenty. 1. We read not of any great fore-acquaintance, that any of the
Patriarchs or Men of God (except Jacob) had with their Wives when they married
them: For it is said, Genesis 11.29.
Abraham and Nahor took them Wives; implying no long deliberation or time of
Trial. And it may be doubted, that (there being none, or few, but Idolaters
about them) their Choice was hard or scant. Of the Wife of Lot, there is little
more to be said, then E. 17.32.
Remember Lots Wife: Only, we may suspect her, either not so well principled to
Godward, or not so respective and regardfull of her leading Husband, as she
ought. Isaac's Wife Rebekah, by whom the promised and ever blessed seed was to
be propagated, came merely on a sudden, and (as it were) Genesis 24.65.
a stranger to him; without Preparation either in his judgment or Affection
for this or that Woman. And (which seems somewhat odd) his Father Abraham
confines him for a Wife, to Genesis 24.4.
his own Country and Kindred, who were Jos. 24.2.
probably and mostly Idolaters (perchance, then, as ill as the Canaanites). The
best thing we hear in the Business, is the Servants Genesis 24.12.

that Jacob, even Genesis 32.28. Ps. 83.4.

an Idolater's daughters; whose Religion (it is like) he understood; and (by his
Interest and Genesis 29.20.
Intimacy with them) might, or should, have altered in all that time. Yet, we
see, that even after Rachel was his Wife, she was Genesis 31.32,34,35.
neither wayned from her Idols, nor well instructed in the point of Theft and
Lying. Nor do we perceive that Jacob proposed ought to himself, in thus
marrying, but a temporal Recompense of his corporal service, which seems
Hos. 12.12.
affirmed by the spirit of God himself. Did not Joseph, one that especially and
Genesis 39.9. and 42.18.
professedly feared God, accept such a Wife, for Genesis 41.45.
Honors sake as Pharaoh gave him, an Idolatrous Egyptian. Incidit in Scyllam
cupiens vitare Charybdim. While from the Gulf he quits, upon the Rock he splits.

He that abhorred the Genesis 39.9.

Did not Moses Deu. 33.1. Jos. 14.6.

Co. 7.12.
believing Corinthians and other Saints, did or might marry Wives, even while
unbeleevers, and for carnal Ends: Yet hear we not Paul checking any of them
for their ill Choice, but encouraging them, only, in the way of Conversion,
whereof, (it may be) God had ordained those believing Husbands to be
Instruments, and perhaps, even by plucking out of the Fire. I presume there is
not expected now a days any larger Measure of Faith or Fear of God, then was
in the Men before mentioned; and yet where do we find any One of them
especially afflicted or humbled in this Respect, or that God expressly found
fault with them for it? much less read we that he allowed these Women, their
Wives, any Rivality or Vicissitude of Command with them, and least of all, 1 T.
2.12.
any Authority over them in regard of their ill Choice. 2. It is said, That
Jer. 10.23.
it is not in Man that walks, to direct his steps: That Jer. 17.9. Mat.

The heart of Man is deceitful above all things -- who can know it? If, then,
a Man be ignorant in his own steps, of his own heart; how shall he know hers,
who is, yet, as a stranger, at a distance, and distinct from him, though very
familiar with him? 3. We read of Faith, that is able even to Mat. 10.1. and

fade and fall away. Now, although the Woman we woo, and (upon good
experience, we hope) espouse and wed, may all this while carry fair, and gain
the Account of a Believer, yet, it is possible, she may fall off, and grow
wanton, wayward and insulse. Or, more plainly thus: In case a Woman out of
carnal or other by-Ends, yet, under specious Appearances of Religious Respect
and Obedience, shall marry a Man; thinking afterward to enslave him to her
Means or Humors (Experto creed Roberto) Is it, in these cases, more sinful for
the Husband to set her in the right Way, then for her to persist in the wrong?

It is most gladly granted that Prayer, Patience and Humiliation (we need not
part them here) are prime and prevailing Means with God; and full as much might
be said of their Effects, as of See p. 22. h. etc.

Although the Ia. 5.15,16.

infallibly answer it in the Thing petitioned (for Miracles are ceased): Not

these means, be baffled, not only out of his Power and Repute, but his Liberty

For Abraham's yiedling to Sarah. I have heard the like story merrily, not
seriously, told; but expected not to have found it in Print from the Pen of any
professed Divine as a Pattern of yiedling; nor yet do I (with submission to
found judgments) conceive it altogether, though in some degree imitable. We
read, indeed, of 3. Yeildings (such as they were) of Abraham to Sarah. 1. His
Genesis 16.1,2.
Acceptance of Hagar to Wife, at Sarahs Request. 2. His Verse 6.
Leaving her to Sarahs Censure, when the Maid conceiving, had slighted the
Mistress for Barrenness. 3. His but Genesis 21.11.
supposed) granting of Ishmael to be Coheir with Isaac. Now, for his yiedling
to Sarahs first Fit (as they call it) I suppose none will make it a Precedent,
and, therefore, little needs be said to it. The 2. was but an Act of Justice
or Equity in Abraham, to vindicate the wronged or vilified Mal. 2.14,15.
Wife of his Youth. The 3. and last is least imitable. For 1. This was not so
much Sarahs Fit, as (with reverence be it spoken) Gods Fit, in his own fit
season; for he seemed to set her on, and immediately Genesis 21.12.
seconds her: Nor so much Abraham's yiedling as God's; Who, there, plainly
approves and directs it to him, as consisting with, and tending to accomplish
his own eternal Counsel in the Genesis 22.18. Mat. 1.1. To. 9.8. Gal.
3.16,18,19,23.
promised seed. 2. Its only said, Genesis 21.11.
The th^g was very grievous to Abraham: it perplexed him to hear Her, who was
so dear unto him, and ought not have been denied any reasonable Request, to
propose a Matter oppugning the Sea page 46. u, x.
ancient-customary Right and Prerogative of the Firstborn. But, how far, or
whether at all, he yielded to her, till God interposed, it appears not. 3. His
yiedling referr's, and is confined, to that very singular Request of Sarah's.
4. Genesis 21.12.13.
God seems graciously to apologize with Abraham about it. As if he had said
(which Mat. 3.15.
his eternal Son did in another case) suffer it to be so now, Abraham, and
rest thee contented; it is my purpose and pleasure to have it thus. Let it not
seem harsh or oppressive, for I will abundantly sweeten and recompense it to
thee. Genesis 18.23, etc. and 19.22. Ex. 32.10.

life. I call it sinful and understand it of this very same; for what other

soundly it has been paid for. But we may collect from both the last, that a
foolish and wicked Indulgence or yiedling, is often, and fearfully destructive.
To sum up this, I say again, that these and the like extraordinary Acts and
Occurrents, are to be eyed by Faith, not reason; to be admired not argued, nor
drawn into Example; but we are chiefly to attend the primitive, stable and
constant Institution, Genesis 3.16.

and called him Lord. Its no safe walking in secret or unwonted Paths.

We should vail our Bonets at this Objection; whose loftyness demanded the
Leading, though it is persuaded hither. It cannot, indeed, handsomely speak out
Objection, but it shrewdly mutters and lispeth it. However, we shall take it
for their true Meaning, though a feigned and feeble Objection, And thus (in
effect) it sounds. That there is a kind of Parity or Equality, rather then
any great Inseriority, in the Woman to the Man; which must needs be a clear
Exemption from all corrective Power. Their Grounds (all that have as yet
occurred, and all from the Pulpit) are these. 1. That Woman was taken, neither
out of the head nor foot of Man, but made of a Genesis 2.21,22.
Rib; to signify that she should be used with equal and indulgent Respect,
and lovingly laid by his side: And, (in proportion or similitude hereunto) God,
in his Wisdom, found it the fittest way, of redeeming and Recovering lapsed
Adam, to take (as it were) a Rib out of his own side ( viz. the middle person
in Trinity) to satisfy and suffer for the sin of Man. 2ly. From Col. 3.20. In a
brief Exposition whereof, an equail Honor (at least) was adjudged due by
Children to their Parents (the inference is easily made): and this confirmed or
illustrated by that only Instance, Lev. 19.3.

fearfully and wonderfully made. But, (if it be safe for some to express their
Fancies as well as others) i. Why might not God choose a Rib of Man (which among
so many of the same sort, might best be spared, especially from a part less
conspicuous) rather then mutilate his extreme or exterior Members, which were
more rare, obvious, active and useful? 2. We are sure, He could as easily, and
with One-ness enough, have framed her at first, in her full and just
Dimensions, of the same Mould and Lump of Earth with Man; and, with a Word of
his Mouth, have cemented them together, in as indissoluble an Union as now they
are: For, if he say, It is, or shall be thus, Number. 23.19. Ps. 89.34. Isa.

it cannot be otherwise, whatever 1 S. 16.7. Job 10 4. Isa. 55.8. Mic. 4.12.
Men discern or deem. And therefore, we may conceive it his pleasure, thus to
express his Ps. 115.3. and 135 6.
unlimited Power and Wisdom, in his various Acts of Creation; to wit, That he
could as well make Woman of a Bone, or a Mat. 3.9.
Stone, or of any other, or Genesis 1.1.
no Material, as of Earth. 3. Though the Gent. named Head and Foot; yet (by
his expression of equal Par in Parem (said himself) non habet Potestatem.
Respect) he seemed to make no difference of dignity betwixt them: but, as if
the Woman, being taken out of the middle of Man, aequidistant from his Head and
Foot, were equally and proportionally to participate of both. Not unlike a
prick or Point, first made at the Middle of a line, and then drawn out into a
Parallel with it, of even length and strength. He must mend his arguing, or else
he leaves but little Head-ship at all for the Husband; at least L. 19.22. Mat.
12 27.
for himself. 4. In that Genesis 2.21.
He took One, (and but One) of his Ribs, it must needs imply a majus and minus,
a vast disproportion in Quantity. For one Rib is but a small Particle of Man's
Body, and therefore must yield to the Major Part: so the Rib gains no great
honor in this Comparison. But 5. and chiefly, The Scripture allows no such
Terms of Relation (in this Case) as Body and Rib; but confines you to Head and
Body: take what part of the Body you please, it is, (or ought to be) in
subjection to the Head, without whose Government and Direction, it is but a See
p. 14. f. ult.
dead, distracted or useless Trunk, 6. Since he assimilates this Rib to the
second Person in Trinity; let him consider, with what Respect (or rather
Rigor; both by Isa. 53.3, etc. Acts 2.23. and 4.28 To. 8.32. Re. 13.8
Inflictions and Mat. 27.46. M. 15.34.
Desertions, corporal and spiritual), God the Father used his Rib; and then
inquire whether his female Rib (when he has it; for I supposed him a Bachelor
both Ways) would esteem it her honor, or ease, to be so evenly placed in the
Middle upon like Conditions. This, for the straightness and strength of the
Rib; touching its Crookedness, a Word more anon.

That of Lev. 19.3. seems to be a slender Proof, and (as to this purpose)
somewhat strained and partial. For that 3. verse and the 4. being (as 'twere)
Epitomes of the two Tables; the second there precedes the first: From whence he
might as well argue, that the Duties to Man are to be discharged before Divine
Worship. The same Order you may see ver. 11.12. the whole Chapter, etc.
containing brief and cursory Memorandum's to Moses of Laws partly moral and
partly ceremonial. Whereas, that of Ex. 20.12. (written at first with the Sea
page 10. k.
Finger of God, and often Deu. 5.16. Ephesians. 6.2.
repeated, especially by the Mat. 15.4. and 19 19. M. 7.10. and 10 19. L. 18.20.

best knew and knows his Fathers meaning) is Deu. 5.29. and 6.6, etc. Ps.

fundamental, moral, forcible and perpetual, and generally followed in the
Order of mentioning Father and Mother throughout the Scripture. He might have
backed it also, with Lev. 21.3. which (if we hit it aright) helps to illustrate
the other, and clears our Answer. This latter is concluded in a mere
ceremonial and Col. 2.21.22. Heb. 9 8 9,10.
fading Precept; wherein the Mother was forenamed for another special
Purpose, viz. to show the degrees of propinquity of kindred in Case of
defilement by dead Bodies. And we have yet a saying, That The Mother is the
surer side, because she is the Vessel of Conception and Procreation. In which
respect the holy Penman, begins there with the Mother, and so goes on to the
remoter degrees of Kindred. Now, if we take this for her Pre-eminence, why may
we not as well prefer the ground or soil to the seed or sower? See Genesis 3.15.
(which the same Expositor, on Super. L. 8.11.
another Occasion, declined.) But if some put the daughter Repentance, Why not,
also, the Son before the Father? as Isa. 45.4.
before the Mother Faith (which we may suppose but heedlesly or hastily done)
these may as well, or better, beseem to prefer or equalize the Wife to the
Husband. Its no sure dawbing Ez. 13.14. 2 Co. 4.2.

Object. 5.
However, yet, There are some Women 1 S. 25.25.
more wise and able to manage either temporal or spiritual Matters then some
Men; which may seem (where such are married together) not only to debarr the
Husbands Beating, but to discharge the Wife of Obedience or any Dutiful
Observance.

Answ.
It is granted that there seems in some Women, a more masculine spirit then
in some Men. And (if such Matching be admissible, while both are free) it is
(in my weak opinion) more tolerable for a Wise Man to take a silly Woman to
Wife, then a wise Woman to admit a weak-witted Man to her Husband: From whence
(may be) the taunting Proverb grew; For a Lock of Land (or other carnal End)
to take a Fool by the Hand. Therefore, that wise Woman whatever, having made
her Choice is worthily concluded (for ought we see to the contrary) under
absolute Obedience in Ephesians. 5.24.
all Things lawful, honest or indifferent (if not ridiculous) though it suit
not with her Pr. 30.12,13. and 26.12. Eccl. 7.16. Pr. 3.7.
presumed sounder discretion; and, consequently, for disobedience, liable to
like Censure as other Women. A Virtuous Woman, indeed, is above her Husband;
but how? as a Ps. 12.4. See pa. 47.
Crown, not a Commander; as an Ornament, not an Officer. Yea, in this sense
she may serve as a Covering also; That is, so far as her prudence extends,
she may and must cover his Infirmities and Imperfections, not his Power; (she
is every way to Genesis 2.18.20. Pr 31.12.
help, no way to hinder him.) Else, what does she (beside the sin of
disobedience and 1 S. 15.23.
Rebellion, which is as Witchcraft and Idolatry) but proclaim to the World her
own Woe, and (silly Wretch! though never so seeming Wise,) wound Genesis 2.24. Ps.
64.8. Mat. 19.5,6 1 Co. 6.16. Ephesians. 5.31.
her self through his sides? No doubt, but David had been appeased with the
Present, or very Presence of 1 S. 25.18, etc.
Abigail, without her publishing and pleading her Husbands Folly; which, yet,
consisted (as appears by his Verse 10,11.
pertinent though perverse Reasoning) not in weakness of brain, but a wicked,
churlish and base Niggardise. And since some will needs be so Eccl. 7.16. Pr.
3.7.
overwise and worthy, 1 Co. 4.6.
above that which is Written; let it not seem altogether unreasonable, to
reason a little with them in their own Dialect, thus: Were they so wise before
they wedded, they could not, surely, be ignorant, That their Husband, must be
their 1 Co. 11.3. Ephesians. 5.^3.
Head, the Genesis 20.16.
Covering of their Eyes, etc. Why, then, would they make Choice of so crazy a
Cranium; that, though he be called the Head, yet they must be both the Brains
and Cap. That, instead of his Covering their Eyes, they must cover his Eyes,
Head and all, and lead him hoodwinck'd abroad and about, or rather, coop him up
at home. Have Ps. 14.4.
these workers of Iniquity no knowledge at all? Might they not, else, perceive
how eminently this Badge appears upon them; to wit, that they, of all other
Impudents, do most Ph. 3.19.
glory in, and Jude 13.
foam out, their own shame? If (I say) they be so wise, a Word is enough: They
will know or learn, what is either piously to be done, or patiently endured.

Object. 6.
None but drunken, disordered, profane, and (as they call them) desperate
fellows, beat their Wives. Besides, it is an horrible, inhumane Thing to strike
a Man's Wife; What! beat his own Flesh? why, Ephesians. 5.29.
No Man ever yet hated his own Flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as
the Lord the Church.

This Objection, proceeds either from Persons strictly pious, of a
conscientious, (but (as will appear) erroneous and cruel) pity and tenderness;
or from another laxed sort of Christians (the vulgar-open Profane we heed not)
whose weekday converse can suit with carnal or worse Company; and on the
Lords day, who but they with their Godly Pastor? Or rather Athenians may we
term them, who affect and profess to know all Things, new or old; in plainer
terms, Politicians, Temporizers, or what ye will. To both these shall be shaped
suitable Answers; to the one religious, to the other rational, as God
enableth. And first to the worthier, the former.

Answ. 1.
The first clause of the Objection cannot be wholly or altogether true. And yet
it must be granted to have too much of Truth in it; the more, the more sin and
pity. For such men (we believe) are utterly without Warrant: and of these it
may be justly said, Ia. 1.20.
The Wrath of Man works not the righteousness of God. 2. As the Objectors
will have much ado to prove their negative; so, in this case, it is not easy,
nor, indeed, convenient, to prove the Affirmative; for this very reason (if no
more) that Wise and Godly Men, do, or should, go more privately about this Work,
then the other are wont to do, that scandal may be prevented.

To the second clause, may be answered. 1. Correction properly taken, is so far
from betokening hatred, that its plentifully See p. 42. h. ult.
proved consistent with the choicest Affection, yea the surest Argument of it.
And, as the Word Ephesians. 5.29.
hated, here, relates to, or reflects upon our own Flesh, it may be somewhat
enlarged and illustrated by that of Christ, Mat. 18.9, etc. See Jo. 12.25.
If thy right Eye or right hand offend thee, pluck it out, cut it off etc.
Which most do (and likely may) take in a spiritual sense of abandoning the
Bosom and darling sin; for, else, the cutting, mangling and maiming of our sound
Bodies, were degrees of Genesis 9.5,6. Ex. 20.13. Deu. 5.17 Mat. 5.21. and 19.18.
M. 10.19. L. 18.20. To. 13.9.
Murder, which is directly forbidden. Yet, thus far (I suppose) we may take it
literally; as, by any hardship or harsh discipline, (which may not endanger
life) to subdue our unruly Members. Further, As God Ez. 11.19. and 36.26.
takes, the stony heart out of our Flesh, which implies a spiritual Anatomy or
Incision; and as we permit the Cutting away of proud or corrupt Flesh, or a
festerd Limb, to prevent Infection and spreading; so, why may not the most
pious, tender hearted Husband, deal in like sort with his perverse Wife, viz.
(not touching or impairing the Quick, the life) to pare away (as it were) her
Nails or noxious Excrescences, as he would do the luxuriant Branches, or
exuberant Twigs, of his choicest Fruit-Tree) whereby to abate or allay the
contagious Humors in her: and where Lenitives fail to assuage the Rankness, to
apply Corrosives, though with great Care and discretion. It is said indeed,
Col. 3.19.
Husbands be not bitter against them; but then (see the Verse 18.
leading Condition.) they must not be boisterous and rebellious both against
God and their Husbands; If so, what sweetness ought they to expect from either?
See again Ephesians. 5.29,30.
2. That Christ himself ever did, and does (as need requires) actually, and often
times, extremely, chastise his Church, his Wife, as well as cherish her, and
that in his Maritall or Conjugall Relation, has been amply declared. p. 36. d.
etc. to which the Reader is referred.

Answ. 2.
Now to our forenamed Politicians, etc. We can return no fitter Answer, then
refer them to rational and civil Rules, (whereof they will disdain to be
deemed ignorant) viz. to the Common or Statute Laws of their own Nation: Which,
in their prudent Care of preserving and cherishing the life natural, do thus
provide, in case of Extremity, That the Wife may demand Surety (for the Peace,
not good Behavior) against the Husband, if he threaten to kill or outragiously
to Beather, etc. Wherein is manifestly employed and allowed a moderate
Correction. And hence let us reason thus: If the Common Laws, being so tender
of the corporal life, do yet admit a moderate correcting of a Man's Wife for
Reformation of civil Manners, and a temporal Quiet; how can it but follow a
fortiori, that the spiritual and divine Law permits a proportional
Chastisement, to conserve and cherish life eternal, to deliver a soul Pr.

This asserting of the Husbands punitive or corrective Power, may prove not
only a loosing of the Rains, to the reasonless Frenzy and rage of every rude
Fellow; but an Inlet of too much Liberty, even to loving Husbands.

Honor by either, but gets by both. We should deem it Madness, (as a
Gospell-Friend fitly notes) to go naked, lest we should be proud; to destroy
Vines, lest any be drunk; or to provide Food, lest we be gluttonous. For the
Barbarous, brutish, ferall Brood of Husbands and Wives; there will befall them
a particular Word of Caution anon. But, for the Present, I know no safer, nor
sounder Rule to go by, then what the Apostle gives generally; Gal. 5.13.
Brethren, ye have been called unto Liberty; Only use not Liberty, for an

I suppose all Objections of weight or Worth, have received Answer and
competent satisfaction; if by chance we meet any more, we shall endeavor the
like. Wherein, if ought seem bitter, tart or crude, let it be candyed or
concocted thus: I presume all sorts of Objectors, to have godly and virtuous,
or (at least) kind and quiet Wives; and so to be less sensible of others

on easy or slender Occasion. And, indeed, the Spirit of God, seems Deu. 19.6.
to presuppose (I say not permit) some Passion in the purest of Men. But, in
imitation of Moses, or other Number. 25.7,8. 1 S. 25.13,22,34. M. 3.17. L. 9.54.
choice Favorites or Officers of God, we are (I confess) to be very cautious
and tender; and to be sure it is, as theirs, in the Cause and Quarrel of God.

I say, it is easy to be meek unmoved. Hence it is, That some out of Tenderness,
others of a conceited Equality (as above) do neither inflict nor allow Blows;
Not having the Occasion themselves, they distaste the Action in others; which
(if they heed their Jer. 17.9.
own Hearts well) they shall find true in other things too. But (briefly, as
the result of what is already said) This may be modestly maintained, and boldly
believed; That, as it is not possible to produce any grounded Expression or
Argument, against a good Man's Beating his bad Wife; so there do appear many
strong Consequences, and pregnant Arguments from the sacred Word (especially)
to approve it. There seeming but this difference of Power 'twixt Christ and the
pious Husband; That Christ is the supreme Lord Paramount, the Other, his
Delegate or vicegerent; Christ may kill, or correct the Body at his Pleasure,
Job 9.12,17. and 23.13. and 33.13. Eccl. 8.4. Jon. 1.4.
without Account (though his goodness usually gives it) but Man may not do the
first Ex. 20.13. Deu. 5.17. Mat. 19.18. M. 10.19. L. 18.20. To. 13.9.
at all; nor the second in any Case, without Deu. 13.14. and 17.4
manifest and weighty Cause. But that granted; Christ is, sometimes, so nearly
concerned and so highly affronted by Offenders, that he has not only allowed,
but enjoined his People of old, Deu. 13.6. to 11 and 19.11,12,13. and 25.12.
to set apart all humane Relation, Affection and Compassion in Punishing: which
(I confess) is not imitable by us, but with all Caution and good Conscience.
And this leads us on nearer the Quick, viz. the moving Causes (if so they may
seem) which may incite or warrant, a Man to the last and worst of Remedies,
Correction.

CHAP. VII. Conjectures at the Causes and Measure of Correction.
IN declaring hereof, we are to have a twofold Respect: 1. Unto Women who are
ingenuous, acute and of perfect or competent Gifts or Qualities of Mind; who,
as they may wilfully, so they cannot but knowingly offend. 2. To such as are
defective, weak or silly (as they say) and may offend of simplicity: who,
doubtless, are to be treated with much more Indulgence, and therefore shall be
dismissed with less Ado. Yet with this general Rule observable in them as in
all others; to wit, The more Knowledge, Will, Height and Custom, do appear and
prevail in sinning, the sorer stroke and dint may justly be expected in
suffering. We chiefly follow the knowing and yet L. 12.47.
wilful Offenders.

And here, it must be laid for a Ground; That, as the impulsive Cause of
Christ's correcting his Church is sin; so the Husband must, in no Case act or
attempt it, without a sinful Cause in the Wife; nor yet for any sinful Cause
neither. Its not for every trifling Contradiction or slight Affront to start a
Fray. I am not ignorant, that, In the first place, Many familiar Compellations
in a loving Way, are and ought to be embraced by the Husband from the Wife. 2.
I will suppose the kindest Couples in the World (some very few excepted) to be
scarce free from Houshold-talk (as they term it) or, perhaps, some hot Fits of
dispute; yet ought to pass for loving and loyal too.

The Wife must not be forgotten, till she forget her self, to be the Weaker
Vessel. In this (especially) let the Ph. 2.5. To. 15.1. 1 P. 3.8.
same heroic Mind be in us that was in Christ Jesus, To whom David complained
Ps. 130.3.
If thou Lord should mark Iniquities, O Lord, Who shall stand? Even the Isa.
57.16.
spirit should fail before thee, and the souls which thou have made. And we
must not conceive of Christ, as one that expects so regular and exact a Carriage
in any of us, Male or Female, as to render us harmless and blameless; much
less, One that lies at Catch or advantage to take us tripping; as if we had a
strength of our own distinct from his, whereby to stand against, or without
him. For why, then, needed he be Heb. 5.1,2.
ordained an high Priest to have Compassion on the ignorant and them that are
out of Jer. 6.16. Ps. 119.14.
the way? (For, while we stay or start aside, to play with this or that Toy and
Trifle, he tarries on us, and will not away without us: he will not leave, nor
lose one, but the Jo. 17.12.
Son of Perdition, etc. though we are inconstant, he Mal. 3.6.
changes not; yea, though we 2 T. 2.13.
believe not, he abides Faithful, he cannot deny himself.) Or, what needed he
be Heb. 4.15.
tempted in all points as we are; but that he might be touched with the feeling
of our Infirmities, and be able Heb. 2.18.
to succor the tempted? to 2 Co. 12.9. Ps. 55 22. Isa. 41.10.
support us in all our weaknesses, or (rather) Isa. 53.4. Mat. 8.17.
sustain them for us? For, although never any Temptation Heb. 4.15.
could fasten on him, or Jo. 14.30.
find place with him; yet, was he more forcibly, and (no doubt) as frequently
assaulted as we.

Causes in particular.
This Correction, then (if allowable at all) must be for no less, then high,
heady, habitual sins and Affronts. And these. 1. Against God; striking at his
sovereignty, by denying or disputing his Power and Providence; by blaspheming
his Name and Word, with horrid Oaths and Execrations; by reproaching his
Religion, Truth and People, with Taunts, Invectives and the like.

2. Against her Husband; Either, 1. In his superiority, as he is Gods deputy
and vicegerent over her; For, whom does she reproach and blaspheme? Not (
Hezekiah, not) her Husband, but Isa. 37.23. 1 Th. 4.8.
the holy one of Israel, and Tit. 2.5
his holy Word: by lifting up her hand against him, in the lowest or least
Degree: by not only neglecting, but contemning and rejecting his pious, just,
or reasonable Commands, and pleading against his Prerogative and Power. It may
be wished this Infirmity were less predominant in many of the weaker Vessels.
Where subjection is yielded due, (although but lame and imperfect in the
Performance) it mollifieth much, and hides a multitude of Infirmities; 1 T.
2.12.
But when Gods Ordinances are struck or levelled at so near the root; the Fence
had need be the firmer, the Repulses more impetuous or forcible. He that
magnifies the rib so much: If he shall find it not content (according to its
natural Inclination) to ly crooked by his side, but across at his Head; will
he think it seemly or sufferable? I suspect not. Or 2. In his
Personall-domestick Quiet; by customary scolding, railing and Clamors, against
him (especially) or others in his Presence, with uncoth and odious Names, or
bitter and biting Terms. Or 3. In his Credit and Reputation: by either Raising,
seconding or seeming to countenance or allow any scandal or Reproach upon him,
abhorring (as some do) to hear of the least Good, or good Parts in him, as if a
part of her Reproach and Infamy. Or 4. In his Estate: by wilful, excessive and
sinful Wast, unto Riot and Luxury.

3. Against their Neighbors: by sowing discord among them, or betwixt any and
her Husband: by frequent scolding, Reviling, Tale-bearing, and the like.

And all, or any, of this, after and in contempt of the fair and frequent
Expostulation of her Husband, and when neither Persuasion or Reproof can
penetrate. If these, I say, or any of these, be wilfully persisted in by the
Wife after Reproof; where, now, lies a Man's Relief for himself, or hope of her
Reformation? It will not be much unseasonable, here to insert, how that when I
asked an esteemed able Minister of the Gospel, what course was to be taken for
Coertion or Reducement of an unreasonable-unruly Woman, He replied (adding that
it was also the Resolution of other Judicious Divines in this very Case) That
even in point of Scandal where the Wife is notoriously in Fault; yet the
harmless Husband is to be convened and questioned by the Church. It should seem
then (I said) That you account of the Husband as Judge, Justice and Bishop to
the Wife: He replied, yes.

The Ecclesiastical Power, then (it seems) will not interpose 'twixt Man and
Wife herein at all. What the Civil or secular Power can do, I perfectly know
not; but, I suppose it will not meddle, except in case of extreme Cruelty and
mortal danger. It seems the Wife is Exlex out of all Jurisdiction.
So that the Husband (by like) has no Refuge or Remedy left him, in any lower
Respect, but his own Power and Prudence; Nor these neither, if he be strictly
restraind (as in the Objection) to Prayer, Patience and Humiliation. But I hear
it Objected again.

Object.
Why, Those Virago's are but rare, that will offer any such violence or vile
Indignities, to God or their Husband, as are laid down: If any do, the Man must
demean and defend himself, as well as he may: And for the Trespass of the
Tongue, it is not worth heeding or talking of, Words are but Wind; a Woman has
none other Weapon; she is the weaker Vessel, and must be born with, and the
like.

Answ. 1.
Yea, many such Man-keen Amazons, no doubt, there are in the World; that mantle
it both against God and their Husbands; These, God will surely, deal withal,
if Man cannot.

must show us better Warrant for their Exemption and Liberty, then their bare

in the Church, as in Market or other Meetings. But let us once more salute

blow the Bellows, it often proves so venomous and violent, as to blast or bear
down all before it. Words are their only Weapons: Be it so, and while they
are defensive, it were Cruelty and Inhumanity to disarm them: But, often times,
so unruly, keen, and rancorous are they; as that in David's, and others Account,
they are Offensive Pr. 14.3.

Arrows, Ps. 55.21. and 57.4. and 64.3. and 59.7. Pr. 12.18.

VVomens Tongues, as ill as Men's, says, That the Jer. 18.18.
Tongue smites. James, calls it Ja. 3.6.
a Fire that sireth the Course of Nature, and for a sound Reason; it is
enflamed (says he) of Hell: Satan is, still blowing the Bellows. Thus we see
reproachful Words (whose-ever they be) are fiery, piercing and poisonous; and
we might (in Satan's own sense) add Am. 7.10.
ponderous too. Now, we are exhorted Ia. 4.7.
to resist the Devil. And how this? By soothing him up in his Words? By
letting him beard us, and ( 2 S. 20.9,10.
Joab-like) sheath his Sword in our Bowels? crush and consume us? Surely nay.
In short: Which of themselves, will not censure it most unseemly and sordid
for a Man to vy words, or scould it out with a Woman, referring the Victory to
the last and loudest Syllable? Yet it must needs be tried thus, when weight and
worth of Argument fails him; unless he be allowed a Casting Voice, and Powin
his hand to weild it.

3.
Customary Scoulding and Clamor (which we account but the lowest Classis or
Form of corrigible Offenses) is no Argument of weakness, but of a stubborn and
sinful strength; and by how much ofter it resists Admonition, it is so much
the more 1 T. 2.12.
rebellious and abominable. Shall any dare to think, That ever the holy Spirit
intended a Woman to be Tongue-free? to rail, rage, swear, blaspheme and defy
Isa. 37.23.
Heaven and her Husband? to smite and wound whom, where and when she likes,
and fly out into all Exorbitances without Control, because (forsooth) she is
the weaker Vessel? Surely, there is none awake, or in his right Wits will say,
or think it. For, if the Conversation of Ph. 3.20.
Paul, and 1 Jo. 1.3. L. 17.21.
other Saints be in Heaven; where shall we conclude such as this to be? To
Illustrate this Answer a little: If there be no heed to be taken of Women's
Words, why is the prudent and pious Behavior of Ex. 1.19,20. and 35.25,26.
Jos. 2.4,5, etc. Jud. 4.4,5,18. and 5. all. 1 S. 1.16,17. and 25,24 etc.
28.14.12, etc and 17.17,19. and 20 16. to 22. 2 K. 4.9 10,13,28. and 22.15,16.
L. 1. 46. etc. and 2.36, etc.
many of them so carefully recorded in Scripture? Are they prais-worthy and
Mat. 26.13. M. 14.9.
renowned when good, and not pernicious and worthily infamous when evil? can
their virtuous Acts and Expressions be exemplary, their vicious Ones not
pestilent and odious?

These, or some of these Offenses before mentioned, may seem, necessary or safe
Inducements, to correct or chasten Any, over whose Body we have Command, and of
whose soul we take any Christian Care or Compassion at all; for which they that
will, may see as good Warrant (at least) as for the good Abearing. Did Job
2.6,7,8.
God let loose the malice and rage of Satan, to torment and mangle the Body of
that harmless Patient to the very brink of Death, for but mere Trial and
Triumph; and does he restrain the pious Love of a prudent Husband, from Am.
3.11.
plucking a Brand out of the fire (of Hell) even the soul of his Wife, who is a
part of himself, out of the Paws of Satan? Shall it be necessary to marry, 1
Co. 7.9.
rather then to burn corporally and temporally, (which burning it self is not
without other Means of Cure); and is it unnecessary, unlawful, (with a little
corporal violence) to prevent a spiritual eternal Burning, which is
incureable? All this, still, inforceth no Man's Faith, Let Men believe (not as
they list, but) as they Ephesians. 2.8. Ja. 1.17
may.

The Measure.
We are, now come to the cloze. viz. in what Measure this Correction (if any)
is to be inflicted. Herein we find no express Rules or Limits left us by our
Master Christ, other, then the Ex. 20.13.
sixth moral Commandment. Which (we believe) he would not have omitted, if
material, or that he had not endued our Husband (as all other superiors) with
plentiful Abilities; or not given him general Hints and directions enough,
how to carry himself, becoming his Place and Power. Howbeit, even Humanity
teaches Moderation and Clemency; and the civil State (as before) has
wholsomly provided Security in this kind (for else every barbarous and brainous
Fellow, may pretend Discretion and Piety enough, to cloak or color his
Cruelty, if lawful power should not interpose to examine and determine) But
chiefly Christ himself in his sacred Word, sets us forth certain common Mic.

As a Corollary or Summary to what has been said of the Maritall Knowledge and
Power; it may be remembered how copiously and clearly the former has been
derived, from God the living and eternal Fountain thereof, into the Hearts of
Men and chiefly of the Husband, his nearest Relative; enabling him to the
complete Discharge (in his gracious Acceptance) of his Place and Trust. And
next; how demonstrating the Carriage of Christ toward his Spouse, his Church,
we have, thence, deduced a Ephesians. 5.^3.
Similar Power of Practice (with Limitation) to the pious Husband; adding some
Reasons and Rules (if he please) of his Proceeding.

This Tract, or rather Bundle of Laborious Collections, (for it is but little
else; save the tacking together) being a Task too low for Men of sublime
Endowments and weighty Incumbencies to stoop unto, or wait upon; this laborious
Collective (I say) is infinitely short of that exact and artificial
Compilement, it might have received at their hands. Yet before any accuse me of
a too ambitious Attempt herein, let them compare and weigh my unfain'd Apology
at the Entrance, together with my urgent Incitements hereunto, and (I hope)
they will not only absolve and Pardon, but pity me.

Wherein, therefore, it is scanty or weak only, let them contribute of their
store and strength, to supply and confirm: where unsound or suspected, let
them, on better grounds, refine and reform. I may be erroneous, I will not be
haereticall: a calm and just Conviction shall be my acquiescent Satisfaction,
whereunto (I need not lose all my Labor) I am thus much nearer then before.
Mine Eye is not upon any Triumph, but the Truth. Neither affront I any; but in
a modest humble way of Argument, seek only to satisfy my self and other
Christians in my Condition. Nor yet that, in any haughty Conceit of directing
them (for I freely leave all Men to be steered by their strongest Motives) but
chiefly to manifest, that God in his Mercy and for his Glory (I disclaim even a
thought of Arrogance, and Job 42.6.
abhor my self in Dust and Ashes) has given me such a Competency of Knowledge
and Composure of Mind (here is the worst and utmost of my Ambition) as to move
within my own Sphaere, and to order Those, who (instead of discharging their
due Observance and subjection) have sought to Order Me. I desire withal it may
be remembered, that here is nothing determinate but discussive; nor contentious,
but disquisitive. In all which regards, if it must in any Part be confuted, I
cannot suspect it worse, then with Fatherly Indulgence or Brotherly Meekness.

CHAP. VIII. Some Additionals coincident with the Occasion of this Discourse.
THe diviner Parts (as we may term them) of this Treatise, being providencially
disposed and included in the middle of this Manual, as the Kernel in the
Shell, or, the Marrow in the Bone, and now (in such manner as God will) newly
molded and dispatched; I proceed to some further needful or useful

It is to be doubted, that I have been all this while (at least) incurring the
black and bitter Invectives of some, and the milder suspicion of most, as for a
terrible Striker, and (in their sense) an Abuser of my Wife. For, what need I
else (may they demand) make so much ado to vindicate or excuse the Matter? but,
rather pass it over as other patient and prudent Men do.

Herein, I hope I shall, at once, both still the Censure of the One, and settle
the suspense of the Other. For although I think it not expectable, nor much
expedient, that I proclaim or display my own Practice in Particulars; yet I
shall dishonor God, and betray Christian Liberty and Integrity if (in gross) I
conceal all the Truth. I or mine shall not make dainty of a little disgrace,
rather then God (since he puts me to it) shall be pinched in his Glory.

call God for a record upon my soul, before Men and Angels, that (to spare and
indulge her Person, how warrantable I am not well assured) it never yet entered
into mine Intent to beat my Wife; much less has any stroke over-slipt me to
her since we met; unless this may be called beating or striking, That, at one
time only (of innumerable Provocations) when, after mild Admonition, she
would not forbear Swearing; but let fly 2. or 3. bloody, horrid Oaths in my
Face, I bestowed so many Flaps with my bare hand alone on her Mouth, the Part
offending; which is more (too) then can be testified. Neither did I offer this,

be wicked or sinful, (which it either is, or is not; To. 14.23
Faith makes no Medium) I cannot have justly incurred the Account of a
Wife-Beater, (one Swallow makes no Summer): Nor, if my foregoing Affirmative
may carry Credence, shall I be deemed (with Christians) any great Bracticer in
that Faculty, neither very prone or apt unto it. Yea, so sound and sensible
civil Arguments (besides religious) may be rendered for it; as that any
rational, ingenuous, unprejudiced Person, would believe my bare Assertion; or
rather not believe me, though I should swear I would do it. But some are so
transcendently sharp-sighted, that Mat. 13.13. Isa. 29.14.

yea, the wholesome Food Job 23.11,12.
and Viaticum of my Life: to dishonor my God, my Lord and Master, and to
endanger (by Admission of evil Precedents) the Corruption of the
Commonwealth. Only, give me leave, (not as touching or intending any
private-particular Person, but an Officer; not for Exprobration, but fair and
needful Caution) to recite a short Passage in my own Presence. It happened,
That while I was (but once, as yet, in all my days) engaged in the attendance
of a Constable home to his house; R. C.
He finding his Wife somewhat loud with a girl, which it seemed was his (not
her) daughter; He menaced her, That if she spoke another Word, he would set
her Head in the Fire, or bind her to a Tree and beat her: and to that end went
forth and fetched a strong Rope and a Cudgel and showed her; devoutly swearing
(for you will imagine him a sworn-Man) that he would do it, if Justice such a One
(whom he knew me to know) stood over him. (he was then no further active,
though its reported usual with him) Indeed he threatened his daughter also, and
more cause (I conceived) he had; for, in my hearing, the Maid both Thou-ed and
threatened the Mother, which was more then ever I heard before. The good Wife
wept, and yet wrought hard (in making Bread for her fierce Husband and his
Family) but her Tongue still as busy as her hands, not in any abusive Terms to
her Husband, but as being daily thus affronted (as she said, and not unlikely)
by her Inferior. This same Constable a few days after, arguing Me of stiffness
(for standing on my Innocence) I replied: Will you To. 2.21,22, etc
condemn me for but the suspicion of That, whereof you both confess and
manifest your self really guilty? He roundly answered me in these Terms; What
tell thou Me? I dare do that which thou dare not. Meaning (which we are
not ignorant of) he had a Friend in Court: and he had plainly affirmed to me
before, that I was juggled withal and overpowered. It seems the plain-old
Proverb continues true, Some may better steal an Horse, then others look over
the Hedge.

State or Statute-Affairs, further then a conscionable Obedience requires, or a

and good Grounds, under fit Penalties both to the Judge and Suggestor: That, in
Expedition of all such Acts, Unseemly Seats of Justice.
Alehouses might be avoided, unless in Itinere, for urgent Cause, or eminent
Convenience: That a civil-honest Man in Travel, and a Gent. at any time, might

not notoriously offensive, but his needfully defensive Arms, which Christ

Sealed, shut, or shadowed upon them? The lack of this Candor and openness in
the Carriage of the Laws, enforces Men into more Errors, then else they needed

there were less Law, and more Gospel, a privater Composure of conjugall Discord
(at least) might be assayed by some in Authority, rather then (at first dash,
and part altera inaudita) the Matter promoted to their Judicatories: unless
the Offender be notorious, refractory and reasonless.

wronged, also, by fained Information) an honest harmless Man, shall be hurried
out of Doors to Prison or Bondage; Or, if poor Commoners shall be ordered or
exampled by such Constables and Conservators as before described (which we are
confident, never was nor is intended, or understood by supreme Authority) Nos
Miseros! Quis enim conservabit ipsos Conservatores? What Inno cence or
Integrity is it that shall protect or secure a Man? Or, how shall he know when
he has or is his own? Should the Staff and Sword be put or kept in such Hands,
to lay about them as they list; whom may they not (whom will they care to) hit,
hurt or wound? being alike apt to Ps. 37.14.
slay the upright, and 1 K. 20.42. 1 S. 15.9. Isa. 5.23. Pr. 17.15.
spare the wicked. Doubtless, such were never mercifully disign'd by God, ad
Pacem conservandam, but wrathfully destinated by him ad pacem consternandam.
Flagella Sponsi: whereof (we may suppose) he means where he says, Mat. 10.34.
I came not to send Peace, but a Sword. Places of Judicature give no Liberty to
exercise or express Passion, but Pains; they are, or ought to be, esteemed
rather Onus then Honos, Moses being conscious hereof, complained, Number. 11.14,15.
I am not able to bear all this People alone, because it is too heavy for Me.
And if thou deal thus with me kill me I pray thee, out of hand, etc. And
therefore no doubt but a Writ of Ease is as welcome to an upright Man, as a
Commission of Power; so that all Seekers in this kind (especially) may justly
be suspected.

Some Motives to the divulging hereof, are declared at the Page 8. etc.
Beginning. Let none take Offense (so God be glorified) that I add one or 2.
More. As 1. That in my Defenses, I have not had to deal with simple Swains, like
my self; but with politic and powerful Persons; and not a single, but a
twined Authority. (a strong disswasive to One natural bashful, not bold.) 2.
With Her, also, Who, as she could not allege Inmaturity of Years, so scorned
she to acknowledge Ignorance or simplicity: One that, indeed, was ingenuous,
aged, experienced; a frequent Reader in Scripture; an audible and earnest
Orator at set hours of Prayer; a public Hearer of Sermons (but not in society
with, or subjection to her Husband, that were base; and yet debar her the House
of God (so she accounted the Common Place of Assembly) o that were damnable!)
One (when she pleased) of a seeming-civil Deportment, and good (I mean,
composed) Expression: One (which I might have placed before) that was expressly
approved to me by a godly Minister, without which Encouragement I had not
adventured: Goodness (God is Witness) being, even then, my optimate and
ultimate (I need not say my sole) Aim and End in Marriage. Let the choicest of
Gods Children examine their heart herein, and reflect on the 2. Ans. to the 3.
Obj. And (which is the drift hereof) let them consider withal, how easily the
World may be gulled, or even their own charitable opinions deluded, with the
specious Appearances of those that can be Saints in Profession, but Devils in
Practice ( Mat. 24.24. 2 Co. 11.14.
its possible there may be such): How far a smooth Tale, perhaps soupled with
Tears, and tip'd with a seeming-lawfull Oath, may slide, insinuate and
prevail, especially into prepared Ears; and what a Gangrene this may grow to
(if not wisely foreseen and salved) in the Commonwealth. 3. The Eyes of a
County (at least) was upon this Proceeding which (for ought you have heard)
might have kept within the Curtains: and it has been told me (nemo ringatur
aut sugilles) That I had already given ill Example against good Wives, many of
whom (by like) had used, or looked, to rule a little more then the Roast: and
lest mad Husbands get too much Head, it were (said they) good looking to them
betime; they had a fair Hint given for helping themselves.

Now (we must, here, needs enlarge a little) Whether we ought to obey Women
(not to say, Acts 5.29. and 4.19.
Men) rather then God, Judge Ye. Let no Tit 2 15.
Man (much less a Est. 1.17. Tant^ eru aliis, quant^ tibi fu^ris.
Woman, thy Wise) despise thee, for shame, apage! I know not whether of the
two, were more tolerable to suffer that, or to say this, Oderint dum metuant.
But, verily, even Est 1.22.
Ahasuerus and his Heathens, shall rise in Judgment against those We are What
we dare. Hic Mulier. A pretty hearing.
hindish Husbands, Who (Men of Parts especialy) do basely betray Gods Image and
Authority, imprinted in, and entrusted to them, unto scorn and reproach: Not in
a godly, discreet and compassionate yiedling, as to the weaker Vessel; but in
a sheepish Lenity (at best, but to gain applause of loving and lowly) and
slavish succumbing unto, and thereby fomenting, the petulant and malignant, yea
the lofty, violent and vicious Humors of their Wives. Which, it seems, is not
attended only with Reproach, but disprofit: Ill thrives that luckless Family
that shows
A Cock that's silent, and a Hen that Crows, etc. Incerti Auth.

The rest I have not ready in mind, nor will stay for it.

Of this sort, for certain, are even those Levites, Who cannot allow themselves
of the 1 Co. 9.14.
Fruits of their own precious Labors, Whether these be Objects of pity, or
reproof and reproach, I dispute not.
Quo decenter amiciantur; while Pride prevails so far with Covetousness in
their Wives, (who are presumed the best and humblest of Women) as to rufflle it

more then all other, forget themselves, yea their Ps. 44.21.
God and Husband? are these fit 1 P. 5.3. Ph. 3.17 1 T. 4.12. Tit. 2.7

Let no Man (or Woman) despise thee, is primary and proper to them. Let them,
therefore, either lift up their Head-ship, and show it us, or else lay by the
Title, least it mislead us. They best know, sunt quod audent: No more but so.

These and other more private and powerful Incentives, have concurred to the
publication hereof; as if it had been prepared by divine providence (against or
beside which I know nothing can be; but, I say purposly framed and fitted) to
be public and exemplary; And who knows whether God has chosen so weak and
worthless an Instrument to resist and baffle base Pride and Insolence? Or,
whether I be the silly Wretch designed by him for Est. 4.14.
such a Time and service as this? And, surely, high time it is that many of our
wilful- weak Vessels were talked withal in some Way obvious to their
Senses; seeing the Heb. 4.12. See p. 14. y.
quick and powerful Word of God seems so dull and despicable a Thing to
their spirits; some of them by contracting an habitual Insolence, being
already turned Amazons, and almost ( viz. in high degree) Genesis 6.4. Which of
some, is conceived to be meant not so much of their enlarged stature of Body,
as their swelling insolence of mind above Men, against God: and so not to be
taken in the same sense with those Number. 13.32,33. Deu. 2.10,11,20,21. and 3.11.

CHAP. IX. The Conclusion.
I Sum up all in a swasive Address or Application: and I suppose, I shall
speak the Mind of all or most that bear the name of honest or good Men. Let
it, in the 1. Place be odious to hear of meum and tuum, mine and thine, betwixt
Man and Wife. Certainly, Christ never intended it; He refused to divide betwixt
L. 12.14.
two Brethen; how much more would he have done 'twixt Mat. 19.6.
one Flesh? But, if there be any distinction at all, let it be understood
aright, and the Prerogative and Property ascribed as God has appointed. 2. Let
our animous Women begin to do, or endeavor their due Homage, and they shall
have due Honor: Let them first (for so they must) walk carefully to please God
and their Husband; and then shall he dwell knowingly (yea, in their own sense,
kindly, tenderly and patiently) with them: Let them perform or yield their due
Obedience; and then, if they fall short of due Benevolence or other fit
Obsequies and fair Allowances of Love, they may take their best and next
Remedy. And (let other men do as they list or may) I will expect that if I
speak in honest-sensible-sober Earnest, my Wife, if I have her, shall be silent
when I bid her: which I am sure is agreeable to the Teutonick Translation or
sense of the Sacred Scripture, and I suppose to the British too. On these
Conditions, let him be branded for a Barbarian and Heathen, that in the least
wise abuses or evil entreats his Wife. Were there more Sarah's and
Abigail's, there would (probably) be more Abraham's and fewer Nabal's. They
begin at the wrong End of the Proverb (if they apply it hither-ward) that say,
A good Jack makes a good Jill. For (for by their Leave) its the Jill that must
lead the Duty.

But, if they will needs forget themselves to be Wives, their Husbands must yet
remember they are so: If they be so insulse and impudent, as to vilify, affront
and defy their Husband (under that Notion especially) That is, if they will be
so 2 P. 3.5.
willingly and grossly ignorant, as not to know their Head from their Feet,
they must be satisfied with Fare suitable to their Ps. 32.9.
Manners, not their Means or Manors: for, how can they in reason claim so
copious an Alimony, or kind Usage, if they scorn or scant their Husband of that
Authority afterward, which God gave and themselves granted him, at First. Or,
if they make no dainty to strike at their Head (though but in Word only, they
have heard it wounds deeply) they must not disdain a little scratch on their
Body, or to be deplum'd of a little Pride by their discreet and conscientious
Husband for their good. I believe the direful Martyrdom of but a Member of the
Lambs beloved Wife before described, is sowrer Sauce then 1000. dry Blows (or
if a little bloody) bestowed on some of our coy, cross, domineering Dames. In
short, if they cannot or will not carry, in some degree, conformable to the
Prescript and Pattern of that 1 P. 3.1, etc.
weaker Vessel set them down as molded and framed by the holy Ghost; they
must permit their Husband, in some proportion, to exercise that Knowledge and
coactive Power which God has imparted to him, while not contradicted, but
commended by his revealed Word: That, after they have suffered a while for
their 1 P. 2.20.
Faults or Pr. 26.5.

just Sufferers, have all Rev. 7.17. and 21.4.
Tears wiped away from their Eyes.

We know Christ's little See page 37. i. ult
Flock, consists of good Men and good Women, with their 1 Co. 7.14.
holy Issue; which are evidently See page 37. m.
far fewer then the wicked Ones of the World (the comparing of Men with Women,
I refer to the Alt. Eccl. 7.28.
Kingly Preacher) and therefore (in proportion) as of Men, so of Women, we must
look for the lesser Number of good then bad. From many of these (better and
worse) am I liable to like Censure which some far worthier then my self
incurred before me ('it is doubtful I shall not live to make my Peace, or
recover my repute upon their Terms if they be not wronged in the report, which
I willingly suspect) but from which side to expect the severer, I stand in
doubt. The Worser I weigh not; they must either been agere, or male audire; I
am neither to follow their Documents, affect their Approofs, nor fear their
Detractions. The Better, I would either satisfy, or (on fairer grounds) submit
unto. There are (I know) many good Men uxorious (some deservedly, I doubt not)
whose Affection may be apt (as is already touched) to transcend their
Judgment, and (justly endearing their Wives as themselves) make them tender of
hearing ought against Women in general, lest it seem to touch at Theirs. But
let no virtuous, discreet or modest Here I first name the Woman, because she
will be first apt to take offense.
Woman; no pious or prudent Man, be troubled or take distaste hereat: Here Is
nothing taxes or tasketh them, further then to incite their Christian
Admonition and reproof of Others, where they find Mat. 5.9. To. 14 19. Ja. 3.18.
Cause and 1 Mat. 7.6. Pr. 9.7,8. and 23.9.
Place for it.

As for the gracious and godly Women, who do conscienciously submit to their
Husbands indifferent Commands, as duty binds (yea, 1 P. 3.1
though their Husband obey not the Word, but be wicked) who being harmless, I
say, have yet churlish or cruel Husbands; 1 P. 4.19.
let them commit their souls to God in well doing as unto a faithful Creator;
their Amends lying mostly or mainly in his hand, who will either Ex. 2.2 7. Ps.
9.9. and 103.6. and 106 7.
right them here, or richly and unspeakably To. 8.18. 2 Co. 4.17. Rev. 7.14,
etc.
reward them hereafter. I believe there are in the World many wronged-good
Women, that would fain be remedied of their downright outrageous Husbands, and
want not temporall-civill Means and Opportunity for it, yet are patient and
silent: For, who so skittish as they that are least hurt? Who so bold as Byard?

But to the other, I may say as in the Case of Servants (very near akin to
theirs) 1 P. 2.20.
If when ye be buffeted for your Faults, you not only, not take it patiently
(which though you did, you gained neither L. 17.9,10.
glory nor thanks) but most impudently kick and rebel, yea without pressure or
provocation; ye do but incur the Ja. 3.1.
greater, even a double, or perchance deeper, Condemnation. For (as the Apostle
there insinuates) some Body must be Master; not all, nor many; (for so the
World might soon be turned topsy-turvy) and Brethren [he saith] not sisters;
Women were not then so much as suspected to come in Competition for Mastery.
Remember, or know, that as 1 Co. 14.33.
God is Author of Peace, so not of Genesis 11.9.
Confusion. We never read of Parity or Equality, that was or shall be
consistent or permanent in any Relation or Body animate but in the
sacred-mysterious Trinity of God. And, truly, I believe, that some good Women
among us, who are (upon the Matter) Commanders in Chief. would blush to confess
it, or be so accounted. See [by the way] the shifty and slinking Nature of sin:
The Genesis 3.12,13
Woman that thou gave to be with me she gave me, etc. (said Adam, and so may
his grand-sons often say) The Serpent (says Eve) beguiled Me. Nothing holds
Water nor wards the least Blow or Assault, but Truth and Integrity; these only
are impregnable, impenetrable. These Women (the last I mean) do grant a Thing
called Subjection; but they neither know, nor care to learn the Meaning, much
less the Practice of it: they are pleased not to dispute it; but they abhor to
discharge it. Thus beats the Pulse (I suspect) in many a formal Family: But
from the beginning it was not so.

Lastly, here is not the least Animation intended to any Libertine of either
Sex. Therefore, let no profane, drunken, disordered Fellow dare to beat his
Wife, (though Turpe est dectori, etc. Hands off. Mat. 7.4,5.
never so bad.) Who proposes no better End therein then to express his Power,
because (forsooth) he will not be crossed, though in a very Toy; commanding her,
ofttimes, mere Trifles to try Obedience. Let not these dream but they, also,
have a Ephesians. 6.9.
Master (for they do justly forget the Notion, and Relation of Husband) a
Master I say, in Heaven, whose Eye is never off them; who will one day exact a
strict and severe Account of their doing.

Neither let those Women think to catch any Protection, Countenance or Comfort,
from the Word or hand of God, who know none other use of their Husbands, then
to be Coverts of, or Caters for their Lust, Pride and Luxury.

I come now, by Gods blessed Conduct, to the Period of my crabbed and tedious
Parenthesis; wherein you have a Spark, or Glimpse of that native Intellect,
conferred by our common Maker the Fountain of Wisdom, on Me the meanest or
worst of his Creatures, which he more abundantly and splendidly sheds forth in
Others. What spiritual Improvement he has also given it here, you have seen.
As for humane Acquisitions or Accessions of Learning, etc. Aeque' doctus ac
vestitus; neutiqua^ mediocriter.
I may grate fully affirm as of other like. He has ever suppeditated (perhaps
not what I wished, but) what I needed, which if they seem too low and short for
so high a Design as This, I cannot help it, you have already the best Reasons I
am able to give of mine Enterprise; which I conceive included in These, That 1
Co. 7.7.
every Man has his proper Gift of God, one after this Manner, and another
after that: 1 Co. 12.4,6,11
And there are diversities of Gifts but the same Spirit; diversities of
Operations, but it is the same God which works all in all: and All these
works that One and the self same Spirit, dividing to every Man severally as
be will. I crave only this simple Courtesy at the houds of All (especially
such as pretend to know me by these Expressions) That, if my poor-single Talent
be not worth communicating, I may quietly enjoy it my self; or so improve it,
Mat. 25.14, etc. L. 19.13, etc.
as I may be honestly accountable to my Master.

And now do I most willingly wind out of this, once, unknown-unfeared Labyrinth
(wherein, it has fared with Me, as with him, That, having begun a Building,
can neither with Ease of Purse proceed, nor with Credit, or Quiet of Mind,
desist) to be at my Plough again, which, all this while stands idle. But Acts

himself justly arrogates; as he insinuated by that short Reply of his to
Peter's too curious-impertinent Demand: Jo. 21.21.22.

Me, Qua dij vocant eundum.) And, truly, he has manifestly controlled and
convinced even Me of it (as in sundry other, so) in this very Particular.
However; He 2 S. 7.20. Isa. 38 3. 2 Co. 11.11,31 1 Jo. 3.20.

Pilgrimage with my weak Body may not extend; or, if my God think it not fit I
should perform or perfect, What I have purposed or proposed; I trust I shall be
1 K. 8.18,19. 2 Co. 8.12.
disblamed: He will cause it better done after and without Me; all Ages,

FINIS.
POSTSCRIPT.
SInce the Epistle may not prevent, let this Postscript appease a carnal (it
can be no better) Censure, viz. The Margin is so needlessly overloaden with
Proofs, that it will be generally neglected. So. But we make no Bones at the
swelling and boisterous Notes even of some professing Divines, merely
displaying their own Learning and Readings of (sometimes humane or profane)
Authors, or citing of Scripture (happily) to small Purpose. And are our Stomachs
so queasy, as to nauseate and strain at the mild and Sincere Milk of the Word,
properly, seasonably and plentifully applied? Too many, indeed, are deadly sick
of this Surfeit: And it is granted, that these (as to their own sense and
Appetite) may here meet with Superfluity; but it is hoped (if justly pondered)
none or little Impertinency.

It Is almost impossible for any Composure of this Kind, to escape exactly
faultless; especially from so limited a Deliberation as here befell both the
Author and Printer. Be the Author's (for this time) charitably connived at; the
Printer's may be rectified thus.
