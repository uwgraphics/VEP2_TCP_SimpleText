REASONS Humbly Offered to the High Court of Parliament, For Suspending that
Part of the Act of Navigation (during the War with France) which obliges the
Master, and three Fourths of the Mariners (of his Ship) to be English.
I. BY alowing all English Ships (during the War) to be Manned with Foreigners,
(who shall not be liable to be pressed) the King will have those of his own
Subjects now employed in Merchants Ships, wholly in his own Service; by which
his Navy will be supplied in time, without the necessity of staying for the Men
that are Abroad, as heretofore, to the great Danger of the Nation.

II. The Ships which now lie by the Walls for want of Men, will then be
Employed, and Trade with a little assistance of Convoys, have its free Course
again, to the great encouragement of the Subject, and inabling them to a
cheerful Payment of their Taxes.

III. By the Trade of the Nation, the King's Customs will be greatly increased,
and by consequence the Burden on the Lands lessened.

IV. The necessity which Merchants are now under, of employing Foreign Shpis,
so much to the Prejudice of the Nation, and Advantage of Strangers, will then
cease; for these Foreign Ships will not now serve in any considerable Voyage,
for less (suppose) than a Thousand Pound, which Thousand Pound, except about
one Hundred Pound, is all carried out of the Land; whereas if our own Ships
(which now lie by the Walls for want of Men) were Employed, this Money would
all remain in the Country, except some small matter which the Seamen save out
of their Wages, and it is much if it amount to Thirty or Forty Pound: Which
considered, whether will it not be more to the Advantage of the Nation, to
Employ English Ships Manned with Foreign Seamen, then Foreign Ships, who
taking the advantage of our want of Men, demand, and at this time actually have
more than double the Freight which our own Ships would serve us for, if they
might but be so Manned.
