ELECTRA OF SOPHOCLES: PRESENTED TO HER HIGHNESS THE LADY ELIZABETH; With an
EPILOGUE, Showing the Parallel in two Poems, THE RETVRN, and THE RESTAVRATION.

By C. W.

At the Hague, for Sam. Brown, MDCXLIX.

TO THE MOST HIGH AND MOST VIRTUOUS PRINCESS THE LADY ELIZABETH.
Madam,
THese rude and uncompos'd Airs aspire into your presence, that from your Touch
they may receive Time and Laws. If you shall graciously vouchsafe to read them,
they will Live and Breath. It pleased our Renowned Lady, Queen Elizabeth, to
prefer the learned Author to the choice honor of her Favorite, and to
confer with him in his Natural language. Neither does that Most Illustrious
Name, rest on your Highness without a design of Providence, since it speaks
in you her Piety, and Early Bonds, and whatsoever She wore of greater Value
then her Crown. May it please you herein to countenance the Parallel. Only
accept the Endeavors of the unworthy Translatour, and give them Admission to
your Virtuous Hand, not valuing the Present, but receiving the Homage: For the
Authority of your Judgment is so pregnant, of so Royal and Early Growth, and
so hereditary, that Verses licensed by your Approbation, like sealed Measures,
are justified against Inferior censures by their mark.

Plays are the Mirrours wherein Men's actions are reflected to their own view.
Which, perhaps, is the true cause, that some, privy to the Ugliness of their
own guilt, have issued out Warrants, for the breaking all those
Looking-glasses; lest their deformities recoyl, and become an eyesore unto
themselves. This dim Crystal (fully'd with Antiquity, and a long voyage)
will return upon your Highness some Lines and Shadows of that Piety to your
deceased Father, which seats you above the Age, and beyond your Years: Which
makes you better then your Country, and higher then your Enemies: Which lodges
you in our Eye as our Example, and in our Heart as our Treasure.

Be secure (most illustrious Princess) you are not so much guarded from
flattery, by the Acts and Vigilance of the States, as by the Transcendencie of
your own Merits. The History of your Name shall be an Academie, whence
obsequious Rhetoric shall draw forth Encomiums to bleach the defects of
unaccomplisht Queens.

MADAM, Your Virtues command: Let Your Clemency favor the duty of my
ambition, Which is, to be

The most humble Honourer of Your Highness, C. W.

TO THE MOST EXCELLENT PRINCESS THE LADY ELIZABETH, On my Friends Dedication
of ELECTRA.
GREAT MADAM,
All the Muses humbly bow,
And kneel (not to the Ordinance) but You:
And mine stoops low, as Persians to the sky,
Low as their arrogance is bold and high
Who have enacted, that the Hat and Knee
The Hinge of Honor be forgot to thee.
Now though You are deposed in those poor parts,
You're still the same Great Princess in our hearts.
Souls make your Train and Court, which is no less
Now, than when all Your Palace was a press.
State, Pomp, obsequious throngs, and such gay things
Are Complements, and make but tapstry Kings.
Spare Scepters, Crowns, nay blood, still there remains
The Princess, not so by the Fathers Veyns
Alone, but Virtues, which are such they will Woo
You Realms and Subjects where so er'e you go.
You own a Word, a Look, a Touch will smooth,
Unfiled Indians to Obedient Love.
See Foreign Princes Crowd, and press to lay
Their Kingdoms by thy side, and next age may,
See the score of thy Royal Parents wrongs,
Revenged by Kings which now sleep in thy Loins.
You and the Duke are all our Hold and Fort,
Henry presents the Camp, and You the Court.
The Royal Widow with her beauteous Sky
Of Lady's, are Seen in Your Cheek and Eye:
And in Great Glo'sters little self Alone,
The Father breaths, and Brother is at Home.
Then leave us not, Dear pair, least that we throw
Our selves down where dead plumbets use to go.
It is your innocence does Counter-mand
Destruction, and bids Fire and Brimstone, Stand;
And when the rolling Mountains would come On,
You like those little Seeds bid them, Be gone.
On the Account too that it is your ray,
Madam, alone, keeps green up in the Bay;
The Poet here presents Electra's eye
A Crystal for to dress your Cypress by,
To set your Veyl, and sighs, and what you wear
Instead of Pearl, each Oriental tear.
And while you sit in those shades of your dress,
And Gloom of your attire, a Tragic verse:
Moving with pensive gate, and reverend feet,
May to your eye a smooth admittance Meet:
If that it pass the Guard, and die not there,
For Foreign Spy, or CHARLES'es Messenger.
H. P.
To my learned Friend on his apt choice and seasonable translation of ELECTRA
in SOPHOCLES.
THe Calender that is stamped for forty nine
Surts not the Year more, then thy Book the time:
Which comes forth in such day, that it before
Had been clean Verse, and English, but no more.
Now it is Design, and Plot, and may be said
Nor to bring only foreign Wit, but Aid:
It speaks our Land, as well as Tongue, and cares
Not only for our Words, but our Affayrs.
You make him to invade the State, and seek,
Not to translate, but to transport the Greek;
As if you had Commission to lie
Agent in foreign tongues, and Poesy:
And when the King wants troops of valiant Verse,
To beat your drums up through the Languages.
And it is Counsel now to fight the times,
Not in pitched Prose, but Verse, and flying rymes.
It Is safe too: For the Poet (as Men say)
Can forfeit nothing but some woods of Bay.
An old Lute, broken harp, torn wreath, or all
Such Goods and Chattels mere Poetical.
Here I might praise the Wisdom of thy Wit,
Who gain'st the Croop of danger too in it:
For it is but Sophocles repeated, and
Echo cannot be guilty or arraigned.
Thus by slight of translation you make
Him libell'em, who is ten ages back
Out of their reach: and lay your ambush so,
They see not who it is hurts them. He or You.
Yet each page of your book affrights 'em more,
Then the loud Citie-prentices at door.
They tremble at their own red actions past,
(For it is their Chronicle, but writ in have.)
And then to see the Punishment they shake,
Reading their Shambles, and themselves in stakes.
When Egist groans, they start, as if the steel
Reached at their souls, and when He falls, They reel.
Thus it sows spears and Agues in some breasts,
But fills us with the joy of Wine and Feasts,
And Hopes to see it dubbed by Victory,
And bid, Rise up a perfect Prophecy.
To his learned Friend on his ingenious choice and translation of Sophocle's
Electra, Representing Allegorically these Times.
WHat? 's aged Sophocles still infant? how
Comes it to pass he learns to speak but now?
His lines before were but half truth; his style
Against this age thy wit does whet and file.
Me thinks this were a perfect Prophecy,
But that there wants still the Catastrophe:
Here guilt with guilt is paralleled; the rhyme
Of vengeance too may be complete in time.
Our Agamemnon's dead, Electra grieves,
The only hope is that Orestes lives.
Others can only books translate; but thou
Translat'st the Poem, and the Poet too,
And make him Prophet; as with double face,
He see's behind him by thy looking-glass.
Poets themselves were never transformed; but here
In one twy-forkt Parnassus does appear.
These times were typifi'd by those; and he
I Will boldly add, was but a type of thee.
W. G.
To my most intimate C. F. C. W. On his ELECTRA, Translated out of the Greek,
and laid at the feet of her Highness the Lady ELIZABETH.
BOld Friend,
Thou have spoke words, and thou must look
To be indicted for thy per'lous Book;
Twelve honest men of Mycens shall debate
About the Symptoms of thy foolish Fate.
How will thou look when thou shall be attaqu'd.
For having broke Lord Egists new made Act?
O for a Limber then with grace to hint
Thy wan complexion and thy face in print!
Is it a cheap offense to have displayed
The Mystery of the Thanksgiving-trade,
That you Humiliations too must mock,
It Is dear Co-partner, that drives on one stock?
Thou sweet Electra have with sighs relieved;
Thou have with her in all her sorrows grieved.
And when 'twas Ordered that she be arrayed
In the cast gown of some stale Chambermaid;
Thou from remotest Isles Attire have brought
Of purest gold, with curious fancy wrought,
Unfolded from the Wardrobe of thy Wit.
Rich as the Vests aboard her Fathers fleet,
When Asian Robes, and costly Phrygian Vayls,
Over the Victour spread their silken sails
Nor were they Webs of an inseriour Grain
By rude and Needy Vulgar knit for Gain:
There fifty Princesses in stately grace,
With equal Princes matched, great Priams race,
On Ivory Couches in soft Cushions placed,
(The lofty Gallery's with gold enchac'd)
Their Needles ply: each Madams nimble clue
The younger Dames and honored Maids pursue,
When Egist too had her confinement charged
By thee thus richly clad she is enlarged,
And by a Princess placed, whose each aspect
Will an enriched Ray of grief reflect:
See how they kindle tears, how by consent
They now themselves, each other now lament.
Mark their thick Tears, and fair dejected Head,
As heavy Lilly's honey-riv'lets shed.
Then they look up, and if but thin drops shoot,
At the others Eye their watery Host recruit.
The streams fall in and mix. Pale sorrow rides
In silent depths, and unimpeached tides.
Now Tears they vie, and in the place contend,
Each is a Duellist, and not a Friend:
Till on the precious pavement this rich vein
Is lost in that, and so they close again:
Now in full force they march, join hand in hand,
And Grief no Champion is, but a full Band.
But I must add one word, before we end,
To expiate my having been thy friend.
Had I thee known a Greek, or that way given,
From this foul fault long since I had been driven.
I Would fled at distance, and a far off feared
Thy pastbord stomacher and goodly Beard.
But these are all invisible in thee,
Invisible as is the Greek to me.
But since thou tell me it, Hold, take these Alms,
This Verse that will scarce go, these withered Palms.
E. F.
The Persons of the Interlude.
The Tutour and Foster. Orestes, the Prince. Electra, the Princess Royal. The
Quirre of Maids of Honor dwelling near the Palace. Chrysotheame, the Sister
of Electra. Clytemnestra, the unnatural Spouse of Agamemnon, who conspired
against him. Egist, the Paramour of Clytemnestra, and Conspiratour against the
King.
The Signification of the References.
THe Alphabeticall letter relates to the managing of the Scene, it shows the
Postures and Motions, with the Carriage of the Action.

The Smaller Figures referres to the Interpretation of some difficult places,
and vindicating them from Obscurity or Mistake.

The Larger Figures in the Head of some files of Verses, is that which contains
the most Novelty. We must know, that the Ancient Quire of the Greek Tragedians
in the time of Sophocles, consisted of Fifteen, seated by fives upon three
Forms, or by threes upon five Forms. And in that Number were their Approaches
and Returns, one speaking for the rest, being the fore party of the Quire.
Music still attended their Speeches and Dancing. Now these Stanzas pricked out
by Numbers, are most exactly answered by an ensuing Stanza, either immediately
ensuing, or so interwoven, that the third answers the first, and the fourth the
second. Every such Stanza having 'its Counterpart, and every Member though of
different Meeter, being exactly commensurate with the Member following in the
same Number of the Counterpart. It is suspicious that of these Songs, the
former referred to a Leading up of the Dance in set Paces, and the Latter to a
Returning in equal Steps. Only this kind of Dancing seems to have fallen even
in the Roman Tragedy's, though I hardly know any thing to have been more
magnificent in the very flower and height of their Empire, then their Sumptuous
Theaters and Amphitheaters. This long disuse has transmitted us a very obscure
notion of those rarityes in Music wherein the Ancient Greeks seem to have
excelled. So that it may be excusable, if I am not clear enough in delivering
that, of which the injury of Time has scarce left a shadow.

A short extract of the History about the destruction of TROY.
BEcause this confident Essay has adventured to go out, under the silken
Banner of Her Highness, and being a piece which proceeded from an Author, in
the Original, whose character it is still to have done right to virtuous
Lady's; It may possibly be engaged (though Naturally Modest) in the Attendance
of some of that sex. Now it were indiscretion to think their fair hands can
afford to be soyl'd with the dustie records of Time, or impertinent History,
further then the Arras can instruct, or then may be understood by one who is
well-vers'd in the Wardrobe. Therefore I shall take it for a needful part of
my duty here, to describe briefly the Heads of this Story, so familiarly
intimated in the Poem.

The voyage to Troy happened in the MCXCIIII year, before the Incarnation of
our Savior, about the time that Jair judged Israel. Upon this Quarrel. Paris
the son of Priam (King of Troy) sailed over to Peloponnesus, where Menelaus
reigned; having for his Queen Helen the great beauty of her age. Paris lodged
in the Court of Menelaus, in whose absence he carries away Helen (against the
Laws of her Wedlock, and his Hospitality) over to Troy with him. Menelaus
returning, demands her, and is repulsed. Whereupon he invites his Brother
Agamemnon, then King of Argos, to assist him in the recovery of her by arm's.
So both the Kings with the other neighbor Princes, levying the whole strength
of Greece, fell down toward Aulis an Island in Boeotia; where they entered into
confederacy, not to return till either Troy were rased, or they perished in
the enterprise. But when they should have put out, the Navy lay becalmed, till
according to the answer of the Oracle which they consulted, Agamemnon had
sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia. About xxvii years after this Jephthe
sacrificed his daughter: so that some think this of Iphigenia a fiction, and
that uncertain tradition huddled up both times together, and that the Ladies
right name was Iphtigenia. This war lasted ten years, till the prime and
ablest Commanders being cut off on both sides, the Victory fell to the Greeks,
whose cause was the juster; Troy being taken by the treachery of Aeneas and
Antenor, and sacked, and burnt. Yet it fared little better with the Conquerours
in their return, then it had with the conquered, most of them being
weatherbeaten, and cast away. As for Agamemnon, he was slain in his own house
by wicked Egist, through the complotment of Clytemnestra: which unnatural
treason, Orestes with the assistance of Electra revenged: Heaven, as it were,
rewarding this affection of Orestes, by length of days, and happiness of
Government; for he lived ninety years, and reigned seventy, matched with
Hermione.

The Tyrannical usurpation of the Mycenian Kingdom, with the Affliction and
Oppression of the Royal Children, and the Destruction of the Conspiratours,
the Enthroning of Orestes, with the Deliverance of the Royal Family, make up
this work.

It was written by Sophocles, who was born in the CCCCXCV year before the
Incarnation of our Savior, and lived XC years.

So that this Action was performed little less then MMM years ago; and
represented in this Tragedy somewhat more then MM.

This Abridgement of that famous History, is extracted (for the generality) out
of Petavius, a most exact Chronologer, though with some change and addition.

The rest will be supplied by the Notes.

The Historical and Moral Plot of the Tragedy.
Exiled Orestes is returned, though late,
His Royal Fathers blood to expiate:
That Blood from which War and the bold sword shrunk
Yet was by Treason, and the cold Ax drunk.
Safe is he entered, but yet unrevea'ld,
By Night and darker policy concealed.
Electra here a Generous Defyer,
In vain to comfort wooed by the kind Quire,
Chides Chrysotheame a white-liver'd Complyer:
Who was with Offering by her Mother sent
To bribe the dead, and Seape the punishment.
She intercepts the gifts, the Oils she spills,
And with a smoking Curse her Censer fills.
The Cannon's turn, and this revolting prayer,
Went forth a Treasure, but returns a snare.
But Clytemnestra pleads the fact was Just,
The Bill was Murder, where the Judge was Lust.
Yet though the out-faced Noon she down may beat,
The Dark brings Vision, and the Silence threat,
Lashed by pale dreams, the Hobs of night, she runs
To flattering Humiliations.
Thinking those angry Beadles to disarm,
With strumpet Incense and Religious charm.
But hypocritical Devotions dress,
A Pageant safety, and a Mock of peace:
For scarce her prayers are cooled and downward bending
When their return is at the door attending.
A Post in neat Romance Orestes slayes,
Secures the field, and so the field betrays.
Now sad Electra at the dismal news
Dissolves, and scatters into pious Dews.
The Quire Companions of her grief she slights,
Nor in her Sisters joyful words delights.
Who sees large offerings at the Sepulcher,
And thence her Brothers hand does right infer.
Built on much reason: but we less set by
Weak-grounded truth, then a bold hearsay ly^
Hence raging grief into hard valor knits,
(For both are elevate beyond our wits)
Her Sister she invites to mutual Aid,
With hands combined the Traitor to invade,
And is repulsed, yet she resolves alone
To execute her resolution.
Those who Compound led captive by tame Ease,
Seldom on dangerous Honor dare to Seize.
Poor loyalty, how low now art thou laid
By Enemies destroyed, by friends betrayed!
What valiant wisdom will appear at once,
To break thy foes, and heal thy Factions?
Orestes is at door; his Urn he shows,
Meets with Electra and confirms her woes.
The dear Imposture she must see and hold,
And to her Brother all her cares unfold.
In doleful accents her sweet passions sound,
Which in a precious deluge straight are drowned.
The happy witness of those pious throws.
Cannot forbear his person to disclose.
Their Joys swell high, but at a quick surprise,
First Clytemnestra, and then Egist dy's.
Thus Loyal sorrow in high triumph ends,
While rebel Joy Eternal Black attends.
ELECTRA OF SOPHOCLES.
The Tutour. The Tutour and Orestes are brought in upon the way to Argos, newly
coming in by break of day; and the old man tells him all the places as he comes
by, and where he is: For it is presumed, that he being about ten years old at
his departure had not before the wisdom to take notice of them. The entrance
is pert and lively, being quickened by frequent pointing at sights, and
alteration of posture: it is also stately, opening into various Scenes, and
being beautified with a prospect upon objects, full both of delight and
magnificence. Besides that delicate passion which is insinuated into us, to see
an Exile entering his Country, which he was forced to leave very young; and to
hear those places repeated as he passes along, whose bare names cannot but
raise in him a Natural endearment. SOn of great Agamemnon, he who late
Led the Greek host against the Trojan State;
Now may thine eyes their wished objects read:
This is old Argos you still longed to tread.
Yon grove is Io the daughter of Inachus, ravished by Jupiter, was upon the
surprisall of jealous Juno, for secrecy, transformd into a cow: Juno
suspecting this, creates the Ox-flie, and sets it upon her; with whose sting
she was so vehemently infested, that she run mad: but was afterward by
Jupiter preserred to a goddess, and worshipped with consecrated groves by the

calamitous seat of the Argive Kings: which were Pelops matchdwith Hippodamia,

with Aeropes He had a brother Thyestes: this brother incestuously consotted
with Aerope, which made Atreus, to assert his nuptial honor, enter on this
high-flown revenge: he invites him to a feast, wherein he caters his own
incestuous brood for his entertainment. Thyestes after the supper understanding
of this, consulted the Oracle, how he might recompense the cruelty, and
according to the answer, devirginates his own daughter Pelopera, by which
incest was begot Egist. After Atreus, Agamemnon reigned, that matched with
Clytemnestra: he after the ten years siege of Troy returning in conquest, was
slain by Egist, who in his absence had wonn great authority in the kingdom.
This he compassed by scaling the bed of Clytemnestra, who was left Regent of
Mycens in the time of the voyage.
infamous Pelopeian house,
Whence I thee, as thy Father fresh was slain,
From thy dear sisters sweet embraces taken
Rescued and saved, and to this bigness bred
Avenger of thy Royal Fathers head.
Now then, Orestes, and thou dearest friend
Pylade, dispatch we that that we intend.
For birds with chirping Mattins call from bed
The woken Suns already rising head,
And sable night of all her stars is rid:
Wherefore e're any out of doors shall stir,
Confer your thoughts. No time now to demur,
But forward action ripened is to height.

Orest. Dearest of my attendants, now I see it
How kind thou art to us it plain appears,
For as some mettel'd steed, though struck in years,
In hottest service naught of heart lets go,
But stands with ear erect; you even so
Both spur us on, and march your self i'ch front:
I^'e tell you my resolve, attend you on it:
And if ought unadvised escape, amend.
When I the Pythian curtain did attend
Consulting how my Fathers murder, I
On the executioners might satisfy,
Phoebus this answer gave, mark the reply:
Without or buckler or an armies guard
By stealth procure the murders just reward,
Since then the holy voice directs us thus,
As first occasion serv's, get in this house,
And mark what e're is done, and when you know,
Make us acquainted how all actions go:
For they will never spy nor once suspect your show,
With age disguised, long absence, and this hiew:
And make your tale this wise; A Forreiner
Of Phoce, sent by noble Phanot there,
(For he and they in nearest league combine)
You come to tell (thereto a deep oath join)
How that Orestes came t'untimely end
As in the Pythian matches they contend,
Struck from the hurrying eoach: This story pass.
Mean while my Fathers tomb in the first place
(As was appointed then) with locks new shorn,
And hallowed liquours we forth with adorn:
Then we return, and carrying in our hands
The pot which midst the thicket you know stands
To hide the tale, the sweet news you have se'd
We Will bring them word of, how that I am dead;
My body in the funeral pile calcined,
To the few ashes in this urn confined:
For what great harm if but reported slain,
In truth I live, and great renown obtain.
I Am of the mind no words that gain are naught:
Thus have I often seen The Poet seems to have had an eye upon Lycurgus and
Pythagoras, yet avoids that mistake of anticipation of history, while he only
names an action which might have been common to former ages, and conceals those
actors which were long after the time of Orestes.
Sages carried out
I the empty coffin of a false report,
Yet safe come home and double honored for 't;
So trust I from this fame alive to rise,
Like a bright star upon my enemies.
O Country soil and Greeces guardian powers,
Send me a blessed journey to these Towers;
And you my Fathers Hall, for you I come
To expiate you, led by heavenly doom:
Nor send me with disgrace out of these ports,
But Lord of wealth, but Founder of great Courts.
Well, I have done: but you, grave Sir, beware
To what our Counsel charged upon your care:
And we away, It Is time, for alway's this
Grand Over-seer of all actions is.

El. Ay me, unhappy me!


Tut. Methinks within door, child, I seemd to hear
One of the maidens keep a groaning there.

Or. It Is poor Electra, is 't not, prithee fain
I Would stay a while, and hear the plaint again.

Tut, By no means, naught before Phoebus advice
Assay to do: Thence take our Action rise.
Go, pour your offerings on your Fathers tomb,
For Triumph hence, and might for Service come: Orestes and Pylades (a mute
companion of Orestes) go away from before the gate, to the tomb of Agamemnon,
and the Tutour goes away, but parts from them.

El. Electra newly up, and wayling walks out to the gate. Sacred light,
earth-bounding air,
Nurses privy to my care,
You my Dirges witness best,
You how I ply my bruised breast,
When the gloomy Shade, is ceast;
But my Night groans ring aloof,
In the sad Courts wicked roof,
While I my poor Father mean,
Whom in Barbarous Region
Bloody Mars had let alone,
Here may not unproperly be urged the old caution, that similitudes run not
upon all four: Yet may this be a fit pourtraiture of an accumulative or
aggregative Lady, the queen politic, which has trull'd it in the lewd
embraces of the soldiery, and to consummare the scandal, shall have conspired
with it, and together hainously upon agreement, destroys her just and undoubted
Lord.
But my Mother and her Mate
Egist, as strong Swains lie at
A sturdy Oak to fell down flat,
His head with bloody Pol-ax cleave:
Nor any but I at this grieve
That thou, Father, thus should come
To a sad unworthy doom.
But moan I will and cry,
While I the glittering stars espy,
While I the day discover
My plaint I Will nere give over,
But as a robbed Nightingall
Will my sorrows tune, and all
Shall hear my moan before this gate;
O Pluto's and Proserpines state!
O Mercury and curse that sure is!
O stern god-begotten Fury's!
You Crowners of the murdered, hear
You Watchers of the Adulterer!
Come ye, help ye, venge ye all
Our Fathers fall:
And my brother home me call.
My self no longer can weigh down
My overbearing moan.

El. 1 O Day, Curse of my Calendar!
2 O night! O Suppers horrid Cheer!
3 Cracking my loaded Heart.
4 When unworthy Fate did part
5 By base Conspirators my Father
6 Who took, who stroy'd my life together.
7 With whom the great God ruling heaven
8 In vengeance over weight be even.
9 Nor may they e're enjoy their state,
10 Purchased at Treasons rate.

Qui. 1 Hush, pray not too loud, for know you
2 What harm storming thus may do you?
3 Endangering your present fortune,
4 Your own destruction you importune;
5 And much of needless ill will gain
6 While still you stubbornely complain,
7 To raise strife: forbear; It Is Art,
8 Oppose not the prevayling part,
9 But yoke your heart.

El. 1 I am provoked: I see it, and
2 My impatience understand;
3 But at this fact to grieve
4 I Will not cease, till cease to live.
5 For who would speak well of me, should I?
6 Who that or Honor know's or duty?
7 Comforters leave, leave me alone
8 For this grief must no measure own.
9 Never will I from my labors cease,
10 But still my tears increase.

Qui. It Is mere good will all that I press,
Like to some tender Mother;
Breed not griefs one of another.

El. Tell me what bounds my woes confine,
Is It fit the Dead in scorn to enshrine?
What man does nature bring up so?
May I never in their favor grow.
Nor if I match, some worthy Lord
To live demure will I afford;
But my sad devotions pay
At my Fathers grave will lay.
For if the dead and rotten
Like earth and naught forgotten
Must lie along,
And they the wrong
Not rue, who did the same,
Farewell Virtue, Farewell shame,
And all the gods reputed name.

Qui. One of the Ladies coming after the rest. Brought, Madam, Both that I may
counsel you not to exasperate your enemies by the opposition of perpetual
complaints, and that I may approve my self a faithful friend in coming in to
your comfort both for yours and my own sake
Hither Im'e with all this ear betake:
And if I prove other then right to say
We straight submit our wills, yours be the day.

El. Lady's, I am ashamed in your esteem
That I though never so sad, too pensive seem.
But to this life I am perforce inclined:
Pardon, how can a Maid of generous mind,
Seeing her Fathers wrongs do otherwise
Then I, who moan abed, moan when I rise?
Nor waynes my grief, but still increases more.
For first it is my own mother who me bore
Hates me, then they who made away my Father
With me in mine own Palace, live together.
They are my Governors, and they me feed,
From whom then be supplied, I Would rather need.
Besides, what life I lead pray do you count,
When I see haughty Egist perching mount
My Fathers Throne, the self same robes behold
Him wear, my slaughtered Father wore of old.
And in those very rooms where he his Hands
Embrew'd, atone the household Guardians.
And that which gives my utmost woe full stature,
My Fathers sheets are made to hold the Traitor
With my lewd mother, if it be fit at all
That I his bedfellow should Mother call;
And she thus base lodged by the murderer,
Of haunting ghosts never stands one whit in fear,
But as she at the fact made merry, when
She finds the day is come about again,
In which by guile she made our Sire away,
Then she does mask it, then month offerings slay
To saviour-gods, on her thanksgiving day:
Mean while, poor I, 'bout house looking thereon
Cry, fret, and make a lamentable moan,
My Fathers dismal feast to think upon,
All by my self alone; nor can I still
Continual weeper, ever weep my fill.
Then the well-spoken gentlewoman for'c,
With such like curbing girds takes me up short;
Hate of the gods, to you, forsooth, alone
Your Father's dead, none else makes any moan;
An ill end seize on thee, and this doom pursue,
Hell after death thy lease of grief renew.
Thus taunts she. But when any message brings
How that Orestes comes: then out she flings
Like a rude Bedlam, and with rampant voice,
Cries, This your doings is, all this you cause
Which out of my arms reach Orestes get:
But know that thou shall dearly pay the shot.
Thus snaps she, and her fine companion
Standing close by her elbow, eggs her on:
That sneaks in grain, that piece made up of scorn,
That Champion to Lady-duells born.
But I Orestes still expecting, who
Should set me free, mean while decay with woe.
For while he stands contriving, he destroys
At once my present hopes, and future joys:
Nor can I whilst things stand this wise with me,
Lady's or patient or religious be:
For deep afflicting evils burden forces
The best that are to fall on evil courses.

Quir. Tel's one thing, Madam, is Egist abroad,
Or here, while you your passion thus unload?

El. Abroad you may be sure: were he in town,
I durst not peep: he is now to the country gone.

Quir. Nay, if 't be so I dare somewhat more free
Own your access, and talk more ventrously.

El. He is from home, your mind you need not smother.


Qu. Then I Will adventure: What news from your Brother?
Comes he, or stay's he? pray for certain tell's.

El. He promises to come, but nothing else.


Qu. Men on great enterprises move but slow.


El. I Am sure in saving him I did not so.


Qu. Fear not, he is one will never desert his friend


El. No: if I should my life were at an end.


Qu. Not a word more; I epsy Chrysotheame,
Your sister of one sire and mothers stem,
Come out of doors; with gifts in hands whose rites
Are proper to appease deceased sprights.

Chr. What a complaining, sister, at the gate
Do you make, after your accustomed rate?
Will you never be advised to refrain
From idle passion, but still give it rein?
Why now thus much I by mine own self know
I vex at heart things should be carried so:
And were but my good will with strength protected
They soon should know which way I stand affected:
But in a storm I safely strike my sails,
Nor seem to act, when action naught avayles.
Il'd have you too, Dear Sister, tread this way:
It Is true, that Justice is not what I say,
But what you do; yet if my Liberty
I Will have, I must with those in power comply.

El. Sad case that you his child whom you pretend
Slighting your Sire, should to your Mother bend.
For all those wholesome counsels you prefer
Are none of them your own, but taught by her;
Wherefore choose one o'th two; or mad be styled,
Or in your wits but an unnatural child.
For you that fitly say, were in place where
Your detestation of them you would declare.
Yet when I seek to right my Fathers shade
Help'st nothing, nay do me that would dissuade:
Does not this Cowardice to sorrow add?
Wherefore or teach me, or else from me learn,
Could I leave off my moan what should I earn?
I live now, poor you will say; Well, yet content:
And while I vex their hearts, at least this rent
(If ought the Dead can please) the dead present.
But you that hate them, hate them sore in word,
Yet to converse with them you can afford
That murde'rd your dear Sire: Il'd never abide it
Though hired with all the knacks in which you pride it;
To crouch to their commands. Enjoy you still
A table richly furnished, wealth your fill:
Give me but food which nature does require,
And to your Gallantry I Will never aspire.
Nor would you were you but your self, for when
You might be called, Daughter to the best of men,
Your Mothers be, so shall't be to you laid
You your dead Father and your Friends betrayed.

Qui. Nothing in anger for all loves: It Is right
Each of you says, and each may profit by it.
Would you endure but to be ruled by her,
And she but learn to be your follower.

Chry. I am Dear Lady's in a manner used
To these term's from her, and had now refused
To speak, but that a business I discover,
Will make her all her wayling soon give over.

El. Tells that great business, come; and if 't outvy
My grief, I Will forthwith with your will comply.

Chry. Well I Will acquaint you then with what I can:
They mean 'lesse you your puling leave, anon
To turn you thither where no courteous Sun
Bestow's a Visit on the Dungeon.
Where in griefs lonesome Pesthouse shut up close
Far from this Land you may tune out your woes.
Wherefore conform, for now it is time to do it,
And blame me not too late, if you shall rue it.

El. But are you sure against me this is their doom?


Chapter Most sure I am when Egist back shall come.


El. Now therefore would for me he would come away!


El. O wretch, what wicked thing is 't you did pray?


El, That he would come, if it be thus decreed.


Chapter To do you mischief? Are you mad indeed?


El. To rid me from among you all far hence.


Chapter What, of your present life have you no sense?


El. O mine a heavenly life, most wondrous sweet!


Chapter At least, it might be, if you 'ld be discreet


El. Teach me not my deceased friend to forget.


Chapter I teach you not, but to power to submit.


El. You flatter, with my Nature it never stood.


Chapter Yet to fall through rashness 't is not good.


El. We Will fall, if need, to avenge our Fathers blood.


Chapter Our Father, he I know with this dispenses.


El. Such words are slothful Cowards base pretenses.


Chapter You Will not be ruled then, nor with me agree?


El. No truly, never may I so senseless be.


Chapter I Am hasting thither where my errand lies.


El. Whither away? whose is this sacrifice?


Chapter My Fathers, whom my Mother sends this gift,


El. What him the odiousest that ever lived?


Chapter Him that she killed, your meaning's that I know.


El, What friend advised her? who would counsel so?


Chapter 'T was some night-apparition as I cast.


El. Now Fathers holy Angels help at last!


Chapter Have y' any ground of hopes raised from this fright?


El. I Will tell you if you will tell's what was the sight.


Chapter I know it not: only one little glance.


El. That little tell's, A word ofttimes may chance
To cast the high down, and the low advance.

Chapter There is a speech, that with a second greet,
Your and my Father was seen her to meet
Risen to light: his Royal Staff then rear's,
And plants, which late himself now Egist bear's,
From whose Crown shot forth such a verdant Bough,
All Mycens roosted in its shady Brow.
Thus much I heard one telling, who was there
When she did to the Sun her dream declare:
Farther then this I know not, but that she
Upon that fright this Message sends me.
Wherefore I by thy Fathers gods thee pray,
Be ruled by me, nor cast thy self away.
But thou 'rt still lost, if thou shall disobey.

El. Hold Sister: none of those things in your hands
Must touch the Tomb, Justice it self withstands,
And Piety; you should our Father carry
Cleansings and offerings from his Adversary.
Wherefore in the winds or some deep-mined cave
Hide 'em where they may never admission have,
Into the presence chamber of his grave.
But let 'em there be saved a goodly prize,
For her own precious self against she dies.
For were she not, the most ungodly she
E're breathed, these hostile offerings could not be
From her the Murderesse to him that fell:
Now judge your self, how can the entered take well
These honors at those hands by which he di'd

Which It was a superstitions humor of the Ancients, after they had committed
any murder, to cut the sinews about the armpits of the corse, fondly (as far
as I can reach) supposing that they did thereby enfeable the arms of the
injured spright, and disable it from pursuing them with its crooked tasons, or
returning any due satisfaction: yet the ordinary sewer of interpretations runs
into this sense, that they were wont to cut off the tipps of the body, as the
ears, and nose, and the like, and string them, and so wear them for an amulet
cast about their neck, and brought about to their armholes.

And The custom of offering locks of hair at the tomb of deceased friends, is
ancient and frequent: Foc a plain probable reason of it, (if any reason can be
given of the encroachmentts of superstition, or any eye so vigilant to observe

into Deities; so those actions which are the effects of these perturbations
might in process of time pass into forms of worship Tearing the hair is

son in Law should slay him, proposed, not to let any one wed her, unless he
overcome his fleet chariot-horses. Pelops arriving at Pisa, brib's Myrtill to
leave out the Axle-pin: So in the way the chariot overthrew, Oenomaus fell, and
committing the revenge of his treacherous man to his son, expired. Pelops
having won Hippodamia, in lieu of reward, casts the perfidious Myrtill into
the Myrtean (as the Greeks feign, deriving from him that name.
O Pelops! in ill weather
Thy Coach came hither;
Thou drov'st with an ill hand
To this same land:
For since Myrtill was laid asleep,
Thrown in the deep,
With cruel base reproach
Or'ethrown with his Coach
Embossed with beaten gold,
Woe within woe enrolled,
Has dogged close
This sad House.

Clyt. You now it seems are gadding forth again,
Now Egist is from home, who kept you in,
Lest you abroad your friends should load with lies.
But now he is out o'th way, you me despise.
And many folks you many tales have told,
How I, harsh and outrageous cruel, hold
You and yours under, doing you great wrong:
No wrong; I give bad words to a bad tongue.
Now for your Father (that is all you pretend
Always) how he by me came to his end.
By me? I know it well, and will it own,
But Justice took him off, not I alone;
To whom, if wise, your helping hand y' had lent:
For this your Father whom you still lament,
Only of all the Grecians must proffer
Your sister to the angry gods to offer,
Having in the begetting her not known
My pangs in a hard labor undergone.
Come on now, satisfy me for whose sake
Offered he her. The Greeks, you I answer make.
Now, what had they to do my child to kill?
Or to comply with Menelaus will?
Should he slay mine, and look I should sit still?
Hermione and Nicostratus children of Menclaus by Helena.
And had not the other two, more fitting far
Both of them, to be sacrificed then her?
Of father born and mother, for whose sake
They did the expedition undertake:
Or did Death long, and had an eager mind,
On mine to banquet, and leave hers behind?
Or did not your base father rather this,
Hate her by me, and Menelaus loved his?
Does not this Sire the fool and vile bewray?
I think he does, however you say, Nay.
And the dead, could she speak she would consent:
I therefore at what is done do not repent:
And if I seem to you to think amiss,
Do well to load your friends with calumny's.

El. You Will not say now that I first went about,
To move your heat, and drew this passion out:
But if you will give me leave, I Will tell you true
Of my dead Father, and my sister too.

Cly. I give you leave. This modest dialect
Still used, our ready audience might expect.

El. I tell you then. Your felf profess you spilt
My Fathers blood. A word of blackest guilt,
Were it by right or not, yet I Will assert
It was not Right, but Love did you pervert
To that lewd Paramour, with whom you are naught.
Now ask the Huntresse Dian, for whose fault
She in calm Aulis staid the wind-bound Fleet.
Or I Will reply: for her we cannot meet.
My Father once (as I have heard it talked)
Sporting in the holy Grove, roused as he walked
A spotted, well-brancht Stag, which having killed,
And boasting often by chance, some words he spild,
At which Latona's daughter took offense,
And stopped the Greeks, nor let them stir from thence,
Till he his Child gave her Beasts recompense.
Thus she was given, nor could the Army come,
On other terms back, or to Ilium:
So that unwilling, when he could no other,
He offered her, and not to please his brother.
But grant it were (as you auerre) to further
His brother, must he therefore merit murder
At your hands to be executed? By what order?
Take heed lest while you make a newfound Law
You on your felf woe and repentance draw:
For if blood must with blood assoyled be,
Vou must die first to seal your own decree.
But see if you coin not a vain excuse,
For if you please, resolve me why you choose
Your life in fowl debauchments to abuse,
Which with that Murderer lie, with whom together
Plotting before, you made away my Father,
And gendrest with him, but us out do throw,
The honest issue of a pious vow.
Can I commend you here? is it your pretense,
This too is for your child to make amends?
Fowl answer if it be. No law allows
You should to avenge a child, a foe espouse:
Nor may we our advice present, but still
Incensed you cry, our Mother we revile.
But I in your deportment to us find,
More of the Mistress harsh, then Mother kind:
Which lead sad days, and old acquaintance date
With woes by you occasioned, and your Mate.
But poor Orestes now in foreign lands,
That life with which he hardly escaped your hands,
Clo'yd with distress, consumes; who^ you complain
I for your executioner maintain.
Which, were I able, be assured I would:
And therefore give it out, if you think good,
That I Am ill natured, or unbridled scold,
Or to the depth of impudence am bold:
For if these virtuous qualities I show,
I do not much degenerate from you.

Qui. I see her moved but whether justly so
It Is not within my Judgments Verge to know.

Clyt. What Course now can I take with her that thus
Is not ashamed her Mother to abuse?
Electra was probably 28. or 30. years old as may be gather d from the offices
of rescuing and saving her Brother mentioned in her lamentation over the Urne
that follows.
And that at these years too? seems she not bent,
For all bold mischiefs a fit instrument?

El. Assure your self I feel an inward shame,
How e're you think: I am advised, and blame
My Carriage fit nor for the time, nor me.
But your cursed usage and your deeds they be
Malgre my self me to this pass have wrought
For by lewd company, lewd tricks are taught.

Clyt. O ye Bold Beast, do I or words of mine
Or my deeds you to talk at large incline?

El. It Is you talk so not I: you do the deed,
And Deeds by words are but interpreted.

Clyt. Now by our Lady Dian, you shall mourn
For your bold Tongue when Egist does return.

El. See you're enraged for all I had your leave
To speak my Mind, nor will attention give.

Clyt. I shall not offer then for you in Peace,
Since I consented to your tongues release.

El. You may, you shall; Offer, nor blame my Noise,
For hear I Will put a period to my Voice.

Clyt. You that attend take the fruit offerings thence,
That I to the King may make my Orizens,
To ease my soul, my soul of it is oppressing fear
Phoebus great President of Mycens hear.
Me softly pray, for enemy's stand by,
Nor may I speak all out while she is nigh.
Lest she with clamours loud and Mind perverse
An idle tale through all the town disperse,
Thus hear thou: thus my prayers conceald prevent:
The apparitions last night did present
In both my dreams, Lycean King, for these
If they be lucky, crown them with success
On me; if Hostile, on my Enemy's:
Nor if some ill-affected shall contrive
My ruin from this hight, do thou connive:
But in safe Channel glide my peaceful days
Holding the royal Halls and royal Mace.
And with the friends I have may I still rest,
Bathing in ease, with my dear pledges blessed.
(Bate those Malign my peace, and sweets infest)
Lycean Phoebus to these prayers lend
An open ear, and a propitious End;
And all things else, though not expressed by me,
Which unto you a god must naked be,
For fit it is Joves seed should all things see.

Tut. Who can enform one, Lady's, I entreat
If this be Royal Egists Princely seat.

Qui. This gentle stranger it is: Right is your aim.


Tut. At this his Consort aim I too as nigh?
Her presence personates a Majesty.

Qui. Resolve you this great Lady is the same.


Tut. Hail gracious Queen, sweet tidings I commend
From one to you and Egist a near Friend.

Clyt. Succeed the news, but first acquaint me this,
What Master sent you with these Embassy's.

Tut. Phanot the Phocese. High concernment it is.


Clyt. Friend speak it out, you come from a good King,
And a good Message without doubt you bring.

Tut. Orestes death in one word take it all.


El. Woe to me wretch, this day compleats my fall.


Clyt. What is it? what is it my Friend? her cry's never heed.


Tut. Orestes, then and now I say, is dead.


El. Lost and forlorn I am: I am no more.


Clyt. Get you about your business, but kind friend
Tell me the certain manner of his end.

Tut. I Will tell you all: my Journey was therefore.

But fleet he scoures the lazy road, and meets
The forward Goal. The Crown his conquest greets

Only take this: When ever race was waged,

Dragged on the ground, then tossing in the air
His hurried legs, till the kind chariotiers
With much ado stopping their mad carriers,
Loosen the bloody corpse, so torn as none
Their friends disfigured countenance could own.
Then forth with certain Phocians ordered, burn
His limbs; and in a little brazen urn,
Conduct the einders of that mighty Name,
That in his Country he may burial claim.
You have it all. Piteous it is to tell:
But had you bin, as we, at the Spectacle,
In my sight never so sad a thing befell.

Qu. Woe, woe, our ancient Masters forward hope
Wholly, it seems, is Root and Branch stockt up.

Clyt. O Jove! what is here! is 't Cursednesse or Bliss?
It Is gain, I grant; yet grievous joy it is,
If mine own sorrows must my life protect.

Tut. Why Lady, does this Message you deject?


Clyt. Childbirth is sharp, and though he prove ungrate,
A Mother yet cannot her own pangs hate.

Tut. We on an idle errand come, I see.


Clyt. Not idle neither, how cannot idle be,
That you of his decease sure signs have brought,
Who when he was of mine own soul begot,
Revolting from my dugs and nurture, run
To foreign Realms; and since he first was gone,
Never saw me, but his Fathers murder charged
On me, and cruel threatenings has enlarged;
So that nor day, nor night, my sleeps were sweet,
But the next hour I looked my death to meet;
But now this day is my deliverer
From all my fears of him, my fears of her.
'Twas she, a worse and inmate grief I housed,
Which gnawed my bones, and my heart-bloud carous'd.
But now, our quiet days, without annoy
Survive, nor shall her threats impeach our joy.

El. Wo's me poor wretch! 't is time thy fall to mourn,
My dear Orestes, who art yet a scorn
To thy reviling Mother; well is this?

Clyt. No, not with you; but well with him it is.


El. Give ear, O Justice, and revenge the dead.


Cly. She has given ear aright, and well decreed.


El. Mock on, for your prosperity now flaunts.


Cly. You and Orestes never will leave these taunts.


El. Yes, we have left, but cannot make you leave


Clyt. Good stranger, may thou all reward receive,
That thou have freed us from her brawling tone.

Tut. Well, I am going then, since that is done.


Clyt. By no means, Sir, that thought does neither suit
With your great Lords respect, nor my repute:
But enter in, and let her without door,
Her own distresses, and her friends deplore Clytemnestra carries the Tutour
off the stage, to entertain him in her Court.

El. Do not you mark how passionate, how wild
Distressed Lady she bewayls her child?
That he is dead, and that he thus should die?
No: she unnat'rall laughs. Unhappy I!
I, who dear Brother, perish in thy fall,
While thou have buried at thy Funeral,
My remnant of low hopes to see the day,
When thy just hand full vengeance should display,
A Fathers death, and Sisters wrongs to pay.
Now where shall I my doleful footsteps turn,
Who am all desolate, and twice forlorn?
Brotherlesse Orphan. Once more to their check
Whom I most hate, I must submit my neck,
My Fathers Headsmen serve. With me is 't well?
But 't is resolved, I will no longer dwell
In these cursed walls, Electra lays her down before the gate. but here before
this gate
Laying me down, will fade disconsolate,
And let them, if they take this ill within
Kill me, my slaughter were a courteous sin,
To live is pain, the light I hate to spinne.

Quir. 1 Where be Joves thunders fled,
2 And Phoebus burnisht head,
3 If this they eye,
4 Like standers by?

El. 5 Ah! woe!

Quir. 6 Lady, why this lament?

El. 7 Oh!

Quir. 8 Be not too vehement.

El. 9 You kill me.

Qu. 10 How?

El. 11 If you with hopes beguil me,
12 Of those whom plain we know,
13 Fled to deaths region below:
14 My dying light,
15 You even quench outright.

Qu. 1 Why the The Quire endeavors to comfort her by the example of Amphiarus
who was in like manner betrayed to death by his wife Eriphyle. For he being a
footh-sayer fore-knew that if he went to the Thebane war, he should there
die, and hid himself: But Adrastus enticed his wife with the giving her a
precious chain, to a discovery of him: And so going against Thebes, with the
other Princes, was swallowed up the first day, with his coach and four horses,
by an opening of the earth. Which lewdness of his mother, Alcmaeon being
brought up to age, expiated, by executing her.
Argive Bard I knew,
2 Whom the gold Bracelet slew,
3 First hid in 's cave.
4 And now in 's grave.

El 5 Ah! woe!

Qu. 6 He Is Sovereigne of the dead.

El. 7 Oh!

Qu. 8 Oh truly! for it is sad.

El. 9 He perished.

Qu. 10 Yes.

El. 11 True, true: for a friend cherisht
12 His Orphan at 's decease;
13 But none vouchsafes my grief to ease:
14 And he that would,
15 Is blasted in the bud.

Qui. 1 Sad Lady you sad things endure.

El. 2 I know it, I know it too sure:
3 Sorrow's crowding, overflowing,
4 Never fading, ever growing.

Qui. 5 We all bear witness to your Cry.

El. O then look you no more
7 Entice me to give over.

Qui. 8 What say you?

El. That exploit now comes into her mind, which she afterward invites her
sister too.
Yet I spy
9 Helpers beside,
10 Hopes of blood royal near allied.

Qu. 1 All mortals death must undergo.

El. 2 In cruel racing too?
3 As, unhappy, he was mangled,
4 In the winding traces tangled.

Qui. 5 It was an unseen misery.

El. 6 Yes, for in foreign land,
7 Without my careful hand.

Qu. 8 Alas now!

El. He must lie,
9 Nor buried,
10 Nor with my tears upon him shed.

Chry. Wingd with delight, and by sweet pleasure chac't,
Quitting all decent gate, I hither have:
For joyful news I bring, and sure repose
From the long burden of your pressing woes.

El. Whence can you find a balsome for my heart,
Whose wounds are past the slender cure of art?

Chry. Oreste's come: take it from me, and know,
It Is sure as that thou strangely eye me now.

El. Art mad poor wretch: or do thou this design,
To laugh at thine own miseries and mine?

Chry. No, household Vesta help me, as no jeer
I mean at all: but he is certain here.

El. Ah me unhappy! on what mortals breath
Builds thy assurance it is unerring faith?

Chr. Mine and none others eyes my authors were,
Sure signs I saw, and a true message bear.

El. Poor heart, what surety saw thou? from what aim
Striv'st thou to fan my breasts expiring flame?

Chr. Now for the gods sakes hark, and as you find
Repute me henceforth sound or weak in mind.

El. Tell on then, if you pleasure take to tell.


Chr. I will, and nothing that I know conceal.
When I approcht my Fathers ancient stone,
Fresh riv'lets of new milk run trickling down
From the hillock I descry: and a sweet rownd
Of several flowers my Fathers ashes crowned.
Seeing I wonder, and I wondering stand
To see the Author, if he were at hand:
But when I viewd the coast on all sides clear,
Nearer the tomb I stole: whose brinks appear
Strowd all about with locks of new-shorn hair:
Which when, poor wretch, I saw, my active thought
A face well known unto my fancy brought:
I straight presaged no hand but that alone
Of dear Orestes could this office own.
Taking them up, no blasting curse I band,
But tears of joy in my warm ey-lids stand;
So that both then, and now, I firmly know,
That these devotions none but him can show:
For, bating us, to whom does this pertain?
Now that my act it is not I witness can;
Nor is it yours: for how could you escape,
Which rue it if but out to Church you step?
Nor does my mothers heart delight to act
Such works, nor had she carried it untrack'd.
Orestes it is; these Honors must design.
Then, dear, courage: Always the face divine
Views not the same with the same constant shine;
It yet has frownd on us, and who can tell,
Whether this day much happiness may seal?

El. Poor fool! I pity thee even all the way.


Chapter What Is this? rejoice you not at what I say?


El. Thou know not where thou stand'st, nor what is thy thought.


Chapter How know I not that which mine eyes me taught?


El. He Is dead, poor wretch, thy hopes are at an end,
Of aid from him, no more on him depend.

Chapter Unhappy me! of whom did you this hear?


El. Of one which when he fell, himself was near.


Chapter And where is he? amazement strikes my breast.


El. Bout house; my mothers dear and welcome guest.


Chapter Unhappy me! who was he then that gave
Those lib'rall off rings at my Fathers grave?

El. I am persuaded some kind hand has paid
Those sad devotions to Orestes shade.

Chapter Distressed me! but I with joy surprizd
Hastened to bring this word, nor once surmizd
In what sad case we are, but coming view,
My ancient Bill of care enflamd with new.

El. Thus stands your case, but if you will hear my mind,
This pressing load of grief you shall unbind.

Chapter Can I the dead to life raise up again?


El. There Is no such need: I was not sure so vain.


Chapter What other action can my strength effect?


El. Dare but to move as I shall you direct.


Chapter Why if 't be good, I will not come behind.


El. See, without pains nothing success can find.


Chapter I see: and will contribute too my All.


El. Hark then which way my resolutions fall.
Our store of friends, you know that none we have
But all are svvallovv'd by the ravenous grave.
And only we distressed pair survive.
Now while I heard my brother was alive
And flourisht, still, one day, my hopes did rest,
He for his Fathers blood would make inquest.
But since he is gone, to you I turn my eyes,
That with your sister joining enterprise,
You should not now to execute defer
Egist our Fathers executioner:
For naught it boots longer my thoughts to stop,
And till when will you slug? upon what hope
Not slighted look you? You indeed may moan.
Of your revenue robbed and portion:
And you may grieve which to this ancient day
Unbedded and unwedded wear away.
Nay, never must you look these joys to meet:
For think not Egist is so indisereet,
To suffer once your stock or mine to flourish,
Which were his open overthrow to nourish.
But if you will my earnest counsel trust,
First to our Fathers and our Brothers dust,
Perform the Ceremony's of the Dead,
Then as you are nobly born, and nobly bred,
Assert thy Name, and thou a Match shall find
Of worth, for all to virtue are inclined.
But as for fame, you know not what respect,
Obeying me, on us both you reffect.
For who or Friend or Stranger shall us meet,
But will us with this commendation greet?
Mark Dear Companions those two Sisters: those
Who from the Dust redeemed their Fathers house.
Who when Victorious Treason highest flew,
Spared not for life, but the bold rebel slew:
These we must love: these we must reverence all:
And for their Spirit at Feasts and publik Hall,
Receive with Honor Epidemicall.
Thus shall all living us with praises Crown,
So that nor Life, nor Death shall want renown.
Wherefore Dear soul be ruled your Sire relieve,
Assist your Brother, rescue me from grief.
Rescue your self: Assured of this, it is base
Well to be born and live in foul disgrace.

Qui. In such affairs Advice were a good Friend,
To them that Counsel, and them that atend.

Chry. Now e're she spoke, Lady's, had Virtue reigned,
She Modesty had kept which now is stained.
For on what grounds in desp'rat boldness yet
Dress you your Heart and fain would me abet?
Nor count how you are Woman born not Man,
Inferior is our Sex, and lesser can;
Then their Prosperity in Spring-tides flow'th,
Ours back is Eb'd and parcheth into Drouth.
Who then shall plot to stricke off such a Head,
And think to carry it unpunished?
See then lest Bad enough to Worse advance;
If any Ear on these our Counsels glance.
For naught it helps us, nor our stare amends,
To gain good Names, and come to shameful End^.
For Death is not the worst, but Death to will.
Nor to be able this Will to fulfill.
Now I beseech you e're you root us out
At once, and bring your Family to naught,
Assuage your heat: and all which has been said;
Unspoke, Undone, shall safely up be laid.
Only your Spirit check, and learn at length
How weak you are, and then submit to strength.

Qui. Be ruled: No treasure Man enjoy's so great
As is a wise Forecast, and mind disere^s.

El. All this before I looked for: I expected
That all which was applied should be rejected:
But with my Hand this work alone will I
Archieve: nor will we let out counsels die.

Chry. Oh --
Would when my Father died your Mind had been
Thus firmly bent; you all had finished then.

El. Why then my will was good, but loss my wit.


Chry. Strive that your wit stand always at that height.


El. You then instruct me but will nothing Aid.


Chry. Why it will bring us ruin if assayed.


El. I praise your wondrous Wit, but hate your fear.


Chry. When you shall thank me for it I Will give ear.


El. Never expect to find me in that Note.


Chry. Of that Hereafter gives the surer Vote.


El. Away, for thou art one will it nothing do.


Chry. I would, but thou art one wilt nothing know.


El. Go tell your Mother the discourse we have had.


Chry. No, Sister, yet I love you not so bad.


El. Know you to great disgrace draw me aside.


Chry. To no disgrace, but wisdom I you guide.


El. I follow must what you for Justice read.


Chry. When you with Judgment join, then you shall lead.


El. Pity one speaks so well, and speaks so wide.


Chry. Right said you that, to your own speech applied.


El. What seem I not with Justice to combine?


Chry. Yes but sometime Justice with Harm may Join.


El. I Will never to these laws Alleagiance pay.


Chry. But if you do, you will thank me for it one Day.


El. Yes I will do, nor will at all you dread.


Chry. Is 't true? nor will you second Counsel read?


El. No: for of Bads, the Worst Bad Counsel is.


Chry. All I have said you understand amiss.


El. Long fixed is this resolve; no sudden Motion.


Chry. Then I am gone, for on my words attend.
You will not, nor can-I your works commend.

El Go in: never will I be at your devotion,
Though most you wish it; for it is foolish pains,
If we Content pursue, where none remains.

Chry, This she speaks as she is walking away. Why if you think you are so,
still be wise;
But when you feel it, you will praise my Advice.

Qui. 1 Why mark we the wise fowl, Above,
2 In Country and in Natural love;
3 Where the Dam looks to be fed,
4 Of those she has born and bred;
5 Nor do like Tribute pay.

2 Their children now in quarrels break:

4 Their Divisions Umpire set.
5 Electra still does float:
6 Poor she betrayed alone,

8 In The Nightingals sad note:
9 Nor cares for Death;
10 But provides to morgage breath,
11 While she those twin-imps destroys.

Or. Have we Dear Lady's, been directed right,
And do we on our purposed journey hit?

Qu. What is your search? and whether your desire?


Or. For Egist, where he dwells I long enquire.


Qu. You're right, and The Attick laws enjoined to show a stranger the way: as
Petitus in the last Chap. And Buzyges orderd it to be put into their
Commination, that those who turned strangers out of their way, should be cursed
publicly through the city, amongst them that were guilty of other heinous
offenses.
harmless your directour save.


Or. Who then to those within this errand carries,
That here a welcome message for them tarries?

Qu. Here 's one. if of her Brother news she have.


Or. Go, Maiden, them within acquaint; At gate
Some men of Phocia for Egist wait.

Qu. Unhappy me! You come not to evince,
The late report we had by certain signs

Or. Your talk I know not: But some weighty thing
Touching Orestes, from old Strophius bring.

Qu. What is it friend? I feel a chilling fear.


Or. We in small Urn these Funeral relics bear
In hand, behold it, of Orestes here.

El. Ay wretched me! Now plain before mine eye,
I see the weight, and feel the misery.

Or. If for Orestes you a tear let slide,
Know that this pitcher does his Body hide.

El. Friend, give me leave, for the gods sake I am bold,
To take this in my hand, if this him hold:
That over these ashes I may wail and moan
My self, and all my family undone.

Or. Come reach it her, who e're she be, for sure
I Will will would never this request precure:
But or some Friend, or else in blood she is near.

El. O thou his monument, who was most dear
The remnant of Orestes soul: how wide
Thy settings-forth, and thy return's divide?
For now my hands can poyse thy empty load,
But, child, I sent thee glorious abroad.
Would I had breathed my last e're I thee left
To foreign lands, and saved thy life by theft!
Then had thou with thy Sire that day destroyed,
As Death with Death, so Grave by grave enjoyed.
But now from home, and vagrant in strange coast,
Without thy Sister, thou art sadly lost.
Nor did with tender hands unhappy I,
Thy loved corse in Barhings purify:
Nor did I take, as decent rites require.
The doleful burden from the solemn fire:
But by strange hands laid out, thou do return
The easy measure of a shallow Urn.
Wretched me! Oh my feeding thee of old
Now comes to naught! For often I thee did hold,
Nursing with peasant trouble. Thou were styled
Not more at all thy Mothers, then my child.
I was thy Nurse, not they within reputed.
And I thy sister always was saluted.
But all these comforts in one day are dead,
With thee expiring: thou with them art fled.
Thou like a whirlwind rush'dst: Fallen is my Father:
I from thee perishr: Thou destroyed together.
The euemy laughs, and wild with joy does rant
Thy Stop-dame-Mother; which lewd miscreant
Thou often to me in private message sent,
That thou would bring to condign punishment.
But all those just resolves, and vews repeated,
Thine, and my angry Angel have defeated,
Which thus to me has in sad wise conveyed
For thy sweat Face, this dust and useless shade.
O me! O me!
O Doleful corse! Ay! Ay!
O how dismal! Oh me! O me!
A journey tookst thou, Dearest, to my death,
Thy Sisters death, O soul more dear then breath.
Wherefore thou Me to Thee take in this room,
Nothing to nothing: so for time to come
I Will lodge with thee Below: for thou Above
And I did always equal fortunes prove.
And now I long thy Death and Urn to share:
For I perceive not that the dead take care.

Qu. Electra, think a Mortal Sire you had,
And Mortal Brother too, nor grieve too bad,
For we are out-lawed all till Death be paid.

Or. Oh! oh! what shall I say? what strange address
Contrive? nor can I longer me suppress.

El. What is your grief? what may this language sound?


Or. Is yours Electra's visage so renowned?


El. This is the same, and in full grievous plight.


Or. Alas! how sad and pitiful a sight!


El. Why Stranger, do you thus for me lament?


Or. O Body wickedly and basely rent!


El. I, gentle Stranger, am the same you moan,


Or. O sad unwedded desolation!


El. Why, Stranger, look you thus on me, and sigh?


Or. Of all my sorrows I never knew the tithe.


El. How know you that from ought has now been spoken?


Or. In seeing you with many troubles broken.


El. Few of my troubles are to sight disclosed.


Or. And how can worse then these be once supposed?


El. Because I still with murderers converse.


Or. Murdrers? of whom? strange grief thou do rehearse.


El. My Fathers Murdrers; and am made their drudge.


Or. What mortal does thee to this bondage judge?


El. One Mother called, but nothing Mother-like.


Or. And by what means? Does she thee starve or strike?


El. Both starvs and strikes, and all hard usage tries.


Or. And does no Helper, no Defender rise?


El. None, and my One that was is in your urn.


Or. Poor heart, I pity all along thy turn.


El. Know you are the only He has done thus much.


Or. For I am the only He your troubles touch.


El. You are not any way to us allied?


Or. I Would you resolve, might I in these confide.


El. You may; with honest Lady's you confer,


Or. Let go the Pot then, and the business hear.


El. Use me not, Stranger, for the gods sake so.


Or. Obey my words and you aright shall go.


El. Not for all dears: rob me not of my treasure.


Or. I can you not excuse.


El. Hard is my measure
If I thy dust, Orestes, must let go.

Or. Good words. Those groans no lawful warrant show.


El. No warrant, when I groan for my dead brother?


Or. Those words do not become you, but some other.


El. Am I so of the deads inseriours?


Or. Inferior you of none: nor is this yours.


El. If this Orestes body be, I poyse.


Or. Its no Orestes, but a coined device,


El. Where then, unhappy, is his tomb indeed?


Or. No where: For men alive no tomb do need.


El. What say thou man?


Or. No lie I do contrive.


El. And does he breath?


Or. As sure as I Am alive.


El, You are not he?


Or. See this my Fathers Seal,
And lern if I other then truth reveal,

El. O dearest fuce!


Or. Dearest I witness bear.


El. O voice art come?


Or. No other seek to hear.


El. I thee embrace.


Or. O may thou e're from hence!


El. Dearest companions, fellow citizens;
Behold Orestes by a fiction slain,
And by that fiction safely brought again.

Qu. Lady, we see. And all our grief to heal.
A tear of joy down from our eyes does steal.

El. 1 O Noblest, Noblest Progeny
2 Of the most Reverend, to me
3 At length brought back;
4 You come, you find, you see those whom you you lack,

Or. 1 We Are come: But over us let still silence hover.

El. 2 What is the business?

Or. 3 Silence were best, lest they within discover.

El. 1 Now Dian aid,
2 Eternal maid,
3 Of that be never afraid.
4 While such a female swarm
5 Still in the house, ring their alarm.

Or. 1 Beware, for women too can war assay:

El. 1 O joyful day!
2 Thou haft restord our light,
3 Wrapped up in constant night,
4 In one continued West,
5 So were our hearts distressed.

Or. 1 I know this too; but then we will reflect
2 On these affairs, when season shall direct,

El. 1 All time, all time I do repute
2 My present joyfulnesse to suit,
3 So just, so fit;
4 For never could I speak with freedom yet.

Or. 1 There I consent. Wherefore now keep it safer.

El. 2 By what endeauours?

Or. 3 By not enlarging, while time does not favor.

El. 1 Upon what fear
2 Now you appear
3 Can I to speak forbear,
4 When unwarn'd, unadvised,
5 I see thee hither come disguised?

Or. 1 Thou see me when the Gods decreed my way.

El. 1 Blessed news you say,
2 Greater then yet I knew,
3 You tell a joy that is new;
4 If God did guide, I say
5 Auspictous is your way.

Or. 1 Full loath I am to check your joy, but yet
2 The 14. following verses which are full of Female passions, depend upon an
unkindnesse which Electra takes at this expression.
I fear to pleasure you too much submit.

El. Thou who did please though held by long demurre
This pleasant voyage to prefer
Me spouse of sorrows do not thou --

Or. What should I not?


El. Do not me disallow
The pleasure of thy presence to declare

Or. With others I Would be angry should they dare.


El. You like me then!


Or. Why should I otherwise


El. O friends a voice
Which I exspected not I heard,
My anger speechless was,
And I to cry aloud afeard;
But now I hug thee; on thy face
A pleasant shine does sit
Which I though full of care should never forget.

Or. From all impertinent discourses cease:
Nor teach me that debancht my mother is;
That Egist all our Fathers coffers spends;
Wast's some himself, and shares some with his Friends.
The time would pass should we discoursing stand
But what may further the design in hand
Tell me, how in an hid or ouvert way,
My coming may my laughing foes allay.
And when we enter hold a watchful eye,
Lest you with cheerful looks your Mother spy,
But to the t^le of grief a groan let fly:
For, when our labors have obtained the goal,
Then we may laugh and joy without control.

El. Well Brother, what may make to your content
Shall be my care: for all my joys I rent
Derived from you, nor can my Freehold call;
Wherefore I would not, to your grief though small.
A great advantage reap: For I full ill
Should hearken to my present Angels will.
Nor can you otherwise but know the sum
Of our affairs: How Egist is from home;
But here within my Mother, whom never doubt
Lest she my merry countenance find out:
For both in ancient feud I with her burn;
And seeing the pleasure of your safe return,
To drop my liquid joy in plenteous shower,
Nor ever will desist, nor have the power:
For I have the^ dead and alive beheld
At ene approach, and wonders reconciled:
So that should I my Father meet alive,
Faith unastonisht to the sight I Would give:
Wherefore your own way, since you are arrived.
Lead on; for I had this alone archiev'd,
I had not missed what still was in my eye,
Bravely to quit my self, or bravely die.

Or. Silence I you advised. Some from within
I hear is coming forth.

El. Come, Strangers, in;
For what you bring, can neither forth be kept,
Nor can the taker with delight accept.

Tut. O Men most vain, and of all wit bereft,
What, of your lives have you no value left?
Or have you not of common sense a taste,
Who do not once conceive how you are placed,
Not at the Brink. but in wide hazzards deep!
For had not I light in the house to keep
A faithful ward, into the inmost room
Before your persons, your designs had come.
But now a sure provision I have made:
Wherefore aside all long discourses laid,
And dangerous joy by lavish shouts bewrayd,
Enter the house: for peril tracks delay,
And expedition here must win the Day.

Or. How at my entrance are things managed there?


Tut. Right well: for none will know you who you are.


Or. You then have of my death reporter been?


Tut, Know you are one of to other world within.


Or. And are they glad thereat? what words are given?


Tut. When all is done I Will answer: But until
All Is there, even that which is not well, is well.

El. Brother, I beg, resolve me what is this man?


Or. Know you him not?


El. Nor yet imagine can.


Or. Know you not whom you gave me in his hands?


El. Whom? what d' you mean?


Or. Who to the Phocian lands
Conveyed me secretly, sent by your order.

El, Is this that man, the only He of all
Whom I found faithful at my Fathers fall?

Or. The same it is: examine me no further.


El. O dearest face! O only ransomer
Of Agamemnons house! how camst thou here?
Art thou He which from Death have him set free,
And me from odious captivity?
Dearest, those hands, and those beloved feet
A sweet embassage bear! Nor did I heed
Thy near converse, nor would disclose; but flew'st
Me with thy words, when truth most dear, thou knewst.
Hail Father! for methinks I see my Father.
Hail, and know, thee most of all men together,
In one days compass I did hate and favor.

Tut. Enough: for these discourses made at pleasure,
The wheeling Nights, with equal Days may measure:
Which you Electra thus shall entertain.
But you that here attend, I tell you plain,
Now action fits: Now the Queen's all alone.
Now there is no man within: But if you drone
Consider how with these, and wiser far,
Being more then these, you must engage in War.

Or. Pylade, this work no further long delay
Requires, but in we with all speed we may.
And let us our homage offer to the gods
Which in this entrance take up their abodes. Pylade and Orestes kneel down and
pray. Electra kneels down too in the Court of the house with them.

El. Here let it not be thought an impertinencie, to annex these Corollaryes.
That first as the Heathens scattered their gods through all highways, and
fastened a devotion upon almost every object; so their adorations were not
retired from public view. And again, their shrines were ordinarily in the
bounds of places, such as are Borders of Countries, Havens, Corners of streets,
and Portals of houses, by which they parceld forth the Ubiquity of God, and
endeavored to piece out that Omnipresence which exceeds the measure of finite
capacities, with the rags of successive shifting of places. A third
observation is which follows.
Sovereigne Apollo, them with favor hear,
And me with them: for I did still appear.
With hand enlarged, The comparing this, with her presents Page 18. and her
mothers, Page 24. shows a sweet contemplation drawn from the Law of Nature, and
entire Reason, that the mites of a distressed innocent are more acceptable,
then the Baskets of fruits, the Basins of Spies, Gumms and Incense, the Boxes
of Oils, with flagons of Wine, and all other pompous blandishments which
dissembling oppressors offer.
according to my power.
And now, Lycean King, I bring my store,
I pray, I prostrate me, I beg. Combine
Thy aid propitious in this great design.
And then the unbelieving world shall see,
What due rewards the gods to vice decree.

Qu. 1 See how Mars breathing hostile blood,
2 Before is tasting of his food,
3 And entered rove within the house
4 The chasers of facts villaxous
5 The Hounds below!
6 So that not far behind does go
7 That which my mind did long foreknow.
1 For in the house brought from the dead,
2 The Judge in a disguise does tread,
3 His Fathers rich and ancient seat,
4 Grasping in hand his blade new whet:
5 And Maia's son,
6 Close Merc'ry leads them, putting on
7 A mist to the last, nor tarry's till anon.

El. Lady's most dear, The men within disspatch
The business, here do you with silence watch.

Qu. How? Now what do they?


El. While she does provide
A cauldron for the dead, they stand beside.

Qu. And why did you come out?


El. To stand a guard,
Lest Egist enter in and never be heard.

Clyt. Ah! Ah! Woe! the House
Widowed of Friends, and seized upon by Fiends!

El. One cri's within, do you not hear my friends?


Qu. 1 I a dismal hearing heard,
2 Made unhappy me afeard.

Clyt. 1 O me forlorn! Egist, where art thou? gone.

El. 2 Look, one cri's out again.

Clyt. O son! O son!
3 Pity thy Mother.

El. But I Am sure nor He,
4 Nor his own Father, pitied were by thee.

Qui. 1 Wretched City; wretched House,
2 Now the Fate of old thine own
3 Thee into waste ruins throw's
4 Down, Down.

1 Clyt. Oh! I am stabbed!


El. Courage and mend your blow.


Clyt. Oh! and again!


El. Would Egist were so too!


Qui. 1 The Curses prove. They breath
2 Whom Earth had lodged beneath:
3 For he which long ago was dead, now drains,
4 Channels of Blood from out the Murderers veyns.

El. 1 So they come forth, his Crimson hand does wreak
2 With Wars oblation; But I cannot speak
3 How are things carried?

Or. Things within are wrought
4 Well if Apollos wisdom well has taught,
5 The Wretch is Dead; Henceforth all Fear displace,
6 Your Mothers spite never shall you more disgrace.

Qui. 1 Peace! for I discover clear,
2 Egist does in sight appear.

El. 1 Lady's, what not retire?

Or. Do you perceive
2 The Man at Hand?

El. He does the suburbs leave
3 With Jocond pace --
4 --

Qui. 1 In the House: go Ambush'd sit,
2 With all present speediness:
3 Those things hitherto have hit
4 May these!

Or. 1 Rest quiet we perform your will.

El. Then have.


Or. 2 I Am lodged.

El. My charge be over these actions placed


Qui. 1 'Twere best a while picquere,
2 And buzze into his ear
3 Some idle tale; and play the fish, that so
4 He unawares may rush on judgments blow.

Egist. 1 The Phocian strangers which of you can shows
2 Who of Orestes death they say bring news,
3 That he was cast away in the Chariet-wrecks?
4 Can you? or you? or can you I must ask
5 That were so fierce before: for you I take
6 Here most concerned, and best report can make.

El. Electra in all heranswers now only mocks with a double meaning play's
upon hisignorance to baffle him while things are set in order with in.
Know it! how should I less? or I should An utter Alien to my dearest grief.

Eg. Resolve me where one may the strangers live find


El. Within: for they have met with their Hosts kind.


Eg. And did they say for certain he was Dead?


El. No, (but they showed him too) not only said.


Eg. And may we see this plain convincing light?


El. You may: your self will pity much the sight.


Eg. Much joy thou tell me of besides thy wont.


El. Increase your joy if this for joy you count!


Eg. Silence I will you, and the Gates unfold,
That Argives and Mycenians may behold:
That so if any with presumption spread,
Has stuff't his Sails, seeing the Prince is dead
He may my Curb endure, and henceforth fear
Least condemn, his haughty Head to rear.

El. My duty is performed: for I late wit
Have got, and can to power now submit.

Eg. The Body of slain Clytemnestra is drawn forth vayled into the Stage,
represented to Egist as the Corse of Orestes. O Jove! A sight I see with sorrow
clo'yd,
But whether judgments hand I not decide.
Withdraw the Veil that even I may shed,
A tear upon my Kinsman that is dead.

Or. Take it your self. It Is not mine but your own
To look upon, and with kind words to mean.

Eg, It Is right, I will: But some of you 'bout House
Go Clytemnestra hither call to us.

Or. She is hard by you; look no further for her.


Eg. He disinvelops it. Oh! what see I?


Or. Whom look you on with horror?


Eg. What Men have me within their nots enclosed
At unawares?

Or. Have you not that supposed,
How you alive talk with the Dead thus free?

Eg. Alack, I take the word. It cannot be,
But this Orestes is, who talks with me.

Or. You out so long and such A Cunning Man!


Eg. Wretch I am lost: yet let me this obtain
Hear one word.

El. Brother, do not, I beseech
Let him go on, and spin a teadious speech.
For wherein is a Dying Man relieved
If he one grievous Minute be reprieved?
But kill him out of hand, and being killed,
Give him the Bury all of the open field
Out of our sight: for only this will lose
The sad remembrance of my ancient woes.

Or. Get you in quickly: For you now Commence
An Execution and no defense.

Eg. Why do you hale me in? if this be fair
Why lacks it Night, and dreads the open Air?

Or. Appoint you not. But to the Chamber hy
Where you my Father killed and there Come die.

Eg. Is it ordein'd that that same Room must see
The Pelops Ills that are, and Are to be.

Or. It must yours. I of that give a shroud guess.


Eg. Your Fathers honor you do not profess.


Or. You much dispute, but go but slowly on.
Advance.

Eg. Go first.


Or. No you must lead the van.


Eg. Shall I not escape you.


Or. I must now beware
All ease that you a bitter death may share.
'Twere fit this Martial law did still prevail,
That who so durst transgress the statutes pale,
Might straight be killed, for villains soon would fail.

Qui. Atreus seed how hard oppressed,
Art thou at length arrived at rest
by this Assay redrest!

THE END.
THE EPILOGUE: Showing the Parallel in two Poems, THE RETVRN, and THE REST
AVRATION, Addressed to her Highness, the Lady ELIZABETH. MDCXLIX.
THE RETVRN. To Her Highness, the Lady ELIZABETH.
BRight Saint,
Just Heaven has seen thy Tears:
Thy Brother on our Isles appears.
Request and Sorrow now leave off,
When glad Enjoyment says, Enough.
Let no sad Thought take from the grace
Of a serene and full-blown Praise.
Looks over-cast but ill do suit,
The Royal Stranger to salute.
Honor with mirth now reconciles:
Reject not those officious smiles
Which hover yet aloof, and seek
To perch upon your lovely cheek.
MADAM,
Lift up your pleasant eye,
In yonder Nook sits Majesty.
Our Sov'reigne at that Spot begun
Three Kingdoms just Possession.
Thus a received Turf does yield,
Full seisin of its native Field;
And from that straight and distant sphere,
Weighs and directs his free Carier.
As first the early point of Day,
Aloof does but the Earth survey,
But straight the dark profound invades,
And chases out the flying shades.
There he debates what ready way,
A glorious Entrance to assay.
The numerous sinners he descry's
Parted by Seas and Enmiti's.
He sees, and so do the sage States,
That as their Fear, their Love abates:
Because, though their grim Horsemen tread
Upon the quaking Countries head;
Though they our lives hang at their beck,
And a stiff yoke about our neck;
Though they can spoil without Consent,
Yet e're they rule we must Indent:
Force can but in a Rape engage,
'T is Choice must make it Marriage.
Hence a Conveyance they contrive,
Which must on us their Cause derive:
This must attaque, what holds out still,
And is impregnable, the Will.
This must enchant our conscious hands,
To slumber in like guilty bands,
While like the froward Miltonist,
We our old Nuptial knot untwist:
And with the hands, late faith did join,
This Bill of plain Divorce now sign.
Here their New Kingdom must commence,
And Sin conspire with Conscience.
This spills our Blood lost in just wars,
And brands with Shame our honest Scarrs:
His Fathers murder this commends,
And crowns it with its plotted ends.
His Sacred Person this assayles,
And the dire Regicide entayles.
He, the bold Blank defied discerns,
And Malice but his Laughter earns;
So what they for fresh lists devise,
Into their thin short Kingdom pry's.
Next he the Realm views in all parts
Shut on Him, but the Peoples hearts.
While his approach new warmth does shed
On those Desire had massacred.
His double Righteousness all draws
That of Himself, that of his Cause:
His Person Signatures presents
Where King and Conquest pitch their tents;
Taller, then Palms, whose humble Top,
Does to his lofty Temples stoop.
And pays a tributary Bough;
To bind on his Victorious Brow.
Then Beacons placed on Mountains, those
Mountains which HER late Prince outgrows
A valiant Black his Brow does wear,
Our reverence; but Traitors fear:
His look speaks out, it was designed,
Subjects to conquer, not to find.
Which Heat, lest we should fear his Ray's,
The Fathers Clemency allay's;
See how our heaving Souls enlarge!
See how fresh Spirits our strength surcharge!
Till in his Banner wrapped we prove,
Nothing so strong as loyal Love:
And touched from Heaven with holy flame
His Throne we plant, his Foes we tame.
THE REST AVRATION. To Her said Highness,
GReat Princess,
Then the Royal Nun,
Shall find her Husband in her Son.
And take, since mourning weeds must cease
Beauty and Honor for her dress.
Her love impregnable did stand,
Against the Sea, against the Land.
While her Lord grieved, she scorned delight,
Companion of his Bed and Flight.
She thought it Dutiful to claim
A Portion in her Husbands shame.
Wherefore our streets when she shall pass,
Proud Matrons shall empale the ways:
And as she walks her pious Ey's,
Our easy Dames will Catechize.
Thy Prison too shall then fly open,
And ripe deliverance kiss Hope.
Here Thy free sight at large shall rove,
And Thou if but look up Above,
Thy Brother in his Throne shall eye
Burnish't in a full Majesty.
About his Seat at each just Hand,
A bright Array of Peers shall stand.
Not such who take up their high Name,
On credit of some dalliant Dame:
These in mean Lusts spend their cheap Age,
Nor ought degenerate from the Page.
Hence, they at rates low as their wit,
Can their usurped Honor quit.
For though an Apparition gay,
May ruffle in the milky way.
Taking acquaintance with the star's,
Like one of their familiar Peers:
Nay may rant down the lesser fry,
Like Younger Brothers of the sky;
And boasting of his richer light,
First Cozen to the Sun should write:
Yet if he shall his Orb resign;
Shut up his Windows; cease to shine;
If his assumed Beauty's smoot;
And through the empty Hollow shoot;
Scattering all along the air,
His periwig of yellow hair;
Till he the lower Region plough,
And takes his bed up in a slough:
The Gazer that did late admire
His flagrant robes, and Tissue fire,
That then the Gallant did rehearse
Amidst the sparkling Courtiers,
When he perceivs his borrowed Lamp
With its exhausted Oil to damp;
Soon tracks the Cheaters sordid birth
From some dull Commoner of earth.
This Arm o'th sea of light mistook,
Dried up, proves Land-waters and Brook.
Our Lords their own clear line make good,
Marked out by loyal Parents blood,
Which the unspotted Plumes does lave,
That on their Crowned Temples wave:
They vouch their True and High Extraction,
By constant Faith, by noble Action.
Then let thy meek Affection bow,
To view and glad our Realm Below.
Here from a Popular bondage freed
The Country shall list up her head;
The Whip and Yoke now under hoof,
She kissing the sost rein of love,
With thankful mirth aloud shall ring,
Preferred to serve her gracious King.
Thou shall one spotless joy behold,
By no allaying sigh controlled.
Thus mark in Halls of great resort,
At Penshurst, or some Princes Court,
If my Lords angry Gentlemen
(The Upper House of his great train)
Or some big Steward shall crush down
His Fellows with perpetual frown;
The House, because he domineers,
And Takes upon him over his Peers,
Think the Yoke too hard to be born;
Not for the Burden, but the Scorn.
When if the wiser Lady soon
Spy and remove the grief, anon
You may a cheerful duty see,
Flit through the busy Family.
No Monster is so much abhorred,
As an Inferior surly lord.
The Villagers their knees shall bow,
Not awed by a stern troopers brow:
As Larks upon their Pestles squat,
If but one daring Hobby bayt.
Nor shall this Care their gladness spoil,
How they to be undone must toil.
The VVealthy City shall give thanks
In decent State, and Reverend ranks:
Not offering up constrained Rites,
Amidst Church-driven Proselytes.
No lip a faint Amen shall say,
While the Recusant Heart would, Nay.
The Heart whose pensive strings are wrackt,
With stock decayed, and credit cracked:
For draining taxes more unsluce
Their gains, then does blood-thirsty Use.
While they a thin subsistence beat,
Manured by Perjury and Sweat,
Tacking a fortune up, until
Themselves, the last of VVares they sell,
For unseen stars and Countries bound,
Where no Wise Parliament is found;
For where the savage Ethiop fries,
No pineond Dragon is so Wise.
Our welcome Exiles home shall flee:
Our waiting Captives be set free.
From obscure Denns, from untrackd Caves
The retired Clear shall break their graves:
And from Contempt reformd put on
Glory and resurrection.
The Sons of VVisdome shall release
Their patient Spirits into meek peace;
Each reassuming his old Care,
Seated in a becoming Chair;
Hoary their Heads, their Tongue discreet,
Open their Hands, spotless their Feet.
When thou beholdest this rich Joy,
Embased by no sad Alloy;
Then mix thy Note and with one Quire,
Let our free Souls in Praise aspire.
