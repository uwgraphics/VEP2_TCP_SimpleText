To the courteous and Christian READER.
Reader,
THis little Book is divided into three parts, and it treats orderly of three
things; to wit, of the Covenant of grace, of the Covenant of works, and of the
promises belonging to both. In the two first parts is handled most, or all, of
the material Questions about the Gospel, and Law; also the Intent, extent, and
efficacy of the death of Christ; together with the Scriptures that declare the
same, and the Objections that are made about the universality thereof. In the
last Part are several things concerning the dividing, understanding, and
applying of the Promises: with an easy and speedy way how to find all, or
most, promises in the Bible alphabetically Though there be several books
extant, some upon the Gospel and Law, and others particularly upon the
Promises; yet, I hope, I may truly, and without ostentation affirm, that this
has the sum of most of them, and somewhat more then any of them, especially
concerning the Promises, (about which I have taken no small pains) where,
besides sever all other things, there are See page 260. etc.
forty five Rules, gathered out of the Scriptures, for to give light therein;
also the promises made to See page 269.
Christ personally, by themselves in several particulars: and the promises
made to the As page 271, etc.
Jews whilst they were formerly a Church: Likewise the promises that concern
the As Page 275. etc.
Jews hereaster, when they are called and converted; and these under distinct
and several heads. The third Part of this book (to wit, that upon the
Promises) may serve for a double use. First, as a small Concordance, where you
may find proofs (especially those of the nature of promises) for most material
points in Scripture. Secondly, this may serve for to help you to find Promises
for any thing you desire (and which is to be found in the Scripture) and that
instantly, without looking in the Table to the book, (for that reaches no
further then the promises) As for example, to find Promises of faith. See the
word Faith in the margin of page 331. so of any other word.

Object. But it may be you will say, There were several Books extant before,
that did direct us to find the Promises.

Answ. It is very true, that other (and far more able) men then my self, have
done exceeding well herein; yet to use the expression of one of them: That a
child upon a Giants shoulders, can see further then the Giant: So I, having the
help of their labors herein, and of other books, (but especially by a
frequent, through, and diligent search of Gods Book) I have by the Lords light
and Spirit, seen and set down (without vainglory be it mentioned) more
Promises, (by several scores according to comparison and computation) and in a
more distinct and easy way to find, then others have (to my understanding)
done before me, Observe but these few Rules, and I will leave thee to trial.

1 I do divide the Promises into two ranks or sorts, to wit, informing, and
assuring Promises, and the difference I make between them, is this; that the
informing Promises (which are upon the left side of the page) do not speak
directly, and patly, but by way of information but the Assuring Promises speak
directs, (and those are the chiefest Promises.) As for instance, in the word
pardon, page 404. in the Informing Promises in Nth. 9.17. God is said, to be
ready to pardon. But in the Assuring Promises in Jer. 33.8. God says I will
pardon all their iniquities.

2 Understand that there are not Informing and Assuring promises under every
word. As for example, in the word glory, there are no Assuring (or direct)
Promises: So in the word find there are no Informing Promises.

3 There are several things, or heads, under one word. As for example, under
the word receive there are six distinct things, so under the word save.

4 Where you find but few Promises, or sometimes but one Promise under a word,
know that there is no more in the Bible belonging to that word, as in the word
Peacemakers.

5 Note that several words are of the same signification, and if you find not
many, or several Promises in one word, turn and see in another: as in the word
Assurance; See there is know, faith, believe, confident.

6 Observe that sometime words that give light or testimony to a oint (though
they do not sound like P^mises, yet they) are set down as Promiss, As in the
word kindness.

7 Search for the Promises here, and then read them in Gods own Book, and
labor to get the Promises (especially the chief ones, and those that are of
spiritual, and special concernment) by heart.

Loving Reader, having held thee thus long in the Porch, I invite thee into the
house; but I am sorry that this book is so big, and I fear, dear (but not
dearer by any Merchandise I have made of it,) but its not so dear to thee, as
to me, it having cost me many nights study, because I would not neglect for the
Printing of a thousand Books, the preaching of one Sermon.

I intended this only for a private (yet worthy) Gentleman, who by many
several motions and courtesies put me on. I wish him and thee as much good in
reading, as I had in stuching and writing it; And this shall be the prayer of
one of the Lords meanest Saints, and in him thy servant, for thy souls good.

Question.
HOw many Covenants did God make with men concerning their salvation? Gal. 4.24
Rom 9.4. Ephesians. 2.12.


Answer, Two, Gal. 4.24. Romans 9.4. Ephesians. 2.12.

Quest. How are these two Covenants called?

Answ. The Mat. 11.5
Gospel, and the Joh. 1.16.
law, or commonly the Covenant of Ac. 20.32
grace and the Covenant of To. 3.24.
works.

Quest. Why do you place the Covenant of grace before the Covenant of works?

Answ. Because the Covenant of grace was in being Gal. 3.17.
before the Covenant of works.

Q. What do you mean by the Covenant of works?

A. I mean the Deu. 10.4
ten Commandments (called the Mal. 4.4
Law of Moses) which was delivered upon Deu. 29.1.
Mount Horch (or Gal. 4.24.
Synai) unto Moses for the children of Israel.

Q. Do you then take the ten Commandments for the Covenant of works?

A. Yea sure, and they are often in Scripture called a Deu. 4.13.5.23. Is. 24
5. Jer. 31.32 Heb. 8.9.
Covenant.

Q. But was not that, the Covenant of works, which God made with Adam in
Paradise before his fall?

A. I deny not, but that it was of the nature of a Hos. 6.7. Like Adam they
transgressed the Covenant.
Covenant, yet we find no more expressed, but a command Genesis 2.17.
do this and live, with a penalty, In the day thou eatest thereof thou shall
dye, but there is no promise made of eternal salvation upon the keeping of it.

Q. But do not you conceive that God did intend to give salvation unto Adam if
he had kept that command, though God did not expressly promise it.

A. I do conceive that Adam should have continued in that happy state, he was
in, and should never have dyed, if he had not sinned, for To. 5.12. 1 Cor. 15.21
by sin came death.

Q. What might be the reason, why God did not declare as well the promise, as
the command and penalty?

A. Though this be a secret, and known perfectly, only to God himself, yet we
may judge probably by the event, that God reserved, and kept secret to
himself, that part of his mind which concerned Adams eternal salvation,
because he intended not that Adam should be saved by his works.

Q. How does it appear that God did not intend to save Adam by his works?

A. Because God had pre-ordained, determined, and appointed another Ephesians. 1.3,
4, 5. 2 Timothy 1.9, 2 These. 2, 13. Rev. 13.8.17.8.
way and means ( viz. Jesus Christ) to save Adam and part of his posterity.

Q. If God had pre-ordained Christ as the means of men's salvation, was there
not then a necessity that Adam should sin.

A. Although God put no necessity upon Adam to sin, but left him to his free
choice, yet there was a necessity of bringing to light that heavenly plot, and
contrivement, wherein lay hid the mystery of Gods counsel, and the wonderment
of men's salvation, which could not be revealed until Adam had sinned: and so
(with reverence be it mentioned) the Son of man gave vent unto the grace of
God, and the fall of natural Adam, to the exaltation of spiritual Adam, Jesus
Christ.

Q. But was there any agreement about the salvation of men before Adam sinned?

A. Yes, there was an agreement and Covenant Es. 42.6.55.3 Zac. 6.13. Es. 50 5,
6.
between God the father, and his Who was then the word of God, Joh. 1.1.
Son Jesus Christ.

Q. When was that Covenant made with Jesus Christ?

A. Tit. 1.2. 2 Timothy 1.9.
Before the world began.

Objection, But is it not in the Greek, from the foundation or beginning of the
world, meaning that the Covenant was made with Adam, immediately after his fall,
and not with Christ before the foundation of the world?

A. The Greek will not bear it so, for (...) (which are the words in both
places before cited) signify, before the foundation of the world, or beginings
of times, for note that the preposition (...) when it governes a Genitive Case
(as here it does) it signifies before, as, 1 Pet. 1.20. 1 Cor. 4 5. 2 Timothy
4.21. so Ephesians. 1.4. 1 Pet. 1.20. 1 Cor 4.5. 2 Timothy 4.21 Ephesians. 14.
we are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world (the word before
there is in Greek (...)) if election be before the foundation of the world (as
sure it is) then also by the same ground a Covenant or promise, is made before
the foundation of the world, for the word proves the one as well as the other.

Q. But where in Scripture do you find that agreement (if there were any)
made with Christ before the foundation of the world, called a Covenant?

A. I suppose the word Covenant, could not be found in Scripture (in this sense
and case) yet if there be found words of the same signification, and holding
forth the truth of the thing it is sufficient, (for many words are used by the
godly and learned, which are not in Scripture (as Trinity, Sacrament, etc.) now
in Scripture it is called the Tit. 1.2.
the promise of eternal life, and so is the Covenant that God made with
Abraham called the Gal. 3.18 19, 22.
promise.

2. We have the word Covenant applied in this case, as in Zach. 9.11. As for
thee by the blood of thy Covenant, or whose Covenant is by blood: here God the
Father speaks to Christ, with relation to some Covenant between them both; and
we read of no other but this fore-spoken of. Psa. 89.28
Also in Psalm. 89.28. God the Father says again, My Covenant shall stand fast
with him, i.e. with Christ, if you consider (1) v. 25. he says that he would
set his hand (or power) in the Sea, that is, Christ should have power to
govern the Nations (2) v. 27. he is called, Gods first begotten son, a title
most properly given to Christ, Romans 8.29. Col. 1.15. (3) v. 29. Romans 8.29 Col.
1.15.
His seed should endure for ever, meaning the members of Christ, which are so
called in Esa. 53.10. Esa. 53.10


Obj. In verse 35. it is, I have sworn that I will not lie unto David,
therefore this Covenant was made with David, and his seed, i.e. Solomon, and
not with Christ and his seed.

A. Jesus Christ is called Esa. 22.22. Ezekiel. 37.24. Hos. 3.5.
David frequently in Scripture, because he was made of the To. 1.3 Called the
branch of David, Jer. 23.6. Mat. 1.1. because he sprang from Dav.
seed of David according to the flesh, though it be true, that God made a
Covenant with David, and his seed or son Solomon, and that this Psalm in the
letter of it, has relation thereunto; yet Solomon's Throne did not endure for
ever, but was Jer. 22.30 Ez. 21.16
overthrown, therefore sure this is to be applied only to Christ, and his
spiritual seed according to the strict and spiritual meaning of the words.

Quest. To what end should the Covenant of Grace be made before man stood in
need of grace, for till Adam had sinned, there was no necessity, or misery,
requiring grace or mercy?

Answ. Act. 15.18
Known to God are all his works, from (or before) the beginning of the world,
and he had all things then, as present, and as real before the eyes of his
glory as now he has, viz. man's creation, fall, and recovery, and in this sense
there was no precedence of time in regard of any of Gods counsels, or secret
acts. Moreover, God foreseeing that man would sin (and thereby stand in need
of Grace) he prepared this sovereigne salve (Christ or the promise of life and
grace) to be presently applied, and clapped to this wounded dying man; as the
brazen Serpent was prepared, and Number. 21 8, 9.
set up beforehand for them that should afterward be stung.

Q. What was the nature of that. Covenant which God the Father made with Jesus
Christ?

A. It was a Joh. 6 39 40. Heb. 10.7.
voluntary, Ephesians. 1.5.
well-pleasing, and Es. 53.10 11.
mutual act, and agreement, between the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ,
such as a man makes with his Ephesians. 1.9
own mind, concerning his own children, or members.

Q. Who were the parties concerned in this Covenant?

A. God the Father, Esa. 42.1
Jesus Christ the Mediator, and the Gal. 3.16. called Christ 1 Cor. 12.12.
Church or body of Christ, for whom he was to mediate.

Q. What did God the Father then promise unto Christ on his part?

A. They were either things that did belong to the work of his Mediatorship,
or things to gratify and satisfy him, for his work of Mediation,

Q. What were those things that God the Father did promise Christ, as belonging
to the work of his Mediation?

A. That he would Heb. 1.9
annoint him, and Esa. 11.2.
fill him, with the Spirit above all others, and Heb. 10.5.10.
fit him with a body, to sacrifice for sins: and Esa. 42.1.
uphold and Esa. 42.6.50.5.
strengthen him, that he should not be Esa. 50 7
confounded, nor ashamed, by the things he suffered.

Q. What were those things which God the Father promised Jesus Christ in way of
gratification, and satisfaction, for the work of his mediation?

A. That he would Esa. 50.8
justify, and glorify him, Joh. 17.22 24.
and all Esa. 53.11
his seed, and that he should Esa. 53.10 Heb. 2.7.10.
see, and Ephesians 5 25 27.
enjoy, the travel, and purchase of his soul and body; and have Mat. 28.18
all power in heaven, and in earth, given to him, till all things be 1 Cor.
15.28.
subdued unto him, and when God must be all in all.

Q. What was the sum of the Covenant promised, and to be performed on Christ's
part?

A. To become a Heb 8.6.
Mediator, Heb. 7.22
Surety, and Act. 13.23
Savior for all those that his Father should Joh. 17.11, 12.
give him, and in the Fathers appointed time, to become flesh, Gal. 4 4.
for to Mat. 11.27
manifest and Joh. 17.4
glorify his Father, by Jo. 6.39.
revealing, and Joh. 15 10
keeping his will. Also to Luke 24.46.
suffer, and Hos. 13.14
satisfy 1 Pet. 2.24
personally, and He 10.14
perfectly, for the sins of men, and having Jo. 14.4.19
finished his work, to bring Joh. 10.18
himself, and those Joh 6.39.40.
given to him (by the Father) unto Heb. 2.10
glory.

Quest. What followed upon the making of this Covenant, between the Father and
Jesus Christ?

Answ. Christ being Esa. 42.1
elected, Joh. 6.27
sealed and Jo. 10.36
sanctified, ( viz. set apart) to his office of Mediatorship, and those Joh.
6.39
given him by the Father, being also Ephesians. 1.4 v. 5. so the Greek word (...)
signifies.
elected, and 2 The. 2.13
sealed to obtain adoption, and salvation through Christ. The Father Ephesians. 1.22
Col. 1.18.
gave Christ, to be the head of that select number and body (and the head of
all other things for that body) and so filled Christ with his Col. 1.19
own fullness, that he should let out Ioh. 1.16
grace for grace into that body, and so committed them to his Ioh. 17.12 Genesis
43.13.14.
care, charge, and custody, (as Jacob did Benjamin to Reuben, Genesis 43.13, 14.)
having first given them his 2 Timothy 1.9
grace, and Ephesians. 1.3.
blessing in Christ Jesus.

Q What moved God the Father to make such a Covenant?

A. In respect of himself, his Ephesians. 1.5. Rev. 4.11.
own pleasure and Romans 9.23. 2 Cor. 1.20
glory, in respect of men Ioh. 3.16, 17, 23.
free love, and Romans 11.5.
grace. For Gods first and maine end in all his actions, is his Ioh. 11.4 Ephesians.
1.6.12
own glory, and next making out his Ier. 31.3. Ephesians. 2.7.
goodness unto his creatures.

Q. But did not God foresee that those (for whom he covenanted with Christ)
would believe and do good works, and was not their foreseen faith and works,
the cause that moved God to make such a Covenant?

A. 1. No, but rather God did foresee, that they could not, nor would not of
themselves, believe, or do good works. For considering men in themselves, and
without Christ, they were Ephesians. 2.1.5. 1 Timothy 6.5
dead in their sins, Romans 5.8 Ioh. 15.8.
without strength, and having neither Ioh. 6.44 Ephesians 2.8.
will nor power, neither in themselves, nor of themselves, either to believe,
or to Phil. 2.13 2 Cor. 3.5.
do any good work: and therefore Gods grace preventeth and prepares us,
before we can be able, and works in us, that we may be able.

2. When the Scriptures speak of predestination, and ordination before time to
salvation (which as I showed before, has relation to Christ, and that Covenant
made with him) they say we are predestined and ordained to Act. 13.39. 2
These. 2.13.
believe, and to Ephesians. 2.10 Romans 8.29
do good works, and not for believing, and doing good works.

Q If God covenanted with Christ to give salvation to some, and not to all, did
he not then leave the rest in a state of impossibility to be saved, and in a
state of certainty to be damned?

A. I. God is not accountable to man for his actions, and this is sufficient
that the will of God is the Romans 9.15 18.22.
supreme reason of all his actions, and it should satisfy us that God does
what he will, and wills himself, and his own glory chiefly, so that if man's
misery tends to Gods glory, it is man's duty to be silent, and subject thereunto.

2. Though God by this Covenant does entaile and assure salvation upon, and
unto the seed of Christ, yet it does not necessarily follow, that the rest are
left unavoidably in a state of damnation. It is true that Gods preordination,
presignation, and promise (before time) declared Gods special favor to such
as he chose, and his preterition, and passing by the rest, showed a less
regard of them, and dis-ingagement of God to them.

Obj. But the absolute electing of some, does argue the absolute reprobating of
others.

A. God in the act of election, In no moment of nature did the purpose of
condemnation go before the foresight of sin, says Dr. Twisse.
and in the act of preterition, looked upon men as fallen (and not as innocent
and unfallen) and thereby his grace does more eminently appear in the one, and
his justice is more apparently justifiable (as toward men) in the other.

Obj. But is not election the cause of salvation, and reprobation the cause of
damnation?

A. Election and Reprobation, are not (in any sense) the causes of salvation,
and damnation, but Christ is the proper and meritorious cause of salvation, and
sin the proper, and meritorious cause of damnation. Election and reprobation
they are but precedent, and precurrent acts, or decrees: and the causes of
salvation and Damnation, they come in between the decrees and the execution
thereof.

Obj. But the Decree of reprobation, puts a necessity upon men to sin, for if
God has decreed the punishment he has decreed the cause also.

A. The decree puts no more necessity upon men to sin, then the secret intent
and purpose of a King to put his just Law in execution, makes a malefactor
guilty, and to suffer according to that law, further who dares reply against
God if he would have it so? To. 9.20.


Obj. But if a King makes a law so strict that his Subjects cannot keep it,
and then punishes his Subjects for breaking it, is not that King more guilty
then his Subject?

A. But the case is not so, for God when he gave the Law at first to man (viz,
Adam) he did not give him such a Law that he could not keep.

Q. How does it appear that Adam could have observed, and kept that Law which
God gave him in his innocent state?

A. I. Because the Scripture testifies of him, that he was made Ecl. 7.29
upright and in Genesis 5 1
Gods own likeness, ( viz. in knowledge, holiness, and power) and therefore
sure he was fit, and able to keep it.

2. The commandment that God gave Adam to obey, it was no hard commandment,
to be observed by such a spiritual man.

Ob. But Adam was no other then a mere earthly and natural man, 1 Cor. 15.47.
for had he been spiritual, he could not have fallen from that state.

A. It is true; that Adams body was of the earth, yet Adams soul was
immediately from heaven, and therefore spiritual. And why might not Adam
(though spiritual) as well as the Angels (seeing they were alike without
promise of upholding them, and no union of spirit between them and God, or
Christ, and but mutually good) fall from that state.

Q. What death did Adams transgression and disobedience deserve, and bring upon
himself and his posterity?

A. All that the Scripture calls To. 5.14 1 Cor. 15.21.
death, which is either natural Lu. 1.79
spiritual, or Romans 5.2 Ephesians. 2.1. Iam. 1.15. To. 5.15.18.
eternal.

Q. How does it appear that Adams sin brought eternal death?

A. 1. From the words of the Apostle, Romans 5.16.18. Judgment was by one to
condemnation, and judgment came upon all men to condemnation. Now condemnation
must be understood here, as in other places of Scripture for Ioh. 5.24. Romans
8.1.
eternal condemnation, also the Greek word (...) used in those To. 5.16.18.
two texts is always in Scripture for eternal condemnation: (and differs from
the word (...) judgment) lastly, here is judgment and condemnation together,
which imports both a temporal and eternal judgment.

2. That condemnation which is put in opposition to eternal life, must needs
be eternal condemnation: but this condemnation is such, Romans 5.21. Romans 5.21
for the Apostle says, That as sin has reigned unto death, even so might
grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life.

3. It must be eternal death, else how, and when came mankind to be guilty of
eternal death; do the weak and wicked posterity of Adam by sinning now (when
by reason of their corrupt natures they hardly can do otherwise) deserve and
come under eternal death; and should Adams sin, which was against knowledge,
and a clear Law, have no other punishment but a natural and temporal death.

Further, how can death ( viz. eternal death, Romans 6.23.) be the wages of one
sin, and not of another? Romans 6.23


Ob. If Adam had not sinned, he was to enjoy but outward and temporal
mercies, therefore having sinned, his sin could bring him under (no other but
temporal and outward judgments.

A. Adam being the Lu 3.38.
Son of God, and after his own likeness, (doubtless) did enjoy, and was to
enjoy, had he not sinned, the savor and love of God, and communion with him;
which were more then mere temporal and outward mercies. On the contrary; the
loss of these (which are Ephesians. 5.6 Mat. 25.41
two of the greatest, and soarest judgments that the damned suffer for ever)
must needs be more then temporal, and outward judgments.

Q Did Adam by his sin and disobedience break the Covenant that was made
with Christ before?

A. No, for that Covenant was not given unto Adam before his fall, therefore he
could not break that which was not given him to observe.

Q. Was that Covenant which was made with Jesus Christ before time, afterward
made with men?

A. Yes, see Esa. 55.3. Jer. 31.31. and 33.20. Eze. 16.8 and 20.37. Heb. 8.10.

Q. Who made that Covenant with men?

A. God the Hos. 2.18
Father, Eze. 16.8.
Jesus Christ, and the Heb. 10.15, 16.
Spirit.

Q. When and with whom was that Covenant, (before made with Christ) first made?

A. With Genesis 3.15
Adam immediately after his sin, and disobedience.

Q. What was the sum of that Covenant, as it was then revealed unto Adam?

A. The sum of it was concerning Christ, being made flesh, and of what he
should do, and suffer in the flesh.

Q. How does that appear?

A. In these words, The seed of the Genesis 3.15
woman shall bruise the Serpents head, etc. The seed of the Ier. 31.22 Gal. 4.4.
woman, declares that he should be made flesh; it shall bruise thy head; that
imports he should destroy the Heb. 2.14 Mar. 1.24.
Devil, and his 1 Ioh. 3.8
works, and thou shall bruise his heel; that denotes, and holds forth the
death, and sufferings of Christ.

Q. How is Christ considered with relation to the Covenant of grace?

A. As the Author and Administer, as the Mediator, as joint party with
believers in it, and as the sum and substance of it.

Q. How does it appear that Christ was the Author and Administer of the
Covenant?

A. 1. He is called the Messenger of the Covenant (or (...) Mal. 3.1.
that Covenant) and the Esa. 63.9
Angel of Gods presence that represented his Fathers Majesty (who could not,
nor cannot be seen in Ioh. 1.18.
himself, nor in his Exo. 33.20, 21.
glory, neither 1 Ioh. 4.12.
ever was) but Christ as his Viceroy, and great Ambassador did manage on earth
(the whole business of the Covenant, and of men's salvation) which was before
contrived, and concluded upon in heaven.

2 In all or most of the places where there is mention either of making,
renewing, or confirming the Covenant of Grace with the Fathers before the Law,
or afterward under the Law, you will find, that it was Jesus Christ that did
act, indent, and do all with men. As for example, to begin with Abraham (the
father of the faithful) in Genesis 12.1, 2, 3. we read of the Lords first
appearing to Abraham, Gen: 12:1, 2, 3.
and his making the promise with him, Gen: 17:3 4, 5.
then in the 17 of Genesis the 3, 4, 5, etc. we have a second appearance of the
Lord to Abraham, and then the Covenant was much enlarged, and confirmed; again,
the same Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre, which by several
circumstances appears to be Christ, for he did eat with Abraham. ver. 8. and
this was no created Angel, as plainly appears in verse. 3.13, 17, 20, 26, 33.
In like manner he made the Covenant with Gen: 26:2, 3, 4, 5.
Isaac, Gen: 28:13.3-2:24.25:29, 30:
Jacob, Ex: 3:2, 4, 6, 7.-4:4, 5
Moses also he appeared to Jos. 5:13:14.
Joshua, Ex: 13:11-14.19.
Israel Iud: 6:12 13, 14, 16.
Gideon Iud: 13:15 to the end.
Manoah Gen: 16:7:18:-21.17, 18.
Hagar etc.

Obj. But this remains still dark and uncertain whether it were Jesus Christ
or no.

A. Consider but two other places, and you shall see evidently that it was
Christ, and no other, Jud. 2.1. And the Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal
to Bochim, and said, I (that is the Angel or Christ) made you to go up out of
Egypt and have brought you unto the Land which I swear unto your fathers. So
in. Esaias 63.9. And the i e. Christ vide Ex. 23 20, 21. Heb: 9:24
Angel of his presence, saved them, and in his love, and in his pity he
redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old: hence
it appears that this Angel could be no other; save Christ, for the Father, and
the Spirit are never so called in Scripture, and a created Angel had never
that dignity, and worship given him which was given that Angel.

Q. But was it Christ that did administer the Covenant to Adam?

A. It is probable, if not apparent, that it was Christ, that did deliver that
Promise (or Covenant Note that God did not speak those words in Gen: 3:15: to
Adam, but to the Serpent, vide, v: 14.
before Adam) if you consider Genesis 3.8. where it is said, that Adam and Eve heard
the voice of the Lord God, walking in the Garden, in the cool of the day. This
Lord God, was not God the father (for he never Heb. 11.27. See Diodate on Genesis
3.8 and Bern. on the word Lord.
appeared in any bodily shape) therefore sure it was Christ the son and word of
God, whose goings forth have been of old from Mic. 5.2.
everlasting.

Quest. What did Christ do, as the Mediator of the Covenant of grace?

A. He did The word (...) (Mediator) signifies one that interposes himself
legally between parties that are at variance to reconcile them, unus qui
intervenit vel interpouit, jure-jurando, vide Heb. 5
legally interpose and put himself 1 Timothy 2.5
between God and men, to mediate and intercede for them, and so Heb. 10 9
voluntarily became obedient to his fathers will, and by undergoing, bearing,
and suffering, the ps 88.16.
wrath, and Gal. 3.13
curse due to men for their sins, he took Ioh. 1.29.
away their sins Col. 1.21.
reconciled them to God, redeemed them from the Gal. 4.5.
Law, and delivered them from the 1 The. 1.10
wrath to come.

Q. Was Christ the Mediator of the Covenant of grace in all ages?

A. Yes sure, for there was but that Gal. 3.28
one true and real Mediator, who is said to be the Rev. 1.30
Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, and to be the same Heb. 13.8
yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

Ob. But was not Moses the Mediator of the Covenant of grace under the Law, and
before Christ came in the flesh?

A. Grant that Moses was a Mediator of the Covenant of grace, (though the
Scripture rather sets him forth a Gal. 3.19 Heb. 12.21
Mediator of the Law, and Covenant of works) yet he was but a Deuteronomy. 5.5 Exo
34.34 Heb. 3.2.
typical Mediator, and during his life, (as the Priests of the Law were) and
his mediation was only by way of Number. 14 19. Exodus 17.11.
entreaty and prayer, and not by way of merit and purchase.

Q. How could Christ be both the Author and the Mediator of the Covenant of
grace?

A. As God he was the Genesis 17 1, 2.
Author of the Covenant, but as Godman, or God Ioh. 1.14. Gal 4.4.
made man, the Heb. 8.6. 1 Timothy 2.5
Mediator of it, as God considered in himself, he was Lu. 15.21
offended, and willing to be Ez. 16.63
pacified toward men. But as God in our Heb. 10.5.9.
nature, he was making satisfaction to his own justice, and in the body of his
flesh Col. 1.22
reconciling us to himself. By his Godhead he Ioh. 17.19
sanctified, and Heb. 9.14
sacrificed his manhood, and by virtue of that sacrifice, believers are Heb.
10.10.
purged and sanctified from their sins.

Q. How is Jesus Christ joint party with believers in the Covenant of grace?

A. He is their Heb 7.22 (...) signifies one that of his own accord promises
and binds himself for another; and is as liable to bide the trial of the
law as the principal himself, and the word for surety in the Hebrew, (...)
signifies mingled, to show that the surety is as much engaged as the principal
himself.
surety bound to perform, and to see performed all the duties that God
requires, or believers promise to perform (or are engaged to perform) in and
with relation to the Covenant.

Ob. Though Christ be surety for believers, yet may not he suffer believers to
be arrested, and to answer for their own debt, as its usual for Sureties to
do.

A. Oh no, for when Christ first engaged, and bound himself for those (as I
may call them) poor bankrupts and beggarly friends of his, he knew, and
considered that the whole burden, would lie upon his back, and that he, and not
they should be arrested, for the debt: Therefore he takes the whole matter upon
himself, and ownes the debt as if he were the Principal, and not surety; and
he is contented that the Action and Suit, should be entered, (and that the full
force of the plea should be) against him only. Hereupon, Christ this 1 Pe. 2.22
innocent (yet engaged) and voluntary Defendant, is Esa. 53.8
arrested and brought to the Bar of Gods justice, where he is convicted,
adjudged, and Esa. 53.4 7, 10.
arraigned, as the 2 Cor. 5 21.
sinfullest Gal. 3.13
cursed'st, and most guilty (though the sinleast, and blessedst, and most
guiltless) man that ever lived. And having suffered the utmost rigor of the
Gal. 4.4. (...), i.e. he became under the law.
Law, and not one ace of justice abated him, nor a farthing of the debt
forgiven, no nor so much as one sin unaccounted, or blotted out, till Dan. 9.24
satisfaction was first given. But after a full account, and perfect payment,
and satisfaction, this Surety Christ, Ioh. 17.5.
pleads for a dismission, and discharge, and so gets a general Heb. 9.12
acquittance and releasment (under the King of heavens hand and Seal) for Phil
2.8, 9
himself, and his poor Is. 52.12.
friends.

Q. Were all the sins of Believers, as well sins of omission, as commission,
and sins after believing, as well as sins before believing, laia upon Christ's
score, and accounted for by him?

A. Yes, Jesus Christ did bear, and make satisfaction as well for the sins of
omission, as the sins of commission (as the Priest did Ex. 28.38
bear the iniquity of the holy things) and by offering up himself he Col.
2.13, 14.
removed all out of the way that was against men, and Heb. 10.14.
perfected for ever them that believe, so that To. 8.33.
nothing can be laid to their charge either of the evil done, or of the good
left undone, either Ac. 13.36
before or 1 Jo. 1.9. and 2.1, 2. Ps. 103.3.
since their believing.

Q How could Christ being but one, make satisfaction for the sins of so many as
are saved?

A. Though Christ was but one, yet he was such a one as was greater, and As it
was said to David 2 Samuel 18, 3. thou art worth ten thousand of us.
better than all, and therefore able, and sufficient to satisfy for all, and
to redeem all (as well as he made all.) And though the redemption of souls was
ps. 49.7, 8
dear, costly, and precious, yet the Act. 8, 33.
life and 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.
blood of such a one as Christ ( viz. the Son of God, yea Act. 20.28.
God himself) was of such an 1 Cor. 6.20
infinite value, and price, that it did surmount and surpass in dignity, and
worth, all the souls in the world, and his sufferings and merits were a
sufficient satisfaction, if intended and applied to that end, for to save so
many worlds of men, as of men in the world.

Q. How does it appear that Christ is the sum, and substance of the Covenant
of grace?

A. He is (as the Apostle says) Col. 3.11. i.e. The spring, fullness, cause
and rise of all man's happiness
all in all, and the whole Covenant is comprehended in him, therefore is he
called the Is. 42.6. and 49.9.
Covenant, and all the promises of the Covenant, they are but as so many lines
in the circumference, that meet as one in the Center, or as the veins of
Christ (this Covenant) that carry and conveigh his blood into all the members
and parts of his body (the Church.) For do but follow any promise, and it will

Star that did guide the Wisemen of the East) guide, and lead you to Christ,

consist.

Q Was it one and the same Covenant of grace, that was in force before the Law,
and under the Law, till the coming of Christ in the flesh?

A. Yes sure, it was ps. 105.8, 9 Mic: 7.10.
one and the same Covenant of grace, which God made with all men in all
generations, from Adam to Christ, for the promise made to Genesis 3.15
Adam, was renewed and established as a Covenant with Genesis 6.18
Noah, afterward with Genesis 12.3 15.1.
Abraham, Ge. 17.18
Isaac, Ps. 105.10
Jacob Ex. 6.4.6.
Moses, 2 cro, 21.7
David, and al their Genesis 9.9 17.17 with Gal. 3.16.29 To. 9.8
spiritual seed and posterity, the true Gal. 6.16
Israelites of God.

Objection, The Covenant that God made with Noah, seems not to be the Covenant
of grace, but a Covenant that he would not destroy the world again by water,
as he had done before?

A. God made and established two Covenants with Noah, the Gen: 6:6.
one before he went into the Arc, which was the Covenant of grace, (the Arc
it self being a true type of Christ, and a seal of that Covenant to him) the
Gen: 9:19
other a Covenant of outward preservation (as I may call it) which he made with
him, but with all Genesis 9:9 10.
mankind, and with every living creature. Gen: 9:12.6:
The sum of this Covenant was that he ( i.e. God) would never destroy the
earth with the flood again, and for a seal of this Covenant, he put a Bow
(commonly called the Rainbow) in the clouds, to assure all men that he will
perform that Covenant.

Ob. But we read little or nothing at all, of such a Covenant of Grace, between
the time of Adam and Abraham.

A. Suppose we did not read of the Covenant of grace between Adam and Abraham
(though I have already proved, that the Covenant of grace was made with Noah)
yet you have heard that the covenant of grace was in force, and being before,
between God the Father and Christ, and between Christ and Adam. And doubtless
though the Covenant be somewhat concealed, yet it cannot be imagined, that
(from the time of Adam til the time of the making of the Covenant with Abraham
(which was above 208^. years as Mr. Lightfo^t computes.
two thousand years) the Called Gods sons Genesis 6.2. It is thought also that
the Hebrews, or the posterity of Heber did worship the true God once and
afterward fell to Idolatry compare Gen 11.19 and 32.5. with Josh. 212.
godly in those many ages and generations were under no Covenant of grace. Also
its more then probable, that Abel, Enoch, and others (that were righteous, and
that did Heb. 11.4, 5.
offer sacrifices unto God) did apprehend the Covenant of grace, and eye Christ
through their sacrifices, and believe in him for justification and salvation.

Ob. But its very strange, that there should not be clearer footsteps of the
Covenant of grace, in those two thousand years.

A. No, it is not strange, for God spoke at sundry times, and in Heb. 1.1. As
by voice Deuteronomy. 1.6. by visiau, Psalm. 89.19 by dreams Number. 12.6 by Angels, 2
King 1.3 by (...) and Thum^^ins, Number. 27.21. by Prophets, Luke 1.70.
diverse manners unto our Fathers, and we have but little recorded thereof in
the Scriptures, especially before the flood. As concerning the sanctifying of
the Sabbath, concerning the manner of offering sacrifices, concerning
marriages, etc. which things were instituted by God from the beginning, though
not written. Moreover, note this, that God does Eze. 16.8 Psalm. 50.5
own none for his people, but those that are in Either virtually or actually
Covenant with him.

Q. How many Covenants did God make with Abraham?

A. God made but Lev. 26 42. luke 1.71, 72. Act. 3.25. Genesis 12.2.
one Covenant with Abraham, though he Genesis 15.18. and 17 2.
renewed it several times with him.

Ob. But did not God make two Covenants with Abraham, the one a spiritual, and
the other a temporal, the one spoken off in the 12 of Genesis, and the other
in the 17. of Genesis.

A. No, they are not two Covenants, but one Covenant, containing two parts, as
a Deed, or Covenant among men, that may hold forth and promise both a real and
personal estate; for Genesis 12.2 with Genesis 17.2. and chap. 12.3. with chapter 17 5.
and chapter 17.8. with chapter 12.1.
compare both Chapters together, and you shall find that God promises the
same things in both.

Ob. But are there not two Covenants held forth in the 17. Chapter, the one in
the second verse, the other in the 7. verse.

A. No, for in the second verse God says, he will make his Covenant, and in
the seventh verse, God says, he will establish his Covenant, this strongly
affirms that it was but one and the same Covenant; and so does that text in
Psalm the 105.8, 9, 10 convincingly, Psalm. 105.8, 9, 10.
satisfyingly, and undeniably prove.

Ob. Yet it seems that the Israelites were under two Covenants, as appears by
Romans 9.4. and Ephesians. 2.12.

A. 1. The word Covenant is not always to be understood in a proper and strict
sense for the matter of the Covenant, or for the things promised in the
Covenant; but sometimes it is taken figuratively, for the seal of the Covenant,
and so Circumcision which was but the seal of the Covenant, is called the
Covenant it self, Genesis 17.7. Act. 7.8.

2. By the two Covenants there, may be meant the Covenant of grace and the
Covenant of works, or the promise, and the Law, both which were given to the
Jews, and are called by the Apostle, the Gal. 4.24
two Covenants; or,

3. As some others understand by the Covenants in those places cited, may be
meant the Law of God, and the Tables thereof, called the Den. 9.11
Tables of the Covenant.

Ob. But these Covenants are called the Covenants of promise, and therefore the
Law cannot be included therein.

A. You heard before, that the Law was a Covenant, and that it does promise
life upon the keeping of it, is Lev. 18.5 Romans 10.5
evident; but more of this afterward.

Q. How did God make that Covenant with Abraham, and how was Abraham considered
in that Covenant?

A. 1. God made the Covenant with Abraham, as he was a Genesis 17.4 To. 4.17 18.
public person, and the father of two sorts of people, to wit, Romans 4.11, 12,
16.
all believers, both Jews and Gentiles, and all his Genesis 21.13. Mat. 3.9.
natural progeny and posterity, called 1 Cor. 10 18.
Israel after the flesh.

2. The Covenant was made with Abraham as a Genesis 15.2 Romans 4.3.
particular believer (and so it is with every other believer) and Abraham
himself did partake of the blessing and benefit of the Covenant, rather as a
private believer, then as a public person; yet he had a higher favor, and
greater honor showed him, to be chosen of God to be a public Trustee, and
father of Orphane believers; but yet believers are not to look upon the
Covenant made with him as (...)
Abram (high-father) but as Abraham, or (...)
Abrahamon a high-father, of a multitude of Nations.

Q. What were the promises and things contained in that Covenant, which God
made with Abraham?

A. They were either spiritual or temporal promises and things, and did
belong either to Abraham and his spiritual seed, or to Abraham and his
natural (or carnal) seed.

Q. Who are meant by the spiritual seed of Abraham?

A. Gal. 3.16
Jesus Christ, and all those that are Gal. 3.29
Christ's, ( sci. that are in him, and belong to him) which are the Romans 4.11
16. luke 1.55.
faithful and godly in all Psalm. 105 8. luke 1.48.
Generations, and Gal. 3.28 To. 4.17. Act. 3.25. luke 19.9. - 13.16.
Nations.

Q. Why is Jesus Christ called the seed of Abraham?

A. Partly because he took upon him the Heb. 2.16
nature of the seed of Abraham; but especially because he came from Abraham, as
concerning the flesh, and is therefore called the Mat. 1.1.
son of Abraham.

Q What were those things that God did promise to Abraham, and to his
spiritual seed?

A. That he would be a Genesis 17.7
God unto him, and unto his spiritual seed, and that in him, and in that Genesis
22.18.
seed, all the Nations of the earth should be Genesis 12.3
blessed.

Q. But who do you mean by that seed in whom all the Nations of the earth
should be blessed?

A. Ps. 72.17. Ephesians. 1.3. Gal. 3.14.
Jesus Christ, of whom Isaac was a type.

Q. Who were the natural, and carnal seed of Abraham?

A. Genesis 21.13.
Ishmael (the son of Hagar the Egyptian, and bondwoman) and his wicked
posterity Psa. 83.6
called Ishmaelites, also the Joh. 8.33.37. Act. 7.6.
Jews in general, were the natural seed of Abraham.

Ob. But was not Isaac the natural son of Abraham also?

A. Yes, Isaac was a natural, (though ingendered rather in a Genesis 17.17. and
18, 11, 12, 13.
miraculous, then in a natural way) and a spiritual son of Abraham also.

Q. What were those temporal promises which God promised to Abraham, and to
his natural seed in that Covenant?

A. That he ( i.e. God) would Genesis 17 2. and 16.10
multiply him and his seed exceedingly, and Genesis 13.17. and 17.8
give unto him, and his seed the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession.

Q. What difference was there between the spiritual and carnal seed of
Abraham?

A. Very great difference, for the Gal. 4.18
one was called the children of promise, the Romans 4.13.
other the seed of Abraham through the Law; the Gal. 4.30
one the children of the freewoman, (or heavenly Jerusalem) the Gal. 4.41
other the children of the bondwoman, (or earthly Jerusalem) the Gal. 3.26
one the children of God, and the Joh. 8.44
other the children of the Devil.

Q But was not the whole Nation of the Jews the people of God, and in Covenant
with him?

A. Yes, the whole Nation of the Jews was Exo. 3.7.10-5.1.
called, and accounted the people of God, (because God Deu 7.6. and 14.2.
chose them above all people of the earth to be his peculiar people, and they
professed him, and his worship more then all other people) also Psalm. 106.45.
and 111.9
all of them were in the Covenant, either truly, and really, or out wardly,
and professedly.

Ob. But were not all the Jews the true people of God, why else are they so
often in Scripture called holy, and a holy people?

A. Joh. 8.44 47. Romans 9.6.8.
All the Jews were not the true people of God ( sci. his Saints and children)
and they were called holy, either from the As Believers are called holy, not
because they are perfectly so, but because holiness which is the best part of
them, gives them that denomination.
better part of them that were holy indeed; or in opposition to the Gentiles,
who were counted Ez. 21.25. and 44.23
profane, or else because of Gods Ez. 22.8.
holy Ordinances that were among them.

Q How did God confirm to Abraham the Covenant which he made with him?

A. Partly by his Heb. 6 17 luke 1.73.
oath, and partly by the Genesis 17.7
sign of Circumcision.

Q. Why did God confirm the Covenant with his oath?

A. To show the Psalm. 89.34, 35. Esa. 54.9, 10.
immutable and irreversible certainty of the Covenant; and to Esa. 45.23. Heb.
6.17.
extinguish and eject all doubts and unbelief, that might arise in believers
to hinder their joy.

Ob. How could God, and did God swear?

A. He could not swear by any other, (much less a greater) then himself; and
therefore he Genesis 22.16. Amo. 8.7.
swear by himself.

Ob. What was Gods usual form in swearing?

A. The usual form that God used in swearing, was in these words, as Ez.
17.19 Zeph. 2.9.
I live, and Heb. 6.14.
surely: noting that he swear by his very being and faithfulness; also
sometimes he swear by his Am. 8.7.
Excellency, and sometimes by his Ps. 89.35
Holiness.

Q. Was Circumcision a seal of the Covenant of grace which God made with
Abraham?

A. We find very good reason in Scripture to believe so, as in Genesis 17.8. it
is called a token, Genesis 17.8. Romans 4.11
or sign of the Covenant; and in Romans 4.11. a seal of the righteousness of
faith ( i.e. the Covenant of grace that promises justification by faith.) Also
that Jesus Christ was a Romans 15 8.
Minister of the Circumcision, for the truth of God, to confirm the promises
unto the Fathers, meaning the truth of God by the Covenant of Truth (or the
Gal. 3.1. Tit. 1.1
Gospel as Paul calls it, or Gospel Covenant) which God had made with the
Fathers, viz. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: Now Christ is said to be a Minister of
that Covenant (which is called Circumcision by a figure) and to declare and
fulfill that Covenant, whereof Circumcision was a seal.

Ob. But the word (...) a seal, signifies but an exemplary note, and a badge of
honor, and circumcision was given to Abraham, only for that end, and not to
confirm the Covenant.

A. The word (...) signifies a Seal, and obsignation, (or such a Seal as does
confirm) and so it is taken in all, or most places, where it is mentioned in
the New Testament as 1 Cor. 9.2. and 2 Cor. 1.22. 2 Timothy 2.19. Rev. 7.2.4. (...)
So also is the Hebrew word Chotam, which the Lxx. Interpreters translate often
(...) a seal, and (...) a sign.

Ob. But if it were a sign, and a Seal, yet it confirmed but Abraham's own
faith.

A. The Lord says in that 17 of Genesis (concerning Circumcision, when he did
first institute it) that it should be a sign between him, and them (or Genesis
17.11.
between me, and you, says God.) And so the Apostle calls it the sign of
Circumcision, a To. 4.11.
Seal of the righteousness of Faith (not of his faith only) which clearly
holds forth that it was a sign and seal of the Covenant to all those with
whom the Covenant was made, and to whom it did belong, as well as unto Abraham.

Ob. Well grant it to be a sign and seal of the Covenant; yet it was but a sign
and seal of temporal things, as the land of Canaan.

A. I have showed before that God made but one Covenant with Abraham (though it
had several parts) and that the land of Canaan, and other temporal things,
that were promised, they were but the external parts of that Covenant. Now if
Circumcision had been only a seal of the land of Canaan, then what need it
to have continued so long after they came to enjoy the Land? And if it sealed
only temporal things, then God gave them a more visible security of those
temporal things, then he did of spiritual things. Nay, if Circumcision was
not a sign and seal of the Covenant of grace, then sure it had no outward
sign, or visible seal to it, before the coming of Christ.

Ob. Circumcision did bind men to keep the whole Law, Gal. 5.3. and therefore
sure it was a seal of a legali Covenant, and not of the Covenant of grace.

A. 1. Circumcision was not of Moses, but of the Fathers, Joh. 7.22.
says Christ, and given four hundred and thirty years before the Law, or
Covenant of works, therefore it could not be a seal of that Covenant, and of
another legal Covenant (unless it be that made with Adam) the Scripture
speaks not, as I apprehend.

2 The Apostles meaning in those words, Gal. 5.3. ( whosoever is circumcised is
a debtor to the whole Law, or bound to keep the whole Law) is this, that those
that would observe circumcision (which was part of the Ceremonial Law, and not
of the moral) they were tied to observe the whole Ceremonial law, and this in
effect, was to deny Christ to be come in the flesh. Again, suppose by the Law
here he meant the Moral Law, yet it does not follow that Circumcision was part
of that law, Luther says that the meaning is this, that whosoever was
circumcised did not perform any part of the law.
for what Paul spoke here of circumcision, he might have spoken of the whole
Levitical Priesthood, and said thus, you Jews that do observe the Priesthood
of the Law (now the everlasting Priesthood of Christ being set up, and the
other taken away) you do as good as renounce Christ, and seek to be justified
by the Law, therefore I tell you, that you are bound to keep all the Law, or
else you cannot be justified thereby.

Q. What was the intent of God in giving Circumcision?

A. It was for to assure them that were circumcised, that God was their God in
Genesis 17 13
Covenant, and that he would perform what he had promised. Also it was to put
the circumcised in mind of Verse. 14
performing, and observing the Covenant, and Commandments of God, though not
to be justified thereby, yet to certify that they were a chosen, and elect
people, and in Covenant with God.

Obj. Now you grant that circumcision did bind the circumcised to keep the
whole Law.

A. Yes, it did bind them, to keep the whole law; but not to that end, which
the false, and judaizing Apostle did urge it for. (namely, to be justified
thereby) Circumcision did bind the Jews, before Christ came in the flesh, and
dyed, to keep the Law, as Baptism does bind believers since Christ, to observe
the commandments of the Gospel (by Romans 6.4
living in newness of life) but neither to justify them or us, but for to
show our obedience to God. And as now it would be unreasonable, abusive, (and
contrary to the first institution) to urge baptism as necessary to
justification and salvation, so it was then, to Act. 15.1.24.
urge circumcision, as necessary to justification and salvation.

Obj. Circumcision was an intolerable Yoke, and burden to the Jews and their
forefathers, therefore it could not be a seal of the righteousness of faith
or of the Covenant of grace.

A. It is true that circumcision was a Act. 15.10.24.
yoke, and burden to the Jews, and their forefathers, so was also the whole
Gal. 5.1. and 4.3. Ephesians. 2.15.
Ceremonial Law, which Paul does slight, and subvert as much as circumcision,
by calling it Col. 2.20.
worldly Rudiments, and Heb. 9.10.
carnal Ordinances. Yet it cannot be denied, but that the Ceremonial Law was
Gospel, and part of the Covenant of grace (at least an appendix to it during
that administration) and were Heb. 9.9.23. (...) antitypes or copies.
figures, Heb. 10.1-8.5.
shadows, and significant Ordinances, teaching, and holding out Christ, and
his benefits for men's justification, and salvation.

Obj. If Circumcision had been a sign or seal of the Covenant of grace, it
would still have remained, and not have been taken away.

Answ. It did remain during the Heb. 9.9.
legal administration, and until the Heb. 9.10
time of Reformation, but there was no necessity, that it, or any other
Ceremony should survive or outlive, its time appointed (to wit, the Col. 2.14,
15.
death or resurrection of Christ.) And seeing Christ did take a To. 9.29. Ephesians.
2.13.
new people ( viz. the Gentiles) into the Covenant, he thought it fittest, to
institute new Ordinances, and to apply new seals. And therefore Joh. 1.33 Mat
28.19 2 Cor. 11.25 26.
Baptism and the Lords Supper are both of them by Christ's own institution,
set up (and appointed to be observed by believers) instead of Col. 2.12.
Circumcision, and the 1 cor. 5.7.
Passover.

Obj. If Circumcision be a Ceremony, then it must signify somewhat that is
substantial, what was it then that circumcision did signify?

A. 1. Circumcision did signify, and was a figure of Christ, for. I
Circumcision did Ephesians. 2.11
distinguish between the people of God and others, so 1 Cor. 4.7. Gal. 3.29.
does Christ. 2. Again, circumcision was tied to Abraham's Genesis 17.12
seed (or those bought by him, and joined to him) to show that Christ was to be
born of his Gal. 3.25, 26.
seed, and not of the uncircumcised. 3. In circumcision there was Ex. 4.26.
shedding of blood, which signified the shedding of Christ's blood. Lastly, By
circumcision, the people came to be Ex. 12.44
accounted clean, and so to have a right to the Passover, even so by Christ's
blood believers are made 1 John 1, 7 Heb. 10.10 with 9.13.
clean and have a right to Joh. 6.54. Ephesians. 1.11, -- 2.18. Heb. 10.19.
pass from earth to heaven.

2. Circumcision in the flesh, did signify the Deu. 30.6 To. 2.29.
circumcision of the heart, which is called the Col. 2.11.
circumcision of Christ, because it is he that does circumcise the heart, by
cutting off, and Esa. 4.4. Ion. 15.2.
purging out, the superfluity and corruption thereof.

Q. What manner of Covenant, was that which God made with Abraham and his seed
(called the Covenant of grace) whereof circumcision was a sign and seal?

A. It was a free, full, wel-ordered, sure peaceable, holy and everlasting
Covenant.

Q. Why do you call it a free Covenant?

A. First, Because the foundation of it was Ier. 31.3. Cant. 3.10
free-love (and proceeded from Mic. 7.20
mere mercy and grace) for there was nothing either in Abraham himself, or in
any of Abraham's seed (Christ excepted) that deserved such love, grace, and
favor at the hand of God.

For when God made this Covenant first with Abraham, he was both an Jos. 24.2.
Idolater himself, and also the son of an Idolater. And why should it be made
with Isaacrather then with Ishmael? or what was Jacob better then Esau, or
wherein was the people of the Jews to be preferred before other people, that
he should enter into Covenant with them, God himself shows the reason
thereof, that it was because he Romans 9.13. Deuteronomy. 7 7, 8.
freely loved them, and because it was his pleasure so to do.

Ob. But Abraham was a Believer, and circumcised, and so were Isaac, Jacob, and
the Israelites, and therefore more worthy, and deserving then others.

A. Abraham (as I said before) was an Idolater, and dwelling in Act. 7.1.2
Caldea, a land full of Ezekiel. 23.14.
Idolaters, Diviners, Dan. 2.2 and 4.7.
South sayers, Sorcerers, Job 1.17
Robbers, and Spoylers, (yea the most Hab. 1.6, 7
vile, hasty, bitter, persecuting'st, and prophanest Nation in the world.) Yet
God out of such an ungodly generation, and race, cho oses, and Esa. 51.2
calls out Abraham, blesses him, and enters into Covenant with him, whilst he
was yet Rom 4.10.
uncircumcised. And was not Jacob, Esau Mal. 1.2.
his brother, begotten and born of the same father, and mother, and at the same
time? And were not the Jews Ezekiel. 16 6, 7, 8.
polluted in their blood, naked, bare, filthy, unsavory, and unlovely? when
the Lord looked upon them, and entered into Covenant with them.

Secondly, It may be called a free Covenant, a (...) Veethenah ber thy, they
are very significant, Ethenah from nathan dare, and berith from barah eligit.
because its given unto those that partake of it, Genesis 17.2. the words I will
make my Covenant, are in the Hebrew, I will give my Covenant; God says (as it
were) thus to Abraham; Abraham, I have chosen thee, and thy seed (and that
only out of my free love, and not out of any merit, or demerit in thee) and I
will enter into a Covenant of grace with thee: yea God to assure the Gentiles,
that it was as free unto them, as unto Abraham, and the believing Jews, he
says twice in one Esa 42.6-49.8.
Prophecy, that he will give Christ for a Covenant, (or Christ the Covenant)
unto them.

Thirdly, because there is no condition required of men (when God enters into
Covenant with them) but what he gives with, and through the Covenant unto them:
for were there any previous, precedent condition, required of men (as from men,
and not given of God) it could not be free. For if one man did give to another
man, but one pound for an estate which is worth a thousand pound, it cannot be
said that this estate is altogether given, for there is some (though an
invaluable) confideration given for, and toward it. In like manner, were man
tied to give to (or bring to) God any thing as a condition, and consideration
of the Covenant, it could not be altogether free, nor properly called a
Covenant of grace.

Ob. But is not faith the condition of the Covenant of grace?

A. If faith be a Indeed faith is mentioned after the form, and manner of a
condition, but in truth, it is the gift of God, as well as life eternal.
Perkins on Gal. p. 157
condition of the Covenant of grace, yet it is such a condition, as is promised
in the Covenant, and freely given by God; and therefore not in man, nor
expected from man, till first bestowed on man, and wrought in man, by God
himself. And therefore God when he enters into Covenant with men, does not
come unto them, and say, men, I am come unto you, and I am willing to make a
Covenant with you, if you do believe, then I will be your God, and you shall
be my people by Covenant: but he speaks absolutely, positively, and without any
condition Ier. 31.33, 34.
I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and
will be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will forgive their
iniquity, and remember their sin no more: Mark, here is no condition at all;
but every word free, and absolute.

Ob. Nay Sir, There is no doubt to be made of it, but that faith is a condition
of the Covenant of grace, for there is nothing more ordinary in Scripture
(especially the New Testament) then to make faith or believing, a condition of
Justification and Salvation, as Act. 13.39. he that believes is justified from
all things: and John 3.36. He that believes on the Son, has everlasting life.
So that sure, faith is the condition of the Covenant of grace, and there is no
other condition.

A. 1. It is true (and it is not denied, but) that faith is necessary to
Salvation, and likewise to Justification in a sense (which 1 intend afterward
to treat of) yea I affirm (as the Scriptures prove at large) that no unbeleever
shall be saved. But that is not the question, but the question is, whether man
must have faith in him, before God enters into Covenant with him; or whether
unbelief excludes and bars God, from making the Covenant with those that he
intends to make it with.

2. Whereas you say that faith is the only condition of the Covenant, consider
seriously, whether the Gospel does not require Joh. 17.3 2 These. 1.8
knowledge, Lu. 13.3.5
repentance, Joh. 3.35. Mar. 18.3.
conversion, Heb. 12.14.
sanctification, etc. to be in those that are saved: If so, then I know no
reason but that these may be called conditions of the Covenant, as well as
faith. But sure neither these, nor faith, are found in men, when God comes to
enter Covenant with them: but they are brought with the Covenant, yea they are
Ezekiel. 34 25, 30, 31. Heb 8.11. Ezekiel. 36.25, 26.
particular members and branches of the Covenant, and therefore cannot be
before the Covenant.

Ob. But is it not Gods part to propound, and offer the Covenant unto men, and
men's part to receive, and accept of the Covenant, being offered, and tendered
unto them by God?

A. It is Gods part, not only to propound, and to offer the Covenant, but it
is his part also, (yea his Ez. 20.37
promise) to bring men into the bonds of the Covenant; and to work a Psa.
110.3 Phil. 2.13.
willingness, and Es. 40.29 Joh. 1.12.
ability in men, to receive what he offers, and gives, to Mat. 12.21. Phil.
1.29.
believe what he promises, and to To. 15.18
obey what he commands.

Ob. Hereby you free the creature, from doing any thing at all, and you lay the
whole work upon God, and so man by this, may sit still, and do nothing.

A. Although God Esa. 30.7
says in another case of men, it is their strength to sit still (for before
God puts forth himself to work on, and in men, they can do nothing) yet this
does not exclude men at all from doing. But it shows that at Gods first entering
into Covenant with men, they are mere passives, having no condition at all in
them; yet when God has taken a man into Covenant, with himself, and sown his
own seed in the field of man's heart, and so sprung up light, life, and faith
in the soul, then the soul is to say (as Christ said) My Father works
hitherto, and I work; or as the Apostle said, We are co-workers together with
him: yet herein, we must also know that it is not enough for God to tune the
Instrument of the soul, but he must also play thereon himself (otherwise the
Music cannot be melodious) I mean, it is not enough for God to give (as they
are termed the habits of grace, or to work grace at first in men's hearts,)
but he must also incite, exercise and act, those infused or created habits. And
therefore its said to be an act of Gods Phil. 2.13
good pleasure, and an act of his Ephesians. 1.19-3.20. Col. 1.11.
power, to quicken, put forth, increase, and act that grace he has wrought in
his Saints.

Ob. I grant that faith is the gift of God (and that man cannot believe of
himself) but then God must give it to men before he enters into Covenant with
them, that so they may have it as a hand to take hold upon the Covenant.

A. Faith is not given before the Covenant, but in, with, and through the
Covenant. And the Author of faith (which Heb. 12.2
is Christ) must be present in the soul, either before, or at the first
minute, and instant of believing, for its impossible that the effect should be
before the cause (as light before the Sun, or heat before the fire, or the
fruit of the tree before the tree it self. Faith therefore being a beam ray of
Christ, the Son of righteousness, and a Gal. 5.2
fruit of the Spirit of Christ, it cannot possibly be in the soul before
Christ's spiritual presence. Christ first lays himself a foundation, and
lays, then (or builds) men upon that foundation, Mat. 18.16
So then its Christ in us, that brings us to Christ out of us, or the Spirit of
Christ, leads a sinful soul to the person, merits, and righteousness of
Christ.

Ob. If the Covenant be altogether free, then has not Christ purchased a right
for men to the Covenant, and so his merits is no ground of the Covenant.

A. Though it be altogether free in respect of men, yet (as you heard before)
it was founded upon Christ and his merits, yea doubtless all the Gal. 4.5.
Ephesians. 1.5-2.14.
mercies, and legacies of the Covenant, were really purchased by him (yea 2
Pet. 1.1
faith it self which you call the condition of the Covenant.) And though God
the Father was inclinable, and propense to be at peace with, and to be
reconciled unto men, yet his Justice put a bar to his Mercy, till it had a
promise of satisfaction from Christ (yea till it was satisfied by him.) For
though there was love in God to men from eternity, (which cannot be said to be
purchased by Christ, for this is not properly, and strictly, a legacy of the
Covenant, but rather the first, and efficient cause thereof) yet this love lay
hid so in the bosom of God, that Christ brought it to light, and gained us the
enjoyment and possession of it.

Fourthly, this Covenant appears to be free, by the persons that are taken
into it, and by the time, they are taken into it.

1. As for the persons, commonly, they are the 1 Cor. 1.27, 28.
foolishest, Jam. 1.5.
meanest, worst, vilest, and wretchedst that God does choose to enter into
Covenant with; witness the 1 Cor. 6.9 1.1.
profane Corinthians, the Act. 19.27.35. Ephesians. 2.11.
Idolatrous Ephesians, the Act 17.22
superstitious Athenians, the Mat. 10.3 Luke 19.2. Mat. 21 31 32.
scandalous and ungodly Publicans; and the Joh. 4.8.39 and 8.3.4.11. Luke 82.
Heb. 11 31. luke 15 13.30.
abominable and filthy harlots, whoremongers, and the like.

2. Then secondly, for the time, God enters into Covenant with them; Is it not
even them? when they are highest and vilest in sin; as for example; Paul in the
Act. 9.2.3
height, and heat of his persecution, (when he was even Act. 26.11
desperately mad, raging, raving, and hastily running to hale and drag the
Saints into prison) also the scurrilous scoffing Jews at that Act. 2.13 37.
instant, were taken into Covenant; the Thief (or (...) a praeda vel (...)
latca, he was one that lay hid for the prey.
highway Robber) even at the last hour, l lu. 23.43
when he could not serve nor glorify God so much as one day or hour on earth;
yea the whorish woman, when but newly taken in the Act of Adultery, was Ioh.
8.4.9, 10, 11.
pitied and tendered by Christ. These and many other examples verify that Ez.
16.8
Scripture, where God says, when they were in their filthiness and
nakedness, he swear unto them, and entered into a Covenant with them, and they
became his. But to come to the second property of the Covenant.

Secondly, It is a full, and complete Covenant, 1 Timothy 6 17.
riehly, and plentifully stored with all suitable promises, both for 1 Timothy 4.8
this life, and that which is to come; (like that Psalm. 65.9
River of God which is said to be full of water, or the Ps. 104.24
earth full of Gods riches) There is in God, and in his Covenant Romans 2.4
riches of goodness to pardon, and pass by men's sinfulness; Ephesians. 1.7
riches of grace to cover men's nakedness, and shamefulnesse; and Romans 9.23;
Ephesians. 3.16.
riches of glory to satisfy men's souls for ever. Note this, That a soul
cannot not want the good thing, but it is in Christ, and the Covenant, nor
seek the good thing either for soul or body, but it is promised in the
Covenant. For the Lords promises are altogether as The number of the promises
(by Mr. Leighs computation) are about 1540. and there be many more.
large as his commands (and larger then his threatenings) therefore soul, thou
can not be in that condition, (whether thou be Ps. 84.11 Phil. 4.19.
a Saint, or a Sinner,) but there is somewhat in the Covenant, which suits with
that condition, and tends to answer, relieve, and redress thee, be it for
soul, body, or both.

Thirdly, It is an 1 Samuel 23.5.
ordered (or well-ordered) Covenant.

1. In respect of the persons with whom it is made, as first and primarily with
Christ, then with men, as you heard before.

Secondly, In respect of the promises, and parts of the Covenant; as first,
Jer. 32.38
God becomes our God, and then makes us his people, and afterward Ezekiel. 16 8,
9.
washes, and sanctifies us from our sins.

Thirdly, In respect of manifestation, God first reveals it by his 2 Timothy 1.10
Psa. 111.9
outward Ministry, then afterward 2 Cor. 1.22. Ephesians. 1.13.
reveals, seals, and assures it, to men's souls by his Spirit.

Fourthly, In respect of the ends of the Covenant; for first, and chiefly, God
aims at his own, and at his Son his glory, and next at the happiness, and
salvation of his people, and in these senses, it may be called an ordered, or
well-ordered Covenant.

Fourthly, It is a 2 Samuel 23.5.
sure and firm Covenant (yea Esa. 55.3 Act. 13.34
all, and every of the mercies thereof are sure,) and therefore called the sure
mercies of David, or of the beloved (as the original signifies) yea as the
proverb is, As sure as a Rock, for its builded and founded upon that Esa.
26.4. marg.
rock of ages, Jesus Christ. This Covenant of God is like, (yea far more
certain then) the Laws of the Medes, and Persians, which were unchangeable
and unalterable. Mark how Ps. 89.34
God speaks, My Covenant (says he) will I not break, nor alter the thing
that is gone out of my lips.

Obj. This Promise was made unto David, who was a strong believer, and a man
after Gods own beart, but is it so sure to every ordinary believer, as it was
to him?

A. Yes sure, mark the words of the Apostle, Romans 4.16. To. 4.16.
Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end that the promise
might be sure to all the seed. As well Gentiles as Jews, as well the weak, as
the strong seed of Abraham, as well the sinfulest as the holiest of his seed.

Obj. Oh but David was a very zealous, religious, and upright man, and not such
a great sinner as I am.

A. 1. Believe this, that thou art as near, and as dear to God as David was,
even as Joseph and Benjamin, the youngest sons were, as Genesis 37.3 4.-44.29.
greatly (yea more) beloved by Jacob then Reuben the eldest: and thou Gospel
believer, art one of beautiful Rachels children, I mean the Church of the New
Testament: Christ takes the first and chiefest care of his lambs (or those that
are weak) Joh. 21.15. This is to be understood of the visible Church.
and David was but a son of bleer-eyed- Leah the Church of the Jews and did
not Christ Mat. 11.11
say, That he that was least in the Kingdom of heaven (or in the Church of the
new Testament) was greater then John the Baptist.

2. If thou art a greater sinner then David, then thou art deerer to Christ
then David, for he paid more for thee, then for him. As Genesis 29 30.
Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah because he obeyed, suffered, and endured
most for her. And as the Prodigalls father Lu. 15.13 23, 24, 30, 32.
rejoiced most in his lost and dead son, though he had spent his own, and his
fathers substance with Harlots: even so thou, who art the greatest sinner, and
did cost Christ most, art sure become dearest to him. An excellent example
there is for this in Jer. 31.20
Jeremy, Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? Or it may be read
thus, Ephraim my dear son, he is a pleasant child: for since I spoke against
him, I do earnestly remember him still, therefore my bowels sound for him, and
what follows? I will surely have mercy upon him, says the Lord, Mark here!
how dear, and delightful affections, are joined with tender and merciful
compassions, set forth in sweet, working, soule-ravishing, and heart-melting
expressions. And all to a people that had committed Idolatry against the Lord,
yea, and but little before God spoke these words unto them, they had Hos. 5.13
departed and revolted from the Lord to put confidence in man, yea, they were
guilty at this time, and did lie under many Hos.
4.17-5.3.-6.8.-11.12-12.14.-13.12,
great fins, as Idolatry, backsliding, unbeleife, luke-warmenesse; and for God
to speak at such a time, to such a people, in such a manner, what to call an
Idolater his son, a Back-slider his dear son, a diffident distrustful
unbeleever, his pleasant child; oh! let such a love be admired, such mercy
publicly proclaimed, such expressions for ever recorded and remembered, such a
Covenant embraced, and hugged, and such carriage, and kindness constantly
thought on, and minded, and ought not such a Lord, and Father, to be dearly
daily, and sincerely loved and affected, and to be cheerfully, duly, and
dutifully obeyed, and honored, and his words and will, steadfastly, and firmly
believed, and observed for ever.

Obj. But here we find Ephraims repentance, v. 18.
as well as his sin, were it so with me I should not doubt of Gods promise.

A. It is very true, after the Lord had so bemoaned, and pitied Ephraim, and
made such gracious promises to him, he did repent; but you do not find Ephraim
repenting first, See the chapter throghout.
but God (though offended) he comes and bewailes Ephraims condition, and so by
his loving speeches and lovely behavior, winnes and works Ephraim, to
acknowledge his sin, and shame, as Ephraim himself confesses; After that I
was turned, I repented, and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh:
Mark here, Ephraims work is an after work, like Peter's weeping, after Christ
had graciously looked upon him.

Ob. Oh but Ephraim, and Peter, had faith before, but I find my unbelief
soigreat, that I fear it will so provoke God as to make him withold from me
what he promises in his Covenant.

A. 1. Do you think that your Romans 3.3
unbelief, can make, or shall make, the faith of God, ( i.e. the So the word
(...) is taken, Mat. 23.23. Tit. 2.10.
fidelity, or Gal. 1.23-3.2.
word of God) of none effect? No sure, God Mal. 3.6
gives this reason why he does not break his Covenant, and utterly destroy
and consume men. For I (says God) change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are
not consumed: But,

Secondly, I tell you, (and charge you from God to believe it) that though you
find your self unbeleeving, yet you are not to question the truth, and
accomplishment of Gods promises, for they are sure, (and not grounded upon your
faith, but upon his own grace, and his Son his merits) and therefore says the
2 Timothy 3.12.
Apostle, though we believe not, yet be remains faithful, he cannot deny
himself.

Thirdly, You may be mistaken in your self, and think you do not believe
when you do believe; and herein you may err upon one hand, as the carnal man
does on the other; for he thinks he does believe, when he does not believe, and
you think you do not believe, when you do believe. As a Cheater would put off
his brass for gold; so an honest man may suspect his own gold to be brass;
therefore do not say, I have no faith, because I have fear, for there may be
(not only true, but) great faith where there is Luke 8.47 48.
fear, and i. e. At Gods presence, and glory and a man's own vileness and
debility. Esa. 6.5 Job 40 4.
trembling; and it is a sure sign of faith to see your own Mar. 9.24.
unbeleef, and Luke 7.7
unworthiness.

Fourthly, Consider whether you do not sin against God, and wrong your own
soul, by such unbeleeving words. For if you do believe, and say you do not,
then do you deny the work of God in you, and lie against the Spirit of God:
Again, suppose you do not believe, yet by your words, you put weapons in the
hands of the Devil, to wound, and kill your self; for when you accuse your
self to be an unbeleever, and a Hypocrite; do you think that Satan will not
make advantage of your sayings against you? and so labor to confirm you in
your unbeleef and doubts? Therefore I counsel Saints, to take heed what
confessions they make, and what accusations they charge themselves with, for
Satan will seek no better proof against a man, to impeach him before God,
then this, Lord I accuse such a man to be an unbeleever, and a hypocrite,
witness this own confession; if he be so, why do thou suffer him to live;
if he be not so, why do thou suffer him to lie. Consider Psalm. 77.8, 9, 10.
Asaph (a godly man, and holy Prophet) when he had but propounded these
doubting questions, (though he concluded nothing) Will the Lord cast off for
ever? and will he be favorable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever?
does his promise fail for evermore, etc. he presently sees his sin therein,
and says, This is my infirmity; or as it is in the (...) Lxx. (...) Now I have
begun.
Hebrew, this is that my sickness (or plague) he looked upon unbeleefe, as the
great plague sore of his soul; and till God convince you of unbeleefe, and
that it is your sin to give way to doubting, you will continue to nourish
this snake in your bosom, which will sting your souls to death.

Ob. But though God makes the Covenant with men at first freely, and though it
be sure in its self; yet afterward there is some condition on man's part,
which if it be not performed by man, God is dismissed, and discharged, from
performing his part; for in a mutual Covenant among men, when one party
neglects to perform the Covenant, or Articles on his part, the other is no
longer tied in that Covenant, to the other party, or to perform the conditions
on his part.

A. This Objection supposes three things, that are not true; First, that the
Covenant of grace is partly free, and partly conditional; but this has been
before spoken of, and therefore I say no more, but what the Esa. 26.12
Prophet says (by altering the tense and person) The Lord does work all our
works in (or for) us, as well after believing as before believing.

Secondly, This Objection seems to hold forth that a man may have true faith
(objected before as the condition of the Covenant) and afterward lose it. But
its plain otherwise, that the 1 Job. 2.27.
Spirit, and 1 Jo. 3.9
seed of God (being once in believers) they remain, and abide for ever in
them; and therefore they cannot lose their faith, (or any other grace) totally:
Its true, they may lose Ps. 51.12 2 Samuel 27.1 with Ps. 3.6
degrees of faith, and recover them again, and they may Prove. 24.16.
fall often, and be restored, and Hos. 14 4
backslide, and be recovered. But God has said, Jer. 32.40
I will write my Laws in their hearts, and they shall not depart from me.

Thirdly, this Objection would make God as man, and Gods Covenant like man's
Covenant, but neither of both is so, Let God therefore be true, but every man a
liar; for when God makes this Covenant of grace once with any, he cannot, does
not, nor will not, break it with them. For mark how the Lord Esa. 54.10
speaks, The mountains shall depart, and the hills shall be removed, but my
kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my peace be
removed. So in Jer. 33.20.
Jeremy, If you can break my Covenant of the day, and my Covenant of the night
that there should not be day and night in their season, then may also my
Covenant be broken, etc. But grant Gods Covenant to be like man's Covenant,
(though to speak with reverence, it differs as much as God and man differ) yet
does not the Apostle Gal. 3.15
say, (though it be but a man's Covenant, yet if it be confirmed,) no man
disanulleth it. And if man (who is both frail and mutable) will keep his
promise, and covenant, how much more, will God, who is Genesis 17.1
Alsufficient, Jam. 1.17
without variableness, and Tit. 1.2.
cannot lie, keep his Covenant. Can it be thought, that that just God, who To.
1.31
hates Covenant Breaking, and Eze. 17.15 16, 17, 18.
punishes Covenant-breakers, will himself break Covenant; no, no: far be it
from us, to entertain such a sinful thought.

Ob. But God threatens the children of Israel, that they should know his breach
of promise, Number. 14.34.

A. That is, they should know what it was to charge him with breach of promise;
withal, this was but a conditional, and temporal promise; see Judge. 2.1.

Ob. But God threatens to deal with men, even as they deal with him, so that if
they break Covenant with him, he may do the like with them, Ezekiel. 16.59.

A. Gods dealing here, was not to break his Covenant with them; for in the
next verse he says, he will remember his Covenant, and establish it with
them; but his dealing with them was to chastise them, as he says Ps. 89.31 32,
33, 34.
elsewhere, If they break my Statutes and Commandments, then will I visit
their transgressions with a Rod, and their iniquity with stripes; nevertheless
my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my
faithfulness to fail; my Covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that
is gone out of my mouth.

Ob. Yet God says in Zach. 11.10.11. that he did break his Covenant with them.

A. By this Covenant may be meant outward happiness that God had promised the
Jews, and that conditionally; or else by this Covenant (as may seem by the 11.
verse) may be meant Jesus Christ, which the poor of the flock ( i. e. the
elect and saithfull) knew to be the word of God, which was broken for their
sins, and this agrees with other Scriptures, which call Christ a Esa. 42.6
Covenant, and also speak of the Esa. 53.10
breaking of him as Esa. 53. It pleased the Lord to bruise him, or as the
Hebrew is to Dacha, that same word which is in Ps. 94.5
break him in pieces.

Ob. Yet for all this, the Covenant of grace may be broken, if not on Gods
part, yet on man's part; for it is said plainly, that the Israelites brake the
everlasting Covenant, Esa. 24.6.

A. By the Covenant, here is meant the 2 King. 18.12.
Law or ten Commandments which the Israelites brake, as it is in the Heb. 8.9.
Hebrews, They continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not, says
the Lord.

Ob. But did not the Lord make this Covenant with the people of the Jews, and
yet for their unbeleefe they are cast out, and broken of these sixteen hundred
years.

A. You are to consider the Jews Rom..2 28, 29. Gal. 2.15. with Rev. 2.9.
two ways, either carnal, and spiritual, or Jews only by name, nature, and
profession, or else, Jews indeed, viz. the faithful and sincere hearted
people of God; or for the elect Jews that are yet to be called. As for the
first sort of them; God did never make the Covenant of grace with them, neither
were they ever in, or under the saving part and promises thereof. And as for
the faithful, he never brake promise with them; and for the elect Jews that
are yet to be called, God will remember the Covenant made with their Fathers,
and will Esa. 59.20. To. 11 27, 28.
perform it unto them their children.

Ob. But how could those carnal Jews, be cast out of the Covenant if they
were never in?

A. Its usual in Scripture language, to speak of persons (not as indeed they
are, but as they seem to be) as in Exodus 32.33. God threatens to blot their
names out of the book of life; whereas indeed they were Rev. 20.15
never in the book of life (unless by the book of life you understand the
Ps. 69.2^
book of natural life, or of the Deu. 29.20.
life of communion with the people of God, as that Scripture is to be
understood) but they were rather written in the Jer. 17.13
Earth, then in Heaven. So Joh. 15.2
branches are said to be in Christ when they are not really, but v. 6.
seemingly so. In this sense those carnal Jews, and carnal believers may be
said to be in Covenant with God, and in no other sense; for were they really,
and indeed in Covenant with him, they could never be cast out, nor the
Covenant broken with them: For the whole word of God is very Ps. 9 3, 5. and
19.7. and 111.7.
sure, and all his promises very 2 Cor. 1.20
certain, grounded upon the 2 Timothy 1.19
unchangeable purpose and Heb. 6.17.
counsel of God, so that he, being altogether wise, Joh. 21.17
knows how to perform; and Genesis 17.1 Isa. 43, 13.
all-sufficient, is able to perform; 1 These. 5.24.
faithful, and must perform; ps. 145.8.
gracious and merciful, and therefore will, (and cannot choose but) perform.
Nay, since God has never 1 kin. 8.56. Josh. 21.45. and 23.14.
failed nor brok promise, surely he will not do it.

Fifthly, It is a peaceable Covenant (or a Is. 54.10. Eze. 37.26
Covenant of peace) for when God enters into this Covenant with men, it is a
sign he is at Ez. 16 60, 61, 62, 63.
peace with them, and pacified toward them Ephesians. 2.13, 14.
through Jesus Christ. Also then the Lord Is. 57.19.
speaks peace to their souls, and Is. 33.17. Romans 4.17
sets up peace in their consciences, so that they walk with God in peace (as
the Mal. 2.6.
expression is concerning Levi) and are luke 1.79.
led into the way of peace, and their Phil 4.7. Romans 8.6. Isa. 26.3.
hearts, and minds, are kept by that peace, so that it may be said, that the
children of the Covenant, have Is. 54.13.
great peace with To. 5.1.
God, with the Ez 34.25 Hos. 2.18. Job. 5.23, 24.
creatures, in Is. 66.12. Psa. 29.11.
life and Ps. 37.37 Ier. 34.5.
death.

Obj. But there be many that are doubtless in Covenant with God, and yet have
neither spiritual, nor worldly peace; neither peace within, nor peace without,
neither peace living, nor peace dying, so that it may be said of them, as the
expression is, that they know not the way of peace, and they hear rather a
voice of trembling, and of fear, then of peace.

A. 1. It is true, as Eccl. 3.8.
Solomon says in another case, that there is a time of war, and a time of
peace; and doubtless, many a dear and precious soul, that is in Covenant and
favor with God, may for a time want-inward peace, and till the Lord himself
Ps. 85.8.
speaks peace, and Is. 45.7.
makes peace, the soul cannot enjoy it, yet mark how graciously the Lord
speaks, Is. 27.5.
Let him take hold on my strength, and he shall make peace with me: and I Is.
57.19.
create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, to him that is a far off, and to
him that is near, etc. It may be the fault of many souls, to refuse to
receive peace, as the Ps. 77.2.
Prophet refused to be comforted, or else to ground it upon their sense, and
feeling, and when that is gone their peace is lost: whereas inward and
soule-peace comes through Rom: 5.1 and 15.13,
believing: Seeing then God is the Author and Giver of peace, Christ the
Prince and promiser of peace, the Spirit the worker, and sealer of peace, and
the Gospel the word and ground of peace, and the Ministers, the Heralds and
Messengers of peace, such believers as want peace of conscience, should strive
to have the peace of God to Col. 3.15
rule in their hearts, and to believe that God will Ps: 29.11 Isa: 26, 12
bless them with peace, and to take heed if God do speak peace to them that
they return not again to the folly of unbeleife. Ps: 85.8.


2. For outward peace, or peace with the creatures, God gives that often to his
Saints, according to his Is: 66.12 Hag: 2.9.
promise, and when they want it, yet they have peace in Ioh: 16.27
Christ: And God so orders and sanctifies their troubles to them, that they do
receive no Is: 11.9.
hurt, but much 2 Cor: 7: 4 Rom: 5: 3
benefit thereby.

Sixthly, It is a holy Covenant, Dan. 11.28, 30. Luke 1.72. Psalm. 105.42.

Quest. Why is it called a holy Covenant.

A. 1. In respect of the Author of it. The most holy God, who is proclaimed by
the Seraphims, i. e. the Angels Is: 6: 3: Rev: 4: 9. it is in two Greek copies
nine times holy
thrice together, holy, holy, holy. And this Covenant God did Ps: 60: 6.
speak in his holiness, and ps: 89: 35.
confirm by his holiness.

2. In respect of those that are taken into Covenant, who are also a Dan: 12: 7
holy people, called Psa: 50: 5.
Saints.

Obj. Before, you said that God did take the unholy, and ungodly into Covenant,
and now you say they are holy, how can that agree?

A. When God does first enter into Covenant with men, he finds them unholy, but
as soon as the Covenant is struck with them, the Lord puts his Is: 63: 11.
holy spirit in them and his holiness in them, and so they become immediately
the psa: 63: 18
people of his holiness.

O. But does not God first make men holy, and then enter into Covenant with
them?

A. No, But God makes the Covenant with men that they lu: 1: 72, 73, 75.
might be holy.

3. It is called a holy Covenant, because holiness is Ez: 36: 25 26. To: 11:
26, 27.
promised in it, and conveyed through it, unto men.

4. It is called a holy Covenant, in regard it lev: 10: 3. 2 Cor: 6: 17
requires, and Tit: 2: 10, 11.
teaches holiness, and there is all the reason in the world, that those that
enter into union, and communion with God, should be holy in 1 cor: 3: 17
heart, and spirit, and in 1 Pet: 1: 15.
life and conversation.

5. It is called a holy Covenant, because nothing works more upon men, to make
them holy, then the Covenant of grace; for the promises are of a sanctifying
nature, therforesaith the 2 Cor. 7.1
Apostle, Having these promises let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness
of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness; And in To. 6.15.
another place says he, What, shall we sin because we are not under the Law,
but under Grace? God forbid; Tit. 3.4.5. Romans 12.1
Love, Grace, and Mercy, leave the strongest engagements on Saints to be holy.

Lastly, it is an Genesis 17.7. Jer. 32.40. Heb. 13 20. Rev. 16 6. It is called
Berith Melek, a Covenant of Salt, nam sal a corruptione conservat.
everlasting Covenant, as (before you heard) it was made from everlasting, so
it is to everlasting; for God Ps. 105.8
remembers his Covenant for ever, the word he commanded to a thousand
generations: Consider he that made it, is the Is. 40.28.
everlasting God; the motive that moved him to make it, was his Jer. 31, 3
everlasting love, the righteousness upon which it was established, is an Dan.
9 24
everlasting righteousness: yea all the legacies, and blessings thereof, are
everlasting; as Heb. 8.12
everlasting pardon, Isa. 54.8.
everlasting kindness, Ps. 100.5.
everlasting mercy, Isa 35.10
everlasting joy, and 2 These. 2.16.
consolation, and everlasting Ioh. 3.36
life, and Isa. 45.17
salvation.

Q. Did God remember, and perform the Covenant of grace to believers in all
ages?

A. Yea sure, the Lord was 2 Kin. 13 23.
gracious unto them, had compassion on them, and respect unto them because of
his Covenant; as it is Ps. 111.5 See Exodus 6.5. Luke 1 72.
said, he was (or will be) ever mindful of his Covenant.

Ob. But then it was to such as did keep his Covenant, Psalm. 103.18.

A. Nay, Though they like Hos. 6.7. See the margent.
Adam had transgressed his Covenant, and Eze. 16.59.60. Note v. 61 says God
not by thy Covenant i. e. the Law. Jer. 31.32. See Psalm. 8.31. with 34.
despised his oath, yet nevertheless, says he, I will remember my Covenant
with thee in the days of thy youth; ( i. e. when God first took them to be a
people, and made a Covenant with Abraham) and I will establish unto thee an
everlasting Covenant. God is so far from breaking his former Covenant with men
(when they sin against him) that he will rather renew it, yea add, and make a
second to confirm it.

Ob. But God says (of the Israelites) They continued not in my Covenant,
therefore I regarded them not, Heb. 8.9.

A. By that Covenant, is to be understood the Law, (or Covenant of works) and
by those Israelites the carnal Israelites, that were under that Covenant, and
not under the Covenant of grace: and such that are not Gods spiritual people,
nor under his special Covenant, he does not regard, Heb. 8.6, 7, 8, 9. Ps.
106.43. with v. 46.

Ob. Its true, God said to the Israelites, if their uncircumcised hearts were
humbled, then he would remember his Covenant with Jacob, etc. Lev. 26.42.

A. This was to the Jews in general, and it was but the outward part of the
Covenant, concerning the land of Canaan; Lev. 26.43 44.
but yet mark the 43. and 44 verses of that Chapter, They despised his
Judgments, and abhorred his Statutes: and yet for all (says God) I will not
cast him away, neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly, and to break
my Covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God: But I will for their sakes
remember the Covenant of their Ancestors. Here, though they were very far
from performing the condition of the Covenant, yet God was further from
breaking his Covenant; and though there was nothing in them to move God to keep
his Covenant, yet he looks on their i. e. Abraham, Isaac, and Jasob.
Ancestors.

Q. Did the believers under the Law in their distresses and miseries look upon
that Covenant?

A. Yea sure, they did 2 Chronicles. 16.15. Neh. 9.32
look upon it, and it was their Dan. 9.4 Neh. 1.5.
strongest fort for to fly unto, and their surest Basis and foundation, to
depend upon, and their Ier. 14.21 Psa. 74.20.
chiefest argument with God in prayer.

Q Was the Covenant of grace that believers were under, before the coming of
Christ (in the flesh) and the Covenant of grace, which believers are under
since (or now in the days of the Gospel,) one and the same Covenant?

A. Yes sure, it was one and the same Covenant; which 1. will plainly appear,
if you compare the promises thereof as they are set down in the Old Testament,
with the promises thereof as they are set down in the New; As for example,
compare Genesis 12.3. with Acts 2.15. and Gal. 3.8. and Lev. 26.12. with Heb.
8.12. and Psalm. 32.1. with Romans 4.6, 7. These with other instances, show it was
the same Covenant.

2. It must be the same Covenant, or else they under the Law had been saved
one way, and we another; but it is not so, for they were saved by the same
Deuteronomy. 33.29. Isa. 33.22. Romans 12.10.
Lord as we are saved by, (even Act. 15.10 11.
Jesus Christ) therefore it is said that Abraham Ioh. 8.56
saw Christ's day, and rejoiced, and that the Act. 26.6.7.
twelve Tribes served God with hopes to obtain the promise.

3. Yea the same Gospel, and righteousness was preached unto Heb. 4.2 1 Pet.
4.6. Romans 3.21 Gal. 3.8.
them as is preached unto us: for as I said before, the Ceremonial law was a
glass (though a dark one) wherein Christ was seen; so they had many pure
Romans 1.2
Gospel promises which they did see, Heb. 11.13
believe, and embrace, and doubtless were heirs, and Heb. 11.33
partakers thereof, as well as we. And therefore we read of the Tit. 1.4.
common faith, and Jude v. 3
common salvation, (so called, not because it was common to every man and woman
in the world) but because it was the same in all ages, as well before Christ as
since.

Ob. If it bad been the same Covenant, the Apostle would not have called them
two Covenants as he does, Heb. 8.

A. Note, that the Apostle does not there call the Covenant of grace before
Christ, and the Covenant of grace since, two Covenants; but the Covenant of
works, or the ten Commandments, he calls the first Covenant, which Covenant,
Heb. 8.9.
says the Apostle, the Lord made with your forefathers when he brought them
out of the land of Egypt, which is very plain to be no other then the ten
Ier. 31.31.32.
Commandments; for the Covenant of grace was made with Abraham four hundred
and thirty years, before the Israelites were brought out of the land of Egypt,
therefore it could not be meant of that Covenant, of necessity therefore the
Apostle here by two Covenants, means not two Covenants of grace, but the
Covenant of works, and the Covenant of grace, or the Law, and the Gospel.

Q. If the Covenant of grace here spoken of, be the same Covenant with that
made before the Law; why then does the Apostle call it a new Covenant? he might
rather have called it the old Covenant, then the new.

A. It is called a new Covenant, not because it was then begun to be made, for
it was before of old time, as Eccl. 1.10
Solomon speaks in another case; But it is called new:

1. Because it was manifested and renewed, and so is called the new Covenant,
as Christ is called a He. 10.20
new way, love, a 1 Ioh. 2.7 8.
new Commandment; the old heart a Ez. 36.26
new heart; the Moon a Col. 2.16
new Moon: Christ was the way from everlasting, love a duty from the
beginning, the heart had a being, and the Moon a form: but they are said to
be new, in respect of manifestation, and renovation: even so the Covenant of
grace is now since Christ was made flesh, more To. 16.15 2 Cor. 3.11 Heb. 9.8.
plainly and clearly revealed, and the great, and glorious mysteries that were
before held forth in Ceremonies and shadows, are now brought to light. Gods
bosom is more opened, his Cabinet of Jewels unlocked, his everlasting grace,
and mercy, his eternal love and pity, his unspeakable goodness, and glory,
are all brought out to clear and public view; and his Covenant is now drawn
and written in such fair and great Characters, so plainly, and exquisitly,
that they that run may read, if they have but the least spark of spiritual,
and heavenly light in them.

2. It is called a new Covenant, becauseall old things that did belong unto it,
are now done away, as the Priests sacrifices, Altar, washing, and diverse
Ordinances, which were mere appendices to the Covenant, and to continue no
longer then till Ephesians. 2.15
Christ his death, or at furthest till his Cant. 2.15. and 4.6.
coming in the Spirit, called the Heb. 9.10
time of Reformation. As the heavens and earth are said to be Isa. 65.17
new, when the state of them are but altered, and the Church said to be a 1
Cor. 5.7
new lump, when unprofitable, and obstructing members are cast out. So the
Covenant is called new, because of the altering and changing the administration
thereof, and by lopping off, and casting away those troublesome, shadowy
branches, the Ceremonies, which did eclipse and darken the body of the Covenant.

3. It was called a new Covenant, because it was then Before Christ came in the
flesh, believers had a little of the first fruits of the Gospel, but the
harvest thereof was reserved till after his coming, Ioh. 4.35, 36.
perfected, and completed; and as we call that a new house which is newly
finished, though the foundation of it, and a great part of the structure were
laid long before, as the last Temple in Jerusalem was begun above forty years
before it was completed and finished: so was this Covenant of grace near
four thousand years between the first making of it with Adam, Ioh. 2.20
and the completing of it by Jesus Christ. Mark the word in Heb. 8.8. Behold
the days come (says the Lord) when I will make a new Covenant with the house
of Israel, so it is in the English; but it is in the Greek, (...) the same word
is translated finished Romans 9.28 ended, Math. 7.28 luke 4.13. fulfilled, Mar.
13.4.
and I will finish or perfect for the house of Israel, and the house of Judah
the new Covenant. This Scripture proves that the Covenant was before begun, and
in the days of the Gospel finished; also there is another excellent truth in
it, That God will finish this Covenant for the house of Israel and Judah, (
sci. all the Jews) at their next Call and Conversion, which I shall speak of
afterward.

Lastly, it is called a new Covenant, because it was confirmed in a new manner,
even by the Dan. 9.2
death of Jesus Christ, and by his He. 10 15 Gal. 5.5.
Spirit; also by new Ordinances; to wit, 1 Pet. 3.21. Baptism does save us i
e. seals salvation to us, as Noah's Ark, and his temporal deliverance, were
signs of Christ, and eternal salvation.
Baptism; and the 1 Cor. 11 24.26.
Lords Supper.

Q. Is the new Covenant, and the new Testament one and the same?

A. Yes they are Berith in Hebrew, and Diathcke in Greck signifies both a
Covenant, and Testament Testamentum quasi Tesles mentis, the witness of the
mind.
one, and the same, (and the Covenant or Testament of Christ is but the will of
Christ) only since the death of Christ it may more fitly and properly be
called a Testament, then a Covenant; being a Testament is the last will of one,
and therein men use to bequeath all their Le gacies, and dispose of all that
they have to give. Also in Covenants there be many Ifs and Conditions; but in
a Testament all bequeathed Legacies are absolute.

Lastly, What is made before unto men by Covenant, is afterward strongly,
unchangeably, and unalterably confirmed and assured, by a man's last Will and
Testament; Even so, the Covenant of grace was converted, (if I may so term it)
into a Testament by Christ, and all his Legacies, put into this Testament, in
which, he freely, and absolutely conveyes all his estate, riches, benefits,
blessings, and merits, to be divided, distributed, and disposed among his poor
friends, the children of men, (that believe in him.) And that this Testament
might be of force, Christ the Testator dies, (otherwise the Testament Heb.
8.16 17.
could not be of force) and the holy Spirit is Joh. 16.13.14.
appointed by Christ, as Executor to see this his will performed.

Q. Was there no necessity for Christ to dye, save only to confirm the
Covenant?

A. Yes, there were many other ends and reasons of Christ his death.

Q. What are they?

A. First, To Lu. 24.44
fulfill the Scriptures, viz. the Ceremonies, Mat 26.56
Prophesies, and Mat. 5.17
Commandments, or moral Law; and that this was a maine end of Christ's death
it clearly appears, by our Saviors Mat 26.54
own words, (when Peter would have defended him with the sword) but how then,
says Christ to him, shall the Scriptures be fullfilled: Lu. 24.44 Ioh. 19.36
again, all things, says he, must be fullfilled that are written in the Law of
Moses, in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning me.

Q. How did Christ by his death fulfill the Ceremonial Law?

A. The Ceremonial Law, which confisted in types and shadows, as in slaying
and offering of sacrifices, in shedding of blood, when Christ who was the Ich.
1.7. truth here is put in opposition to ceremonies.
truth, and substance of them, suffered, they were expired, finished, and
executed (in which sense, the word fulfilled is Act. 13.25 Rev. 15.8.
taken) yea, the whole bulk, and body of that law with all that belonged
thereunto was (as I have hinted before) so absolutely and perfectly Ephesians. 2.15,
the Greek word (...) signifies destroyed.
taken away and Col. 2.14
nailed to Christ's cross, that those Ceremonies were afterward to be looked
upon (in respect of observance) as if they never had been at all, and no more
to be Col. 2.20.21, 22. by ordinances is meant the ceremonies. Heb. 9.1.20.
used, then if they had never been commanded by God.

Obj. If they were so done away by the death of Christ, why had they not been
put out of the Bible?

A. They are not left in the bible, that men may retain and use those
Ceremonies, now in Gospel days, (as Prelaticall and Demi-Jewish-Priests did
and still do maintain, viz. a material Temple or Church, therefore Temple or
Church-worship, Altars, therefore offerings, and sacrifices; Piests, therefore
Tithes and Oblation) but they are left that Jews and Gentiles may compare the
Type, with the Antitype, that they might believe. Likewise, to show the great
difference, between the administration of the Law, which the Jews were under,
and the administration of the Gospel, which the Gentiles are now under, and
that we Gentiles may praise God for our freedom from such.

Obj. If they were done away by the death of Christ, why then did the Apostles
after his death use any of them?

A. 1. The Apostles did use but very few of them, and that very seldom, and
but for a short time, neither then to allow of them, or confirm them, but
partly because that the Jewith people, were not as yet Ac: 13.45, 46, 47.
rejected nor unchurched, and partly, because of their 1 cor. 9.20, 21, 22.
weakness, hoping thereby to win them. But we do not find that the Apostles
did ever do this, among the Gentiles, as I remember, but once, that ga. 2.12.13
Peter did conform out of fear, and dissimulation, and then Paul reproves him
v. 11. and 14.
publicly, and that justly too, for it.

2. The Apostles did both Act: 15.6, 7, 10, 12, 19, 20.
jointly, and Ac: 17: 24 and 7.48.
severally Ac: 21.21.
teach, and Ac: 21.25
write against the observation of those Ceremonies, making the 2 cor: 11: 14.
with Gal: 6: 12. and Phil: 3.2
teachers thereof false, and the Gal: 5: 2. and 4: 9, 11.
observers thereof faith less.

Obj. Nay, the Apostles were so far from taking away all the Ceremonies, that
at a public Assembly, they rather establish some of them, Act: 15.29.
as blood, and things strangled, and things offered to Idols, they do prohibit
to be eaten, which things were Ceremonial and prohibited in that Law.

A. 1. You are to understand that the Church of Antioch (and some other
Churches, to whom the Apostles wrote and sent their decrees) consisted both of
Jews, and Gentiles, and so were guilty of giving offense each to other, as
some by Fornication, others by eating things offered to Idols, things
strangled, and blood. The Apostles for the reconciling of them each to other,
and likewise to subdue sin amongst them, join eating of things offered to
Idols, things strangled, and blood, being now but things indifferent, with
Fornication, which was absolutely evil, that so both parties, without
upbraiding each other, might close in love and eschew sin. Note also that in
three Greek copies there is this added at the end of the Staphanus Greek
Testament (...). b. 1 so after the word fornication in the 20 verse.
20 verse, that whatsoever ye would not have done to you, do ye not to others.

2. Those decrees (concerning meat offered to Idols, things strangled, and
blood) did not then bind their consciences: For doubtless they might have
eaten thereof without sin, in case they did not offend others by eating, much
less does it bind Christians now: Therefore be not scrupulous in this, but
read the To: 14: 14 1 Cor: 8: 8. 1 Timothy: 4.5. Act: 10: 14, 15. These Scriptures
show that all things edible may be eaten now in Gospel days without sin.
Scriptures that are sufficient to resolve you herein.

Q. How did Christ fulfill the Prophesies by his death?

A. He So the word is taken in Psalm. 20.4. 1 Kin. 2.27
made good those Prophesies that foretold his death; as for example, compare
Zach. 11.12. with Matthew. 27.3. and Esa. 50.6. with Matthew. 26.67. and Psalm.
69.21. with Matthew. 27.34. Esa. 53.12. with 22.37 and Psa. 22.18. and Mat.
27.35. These and several other paralleld Scriptures, do plainly show that
Christ's sufferings were a true and lively exposition of the Prophets, and that
the words of the Prophets, without variation, or contradiction, were true in
him.

Q But how could it possibly be, that the Jews, who knew all these Prophesies
did not see them fulfilled in Christ?

A. Doubtless, that 2 These. 2.10.11.
Scripture was verified in them, Because they received not the love of the
truth that they might be saved, God sent them strong delusions, that they
should believe a lie; they partly Mar. 13.15
shut their eyes against the truth, and partly Joh. 12.40 Esa. 6.8.
God blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, and partly the 2 Cor. 4.4
Devil blinded their minds, that they could not understand, and believe.

2. The Jews did overlooke Christ's state of humiliation, and looked for him to
come in power, and great glory, to deliver Luke 24.21
them out of the hands of their outward enemies, which doubtless will be the
manner of his next coming for their conversion and restoration, spoken of,
Mark. 13.26, 27. Matthew. 24.30. compared with Zach. 13.10. and Rev. 1.7.

Ob. But did not the Jews know him to be the Christ, and did they sin
ignorantly, or knowingly, and maliciously?

A. Without question many, or most of them sinned ignorantly, as Tim. 1.13
Paul (who was one of them) said, because I sinned ignorantly, I obtained
mercy; and as the Apostle 1 Cor. 2.8
else where says, If they had known him, they would not have crucified the
Lord of glory; yet it is likely that some of the Priests, and Pharisees, sinned
Joh. 9.41
knowingly, Mat. 12.31.
wilfully, and Mat. 28.11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
maliciously.

Q. How did Christ fulfill the Moral Law, (or ten Commandments) by his death?

A. He did So the word fulfill is taken Ps. 145.19 To. 13.14
satisfy and perform, for men, what the Law could require, and exact from
them, and so became the To. 10.3
end of the Law, for righteousness, or Justification, to every one that
believes; and so Gal. 3.13
redeemed, and freed them from the curse of the Law, by being made a curse for
them; (this I have hinted before, and I handle more at large afterward in this
Treatise.) But I come to the second end of Christ's death: Remember the first
was to fulfill the Scriptures.

Secondly, The second end, or reason of Christ's death, was to Heb. 9 16. 1 John
3.5.
take away sins, for as under the Law, sins were not so much as Lev. chapter 4
with Heb. 9.22.
typically and seemingly pardoned, without shedding of the blood of those
beasts and sacrifices (that did signify Christ) so it was Heb. 10.4
impossible that men's sins should be done away really and actually, without
the shedding of Christ's own precious Heb. 13.12.
blood, and the offering up of his pure and perfect Heb. 10.5, 6, 8, 10, 11,
12, and 7.27. and 9.14.
body.

Q What do you mean by the blood of Christ?

A. I mean not only, nor chiefly, that natural, and material blood, which
came out of Christ's body, when it was Jch. 20.25
nailed to the Cross, or when it was Joh. 19 34.
pierced by the Soldiers; but by Christ's blood, is meant his To. 3.25 and 5 9.
Mat. 27.24
death, and whole sufferings.

Q Why then is it called the blood of Christ, and not the death and sufferings
of Christ?

A. 1. Because that the blood is the Genesis 9.4
life, or the Lev. 17.14
life is in the blood, and when the blood is shed and lost, the life is gone:
Even so here, Christ's blood, being as it were the fountain of his natural
life, and the pouring out of his blood, being a special part of his
sufferings, Synecdoche.
it is put here (by a figure) for his whole sufferings.

2. The blood of Christ is so often mentioned by the Apostles, (for the whole
sufferings of Christ) because that most of those Epistles where there is
mention made of Christ's blood, as the Epistle to the Hebrews, Peter's and John's
first Epistles, they were written to the Jews, who were acquainted with the
shedding, offering, and sprinkling of the blood of the Sacrifices under the
Law, and it is an usual thing with the Apostles to retain many As Sanctuary,
Tabernacle, Altar, Sacrifice. Heb. 8.2. and 13.10.15
Old Testament-words in their writings, which are to be spiritually, and not
literally understood. But the death of Christ, and the sufferings of Christ are
also frequently mentioned in the Scriptures as well as his blood, and in the
same sense.

Q. What sins, and whose sins did Christ take away by his death?

A. All the sins of all those, whether Jews, or Gentiles, that To. 3.25 Heb.
2.15.
did believe, Act. 13.39.
do believe, or To. 11.23
shall believe in him.

Q. But did not Jesus Christ take away the sins of all, as well the sins of
those that do not believe, To. 8.33.
as the sins of those that do believe?

A. Though I would be cautious and tender, in limitting, restraining, or
stinting the death of Christ, and the efficacy of his merits, or in censuring
such as hold and teach universal Redemption, (if they do it out of a desire,
and conscience to exalt Christ, in the riches of his grace) yet to me it
appears that Christ has not taken away the sins of those that believe not,
but dye in unbelief; and that by these Reasons:

Reas. 1. If Christ has taken away their sins, then nothing can be laid to
their charge; for what can be laid to the charge of any but sin? So that take
away the sin, and you acquit the sinner.

Ob. Christ has taken away the sin of Adam from all, so that his sin is not
laid to the charge of any to their condemnation.

A. 1. If that were so, then all children that dye before they act and commit
sin must needs be saved. Also that denies and destroys Election; But,

2. If that were granted, yet it would not avail you, for you must hold that
Christ has taken away all the actual sins of all men, and not only that
virtuall sin of Adam: else your Objection has no force in it.

Ob. Christ has taken away the sins of all men which they have committed
against the first Covenant, and those sins are no more imputed unto them;
neither are they damned for those sins, but for their unbelief only.

Sometimes you say, that children did not sin at all in Adam, and so were never
guilty of that sin; then you acknowledge that they were guilty, A plain
contradiction.
but that Christ took away that guilty from all, now you say that Christ took
away all sins but unbeleif, and that men are damned only for that sin.

A. 1. The Scripture does no where say, that Christ took away some of a man's
sins, and not all, or all his sins save unbelief, or that God pardons some
of a man's sins and not all, No, the Scripture speaks Tit. 2: 14. Jer: 33: 8,
Mic: 7.29.
contrary.

2. Men are not damned for Unbelief only, but for Mat 25: 41
uncharitableness, To: 1.32.
coverousnesse, malice, hardness of heart, etc. And God says, he will give to
every man Ec. 12.14 2 Cor: 5.10
according to his works, and if unbelief be the only cause of condemnation,
then consequently, all the Heathens which have not the Gospel are saved. For
unbelief is a sin against the Gospel, for neither the law nor the creatures
(Sun, Moon, Stars, etc.) do teach faith in Christ as in a Mediator. Nay, if
unbelief does damn men (as indeed it does, but not only) then it is a wonder
that Christ would not take away that sin with the rest, but suffer so many
millions to perish for not dying for the sin, or for want of giving them the
grace of faith.

Obj. You say the Scripture does not mention the taking away of some sins and
not all, does not the Apostle say that Christ by means of death made
redemption for the sins that were against the first Testament, Heb. 9.15,

A. The text is not sins against the first Testament but under the first
Testament, and the meaning of that Scripture seems to be this, that it was
Christ that did make satisfaction for the sins of those that lived under the
Law, or first Testament, as well as for the sins of those that lived since,
which the Apostle To. 3.25
elsewhere calls sins past, or if otherwise you understand this Scripture thus,
that Christ by his death did make satisfaction for the sins of those that did
believe, which they committed whilst they were under the Law or first
Testament, but in that text he does not say, the sins of all those that were
under the first Testament.

Obj. But Christ says, all sin shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and
blasphemies, mat. 12.31
wherewith soever they shall blaspheme, but he that blasphemeth against the
Holy Ghost shall never have forgiveness, so that here is no sin unpardoned but
unbeleefe.

A. 1. The meaning is not, that al sins committed against the father and
against the Son are forgiven unto men, and shall not be imputed unto them, but
that those sins are pardonable: but they that blaspheme against the holy ghost
(especially against knowledge, Heb. 10.29
and thereby do despite unto the spirit of grace) these cannot be pardoned, 1
Ioh. 5.16.17.
for they sin, as the Apostle speaks, the sin unto death.

2. Blasphemy is not unbelife (though not without unbelief) for the word
signifies (...) so translated Ephesians. 4.31.
evil speaking, and the Jews blasphemed against the holy Ghost, by saying,
that Christ cast out devils by Beelzebub, when he cast them out by the spirit
of God, and upon this occasion Christ did Mat: 12.24: 31.
speak these words.

Obj. If that were the meaning, then Paul could not have been saved, for be
blasphemed.

A. Though Paul blasphemed, yet it was not against the holy Ghost, but against
the Act: 26.9.
name of Jesus, and this also he did Tim. 1.13
ignorantly.

Obj. But sure, unbelief is the only cause of damnation, for Christ says,
this is the condemnation, Joh. 3.19.

A. It is not denied but that unbelief is a cause of damnation (yea sure a
maine cause) but it is not the only cause, and that place you cite does not
speak at all of unbelief, but of loving darkness, and sure ignorance is no
less 2 The: 1.8
sin, neither will have less punishment then unbelief, for did men ps. 9: 10.
know Christ they would believe in him: So much for the first Reason.

2 Reason, If that were true that Christ did take away the sins of all those
that dye in unbelief, then sure it will be great injustice in God to punish
men for the same sins, that he had punished his son for before, to imprison the
surety and to exact the utmost of him, and then to imprison the debtour for the
same debt, and to keep him in perpetual durance and torment for the same debt,
is a thing unheard of among just men, God under the Law did require but an eye,
for an eye, and a tooth, for a tooth; Ex: 21.24.
And sure under the Gospel he will not be more rigid, as to require the life
of his son, and the life of a sinner for the same disobedience. No, no, God
says that Christ shall Is: 53.11
see of the travel of his soul and be satisfied: sure it would not satisfy
Christ, to dye for millions, and to enjoy scarce thousands; or to purchase all,
and to enjoy but the least part.

Obj. Though their sins were laid on Christ, and he punished for them, yet they
are not pardoned unless men believe.

A. Sure Christ would not undergo punishment for men, and suffer them to be
damned for ever, for want of giving them faith to believe it. For a man that
will undergo hanging to save another from hanging, will not deny if the poor
prisoner be in the Goal and cannot come out, vide contra Heb: 9.12. and 10.14.
to go in and help him out. This is to make Christ's redemption but a
partial, and not a perfect redemption. Again, if Christ damnes men only for
not believing, then he damns them either for what they cannot do, or for what
they can do, if you say they cannot believe, then you reflect on Christ for
damning them for what they cannot do: if you say they can believe of
themselves, then you make Christ a liar who Joh: 15.5.
says without him they can do nothing.

Obj. But Christ offers faith to all.

Ans. Suppose he did so, yet that is not enough, for he must not only offer
faith, but give faith, therefore says the Apostle, when he speaks of faith,
and Ephesians 2: 8. Phil, 1: 29.
that not of your selves, but it is the gift of God, here faith is excluded
from saving (as it is man's act,) as well as works.

3 Reason, If Christ has taken away the sins of all, then he has reconciled
all to God, for nothing but sin hindered reconciliation, and the Scripture
says, that the 2 Cor. 5.19 To. 11.15.
world (which word is not there to be taken generally for every one in the
world) was reconciled to God, by the death of his son, as well as their sins
taken away by his death.

Obj. Yes, Christ has reconciled all, but what then?

A. Then all shall be saved, for the Apostle To. 5.10.
says, If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his
son, how much more shall we be saved by his life? Col: 1, 20 21.
In another place he says, And you that were sometimes alienated, and enemies
in your minds by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled, in the body of his
flesh through death, but what to do? Mark! to present you holy and unblamcable
and unreproveable in his sight.

Obj. Oh but the Apostle speaks in these places of believers, but in the
other, of the world.

A. That Epistle to the Corinthians was written to believers, as well as the
other two, and the emphasis and strength of the thing, does not lie in the word
WORLD, though afterward I clear that word also, but in the word reconciled.
Consider therefore whether there be more persons reconciled, then saved, and
whether salvation be not as large and as sure as reconciliation, for certainly
if God be at peace with men, he cannot damn them.

Obj. vide Is: 53.5. To. 5.1, 2 Col: 1.20.
All things in earth are said to be reconciled to God, but all things in earth
are not saved.

A. There is difference between things, and persons; and as all things (that
are figuratively said to be reconciled) are not saved, so none of them are
damned.

The fourth and last Reason, (to omit many others) that Christ has not taken
away the sins of all, are the words of Christ himself, his Prophets, and
Apostles. As for example, Christ says, This is my blood of the new Testament
which is shed for many, if he had intended it for all, mat 26.28
sure he would then have told it to his Disciples plainly, this is shed for all
Joh: 17.9.
I pray not for the world, sure he would have prayed for those that he shed his
blood for Joh: 8.21.
ye shall dye in your sins, which if he had taken away, he would not have so
said.

Joh: 10.11
I lay down my life for the sheep, and for my and 15.13
friends. So the words of the Prophets, Is: 53.5.
The chastizement of our peace was upon him, and by his ver. 11.
stripes we are healed, He shall justify man, for he shall bear their
iniquities,} ver: 12.
he bare the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors, here is
plainly held forth, that those for whom Christ was wounded, they are healed,
those that he dyed for, they are justified, and those for whom he poured out
his soul, he interceded for, and as another Dan. 9.24
Prophet prophesied of Christ, that he should finish the transgression and
make an end of sins, and make reconciliation for iniquity, and bring in
everlasting righteousness. And to this agree the words of the Apostles, To.
4.25.
He, viz. Christ, dyed for our sins, and rose again for our justification, 2
cor. 5.21
be was made sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in
him. So says another Apostle, 1 Pet. 3.18.
Christ has once suffered, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to
God, Hence it may be inferred, that those whose sins were imputed to Christ,
his righteousness was imputed to them; and those for whom he dyed, he brought
them (or reconciled them) to God, and justified them. Now that men may have
Christ's righteousness imputed to them, and they reconciled to God, and
justified, and yet be afterward damned, the Scriptures do not prove, but
clean contrary, as for example, Rom: 4.6.
Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes righteousness, etc. Chap. 5.9
much more being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath
through him, and Cha. 8.30
whom he justified them he also glorified, See further, Mat. 1.21. Heb. 9.28.
Rev. 5.9.

Obj. Though Christ speaks there of shedding his blood for many, yet by many
may be meant all.

A. It is true, the word many seems to be taken for all in two places of
Scripture, viz. Dan. 12.1. Romans 5.19. and in no more as I find, yet in our
Saviors language, who spoke plainest, though in the New Testament we find him
himself use the word near 20 times; yet never in that sense, for all.

Obj. But in other Scriptures Christ is said to dye for all, as 2 Cor. 5.15. 1 Timothy 2.6. Christ gave himself a ransom for all.

A. 1. The word all is not to be always taken for every one, but sometimes for
many, as Ps: 118.10
All nations compassed me about, All Judea and all Mat: 3.5. Mark: 1.5. See
more Zach. 8.10 Ioh: 8.2. Act: 2.47. Act: 1.1.
the Region round about Jordan, are said to go out to John and to be baptized
of him. It cannot be thought that all Nations in the World compassed the
Prophet round about, but many Nations, or that every particular man, woman, and
child in Judea were baptized of John, for it is Luk: 7.30
said expressly that the Pharisees and Lawyers were not baptized of him.

2. The word All is very often taken in Scripture for all kind; as Paul 1 Timothy
2.1
exhorts, that supplication, prayer and intercession be made for all men,
that is, men of all sorts, and degrees, as well Rulers, as others. Act: 7.22
Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, that is, in all kind of
wisdom To: 14.2.
One beleiveth that be may eat all things, that is, all manner of things Mat:
4.23.
Christ healed all diseases; that is, all manner of diseases,

3 All, is restrained often in Scripture to Gods peculiar people, Ioh. 12.32
says Christ, I will draw all men to me; that is, Ioh: 6.45. Isa: 54.13.
all that the father gave him.

They shall be all taught of God; not all the world sure, but all Gods people.

I Act: 2.7.
will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; this cannot be meant of all the
wicked.

1 These: 2.15
They please not God, and are contrary to all men; that is, all good men.

And sometimes the word all, is to be understood of all wicked men, as Christ
says mat: 10.22
ye shall be hated of all men for my name sake; that is, of all wicked men.

Hereby you see how the word All is taken variously; and therefore it is to be
limited and determined to persons, or things, according as the text will bear.

Obj. But you have answered nothing to the texts before cited.

A, Now I come more particularly, to answer those texts, the Apostle says,
that if one dyed for all, then were all dead, and that hedyed for all.

1. This place must be meant of all those to whom the Apostle did write this, 2
Cor. 5.15, opened,
or of all those that Christ rose again for; because the Apostle joins Christ's
death and his resurrection together, but unto him which dyed for them and rose
again. Also in several otherplaces, as To. 8.34. It is Christ that dyed,
yearather that is risen again, so To. 4.25. He was delivered for our offenses,
and rose again for our justification.

2. The Apostles scope here, is not to declare for whom Christ dyed, but that
those for whom he di'd should live to him, as Paul writes Tit. 2.11.
elsewhere, The grace of God which brings salvation has appeared unto all
men, teaching them to deny ungodlines, etc here the Apostles end is, not to
show that the grace of God has appeared to every man in the world, but that
those to whom this grace had appeared, it appeared for this end,

And this, with what has been declared before concerning the word all, may
serve to answer the other text in 1 Timothy 2.6. He gave himself a ransom for
all, that is clearly to be understood, 1 Timothy 2.6. opened.
for all sorts of men, as the first and second verses declare: or all that are
ransomed are ransomed by Christ, as it is said, All may prophesis one by one,
here the word all, is not meant of every member in the Church, 1 cor. 14.31
but of all those that have the spirit of prophecy; in like manner here,
Christ was made a ransom for all, that is, for all those for whom Christ
intended to give his life.

Obj. But as in Adam all dye, so in Christ shall all be made alive, 1 Cor.
15.22.

A. That is, all shall be raised from the dead at the general resurrection as
the 21 ver. plainly shows, 1 cor. 15.22 opened.
for as by man came death, so by man also came the resurrection of the dead,
and the maine scope of the Chapter is concerning the general resurrection, and
not concerning Christ's death; further note, that this Scripture is very
impertinently urged for universal redemption, for it tends to universal
salvation, rather then universal redemption.

Obj. But the Apostle says, Christ tasted death for every man, Heb. 2.9.

A, The true meaning of that Scripture seems to be this, that Christ by the
grace of God (or power and goodness of God up holding him) tasted death above
any other man, that is, his sufferings were greater then any other man's
sufferings, and so the Greek may be (...) is taken for any, as well as for all,
Act: 10.14. To. 3.20. 1 Cor: 1.29. and (...) signifies above, as well as for 1
Cor: 4.6. Luk: 16.11 and that with a genitive case (1 Cor: 15 29.) as it is in
this text
translated, either above any man, or 2 cor: 11.23. Gal. 1.14.
more then any man: and our Saviors words, to John and James, import so much,
for says he, can you drink of the cup that I drink of? or be baptized with
the baptism that I am baptized with? Importing that it was impossible for
them, or any others, to bear such sufferings as he was to bear.

2. Every man is to be taken here as in other Scriptures, either for many, or
for those that are intended (as I said before) in the text; for instance, Cant.
3.8.
Every man had his sword on his thigh. mic. 4.4
Every man shall sit under his Vine. Then 1 Cor. 4.5.
every man shall have praise of God. Every man in the world had not a sword to
wear, nor a Vine to fit under, neither, shall every man have praise of God.
These, with See Ez. 33.10. Zac: 3.10. Ioh: 1.9 Romans 3.4. 1 Cor. 7.2.20, 24.
many moresuch Scriptures, declare that every man, is not taken for every one
in the world, indefinitely, and particularly.

3. Let it be granted, that Christ tasted death for every man, and that all men
have some benefit by the death of Christ, as I believe they have their natural
lives, the enjoyment of the creatures, and the like, which they could not have
had without Christ ( Adam having lost all by his sin) yet it does not follow,
that if Christ tasted death for every man, that therefore he suffered the
wrath of God for every man, and the punishment due to all for their sins.
Christ might taste death for all in general, but drink the cup of sufferings
to the bottom, only for his chosen seed in particular, as it is said mat 27.34
he tasted the vinegar mingled with gall, but be would not drink of it (and
may there not some mystery be held out thereby?) So some Heb. 6.5.
are said to taste of the heavenly gift, and yet such were without Christ. But

Fourthly, and lastly, there is enough in the Chapter it self to clear the
text, and to show both the end and extent of Christ's death, viz. to make
reconciliation for, and to sanctify and save those; whom he calls his brethren
and children, ver. 11, 12, 13.

Obj. You said before that Christ gave himself for his sheep, and for his
friends, true; But not only for them; for be said that be would give his flesh
for the life of the world, Joh. 6.51.

A. 1. By world, in that text, cannot be meant all the world, those that are
damned, as well as those that are saved: for then either all the world should
be saved, or else Christ missed and failed to obtain the end of his death; for
he said, he would give his flesh for the life of the world; it is not probable
that Christ did intend to give it for the world, and yet that the world should
never have it, or partake of it, as one of the Universalifts says; his words
are these: Tho. More in his book
Christ redeemed the world of mankind, satisfied Gods justice, obtained a way
of salvation for every man, but never intended that the outward act, should put
every man in possession of pardon, or state of Justification or Salvation.

This is very strange, that Christ should do that for men which he did never
intend they should be the better for; will a man pay another debt for him, and
yet never intend that it should be imputed to the debtor, sure the debtor is no
way engaged to such a pay master.

2. By the world in that text, and in several other places, is meant either
the Gentiles in distinction, and opposition to the Jews (as clearly appears
if you) compare, Matthew. 28.19. with Mark. 16.15. In Matthew it is, Go and
preach the Gospel to all Nations. But in Mark it is, Go ye into all the
world; so Romans 11.15. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the
world; the Apostle means by the word them, the Jews, and by the word world,
the Gentiles, as is most plain in the 11. and 12. verses; Through their fall
(says he) salvation is come to the Gentiles; again, if the fall of them be
the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the
Gentiles; so that there is nothing clearer, then that by the world he means
the Gentiles in distinction and opposition to the Jews. Also this is to be
observed, that the Jews under the Law, were the Ex. 12.19 Deuteronomy 23.2
only Church, and the Gentiles, or other Nations were counted the world, or
Lev. 26.33. Psalm. 79.1.
Heathens, even as now in the days of the Gospel, believers are accounted the
Act. 2.47 1 Cor. 14.23.
Church, and unbeleevers the Ioh. 14 17.22. and 17.9. 1 Cor. 11.10.12.
world.

3. By the world, may be meant the Elect and chosen of God, among the Jews and
Gentiles, both those that are actual and real believers, or those whom God
does intend to bring to believe, and these are called the world, partly because
by nature they do partake of the corruptions of the world, and partly because
they are taken out of Jews and Gentiles; but especially because they are the
better part of the world, as the Apostles are called the Mat. 5.14
light of the world.

Ob. But where are the Elect called the world in Scripture?

A. In several places, as 2 Cor. 5.19. God was in Christ reconciling the world
unto himself, not imputing to them their trespasses. These cannot be
reprobates, for he says, their sins are not imputed to them: So To. 4. 13. for
the promise that he should be heir of the world; by the world is here meant
the To. 4.16
faithful, who are the Gal. 3.29 Luke 13.16
children of Abraham; so Joh. 3.17. God sent not his Son into the world to
condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved: they that
Christ intended to save, or really saves, cannot be Reprobates. Also in Joh.
6.33. For the bread of God is that which comes down from beaven, and gives
life unto the world: Sure Christ does not give life to all. Again, Christ
promises, that his Spirit should convince the world of sin. Sure this must
needs be a This is the judgment of most (or all) godly Interpreters, see Ioh
17.21. which expounds it, that the world may believe, i.e. those of the world
that are appointed to believe.
saving conviction, and they must needs be the Elect, and not Reprobates that
are convinced, for they are convinced of unbeleefe, of their own and Christ's
Righteousness (which I think no Reprobate is convinced of.) So also the
Apostle Heb. 2.5.
says, That God has not put in subjection to the Angels the world to come,
whereof we speak; (mark that) meaning by the world to come, the Or the heirs
of salvation, Chap. 1.14
Church of the New Testament, which has appointed the Angels to be Ministers
unto, and not to be Rulers over.

I might instance in other places, where the word world is taken for the Elect;
as Psalm. 22.27. All the ends of the world shall remember, and turn unto the
Lord; so the Apostle says, He was believed on in the world (or as the Greek
will bear it Tim. 3.16 (...) See the preposition (...) translated by Mat.
5.34, 35.
by the world.) So Joh. 1.29. The Lanb of God which takes away the sins of the
world; this must be of the Elect and Believers: for how does he take away the
sins of Reprobates, when they are damned for them.

Ob. But is it not said, God loved the world, (...).

A. Yes, God is said to love the world, and that shows that by the world is
not meant all the world, for other Scriptures say that God Ps. 5.5. and 11.5.
hates the wicked (or reprobate wicked) and that God Mal. 1.3 To. 9.13.
hated Esau. God is not capable of loving and hating the same person, for that
would argue both weakness and change, which far be it from us to think that
either should be in God.

Ob. But does God hate any of his creatures?

A. God does not hate them as they are his creatures (no not the Devils
themselves;) for their being, (but not their sin,) is from him: but as now by
their fall, and degenerated condition, they have enmity in their natures
against him, it is just for him to hate them also.

Ob. But does not God hate the Elect also before (and until) they believe.

A. Oh no; he loved them with an Jer. 31.3.2. Tim. 1.9
everlasting love, and this love of his, was the Ephesians. 1.4. To. 9.11, 12, 13.
cause of their election.

Ob. Doubtless Christ has taken away the sins of all; for be is said to be
the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, 1 John 2.2.

A. 1. The whole world, is ofttimes in Scripture, taken either for a great part
and number of the world, or for the nations of the world (the Gentiles) as the
Apostle Romans 1.8.
says, The faith of the Romans was spoken of throughout the whole world. So
Rev. 13.3
all the world wondered after the Beast. Mat. 24.14
This Gospel of the Kingdom (says Christ) shall be preached in all the
world. So the Jews said, the whole world is gone after him. And the Evangelist
says, Luke 2.1.
All the world came to be taxed. The Apostle John also says, 1 John 5.19
The whole world lies in wickedness, and the Rev. 12.9
devil deceives the whole world. The whole world, in these and such places,
cannot be understood of all, and every one in the world. But,

Secondly, That text may be expounded by another, which To. 3.25.
says, That propitiation is through faith in his ( i.e. in Christ's) blood. And
according to these Objectors Vid. A book called, The fountain of Freegrace, p.
4.
own opinions, their sins are not done away, nor they pardoned, or justified
till they do believe, and yet they say all the sins of all the world (yea
the sin of unbelief) are washed away in the blood of Christ. This is a
Riddle and Paradox, how they are done away, and yet imputed to men, how
unbeleefe is washed away, and yet men are damned for it. Sure they must either
be done away Heb. 10.12
perfectly, and for ever, or not at all: And if they be once pardoned, they are
so far from being imputed again to men, that the Lord Heb. 8.12
says, He will not remember them any more.

Ob. But some are said to be purged from their old sins (which shows that their
sins were done away) and yet they were blind still.

A. Purging must here be taken one of these three ways, as its taken in
Scripture:

1. For Justification and forgiveness of sins, as Heb. 1.3. and 10.2. Psalm.
79.9. and 51.7. Or,

2. For true and real Sanctification, as Job. 15.3. Esa. 1.25. Heb. 9.25. Tit.
2.14. Or,

3. For an outward and seeming sanctification, as Ezekiel. 24.13. Lev. 12.7. Or as
the Apostle Heb. 9.13
speaks, a purifying of the flesh. If you take purging in either of the two
former senses, then you must either conclude, that those who are truly and
really justified and sanctified may be blind ( i.e. miserable) again, To.
^.30. Act. 20.32
contrary to the Scriptures, or else that these were not quite blind, or
without the knowledge of Christ altogether; but that they were Christians who
could not see afareff, as the Apostles expression is, and so this text is
understood by some that are most knowing and spiritual. But this purging here
may rather be understood of an outward and seeming sanctification, and
holiness, which the Apostle seems to relate to, in the 2 Pet. 2.2 20.
next Chapter. If (says he) after they have escaped the pollutions of the
world, etc. they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is
worse with them then the beginning. These men had indeed a sanctification in
show, and they seemed to be made holy by the blood of Jesus, and through the
knowledge of him to escape the pollutions of the world, but yet they were still
blind and unholy, as the Luke 8.13.15.
stony ground is said to believe, yet it was never good ground. So Judas seemed
to be a true Christian, and believer, but Ioh. 6.64
never was so really, and indeed.

Ob. But the false Teachers who brought in damnable heresies, are said to deny
the Lord that bought them; How could be have bought them, unless he bad dyed
for them?

A. 1. This word them, may have reserence to the people, as well as to the
false Teachers. Mark the text, (...) and (...) declare a distinction of
persons.
There were false Prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false
Teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying
the Lord that bought them (viz. the people) and bring upon them selves ( viz.
the false Teachers) swist destruction. But

Secondly, If it be understood of the false Teachers themselves, then the
meaning may be this, that they seemed, in regard of outward profession, to be
such as Christ had bought. And the Scriptures speak often of things not (only)
as they are; but as they seem to be. Heb. 15.2.
As Christ says, Every branch in me that bears not fruit, be takes away,
etc these could not be real and true branches in Christ, which did not bear
fruit, for Christ says immediately afterward ver. 5.
he that abides in me and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit! so
then these, were but seeming branches of Christ, for he further says, If any
man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, he casts away none but
such as did not abide in him, as our Savior elsewhere says, Mat 15.13
every plant which his heavenly Father has not planted should be rooted up. So
many are said to be Ioh: 6.66
Christ's Disciples, and yet to leave him, and to follow him no more, and many
are said, to Luke 8.13
believe and yet to fall away; had these been true Disciples, and Believers,
they would never have left Christ, and fallen away: but these, were like those
of whom the Apostle John 1 Ioh. 2.19
writes, they went out from among us, says he, because they were not of us,
for had they been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. There be
many more instances of this nature. As Christ says, from him that has not,
shall be taken away even that which he has, so it is in Mar: 4 25
Mark; but Luk: 8.18
Luke relating the same story, says, that whosoever has not, from him shall
be taken away that, which he seems to have, (...).
or, (as the Greek is) that which he So the verb (...) is transtated Lu:
10.36. and 12.40 51. and 13.1. Jo. 5.39, 45
thinks to have.

So Ahaz is 2 Chro. 28 23.
said to sacrifice to the gods of Damascus who smote him, these were no Gods
but Idols, but he thought them to be gods indeed: In like manner these false
Teachers might be (as Paul speaks) somewhat in show and in appearance, As we
see by woeful experience in our days that many who seem to be true Christians
do now deny Christboth in word, and practice.
and like the true Teachers of Christ, and so esteemed of by the people, as if
Christ had dyed for them, yea, doubtless they might judge so of themselves.

Thirdly, the Apostle Jude (who wrote to the same people) Jude. v. 4.
says, that these false Teachers denied the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus
Christ. And that word (...) Lord, in Peter is usually given unto the Lu: 2.28,
29. Act. 4.24. with 27
father and signifies rather a 1 Timothy 6.1 2 and 2.2.21.1. Pet: 2 18.
Master and Ruler, then a Lord and Savior. And so the meaning may be this,
that these false Teachers did deny God, and Christ. who had freed them from
outward corruption (for the word bought is taken for Rev: 14.3
outward redemption) and in that fense; Jude 4, 5.
the Apostle Jude seems to carry it, for he paralels this with the deliverance
of the children of Israel out of Egypt.

Obj. If Christ has not dyed for the sins of all, how can the Gospel be
preached, and tendered to all?

A. The true and right way of preaching, and tendering the Gospel unto all, is
not by telling every man, that Christ dyed for him. But the preaching of the
Gospel consists,

1. In proclaiming, publishing, and maintaining, those things (which are now
set down in the history of the Called the kingdom of God, Iu 4.43. and 9 21
Mat: 10.7
New Testament) Act: 5.41 ^8.2.12. and 28.23, ^ Ti. 3.16.
concerning Christ. As that he is the Ioh: 3.35.
Son of God, the true Christ, and the Act: 2.20, 36. and 17.3
promised Messiah. Also concerning his Luk: 1.35. flu: 2.10, 11
conception, Lu: 2.10, 11
birth, Mat: 3.11
baptism, Act: 2.22 23, 24 and 10 38, 39, 40.
miracles, his works, and his walking: his death, returrection, ascension, and
coming to judgment. And how all the promises made unto the Fathers concerning
him, are Act 13.32, 33. Luk: 1 54, 55.
fulfilled unto us their children.

2. To preach the Gospel is to set forth the greatness, and freeness of the
Ioh: 3.16 Rom: 5.8.
Fathers love, and Christ's love, in all that was done, and suffered by Christ,
for the justification and salvation of sinners:

3. To preach the Gospel is to Mar. 16.15 Col: 1.23.
tell all persons (indefinitely, and generally, without limitation, or
exception,) this glad tidings, and good news, that though they have broken the
Law in every point, and brought themselves, under the curies thereof, so that
they come short of the glory of God, and cannot thereby possibly be saved; yet
if they come to Christ This is called a preaching of repentance and forgivenes
of sins throught Christ's name, Lu: 24.47. Ac: 13.38.
and believe in him, and repent, and turn from their sins, they shall receive
forgiveness offins, and everlasting life.

4. To preach the Gospel, is to declare the free, and gracious promises of
Gods Covenant, made to finners, as sinners, viz. that he, i.e. God, will Heb.
8.10
put his Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts, that he will be
to them a God, and they shall be to him a people. That he Ez: 36.26 27.
will give them a new heart, and take the stony heart cut of their flesh, etc.
And that he will put his spirit within them, and cause them to walk in his
Statutes. This was the practice of Ioh: 6.45 Mat: 12.21
Jesus Christ himself, and of his Act: 2 17 and 13.47.
Apostles in their preaching, to encourage sinners to believe and turn.

5. To preach the Gospel, is to open, and apply all those great, and glorious
Ephesians: 3:8. Col: 2.2^
mysteries, concerning the Father, Son, and Spirit: and concerning the Saints
happy estate, in grace, and glory. As also how they are to live by faith, To
teach duties, to God and men, in a gospel way is to preach the Gospel Re: 15.19
with Ac. 20 27.
through love, in obedience, and conformity to their Father, and Lord, and to
perform all duties toward their brethren, and those without (or the world)
according to what is written in the Scriptures.

Obj. But men will have cause to doubt, and to be discouraged from believing,
unless that they hear that Christ dyed for every man.

A. It is sufficient to tell men in general terms, that Christ dyed for
sinners, for the ungodly, for enemies, for the rebellious, for the world; yea,
for all and every man that will believe in him. Here is a door wide, and open
enough, Those that preach that Christ died for every man, yet preach that none
shall be saved but those that believe; and those that do not speak so
particularly, but generally, that Christ dyed for simiers, yet preach that all
that do believe shall be saved, which in effect is one and the same.
and a way, free and large enough for any man (be he what he will) to come in.
For the word Sinner comprehends all kind of Sinners what soever: And may not a
Sinner from hence argue thus; If Christ has dyed for Sinners, for the ungodly,
etc. then why not for me, for I am a sinner, and one that is ungodly.

Ob. Oh but the Sinner may say, true Sir, Christ dyed for sinners, and for the
ungodly, but if he dyed not for all sinners, I may be one of those for whom he
did not dye.

A. 1. A Sinner should not object so, for he does but debar himself thereby
from partaking of the grace of Christ tendered to him, and such an objection is
to be looked on as a temptation, or arising from the souls grand sin, and
Christ's great enemy unbelief. But put the case one should so object, yet this
is a sufficient ground to resolve him, that if he does believe, he shall have a
part in the death of Christ, and be saved. Prisoners adjudged to die, and
having pardons tendered to them, do not question whether those pardons were
intended and granted for all in their condition; but they upon the first sight
and hearing thereof, strive and grapple hard to catch hold upon such a pardon:
even so sinners, when pardon of sins and salvation is tendered and preached to
them, they should, like Jacob, strive to have the blessing; or like the women
that strove for the child, they should cry, It is my pardon, My pardon, and
not, Is it for me, Is it for me?

2. The same objection might have been made by the Jews, when Christ said,
That Mat. 22.14.
many were called, but few chosen, and that Mat. 7.13 14.
many did go in at the wide gate, and few at the narrow; also that Luke 13.24.
many should seek to enter in, and should not be able; that be Joh. 17.9
prayed nor for the world, etc. The like objection may be also now made against
many expressions in the Apostles writings; As that, some Ephesians. 1.4.
Were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world, and others Iud. v. 4.
ordained of old to condemnation.

Q. Whether were the Heirs of salvation (or the Elect) always under the
Covenant of grace?

A. As elect, and considered in Christ, they were doubtless before the
foundation of the world, and ever since, under the Covenant of grace. For the
Covenant which God made with Christ before the foundation of the world, was a
Covenant of grace, and this Covenant (as I showed before) was made with him, as
he was a Mediator, for, and in the behalf of the heirs of salvation. And
therefore does the Apostle say, That Tit. 1.2.
God promised eternal life, and 2 Timothy 1.9
gave his grace unto such before the world began.}

Obj. But did not they, as well as others, sin in Adam, and thereby and ring
themselves under the Covenant of works?

A. Its true, they did To: 5:12, 16, 18.
sin in Adam, and so did deserve to come under the Covenant of works, and the
curses thereof, as well as the damned themselves. But yet Gods former Covenant,
and act of grace, (made with Christ concerning them) stayed, and stopped,
legal proceedings, and execution against them. And instead of bringing them to
a judicial trial, according to their deserts: their sin was transferred, and
put upon the account of Christ. As when the children of a King, break the
Statute of their King and Father, deserve to be punished, as well as any other
Subjects, yet their faults are remitted, and they pardoned, upon that ground of
relation, between him and them, so that they never come under actually the
penalty and execution of that Statute Law which they break.

Obj. But the Elect by nature, and before they do believe are the children of
wrath, and not the children of God, Ephesians. 2.2.

A. 1. It is true, that the Elect are the children of wrath by nature as well
as others, till they do believe. But withal, it is as true, that they are the
children of God by grace. As Christ was a son of Gods love, and an object of
his delight in In the confideration of a Son. Mat: 17:5: Joh: 3:35:
one consideration, so he was both an object and a subject (if I may so say)
of his Ps. 88:16: Mat: 26.46
wrath in In the consideration of a Surety. 2 Cor. 5:21. Gal: 3:13:
another sense, and consideration.

2. There is a dstinction, and difference to be made, between the state, and
the persons of men: it is undeniably true, that the state of nature is a state
of wrath; but yet the persons in that state (I mean the Elect) may be and are
persons of love. As Absaloms rebellion against his father David, was an Act
deserving punishment, and his state a state of wrath, yet his person, was still
2 Samuel 18 33. and 19.4
affected and loved by David.

Obj. But it does not appear, that the Elect are the children of God, before
they do believe.

A. Yes, the Scriptures prove it. As for example, the By this Prodigal was
meant the Gentiles called Publicans and sinners. Luke 15.1
Prodigal was a son, whilst yet dead, and his father so ownes him. For this my
Luke 15.24
son (says he) was dead and is alive. And again (speaking to his eldest son)
this thy v. 32.
brother was dead and is alive. So these words (applied to Christ) Heb. 2.13
Behold I, and the children which God has given me: these Children were the
Elect, that Christ suffered for, and presented to his Father. That Ioh. 11.52
Prophecy was also true (though spoken by a false man) that he ( i.e. Christ)
should gather together in one, all the children of God that were scattered
abroad. Hereby you see, that all the Elect, are accounted, and termed the
children of God, as well those uncalled, as those that are already called.

Ob. But the Lord says of the Gentiles, that he will To. 9.23
call them his people, which were not his people, which plainly shows that God
did not account them to be his people before they were called.

A. The meaning is, that they were not his people by outward profession, as the
Jews were: but doubtless they were his people by To. 11.2
fore knowledge and Ephesians. 1.4 15. 1 Pet. 1.2.
election, as our Savior said of the same people, Other sheep I have which are
not of this fold: Here mark, he ownes them to be his Sheep, though they were
not as yet brought into the same sold.

Ob. But the Apostle says, that we are all the children of God by Gal. 3.26
faith in Christ Jesus: so that until we do believe, we are not his children.

A. Men may be said to be the children of God several ways, as by So are all
Angels and all men, Job 1.6. and 2.1. Mal. 2 10.
Creation, by Ephesians. 1.5. (...), having sealed us unto the adoption. See Romans 9.4.
Election, and Adoption, and by Gal. 3.26
Faith, and Jam. 1.18 Ioh. 3.3. Mat. 18.3
Regeneration. In the latter of these senses, men are not the children of God,
till they do receive the Spirit, and believe, yet Gal. 4.6
because they are children, God gives his Spirit unto them. It is 1 John 3.24
Romans 8.16
impossible that any should know themselves to be Gods children till they are
converted, and do really and actually believe. Yet doubtless God may (and
does) know them to be his children long before; and if none could be Gods
children save only by faith, how then are those saved Infants, who do not
actually believe, (for ought we can gather from Scripture) the children of God.

Q. Can men be saved any other way but by the Covenant of Grace?

A. No sure, for men must be saved either by the Covenant of grace, or by the
Covenant of works (for there be but those two ways) and the Apostle says,
That Gal. 2.16
no man is justified by the works of the Law. So To. 3.28.
elsewhere he says, That a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the
Law, and that Romans 4.6
righteousness is imputed without works. If then a man cannot be justified and
saved by the Covenant of works, and there be no other way but the Covenant of
grace, of necessity men must be saved that way, and by that Covenant, or not
at all.

Ob. But why cannot men be saved by the Covenant of works?

A. Because the Covenant of works, requires to salvation, that which no man
can perform, viz. To. 10.6.
personal, Gal. 3.10
perfect, and Jam. 2.10
perpetual obedience.

Ob. But may not men be saved partly by the Covenant of works, and partly by
the Covenant of grace?

A. No, for if it is of grace, then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is
no more grace; but if it be of works, then it is no more grace. So that it is
inconsistent to grace to have works joined and added unto it, in the point of
justification and salvation, Romans 11.6.

Q. Are men then saved only by grace?

A. Oh yes, only, and altogether by grace; for the whole way and path of
salvation, is paved with the grace of God the Father, and the grace of Jesus
Christ; the grace of love, the grace of good will, the grace of mercy, and the
grace of Christ his merits and obedience. So that from everlasting, to
everlasting, from the first minute of time, that God intended men's salvation,
to the last moment of Eternity (if I may so express it) there was nothing, and
there will be nothing but grace in men's salvation; To. 11.5
their predestination, and election, their 2 Timothy 1.9 Gal. 1.15.
calling, and vocation, their To. 3.24. Tit. 3.7.
redemption, and justification, their To. 9.26
adoption, and Ezekiel. 36 25, 26.
sanctification, their To. 5.2.
confirmation, and consolation, their 2 Cor. 12 9.
preservation and supportation, their To. 5.17
perseverance and Tit. 3.5.
glorification, flows all from free grace, Ephesians. 1.7. and 2.7.
riches, and exceeding riches of grace. Nothing moved God to will men's
salvation, but his good Pleasure, nothing persuaded God to send his Son Jesus
Christ, God gives all to men does all for men, and works all in men freely.
Hos. 14.4. To. 8.32. Rev. 21 6. and 22.18. Esa. 26.12 and 55.1, 2.
to work men's redemption, but his mere and dear love. Observe, here is
nothing of self-will, nothing of self-righteousnesse, nothing of selfe-power,
neither foreseen faith, nor foreseen works, no qualifications, nor
conditions, no preparations, nor performances, no duties, nor deserts of men,
having so much as avoice, the least hand, or place, in their salvation. The
first and the last stone, yea all the materials in this glorious building of
men's salvation, is hewne out of the Quarry of Gods unspeakable Grace.

Oh soul, consider how the God of grace owned thee, how the Lord of grace
bought thee, how the Word of grace called thee, how the Herb of grace healed
thee, and how the Spirit of grace wrought in thee, and sealed thee; yea when
thou did slight, and reject grace, then (like Hester) thou did obtain
grace above thousands; cry therefore, Grace, Grace, and say, I had perished,
and been damned for ever, had it not been for Gods grace, for where my sin
did abound, his grace did abound much more: and when I was exceedingly
graceless, the Lord was more abundantly, and exceedingly gracious.

Ob. If men are saved only by grace, how then is it said, that Luke 7.50
faith, To. 8.24
hope, the 1 Co. 15.2
Gospel, and 1 Pet. 3.21
Baptism, do save men?

A. I. Faith, hope, the Gospel, and Baptism, are all Ephesians. 2.8 2 The. 2.16 1
Cor. 2.12
fruits, and effects of Gods grace, and given freely unto men, and so included
in grace; and therefore to be saved by any of these, is to be saved by grace,
for these are of grace: But,

Secondly, Faith, hope, the Gospel, Baptism, etc. are considered as the
isntrumental means of men's salvation. As the Apostle 2 The. 2.13
says, That God has chosen men to salvation through sanctification of the
Spirit, and belief of the truth. Mark, he does not say, for sanctification,
and belief of the truth, (as making those the causes of men's salvation) but
through sanctification, and belief of the truth, making those the means of
salvation. As God has ordained that men should live by food, and raiment; yet
food and raiment is not the proper cause of life, but the ordinary means
(being blessed) for the preservation of life.

Ob. If men be saved only by grace, why then does the Lord command men to
seek, strive, run, fight, work, and the like.

A. The Lord does not give these exhortations, as if he intended that men
should be saved, or further their own salvation by observing and obeying them;
(for God says To. 9.16
else where, That it is not in him that wills, nor in him that runs, but
in the Lord that shows mercy.) But these exhortations are to be considered
either as belonging to unbeleevers, and sinners; or unto believers and Saints.
When they are spoken unto sinners, then they are to be understood in the same
way as the Law is to be understood (yea urged upon the same ground) sei^ to
show unto men what they should do, Most exhortations do belong unto Saints
(because they are fittest and ablest to perform them) as appears in the
Epistles, which were written to Sts. Romans 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.2. Ephesians. 1.1. Phil. 1.1.
though they cannot do it. But when these exhortations are spoken unto Saints,
they are to be looked upon as Gospel duties, which Saints are to perform; not
to be justified, but because they are justified; not to gain Gods love, but
to show their love to him; not to get and procure life, but because they are
already certain and sure of life. Further consider, that godly exhortations,
are seldom or never single, but commonly (if not always) joined with suitable
promises. And God does not only put his people upon duties, but he also Zach.
10.12. Ioh. 14 13 14.
ingages himself to help them to perform them.

Q. Whether does God tender the Covenant of grace to all, yea or no?

A. Doubtless, God tenders the Covenant of grace, or the Gospel (which is the
Act. 20.24.
same) to all Mat. 28.19. Tit. 2.11. Mat. 24.14.
Nations, and to Mar. 16.15. Act. 13 10.
every creature; and it is the mind of God, that every Messenger and Minister
of his, should declare and publish this Covenant to all, without respect of
persons.

Q. Have any men of themselves (or naturally) a will, and power to receive and
believe this Covenant of grace (or the Gospel) when it is tendered unto them?

A. No surely, they have neither will nor power of themselves, and unless it
be Ioh. 3.27 and 6.65. and 15.5.
given them of God, it is impossible any should receive or believe it. For all
men by nature are Ier. 17.9, Job 21.14 Job. 5.40. 2 Per. 2.10
desperately wilful, 2 Cor. 3.5 Romans 5.6.
absolutely weak, and Genesis 6.5. and 8.21. Psalm. 10.4. See marg.
altogether wicked, having neither spiritual defire nor strength, neither
spiritual i e. Desires and affections, Eccl. 4.17 Psalm. 17.5.
feet to carry them to this grace, nor spiritual i. e. Power Pro. 3.27. Eccl.
9.10.
hands to receive this grace when it is brought and offered unto them. But as
the Apostle Romans 8.7
says, The carnal mind is enmity against God, it is not subject to the Law
of God, neither indeed can be.

Ob. If men have no will nor power to come to Christ, and to partake of him;
why then does Christ complain, that the Jews would not come to him? Joh. 5.40.

A. That does not import, that they had either will or power in themselves to
come unto him, but rather that there was an unwillingnesse or non-willingnesse
in them; so that it may be better called a public and negative will, then a
free will; for it had no pronenesse nor tendency at all in it to come to
Christ. But like that Mat 21.28.29.
son who was commanded to go to the Vineyard, that answered and said I will
not.

Ob. Why does Christ by his Spirit, invite men ( saying, Whosoever will, let
him come to the water of life) if they have no will, Rev. 22.17.

A. That is to encourage those poor souls, whom he had before made willing,
who were afraid to come unto him; or else he makes this general invitation,
that so none might object, and say, they were not called, nor invited: and this
agrees with the invitation of our Savior to the Jews, Ioh. 7.37
If any man thirst (says he) let him come unto me, and drink. Be sure of
this, that if any be willing to come unto Christ, that is more then mere
nature; and it may be truly said to such, (as Christ said to Simon Peter) That
flesh and blood has not wrought this in them. For as Christ said unto the
Leper, Mat. 8 3
I will be thou clean; so he must say unto men, I will that you be willing.
And poor weak sunners, had need say to Christ, as Christ said to his Father,
Mar. 14 7
Not as I will, but as thou will.

Ob. But how could the Apostle say, To will is present with me, unless be had
a willingness in him?

A. The Apostle did not speak or write those words, as the words of an
unconverted man, but as his Romans 7.18.
own words, and that upon his own experience after his conversion. Also the
same Apostle, does in Phil. 2.13
another place, acknowledge, That it is God that works both to will and to
do; and therefore it is not in man, of himself, either to will or to do that
which is good.

Ob. But God gives to every man a will, and makes every man willing.

A. First, if God gives to every man a will, and makes every man willing, then
1. This will and willingness is not in themselves naturally, and so it
deserves not to be called man's will any longer, but Gods will. But, 2. If God
has given this will to all, and made all willing, then doubtless, he has
converted all; for the chiefest part of conversion, does consist in the change
of the will.


Secondly, There is no Scripture that says God gives a will to all, or makes
all willing. But the Scripture speaks restrictively, rather then generally in
this point. As Psa. 110.3
thy people (not all) shall be willing in the day of thy power. So Christ Joh.
5.21
says, That he quickneth whom he will.

Ob. But as Christ is willing to save all, so he is also, to give and impart
all saving gifts, and graces unto all.

A. Christ is willing to save all, and he is very free to give, and very free
in his gifts, and graces; yet notwithstanding, he gives according to his good
pleasure. As a charitable man, wishes well to all poor people, yet he is free
to give his charity, to whom he pleases. And as it is Rev. 17.17.
said (in another case) Its God that puts it in men's bearts, to do his will:
So it may be said here, when God makes men willing, then they become willing,
and when God works power, then men are enabled, and not till then: for no man
(as Christ says) Ioh. 6.44
can come to him except the Father draw him. And no man can have a sanctified
will, till the Lord Iam. 1.18.
by his own will, begets it in him. Therefore you that are willing, oh, bless
and praise God, who has made you so! and you that are unwilling, pray and
wait, for the day of his power in which you shall be made willing.

Ob. But does not God give to every man some Talent or Talents, which if a man
did improve should be increased?

A. 1. Its very true, that God gives to Mat. 25.25.
every man some Talent or Talents, as to some, worldly and natural Talents (as
Wisdom, Wealth, Art, etc.) and to others, spiritual Talents, or 1 Cor. 12 8,
9, 10.
Gifts (as to Pray, Prophecy, Interpret, work Miracles, etc.) And
questionless, there is no man that improves his Talent so well, as he might
improve it. And God may upon the non-improvement of what we have, deny us
more; and where he finds us faithless in a little, its but meet that he
should deny us much. Also God may very justly damn men for not improving what
he gave them, and call them to an account, as a Lord does his faithless, and
unprofitable Steward. Therefore the very Heathens that had but the light of
Nature, will be To. 1.20, 21, and 2.15.
inexcusable at the day of judgment, for not walking and acting according to
To. 2.15
that light and instinct in them, though they never heard Scripturall Law, nor
Gospel. But yet,

2. Observe this, that to sin against the Law of Nature only, is enough to
damn men, yet the improving of the Law of Nature, is not sufficient to save
men. For there is a Ioh. 17.3
knowledge of Christ, Ioh. 3.36 and 8.24.
faith on him, and Psalm. 2.12 Luke 19.27
obedience to him, required as absolutely necessary to salvation, and all
these, they are free, and Covenant gifts graces bestowed on men, and given to
them according to the purpose and counsel, and by the free love, and special
grace of God.

Obj. But if God gives grace unto some, and not unto others, is he not partial
therein?

A. God is just in all his ways, and righteous in all his dealings, and
therefore cannot be partial, for he wrongs no man, but gives to every one
according as he pleases, only to some he gives better then their deserts (and
this is his merciful and gracious dealing) and to others according to their
deserts, and this is his righteous and just dealing. Mat. 20.15
And is it not lawful for him to do what he will with his own? This should
silence, and satisfy men, that for God to give grace to any, is to do for
them more then they could, or can deserve, and for God not to give grace to
others, is not to deal worse with them, then they deserve.

Quest: How did it stand with Gods justice, to make a Covenant of grace with
men?

A: God in making the Covenant of grace, at first, Justice and mercy doubtless
were typed out by the Cherubims wings that looked one toward another. Ex.
25.20.
had reference to the satis faction of his Justice, as well as to the setting
forth of his Mercy, though not from the hands of men yet from the hands of
Christ. For God promised at first, to Christ to show mercy, no otherwise then
Christ promised, to satisfy his justice: so that upon the account of Christ,
God made the Covenant of grace. As a man that makes and settles his estate upon
his Sons wife, and her children, upon some former consideration, and
agreement past between him and his Son, so does God by his Covenant of grace,
settle upon the Church (Christ's Spouse) and her children, the promised
inheritance, by virtue of the Zac: 6.13
Counsel (and Covenant) of peace, which was between them both.

Quest: Does the Covenant of grace (or the Gospel) require duties and works?

A. Oh yes, in a very Luk: 1.74 Rom: 6.4.
strict, and Ioh: 4 24. 1 Timothy: 4.12
spiritual manner, both to Act 20.21 Luk: 12.21
God, and Gal: 6.10
men: yea the Covenant of grace, requires some duties that the Covenant of
works and the Law requires not, as after I Will show, but yet there is a great
difference, in the two Covenants requiring of duties.

Quest: But wherein lies the difference between the Covenant of grace, and the
Covenant of works in requiring duties?

A. 1. The Covenant of grace (or the Gospel) does not require duties, and
works to justification, and salvation: for the Apostle Rom: 3. 24, 28. and 46.
concludes that a man is justified and saved by grace, without the works of
the Law, or legal duties: But the Covenant of works, or the Law Romans 10.5
requires works and legal duties, to justification and salvation.

2. The Covenant of grace does not only require duties, but also teaches men
where to find Ephesians: 6.10 2 Timothy 2.1.
strength to perform those duties; yea, promises as much as it Ez: 11.19 Heb
8.9.10
requires; But the Covenant of works, does neither promise, nor give power to
do the duties it requires.

3 The Covenant of grace does not require duties, upon pain and penalty of
damnation; but to Ioh: 14, 15 and 15.14.
express our love to Christ, But the Covenant of works, requires duties and
works upon Mat. 5.19
pain and penalty of damnation.

4. Though the Covenant of grace does require dutys, and performances, yet it
does not exact upon men, but where there is a sincere aim, and a true desire
in any, it is accepted, though they come very short in performance. As God
accepted of David's 1 K. 8.18.
intent to build him an House, and of Abraham's Heb: 11, 17
resolution to offer up his Son I saack. Lu 21.2.3
Two mi^es, nay, Mat: 10.42. It is not the gift, but the giver; not what is in
the hand, but what is in the heart, that God looks at:
a cup of cold water, is looked upon, and accepted by God, when it comes from
an honest and true heart. Yea, this is the voice and language, of the Covenant
of grace, that where there is first a willing mind, it is accepted, according
to that a man has, and not according to what he has not. But the Covenant of
works requires exact, perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience, and upon
the least transgression, and swerving from the commandment, it denounces that
most dreadful, and unmitigable curse. Gal: 3.10
cursed is every one, that continues not in all things that are written in the
book of the Law to do them. Do but compare both Covenants together and you
will find, that the Covenant of grace requires but Mat. 11.29
easy duties, and performances; but the Covenant of works requires, irksome,
toylsome, and chargeable duties, and performances.

Obj. Do you call plucking out the right eye, cutting off the right hand,
denying our selves, taking up the cross daily, etc. but easy duties?

A. 1. As Solomon Pro. 14.6. 1 Job. 5.3.
says, To him that bath understanding, knowledge is easy; so to them that are
spiritual, the Commandments of God are To: 7.22
easy and not grievous. For it is somewhat Cor. 5.14 and 11.8.
natural to a regenerate man to obey God, as it is to a wife, or a child to
obey the husband, or father.

2. The duties commanded in the Covenant of grace, are easy to believers,
because Christ performs them, in, and for them. As the Apostle Gal. 2.20
said, It is Christ that lives in me. Phil. 4.13
Again, says he, I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me.
The weight lies more heavy upon the shoulders of Christ, then upon men's
shoulders; Christus jubet, and juvat: litera jubetur, spiritu donatur.
as the care of providing for the family, is more upon the father, then upon
the children; and the husbandman is as much, and more concerned in the
fruitfulness of his field, then his servant, though the servant works also.

Q. But does not the Covenant of grace also threaten Believers (that are under
it) if they be disobedient, and commit sin?

A. Yea sure, there be threatenings that do belong to the Covenant of grace,
(or the Gospel) and these threatenings concern those Believers that are under
it; but yet they are not such threatenings as are the threatenings of the Law,
viz. threatenings of damnation.

Q. What then are those threatenings of the Covenant of grace, that concern
believers?

A. God Psa. 89.31, 32. 2 Samuel 7.14
says (concerning believers) That if they break his Statutes, and keep not
his Commandments, he will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their
iniquities with stripes.

Ob. Does the Lord then chastise his own children for their sins?

A. 1. Though most commonly Gods indulgence, Number. 23 21. Exo. 34.6.
affection, and tenderness to his children be so great, that he passes by
millions of failings in them, without Iam. 1.5
so much as upbraiding or reproving them, much less correcting or chastising
them. And though at other times God does correct them, but not Job 1.8.
at all for their sins (as he did Job) but to Joh. 9.3
glorify himself, and to make them Heb. 12.10.
partakers of his holiness; yet,

2. Without doubt, God does sometimes chastise his children for their sins;
as he did the Corinthians, for their unworthy and unholy partaking of the Lords
Supper. For the Apostle says, For this cause many are weak and sickly among
you, and many are fallen asleep. So Christ threatened the Churches of Rev. 2.16
Pergamus, v. 20.22.
Thiatyra, and Chap. 3.16
Laodicea.

Ob. But what ways and kinds does the Lord use to chastise his children?

A. 1. Sometimes in their souls, by Psalm. 51.8, 9.10, 11.
withdrawing, or witholding the sweet presence, and powerful working of his
gracious and free Spirit; whereby their souls are filled with sorrow, trouble,
and terror; insomuch that they often cry out, like the Psalm. 77.9
Prophet, Has God forgotten to be gracious? has he in anger shut up his
tender mercies?

2. Sometimes the Lord chastises his children in their bodies, with Psalm.
38.7, 8.
sickness, and weaknesses, as you heard before of the Corinthians.

3. Sometimes the Lord chastises them in their children, friends, and estates;
as he did 2 Samuel 12 14, 15.
David, 1 Samuel 3 12.4.13.
Eli, and others.

4. Sometimes the children of God may be 2 These. 3.14.
suspended, and excommunicated out of the society of Saints, cast out of the
Church, and delivered unto Satan, as the 1 Cor. 5.5
incestuous person was, who notwithstanding doubtless was a 2 Cor. 2.6, 7, 8.
true believer.

Ob. How does it consist with Gods love, that he should correct and chastise
his children?

A. Oh consider! that Gods chastisements, are but fatherly Remembrances, and
special signs of his love. As the Apostle says, Whom the Lord loves he Heb.
12.6. (...). the Greek word signifies as well instruction, as correction so the
Hebrew word musar, signifies. Prove. 3.12
chasteneth, and scourges every son whom he receives. The Lord corrects his
own children to show his care of them, and also because they are not to be 1
Cor. 11.32. Jer. 30.11.
condemned with the world; therefore they should not set light by his
correction, as the (...), Heb. 12.5.
phrase is. God oftentimes leaves the wicked and ungodly Job 21.9
unpunished: And its one of the greatest judgments, for God to give a man his
full Hos. 4.17 Pro. 14.14. As Abraham, its probable suffered Ishmael to
persecute Isaac, because Ishmael was to depart, and Isaac to abide. So does God
suffer the wicked to persecute his children. God called Ephraim his dear son,
when he was under chastisement. Ier. 31.28.
scope in sin, and its a sign that God cares not for such a man that he
leaves uncorrected: And in this, God deals as men use to do, viz. to have a
stricter eye, and hand upon their children then upon strangers; because they
intend that their children shall abide in the house, (and enjoy a fathers
portion) but that strangers shall be cast out.

Ob. But how can God correct his children for their sins, seeing Christ has
made satisfaction for them?

A. Be confident of this, that God does not chastise his children, because he
is unsatisfied for their sins, or dissatisfied with their persons: For he
has said, that he has found a ransom, and that he is Mat. 3.17 and 17.5.
well-pleased in Christ, and does much delight in them through him, and that
their sins are not Romans 4.6
imputed unto them. As a natural father does not scourge his children, Saints
should account it a great honor to have God lay his hands upon them. As some
formerly accounted it an honor to be killed by the hands of Hercules or Aeneas.
because he is unreconciled to them, or because that should make satisfaction
for their faults, but because that way may prove advantageous to his children
for the time to come. So says the Apostle, The Lord corrects his children that
they may be partakers of his holiness: And the Prophet Esa. 27.9.
says, By this shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged.

Q. Does the Covenant of grace, or the Gospel, give any liberty to sin, or
any encouragement for men to continue therein?

A. Oh no; but it does Tit. 2.11.
teach, and should teach all men, to deny all ungodliness, worldly and wicked
lusts. Rom 6.1 14, 15.
What shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid. He that
sins against the grace and Gospel of Christ, declares he has no grace, yea
such a one makes himself ten times more graceless, then, if he had never
heard the Gospel.

Ob. But there be many that say your preaching of free grace does give liberty
(and many take liberty thereby) to sin.

A. 1. The preaching of free grace, does not give liberty to sin; for then
Christ's preaching, and his Apostles preaching, did give liberty to sin. For
none ever preached grace so Lu. 4.22 Mat. 9.13. Lu. 15.1, 2 and 1 Cor. 15.3.
Ubi pater familias est largus, ibi dispensator, non debet esse avarus.
freely to sinful men as they did: And shall the Master be so free-hearted and
full-handed, and the servant nigard of what is not his own, but his Masters?

2. Suppose some do abuse the grace and Gospel of God, must not therefore this
Grace and Gospel be preached? Was the Manna to be withheld from the many
thousands of Israel (that wanted it) because some scornful men Number. 11.6
slighted it, or because some unbeleeving men abused it? Shall water be kept
from the thirsty, because mad men drown themselves therein? or shall wine be
denied to the sad, and sorrowful, because it makes some unsober? The Gospel
is, and must be, (Though accidentally) the 2 Cor. 2.16.
savor of death to some, as well as the savor of life to others.

As a sick man (whose stomach is weak and ill) when he has eaten meat becomes
ficker; so a sinful man when he has heard the Gospel, may become more
sinful, yet as the cause of the sick man's illness was not the meat, but for
want of stomach, and strength, to digest it; so for want of faith to believe,
and power to obey the Gospel, men become worse by it.

3. Consider this, that there were in the Apostles days many wanton, loose;
carnal, and ungodly Professors, that did Jud. v. 4.
turn the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ into lasciviousness; and thereby did
cause the true ways, and servants of God, to be evil spoken of. So there may
be (and doubtless are) many in these days, that tread in the steps of those
ungodly men, (as the Spirit Rev. 2.14
speaks of some who held the doctrine of Balaam (many hundreds of years after
Balaams death) yet the Churches, and Saints of Christ, do utterly hate and
abhor the vile, and wicked practices of such men; and they refuse to have any
fellowship with such, that they may be ashamed; and doubtless, shame, sorrow,
Romans 3.8 2 Pet. 2.3.
and damnation, will befall such men, as make Gods grace a stirrup for to help
them up into the saddle of sin.

Ob. But it is no wonder, that these men do abuse the grace of God, seeing
there is a general tolleration granted them.

A. The Churches, and Saints of Christ, do not hold, nor grant a General
Tolleration; witness the several books which are As Mr. Tho. Goodwins Sermon
before the Parl. called The Interest etc. So M. Borroughs heart division. Also
many others.
extant. This is therefore the opinion of the Churches, that though they are
tender in censuring, and judging, such as differ from them in matters of
Discipline, and Government, or other Circumstantialls. Yet they do not, nor
cannot approve of, or maintain either the principles, or practices of
Heretics (nor of Schismatics truly so called.) Much less can they join with
such men, for they deny them fellowship, yea such as deny the head Christ, and
walk ungodlily, they excommunicate, and cast out of the Churches, according to
the Tit. 3.10 1 Timothy 1.19, 20. 1 Cor. 5.5. Mat. 10.16, 17. The Churches of
Saints (called Independents) are neither for toleration, of heresy, nor any
gross iniquity.
Scripture, and then leave them to the Civil Magistrate. And what can (or
would) Presbyterians do more, unless they would have the power of the
Magistrate into their hands: Therefore let them not father that falsehood upon
Independents (so called) that they are for a Tolleration of all Sects and
Opinions, whereas they plead only for such as are truly conscientious, and
not at all for those that are carnal, and corrupt.

Objection. But yet these Freegratians (or those that preach Freegrace) do
altogether neglect the Law in their preaching, (nay they do utterly reject,
and destroy the Law) and this is the cause why so many do run into errors and
wickedness in these days.

A. As it was in the days of Christ, and his Apostles, so is it now, for then
they Mat 5.17
thought (especially the Pharisees) that Christ did intend to destroy the Law.
So they said of Stephen, that he Act. 6.13
spoke blasphemous words against the Law. Also of Paul, that he Act. 18 13
taught men to worship contrary to the Law, and that he taught Act. 21.28
against the Law. Wherefore having (in some measure) cleared the Gospel, and
Covenant of works, (being the first part of this Book) I now come to vindicate,
and clear the Law, or the Covenant of works, which is the second part of the
Book.

The second Part of this Treatise. Wherein, Most, of the material Questions
concerning the LAW, are briefly handled and cleared.
Question.

HOW is the word Law to be understood, and in what sense is it taken in the
Scriptures?

Answer

1 It is taken for the whole Word (and revealed Will) of God. As Psalm. 19.7.
The Law of God is perfect converting the soul, so Jam. 1.25. Whosoever looks
into the perfect Law of Liberty, etc. here (and in See more Psalm. 37.31 and
119.1, 70. Pro. 6.23. and 28.9.
several other places) by the Law is meant the Word of God in general. Then

2 By the Law (sometimes) is meant all the books of the Old Testament, as John
10.34. Is it not written in your Law, I said ye are gods? so John. 15.25. This
(says Christ) is come to pass, that the word might be fulfilled which is
written in their Law.

3 The Law is taken also more restrictively for the five books of Moses as
Mat. 11.13. John 1 45. and 12.34. Gal. 3.21: and so comprehending the
Ceremonial, and Judicial Laws, as well as the Moral Law, see 1 Cor. 9.18.
Gal. 5.3. Ex. 21.1.

4 By the Law is meant the Moral Law, called in Scripture the Ten Words or
(usually by us) the Deu. 4.14 and 10.4.
Ten Commondements or Decalogue, and in this sense, it may be applied either to
the Romans 3.21 Gal. 3.10, 11, 12 Deuteronomy 33.4. Joh. 1.17.
whole Ten Commandments, or to Rom 13.8
one Table, or to Rom 7.7
one particular Commandment thereof.

Quest. How many Laws did God give unto men?

Answ. Three, the Natural Law, or the Law of Nature; the Mosaicall Law, or the
Law of Moses; and the Evangelicall Law, or the Law of Christ. The first of
these Laws was given to Adam in his innocent, and sinlesse condition; the
second was given unto men in their fallen, and sinful condition; and the third
was given unto men, either to bring them out of their sinful condition, or
being brought out of that estate, to guide them on to their eternal happy
condition.

Quest. Wherein did the natural Law, or the Law which God gave unto Adam in
his innocence consist?

Answ. 1. In that inscription written in his heart, whereby (doubtless) he
knew how to serve and worship God, his Creator.

2 In that vocal prohibition of eating the forbiden fruit, Genesis 2.17.

Object. But how does it appear that there was any Law, written in the heart
of Adam in his innocence?

A. 1. Because that even the sinful posterity of Adam (who had neither the
written Law of Moses, nor the Gospel yet) had, and have this Law written in
their hearts, their consciences bearing witness, and their hearts accusing or
excusing one another, Rem. 2.14, 15.

2 By the knowledge that he had in the nature of all creatures and therbyto
name al creatures according to their natures, Genesis 2.20, 23.

3 Because that Adam and his children did offer unto the Lord, and this must be
either from inward dictates and teachings in nature, or from vocal commands;
but we read not of any vocal commands that God gave to Adam thereto.

Obj. But did God give laws to none but unto Adam before Moses time?

Answ. Yes, unto Gen 6.13
Noah (and doubtless to many others) before the flood, and also to Gen 26.5
Abraham, and the Patriarcks, after the flood till the time of Moses, and these
laws are called (by the godly and learned) Positive Laws.

Qu. Was there included in that prohibition to Adam (that he should not eat
of the forbidden fruit) all the Moral Law, or Ten Commandments, afterward
given to Moses?

A. Though the Scripture does not affirm that, neither can it be easily
inferred thence, nor clearly proved, yet it is probable he had written in his
nature the substance of the Ten Commandments.

Qu. Why did God give a law, or laws unto men?

A. To show his own Sovereignty, and his creatures duty.

Qu. How many parts are there in the Laws of God?

A. Three, a Ex 20.3, 4, 5, 7 etc.
mandatory part, a Ex 19.5 Ephesians 6, 2
promisary part, and a Genesis 2.17 Lev 26.16 17, 18.
penal part: the first showing the power, the second the goodness, and the
third the justice of God.

Qu. Why did God give the Moral Law or Ten Commandments, seeing he had before
written the Law in men's hearts?

A. Though the Law was writter at first in the heart of Adam, and though the
fallen posterity of Adam, had, Why the Moral Law was given.
(and still have) some relics of that Law remaining in their hearts; yet it
was grown so dymme, and dark that in a manner it was deleated, and blotted out
by the sins of men: insomuch that the Apostle accounted that time between
Adam and Moses, as a time wherein there was no Law, for says he until the Law
( i. e. the Moral Law) sin was in the world, Romans 5.13. But more particularly,
God gave the Moral Law,

First, because of transgressions, as the Apostle (in answer to such a Question
tacitly propounded) says, the Law was added because of transgressions until
the seed (i. e. Christ) should come, Gal. 3.19. For the better understanding of
this consider,

1 That the Law was given to discover sin, for Rom 3:20
by the Law is the knowledge of sin. And though Rom 5:13
sin was in the world before the Law, yet sin was so veiled, and covered; that
men, when they did commit sin, they scarce knew that they sinned. We have the
Apostle Paul's testimony and experience of this, where he Rom 7:7
says, that he had not known sin but by the Law, for I had not known lust,
(says he) except the Law had said thou shall not cover. Nay there would be no
sin were it not for a Law; for the Law gives (if I may so term it) a being
unto sin; and therefore is called the 1 Cor 15:5
strength of sin: for if a man should swear, covet, or kill, and there
should be no Law prohibiting the same, doubtless it would not be evil (for
the Law makes it evil.) So men when they do commit sin, if they be ignorant
of the Law against which they sinned, they cannot come to see and know their
sins, therefore the Law is the glass or discoverer of sin, and where there
is no Law, there is no i. e. No knowledge of transgression. Rom 4.15
transgression.

Obj. But has the Law of it self power to discover sin?

A. No, not of it self, without it be applied by the Spirit, for Paul thought
himself Phil 3.6
blameless (as concerning the Law) before his conversion, But when the Rom 7.9
Commandment came in spirit and power, then sin appeared, as sin to him.

Obj. But does the Moral Law discover unto men all their sins?

A. Yes, All the sins committed against that Law, but not every sin that a man
is guilty of; for the sin of unbeleife (or not beleiving in Christ) which is
the sin Joh. 6.29 and 16.9. 1 John 3.23 Neither does the Moral law teach men to
deny their own righteousness.
against the Gospel, is discovered by the Gospel, and not by the Law.

Obj. How does it appear that the Law does not discover the sin of un
belief, or not believing in Christ?

A. Because the Law does not command faith in Christ as he is Mediator,
neither can any man possibly preach Christ out of the Moral Law: therefore it
is impossible that unbeleife against him, should be known, or apprehended by
that Law.

2 The Law as it does discover sin, so also it does aggravate sin, or make
sin (as the Apostle Rom 7.13
says) exceeding sinful. The Law does awaken, and revive, and unkennell sins
and make them take hold upon a man's soul. As the Prophet David Ps. 40.12
said, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look
up: Or as the Apostle To 7.8, 9
said, without the Law sin was dead, but when the Commandment ( id est the
Law) came, sin revived, and I dyed, that is, his sins did appear so
heinous, grievous, and terrible to him, that they were ready to make him
despair: also the same Apostle Rom 5.20
elsewhere says, That the Law entered that the offense might abound.

3 The Law does restrain sin, and that was a maine end wherefore it was
given, which is the meaning of the Apostle in the third of the Galathians 19
ver. Gal. 3.19.
The Law was added because of transgression. Men were grown to a mighty height
of transgression and wickedness, till God gave the Law, to curb, check, and
chain men, from running madly and greedily according to the inclinations of
their wicked and desperate hearts. And in that sense the 1 Timothy 1.9
Apostle speaks, That the Law was made for the lawless and disobedient, for
the ungodly and sinners, etc. Even as amongst men, the occasion of making Laws
(commonly) is either some evil done, or foreseen will be don. God when he gave
the Law at first to Israel, did see that they were prone to follow the wicked
ways and examples of the Egyptians, and therefore gives the Law by way of
anticipation, and prevention.

Secondly, The Law was given that it might be a Schoolmaster unto men, as the
Apostle Gal. 3.24.
says, the Law was our Schoolmaster unto (...). was unto Christ. So Calvin
and others.
Christ, Now the office of a Schoolmaster (and so of the Law, as it is a
Schoolmaster) consifts in two things.

1. In giving Instruction, the Law does teach men what they should not do, and
also what they should do. For do but look into the Ten Commandments, and
most of them are negative Commands, Exodus 10
and teach men what they should not do. As Thou shall have no other gods but
me. Thou shall not make to tby self any graven Image, etc. Yet when Jesus
Christ reduces the ten Commandments into two, he delivers them affirmatively,
Mat. 22.37, 39.
Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and Thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self. So that by comparing both places together, it evidently
appears, that the Law does teach men their duty negatively, and possitively,
both toward God and men: And in this sense the law may be said to be a man's
Counselor, as David Ps. 119.24
said, thy Statutes are my Counselors. Also the Apostle says, the Scripture
(whereof the Law is a part) is given for instruction, and without all
controversy (call it a Rule or what else you please) the Law does guide men in
their duties, and may be called a light unto a man's feet, and a Lamp unto his
paths.

2. The office of a Schoolmaster is to correct the undutifull, and
disobedient; This also the Law does, for what is said of the 2 Timothy 3.16.
Scripture in general may be appropriated to the Law in particular, viz. that
it is for correction.

Object. How does the Law correct men?

Ans. By rebukes and humili. uions, for when men have sinned the Law does
sharply, smartingly, and cuttingly wound and pierce their Consciences, that it
makes them cry out as David Psalm. 39.11.
remove thy stroke away from me. Then it humbles men, and makes them stoop and
subject themselves with shame, and silence to the judgment of God. As the
Apostle speaks, what soever the Law says, it says to them that are under the
Law, that all the world may become guilty before God (or subject to the
judgment of God.) Romans 3.19. Romans 3.19.


Quest. To whom was the Law a Schoolmaster, and how long was it to continue so?

Answ. First, the Law was in a special manner a Schoolmaster to the people of
the Jews, and it was to continue as a Tutor and Teacher unto them, See Luther
on Gal. 3.19.
until Christ came in the flesh, Gal. 3.19. The Law was added because of
transgression, until the seed should come; that is, till Christ should come in
the flesh, and then according to that administration the Law cease.

Secondly, the Law is also a Schoolmaster unto both Jews and Gentiles, until
such time as they do believe in Christ, and are redeemed from the power and
dominion of it. As the Apostles words plainly show, Romans 7.2.
in Romans 7.2. Know ye not (says he) how that the Law has dominion over a man
as long as he lives; Mark those words, a man, i. e. every man, or any man,
whether Jew, or Gentile, as long as he lives, either under the Law, or
undivorced from it, the Law has dominion over him.

Object. Object.
I do apprehend that the Law was a Schoolmaster only to the people, and
Nation of the Jews, and that it did not conccrne the Gentiles at all as a
Schoolmaster: and that the meaning of that third of the Galathians the 25.
verse. is, that the Law was no longer a Schoolmaster, then until Christ came
in the flesh, who is there called faith.

Answ. Answ.
Though some pious and able men are of that judgment, and though the word
Faith be taken objectively for Christ: yet I suppose the text cannot be so
restrictively understood.

First, because then you must hold that the Law was given to, and (intended
for) the Jews only (which afterward I shall show to the contrary) for if it
concerns the Gentiles at all, doubtless it concerns them as a Schoolmaster,
as long as they are under it. Then,

Secondly, many, (or most) of the Galatians to whom that Epistle was writ, were
Gentiles, and if the Law had never been a Schoolmaster unto them, then the
Apostles assertion would not have been pertinent to them.

Thirdly, by faith seems to be meant there (as in Gal. 1.23. and 32.1 Tim. 19.
and 4.1.
other Scriptures) either the Gospel and word of faith, or else the grace and
gift of faith, as it appears in the 26. verse. We are all the children of God
by faith in Christ Jesus; that's the second end of giving the Law.

Thirdly, the Law was given to keep men under, and shut up men in sin, Gal. 3
23.
Before faith came (says the Apostle) we were kept under the Law shut up unto
the faith, and in ver. 22. The Scripture ( i. e. then says) has concluded all
under sin. ( i. e. till the doctrine of his grace was revealed, applied and
believed) and Romans 11.32.
shut them up in unbelief and disobedience: so that they may cry as the
Prophet did. I am shut up, and I cannot get forth. Psalm. 88.8.
The Law of God is to a sinner as the Law of a Nation is to a Malefactor who
transgresses it, that has fore'd to imprison and detain the offender, till
that Law which he has broken be satisfied. When a sinner is enlightened, and
convinced, so as to see his great danger by reason of sin, he would like a
Prisoner or Debtor, either compound or make an escape; but the Law has such an
eye to him, and such a hand over him, that though he should seek to work the
righteousness thereof, and to escape damnation thereby; yet it keeps him still
to this, that there is no way to be freed or delivered, no means to be
attempted or tried to escape, and avoid hell, unless he can find out a means
of satisfaction. Then,

Fourthly, The Law was given, that Christ, and his grace might be the more
advanced. Romans 5.20. Moreover the Law entered that the offense might abound:
but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. That is, God would have
the Law come in to aggravate their sins, that thereby, a way might be made for
him to display the banner of his grace. Doubtless there was this gracious end,
and Evangelicall purpose in the promulgation, and setting up of the Law: and
its Gods usual way in enhanceing and advancing his love, grace, and mercy, to
lead men forth first into a state and condition of distress, and misery As he
says of Israel Hosea 2.14.
I will allure her into the wilderness (i.e. into a distressed and afflicted
condition) and there will I speak comfortably unto her.

Object. How did the Law tend to exalt Christ, seeing you said before, the Law
does not at all hold forth, nor teach Christ?

Answ. Though its very true, that the Law does not directly discover, and teach
Christ, no more then a Statute made against Treason, or murder does direct a
Traitor, or murderer, where, and how, to find pardon: or a bond that engages
a man to pay a great debt upon penalty, show him where to find usoney, or a
surety. Yet doubtless accidentally the Law does make a man seek, and prize
Christ: even as the thundering, lightning, and smoke made the Children of
Israel Deuteronomy. 5.27.
desire Moses to be a Mediator between God and them.

Fifthly, The Law was given that it might be both a standing Covenant, and a
standing Testament unto the end of the world. That it is a Covenant, Page 2.
I have hinted before, and a Testament is very clear, if you consider these
Scriptures, Exodus 19.4.6. Deuteronomy. 4.13. Ier. 31.31, 32. Heb. 8.7, 8, 9. Gal.
4.24. Ephesians. 2.12. Heb. 8.8, 9. though the words in the lines be Covenants, yet
in the margents (which is the best translations) they are Testaments.

Quest. What manner of Covenant was, and is the Law?

Answ. There be several opinions herein and they may be reduced into these
five,

Either.
1. A Covenant of works, or, 2. A Covenant of grace, or, 3. A mixed Covenant,
both of works and grace, or, 4. A subservient, or annexed Covenant, or, 5.
Arenewed Covenant.
Yet as they differ one from another, so shall I differ somewhat from them all.

Quest. But before you show us your own judgment herein; Let us understand
what they mean that hold those several opinions, distinctions.

Answ. First, they that understand it as a pure Covenant of works; conceive,
that about the Covenant God did make it (and intend it,) to be a Covenant that
should give life upon condition of keeping, and performing it personally, and
perfectly.

Secondly, they that think it to be a Covenant of grace, think that there was
no Covenant of works made with men, since that made within Adam in Paradise,
before his fall, and so consequently it must be a covenant of grace.

Thirdly, they that think it to be a mixed Covenant, do look upon it as
having some grace in it (as in the preface) I am the Lord thy God; and in the
second Commandment, God showing mercy unto thousands.

Fourthly, they that think it to be a subservient or annexed Covenant, say
that God did give it as an apendix to the Covenant of Grace which he made with
Adam, and renewed with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Fifthly, they that make it a renewed Covenant, hold that the sum of the ten
Commandments was included in that command given to (or agreement made with)
Adam: and that the giving of the ten Commandments, or moral Law to Israel
was nothing else, but a clearer and fuller delivery and discovery of that Law.

Q. Now what manner of Covenant is the Law? and under what notion is it to be
considered?

Ans. The Law is considered two ways; either as a Covenant, or else as a
Testament, and so relates to two distinct sorts of persons; to the one in the
former sense, and to the other in the latter sense.

Q. What manner of Covenant is it?

A. Doubtless a pure Covenant of works to some men (but not to all) and that
appears clearly by these three following reasons.

1. Reas. 1.
Reas. Because it does require works to justification and salvation. Lev. 18.5.
Ye shall therefore keep my Statutes and my judgments (says the Lord) which
if a man do, he shall live in them. So Romans 10.5. Moses describes the
righteousness of the Law, that the man which does those things shall live by
them. so Gal. 3.12. Ezekiel. 20.11. Romans 2.13.

2. Reas. Reas. 2.
Because it threatens damnation to those that do not continue in doing the
works (and performing the conditions) thereof. Deuteronomy. Gal. 3.10. Deuteronomy. 27.26.
Mat. 5.19. Iam. 2.10. and therefore must needs be a Covenant of works.

3. Reas. Reas. 3.
That which is directly opposite to the Covenant of grace in point of
justification, and salvation, must needs be a Covenant of works; but the Law is
so, see Gal. 3.18. Romans 4.2.6. and 6.14, 15. and 11.6. Ephesians. 2.8, 9.

Object. Object.
But does not the Apostle say, Is the Law against the promises? importing
strongly it was not against the Promises. Gal. 2.21.

Answ. One thing may be said to be contrary to another, either in way of Mat.
12.30.
enmity and opposition, and inconsistencie: or else in terms and conditions.
In the former of these senses the Law is not against the promises; for they are
both of them the will of God, and consist without destroying each other, or
being adversaries one to another; But in their terms and conditions they are
very contrary one to another; for the one requires works, and the other faith
(which conditions are See the Script. in the third Reason.
often put in opposition one to another:)

Secondly, the meaning of that text in the Galathtans, (that the Law is not
against the promise) may be this that the Law did not, nor could not hinder the
promises to justify those that did believe in Christ, and in the promises. As
a Statute Law (amongst men) though it be against the justifying of a man that
breaks it, yet it cannot hinder a man to be justified, and acquitted by a
pardon of grace. Luther gives this exposition of the place that the promises of
God hangs not upon the Law; for his promise does not stand upon our
worthiness, neither does our sins committed against the Law, hinder God to
perform his promises to us.

Object. Object.
Sure the Law or ten Commandments could not be a Covenant of works, because
the Covenant of grace was given four hundred and thirty years before it.

Answ. Answ.
Upon the same ground there should be no Covenant of works at all; for the
Covena nt of grace was ever before the Covenant of works, and God did never
intend the salvation of men no other way then by grace, as I have in the first
part of this book proved.

Object. Object.
You say the Law is a Covenant of works, in what sense do you understand it to
be a Coveuant of works?

Answ. Answ.
The greatest doubt and kruple about the Law does consist in this objection,
and upon this hinge chiefly does the door (of entrance into the right
understanding of the Law and Gospel) and whole weight of the Controversy
concerning this Subject hang. Therefore I will plainly (though briefly) declare
what I apprehend to be the truth herein, which is this.

God did not give the Law (or ten Commandments) intentionally, and with
purpose that any should be saved thereby; For he knew that none (after the
fall) could possibly keep, and observe the same. Also he did fully intend, and
purpose to save all such as should be saved (and that he had ordained to
salvation,) by Jesus Christ, through the Covenant of grace, without the works
of the Law, as is clear in 2 Timothy 1.59, 10. Tit. 1.2. Romans 3.24, 25.

Object. Object.
But then you will say, how is it a Covenant of works?

Answ. Answ.
Its a Covenant of works occasionally, and accidentally, and only othose that
are not related to, comprehended in, or made partakers of the Covenant of
grace. And in that sense I conceive those words are to be understood in the 1
Timo. 1.9. Knowing this that the Law is not it signifies is not put, or put
over them.
made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, etc. that is,
the Law was not intended, nor ordained (I mean as a Covenant) for a justified
man that walks obediently, but for an unjustified man that walks disobediently.
Consider this, that from the beginning of the world, there were two Covenants in
force and being, and all the world were (under) one of those two Covenants,
(and still are, and will be) to wit, under the Covenant of works, or the
Covenant of Grace. And herein is the mystery great that many unbelieving, and
ungodly men, that shall be damned, were under the outward administration of the
Covenant of grace, but not really and actually under it, so as to be saved by
it: also the elect and believers were under the outward administration of the
Covenant of works, yet not so as to perish or be damned thereby.

Object. Object.
But I do not well understand how the Law is occasionally and accidentally a
Covenant of works, therefore explain what you mean thereby.

Answ. Answ.
1. I mean that God did not directly give the law unto any to be saved by it:
or say unto any, Lo here is my Law which I have prescriscribed and assigned,
as a way and means for you to be saved, and I intend your salvation this way,
and by this means, and I will deal with you upon this term and condition,
keep my Law, and observe my commandments, and you shall be saved.

Yet secondly, consider, that God deals with those who are Iusticiaries (and
that look to be justified by the works of the Law: and refuse to accept of
justification and falvation by Christ, and the Covenant of grace) under the
Covenant of works. As the Mat. 19 15, 17, 18.
man in the Gospel who would by doing have eternal life Christ sent him to the
Law, not that Christ did inrend that he should be saved by the Law, but because
the man himself was conceited that he should be saved that way, and resolved
that he would not be saved any other way. As when Paul Acts 25.11.12.
appealed unto Caesar, Festus answered him, unto Caesar shall thou go. So when
a man appeals to the Law (or Covenant of works) God says to him, seeing thou
have appealed unto the law, to the law thou shall go. But as Agrippa Acts
26.32.
said of Paul, this man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed
unto Caesar; So may it be said unto that man that appeals to the Law; if he
had not appealed to it, he might have been set at Liberty by Christ, and the
Covenant of grace. Thus you fee the Law is not a Covenant of works to those
that are saved, nor ever was intended for that end. But on the other side, it
is a Covenant of works to those that are damned, and this is occasioned by
themselves. So that in oriefe it is thus; all that perish, and loose their
souls stand upon their own justification, and in so doing, God is
necessitated (to speak with reverence) to put them upon the trial of the Law,
and to say unto them thus; You that have refused to submit unto my Gospel, and
to accept forgiveness and salvation through my Son, upon the term of
believing, and have put your selves upon my Law, and your own works, you
shall be tried thereby, and in case you can bring such a righteousness as my
Law requires, Oh but who can do this. See Romans 3.20.
and that you can work the conditions thereof: I will pardon and discharge you
from all your sins, and you shall be saved. But if you cannot (as it is
impossible to fulfill the Law in every point) then shall the Law have the full
force of a Covenant of works over you, and you must be judged Romans 2.12. Jam.
2.12.
according to the Law, and Rev. 20.12, 13. 2 Cor. 5.10.
according to your works, and must undergo all the curses and plagues
denounced in the Law against the Transgressors of it.

Quest. Having showed how the Law is a Covenant, (and in what sense it is a
Covenant of works) now declare where it is called a Testament, and in what
sense it is so called?

Ans. First, that it is called a Testament, these following Scriptures do
plainly declare, Gal. 4. 24. Ephesians. 2.12. Heb. 8.8, 9. and 9.4.15.17. Rev.
11.19. Though in some of these places it be read in our Bibles Covenant, yet in
the last translation (as you shall find in the margent) it is Testament, and
so the word does most properly signify.

Secondly, It is called a Testament, because it is the will of Jesus Christ,
which he has left and established for his own Disciples and believers as well
as others; But here is the difference, the Law is stablished by Christ as an
absolute Covenant of works to those that believe not, (as he (says Mat. 5.18.
That not one jot, or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all
be fulfilled. i. e. fulfilled by them that were Pharisees, to whom he spoke
this.

But the Law is established only and merely Testament, to believers, to
declare what he would have them yield obedience in love, and not upon condition
of salvation, nor upon penalty of damnation. Joh. 14.15.
If ye love me (says he to his Disciples) keep my Commandments. Joh. 15.14.
And ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.

Object. Object.
But is not the Gospel the Testament, and will of Christ rather then the Law.
Answ.


Answ. Both Joh. 6.39.
Gospel, and Romans 12.2.
Law are his will, and Mat. 22.37, 38, 39.
instituted by him, the one as well the other, and both to continue in force
one as long as another. Yet this is very true that the Gospel is the chiefest
part of Christ's will, and the best Testament (because it is stablished upon
Heb. 8.6.
better promises) as afterward I shali show.

Quest. Is the Law or (ten Commandments) moral, and does it remain in force
now, in the days of the new Testament, and since Christ, as well as before?

Answ. Yes doubtless, Answ.
the Law is moral, and does continue in force, as well since Christ as before,
but yet there is some difference in the administration of it since Christ's
coming, and the administration of it before his coming.

Quest. How, is it proved that the Law remains in force since Christ's time?
Reas. 1. To prove the continuance of the Law, now in the days of the Gospel.


Reas. 1. Because Christ has not taken it away, for he says Mat. 5.17.
He came not to destroy the Law but to fulfill it: and these words Christ
speaks to the Jews, who had a prejudice against him, as thinking he did
intend to destroy the Law. But Christ bids them that they should not think
that he came to destroy it. But rather (as in another place) he exhorts them to
Mal. 4.4.
to remember the Law of Moses the servant of the Lord.

Object. Object.
But then Christ had not fulfilled the Law, which since he has done, and
therefore is called the end of the Law. Romans 10.4.

Answ. Doubtless Christ's fulfilling the Law, Answ.
did not tend to the utter and perfect destroying of the Law, Note that Christ
is not called absolutely the end of the Law, but the end of Law for
righteousness, and that not to all, but to those that do believe. Romans 10.4.
Reas. 2.
and to the taking of it away, that it should continue no longer: but his
fulfilling the Law was to satisfy the Law for the sins of those, that did
and should believe; And Christ was the end of the Law for righteousness (or as
it was a Covenant of works) and that not to all, but to every one that
believes, as the Apostle says in that place.

Reas. 2. Another Reason to prove the continuance (or morality (of the Law is,
that the Sea 1 John 2.4.
Apostles did approve of, and establish the Law. As for example, says Paul,
The Law is Romans 7.12.14.
holy, just, good and spiritual, if it be 1 Timothy 1.8.
lawfully used. And in another place, he take away that suspicion that some had
of him, or an objection that they might make against him, that he did overthrow
the Law totally. Romans 3.31.
Do we then (says he) make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea, we
establish the law. It is as if he had said, you Romans, do not mistake, and
misjudge me, about the Law, neither think you that by my preaching, and
tendering the Covenant of grace unto sinners so freely: or my care in bringing
believers from under the Law, and the Menaces, threatenings and curses thereof,
I do intend to destroy and nullify the Law: oh noe! I am so far from
destroying the Law hereby, that I do rather confirm it, according to the
intent, and purpose of God in giving and instituting it.

Reas. 3. Reas. 3.
Because the Apostles did cite and urge the Law, both for the doing of good,
and against the committing of evil. When the Apostle Paul teaches the Church
of Corinth, how she was bound to maintain her Ministers, he urges the Law for
it. 1 Cor. 9.9.
Say I these things as a man? or says not the Law the same also? See Ephesians. 6.1.
1 Cor. 14.21.
for it is written in the Law of Moses, thou shall not muzzle the Ox that
treads out the corn. So James says, Jam. 2.8.
If ye fulfill the royal Law ye do well: Again, Jam. 2.9.11.
James, and 1 John 3.4.
John agree in this, that whoever commits sin, (kills or the like)
transgresses, and breaks the Law.

Reas. 4. Reas. 4.
Because men are blamed, and condemned for breaking and transgressing the Law.
Thou that make thy boast of the Law through breaking the Law, dishonourest
thou God. Romans 2.23. and that by Law, here is meant the moral Law appears
evidently in ver. 21.22. See also Romans 12.19. Many more Reasons I might
allege for to prove the morality and continuance of the morall-law in the
days of the Gospel, but these are sufficient.

Object. Object.
Though the MORAL LAW does continue in the days of the Gospel, yet it
concerns not believers, neither does it belong unto them: for they are free
from it, and dead to it, under it, as the Scripture frequently speaks.

Answ. Though it be a blessed truth (and worth our understanding and knowledge)
that believers are free from the Law, Answ.
dead to the Law, and not under the Law yet in receiving this truth we must
have a care that we do not entertain an error with it. Therefore I will
discover (according to the Light I have) in what sense this is true, and in
what sense it is not, and how the moralllaw does concern believers, and how it
does not, and that I may make it the plainer appear, I will state it in these
three Questions.

Quest. 1. Of what uses, and concernment, is the morall-law unto believers.

Quest. 2. How and in what senses are believers free from the law, dead to the
law, and delivered from the Law?

To answer the first Question.

Quest. Of what uses and concernment is the moral unto believers?

Ans. 1. Answ.
It does discover unto them what manner of God their God is, for as his Law is
that comes from him, such he himself is. His Law as you heard before, is holy,
and just, and good: so is God himself, Joh. 24.19. 1 Samuel 6.20.
a holy God, whose nature is Heb. 1.9. Hab. 1.13.
utterly against sin, and whose eyes cannot behold iniquity, a just Esa.
45.24.
God, who will not justify, nor acquit the Exodus 24.7.
guilty, without satisfaction for sin; and yet a good God Luke 18.19.
who has made his son 2 Cor. 5.21.
to be sin for sinners and a Gal. 3.13.
curse for those that were under the curses of the Law. Oh! let believers look
upon the Law of God, that they may consider what manner of God their God is.

Object. Object.
It is not a legal knowledge of God (or a knowledge of him by the law) that is
enough for believers to have, but they must know him a reconoiled God to them,
and as a Father, and this knowledge the Gospel only teaches.

Answ. Its very true, that a legal knowledge of God is not enough to save men:
Answ.
and that it is the Gospel that does discover God, as a reconciled God and
Father. Yet doubtless, believers, when they have a Gospellknowledge of God,
are not excluded, nor prohibited from a legali knowledge of him. As the
children of a King or Emperor know their father to be their Sovereign and
head as well as their Father, God in Scripture is called the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. 11.31.
and the Ephesians. 1.17.
God and 1 Cor. 11.3.
head of Jesus ( i.e. believers) so our Gal. 1.4. Col. 2.2.
God and Father, and Jesus Christ called him his Joh. 20.17. Rev. 3.12.
God, as well as his Father, and the Apostle writes to the Hebrews (who were
believers) that their God was a Heb. 12.29.
consuming fire, So that believers are to look upon God, as he is in his
infinite, holy, and glorious Majesty, and Being, as well as he is in his grace,
love, and mercy to them through Jesus Christ; Yet let not this knowledge be
rested in (not thought to be perfectly attained to) for (as Luther said) it is
not only a horrible but a damnable thing, The Angels and Saints do often style
God THE LORD GOD ALMIGH TY. Rev. 4.8. and 11.17. and 15.32. and 16.14. and
19.15 and 21.22. The Law is called the strength of sin, because sin had no
power to condemnt a man, if it were not for the law.
to think of God without Jesus Christ.

Secondly, The Law is useful unto believers, to make them more prize, and
praise the wonderful, free, and rich love and graee of Jesus Christ to them.
This use Paul made of it, when he looked upon the Law as the strength of sin,
he cries out with a joyful acclamation. Thanks be to God who gives us the
victory through Jesus Christ our Lord. 1 Cor. 15, 56, 57.

Thridly, the third use (that believers may make) of the Law is to be a
Discoverer, and Convincer of sin unto themselves. As the Apostle says to
believes. Jam. 2.9.11.
If ye have respect to persons ye commit sin, and are convinced of the Law.
again says he, If thou kill, thou art ateansgressor of the Law. Yea
doubtless, the words of Paul, Romans 7.7.
I had not known sin except the Commandment had said thou shall not covet,
do declare that he had discoveries and convictions of sin by the Law, after
his first believing, and that is the most proper, and genuine scope, and
meaning of that text; for Paul there vindicates the Law, and the use of it.
Also the experiences of the Saints teach this to be true; for seldom do the
Saints commit sin, (especially, if it be an outward sin) but the
Commandment which they broke, and against which they then sinned, represents
it self to them, to reprove them for the sin.

Object. Object.
But do not you hereby put believers again under the Law; for if the Law has
power to convince them, has it not then the force of a Covenant of works upon
them.

Answ. Oh no, Answ.
I am very far from bringing believers that are once (rightly, judiciarily
and upon good grounds) delivered from the Law, under the power of it again,
neither does this at all bring a believer under the Law again: for note that
the Law has an enlightening and informing part, and an accusing and condemning
part. And herein the Law is like a candle, that a man may have light to see
poison in his chamber; yet he need not burn his chamber with the candle. A
believer may let the Law be his Informer, but not his Judge.

Fourthly, the Law teaches believers to have no confidence in the flesh, Gal.
2.19.
for it is a curse to the pride and presumption of believers, as well as of
unbelievers. And therefore does the Apostle experimentally say. I through the
i.e. The Law of Moses, or it may be understood of the law of Christ
law am dead to the Law, that I might live to God. That is, the law breaks off
my hope, and takes away my confidence of being justified or saved thereby. As
it was the people of Israel, so it is with many now (yea true believers) that
they think themselves Exodus 19 8.
holy till the Law appears to them.

Obj. You make the Law as large to believers as to unbelievers, Object
and you show of what uses the Law are to believers; but under what other
notions and considerations are believers to look upon the Law.

Answ. 1. Answ.
They are to look upon it as the Law of Christ? Gal. 6.2.
Bear ye one another burden, (says the Apostle) and so fulfill the Law of
Christ, by the Law of Christ in this place is meant the same with that in the
thirteenth of the Romans the ninth verse. Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy
self.

Object. Object.
But how are believers to consider it as the Law of Christ?

Answ. 1. Answ. Romans 13.9. Although indeed the Gospel is more properly the Law
of Christ. Esa. 42.4.
As it is instituted by Christ, as he is King, John 13.34. therefore called the
royal law.

2. As its explained and expounded by Christ, as he is Prophet, and a new
Command, and do not look upon it, as it was first handed out, and delivered by
Moses.

3. As it is fulfilled and satisfied by Christ as he is Priest, and so laid up
in the Arc Christ. Heb. 9.4.

Secondly, Believers are to look upon the Law, as contracted, and epitomized,
and so instead of ten commandments to look upon them as two, yea one, and
comprehended in that one word love, as the Apostle says Romans 13.10.
Love is the fulfilling of the Law: and in another Gal. 5.14.
place, the Law is fulfilled in one word.

Thirdly, Believers are to look upon the Law as weak and imperfect to help
them, now they are sinners. For what the Law Romans 8.3.
could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, and again, the Apostle
Heb. 7.19.
says the Law made nothing perfect. And this was typed out in Moses, who could
not, nor did not bring Moses to Canaan.

Fourthly, Believers are to look upon the Law, as written in rheir hearrs,
Esa. 51.7.
Hearken unto me (says God) ye that know righteousness, the people in whose
heart is my Law. And God promises, faying Heb. 8.10.
I will put my Law into their minds, and write them in their hearts.

Object. Object.
But are not believers to look upon the Law in the Letter, and written in the
Bible?

Ans. Yes doubtless, Answ.
they are to go to the Law, and to the Testimony, and to observe what is
written, Esa..
and to have an high and honorable esteem of the Scriptures: And to say as
Paul Romans 4.3.
said, What says the Scriptures? It was the practice of Joh. 7.38. Mat. 21.42.
Christ and his 1 Timothy 5.18, and 2.3.16. Jam. 4.5. Object.
Apostles, when they did affirm any thing to prove it by Scripture.

Object. But if the Law be written upon the tables of the heart, a man need not
at all look upon the Letter without.

Answ. Though Christ was the Lawgiver, Answ.
and had all the Law of God written within him, yet he looked upon the letter
of the word, and did make use of that as a weapon against Satan, in that great
combat of Mat. 4.4.7.
temptation: and shall not we that have the Law but imperfectly written in our
hearts, neglect the letter, and wherefore was the word written? Was it not for
our Romans 15.4.
learning? Let us therefore as David (or rather Christ personated, and
prophesied by him) say Psalm. 40.8.
thy word is within my heart, and yet make his outward word our Ps. 119.24.
Object.
Counselors as he did.

Obj. But the Apostle Peter says that they did well to look unto the word of
Prophecy, (or the Scriptures) until the day dawne, and the Day Star did
arise in their hearts but no longer.

Answ. He does not say, Answ.
and no longer, and the word UNTIL is often taken in Scripture (for the space
of time how long soever) for ever. See 2 Samuel 6.23. Psalm. 110. 1. Heb. 10.16.

Obj. But how would you have believers look upon the Law in their hearts and
also upon the writ. Object.
ten and verbal Law.

Answ. The Law of love written in the hearts of believers is the principle
ground, motive, and agent that puts them a doing: (as the Apostle said, 2 Cor.
5.14. See Joh. 14.23.24.
the love of Christ eonstraineth us) yet the outward letter is a good book in
the hand of the Spirit, to teach and guide believers what to do and how to do.

Fifthly, Believers are to look upon the Law, and the righteousness thereof
fulfilled by them, (or in them) as the Apostle testifies, Romans 10.4.
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit. And another Apostle says 1 John 3.22.
, We keep his Commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his
sight. So it is said (of those Saints that did not submit to Antichrist) Rev.
14.12.
that they kept the commandments of God.

Sixthly, That the law cannot judge them, neither ought they to judge it.
Believers are to look upon the Law as dead to them, and they to it, (as Paul
said of the world, Gal. 6.14.
I am crucified to the world, and the world to me. So may a believer say, I am
dead to the law, and the law to me.

Object. Object.
But how do believers keep the Commandments, or the law? Answ.


Answ. They keep it in their head Romans 8.4. and 10.4.
Jesus Christ; for what he did or does as Mediator, it is reckoned and
accounted to believers as well as their sins were reckoned, and imputed unto
him: in this sense believers are to look upon the law, as if it had never been
broken, but performed by them in every tittle.

Secondly, believers keep the law when they live in love toward God and men;
for Romans 13.10.
love is the fnlfilling of the law. And the more any abound and grow in love,
the more actually and personally they do perform the Law. 1 Timothy 1.5.
For the end of the Commandment is love out of a pure heart, etc.

Thirdly, believers do keep the law, in that they do not transgress the law
willingly, but as Paul Romans 7.19.
said, the evil which I would not, that I do, The will is the great
tunewheele of the soul, and makes a thing in a manner good or evil, for where
the will is wanting in a good duty, that duty is not rightly performed, nor
cannot be accepted: again, where the will is present the Lord accepts that,
the power be wanting. 2 Cor. 8.12.

Object. Object.
But do any keep the law perfectly in their own persons?

Answ. No doubtless, Answ.
for in many things we offend all: and if we say we have no sin we deceive
our selves, and the truth is not in us. Jam. 3.2. 1 John 1.10.

Quest. How and in what senses are believers said to be dead to the law, free
from the law, as the Scriptures speak, Gal. 2.19. Romans Romans 8.2.

Answ. Two ways, and in two senses, either in respect of the Authority, or
else in respect of the Mosaicall administration of it.

Quest. How in respect of the authority of it are they dead to it, and freed
from it. How. believers are dead to the law, and free from the law.


Answ. Fist, As it is a Judge, the law has no power to condemn them, for what
the law Romans 3.19. Certaiainly the law can say nothing in way of threatening, or
curse to a believer.
says, it says to them that are under the law. And a believer being justified
cannot be again condemned, for the Apostle concludes that strongly in the
eighth to the Romans the first verse. There is no condemnation to them that are
in Christ Jesus. Therefore certainly the curses, and maledictions of the law,
are to more to believers then penall-statutes unto persons that are fully
acquitted, and discharged by a legal trial.

Secondly, believers are dead to the law, and free from the law as it is an
Accuser. The law has the property of an Accuser; For Christ told the Jews.
Joh. 5.45.
There is one that will accuse you, even Moses, in whom you trust: That is the
law of Moses on which they did rest and depend Romans 8.33.
. But this law has no power to accuse those that believe, therefore does the
Apostle challenge all at once saying, Who shall lay any thing to the charge of
Gods elect? you know it is the office of an Accuser to bring in a charge, so
its the office of the law to charge those that are under it.

Object. Object.
But are not believers sometimes charged and accused by the Law?

Answ. Yes, Answ.
the law does sometimes (especially upon the breaking of it) accuse men, if
they will listen to it: but it is such an accusation as was against Christ, and
against Paul, that could not be proved. Now believers have an Romans 2.15.
excusation, as well as an accusation, 1 John 5.10.
and a witness within them, to justify them from this accusation: and when
the law does this ill office in the Conscience, then appeal from the Court of
Conscience to the Court of Christ, and plead that Act of indemnity ( viz. the
Covenant of grace) and the composition of Christ, which he has paid for you,
and you shall have a discharge from the law, and the law shall have a charge to
sequester your peace, and comfort no more.

Thirdly, Believers are dead to the law, and free from the law, as it is a
Lord; for believers are not under tenants, holding their spiritual and
eternal estate by a lease from the law, as a substitute of Christ; Christ is
the souls immediate Landlord, (or rather Soul lord) And though the law may be
Christ's Solicitor, and Steward: yet it is not authorized by Christ to reign
and rule in the consciences of his people, for his Fathers Col. 3.15.
peace, Romans 14.17.
own righteousness, and his spirits joy is to dwell and rule in their hearts
and consciences.

Fourthly, Believers are dead to the law, and freed from it as it is a King,
that can pardon such as offend against it. Now mark this, believers have
nothing to do, to sue, or to seek for pardon from the law, neither can the
law or will the law pardon any transgression whatsoever.

Fifthly, Believers are dead to, and free from the law as it is a Husband. The
law has no longer dominion over a man then he lives, (viz.) in the state of
nature, and out of Christ) Nay, as in marriage, if either party be dead,
whether the man or the woman, yet the nuptial knot is broken, and the marriage
tie and engagement is quite (and for ever) dissolved. And this is the doctrine,
and comparison of the Apostle, in the 7th. of the Romans, Romans 7.1. to the 7.
the six first verses. Consider this seriously, that if you be believers, and
married to Christ, the law has no more power over you, then a dead husband
has over his relict and liveing wife.

Object. That is true, Object.
the law has no correcting power, but yet sure it has a commanding power.

Answ. Not so; for then the comparison would not hold, for Husbands have no
power to correct their wives at all: therefore of necessity it must be
understood of a commanding, and controuling power, which the law has not over
a believer.

Object. Object.
Nay if you say, that the law has no commanding power over a believer, you
fling the law out of doors, and give believers scope enough to do what they
list; for I am sure if there be no law, we shall quickly fec men take their
full scope in sin.

Answ. Answ.
Though the law should be dead to a believer, and a believer dead to the law:
yet it does thence follow, that they should sin, must sin, or will sin; no
more then it follows that a woman must needs be a Harlot, because her Husband
is dead. Mark this, that though the law (the former husband) be dead to a
believer, yet a believer is no widow (much less a Harlot) for he is married
to Christ, and is under the Gal. 6.2.
law of Christ, which is love (as I showed before) and 1 Cor. 9.21.
under the law to Christ. Observe how the Apostle argues-from believers being
dead to the law, he says not I am dead to the law, that I might live to sin;
but I am dead to the law that I might live to God. And in another place he
propounds a question in detestation to sin, (having said before they were not
under the law but under grace) what then says he; (or what is the issue of this
doctrine, that men are freed from the law) Romans 6.15.
Shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
What shall a woman be more dutiful and obedient to an imperious husband, that
did control, and correct every day, then to another kind, and loving
Husband, that loves her as his own flesh, and tenders her as his own life.
This is the true state of a believer that has been formerly married to the law
(which since is dead) and is now married to Christ. A true believer will be so
far from abusing this blessed and happy freedom, that nothing will engage
him more to be holy then this. Thus having demonstrated how believers are freed
from the authority, and Sovereignty of the law, now it follows to show how
they are dead to, and free from, the Mosaical administration of it.

Quest. Wherein did the Mosaicall administration of the law consist, from which
believers are freed?

Answ. 1. In the fiery and terrible delivery of it, Deuteronomy. 33.2.
and therefore called a fiery law (or in hebrew a fire of law) The delivering
of the law upon Mount Sinai, and the delivering of it upon Mount Zion do much
differ. For upon Mount Sinai it was to the people as the 1 King. 19 22, 23.
voice of thundering was to Elia^. The sight and noise was so terrible that
Moses (though a Mediator) Heb. 12.21.
said, I exeeedingly fear and quake. But the law as it is now delivered, and
administered unto us by Jesus Christ on Mount Zion, is with such calmness,
sweetness, and melodiousnesse, that it has rather an affecting, and
attracting, then a terrifying property and effect; And it was propheci'd of
Christ; Esa. 42.2.
That he should not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the
streets, and its said that the Isles should wait for his law. Though Christ does
give his law through fire, yet it is through the fire of his spirit, and it is
with that love, and meekness, that they that hear it do sing, and not cry,
and they do not say as the Israelites, let not the Lord speak unto us, but
they desire rather that the Lord would speak unto them.

Secondly, the Mosaicall administration was rather an apposition and hinderance
unto men, then any way a furtherance. As the Apostle calls the law, the Col.
2.14.
handwriting of ordinances which was against us. And the law in this place is
granted by many to (and doubtless does) comprehend the moral law as well as
the ceremonial.

Obj. Object.
But how was that administration of the Law against them that were under it?

Answ. It was accompanied with so many carnal, and outward ordinances, that it
was as a yoke, Acts 15.10.28.
and burden (as it is called) unto the poor believers and disciples that were
under it: for they were to do so much duty, and to go so far (viz.) three
times a year to Jerusalem, from all the parts of Iudca, and they were to be at
such charges also, that all these things being put together, that Church might
well be said to be in Gal. 4.25.
bondage, with her children.

Thirdly, that administration was but a literal administration, or the
administration of the letter; but this administration that we are speaking of
is a spiritual administration: then the law was 2 Cor. 3.3.
written in stones, but now in the fleshly tables of the heart.

Object. Object.
But here you speak of the difference between the administration of the Law,
and the administration of the Gospel, and not of the difference between the
two administrations of the law, the one before Christ, and the other since.

Answ. Answ.
Note this well, that all the law, and all the Gospel which they had before
Christ, it was considered as one and the same administration: and so all the
Gospel, and all the law which we have since Christ is but one administration.
Therefore be clear and sure in this that the whole administration of the Jews
is Heb. 8.6. Zac. 8. and 9.8.
abrogated and nulled, and we Gentiles have nothing to do with that
administration: but we are to receive both Gospel and Law at the hands of
Christ, and to learn to know the administration we are under, and not to serve
the Lord as the Jews did in fear, and in the oldnesse of the letter; but Luke
74.
without fear, (I mean a legal fear) and in Romans 7.4.
newness of Spirit, and in this sense is the Law called a new Commandment,
because it had a new administration. For note that Christ did with the Law, and
old Testament as a Goldsmiths does with old coin (that wants in goodness of
mettle, and weight,) he casts into the fire, and among much more precious
mettle does cast it, and stamped it anew with this impression; THE NEW
COMMANDMENT AND LAW OF CHRIST.

Quest. What is the difference (or are the differences) between the Law and the
Gospel?

Answ. Gods different ends in giving the law and Gospel.
First, they differ in the ends of their institution; for God did never intend
that the two Covenants should be for the same end.

Object. Object.
No; did he not intend his own glory in both?

Answ. Answ.
Though God had that general end ( viz. his own glory) in giving both
Covenants, 1. In respect of God.
yet two particulars it did much differ. First,

First, In respect of God himself. For in giving the Law, he had in I more
special manner, a regard to his own Power, and Justice; but in giving the
Gospel, he had regard to his own free grace, mercy, and goodness: And he
instituted his Law for the exaltation of the one; and his Gospel for the
advancement of the other.

2. In respect of men, 2. In respect of men.
God did intend the Law, and Gospel, for different ends: for he never intended,
by giving the Law, that any should be justified, or saved thereby, (as I showed
before;) but in giving the Gospel, Gods maine end (with relation to men) was,
that they should have John 20.31.
Life.

Secondly. The Law, and Gospel, do differ in their righteousness, and
conditions: For the righteousness of the Law says thus, Romans 10.5.
He that does these things, shall live in them. But the righteousness of the
Gospel (called the righteousness of faith) says on this manner, verse. 11.
Whosoever believes on him, (i. e. Christ) shall not be ashamed, or
confounded. Here you see plainly, that the Law requires man's own righteousness;
but the Gospel reveals and requires Christ's righteousness, as it is Written,
Romans 1.17.
There (i.e. in the Gospel) is the righteousness of God, revealed from faith
to faith. The Law requires doing, and that by a man's self, as a condition of
Salvation; but the Gospel requires believing in Christ.

Object. But did you not say before, that the Law was not given with an
intention that any should be saved thereby, and yet now you make doing a
condition of salvation, as if men might be saved by doing?

Answ. See page 106.
I say again, that God did never intend that men should be saved by the Law,
or by their own doings; but yet, whosoever will attempt that way, and put
himself to be saved under that Covenant, he must perform the condition
thereof, which is doing. But it is impossible that the Law should give life,
(it being not instituted for that end) and it is as impossible that men should
work and perform the conditions of the Law.

Thirdly. They differ in their Mediators; for Lev. 26.46. Deuteronomy 5.26, 27.
Moses was the Mediator (at least typically) of the Law, but Heb. 8.6. and
9.15. and 12.24.
Christ is the Mediator of the Gospel.

Fourthly. They differ much in their promises; for all the promises of the Law
are conditional, or temporal: but the promises of the Gospel are Heb. 8.6.
far better, being for most part (if not all, in a sense) free, as also
spiritual and eternal.

Fourthly. They differ in their Ordinances: For the legal Ordinances are
called Heb. 9.10
carnal, (i.e. more outward, and less spiritual) but the Gospel Ordinances
are called Romans 15.27.
spiritual things.

Fifthly. They differ in their confirming Seals: For the Law was sealed and
confirmed to the Jews, by the Heb. 9.13.18, 19.
blood of beasts (as of Bulls, Heifers, Goats, etc.) But the Gospel, or new
Covenant, is sealed and confirmed by the Mat. 26.28.
blood of Jesus Christ. I might instance in other seals, but I come to the
sixth difference:

Seventhly. They differ in this, that the Spirit is not given by the Law, but
by the Gospel; as the Apostle interrogatorily argues. Gal. 3.2.
Received ye (says he) the spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing
of i. e. The doctrine of faith, Gal. 1.22.
faith?

Object. What do you mean, that the spirit was not at all given under the Law?

Answ. No, I mean not so; (for the Spirit was given to 1 Pet. 1.11.
holy men of God, under the Law, though not in the like measure as since
Christ's Ascension) but I mean, that it is not the Doctrine, or preaching of
the Law, that is the outward means to convey the Spirit unto men, but the
doctrine and preaching of the Gospel.

Eigthly. They differ in their Light, Luster, and Glory. The holy Ghost Heb.
9.8.
signifies, that the way into the holiest of all, was not yet made manifest,
while as the first Tabernacle (or Covenant) was standing. On the other side,
the same Spirit 2 Timothy 1.10.
testifies, that life and immortality came to light by the Gospel. And
concerning the Luster of the Gospel, it is said, to 2 Cor. 4.4.6.
shine. And for the Law, (though it was glorious) yet it had 2 Cor. 3.9.10.
no glory in this respect, (says the Apostle) by reason of the glory that
excels, which was the glory of the Gospel.

Ninthly. They differ in the promulgation, and manifestation of both: For the
Gospel has two special privileges and pre-eminences of the Law, in the
promulgation of it.

1. That it is to be preached, chiefly, and mainly; (but the Law, accidentally,
and occasionally) This is the Commission, and Message of Christ, Mark. 16.15.
Luke 9.2. Luke 9.6.
Go and preach the Gospel: and it was the Acts 5.42. and 7 3. and 8.25. Romans
15.9.
practice of Christ's Apostles, to preach the Gospel altogether. Insomuch, that
Paul 1 Cor. 2.2.
says, that he determined to know (or make known) nothing among the
Corinthians, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And the reason why Ministers
were, and are called 2 Cor. 3.6.
the Ministers of the New Testament, and 2 Cor. 1.15.23
Ministers of Christ, and of righteousness; because they did preach the New
Testament, and did teach Jesus Christ, and his righteousness.

The Gospel has this preeminence of the Law, in the promulgation of it, in
that it is to be preached in time, and in order, before the Law.

Object. But how does it appear, that the Gospel is to be preached before the
Law?

Answ. 1. By the practice of Christ, and his Apostles, who preached the Gospel
first. As for example, our Savior he pronounced Mat. 5.3. to 12. See Mat.
4.23. Mat. 1.4.
nine blessings of the Gospel (in his Sermon on the Mount) before he spoke one
word of the Law. So Paul 1 Cor. 15.3.
when he came to the Corinthians, he delivered unto them, first of all (that
which he also received) how that Jesus Christ dyed for their sins, according
to the Scriptures; which was plain and pure Gospel. So Paul and Silas upon the
first question, propounded unto them by the Keeper of the Prison, they exhort
Acts 16.31.
and teach him to believe in the Lord Jesus. And this was also the constant
practice of the Apostles wherever they came. Gredere, facere.


2. Because that believing is to be taught before doing, for Heb. 11 6.
without faith, it is impossible to please God. And that the preaching of the
Law, does not teach men to believe ( i. e. in Christ as a Mediator) I have
showed before; Perkins on Gal. 3.11. See Gall. 2.20.
for (as that worthy man Mr. Perkins says The Gospel requires faith in Christ,
the Mediator God-Man, and this faith the Law never knew.

3. Because that the Gospel is the word that does inlighten and beget men
again, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. 2 Timothy 1.10. 1 Cor. 4.15. And to what end is it to teach
any thing of duty unto men, before they have either light, or life, to perform
the same? Observe what, and how our Savior spoke to the sinful woman, thy
sins are forgiven, therefore sin no more; here was more Gospel then Law.
Many more reasons might be given: but to answer some Objections, that are
brought against this truth.

Object. But the Lord taught Adam and Eve, in Paradise, the Law, before he did
deliver the Promise unto them Genesis 3.11, 13.16. Ergo, the Law should be
preached before the Gospel.

Answ. For God to ask Adam, have thou eaten of the tree? etc. and Eve, What is
this that thou have done? is not at all to preach the Law; Withal, before he
threatens Adam, or Eve for their disobedience, he declares the promise of
Christ, see v. 15, 16, 17. But put the case, this had been a preaching of the
Law to them; yet this was an extraordinary manner of speaking, and not an
ordinary way, and therefore the Argument is not good; for by the same reason,
we may say, that the Gospel must now be accompanied with miracles, because
Christ's preaching, and his Apostles was so.

2. Object. You say, the Apostles preached the Gospel first; but it is evident
to the contrary, for they discovered unto men their sins ( as Peter said, Acts
2. Ye have crucified the Lord of Glory.)

Answ. 1. I have proved before, that the Apostles did preach the Gospel before
the Law, and it is evident, that Peter, in that second of the Acts (before he
spoke of the Jews crucifying Christ) did preach the free and blessed Gospel:
as concerning the pouring out of the Spirit, v. 17. and being saved by calling
upon the name of the Lord, v. 21. And those words of Peter, spoken to the
Jews, v. 36. which you have crucified; were not chiefly intended by him, to
declare to them their sin: but his aim and scope, was to prove that, that
Jesus, whom they had crucified, was risen from the dead, and was both Lord and
Christ. For mark the text, Let all the house of Israel, says he, know
assuredly, that God made that same Jesus, both Lord and Christ. But what if it
were granted, that this was Law; yet what is this, one occasional word in a
whole Sermon, is no ground to preach whole Sermons, yea, many Sermons of the
Law, to fit men for Christ, as too many do.

Object. But how can men come to see the want and need of Christ, if the Law be
not first preached unto them?

Answ. The Scripture does not command Ministers to show men the need of Christ
first, but rather to show the love of God, in giving Christ; and to show and
set forth the John 3.1. Romans 5.9.
riches of Christ's grace to sinners in general; and it is supposed, that all
men do look upon themselves as sinners, and acknowledge themselves to be
sinners, although they have not such a particular and sensible conviction
thereof.

Object. But does not Christ say, that the whole need not the Physician, but
they that are sick, importing, that they must first know their sins, and be
sick with the sense thereof.

Answ. I have, in a printed Sermon, elsewhere answered that Objection, and
cleared that and such Scriptures, yet observe this, that our Savior does not
intend there, So that blessed Gospel Preacher Mr. Bridges expounds the place.
sinners that did see themselves lost, but those that were so; also the gentile
Sinners, with the Jews, so called, and accounted.

Object. But is it not the first work of the Spirit, to convince men of sin,
John 16.8?

Answ. by sin, in that place, is meant, the sin of unbelief, as our
Savior expounds it; of sin, (says he) because they believed not on me, v.
9. and this sin is not convinced by the Law, as I have before declared. For
that which does not command faith, cannot discover that sin which is contrary
to it, even unbelief.

Object. But repentance is the doctrine of the Law, and this was the first
thing that was taught by the Apostles, and is also mentioned as the first
principle, or first thing to be taught.

Answ. Though repentance be sometimes placed before believing, and set down as
the first principle, in Heb. 6. Yet understand what this word repentance
signifies: this word in the Greek, signifies, as much, as alter, or change your
minds, and being spoken to the Jews, doubtless, is meant as much as this,
have other thoughts of Christ, then you have, and believe his Gospel, and do
no more conceive of him, as you have done, as not to be the true Christ. And
Mr. Perkins, on Gal. 3.11. (in answer to an Objection) says, Indeed the Law
does not teach true repentance, neither is it any cause of it, but only
anoccasion: the Gospel only prescribes repentance, and the practice thereof.
And when the Apostle calls it a principle, yet he also there calls it a principle
of the doctrine of Christ, including it in the Gospel, and doubtless a mere
legal repentance, is no way available to salvation.

Object. If the Law be not to be preached first, when, and to whom is the Law
to be preached?

Answ. 1. The Law is to be preached, after the Gospel, and unto justiciaries,
or such as do justify themselves, (as the Jews did) and that think (by
misunderstanding the Law) that they keep the Law, and work the righteousness
that the Law requires. Thus Christ did preach the Law, Matthew. 5. And thus the
Law, in the perfection, and strict demands and conditions of it, is to be
preached.

2. The Law is to be preached when men would absolutely destroy it, and to
those that would make it null, and of none effect: As our Savior said to the
Jews, Think not that Mat. 5.17
I am come to destroy the Law. And as Paul satisfied the Romans, (that thought
he intended, by the doctrine of Justification to destroy the Law) saying; Do
we then Romans 3.31.
make void the Law by Faith? God forbid: Yea, we do establish the Law.

3. The Law is to be preached, and taught unto men, after they do believe in
the mandatory part of it, or so far as it does teach believers their duties
toward God, and Christ; and thus the Apostles in their Epistles did commonly
make use of it. But observe;

1. That the threatenings, and curses of the Law, are not to be taught at all
unto believers, for they do not concern them: neither are the curses of the
Law to take place upon believers, or against them at all, so as to enthrall, or
enslave them again in bondage; for in this sense I showed before, that
believers were not under the Law.

2. The Promises of the Law, are not to be at all preached to believers, so as
to put them upon expectation of living, and being saved thereby; for that is
granted, and passed before through grace, upon the account of Jesus Christ.

3. The duties, and commands of the Law, are not to be urged upon any other
ground, then upon that ground which Christ himself did urge them, which was
this; John 14.1 5.
If ye love me, keep my commandments.

Thus having cleared and ended the second part of this Treatise, which treates
of the Law; now I come to the third and last part, which treats of the Promises.

THE Third PART of this BOOK, Treats upon the Promises which belong to the two
Covenants.
Quest.

WHat did Believers obtain, and do you desire to obtain?

Answ. The fulfilling and inheriting of Gods Promises, Heb. 11.33. and 6.12.

Q. What do you mean by Gods promises?

A. All the free and conditional Engagements of God the Father to Christ, or
of God and Christ to men, which are written in the Scriptures, and distinct
from Commands, and Threatenings.

Q. Is the word promise always taken in Scripture in that sense?

A. No; Sometimes it is taken for the performance of the promise, or for the
thing promised, Luke 24.49. Act. 1.4. Heb. 10.36. and 11.39.

Q What are you to learn and to observe concerning the Promises that you may
obtain them, and partake of them?

A. Six things.

Q What are they?

A. 1 Such Rules as are in the Scriptures for the right and distinct
understanding of them. 2 To whom they do belong, and with whom they are made. 3
Why the promises are made and performed. 4 How they are (and may be) divided. 5
How to apply them rightly; And, 6 How to find suitable promises (both direct
and indirect promises) readily.


The first thing, namely, the Rules to understand the Promises.
Q. WHat are those Rules that you are to observe for the right understanding of
the Promises?

A. 1 That all the promises of God are in themselves true, faithful, Yea, i.e.
true. Amen, i.e. faithful.
and precious, and in Christ (or through him) fulfilled, and performed, 2 Cor.
1.20. 2 Pet. 1.4.

2 That a Promise is put for Promises, and so on the contrary, Gal. 3. 16, 18,
19, 29. compared together.

3 That the Promises were spoken and uttered, some by (a) God the Father,
someby (b) Jesus Christ, some by Judge. 13.3. and 18.22 Mat. 1.20. Luke 1.13 20.
Genesis 16 10.12.
Angels, and some by (c) men (guided in a special manner thereunto by the holy
Spirit) (a) Esa. 42.1, 2, 3. Joel 2.28. with Act. 1.4. (b) Prove. 1.23. Mat.
11.28, 29. Joh. 6.27. Lu. 1.13. to 20. (c) Lam. 3.25. and 3.32, 33.

4 That some Promises are Prophesies, as well as Promises. As for example, Genesis
48.19. and 49.10. Number. 24.7. and 18.15.33.27. Esa. 2.2, 3, 4, and 7.14. Psalm
66.4. and 72.2. to 18 and 146.10. Esa. 40.4, 5. Luke 1.67.76. Deuteronomy. 33.12.38.

5 That some Promises are of the nature of Commands, and may be taken for
Commands as well as for Promises, as Deuteronomy. 12.7.12.18. and 13.11. and 16.15.
Judge. 13.5. 1 Samuel 9 16. 2 King. 17.39. Prove. 4.21. Mat. 22.19.

6 Many Scriptures that are as Promises to the godly, yet are Threatenings to
the wicked, as Psalm. 140.11. Esa. 17.4.17. and 24.13. Jer. 6.3. Ezekiel. 6.10.
Amos 3.12. Nah. 2.13. Zeph. 2.9. Mal. 3.5. and 4.3.

7 Some Scriptures (which are accounted Promises) are rather confident sayings,
and experimental expressions of the Saints upon several occasions (yet true
and proceeding from the Spirit of God in them) these are very many; See a few
for example, Josh. 23.10. Jud. 5.24. 1 Samuel 2.6. to 10. and 2.22, 3. Psalm. 9.9.
Eccles. 8.12. Esa. 17.11.13. and 26.12. Jer. 38.20. Mic. 7.8, 9. Nah. 1.7. Romans
6.14. and 16.20. 1 Cor. 1.8. Phil. 1.6. Ephesians. 4.30. Rev. 15.4.

8 Some Promises are made to some concerning others, as Genesis 16 12, and 17.16.
and 18.10. Number. 11.17. Judge. 12.5. and 13.3.5. 1 Samuel 9.16. 1 King. 21.29. 1
Chro. 17.12. and 22.9.10. Luke 1.13, 14, 15, 16. Act. 9.16. Rom 9.12.

9. Some Promises are purely legal, and conditional (such are See Luther on
Gal. 2.18.
all the Promises of the Law) See Lev. 18.5. Ezekiel 18.21 and 20.11. Deuteronomy. 5.33.
Luke 11.28. Romans 10.5.

10 Some Promises are free, absolute, and without condition (and these are
purely Evangelicall) as the Promises of giving Christ, of giving the Spirit, of
giving a new heart, etc.) See Esa. 42.6. and 49.8. Joel 2.28. Ezekiel. 36.26. Jer.
32.40. Heb. 8.10, 11, 12.

11 Some Promises are partly free, and partly conditional, as Esa. 55.1. Joh.
6.37. and 7.37.38.

12 Some Promises are free in one place, and conditional in another, as Esa.
6.7. Heb 8.11. compared with Lev. 26.3.12. Jer. 24.7. with 7.23.

13. Some Promises in the Old Testament, are Commands virtually in the New
Testament, as Esa. 42.7. and 49.6. with. Act. 13.46.

14 That Promises made in the Old Testament are cited in the New Testament
(especially when they are fulfilled) as Esa. 43.3. with Luke 3.5. See Act.
2.39. and 3.26. and 7.37. and 13.38. and 15.15, 16 Rom 9.15.33. and 11.26. 1
Cor. 3.8. and 2.6.16.18. Gal. 3.8.

15 Some Promises are already perfectly fulfilled, as those concerning the
Incarnation, Death, and Resurrection of Christ, with many others.

16 Some Promises are fulfilled in part, but not wholly, as Esa. 2. Mich. 5.
Heb. 8.

17 Some Promises are not yet fulfilled at all in any part, as the last calling
of the Jews, the coming of Christ in the Clouds, the Resurrection, etc.

18 Some Promises are made only for a season, and the time limited and
expressed for the fulfilling of them, Judge. 20.28. Esa. 17.7. and 19.24. Luke
23.43. 1 King. 17.14. and 2 King. 10.30. Esa. 38.5.

19 Some Promises that are maade with few, may belong to many, as Matthew. 16.18,
19. with 18.18. and 19.28. and 28.20.

20 Some Promises may be made in general, and yet not fulfilled to every man
in particular, as Mar. 16.17, 18. Psalm. 91.7.

21 Some Promises may be spoken in general, concerning some in particular, as
Mat. 16.28. Mark. 9.1. Rev. 17.16.

22 Some Promises are made upon extraordinary occasions, and in an
extraordinary manner, as Number. 20.8. Act. 18.10.

23 Some Promises did relate to the type, and Antitype, or unto those men (as
some Kings, Priests, and Prophets) and unto Christ himself, as 1 Chro. 17.14.
and 22.10. Psalm. 40.15.17. and 72.16, 17, 18. and 89.4, 5, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24.
and 132 17. Luke 1.69. Esa. 22.22, 23, 24.

24 Some Promises do belong unto Christ, and the godly, as Psalm. 91.11, 12,
13, 16. Hag. 2.23.

25 Sometimes God and Christ speak in way of Promises concerning themselves,
and not to any, Esa. 18.4. and 33.10. and 42.8. and 43.13. and 45.7. and 55.13.
and 66.19. Mat. 24.30.

26 Sometimes God makes Promises concerning his Law, and concerning the
irrational creatures, as Esa. 42.21. Matthew. 10.29. Gen 8.21.

27 Some Promises are uttered before they are performed, as if they were
already performed, Josh. 10.8. Esa. 21.9. Rev. 14.8. and 18.2.

28 Sometimes things that are done by God for his people (though not directly
promised before) are noted as Promises, Esa. 25.4. and 44.22. and 54.9.

29 Some Promises are to be understood both literally and spiritually, as
Numb. 21.8. Hag. 2.7, 9. Zach. 1.16. Mat. 9.13. Joel 2.32. with Romans 10.13.
Mar. 10.30.

30 Sometimes spiritual deductions and inferences drawn from natural reasons,
are noted for Promises, as Matthew. 7.11. Luke 18.6, 7, 8. and 2.28.

31 Some Promises may be applied both to Jews and Gentiles, as Esa. 19.23.24
25. and 25.7. and 32.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Esa. 35.10. and 42.7. and 44.3, 4, 5. and
49.9, 10, 11. and 51.3, 4, 5, 6.11. and 53.10, 11, 12. and 54.13. Mich. 4.1, 2,
3. Zach. 2.11.

32 Some Promises may be understood of the double restoration of the Jews, or
of their Redemption out of the Captivity of Babylon, and their Redemption out
of their present Captivity, as Esa. 52.12. and 57.13, 14, 15, and 14.5, 6, 7,
8. Zach. 2.12. and 8.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13.

33 Some Promises are made by some men unto other men, as Ier. 38.24.

34 Sometimes general Promises are applied in particular, as 1 Kings 8.37.40.
with 2 Chronicles. 20.8.10.

35 Sometimes the same Promises that is particular in one place, is made
general in another place, as 2 Samuel 7.14. with Psalm. 89.29, 32.

36 Sometimes one and the same Promise is applied in several cases, as 1 Cor.
10.26, and 28. and Josh. 1.5. compared with Heb, 13.5. that Promise which was
made to Joshua against fear, is applied to the Hebrews against covetousness.

37 God does oftentimes repeat and renew the same Promises. See Gen 12.3. and
22.18. and 26.4. and 28.14.

38. Some Promises are only typical Promises (if I may so call them) or
Promises made through the Type, yet with the relation to the Antitype, as to
accept of men's offerings for to make atonement for them, and their sins, Lev.
1.4. Number. 15.25, 26, 28.

39 Some Promises are made by God unto particular men, as Exodus 3.12. Deuteronomy.
31.23. Joel 1 5, 6, 7. Judge. 6.16. and 20.28. 1 Samuel 9 9.16. and 10.6. 2 Samuel
7.12, 13. 1 King. 3.14. and 9.5. and 11.38. and 17.14. 2 King. 20.5, 6. and
22.20. 1 Chro. 28.6, 7. 2 Chronicles. 5.12. and 7.18. and 34.28. Esa. 38.5. Ier.
8.19. and 15.19, 20, 21. Luke 24 45. Ioh. 1.50. and 13.36. Act. 18.10. Matthew.
10.19. Act. 1.8. Also to particular women, Genesis 16.10. Judge. 13.3. Luke 1.31,
32, 33.

40 Sometimes God made Promises in answer to men's prayers. See Exodus 14.19, 20.
Judge. 20.28. 1 King. 9.3 and 2.20.5, 6.

41 Sometimes God gives Promises to men as reasons to move them to do their
duties, Deuteronomy. 14.2.

42 Some Promises are made by good men to God (and these are called Vows)
Psalm. 66.13, 14. and 119.32.47, 57. Genesis 28.20, 21, 22. Judge. 11.30, 31.

43 Sometimes Promises are made by God, but applied by some men unto other men,
Deuteronomy. 9.3.

44 In Gospel days, Afflictions, Tribulations, and Persecutions are in the
nature of Promises unto the Saints. See Mark. 10.30. Matthew. 5.11. Heb. 12.6.

45 As the Jews under the Law had more temporal and fewer spiritual
promises; so Believers under the Gospel have more spiritual, and fewer
temporal Promises.

The second thing, viz. to whom the Promises do belong.
Q. TO whom do the Promises belong?

A. Either unto Jesus Christ, or unto men.

Q. What are those Promises that do belong unto Jesus Christ?

15 That he should reign and execute justice on the earth, Ier. 23.6. and
33.15. Zach. 6.16. Mic. 4.7.

Q. To what manner of men, or to what kind of men do (or did) the Promises
belong?

A: To Jews and Gentiles.

Q. Why do you distinguish between the Jews and Gentiles?

A. Because that there were and are many Promses that were and are made to the
Jews more properly and peculiarly, which did relate to them whilst they were a
Church formerly, and will concern them hereafter at their conversion.

Q. What are those Promises that did belong (and do belong) to the Gentiles?

A. Most or all of the spiritual promises made to the Jews do belong (and may
be applied) to the Gentiles: But to instance in a few that did more peculiarly
belong to them. See Hos. 1.10. and 2.23. Romans 5 26. Amos 9.11. with Acts 15.16.
Mal. 1.11. Esa. 2.3, 4. and 11.10. and 19.22.24. and 30.25.32.16. and 35.1, 2,
3.42.16. and 56, 8. Jer. 12.16. and 16 19. Ezekiel. 16.61. and 17.23. Matthew. 4 11.
Luke 13.29. Matthew. 12.21. Romans 15.12. Matthew. 21.43. and 24.14.

Q. But are there not particular things promised unto the Gentiles as well as
to the Jews?

A. Yes, but most of them are spiritual promises, which you shall find
gathered together underseveral heads, in answer to the last question.

Q. Why does the Lord make and perform his promises?

A. 1 For his own glory (which is the highest and chiefest end of all his
actions) Esa. 60.21. John 14.13. 2 Cor. 1.20.

2 For his own names sake ( viz. Christ is the maine cause of making and
performing all the promises, and also the substance of them all, called the
Covenant it self, Esa. 42.6 and 49.8.
Christ, or his gracious Attributes) Esa. 43.25. and 48.9.11. Ezekiel. 39.25. Also
because of his own Sovereignty, Exodus 19.5. Rev. 17.14. as particularly his
love, and loving kindness, Esa. 43.4. Luke 6.35. and his zeal, 2 King. 19.31.
his faithfulness, 1 Thessalonians. 5.24.

3 Because they are adopted and married to him, 1 Samuel 12.22. Jer. 31.9. and
3.14. Exodus 20.24.

4 To encourage and comfort his people, Deuteronomy. 10.8. Luke 21.17, 18. Ioh. 15.11.

5 That he himself may be more feared, and the people (that sin against him)
more ashamed of themselves, Psalm. 130.4. Ezekiel. 16.60, 61, 62, 63.

6 Sometimes for the sake of the Parents (or the sake of others) Ier. 11 5.
Romans 11.28. Genesis 21.13.

7 Sometimes God is pleased to give this as a reason that his people do and
perform somewhat, which he counts worthiness in them (though indeed none can
plead worthiness) Josh. 6.17. 1 King. 21.29. Ier. 39.18. Rev. 3.4.

8 God is pleased to take occasion from their very sins to make and perform
some promises to his people. See Genesis 8.21. Esa. 57.18, 19. Hos. 2.13, 14.

Q. How are the promises to be applied, and to be made use of?

A. First, Understandingly, as the Apostle exhorted the Ephesians, not to be
unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is, Ephesians. 5.17. Many may say
of the promises, as Job said, I uttered that I understood not, things too
wonderful for me, which I knew not, Job 42.3.

The Disciples of Christ Mar. 9.32 Luke 18.32
were, and doubtless believers still are, very ignorant in understanding the
promises; therefore that you may apply the promises understandingly, consider
these ensuing particulars:

1 Consider in what estate or condition you judge your self to be in, whether
a sinner, and unbeleever, or a Saint, and believer? If you judge your self to
be a sinner, then you must apply your self to those promises that are suitable
to sinners. As that Christ dyed for the ungodly, and for sinners; And that
Christ came into the world to save sinners, To. 5.6, 8.

Object. But my case is this, that I do not know whether I am an unbeleever, or
a believer.

Ans. If it be so with you, then you must either put it to the worst, and
suppose your self to be an unbeliever (and so begin the world again, as the
Proverb is; I mean, go as a sinner, to seek out Christ in some suitable promise
as I mentioned before) or else you must look to those promises made for
assurance, and there is your most proper legacy, and through that door you must
expect the Lord to come out to you.

2 You are to consider whether you come to the promises as one that has no
conditions, or as one that has conditions. If you find no conditions in you,
then you must not go to a conditional promise; but if you find the
conditions in you, then are you to address your self to those promises that
are suitable for you, and may relieve you therein.

Object. I pray you clear unto me what you mean by having the conditions in
me?

Answ. I mean thus, that some soul may say, I am hungry and thirsty after
Christ, and I am heavy and weary laden, and I would lay my burden upon Jesus
Christ. Now such a soul has the conditions and qualifications, that are
mentioned in some promises: As blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness, for they shall be filled. And the heavy and weary laden they
shall find rest to their souls, Matthew. 5.6. and 11.28, 29.

Object. But what if I have not those conditions in me, as to feel my self,
hungry, thirsty, and heavy laden?

Answ. If you find not these, or such conditions in you, then you are not to
apply your self to those promises, that are made to such as have those
conditions in them. But you are to seek out for other (and more suitable)
promises, which are absolute, and without condition.

Object. Are there any promises absolute, and without condition?

Answ. Yes, I have showed this before in one of the Rules concerning the
Promises. But to instance in a few; there is a promise of justification Es.
43.25
I am be (says God) that blotteth out thy transgressions for my own names
sake. So also in another place, Ez. 36.25
I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean. So there is a
promise of pouring out of the Spirit, God promises to Joel. 2.28
pour it out upon all flesh. Many more I might instance in, as of giving a Ez.
36.26
new heart, and taking the stony heart out of their flesh.

3 Understand this that in many of the Promises men are considered passively,
or such as can do nothing till God does work in them. As that in John, And
they shall be taught of God. Joh. 6.45
Say you in this case as David Ps. 119.49
said, Remember thy word (unto thy servant) in which thou have caused me to
hope.

4 Consider in applying, and using the promises, that where God has not
excluded men, they ought not to exclude themselves; lest they sin as much in
refusing grace, as others do in abusing it.

5 In the application of the Promises, look not only upon the words, but upon
him that has spoken them; and consider in God, 1 His Power that he can peform
them, Heb. 11.19. Romans 4.21. 2 His Faithfulness that he will perform them,
Heb. 10.23 and 11.11. 1 Thessalonians. 5.24. and his oath, Luke 1.72.73. 3 His
Remembrance of his Promise, He is ever mindful of his Covenant, Psalm. 111.5.
See Esa. 49.15. 4 His Goodness that he will perform his word, though men
should neglect their duty, and the condition on their part, Mich. 7.20. 2 Timothy
2.13.


6 That you may apply the Promises understandingly, consider that the whole
Story of the New Testament is a bundle of Promises, and a rich Treasury of
Jewels, and a precious Mine opened to enrich, and store you with all manner of
graces and blessings. Therefore if you cannot remember a particular promise for
every thing you would have, or want, yet take the honycombe (I mean the
Gospel) into your hand, and you may fill your mouth with the honey that comes
out thereof. I conceive that the ground of believers faith (especially fince
Christ revealed in the flesh) is the history of the New Testament, and we are
not to hang our souls now, as they did before Christ came, upon one nail and
pin, or upon one promise, but upon the great pillars of our Faith, viz. The
death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. And so to conclude our justification
and salvation from the whole tenor of the Gospel and New Testament, as Paul
did, Gal. 2.20. 1 Timothy 1.15.

7 In the right using of the promises, you are to look upon the Ephesians. 3.6.
person of Christ, together with his propitiation and intercession, as the
cause, medium, or means, and that does entitle you to, and give you an interest
in, and a virtue and blessing from, and through the Promises, 2 Cor. 1.20. Joh.
1.16. Romans 11.36.

8 You are not to rest upon the person of the Mediator Christ only, but you
are to make the Father the object (or as some call him the ultimate object) of
your faith and hope, and so by him ( i.e. Christ) to believe in God, 1 Pet.
1.21.

Object. Do you mean that we should look upon the Father as a remote object,
or an object beyond Christ.

Answ. No, you are not to look upon God the Father as an object out of Christ,
nor yet beyond Christ; but as a distinct object from Christ. As he said to his
Disciples, Joh. 14.1
Ye believe in God, believe also in me; and as the Apostle speaks distinctly of
repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ: Look upon the
Father and Christ, as Stephen did, as being distinct, though yet one. This
mystery I rather admire, then undertake to reveal. Having cleared this first
rule or means, for the applying of the Promises, I come to the second.

Secondly, the Promises are to be applied orderly, for as God is the God of
order, so he will have his children and people to act, and do all orderly. For
the orderly applying of the Promises consider:

1 That you are to apply every promise according to the intent of the Promiser,
and according to the nature of the Promise, as the promise of Justification,
when you look to be justified; and the promise of Sanctification, when you
seek sanctification. Many do very improperly and impertinently urge the
Promises of God. Would it not be improper for a condemned Malefactor to beg an
estate, money, or clothes of his Prince, before he had begged his life; so is
it for a man to beg more holiness and grate, before he begs pardon and
forgiveness. Therefore in the first place look for Justification.

2 To apply the Promises orderly, is to apply the promises of grace, before the
promises of glory. Men are not to look upon the promises of salvation, before
they look upon the promises of Justification, adoption, and Sanctification: For
God saves none, nor will save none, but those that are first justified,
sanctified, and adopted; This is as if a woman should lay claim to a man's
estate, before she is married to him.
He first gives grace, and then glory, Psalm. 84.11.

Thirdly, the Promises are to be applied particularly; as Paul said, Christ
loved me, and gave himself for me, and Christ came into the world to save
sinners of whom I am chief. The promises are always to be particularly, and
singularly believed, as Joh. 11.26
Christ said to Martha, Beleevest thou this? And as Act. 8.37
Phillip spoke to the Eunuch, If thou beleevest, etc. And the promises still
run upon a particular application; as Act. 13.39
He that believes is justified; and in Joh. 3.36
another place, He that believes shall be saved.

Object. But the Promises are made in general, and not in particular.

Answ. Yet general promises may and ought to 1 King. 8.37.40 with 2 Chr.
20.8.10.
be applied in particular.

Fourthly, the Promises are to be applied self-denyingly. There is no looking
upon the conditions and terms of the Law, if we would look upon the Gospel, and
the promises thereof: And when we apply to Christ, we must apply our selves to
him as Gal. 2.17
sinners; and if we look toward his righteousness, we must look off our own
righteousness; To. 9.15
so that the soul must see nothing in self, nor done by self, to move God
either to make, or perform his promises; but you must cry, Grace, Grace, is
the ground of all.

Fifthly, the Promises are to be applied strongly and undoubtingly, Esa. 7.9.
for men can never be established unless they believe confidently: And of all
duties, believers are most slow and backward to believe the promises; therefore
does Christ very often Mat. 14 31. and 17.20. Mar. 16 14. Lu. 24 25. Mat. 28 17.
check his Disciples for their doubting, and unbeleeving. And this is spoken
in commendation of Abraham (the father of the faithful) that he To. 4.20.
staggered not at the promise, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.

Object. But all the promises are not to be believed absolutely and
confidently, for some of them are conditional promises.

Answ. 1 Its true, that many of the promises are conditional; as the promises
that belong to the well-being of Christians, which relate to their souls after
they do believe, and are made Christians. As for instance, The promise of
Christ's manifestation to the soul; and the promise of salvation, these two are
special promises that relate to the soul, yet not to the being of Christians,
but to their well-being; and the conditions of these are mentioned in those
promises: As, If any man keep my Commandments (says Christ) Joh. 14.2^
I will love him, and will manifest my self unto him; and be that believes on
me shall never Ioh. 3.16 and 10.28.
perish, but have everlasting life. These are conditions of the manifestation
of grace, and giving of glory; but not of the first working, and giving of
grace, as I showed before.

2 There be outward promises that concern the bodies of men that are
conditional. As, Psalm. 39.9
There is no want to them that fear the Lord. And 1 Timothy 4.8.
Godliness has the promise of the life that now is. Now there be none but
those that fear God, and are godly, that can lay claim to these promises.

Object. But when I see my self so vile and naught, and my heart so sinful,
how can I have that confidence in Gods promises?

Answ. It is not any thing that you can find in your self that is (or ought
to be) the ground of your faith and hope; but you must say as the Prophet said,
Though my Ps. 31.10
strength fails because of mine iniquity, and though my Ps. 40.12
flesh, and my heart, and my Ps 143.7.
spirit fails, Psalm. 119 81.
yet I will hope in thy word. Learn in this case to To. 4.18
hope (or believe as Abraham did) against hope; and as Heb. 11.11
Sarah that considered not the deadness of her own wembe, but rested upon the
word of promise. And say as Mary Luke 1.38
said, Be it unto me according to thy word. For Ioh. 20.29.
blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

Object. But God has long promised, and I have a long time waited and
expected, and yet he performs not his promise.

Ans. Though some count God slackin performing his promises, yet he is sure,
and his promises Confirmed by Gods oath Heb. 6.17.
certain, and Psalm. 77.8
never fail: Therefore the children of Abraham, should be like their Father,
and wait patiently, that they might obtain the promise; as its Heb. 11.15.
said of him, After he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

Thus having showed how the Promises are applied, I come now to show how they
are divided.

Q. How are the Promises divided?

A. Several ways.

Either, 1 Absolute, or Conditional. 2 Evangelicall, or Legal. 3 General, or
Particular. 4 Real, or Personal. 5 Common, or Special. 6 Principal, or
less principal. 7 Direct, or by consequence. 8 Spiritual, temporal, or
eternal, or promises for the life that now is, or that which is to come. 9
Informing, or Assuring.

Q. How shall I find the Promises readily, and according to my occasions?

A. Here follows a vary ready way, for I have set them down Alphabetically,
or according to the Letters, beginning with A but note four things further:

1 That I do forbear to put down the words of the Promises, because you may
search in Gods own Book for them.

2 I do not begin with spiritual promises, and then temporal, and eternal;
but in regard this is only for the finding of them, I have put them down
rather Alphabetically, and in a Concordantial way.

3 I have put the informing Promises (or such Promises as do give light, but
do not run absolutely) upon the left side of the Page under the words
Informing Promises, and the absolute Promises upon the right side of the Page,
under the words Assuring Promises. I was willing also to make a third Column
(or part) in the Page, to show how the Saints did apply those Promises, but the
narrowness, and littleness of the Leaf would not bear that.

4 Where there are double Promises, as Promises made of such a grace, and then
to such a grace, therein I begin with the first, and put the word Of in the
margent on the left hand, and then the word To following, which you will
quickly and easily discern: And herein also I thought to begin with absolute
Promises, and those made with sinners at first, and then with conditional
Promises made to Saints, but this I thought would be a more dark and doubtful
way.

An Alphabeticall and easy way to find both Informing and Assuring Promises,
as they concern men's several states and conditions.
