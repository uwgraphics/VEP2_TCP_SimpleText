The plain Englishman.
BEloved Countrymen, you must expect no rare Oratory, no fine Phrases, no
exordium or declaration as the Schoolmen use; but only a piece of his mind
who wishes well to you all, being dressed in your native language, and my
chiefest care is not to use glossing speeches but to draw out a thread of truth
both to your own, and my good; for plainness is the best companion; and if
that were more exercised, falsehood would be turned out of doors like a
vagabond, and Sincerity entertained like a Prince: from deceit springs
contention, but where truth keeps Court within, there will be no sad effects
without. Cicero gave this commendation of truth, that it was praiseworthy,
though no man praise it, and I most (worthy Countrymen) shall endeavor to
narrate it, though I get a scratcht face. Consider how mightily you are
degenerated from your first Principles; England was formerly a Situation of
strength, and an Island that has defeated the great Armadoes of foreign
Nations; but when we did this we were all united as one man, loving to each
other, and Peace was the fruit of this, and happy, nay, double happy is that
Nation which injoyeth it: Man is created a sociable creature, and God has so
blessed him, that there is no man so barren, but he has something wherewith all
to profit others, and every man being imperfect, we ought to help one
another; but we instead of friends are enemies, instead of preservers are
destroyers, Seneca says, the nearest friendship is the conjunction of the
mind, truly I am of that opinion, where the judgments disagree, the love
cannot be real; then sadly may we lament our Land, where scarce two men in all
things agree together, he that was the wisest of all, laid down this, that a
house divided cannot stand, that instance in particular reached to the general,
that where there is not a concomitancie among the Governors of a Weal, it
will suddenly fall like an old building, molter away like an aged garment, and
as soon vanish as the rays of Titan, and now (dear Countrymen) view in what
a laborinth of confusion, in what a Chaos of trouble we now are in, the Land
is spoiled, the Rulers rejected, the Subjects rebellious, and destruction the
follower of these, puts forward like an armed man, and surely it is a great
judgment, that Englands savators shall be its destroyers, those that were
chosen for it is good, shall work it is ruin. It is the fault of too many
Statesmen, that they respect their private interest before the public good.
Anaobarsis the Philosopher said, there was no council that was good, but what
proceeds from the man that disregards his own ends, and Plato commends those
that keep the Commonwealth in Peace by their policy and in the time of war
defend it by their magnanimity. We have had wise Senators, but as the finest
cloth is incident to moaths, the hard Iron torust, and the most curious glass
to be broken, so the best of men are subject to mishap. Some blame the King,
others the Parliament, a third the Army, in truth great ones are corrupt; But
we our selves are the cause of our own misery, from our hatred of one another
springs our afflictions, and to make the Original of our distress more
apparent, we give several terms of obliquy and disgrace to each other, to
exasperate us all to our own ruin. Let us consider the danger we are in, and
stand upon our reputation let not other Nations say of England, that we could
not conquer it, but it will overcome it self. Cast your eyes about and see
what an unusual Metamorphisis, a strange Catastrophe our Land's become, every
one endeavors to bring destruction a though most protest against. Our civil
war (which of all war is the most unnatural) has in part depopulated our
Kingdom but that storm is over, that trouble is vanquished, that judgment is
dissipated, and yet Peace comes not. Argue out the reason by love, not by the
Sword, with meekness, not with contention, lay aside that spirit of
bitterness, and with joint consent endeavor to find out the Achans of our
Commonwealth. Let not the mercy that is bestowed be repelled, let not eminent
favors be slighted, the healing of a Nation despised, but when any good comes,
any love is showed, let it be embraced, for it is my Petition, that differences
in Religion may not breed factions in the State; for do but consider against
whom our enemies were bent, not against strangers, not against an enemy, not
against Tyrants, but against our Countrymen, our friends, our kinsmen, and
what greater bonds, what nearer relations then these. Let not the head remain
as a captive by our jarres, the body as imperfect by our differences, the
strength of the Kingdom be imbezell'd by our discentions, but let us all in a
bond of amity labor to settle that Royal Person so long wished for, in his
Throne; the Philosopher in the first Book of his Politics, proves by four
natural reasons, that Princes ought to command, and Subjects to obey; it is
likewise commanded by God, and seeing it is instituted by one and confirmed by
the other then as our duty to the first, and our obligation to the last; we are
to maintain that Government: when the course of justice is stopped, it is the
time for the foes of the Weal to reign, and men of bad principles will do no
good voluntarily. I fear we have had too many such spirits, which makes the
rent wider; yet not so wide, but if the King will come and be a nursing Father,
and we shall be a happy people; so the wishes of some will be frustrated, the
expectations of others satisfied, and the general content of most will be
enjoyed. Yet we must allow of that saying of the wise man, In the multitude of
Councillors there is safety, experience teaches, for our liberty would have
been inthrall'd, tyranny would have been advanced, and oppression the share of
it, were not for a Parliament; for as a great ship requires a cunning Pilot,
and a young traveller a skillful guide, so does the unweldy body of a State
stand in need of good Councillors Soloman peerless in wisdom had his
Councillors about him, good council being much availeable to the Weal, and
as it is the saying of one. He that uses many Councels is not easily
deceived, it is the great Organ of the Commonwealth, nay the very life
thereof, but perhaps you will say of late the Council has been bad, the
Counselors have been corrupt, and the effect of these has been naught; true
it is, that standing Pooles gather filth, and the finest Gold dross, and the
best Jewel is in danger to be spoiled, and shall we cast away those
profitable things, because of their discommodities, truly he that would rather
dye then use water, because it gathers Mud, or refuse Gold because it catches
dross, or deny a rich Jewel, because it is subject to be lost, you will
reckon him to be a Fool, and if we should refuse good Counsel; because some
of the Counselors are naught, I should give you such a title, as he that
thinks to catch a Hare with a Taber does deserve, and let us not reject
Authority, but strive to purge away the evil members, so will Peace come, and
the Subjects have content, and the Rulers delight. And seeing I am fallen to
speak of the Government of the Kingdom, give me leave a little to speak
something boldly by way of caution, to a third predominant party, viz. The Army
to give them their due, they have done valiantly, behaved themselves gallantly,
and have carried their business wisely, and if we should dis-respect them,
when they have accomplished their work, we might justly bring disgrace upon
our own heads; yet I would not have them like the skittish Cow, which having
given a good paile of milk, afterward casts it down with her heel; or like
the Ostridge, which having laid her eggs, never after regards them; wisdom
will make future actions suitable to former deeds, understanding men will not
derogate from the thing they first aimed at, they professed their actions were
for the good of the Subject, and I hope so are their intentions still, and
although hypocrisy is spun with a very fine thread, yet let us live in hope
beyond hope.

True it is, we have a good head, a wise body, and a strong foot, yet here is
our misery, our sore, our disease, all these are severed. Gentlemen my
Conscience would give me flatly the lie, if I should not confess this, that
variety of colors makes the best show, and all the strings tuned causes the
pleasantest music, and a concordance among the Rulers makes the best
government; but the reason why our Governors are disunited is, by our
dissentions, our division makes them side into parties, even to the hazard of
the Land, whereas if we were united, they would be happy in our conjunction,
and we blessed in their agreement; whereas now our Cities are ruined, our
treasure's exhausted, our trading's decayed, and those things which were the
sinews of our life are cut off, those great immunities inthrall'd, our
plentiful fields droope, our great Cities mourn, because of our rents, and
even the senseless creatures that possess our Land, read a lecture to us of
our following misery, and shall we be so void of reason, as not to shun that
which bruites foretell us.

And Country men, let me premise you of that heroic spirit that was in our
predecessors, they were as one man against all intruders, hating the very name
of a usurper, they were men that put themselves forth for their Countries
service, but we act for its ruin; they purchased renown where ever they
came, but we disgrace; they had the spirits of men, but we the hearts of
cowards; for if there was any good in us, we could not behold our State
turning our Religion, perverting, our government altering, and we the cause.
And yet I cannot but confess, that in those times there was as well the Spider
for poison, as the Be for honey, and the cunning Fox as well as the innocent
Dove, and men of corrupt principles as well as those worthy men I speak of;
yet they were not suffered to be their masters, and if they did taste too much
of Soveraigetie, yet justice did at last take hold on them, for the Nobles
scorned it, the Gentry envied it, and the Commonaltie hated it, and where there
was so grand a conspiracy against so base a thing, doubtless it would down:
But it is far different now, for the adversaries of our Land have many
abetters, and Rebellion having set up her Standerd, multitudes flock to it, and
as if we had lost our judgments, we endeavor to maintain these that are our
miseries.

Gentlemen, be not wrath when you see the Grandees of the Kingdom questioned,
when they are called to an account for their carriage, so long as they are
corrupt; for till it is a pleasure to embrace thorns, or to carry hot coals
in ones hand, or a stinging Serpent in ones bosom, then and not till then, can
I approve of bad men; for it is they that make the mischief, that raise the
trouble, that breed the distractions, and till these are taken away, you must
look for no Peace.

But shall good men be slighted because some are bad, this is that which
provokes me to fury, when I see eminent men, wise men, deserving men, turned
out of Office. I grant, that such things there are, but how will you remedy
them, not by drawing a Sword against a party stronger then your self; For a
wise Captain and a good warrier, will never do so; but beside this, consider
who you engage against, who you oppose, who you threaten destruction to; it is
against a part of your self, for this Kingdom is a body Politic, every man
is a member, and can the members suffer and the body rejoice, can they be in
misery and it in delight? No, surely no the welfare of every man is concerned
in the whole, and we ought as fellow members to endeavor the good of all: But
see moreover, how you put your selves out of a capacity to finish that you
intend, division brings nothing to perfection, danger is an attendant upon
contention, and if you look about you, you shall find your selves almost at the
brinke of destruction; for you are first a prey for an enemy, a prise for
famine, a burden to your selves; and lastly, immediate ruin will be your
portion if you continue: and if you would amend what you think amiss, it is by
an agreement a lincking of your strength together, must be the means, and oh,
were but I a good Orator to persuade you for the best, or a skilful Painter to
portrayt your misery, that so you might entertain the one, and avoid the other:
but being illiterated in the one, and unskilful in the other, you must take
me as I can best deliver my self, but this by the way, for to proceed
further. Let me tell you, the black and swarthy visage of the other war
makes me long for Peace; and I think it would never be more welcome then now.
Mars thought Venus most lovely when she sat by Vulcan: and Peace compared
with war will be more esteemed; yet here is our disease, our sore, our
affliction, that the Vein that is opened bleeds inwardly, and I fear our
heart blood is almost come out which makes us dangerous in the one, almost
incurable in the other, and desperate in the third; so that we stand in need
of a Godly Minister, a good Chyrurgion, and a wise Physician, and all these we
have and yet help comes not; truly the reason is, because we despise,
disregard, and reject them all; for Prayer here is scolding, for healing
hurting, for curing wounding; so that when there will be a period of our
misery none knows. Every one prays for Peace, wishes for Peace, and desire
Peace, and yet almost none uses the means; but if any thing is done contrary
to their humor, they fly out into extremes, as if ruin did not approach fast
enough, think not it is with us as with a Diamond, which lies in the fire and
is not consumed, or like the Christiall which touches the Toad and is not
poisoned, or the bird Trochilus, that lives in the mouth of the Crocodile, and
is not spoiled; for we are subject to be consumed, venomed, and destroyed,
and many other inconveniences beside these; therefore let us not go about to
destroy our selves, you would reckon him a mad man that goes to make a wound
where none is, and him to be a fool, that had rather have sickness then
health, and yet we are so besotted to our ruin, that we move like men void
of reason.

O let not England be branded with such folly, stigmatized with such a
disgrace, as to be guilty of its own destruction. And yet a Leopard may as
soon change his spots, and an Ethyopian his hiew, before some man can alter
their dispositions; but I hope I shall not find all such crooked Cammocks, such
knotty pieces, and of such sorded natures; for though all men be made of one
metal, yet they are not cast in one mould, and though some may refuse this to
their ruin, yet others may embrace for their good: and seeing I have brought
you thus far, give me leave a little to trespass upon your patience, do
but consider the many Widows we have, the many Orphans, in whose very faces
you may read a Petition for relief, the maimed Soldiers, whose misery echo
in our ears, and O England O unhappy England is all thy help but a sigh.

And can you behold this, and will you not seek to amend it, truly when I
behold the unnaturalness that is amongst us, I cannot but think Abetto Mejere
and Cissiphons have taken up their quarters in our Dominions, and that they
have a peen jar habitation in each man's spirit; for the very Heathens have a
better agreement then we; and yet reckon them to be in ignorance and a veil
of obscurity to be upon them, and we in our light, our new light, in our
shining light, will not strive to hinder those things which in Hirogliphicks
speak our ruin; for as if every one was full of Achonite we spill poison in
one another faces, all of us are contriving which way to do the most
mischief. Oh! Let us not make our misery an abbysse, our troubles endless:
let not our pleasures be an Adonis to bewitch us so to them; that we can cast
no affectionate eye upon the public.

Fabricius the Roman was famous because a contemner of riches, but infamy will
be our lot; because we desire them to the danger of the State, our Land is a
plentiful soil, which makes it worse to endure extremity, for the finest
Christ all is sooner crazed then the hard Marble, the finest silk soonest
soyled, and the sweetest Wine turns to the sharpest Vinegar, so that Kingdom
that has enjoyed Peace for a long time, will be soonest wasted with war.

There is not the like Land in the world as ours it, we are at variance
amongst our selves, at enmity with our Brethren, and ready to go war against
our kinsmen, whereas they are united, joining together against the common
adversary, Oh! let us sadly lament our Land, for every love has its salve,
every beast his cure, the Dog surfeting eareth grass, and procures his vomit
and finds remedy, the Heart being wounded, runs to the herb Dictanuns and is
healed, and has all these help and is there no Balm for England, no Colloquin
ida to purge its Cho^er, has all its Physicians given it up as desperate, does
its States men, its Ministers, look when it will give the last gasp, its
impossible two contraries can consist in one subject, light and darkness are
inconsistant, fire and water are repugnart and do we think contention and
Peace will link together, truly if we do, we mistake, for the Sun and
Moon shall as soon stand still, and the heavens alter their course, the
ebbing and flowing of the Sea cease, before these two can agree, feed not your
selves with fancies; dally not too long with edged tools, wade not too far
in the stream, for fear you cannot return, but let us all Implore the
assistance of the Almighty, and then with love go to repair the breaches of
our Land. Perhaps you will say, it is too late: I must confess I fear it, yet
I do not despair of it.

Physicians say so long as there is life, there is hope, though our Kingdom is
dangerous, yet there is breath; and let us follow that maxim, though we are
unskilful in the faculty, The Sick man knows best where his pain lies, our
Misery is within our selves; then let us make known our Grievauces by way of
Petition to the KING, and the PARLIAMENT, and by way of recommendation to the
ARMY; entreating the first, to Consider; the second, to Consult; the third, to
Disband; that so the public Quarrel might be stated, the causes of our
Afflictions found out; for now every man cries out blaming several parties,
imputing the Cause to this, others to that, and yet truly is ignorant of the
Cause; Thus (Gentlemen) you see in what a condition we are in by our
differences, whereas if they were laid aside we might be in a better estate
then before.

Let us not therefore stand in our own light, but as free borne Englishmen
pull down usurpers, and prevent that which otherwise we must expect; That
Justice may have his course, and every one his right, that so Peace may take
its habitation in our Land, which is or at least should be the cordial wish
of every true Englishman.

Vale.

Imprimatur, JOHN DOWNHAM.
