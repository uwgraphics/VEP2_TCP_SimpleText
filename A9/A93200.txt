A short Catechism.
Quest. HOw did God make man?

Answ. After his own Image, Genesis 1.27.

Q What is the Image of God?

A. The Image of God is a resemblance of his holiness and righteousness, and
his other attributes created in man, Genesis 1.27. compared with Psalm. 145.7.
Exodus 34.6. Eccles. 7.29. Ephesians. 4.24. Col. 3.10.

Q. Did man continue in this Image?

A, No: Adam lost it for himself, and all us, in eating the forbidden fruit.

Q How came we to lose this image by his sin?

A. First, because Adam was a public person, and we being in his loins, his
sin was imputed to us, Romans 5 12.19. and so we were all accounted sinners in
his offense.

Secondly, the separation of the image of God, being the spiritual death,
happened unto all men by him; because all men were accounted sinners in him,
Romans 5 12.14.16,17,18.

Q. What followed up on the loss of this Image?

A. First, we are all born without this image.

Secondly, we are therefore born in sin, and conceived in iniquity, Psalm. 51.5.

Because being born with power to think, speak, and do; and wanting this image,
which should teach, or guide us to think, speak, and do aright, we must needs
sin in all these.

Q. How many kinds of sin is there?

A. Two, Original, and Actual.

Q. What is Original sin?

A. Original sin is an inclination of the whole man to all evil, and that
continually, Genesis 6.5.

Q. What is Actual sin?

A. Actual, is a breach of the Law of God, in thought, word or deed, 1 Io.
3.4. Pr. 24 9. Mat. 12

Q. How do we break the Law of God?

A. We break the Law of God, when we do those things which God has forbidden,
and leave undone those things which God has commanded, Romans 7.19.

Q. What are the wages of sin?

A. The wages of sin is eternal death, To. 6.23.

Q. Is there no way to avoid this death?

A. There is no way for a sinner to escape eternal death, but only by Jesus
Christ, Act. 4.12.

Q. What has Christ suffered for us?

A. First, Jesus Christ has born our sins, 1 Pet. 2.24. Heb. 9.28. 2 Cor.
5.21. Secondly, he has suffered the wrath of God due to us for sin, 1 Pet.
3.18. 1 Cor. 15.3.

Q. What has Christ done for us.

A. First, he has fulfilled the Law, which we ought to have kept, Mat.
5.17,18. Romans 10.5. Secondly, he has merited a Crown of righteousness by
fulfilling that Law, Phil. 2.9. Heb. 2.9. Heb. 12.2.

Q. What benefit have we by his sufferings!

A. He will not impute those fins to us which he has born, 2 Cor. 5.19. Nor
lay that wrath upon us, which he has suffered, Romans 5.9. 1 These. 1.10.

Q. What benefit have we by his doings?

A. First, God will impute his righteousenesse to us in fulfilling the Law,
Romans 5.10. Romans 10.5. Secondly, he will give us his Crown of glory, which his
Son has merited by his righteousness, Joh. 17.22. Col. 3.4. Heb. 9.24. Ioh.

Q. What be the main privileges we have by Christ?

A. First, we are justified freely by his grace, Act. 13.39. Romans 3.24.
Secondly, we are sanctified by his spirit, 1 These. 5.23. And the image we lost
in Adam, is restored in Jesus Christ, Romans 8.28. 1 Cor. 15.49. Thirdly, we are
adopted and made the sons of God, 1 Ioh. 1.12. Gal. 3.26. Fourthly, all the
promises be made, Yea, and Amen, to us in Christ, 2 Cor. 1.20. Heb. 9.15.

Q. Can any man live without sin?

A. No: For the most righteous man that is, sins in many things, Iam. 3.2.
Eccles. 7.20. 1 King. 8.46.

Q. What must we do to avoid the danger of sin?

A. First, when we have committed any sins, we must confess them to God, Ier.
3.13. Secondly, we must judge our selves for them. Thirdly, we must mourn and
repent of them, Iam. 4.9. Mat. 3.2. Fourthly, we must humble our selves before
God for them, James 4.10 Fifthly, we must resolve and endeavor to leave them,
Isa. 1.16. 1 Pet. 2.11. Sixthly, We must fight against them, and labor to
mortify them, 1 Timothy 6.12. Col. 3.5. Seventhly, we must pray to God to forgive
them, and give us power against them, for Jesus Christ his sake, Hos. 14.2.

sins, he has said, we shall not be judged, 1 Cor. 11.31. Thirdly, if we mourn,
we shall be comforted, Mat. 5.4. Isa. 61.3. Ezech. 9.4. If we repent, iniquity

God, he will save us, Job 22.29. He will uphold us, Pro. 29.23. He will give us
more grace, 1 Pet. 5.5. Iam. 4.6. Pro. 3.34. And he will dwell with us, Isa. 57

shall not be mentioned, and we shall save our souls alive, Ezech.
18.21,22.27,28. Sixthly, if we fight the good fight, we shall have a crown of
righteousness, 2 Timothy 4.7,8. Seventhly, if we humbly pray for pardon, and power

Q. How many sorts of faith be there?

A. Three: Historical faith, justifying faith, and faith of Assurance.

Q. What is historical faith?

in the Book of God to be true, 1 Cor. 12.3. Ioh. 3.33. Ioh. 5.46.

Q. What is justifying faith?

50.10. Job 13.15.

Q. Explain this by an Example?

A. God says, if we confess our sins, he will forgive, I have confessed my
sin to God (says the believer) and now I will rest upon God to forgive and
pardon.

Q. What is faith of assurance?

A. Faith of assurance is a grace of God, whereby I am fully persuaded, that
God in Christ will make good all his promises unto me, 1 Ioh. 5.10. Ephesians. 1.13. 2 Timothy 1.12. To. 8.38. To. 4.21.

Q. What will the Lord do for a true Believer?

A. He that has true faith shall not perish, but have everlasting life, Ioh.
3.16. Hab. 2.1. Ioh. 11.26. 1 Pet. 1.9.

Q. What else does the Lord require?

A. The Lord requires that we should obey all his commands, with all our whole
might, and that continually, Deuteronomy. 10.12. Deuteronomy. 11.13. 1 Cor. 6.30. Luke 1.6.
Ioh. 8.29. Psalm. 119.6.112. Mat. 28.20. Deuteronomy. 12.32.

Q. What if we come short in this?

A. If there be first a willing mind, God will accept according to that a man
has, 2 Cor. 8.12. To him that has shall be given: God will give more grace,
Mar. 4.24. Mat. 13.12.

Q. How shall we know true faith?

A. First, by cleaving unto God when he hides his face from us, Isa. 8.17. Job
13.15. Hab. 3.17,18. Romans 4.18.

Secondly, by readiness to yield obedience to the Law of faith, Iam.
2.17.18.26.

Thirdly, by purifying the heart, Act. 15.9. 1 Ioh. 3.3.

Fourthly, by love to God and his Saints, Gal. 5.6.

Q. Which be they?

A. I am the Lord, etc.

Q. Is there any other commands?

A. There be many other commands, whereby God forbids us some things, and
commands us to do other things, according to his own good pleasure, Mar. 28.20.

Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. An outward visible sign, and seal appointed by God to represent, and
confirm a spiritual Grace.

Q. How many Sacraments be there?

A. Two, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord.

Q. What is the outward sign in Baptism?

A. Water, wherewith, or wherein the party baptized is to be sprinkled or
dipped in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Mat. 28,19. Mar. 16.16.

Q. What is the inward grace signified, and sealed to us by Baptism?

A. First, by this we are made visible Members of the visible Church of Christ,
1 Cor. 12.13. Act. 2.41.

Secondly, To them that believe it signifies, and seals their real and firm
union to Jesus Christ, Romans 6.3. Gal. 3.27. Ephesians. 4.5.

Thirdly, It signifies, and seals the Spiritual washing of our souls from the
guilt of sin. Act. 2.38. Romans 4.11. and the imputation of Christ's
righteousness.

Fourthly, it signifies and seals the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of
the Holy Ghost, 1 Pet. 3.21. Tit. 3.5. Acts 13.24. Mat. 3.11. Mar. 1.8. Luke
3.16.

Q. Are all that are Baptized thus washed?

A. No: The grace of God is not tied always to the outward sign: Those that
are not elected have nothing sealed to them, Simon Magus had the outward Sign,
but was not washed with the inward grace, Act. 8.13.23.

Q. Who be so washed?

A. Those that believe and repent, Mar. 16.16. Acts 2.38.

Q. What shall we think of those that are baptized?

A. As all that believe are inwardly washed by the Spirit, so those that are
elected have right to be washed in time. But because we cannot infallibly judge
who be elected, and do believe, we cannot certainly know, who be washed in
Baptism by the Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.11.

Q. Who is then to be admitted to the Sacrament of Baptism?

A. Those are to be Baptized that profess their Faith, repentance and
obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and their children, Mat. 3.6. Act.
8.13.38. Act. 2.41.

Q. How do you prove that the Infants of Believers are to be Baptized?

A. First, because all Saints have right to Baptism, and children of believing
Parents are esteemed Saints, 2 Cor. 7.14.

Secondly, because children are capable of the inward grace, else they cannot
be saved, 3 Ioh. 3 36. Heb. 12.14.

Q. How prove you by the Word of God that they may have the inward Grace?

A. God promises to circumcise their heart, Deu. 30.6. Our Savior says, that
of such is the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat. 10 14. And Peter says, that the Promise
belongs to them, Act. 2.39.

Q. What Promise is that?

A. In the verse before, the promise made to those that are baptized, is the
remission of sins, and the gift of the holy Ghost, Act. 2.38.

Q. What is the third Reason, why children are to be baptized?

A. God appointed children to be circumcised, Genesis 17.12. And Baptism is a
seal of the same Covenant of Grace, Romans 4.11. Act. 2.38.17. Genesis 11.

Q. What is the fourth reason?

A. If children may not be baptized, the Law was more glorious, and full of
Grace then the Gospel; and the children of the Jews more happy before Christ,
then the children of Christians under Christ; but the Scripture teaches the
contrary, 2 Cor. 3.8 9.

Q. What is the fifth reason?

A. All were baptized in the Red Sea, 1 Cor. 10.2. And we read that whole
houses and families were baptized in the Apostles time, Act. 16.15.33. 1 Cor.
1.16.

Q. What do you gather from that?

A. Because no man can say, there were no children in those families, or that
the children were not baptized; therefore we conceive there was some children
baptized, and we ought not to deny Baptism to children.

Q What other reason have you?

A. Mat. 28.19 Christ commanded his Apostles to Baptize all Nations. As God had
formerly commanded to circumcise all Jews, and if children had not been to have
been baptized our Savior would have excepted them in that command.

Q. How many signs and significant actions are there in the Lords Supper, and
what do they signify,

A. There be six: First, the Materials, bread and wine, which signify the body
and blood of Christ, Mat. 26.26.28.

Secondly, the setting these signs apart for this holy use, which signify how
Christ was set apart from eternity for the work of our redemption, Rev. 13.8.
Ioh. 10.36.

Thirdly, the Blessing, the signs, which puts us in mind how Christ Jesus
blessed the bread and the wine, in the first institution for this holy
Sacrament; Mat. 26.26. 1 Cor. 11.24.

And how the Father blessed Christ in his doings, Offices, and sufferings to
finish the work of our Redemption, Mat, 1.20. Romans 3.29.

Fourthly, the breaking of the Bread, and pouring forth of the Wine, show how
his body was broken, his blood shed, and his soul made an offering for our
sins.

Fifthly, the giving of the bread and wine, is a token that God offers to the
faithful; receive Christ Jesus, and the benefit of all that he did and
suffered, of all his offices, merits and promises, of which gift these signs
are a pledge, 1 Cor. 10.16.

Lastly, as we take and eat the bread and drink the wine for the nourishment of
our bodies, so ought we to take, and eat the body and blood of Christ by Faith,
for the nourishment of our souls, Ioh. 53,54,55,56.63. 1 Cor. 10.17.8.

Q. What is it to take Christ by Faith in the Sacrament?

A. To rest upon God in Christ, to make good unto us, or give us the benefit of
the doings, sufferings, offices, merits, and promises of Christ, and to receive
this Sacrament as a pledge, sign and seal of the Lords engagement, and
intention to do the same, Isa. 26.3. Isa. 50.10.

Q. Do all receive Christ in this Sacrament?

A. No: Only such as come rightly prepared.

Q. How must we prepare our selves?

A. First, with knowledge of the doings, sufferings, offices, and merits, Laws,
promises and Sacraments of Christ, which is called discerning the Lords body, 1
Cor. 11.29.

Secondly, by due examination of our thoughts, words and actions according to
his Laws, and taking that course which has been taught to avoid the danger of
sin, 1 Cor. 11.28.

Thirdly, with true Faith: First, in God the Father, to commit our souls to him
in his son, in his promises, commands and Sacraments, as a saithfull Creator, 2
Pet. 4.19 Isa. 58.9 1 These. 24.26. Secondly, with Faith in Christ, rely upon
his doings, sufferings, offices, and merits, to blot our sins, and free us from
wrath, to make us righteous, and give us a Crown of glory, Heb. 8.12. 1 These.
1.10. Romans 3.20,21. 1 Cor. 1.30. Phil. 3.9. Ioh. 17.22. Tim. 2.48.

Q. What is the act of Faith, required in the offices of Christ.

A. First, we must rest upon him as our King, Isa. 62.11. Zach. 9.9. Mat. 2.5.
Mat. 25.34.

To rule us by the Law of righteousness, Heb. 1.8.

To confirm the charter of the promises, 2 Cor. 1.20. Heb. 9.15. Romans 15.8.

To subdue all our enemies, 1 Cor. 15.25.26.

To protect us in all our adversities, 1 Cor. 15.57. 1 Pet. 1.5. 1 Cor. 10.13.
Heb. 13.5 6. Isa. 46.4.

Secondly, we must rest upon him as a Priest, Hebrews 6.20. To have offered a
sufficient Sacrifice to satisfy for our sins, 1 Ioh. 2.2. To be our Advocate,
1 Ioh. 2.1. And to plead for the Pardon of those sins we confess, judge, and
humble our selves for, by mouring, repentance, and turning from them. And to
intercede for us, Heb. 7.25. Romans 8.34. Rev. 8.3. And offer up our prayers to
his father: Lastly, we must rest upon him as a Prophet, Deuteronomy. 18.18. Act. 3.22.
Not only to it struct us by his Word, and Ministers, Act. 26.18.4. Ephesians. 11. But
also by the unutrerable working of his Spirit in heavenly motions, Ioh. 16.13.
Isa. 44.3 Joh. 5.20. Act. 3.26. Ephesians. 1.17,18.

And by giving us new understandings, wills rectified, affections to receive
those motions; And to create in our souls the image of his heavenly graces,
Ioh. 1.16. Romans 8.29. Luke 24.45

Q. What else is desire to come prepared?

A. To come with reverence to that glorious Majestly there present, of that
holy Ordinance there celebrated and that invaluable grace there offered, Psa.
89.7. Mat. 21.37. Lev. 19.30. Lev. 26.2. Heb. 12.28.

Q. What else is required to come prepared?

A. If in this Sacrament God scale the Pardon of our sins, deliverance from
wrath, and the firm union of his love: It is fitting we should forgive others,
lay down thoughts of wrath and revenge, and come together with bowels of
compassion and love.

Q. How prove you that?

A. God requires these things at all times; how much more will he require, we
should come clothed with these graces to his table, Mat. 6.14,15. 2 Cor.
2.7,8. Ia. 2.8. Romans 12.9,10. 14.18 20. Romans 13 8. Coll. 3.12. 1 Ioh. 3.23.

Q. What is the danger for a man to come unprepared?

A. He may eat and drink unworthily, and so eat and drink his own damnation, 1
Cor. 11.29. After unprepared Judas eat the sop, Satan entered into him, Ioh.
13.27. He that came to the Lords Table wanting a Wedding Garment, was bound
hand and foot, and cast into utter darkness, Mat. 22.12.

FINIS.
