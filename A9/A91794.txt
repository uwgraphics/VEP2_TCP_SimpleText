The necessity of TOLERATION In matters of RELIGION, OR, Certain QUESTIONS
propounded to the Synod, tending to prove that Corporal punishments ought not
to be inflicted upon such as hold Errors in Religion, and that in matters of
Religion, men ought not to be compelled, but have liberty and freedom.

Here is also the copy of the Edict of the Emperors Constantinus and Licinius,
and containing the Reasons that enforced them to grant unto all men liberty to
choose, and follow what Religion they thought best.

Also here is the faith of the Assembly of Divines, as it was taken out of the
exactest Copy of their practice, with the non-conformists answer why they
cannot receive and submit to the said faith.

For such are false Apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into
the Apostles of Christ, and no marv^l, for Satan himself is transformed into an
angel of light: therefore ^t is no great thing if his Ministers also be
transformed as the Ministers of Righteousness, whose end shall be according to
their works.

A Copy of the IMPERIAL CONSTITUTION OF Constantinus and Licinius, Containing
the Reasons that moved them to grant unto all their Subjects free Liberty in
matters of Religion, which is worthy the view, and consideration of all men,
especially those in Authority.
NOt long ago we weighed with our selves, that the Liberty and Freedom of
Religion ought not in any cause to be prohibited; Eusebius. lib. 10. cap. 5.
but that free leave ought to be given to every man, to do therein, according
to his will and mind. We have given Commandment to all men to qualify matters
of Religion, as they themselves thought good, and that also the Christians
should keep the opinions and Faith of their Religion; but because that many,
and sundry opinions by the same, Our first License, spring, and increase
through such liberty granted, we thought good manifestly to add thereunto, and
make plain such things, whereby perchance some of them in time to come, may
from such their observance be let, or hindered; when therefore by prosperous
success, I Constantinus Augustus, and Licinius Augustus came to Mediolanum,
and there sat in Counsel upon such things as served for the utility and
profit of the Commonweal; these things amongst others we thought would be
beneficial to all men, yea, and before all other things we purposed to
establish those things wherein the true Reverence and worship of God is
comprehended, that is, to give unto Christians free choice to follow what
Religion they think good, and whereby the same sincerity and Celestial grace
which is in every place received may also be embraced and accepted of all our
loving Subjects: According therefore unto this our pleasure upon good
advisement, and sound judgment,
We have decreed, that no man so hardly be denied to choose, and follow the
Christian mind, to what Religion he thinks meet himself, whereby God may
perform upon us, all his accustomed care and goodness; to the intent therefore,
you might know that this is our pleasure. We thought it necessary to write this
unto you, whereby all such errors and opinions being removed, which in our
former Letters (being sent unto you in the behalf of the Christians) are
contained, and which seem very indiscreet, and contrary to our clemency, may be
made frustrate and annihilate.
Now therefore firmly, and freely, we will and command, that every man have a
free Liberty to observe the Christian Religion, and that without any grief, or
molestation, he may be suffered to do the same: These things have we thought
good to signify unto you by as plain words as we may, that we have given to
the Christians free and absolute power to keep and use their Religion, and for
so much as this Liberty is absolutely given of us unto them to use and exercise
their former observance, if any be disposed, it is manifest that the same
helps much to establish the public tranquillity of our lives; every man to
have license, and liberty to use, and choose what kind of worshipping he list
himself; and this is done of us only for the intent that we should have no man
to be enforced to one Religion more then another: And this thing also amongst
others we have provided for the Christians, that they may have again the
possession of such places, in which heretofore they have been accustomed to
make their Assemblies: So that if any have bought or purchased the same, either
of us, or of any other, the same places, without either money or other
recompense, forthwith, and without delay, We will to be rerestored again to the
said Christians: and if any man have obtained the same by gift from us and
shall require any recompense to be made to them in that behalf, then let the
Christians repair to the President (being the Judge appointed for that place)
that consideration may be had of those men by our benignity, all which things
we will and command that you see to be given, and restored freely, and with
diligence unto the society of the Christians, all delay set apart, and because
the Christians themselves are understood to have had not only those places
wherein they were accustomed to resort together, but certain other peculiar
places also, not being private to any one man, but belonging to the right of
their Congregation and society; you shall see also all those to be restored to
the Christians, that is to say, to every fellowship and company of them,
according to the decree, whereof we have made mention, all delay set apart:
provided, that the order we have taken in the mean time be observed, that if
any (taking no recompense) shall restore the same lands and possessions, they
shall not mistrust but be sure to be saved harmless by us; in all these things,
it shall be your part to imply your diligence in the behalf of the aforesaid
company of the Christians, whereby this our Commandment may speedily be
accomplished, and also in this cause by our clemency,
the Common and public peace may be preserved; for undoubtedly by this means,
as before we have said, the good will and favor of God toward us (where of in
many causes we have had good experience) shall always continue with us: And to
the intent, that this our Constitution may be notified to all men; it shall be
requisite, that the Copy of these our Letters be set up in all places that men
may read and know the same, least any should be ignorant thereof.

So also Maximinus the Emperor after he had persecuted the Christians, sent
forth his Edict to the contrary, That all men should have liberty to use what
Religion they like best, seeing that before that time upon that occasion, that
Dioclesianus and Maximinianus our Progenitors, commanded the Assemblies and
meetings of Christians to be cut off, so that there were many of them spoiled
and robbed; Eusebius. ilb. 9. cap. 10. Fix. Act Mo^ib. 1 page 113.
least our Subjects should be spoiled of their goods and sustance, which thing
chiffly to prevent, is our only endeavor, etc. which thing was very well
taken, and highly allowed of the Romans, and wisemen.

By reason of these Edicts, great tranquillity followed, and long continued
persecution ceased: so as Fox declares, that the Church continued without any
open slaughter for a thousand years together, till Anno 1300. and the burning
of John Huss, and Jeremy of Prague for Heretics by the Counsel of Constance,
caused the Bohemians to raise an Army against the Authors of their death: and
God was so with the Bohemian Army under Zisca, that they always Conquered, so
that God has caused much evil to come upon them, who have compelled men in
matters of Religion.

That Religion ought to be free;
1. Because it is Gods way, to have Religion free, and only to flow from an
inward principle of Faith and love; neither would God be worshipped of
unwilling Worshippers, Ioh. 4. 4.

2. It is Gods Prerogative only to force to Religion by working Faith in men's
hearts, for though Religion be natural, yet true Religion is supernatural, and
proceeds from the Spirit of God.

3. Because, the end why God has a Church, is, that he might have a people
separated from others in the world, to glorify him in a holy conversation, to
the convincing of those that are out of the Church; therefore there must be a
world, before whom the Church must walk, to whom such as walk disorderly, are
to be cast by Excommunication, and the Church is to wait for their Repentance.

4. Because, if there should be an established Law for all persons to submit
unto, it would tend to the wounding of the souls, and undoing the bodies of
very many, that could not submit to any one way, because their judgments so
much differ: also if there should be any defect in the established Law, as it
is possible to be (as we know by woeful experience) the godly shall suffer
oppression for conscience of the truth against that defect by the execution of
that Law, which I suppose would be a grief to honest hearts, seeing we find,
that when Laws are made concerning Religion, such as make conscience are
catched, as Daniel, and the three children were.

5. Because it is the best for the public peace to give every one content, for
if there be set up an Order in Religion for a Law, and thereby please one sort
of people, another sort will be displeased, who, it may be, have as many good
reasons for that they would have, as the others; and such as like not a
Toleration, it is to be feared, they are not rightly principled themselves, and
so are not competent Judges.

And as for those who think otherways, I desire they would seriously consider,
and answer these questions by the Scriptures.

Questions propounded to the Synod, and all honest hearted, and conscientious
people, whether Corporal punishments ought to be inflicted upon such as hold
Errors in Religion.
QUEST. 1.

WHether corporal punishment can open blind eyes, and give light to dark
understandings?

2. Whether carnal punishments can produce any more then a carnal repentance
and obedience?

3. Whether the destroying of men's bodies for errors, be not a means to prevent
their conversion; seeing some are not called until the eleventh hour: and if
they should be cut off for their errors the seventh, how should they come in?
Mat. 20. 6.

4. Whether those who would force other men's consciences, be willing to have
their own forced?

5. Whether it be wisdom and safe to make such sole Judges in matters of
Religion, who are not infallible, but as liable to err as others?

6. If a Father, or Magistrate have not power to force a virgin to marry one
she cannot love; whether they have power to force one where they cannot
believe, against the light and checks of their own consciences?

7. Whether the Scripture makes the Magistrate judge of our faith.

8. If the Magistrate may determine what is truth; whether we must not believe,
and live by the Magistrates faith, and change our Religion at their pleasures?
And if nothing must be preached, nor printed, nor allowed to pass, unless
certain men please to approve, and give their allowance thereto, under their
honds; whether such do not by this practice, tell God, that unless he will
reveal his truth first to them, they will not suffer it to be published, and
so not to be known, and whether the Licencer setting his hand to the book to
license it, (he being a Priest by his ordination and from the Pope) be not the
mark of the Beast, spoken of Revel. 13. 17? And whether it be not worse then
any of our former Patents before the Parliament: is not this a Spiritual
wickedness in high places which strikes at the truth: are they fit to be
Licencers of the truth, who when the truth has been tendered to be licensed,
they have confessed the truth of it, as they have been free to license it; but
refused, because they durst not? And whether it can be made appear, that Gone
has revealed his truth first to these Ministers of England, and so the first
spreaders of it? Instance who opposed the Prelates, the Ministers, or the
people; first? And so of the rest.

9. Whether it be not the command of Christ, that the tares (those that walk in
lies) and the wheat (those that walk in the truth) should be let alone; and
the blind (led in a false Religion) which are offended at the declaring of the
truth, should be let alone? Mat. 13. 30. 38. Mat. 15. 15.

10. Whether he was not reproved, that would have fire from heaven to devour
those that reject Christ, Luke 9. 54. 55.

11. Whether the servants of the Lord are not forbidden to strive, but to be
gentle toward all? 2 Timothy 4. 2.

12 Whether the Saints weapons against errors, be carnal or no? 2 Cor. 10. 4.

13 Whether it was not Christ's command, that his Disciples when they were
persecuted, they should pray; and if cursed, bless?

14. Whether the Scriptures declare, that the Saint should persecute others,
and whether the gentle lambs of Christ will or can serve the Wolves so, seeing
he sent his as sheep among wolves, and not as wolves among sheep, to kill and
imprison, Matthew. 10. 16.

15. Whether Christ has said, He will have an unwilling people compelled to
serve him?

16. Whether ever God did plant his Church by violence and bloodshed?

17. Whether tares may not become wheat, and the blind see, and those that now
oppose and resist Christ, afterward receive him: and he that is now in the
Devils snare, may get out, and come to repentance: and such as are idolaters,
as the Corinthians were, may become true worshippers, as they that are
strangers may become Gods people?

18. Whether to convert an heretic, and to cast out unclean spirits, be done
any other way then by the finger of God, by the mighty power of the Spirit in
the word?

19. Whether he that is not conformable to Christ, may not at the same time be
a good subject to the State, and as profitable to it?

20. Whether men that differ in Religion, may not be tolerated, seeing Abraham
abode among the Canaanites along time; yet contrary to them in religion, Genes.
13. 7. and 16. 13. and he sojourned in Gezer, and King Abimelech gave him leave
to abide in his land, Genesis 20. 21, 23, 24. And Isaac dwelt in the same land,
yet contrary in Religion Genesis 31. The people of Israel were about 430. years in
Egypt, and afterward in Babylon, all which time they differed in Religion from
the State, Exodus 12. 2 Chronicles. 36. Christ and his Disciples differed from the
common Religion of the State, Acts 19. 20. and when the enemies of the truth
raised up any tumults, the wisdom of the Magistrate most wisely appeased them,
Acts 18. 14, and 19. 15.

21. Whether it be not better for us, that a patent were granted to monopolize
all the corn and cloth, and to have it measured out unto us at their price and
pleasure, (which yet were intolerable) as for some men to appoint and measure
out unto us what and how much we shall believe and practice in matters of
Religion.

22. Whether there be not the same reason that they should be appointed by us
what they shall believe and practice in Religion, as for them to do so to us,
seeing we can give as good grounds for what what we believe and practice (as
they can do for what they would have) if not better.

23. Whether men heretofore have not in zeal for Religion, persecuted the Son
of God, in stead of the son of perdition?

24. Whether it is not a burden great enough for the Magistrate to govern and
judge in civil causes, to preserve the subjects rights, peace and safety?

25. If the Magistrate must judge and punish in matters of Religion, the
Magistrate must evet be troubled with such persons and such causes: and if
after his conscience be convinced, he had no such power, or see that it was
truth he punished; what horrors of conscience is he like to possess?

26. Whether he is fit to appoint punishments, that is not fit to judge?

27. If the Magistrate must punish errors in Religion, whether it does not
impose a necessity that the Magistrate is to have a certainty of knowledge in
all intricate cases? and whether God calls such to that place, whom he has not
furnished with abilities for that place? And if a Magistrate be in darkness,
and spiritually blind, and dead; be fit to judge of light, of truth and error?
and whether such be fit for the place of the Magistracy? then whether it be not
a scruple to a tender conscience to submit to such in civil causes because not
appointed to that place by God? whereas if the Magistrates power be only
civil, the doubt is resolved, because such as may be fit for Magistrates, and
men ought in conscience in civil things to submit unto them, so fit as their
commands are good. Romans 13.

28. Whether there be any Scripture that says, that any man's Conscience is to
be constrained, and whether the Magistrate can reach men's consciences; and
whether he be fit to make a law to conscience, who cannot know when conscience
keeps it, and that cannot reward conscience for keeping it, nor punish the
conscience for the breaking of it?

29. Whether it be not in vain for us to have Bibles in English, if contrary
to our understanding of them, we must believe as the Church believes, whether
it be right or wrong?

30. Whether the Magistrate be not wronged, to give him the Title of Civil
Magistrate only, if his power be spiritual?

31. Whether laws made merely concerning spiritual things, be not spiritual
also?

32. Whether if no civil Law be broken, the civil peace be hurt or no?

33. Whether in compulsion for conscience, not only the guilty, but the
innocent suffer also? As if the husband be an Heritick, his sufferings may
cause the innocent wife and children shall suffer also?

34. Whether such as are spiritually dead, be capable to be spiritually
infected?

35. Whether God will accept of a painted Sepulcher, a shadow, a mere
complement of obedience, when the heart is dead and rotten, and hates God, and
all that is good? God has no need of hypocrites; much less of forced ones:
God will have those to worship him as can worship him in spirit and truth, John
4.

36. Whether the Scriptures appoint any other punishment to be inflicted upon
Heriticks, then rejection and excommunication? Tit. 3. 10.

37. Whether freedom of conscience would not join all sorts of persons to the
Magistrate, because each shared in the benefit?

38. Whether those States (as the Low Countries,) who grant such liberty, do
not live quietly, and flourish in great prosperity?

39. Whether persecution for conscience do not harden men in their way, and
make them cry out of oppression and tyranny.

40. Whether some Corporal punishments would not make thousands in England
face about to Popery, as it did in Queen Mary's time?

41. Whether laws made concerning Religion, have not always catched the most
holy men; witness Daniel and the three Children: the rest will be of what
Religion you will.

42. Whether the Saints crave the help of the powers of this world to bring
Christ to them, or fear their powers to keep him from them?

43. If no Religion is to be practiced, but that which the Commonwealth shall
approve on: what if they will approve of no Religion? shall men have no
Religion at all?

44. Whether the Saints ought not to continue their Assemblies of their worship
of God, without, or against the consent of the Magistrates; they being
commanded to do so, Mal. 28. 18, 19, 20. Heb. 10. 25. By an Angel from God,
Acts 5. 20. It was the Apostles practice (who were not rebellious nor
seditious) Acts 4. 18, 19, 20, 23. and 5. 22. 28.

45. Whether Uniformity in Religion in the State, do not oppress millions of
souls, and impoverish the Saints bodies.

46. Whether Gods people have not disputed and taught a Religion new and
worship, contrary to the State they lived in, and spread it in traveling and
open places; as appears Act. 17. 2. 17. and 18. 48. yet no origancy and
impetuousnesse. Yea, contrary to public authority in the Nations Uniformity,
in false worship, Dan. 3. the three Children; so the Apostle, Act. 4. 5. The
Saints have openly witnessed, that in matters spiritual, Jesus was King. Act.
17. 7. and for this Christ suffered; as appears by his accusation. John 9. 19.
Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews, Psalm. 2. 6. Act. 2. 36. Gods people have
seemed the disturbers of the civil State, upon the Apostles preaching, there
followed uprores, and Tumults, and uprores, at Iconium, at Ephesus, at
Jerusalem, Act. 14. 4. 19. 29. 40. Act. 21. 30, 31.

47. Whether Jesus Christ, appointed any material Prisons for Blasphemers of
him? Whether notwithstanding the confidence of the truth they have, to which
they would force others, whether the Bishops, their Fathers, have not been as
deeply mistaken; for now they see and say they are Antichristian.

48. Whether it be not a natural Law for every man that lives, to worship
that which he thinks is God, and as he thinks he ought to worship; and to
force otherwise, will be concluded an oppression of those persons so forced.

49. And whether it be best for us to put out our eyes, and see by the eyes of
others who are as dim-sighted?

In my judgment, your judgment is a lie: will ye compel me to believe a lie?
compel ye a man to be present at a worship which he loathes? or will ye force
my tongue to speak that which my hears cannot affect.

50. Whether it be in the power of any man to believe what he will, and as he
will, the mind of man being persuaded with great reasons is captivated, will
he nill he: I am fully persuaded of the truth of the Religion I profes, if I
should follow your Religion, I should deceive men, (and go contrary to my
conscience) but I cannot deceive God.

51. Whether the Ordinance against preaching is not the only way to ensnare
the choysest men, but it cannot catch the worst, who shall judge what is error,
and what is truth, I answer, if our enemies must judge, we must always be
persecuted and abused by the worst of men for they will judge it fit to
persecute us, they will call fruth error, and error truth, and sometimes truth
shall be esteemed no less then blasphemy, and that which one man shall do as
his duty, in conscience to Gods Command, may be called obstinacy, though
unjustly, so that if any demand who is the most orthodox and sound man, and
freest from errors, the answer is now, if you will put it to the vote, its the
major voice, the strongest side, that side that has the authority to back it,
so that we must follow a multitude. Once a King being sick, it was demanded of
him who should succeed him in the Crown, he answered, he that had the longest
Sword, so it is now, and if truth has but a few followers; it must be esteemed
error and rejected.

52. If the Magistrate, as a Magistrate, have a power from Christ, to punish
such as he is persuaded in his conscience are erroneous and heretical, or
because he differs in Religion from the Magistrate, then Queen Mary and her
Parliament did well, in burying the Martyrs for differing from her established
Religion, they being as contrary to her Religion as any are now in the
Magistrates eyes.

53. Either the Civil, or the spiritual State must be supreme: which of these
must judge the other in spiritual matters? if the Magistrate, then he is above
the Church, and so the head of the Church; and he has his power from the
People: (to govern the Church) whether it will not follow, that the People, as
a People have originally as men a power to govern the Church, to see her do
her duty, to reform and correct her, and so the Spouse of Christ, the wife of
Christ must be corrected according to the pleasure of the world, who lie in
wickedness? 1 John 5.

54. Whether every man does not venture his Soul upon the truth of his
Religion, which in his conscience he is persuaded of the truth of it.

55. Whether this Kingdom have any sufficient ground to believe they shall
enjoy their outward rights, and liberties so long as any one Religion is set
up, and men forced under great penalties to be subject to it?

56. Whether it be not a horrible thing that a free division of England, may
not have so much liberty as is permitted to a Turk in this Kingdom who although
he denies Christ, yet he can live quietly amongst us here, and is it not a
great ingratitude of this Kingdom to deny this liberty to such as are friends
and have been a means in their persons and estates to save this Kingdom from
destruction and desolation. Oh England, England! Oh that thou were wise to know
the things that belongs to thy prosperity and peace, before it be too late, the
hand of God is against the, how have we slain one another, and who knows but
this is come upon us, for troubling, undoing, dispising, and banishing the
people of God into so many Wildernesses?

57. Whether men are bound in Conscience to be persecuted when they can help
it, for omitting of that they judge sinful, and whether a man may not take
that which is his right, or use means to take it by force, in case they who
should give it deny it, and he cannot have it otherwise, thus I would keep my
Estate, my liberty, my life by force, if I (can and) cannot keep it otherwise?

58. Whether there be any man that judges his own judgment erroneous?

59. Whether if any man will take upon him to punish men for errors, it be not
fit he show his authority from God, to warrant his practice, and if one man is
to be punished for error, must it not of necessity follow, that all men are to
be punished because all men have errors, no man is free from them, and
therefore all men are to be punished with corporal punishments, for their
errors either more or less, so that if Luther and Calvin, and other good men
were now amongst us, they should be punished for the errors they held, as well
as others are for the truth?

60. Whether the Priests of England in assuming to themselves to be Christ's
Ministers, and the Apostles successors, and a godly reformed Presbytery be not
a cunning trick, and a mere chea^e to deceive the simple?

61. Whether the Priests practice be not contrary to the Apostles practice,
take one instance, the Apostles diped viz. baptized persons after they believed
and confessed their faith: whereas they sprinkled persons before they believe,
yea before they can speak they baptized persons in a River, Asts 2. and 8. Mat.
3. these sprinkle water upon their faces, yet if you will believe them, they
are the successors of the Apostles, and follow their step?

62. Wherefore do the Priests of England assume to themselves the title of
(Divine) is it because they are exercised in Divine truths, or because they
partake of the Divine nature, or both, if so, then many Tradesmen may as well
have the title of Divine given them as well as they, because they partake of
the Divine nature, and are as much exercised in matters Divine, as the most of
them, but it is a question, whether the title Divine is to be given to any man,
but only to God; whose being is only Divine?

63. Whether the name of settling Religion be not a fine pretense to establish
error and tyranny, we desire not liberty of conscience of any man, let us enjoy
our right, our liberty of persons and Estates, and we will give them leave to
hang our Religion and consciences too if they can, they desire not our
Religion, nor can they see nor reach our conscience, as Ques. 28. and I am
persuaded that the hand of God and man, will be against England and Scotland,
till they cease troubling of men for matters of Religion?

64. Whether ever any that are contrary to the Synod, did ever sue the
Parliament to have the Presbyters punished for any of their errors, though in
them they abound, and whether some of them do not tend to the destruction of
the State, if they might have their wills.

65. Whether it be not a great error, to slight and disgrace the holy
Scriptures and whether the Synod are not guilty of this error, in that they do
not make the Scriptures the ground and rule of what they do, and this appears,
1. in that what they affirm in not in the Scrirtures. 2. in that they keep
not the form of sound words, as the Scriptures require, we cannot read it in
the Scripture, what they impose upon others, nor can we find the substance of
that they impose upon others in the whole Scriptures. 3. neither do they
allege the words nor texts of Scripture to prove what they maintain, as
appears by their Directory: what is their authority above the Scriptures, if
they think so, it is no small error?

66. Whether it does not appear that the Priesthood for the most part, do hate
and despise the suffering Saints of Christ, and this appears, 1. because they
speak not for them, but 2. speak against them, 3. they preach against them. 4.
they persecute them, and cause others to persecute them, 5. when they are in
prison, they do not vifit them, 6. nor allow them any means (when they are in
want) to maintain them?

67. Whether it does appear, that the Priests oppose errors, and Sects out of
conscience, or out of bye and self ends, it appears to be the later, because
they write and preach, and bend their strength against those truths, that
oppose their profit, honor, ease, as tithes, false ministry, and cousoning of
people, but as for errors, indeed as to deny the Resurrection of the body, the
truth of the Scriptures, to deny Christ to be God, and the like, which of them
has written on sheet against any of these errors, notwithstanding they have
wrote volume against good men, for doing that Christ commanded them?

68. Whether those Priests are not false Priests, in prophesying in their
Pulpits, that London should be plundered, and their wives, etc. ravished when
Sir Thomas his Army came into London; you see apparently they prophecy the
vision of their own hearts, so they say, thus says the Lord when he has nor
spoken unto them?

Whether the Priests were not the cause of the burning of the book, entitled
the Bloody Tenant, because it was against persecution, and whether their
consciences would not have dispensed with the burning of the author of it,
which I wish they would seriously consider Dells Book of Right Reformation?

70. Whether men's eyes are not so opened, and the Priests deeds, so manifest
that it is but in vain for them to think that ever all men will be led by them
more?
