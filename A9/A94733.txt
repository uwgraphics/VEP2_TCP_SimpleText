HAving perused this mild Apology, I conceive that the ingenuity, learning and
piety therein contained deserve the Press.

GAL. 4. 16. Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?

LONDON, Printed for Giles Calvert, at the Black Spread-Eagle at the West end
of PAUL'S. 1646.

To the right worshipful my much honored Auditors, members of the Honorable,
House of COMMONS, and Societies of the Temple.
AFter other means duly but without success tried, for the public good, to
wit the vindicating of truth, and consequently for the preventing of the
establishment of an error and corruption of the most solemn sacred rite of the
Christian profession, and the oppression of them that oppose it, I consented to
the publishing of two treatises in December last about Infant Baptism. It
seemed good to sundry persons of note presently to cry down my assertions, and
to load me with unjust accusations, which I take to be rather a baffeling of
the Author, then an answering of his writing. Yet the truth has gotten so much
ground (however some eminent men pretend otherwise) that the Doctrine of the
Directory is disavowed by two of the most eminent of my Antagonists, as is
showed 9. page 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. of this Apology, the chief argument of my
prime Antagonist, is proved to be either nugatory or fallacious,. 10. page 44.
45 46. 47. 48. of this Apology, sundry confessions are drawn from my
Antagonists, which in my judgment, and I think in the judgment of any that
knows what belongs to disputes, do yield the cause, as those that I mention.
18. page 97. 98. 100. 101. 102. and. 5. page 28. of this Apology. And as for the
accusations against my self, I should slight them, were it not they had a
great influence upon the cause, and therefore have been necessitated to
vindicate my self; and therewith the truth in some measure by this Apology.
The great prejudice against me in Point of antiquity, I have also in this
Apology endeavored to dispell, specially that from the testimony of Augustine,
Sermon. 10. de verbis Apostoli, tom. 10. which upon examination I find not to be
an historical narration from good records, but a mere hyperbolicall speech,
Rhetorically asserting a thing by conjecture from present use in a Sermon to
the people,. 15. page 81. 82. 83. 84. of this Apology. And for the testimony of
Tertullian concerning federall holiness, it is showed to be impertinent,. 15.
page 84. 85. That the present Synod or reformed Churches are against me should
be no more prejudice against me, then it is against the Synod, and reformed
Churches that they oppose the Doctrine of Infant Baptism, as it was taught by
Cyprian, and his council of 66. Bishops, Augustine, and many Synods, and
Churches all along till the fifteenth century, and the Augustan confession art
9.

The danger of troubles upon a reformation of this corruption should make men
wary how they introduce them; I think they that are bound by Covenant to
reform, yet are not bound to do it with procipitation, and without prudence.
But however men must take heed how they establish an error and corruption by a
Law, and oppress men for holding a truth, lest they kick against the Prick.

As for my own particular, the hard dealing I have fo^nd does not alienate me
from my brethren, nor I hope shall make a schism between us; if it must happen,
my endeavor is, that it may be necessary, not voluntary on my part. What has
happened I look upon it, however meant by men, yet as ordered by God for good,
to wit the clearing of the truth, the trying and humbling of my self. That I
suffer in the repute of men, or my outward peace moves me not. It Is not to be
expected children should be born without travail, nor truth without suffering;
yet to leave so intelligent an Auditory, with so much advantage of the fruit
of my labors, is no small grievance. However I have chosen you for
depositaries, in whose hands I may leave this Apology; that you may not be
strangers to this business, nor forget him who is

An Apology for the two Treatises, and Appendix to them concerning
Infant Baptism, against the unjust Charges, Complaints and Censures of D.
Nathanael Homes, M. John Geree, and M. Steven Marshall, and M. John Ley.
DEcember 15, 164^. were published with my consent two Treatises,.
and an Appendix to them concerning Infant Baptism. 1. Of the occasion of
writing this Apology.
The writing that could not in nineteen months before obtain a few lines,
has now gained four answers in four months. In January came forth: Treatise
of one Thomas Bakewell, in which the Title pretends a brief answer to my
twelve doubtful Arguments (as he styles them) against Infant Baptism in my
Exercitation about it. This Treatise I think has honor enough done it that it
is named. If any man show me any thing worth the answering in it, it may in
time gain a reply, otherwise for me it may take it is rest. The next month was
published Doctor Homes his Vindication of baptizing Believers Infants in some
animadversions on my Exercitation and examen. The next month I received from
Master John Geree his vindic^ae paedobaptisms in a full answer (as is asserted)
to my twelve Arguments in my exercitation, and whatsoever is rational or
material in my Answer to Master Marshals Sermon. The next month I received
Master Stephen Marshall his defense of Infant Baptism in answer to my two
Treatises and Appendix, in which also I am informed of two pieces at least from
New England in which I am concerned. And unto all, or some of these, Master
John Ley in his Epistle to Master John Sal^marsh adds his acclamation in these
words. There be divers^ David's who are ready for a single encounter with that
braving Goliath, and some have given his Cause such a wound already, as (though
he may play the Montebanke with it and skin it over) will never be cured at the
bottom. Thus far they have spoken: I presume they will allow me now liberty
to speak for my self, and for the truth.

My Cause (as Master Ley calls it) contains either the manner, or the matter of
my Treatises..
The defense of the matter of them is the chiefest thing, 2. Of the intention
of the Author upon that occasion.
and is first in my intention. But the clearing of my self from some
complaints or charges in the manner of handling the whole business, is so
necessary for the removing of prejudices, which would prevent reading and
entertaining my writings, and do undermine my present station, that I am
constrained, first to plead for my self, before I engage further in the
Controversy: wherefore I shall answer those charges by themselves apart that
so the main question may be discussed by it self.

First, Doctor Homes in his Epistle to the Reader has these words.. 3. Of the
necessity and seasonablenes of publishing the two Treatises about
Infant Baptism.
Mean while I could not but lament the untimely birth of Master T. his
Exercitation, and his unnecessary falling intravell with it, after at least
six able Brethren, and above so many days by nervous disputation had given
him so much Cause to doubt of his Ten^t, or at least a while to suspend it. And
this has been by sundry persons objected to me, that the publishing my Book
was extremely unseasonable. Two reasons are employed in Doctor Homes his words
to insinuate that it was untimely, because it was unnecessary. Secondly,
because it was after such a nervous disputation as he mentions.

To that of needlesnesse I answer. If it were necessary to maintain Truth
though generally opposed, when few or none were willing to appear for it, and
special providence called me out to do it, if it were necessary to endeavor
the preventing of unjust persecution for holding a Truth, to which in Sermons
and other ways Lawmakers, and Magistrates were every where instigated, if it
were necessary when the people of God were perplexed about a point of
conscience that pertaines to their continual practice, and disputation in
public was declined, to endeavor the bringing of Truth to light, if it were
necessary for a man to keep the solemn Covenant he has by oath bound himself
to, though it were to his great hazard, if it were necessary in a time of
Reformation for a Minister of the Gospel to do what belonged to him to further
it, if it be necessary for a Minister of the Gospel to provide for the giving
of his account at the day of Jesus Christ, then it was necessary for me to fall
in travel with my Exercitation and examen; for all these ends and ties
concurred in the writing and publishing of my Treatises. And therefore I am
assured that what I did was so necessary, that had I not done what I did, I
should neither have been faithful to Christ, nor to his people, nor to the
State, nor to my own soul. I confess my Book was untimely published in
reference to my own preferment, and outward peace. I saw few or none regarded
for clearing of Truth: but popular Orators, such as relate to great men, or are
useful to uphold a Party, are the men esteemed. I could not expect any other
then opposition to my opinion, being against such a stream of men. But I feared
that of our Lord Christ, He that is ashamed of me and my words in this
adulterous and sinful Generation, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when
he shall come in his glory with his holy Angels. How nervous the disputation he
mentions was, I suppose the Doctor knows not but by report, forasmuch as I
never perceived him present at it. The strength, and substance of all the
Arguments, as well as my memory (who was then the respondent) could bear them
away, was faithfully digested by me in my Exercitation, which was composed not
long after in part upon occasion of that disputation. In which disputation I
was so far from finding cause to doubt of my Tenet, that I profess sincerely
both that disputation, and the several Answers of my learned Antagonists, and
reverend brethren Doctor Homes, and Master Geree, and Master Marshall have
given me less cause to doubt of my Tenet, especially since Master Marshall Page
116. of his Defense says, it was never asserted by him, That the C^venant of
saving Grace is made to Believers and their natural seed, and Page 92. The
command is the cause of the existence of the duty, but the Covenant of Grace is
the motive to it, and Page 182. he grants, that the formal reason (which is
the adequate reason) of the Jews being Circumcised was the command of God, the
Covenant of Grace, or their Churchstate he only makes the motive to it, and the
thing it related to: which with many more concessions in his Defense, and the
others Answers I doubt not, but if the Lord vouchi^ase me time and liberty to
improve to the overthrow of his first and maine Argument, and the inference he
makes from the Texts of Scripture he brings to confirm it, and consequently
his whole Cause, as he himself confesses in his Sermon. Page 26. And for
giving me cause to suspend my (...); if he mean by suspension, stifling my
doubts in mine own bosom, and never imparting them to learned men for
resolution, it had been in my apprehension extreme imprudence, if not
stupidity, to have let slip the opportunity of making known the reasons of my
doubts in this juncture of time, in which by Covenant the State was engaged to
settle worship, Catechizing, confession of faith, discipline according to Gods
Word, to each of which this point is of no small moment: if he mean by
suspending my Tenet the not printing my writings, neither am I justly to be
blamed therein considering how long I waited and yet never received any
resolution, and after I say not, a month only, but ten months at least
waiting for an answer about my motion to Master Marshall in the Epilogue of my
Examen, it was plainly rejected. And though Master Marshall excuses himself
by relating that I declared to him, that I could, and that I intimated to him I
would keep the opinion private to my self (in which either his memory or his
apprehension were defective) and therefore took no further thought of examining
my Treatises, yet I suppose it concerned Master Marshall for many reasons to
have contrived some course for my satisfaction, or the abatement of height of
pride, and confidence which the perturbation of his mind, rather then the true
intelligence of my spirit in that business made him imagine in my writings. As
for the unseasonablenesse in politic respects (though I do not take upon me
in^ight therein) yet so far as my reason is able to discern, it could never
have come more seasonably, to have a matter of such moment discussed, while
Reformation, and Laws confirming it were yet in fieri, all men knowing, that
it is too late to speak, when the Legislative power has fully enacted a Law.
And whereas Master Marshall says, he verily thought I would have (...) q^iet
by down, preached, kept my opinion to my self, and not have any further
appeared (especially at this time) to increase the flame of (...), I answer.
For my quiet sitting down, and preaching Christ, I can boldly and cheerfully
appeal to my Auditors of these Honorable Societies whereof not a few are
eminent persons in the Honorable house of Commons. For my app^^ring at this
time I have given reasons, which I suppose conscientious men will conceive
weighty, yea and preponderating (...) divisions that may happen if that of
Augustine be true, (...). Nor do I know that any such divisions or confusions
have happened by reason of my Te^^ises, or are likely to happen, but rather the
contrary. And if any divisions be now about that opinion they were before my
Treatises were published, and if they increase they are rather to be imputed to
the violence of those Preachers, who instigate the Magistrate to ex^^pate such
as Heretics, who hold the opinion, then to me, who by practice and profession
do hold Communion with them, that differ from me, and abhorse separation from
my (...) this regard. Nor do I doubt but that if it were not for the rigous of
many Preachers, a way might be found for Reformation in this matter without
such a flame of division and confusion, as Master Marshall apprehends. But I
wish that as in Germany the rigidnesse of some men was the destruction of the
Protestants there, so it happen not in like manner in England.

Another objection I meet with is, that I have printed my Treatises contrary to
the int^mation,. 4. Of freedom from publishing the two Treatises contra^y to
engagement, with a Declaration of the Authors proceedings therein.
or (as some allege) promise I made to Master Marshall: which Master Marshall
writing to me thus expresses* Page 1, 2. of his Defense. But when after some
friendly conference with you, you declared to me, that if you might enjoy
liberty to exercise your Minist^ry in some place, where you should not be put
upon the practice of baptizing of Infants, you could (yea and intimated to
(...) that you would) keep this opinion privat^ to your self, provided only,
that of any should preach in your pulpit for the baptizing of them, you should
take your self bound in the same place to preach against it; otherwise m^ns
preaching or printing abroad should be no provocation to you. And Page 244.
Master Marshall faith thus. For even to New England have some sent your
writings, and sufficiently in them showed your scorn of Master Thomas Goodwin,
Master Vines and my self, as our friends do from thence write unto us.

That I may clearly and fully answer this charge, and the former, and state my
self, and proceedings right in the thoughts of men, I think it necessary to
make this following Declaration. It happened that in the year 1627. reading the
Catechism Lecture at Magdalen Hall in Oxford, and having occasion in one of my
Lectures to examine whether there be such a privilege to the children of
Believers, that they should be accounted to belong to the Covenant, and Church
of God, I found not sufficient ground either from Genesis 17. 7. or from the
institution of Circumcision for the affirmative in that question. The substance
of my reasons then against the Argument drawn from Circumcision to baptism, I
have compacted in that short discourse, which is part. 2,. 8. Page 29. of my
Examen, and begins at those words, I dare not assent etc. Which being the
chief thing I stand upon. I wonder Master Marshall so lightly passes over
calling it a tedious discourse, altering my words, and saying nothing to the
reason I bring. Wherefore then, and since I declined the urging of those
reasons for it, and wholly rested on 1 Cor. 7. 14. conceiving that those words
[ but now are they holy] did import that privilege to the children of a
Believing Parent. And accordingly practiced baptizing of Infants upon the
warrant of that Text only, as I often told my Auditors at Lemster in
Hereford-shire, which some now about the City can witness. It happened after I
was necessitated to leave my place through the violence of the Kings Party,
after much wandering up and down with much danger to me and mine I came to the
City of Bristoll, and there preached for half a year, in which time in
dispute with an Antipaedobaptist, I urged that Text 1 Cor. 7. 14. which he
answered with so much evidence, as that although I did not fully assent unto
him, yet as one that durst not oppose Truth who ever brought it, I resolved
with my self to consider that matter more full, and to that end being
enfeebled with labor in preaching, and grief by reason of the public losses
at that time, and advised by my Physician to remove out of Bristoll,
understanding the Assembly was to sit in July 1643. I resolved to adventure a
journey to London through Wiltshire, to confer with my Brethren of the
Assembly, and by the advantage of Books in London to make further search into
that point. It pleased God to stop my journey then by that sad, and unexpected
overthrow near Devizes, which necessitated me to get away from Bristoll by Sea
into Pembrokeshire. While I was there I chanced to meet with Vessius his theses
de poedobaptismo, and therein reading Cyprians and others of the Ancients
Testimonies, I suspected that in point of antiquity the matter was not so
clear as I had taken it, but weighing those passages, I conceived that the
Ancients held only baptizing of Infants in the case of supposed necessity,
conceiving that by baptism Grace was given, and that all are to be saved from
perishing and after in process of time it became ordinary.

Wherefore I resolved if ever I came to London, to search further into those
two points of the meaning of 1 Cor. 7. 14. and the History of Paedobaptisme,
and accordingly God having brought my wife and children with much difficulty to
me after a second plunder, and by remarkable providence turning the wind
against the Ships when they went without us bringing us out of Pembrokshire the
day before it was appointed by the Kings Forces to send to apprehend me, making
the wind serve for a speedy voyage in four days from Milford Haven to the
Downs, presently upon the receiving us into the Ship (which I hope I shall
ever remember to the praise of our God) being come to London September 22.
1643. I applied my self to enquire into the points forenamed. It happened that
whereas I had this prejudice against the interpreting of the holiness of the
children 1 Cor. 7. 14. of Legitimation that no learned Protestant had so
expounded it, meeting with (...) his notes not long before printed at
Cambridge, I found him of that opinion, and after him Musculus and Melancthon;
and finding that the Sanctification in the forepart of the verse, must be
understood of lawful copulation, expressed by Beza thus, Fidelis uxor potest
cum infideli marito bona conscientia consuescere, which sense only was suitable
to the case resolved by the Apostle whether they might still continue together,
I observed that the Apostle speaking of the unbeleeving party mentions his
unbelief, but when he mentions the Believer, expresses only the relation of
husband and wife, and that the reason of the Apostle to prove their lawful
copulation is an Argument ab absurdo and including this proposition. All those
children whereof one of the parents is not sanctified to the other by lawful
cepulaetion are ^nclea^e, which being expounded of federall uncleanesse were
false, and is only true of bastardy, I concluded, that it was the meaning of
the Apostle, and could be no other. Whereupon when in a meeting of Ministers in
the City of London, the question was propounded what Scripture there was for
Infant Baptism, I told my Breth^^n plainly, that I doubted there was none.
This occasioned the Dispute Doctor Homes speaks of which happened about
January 1643. Concerning which though some gave out I was satisfied by it,
others that I was so convinced, that I had nothing to say, yet the truth is,
this was all the ground of those reports, that having at first stood upon it
that [(...), of such Matthew. 19. 14.] was meant only of such like, it being
urged that then it could not be a reason, why they should suffer those children
to be brought to Christ, I yielded that it was to be expounded as Beza
expounded it, horum and similium ut supra, as I express in my Exercitation,
and further granted that if when Christ says [ of these is the Kingdom of God]
he meant of their present state of regeneration they might be baptized, but
that our Savior meant it of their present state I did not grant: and I further
yielded that I should not stick at the baptism of an Infant concerning whom I
should be certified from God that it was actually regenerate, and believing,
meaning no more but this, that such a certificate would warrant me in such a
case to baptize, it being all one with a profession of faith, as signs made by
a dumb person that he was a Christian would warrant his baptism. This
concession being made merely upon a supposition of an extraordinary
revelation, first Ma^ter B^^ke, and after him Master Marshall have often urged,
though they have been often told, that a common rule cannot be drawn from an
extraordinary case. Not long after that Conference, my most loving and reverend
Father in law Master Henry Scudder fearing the event of this matter, after some
writing that past between us, advised me to draw up the reasons of my doubts,
and he undertook to present them to the Committee chosen (as I conceived it) to
give satisfaction about that point, which I conceived might well be by the
leave of the Parliament, as the appointing the Assembly to give satisfaction
about some doubts in taking the Covenant. And if the Committee as a Commit
could not do it (which I suppose they might have done by communicating what
after debate was prepared for the Assembly, which I presume was, certainly it
should have been accurately done with examination of what could be objected,
before those Articles in the Directory about this matter were passed) yet
particular members might have done somewhat to satisfy me, who would have been
then, and shall be yet satisfied with one convincing argument, that it was
Christ's appointment, that the Infants of Believers, because they are borne of
Believer are to be baptized. According to the advice given in a short space, I
first drew up the nine first Arguments in my Exercitation, which were delivered
as I relate in my Examen in February and March 1643. and after in July
following, the other three. Which I said in my Examen were delivered to Master
Tuckney, but Master Marshall tells me he does deny it, yet I conceive my Father
Scudder told me so, who I am sure would speak truth, and when I read that to
him he did not correct me in it, and Master Thomas Goodwin still says he had
them after Master Tuckney had perused them. Besides these Papers, that
satisfaction might more compendiously be given me at the motion of my reverend
Father in law, I set down in one page of a Paper in quarto, the maine ground of
my doubt, and delivered it to him, whether he communicated it to any else I
know not: my end was that satisfaction to me might more easily be procured.
This short thing I after put in my Examen, Part. 2.. 8. as I said above, which
Master Marshall calls a tedious discourse, though it contains less then forty
lines, and if it had been well answered, might have eased Master Marshall of
the rest of his labor. Now the Papers before named, I perceived were tossed up
and down from one to another, and it seems Master Edwards the Controversy
Lecturer at Christ-Church got them, and picking out some passages, but
concealing others that would have cleared them under pretense of refuting them,
with the writing of another which he joined with mine, merely abused me in the
Pulpit at Christ-Church: which I immediately charged him with after his Sermon
in the Vestry, and he only excused it by telling me he named me not, though
there were sundry Ministers there that knew he meant me. But this it seems is
like Master Edwards his justice to other men. In this time I attended Master
Thomas Goodwins Lectures about that Argument, had the patience to hear Master
Edwards his discourse at Christ Church, and read many Treatises and Sermons, in
many of which I found rather invectives than arguments. It happened that the
Parishioners of Fanchurch became disaffected to me, and refused to hear me,
though I meddled not at all with that matter in the Pulpit, and I perceived my
maintenance was likely to be withdrawn at the end of the year. Hereupon one of
the Assembly my loving friend, understanding that the Honorable Societies of
the Temples wanted a Preacher, solicited the bringing of me thither. But the
matter was by the Honorable House of Commons referred to the Assembly, who
chose a Committee to nominate a Preacher for them, of which Committee Master
Marshall was one, by whom I was rejected. Presently after which rejection,
having occasion of business in the behalf of some godly Pembrokeshire
Ministers, with that worthy Gentleman Master John W^i^e Chaire-man of the
Committee for plundered Ministers, he would needs argue with me about that
point of Infant Baptism, and after some dispute, he desired to have my answer
to his argument in writing. Which occasion I took to lay open my condition to
him in a Letter, which begot no other fruit but a little Treatise entitled,
Infants Baptism proved lawful by Scripture. Shortly after in August 1644. I
met with Master Marshal's Sermon, and finding the vehemence of his spirit
against Antipaedobaptists, and having had experience both of his, and Master
Whites inflexiblenesse by my former writings, and seeing no likelihood of
imploiment and maintenance for me and mine, except I would gather a separated
Church, which I durst not do* as not knowing how to justify such a practice, I
resolved to make a full answer to Master Marshals Sermon, and finished it
November 11. and having with much difficulty transcribed one Copy, and gotten
another written for me, I sent my own to Master Marshall, who received it
December 9 1644. About a fortnight after Master Marshall sent me word, that he
would find a time to speak with me: I sent him word, that for the returning
answer to my writing, I would not straiten him; but forasmuch as by his
rejecting me I missed being nominated to the Temple, and I was then brought to
great straights, I requested that he would declare as occasion should offer it
self, whether he held me fit for the Ministry or not, notwithstanding my
dissent from him in that point. His answer was, he desired to know first
whether I would keep my opinion to my self. I returned this answer in writing
by my Father Scudder. I request you to return this answer to Master Marshall,
that whereas I requested him to declare whether he thought me fit for the
Ministry or not, notwithstanding my dissent abo^t Poedobaptism, and he demands
of me a promise of silence in that point, I conceive he is bound by the rules
of justice, mercy, and prudence to do it without requiring that condition, and
that he has no reason to be jealous of me considering my carriage in this
matter. Nevertheless when I shall understand what promise he would have from
me, and what is intended to be done by him for the discussing the point, and
clearing of Truth, to which I ought not be wanting, and what advantage I may
have by his agency for my employment and maintenance, I shall give him a
punctual answer, and am resolved for peace sake to yield as far as I may
without v^^lating the solemn Covenant I have taken, and betraying truth and
innocence. December. 26. This begat the friendly conference mentioned by Master
Marshall, which was December. 30. 1644. in the morning before the Assembly sat. At
the very beginning of that Conference, Master Marshall having this last written
message in his hand, and reading those words, [ and he demands of me a promise
of silence in that point] told me that he did not demand of me a promise of
silence in that point; for that was beyond his line: this was his very
expression. As soon as ever I heard those words, I conceived my self freed
from the snare I most feared of making a promise, which as the case might
stand, I could not keep with a good conscience. Then Master Marshall spoke to
this effect, that yet for the satisfaction of those who should enquire of him
concerning me, he desired to know my intentions. Whereupon I dealt freely, that
I intended not to publish my opinion in the Pulpit, if I might be where I
should not be put to baptize: for I conceived it not likely, that there would
be a Reformation of that thing in this Age, there having been so long a
practice of Infant Baptism, and such a prejudice in men against the opposers
of it: yet I told him that if any should preach to that people I had charge of,
that which I conceived to be an error, I did resolve to oppose it there,
otherwise other men's preaching abroad should be no provocation to me: So that
it is clear, I made no promise, and that intimation of mine intentions which I
made was only, that I intended not to preach my opinion in that place unless
provoked there. And this any man may perceive was my meaning by Master Marshals
own relation, in which the prov^^ is rightly expressed; That if any should
preach in my Pulpit for baptizing Infants, I took my self bound in the same
place to preach against it, otherwise men's preaching or printing abroad should
be no provocation to me; to wit, to preach that opinion in that place. And
whereas Master Marshall alleges this for his Quietus est, he might have
remembered, that I told him in express terms, that it Laws were likely to be
enacted to make the denial of Infant Baptism penal, I held my self bound in
conscience to appear in public about that matter: yea, and Master Marshall
told me he intended me some animadversions on my Examen; whence it may be
collected, that neither Master Marshall nor my self had agreed to lay aside
the dispute it self. It is true, Master Marshall did endeavor to possess me
with this, That Reformation of Congregations might be without altering the use
of Infant Baptism. To which I answered, that though much might be done other
ways, yet it would never be right, till Christ's way of baptizing were
restored. About two hours after, Master Marshall coming to me, in the
presence of Master Obadiah Sedgwicke, repeating the intimation of my intention
aforenamed, with the proviso, told me, he would give testimony in my behalf as
I desired. Upon this I parted with Master Marshall, and Master Sedgewicke
walking with me, commended my proceeding in that matter, and made a notion to
me, which came to nothing. Upon this I went home very cheerful, not only
because I prized amity with Master Marshall, and there was a likely way of my
imploiment and maintenance; but chiefly because I was freed from that I feared,
as a snare, the promise of silence, and there were great hopes that my brethren
in the Ministry would not be rigid in ejecting out of the Ministry and
Communion, those that dissented from them in that point, and so separation and
mutual persecution might be prevented (which was and is still the great fear
that possesses my spirit) and liberty might in time be given for the shining
forth of the light in this thing, and by degrees Reformation might be
perfected, which I conceived the only safe and happy way. Upon these
considerations I acquainted sundry of my near friends with this mercy of God to
me, and being requested to join in keeping a day of Thanksgiving at Anth^l^^,
I (...) 1. following for public mercies, I made a special memento in my
book of special passages of my life, to bless God that day for the
conference I had with Master Marshall in peace and amity: What Master Marshall
did after for me I do not well know, I believe he did as he promised, and after
a trial of me three Lords-daies at the Temple, I was in the end of January
chosen by the Treasurers, and and sundry others of the members of both the
honorable Societies of the Temples to be their Preacher for a year.

After these things, being acquainted with a Law made in New England, and
proceedings against those that denied baptizing of Infants, I yielded to the
sending of my Examen thither, though not so large as it is now printed (for the
dissertation about a speech of Master Cotton Part. 3. Sect. 3. Page 42, 43. and
some other things were added since) merely to occasion the study of this matter
more exactly, and to allay the vehemence of their spirits, and proceedings
against those that dissented from them, and therewith I sent this short Epistle.

To all the Elders of the Churches of Christ in New England, and to each in
particular, by name to the Pastor and Teacher of the Church of God at Boston
there these present.
Reverend Brethren,
Understanding that there is some disquiet in your Churches about
Poedobaptisme, and being moved by some that honor you much in the Lord, and
desire your comfortable account at the day of Christ, that I would yield that a
Copy of my Examen of Master Marshall his Sermon of Infant Baptism might be
transcribed to be sent to you I have consented thereto, and do commend it to
your examination in like manner, as you may perceive by the reading of it I did
to Master Marshals; not doubting but that you will as in Gods presence; and
accountable to Christ Jesus weigh the thing, remembering that of our Lord
Christ, Ioh. 7. 24. Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous
judgment. To the blessing of him who is your God, and our God, your Judge, and
our Judge I leave you, and the flock of God over which the Holy Ghost has
made you overseers, and rest,

From my study at the Temple in London, May 25. 1645. Your Brother and fellow
servant in the work of Christ, JOHN TOMBS.


THe accounting of this act a showing of my scorn of Master Thomas Goodwin,
Master Vines, and Master Marshall, I take rather to be the effect of a
distempered palate, than a right-discerning taste.

After this, sundry things happened which did induce me to yield to the
importunity of those that solicited earnestly the publishing of my writings
for the public good. I had sent to Master Marshall after his return from
Scotland, to know what he would do about the motions I made in the Epilogue of
my Examen, for the discussing of the point in difference between him and me.
The best of the answer I received was, that since I had now a place for my
Ministry without baptizing Infants, he expected I would be quiet. About that
time I had occasion to make trial of the Assemblies approbation of me. The
Examiner told me, that there were many of the Assembly that did scruple in
Conscience, the giving approbation to me because of my opinion. The Directory
had been published, and an Ordinance of Parliament to make the not using it
penal. Preparations were to send Bills to the King, among which I assured my
self that would be one, which if once past, it would be too late to make an
afterplea. The Sermons in public were still as earnest against this tenet as
ever. The people of the City much enquired into this matter. A public
disputation was once allowed about it to which I was earnestly solicited but
for weighty reasons refused it. Sundry came to me to request the perusal of my
papers for their satisfaction many learned, godly, and prudent persons, both of
them that differed in judgment, as well as those that agreed with me, moved me
to have them printed, for the bringing of truth to light. I saw not wherein any
danger to the State or Church might be created by the printing of them, and
which was beyond all to me* I was confirmed it was a truth I held, had tried
all fit means to have it examined, had been guided in the searching of it, and
preserved for this business by many remarkable providence, and thereupon
after prayer to God by my self, and with others for his direction, I yielded
to the printing of them, not out of a restless spirit to vent my self, as
Master Marshall imagined, nor out of any mind to increase the divisions and
confusions of the time (then which there is nothing my spirit and ways more
abhor) but to vindicate truth, perform my duty to which I was bound by
solemn Covenant, to do my best for the preventing of that sad evil of
removing out of the Ministry, and out of Communion, and out of the State also
them that could not yield to Infant Baptism, which is more likely then any
thing to increase our divisions, and make tumults, especially if the relations,
and instigations of some fiery spirits prevail. And in this, I doubt not but I
have dealt faithfully to God and to the State, and charitably to other men,
without violating any engagement, what ever I suffer in mine own person. I
must confess had I seen any inclination in the Assembly, or Master Marshall,
or other leading-men to examine my writings in a fair Scholastike way, and had
I had means to be able to bear the charges of an impression, and no Laws
likely to be established to make the holding of my opinion penal, I had
resolved not to publish my writings in English, but in Latin, and therefore I
first framed my Exercitation in Latin, conceiving the Assembly would have
apprehended my aim and intention, to be to deal only with Scholars in this
matter: but all things falling out cross to my expectation, I conceived it was
the will of God it should be printed as it was. Thus much for the justifying
the publishing of my Treatises.

The next charge against me is my abusing my Antagonists.. 5. O^ the clearing
the Author of the two Treatises from scornfulnesse in writing them: of my
censure of M. Thomas Goodwins handling this point, and of all writers about
Col^s. 2* 12.
And in this Master Geree in his Epistle to the Lord Mountague speaks thus.

The Author whom I answer, has used his opponents more coursly then was
conventent to their worth, and places. But all men count his ^leightings of
opponents a blemish to his work. Master Marshall in his Defense, Page 244. For
even thither have some sent your writings, and sufficiently in them showed your
scorn of M. Thomas Goodwin, Master Vines, and my self, as our friends do from
thence write to us. And Page 53. I allege all this to show, you should not
thus vilify and scorn their (meaning the Ancients) practice and grounds, as
if the Century writers, and generally all Protestant writers, yea Master
Marshals own friend, if I mistake not, The^philus Philokyrtaces Lon^ardiensis
in his Dies Dominica, when they note the naevi quisquiliae blemishes, and
errors of Fathers and Councils did vilify and scorn them: which if it be an
uncharitable imputation to them, it is so to me, unless it be thought that men
cannot conceive bad enough of an Antipaedobaptist. Page 62. throughout your
whole Treatise you strive to make an ostentation of reading, and put abundance
of scoffs and jeeres upon them who are of contrary mind to you. Page 76. You
power out such abundance of scorn upon them, who think otherwise then you do.
I answer, 1. That the words interpreted as scoffing and scorning, and jeering
are not such, but usual School-expressions frequent in Schools, and in the
most temperate writings of the most moderate men of the same profession,
toward them that dissent from them, so that I assure my self, had not my
Antagonists before distasted my work, and consequently the Author, they would
not have been so construed. How ever Master Geree say all men count my
sleighting opponents a blemish to my work, yet one I am sure commended my
writing for the contrary, that I had discovered the weakness of the opponents
by such expressions, nor did my Father Scudder except against those passages as
offensive which Master Marshall does, though more then half was read to him,
and observed by him of purpose to avoid offense, before it was sent to Master
Marshall. 2. That there were many reasons why Master Marshall should have
otherwise conceived of me in those expressions, as namely my Declaration of my
intention, and petition thereupon in the prologue of the Examen, Part. 1. Sect.
1. my respective speeches of Master Marshall in the same place, Page 2. and
Part* 2. Sect 7. Page 26. and also in the Epilogue, Part. 4. Sect. 8. And if
Master Marshall had remembered it, when in our friendly conference he had told
me, he did not expect so high expressions from me, which I conceived he meant
of my downright censuring of his Arguments, not contemning his abilities, and I
told him I conceived it necessary to do so, because he called his Arguments
undeniable, and had charged the Anabaptists with a bloody sentence, I desired
an instance of such an expression as was offensive, which being given by Master
Marshall, I left those words out in the printed Book, and would have dealt so
with any other, had I conceived it would have been so construed. I might add
further, that when Master Geree came to me the day he published his* Book, a
month before Master Marshals Defense came forth, I told him he did not conceive
aright of me in that charge in his Epistle Dedicatory, and gave him my reason,
and told him that I might have much wrong by it, and desired that intimation
might be given to Master Marshall thereof. Which whether he did or no I know
not, but I supposed it might have occasioned Master Marshall if he could not
alter his Copy, yet to have added something in the beginning or end of his
Book, to have allayed the asperity of that charge. But what are those passage
in which I power out such abundance of scorn on. Master Vines, Master Thomas
Goodwin, and Master Marshall? All the passage of Master Vines thus interpreted
is Examen, Part 2. Sect. 6. But how knows Master Vines this? I do not take
Master Vines for a Prophet, and to infer this by reason, The Anabaptist
u^geth Matthew. 28. 19. against paedobaptisme, Ergo he will urge Romans 12. 19.
against Magistracy, is in my slender apprehension a baculo ad angulum. He had
said, the Anabaptists which urged Matthew 28 19. against padobaptisme when we
shall ^e thriven to his full stature, will undermine Magistracy by Romans 12. 19.
Which words seem to imply, that an Anti-paedobaptist is but a young
Anti-Magistrate, and that the same vegetative faculty, that is the same reason
that did nourish the one would beget the other. This inference being
unreasonable, yet spoken to such an Auditory by a man of such eminency at such
a time, and therefore tending to the suppression of Truth, and them that held
it, I conceived it necessary to blunt the edge of it, without any scorn of
him, whom I respect as my loving neighbor, but for necessary defense of truth,
in a School expression used by many Protestant writers, and among others, by
Master Gataker in his Rejoinder to Can in defense of Master Bradsha^, Page 113.
As for Master Thomas Goodwin it is true, Part. 3. Sect. 7. Page 68. of my
Examen I said thus. I remember Master Thomas Goodwin, who has handled this
matter of Poedobaptisme, by spinning out similitudes and conjectures (fit
indeed for the common people that are more taken with resemblances then
syllogismes) rather then with close Arguments. In this passage says Master
Marshall, Page 143. I stepped out of the way to reproach Master Thomas Goodwin,
that I vilify him as a man who by spinning out similitudes, and conjectures
deludes his A^ditory with such things rather then with satisfactory arguments,
that why like Ishmael my Sword should be against every man he cannot tell, that
he knows him to be a learned godly Divine, and an eminent Preacher of the
Gospel of Christ, and his worth not to be blasted by my scornful speeches,
that I have set down his Notions otherwise then he preached. To all which I
answer. That passage of mine was not to vilify Master Goodwin, but to pass a
right censure on his Sermons, as I did in like manner on Doctor Featlies
Treatise, Page 143. without any vilifying of his learning, because I saw the
esteem of them held men in error. Which is so frequent, and just a thing, that
it was held meet that an Advertisement should be added to the new Annotations
on the Bible, to prevent the danger of some passages in favor of the Prelacy
and Liturgy. Hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim. And this fact of mine
is most injuriously construed, as if I did this like an Ishmael that loved to
have my Sword against every man, as if I affected contention: then which there
could not be a thing more falsely charged on me, though in pursuance of truth I
held my self bound to examine every man's sayings, which I tell Master Marshall
in the Epilogue of my Examen, to be for exact disquisition of it. Doctor Twisse
in his Vindiciae gratiae against Arminius often makes digressions, and does
vocare ad parts Molinaeus, Piscator, Lubbertus, Alvarez, etc. He writes
against Doctor Iackson, Master Cotton, etc. Master Gataker against Doctor Ames,
Voetius, Balmford, Lucius, Gomarus, Master Walker etc. does any man therefore
make them like Ishmael whose Sword is against every man? Master Marshall says
that I vilify Master Thomas Goodwin as a man who by spinning out similitudes
and conjectures deludes his Auditors, and then gives him an E^^omium, in which
he would have it believed that I charged Master Thomas Goodwin as a man wont to
do thus, whereas my words (...) only concerning that matter of Paedobaptisme,
which does nothing prejudice him in his other works, of which I have in my
Examen, Page 163. given an Encomium. And for my censure, it was grounded partly
on his own expressions, that in sundry points pertaining to that matter we must
be content with hints, which is all one with conjectures, and partly on the
maine principles of his dispute; which were, that forasmuch as the promises to
Believers children are indefinite, as Acts 2. 39. Luke 19. 8. God has so cast
the order of his election, that multitudes come out of the loins of his
people, that administration of the Lords Supper and Baptism is to be by a
Judgment, that we are to judge any Infant-children of Believers to be holy by
parcels, though not all in the lump, that they are therefore to be accounted
holy with a real saving holiness, 1 Cor. 7, 14. Matthew. 19. 14. and therefore
to be baptized according to the rule employed, Act. 10. 47. Concerning which I
say still that I expected Arguments, but counted my self deluded with these
conjectures, as finding nothing to his purpose in any of these Texts, which
were the maine he alleged, they neither proving that God had ordered his
election so as for the most part to run through the loins of Believers, nor
that we are to judge any of the Infants of Believers to be in the Covenant, or
Elect by parcels, though not all in the lump, nor that Baptism is to be
administered by such a conjecturall or uncertain judgment. But forasmuch as I
have disputed at large in my Examen, Part. 2. Sect. 10. Part 3. Sect. 3. 4.
about the promises to Believers children, and examined all the Texts
forementioned, and showed that we are not to administer Ordinances by our
conjecturall judgment, concerning Gods Election, or inward holiness, God
having not made that the condition of his servants applying his Ordinances,
which can be infallibly known to none but himself, as Master Marshall rightly
in his Sermon of baptizing Infants, Page 3. but according to the certain
judgment of a persons profession of the faith, I shall not examine this thing
here at large: only I thought it necessary to say thus much, not to vilify Mr
G^odwin, but to show the weakness of the Cause, for which no better proofs
could be brought, then such uncertain guesses even by a man so able as Master
Thomas Goodwin, who has in other things showed his sufficiency beyond other
men. And though I deny not but I might mistake him in some passages, or not
exactly reci^^ his words; yet I do not conceive I have misreported his Sermons,
and however, and whenever they shall be printed, I hope I shall be able to
produce the written notes of others to verify my setting down his Notions; yet
if I should mistake passages in Sermons not printed, it were excusable, in
comparison of the usage I have met with from Doctor Homes, and Master Marshall
himself, who in not a few places, yea I may truly say all along, do in their
framing answers to my written speeches, crook my words where they are straight,
and they might have discerned them so to be, had their have in publishing their
answers permitted them to ponder my writings. As for instance: Master Marshall
had averred that the Christian Church has been in possession of
Infant Baptism for the space of 1500. years and upwards, I replied, that if
it were true, yet it is not so much as may be said for Episcopacy, etc. And
after, For antiquity not Apostolical there are plain testimonies of
Episcopacy, etc. being in use before any of the testimonies you or any other
can produce for baptizing of Infants. Now M. Marshall in his D^fe^c^, Page 7*
8. First sets down my words thus, As much may be said for Episcopacy, etc. That
there are plain testimonies, for Episcopacy etc. before any testimonies can be
produced for the baptizing of Infants, and then tells me, that the Ancients
testify that the baptizing Infants was received in all ages, and from the very
Apostles as a Divine Institution, no such thing of Episcopacy, if I can make it
good, I shall do a very acceptable service to the Papists, Anabaptists, and
Prelaticall party, if I cannot, I should do well to revoke that bold assertron.
In which Master Marshall deals not heartily with me, when I had said, if it
were tru^, yet it is not so much as may be said for Episcopacy, (meaning that
which he had said) the Church has been in possession of Infant Baptism 1500.
years and upwards, Master Marshall sets down my words, as if I had said, as
much may be said for Episcopacy, and in the latter passage leaves out the words
[ Antiqu^ty not Apostolicall] and [ being in use] and then insinnates, as if I
had asserted, that the Ancients say as much for the Divine Institution of
Episcopacy as for Infant Baptism. Whereas I only spoke of the possession and
being in use, nothing of the Divine Institution, and my assertion is so
manifest, that even the advertisement at the end of the New Annot: on the
Bible, confesses it a custom very ancient, and near the Apostles time, as
Chamier truly acknowledges, Lib. 10. c. 6. de Oecumenico Pontifice, Tom. 2.
Page 353 Mol^n in his Epistle to Bishop Andrews, (if my memory deceive me not)
confessed it to have been ab ipsis Apostolorum temporibus. And I conceive
Master Marshals leaving out in his proposition of the first part, [ as n^w
ta^ght] which was in mine, and framing it thus, in opposition to mine [
Infant Baptism no late innovation] may occasion an unwary reader to conceive I
had simply asserted it to be a late innovation. Now this course, though it may
perhaps not prejudice my writings with those that are able and willing to take
pains to compare together writing with writing, yet the greatest part either
through want of leisure or skill, or through disaffection to me or mine
opinion, or through a secure resting on* Master Marshals word neglecting it, it
is a great injury to me, and to the Truth, As for Master Thomas Goodwins
Sermons of Infant Baptism, whether my censure of them, or Master Robert Bailey
one of the Scottish Commissioners charge in his Dissuasive, Cha. 6. Page 119.
do more disparage them or him, I leave it to Master Marshal's, Master Goodwin's
and their friends consideration. It has been excepted against me that I say,
Page 139. of my Examen, which if he can apply to Infants, erit mihi magnus
Apollo, which is no worse then what Master Gataker has animadv. in Luci: Part.
1. Sect. 8. Page 22. Inter iustum and insontem qui distinctionem iustam
dederit. erit is mihi magnus Apollo: and that I have said Master Goodwin
dictated at Bow, which is so harmless an expression, that even the preface to
the new Annot: and the advertisement call their writings, their dictates.

Let us consider the scorns put upon Mr. Marshall. When I urged Mr. Geree in
private conference to instance in particulars, wherein I had dealt coursely or
slighted my opponents, expecting he would have showed me where I had falsified
their words, or belyed, or derided their persons; instead of any such matter he
alleges that passage, part 3. of my examination, page 36. of which Mr.
Marshall, page 94 of his defense says, This you cast away with scorn,
affirming it to be an easy answer, because it is easy to be answered; which
possibly may be thought to have some lepidity (which is sure but a venial sin
in one tired, as I was with hewing at such a knotty piece as Mr. Marshalls
Sermon) but how it should be a casting of scorn I see not. In the same place
Mr. Marshall says, I make my self merry with the word virtuall, as if the
examining the sense of a distinction, were making merry with it, page 103. He
says, I wonder you should seek to cast an odium upon my expression (as you
do here, and several other times) by saying it is a joining with Arminius. I
answer, where I said he joins with Arminius, I conceive still I said right;
not to east an odium upon his expressions, but to show the error of them. And
for that particular I charged Mr. Marshall with, in calling Proselytes, who
sought justification by the works of the law Abraham's seed, he joins with
Arminius in his Analysis, c. 9. ad Romans and opposes Bayne, it was right. For
Arminius says, Ratio est a duplice semine Abrahami, quorum unum tantum verbo
isto and proposito comprehendatur. And this double seed of Abraham he calls the
sons of promise, whom he defines, sunt illi qui fide in Christum justitiam and
salutem quaerunt, and the children of the flesh, whom he defines; qui per opera
legis justittam, and salutem consectantur. ( I confess it was in my copy
through an easy, but not material oversight; consequuntur, yet in the English
I render it, follow: but why this should puzzle Mr. Marshall I know not) And to
this calling some Abraham's seed, who no otherwise were Abraham's seed, but in
that they professing Judaisme, sought righteousness by the law, Bayne rightly
opposes that speech, that those that conceive carnally of the law seeking
righteousness by it without something else adjoined, to wit natural
generation; are never called Abraham's seed. Yet Mr. Marshall in his Sermon, and
again in his defense, page 10. calls those Abraham's seed, who are not so by
natural generation, or by faith; but are Proselytes, seeking Justification by
the works of the Law: Which is the very ground of Arminius his perverting the
ninth of the Romans to maintain his opinion of respective Predestination. As
for Master Marshall's vindication of himself, it goes upon this mistake, as if
I had charged him with agreeing with Arminius in the expounding the ninth to
the Romans, and in his opinion of election upon foreseen faith, whereas I only
charged him with joining with Arminius in this particular, to call the
Proselytes that were Jews by profession, but sought righteousness by the law,
Abraham's seed; page 105. Mr. Marshall says, that I try all my wits and
artifices to shake the strength of his second conclusion by scornful speeches,
etc. The truth is, I was put to the trial of all my wits to find out the
meaning of his second conclusion; but as for the strength of it, it is so
small, that he that can but show the ambiguity in it, may refute it without
much ado. As for the scornful speeches Mr. Marshall can find but one, which
was the calling of his second conclusion, a Cothurnus; which I never dreamed
would have been taken for an expression of scorn, but a proverbiall phrase
signifying an ambiguous speech used by David Pareus in his judgment on the 5
Articles sent to the Synod of Dort, and by others the most grave, and solid
Divines, I said, page 54. That Mr. Marshall did very carnally imagine the
Church of God to be like civil corporations, this he calls page 121. a
scornful puff, but why he should call it so, I am yet to seek. page 124. he
says, that I slight and scorn that which I know nor how to answer, but it
would be hard for Mr. Marshall to verify this in any particular; page 133. he
calls the use of the word Coccysme very frequent among Scholars, and of the
same meaning with Crambe used by Mr. Marshall, page 256. a scornful
expression; and because I say, page 63. of my Examen, your argument needs a
swimmer of Delos to bring it out of the deep, this he calls page 134. my method
to cast a scorn upon an argument, which is only the using a proverbiall speech
used by Spanheimius in his dubia Evangelica, and others concerning a thing that
there is need of skill to find it out, page 162. 163. in answering the argument
brought to prove that holiness, 1 Cor. 7. 14. is not federall Mr. Marshall
says. All the reply you make to (...), page 80. is to bestow a few scoffs
upon it; that my answer is to deny the conclusion, that I show no faultiness
either in the matter, or the form of the argument, that the scope that I
mention is but a mere figment; that I do as good as say that the objectour can
make no argument out of it, and that therefore I need make no answer. And that
in one place I grant the minor, then the major; and thus you most gallantly
vapor upon me: and after, I durst leave all Scholars to judge, whether my
answer deserves all this scorn; and after, you thought to carry it with more
advantage to you by scoffing, then by solemn refuting; and after. Truly Sir, I
am persuaded all learned men either laugh at, or pity this vanity of your
disputing; and page 164 not once suspecting I should have met with an adversary
so uningenious to say no worse, who would have said the balking of this
question, had been the yielding of the cause. To all this I reply, that my
words are misrecited by Mr. Marshall. I did not say, his answer is to deny the
conclusion, but thus, I find no answer to the argument here, except it be an
answer to an argument to deny the conclusion. Nor do I say, that the baulking
of the question, whether the believer, when he commits fornication with an
infidel, remove the bar in the unbeleeving party, as that the child is (in
the believing parents right) to be reckoned to belong to the covenant of Grace,
and Church of God, had been the yielding of the Cause, which he makes my
uningenuity. 2. The passages only tax a defect in Logic in Mr. Marshall in
that place, but do indeed contain neither matter of scorn, nor gallant
vapouring. 3. And however learned men pity or laugh at the vanity of my
disputing, I doubt not to make it appear; that neither Mr. Marshall nor Mr.
Geree have yet made an answer to that argument, which does overthrow his
exposition of federall holiness, that though Mr. Geree says there was
ignoratio Elenchi, yet indeed there is no ignoratio Elenchi, the thing being
concluded that was to be concluded; and whereas Mr. Marshall first new makes
the major, and then denies it, he deals not rightly in putting in words to
another argument, and yet the major is rather true with his addition, and then
Mr. Marshall puts a minor of his own; and denies it. But the truth is, the
argument should be thus framed: That holiness which might be though one of the
Parents, were not sanctified to the other, is not here meant; but faederall
holiness might be, though one of the Parents were not sanctified to the other.
Ergo, Federall holiness is not here meant; or thus, that uncleanesse which
does not agree to all the children of those whose Parents are not sanctified
one in or to another is not here meant: but federall uncleanesse does not agree
to all the children of those whose Parents are not sanctified one in or to
another; Ergo, Federall uncleanness is not here meant. But these things I
reserve till I review the dispute about the meaning of 1* Cor. 7. 14 concerning
which I doubt not, but if God spare me life and liberty I shall make good my
argument, and answer Mr. Marshalls exceptions, yea and further show, that if
the sanctification and bolinesse be taken from the faith of one party, and not
from the relation of husband and wife; the Apostles reason as they expound it,
would have served to resolve two fornicatours whereof one is a believer, the
other remaining in infidelity; that they may live together as well as two
married persons. page 10. I said, surely this is a s^^nd sign that you are not
likely to make good your ground, when you have yielded so much: this he calls
page 105. an idle scoff, enough in it there is nothing like a scoff. page
113. I say. But your fe^^hing such a compass about, makes me imagine your
attempt will prove but a parturiunt montes, the mountai^es bring forth. This Mr
Marshall calls a jeere, and a confident scoff, and I confess this carries the
show of a jeere, when the other part of the verse is ^^^ed; but I left it out
of purpose, that it might not be so taken; conceiving Mr. Marshall would have
construed it (as even grave Scholars use it) to signify an attempt that is
fair in show, but vain in the issue. page 122. I say of Mr. Marshall's
consequence which he called undeniable and clear, thus: if you apprehend clear
consequence in it, you may enjoy your conceii; nos non sumus adeo sagaces, we
are not so quick witted; this Mr. Marshall says, page 208. is to seek to
render an adversary ridi^ulous, by jeeres and scoffs. But the truth is that
was not mine intent, but the grief of my spirit when I wrote this, being then
rejected by Mr. Marshall in the business of the Temple, being told that it was
the Assemblies rule not to nominate any to a place in the ministry that
questioned the baptizing of infants, pinched with the sadness of my condition,
and considering how the Magistrate was incited against such as could not
subscribe to Mr. Marshalls judgment, upon his reasons which he called
undeniable, an indignation that men should be undone for not assenting to so
poor proofs, made me after I saw my exercitation stirred not to use that
quickness in those expressions; which I am persuaded, had I not done, the
point would not have been examined by them to this day: p. 122. Mr Marshall
says, your answer is a scoff out of Horace, Amph^ra coepit institui, etc.
which is no scoff, but a speech often in the writings of Scholars, used to
signify, that one falls short of that he should prove. page 164. I speak of Mr.
Marshalls discourse about Gods sealing conditionally to infants, and their
after agnizing thus. And therefore this that you make an objection I look on
as a frivolous supposing a Chimaera, and then disputing about it. This Mr
Marshalls calls a scoff. But what is more usual with Scholars, then to call
a fiction a Chimaera, without the imputation of scoffing? And these are all the
supposed scoffs against Mr Marshall, that I find noted by him. Now that it may
appear how unequally Mr Marshall deals with me, (that I mention no other)
that most accurate and grave writer Mr Gatak^r in a little thing containing but
60 pages, in a full letter entitled Antithesis, in answer to two Protestants
godly men, and as eminent as Mr Marshall; Doctor Ames an Englishman Professor
of Divinity at Franiker in Westfriesland, and Gisbert Voetius Professor of
Virecht, about Lusory lots: has these passages, page 6. Sibyllae qod fertur
folium: sed qod nisi sibylla nobis explicuerit interpretaturum alium credo

Pythagoricum illud (...). sufficeret. Which passages as I conceive no men ever
charged with scoffing so neither do I conceive justly might mine, which show
no more sleighting or contempt of my opponents then his do.

But page 94. of my Examen I say, the misunderstanding of Colos. 2. 11. 12.
has been the Ignis fatuus, foolish fire, which h^th led men out of the way in
this matter into bogs. Upon this Mr Marshall page 170. thus speaks to me. Truly
sir, were these scorns of being led by foolish fire into bogs etc. cast upon my
self only, it were nothing; but when they are thus cast in the faces of all
Divines, ancient and modern; all Harmonies and Confessions (except only a
handful of upstart Anabaptists) as if they were all such simple ones that an
^gnis fatuus, a fools fire might lead them into any bogs; I can hardly forbear
to tell you: it is an argument of an arrogant spirit.

I pity Mr Marshall's distemper, that occasioned this passage, to speak of
casting scorns in the faces of all Divines ancient and modern, as if all
Divines did expound that text, in that misunderstood way I mention; to talk of
all Harmonies and Confessions, instead of the Harmony of confessions, which
contains not many; and one I am sure it is not against, to wit the English
confession: to speak disdainfully of them that are his opponents under the term
of upstart Anabaptists to make the using of the term ignis fatuus, to resemble
a misunderstanding a scoff; to impute it to me as if I had accused all Divines
ancient and mod^rn all Harmonies and Confessions of simplicity: as if a
misunderstanding might not be in all men out of common infirmity* to impute it
to me as if I had said into any bogs, whereas I said, has led men out of the
way in this matter into b^gs meaning the opinions; that Baptism succeeds into
the place, room* and use of Circumcision: and therefore that the command to
circumcise male infants at the eighth day, is a command to baptize any infants
of beleivers at any time; which errors I call bogs, as being indeed
Anti-evangelicall errors: though all the Divines on earth should avouch them,
yet this I may say without arrogance of Spirit, in just and necessary avouching
of the truth. That reverend and learned Divine Mr Gataker in his answer to Mr
George Walkers vindication, page 133. Says thus. Howsoever I suppose it no
such hainour matter in something to depart from all writers known to (...)
that have gone before us. Sure I am that Junius and Tremellius in translating
and expounding some passages of Scripture, departed from all known Interpreters
than had gone before them as in that place, Mal. 2. 16. that in all, even the
best translations ever before ran; if thou, hate her, put her away* Pareus
Comment: in 1 Cor. 1. 12. miror vero hoc loco omnes fere^ interpretes fictionem
statuere. I might fill a volume with interpretations different from all
foregoing; yea, what interpreter of note is there who does not differ from all
others, and yet it is not counted arrogance? Besides, if this be not allowed
upon cogent reason, how shall Scriptures and Truths be cleared? How shall we
avoid idolizing of them that go before us, Of the exposition I give of Colos
2* 12. Confessed to be right by Mr Marshall himself.
and subjecting our judgments to them? And that I spoke right, it may appear
in that* in the principal thing of my exposition of Colos. 2 11. 12. to wit,
that Baptism is mentioned not to show that it succeeds Circumcision, but
because it is one of the means whereby we have communion with Christ, and are
comple (...) in him, and therefore Faith is joined with Baptism, and alleged
to prove it; Gal. 3. 25, 26, 27. (not as in Mr Marshall's defense, Gal. 5. 25,
26.) and Romans 6. 3, 4* 5. which plainly shows that here Baptism is not
mentioned to that end Mr Marshall expresses, and upon which the
misunderstanding of this place was occasioned, but to another; and therefore it
proves not that which Mr Marshall would gather from it; if it did, it would
prove that faith succeeds into the room place, and use of Circumcision as well
as Baptism. To this Mr Marshall plainly says, But is not this the same, sense
with mine. But he after spends a great many words to no purpose (as he is wont
to do when he mistakes my reason) imagining I had reasoned thus. Baptism is
named as one of the means whereby we come to be complete in Christ, therefore
i^ does not succeed in the room of circumcision, whereas my reason is t^us.
Baptism is alleged as one of the means whereby we come to be complete in
Christ, therefore there was another reason besides the succession of it into
the place of Circumcision, why the Apos^^ there me^tions it, which Mr Marshall
denied; which reason is good, except it were true, that every means whereby we
are complete in Christ, succeeds Circumcision, the contrary whereof is
confessed by Mr Marshall in acknowledging faith to be one of the means whereby
we are complete in Christ, which yet succeeds not Circumcision: many more such
mistakes in Doctor Homes, Mr. Geree, and Mr Marshall, I may hereafter show; I
thought it best however God deal with me to clear my self in this, and to
take notice of this concession, which with others I may improve to overthrow
all Mr Marshall's dispute. But it is arrogance to deny that which all reformed
Churches reach, that our Baptism succeed into the plane, room, and use of
the Jews Circumcision.

To this I answer: 1. I know not that all the reformed Churches teach this, I
remember not where this Doctrine is determined in the Church of (...) public
Doctrinals. 2. Master Gataker in his Postcript to Master Wo^ns Defense, says
thus, That justification (...) remission of (...), for my part I deem erro^^us,
and suppose that elsewhere I have evidently showed (...) so to be; how be it
Calvin, B^^^, Olev^^, (...), Piscator, Parens, ^^sculus, Bullinger, Fox, and
diverse (...) of great (...), and name, yea whole Synods of ours are (...) so to
say, and yet I never heard this charged for arrogance on him. And for the
assertions I impugn, that Baptism comes in the place, room, and use of
Circumcision, and that this may be proved from Colos. 2. 11, 12. though Master
Marshall hold his rod over me, saying, I can hardly forbear to tell you it is
an argument of an arrogant spirit, I fear not yet to call them an iguis (...)
of the way in this matter into begs. To conclude my answer to this charge of
scoffing, I do the less marvel that it is my lot to be thus charged, when Mr
Geree in his vindiciae paedob^ptes^^, Page 60, 67. calls one free speech very
necessary of Master Ralph (...) a man so approved, as by Ordinance of
Parliament constituted Master of a House in Cambridge, a quipping (...) of a
satyricall spirit against our reverend Divines, (...) checked, abhorred, not
countenanced. And I say further that if my memory do not deceive me, there are
passages in (...), that carry as much show of irony as mine do, toward a man
for age, and learning not inferior to Master Marshall, and therefore I suppose
my words, which are usual among Scholars, might have had a more favorable
construction. I am bold to make use of Master Gatakers words to Lucius, Part.

I profess freely, that had I dreamed such expressions so usual in Scholastic
disputes would have been so taken, I would for avoiding of offense have
abstained from them.

There is another charge against me that sticks deeper then the former,. 6. Of
the clearing the Author of the Examen from either justifying the Anabaptists in
(...), or condemning the godly, and grave Nonconformists in England.
and it is this: Master Marshall in his Sermon had mentioned the Anabaptists as
a dangerous and turbulen^ sect, working a world of mischief about Munster, and
other parts of Germany. This relation I conceived to be used, not only to
Magistrates to make them wary to prevent the like, b^t also in all sorts of
Auditories, with much ingemination to make the persons that question the
baptizing of Infants odious, and unsufferable in a Christian Commonwealth, and
to stop men's ears against such evidence as may clear the truth in this
matter. To this therefore, as being an objection in the mouth of all sorts of
men against the Ant^paedobaptists, I thought it best to answer: 1. By granting
much of the relation to be true, though perhaps vehemence of opposition ^ath
made matters more, or worse then they were, as it is wont to be in such cases.
To this Master Marshall says, that he is confident I show more good will to
the Anabaptists, then intend ill will against those worthy men who have written
those stories. I do take with the right hand this charitable opinion in Master
Marshall of my intentions, and I plainly reply, that the truth is, that I did
use those words, neither out of partial good will to the one, nor partial ill
will to the other, but out of a desire to remove that prejudice, which hindered
men from examining the Truth. As for the men I abhor the wicked practices of
the one, yea so much the more I abhor he practices of them that would so
solemnly by baptism engage themselves to be Christ Disciples, and yet act such
monstrous villainies, as having learned that the more profession a man makes of
holiness, the more accursed is his wickedness; and for the other, I bear as
much good will to the memory of them, as if they had agreed with me in opinion.
I hope I shall never make agreement with me in opinion, the reason or rule of
my love, but relation to Jesus Christ, appearing in holiness of life. Master
Marshall says, that the things are not to be questioned, and that he thinks
that I am the first of our Divines who have suspected them to overlash in their
relations. To this I say, my words are plain, that much of this is true I make
no question, meaning the maine of the relations, that the men denied baptizing
of Infants, and that they brake out into such turbulent practices as are
related of them. That which I added though perhaps vehemence of opposition has
made matters more, or worse then they were, as it is wont to be i^ such cases,
meaning this, of some particular circumstances in some persons, was not because
I suspected the overlashing of the Historians, as if they wanted fidelity, but
because many things were brought to the public knowledge by the Bishop and
Canons of Munster, their partisans who were Papists, and would aggravate all
things to the most to make the Lutheran Reformation become odious; as Studley
did in the accident of Euoch ap Evan killing his mother and brother, or else by
captives or desertors, who for favor or mercy would frame their tales, as they
conceived might further their ends and because experience of the uncertainty of
the manner of carrying things in our times, has made me speak warily
concerning things past. And to speak plainly, when I consider what Hooker
relates out of Guy de Bres of the seeming holiness of the generality of them,
their Orthodox confession at first mentioned by Master Marshall from Master
Dury his knowledge, the proceedings and parts of Bernardus Rotmannus and some
others, the things mentioned by my Examen, Part, 2. Sect. 3. the testimonies of
Gualter, and Cassander, that the commotions in Germany began from oppression in
the State, that Luther wrote to the Germane Princes against their opressions,
the strange spirit of Lutherans ever since, and the woeful tragedies of Germany
in this last age, I do count the story of the Anabaptists to contain in it
many things, the true reasons of which, and the true knowledge of the
circumstances concerning them will not appear till the day of the revelation
of the righteous judgment of God. 2. I assigned some possible means of the
turbulent carriages, and errors of the Anabaptists, beside their opinion of
Antipaedobaptisme. To which Master Marshall says, he can hardly guess whether
I int^^ded to excuse the Anabaptists in part, or to blame the Reformed Churches
for not hearing them, or to hint it as a warning to our selves. I answer, I did
it to show there might be other reasons of those tumults and divisions that the
Anabaptists fell into, then the opinion of Antipaedobaptisme; sundry of which,
if not all I think happened in their case. Master Marshall says, he never read
that they sought Reformation in a regular way, or were denied it, before they
fell into those furies. How far they sought it I cannot tell, it is plain
that Carolostadius and Pelargus and some say Melancthon would have reformed it
in Saxony, had not Luthers pertinacy in that as well as Consubstantiation, and
Images withstood it; and how Baltazar Huebmer sought it at Zurich, and was
denied, it, is known. I think the Reformed Churches have been to blame, and so
may be our present Reformers, that they have never yielded to reform it in a
regular way; and if Anabaptists have never sought it before me, it has been
it is likely, because they saw men's spirits so bent against them, that they
thought it in vain, yea they have been rather forced to conceal themselves,
it having been accounted criminal, justly deserving excomunication,
deprivation, and sometimes death, so much as to question it. And that the
Anabaptists have been so cast out and rendered odious as they have been has
been the reason why they have been forced to become a Sect (which I do not
justify) and by reason thereof, factious spirits have joined with them, and
perverted them with other errors, which perhaps had not happened, had they
been more tenderly and considerately handled at first. 3. I said, but have not
the like* of not the same things happened in other matters? Did not the like
troubles happen in Queen Elizabeth's days in seeking to remove Episcopacy and
^eremoni^s? To this Master Marshall says, The rest of that Section, is to me
extremely scandalous, when I read your odious compar^^^^s between the
Non-conformists in Queen Elizabeth's days, and the Anabaptists in Germany; it
even grieves me to consider, whether affection to your cause does carry you And
Master Geree not only Page 70. of his Vina^^c^^ paedobapt^smi, wonders at me
that I should compare the troubles of the Non-conformists, and the Anabaptists,
and marva^les such an uncharitable and unjust thought should arise in me, that
divisions or other miscarriages of the Non-conformists should bring them low in
England: And beside all this, Master Geree publishes a single sheet in print,
and it came to my knowledge first by one that carried it about with other news
Books, and this Paper he styles the Character of an old Pur^tan (...)
Nonconformist, and in the end says thus: R^ader s^ing a passage (...) Master
Tombs his book against P^dob ^pt^sme, where in he compares the Non-conformists
in England, to the Anabaptists in Germany, in regard of their miscarr^ages and
ill success in them endeavors till of late years, I was moved for the
vind^cation of those faithful, and reverend witnesses of Christ* to publish
this character. In which Mr Geree plainly insinuates, that I acculed those
faithful witnesses of Christ, whom he calls elsewhere the grave, godly, learned
and unblameable Non-conformists in England. I o answer this objection, I say
that I never had a thought by those words Did not divisions and other
miscarriages and persecutions, bring the Non-conformists of England as low as
the Anabaptists in Germany? To accuse those men he names of such miscarriages.
I honor the memory of Cartwright, Brightman, Hildersham Parker, Dod* Bradshaw,
and the rest of the same stamp as godly, learned, unblameable and faithful
servants of Christ. But I said some there were tha^ in seeking to remove
Episcopacy and ceremonies did by their divisions, meaning those of Brown*
Barrow, and others, and other miscarriages, meaning of the writers of the Books
called Martin M^rprelate, and the like, the miscarriages of Hacket and his
companions, the Prelates taking hold thereof to accuse them as seditious* and
to incense the Queen and State against them with per^ec^tion bring them as low
as the Anabaptists in Germany. And I said that the like if not the same
troubles happened here in England as in Germany, meaning not in the degree, out
in the kind, not in the fruit, but in the seed, which if the prudence of the
State here had not timely prevented (which could not be so well done in
Germany, by reason of so many petty free States) might have broken out into as
great a flame as those combustions in Germany. In which my intent was not to
discredit Bullinger, Sl^id^n, Calvin, etc. no^ to justify in the least manner
the Anabaptists wicked practices, but only to show that in seeking to reform
an abuse, there may happen such miscarriages* and divisions, by the Devils
stirrring up some ^actious and by pocriticall spirits of those that join with
the seekers of Reformation, to break out into heinous enormities of (...) to
stop men's mouths from speaking for, and men's ears (...) ^^aring of Truth. And
therefore all that love the Truth, (...) they have reason to suppress those
turbulent spirits, and (...) heed of men's heady advises though for a good end,
yet they should not yield to the Devil so much as to permit him by the
clamours against those factious spirits, to cheat them of the Truth, or to make
them less, but rather morezealous for it. And that this was my meaning, had my
words been either well heeded, or heartily construed, might have been perceived
by them. Here I wish Master Geree to consider whether it were agreeable to that
friendship he acknowledges to have been between us, without any violating of
it on my part, to publish such an unjust charge against me, and so to lay more
burdens on my back, after I told him he had not dealt kindly nor rightly with
me in his Epistle Dedicatory to a Peer of the Realm in aspersing me, whereby
I might suffer much and never be heard speak for my self, and yet never once
ask me though he had twice conference with me, once a little before his Book
was published, the other, the same day it was put forth, whom I meant in those
passages. I may well take up that speech of Absalom to Hushai, Is this thy
kindness to thy friend? Now from that which has been said, it will be easy
to answer Master Marshal's Quaeres. The Anabaptists in Germany rose up, and
with fire and Sword pulled down Magistracy, Schools, etc. did the like, if not
the same things happen here? It Is true the Bores (...) Country people over all
Germany did such things, and among them were those that they called
Anabaptists, but these things were done by others then Anabaptists, and in some
places where it does not appear to me that any such were: the cause of which
was pr^tended the oppressions of the people by the Princes, but in Truth* their
desire to plunder, and spoil. Now though the seekers of the removal of
Episcopacy, and Ceremonies did not the same things in degree, yet they did such
seditious things as were of the same kind, and tended to them, as inciting
against the Magistrates; such invectives against Schools, as had they not been
withstood, might have produced the same effects, of which you may see passages
out of Barrow* in Master (...), Chap. 2* And I pray God we never* find by
experience, that discontented I Presbyterians can act the like things for their
Presbytery, that Anabaptists did for their Anabaptism* Mr Marshall says, what
did the Non-conformists ever endeavor to do beyond prayers and tears? If M.
Marshall mean by non-conformists such as M. Geree describes in his Character, I
have nothing to accuse them, but if he mean by Non-conformists those that
^ought to remove Episcopacy and Ceremonies (which was my phrase, knowing that
in process of time the term Non-conformists was contradistinguished to
Separat^sts) some of them used railing against men in place and authority,
witness the Libels of Martin Marprelate, and such like in too great abundance,
some of them, if Cam^en relate true in his Anuals of Elizabeth ad Annum 1591.
either conspired with, or some way animated Hacket, upon conceit that he was
an extraordinary person raised by God to bring in the Discipline. Master
Marshall says what turbulent Sect was ever among them, my words were, Did not
some of them that ^ought to remove Episcopacy and Ceremonies* grow a dangerous
and turloulent Sect? Which words of mine are true in the followers of Brown,
Barrow, etc. whom I think Mr Marshall will not deny to have been a dangerous
and turbulent Sect, and they were at first a part of them that sought to remove
Episcopacy and Ceremonies. He asks, what were those divisions and miscarriages
which brought them so low? (...) had said, Did not divisions and other
miscarriages and persecutions bring the Non-conformists of England as l^w as
the Anabaptists? The divisions I meant, were those that were between the
Separatists and other Non-conformists, the miscarriages I meant, were those of
Martin Marprelate, Barrow, Hacket, and others which did meite Queen Elizabeth
and the S^ate against them, to arm the Bishops with their power, by which they
did persecute them. Dr John Burges rejoinder, Chap. 2. Sect. 11. Page ^5. ^or
my part I think that the violence of some meaner ^en against those things,
has caused the sharper execution of Laws against some other men of worth.
Crudelem medicum intemperans ager facit. Master Marshall touches the story of
Hacke^ and his companions and then says: But what is this to your purpose
(...) had Hacket to do with the Non-conformists, who you know ((...) fever you
read the story) abominated him, and would have nothing to do with him (...)
before he (...) into those p^ankes he played in London? I answer, I have read
the story of Hacket in Camdens Annals of Queen Elizabeth ad annum 1591. in
Saravia against Beza de diver^^s ministrorum gradibus, in Stow and How, and I
do not find by these that the seekers to remove E^iscopacy did abominate him as
you say, but that Wiggi^ton a Minister, and others of that party did either
conspire with him, or otherwise encourage him upon the hope they had, that by
him the Discipline should be p^omoted, and I find many practices like those of
John of Leyden at Munster, as the pretending of revelations, affecting
anointing as a King, commanding his Prophets Arthington and Coppinger to go
into the City and preach, exciting the people against the Archbishop and Lord
Chancelour yea I find Hacke^'s end to have been worse in a more horrible manner
than that of ^ohn of Leyden: nor do I doubt had London been in the same state
as Mu^ster was, but the Tragedy would have been as bad in the seeking to remove
Episcopacy and Ceremonies, as it was in seeking to remove Paedobaptisme. And if
the Non-conformists did abominate Hackes, so did the Anabaptists that followed
Mennon, the Munster, and Batenburgick, furies. And as for the parallel I
brought out of Whitg^ft and Hooker, I did it not to justify their charges
against the Non-conformists, but to show that they deprehended a likeness of
spirit and ways in some of the one, as well as the other. And my end in the
whole was to show, that in seeking to remove a real error, and abuse,
fa^^ious persons may fall into such miscarriages, and yet their miscarriages
ought not to hinder the Reformation of the error or abuse, though these things
may well be urged for caveats to Magistrates and people, to suppress and take
heed of the seditious practices of such agents: which warning being rightly
taken, is good and necessary, yea perhaps more necessary for these times then I
at first imagined, and so needs not a del^a ur, but a right construction.

Another charge Master Ley, and Master Marshall fasten upon me that I wrote my
Treatises as a braving Goliath,. 7. Of the clearing of the Author of the two
Treatises from va^nting and challenging in the composing and publishing the
Treatises.
so Master Ley, ub^ supra: Master Marshall in his Defense, Page 2. And came
into the field so bravingly and gyantlike. Page 244. Truly Sir, thu smells a
little too ranckely, thus confidently to challenge all men, not contented with
Goliath to say, give me a man that I may fight with him, but to defy a whole
host, argues a little too much self confidence: To which I answer If Master
Ley, or Master Marshall either had allowed me so charitable an opinion, as my
forepast life and actions might have induced them to have of me, or heeded my
words in the prologue and Epilog^e in my Examen, they would never have fastened
this charge of a braving Goliath, or c^^fident challenging or defying a whole
host on me. ^or my bygone actions, they rather speak me a man willing to
gratify others, and to serve the common good, then to make estentation of my
self out of self confidence. There are many that can make report of my
labors in the places where God has disposed of me, there are none that can
give one instance, wherein I have put my self forward to show my parts either
in Preaching the public Sermons in the University, or at Paul's, or in great
meetings in the Country* or before great men, or the Parliament, or the
Armies, out what ever I have done upon any such occasions, necessity or
conscience have induced me to it. And for my writings such as they are, setting
aside the Examen and Exercitation, they carry their plea for them in their
forehead. Infirmities I have, and those many, but sure the whole course of my
actions are a plea for me against this imputation of a braving, challenging,
vaunting humor: yea did not the mindfulnesse of my account in God, love to the
souls of men, and the discharge of my duty, lead me into public actions, I
should rather embrace that advise, be^^ qui latuit, been vixit. Certainly in
this business, I was so far from the braving humor, that, as may be
perceived by the relation above, necessity engaged me to it, not self
confidence, and an humor of ostentation. The truth is, there were other
arguments that I had entered upon, before I was engaged in this matter, as
namely against the mortality of the soul, universal grace, the Antinomian
errors about justification, and justifying faith* and some since, as about the
matter and form of a particular visible Church, about the nature of Schism
and Heresy, in which I might safely have exercised such abilities as I have,
if self ostentation had been my motive, and not have put my finger in this
fire, durst I desert the Truth. But how uncharitably Matter Ley, and Master
Marshall do construe my action, I think it will presently appear to him that
shall read the Prologue, and E^^logue of my Examen, especially those speeches,
wherein I declared my intentions to be either to rectify Master Marshall, or
to be ractified by him, that we might give one another the right hand of
fellowship* and I pray that the Lord would vouchsafe to frame our spirits to
seek the truth in humility and love, which might have given them cause to have
conceived otherwise of my disposition, then they have done, except they judged
my speech hypocritical, which I am sure would have been beyond their line to
do. In the Epilog^e I tell Master Marshall, that I examined his Sermon in the
midst of many wants, distractions, discouragements, and temptations, which
were indeed very many, so many that nothing but Gods assistance, and the
thought of my account to God could, as then the case was with me, have carried
me thorough the work. I said that I kn^w no reason, why Master Marshall should
conceive, that I had taken the pains to examine his Sermon for any ends cross
to the finding of Truth, I tell him plainly, my real mention in this work is
to discover Truth, and to do what is m^et for me in my calling, toward the
Reformation of these Churches, according to Gods word, ^^ts which we have both
bound our selves by solemn Covenant. These words should have acquitted me from
this charge of braving out of self confidence, if Master Marshall, or Master
Ley knew nothing to the contrary, as I am sure they did not, and I think they
have no prospective glass to look into my breast. And for the words Mr Marshall
says, smell a^lutle too rankely of challenging and difying a whole Host, had
he considered or recited the whole period, and not cut off my words in the
midst, he had seen that my words were not a braving challenge, but a fai^e
and most reasonable motion, to have some one Treatise framed by those that had
appeared in public, and whose writings or Sermons, I had endeavored to
answer, that I might know what they would stand to, and save my self the
labor and charge of buying and reading every indigested Pamphlet: And after I
made another motion, in case this was not liked, to have a meeting to consult
about a way of brotherly and peaceable ventilating this point. The rejecting of
both these motions by Master Marshall if they make him not inexcusable, yet I
presume make my preceedings excusable, and his so p^lpable a misconstruction of
my spirit in this matter, does strongly argue that he looked on my writing with
a ^loudshot eye, however he protest the contrary in his Epistle Dedicatory to
the Assembly. And I think he should not shoot very wide from the mark, that
should imagine that these exceptions against the Author, are for want of a
clear answer to the Book.

There is yet another charge against me that flies higher,. 8. Of the clearing
the Author o^ the two Treatises from Sophistry in them, whereby occasion is
taken to vindicate the Treatises in many of the chie^e things contained in them.
and comes ^earer to the matter, if it were true, and it is indeed (though they
do not call it so) the deceit of Sophistry in my writing, which if it were so,
were a damnable sin to pervert the Truth of God by such profane handling. But
let us consider what is said: Master Marshall Page 2. of his Defense, says
thus: wherein I shall not (as you have done) carpe at every phrase or
expression* nor digress into imp^rtinent discourses, thereby to swell up a
volume, nor amuse the Reader with multitudes of quotations of Latin and Greek
Authors, and then turn them into English; nor frame as many sense of an
expression as is possible, and then confute them, and so fight with men of
straw, of mine own set^ing up: nor spend a whole sheet of paper together, in
confuting what was never intended by my adversary, as the Reader shall clearly
perceive you have dealt with me.

In answer hereto, I say: The first charge is so rank, that unless he mean
by carp^^g something else then I conceive, to wit a wanton, unnecessary,
quarrelling, or excepting without cause, it is so palpable an untruth, that I
wonder he would let it fall from his (...) he wrote at adventure. I do
sometimes (and yet not so frequently as there was occasion) declare the
ambig^ity and unfitness of some expressions* but never without reason our of a
carping humor* much less carpe at every phrase or expression. And for the
second, it is true* I do make some digressions, and so did Doctor (...) White
in his (...) the (...) Church, Doctor Twiss^ (...) Arminiu^, but these
digressions I am (...) a real (...) pertinent, and necessary to a full
discussion of the argument in hand, (...) to (...) a volume, but to clear the
(...)* The third ch^^ge is as va^^e, for the quotations are not multitudes,
(...) so many as that praise worthy writer Master Gat^^er (...) of them (...)
not for amusing the Reader but for (...) speaks it of himself, and I there
through mistake of memory put [ Ar^es] for [ Orange] a City near it. And these
I thank Doctor Homes for advertising me of: and shall be willing to confess
any other oversights, that no reader may be deceived by me: though for the
present I know no other. Doctor Homes names some other, yet I conceive
wrongfully. As for the framing of as many senses of an expression as is
possible, and then confuting them, this I thought had been a virtue in
disputing to find out the many senses of an expression, and to confute them. I
ever took this good arguing* if the conclusion be true, then in this or that
sense, but in none of all these it is true, ergo it is not true* and that this
had not been fighting with men of straw, but fighting with the strongest enemy
that was in the field.

The last charge is, that I spend a whole sheet of paper in confuting what was
never intended by him:. 9. Of the meaning of Master Marshals second conclasion,
the words in the D^rect^ry. [the promise is made to Believers and their seed]
and the Doctrine therein delivered, disavowed by Mr Marshall and Mr. Geree.
be it so; yet if the Reader were likely to take it so, it was fit it should be
refuted, and himself blamed for speaking no plainer, but leading his Reader
and Answerer out of the way, by the ambiguity of his expression. But to examine
this charge more fully: He means I assure my self the refuting of this
conclusion Exam Part. 3. Sect. 4. from Page 48. to 54. (which comes short of a
whole sheet) That the Cov^nant (...) saving grace in Christ. expressed in Genesis
7. 7. in these words [I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed] is made to
believers and their natural ^eede. This says Master Marshall Page 116. of his
Defense was never asserted by him. For my part, though I conceived still that
Master Marshall would never stand to this assertion, and I acknowledged in
express terms, that sometimes* Master Marshall spoke mo^^ warily, yet I gave
many reasons why in his second conclusion his words were to be so taken, as if
he had asserted that, which Master Marshall neither has* nor I think can
clearly take off* nor did I herein fasten any thing upon him against (...) as
he (...) to suspect, Page 116. of his Defense, and Master Geree Page 13* of his
Vindiciae paedobaptisms. For the passage be brings out of my Book is not
contradictory, s^th I might suppose he held not all the Infants of Believers to
be actually* regenerate, and yet might suppose he held that the Covenant of
saving Gr^^^ was made to them all, since all the Elect persons have the Covenan^
made to them as the Apostle supposes, Romans 9. 8. and yet are not actually
regenerate. Besides Master Marshall in his answer to the fourth and fifth
objection, speaks as if he held the Covenant of Grace conditional* and so
might hold that all the children of Believers have the Covenant of saving Grace
made to them conditionally, though not absolutely. I will add what Doctor
Homes Page 1. 3. of his Animadversions tells me. Master T. kn^w learned Master
P. (I think he means Master William Pemble of Magdalen H^ll in Oxford, a
famous worthy writer, whose memory is very precious to me, in whose time Doctor
Homes, Master Geree and my self, lived together in that house to the benefit
of us all) who would say, can any mere man write much, and not in any thing
contradict himself? Why then should it be thought strange that I should
conceive Master Marshall would contradict that in one place, which he had
avouched elsewhere, especially since I find it frequent for Protestant Divines
in this very thing, to unsay in dispute against Arminians about perseverance,
what they avow in dispute against Anabaptists: sure I am Master Cottons words
which I examine in a digression, mean plainly the Covenant of saving Grace,
and therefore he interprets Genesis 17. 7. of the Covenant of saving Grace, and
Master Philips, that the Covenant is made to them because offered, and Master
Thomas Goodwin in his Lectures about Infant Baptism, meant it of the Covenant
of saving Grace and therefore limited it so, as that for the most part Election
did run through the loins of Believers, and Master Herle at Bow-Church for
Master Goodwin on Heb. 8. 10. took upon him to refute Anabaptists from thence,
because the Covenant there was made with the house of Judah, and Gal. 3. 14,
the blessing of Abraham was to come upon the Gentiles* and that was the
Covenant of saving Grace. And for my part, I know not how to construe those
words of the Directory, That the promise is made to Believers and their seed,
any otherwise then of the promise of saving Grace, which I conceived plain by
the expression following, make this baptism to the Infant a seal of adoption,
remission of sins, regeneration and eternal life, and of all other promises of
the Covenant of Grace. The Directory does in my apprehension plainly appoint
the begging for the child the accomplishment of the promise before asserted to
Believers and their seed, and therefore as in the petition it is meant of
saving Graces, so in the assertion, or else the words are so ambiguous, as they
may be a Cothurnus, which were more fit for a Canon of the Coun^s of Trent,
then for the Directory of a Protestant Church. Besides the same promise is said
to be made to Believers seed, which is made to Believers, but that they will
not d^ny to to be meant of the promise of saving Grace, therefore neither the
other. To this Master Marshall Page 116, 117. of his Defense answers thus* 1.
He leaves out the words which were for my purpose [ and of all other promises
of the Covenant of Grace] which is not right dealing: 2. He makes me to
conclude from that I cite out of the Directory, that if there be not a promise
of these saving graces to Infants, in vain are they baptized, and the seal* is
put to a blanke. And this consequence he denies, but says nothing to that
which was indeed my reason, which was this, Master Marshal's second conclusion
is to be understood as the words in the Directory, this Master Marshall grants,
but the words of the Directory speak of a promise of saving Grace. This I
prove, 1. Because the same promise is said to be made to the Believers seed,
which is made to Believers, for it were a strange equivocation to understand
the same term in the same proposition in two different senses, but the promise
made to Believers there meant, is the promise of saving Grace, ergo so is the
promise to their seed. 2. Because the words speak of the same promise before,
in the direction concerning Doctrine, which they mean after in the direction
for petition, else there would be a Cathurnus, which were absurd, but in the
petition they mean the promises of saving Grace, therefore also in the
Doctrine. As for that which Master Marshall makes my conclusion from the words
of the Directory, that in vain are they baptized, the Seal is put to a
blanke: It is no inference from the words of the Directory, but comes in in
another period, at least fourteen lines after, and among other reasons it is a
medi^m to prove that the second conclusion must be so understood, because that
is the plea they make for Infant Baptism, and therefore unless it be so
understood, they must revoke that plea. M. G^ree Page 13. (if I understand him
aright) makes this the sense of the Director^, the promise is made to Believers
and their seed, that is, it is to be presumed in charity of all the Infants of
Believers, that they enjoy the inward graces of the promise till they discover
the contrary. Wherein, though he grant that which I contend for, that in the
Directory the promise is meant of saving Grace, yet he has invented another
shift to save the credit of the assertion of Master Marshall and the Directory,
which he confesses, if it be taken as I conceive it is, is so manifestly
against Protestant principles and experience that none can hold it. But who
would ever construe those words, The promise is made to Believers and their
seed; that is, it is to be presumed in charity of all the Infams of Believers,
that they enjoy the inward graces of the promise, till they discover the
contrary, but he that would make men's words like a nose of wax, to turn them
which way he is willing they should be taken? would any man construe the words
[ (...) to Beleevers] any otherwise then thus, the promise of saving Grace is
made by God to Believers? and must the same phrase in the same proposition in
the other part be construed thus [ the promise is made to the seed of
Beleevers] that is, it is to be presumed by men in charity till they discover
the contrary, that all the Infants of Believers have the inward graces of the
Covenant. As if the making of a Covenant were all one with a charitable
presumption, or the seed of Believers were all one with Infants, or when they
are adulti they are not their seed. The Apostle Romans 9. 6, 7, 8. when he
expounded the promise, Genesis 17. 7. of the spiritual, not the natural seed,
did not imagine, that the making the promise was man's act of presumption, but
Gods act, and Acts 2. 39. (to which and Genesis 17. 7. it is likely the Directory
alludes) the promise* as Master Marshall expounds it, is of Christ and his
saving benefits, and the making of it is meant of Gods act, not man's
presumption. Add hereunto that the whole series of the direction in the
Directory carries the meaning thus. For having said, that Baptism is a Seal
of the Covenant of Grace, of our ingrafting into Christ, and of our union with
him, of remission of sins, regeneration, adoption, and life eternal, it
follows after, that the ^eed and posterity of the faithful borne within the
Church, have by their birth interest in the Covenant, and right to the Seal of
it, and to the outward privileges of the Church, etc. where the Directory
makes a threefold interest: First interest in the Covenant. Secondly, right to
the Seal of it. Thirdly, right to the outward privileges of the Church, the
Covenant, Seal, and outward Privileges of the Church are put as distinct
things, and the Covenant they have interest in, is the same Covenant of which
Baptism is a Seal, as is plain by the Pronoune [ it] which imports the same
thing: Now Baptism is before said to be the Seal of the Covenant of saving
Graces, therefore the Covenant that the seed of Believers have interest in by
their birth according to the Directory, is the Covenant of saving Graces. Which
since Master Marshall dares not assert, and Mr Geree says is manifestly against
Protestant principles, I wish it were as it ought to be laid to heart, and that
the Assembly would remember that which they say Page 30. of the answer to the
Remonstrance of the seven dissenting Brethren. And it was further declared,
that even in those things which the Assembly had voted, and transmitted to both
Houses of Parliament; yet we did not so lean to our own understandings, nor so
prize our v^tes; but that if these Brethren should hold forth such light unto
us as might convince us of an error: we should not only desire the Parliament
to give us leave to revise our votes, but to revoke them, if there should be
caus^. Which would indeed bring much honor to the Assembly, and knit the
hearts of the godly to them: whereas through their silence at this time, this
and some other things in the Directory about baptism passing uncorrected, and
standing confirmed by Law, great disquiet to the Church of God, and the undoing
or molesting of many godly persons, may follow when they cannot yield without
sin to the Doctrine and practice of Baptism as it is there set down.. 0. Of
the distinction of inward and outward Covenant, and that it can stand Master
Marshall in no stead, but to show his tr^f^ing, and equivocating in his first
argument, and two first conclusions, and of M. Marshal^ mistake of my opinion.
This by the way.

But Mr. Marshalls tells me page 1^0. of his Defense, you cannot be ignorant
how our Divines own the outward administration of the Covenant under the
notion of Foedus externum and the spiritual grace of it under the notion of
Foedus internum: and that still I restrain the Covenant to the spiritual part
only; and would persuade my reader, that they who speak of the Covenant of
Grace, must mean it thus strictly; and yet I bring not arguments to disprove a
true visible membership upon a visible profession, whether the inward saving
grace be known or not. To this I answer. I confess I have met with that
distinction of foedus externum and internum, in some Protestant writers, but
not meeting with it in Mr Marshals Sermon, I had no occasion in my E^a^en to
meddle with it but now I will declare my thoughts of it. I confess that
Circumcision is called the Covenant, Genesis 1^ 13* by a me^onymy of the thing
signified for the sign, as the text it self expounds it; and I confess that
the Apostle Romans 2. 28. distinguishes of Circumcision outward in the flesh,
and circumcision of the heart: but no where in Scripture do I meet with the
distinction of the outward and inward Covenant, nor do I conceive the
expression right. For if the distinction be only distinctio nominis, it should
be thus, Covenant is taken either properly or improperly by a trope, and not
Covenant is either outward or inward, if the distinction be distinctio rei:
then there is some common notion of a Covenant thus distributed, and so the
sense must be; some Covenants, that is, promises (for the nature of a Covenant
is a mutual or single promise) are either external or internal, and this may
be understood either in respect of the making of the promise, and so it is not
right for all promises in that sense are external, none internal for before it
be declared by some transeunt act it is not a promise, but an intention or else
it may be understood in respect of the thing promised, and it is confessed that
God promises inward, and outward good things, and if this were the meaning I
should not much except against it, though I should like it better to express
it thus. The things covenanted are outward or inward, which is plain and easy
to be understood, then to say, the Covenant is outward, or inward. But Mr
Marshall by the outward Covenant means the outward administration of it, and by
the inward Covenant the spiritual grace of it. According to which explication
the distinction is not agreeable to Logic rules, nor can stand Mr Marshall in
any stead, but to convince him of trifling and equivocating in his first
argument, and two first conclusions. Trifling I say in his first argument. For
the first argument was this. The infants of believing parents are foederati,
therefore they must be signati. Now Mr Marshall will not have the antecedent
understood of the inward Covenant, that is the spiritual grace; he blames me
for that, and he himself rejects it in that sense; then the sense must be, the
infants of believing parents are foederat^, that is in the outward Covenant of
Grace, that is according to Mr Marshall in the outward administration of the
Covenant. Now what is the outward administration he expresses page 48. of his
Sermon, calling Baptism the new administration, and Circumcision the old. This
then is Mr Marshals argument. The infants of believers are in the outward
Covenant, that is, in the outward administration, meaning Baptism or
Circumcision; this is the antecedent, the consequent or conclusion is,
therefore they must be signati; that is, baptized or circumcised. But is not
this a mere inept tautology; all one as to prove they must bebaptized, because
they must be baptized; all one as to argue, he must have ensem, because he must
have gladium; this is Paul's Epistle, because this is Paul's letter. I said
equivocating. For by the Covenant Mr Marshall makes show of one thing in the
first conclusion, but means another in the second. For he had said conclusion
the first, The Covenant of Grace for substance has been always the same, and
page 10. he shows wherein lies the substance of it; to wit, the spiritual
part; now who would not have expected that the second conclusion should be
meant of the same Covenant to wit the inward; since he says, page 26. The
proving the two first conclusions gains the whole cause, if the Covenant be the
same, and children belong to it, then they are to be owned as Covenanters? yea,
and his first text to prove the second conclusion, Acts 2. 39. he himself
expounds it of Christ and saving benefits by him. But it seems Mr Marshal's
heart fails him, he found that assertion too hot for him, though that be the
ordinary assertion, in the Directory, in books and Sermons, insomuch that it is
an usual expression to say infants are confederates with their believing
parents in the Covenant of Grace; and therefore now, the second conclusion,
that the children of believers belong to the Covenant of Grace, must be
understood in another sense then as the Covenant of Grace is taken in the first
conclusion, which is to equivocate. Yea further by reading Mr Marshalls
defense, page 92. and elsewhere I suspect there is a farther equivocation in Mr
Marshalls argument, which Mr Marshall it seems does not perceive, diverse
expressions being by him taken as the same, which are not the same; nor to be
confounded. For, page 92. Mr Marshall speaks thus; I concluded therefore that
by Gods own will, such as enter into Covenant ought to receive the seal, which
seems to be the Proposition by which the sequel of Mr Marshalls first argument
is to be proved, so that he seems to frame the Syllogism entirely thus. They
that enter into Covenant ought to receive the seal, but the children of
believers enter into Covenant, therefore they ought to receive the seal; so
that the minor seems to him to be all one with this Proposition: the children
are foederati, which is elsewhere expounded of the outward Covenant, or the
right to be baptized, but to have right to be baptized, is not all one with
entering into Covenant. Entering into Covenant is some act farther then having of
right; for a person may have right to Baptism before he enters into Covenant.
Mr Marshall should have heedfully distinguished the Covenant of Grace, which is
Gods act in his promise of grace; and belongs to none but those he has made
that promise to, and the outward administration, which is the administratours
act; and not have called it the Covenant, and the entering into Covenant with
God, which is the act of the baptized, and cannot be done ordinarily by an
infant, who is only passive, and makes no promise at Baptism; and therefore
cannot be rightly said to enter into Covenant with God. The want of such
distinctnesse in expression serves for no other purpose but to puzzle a reader,
and the very truth is, the argument which Mr Marshall, Mr Geree, Doctor Homes,
etc. bring from the Covenant to the Seal for the baptizing Infants, if it be
well sifted, is either a Tautology, or an equivocation; as I may more
abundantly show, if ever I have liberty to examine their entangled discour^es.
Now from hence he may know the reason why I still rest^aine the Covenant to the
spiritual part only, which is, because I love to speak plainly without
equivocation, and as the Scripture does, and why I would persuade the Reader,
that they who speak of the Covenant of Grace must meant it thus strictly,
because I would have it thought they do not equivocate, but speak plainly. And
for bringing arguments to disprove a true visible membership upon a visible
profession, whether the inward grace be known or not, I marvel Master Marshall
should expect this of me, who never denied a true visible membership upon a
visible profession, whether the inward Grace be known or not, but in express
terms granted it; and therefore Master Marshall does untruely charge me, when
he says Page 112. This mistake runs through your whole book, that none are to
be repu^^^ to have a visible right to the Covenant of Grace, but only such as
partake of the saving Graces of it. And yet Mr Marshall acknowledges Page 2^3.
of his Defense the contrary, when he says, to all this you assent, and
consequently that there is nothing needful according to the Word, but a
visible right. But Master Marshall adds; and then what will become of all your
pleading, That because we cannot know that all Infants of Believers have the
inward Grace, we may not therefore baptize them. This Master Marshall makes all
my pleading, but Master Marshall neither does nor can show that this is all or
any part of my pleading. Master Marshall Page 222. has these words: And as for
that you add, That Baptism is to be administered, not to them who may have
Grace, but to them who have it. Then it seems they are all wrongly baptized
who have not inward grace. But how does this follow from my words, with any
show of right deduction? That because I say, it is not enough that Baptism be
administered to persons, in that they may have Grace, but it is to be
administered to them that have it, that therefore it seems they are all wrongly
baptized who have not inward Grace, unless my speech had been, that it is to
be administered to none but them that have it, which cannot be drawn from my
words, till it be proved that every affirmative proposition is exclusive, which
true Logic will disclaim. He that says, A Coat is not a man's because he may
buy it, but because he has bought it* does not affirm that he only has a
Coat by right that has bought it, for he may have right to it another way,
viz. by legacy My pleading is, because we have no command, we cannot baptize
Infants without will worship according to ordinary rule, since the command is
only to baptize Disciples, or such as profess faith. I grant that if any be a
real actual Believer that cannot speak, yet if he profess the Faith by
other signs, or God do reveal it for him he may be baptized by the force of
Philips rule, Acts 8 38. and Peter's speech, Acts 10 47. But he that says,
real actual Believers may be baptized, does not thereby affirm that they
only are to be baptized. A proprio primo modo ad proprium secundo modo non
valet argumentum. All Crows are black, therefore only Crows are black, is no
good argument. Master Marshall tells me Page 95. that he is confident, that I who
durst baptize an Infant known to be regenerate, durst not give the other
Sacrament to it; because more is required to make them capable of that
Sacrament, then is required to make them capable of Baptism: a regenerate
Infant I thin^ is capable of thus: but besides regeneration, he is sure I will
grant, that an examination of a m^ns self, and an ability to discern the
Lords Body, is required to (...) capable of that. To put him out of doubt, I
say; upon the same supposition that God should regenerate, and make an infant
an actual believer I should as soon give the Lords supper as baptism to it,
as conceiving that the same actual faith that makes capable of the one makes
capable of the other, and the same supernatural extraordinary power that
begets actual faith can beget self examination and discerning the Lords body.
And thus I have answered that accusation of spending a whole sheet of paper
together in confuting what was never intended by my adversary, and have
retorted this point of sophistry as more justly chargeable on himself.

But Mr Marshall has yet more of sophistry to charge me with, 11. Of Master
Marshal^ false and most unjust charge that I carry the Socinian plot through my
examen and exercitation.
and thus he speaks page 3. of his defense. But first give me leave to observe
your destructive artifice. It is the Socinians way to clude all texts of
Scripture, which are urged against them, if they have been differently
expounded by learned and godly men, ancient or modern: to question all
conclusions inferred by consequence from Scriptu^e: to deride the testimonies of
any of the Ancients by discovering the nakedness, error, and oversight of
those reverend men: and by making themselves merry by turning the Orations,
Epistles, or allusions of the Fathers into syllogismes, and by inserting of
ergo now and then, to make all their rhetorical passages seem ridiculous. I
appeal to the judicious reader, whither this plot be not carried through your
Examen and exercitation.

It is a very sad thing that brethren should thus yield either to their
passion, or zeal of God but not according to knowledge* so as to paint out
their opponents in as ougly a form as they can without cause. Mr Marshall
appeals to the judisious reader, and I am very willing to accept of the
appeal, provided that under the term, Judicious reader, he do not mean one
that is resolved to gainsay whatsoever is contrary to the stream of other
reformed Churches* or the present Synod, or that may endanger his present
station, or carried away with prejudice, and passion. He desires le^ve to
observe my destructive artifice. If he mean my skill to overthrow his
arguments I confess it, it was my business, if he means something else when
he names it he may have an answer. He tells me what the Socinians way is, and
would have it thought that is my way. For the Socinians way, I have read Mr
Cheyuels discourse, but remember not that their way is described as Mr Marshall
sets it down. I have read very little either in Socinus, or any Socin^^n. In
that which I have read I confess I find much shifting and impudence in
eluding the scriptures urged against them, Christ^^nus Bermanus Ex^rcit.
Theolog. 20. has collected 38 examples hereof. I find that they make little
account of the testimonies of the Ancients, since the first Nicene Council in
the point of Christ's Deity, yet they allege those before the Nicene Council in
that point, and sometimes others of the Ancients. But it is more easy for Mr
Marshall to affirm then to prove any such So^man plot in my Examen or
exercitation, though Mr Marshall could not but know, that an adversary could
hardly show more malice, and do more mischief to a man then by bringing him
into suspicion as if he were of a Socinian spirit. He says, it is the Socinian
way to ^lude all Texts of scripture which are urged against them if they have
been differently expounded by learned and godly men, ancient or modern. The
truth is, though Socinians do use this art, yet their proper devise is, so
far as I have observed, to elude by new interpretations of their own. But
what one Text have I eluded in an, such manner? If there be any, it is either 1
Cor. 7. 14. or Coloss. 2* 11, 12. I or the first, though it is true I allege
eleven Authors expounding as I do, and might make a further addition, and there
was great reason I should do it, because of the prejudice that was against my
interpretation, yet that was not it which I rested upon, but the Analysis of
the words, which being rightly stated, I found upon reason, to which neither Mr
Marshall nor Mr Geree have yet answered, that the sense I gave must needs be
right. And it was confessed to me by a learned man of the Assembly, that he
thought matrimonial Holiness was not all that was meant there, yet that I had
sufficiently overthrown that of federal Holiness* Mr Marshall though he have
altered my method and form in clearing that text, and so obscured my
elucidations of it, yet could find eight arguments there against his opinion.
And for the other text it has been showed before that Mr Marshall confesses
my sense to be his sense. The truth is, my expositions of texts are in most of
them so (...) that Mr Marshal himself does grant them, though he differ from
me in the inferences from them. He says further, it is the Socinians way to
question all conclusions inf^rred by consequence from Scripture. This is the
first time that ever I heard them to be charged with this* but rather find
them by Mr Cheynel and others charged with assenting to nothing but what they
could conceive rational. I remember Docter Chalo^er in his Credo Ecclesiam
Catholicam mentions this as the artifice of the Jesuits in France to stop the
mouths of Protestants by rejecting consequences, and requiring express texts,
which being invented by Veron* was called methodus V^roniana, the vanity of
which is refuted by Vedelins in a treatise of his. I remember I saw a printed
paper taken as it is said from the mouth of Captain Paul Hobson against Infant
baptism, wherein was somewhat spoken against consequences, which I disclaim.
Yea, I expressly say page 110. of my Ex^men, But I grant, that if you make it
good, by good consequence, you may recover all. I confess I do reject the
consequence drawn from the command of Circumcision to baptism by reason of
analogy, and all such anologies as being vain yet too much postering (...),
and former writings and Sermons. It is the speech of Mr Rutherf^rd, due right
of Presbyteries, Chapter 2. sect. 2. page 37. proportions are weak probations. But
it is an overlashing to purpose in Mr Marshal to say, that I carry this
Socinian plot through my examen and exercitation to question all conclusions
inferred by consequence from Scripture. Though Mr Marshal in this matter
appears not to be the man I took him to be, yet I hope he is not come to
Calumn^are ^^d^cter. I presume the Judicious reader will judge, that Mr Marshal
is bound to give me satisfaction for wronging my credit, of which he should be
more tender, by so deep, and yet so palpable a false accusation. Mr Marshal
makes this the Socinian way to deride the testimonies of the Ancients. Of what
they do I can say little. But I challenge Mr Marshall to give one instance
wherein I make my self merely by turning the orations, epistles, or allusions
of the Fathers into syllogismes, and by inferting of ergo now and then to make
all their rhet^ricall passages seem ridiculous. As for derid^^g the testimonies
of any of the Ancients by discovering the ^akednesse, etc. I do it no otherwise
then the most approved Protestant writers Rivet, Perkins, Cook, Jannes,
Century-writers* Chamire, Jewel, Reynolds, etc. yea and many of the Papists
themselves, Sixtus S^^^sis, Bellarmine, etc. who usually disclaim some
writings of the Ancients as spurious, and many speeches of the most approved as
absurd and erroneous: yea, Mr Marshall himself in the points of infant
Communion, rebaptization, necessity of Baptism and Communion in his Defense,
derides Cyprian and Augustine as much as I do in my Examen in the point of
Infant Baptism. Mr Marshall says my ma^ne faculty lies in the anascenasticall
part, but that I bring not satisfying arguments to settle men in that I would
have. But Mr Marshall might remember my business in my exercitation, and
Examen is to discover the nullity of the pleas that are made for
Infant Baptism, in which if I had done no more but overthrown the proofs
that are brought out of Scripture, it had been enough. Whereas I have further
showed upon erroneous grounds it was taught of old, and what abuses have
followed it: which surely Smect^mnuus, and Dawlphintramis in their pleading
against Ep^sc^pacy and Liturgy thought sufficient; however in this point Mr
Marshall censures my exercitation and examen as insufficient. When Smectymnuus
had disputed down Episcopacy and Liturgy, they conceived they had done their
part, though they referred it to the Synod to consult how to setle Church
Government and worship. And why should not my disputing be thought edifying to
the Church of God by overthrowing an error and abuse, which will in time be
found worse then Episcopacy and Liturgy, though I take not upon me to direct
how Baptism is to be reduced to the right way, nevertheless when I am duly
required to declare my opinion either about the nullity of Poedobaptisme as it
is used, or the way of reducing Baptism to its right use, whether according to
conscience or prudence which I doubt not but may be done in time without
necessity of separation, turning seekers, or popular tumult, though for the
present generation by reason of preingage-ments, men's spirits are very averse
from it,) I shall be willing to do it, as being resolved; notwithstanding the
unkind usage I have found, yet to remember my Covenant and account to God. And
as I have not hitherto, so neither I hope in God ever shall foster any
Crypticall Divinity, of which I need be ashamed to bring it into light, or
which should justly cause men to be jealous of me as a dangerous person likely
to trouble the Church, though unbrother-like Mr Marshall page 76. endeavors to
represent me as if I were one that had need to be watched. He talks not in a
letter to me in private, but in print, of my high and scornful spirit, but how
justly may appear by this Apology. He tells me, I magisterially tread down
under foot the arguments and reasons which others conceive strong. But it will
be hard for Mr Marshall to show where I tread down any thing magisterially,
that is without cogent reasons; and such, as were it not for his mistakes of my
reasons, he himself would be forced to subscribe to them.

As for questioning so boldly some Doctrines which have never been q^^stioned
before,. 12. Of M. Marshals unjust charge of me as itching after new opinions,
and particularly about rebaptization and receiving the Lords Supper before
Baptism.
I suppose he means it of that which I said Page 23. of my Examen about
rebaptization, which Master Marshall says does clearly discover my itch after
new opinions, Page 67. of his Defense, and that which I say Page 85. of my
Examen, concerning the question, whether an unbaptized person may in no case
ea^^ the Lords Supper, this Master Marshall Page 167. of his Defense, numbers
amongst my freakes and out-leapes, and says is a spice of my itch after
singular opinions. But Master Marshall might have observed, that in the former,
I gave the reason of what I said, because it goes so curr^n, that rebaptization
is not only an error, but also an Heresy; plainly showing there was a
necessity that cried out against the Anabaptists as Heretics, to bring a
demonstrative reason to prove it unlawful to baptize again him that had been
rightly baptized. For I presume, hat as King James censured Cardinal Peron for
making a kind of problematicall Martyrs, calling them Martyrs that dyed in
maintenance of a point not certain whether it were de ^ide, so it is as absurd
for our Preachers to make problematicall Heretics, by declaiming and exciting
the Magistrate against those as Heretics, of whom it is uncertain whether
they hold an error or no. As for Master Marshals reasons, they are not
convincing to me, nor is the holding rebaptization such a new opinion as he
would make it. And for the other it is no out-leape, but a question that lay in
my way by reason of Master Marshals words, and exceeding necessary to be
resolved, considering that otherwise those Ministers and people that cannot
agree about the validity of Infant Baptism, or adult-baptisme, supposed not to
be rightly done, for want of a right Ministry, or power to give the Spirit, or
the manner of it is administration, must of necessity separate from Communion in
the Lords Supper for this reason, because none is to be admitted to the Lords
Supper till he be rightly baptized: which I profess is to be stood upon in
point of prudence for right order; yet if it be stood upon in point of
conscience, so as in no case the contrary is to be permitted, it will of
necessity make many superstitious perplexities in Ministers, and infer many
an unnecessary Schism, this being not a sufficient reason for a refusal of
Communion, because a Godly person takes his baptism to be right, though I know
the contrary. Nor do I think the thing either such a new opinion or practice.
For besides, that it may be doubted whether all the Apostles were baptized, as
suppose Matthew (which is as probable for the negative as the affirmative) yet
were admitted to the Lords Supper by Christ himself: when Constantine the
Great and others did differ their baptism so long, it is not likely they
never received the Lords Supper before their baptism. Nor is it inconsistent
with my grants: For what though I grant that Baptism is the way and manner of
solemn admission into the Church, meaning the regular way, yet it follows not
that none may receive in any case before baptized. Mr Marshall holds
Ordinatination by a Presbytery is the regular way of solemn admission into the
office of public Preaching, and it may be fit by an Ecclesiastical Canon to
order it so; yet I think it will not be denied, but that there may be cases,
wherein a person may lawfully be a public Preacher without such ordination.
The other grant which Master Marshall says is mine, was never expressed by me
so rawly as he lays it down. It is not as he puts it down, that nothing is
to be dove about the Sacraments, whereof we have not either institution or
example: but as Master Marshall might have perceived if he had heeded my words,
Examen, Page 28. Page 110. Page 152. That no positive worship, or essential,
or substantial part of it, is to be done without institution by precept, or
Apostolical example, I never denied, that many things pertaining to
circumstance and order may be done about the Sacraments without either, and of
this kind I conceive Baptizing before eating the Lords Supper to be. As for itch
after new opinions, why are not Doctor Twisse, and Master Gataker, and indeed
all that clear truth more fully then others, censured in the like manner? I
wish if my words would take any impression on him, that Master Marshall would
forbear thus judging least he be judged. I think I know my self better then
Master Marshall, and I told him, my real intention was to discover truth, yea
all my ways show me free from this itch after new opinions, though I profess
my self an impartial searcher of truth, ^^llius addictu^ jurare in verba
^agistri, no not to the determinations of the Assembly. May it not with better
reason be said, they have an itch after new opinions, who hold that without
power to suspend all scandalous persons from the Lords Supper, a man cannot
with a good conscience be a Pastor, that without this power the Church of
Christ is to be suspended from the Lords Supper many years, etc. And for
fleighting of authors, I have answered it already.

There is yet another Charge, as if I should allege Authors against their
mind.. 13. Of alleging Authors against their mind, particular Mr Daniel
Rogers, M. B^ll, Chamter, Aretius, and Beza.
As first Master Daniel Rogers. I said Master Daniel Rogers in his Treatise of
the Sacrament of Baptism, Part. 1. Page 79. confessed himself unconvinced by
demonstration of Scripture for it. Master Marshall writes to Master Daniel
Rogers, he answers in these words: If I were to answer that Anabaptist, I
should answer (...) silen^io, and contemptu: for why should I not? since in
that very place of my Sacrament, Part. 1. Page 78. 79. where I confute thos^
Schosmaticks, he (...) my words from their own Defense: My words are, I
confess my self unconvinced by any demonstration of Scripture for
^^^dabaptisme, meaning by any positive Text; what is that to help him? except
I thought there were no other arguments to ^vince it: now what I think of
that, my next words show, Page 77. line 4, 5, 6, 7. I need (...) transcribe
them. In a word, this I say, though I know (...), yet that is no argument for
the non-baptizing of Infants, since so many Scriptures are sufficiently
convincing for it. Therefore this want of a (...) Text must no more exclude
Infants, etc. then the like reason should disa^ull a Christian Sabbath, or
women kind not to be partakers of the Supper: The quoting of mine own text
were enough. I will set down his words as I find them, that the Reader may
judge whether there be truth in it, that I have snatched his word^ from their
own Defense, and whether he did not oppose demonstration of Scripture to
^^^ritt^n tradition. The words are thus: I say this for the settling of such as
are not wilful, that (...) take the baptism of Infants to be one of the most
reverend, general and uncontrouled traditions which the Church ha^h, and which
I would no loss doubt of then the Creed to be Apostolical. And although I
confess my self yet unconvinced by demonstration of Scripture for it, yet
first sithence Circumcision was applied to the Infants the eighth day in the
Old Testament: Secondly there is no words in the New Testament to infringe the
liberty of the Church in it, nor special reason why we should bereave her of
it. Thirdly, sundry Scriptures afford some friendly proofs by consequent of
it. Fourthly, the holiness of the child (external and visible) is from their
parents, who are (or ought to be) chatechised confessors, penitents, and
Protestants in truth (which privilege only open revolt disables them from)
therefore I say, the Seed being holy, and belonging to the Covenant, the Lord
graciously admits them also to the Seal of it in Baptism. 1 Cor. 7. 14.
If Master Marshall please he may write back to his reverend and learned
friend, that the supposed Anabaptist thinks his plaster too narrow for the
sore, that he seems to eat his own words, that his words help me to show that
he once thought it indeed one of the most reverend, general, and uncontroled
traditions which the Church has, and which he would no less doubt of, then
the Creed to be Apostolical, which if he mean it of the Creed called the
Apostles as it is now, Parker in his book de descensu ad inferos, and others
have showed to have been made long after the Apostles days, and the tale of
their meeting to compose it, in the exposition on the Creed, attributed to
Ruffinus, or some other to be of no credit. And for Scripture, Master Rogers
finds but friendly proofs, somewhat like Bellarm^nes pie and probabiliter
credi potest, and that there is no word in the New Testament to infringe the
liberty of the Church in it: which if Master Rogers can satisfy himself with,
he may, I profess I dare not so play with my own conscience, and I thought
this was fit to be told Master Marshall, to show that I was not the only man
that questioned, whether his proofs for Infant Baptism were so undeniable as
he would have them; and that is enough to show the unreasonablenes of the
violence of his spirit against those that differ from him. And for his Quaere
why he should not answer me, silentio and contemptu: I presume Master Marshall
has long since done that office of a friend to tell him it is written Romans 14.
10. Why do thou set at at naught thy brother?

I had said not as Mr Marshall repeats it, Master Ba^l cuts the sinews of the
argument from Circumcision, but, me thinks Mr Balls words cut the sinews of
that argument. And so they do plainly. For if however Circumcision and Baptism
agree or differ we must look to the institution, and the agreement is not
enough to conclude, that Baptism belongs only to members in Church Covenant,
and their children, because it was so in Circumcision without an institution,
as the new England Elders reason, by the same reason however Baptism and
Circumcision agree or differ: yet Baptism will not belong to Infants, because
Circumcision did so by virtue of proportion, without an institution, which if
Mr Ball or Mr Marshall could show, they needed not trouble us with the Command
about Circumcision of male infants, to prove Infant Baptism, which is indeed
to maintain that the ceremonial saw still binds, which is plain Judaisme. But
what says Mr Marshall to this? If Mr Marshall cut the sinews of the argument
from Circumcision to Baptism, himself was very much mistaken in his his own
meaning and intention, because in the same place he makes them parallel in
this, and I might have done well to have informed the reader so much. I was
told, there was a very intelligent man that said he was sorry that I had Mr
Marshall for my Antagonist, as knowing him to be apt to mistake, which he
conceived would be a vexation to me, and indeed I find his words true. For
whereas I said only Mr Ball's words, cut the sinews of that argument; M. Mar.
mistakes it as if I had said, Mr Ball intends to cut the sinews of that
argument, and that then he was mistaken in his own meaning and intentions. I
confess it were a very strange thing to charge so understanding a man as Mr
Ball with such a mistake of his own meaning and intention: but it is no such
strange thing for a learned man to speak that which may be brought to infer
the contrary to that he intended, and if this be to abuse men, then all
arguments by retortion are abuses. Bellarmin l. 5 de justificatione c. 7 prop.
3. had said, propter incertitudinem propria justitiae and periculum inanis
gloriae tutissimum est totam fiduciam in sola Dei misericordiae and benignitate
repouere. This King James in his Apology for the oath of Allegiance brings to
prove that he overthrowes thereby all his former dispute about inherent
righteousness, though Bellarmine had put in a special caution in the next
words to prevent that inference, and King James left out that caution in the
recital, yet Bishop Andrews in his Torturae Torti, and many other learned men
justified King James, and that rightly.

Mr Marshall, page, 147. says thus. And I am sure you must agree with me.
Sixthly, that of all these testimonies you have cited out of Chamier, there is
not one word against my interpretation, or for the justification of yours; yea
and I kn^w also that you will agree with me Seventhly that the learned Chamier
in a large dispute does confute your interpretation and vindicate my
interpretation, as the only true and proper meaning of this text even in that
very pla^e, where you quote him. And therefore I know the reader will agree
with me (whether you do cr^^) that you do but abuse your Author and Reader
both, in making a flourish with Chamiers name nothing to the purpose, and
thereby would m^ke the Reader to conceive Chamier to be of your side, when he
is point-blanke against you. And in the same page. First you several times
(...) the learned Beza as if he were of your m^nd in the interpretation of this
text, to construe it of matrimonial holiness. I confess the cause depends
not upon Beza's judgment, but your reputation depends much upon ^^king this
good, that you should dare to (...) Author as interpreting it for you, who
interprets it exprofesso against you. p. 159. I persuade my self you are by
this time ashamed of your impertinent quotation, I assure my self if you be
not, your friends are p. 157. But Sir why do you thus frequently abuse your
Readers with the names of learned men, inserting some one sentence of theirs
into your book, and thereby insinuating to your Reader, the they are of your
opinion in the point wherein you cite them? I assure you, it concerns your
conscience as well as your cause, to be thus often taken tardy. Mr Geree
vindic. Poedobaptism. page 22. which you express in Beza's words, but against
Beza's mind. page 28. And therefore I wonder you should so of (...) alle^ge an
Author impertinently especially such an one as is punctually and (...) against
you. To all this I answer. If Mr Marshall could have showed that I had either
falsified the words or wrested their meaning, he had said something: but to
tell me, because I allege the words of authors according to their meaning, to
prove the contrary to that they ho^d, therefore I ab^^se them; and inf^^ (...)
^o the Reader that they art of my mind, or side, when they are point blanke
against me, or that my allegation is ^^pertinent (...) is so frivolous a
charge, that it deserves no other answer, then Mr. (...) own words out of
Horace, page 294. (...) ashamed of my impertinent quotation^, it is because Mr
Marshall and Mr Geree have misrepresented them, otherwise those my quotations
are every one of them pertinent to the particular point I allege them for, and
not yet answered by Mr Geree or Mr Marshall. And I confess I cannot but smile
at Mr Marshalls conceit of me, when he says. And I am sure you must agree with
me. Sixthly, that (...) all these testimonies you have cited out of Chamier,
there is not one word against my interpretation or for the justification of
yours; as if I were another Claudi^ to subscribe to my own condemnation: which
if I do in this thing, he may well beg me for a fool. It is untruly ascribed
to me that I cite Beza, as if he were of my mind in the interpretation of 1
Cor. 7. 14. to construe it of matrimonial holiness. For whereas I did
distinctly explain first the term sanctified in the forepart of the verse and
then the terms unclean and holy in the later (which M. Marshall confounding in
his defense; and to putting all my arguments together to the number of eight,
as he multiplies them, and not sorting them as I did, has made his answers
colorable, but indeed misleads the unwary Reader) and though I knew Beza to
disagree from me in expounding the term [ holy] which I had expressly set
down, page 16. of my exercitation; and therefore never intended to abuse the
Reader, or to insinuate that he was of my side, in the expounding the latter
part of the verse, yet he expounds the first part with me of matrimonial
sanctification, and so I said, page 73 57, of my Examen, not that Beza did
construe it of matrimonial holiness, but matrimonial sanctification; which I
should wonder Mr Marshall did not consider being so plainly and necessarily
distinguished by me, but that distemper of body or mind, or have to prevent the
studying of my book by crying it down (the like whereto may be said of Doctor
Homes and Mr Geree) made him compose his answer a^ore he had well studied my
book. As for Chamier I did, page ^6. expressly say his opinion was for
federall holiness. Do federal^ illa sanctitate quid decom^verit (...) mentem
Chemiro Calvino, etc. and yet I need not be ashamed to bring his own words
against his own tenet, no more then King James to bring Bellarmines words
against him, or Bishop Morton to bring the Bapists words against them, or Mr
Marshall himself to bring my words against me, but rather indeed it is most
commendable to bring an authors words to refute his own opinion as being a most
cogent and pertinent way of disputing. And for Aretius page 92. of my Examen, I
used this very expression [ says rightly in this] intimating that though he
agree with M. Marshall in his inference from Col. 2. 11. 12. yet those words
which I cited, and that rightly, served to overthrow Mr Marshall's reason, from
whence their inference is gathered. And therefore it concerns Mr Marshall's
conscience as well as his cause to be thus often taken tardy in false
accusations, and insinuations against me. As for that he tells me of Aretius
his opinion there and elsewhere, it is indeed a mere impertinency; since I never
denied Aretius to be of his opinion, and therefore if I may use his own phrase,
page 147. he does but bumbast his book to no purpose.

And here I cannot but take notice,. 14. Of Master Marshal's unjust charging
Anabaptists, with a bloody sentence, concondemning all the Infants of believers
as having nothing to do with the Covevenant of Grace; his imputing to me as if
I held that they all belong actually to the kingdom of the Devil, no more
promise for them then for children of Turks, their actual standing in the
visible kingdom of the Devil.
that whereas Master Marshall had charged in the first use of his Sermon the
Anabaptists with a rash and bloody sentence condemning all the infants of the
whole Church of Christ, as having nothing to do with the Covenant of Grace or
the seal of it, and then aggravates it as like Hazaels act, I said, page 170.
of my Examen, till you produce some testimonies of those you call Anabaptists
so determining, I shall take it to be but a false accusation, and a fruit of
passion, not of holy zeal. Mr Marshall both page 5. and page 243. of his
Defense, says thus. I compared not their intentions with his, but the fruits
of their principles casting all believers children, as much out of the covenant
of Grace as they do the children of Turks and Pagans; and this I am sure they
do, and your self join with them who acknowledge no more promise for the
children of believers, then for the child^en of the Turks, and leave them to
have their actual standing in the visible kingdom of the Devil.

In this reply Mr Marshall brings no testimony out of the Anabaptists writings
to prove them guilty of that rash, and bloody sentence he does in express
terms charge them with; suppose Mr Marshall should be able (which I am assured
he cannot do) to prove by consequence that by their principles, they condemn
all the infants of the whole Church of Christ, as having nothing to do with
the Covenant of Grace, or the Seal of it (which were the words of his Sermon
page 52. though in his defense he alter the words to mince the matter) yet
Davenan^^ exhorts to brotherly communion, Chapter 12. Gataker vindication against
Walker, and many other cry out against it as most unreasonable to accuse men of
that sentence which themselves disclaim, because it follows from their
principles by remote consequence, much more in downright terms to say, they
pass a bloody sentence, and condemn all the infants of believers. If it should
follow from their principles, yet M. Marshall were not acquitted from rashness,
false accusation and passion in those his speeches. I have proved from Mr
Marshall's principle, page 35. of his Sermon that all Gods commands and
institutions about the Sacraments of the Jews bind us as well as they did them
in all things which belong to the substance of the Covenant, and were not
accident all to them, that it inferres an obligation to all the Mosaicall
ceremonies, and consequently Judaisme; yet Mr Marshall would not think it
equal I should charge him with Judaisme, and then make a declamation against
him as turned Jew, and preaching Judaisme, and to be abandoned by Christians as
going about to make them Jews. Why then does Mr Marshall deal so with others?
I know Mr. Marshall page 198. of his defense, endeavors to justify his
principle: he tells me, that his meaning never was to assert the practice of
the rituall part in the least particle, but that there is a general nature,
end and use in which they are agree; which is to answer just nothing. For the
question was concerning the commands of the Jews whither they bind, and
particularly whither the command of circumcising infants bind us virtually; now
all the commands are about the practice of the rituals, and if they bind they
are still in force: the general nature is contained in the definition, which
is aeternae v^ritatis, and expressed in an enunciation, and is not commanded
but declared, and so is the general end and use to be known and believed, not
to be practiced: but commands are orationes non enunciativ^, never of the
general nature, but of particular acts. Who did ever talk of a command that a
man should be animal rationale, or of a Sacrament that it should be a Seal of
the Covenant? 2. Mr. Marshall tells us he did not compare the Anabaptists and
Hazaels intentions, but the fruit of their principles. The truth is, Mr
Marshall did not compare their intentions, nor the fruit of their principles,
with Hazaels act; but their bloud^ sentence with his act. As for ^^sting out of
the Covenant of Grace, indeed and before God, no promise or error of ours can
do it, were our intentions never so malicious, the malice of men cannot
nullify the faith of God. As for casting out in their sentence, I conceive it
suspends any judgment of them; we can neither say they are in or out: yea, I
say again if all be examined, Mr Marshall puts them as much out as we, unless
Mr Marshall understand no more by the Covenant of Grace then Baptism, which
though Mr Marshall may do in a popular auditory, which cannot discern between
chalk and cheese, yet me thinks he should forbear to do it in print, in a
treatise dedicated to the Assembly of Divines. But I wonder the less at Mr
Marshalls rashness in accusing the Anabaptists, when he is not ashamed to tell
me thus, page 238 of his defense. It is your judgment that all infants, even
of believers as well as Pagans, though they may potentially belong to the
Kingdom of Christ, yet actually they belong to the Kingdom of the Devil;
which I am sure he no where finds in my writings, but to the contrary in
diverse passages, as exercit. page 24. But says Mr Marshall, you acknowledge no
more promise for the children of believers, then for the children of Turks.
This matter I had disputed at large, part. 2.. 10 of my Examen, and to mitigate
the odium which popular preachers cast on us by this Allegation I had said, so
does the opinion of Cyprian with his 66 Bishops that would have Gods grace
denied to none: and therefore his opinion puts all the infants of believers in
the same condition with Turks children. To this says Mr Marshal page 85. of
his def^^ce, which I have showed, will not follow out of the words of the
Epistle. Now that I conceive he means he had formerly showed is page 41 in
these words, though he lays it down in general terms that none are to be
hindered from coming to Christ: yet what he says ought to be understood of the
Church, because he speaks of such as God has cleansed or purified, who were
common: which passage I should sooner have expected from a Jesuit then Mr
Marshal, to say that Cyprian ought to be understood of the Church, when the
words nulli hominum nato misericordiam Dei and gratium denegandam, and nulla
anima perdenda est; are as express as may be, that he means it of any that are
born of mankind, that the grace of God is not to be denied them. And after,
omnem omnino hominem ad (...) Christi admittendum esse, and the reason he uses
is not from a cleansing proper to the Church, but because all men are equal,
quando (...) Deo semel facti saint, as he that reads the Epistle, will
presently perceive I alleged also the words of the Grave confutation of the
Brownists published by Mr Rathband, to show not that which Mr Marshall it seems
intended, which was to charge all the Anabaptists of putting all the children
of believers out of the Covenant of Grace as the Turks children, but to show
that the opinion of paedobaptisme as some assert it, does put all the infants
of beleeve^s into the selfsame condition with the infants of Turks and
indians (which were Mr Marshal^s words) by putting all of them alike into the
Covenant of Grace. For if they may be lawfully accounted within Gods Covenant,
if any of their Ancestors in any generation were faithful, and that because
of Gods promise; Exodus 20. 5. then the children of Turks are lawfully accounted
within the Covenant, yea all the infants in the world, for it is not beyond the
thousandth generation to Noah. Mr Marshal tells me that he supposes I do not
think those words, Exodus 20. 5. were intended to intimate that all the children
in the world; who came from Ad^m (...) Noa^ were intended in the Covenant of
Grace, nor that I believe Mr Rathband thought so. What Mr Rath. thought I know
not but his words import so much, and if that was not intended, the text was
impertinently alleged; and though it is true I do not think with them, yet I
might (...) allege their words which I approve not, to show this is no such
(...), which Mr Marshall called (...) great mischief, that by the
Anti-p^dobaptists opinion, all the children of believers should be put into the
some condition with the children of Tarkes; since the same follows on the (...)
doctrine also. I had also Examen, part. 2.. 10. set down my opinion freely in 4
Propositions about the parity of condition of the Turks and our infants, and
told Mr Marshall thus possibly if you open your self plainly, there will be no
difference between us. Mr Marshal in his Defense neither plainly opens
himself, wherein he puts the difference, nor sets down my answer justly, but
leaves out wholly the the fourth Proposition, or confounds it with the third;
and other wise mangles and alters my words in his abridgement, that they are
much unlike what I delivered. For instance, page 85 he sets down this for my
second proposition. That I know no more promise for believers children, then
for the children of (...) whereas my words (...) the^e. For the Covenant or
Promise of Grace, that is righteousness and life as Christ, though I
acknowledge a peculiar promise to Abraham's natural posterity mentioned, Romans
11. 27. yet I know not that God has made such a Covenant to any, much less to
all the natural believing seed of any believing Gentile; and Propos. 3. I say,
they have some promises, though general indefinite and conditional. And I
mean by general and indefinite, such as determine not the kind of good
promised, nor the particular person; and therefore are true, if performed to
any persons in any sort of good. and conditional upon condition of faith and
obedience, as, when it is said the generation of the righteous shall be
blessed, his righteousness to childrens children, to such as keep his
Covenant. Ps. 103. 17. 18. Ps. 112. 2. etc. I tell Mr Marshall if he can show
any more promises then I do, I shall count them a treasure, if not, why does
he endeavor to make me and my opinion odious to the people, as if I put all
the children of the whole Church out of the Covenant of Grace, as I do the
children of the Turks; and acknowledge no more promise for the one, then for
the other: whereas when he has said as much as he can for them, he can bring
no more promise for them then I do, nor dares reject the limitations I
restrain them by?

But says Mr Marshall, you leave them to have their actual standing in the
visible kingdom of the Devil. I ask whither the children have actual
standing in the visible kingdom of the Devil before they are baptized or not?
If he say they have not, then by not baptizing, I leave them not in the visible
kingdom of the Devil, they are out of the visible kingdom of the Devil,
though they be not baptized: if he say they have their actual standing in the
visible kingdom of the Devil before they are baptized, then how is it true
which the Protestants disputing against Bellarmin allege against the necessity
of baptizing infants to salvation, that the children of believers are holy
before baptism. The truth is, I neither leave infants in the Devils, nor Gods
visible kingdom: for I conceive they are in neither kingdom visibly till they
declare by their profession to whom they belong visibly. Mr Marshall used often
this expression of belonging to the visible kingdom of the Devil, and I told
him Examen page 41. I feared he did it ad faciendum populum, to move the
people, by affrighting them by a bugbeare word, if they keep their children
from baptism, then they leave them to have an actual standing in the visible
kingdom of the Devil, or to please them by making them believe that by
baptism their children are put out of the visible kingdom of the Devil. This
I said not judging his heart, but being jealous least it was so; and I confess
I am still suspicious he does so, because he still uses it after he has been
told it, and it is a mere engine to stir popular affections. For how has the
unbaptized infant an actual standing in the visible kingdom of the Devil;
unless it be true that all unbaptized persons have an actual standing in the
visible kingdom of the Devil, which is false in the Catechumeni of old, the
converted thief on the Cross, Constantine the Great, and many others who were
in the visible kingdom of the Christ before they were baptized. On the other
side, thousands of people in America baptized by the Spaniards, had as visible
standing in the Devils kingdom as before. I confess when the baptized
professes the faith of Christ, then baptism is a note of a visible member,
and a distinguishing badge between the people of God and the Devil, and so by
baptism a person is exhibited a member of the Church, but otherwise I see no
reason why an infant that makes no profession of Christ, should be counted
after baptism a visible member of the Church more then before. Let a child of
a Christian be baptized, and after being an infant, and taken by a Turk, be
circumcised, wherein is that child more a visible member of the Church of
Christ then a Turks child, or is he not rather a member of the Church of
Mahomet, then of Christ? Are the Janissaries any whit the more Christians
because they were baptized infants of Christian Greeks? Protestant writers are
wont to define the visible Church of Christians a number of persons that
profess the faith of Christ. So Art. 19 of the Church of England, and all
sorts of Protestant writers. Now that which makes the visible Church, makes
each member a visible member, and that is profession. Baptism and the Lords
Supper; and hearing, are notes as they signify profession, otherwise if a
person be baptized, if he should hear or receive the Lords Supper, and did not
profess the faith, he should not be a visible member for all that. I confess
I have met with some writings which put Baptism into the definition of the
Church, as necessary to the being of a visible Church, and the words in the
Confession of Faith of the 7 Churches of Anabaptists about London [being
baptized into that faith] Artic. 33. are somewhat doubtful, though they seem
rather to import that Baptism is necessary to the right order of a Christian
Church, then to the being of a Church; and I confess they that hold that
members are added to the Church by Baptism and not otherwise, and hold a
nullity of Paedo baptism, must needs say the Churches that have no other then
Infant Baptism, are no true Churches; nor their members Church Members, as
Master Ma^shall says page 84. of his Defense; and so voluntary separation
necessary. But these points of the necessity of right Baptism, not only to
the right order, but also to the being of a visible Church and Churchmember,
and so voluntary separation barely for the defect of it, I have ever
disclaimed; as considering the many errors and ill consequences that would
follow thereupon, and though provocations still increase, yet I have in my
practice shunned separation from my disenting brethren, and I presume though Mr
Marshall count right Baptism a necessary duty, yet he will be more advised
then to make it essential, either constitutive or consecutive to the being of
a Church or Christian either visible or invisible, for fear of giving too much
advantage to Separatists, and Seekers. I suppose in reference to the present
point this is the truth, that however every infant is either in the invisible
kingdom of God or Satan, that is, elect or reprobate; yet no child till he
make profession does visibly belong either to the one, or to the other. I
acknowledge that in the visible Church of the Jews, the infants were reckoned
to the Church, and the reason was from the peculiar Church State of the Jews.
For then God took the whole family of Abraham together in one day, and after
the whole nation of the Jews, were but one Church or congregation: Acts 7. 28.
and accordingly appointed one Tabernacle and Altar, and one high Priest, and
solemn feasts for all to meet as and one nation all ^^adge, circumcision; and
he erected them into one policy, because he would have one fixed people among,
and (...) whom the Massiah should come; and therefo^^ he so provided, that
their tribes should be distinguished, their inheritance divided, and many (...)
which he did not either then (...) appoint to any other people. And this
Church State Circumcision was applied to, so that if Master Marshall and Master
Geree will conclude from Romans 11. 17. etc. that we must have our children
baptized, because they had theirs circumcised we being ingraffed into their
room, they must not only prove that the Gentile-beleevers are grafted into the
invisible Church in place of the Jews (which is the Apostles sense there
notwithstanding, that which M. Geree, or Master Marshall have said) nor that
the Gentile visible Churches are graffed into the visible Church in the place
of the Jews: but they must also prove that the Gentiles are taken into the
same outward Church state which the Jews ^ad. But that is most false. For now
God gathers not a whole nation together, nor has appointed one Temple Altar,
Priest, etc. as he did to the Jews: but he gathers now by preaching, some here,
some there, and the visible Church has now no such policy or outward
government as the Jews had then: and therefore there is not the same reason of
infants belonging to the visible Church of the Gentiles as they did to the
Jews, except one can prove that we are to have the same outward face and
constitution of the Church which they had, which Papists and others imagining
have corrupted the Church, and baptizing of infants arises out of the same
Jewish conceit.

Master Marshall had alleged in his Sermon Romans A large disq^^isition of Romans
11. 17. etc. wherein is showed that the ingraffing there is into the invisible
Church by election and giving faith, and that it p^ove^ not Intant-baptisme.
11. 16. etc. to prove his second conclusion. I complained in my Examen of the
obscurity of his inference, showed him how ambiguous his words were. He takes
this as if it were done in scorn, and as an artifice to darken an argument,
but does not mend the matter in his Defense. For 1. page 134. whereas I
distinguished of graffing in, that it may be either by faith, or profession of
faith; or by some outward Ordinance: Master Marshall in the repetition leaves
out this last member, which is not right dealing. 2. Whereas I had said; The
thing that is to be proved is, that all the infants of every believer are in
the Covenant of free Grace in Christ, and by veriue thereof to be baptized.
Master Marshall page 135. of his D^fence denies this, though it seemed plain
to me, that this text was brought to prove his second conclusion, which I took
to be the same with the antecedent of his Enthymeme, or first argument; and
that I did conceive had this sense, that all the infants of every believer are
in the Covenant of free Grace in Christ, otherwise his first argument is but
nugatory, the antecedent and conclusion being the same; and he equivocates in
his two first conclusions, understanding the first conclusion of the covenant
of saving Grace in Christ, the other of the outward Covenant as he calls it,
as I showed above: which serves for no better end then to delude a reader. But
page 135. he says thus; The thing to be proved from this text is, that our
infants have the same right which the infants of the Jews had, page 140 The
thing to be proved was, our infants have the same privilege with theirs; yet
in the same page he thus forms the conclusion, and therefore we and they
making up the same body are taken in upon the same ground, our children with
us, as well as theirs with them: which last conclusion I do not take to be the
same with the former, nor any one of them the same, with the other or with the
antecedent of Mr Mar. second argument, or his second conclusion, 3. It is yet
uncertain to me what is the medium he would prove his conclusion by out of that
text. In his Defense in three places he calls his confused heap of Dictates his
argument to wit, page 134. The Apostles scope was to show that we Gentiles have
now the same graffing into the true olive which the Jews formerly had; and our
present graffing in is answerable to their present casting out, and their
taking in at the latter end of the world, shall be the same graffing [though
more gloriously] as ours is now; and it is apparent that at their first taking
in, they and their children were taken in, at their casting out they and their
children were broken off; and when they shall be taken in again at the end of
the world, they and their children shall be taken in together, and all by
virtue of the Covenant, Ero Deus tuus, etc. which is the same to us, and to
them; we and they making up the Church of God. In the same page in these words.
Look how the Jews children were graffed in, so are our children, we are taken
instead of them who were cast out, and become on visible Kingdom of Christ with
the rest of them who kept their station, page 140. We as they, were taken in;
they and their children shall be at the last taken in again, as they were at
the first: and therefore we and they making up the same body are taken in upon
the same ground, our children with us as well as theirs with them. Which though
he calls his argument, and says it has a plain sense, yet I see so many
ambiguities still in his words, his speeches so inform or shapelesse, that I
know not well whither he would make many syllogismes or one, nor which to call
the major, which the minor Proposition or term, or which the medium; and I
must profess I find Mr Marshall still so confused a disputer, that I know not
to what purpose his manner of writing in this point should tend, but to puzzle
his reader, and weary his respondent. And since he was told of this, p. 56. of
my Examen, and desired to mend it in his next writing; yet instead of mending
it, he puts it off lightly, page 125. of his Defense, a person may suspect it
is done on purpose to puzzle, rather then to satisfy. For why should a man that
would clear truth in a point of dispute, though in a Sermon ad populum;
especially when his auditory is such as it was at Westminster Abbey, be
unwilling to make a syllogism in mood and figure? did not Master Marshall make
sundry syllogismes in the same Sermon? And would not a short syllogism after a
distinct short paraphrase, have better cleared the truth then such a confused
heap of words he uses in his alleging, Romans 11. 16. etc. And Acts 2. 39.
However what reason or excuse he can pretend for not doing it in his Defense, I
see not.

Mr Geree in his vindiciae Paedo-baptismi, chapter 1. sect. 3. goes somewhat more
distinctly to work, yet neither does he frame a syllogism from Romans 11 11. 12.
13. 17. 18. etc. nor do I know how he would have it framed. He says, the
conclusion to be proved is, that the ch^ldren of Christians have the same
privilege with children of Jews, as they were comprehended so under the
Covenant with their parents as to be reputed members of the same visible
kingdom, and to be sealed with them. This conclusion I deny if it be
understood of the outward privilege belonging to the Jewish Church in that
state it was before Christ's coming. To prove it he lays down four
Proprositions, and deduceth four con^ectaries, but how he shows not. The third
is ambiguous, and if he mean by [ into the place of the Jews cut off] the same
Church State, and by [ partaking of their priviledge^] the privileges
belonging to their Church-(...) as I think he does, it is to denied, and so
likewise his second and third consectary in that sense. Nor does either Romans
11. 17. prove it as shall be presently showed, nor is a believing Jew a looser
by the coming of Christ in regard of his seed, since this was a peculiar
privilege in the time of that Church state, which now cease to be a
privilege, Christ being come; as in like manner the Temple, High Priest, etc.
do, which I have more largely discussed Examen, part. 3.. 11. And for the
fourth consectary, if it be understood of pristine Church State, I likewise
deny it. I grant the promise will be extended to them and their seed, but how?
Not by an outward ordinance or initiall scale, as it is called, applied to
infants, but by the communicating the spirit and word of God to them and their
seed; as the text he alleges imports, Isai. 59. 20. Nor by holding that
neither Jews nor Gentiles now are to have their infants sealed will follow,
that there will be two distinctestates in the Christian Churches: one of the
Jews holy Fathers and children, another of the Gentiles who have only personal
privileges, none for their seed; for neither does Baptism belong to the one
or the other, because they the are seed of believers: and for regeneration and
saving benefits, the Lord bestows to the seed of either as pleases him. Nor
would this conceit of mine set up or keep up a partition wall still contrary to
the Apostle, Ephesians. 2. 14. For then a partition wall is kept up when the
Gentiles as Gentiles are excluded from access to God which is not done by my
doctrine, they that hold that the command about Circumcision still binds
virtually, come nearer to the setting up a partition wall in the Apostles ser
se. I return to Mr Marshall.

Mr Marshall in his Sermon as I conceived made this the thing he would prove,
that we and our children are graffed in together; this I granted in some sense
to be true, that God does usually call and adopt the children with the Fathers,
but I denied it to be so perpetually; so as that a rule for an outward
ordinance may be flamed thence. And so far as I can collect the chief medium
Master Marshall and Master Geree take hence to prove it is* that we Gentiles
have the same ingrassing into the true olive which the Jews formerly had. This
Master Marshall made the Apostles scope, though the truth is it is so far
from being the Apostles scope, that it agrees not with his words, who makes the
ancient Jews natural branches, not ingraffed, and the scope of the Apostle is
otherwise, as has been showed: Examen, page 65. But the thie^e difference is
about the ingraffing what that is, as I had said. The ingraffing to me is meant
of the invisible Church by election and faith. To this Master Marshall page
136. says, I reply, if it be meant of the invisible Church only and that all
who are ingraffed in the Apostles sense whether Jews or Gentiles are only elect
ones, I will promise you never to plead this Scripture more for any inf^nts;
and after if you please let us try it out.

I agree to this motion, and determine that the graffing in Romans 11. 17. etc.
is meant of the ingraffing into the invisible Church by election and giving
faith, with this caution; that I do not deny that the same people might or
were ingraffed into the visible Church by profession of faith, and baptism;
but hold that this ingraffing is more then that which is into the visible
Church by outward profession and ordinances. To prove my determination, I thus
argue.

1. That ingraffing which is Gods act by his sole power, is into the invisible
Church by election and giving faith. For graffing into the invisible Church is
as Mr Marshall says, page 135. admission into visible membership, which if it
be by an outward ordinance, is the easy act of the administratour; if by
profession of faith, the easy act of the professor. But the ingraffing meant
Romans 11. is Gods act from his sole power, as is proved from verse 23. where the
reason is rendered why the Jews should be again grassed in, is, because God is
able to graffe them in again; Ergo, the graffing here is into the invisible
Church.

2. That ingraffing which is called reconciliation opposite to casting away,
that is by election and giving faith; for no other acts can reconcile: but the
ingraffing here is called reconciliation opposite to casting away v. 13. as may
appear in that v. 16. is a reason of the clause about the reception of the
Jews, v. 15. and the 17 verse, is an admonition from the supposition, v. 15.
that the Jews were cast away: which is called breaking off, v. 17. now if
breaking off, v. 17. be the same with casting away, v. 15. then ingraffing is
the same with reconciliation; Erg^, ingraffing is by election and giving of
faith.

3. The ingraffing must be meant of that act whereby the branch stand in the
tree as a branch this will none deny, it being the very terminus of ingraffing,
as hea^ the terminus of Calefaction. But that is by giving faith. Ergo, The
minor is proved from v. 20. where it is said, by ^mbeleefe they were broken off
but thou stand by faith, whence I argue. That act whereby the branch stands
in the tree as a branch, must be the giving that means whereby the branch thus
stands, but that is faith, v. 20. Erg^, the act of ingraffing is by giving of
faith.

4. That ingraffing is meant v. 17. whereby the wild olive is Copartaker of the
root and fatness of the olive tree, as is asserted there. But such is only
election and giving of faith. Ergo, The minor I prove by considering who the
root is, and what the fatness of the olive tree is. 1. Negatively, the root is
not as Master Marshall and Master Blake, every believing pa^ent. For then all
the branches should be natural; the child of every believing parent is a
natural branch from his father: but here the Apostle makes the Gentiles
branches and a wild olive graffed in besides nature, and the Jews only
natural branches growing from the root, v. 21. 24. Nor is it of any moment
which is objected, that other parents are called roots as Jesse, Isai. 11. 1.
For here only the root notes such a Father as is holy and from whom the
branches are holy; which agrees not to every believing Father. 2. Positively.
The root is no other then Abraham. I said twice in my Examen, page 68. 129.
Abraham only is a holy root, or at most Abraham Isaac and Jacob; which I said
only by concession: that if it were so, yet every godly parent was not a holy
root, and therefore it served my turn there, if it were so. This Mr Marshall
page 134. calls; saying, and unsaying. But Mr Marshall might have considered
that I did in that addition only mention the judgment of others, and not
contradicted it there where it was not against my purpose if it were granted;
but otherwise, where I express my own judgment, I mention only Abraham as
the root, Exercit. page 10. Examen, page 64, 65. And so do Deodate annot. on
v. 16* 17. The new Annot. on v. 16. Beza on v. 17. Neque dubium est, quin
radicis nomine intelligatur, Abraham credentium pater. Which contains the
reason of this opinion. For he must be the root who is a Father both to Jews
and Gentiles, who are also branches in this root, the root is said to bear
them, v. 18. But we read not this of any other then of Abraham called the
Father of the faithful, Romans 4. 11. and the Gentile believers his seed, Romans
4. 13. 16. Gal. 3. 29. no where are these things said of Isaac, and Jacob. It
is said indeed that the Jews are beloved, (...) for the Fathers either because
of the Covenant made with them, or because of the favor God bare them; as
often he is said to reserve a lamp in Judah for David's sake, but this speech
has special respect to the Jews, whereas the benefit of the root, v. 17. 18.
is common to Gentiles and Jews. As for the fatnes of the olive tree Deodate
says truly, it is the blessing and promise made to Abraham and his seed and so
the Apostle expres^eth it, Gal. 3. 14. And it would be too frigid, and washy an
exposition to expound it of outward privileges, and ordinances. Yea it were
false, for the Gentiles were not partaker of the outward privileges and
ordinances of Abraham and the Jews they being taken away. Now these things
being put it must needs be, that this ingraffing must be by giving faith since
by faith only the Gentiles are partakers of the root Abraham, and the fatness
of the olive tree the believing Church, not by natural generation of believing
parents, nor by outward administrations. Ergo, the ingraffing here into the
invisible Church is by election and giving of faith.

5. From verse 25. If the breaking off the Jews be by blinding, then the
ingraffing is by giving faith, but the former is true, verse 25. Ergo, the
latter.

6. If reingraffing of the Jews produces salvation, is by turning them from
iniquity, taking away their sins according to Gods Covenant, then it is into
the invisible Church by giving faith, but the former is true, verse 26, 27.
Ergo, the latter.

7. If the reingraffing be by virtue of Gods election and love, his gifts of
calling then it is into the invisible Church by election and giving faith, but
the former is true v. 28, 29. Ergo, the latter.

8. If the ingraffing both of Jews and Gentiles be the fruit of gods mercy,
the breaking off by shutting up in unbeleefe, then the ingraffing is into the
invisible Church by election and giving faith, but the former is true, verse
30, 31, 32. Ergo, the latter.

What should I say more? It is so plain from the whole scope and tenor of the
Apostles words, that the ingraffing there spoken of is into the invisible
Church by election and giving faith, that from the first verse of the chapter
to verse 13. there is scarce a verse but speaks of ^^jecting* foreknowing,
election, grace, hardening, giving a spirit of slumber, d^^kning the eyes,
stumbling, falling or some equipollent term to these, and the Apostle does
plainly signify his intention in all that discourse to be the showing the
mystery of Gods counsel in elcting, reprobating, blinding, converting one
while the Jews, another while the Gentiles; so that I cannot but admire, that
Mr Marshall should interpret the ingraffing of bare admission into visible
Church Membership.

9. Add hereto. The places which I conceive answer to Romans 11. 17. must be
understood of the invisible Church as Ephesians. 3. 6. 1 Cor. 12, 13. Gal. 3. 14. 26.
28. 29. Lastly for testimonies of interpreters I find but two in Marlorats
Cathol. Exposition on Romans 11. 17. and they have these words. Hyperius. Neque
enim hic amplius docet, sed orationem totam ad Gentes convertens sapienter
monet, ne propter electionem suam efferantur, aut Judaeos quia rejecti sunt
contemnant: maxim quum and Judaeorum plurimi salutem sint adhuc per Evangelium
conseq^uturi, Gentes vero iterum possent, si Deo ita visum foret reprobari.
Bucer Insitus fuisti illis] Hoc beneficium est quod Gen^ibus per Iudaeos
contigit. Gentes enim per fidem Christi factae sunt semen Abrahae Gal. 3. 29.
Ergo, insitae Iudaeis, ut grati sanctis patribus promissa, and fruantur, and
spiritu illorum vivant: id quod Apostolus per communionem radicis and
pinguedinis significat* ut namque filii Dei omnes eadem Dei benevolentia
nituntur, ita eorum spiritu aguntur, etiamsi hic donetur grandior post
revelatum Christum. Hic vero ex praecipuis locis est ex quibus probatur eodem
spiritu verae justitiae donatos fuisse Iudaeos ante incarnatum Christum. Calvin
ad verse. 20. nam erectio Iud^orum, si ob incredulitatem facta est, Gentium
insitio per fidem, quid restat nisi ut Dei gratiam recognoscendo inde ad
modestiam ac submissi^uem formentur. And this I thought so plain, that I
conceived Mr Marshall himself so expounded it in his sermon page 43. in these
words. It being the primary intention of the Covenant of Grace, in it is first
work, to show what free grace can and will do to miserable nothing, to cut
miserable man of from the wild olive, and graffe him into the true olive, to
take away the heart of stone, to create in them a heart of flesh, etc. which
thing he says nothing to in his Defense, though I alleged it page 64. of my
Examen, except it be that he meant the words he uses page 137 of his Defense*
alleging that I say, insition ( not inc^^on as it is printed in Mr Marshalls
Defense) may be either into the visible or invisible Church, grassing in, may
be either by faith or by profession of faith, and therefore I say the same with
him, should be to tell me that he can bring as much from my words for him as I
bring from his words for me, which conceit is but vain; for my words are
nothing but the opening the distinction of the various kind of ingraffing; no
assertion in those words what insition is meant, Romans 11. 17. and for the words
Mr Marshall alleges out of my Examen, page 65. of which he says. And truly
Sir, in these words to my understanding, you grant not only my interpretation
of this place, but even the question controverted betwixt us. I shall show to
be a mistake in answering his objection against the interpretation I give of
the ingraffing into the invisible Church, having first observed that Master
Gerees words in his vindic. paedob^aptsmi confirm my interpretation against
his own in the Chapter next before, when he says, Chap. 1. Sect. 4. page 19.
The holiness there is meant not actual holiness, but potentiall in regard of
Gods election. And Mr Blake, page 94. we by faith are graffed in for them, Romans
20. The only objection of weight is, that then some branches of the invisible
Church may be broken off, and so election made revocable, and Apos^asy from
grace maintained: and hereupon Mr Marshall accuses me as symbolizing with
Arminius, and puts this in the margin of his book, page 144. and in the Index:
and thereby thinks to cut scores with me for accusing him as symbolizing with
Arminius, page 69. of my Examen.

To which I answer. 1. That there is a wide difference between Mr Ma^shals case
and mine. I show that Mr Marshals tenet agrees with Arminius his tenet, and I
quote Arminius his words in the margin; and therein I did justly. For Arminius
also understood his speech of outward administrations, to wit the preaching of
the Gospel, in the end of his Anti-perkins, and both Mr Marshall and Arminius
agree, that the infants of the wicked for these outward dispensations are
comprehended in their parents according to the tenor of Gods justice. But I
expressly rejected the tenet of Arminius about revocable election, and
Apostasy from grace; which if they should follow from my interpretation, I
conceiving otherwise, yet were not I to be charged with symbolizing with
Arminius, as Mr Marshall does in his professed tenet. 2 But I conceived I had
prevented this objection, page 64. of my Examen, at those words. The meaning is
not that some of the branches in the invisible Church may be broken off, but
only such as were so in appearance; and I alleged John 15. 2. as an instance
of the like expression: showing in that very similitude, that the word branch
in Christ is sometimes meant of that which is so in appearance, and sometimes
of that which is so in truth; and so in like manner it may be used, Romans 11.
17. And thus Chamier, ^om. 3. paustrat. Cathol. l. 13. c. 21. answers
Bellarmin; urging John. 15. 2. for falling away from faith. But Mr Marshall
tells me, I profess I understand not how this distinction gives you the least
help. I reply, that it plainly avoyds the consequence objected against my
interpretation; for though the branches in one passage be meant of the branches
in appearance, and the breaking off that which was so in appearance, yet, other
places, as in the same verse in the ingraffing may be meant of true ingraffing
into the invisible Church in like manner, as it is John 15. 2. But because upon
more accurate examination I conceive that is not the genuine answer, I shall
therefore let it pass. 3. I say, when the Apostle says the branches were
broken off, he means it of the branches that were truly such, and of the
ingraffing that was truly such into the invisible Church, but that by the
branches are not meant singular persons; but the people, or as M. Mar. speaks
p. 137. the body of them were the branches spoken of ^n this place, and M Geree
p. 16. Nor is it either the Arminians tenet, or any error to say that the body
of a people which were once the elect people of God, and ingraffed into the
invisible Church, because the generality or a greater number were such among
that people, are broken off from election, and the invisible Church. For a
people or nation is not a consistent being, but a fluent being as a river,
which is the same river still, though not the same water; and therefore as when
Cyrus turned Euphrates from it is own channel, he may be said to have turned
away the same river Euphrates that was created at first though it were not the
same numericall water; so when God rejected the Jews from being his elect,
believing people he broke off the same people that were the true branches of
Abraham the true root in the invisible Church, and yet no one particular
person, who was elect or in the invi^^ble Church by faith broken off, which is
the Arminian doctrine. And this I find observed by each of the three Authors
alleged before from Marlorat. Hyperius at v. 2^. is thus alleged; speaking.
Quemadmodum nunc rejectus est populus Iudaicus, qui tamen electus fuerat: ita
potest adhuc fieri, ut a^^quando rejiciatur populus Gentilis, qui nunc electus
est; alioqu singul^s electos de populo Iudaico, vel de populo Gentili reprobari
impossible plane est. Ad hunc (inquam) modum si quicquid de ruina metuenda
electis sequitur, non de singulis electis, sed de populo ex quo descendunt
interpreteris, multis te molest^is liberaveris. Calvin ad verse 21. praecipue
vero notandum Pauli sermonem non tam ad singulos homines, quam ad totum Gentium
corpus dirigi. Bucer ad verse 22. De Gentibus loquitur universim non de
singulis hominbus. And indeed the text leads me to this interpretation. For
when it is said, verse 23, 24. that they shall be graffed in, God is able to
graffe them in again; these which are according to nature; shall be graffed in
their own olive; which cannot be understood of the same person, but of the same
people.

Thus have I besides my first purpose put into this Apology this large
dissertation about Romans 11. 16, 17. etc. partly because by Mr Gerees conference
with me and another, and his words to me; ^indic. paedobap. page 17. I commend
this Scripture to your serious consideration, for I conceive it gives clear
evidence to what I affirm; I perceive this text is his chief hold for
Infant Baptism, and in Mr Blakes new answer to my Examen, page 69. I find these
words; your examination, Romans 11. 16. has been under examination, and if there
be strength in those exceptions, there is weakness no where.

Mr Blake in his answer to my letter, page 30. says thus. If the ingraffing
be by saving faith only, to derive saving grace personally inherent as a
fruit of election from Abraham; then it must be that we are elect in Abraham,
Abraham may say without me ye can do nothing, etc. I answer, if I made
Abraham a root as communicating faith by infusion, or impetration mediatory as
Christ, this would follow; but I make Abraham only a root as he is called the
Father of all them that believe, Romans 4. 11. not by begetting faith in them,
but as an exemplary cause of believing, as I gather from the expression. verse
12. that he is a ^ather to them that walk in the steps of our Father Abraham,
which he had yet being uncircumcised.

Mr Blake ibid. page 31. what made Abraham, Isaac and Jacob roots (as in
nature, so holy roots) but the Covenant? And was not the Covenant made as well
with David, as with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I answer, I make Abraham only
the root, as he is only the Father of beleeevers exemplarily, and that which
made him the Father of believers was not the Covenant, but his exemplary faith,
as I gather from the words of the Apostle, Romans 4. 16, 17, 18, 19. 21. And this
is all the accession of strength I find him opposing to my so manifest
weakness. The rest is answered already.

Mr Marshall page 124. says,. 15. of M. Marshals unjust charge against me as
^arkning his arguments, and casting fi^th in the face of the Assembly.
I raise a dust about his argument, because I tell him he does not distinctly
express what the promise is, Acts 2. 39. and I require of him to form his
proofs into an argument, as if it were unreasonable to require him to make a
syllogism in mood and figure in a Sermon. And yet he did make diverse in that
Sermon, as page 39, 41. But it seems neither then nor since is he willing to
tell what promise that is, Acts 2. 39 and then conclude syllogistically; for
then it would plainly appear that that text serves not his purpose, who in his
second conclusion will not assert that the promise of saving grace is made to
the natural seed of believers; and yet that text speaks of the promise of
Christ, and saving Grace by him. However I remember this was Doctor Prideaux
his manner in Oxford, to require the disputant when he urged a text to read it,
and then to gather his argument from it; and this I ever took to be a bringing
of light, and not raising a dust about an argument. And I shall still profess
it to be a very irksome thing to me to answer an author that will not do so,
and till Mr Marshall do it, shall censure him as one that takes not the way to
clear truth, but to darken it with multitude of wo^ds, among which a man shall
have much ado to find the medium and the conclusion.

Mr Marshall, page 247. accuses me of slurring, plundering, darkning the
^rguments of my adversaries. If he had told me wherein he had done me a
pleasure, that I might know how to amend it, but if he mean (as his words page
134. [ to bring in so many imaginary senses, thereby to darken an argument]
import) in that I tell him his conclusions and speeches may have many senses,
and desire him to set down what sense he means, it is a conceit scarce sober,
since it is plain that distinction and distinct expression is rightly called by
Logicians lumen rationis, and is the only way to enlighten, not to darken
speeches. And therefore all that are able in dispute, make this their chief
business to distinguish terms, or things that differ; and then set down their
conclusions, and frame their arguments and answers, which is the thing I would
have Mr Marshall do: Nor is my pretending obscurity in Marshall a kind of art
to evad^ what cannot plainly be answered, as Mr Geree conceives, vind.
paedobap. chapter 1. sect. 3. but a means to find out the force of the argument,
that I might give it a plain answer.

Whereas I had framed the fifth argument in my exercitation thus. That which in
succeeding ages in which it was in use, was in force. 1. As a tradition not
written. 2. Out of imitation of Jewish circumcision. 3. Without universal
practice. 4 Together with the error of giving infants the Lords Supper; and
many other humane inventions under the name of Apostolical traditions that is
deservedly doubtful, but such is Infant Baptism; Ergo, Mr Marshall page 251.
252. tells me, this is a poor argument. And yet such arguments have been
accounted after other arguments from Scripture of great moment against Papists
and Prelates, in rejecting of ceremonies. But how does Mr Mar. answer this? He
denies the major, which has been accounted good in other points. And then
because I make a several proof of the several parts of the minor: he repeats
my words as if I had made a several argument from each branch, and to make a
show of their weakness, puts in another argument and conclusion then mine, as
like, with this inference. Ergo, we are not bound to observe it, Ergo, it was
not a duty, which were none of my conclusions. And then says, This kind of
arguing is almost as wild as that which the schools call a baculo ad angulum,
and the boys in the schools would stamp and hiss at such an inference. I
profess if I should in schools repeat my opponents arguments as Mr Marshall
does mine, I should allow the boys in the Schools to stamp and hiss at such
a practice. Mr Marshall page 124. has these words. You still go on in your
wonted equivocation of the word Covenant of Grace, taking it only of the
Covenant of saving grace, not including the external way of administration
with it. I this I said above I did because I love to speak plainly without
equivocation, but it seems to Mr Marshall that which I count plain speech
without equivocation, is equivocating with him. But what a ridiculous charge is
this? It Is equivocation when a word is taken in various senses. Is it
equivocation in me to take the word covenant of grace only of the covenant of
saving grace? This is like as if a man should be charged with speaking
nonsense, because he speaks good reason in right language.

But I hope by this time the Reader does understand who has used sophistry in
disputing, I or Master Marshall.

What I said of the Assembly, page 27. of my Examen, I did it not to cast filth
in their face, as Master Marshall construed it; but as a brotherly intimation
of my fears and apprehensions to make them cautelous, whose wise and faithful
deportment in that great trust reposed in them is of great moment to the whole
Christian Church. Of whom I profess I am still jealous out of Love to them,
that especially in this matter they are not so sensible as they should be of
the truth of God, and the good of the Church. For which jealousy, and for what
I said about wasting of time about inconsiderable things comparatively, I
suppose I am able to give a sufficient account. 16. Of Mr Marshals untrue
charge against me, as if I rested on Grotius in setting down the tenent of
Antiquity upon occasion of which the tenent of Antiquity is again examined, my
judgment of their doctrine vindicated, Mr. Marshals new all^gations answered,
and my diligence to find out their tenets manifested.
And this I speak merely to awaken them, and to prevent that inconsideratenes
through an (...) passion, or such like cause usually befalls such meetings, and
is the cause of much woe to the Church of God. Be it well or ill taken liberavi
animam meam meam, I have freed my own soul.

There are some other things wherewith Mr Marshal endeavors to render me a
suspected person* page 29. of his defense. I cannot but wonder, why you (who
pretend to be familiarly acquainted with the secrets of Antiquity) should have
so much correspondency with them who are not likely to help you with any
certain intelligence. Hugo Grotius is the strongest stake to support your
tottering hedge; and sure I am Grotius was a friend to the Socinians, and it is
well known what they think of Baptism. To this I answer, it is untrue that I
any where pretend to be familia^ly acquainted with the secrets of Antiquity, I
say, so far as I can by search find it is thus and thus, but never did take
upon me familiar acquaintance with the secrets of Antiquity. It seems Master
Marshal had the help of his friend, and so there was a College to answer my
Book, yet after he and his friend have done all they could in this point, it
does not yet appear but that I was in the right, to wit that Infant baptism
is not so ancient as is pretended. For he has not yet acquitted the treatise
of questions ad Orthodoxos from bastardy; nor has he answered that which I
said that the words and whole scope of Irenaeus, lib. 2, c. 39. show that the
place is not meant of Baptism: but with a new device, such as it concerns the
authors conscience to look to, when he is told the words and whole scope show
that the place is not meant of Baptism; in which I chiefly alleged the
words, the answerer says nothing to that, but maimedly sets down my words
thus* In the last place you labor to prove that it is not meant of Baptism
from Iren^^us his scope in that place. And then says that though the scope be
so, yet the words prove the question in debate before us. Which is a manifest
abusing the reader, never answering the reason I gave from the very words and
whole scope, that they could not be understood of the rite of Baptism. And for
Origin all that is yet brought cannot acquit the passages alleged from
suspicion of being supposititious, considering that Origin is taxed for
Pelagianizing, whereas those words are point-blanke against them, which being
observed by me, the answerer thought it wisdom to say nothing to it. And for
the rest of the testimonies Master Marshall brought, I did confess Nazianzen,
Cyprian, Augustine, Hierom, Ambrose mention Paedobaptisme, but never upon Mr
Marshal's ground federal holiness, but upon (...) supposed necessity to save the
Infant from perishing.

Master Marshall it seems rests much on Augustines words, that he says. Hoc
Ecclesia semper habuit, semper tenuit, hoc a majorum fide accepit, hoc usque in
finem perseveranter custodit; He puts it therefore in the Title, page 55. of
his Defense, and page 9. quotes for these words Augustine. Sermon. 15. de verbis
Apost. I have read over that Sermon tom. 10 of his works again and again and
find not those words there, nor any to that purpose, I have also read Sermon
14. de verbis Apostoli, which has the title de Baptism parvulorum adversus
P^lagianos, and I find not there those words; only these I find there. Sanctus
Cyprianus est quem in manus sumpsi antiquus Episcopus sedis hujus, quid
senserit de Baptismo parvulorum, immo quid semper Ecclesiam sensisse
monstraver^^ p^ululum acc^pit^, I deny not but that those words may be in
(...) but if Master Marshall had given me more certain direction where to find
them, I might then perhaps have given a more direct answer. However for these
reasons I conceive little cause to be moved with those words. First, because I
find not that Augustine took it to be the tenet of the Church from any other
ground, then the Epistle of Cyprian, 59. ad Fidum, concerning which he says
that Cyprian has showed how the Church has always held it, both in the words
above cited tom. 10. Sermon. 14. de verbis Apost. and tom. 7. lib. 2. de peccat
merit^ and remiss. c. 5. etc. And yet he that reads that Epistle of Cyprian
shall find Cyprian only declaring the determination of the Council of 66
Bishops there mentioned, but nothing of the Churches always holding it.
Secondly, The famous story of the likelihood of cheating Augustine and the rest
of the African Bishops with a supposititious Canon of the Nicen Council by
three Roman Bishops to confirm Appeals to Rome from Africa in the case of
Apiarius does me thinks show, that Augustine might easily be mistaken about the
tenet of the Church. Thirdly, The many speeches in Augustine, as Epist. 118. and
elsewhere, and others of the Ancients, about Easter, Lent-fast, Episcopacy,
infant Communion and other traditions which are not credited by Protestant, nor
some of them by some Popish writers do clear him from arrogance, or impudence
that should say there is* no great reason to give so much credit to that large
assertion of Augustine (if it be his) as Master Marshal and some others seem to
give to it. Fourthly Those words of Augustine tom. 7. de peccat: merito and
remissione, lib. 10. c. 34. Optime Punici Christiani baptismum nihil aliud quam
salutem and sacramentum corporis Christi nihil aliud quam vitam vocant. Unde
nisi ex antiquant existimo, and^ Apostolica traditione, qua Ecclesia Christi
i^situm tenent pr^ter baptismum, and participationem Dominicae me^s^, non solum
non ad regnum Dei sed nec ad salutem, and vitam aeternam posse quenquam hominum
pervenire, do me thinks evidence that Augustine sometimes called that the
Churches tenet, which he gathered by conjecture from the practice of the
African Christians known to him. But it will be said the Pelagians did not
deny Infant baptism to have been the practice of the Church. I answer, nor do
I deny that it was in Augustines time the practice of the Latin and Greek
Churches to baptize Infants in case of necessity, but that it was so from the
beginning, and always in the Church we do not find the Pelagians yielded, yet
did they not perhaps question it, either because they were carried away with
that erroneous rule that what they saw every where practiced, and found not
when it began to take that for an Apostolical tradition, or because of the
tyranny of the present custom, which Augustine himself somewhere confesses,
that though he misliked, yet liberius improbare non andeo. But says Master
Marshal page 55. I cannot but conceive it likely, that Augustines Ecclesia
semper habuit, semper tenuit, should sway as much with the intelligent
impartial Reader, as Master Tombs his non semper habuit, non semper tenuit I
grant it should and much more, yet the Authorityes, and reasons I bring should
be I account sufficient to weigh down Augustines testimony.

I had said the determination mentioned by Cyprian Epist. 59. ad Fidum, a^
far as I can by search find, is the spring head of Infant baptism. Master
Blake in his Answer to my letter, page 6. I desire to know what color of truth
you can put upon these words. I answer, the words are true without any color
put upon them, For I did not deny that I found Infant baptism practiced
before, but that the determination of that council was the spring head, that is
as Examen* page 16. the first determined rule, or Canon, by force of which it
has since continued in a stream, and this is true.

Having formerly searched for Austines words so often alleged for the practice
of Infant baptism, upon the publishing Master Blakes book I found them, not
as Master Marshal quotes it, Sermon. 15. de verbis Apostoli, but as Master Blake
cites it, Ser. 10. And upon reading of them, the thing that Augustine says the
Church always had, held and keeps, seems not to me to be the practice of
Infant baptism, unless by consequence (which in matter of history is not so
clear a proof) but the doctrine of original sin in Infants, which Pelagians
denied, not the practice of baptizing Infants. For the words immediately before
are nemo ergo vobis susurret doctrinas alienas. And these words are only a
passage in a Sermon ad populum, in which usually there is not such exactnes, as
in other works; and among those Sermons, which are not out of all question
whether genuine. But that the Reader may judge of this testimony, I will set
down the words as I find the^.

Nullus hominum in ista quae ex* Adam defluit massa mortalium nullus omnino
hominum non aegrotus, nullus sine gratia Christi sanatus. Quid de parvulis
pueris, si ex Adam aegroti? nam et ipsi portantur ad Ecclesiam. Et si pedibus
illuc currere non possunt, alienis pedibus currunt ut sanentur Accommodat illis
matter Ecclesia aliorum pedes ut ven^ant, aliorum cor ut credant, aliorum
linguam ut fateantur: ut quoniam, quod aegri sunt alio peccante praegravantur,
sic cum hi sani sunt, alio pro eis confitente salventur. Nemo ergo vobis
susurret doctrinas alienas. Hoc Ecclesia semper habuit, semper tenuit: hoc a
majorum fide percepit: hoc usque in finem perseveranter custodit. Quoniam non
est opus sanis me dicus sed aegrot antibus. Quid necessarium ergo habuit Infans
Christum, si non aegrotat? si sanus est qu^re per eos qui eum diligunt medicum
quaerit? Si quando portantur Infantes, dicuntur omnino nullum propaginis habere
peccatum, and veniunt ad Christum: quare non eis dicitur in Ecclesia, qui eos
opportant ad Ecclesiam. Auferte hinc innocents istos non est opus sanis
medicus, sed male habentibus: non venit Christus vocare justos sed pecca^^res?
nunquam dictum est sed nec aliquando dicetur. Which last words show that
Augustine spoke these things not as an Historian from good records, but as in
popular Sermons is wont, out of conjecture from common practice in his time.
Certainly the last words Augustine could deliver on no other ground: This
testimony then has a weak basis. And me thinks the testimony of Chamier
panstrat: Cathol. tom. 4. lib. 5. c. 15. 19. Denique hunc morem quis non videt
ejus temporis esse, cum vix millesimus quisque baptizabatur non adultus, and in
Catechumenis diligenter exercitus might serve to balance Augustines testimony
inconsistent with so many likelihoods to the contrary. Which testimony of
Chamier Master Marshall might have vouchsa^^d to have taken notice of, though
it was but in the Margin of my Book.

Nor has Master Marshall or his friend yet it proved baptizing of Infants of
believers, by reason of federall holiness taught by the Ancients* Master Geree
puts a passage of T^rtullian de anima, cap. 39. Ex seminis praerogativa
procreari sanctos in his frontispeece, and Master Marshall conceives me sick of
it. I answer, I bless God no truth makes me sick, it would make me well to
see paedobaptisme proved either of Scripture, or primitive Antiquity. But for
this testimony of Tertullian my stomach was quickly eased of it, as finding
not only by reading, Delacerda his note on it, but also by considering the
occasion and words going before that ex seminis praerogativa imports not
federal holiness, but holiness, by reason of the freedom from that unholinesse
in their procreation, which the infidels children had from the many gross
idolatrous superstitions, by which they were defiled, and as it were dedicated
to the Devil. And I conceive Hieromes words to Paulinus, Epist. 153. cited by
Master Blake in his answer to my letter, page 57. expounding thus Tertullian,
assereas sanctos dici fidelium filios, quod quasi candidati sunt fidei and
nullis idololatriae sordibus polluantur, show that in Tertullian the
praerogative of seed, notes only freedom from pollutions of Idolatry, at or
before their birth, not covenant holiness, and the word candidatos fides, the
same with designatos sanctitatis prove that they were holy in expectation,
because in hope and intention believers, and so to be baptized. And though I
find Tertullians words somewhat obscure, as all his writings are; yet in that
he calls them designatos sanctitatis (which seems to be meant of baptism) not
only ex seminis praerogativa, but also ex institution is disciplina, which
Master Marshall himself interprets of their education, page 73. of his
defense, it seems plain to me, that this place proves that Tertullian makes
their Christian education the antecedent to the baptism of believers children
in his days: and so this place makes against Master Marshals tenet not for it.

It is true, the Ancients do allusively call baptism circumcision. as they do
the Lords Table the Altar, the Lords Supper the Sacrifice, the Presbyters
Priests, the Deacons Levites; nor do I deny that they say circumcision was a
type of baptism, (which Protestant writers grant not) and that they thereupon
make baptisus succeed circumcision, and they argue for baptizing of Infants
from circumcision, this I granted in my exercitation and Examen. But yet I
think neither Master Marshall nor his friend can show that they argued thus,
the Children of Abraham were circumcised by virtue of the Covenant, I will be
thy God and the God of thy seed, therefore the children of believers only are
to be baptized by virtue of the Covenant I find that they argued thus from
circumcision, circumcision was the remedy against original sin, and the male
that is not circumcised, shall be cut off from his people, so Baptism is the
remedy of original sin, and by reason of it, the unbaptized infant dying,
shall be damned. But I think if Master Marshals friend could, he would have
showed that they argued from federall holiness of infants of believing
parents, to the capacity of Baptism; this I yet think is a late device, no
elder then Zuinglius as I said in my Examen. And so my hedge is not yet
tottering, but rather Mr Marshal's hedge, whereby he fenceth Infant Baptism
either from Antiquity or Scripture is already so broken down, that a mean
Scholar may go through it; and if any truth-searching Scholar be satisfied
by Mr Marshals writing, it is to me an amazement. 2. As for that which he
says, that Grotius is the strongest stake in my hedge, meaning in point of
antiquity, therein Master Marshall is much deceived. For, 1. the chief stake
in my hedge in point of antiquity is the observation upon what ground the
Ancients taught Infant Baptism, which was not Covenant-holines, but supposed
necessity to save the child from perishing; and the supposed power that
Baptism has to give grace, which I gathered from Cyprian, Augustine, and
others, but do not remember that I received it from any but by my own
observation. 2. My hedge was in some sort made in my Exercitation before I ever
took notice of any thing in Grotius about paedobaptisme, which was about the
time I began to frame my Examen upon occasion of Mr Thomas Goodwin his citing
his annotation upon Matthew. 19. 14. where Grotius is so far from being a stake
in my hedge, that Doctor Homes, page 146. says, that for Grotius his own
opinion it is clear and full for Infant Baptism upon that 19 of Matthew v. 14.
and therefore I suppose his testimony is the less to be suspected in this
matter. I confess that Grotius put me in mind of that of Gregory Nazianzen,
which I find in the relation of his life, that though his Father were a Greek
Bishop, yet he remained unbaptized, till being sent to Athens to study; being
at sea he was in danger of drowning: and being perplexed, that he was likely to
dye being unbaptized; he resolved to be baptized when he came to shore. Mr
Marshall asks how I prove his Father was a Christian when he was born? To this
I answer, that I had thought Mr Marshall had not been ignorant, that this
instance of Gregory Nazianzen's Father is brought by many Protestant writers
against the Papists that deny marriage to the Clergy, to prove that then
Bishops were married, and did use their wives. If Mr Marshall please, he may
read what Chamier panstrat: Cathol. tom. 3. lib. 10. c. 13.. 10. says of his
father and mother.

I also found in Grotius the instance of Chrysostom, which I confess I took
upon his word as wanting books and time to read so much as was necessary to
examine the matter, Grotius not directing whence he had it. But if that
instance do not hold, the instance of Hierome is plain, whom Erasmus in his
life proves out of his own writings to have been born of Christian parents in
Pannonia, yet was baptized at Rome, whither he was sent to be taught the
learning of that age.

The testimony of the Council of Neocaesarea I did not remember till Grotius
put me in mind of it; but I trusted not to his quotation only, but found the
same in O s^^nder his Epit. Eccles. Hist. Cent. 4. lib. 1. c. 21. at the year
311. with this note; Non intelligo quid sibi posterior hujus Canonis pars
velit. As for the words they are so plain, that Mr Marshals evasions are but
shifts. For though it be true that the Canon was only about children in the
womb, yet the reason of their not baptizing, is not either because they were
not yet born, or suretres could not undertake for them, but because in the
confession in baptism, every ones free choice is showed. Which plainly declares
that Council held that none were to be baptized, but such as showed their own
free choice by confession. As for Balsamon and Zona^as it is true that I have
not read them but taken their testimony from Grotius, because the testimony of
the Council of Neoc^sarea, ancienter then the first Nicene was the thing
alleged, Balsamon and Zoharas were only glo^^ers; yet Mr Marshall says
nothing to Zonaras, and what he brings in answer to Balsamous gloss is nothing
to the purpose. For neither did Grotius nor I say that Balsamon denied
Infant Baptism according to his own opinion, but that from that canon Balsamon
and Zonaras, do infer that an infant cannot be baptized because it has not
power to choose the confession of Divine Baptism, which is all one with that
which Mr Marshall himself says, page 31. There is required of him that would
profess himself a follower of Christ ((...) the last words of the Canon) a
free election: or (as Balsamon has it) there is required of everyone in
Baptism his own promise, which an infant in its mothers womb cannot do. And
can an infant out of the mothers womb do it? so that it is plain even by Mr
Marshals own explication of the Canon, that that Council held that those were
only to be baptized, that could make a promise themselves. I doubt not but that
this Council allowed Baptism of infants, as Nazianzen did in case of danger
of death, but I think it is plain that out of that case they allowed not the
baptism of an infant, no not though a believers infant; till the child could
make its own confession: as appears from their scrupling the baptizing of the
mother converted now with child, lest it should be taken to reach to the child
in the womb, and from the general reason, that every one manifests his own
free choice in confession. And I am peswaded that this was the true state of
Baptism in those days, in the Greek and Latin Church* that they did baptize
all sorts of infants whether of believers or unbeleevers, in case of danger of
death, least they should perish for want of it; in which case Lay-persons did
baptize: and Augustine contra epist. Parmeniani, cap. 13. lib. 2. says, si
autem necessitas urgeat, aut nullum, aut veniale delictum est. But otherwise
they baptized not ordinarily, till they came to years to make their own
confession. The cases of Nazianzen, Augustine, and Hierome, Constantine the
great, and others; and their solemn baptizing only at Easter and Whitsuntide,
which is observed in the Rubric of the English Liturgy, me think should
abundantly satisfy men concerning this truth. I cited likewise Grotius his
speech of many of the Greeks, who in every age even to this day, do keep the
custom of deferring the Baptism of little ones, till they could themselves
make a confession of their faith. For which words though he cite no Author,
yet I presume Grotius, who is even by Spanheimius, often styled vir summus;
would not have said it, unless he had some ground for it. Mr Marshall says, I
might blush for justifying the Anabaptists, in saying that the Ancients,
especially the Greek Church have rejected the baptism of infants for many
hundred years; meaning in the first ages after Christ. But as yet, neither Mr
Marshall nor his friend have showed me sufficient reason why I should retract
it. For what he brings out of Photius and Balsamon, men of much later standing
about the later Canons, and Imperial laws of the Greeks; and one of the 8
Canons concluded in Carthage against the Pelagians, requiring infants to be
baptized: proves not, but that the Greek Church rejected baptizing of infants
many hundred of years in the first ages; nor does it overthrow that of Grotius,
that many of the Greeks (he does not say the Greek Church) in every age to
this day do keep the custom of deferring the baptizing of little ones, till
they could themselves make a confession of their faith. Yea, the laws brought
by Mr Marshall rather prove it. For why should laws be made for it, but
because many did neglect it? And the story out of Balsamon about captives of
Christians, rather shows that some were not baptized, when little ones even
among Ch^ristians, because they determine if there were no witnesses to prove
their Baptism, though children of Christians; they should be baptized.

As for Grotius his being a friend to the Socinians, it is nothing to me, who
knew not Grotius nor his ways; nor ever pleaded for him. Yet I remember I have
read that though he was accused thereof long ago by Ravenspergerus, he was
justified by Vossius, and what ever Rivet, Maresius, Laurentius, charge him
with, yet his works have a place among the learned, and may be read and made
use of cum judicio, at least as the works of Papists, Lutherans, Prelatists,
etc. who yet may be tainted with errors. Even Theophilus Philokyriaces,
Loncardie usis; if I mistake not Master Marshals friend, does in the very title
page of his Dies Dominica, and in the book make use of Barenius his testimony
in his Annals; an author and work as much excepted against ^^ Grotius. Nor do
I find that in that wherein I made use of Grotius, he has deceived me; or I or
he wronged the truth, or our Reader.

Mr Marshall page 54. of his Defense says, that he perceived I have made great
use in this controversy of an Arminian book commonly known by the names of
censura censurae Whereas I never read the book or made any use of it, till I
read this passage in Mr Marshals Defense. But since I confess I have read
chapter 23 of it, and am by that I find there the more confirmed in that truth,
wherein I concur with that Author: though the truth is the chief light I
had for antiquity in this matter, was some little reading of my own, and that
which I read in Vossius his theses theol: de paedobaptisme.

But because Mr. Marshall has accused me as having correspondencie with them
who are not likely to help me with any certain intelligence, that it may
appear that I used what diligence I could to get most certain intelligence
when I applied my self to answer Mr Marshals Sermon, I presumed to write this
ensuing letter, to that famous learned Gentleman, Mr John Seldom, of the Inner
Temple.

Though the answer was no other then a reference of me to the books I might
meet with in Stationers shops, yet I conceived this advantage I had by it, that
what I found in books extant might be the more safely relied on, and that my
diligence to discover the truth would be the more apparent, for which I denied
my self rest; 17. Of my opinion about excommunication, Church Government, the
admission unto all ordinances, my former conformity, alleged to alienate men's
minds from me and my writings.
and without recompense from men, laid out more then my estate could bear.

But M. Mar. seems ready to catch at any thing that may make me suspected, and
so bring my writing out of credit; and p. 78. of his Defense, thus he speaks. I
am misinformed by good friends who know and love you very well if your self
incline not this way to baptize any, whether Turks or Heathens, who only would
make a profession of their faith in Jesus Christ, and then admit them to al
other ordinances, and not have them excommunicated a sacris, but only a
privato consortio; though their lives should prove scandalous. To which I say,
that I deny not, but that in private conference lamenting the sad condition of
these nations, that are likely to cut one another throats about the
differences between Presbyterians and Independents; I have said that I doubted
whether ever excommunication a sacris, or the Presbyterian or Independent
Ecclesiastical government, would be proved to be Jure Divino by Christ's
appointment. And I confess that I take it to be but a matter of prudence,
whether each congregation have it is complete power and order within it self,
or that it be ordered in some things by an assembly of select persons out of
diverse congregations, and whether congregations and pastors be fixed, or
unfixed. And I doubt whether the power of the keys, Matthew. 16. 19. be any
other then doctrinall; whether Matthew. 18 15, 16, 17, 18. contain any other
direction then about particular injuries between brother and brother, or let
him be to thee a heathen and a publican; be any other then shunning familiar
converse: whether 1 Cor. 5. 2. the mourning that the incestuous person might be
taken away from among them, was any other then upon solemn fasting and prayer
by the whole Church of Corinth, out of a holy zeal to Gods glory by Anathema
curse or imprecation, to imprecate the vengeance of God upon him for the injury
he had done to God, and the Christian profession; that he might be taken away
from them by God, and whether the delivery to Satan were any other then an act
of Apostolical power, or such as like them had power over unclean spirits
tending to the taking away his natural life, as Molinaeus in his Vate^. And I
conceive the Apostle verse 9, 10, 11, 12. of that chapter; proceeds from that
particular occasion to general directions concerning the d^^lining society
with them that are vicious: which directions are manifestly concerning
arbitrary and voluntary society in civil things, such as in a sort in some
case they might afford to infidels, and then concludes. And ye shall put away
from among your selves that wicked one, which as Ainsworth observes on Deuteronomy.
17. 7. are the same words that the Greek uses, Deuteronomy. 17. 7. and in like
manner, Deuteronomy. 22. 21. 22. 24. noting the event of executing judgment by
killing, whereby the guilty person and the guilt of his transgression was
removed from them. And in reference to the incestuous person if notes the
consequent of their mourning that he might be taken away from them, v. ^. not
by such a process as is either used in Episcopal Courts, or Presbyteriall
Consistories; or Congregationall meetings (though I think this last way comes
nearest to it of any of the three) by conventing, trying, hearing w^nesses, and
then pronouncing a judicial sentence according to the determination of one or
more by plurality of votes, but by a solemn detestation of the fact, mourning
for it, and with joint commotion and concurrence of spirit complaining of it to
God, and imploring his vengeance to cut him off, and so to vindicate his own
name and people. Which I conceive the Lord did then in an extraordinary way,
when they had no Christian Magistrate or other power to avenge that injury to
God and his people, in that Church which was endued abundantly with special
gifts, 1 Cor. 1. 7. 1 Cor. 12. 1 Cor. 14. Which fact, I for my part doubt how
it can be made the foundation of an ordinary mere Ecclesiastical judgment,
with jurisdiction as superiors that claim authority without special gift; in
the time wherein a Christian Magistrate is ready to execute judgment on such
offenders, any more then the fact; Judge. 20. of the whole congregation of
Israel, in avenging the fact of the men of Gibeah, when there was no King in
Israel, might be drawn into example for an ordi^nary practice when they had
Judges, much less how hence may be concluded any such thing, as power of
suspension from the Lords supper for every emergent scandal so judged by a
congregation, or congregationall Presbytery. Nor does the Church loose by
having a Christian Magistrate, if that jurisdiction be wanting; since I suppose
it is better provided for by the constant care of a christian Magistrate, if
conscientious in executing judgment: if not, such censures have been seldom
executed with conscience, or good effect. And though it be, that many magnify
the virtue and benefit of their juridical excommunication yet the best
intelligence I have, makes me question whether it has not been rather an
engine of much harm, as being used rather against dissenters in opinion, and
opposers of profit, then men openly vicious, mannagers of that cen^ure
generally showing themselves irreconcilable to them that dissent from them,
but favorable enough to vicious living. Nevertheless I deny not, but that
there is a discipline proper to the Church, as namely in case of erroneous
doctrine, and superstitious pra^tise, contrary to the christian faith or
worship according to the practice. Acts 15. and command, Tit. 3. 10. Rev. ^.
24. 20. and in case of vicious life according to the scriptures, 1 Timothy 5. 20.
2 Thessalonians. 3. 6. 14, 15. 1 Cor. 5. 9, 10, 11. And if any assembly of Ministers
and Rulers be set up for the better discovery of such, that a person be not
charged with those evils upon uncertain reports; I think it agreeable to Gods
will, 1 Timothy 5. 19. And if it happen that any such facts be perpetrated as are
like to that of the incestuous person: I doubt not but the whole Church may and
ought to disclaim the person so offending, and to exclude him from all
brotherly communion, because I conceive so much was done to the incestuous
person, as I gather from 2 Cor. 2. 6, 7. yet herein they did not act as Judges
that had power of jurisdiction over him, but as Physicians out of charity
seeking to cure him. And I suppose in the manner of doing these things, we have
not certain precise direction from Gods word, but that we are left free by God
to order such things though pertaining to christians as christians by alterable
rules of prudence. And thus far I have thought good to express my self in
this matter, because of Mr Marshals words tending to render me suspected as if
I did monstri aliquid alere, nourse some monster.

As for my opinion about baptizing, I have publicly declared when I examined
whether to visible Church membership were necessary real sanctity in the
judgment of Church Officers, that by profession sufficient to it, I mean a
profession of repentance and faith in Christ, which is serious, sober, free,
and understanding; but denied that it is necessary there should be a further
probation by trying men's spirits, so as to satisfy the particular congregation
or Church Officers; that a person be admitted to Church Membership, and the
Lords Supper. I confess such trial is requisite in admitting into special
function* or intimate society; but not to communion in worship. And my opinion
is, that as much is required to make capable of baptism, as of the Lords
Supper; and that being admitted to the one, if rightly performed, they are not
to be debarred of the other, for want of a further trial of their spirits. And
though I never said that by rectifying Baptism, all the abuses I mention
following padobaptisme would be removed (for I did not make paedobaptisme the
sole or principal cause of them, that is man's corruption, which will fall into
those or the like in some measure, if paedobaptisme were removed) yet it is
true which I said in my Examen, part. 2.. 7. the only way to further
reformation, is to begin in a regular way at the purging of that Ordinance of
Jesus Christ, to wit Baptism. Even as though all ignorance and superstition
were not removed by removing Latin Service, yet that was the only regular way
to begin at the removing it. And it is easy to conceive, that forasmuch as the
gross ignorance of people is much occasioned by their baptizing before they
know, that if they were not baptized till they knew christian Religion, as it
was in the first ages, gross ignorance in christian professors would be
almost wholly reformed, and for christian walking, if baptism were administered
with a solemn abrenunciation, profession and promise by the baptized in his own
person, and upon that were baptized, I doubt not but it would have more aw on
men's consciences then many other means used or devised, considering how in the
primitive times men differred baptism for fear they might not enjoy their
lusts, and they were counted by some as guilty of inexpiable crime that fell
away after baptism: and on the other side, infant baptism is the ground upon
which innumerable people ignorant and profane harden themselves as if they were
good christians, regenerate, and should be saved without holiness of life,
never owning or considering any profession or promise made for them as theirs.

There have been other suggestions hinted by Mr Geree, but amplified in
clancular whisperings concerning my former conformity to ceremonies and
Episcopal government, which are carried about in private to render me a person
suspected, and to lessen the credit of my writing, the chief part of which I
have answered in my Sermon entitled Fermentum Pharisaeorum; and the time, end,
necessity, manner, and circumstances in doing what I did, being pleas
sufficient to acquit me, and the things not belonging to the present cause, but
being fitter for private audience. I will trouble the Reader no further with my
Apology, assuring my self that setting aside this opinion of paedobaptisme and
common infirmities, my life, labors doctrine even in the judgment of those
that dissent from me, and knew me, will abundantly answer for me against all
clancular whisperings whatsoever.

And concerning my two treatises8 18. Of the vanity of Mr Ley's vaunt
concerning the deadly wound given to my cause, and the contrary demonstrated by
a brief going through the principal points about this argument, as they have
hitherto been disputed. As about Acts 2. 39. Romans 11. 16. 1 Cor. 7. 14. Colos.
2. 12. Matthew. 28. 19. Acts 16, 15. Matthew. 19. 14. etc.
notwithstanding Mr Ley's censure passed perhaps before he had compared mine and
my Antagonists writings together; I may rather say, that by my two treatises,
there is such a wound given already to Infant Baptism, that however men may
play the Mountebanks and skin it over, it will never be cured at the bottom.
For in point of antiquity it still stands good which I asserted; That
Infant Baptism is not so ancient as is pretended, as now taught, is a late
Innovation; that a great number of those that sought reformation in the
thirteenth Century, opposed infant baptism; that the doctrine of
Anti-paedobaptisme neither undermines Magistracy, Ministry, Lords day, nor any
true interest of the infants of believers, that the argument from the Covenant
to the Seal, is either a tautology, or invalid without a command, that the
Covenant made with Abraham, Genesis 17. was a mixed Covenant having in it not
only promises of spiritual benefits common to all believers, but also
peculiar promises concerning things temporal; that Acts 2. 39. being meant of
Christ and saving benefits by him; as Master Marshall confesses cannot serve
Master Marshals turn to prove his second conclusion which he denies to be meant
of the promise of saving grace, as if it were made to believers and their
natural seed. As for Master Marshals paraphrase, which he calls argument, page
129. 130. of his Defenc^; I think it to be most absurd in that it makes the
promise, Acts 2. 39. when applied to the Fathers to be meant of justification,
when to the children, of outward administrations; nor so expounded are the
words true: there being no such promise. That Romans 11. 16. etc. proves not that
there is the same Church state in the Churches of the Gentiles, that was in the
Jews, so as that the Infants of Believers should by virtue of natural
generation be reckoned as visible members, forasmuch as now the Church is not
national as it was then, nor gathered as God did the Jewish Church by taking
the whole nation for his people in one day, but now the Church of God is
gathered by preaching up and down, some in one place and some in another in
succession of time; That 1 Cor. 7. 14. speaks not of federall holiness, but
matrimonial; yea if the reason of the lawfulness of the living of two persons
together in disparity of Religion, be taken from the virtue of faith in the one
party, not from the relation of husband and wife, as Mr Marshals exposition
makes it, the medium of the Apostle to prove the lawfulness of the living of a
believing wife with an unbeleeving husband, will as well prove the lawfulnes of
the living of a believing forni^atrix with an unbeleeving fornicator; as may
appear by a syllogisticall analysis of the Apostles argument: the major
whereof is this, according to Mr Marshals exposition. That man and wo^an may
lawfully dwell together, notwithstanding the unbeleefe of the one party whereof
one is sanctified by the faith of the other for begetting of a holy seed; this
is manifestly the force of the Apostles reason after his exposition. Nor is it
necessary to insert [ being husband and wife] since the sanctification is not
ascribed by him to the relation of husband and wife, but to the faith of the
one party, as the proper cause of it. And by Mr Blake Birth. privilege, page
11. Holiness in the text, is a fruit or result of faith in the parent. Now the
assumption; the unbeleeving form catour is sanctified by the faith of the
^eleeving whore for the begetting a holy seed Master Marshall denies not, but
salkes only; telling me page 163 of his Defense, he could name Divines who are
no whit infer^^ur to my self, who conceive that a believer even then when he
commits fornication with an infidel, does so remove the bar in the
unbeleeving party, as that the child is (in the believing parents right) to be
r^ckoned to belong to the Covenant of Grace, and the Church of God, which is in
his sense to be sanctified; and it must needs be granted, for (...) causa
ponitur effectus, if the quality of faith be the cause of that sanctification,
the sanctification follows in one, as well as the other. The conclusion then
follows from Mr Marshals exposition, that the believing fornicatrix may still
live after conversion, with her unbeleeving fornicator; for they are still
sanctified for the begetting of a holy seed; and the children so begotten are
federally holy, it being Gods rule in this case: if Mr Marshall say true,
partus sequitur meliorem partem. But this is so absurd a thing that I believe
Mr Marshall himself will when he understands it* quit his chief hold, and the
judicious reader explode the exposition of 1 Cor. 7. 14. of federall holiness.

And for the third conclusion of Mr Marshall, he has not yet proved that the
rite of Baptism was appointed by Christ to succeed into the room, place, and
use of circumcision; or that a command concerning circumcision, should be a
command concerning baptism: yea my exposition of Colos. 2. 11, 12. is
acknowledged right by Mr Marshall, and consequently his inference overthrown,
as I said above. Baptism and the rite of eating bread and drinking wine
through old ^ites among the Jews yet used to another end, and after another
rule by Christians.
As for that which I alleged that Baptism was an old rite among the Jews in
initiating Proselytes, to show that baptism in exact speech does not succeed
circumcision, but is a continuation of an old rite to another purpose; as in
exact speech the Lord does not succed the Pas^^over, but is an old rite used at
the Paschall supper among the Jews, and contin^ed by Christ to another
purpose; Mr Marshal catches at as a proof for Infant Baptism, because then
the Proselytes children were baptized: page 256. But the answer to it is easy.
For though the rite of Baptism was an old use continued by John Baptist and
Christ. yet I say it was to another purpose or use; as I show, page 89. 90. of
my Examen, clean of another nature; as Mr Lightfoot Harmony, part. 1. page 138.
and was used according to another rule then among the Jews. For they did not
baptize Jews either elder or younger as the same learned men I cited confess,
but only the Gentiles because they were unclean; and they were initiated by
sacrifice as well as baptism, with many other differences: but John the
Baptist and Christ's Disciples baptized Jews as well as Gentiles, without
sacrifice.

As for Mr Marshals fourth conclusion, he confesses page 128. that the formal
reason of the Jews being circum^^sed was the command, which if true; it is the
distinguishing and constituting reason, qua posita ponitur res, The command
confessed to be the formal reason of circumcision by Mr Marshall.
non posita non ponitur; so that the Jews ought to be circumcised because of
the command, without a command what ever were their interest in the Covenant or
Church State, they were not to be circumcised. Now this is as much as need be
to overthrow Mr Marshals argument, which is to prove that infants are to be
baptized precisely by virtue of interest in the Covenant without a command,
because as he supposes the Jews infants were circumcised merely by virtue of
the Covenant; for so the analogy or proportion in his reasoning must hold. The
Jews infants were in the Covenant, and therefore were to be circumcised; Ergo,
it must be so with believers children now in Baptism; where the formal reason
is supposed to be the Covenant: but Mr Marshall both page 92. and page 182.
confesses the formal reason is the command; and therefore though the Covenant
be pu^, yet if the command were not put, circumcision of infants ^ad been no
duty, but a will worship; and by parity of reason it is so in baptism: infants
are not to be baptized barely by virtue of Covenant-holinesse without a
command; which is the main thing I contend for.

As for the fifth conclusion of Mr Marshall, that which I answered continues
still, Circumcision a privilege proper to the Jewish Church state.
that circumc^sion though it were a privilege to the Jewish Church, as the
Arc, ^abernacle, high Priest, Temple were, b^longing to that national
Church State, to have themselves and infants circumcised; yet it was a
privilege proper to that time not now to continue: as the Apostle, Gal. 3. and
4. Heb. 9. and 10. shows, it did not belong to the substance of the Covenant
of grace common to Jews and Gentiles; and so neither is it or any thing in the
room of it any more a privilege to us now then some house the room of the
Temple: some chief Bishop in the room of the High Priest, etc. And therefore I
say still, that this argument is indeed of no weight, but among vulgar and
non-syllogizing capacities; and that Divines that use it do but flatter the
people by it; and that if the reason be good, it overthrowes our compleatnesse
in Christ, in whom we have Circumcision, Arc, Temple, Priest, all; and as I
said in my Exercitation it is the very egg out of which most of the Popish
^eremonies were hatched; to wit, because they thought we must have privileges
as the Jews, and therefore must have something like that they had.

Mr Marshall, page 195. of his Defense, speaks thus. First for the point of
will worship I shall desire you to prove this conclusion. That all things
belonging to christian worship even in the circumstances of it, even the ages
and sexes of the persons to whom the ordinances are to be applied, must be
expressly set down in the new Testament; if you prove not this, you say
nothing to the purpose, for this is our very case. To which I reply. That I owe
not M. Marshall such service, as to prove what he shall like another Eurystheus
enjoin me: I have page 11^. page 152 of my Examen syllogistically set down my
argument to prove Infant Baptism will worship, it belongs to him to tell me
what he denies in my syllogism, that I may prove it, though I have already
done it, and shall do more fully when he tells me what he does deny: but it is
a mere shift for him to impose on me the proof of a Proposition I own not,
and not tell me what he denies in my own syllogism. This is contrary to the
rules of disputation I have been acquainted with; yet if Mr Marshall shall
declare that he holds the subject of baptism to be but a circumstance, I shall
be ready to oppose him therein further; and show that the point in difference
is not the bare age or sex, but qualification of persons to be baptized; yea
the reason and main use of Baptism.

As for Mr Marshals principle for his virtuall command I have showed above; No
command about the Jews Sacraments now in force.
that when he should have brought all Protestant Divines averring this maxim,
that all the commands and institutions of God about the Sacraments of the
Jews; bind us as much as they did them in all things which belong to the
substance of the Covenant, and were not accidental to them: in stead of this
he alleges another thing, that Protestant Divines make the same general
nature, end and use of our Sacraments, and the Jews Sacraments, and argue
thereupon from one to the other, which is quite beside the business. For the
maxim is of commands about the Sacraments, and they are all about the rituals
or administrations, and concerning commands about the Sacraments, binding us as
the Jews, he produces not one command binding us, or one Protestant avowing
it.

As for the command, Matthew. 28. 19. when I said, (...) signifies to make
Disciples, but no where are infants said to be discipled, Mr Marshall tells me
that some learned critics say that (...), answers to an hebrew phrase among
the Rabbis, Infants not Disciples, as Matthew. 28. 19. is meant.
of admission of scholars that they may be taught; which though I believe not,
yet if it were granted serves not Mr Marshals turn, unless he can show that
infants were said by them to be thus admitted-schollars. Then Mr Marshall
referres me with a blind direction to Spanheimius, whom I have consulted, and I
find many absurdities in that learned Authors words dub. Evang. part. 3. dub.
27. This in effect he says that (...) contains not the act the Disciples were
to do, but the end of their sending, which I think is so absurd that it needs
no other refutation then the mention, and then that they might (...) without
teaching them; whereas he himself says, non significat solum docere sed and
Discipulos facere, so that according to him it includes teaching and somewhat
more, and aequipollet (...) Io: 4. 1. which was by teaching, and the parallel
place, Mark 16. 15. is, preach the Gospel to every creature.

I had said in my Examen, that the speech of baptizing Lydia's household, Acts
16. 15. must be understood by other places which when they express the
baptizing of the household, Baptizing households inferres not infant baptism.
they express also the believing or receiving of the word by the whole
household, and by the frequent [ Mr Marshall alters it into sometimes] use of
the word, which is to put the house for the people of growth in it. Mr Marshall
says, who taught you it must be so interpreted? I answer, Augustine lib. 3. de
doct. Christ. c. 26. ubi autem ap^rtius ponu^tur ibi discendum est qummodo in
locis intelligantur obscuris: Cha^^ier panstrat, Cathol. tom. 1. lib. 16. c. 6.
and all those Divines among which I think Mr Marshall is one, that say we must
expound one text by comparing it with others that are like. To that I said,
that [house] is frequently taken for the grown persons in it; Mr Marshall
sai^^, it may very well be granted, and hurts not me, unless you can prove it
must be so meant. Though I think I proved it must be so meant, yet it is enough
to show that Mr Marshall cannot prove from the baptizing of households an
example of baptizing an infant, since, the word house may be taken (as Mr. Mar.
says, may very well be granted) for the grown persons in that house.

As for Mr Marshals second argument, because there was an equivocation in it*
and in one sense the major must be denied, in another the minor; and if the
major be understood in one sense, the minor in another; there be four terms,
and the syllogism is naught. To this Mr Marshall makes no reply in a logical
form, but tells us in a loose discourse, that forasmuch as there is no
infallible ground of certainty, but only of charity, that any grown person to
be baptized has actually the inward grace; and so in charity ^ee are to
conceive of believers infants, because Christ said, Mark 10. 14. Of such is the
kingdom of God, they are to be baptized So that in his Defense Mr Marshall
alters his argument which he set down in his Sermon, concluding not from a
capacity of inward grace to Baptism as he did then; but from the judgment of
charity that they have actually the inward grace, We have no evidence for
judgment of charity concerning infants, nor is a judgment of charity to be
our rule in adminstering Baptism.
which he seems to count sufficient for Baptism. Mr Geree his reasoning is to
the same effect: vindic. paedobapt. chapter 1. sect. 7. and is thus formed by him
into a syllogism, where we have evidence for judgment of charity, that there
is the grace of the Covenant, there we may s^e the seal of the Covenant. But we
have evidence for the judgment of charity, that in infants of believers there
is the grace of the Covenant. Ergo, Of this Syllogism I deny both major and
minor. Acts 10. 47. does not provethe major. For the Apostle there did not
baptize upon a judgment of charity of what was latent, but from a certain
sense of their magnifying God, and the gift of the holy Ghost; nor was Simon
Magus baptized because in the judgment of charity he had the grace of the
Covenant, but because he professed the faith, which was certain to Philip. And
this was Master Marshals doctrine in his Sermon, page 47. where he confesses
that the Apostles charity or charitable conjecture was not the ground of their
admitting them to the ordinance, but the profession and confession of the party
made according to the word, which they were bound to rest in. And therefore I
see not how Mr Marshall can count a judgment of charity sufficient for
Infant Baptism, without crossing himself in his first Sermon. For my part I
do not think a Minister ought to be ruled in baptizing by his own judgment of
charity (which is ofttimes very uncharitable to those that deserve best) but by
certain knowledge of true sanctification by extraordinary revelation, or of the
parties profession of the faith by other means, either of which is sufficient,
not both necessary. Nor do I require of infants more assurance then of grown
men, but shows of repentance and faith in either. Yet, as when one being
required to bring no more then a servants testimony for the grant of a thing,
if he bring the masters hand and seal without the servants testimony and the
thing be granted; he that grants it does require no more then the servants
testimony: so when I say, if shows of repentance and faith be exhibited I will
baptize, and I will baptize upon extraordinary revelation, that an infant is a
believer: I do not require more assurance of an infant then of a grown
person, when I say, if the infant profess the faith, I will baptize, if God
witness for it that it is a believer I will baptize, in neither go I by
judgment of charity, but certainty either of revelation or profession, which
neither Master Geree nor Master Marshall can make good of all the infants of
believers. But says Master Geree there is evidence in charity to judge that the
children of believers have the grace of the Covenant. To this I answer, the
evidence for judgment of charity is to be taken from a persons own deeds
according to the rule, 1 Cor. 13. 7. charity believes all things, capacity of
grace is common to all persons on earth, and therefore is no ground to baptize
one more then another. That some infants have been actually partakers of inward
grace, as Mat. 19. 14. Luke 1. 15. Ierem. 1. 5. yields nothing to prove any
judgment to be right that it is so in any other, but only that it may be so.
Infants of believers are not under the Covenant of Grace or within the
external administration of it, by virtue of Genesis 17. 7. Deuteronomy. 30. 6. they
speak of more then external administration* and must be understood of the
elect which the Apostle denies to have bin ever by God assured to the natural
seed, Romans 9. 8. 15. no judgments of charity that the infants of believers are
under the Covenant of Grace can be deducted from these texts, the most is
conjecturall hope that it shall be so, which experience shows to miscarry
often, therefore these things yield not a warrant for infantbaptisme. Doctor
Homes argues from Matthew. 19. 14. that baptizing did in nature antecede
imposition of hands, which is false; nor does Heb. 19. Of Master Hassey his
pretended satisfactory answer to my exerci^ation.
6. 2. prove it. Nor is his argument good, Infants had the greater Christ's
blessing, therefore they had or might have the less, to wit Baptism; which
reason if good, it would follow they might have the Lords Supper, be ordained
Ministers: for these are less then Chris^s blessing.

Before the printing of this Apology, I met with and read a book of one Mr
William Hussy a man unknown to me saving by a former treatise of his which I
have seen, and he intitles it satisfaction to Master Tombs his scepticall
exercitation: and in his Epistle to the Reader he says, and here I will turn
sceptique with Master Tombs. If I should give him the title of fantastic in
requital of the title of skeptic he pins upon me, I could give better reason
for it then he brings for his imposition of that new title on me: but it is
enough for me to clear my self. Gel. l. 11. c. 5. noct. Attic. says, the
^y^honian Philosophers were called Skeptics; that is, seekers and
considerers, because they determined nothing, but were always in considering
and seeking; but Master Marshall thinks me guilty rather of too much
selfe-confidence. Yea in this point though I did as I conceived befitting me
then, propound my thoughts in the disputation with my brethren in the
ministry, and in my Exercitation to the Committee of the Assembly under the
term of doubts; yet in my Examen I assert them as positions, and therefore that
author does unworthily entitle my Exercitation scepticall, or me a skeptic:
which is in effect if he understood what he says, to accuse me as adhering to
nothing as certain in matters of sense, reason, or faith. But concerning the
book though he entitle it satisf^action* and the licenser says [finding it to
be in his judgment solid and judicious] and I am pretty well acquainted with
the humor of men, who are ready to cry up any thing as satisfactory, which
they affect; yet I believe the Assembly will not conceive his book
satisfactory, nor these passages following to be solid and judicious. As that
in his Epistle to the Reader he calls Baptism the seal of the proffer of
Grace. page 3. I answer, that was an especial privilege of the Jews that
they had their civil laws from God, but what lies upon a nation as a duty
that it may require of all, and cuts off them that refuse! and this is employed
in the Commission, when Nations shall covenant to be Discip^^s, which may be
done by a part for the whole, then are such ^ are in commission from Christ
commanded to baptize and teach the whole nation, such as are in authority may
covenant in a national (...) for the inferior sort, and justly require all
external performances from them, such as baptism and submission to b^e taught

duty, ^ that may the parents of the country, the Magistrates require of the
nations. God requires it of them, they may put all nations to school to
Christ, Now, what if some of them be too young to learn, yet if they be under
the discipline of the Master they are Scholars? as may appear in many little
children that are set to school to keep them safe, and from wantonness,
before they be of capacity to learn, many have a Hornbooke given, more for a
playgame then a book, yet are they Scholars, because under the discipline and
correction of the Master; is it not therefore great reason, that a Christian
should dedicate his child^^ to Christ, to be partaker of the blessing and
discipline of Christ? page 5. And certainly words could not have been invented
that could have required the Ministers to baptize all the World, Infants and
all, willing or unwilling; so that any would see they might be taught, and
submit to the precepts and discipline of Christ, then to express it by the
word nation and d^sciple. page 12. Abraham's seed must be divided into
equivocall and univocall; equivocall seed Christ, for that he was not like
Abraham, he was of Abraham, but ex part according to the flesh. Romans 1. 3. He
was the promised seed, not the seed unto whom the promise did belong, as the
seed of Abraham. page 43. That which we argue from receiving of families, and
from the Apostles commission to baptize nations is, that nations may make Laws
for their whole nations to be baptized; and if the major part of a nation do
according to their duty receive baptism, and undertake for the whole nation to
submit themselves to become Scholars of Christ, they may justly compel by any
penalty to join with them in the external worship of God. This therefore is
it which is drawn from the commission directed to the Disciples for the
baptizing of nations, that nations may act as nations, and families as
families; that is, that the more organ^all parts must act for the residue* the
magistrates for the nation, the master of the family for the residue, the
magistrates for the nation, the master of the family for the family; otherwise
it cannot be said to be the act of the nation, or of the family, though a post
factum may be historically related to overspread a nation that is done without
a national consent, to show the universality of a spreading evil: yet, where
a duty is charged upon a nation, it cannot be orderly received without a nation
^ll consent. page 44. He that keeps any servant that will not be baptized, is

refuse, as it is with God, to punish with eternal death such as despise
baptism. Nor do I think the principal ground of his new conceit page s. will
satisfy, which is, that Matt. 28. 19. is thus to be expounded, make all
Nations Disciples by baptizing them, and teaching: whereas he himself sundry
times reads it better, make Disciples of all nations baptizing them, and it is
vainly alleged that [by] is employed in the participiall expression, any more
then verse 9. (...) must be expounded he met them by saying, or Matthew. 27. 55.
(...) they followed by ministering unto him; and I said justly, Examen page 127.
this conceit is so absurd, that I presume none that has any wit will entertain
it, though Master Hussy say page 6 I think if ever a man were out of his wit,
it was here: but I shall be willing the Assembly judge whether of us two need
sail to Anticyra to purge our brains. As for his answer to my book though I
conceive it lettice fit for some lips, yet in my apprehension it contains a
fardell of mistakes, in Logic, Divinity; and sometimes in Grammar, but most of
all of my meaning, and the scope of my words, and for^e of my reasons, which
being diligently compared with his book, are a sufficient reply to it. And
therefore though he conclude with a challenge to me, yet he must pardon me if
I make more account of my time then to cast it away in refusing such wild
notions as he has vented, except I shall have so much spare time as to write a
book to make sport with; wishing nevertheless that Master Hussy had some
school of Divinity as he desires, that he might be either better fitted to
write, or learn to be silent.

I have been larger in this matter then I intended at this time, 20. The
Epilogue of this Apology concerning the reason of the enlargement of it, the
Authors present estate and future intentions.
that I might show the vanity of Mr Leyes vaunt, and however God dispose of me,
do my endeavor to clear the truth in this thing, and to prevent persecution
of it through the provocation and exasperation of spirit toward
Anti-paedobaptists, which since these writings have been published, has many
ways discovered it self. If the Lord spare me life, liberty, and means, and
it be found necessary; I may either more briefly or more largely rescue my
treatises from their hands, who have ill handled them and perverted the truth.
In the mean time this which is already said might serve a judicious Reader to
answer the writing of my Antagonists though no more should follow. Mr Mar. book
it appears from page 59. 212. 227. was contrived by diverse: I believe the
ablest of the Assembly, I wish it were declared whether the Paedobaptists would
stick to that work or any other. I hear there are more yet to be printed, if
the aim be to oppress me with number, or to have this evasion; that when one
is answered, yet some other is not answered; and so to uphold the error still
(which is a way of Jesuits) I doubt not but God will defend his truth. What
hitherto is objected against my two Treatises and Appendix, I doubt not but
with Gods assistance to answer. Before I could finish this Apology, I have
tasted the fruits of Mr Marshals, and Mr Gerees accusation in a message from
the Benchers of both houses of the Temple; that though they acknowledge my life
and labors among them unreproveable, yet by reason of the publishing of my
treatises they cannot continue me here. It was foretold me, that some of the
assembly would not give over till they had outed me hence. If any of them have
dissuaded the people from hearing me, though they cannot show that I have
preached any other thing then Gospel truth; if they use any arts to withdraw
the people from me, I wish them to consider how they can acquit such actions
from the sin of making schism, and stopping the course of the Gospel for
their own ends, not permitting any to preach the Gospel without concurrence in
opinion with them, when as Paul rejoiced that Christ was preached; though it
added affliction to his bonds, Phil. 1. 18. what my desire was in the Prologue
of my Examen, is still, that we may give one another the right hand of
fellowship, and stand fast in one mind in the truth of the Gospel, and clear
the truth of God to the people whose eyes are upon us. I may call God to
witness that my aim in making and publishing my Treatises, was the benefit of
the Assembly by making known to them reasons why the Doctrine of the Directory
should be better examined, which would be their honor: if they disclaim me,
reject me, repay evil for good, I hope God will help me to bear it, and to
love them still, and join with them in promoting the work of Christ;
notwithstanding I meet with discouragements where I assured my self greatest
encouragement.

To conclude; as the case now stands, I know not into what corner of the (...)
world God may carry me, nor how I may be accommodated to publish any thing more
either in this of Infantbaptisme, or any other point of sacred knowledge; it is
not a little comfort to me that I have framed this Apology, it shall be my
witness in time to come that I have sought unity with truth; and as I have
made it my business to preserve purity of doctrine, so I shall still though I have
neither found recompense nor help considerable from men, but rather am likely
to meet with a consumption of estate, and a shortning of my days. However
things succeed, I shall request that they that can pray, would beg for me that
I may do nothing against the truth, but for the truth; and for the Churches of
Christ, that the Pastors and teachers in them may take heed of bending their
wits to maintain what the prime reformers, and Churches ordered by them have
avouched, rather then impartially and thoroughly to examine their doctrine,
which as it is a great sin of making other masters then Christ, so it is a
cause of most mischievous rents and contentions.

FINIS.
A Postscript, wherein is a reply to Mr. Blakes answer to my letter.
Reader.
BE pleased to take notice,, 1. The occasion of this postscript.
that whereas I say p. 21. of this Apology. Molin in his Epistle to Bishop
Andr^w^^ (if my memory deceive me not) confessed is to have been (...) ipsis
Apostorum temporib^^, meeting since the printing of that passage, with the
book I find that in that Epistle he only confessed it to have been a secule
Apostolis proximo, but Bishop Andrews says, he had put out that which
elsewhere he said ab Apostolorum sicul^. Whence my mistake of memory conceiving
he had said it there, which he said elsewhere, but altered it in that Epistle.
2. That though I had seen most of the latter part of Mr. Blakes answer to my
letter have days before, yet I had not the whole book till Aug. 3. 1646, at
which time the tenth s^eet of this Apology was printing off; and therefore I
cannot give thee so large (...) on it, as I desired to do; yet I have thought
it (...) say thus much in this straight of time, as not knowing how I may be
here^^ fitted to write any more.

The Book is ^hered with a preface of Mr. Calmys and Mr. (...), 2. Of Mr.
Calamys and M. Vines their wrong judgment of the dispute, Mr. Blakes book, and
my discussing the point.
in which they say. The right of Infants to baptism is ear^^ strongly by (...)
arguments, if leg it (...) couse quener can make a (...) evidence. To which I
say, that Master Marshals first argument is accounted the strongest, and that
is far from being (...), as has been showed above.

They say The (...) of the Church in all ages in baptizing them is (...) by
such unde^^ testimonies of credible witnesses, that he that does not see it may
well be called Strabo, that is, goggle eyed.

How true this is the Reader may perceive by the Examen of Master Marshals
Sermon, and this Apology. The best or rather only witness of ancients for such
a practice is August^n concerning whom how little reason there is to count his
speech and undiable has been before declared here, and in the Examen.

They say of the Birth-priviledge of Master Blake: where thou shall find the
question so truly stated, and set upon the right Basis, and so well fortified,
that though there has been a dust raised (by some who have a better faculty to
raffle and intricate an argument than to wind it off) yet there is not the
least wing of it routed. To this I say, the state of the question has small
difficulty, little or no disagreement between me and Master Marshall, and Master
Geree, and I think the like of others. If by the Basi^ is meant Master Blakes
observation page 3. of the Birth-priviledge, A people that enjoy Gods
ordinances convey to their issue a (...) to be reputed of a society that is
holy, to be numbered amongst not ^ncleane, but holy. This observation is
ambiguous, it may be true in a sense, that it so happens frequently; but if it
be meant in this sense, that they convey by their generation of them a right of
visible Church Membership, and title to the initiall seal, as it is usually
called it is not true: which only serves for the purpose. Now the wings by
which that observation is fortifyed out of the new Testament, (wherein the
strength lies) are Acts 2. 38. 39. Romans 11. 16, 17. 1 Pet. 2. 9. Gal. 4. 29.
Gal. 2. 15. 1 Cor. 7. 14. now for three of these to wit 1 Pet. 2. 9. Gal. 4.
29. Gal. 2. 15. they fly of themselves, the first expressly being spoken of
them only that believe, v. 7. the second to wit, being born after the flesh,
cannot be understood as importing a privilege or benefit, it being spoken of
persons to the worser sense, and causing a casting, out of the inheritance: the
third is meant not of a Jew allusively so called, but of a Jew by natural
generation, opposed to a Gentile, and so cannot be said of the children of
believing Gentiles; nor can all Master Blakes words keep them from running out
of the field. The text Acts 2. 39. if it be understood (as it must) of the
promise of saving graces by Christ cannot be verified of any but those that are
called, which it being confessed to limit the first, branch of the
Propposition, and the last, you, and as many as are afar off; it is to me
against reason and truth that it should be left out in the middle, that is,
that when it is said the promise is to you, and to all that are afar off
being called, it should be asserted in that branch that is between, the promise
is to your children whether called or not. Of Romans 11. 16, 17. I have said
sufficiently before. Of 1 Cor. 7. 14. somewhat also before: and intend more in
this postscript. If Mr Calamy and Mr. Vines accuse me of raising a dust, and
raffling and intricating an argument (which I imagine they do because the
raising of a dust is Master Marshals phrase) they are answered in this Apology.
My entering into the lists with Mr Marshall was not out of choice as valuing my
self, as they mistake; but out of necessity lead thereto by providence of God.
How well I have acquitted my self may appear by the bringing of Master
Marshall to many concessions which overthrow his first argument. Whether this
answer of Master Blake be sinewy for argument, I hope in time to examine. I
conceive that to put the question upon the right Basis, is to examine whether
the formal reason why the Jews were circumcised, were their interest in the
Covenant? whether there be the same Church State now that was then? whether any
command about the Jews Sacraments now bind us? But I pass to Mr Blakes answer.

Mr Blake charge me with defect and neglect of charity. For the former I do
not take my writing to discover it, what I shall deprehend I have failed in, I
shall I hope confess to God, and to Master Blake when we meet. My not speaking
to Master Blake was, because I presumed Master Marshall had acquainted him with
the thing, and the reason of printing my Treatises as they were is declared
above. Why I would not take upon me the place of opponent in the dispute with
my brethren I gave the reason, because the argument would presently lead them
to oppose; this being al my argument against Infant Baptism that I could well
urge in dispute, that it is not appointed by God, and so presently upon one or
two syllogismes they must become opponents again, since affirmanti incumbit
probatio; I sent not my Exercitation to my opponents because I was advised to
send to the Committee, named in the Prologue of my Examen; the rest is answered
in the Apology.

To the point of antiquity in Chapter 2. I think not needful to add any more
here. To the third chapter sect. c. Master Blake because I said Examen page
144. these I mention, that you may see what stuff Paedobaptists do feed the
people with, does the^^ against reason, and charity infer, that I branded
therein all the Ministers of Christ that ever held Infant Baptism, whereas my
speech being indefinite should in such a contingent matter have been
interpreted only as equipollent to a particular proposition, (...) the words
were used only of that Author, and such as delivered like doctrine, with
particular exception of Master Marshall, and many others there named. Passion I
confess was in me sometimes in writing my examen, a mixed passion of grief,
and indignation, that Preachers of the Gospel should be so hard, as then I
found, and saw likely would be more; to their dissenting brethren upon such
weak reasons. But such contu^^licus consurer and practices as Master Blakes
sinister conceits p^t upon me I deny.

To the second section I answer,. 4. They that deny Infant Baptism need not
teach that Infants perish.
that I still conceive, they that deny Infant Baptism, and grant original
sin, are (...) necessitated to say that Infants perish in their births^^. It
is true as Master Blake says, they that will hold a certainty of the salvation
of such Infants, they must maintain a promise or covenant to them; but such a
covenant I deny to be made as assures salvation to the Infants of believers:
and I have proved at large, Examen part. 3.. 4. there is not such a Covenant.
If that Genesis 17. 7. be produceed I have proved that it was particularly spoken
of Abraham's feed, expounded Romans 9. 8. not to be meant of his natural feed,
but spiritual, and therefore till it be proved that all Infants of believers
dying in Infancy, are Abraham's spiritual feed; that promise will not infer
the certainty of their salvation. Therefore, this is my judgment: that God
will have us to suspend our judgment of this matter, and to rest on the
Apostles determination. Romans 9. 18. But they that hold that there is no
certainty of their salvation, are not necessitated to hold a certainty of their
perdition, for there is a medium between both, a hope though not certain, yet
probable, and comfortable, that the children of believers dying in their
Infancy are saved; taken from some general indefinite promises: the favor of
God to the parents, and the experience that in all ages has been had of his
merciful dealing with the children of his servants; all which cannot be said
of the Infants of Infidels, though on the other side we must not so exclude the
Infants of Infidels, as to affirm that none of them are saved. For though the
Gentiles were without hope Ephesians. 2. 12. in respect of the body of them, yet
now and then God called some, as Rab^^ out of the visible Ch^^ch, and therefore
we may not determine universally that out of the visible Church there is no
sal^^tion at all: but leave this to Gods free will. It does not (...) follow,
tha^ beathens have equal hopes of sal^^^ion with Infants of (...). For though
they have not hopes from their innocence in themselves, or certain interest in
Christ; yet they have more probable hopes of interest in Christ upon the g^^^ds
(...). And thus is that section answered.

The fourth chapter is about my censure of his argument from Gal. 5. Of my
censure of Master Blakes producing Gal, 4. 29 for the birth privilege.
41* 29. as containing very gross passages. He ace^seth me as one that
intended not any (...), because I bring but one branch of the (...) in his
argument, and yet call it his medium, But ^ith I intended not a full answer to
him but to Master Marshall it was enough that I only reci^ed that in which was
indeed the strength of his argument, which was that birth after the flesh,
ascribed to some now, Gal. 4. 29. imports a privilege, (...) Church int^^st to
(...) the bos^^ of the Church of Christians. In saying this was very gross, I
said no more then that which was right: the Apostle opposing persons borne
after the flesh, to them that are borne after the spirit, to be cast out, and
not to inherit. But says Master Bl^ke, you shut out the literal sense of
birth after the flesh, both from the history, and parallel, and bring a^
allagericall (...) in both, when the (...) in the text is evident. I answer, I
shut not out the literal sense from the history, but from the parallel; and
that i^ so far from being contrary to the text, that it is expressly said,
these things are (...) (...). But he further objects: you make birth after the
flesh, and birth of the spirit, two contradistinct species of births, that both
cannot be incident (...) it is the distribution of a subject (...) I answer, I
make them not only contradistinct, but also contra^^; and I deny that it is a
distribution (...) For them the same person should be both borne after the
flesh and after the spirit. which I would tell Master Blake to be very absurd,
but that I would give him no more occasion to say I do insult, whoop, and
jeere, which he unjustly charge on me. And for that he says, that Isaac was
borne after the flesh, (though it be true, he was so in the two senses Master
Blake mentions which are nothing to this place of the Apostle) it is untrue in
the Apostles sense, for then he should be the child of the bondmayd; not by
promise, a persecutor to be cast out not to inherit, and a type of legal
justiciaries belonging to the covenant in mount Sinai, for all these things are
true of him that is borne after the flesh, Gal. 4, 22, etc. But the Apostle
does not say, that they are cast out, but mentions a command of casting them
out. As if Gods dictum were not factum: if they were not cast out, why does the
Apostle allege that text? But they are in the Church, otherwise they could not
be cast out. I answer, I deny not but legal institiaries may be in the visible
Church, as Ishmael in Abraham's house; though the Apostle make the parallel only
in the casting out that they might not inherit, but if Master Blake would
gather any thing hence for his purpose, he must prove that the Apostle makes
some to be in the visible Church, by virtue of being borne after the flesh as
their prerogative, which is as wide from the Apostles meaning, as East and
West. But says Master Blake where I pray you, do I make suoh Abraham's seed? it
is no gross error of mine, but a gross device or calumny of yours. I answer,
his words [ if there yet remain in the bosom of the Church children borne
after the flesh, so that distinction of births (as applied to Abraham's seed)
still has place amongst believing Christians]. 6. Or the necessity of my
taking pains in my Examen to find out the meaning of Mr. Marshals second
conclusion by reason of the ambig^ity of his expressions.
show that he applied birth of the flesh to Abraham's seed, else why are those
words put in [ at applied to Abraham's seed] but to show a double seed of
Abraham, one borne after the flesh, which is all one with the Apostle as legal
institiaries, another borne after the spirit, which is all one as bebeleevers?
so that this is Master Blakes tergiversation, not my calumny.

In The fifth chapter Mr Blake complains, that I take more pains then needs
to find out Master Marshals meaning in his second conclusion, and after. And
indeed I never saw a learned man so run himself into a maze needlessly, as you
in this discourse do; being at a stand; you say, whether Master Marshall means
a covenant of grace, or outward ordinances, as though these two were opposite,
and privilege of ordinances were not of grace, or that saving grace could be
had, in Gods ordinary way, without this privilege. To acquit my self of this
imputation, I say, that it was very necessary to take that pains I did, to
bring my self out of that maze which I had not run my self into; but the
confusednesse and ambiguity of Master Marshals expressions lead me into. Master
Marshall had made this the anteceedent in his first argument, The Infants of
believing parents are faederati, or within the covenant of grace; This I
conceived to be the same with his second conclusion, though against the rule of
dispute he varies the term [ faederati, or within the covenant of grace] into
this, [ he would have to be accounted his, to belong to him, to his Church and
family, and not to the Devils] which I do not take to be equipollent. This
necessitated me to show the many senses of his words, and to take pains to
find out his meaning; else I, knew not what to deny, or what to grant. Now, to
clear the matter: when it is said, Infants of believers are faederati, or in
the covenant of grace, this may be understood three ways. 1 They are in the
covenant of grace by their own act of covenanting, because they promise the
performance of the condition on their part, and this sense is manifestly false;
and yet when Master Marshall says they are to be accounted covenanters, he
speaks as if he meant so: For what is a covenanter but he that makes a
promise? 2 They are in the covenant of grace by the administratours act,
because he gives them the seal of the covenant; but then the second conclusion
should be, they are baptized or to be baptized, now this being the same with
the antecedent of Master Marshals first argument, his argument must be thus;
Infants of believers are baptized, or to be baptized, ergo they are to be
baptized, which is merely to trifle: and yet as I showed above, this is the
effect of Master Marshals arguing, who will have his second conclusion, and
antecedent understood of the outward covenant, as he calls it. 3 They are in the
covenant of grace by Gods act of promise, and this is that which Master
Marshall should have said, if he would have spoken plainly without
equivocation, God by his promise to the Infants of believers puts them in the
covenant of grace, or he accounts them in the covenant of grace, because he
has promised grace (...) them, and not have said God would have them accounted
his by us, by giving them the outward covenant, as he calls it. Now, if he
affirm this, that God has promised grace to Infants of believers, this grace
is either saving grace, or outward ordinances. But says Master Blake these are
not opposite, but sub^^dinate. Be it so, yet they are distinct, and the promise
of the one is not a promise of the other: the promise of the Word and
Sacraments, is not a promise of the Spirit. Now here was the doubt, whether
Master Marshall affirm a promise of saving grace to believers Infants, or of
outward ordinances. I said neither was true, yet the former was more agreeable
to his meaning. To prove this I alleged, that though sometimes Master
Marshall, Master Blake and others spoke more warily, (in which I dealt heartily
with Master Blake, reciting his express words full enough for the purpose) yet
I said most of Mr. Marshals and others expressions, and one expression of
Master Blake spoke as if they meant that God had made a covenant, or promise of
saving grace. And to prove it to be their meaning: produced their allegation of
these textes, Acts 2. 39. Genesis 17. 7. Matt. 19. 14. which are to be understood
of saving grace, and that otherwise the seal would be put to a blanke, and
that Master Blake says, God promises to be a God in covenant to his and their
seed, which people in covenant have also a promise from him of the Spirit. Now
what says Master Blake to this, he denies not that these texts speak of a
promise of saving grace, but asks me hows they are meant, whether absolutely
or immediately? and then fastens upon me an assertion that is none of mine, and
I believe wrongs Master Blackwood too. But herein Master Blake goes from the
business, and instead of a respondent becomes a poser^^ proved these texts
alleged by them for Infants being in the covenant of grace speak of a promise
of saving grace, and therefore if Master Marshall mean not that the covenant
of saving grace is made to a believers child, these texts are alleged to no
purpose by him. This is no place to answer Mr. Blakes unpertinent questions;
which he propounds to me as supposing that because I said, the texts are
plainly meant of saving graces, therefore I had affirmed the Jews and all
their seed had an absolute, promise of a saving grace: let Master Blake tell us
whether in alleging Genesis 17. 7. Acts 2. 39. for infants of believers being in
the Covenant, he understand not those texts of a promise of saving grace, which
is all I there contend for. As for Mat. 19. 14. it is pl^^^ly meant of the
kingdom of glory; Luke 18, 16. 17 Mark. 10. 14, 15. And for the speech of
sealing to a blanke, etc. Whether it be true or false it was not material to
my purpose; but whether it show that he users of it assert a promise of saving
grace to believers. Mr Blake upon a mistake, that I had set down sundry things
as my assertions charge (...) as using Bellarmines argument, and s^ts down
his own answer out of Amesius, besides the b^sines who only alleged other
men's speeches to show their meaning. As for his own speech he endeavors to
make it good, which for present was not excepted against, but only alleged to
to show that even Mr Blake asserts a promise of saving grace to (...) of
believers, for a promise of the Spirit is such. But says Mr Blake, Some
promises (...) suppose a condition: such is the promise of the Spirit (...)
here I understand it, and you may see in Christ's words John 7. 39. in the
Apostle (...); Ephesians. 1. 13. To which I say that it is true of the special
gifts of the Spirit, or the increase, or comforts, or assurance of the Spirit;
as John 7. 39. Ephesians. 1. 13. they suppose a condition, but if he mean it of
the regenerating work of the Spirit, (as the words lead me to conceive he
meant) then the promise of the Spirit has no condition, as Doctor (...) proves
in many places particularly. The Synod of Dort ^^d Arl^, etc. part. 3. Sect. 6.
and it is clear, for if God have promised regenerating grace upon condition,
that condition must be performed either by himself or by the person to whom it
is ^^^ised; if the condition he to be performed by himself. it is all one with
an absolute promise; if by the person to whom it is promised, then something
may be done by a man that may procure Gods grace, and so gratia Dei datur
secundum merita nostra, which is Palagi^^sme. Now they that say the Covenant of
grace in respect of saving graces is made to a believers seed; must either
exclude the (...) promise in the Covenant of grace, Heb. 8. 10 of (...) God
(...) their hearts, without which he is not their God; or else hold that
promise absolute, and so al infants of beleivers (...) be (...) saved. Yet that
this is the common doctrine, (...) believers children have a promise of saving
graces, is manifest in that from hence they assert the certainty of their
salvation if they dye in infancy, not considering that if God have made such a
promise to a believers seed, it will as well assure the salvation of a
believers seed in old age as infancy; since in old age they are their seed, and
the promise in respect of regenerating grace, which brings with it all the
rest, must needs be absolute. And therefore the promises Deuteronomy. 30. 6. Isai. 54.
13. and such like must be restrained to the elect as our Savior does; John 6.
45. and Genesis 17. 47. is expounded by Paul, Rom 9. 8. I had said Mr Marshals
words must be understood as the words of the Directory, the promise is made to
believers and their seed; which is to be meant of the promise of saving grace.
Mr Blake conceives the meaning to be of the promises mentioned, that they are
the grace promised, but I perceive he did not or would not understand my words:
I did not speak of the word [ promises] in the direction for petition, that Mr
Marshals conclusion must interpreted by it; but of the word [ promise] in that
assertion in the doctrinall part [ the promise is made to believers and their
seed] which cannot be interpreted of the thing promised; but Gods act of
promise, which is said to be made, to wit by him: before the promised is
obtained. So that this new devise will not serve the words of the Directory.

I had said. And that in that Covenant (Genesis 17. 7.) should be a promise to us
believing Gentiles (which words Mr Blake leaves out in the repetition) that to
our seed should be conferred visible Church Priviledges, etc. is but a dream,
etc. to this says M. Bl. This objection rises up against God himself, rather
then any one of your adversaries. But how this should rise up against God, Mr
Blake neither does nor can show: Mr Blake seems to run to his old shift, that
God promises Church Priviledges upon condition. If so, Cede conditionem. Let
Mr Blake set down that condition, and I doubt not but either to force him to
confess that the reason of the preaching the Gospel to some and their being
visible members, is something in man which will be Pelagianisme, or else Gods
promise is absolute; and so God not keeping it shall be guilty of
Faith-breaking. Master Marshall, page 127. of his Defense accuses me that I
sometimes say that Genesis 17. 7. was a promise peculiar to Abraham, at other
times it was at the utmost to be extended no further then to Abraham Isaac and
Jacob, to have their posterity (as born of them) to belong to the visible
Church. But Master Marshall wrongs me, I have neither of these Propositions in
either of my Treatises; what I conceive of it I have set down plainly, Exercit.
page 2. 3. But Master Marshall would have the promise, I will be the God of thy
seed as promising visible Church Membership to belong to the natural seed of
every believer. 1. because the Covenant was made to him for his Faiths sake.
Ans. if that were the motive, yet it follows not the promise belongs to every
believer as Abraham; no more then it follows, the promise, Matthew. 16. 18, 19.
was made to Peter by reason of his confession, verse 16. therefore it was made
to every one that confesses as Peter did, 2. How else should Proselytes
children have Church Membership. Answ. Not by virtue of that promise, but by
virtue of Gods command. Exodus 12. 48 To his third reason I have often answered
and proved, that Deuteronomy. 30. 6. Isai 44. 2, 3. Isai 59. 21. must be meant of the
elect, else how did God keep that promise when he did not circumcise the heart
of David's and Josiahs children. Master Marshall page 129. puts this upon me;
that I say God made this promise to Abraham Isaac and Jacob, to be the God of
them, and their seed. But I do not remember that I say so any where, nor that
the Scriptures says so though I meet with promises somewhat like it, Genesis 26.
24 Genesis 28. 4. 14. But these promises so far as they pertain to their
natural seed, were peculiar to them; and pertain not to every believer, and
his natural seed. For none of the Gentiles are Abraham's seed, but by Faith.
From all which I conclude, there is not a promise either of saving grace or
Church-priviledge made to the seed of believers, and so they are not certainly
in the Covenant of grace; in respect of Gods act of promising.

Master Blake says, What will you say of those that remembered that God was
their rock and the high God their redeemer; yet were not steadfast in his
Covenant: Psalm. 78. 35. 37. These were a people within Covenant. I say this to
it, that by his covenant is not meant Gods Covenant or promise to them, but
their Covenant to God; or rather Gods commands called metonymically his
Covenant.

Master Blake says, And where I pray you do you find those words that
christianity is hereditary? These are no words of mine but a supplement of
yours. I answer, these words are Master Blakes Birth-previledge, page 6. The
privileges which in (...) or nation are hereditary are conveyed from (...) to
posterity, the the child of a noble man is noble, so the child of a christian
is a christian, and this is all one as to say christianity is (...).

I pass by the vindicating of two speeches of mine in this chapter, because I
must hasten.

To the sixth chapter I have spoken so much as is needful before.

In the seventh Master Blake accuses me for abusing Master Thomas Goodwin,. 7.
Of the Corinthians doubt. 1 Cor. 7 12, 13 14.
but there is no abuse all; for my words only make use of Master Goodwins
expression, which Master Blake denies not to have been his, but that he altered
it, which may be unwitting to me. But for the thing I still say that the
Cerinthians doubt was not about their children. For that which is the doubt is
to be the conclusion of his argument that resolves it, but that which the
Apostle speaks of the Corinthians children, it is plain by the argumentative
particles [(...) else ware] is a medium of a syllogism, as Mr Blake page 37.
denies not; now (...) prob^^ est per notiora therefore it was not the thing ^^
doubt. Besides ver. 15, 16. following pertain to the resolution of the doubt
vers^ 12, 13.

which shows that they are all a continued resolution of the same doubt,
without any such immethodicall interposition of the resolution of another
doubt; as Mr Blake imagines.

As for the occasion of the scruple, since neither of our opinion^ is any other
then a conjecture, I let it pass. One passage of Mr Blakes in these words. And
I pray you speak what how you do believe, that the Corinthiane took it, for
a common received principle; that if a man had as adulterous wife, that his
children were legitimate, and not bastards; so it must be if you opinion pass
for a reason. I know not how he collects from my words; I say that the
Corinthians took it for certain that their own children were holy, that is
legitimate; and I say the force of the Apostles argument lies in this
Proposition, that all the children of those parents, whereof one is not
sanctified to the other, that is, do not lawfully couple together are unclean,
that is illegitimate; and that the Apostle says, the unbeleeving husband is
sanctified to the wife, that is, is lawfully used by his wife because he is
her husband, as if he had been holy: out of which, all the engines of Mr Blakes
wit cannot extort the inference he puts on my opinion.

In the second section Mr Blake says, 1 Cor 7. 14. is not meant of
isntrumental sanctification and federall holiness.
that I heard before Mr Goodwins Lectures of isntrumental sanctification. If
it were so, yet I profess I did never heed or know it so as to take notice of
it till I heard Mr Thomas Goodwin use the phrase. Mr Blake to my first argument
against isntrumental sanctification, says; And is not this argument of yours
of as great force against your interpretation of a matrimonial, as ours of an
instrument all sanctification? I answer no: for they that cannot beget children
may be said to be sanctified matrimonially, that is, may lawfully come
together; but not instrumentally so as to beget a holy seed, which is Master
Blakes sense. For they that by age or accidental inabilities cannot be
sanctified for generation, cannot beget children either by Covenant or
legitimate. Mr Blake adds. The sanctifying by the believing party here
mentioned, respects the issue which you confess in grounding a legitimation of
issue upon it. I grant where there is issue, the holiness of it depends on the
sanctification; but where there is sanctification, it is not always supposed
there is issue, or that there may be issue: to the begetting of which, they are
instrumentally sanctified. Mr Blake. This sanctifying (whether isntrumental or
matremoniall) has its influence upon the seed; such a brand lying upon all the
issue, where there is issue (be it bastardy or gentilisme) were enough to
conclude against such marriages, one principal end of marriage being posterity.
He supposes it seems, that uncleanenes is here meant, which is such a brand on
the issue as is enough to conclude against all such marriages. This is very
right, but I subsume that brand in all the issue where there is issue; which
were enough to conclude against all such marriages is bastardy, not gentilism.
For bastardy in the issue proves the supposed marriage not to be right, but
gentilisme in the issue concludes nothing against the marriage: Ergo, the
uncleanenesse here is bastardy, not gentilism. And thus he has unawares given
the medium of an argument against himself. To my second argument for
matrimonial sanctification, he says. I know you cannot ignorantly, and
therefore I fear you wilfully mistake, the meaning is, you may live together:
for all the seed you beg at are ^oly, infallibly, and necessarily holy, as the
seed of infidels (neither parent believing) are necessarily and infallibly
unclean; so that here is a future certainty, and not a contingency; and it is
not possible to imagine a morefull and (...) answer (...) which I say I am sure
Mr Blake is mistaken, whether ignorantly or wilfully, I determine not; for he
speaks of certainty of the holiness of the children in the latter part of the
verse, whereas the question is whether isntrumental sanctification for the
begetting a holy issue; of which the sanctification in the fore part of the
verse is expounded, be contingent or no: and this I am sure is true, and
therefore their lawful living together for present according to Mr Blakes
exposition should be taken from a future contingent, which Chamier truly
counted absurd, though as happy a Logician as he was, he foresaw not how it
served against himself. Bernardus non vider omnia.

To my third argument he says. Here you beg the question and reason flat
against the Apostle. That sanctifying which the Apostle mentions is aresult of
the faith of the believing yoke fellow, the unbeleever is twice said to be
sanctified, but not the believer; the believer does sanctify, if any sense can
be made of the Apostles argument. I answer. He begs the question, who supposes
what he should prove: Mr Blake does not, nor can show I do so; nor do I
reason flat against the Apostle; the Apostle no where says the sinctifying is
the result of the faith of the believing yoke fellow, if it were so, an
unbeleeving fornicatour might be said to be sanctified by his believing whore,
as well as a husband by his believing wife. The unbeleever is said twice to be
sanctified, because the doubt arose from his unbeleefe; but the says of the
believer is not at all expressed, to show that the faith did not sanctify, but
the relation. But if it were meant of isntrumental sanctification, it would
come from Gods designation, not the faith of the one party. For whose
instrument should he be that is sanctified for begetting a holy seed but Gods?
now to this nothing is answered, and so this argument stands good against Mr
Blake.

To my fourth argument he says. Understanding the Apostle of isntrumental
sanctification and of federall holiness, the proposition [their children could
not be holy without that sanctification] is most true, necessarily and
universally true, as the issue of such a birth, they are federally unclean and
unholy; if afterward by grace they are changed, this is no finit of their
birth, of which the question is in this place, but of the Gospel work in their
souls, To which I say the question is not here what is the fruit of birth, not
how the Proposition can be true understood of federall holiness, and
isntrumental sanctification. And I say it is most certainly false, for many a
child of both unbeleeving parents are federally holy. But says Mr Blake, they
are not so at their birth. But this is nothing to the purpose, since the
Proposition has not those words in it, no^ the Apostle. The Apostles reason
supposes it cannot be at any time. And yet it may be certain that the child
of two unbeleevers may be federally holy at birth whether it be understood of
election, inherent holiness, or outward holiness, if God please to work and
declare it. But the issue of them that are not lawfully conjoined as husband
and wife, cannot be made legitimate by God because it is contrary to the
definition of legitimation, which is a state consequent upon birth by the
lawful copulation of lawful husband and wife.

To my Analysis of the Apostle^ argument, Mr Blake says the last words, else
were, etc. may be a m^d^^, and a resolution of another doub^ (...): but that
cannot be, (...) it is an argument and that is (...) drawn from the thing in
doubt, (...) a (...); and that (...) which they would not yield, but the
contrary was certain to them.

Mr Blake mislikes not my forming the Apostles argument, but he excepts against
the Proposition I conceive the Apostles sequel p^supposeth; which is, All the
children of those parents whereof the one is not sanctified to the other, are
(...). To this faith Mr Blake, I appeal to your self, whether the truth of
that sequel, by you rightly laid down, do depend upon tha^ Proposition which
you draw from them I answer, it does. Mr Blake. Is the Apostle: (...)
Proposition of parents in general, (...) of (...) believing, and another
unbeleeving in particular? I answer, it is of an unbeleeving husband and a
wise. And yet the Proposition must be (...) be of all parents which must prove
it; as he that will prove, if an Englishman be noble he is honorable, must
prove it by this universal or (...). All noble men are honorable, and not put
in, all English (...) noble; for then the antecedent and conclusion would be
al^ong: whereas the Proposition proving must be larger then the Proposition
proved; else we might conclud^, ex meris (...). To (...) if the unbeleeving
^^^band were not sanctified by the wife your children were unclean, is all one
with this. All the children of the unbeleeving husband not sanctified to the
wife, are unclean. Mr Blake says, The truth of the Apostles sequel depends
on this Proposition; All the children of an nobeleever are unclean, unless for
generation, he or she be sanctified by a believer. I deny it, for the terms
for generation by a believer are added by him, not in the Apostle; and so he
changes the terms. Yet it is to be noted that though the Apostles major be of
husband and wife in particular, Mr Blake makes the Proposition on which it
depends of unbeleevers in general, and so by his own practife justifies me
against his own exception. 2. The Proposition Mr Blake lays down as upon
which the major in the Apostle syllogism depends. All the children of an
unbeleever are unclean, unless for generation be or she be sanct fied by a
believer, is false; and so is that which he says after. All those that are
borne of unbeleeving parents, and one of them not sanctified in the other, are
out of the Covenant of grace, yea the other is false too, according to Mr
Blakes opinion; unbeleeving parents never beget children by birth-priviledge
holy. For children born of infidels brought into Abraham's family had right to
circumcision, and so were by birth-priviledge holy in Mr Blakes sense. Mr Blake
tells me, the Apostles Proposition according to my interpretation is this. All
the children of an unbeleever are bastards, except in generation he or she be
sanctified by a believer. But this I deny: I have set down the Proposition
according to my interpretation plainly enough already.

My alleging Chamiers words against his opinion was no jeare, but a right way
of using an authors reasons against another, against his own opinion. And that
I did rightly, for these Propositions according to Chamiers explication are
included in the Apostles reason. omnes nati ex it is parentibus quorum al^ur non
sanctificatur in all ero sunt extra foedus gratiae. Nunquam parents infideles
gignunt liberos intra foedus gratiae fusuros. The adding [ futuros] was
necessary, because their being in the Covenant of grace is after their
begetting; if I had said, qui fuerunt nut sunt intra foedus gratiae, M. Blake
would justly then have had exception against me as not righly setting down
Chamiers conceit: now those Propositions of ^hamier are false; and consequently
his explication according to his own grounds. The putting in [ aut fornicantes]
was, because I would include both explications of the forepart of the verse,
both that of matrimonial, which I conceive was Beza's and that of
isntrumental sanctification. The using of the term rid^ca^lam, was no more a
jear of Chamier then his using of it a jeare of Augustine. But my An agonists
are so touchy, that expressions that are not so much as motes in other men's
eyes are beams in mine.

To the exceptions of Master Blake. page 40.. 9. Of M Blak^s m^sallegation of
Gal. 2. 15. which was the text he chose for his birth-priviledge.
I say, though I did not keep his words, yet I keep the effect of them. If he
use not the term Covenant of grace, yet I suppose he will not deny he meant
that which usually Divines express by it in this point, though Master Blake
thinks the word Covenant of grace cannot be found in his treatise for baptism,
yet if he please he may find the word Covenant of free grace, page 14. of his
birth-priviledge used to that purpose I ascribe to him where he says, the
holiness he maintains is from the Covmam of free grace to all in the faith,
and their seed. My explication of (...) meaning of the Apostles words Master
Blake says is almost the same with his in terminis. Then I have not wronged
the Apostle, and it follows the Apostle calls himself a Jewe by nature, as
tied to keep the law of Moses. Now I called it a dream to make Gal, 2. 15. 1
Cor. 9. 14. every way p^^ allel, they neither agreeing in scope, occasion,
words, nor matter, which are dissimilitudes enough. I grant his sense of the
word nature, and that the Apostle there speaks of himself and other. Jews as
in reputation more holy then the Gentiles, because of their interest in
circumcision and observance of Moses law, but this was proper to the Jews in
that Church State, who had prerogatives peculiar to them. Master Rutherford Due
right of Presbyteries. chap. 4. sect. 5. page 192. That they had prerogatives
above us is clear, Romans 3. 1, 2, 3. Romans 9. 4. But I deny that, a holiness of
birth flowing from a parent believing, and in Covenant is asserted, 1 Cor. 7.
14. The term sin^^^ of the Gentiles is not all one with unclean, 1 Cor. 7. 14.
B^^^ne chief thing he brings that text for, is to prove that our children have
a Covenant holiness because they are to be comprehended under the first member
of the distinction Jews by natu^^^. I wondered at this his collection, but it
seems Master Blake takes the term Jews not properly for people so called
because borns in Judes, or of Jewish descent, but allusively as Romans 2. 28. 29.
But Master Blaks does not observe that the term Jewe allusively taken is a
term common to all godly people, or believers, whereas here Jew is taken as
opposite to them that are of the Gentiles; and the denomination of a Jew
allusively taken is not from nature or birth, as here Master Blake rightly
expounds the word nature, but from faith, as the term seed of Abraham, and the
Israel of God, and the term circumcision Philip. 3. 3. so that Master Blakes
own exposition overthrowes his own inference. But then says Master Blake,
our children must be under [ sinners of the Gentiles] and so they are aliens
dogs without hope, etc. Ephesians. 2. 12. I answer, our children are of the
Gentiles, who were sinners, and as the Apostle spea^^s Ephesians. 2. 12. at that
time that went before their calling strangers from the Covenant of promise,
etc. But it does not follow that he that says our children are of the
Gentiles, who were once strangers from God, and so called sinners according to
their condition then, must hold that they (...) now. The most godly believer
now is under the second mother of the distinction, being born of Gentile
parents, and yet not as the Gentiles were then, stranger from Christ. Master
Blake is most vain in saying, that by my t^not there were ne more hope of the
salvation of a Christians Inf^^^ then of Numa, I acknowledge no such matter,
nor does any such thing follow from my words, which are plain and true; Master
Blake should, if he would have dealt fairly; have showed (...) of which words,
and how that follows which he obtand (...) me. When I said the Jews birth
privilege did not (...) them to the Covenant of grace, I meant the same with
the Apostle, (...) yet they had this benefit by their birth that they were
among the people of God, had the privilege of (...) according to the
Church State then, were to eat the (...); come into the court of the Temple,
had the law, Christ was to come of them, Romans 9. 4, 5. Romans 3. (...) and yet
many of them not children of the promise. The (...) of grace being made by God
does promise to all and every person to whom that Covenant is made, that he
shall be effectually wrought upon. I said, the common privilege of cir^^^sion
belonging to the Jews, did not arise from the Covenant of gr^^, recording to
the substance, of it; but according to the administration that then was. My
meaning was circumcision was common to them which had no part in the Covenant
made with Abraham, Genesis 17. neither an interest in the Evangelicall, nor
household promises made to Abraham, as for instance Ismael: and therefore I say
it did not arise from the Covenant of grace, or parents faith as the formal
reason why Infants were circumcised, but from Gods command according to that
Church State that then he thought good to appoint. This being clear from Gal. 3
and 4. Master Blake interprets it, as if I had said circumcision was not a
sign of the substance of the Covenant, and runs out in a large discourse to
prove the contrary; which touches not me who have expressly granted it
Exercit: page 3. Examen page 39, etc. And it is a mere calumny in Master Blake,
to to tell me that I close with the Jesuits, and with high disdain shake off
the doctrine of the Protestants. But says Master Blake, page 43. you say in
your exercitation, page 2. The Covenant made with Abraham is not a p^^e Gospel
Covenant, but mixed. In the same place I explain my meaning, and prove it so
fully, that I wonder that Master Marshall, Master Blake and others are not
ashamed to except against it. What the Jesuits say in this matter, or what the
Protestants say against them, I have not time to examine. The thing, as I
deliver it, is plain according to Scripture: that there were some peculiar
promises made to Abraham, Ge. 17. which are not made to every believer. To tell
us that godliness has the promise of the life that now is, 1 Timothy 4. 8. is
nothing to the present purpose, for it does not follow therefore that
godliness has the promise of the Land of Canaan or that Christ should be
every godly man's seed, etc. Mr Blake says, circumcision was a fruit of the
faith of the parents, but this is false; for then all, and none but children of
believers were to be circumcised, which is not true: whose children soever they
were, if in Abraham's house, if bought with money of any stranger, they were to
be circumcised, I had said, circumcision was a privilege in that time of the
Churches minority, and this the Apostle delivers, Gal. 3. and 4. Mr Blake takes
it as if I had said, the fruition of the promises in such a latitude, were
only a privilege during the time of the Churches minority, and would have me
give some Scripture or color of reason for it, which is to impose on me the
proving of that I affirm not. I said, he that will prove the birth privilege
of our children from the Jews, must make our case as theirs, and so bring us
under the ceremonial law. This Master Blake puts into a formal proposition of
his own, a man of straw and then denies it, the reason of my words is plain,
circumcision of Infants was from the paedagogy,, or peculiar Church State of
the Jews, as may be proved from Gal. 3. 25. Gal. 4. 1, 2, 3. and obliged to
the ceremonial law, Gal. 5. 3. therefore, they that from hence would draw the
birth privilege of our children, must make our case the same with the Jews,
and so bring us under the ceremonial law. The rest of that section is vain,
and not worth a line in answer. I said truly, that the interpetation of 1 Cor.
7, 14. of legitimation is no more to be called a singular opinion then Master
Blakes, and that I have proved by alleging eleven Authors for it, and can do
more.

To the 8th chapter, 8. That 1 P^ 2. 9. is meant of the Church invisible.
what he says of Doctor Wilmot I assent to: he was a precious man, and my dear
friend; when Master Blake shall demonstrate to me what passages in my book of
scandals are inexcusable, I shall endeavor some way or other to retract them.
Why I did not alter one or two passages, that Doctor Wilmot excepted against, I
shall be willing to give Master Blake the reason. Master Blake is mistaken in
that he says, that my friend of the Assembly that delivered my letter to
Master Marshal, was the man that told me of the Committee of the Assembly, and
advised me to present the reasons of my doubts to them; it was not he, but my
reverend and dear Father in law. And that friend of mine of the Assembly, that
delivered my letter to Mr Marshall, tells me that though he was desirous to have
Master Blakes book printed, that the point might be disputed; yet he did not
approve many of his proofs: but by his speech with me lately, I conceive he
did except at sundry of the same things which I did. But to the matter of that
chapter. Letting pass the conference, and the occurrence therein, which was
promised should not be divulged by any hearers, nor was there any exact record
kept of it; the dispute is now brought to writing, the question is whether I
Pet. 2. 9 prove a birth privilege of Christians, equal to the nation of the
fewes. I deny it, and say the words there are meant of the Church as it is
invisible. And to prove this.

1 I argue from the terms, chosen generatior, royal priesthood, holy nation,
peculiar people, or a purchased people, that is by Christ's death, Tit. 2. 14.
which cannot be affirmed of any other then elect and true believers, ergo.

2 From that which is said of them that were called by God, by his power or
virtue into his marvailous light, and v. 10. that now had obtained mercy which
they had not before, which cannot be affirmed of any but elect persons, and
true believers ergo.

3 It is said, v. 7. that these persons did believe, contradistinguished to
them that were disobedient and stumbled at the word, to which they were
appointed, but such are only the elect, ergo.

4 v. 5. They are said to be built as living stones on Christ, a spiritual
house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual Sacrifice acceptable to God by
Jesus Christ, which can agree to none but elect persons, and true believers,
ergo.

But the term nation comprehends Fathers and Children. Answ. The word nation,
taken in these passages must be understood restrainedly of a spiritual people,
as is plain by considering that the Apostle Gal. 3. 8 says this is the
Gospel, in thee shall all nations be blessed; that is, believers of all
nations: else the Apostles collection v. 9. were not right. And so the word
Kindred is used Acts 3. 25. compared with Ephesians. 3 15. the word household, Ephesians.
2. 19. But they may be said to believe with a dogmaticall faith. Answ. Those
that do so never come to Christ as living stones; nor are built a spiritual
house, which is proper to them that are made an habitation of God through the
spirit, Ephesians. 2. 22. But the calling of a people is spoken of the ten tribes
revolted Hos. 1. 10. Hos. 2. 23. Deuteronomy. 32. 21. Answ. However it be in the
places to which the allusion is, it is certain that here is meant such a
calling, as is from darkness to his marvailous light by his virtues or
powers; which therefore deserve to be showed forth, and which they do show forth
that are thus called. And this is confirmed from Romans 9. 24. 25. 26. which is
manifestly said of them who were called v. 23. vessels of mercy; nor is this a
denomination a part prast antigri, for it is expressly said (...) were the
same whom he called vessels of mercy. And I still say that I wonder Master
Blake would persist in maintaining so gross an abuse of this Scripture; in
which I hardly believe any approved writer joins with him.

Master Blake had said no particular president for women's receiving the Lords
Supper,. 11. Of precedents for women's receiving the Lords Supper.
more then for this of Infants. baptism. I alleged 1 Cor. 11. 28. where I
said (...) comprehends both sexes, To this Master Blake says chapter 9. if
arguments from the Grammar use be of force, then circumcision of femal^ may be
proved from John 7. 22. I reply, the subject matter of the command as well as
the Grammar use of the word prove femals to be included. Master Coleman an
Assembly man, and an able linguist in his male dicis, page 32. has these
words. But that I confess is something harsh, that he should ask me where
there is the institution for women to receive the Sacrament: when as 1 Cor. 11.
28. is as clear for women as men. Mr Martin Blake in his answer to Master
Benjamin Coxe chapter 7. sect. 4. page 82. produces many places where (...) is as
much quisque any one, Matthew. 16. 26. Joh. 3. 27. and 7. 46. Gal. 6. 1. etc. I
alleged for an express example of women receiving the Lords Supper, 1 Cor.
10. 17. and 1. Cor. 12. 13. and this I did in the Pulpit at Gabriel
Fench-Church, as Mr Blake tells me; and I had fit occasion since 1 Cor. 10. 17.
was my text then, and that text is express without consequence for women's
receiving the Lords Supper, if [ we] comprehend women as well as men, which
Master Blake will not deny. And yet Mr Marshals allegation to prove women
virtually to be circumcised in the males serves not for his purpose, I alleged
Acts 10. 7. Master Blake doubts whether it be meant of the Lords Supper, and if
it b meant so he knows not how to avoid the Pepish argument for Communion in
one kind; and that this yields a proof only by conseqvence. I answer, if
women be comprehended under the term Disciples, and breaking bread be meant of
the Lords Supper, as to me it seems certain; because it was the end of their
custo^^ meeting on the first day of the week, and therefore could not be any
other breaking bread; then the example is express without consequence, for
women's receiving the Lords Supper. It Mr Blake know not how to answer the
Papists, I wish him to read Chamier panstrat. Cathol. tom. 4. de Ench. lib. 9.
c. 2.. 34. etc. Master Blake would bring Acts 2. 47. for example far more
formal and express then mine of Infant Baptism, and he tells me of a
syllogism. The Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved, Infants
are saved, therefore are to he baptized. A strange syllogism, where in the
major permi^^ is not in the major proposition at all, consisting of four
terms; and so far as I can gather in secunda figura ex omnibus
affirmantibus: for the medium [saved] is the predicate in both premises, or
else the major is particular, and so it consists ex meris particularibus.

I go on to the 10th chapter. I said,. 12. To say that God has promised to be
the God of every believer and his uncurall seed is a new Gospel.
that it is a new Gospel to affirm that this is one of the promises of the
Covenant of grace, that God will be the God of believers and their seed. To
this Mr Blake says. A very high charge from that mouth which very lately,
preached it as a Gospel truth; and now being suddenly otherwise persuaded, can
bring no other arguments then those that are harrowed from Antichristian
^^^aries, who are confessed sub verters of the Gospel. I answer, Master Blake
cannot prove that I ever preached that Doctrine, I scarce think I did ever
preach it: Forasmuch as I conceived, that Doctrine directly contradictory to
the Apostle, Romans ^ 8. ever since in Oxford I examined Arminius his A^dysis of
Romans ^. Suddenly I was not persuaded as I show in my Apology before. I know
not what Antichristian sectaries he means who are confessed subverters of the
Gospel from whom I borro^ed my arguments; I neither had them from Anabaptists,
^o called, nor Papists: Master Blake gives way to his passion in this charge.
My arguments I have from Scripture, from the most learned Protestants, as he
may see part. 3. 54. And though it be an old Gospel, that God has promised to
be the God of Abraham and his seed, yet I still aver it to be a new Gospel,
to say that God has promised to be the God of believers and their seed. The
Cove^^^t with Abraham and his seed I find (...) 17. 7. and the urging of this
Covenant I deny not Exodus 32. 13. Deuteronomy. 9. 27. Levit, 26. 42. Exodus 3. 6. And
though I say not that it contained only the promise of (...), but grant it
contained the promise of (...) by Christ, (...) 1. 17. yet I like not Cha^iors
saying, to call the promise of Can^^ an app^^^^ to the Coven^^, since the Holy
Ghost me thinks speaks otherwise, Ps. 105. 8. 9. 10. 11. That (...) cap. 39.
speak not of (...) his faederall holiness has been showed before; and (...)
which Master Blake cites page 57. saying that (...) biunt and expectant
baptismum, do me thinks prove that Infants were not ordinarily baptized in his
time. Nor do I think Master Blake can prove the Doctrine of
Covenant-holinesse, out of Justin martyr, Epiphanius, Augustine, Isidor
Pelusiota.

I had said,. 13. Or Mr Ruthersurds and Mr Blakes opinion about holiness of a
chosen nation, and mediate An cestors profession intitling to Infant-baptisine,
and the Independents advantage in this point.
that I guess by some words of Master Marshall, Mr Blake and Master
Rutherfurd, that to maintain the baptizing of all sorts of persons in the
Kingdom, as foundlings Infants of Papists, whores excommunicat persons; which
is the ordinary practice; excepted against by Independents, that this assertion
was upon the anvil: that when a nation shall receive the faith, that is a great
or eminent part; the governors and chief cities and representative bodies
shall receive the faith, that nation shall in like manner have all their little
ones capable of baptism, and counted visible members of the Church, as the
posterity of the Jews were in the time of that Church administration. Mr Blake
asks me, in which of these words I pray you, can you find one word of that
business which you say is on the a^vill. I answer, to let Master Blakes words
alone for the present, me thinks Master Rutherfurds sound plainly as much; For
if notwithstanding the Father and Mother were as wicked as the Jews, who slew
the Lord of glory, who did obstinately deny Christ; the children were holy by
the holiness of the chosen nation, which I conceive when the Ancestors are not
included, must mean the body, or generality of the nation; then the assertion
I set down as theirs must follow: but this I did deliver but as my guess, yet
so as that I thought necessary to oppose it; and I say, it opposes their own
grounds, who derive the title to Infant Baptism from the Covenant, to a
believer and his seed; but these are not the seed of believers, but the seed of
them that deny and impugn the faith; and from 1 Cor. 7. 14. of which Master
Blake himself faith page 38. of his answer so my letter, The truth of the
Apostles sequel depends on this proposition, All the children of the unbeleever
are unclean, (that is out of the Covenant in his sense) unl^esse for
generation he or she be sanctified by a believer. Which speech of Master Blake
I conceive plainly overthrowes Master Blakes position in the birth privilege,
page 24. etc. and Master Rutherfurds in the words before named. For if all the
children of an unbeleever are unclean, unesse for generation he or she be
sanctified by a believer, it will not be enough to say the nation is holy, or
the mediate ancestors were holy, since the Apostles position is of the immediate
parents, about whose living together the question was, and therefore says,
else were your children unclean. Mr Blakes answer here is a mistake of the
force of my reason, which was not from the term [ beleever] in 1 Cor. 7. 14.
but from this that by their own expo^ition, they are unclean who are not borne
of a believer, therefore they cannot be holy either by holiness of remote
ancestors or the chosen nation, when the immediate parents are as wicked as
the Jews who crucified Christ. I said the Independents had the advantage in
this, and I am sure they have against Mr Blake and Mr Rutherfurd, and I guess
that the Assembly were sensible of it, when they appointed in the Directory the
child to be presented by the Father, though I conceive that remedy will little
or nothing rectify the abuse. Mr. Blake says it were worth enquiry whom I mean
by officiating Priests. I tell him, non-preaching Priests made by the Bishops.
Mr Blake says, your self were well aware, that every weapon that you left up
against this Protestant doctrine was forged on the Jesuitas a^vill, and that in
the whole conflict you were necessitated to borrow help from the Philisten
Artists, when you were put upon it to say page 13. This is no undeniable
Axiom, that, what all the Protestant Divines defend against the Papists, must
be truth undeniable. To this I say, I am well aware that this is a loud
calumny, the contrary whereof is manifest by the many and best Protestant
Divines I quote all along my Examen, and very seldom make use of a Jesuit
throughout my Treatise. Nor was I put upon that speech I used, because I
borrowed help from Papists; but because Mr Marshall spoke of his virtuall
consequence as undeniable, as if he had been Doctor irrefragabilis, and it is
necessary when men go about to bind men to the consent of Divines in some
Churches, that we freely claim our liberty, and not become the servants of
men. Mr Blake says I do not know one Protestant writer that has declared
himself in this thing, but has declared himself to be your adversary. I
answer, none of the Antipaedopaptists are my adversaries in this; yet some of
them are Protestant writers: in the point of expounding Genesis 17. 7. which is
the chief hold for Covenant holiness, Twisse, Bayne, Ames, Downame, and many
others are for me, in the point of expounding; 1 Cor. 7. 14. Camerarius,
Melanchthon, Musculus, O siander, are for me. Mr Blake says but a little
before, page 58. Zuinglius in this hand went right, in which Luther his
contemporary and opposite in this thing, is charged to be defective. But says
Mr Blake, I and you have entered into Covenant to the extirpation of Popery; and
I would learn of you by what character or mark it may be now discerned. I
answer, not by this, that that is to be accounted Popery which all Protestant
Divines oppose the Papists in; for then many things would not be counted Popery
which are, nor any thing to be counted Popery till we knew all Protestant
Divines oppose it an endless, impossible business. But there is a shorter way
then that, and it is that is to be counted Popery which is commonly known by
that name, as the doctrine of the Popes supremacy infallibility, the doctrine
of the Mass, Transubstantiation, Bread-worship, Crosse-worship, Invocation of
Saints, etc. Or if you will have a more fixed way, you may take that to be
Popery which either the 39 Articles of the Church of England condemn in
opposition to Papists, or is renounced in the Scottish negative Covenant, or
Confession in the year 1581 as I remember, or what the present Parliament of
England in their late Propositions to the King, Propos. 7. would have Papists
abjure. Mr Blake says, may we not require one other instance of a Popish truth
standing up against an Orthodox error, besides this incontroversie? That from
Genesis 17. 7. 1 Cor. 7. 14. or any other Scripture Covenant-holines of believers
infants cannot be proved is as well a Protestant truth, as a Popish; An
Orthodox error is, opposition in ^ppos^^^ Be it that we cannot assign any one
thing for truth in which Pretestants generally oppose Papists; yet my speech is
good, that that is no undeniable axiom, that what all the Protestant Divines
defend against the Papists, must be truth undeniable. He that will not
subscribe to this, must make the Protestant Divines doctrines against Papists,
equal to the holy Scripture.

In the 11th chapter Sect.. 14. Of the word [ nations] Mat. 28. 19. how to be
taken.
1. Mr. Blake subscribes to my interpretation, and conclusion, but doubts the
premises on which I build it to be scarce sound, the reason he gives is,
because I thus expound make Disciples out of all nations, whereas the verb is
transitive, and the noune in the accusative; and therefore it is boldness in
me to change it, that in stood of nations I may understand as many or as few as
I l^st of nations, whereas Mr Blake conceivet agreeable to prophecies, Psalm. 2.
8. etc. that the whole of the nation is appointed to be discipled, and to be
baptized, and so infants to be comprehended. I answer, my boldness was no
other then Beza's, annot. on Mat. 28. 19. (...), idest discipulos mihi facite
ex omnibus gentibus. The new (...) on the Bible annot. on Matthew. 28. 19. ^each]
Gr. make Disciples of as John 4. 1. all nations] not Jews alone, but Gentiles
also; Acts 10. 34. 35. 47. nor do I any thing contrary to Grammar, as the (...)
in transitive, so it is used transitively by me, and it has an accusative case
after it, to wit the noune confessedly included in the verb that is made from
it, and which I think none will deny to be the same with (...) used John 4. 1.
and then all nations must either be put by apposition (...), or with the
Praeposition (...), I stand not upon it whether be taken but I conceive it more
agreeable to the sense, and to the language to express it in the latter way,
Be then the whole of the nation, and so infants will not be included. I
answer, it is true, nor can they be included. For the making Disciples all
nations is by teaching them, or by preaching the Gospel to them; as the word
(...), is expressed, Marks 6. ^^. (which no man I think will have the face to
deny to be the same with this) not only Master Marshall himself that
expresses it in his Sermon page 35. that they should teach the heathen and the
Jews and make them Discicles, and then baptize them; but Mr Blake subscribes
to this my intrepretation, by preaching the Gospel to all nations, make them
Disciples. page 65. So that Mr Blake must needs exclude infants, except he can
make them Disciples by teaching or preaching the Gospel to them. And for the
prophecies he brings, I marvel he is not ashamed to produce, Psalm. 72. 11.
Psalm. 86. 9. to prove that that the whole of the nation even infants must be
included,. 15. Of M. Rutherfurds and Mr Blakes and mine opinion concerning the
rule to know who are baptizable.
Mat. 28. 19. as if it were foretold that the whole of the nations even infants
should come and worship before God. Pareus in his Commentary on Matthew. 28. 19.
says truly, tertium mandatum est de baptizandis omnibus gentibus, hoc est
sacramento baptismi initi^^dis and consecrandis omnibus is qui Christo nomen
darent.

In the second fiction of chapter 11. Master Blake says, I had thought no man
had equal ^ Bellarmin in taking pains to find a knot in a Bull-rush. But I
have showed above that Mr Rutherfurd has made a knot, needful to be untyed. I
say, there can no rule be assigned whereby to know when a nation is a
believing, chosen, or discipled nation, giving right to baptize infants of that
nation when not. Mr Blake asks, do you mean rules so clear and plain that
(...) difficulty or case of conscience can occur; that needs enquiry in
observation of it. I answer no, but such rules as are so clear that a case of
conscience may be resolved by them. M. Blake acouseth me as not rightly setting
down his arg^^ent, because I set not down the conclusion right: I put the
conclusion thus; and therefore the infants to be baptized, whereas I should
have added: and the nations being discipled, then infants as part of the nation
are to be baptized: To show the causlesnesse of this exception, Mr Blake page
20 of his birth-priviledge had said thus, The infants of any nation make up a
part of the nation, and the nation, where they came was to be discipled; but
set not down his conclusion, and therefore I conceiving he meant to infer
thence that infants were comprised in those words, baptizing them, Matthew. 28.
19. put down his conclusion thus, and therefore the infants: to be baptized. Mr
Blake would have discipled put into the conclusion. But I conceive still
discipled should not be put in the conclusion, and the premises were set down
by himself, and therefore I did him no wrong. For his argument in form must be
thus. They who are part of a discipled nation are to be baptized, infants are
part of a discipled nation, therefore infants are to be baptized; any man may
see that discipled should not be put in the conclusion, since it is in the
medium, quod non ingreditur conclusionem. Now let his major Proposition stand,
and I will subsume upon Mr Blakes ground; Infidels of grown years are part of
a discipled nation, for they are part of the nation; and if the nation be
discipled, they are part of the discipled nation: therefore by Mr Blakes
reason, Infidels of grown years are to be baptized. Mr Blake at last page 67.
sets down his rule, in these words they are baptized by virtue of a privilege
from their parent, not from the nation: which is plainly to renounce Mr
Rutherfurds assertion. I confess if my first argument against the assertion I
conceive Mr Rutherfurds may be answered, then the 2d. will be easily answered
as M. Blake truly observes, p. 68. In answering my 3d. Mr Blake asks, How is
it that wicked parents are now brought in this dispute? I answer because it was
the term Mr Rutherfurd used in his assertion: not to show my allowance of the
baptism of infants of parents not wicked, nor out of agreement with Mr Thomas
Goodwin in this. Mr Blake page 69. endeavors to prove by my tenet there can be
no rule set down to know that any man is baptizable, because he conceives I
hold only true believers before God, members of the invisible Church, vessels
of mercy, redeemed ones are the men discipled to be baptized; but who are such,
cannot be known. Ergo, by my opinion none are to be baptized. M. Blake
endeavors to gather that to be my opinion out of my words, which are brought
in obtorto cello, against their intent, nothing to his purpose. I say that Mr
Marshals words in this sense are good, believers of every nation are the
peculiar people meant; 1 Pet. 2. 9. and this is meant of the invisible Church;
and that God has not chosen simply the nation of the Gentiles, but a people
out of them: Revel. 5. 7. but do I thereby expound Matthew. 28. 19. as if
[nations] there comprehended only such elect persons and true believers? or do
I any where say, that such only are Disciples and to be baptized? Why then does
Mr Blake not only here, but after in another chapter to wit the 14 of his book
page 95, 96. endeavor to fasten so absurdly that upon me, when he himself
twice in this very book p. 24. 50. acknowledges, that he has heard it from my
own mouth, that baptism is rightly administr^^^^ every professor of Christ. I
say page 158 of my Examen, th^^ ^^nfants being sanctified are believers, and
discipled of Christ; but I no where say, a sanctified person a believer, and a
Disciple to be the same, as Mr Blake untruly charge me, page 96. for I do
not make the terms reciprocal. Nor is that the advantage which I say the
Independents have in this point, that the holiness that is the ground for the
administratour to baptize, must be real either indeed or charitably believed;
but this is the advantage I conceive the Independents have, that whereas some
will have children baptized though the parents be never so wicked: if they be a
part of a believing nation, or their mediate Ancestors professed the faith,
the Independents have advantage against them by their own plea; from Genesis 17.
7. 1 Cor. 7. 14. as I showed above. In like manner Master Blake chapter 14.
page 93. because I said that Infants may by extraordinary power be made
Disciples, as God made John Baptist leap in his mothers womb, and Balaame ass
speak, inferres against all reason and candor, thus. You hold this is done by
the omnipotent power of God, as usually as actual faith and profession of it
is wrought in them; as asses are made to speak with man's voice, and children
in the womb leap for joy at the sensible prefence of one that speaks to their
mother. These you join together, so that this is the comfort that you leave to
parents when infants believe, make profession of their faith, asses speak, and
infants in the womb know a voice and rejoice upon hearing it, then their
children may be sanctified and dying in infancy saved. But what spirit is Mr
Blake possessed with that he so unbrotherlike perverts my words to make me
odious? I say that infants are sanctified by extraordinary power, not by
ordinary means as hearing the word, do I therefore make this unusual? It may
be done in every infant of a believer for ought I say to the contrary. But you
make it an extraordinary accident when you use this passage, both p. 134, and
158. extraordinary accidents make not an ordinary rule. It Is true I use the
passage in both places, but do not in either make the extraordinary accident to
be an infants sanctification, but in the one an infants profession of faith, as
the very words show, page 134. and in the other the extraordinary revelation,
as is easy to be perceived by him that reads, page 158. of my examen. And thus
have I answered with sect. 2. chapter 11. the fourteenth chapter ^^so of Mr Blakes
book.

Sect.. 16. About two suppositions ascribed by m^ to Mr Marshal and Mr Blake in
my Examen page 130.
3. chap. 11. Mr. Blake ^hargeth me of imposing this supposition on him, that
he should strongly conceit this, that Christ bid the Apostles baptize all
nations after the manner that the Jews did circumcise one nation, my meaning
was that he conceived that as God appointed the Jews to circumcise parents
professing faith and their infants; so he bid the Apostles baptize believing
parents, and their infants: I did not intend to charge him with this conceit,
as if he conceived that Christ bid the Apostles set up circumcision, as he
seems page 73. to imagine, but that he conceived they were to baptize all
nations. Fathers and Infants in like manner as the Jews circumcised Fathers
and their Infants. And this I conceive still must be his meaning, not knowing
what other Covenant, and Covenant-initiating Sacrament he could mean
restrained to one nation, besides the Covenant, Genesis 17. and circumcision
appointed to the Jews. But Mr. Blake tells me this was my calumny to say he
would have the commission, Mat. 28. 19. to be expounded by the precept of
circumcision, Genesis 17. he mea^t the precept or commission; Matthew. 10. 6. I
answer, Mr Blake would have the word nations Matthew. 28. 19. to comprehend
infants, and his reason is, because the word nation was so taken, when the
Covenant, and Covenant-initiating Sacrament was restrained to that our nation.
Now I appeal to any one whether in the commission. Matthew. 10. 6. yea or in the
whole (...) word nation be taken as restrained to that one natio^^ (...)
commission was first limited, nor is there any menti^^ (...) of Covenant or
Covenant-initiating Sacrament in (...) whole chapter, nor a word that shows
that the word nation in the Apostles commission comprehended infants. And
therefore I could not divine more fairly then I did what Mr Blakes meaning
should be in that obscure expression. But says Mr Blake you are not at the
pains to make it appea^^ how the words of Christ were to the Apostles in
elligible, if the word nation in this enlarged Commission, must be taken in my
other sense, and latitude then it was in their former limited commission when
the Covenant and Covenant-initiating Sacrament was restrained to one nation. To
this I answer, I took pains I think sufficient to show how it must be
understood in my Examen,. 13. and therefore I show how it was intelligible to
the Apostles. Many interpreters have expounded the word, (...) that I know of
expounded it by Mat. 10. 6. The commission Mar. 16. 15. is the same with Mat.
28. 19. and so expo^^^^ without running to Mat. 10. 6. The other supposition
(...) ^^ceived Mr Marshals argument relied on is, that the nation (...) Jews
were discipled when circumcised. This Mr Blake says, I put on him, but he
disclaimes it. The truth is, I did not put it on Mr Blake, but Mr Marshall;
though the next words speak of Mr Blake: but not imputing to him the second,
but the first supposition. As for Mr Mar. I do not find him disclaiming it. And
for that inference that M. Blake makes from my words, as if I conceived low
thoughts of Mr Blake and Mr Marshall, because I say the conceit that making
Disciples, Mat. 28. 19. is to be done by baptizing them, is so absurd that I
presume none that has any wit will entertain it, now it is as absurd to say,
that the Jews were discipled when they were circumcised, and therefore I
conceive Mr Blake and Mr Marshall have not any wit. But for this inference it
is a far fetched thing: I did not conceive the one so absurd as the other,
nor do yet, and therefore I might impute defect of wit to the entertainer of
the one conceit, and yet not impute it to Mr Marshal and Mr Blake, for
entertaining another conceit like it. Mr Blake excepts against me for saying
these points had strong hold in his mind, that baptism succeeds into the room,
place, and use of circumcision; and that the Covenant of the Gospel is all one
with the Covenant made with Abraham: (...) used those words, that Baptism so
succeeds circum^^ (...) therefore how could I know it to be in his mind I
answ^^ (...) it by words equipollent which he uses as Birth-priviledge, page
14. what is objected against one, concludes against both: circumcision and
baptism are therefore by the Apostle promiscuously taken; there being the same
principal and maine end of both. And this is evidence enough for what I said.
The other Proposition he denies not to be in his mind.

Sect.. 17. About arguments drawn from Analogy in positive rites and their
invalidity: and the insufficiency of M. Blakes rules.
4. chapter 11. Mr Blake makes a digression concerning arguments drawn from
Analogy. And first whereas I had allowed for that which is natural or moral
in worship, an institution or command in the old Testament as obligatory to
christians: upon this Mr Blake tells me, there is the same reason and like
liberty in arguing by analogy in positive as in moral precepts. To this I
reply, if the meaning be that there is like reason of proving moral precepts
from the old Testament as positive rites, it is most false and contrary to the
7th article of the Church of England, but if it be (...) ^^tood of the manner
of proof by analogy or resembla^^ then I deny that we have any liberty at all
to argue from analogy or resemblance, to prove or make a duty or command in
morals or ceremonials, though I grant we may use analogy to enforce a duty
before proved. For an argument to prove a thing to be a moral duty from the
old Testament, must be by proving the same thing, then to have been moral as
Master Cawdray and Master Palmer endeavor to prove one day in seven for a
Sabbath to be moral and perpetual, but an argument from analogy is from one
thing to another, as like, for analogy or proportion is between, not the same
but more things as like. As for the Apostles arguing, 1 Cor. 9. 9. 1 Timothy 5.
18. the Apostle does not by ^are analogy conclude ministers maintenance, but
from the Lords ordinance, 1 Cor. 9. v. 14. which ordinance I take to be that
Matthew. 10. 10. which ordinanc the Apostle confirms from common equity, which
he proves b^ diverse instances, from v. 7. to v. 14. so that the Apostle does
no prove a moral duty by analogy between two different things, bu^ from a
general maxim that the labourer is worthy of his reward proved by sundy
instances, inferres a particular truth concerning ministers. The argument 1
Cor. 10. 16. 17. is to prove. that they which profess C^^t, may not partake of
the things of Idols, from this general truth that they which join in the
service of any God they hold communion with that God, and are one with those
that worship that God this the Apostle proves by instances in the Christian,
and Jewish services. So that this argument is from a general truth proved by
an induction of instances. That Matthew. 12. 3. 4. is only an instance to prove
that sacrifice must give place to mercy: a ceremonial to a moralll duty; not
an argument from mere analogy or resemblance of things different. But what ever
arguing there be in morals, certain it is that no argument is good from bare
analogy in ceremonials, or mere positives of the Jews; to prove, thus it was
in such a rite of the Jews, therefore it must be so in such a rite of the
Christians, there is no example of such arguing in the Scriptures, and therefore
I said rightly Examen page 29. To me it is a dangerous principle upon which
they go that so argue, to wit, that in mere positive things (such as
circumcision and baptism are) we may frame an addition to Gods worship, from
analogy, or resemblance conceived by us between two ordinances; whereof one is
quite taken away without any institution gathered by precept or Apostolical
example. Master Blake would know who they be that do so, I answer, Mr Marshall
in his first argument, and five first conclusions, and virtuall command from
circumcision; Master Blake birth-priviledge page 15. and generally all that
prove Infant Baptism, by Infant-circumcision. For circumcision and baptism,
are mere positive things; baptizing of Infants is confessed not to have
express institution gathered by express precept, or example in the new Test:
and that which is alleged, is either express, or no precept, or example at
all: and if it were to be gathered by consequence from institution, or example
Apostolical in the new Testament, without the help of the precept of
circumcision there would be, for as much as it concerns my part, an end of the
controversy: therefore it is clear, they that argue from circumcision to
baptism, do frame an addition to Gods worship, from analogy or resemblance
conceived by them, between two ordinances: whereof one is quite taken away,
without any institution gathered by precept, or Apostolical example. But says
Master Blake. It is not barely the analogy between circumcision and baptism,
by which we enforce the baptism of Infants, but the grounds of both
circumcision and baptism. This is said, but when the grounds are required, what
are they but the analogy between baptism and circumcision, that they are like;
what is the reason of the one, is the reason of the other: and therefore what is
done in the one, is to be done in the other? Now whence is this arguing but
barely from the likeness, which makes an argument merely from analogy. If the
argument were drawn from some thing proper to baptism it were another case,
but being drawn from circumcision to baptism, it is an argument merely from
analogy. If they rest not on this, let them lay aside this argument, and stick
to precept or Apostolical example in the new Testament. To show the danger of
this way of arguing, I thus reasoned Examen page, 29. For if we may do it in one
thing, why not in another? where shall we stay? They that read the Popish
expositors of their rituals do know, that this principle has brought in
surplice, purification of women, etc. that I mention not greater matters. I
desire any Learned man to set me down a rule from Gods word, how far I may
go in my conceived parity of reason, equity or analogy, where I must stay; when
it will be superstition and will worship when not; when my conscience may be
satisfied, when not. Master Blake in answer hereto, lays down three rules. 1.
When parity of reason or analogy, does not institute any piece of worship, or
the least part of the service of God but only helps to a right understanding
of the nature, use, end, extent of that which is instituted. 2. When in our
reasoning from analogy, from the right understanding of any inctitution, or
ordinance, (...) do not rest soly on the analogy that we find with other
commands, but have our further reason for confirmation. 3. When the analogy
holds full proportion in that for which it is brought, so that nothing can
fairly be brought against the one, but may be also concluded against the
other. To this I answer. 1 That never a one of these rules is brought out of
Gods word. Not the first, for there is neither declaration of such a rule, nor
example to prove that rule. The proving of excommunicating of women from
Miriams shutting out of the camp, Numb. 12. 14. is not a Scripture collection,
but a mere devise of men; the argument against nonresidence from Ezekiel. 44. 8.
is good after other arguments, but without other proof is not convincing: and
it is not in mere positive things but moral. The argument of the Apostle, 1
Cor. 9. 13. 14. is not from one positive rite to another, but from an ordinance
of God agreeable to common equity in the old Testament, to illustrate an
ordinance in the new Testament, about a moral duty of righteousness. The
second and third rules are not set down from any declaration or example in the
Scripture. 2 I say these rules are very uncertain, For no reason is given why
they may not make a new worship, who may by their analogy extend it beyond the
institution in the new Testament yea, it will be alleged by Papists, and
others, that when they appoint Surplice, Purification, Organs, etc. they do not
make a new worship, but add circumstances to the ordinances of Christ. Yea,
The second rule overthrowes all, For if we may not soly rest on the analogy;
why at all? This is enough to show that analogy has no strength, that indeed
it does only illustrate cannot prove; what is an argument by analogy, but an
argument a similt? If analogy could prove, we might rest soly on it, without
any other confirmation. It is true, many desire more arguments, but in truth if
it be an argument that proves, we may rely on it soly though there be no other.
The third rule likewise is uncertain and vain. For how shall we know when
the analogy holds full propo^tion? when nothing can be fairly brought against
the one, but may be also concluded on the other? when is the proportion full,
if only when omnia sunt paria; this can never happen in analogies between the
rites of Moses and rites of Christ? If when there is a parity in many things,
it will be uncertain how many parityes will serve turn to make the proportion
full; what force there is in an analogy when there are more disparities: And so
for a rule to know when a thing is fairly brought, whether the rule be to be
taken from Logic, or the judgment of the Learned. So that these rules are
very uncertain. 3 It is also uncertain whether these rules be sufficient,
whether there be no need of any more. For these rules will not exclude proof
of imparity of ministers, Infant commuuion, etc by analogy. Or if they do the
same aberration from these rules that disproves the analogy for these; will be
incident to the analogy for Infant Baptism. We may say Infant-communion, or
imparity in the ministry is no more a new instituted worship, then Infant
baptism; they that allege analogy for imparity of the Clergy, and
Infant-communion rest not soly on it: it seems to be brought as fairly with as
full proportion in the one as the other. So that I conclude, not only with
Master Rutherfurd proportions are weak proportions, but also that in these
positive rites, and institutions they are no probations at all, but mere
illustrations, and consequently the argument for Infant Baptism from the
analogy of Infant-circumcision is a mere nullity.

The rest of the section contains nothing but wrong inferences from my words;
I distinguish between Evangelicall promises and promises domestical specially
respecting Abraham's family, If this distinction may pass then Abraham's family
had no Evangelicall promises says Master Blake, you make says he, an
opposition between them. But what ridiculous arguing is this? It Is all one as
to say, If gifts of grace and nature are distinguished, then they that have
gifts of grace, can have no gifts of nature. Those things that are not idem
formaliter, or realiter, may be in eodem subjecto. I oppose them, he says, but
how? not as contraries, but as disparata, which is rather a distinction then an
opposition. Because I say, circumcision signified that Moses Law was to be
observed, Gal. 5. 3. Master Blake excepts. You are (it seems) of Mr Blackwoods
opinion, that says, circumcision did not bring any grace to the Jews, but was
rather a yoke or a curse. Master Blackwood has or may answer for himself. Mr.
Blakes inference from my words is a mere cavil. And that which he adds, that I
make frequent use of Bellarmines sophistry is a mere slander. That
circumcision signified the promise of the Land of Canaan, I had it not from
Bellarmine, but if from any, rather from Cameron cited by me exercit: page 4.
or rather from Genesis 17. 8. Psalm. 105. 11. This is enough in answer to that
section.

Sect.. 16. That Mr Blake has not proved that Infants are disciples from Mat.
18. 5. nor pertinently alleged. Isai. 49 22.
5. chapter 11. Master Blake accuses me as not setting down his argument rightly,
but the truth is, I set not down the argument as it is in Master Blake, but as
it was in Master Marshall, whose very words I allege, and that rightly. But
Master Blake thinks he formed it to better advantage; From Matthew. 10. 42. Mar.
9. 41. compared, I only gather to that belong to Christ, and to bear the name
of Christ, and to be a Disciple of Christ is one and the same thing. But by his
leave, if he should meet with a punctual respondent, he would and might deny
his proof. For all that he can prove from thence is, that the same persons
that belong to Christ, are disciples of Christ; but it is not true always,
quae eidem subjecto convenient sunt eadem formaliter. He that should say, he
that receives my servant receives me; he that receives one that belongs to me
receives me; though he speak both these of the same person, yet a servant, and
one that belongs to him are not all one and the same thing: For there are other
that belong to him, as wife, children, friends, besides servants. And indeed to
belong to Christ, and to be a Disciple of Christ, are not one and the same
thing. To be a Disciple of Christ in all the places in the four Evangelists and
Acts of the Apostles, signifyes no other then one that professed Christ to be
his master, and followed his Doctrine, as the Disciples of John, the Pharisees,
and others did follow their Doctrine; but many belong to Christ, yet uncalled,
all that his Father has given unto him, the Angels that are his Ministers
belong to him, and yet cannot in the Scripture acception be termed Christ's
Disciples. But I assume says Master Blake, that Infants are of the number of
those who as Disciples in Christ's account do belong to him. Matthew. ^^. 5. I
said the word (...) notes not always an Infant, for I^^rus daughter, though
twelve year old is called (...) Mark 5. 41. 42. and yet that age might be a
pattern of humility* seldom are children of that age ambitious as the
Disciples, though they be often impatient. I said further that Matthew. 18. 5. is
not meant of a little child in age, and that (...) proved from v. 3. ^. 6. But
says Master Blake, he is indeed a child in understanding that does not see
that your ^^^ference to v. 3. 4. is wholly against you for little child v. 3.
4. is taken for such a one as in age is a little child, else the speech would
be ^^ept. But Mr Blake should have ^^^^ded my words better, I did not parallel
the word [ little child] v. 5. with [ little child] v. 3 4 but the phrase [ one
such little child] with the phrases, v. 3. one that is converted, and made as a
little child. v. 4. one that humbles himself as a little child v. 6. one of
those little ones that believe in him. But says Master Blake, Luke 9. 48. it
is (...) It is true, it is so. Nevertheless Beza notes thus, sed and pro (...)
hunc puerulum, fortassis legendum (...) hujusmodi puerulum: and Grotius (...)
id est: (...) ut apud Matthaeum, quomodo and hic Syrus interpretatur. Tale est:
amor omnibus idem. That in Matthew. 18. 5. a little child must be meant of a
little child in affection, seems plain to me by the term (...) such a one,
that it is not limited to that little child, the term 1. shows which is as much
as quempiam any one. And me thinks the meaning of the words should be thus,
whosoever should receive such a one as is as mean and low as a little child
receives me, as that which follows makes me conceive. For he that is less
among you, that is, though he were as mean as a little child, shall be great.
But were it granted that it were meant of a little child in age, how does it
follow that such a one is there a Disciple? This, if any must be the proof: He
that is received in christ's name, is a Disciple. A little child may be received
in Christ's name ergo a little child is a disciple* But of this argument, I deny
the major; a person might be received in Christ's name, who was not a Disciple,
as those that did miracles in Christ's name* and yet followed not Christ, Luke
9. 49. But if it were so that it could be proved, that the term Disciple is
any where given to an Infant, (which neither Master Blake from Matthew. 18. 5.
nor Master Marshall from Acts 15. 10. can ever do) yet it is certain that a
Disciple Matthew. 28. 19. is such a one as is made by preaching the Gospel, as
is manifest from Mar. 16. 15. John 4. ^. And I wonder that those very men that
do in effect sometime confess this is not meant of Infants, when they answer
the Antipaedobaptists objection from Matthew. 28. 19. as Mr Marshall page 44 of
his Sermon, It is said indeed, that they taught and baptized, and no express
^^ntion of any other, that yet they should by such strained and forced
inferences go about to draw a command from Matthew. 28. 19. for baptizing
Infants, as if they might be called there Disciples, contrary to the constant
use of the word throughout the new Testament, and their own confessionels
where. Sect. 6 chapter 11. Master Blake blames me for putting his reason from Isai
49. 22 as an argument by it self in my exercitation. But he might know my
exercitation set down most of the arguments as they were urged in the
conference with me, And so was the reason from Isai 49. 22. urged in that
conference as an argument by it self, to my best remembrance, however it were
after disposed in the birth-priviledge. But says Master Blake, the question
here is not (as after your manner you mistake it) whether this text proves
Infant Baptism, but whether it gives any intimation, that Infants in the days
of the Gospel be any members of the Church-visible, or entitled to any
privileges of the Covenant, as Christ's Disciples. I reply, The proving of that
intimation tended to prove Infant Baptism, and therefore those words were
alleged for Infant Baptism; which was that I said, not a whit mistaking the
question. Now since Master Blake confesses that the words must needs be
allegorical, why does he expound the term sons and daughters of infants, and
tell us that their carriage of their little ones must be understood no
otherwise then of the access of the Gentiles with their Infants to the Church
of Christ. For if the Carriage, and noursing v. 23. be allegorical meant of
persuasions, exhortations, and such like acts, Infants could not be thus
carried And so Mr Blakes allegationis but an empty sound.

Chapter 12.. 19. of baptizing households and my censure of Mr Blakes speech
concerning it.
Master Blake goes about to justify his speech that he used in his
birth-priviledge, page 22. that the precedant is an household. He that
follows the precedent, must baptize households. This speech I said, I marvel
much at it, and that it is very absurd, that I say no worse of it. Master Blake
tells me. I express not the reason of so much marvel. I answer the term
wherefore, with the words following express this reason plainly, since as I
said before in households were Infidels, if an household be the precedent to be
followed; and he that follows the precedent must baptize households without
any other qualification; then when he baptizeth the believing master, he must
baptize the unbeleeving servant, wife, etc. for they are of the household.
Master Blake. If you had any worse to say, I wonder that you had not spoke it,
your best friends I believe will say that you have sufficiently showed your
self absurd in language. Sure Master Blake knows that a speech may be worse
censured then by terming it very absurd, I might have called it sophistical,
deceitful, and that had been worse. My best friends can find no abusive
language of any man's person, their speeches or arguments I censure in no more
absurd language then usually scholars do, and particularly Master Gataker does
Doctor Ames, and Voetius as I have showed in this Apology above. 5. Master
Blake adds, I only say some more learned then I, as learned as you have
denied my words to be either absurd or heterodox. Be it so; yet affection may
blind their eyes. But let us examine the speech. I reasoned thus, if the
precedent to be followed be a household, then those of the household are to be
baptized either because of the household; if this be said, then the Infidel
wife is to be baptized because of the household, or because they profess the
faith; and then the precedent is not a household, but a professor of faith. To
this Master Blake, For full answer I say, that wife and servant, as wife and
servant, are in a capacity for baptism: if any wife and servant were in those
households they were baptized; else the Scripture would not have said the whole
family was baptized. It is sufficient that Scripture mentioning baptism of
whole households, excepts none from a capacity of baptism. I reply, in that
which he calls a full answer, there is no answer at all to my reason; for he
neither denies my distinction to be sufficient, nor does he tell us which
member he will choose in the Dilemma, nor how he will avoid the consequent upon
his choice. And therefore his learned friends, though they were ten times
learneder then my self, yet in this are mistaken in acquitting either the
former speech, of this answer, from absurdity. But let us consider what he
says. It is sufficient, that Scripture mentioning baptism of whole households,
excepts none from a capacity of baptism. I reply: Is this sufficient to make
the baptizing of households the precedent, that is the pattern by which we may
now baptize Infants, because Infants are not excepted? Then neither are
Infidels excepted there; nor natural fools or idiots of ripe years, and so
are to be the precedent of baptizing. But wife and servant as wife and servant,
are in a capacity for baptism. Answer. It is not true, that wife and servant
as wife and servant are in a capacity for baptism, if [^s] betaken with
reduplication, and [capacity] of actual right, but as they are professors of
faith. But if it be understood that, (...) wife, that is though wife, and
capacity in respect of future possibility, then it is true of an Infidel, of
any man shall we therefore make an Infidel, or a man simply the precedent of
baptizing? I said there is no reason why it should not be laid as well, that
baptizing Samaria, Acts 8. 12. the 3000. Acts 2. 42. all Judea Matthew. 3. 5;
should be the precedent as baptizing of households, Acts 16. True says Master
Blake, if Semaria be converted, all Judaea is taken for some considerable
numbers out of every part of Judaea. So say I, the term household is taken Acts
16. for those of the house that being of grown years professed the faith. And
so there is no precedent there for baptizing an Infant.

Chapt. 13.. 20. About Mat. 19 14. that by the Kingdom of heaven is meant the
Kingdom of glory.
Mr Blake passing over all that I say to Mr Marshals second argument, till page
145. concerning it tells me, that I might have given Mr Marshal leave to explain
his own argument. And And I tell Mr Blake that so I did, and then did my part
to show what was faulty in it, so effectually that I conceive in his Defense he
has quitted it, and put another in its room, as weak as it; as I showed above.
But Mr Blake thinks it is sufficient to make the argument good, that infants
of believers have an access in Gods ordinary way of dispensation, whilst
infants: Here is a new phraseology, which serves for nothing but to puzzle;
there is no face of an argument in it, and therefore I let it pass. To show,
how uncertain the argument is from from Matthew. 19. 14. for infant baptism I
produced Pis^a^ors reasons to prove that it is not clear they were infants
that were brought to Christ. These reasons I did not stick to, and so need not
own what is contradictory to my exposition of Matthew. 18. 5. before. The second
exception I took to the argument from Matthew. 19. 14. I delivered only
doubtfully, and yet I conceived Mr Marshals reason not cogent, for somewhat
that Christ meant to reach by that Emblem of a little child could not be well
resembled by a sheep, for though meekness might, yet not d^ciblenesse: I might
have added that the similitude or Emblem of a sheep, had not so much decorum
in it. But I stick not to that exposition of not including those infants, as
conceiving not from Mr Marshals or Mr Blakes reason, but from the circumstances
of the thing, that Christ intended some extraordinary blessing to them, and
declaration concerning them. As for Mr Blakes gloss he puts upon me, I
disclaimed it; It is his own mistake, not my conceit: that those infants, or
infants of believers in infancy have no interest in Christ, but are without
Covenant of promise, without God, without hope. But for that I said; thirdly,
that there is no certainty, only conjecture that they were infants of
believers, I avow it. Mr Blake averres a certainty beyond conjecture, because
Christ was minister of the circumcision, Romans 15. 8. sent to the lost sheep of
the house of Israel, Mat. 15. 24. carried himself otherwise to the Canaanitish
woman in behalf of her daughter, verse 22. 23. If these had had no other
interest, Christ would have been as facile to others as to them. I reply,
Christ was minister of the ci^^^mcision, was sent to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel, yet cured the servant of the Centurion, the Samaritan leper,
the daughter of the Syrophenician. He carried himself strangely at first to
that woman, to provoke her faith, and he pleaded against her not that she was
not a believer, but that she was a Canaanite; if this reason prove any thing
it is, that the childrens parents were Jews, but that proves not they were
believers; few of them believing on Christ, John 1. 11. Against the fourth
thing I say of those children that were brought to Christ, that the speech [ of
such is the kingdom of heaven] is meant of the kingdom of glory, and that
this is not common to all infants of believers; Mr Blake excepts that it is
meant of the visible Church, and and of all infants of believers as such: now
on this hinge turns the fifth exception also, and so the answer to the whole
argument I determine the Kingdom of heaven to be meant of the Kingdom of
glory, and I thus prove it.

1 The Kingdom of God must be understood Mark 10. 14, as it is verse 15. and
Lu. 18. 16. as verse 17 and Matthew. 19. 14. as it is in both those, this I
prove, because our Savior from their estate inferres a likeness to them in
others for the same estate; but Mark 10. 15, Luke 18. 17. can be understood of
no other then the Kingdom of glory, the proposition being false, being
understood of the visible Church; many proud men entering therein* as Simon
Magus, Diotrephes, etc. ergo it must be understood of the Kingdom of glory.

2 From this that our Savior directs the speech Mark 10. 15. Luke 18. 17. to
his Disciples who were already in the visible Church, therefore the requiring a
further condition to the Kingdom of God shows he meant it of the Kingdom of
glory.

3 The speech Mark 10. 15. Luke 18. 17. is like Mat. 18. 3, 4. but there it is
meant of the Kingdom of glory, ergo so here.

Deodate on Matthew. 19 14. so far are you deceived in thinking that children,
by reason of their weakness and contemptible quality; are unworthy to be
presented unto me: that contrariwise no body is capable of my Kingdom unles he
be first by the spirit of regeneration brought into a spiritual estate to be
like a little child in the order of nature. The new annot: on the Bible on
Matthew. 19. 14. ye have no reason to blame them for bringing children to me;
for they may be such as have interest to the Kingdom of heaven, as well as
others of ripe years: and, unless ye be like them, ye shall never come
there, chapter 18. 3.

But says Master Blake, Christ had never been so much displeased with his
Disciples for forbidding them, seeing their election and justification was to
the Disciples wholly unknown, they had a present visible title, such as the
Apostles ought to have known. I answer, The reason of Christ's anger was their
hindering him in his design, not the knowledge they had of their present
visible title: this is but a dream.

I added further, that Christ's action in this was extraordinary, and so no
ordinary rule for baptizing by the Public ministry. Mr Blake would have me
consider how this can stand with that I said before, that they that brought the
Infants might do it without faith in Christ, as the Messiah upon the fame of
his miracles, and account that he was a Prophet. I answer, there is no
opposition, they might conceive him to be but a Prophet, not the Messiah: and
yet Christ might act as an extraordinary Prophet, and as the Messiah, Mr Blake
says, this act of Christ is no direct preced^^ for baptism, but for
Church Priviledges of which Infants are capable. Mark this speech, if [but] be
adversative, then Master Blake grants that Infants are capable of
Church Priviledges, not of baptism, which overthrowes all his dispute; but the
truth is, this thing was done to these Infants, not by reason of any (...)
title they had, or to enter them into any outward Church-priviledge, but to
accomplish by his blessing, their interest in the invisible Kingdom of God by
election.

Master Blake in the close of this chapter says, if it were true, that
padobaptisme had no more warrant then I conceive, yet (...) not will worship,
but a misapplication of an instituted ordinance to a person. But I ask Master
Blake, whether Infant-Communion were not will worship? whether baptizing of
bells were not will worship? and yet these are but misapplications of an
instituted ordinance to a wrong subject. We have the word will worship but
once, Col. 2. 23. and if it be taken in the worser sense, as Protestant Divines
hitherto have done (though lately Doctor Hammond at Oxford has written a book
to prove it to be taken in the better part for a commendable thing as a
free-well offering) and have made it the sin of the Pharisees Matthew. 15. 9.
and especially non-conformists, who have made every invented ceremony
will worship, then much more Infant Baptism being worship it self, if it be
not instituted, must be will worship.

Chapt. 15. Master Blake examines what I say,. 21. That God seals not to every
person that is rightly baptized, that his Covenant of grace belongs only to
the elect, that his Covenant is effectual, and leaves it not to man's liberty
to include or exclude himself.
Examen page 164. about Gods sealing. Master Marshall spoke of Gods sealing the
baptized; I said, God seals not to every one that is baptized, but only to
true believers: For his sealing, is the confirming of his promise; but God
promises righteousness to none but true believers. Master Blake answers. You
acknowledge baptism to be is its nature a seal of the righteousness of
faith, and to be of God, therefore in it God must seal to every baptized
person, or else you must say they are not baptized. I reply: I acknowledge
baptism of professors of faith to be of God, though they be not true
believers: and I acknowledge baptism in its nature to be a seal of the
covenant of God, but not a seal actual, but aptitudinall; that is, all right
baptism is in its nature apt to seal, as a garland hung out is to signify wine
to be ^old, yet actually the one signifies so only to the intelligent, and the
other only to true believers. And God never seals actually till a person be a
believer. I said; As for the sealing by God upon condition persons ag^ize the
Covenant, it is but a notion; the Scripture makes not Gods promise in the
Covenant of grace conditional in that sense. For Gods promise is for those he
enters into Covenant with, that he will put his laws in their (...) and in
their minds will (...) them, Heb. 10. 16. Master Blake answers. If you (...)
this of the Sacraments as the words bear, then according to your opinion none
ought to be baptized, but (...) in whose heart the law in wrote. I answer him,
By Gods sealing I do not mean every right administration of baptism; for
though that be in its nature apt to seal the graces of the Covenant, yet
actually Gods seals not but when it is administered to a believer. It may be
called a right act of the administratour according to Gods appointment, but not
Gods sealing. I call Gods sealing only when either by his spirit or oath, or
outward rite, he assures his grace, as by circumcision to Abraham, Romans 4. 11.
he appointed Ismael to be circumcised, but did not seal to him righteousness
by faith. The inference Mr Blake makes from my words, as if I held none
baptizable, but those in whose heart Gods law is written, has no color, for I
do not make the administratours baptizing, or, since they will have it so
called, sealing,, to be Gods sealing. God appoints the word to be preached to
many hypocrites, and the preacher that assures them of the promises does it by
Gods appointment, yet God does not assure the promises to them. I do not make
him only baptizable to whom God seals, but him whom Christ appoints to be
baptized, whether God seals to him or no. Master Blake urges me with
Bellarmines argument; of the Sacraments be seals of grace, they are often
false, and God should bear witness to a lie, and tells of the speech of some
that have said, that this argument is unanswerable; unless we confess that
the seal of the Sacrament is conditional. I like not to call the Sacrament a
conditional seal, for that which seals does assure, and supposes the
condition: In my apprehension, that which is called conditional sealing is not
sealing but offering, or propounding, or representing: but about this I will
not contend. Yet in that sense I yield it to be a seal actually, I yield it to
be a seal only to believers, but I deny that because the Sacrament is in its
nature a seal of grace, God does seal always when it is rightly administered.
The nature of it is to be a seal aptitudinall, not actual; and so it is easy
to answer Bellarmines argument, without crossing my speeches. But be the
Sacraments s^ales conditional or absolute, actual or aptitudinall, what is
this to prove that God seals conditionally in this sense, as if God left it to
man's liberty, to whom he had sealed, to agnize or recognize that sealing, or to
free themselves, if they please, and so nullify all; yet so as to afford them a
while the favor, and privilege of being in Covenant with him, which Master
Marshall I conceived meant by his conditional sealing, and I find not in his
answer a denial of it to be his meaning. Master Blake excepts against a speech
of mine, in which I say, That all the Sacraments of the Jews are abrogated
circumstance, and substance in whole and in part: and asks me. Is circumcision
of heart abrogated? Is all spiritual meat and drink in Sacraments abrogated?
Is Christ himself abrogated? I answer, no: but withal say, these are idle
questions as not crossing my speech, unless he can prove circumcision of the
heart, spiritual meat and drink, and Christ himself to be Sacraments.

Sect. 2. Master Blake would acquit this speech, Gods Covenant of grace is
common to elect and reprobates from symbolizing with Arminians, by producing
the speeches of Pareus, and Mr Ball who only say reprobates are in Covenant
with God externally, or God externally contracts with them, which is another
thing. Gods Covenant of grace, is his promise of grace; and of this truly,
Master Marshall in his defense page 117. multitudes were baptized, to whom God
yet never gave saving graces, and therefore never promised them; for had he
made a promise, he would have performed it. Master Blake makes the nature of a
Covenant an agreement between two parties, and says, a promise or tender
without consent, is no Covenant. How then do children Covenant at baptism, or
enter into Covenant who yield no consent? He says, Gods tender of himself to
his people is called his Covenant. Genesis 17. 7. 9. But he does not rightly call
that a tender, which was more then a tender to wit a promise. Then he objects
against himself, that if Gods Covenant be such as he will not break, Jerem.
31. 32. and he has promised to put his laws in their inward parts, then they
all to whom he makes Covenant must be elect. I answer says he, if we take the
words exactly, as in the letter of the prophecy they run. then all ministry is
beaten down, and all edification ceases. But this is litem lite resolvere. The
Contraremon strantes when they urge this place for effectual grace, understand
the words exactly. But how will Master Blake understand them? I have looked
over almost two leaves in answer to this in Master Blake, and cannot tell how
he will understand them; nor find I that he gives any direct answer to the
objection, but wanders in impertinences. Nor know I how he can answer the
objection without evervating the argument for effectual grace and perseverance
in it. And the not teaching one another there spoken of is meant of that
obscure teaching which was under the Law.

Sect. 3. He intimates that I have misreported Master Marshall, but Master
Marshall has not himself denied the sense I conceived of his conditional
sealing by God to Infants, the words are plain enough in his Sermon, page 49.
where he talks of Gods Covenant, and sealing, and Christ's suretiship, more
like Corvinus, or the Arminans, then the Scripture or Contraremonstrants.
Master Blake accuses me of joining with Independents, and that they will have
none Church members, but elect, and I no Church but that which is invisible.
But I believe he wrongs both me and them; me I am sure, for I always teach a
visible profession sufficient for Chuch-membership, though I deny that every
visible professor is in the Covenant of grace; and when they will have real
saints Church members, they mean not only such as are so before God, but such
as are so in the judgment of the Church Though I think they are more rigid
then they should be in their tenet, yet I think Master Blake wrongs them in
this imputation.

Chapter 16. Of Mr Blakes unjust crimmination of me as putting the children of
believers out of the covenant of grace, and the epilogue of this postscript.
I told Mr Marshall that his speech of Anabaptists as condemning infants as out
of the state of grace, condemning all the infants of the whole Church of Christ
as having nothing to do with the Covenant of Grace, till proved by some of
their testimonies I should take to be but a false accusation. Mr Blake tel^me
Master Marshall for a testimony needs look no further then the ^op of your
leaf, where you say infant baptism is a corruption of the ordinance of
baptism; If infants be not only held from baptism, but their baptism is also
a corruption of that ordinance, and there is no such thing as
Covenant-holinesse to give them any ti^le or interest, then they are out of
covenant, strangers to the promises of God, and so the doom Ephesians. 2. 12. lies
heavy upon them. How frivolous a justification is this of an express and deep
accusation of men of a rash and bloody sentence as condemning all the infants
of the whole Church of Christ, as having nothing to do with the covenant of
grace; me thinks a man that would accuse so expressly so many persons, and
those christian brethren not to be contemned of so deep, so passion-provoking a
charge enough to stir up Magistrates and parents to expel and destroy such
men, should produce better evidence for such a crimination, then such a far
fetched consequence as Mr Blake here brings, to make it good is neither my name
nor peace more tenderly regarded by Master Blake then upon such light inference
to accuse me so deeply? I had said to Mr Marshall that if the covenant of grace
be rightly understood, Mr Marshall excludes infants as much from the covenant
of grace as I do. As for Mr Blake not only page 14 of his Birth-priviledge,
but also page 23 of his answer to my letter, he expressly maintains that the
birthright he maintains as a fruit from the covenant of free grace to all in
the faith, and their seed only entitles to outward privileges. How does this
stand with that which he asserts chap. 3. sect. 2. of his answer to my letter,
page 13. that infants of believers have salvation if they dye in their infancy,
by virtue of the Covenant? For if the Covenant only entitle to outward
privileges how does it entitle to salvation? So that to speak plainly, Mr
Blake does but play fast and loose, sometimes asserting a certainty of
salvation from the covenant, sometimes only a right to outward privileges;
and yet he and Mr Marshall stick not to declaim against Anabaptists, for not
assuring salvation to the deceasing infants of believers from that covenant
which Mr Marshall will not assert, page 116. as it is a Covenant of saving
grace to be made to believers and their natural seed, and Mr Blake says,
only entitles to outward privileges. But we say, says Master Blake that all
infants and men of years for ought that we can find from any Scripture grounds
are utterly lost that want all right of Baptism. He might say they are in
danger to be lost by reason of original corruption, not for want of right to
Baptism; but to say they are utterly lost is more then Mr Blake has ground to
affirm. I have often showed that a right to baptism is from the command of
Christ, not from such covenant holiness as Mr Blake asserts: salvation comes
from Gods election and Christ's redemption. It is a mere slander, and a
groundless crimination, wherewith Mr Blake charge me, that the position he
produces out of my book, or any other he can produce does infer, that all
the infants of the whole Church of Christ have nothing to do with the Covenant
of grace. I challenge him, with Mr Marshall and Mr Blakes seconds Mr Calamy and
Mr Vines, if they can to make that charge good; or else let Mr Blake and Mr
Marshall retract it. As for Mr Blakes conclusion, I conceive his Prot^station
makes him deservedly the object of pity, his motions carry a sting in the
tail, to wit a false accusation, from which I doubt not but I have acquitted my
self by this writing. The elogy the worthy member of the house of Commons
bestows on me, and the unrighteous censure of my learned namelesse
acquaintance I value not; books as meats relish differently with different
palates, pro captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli: This apollogy will state
me, and my writing better in their thoughts* if they can and will understand
the truth. If not, the same spirit that has enabled me to bear greater
burdens, I trust will enable me to bear these hard censures. I hope that I
shall not be wanting to the overthrow of any errors, according to my ability;
paedobaptisme I am more assured then ever is a great corruption, founded as now
it is taught on very great errors, and of any service I suppose I can do to
God it is one of the chief which I ought to apply my self to, that it may be
cleared to be an error. I bear as much love and reverence to M. Blake as ever,
he is not despised by me though his errors be freely censured. I aimed not
either in the former or in this latter writing at any grievance to him, and
should be sorry this controversy should make a separation between us* though I
find by experience much estrangednes in many of my former acquaintance from me.
And for encountering with Mr Blake for the truths sake I held my self
necessitated to it by reason of Mr Vines and M. Calamy their former, and
latter, as I still conceive, inconsiderate plaudite.
