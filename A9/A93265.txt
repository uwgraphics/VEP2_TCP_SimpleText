A LAMENTATION FOR THE Lost Sheep Of the House of ISRAEL.

With an Invitation to have them turn in their minds to the true Shepherd of
their souls.

ALSO Something in discovery of the nakedness of all professions who are found
in the words without the life and power.

Written by one of the children of the Light, who is known to the world by the
name of MARTMA SIMMONS.

I have seen also in the Prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing, they commit
adultery, and walk in lies; they strengthen also the hand of evil doers, that
none does return from his wickedness; they are all of them unto me as Sodom,
and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorah,

Jer. 23.14. Awake awake put on thy strength O Sion, put on thy beautiful
garments O Jerusalem, the holy City, for henceforth there shall no more come
into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean,

Eagle at the West end of Paul's. 1655.

A LAMENTATION For the lost Sheep of the House of Israel.
OH England England when art thou; groping in the dark and stumbling at noon
day; art thou grown so high in thy fallen wisdom, and in the pride of thy
heart, that thou can not stoop to a measure of God in thee? thou high
professor, and thou wild wanton one, thou runst to fast over the field to
find the Pearl; there is a Royal Diadem hid in thy unclean heart, which
never consented to the evil thereof; Oh that thou would harken to it that
thy inward eye might be opened, then would thou see the beauty of it: surely
if thou did but see thy soul in death, and a measure of the light and life
of Jesus there, checking, calling, and knocking, to have thee turn in thy
mind to it, that thou may be purged and oleansed, and that it may shine
forth and bring up thy soul out of the horrible pit; then would thou begin
to know indeed what pure redemption is: And here may thou come to see that
faith which purifies the heart, which is the real substance of things hoped
for, and this would be of more value to thee then thousands of Gold and Silver:
Oh vain and foolish man and woman that makes not God thy trust, but trusts in
the arm of flesh, and in the multitude of thy conceivings; how soon art thou
affrighted and palenesse strikes thee in the face, and the least stirring or
rushing in the creation makes thy knees smite together and thy countenance
fall, and this is because thou art in Caines condition, and have no habitation
in God; and though thou may offer a Sacrifice, and pray, and cry, and
confess thy sins, and cover the Alter with tears, and give thy body to be
burnt, it in that nature it is not accepted. But this I shall say to thee, Oh
that thou could but hear; if thou would but submit thy neck to the yoke of
Christ, the measure of him in thee, that thou may see him to work in thee
and thy own works laid aside, thou would find more peace and satisfaction
both to soul and body; and then should thou see him who is the Rock of ages
to be thy Rock, and strong defense, and then should thou see a war begin
contrary to thy will and him that brings into the war and carries through, and
then there would be nothing to do on thy part but to stand still and keep thy
mind in, girt up to him that works, and then thou will come to see what it is
to follow the Lamb through the tribulation; but if thou will not improve thy
measure of Light, but wilt run on in thy headstrong rebellion against that
little secret love that checks thee in private, and shows thee thy heart when
none else can, and if thou slight this day of small things, then will this
precious Pearl, the measure of Light, be taken from thee and given to him that
is more worthy; and the gnawing worm will enter into thee, which will never
die, but will torment thee to all eternity, and then will thou be shut up in
darkness and unbelief; where thou may say to thy soul, take thy thine
ease, eat drink and be merry, for to morrow shall be as this day, and much
more; but thou fool in this night, of thy darkness, shall thy soul be taken
from thee, and then what will thy small time of pleasures do thee good? will
they not ad to thy torment? therefore I counsel thee to prise thy time, and be
still and staid and seek dilligently for that messenger, who is one of a
thousand, who brings the glad tidings, who is the true teacher that cannot be
removed into a corner, the corner stone, who if thou abide will break thy heart
to pieces, and will convince thee of thy sin, and of thy righteousness, and
bring his pure Judgments upon it, that his r^ghteousnesse may appear.

And now to you high Priests of this Nation; and teachers of all sorts of
opinions, who have been groping and hunting in your wisdom to find out that
precious Pearl to defile in your filthy nature; but you have not yet found it,
nor cannot find the door to enter into the kingdom, nor get your starved
hearers a little bread of assurance of eternal life; only this you can do to ad
to your condemnation, gather up the Saints conditions of sufferings and
patience, who were persecuted by the same proud high flowne nature that you are
in, and you add your meanings to them, and so bring the curses that are written
in that book upon your heads, it is time for you now, seeing you cannot find a
way, to give over stealing from your neighbor, and be content with that you
have, and let the people alone to the measure of God in them, that that may
guide them into the way that they may find bread for their souls; and seeing
you will not enter your selves, do not shut the kingdom against them, in
laying stumbling blocks before them, and raising up false accusations against
the Light and those that walk in it, and casting a lie into the mouths of the
ignorant people, in saying the letter is the word, when the letter declares
that the word was in the beginning, by which word the world was made, which
word all the Saints and servants of God was ever guided by; which word enquired
of your father Caine for Abels blood, which word translated Enoch, which word
called Abraham out of his own country to follow the Lord in a strange land, who
was no vagrant person, which word called Moses from the glory of Pharaohs
house, which word in due time was made marisest in flesh, who wandered up and
down n dens and caves of the earth, who had no certain abiding place, and yet
he was no vagabond, whom your generation crucified, who is risen again, and
has taken upon him the seed of Abraham, who is now appeared in this day of his
power, to gather up his elect into himself, and to rip off all your deceitful
coverings, and lay you open to the shame of the Heathen; and this is the word
that we witness to lead and guide and command us whose minds are staid in it;
and this word moves us into your Idols temple, and to other private meetings,
to discover your Image of mixture of several opinions, until you stop our
mouths, and hale us forth, and deliver us up to your Rulers, who second you in
your persecution, who imprison us, and scourge, and stock, and stone, and
despitefully use us, and by the power of this word are we brought through these
tribulations, and have joy in the midst of them, and when we are reviled we
revile not again taking patiently all that you have power in your wills to
inflict upon us, and we are made able to desire the Lord not today these things
to your charge, and that he would open your eyes that you might see what you
are a doing, and the (...) would soon cease your rage and find enough to do
within in your own hearts; and by this word we see the Scriptures were given
forth from this word, and as we come into these several conditions and
measures that the Saints were in that spoke forth this Declaration, we can set
to our seal that the Scriptures are true, and they are ours that live in the
life, and not yours who despise the life, and feed your selves with words, and
gather up to your selves great riches, in that nature, you eat greedily of the
tree of knowledge, and now if you could but get to eat of the tree of life you
would soon be above God, but that you cannot do, for there stands a flaming
sword that turns every way to keep you out, so that all that comes there comes
through it and leaves all the first wisdom behind; and therefore if any of
you be found worthy to come down to the measure of Christ and submit your necks
to his yoke it will be good for you, but not many rich nor many wise do come
to know these things; and we have the Promise of this word, that he will be
with us unto the end of the world, and we know that his Promise is yea and amen.

And now all people that has sobriety, and love to your souls, come out from
among these Idol dumb Shepherds that feed themselves, but not you, and if you
put not into their mouths they will soon show violence to you: come out from
among them, and be no longer partaker of their uncleanness, for they are
broken cisterns that can no longer hold water; and come into the fountain that
runs forth freely, the streams whereof would refresh your hungry fainting
souls: in my fathers house there is bread enough: Oh why will you perish for
hunger? mind the light the measure of Christ in you, that with it you may see
where you are, that you may see his eternal love, how he calls and invites you
into the kingdom, that he may take off your filthy garments, that he may
cloth you with the garment of righteousness, and marry you unto himself; and
now the day of his mighty power is appeared, and the fountain of life set open
to wash and cleanse you from your sins, and baptize you into his death and
sufferings: Oh be not stubborn and stiff-necked against him, for we that do
follow him do find his paths pleasant pure and sweet, and the further we
follow him in the straight gate and narrow way, we see that his love is past
finding out: And now in the tenderness of my heart longing for your souls
good am I made open to you, having had a habitation in this City of London
sometime; for seven years together I wandered up and down the streets enquiring
of those that had the Image of honesty in their countenance, where I might
find an honest Minister, for I saw my soul in death, and that I was in the
first nature, and wandering from one Idols temple to another, and from one
private meeting to another, I heard a sound of words amongst them but no
substance I could find, and the more I sought after them the more trouble came
on me, and finding none sensible of my condition, I kept it in, and kept all
close within me; and about the end of seven years hunting, and finding no rest,
the Lord opened a little glimerings of light to me, and quieted my spirit; and
then for about seven years more he kept me still from running after men, and
all this time I durst not meddle with any thing of God, nor scarce take his
name in my mouth, because I knew him not, it living wild and wanton not
knowing a cross to my will I spent this time; it something I found breathing
in me groaning for deliverance, crying out, oh when shall I see the day of thy
appearance; about the end of the last seven years the Lord opened my eyes to
see a measure of himself in me, which when I saw I waited diligently in it,
and being faithful to it I found this Light more and more increase, which
brought me into a day of trouble, and through it, and through a warefare and to
the end of it, and now has given me a resting place with him; and this is my
beloved, and this is my friend O daughters of Jerusalem: And now all that have
a desire to come this way must lay down your Crowns at the feet of Jesus, for
now a profession of words will no longer cover, for the Lord is come to look
for fruit, all types and shadows is flying away; and he that will come in may
inherit substance, and he that will not shall be left naked.

FINIS.
