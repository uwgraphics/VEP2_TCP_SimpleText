A Prayer before the Receiving of the Holy Sacrament.
O Heavenly Father, fit me with a lively Faith, profound humility, filial
obedience, inflamed affections, and universal charity: O raise in my Soul, all
those heavenly transports of zeal and devotion, of love and desire, of joy and
delight, of praise and thanksgiving, which becomes the remembrance of a
crucified Savior, which becomes one redeemed by the Blood of God, and that for
his sake only that redeemed me, in whose holy Words I sum up all the Graces and
Blessings I stand in need of. Our Father, etc.

A Thanksgiving after Receiving the Sacrament.
O How plentiful is thy goodness, my Lord, and my God, which thou have laid up
for those that fear thee, and put their trust in thy Mercy!

Was it not love infinite enough dearest Lord, to give thy self for me on the
Cross? Was not that Sacrifice of thy self sufficient to expiate the Sins of the
whole World? What, Lord, could thou then do more for me?

O dearest Lord, raise thou my Devotion to the highest pitch it can possibly
reach, to praise thee; enlarge my Soul to its utmost extent to love thee Amen

A Praer for the Morning.
BLessed be God, for keeping me this Night past. God bless me, and keep me from

night and for ever, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

A More notable Instance of True saving Knowledge than what I am going to lay
before you, as a worthy pattern to guide and direct your lives and
conversations by, has perhaps been seldom or never recorded, especially in

wherein all manner of Abominations, with Grief I speak it, are so much
countenanced, etc.

Elizabeth Robinson, was the Daughter of John Robinson, a very reputable Mercer
in the Parish of St. Martins in the fields: she was carefully, by her Religious
Father taught and well acquainted with the Holy Scriptures: But it deed there
appeared nothing extraordinary in her, till toward the 11th year of her Age,
at which time it pleased God to visit her with a sharp fit of Sickness, during
the continuance whereof one asked her, what she thought would become of her if
she should dye? She answered. That she was afraid she should go to Hell. Being
asked why she harbored such Thoughts, she replied, Because she feared she did
not love God. Again, being asked how she did know she did not love God? she
replied, What have I done for God ever since I was born? Being asked again,
Whether she was not sorry that she could not love God? she answered, Yes; but
was still afraid it was to late: some few Months After this she had a discovery
o^ he approaching Death which was no small comfort to her: Anon, said she, I
shall be with Christ, and I shall live, with him for ever. So she dyed between
a Eleven and Twelve years old.
