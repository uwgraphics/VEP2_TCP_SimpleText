To the Right Honorable, the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembed.
The humble Petition of the Gentry, Ministers, Freeholders, and other
substantial Inhabitants of the County of York.
Shows,
THat they cannot be afraid themselves, or any other shall incur your
displeasures for declaring their just fears in an humble way, or representing
that these general distractions have a more powerful influence and operation
upon this particular County, then upon any other member or part of this
Kingdom, whereby for diverse years last past, it has endured the miseries
which inevitably follow Armies, paying nevertheless Taxes and Subsidies
equally to other Counties which have been free from those Burdens and
Pressures, and have besides laid out great sums of Money for billeting
Soldiers (whereof a very small part is hitherto re-imbursed) to the great
exhausting the whole County, and ruin of diverse Persons and Families: Yet the
discontented Retirement of his Majesty from You his great Council, and the
different Commands since severally issuing and proceeding, especially
concerning the Militia, which distracts the minds of all who desire to build up
their obedience upon a sure and known foundation, and the great distaste His
Majesty takes to have a Garrison, without His allowance, kept so near his
sacred Person, and the many inconveniences which may from thence arise to this
County, do make us already sensible of more dangerous effects then have
hitherto befallen us, especially seeing thereby Trade and Commerce (the very
subsistence of this County) which hitherto stayed in all the late noise of
Arms and Tumults, is now driven away and frighted from among us, whereby we
suffer before hand, the ruinous consequences of a real War, and from thence
apprehend the greatest of calamities to follow, unless Gods blessing and a
speedy union do happily prevent them from the sense of those imminent
mischiefs, and consideration of his Majestis Expressions of his good
intentions and endeavors for peace, and a right understanding, we are bold in
all humility to petition:

That a timely ^emedy may be applied, lest our Disease grow desperately past
Cure without such applications as may endanger the vital Spirits of the
Kingdom: That since your selves have declared his Majesty's absence to be the
maine hindrance of this necessary Work, and his Majesty expressed his
willingness to return when you shall give life to the Laws of the Land, for
his security against Tumults; That his Majesty may receive such assurance, for
his secure residing in all places, and such invitations as may allure His abode
with you, His great Council; That such a due regard may be had for the
reparation of his Majesty's Honor, as well in this unfortunate business of
Hull, as (where it has in any sort been blemished, and where he may justly
expect it) together with the safety of the Kingdom, as may evidence to all the
world, that nothing is dearer to us then the security and glory of our King and
Kingdom, whose Honor and Reputation, both at home and abroad, must stand and
fall together: That his Majesty's gracious Message of the twentieth of January
(which your selves then so termed, and gave humble thanks for) as also his
others since his retirement, may be taken into such serious consideration, as
may give hopes to all good Subjects of an effectual concurrence: That we may
not be distracted by contrary Commands, but that the known Law of the Land,
which we humbly conceive is the fundamental Liberty of the subject, and no
arbitrary Government may be the rule of our Obedience, and the guide and
determiner of all our Actions and Differences: And we according to our
Allegiance, shall be ready to maintain His Majesty's Royal Person, Crown,
and Dignity, His just Rights and Prerogative, together with the lawful
Privileges of Parliament, the just Liberty of the subject, the true Protestant
Profession, and the Peace of the Land.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.
