WHereas a printed paper was lately put forth in the names of some of the
Trustees for Ministers maintenance, wherein amongst other things they take upon
them without warrant to discharge all Incumbents from whom any First Fruits are
due, from paying the same unto Mr. Thomas Baker at the First Fruits Office in
the Strand in the County of Middlesex, These are to give notice to all persons
concernd, that they are notwithstanding to apply themselves to the accustomed
place and persons, for dispatch of all businesses which have or do belong to
the said Office, it being an Office established by several Acts of Parliament
never yet repealed nor altered by the present or any former Government, and
that they pay their moneys there, where their securities remain, which shall be
delivered up to them upon payment of the same, and without which they can no
way be legally discharged or secured by any other persons upon any pretense
whatsoever, nor free themselves from the process of the Court of Exchequer,
which in discharge of the Officers duty must be issued, to bring all persons
concerned to conformity in payment of the States Revenew.

Dated at the First Fruits Office aforesaid, the Eighteenth day of November
1655. Thomas Baker.
