LONDON, Printed for J. B. Maii 5. in the Year, 1642.

TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.
The Humble desires of the COMMISSIONERS of your Majesty's Kingdom of Scotland.

We your Majesty's humble and faithful Subjects, considering that the mutual
relation, betwixt your Majesty's Kingdoms of Scotland, and England, is such
that they must either stand or fall together, and the disturbance of the one,
must needs dis-quiet and distemper the Peace of the other, as has been often
acknowledged by them both, and especially in the late Treaty which is ratified
in Parliament, and confirmed by the public Faith of the estates of your
Majesty's ancient and Native Kingdom of Scotland, so that they are bound to
maintain the Peace and liberties of one another being highly concerned
therein, as the assured means of the safety and preservation of their own;
and finding our Selves warranted and obliged, by all means to labor to keep
a right understanding betwixt your Majesty, and your People: to confirm that
Brotherly affection begun betwixt the two Nations: To advance their Unity by
all such ways, as may tend to the glory of God, and peace of the Church and
State of both Kingdoms, and likewise to proffer our Service for the removing
all Jealousies, and mistakings which may arise betwixt your Majesty and this
Kingdom, and our best Endeavors for the better establishment of the affairs
and quiet of the same. That both your Majesty's Kingdoms of Sco^land and
England, may be United in the enjoying of their liberties in Peace under your
Majesty's Scepter, which is the most assured Foundation of your Majesty's
Honor and Greatness, and of the security of your Royal Person, Crown and
Dignity. We have taken the boldness to show to your Majesty, that we are
heartily Sorry and greived, to behold these distractions which increase daily
betwixt your Majesty and your People, and which we conceive are Entertained
by the wicked Plots and practices of Papists Prelates, and their Adherents,
whose aim in all these Troubles, has bin not only to prevent all further
Reformation, but also to subvert the Purity, and truth of Religi^n, within all
your Majesty's Kingdoms; For which end their constant endeavors have been to
stir up divisions betwixt your Majesty and your people, by their Questioning
the Authority of Parliaments, and the lawful liberties of the Subjects, and
really weakening your Majesty's power, and Authority Royal, upon pretense of
extending the same, whereof by Gods providence being disappointed in your
Majesty's Kingdom of Scotland, They have now converted their mischievous
Counsels, Conspiracies and Attempts, to produce these distempers in your
Majesty's Kingdom of England and Ireland: And therefore according to our duty
to your Majesty, to Testify, our Brotherly affection to this Kingdom and
acquit our Selves of the trust im^osed upon us* we do make offer of our
humble Endeavors for composing of these differences and to that purpose do
beseech your Majesty in these Extremities, to have recourse to the sound and
faithful advise of the Honorable Houses of Parliament, and to repose thereupon
as the only assured and happy means to establish the Prosperity and Quiet of
this Kingdom, and in the depth of your Royal, Wisdom, to consider and
prevent these apprehensions of Fear which may possess the hearts of your
Majesty's Subjects in your other Kingdoms, if they shall conceive the
Authority of Parliaments, and the Right and Liberties of the Subject to be here
called in question, And we are confident if your Majesty shall be graciously
pleased to take in good part, and give ear to these our Faithful, and humble
desires, that the success of your Majesty's affairs howsoever now perplexed,
shall be happy to your Majesty, and Joyful to all your People, over whom
that your Majesty may long and Prosperously Reign, is the constant and
fervent Prayer of us your Majesty's Faithful Subjects, and Servants.

A MESSAGE OF THANKS Delivered To the Lords, COMMISSIONERS for SCOTLAND, by
Mr. PYM.
My LORDS,
We are commanded by the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, of the House of
Commons, now Assembled in this present Parliament, in the name of themselves
and the whole Commons of England, to present to you their hearty and
affectionate thanks for your wise Counsels and faithful advice given to his
sacred Majesty, for the appeasing and removing of the present distraction and
distempers of this State.

My Lords, The House of Commons are very sensible, and do tenderly and
affectionately consider, that this your dutiful and faithful advise, is a
large Testimony of your fidelity to the King, affection to this State, and of
Wisdom, for honor, security and peace of his Majesty, and both Kingdoms,
and not only very acceptable to this House, but likewise of great advantage to
both Nations.

They clearly perceive, you rightly understand the causes of our distempers,
and your careful Endeavors to complie with them in the quieting and removing
of the same: That the Brotherly Communion lately Confirmed by both Parliaments
of England and Scotland, bind them both to maintain the Peace and liberties
of one another, being highly concerned equally therein, as the assured means
of the safety and preservation of both, and being so united, the disturbance
of the one must needs disquiet and distemper the peace of the other, as has
bin often acknowledged by them both. They are likewise sensible that those
Ways which you in your Wisdoms have advised his Majesty to take, are the
only means to settle peace and unity in this Kingdom, which are:

First, to endeavor to procure a right understanding between his Majesty and
his People, by which his Majesty may truly understand the real causes of
these disturbances, and who are the Authors thereof, who are his faithful and
loyal Subjects, who are his faithful and dutiful Counselors, and who not:
by this means shall the Brotherly affection begun betwixt the two Nations be
confirmed by all such means as may tend to the glory of GOD, and peace of the
CHURCH and State of both Kingdoms, will their unity be advanced, and all
mistakes and Jealousies which may arise betwixt his Majesty and this Kingdom
be removed, and the establishment of the affairs and quiet of the same, settled
in such a manner as may be the Perpetual Peace and Tranquillity of the same:
the liberties and Privileges of his Majesty's Subjects freely Enjoyed under
his Royal Scepter, which is the most Assured Foundation of his Majesty's
Honor and Greatness, of the security of his Royal Person, Crown and
dignity.

Secondly, the Removal and prevention of all such Plots and practices which
they conceive are entertained by the Papists, Prelates, and their Adherents,
whose aim in all these troubles has bin not only to prevent all further
Reformation, but also to Subvert the purity and Truth of Religion within all
his Majesty's Kingdoms, for which end their constant Endeavors have been to
stir up Division betwixt his MAJESTY and his People, by their Questioning
the authority of Parliaments and the lawful Liberties of the Subjects, and
really weakening his Majesty's power and authority Royal, upon pretense of
defending the same, which Mischievous Counsels, Conspiracies and Attempts,
has produced these Distempers in his Majesty's Kingdoms of England and
Ireland.

Thirdly, that his Majesty would be pleased to have recourse only to the
sound and Faithful advise of his Parliament, and to depend thereupon as the
Assured and happy means to establish the Prosperity and quiet of this
Kingdom, and in his Royal Wisdom to consider and Prevent these
Apprehensions of Fear which may possess the Hearts of his Majesty's Subjects
in his Majesty's other Kingdoms, if they shall conceive the Authority of
Parliaments, and the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects to be here called in
question. My LORDS,

These your Faithful and Loyal propositions is the greatest demonstration of
your affections Faithfully United and devoted to the security of his Majesty,
and your hearty wishes and desires of the Peace and prosperity, as well of his
Majesty's Kingdom of England as Scotland and Ireland: these Propositions have
been the only Endeavors and Intentions of his MAJESTY'S High Court of
Parliament, to effect and make manifest to all men; And in any other means
whatsoever that shall by you be conceived necessary to the composeing and
settling of these present distractions, they declare themselves desirous to have
the same communicated unto them, and they shall be right joyful and thankful
therefore, and will willingly and cheerfully join with you in the same.

FINIS.
