To the Right Honorable the Lords and Commons in PARLIAMENT assembled. The
humble Petition of many thousands of well-affected inhabitants of the Counties
of Middlesex, Essex, Kent, Surrey, Hertford, Berks, Buckingham, Oxford,
Bedford, Sussex, Northampton, Dorset, Somerset, Lancaster, Lincoln, Chester,
Durham, Cumberland, Warwick and Worcester, against the intolerable Oppression
and Undoing Grievance of FREE QVARTER.
HUmbly with bended knees and bleeding hearts complaining to your honors,
That whereas Your Petitioners out of their good affections to this Parliament
have, during the late expensive Wars, exhausted their treasure, spent and lost
their Estates, hazarded their Lives, Limbs, and shed their dearest blood in
defense of Your honors, and our own just Rights and Liberties, the happy
fruits whereof we assuredly expected to reap, ever since the total dissipation
of his Majesty's Malignant Forces and Garrisons; yet so it is we find (to our
greatest grief and astonishment) our insupportable burdens and pressures every
day multiplied and increased, and our native Rights and Liberties more violated
and undermined of late then ever, and that not only by malicious enemies, but
by those you have raised to preserve, and have long promised to make us
Freemen; so as absolute necessity, and the sense of our own inevitable ruin
(if not of the whole kingdom too) enforce us to be no longer stupidly silent,
but to present our joint Complaints unto your Eyes in Print, which can find no
passage into your Ears or Houses in writing, by reason of other Intervenient
affairs of greater moment.

Be pleased therefore affectionately to receive this sad dolorous Information
of our present desperate condition, that besides the constant Tax of Excise and
other Contributions, Your impovered Petitioners are over-laden with a late
monthly Tax of sixty thousand Pounds, (which the Army press to be augmented
to one hundred thousand) to support a degenerated mutinous, seditious, and
Rebellious Soldiery, long since Voted by you to disband, who for diverse
months last past have refused to obey your Commands, infringed your
Privileges, impeached, suspended or expelled your faithful Members; unvoted
your Votes, repealed your Ordinances, removed you ancient Guards, and put new
of their own upon you; thrown down your defensive works, accused and shut up
some of your faithfullest friends as Traitors, divided the City and Country
from you, possessed themselves of all your Forts, if not of the Navy too,
ravished and kept the Kings Person out of your custody, yea lately plotted his
destruction; declared you for some time no Parliament, prescribed periods to
your sitting, voted down the House of Peers, and all old forms of Parliament to
set up a new-molded one of their own, and presented you frequently with such
seditious and treasonable Papers and Remonstrances, as your selves have (Nov.
9. 1647.) voted to be, destructive to the very being of Parliaments, and to the
Fundamental Government of the Kingdom; which yet they still press a fresh upon
you, erected a new Parliament a grand Counsel of State of their own at the Head
quarters, which receives and answers all public Petitions, resolves all
matters of State and Government upon the question, which they send to your
Honors as their underlings to confirm, print, publish Remonstrances,
Declarations and Edicts to you and us by their own special Or^ers, hold
intelligence with most dangerous Malignants in Arms, who reside in the Armies
quarters, are now more the Kings Army then Yo^^s, whose designs they have
driven on of late, and with whom their Grandees are now accorded, and rendered
you once the most powerful glorious and best-beloved Parliament ever England
had, now the most aydless, friendless, faithless, most il-beloved, despicable
and dishonorable Assembly that ever sat within English ground: when under
pretext of purging and reforming your Honors, and vindicating our lost
Freedoms, have by their late FREE QUARTERING upon us, rendered us no better
then mere conquered slaves (as some of them call us to our faces) and like so
many Egyptian Locusts seed so long upon us of free cost, till they, their
horses, wives and trulls, have totally consumed all the Money in our Purses,
the Corn in our Barns, the grass in our fields, the Hay, Oats, Pease and Beans
in our Stables, the stock in our grounds. the provisions in our houses, and
exposed us and ours this cold Winter season and time of scarcity to the
merciless jaws of penury and famine, now ready to devour us without pity or
relief, notwithstanding our many doleful complaints to your Honors and the
General for Redress.

This our deplorable condition constrains us to inform Your Honors, that the
Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament in the 3-year of his Majesty's reign
in their memorable Petition of Right, when only some two or three thousand
Soldiers and Mariners were thinly dispersed into diverse Counties of the Realm
and there billeted in men's houses against their wills but for one month or
two, and paid most of their quarters, did yet so tenderly resent this
inchroachment on our Freedoms, that they grievously complained thereof to his
Majesty in that Petition, AS A GREAT GREIVANCE AND VEXATION TO HIS PEOPLE
AGAINST THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF THE REALM, and humbly prayed as their Right
and Liberty, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, That he would
be pleased to remove the said Soldiers and Mariners; and that his people
might not be so burdened in time to come; Which his Majesty graciously
condescended unto as their just Right: And therefore since we have for some
months and years last past, been ten thousand times more oppressed with the
Quartering of Soldiers in our Houses against our Wills, then the whole
Kingdom was then, to our utter destruction, and breaking of our very backs and
hearts; and are clean eaten up to our very skins and bones, as many of your own
Members can witness, and the Army it self confesses in some of their late
published Papers: We do now humbly demand and challenge this at your hands, not
as a favor, but our Undoubted Right and Hereditary Freedom, which you have
faithfully engaged in sundry Remonstrances, and solemnly sworn in your
National Vow and Covenant to maintain with your lives, and for defense whereof
we have spent our blood and Estates in the late Wars, and to prevent our
imminent destruction, and the easing of our selves by general insurrections and
open violence, which we must be necessitated to, against our liking, if any
longer denied or delayed right, relief and ease herein, you will now at the last
forthwith publicly declare against and prohibit all free quartering on us for
the future against our wills under pain of Felony and death, discharge our
quarters already taken out of the Soldiers Arrears (who have raised and
received double if not treble their pay of us in free quarter alone) disband
all supernumerary forces and recruits entertained since January last, reduce
the Army to as small a number as possible, and that of such Officers and
Soldiers only who have taken the Covenant, and are neither Seditious nor
Schismatical; to be quartered only in common Victualing houses, Innes and
Alehouses, without allowing their horses provender (whiles they lie idle) in
this time of famine, when we our families and the poor are ready to famish for
want of bread: and that no Member of either House, their Sons, or dependants
sit in Counsel or may continue in office, belonging to the Army or any Ship,
any Garrison, to protract our troubles and payments for their private ends and
luchre.

And we shall ever pray for and live and dye with your Honors in all your just
proceedings. And prove a better and cheaper Guard to You and the Kingdom (if
put into a present posture of defense as they desire) then any indigent and
inconfiding Mercenaries.
