The West-Country Iigg: OR, A Trenchmore Galliard.
See how the Lads and Lasses flock together,
A Merry making, like Birds of a Feather;
Here Is Sam, and Sawny, gentle James and jonny,
With Moll and Moggy, and those Girls so bonny:
Where they had store of Mirth, and mickle laughter:
Therefore observe it, for the best comes after.
To a Merry Scotch Tune, Or, Up with Aley Aley, etc.





IAck's a naughty Boy
for calling his Mother Wh*
I Will tell you the reason why,
because she was one before:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with Frank so free,
In came wanton Willy,
and smuggl'd them hansomely.
Four and twenty Lasses
went over Trenchmore Lee,
And all of them were Mowed,
unless it were two or three
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with jumping J^an,
In came wanton Willy,
and then the game went on.
Jonny he played with Jonny,
and Jenny she played with Jock;
And he pulled out a Guinney,
to buy her a Holland Smock:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with Sue, and Siss,
And in came wanton Willy,
and then they Mump and Kiss.
Willy he teuk up Moggy,
and asked if she would Dance,
But oh! how she did Simper,
with many a wink, and glance:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with Bess so Brown;
In came wanton Willy,
and tumbled them upside down.


The Piper he struck ^^,
and Merrily he did play,
The shakeing of the sheets,
and eke the Irish hay:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with Priss and Prue;
In came wanton VVilly,
amongst the Jovial crew.
The Awd wife she came up.
and she began to Mutter,
I think you are all grown,
you make so great a clutter:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with Doll, and Jane*
In came wonton VVilly,
and Kissed them over again.
The Coague of Ale went round,
and each one drank a Health,
Their sorrows for to drowned,
they took no care for wealth:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with mincing Nan:
In came wanton VVilly,
and proved himself a Man.
The Parson of the Parish,
he left the Kirk in haste,
For at this merry meeting,
he would not be the last:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with Kate, and Joyce;
In came wanton VVilly,
and there he took his choice.
And thus with nappy Liquor,
their senses they did warm,
It made their wits the quicker,
they thought not any harm;
Then up with Aley, Aley,
with Boozy Bridget too;
In came wanton VVilly,
and he began to Woo.
Deal faw my lugs, quo Jammy,
My Friends I pray now hark
Let us conclude a Wedding,
to make the Parson wark:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with Sarah, and pegg:
In came wanton VVilly,
and there he danced a Jigg.
The bargain was agreed,
that Billy, he should have Bess,
And so they sent out Harry,
for to invite the Guess:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with Gillian fair:
In came wanton VVilly,
and them two made a pair.
Now with this jovial Wedding,
I do conclude my Song,
And wish that Trenchmore Lasses,
they may live merry and long:
Then up with Aley, Aley,
up with all the train:
We will all be merry,
if e're we meet again.
With Allowance.
