Prince ROBERTS disguises.
SIr, my best of wishes wait on you, J write to you the last week concerning
the passages of the Kings Army in and about Readding, but since they came to
Colebrooke, they have bin still the same, they are no changelings, they need no
pay from the King, for they pay themselves, and what they get with ease, they
do as freely spend, one night among the rest half a score of them being merry
at my house, and three or four of our Townsmen with them, thus one of them
related of Prince Robert, how that after the skirmish at Worcester, some two
days after he came to an old woman's house, being a widow within a mile of
the City, and asked her what victuals she had in the House, but not in the habit
that he wore in the field, but like a Country Gentleman, the old woman told
him she had nothing but Collops and Eggs, if he pleased to have any of them,
he should be welcome, to be short ready they were made and he fell too roundly,
afterward he called for some drink, she told him she had none but small
drink, J am a very pore widow, and have none but my self and my son, he asked
her where her son was, she told him gone to Worcester to hear what news of
the Cavaliers, for she heard say she thanked God for it, that his Excelency had
made them fly the City, a company of rude knaves among them, she was sure of
that they had half undone the City, if my son were come home he would tell
you more, he asked her what she did think of Prince Robert, a pox choke
Prince Robert said she, he might have kept him where he was borne, in his own
Country, this kingdom has been the worse ever since he landed, there is three
pieces for that word, for J am of thy mind.

With that he took Pen Jnke and Paper, and writ a note to the Major of
Worcester, to this effect, he had given unto this Widow three pieces the
bearer hereof for to co^ceale him from their searches which note he did injoine
her to give it with her ow^e hand for she would be rewarded nobly, What after
followed yet we know not.

The Generals army lying one Dunsemore heath, his powers not being far of he
riding as near the Army as he durst within a narrow Lane overtooke a fellow
driving a horse laden with apples, he asked what he had there, the fellow told
him he had apples and pears which he was carrying to Dansmore Heath, to sell
them to his Excelencies soldiers, why do not thou go to the Kings Army
replied the prince, J hear they are generous sparks and will pay double, oh
said the fellow they are Cavaliers, they have a mad Prince amongst them, J was
amonst them but J sold my ware at a very cheap rate, for the Devil penny J
could get in the whole Army.

The Prince asked him what he should give him for his load, ten shillings said
the fellow, hold thy hand said the Prince there is a piece for the, hold thou
my Horse and change habit with me, and stay here while J sell thy apples, only
for a merry humor that J have, and at my coming back Jle give the a piece
mo^e, the fellow was glad and willing, lent him his long Coat and Hat, away
went Prince Robert thorough all the Army, selling his apples at any rate,
viewing their strength, and in what kind they lay, and returned back again,
took his Horse, gave the fellow another piece, with this charge, to go to the
Army and ask the Commanders how they liked the fruit Prince Robert in his
own Person did but this morning sell them.

After the Battle at Keneton, Prince Robert, (his Excelencies Army being in
and about Warwick) within eight miles of the said City, was forced by reason
of the excess of rain, to take into a little Alehouse out of the way, where
he met with a fellow that was rideing to Warwick, but stayed there by chance
to drink, to sell Cabbage Nets, to boil Cabbage in, he bought the fellows
Nets, and gave him what he asked double, borrowed his Coat and told him he
would ride upon his Horse some four miles off, to put a trick upon some
friends of his, and return at Evening, leaving his own Nag and his Coat
behind, also he left a Crown in the Hostis^es hand for them to drink while
his return, when he came to Warwick, he sold his Nets at diverse places,
heard the News, which side the Battle went on, discovered many passages in
the Town, which having done he returned again, and took his own Horse, then
sent them word by him that he bought the Nets of that he had been with them,
and sold them Cabbage Nets, and withal he wished him to tell them that it
should not be long ere he would to requite the r kindness send them Cabbage.

Prince Robert in the shape of a woman, took water at Brainford, came up to
London this last week, was here a day and a half, viewed the Works, the
Forts, the Baricadoes and Ambuscadoes, the strength of all the City and
Suburbs, and in the same shape returned unto his Jnne, but he was very
discontented, they wondering where the Prince had been, he told them all he
had been to see the City, how and in what manner you have heard related.

FINIS.
