THE SNARE BROKEN: OR LIGHT discovering DARKNESS. Being an answer to a Book
entitled, FOOT yet in the SNARE; Published by JAMES NAYLOR.

Wherein his treachery and backsliding from the true Faith is brought to
Light, and his untrodden PATHS discovered.

With some of his divided Language and deceitful Lies in short laid open, and
his Spirit proved to be the same which appeared in all the false Prophets, who
say the Lord says, when he spoke not unto them; plainly to be seen by the
impartial eye, in all those whose eyes are in their head, least the Wolf
should devour the Lamb, under a shadow of love to the TRUTH.

By a lover of Truth and Peace, called, John Toldervy.

Isaiah 58.1.4. Show my people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob
their sins. Behold ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of
wickeknesse, ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be
heard on high. James 2.1. My Brethren, have not the Faith of our Lord Jesus
Christ the Lord of Glory, with respect of persons. In vain is the Snare laid in
the sight of any Bird.

The Snare broken: OR Light discovering Darkness.
GOOD is the Word of the Lord, who by his Spirit has foretold of the Heathen
raging, and the people fancying and imagining to themselves vain things,
thereby to subdue the true appearance and exaltation of the King of
Righteousness, in every age, of his coming into the world; who has also
foretold of such, whose coming should appear as the Angels of Light, (being
transformed in the outward shape or discovery of the Image of God) and in this
his appearance, as a special end for the effecting of his bewitched design, he
intrudes into the comprehension of words, even words that are sound and
perfect, words of Life and Power, which came forth from the Spirit, whose way
is truth, and whose end is life; but being ignorant of that Spirit from whence
they came, they change them into fables, and so are become blasphemers of that
Immortal Seed by which they were brought to light: As also for the maintaining
of their corrupt practice, (being not possessors of the perfect truth) they
desire to make a fair show in the flesh, and to that end they seek to give
place to some Self-humility, that they may be distinguished by men, that
therein they may glory, as though in the sufferings of Christ; but from that
spirit and light in which there is no deceit, but the perfection of truth, let
such learn reproof, and suffer rebuke, who boast of the Light to be their
Guide, and yet are found in the Pit of Wa^ps, watching to afflict the children
of my people, says the Lord, and are searching secretly for a stumbling stone
to cast for a Rock of Offense in the streets of the Holy Jerusalem, even for a
shelter for the accursed seed, not only in those who are brought into the way
which guides to Salvation, and that have received in their knowledge a measure
of the infallible truth, but also in such who have something of the simplicity
arising to life in them, by which they are guided in love to seek after the way
of truth, if that for Sions sake they might come to know where they might find
the sufferings of the Cross, for the restoration of the Righteous Seed, which
makes free the City of God.

But the Word of Scripture has foretold, that such Heresies and Schisms must
be in the Church, that the approved of the Lord might be made manifest; and now
it will plainly appear to those who are in any measure of the Light and Faith
of Christ, such a one has been found in that blasphemous work, the Answer of
that Book set forth by me, entitled, The Foot out of the Snare; for that from
the root of bitterness and envy, there is brought to light a bundle of unclean
venomous things, and filthy deceitful lies, confusion, and rashness, in evil
speaking against the truth, yet notwithstanding are they all sought to be
justified in the deepest subtilty of the Serpent, by going about to entrap the
simple mind, with much using those words which were spoken from the simplicity
in such a life, for such an end, that he which abides in a lie knows not.

Now unto such, who for a persuasion, have and do satisfy themselves in
things, which those that are by them judged to be before them in the faith,
does believe and declare for truth; unto such, I say, read and see your vanity,
for herein is the Deceiver greatly upheld, you being not eyewitnesses to what
you believe in your selves; and though the Leaders and you people are both
joined in one to speak against imitation, yet in your hearts are you both
confederate in this whoredom, and birth of fornication, in that the one
imagines and frames in his mind a certain belief that what is spoken from the
other must be true, rooted and grounded in him from a persuasion in himself,
that his Leader is in the enjoyment of the Covenants, in the Redemption and
purchased possession of the Blood of the Lamb, a spiritual man moved and guided
to speak in, by, and from the Spirit; and the other, which is the leader,
concludes in himself, that such a belief in a weak Brother, who is not yet come
to that measure of Spirit or Resurrection of Life with himself, is in the faith
and power of truth; but for this cause many are sick, and weak, and many sleep.

Who is there in whom there is any knowledge that will not condemn this Faith,
the Truth in this practice, of taking things upon trust, being sold for Usury:
The Spirit of God says, Follow us, as we follow Christ; but it does not say,
Follow us, because we believe, or do so; but herein, thou who art in this
practice, art witnessed to be in the corrupt nature, in self-worship, where all
the blind guides in the world are leading silly people, who know not the
perfect ways of truth, to say as they say, and do as they do, though the end
of such a worship is death.

And for thee James Naylor, thy madness and folly is made manifest in what
thou have done, and thy vain deceit discovered, yet not unto the Adulteress
eye, but unto that light which is of God, the witness of Truth against Deceit
in all consciences, and thy Troops of Lies, which are sheltered under thy great
swelling words of vanity, are here laid open before thee, and turned back again
to their own habitation, even into thy own bosom; and though thy envy had a
respect to what scandal and reproach thou could cast upon me, on purpose
that thou might make me to appear odious, yet do I not value thy deceit
therein, neither am I in the least dissatisfied as to my person, yet sorrow and
a lamentation there has been, because of what evil thou have brought upon thy
self, and that truth which thou professest, and also the effects which that
Spirit thou have appeared in might accomplish upon such, whom otherwise might
have learned wisdom from that plain simple mind which appeared in me, in what
I have discovered: Have I spoken in soberness, and dealt moderately, and have
I therein smitten the truth? How is it thou would have had me to a spoken?
Can Truth speak but its own? Had I appeared a Transgressor of the Law, like to
thy self, with a rebellious provoking spirit, then might thou have justly
reproved me; but now for this thy uncleanness (it being a work of thy self)
know this, that Judgment will rest upon thee, for that I gave thee diverse
Causions, yet have thou rebelled against knowledge; but now henceforwards learn
from this thy weakness, to cease from rashness, and not to run before that
light, of which thou declarest to be thy perfection, for thou art no more the
Minister of Circumcision, for the crucifying of the body, and the abolishing of
flesh, I say, no longer then thou abide in the Faith thy self; but thou art
become the Minister of Circumcision, for the service of the outward Law of
words.

But to examine and search thy work, the Foundation, and the end thereof.

Thou beginnest with a discourse to we Nine, calling us the Heathen raging, of
which the Spirit of the Lord foretold, and that we imagine vain things, and so
stop the appearance and exaltation of the King of Righteousness in this Age;
and that we are Gog and Magog, who battle against the Lamb, which Lamb thou
say is in thee, (though here thou will be found a liar, and instead of a
Lamb will appear a Wolf) Then thou call us Subtilty, Sorcerers, and
Witchcrafts, who are of the devil; and that we hate Innocence; and so thou
go on, calling us the Deceived, and the bewitched of the Devil, with lies.
and lying wonders, joining together head and tail, root and branch, in that
nature, to trample upon the appearance of Christ, and shut up the Kingdom
against men; and thou go on, calling me the Child of Perdition; and after
much more such kind of stuff which thou speak of me, thou call me a
Judas, and those who put their hands to my book, thou say they are the Chief
Priests; and so thou go on, calling us the Dragon and the Beast, with the
many Heads and Horns, with Blasphemy on every Head, and that my book is
blasphemy; and then thou say, it does now appear so to be, whereas thou have
not witnessed from truth one word of blasphemy in the whole book. All these,
and many more filthy, corrupt, and deceitful lies (in respect of that work
which is in hand) (as may be seen by the impartial eye, in all those whose eyes
are in their head, if observing the following discourse) being laid as a
Foundation for thy bewitched end, thou presentest them before three sorts of
persons, whom thou say are much concerned in what we Nine have hatched and
brought forth; (calling it a filthy thing) which blasphemous lie thou wast
forewarned of before, as I have said, not only in my book, but also justified
to thy face when we spoke together; and for instance, thou may well remember
the first work thou wast guided in, when after I was known to thee, was in much
subtilty to search what thou could get forth of me, as touching this, and
also concerning other matters which respected the Ministers, which being seen,
I refused thy spirit, for which thou had not a word to speak, but did rest
silent: May thou not blush for shame, for that thou should dare to appear
in slandering of so many persons after so gross a manner as thou have here
done, to the view of all the world? O thou Corruption! do thou boast of the
Law? Through breaking the Law dishonorest thou God, for the Name of God is now
blasphemed among the Heathen, through you; for as I have said, thy Circumcision
profits not, while as yet thou art found in the transgression; and here is
Core, who came forth of Egypt, and yet gainsaid, think thou it will serve
thy turn to say, thy thoughts were so, and now to say thou will do so no more;
nay, it will not, but thy reward shall abide shame and dishonor which thou have
brought upon thy self, and that truth which thou professest.

Thou go forwards in thy design, and for a better encouragement of thy end
toward those three sorts of persons, etc. and for a further discovery of thy
malice toward the Ministers, in thy haste thou have reproved them for
witnessing the truth, which thou deniest not; but thy deceit calls it the
Devils actings: true that relation which declares of those effects, which a
deluded spirit wrought in and upon me, under a pretense of light, that speaks
of the Devils actings, and for that cause were they discovered, because they
were the Devils actings, who is a Liar from the beginning, and abode not in the
truth, neither does he abide in the truth, and those works of the Devil were
discovered for that end, that the nature and the effects thereof might answer
to the good of others; yet dare thou say, that those who are in the least
measure of the light, sees this deed to be a secret smiting against the just;
but thou art denied, and that light by which thou speak, for that by which
they were brought to light, was Life.

Having thus made a preparation by thy lying spirit, in the using of those
words of Scripture which were spoken in knowledge, for a true end by those who
writ them, thinking thereby to darken the understanding, thou go forwards in
thy sixth Page, directing thy mind to us all, giving us to know from thy
besotted and self-will mind, that we all are joined to bear witness to
confusions and lying wonders, directing us that we turn to the light of Christ,
and take notice against whom we are joined therein, which light thou say
has appeared in thee, and may be seen by us in this thy work, of laying open
lies, confusions, and lying wonders, and then thou go on, bearing witness
against thy self, saying, that we never saw it, or heard it, and confirmest
what thou so speak with another lie, saying, that we also confessed what
thou speak to be true. Now if thy saying here were true, how is it that I
could have written it, or any of those Ministers appeared in it? but this I
shall bear with, judging it to be a mistake, and if thou had judged in
righteousness, and not according to a seeming appearance, as thou could not
otherwise be convinced in thy self, concerning those words spoken by the
Ministers, which are less in a mistake then these here of thine, then thou
could not have been found in this work, but with the light of which thou
speak thy corrupt judgment, and filthy nature, is here seen, their words
speak of a sad and remarkable providence, to which they give witness, which
words are the sum of all that their mind and meaning did signify, witness by
the light in thy own conscience, for thou know well they are strangers in
their judgment to all those things discovered by me, as yours, as also diverse
of those discovered, as mine; but were they not those words, A sad and
remarkable, may not have any respect to any particular contained in the book,
but that scope and matter which discovers those wiles and subtilties, which
from time to time I was ensnared in by the evil spirit, together with what
providence attended me, while under those temptations; but yet to me there is a
mistake, which I seek not to justify, which thy malice against knowledge has
taken hold on.

So thou go on in contradiction to thy former words, repeating some of those
words which the Ministers have put their hands unto, which speaks, that some of
them have persued a part of my writings, which thou deniest not, but believe;
and then thou go on, reproving them for their tenderness in so speaking,
and for bearing witness to what I had declared touching the nature of those
works which the evil spirit guided me in subjection unto; and yet, as I have
said, there is not one word in thy whole book, which bears witness against
what thou have reproved them for, but for the answering of thy end, thou say
I am one possessed with a deluded spirit; then if so, how is it that the light
and Spirit of Christ has here appeared, in laying open thy deceit, but thy
words and their end are seen; yet it is true, time was that I was possessed
with a deluded spirit, even exeedingly possessed, but now great is my peace,
yea great is my peace, the Lord having wrought for his Name sake a deliverance
for his chosen, and has made known his Election, praises to his Name for ever.

Thou say further, that we are found falsifying our own words, and so have
ensnared our selves in our own wickedness, and this we call, The Foot out of
the Snare. Thus directing thy mind to us all, whereas not one of them had the
least knowledge of the Title, or any particular contained in the Epistle, until
it came forth to the sight of the world, and so thou say our work is begun
with a lie, and so carried on, who in our title page (speaking in a lie, thy
mind being to us all) tell of the manner of my separation from the Quakers,
which as thou say is false, (speaking in these words) that those we call
Quakers did separate from me, and denied me both in word and writing, because
of my following a bewitched spirit, and would not be reclaimed by you, who
often reproved and judged me for it with one consent; and then for a witness
to what thou have spoken, thou go to the latter part of my book to borrow a
proof from my words to bear thee up, but think not to justify thy self with
lies, which thou can not witness; for from that time of my first compliance
with you, until about a week before that time which the evil spirit guided me
in that bewitched service of imitating the crucifying of Christ, I say, from
that time until this time, of which I speak, there was not one word of reproof
given unto me by any one of them, but great tenderness and love they bear
toward me, by which may clearly be seen, that there was great hopes in them
concerning me, yea, and there was great hopes of me, for that they observed my
zeal and faithfulness in that work I was called unto, for which I received
from them great encouragement, but whether or no the nature of the greatest
part of those temptations, which are related in my book, with many more, was
known unto them, I cannot say; and whereas thou say, that any of you did
separate from me, or deny me in word or writing, because I would not be
reclaimed by them, it is true they did deny me, and so I have said in my book,
that they did deny me, and that because I would not be reclaimed by them; but
as thy own words speak in contradiction to what thou say, before I did deny
them first, yet not with a bewitched spirit, and what I then did deny, I deny
still: which deed in me is true, and abides, yea, and will abide, when thy
vanity (if I may so call it) in those things which thou respectest, as worship
to God, wherein is emptiness and nothingnesse, when I say this thy vanity shall
cease, and this do I speak in a good conscience, except thy knowledge is yet
before mine, in respect of those things of which thou may understand that I
now speak of.

So thou go on with a lie (in respect of the Ministers) saying, that we told
of what judgment I was learned in by the Ministry of those people, (meaning
your selves) and so we bear witness we know not to what; for that thou say,
that both they (speaking of the Minister) and I, am yet unlearned in the
judgment and Ministry of those we call Quakers, and yet in thy fifteenth page,
after thou have repeated much of what I have spoken, thou confessest that they
were precious truths, and also that I have discovered in my book of many more
precious truths, which nearly concerns the salvation of every soul; and in
thy 22. and 37. page, thou deniest not, but that I was restored again by the
true light, from that sad and lost condition which I was in, and that
afterward I was guided in that obedience which was professed by the Quakers:
but this it may be thou wast persuaded to make use of 'for that it concerned
thee for the answering of thy end, in respect of what thou speak in thy
following discourse; yet here thy end is seen, thou art made manifest, thy
blindness and thy confusion is brought to light, Dare thou say that light
guided thee in this thy work? silence for shame, silence thy self, until thou
can speak in plainness with a true mind, and a right understanding.

Thou go on with thy lie saying, that in our Epistle, we say the subject
matter of our discourse relates principally to the persons, who go under the
Name of Quakers, whereas (as I have before spoken) not one of them had any
knowledge of any one particular contained therein, until it came forth to the
sight of the world.

Then thou go forward, repeating many words, saying, We confess that many
have abused the truth, by seeking to defend themselves in that deceit, which
that Spirit which is of God in those we call Quakers, have witnessed against; I
say that word, we call as to me, is a reproach.

So you go forwards with my words, which speaks, that the generali^p of men are
already beyond measure bitterly incensed against you, for which tenderness and
simplicity of mind, which respects an advantage to you, thou reply with a
reproof, saying. Let our practice judge us as to the thing in hand, confirming
thy reproof with a lie, (so far as it is known to me) saying, That we seek to
defend our selves in that deceit, which the Spirit of God in you have witnessed
against, and so has made thy self manifest, to be one of those who have
abused the truth, of which thou say, It is thy Guide. And whereas thou go
on, saying, That the devil had never such a design on foot, for the incensing
of people against you, as my book; I say thou art found herein witnessed to be
the Liar, from thy own words, in that thou do acknowledge in thy 23. and 27.
pages, and in other places of thy paper, that I have oftentimes in my book
cleared you from prejudice. Again, thou reprovest us, that we are not ashamed
in that we say the subject matter does relate principally to you, which thou
say was acted amongst us, who are joined on in it against that Spirit of God
in the Quakers, by which it was denied in the persons of them, both root and
branch thereof, as thou say is confessed and witnessed by us: To which I
say, for the Ministers, they are not concerned therein, and for what I have so
spoken, I am not ashamed, for it does and may concern them, and also others
besides them, for has God made known his judgments, and showed his power upon
me, for that I departed from the truth, and gave heed unto lying vanities, by
which sorrow and misery did befall me, and the seed of the righteous became
desolate: and did this evil befall me while I was amongst you? and have I now
plainly, as from the Lord, discovered the nature thereof, he having showed unto
me the cause and the end thereof? and have I now showed unto you and to the
world the true cause and the end, that so such who are of you unsettled in their
minds, or unfaithful in their work toward the Lord, might thereby learn to
fear, and to be kept stayed in the love and faith which is professed? which
end thou make of what I have writ unto them thy self; nay, did thou ever
see any thing that might serve more for causion, or reproof, to such who are of
your selves, then this, are you here accused? then understand, wherein and
wherein you are accused: I say, see if you may not therein learn reproof, but
you are not only accused, but you are excused, where it is yours, and where
truth abides, there it is seen; and also thy deceit has confessed the same, as
from what I have spoken in many places of my book, though other things in the
same deceit thou have changed into lies, (but that is for thy design) So (in
thine own words) I say, let all now judge who have the spirit of truth, if thou
art not one of those misguided spirits, who stand up in defense of deceit
against the Spirit of Truth, that thereby thou might cast a stumbling block
in the plain way of the Lord, that so his people might be stayed in the midst
thereof; and let your work judge you who have taken part with your deceit acted
between your selves, in despite to the Spirit of God.

Thou go further, saying, that Judas and the Chief Priests might as truly
charge what they did in combination together against Christ, upon the eleven
Disciples, as we charge our act and combination upon the persons of you, or the
Spirit of God in you; unto which, I say, a lie speaks, for our act and
combination it was not, neither have I charged what is spoken, upon you, or the
spirit of God in you, but where any thing that I have writ does gainsay the
evil spirit that is in any of you, that is yours, and good is it that you have
seen a visitation thereby.

Again, thou say, that in our Epistle we tell of expressing tenderness
toward our Brethren, yea, and I do so say, tenderness toward my Brethren,
who are misguided in their spirits, subjected under Laws and Traditions, etc.
which stands in the invention, by which they are covered in deceit, and through
their weakness they are led forth, denying themselves what is just and lawful
in the sight of God; and this they do through fear, in flaverie to the Prince
of deceit.

Thou go on, directing thy false mind in a confused manner to us all,
whereas thy scope, by what I can understand, reflects upon the Ministers; and
then in thy 9. page, thou say, as for the denying our selves liberty, lawful
or unlawful, we are little guilty of that crime; say thou so, then thy
accusation is ceased; for if we deny not lawful liberty, then are we in the
Redemption, in which Faith our work shall abide; (but I plead not to justify
the flesh) yet for my own part, am I free, or not free, it is far short of thy
knowledge. But here thou manifestest thy confusion and contradictions, for if
any part of what the Law requires be overcome by that which is without Law,
then is the requirings of Law denied, or if any part of what is without Law be
subdued by the requiring of the Law, then is it, that what is without Law is
denied; but if thou say in thy folly, that we deny not the requiring of
the Law, as thy words must speak, otherwise they must speak perfectly on the
contrary, then I say thy whole book was spoke in and from a lie, and there is
nothing more but confusions, so thou go forwards in thy own by-way; and then
thou speak of changeable fashions, and foolish childish toys in our habits,
which thou say we are pleading for, whereas there is no such matter in any
one word contained in my whole book.

In thy 10. page, thou demandest what liberty you are charged to deny, I say,
that liberty denied by you, of which I spoke, may plainly be seen by what I
have already spoken in my former: You tell again of what I spoke, in that I
would give an account of my separation from you, which thou deniest, but that
lie thou here spokest on is already returned whence it came; for I first did
separate from you, as I have said, the manner of which is discovered in my
former book.

Thou go forwards doting in thy lie, speaking to the Ministers, saying, that
in their causion to the Reader, they confess, that my errors, from what was
written in the Scripture, and in my self, was that by which I deeply suffered,
and say thou, that before we have cast it on the persons of the Quakers,
whereas (as before is witnessed) there is no such thing; but here thou art
found with that deceit in thy own mouth, which thou castest upon us.

In thy 14. page thou repeatest my words, which speaks, that I have been for
diverse years full of zeal after the things of God, seeking after the knowledge
of Christ; and then (for the answering of thy end) thou skippest over diverse
lines, leaving the scope and true meaning of what is related, contained in
those words, I was persuaded; and so thou bring my words spoken in another
place, with purpose to show a contradiction in me. When thus thou have
confounded thy self, in leaving out those words which speaks the truth of my
mind: Then in the close of the same page, for thy purpose, thou repeatest these
words, Ways most useful, but leaves out the word persuaded. And having thus
done, thou requirest of us to tell thee, if all that cousider of it may not see
us start blind and drunk with abomination and confusion: To which I answer, no,
they may not; for having, here considered and tried thy spirit, they may see
plainly, that the blind and drank with abomination and confusion is thy
self: Then thou make thy Application upon this thy own confusion unto us,
saying, Can ways most useful (leaving out the word persuaded) for clearing my
Conscience, in order to my upright and close walking with God, etc. and resting
in much fleshly wisdom and glorying, in being covered with deceit, stand
together in one person: To which I answer the perverter of truth no, neither
have I said any such thing as thou here charge us with; for if thou believe
my saying, that I was covered over with deceit, and rested in much fleshly
wisdom, then thou may clearlie see, that it is thy work, and not ours,
which cannot stand together. For was not Paul led forth very strict in zeal,
and as touching the Law blameless, and was he not persuaded that therein he
was the servant of God, for the clearing of his conscience, but yet
notwithstanding this, when he came truly to see his condition, he saw his
strictness of zeal, his service of the Law, and his persuasion therein; to be
all fleshly and carnal, which kind of worship we have too much amongst us; and
these things are not unknown to thee, yet thou gainsayest this testimony, and
thou reprovest the Ministers for their tenderness; in saying some of them read
it all over.

In thy 12. page, thou repeatest apart of my words in thy own way, and leavest
out others, as thou did before, speaking of a spirit which I said was
infused in me, by the opperation whereof, together with what I apprehended of
my self; after a short time there was made clear to my understanding what
follows. Having thus in thy confused way spoken thy mind and meaning contrary
to mine, thou go forwards, saying; That we confess this spirit from which I
had those apprehensions, was infused into me before I knew the Quakers: After
which, (say thou) I became affected with those people called Seekers, and
afterward met with two of those called Quakers, and yet the drift of thy book
is to make people believe that I received this spirit amongst the Quakers; and
so thou say we have cleared you, (speaking in a lie) of that we intended for
slander; but to prove thy work, my words thou may see speak thus, with
respect to you, where I say, by whose doctrine (together with what I
apprehended of my self) by the opperation of a spirit infused into me after a
short time, etc. And then I say, that first I shall declare the manner of my
entrance into this Belief, which manner of entrance may be seen plainly (as
is expressed by that word first) to be the door, through and by which I was
guided to that belief before spoken; so that the infused spirit, of which I
spoke, was not before, but after I knew the Quakers, which snare I was caught
in by their words, through consulting with my self; so that here thou shall
see, that this piece of confusion thou have cast upon us is thy own.

Again, thou go on with thy former deceit, speaking part of my words, and
laying aside others to serve thy end, saying, That I tell of the Quakers that
which they spoke was against all sin, yet they discovered nothing of the
Mystery of the Gospel of Christ, which is false, for what is true speak not
so, but as it is related it was my wisdom, which word Wisdom thou have here
left out, and in diverse other places of thy book, for others of thy false ends,
thou have owned the word, and made use thereof; and for that I said they spoke
against all sin, it is true they did so speak, but their words were few spoken
after this manner, lie not, deceive not, let your words be yea and nay, deal
truly with God and man, and such like expressions, that are one and the same
with the Scripture thou speak on, which says, Sin no more, lest a worse
thing come upon thee; which manner of speaking, as I have said, I concluded in
my wisdom to come short of the Mystery of Christ; so that here we, which thou
chargest with a lie, stand free, and those words which I spoke withal witness
that the Lie is thine own; can thou look upon thy unclean work of deceit
which thou have formed against us, and not learn reproof? What boldness can
thou have to appear hereen? Is this from the Lord? Or is it not from thy own
wilful corruption, when thou shall take part of my words; to carry on the
design of a lie in enmity against us, and leave the other part, by which we are
justified in the truth, and thou condemned in the work of thy lie, yea, surely
it is so, and so own it as the work of thy corruption.

In thy 13. page (speaking to the Ministers) thou say, they tell of one
whom I knevv to be a very serious true-hearted man which was converted to
your belief, which gave me to understand, that the person, that Son of God
which dyed at Jerusalem, was not the Redeemer of man from sin.

All which in thy meaning I deny; for (as before is witnessed) they said not
so, but I said so, and if thou will so have it, they witnessed me in so
speaking, and not I them; and for that, I say, he gave me to understand, that
the person, that Son of God that dyed at Jerusalem, was not the Redeemer of man
from sin; it is true in the words themselves, but not (as I say) in thy
meaning, which thing also in the close of this Page, thou have both confessed
and denied thy self, saying, That all which ever knew you will bear you witness,
that you own no Redeemer but that Son of God which died at Jerusalem, whom, say
you, we witness in us, the Light by which you see sin, and by obedience thereto
are led out of sin.

If thy words here, speaking of the Son of God, respects the spirit of that
person which died at Jerusalem (as I judge it does) then may thy saying be
understood in those words, We witness him a light in us, etc. for in him
dwells fullness of the Godhead, by which fullness of his have all those who
have lived in his Light received grace for grace: Now if this be thy meaning,
then have I witness from thy self, for what is discovered touching the person
of that Son of God which died at Jerusalem; but if thy meaning must be taken as
thou have said, then thy words are not, for that what they speak cannot be; but
now witnessed by thy self we are not slanderers, nor backbiters, neither does
that person deserve admonition which spoke the words; yet if thou would know
his name from me, though I judge thou art not ignorant who it was, it was Simon
Dring, who meeting with me in the street, at the head of Bartlemy-Lane behind
the Exchange, had some conference with me, the effects whereof (as could
remember) I have declared.

In thy 14. page thou say I seem to reproach you, in that I say some of you
fasted 30. or 40. days; I say, the words themselves speak no such thing,
neither is it my mind, but-as such a work was this discovered for a sign,
according as thy self has applied.

Thou go further in this page, telling of those two spirits which was in me,
one contrary to the other, by which I did many things in my will against my
will, and then thou skippest to the end of my book, where I say, before I was
persuaded to comply with you, I had a right Knowledge of your belief and
practice, and then say thou here is another piece of my confusion
manifested, and for a proof thereof, thou go to the end of that relation,
which declares of what delusions I was in, where I have said that I was judged
by you; and when thou have thus blinded the truth, by this thy own work of
despite, and so the confusion thy own; thou call us falfe Witnesses which
cannot agree together in our Work, but who is there that may not see thy vain
mind and the false Witness of which thou speak, which cannot agree in one to
be in thy self; cease for shame, cease from disturbing the truth, and
perverting the right mind of the Lord; have I in simplicity declared the way
by which I came to be lost and so ensnared by the deceiver, that his Way and
Works being laid open, it might answer to the benefit of others; and yet go
thou about to make use thereof for by-ends, and to cast a stumbling block
before what good might otherwise be learned thereby; look upon thy work, and
behold thy end; I say, as I have declared before, I had a right knowledge of
your belief and practice, but when coming to be guided by what I had learned in
my understanding, that fiery zeal of which I spoke, being in my will, brought
in darkness upon my spirit, by which darkness I was overcome to do many things
in my will against my will, and for reproof from any of you I received none;
until that time I have before mentioned; and here as to what thou have spoken,
thou art left without excuse, being witnessed against by the Light of Christ;
which thou say we have accused, and the unsavory stuff it is thy own, which
thy slandering spirit have cast forth of the bottomeless pit.

In thy 15. page thou say, I tell of my believing, that what was manifested
of God in man, was the Light of life, and one with himself, and that man was
the cause of all his distractions and confusions in himself, and that man
having lost the Kernall and Substance, he feeds on dry husks, and being not
refreshed with Bread and Water of Life, he remains always seeking and never
satisfied, and that eternal life living in us, there needs no more thirsts;
etc. And having thus done, thou confessest they, and many more which thou have
not mentioned, are precious truths, and say thou, these being things which
the devil most envy, we (speaking in a lie) have mixed with them some of our
own deceits, thereby the better to make people believe they are errors; to
which I say, why did not thou declare those errors, that so I might have seen
my weakness, and the people have learned Knowledge; but here thou exclaimest
against the truth, and stayest at home to cover thy deceit; but this is to
carry on thy design amongst those who say as thou say, discovered in those
words, We strike at the whole foundation at once, after which subtle design,
thou repeatest a part of my Words, which speaks another thing, and relates to
another end, then what is before discovered contained in those Words, I shall
declare some of those effects which this change wrought in me, and having so
done, thou skippest to the end of my Relation, confounding thy self in not
observing the scope and order of my Words, and there repeatest the crucifying
of my self, and burning my leg, and pricking needles in my thumbs, and such
like, which thy subtilty calls bewitched stuff, though it is true it was (as I
have so called it) bewitched stuff, had not thou dealt fairlie and truly
with thy self, and with me also, in taking the scope and order of my writing,
as things were discovered, have I not said those temptations overpowred me at
my first entrance, occasioned by the fire of my zeal, and that afterward, when
I came to see my folly, I was restored to a right understanding of what was
true, which thing thou have acknowledged in diverse places of thy book, in
owning my words, which speaks, that I was guided in that obedience which was
professed by you; if then I make a difference between that obedience you
professed, and that practice I was guided in, while under those temptations,
which I have done in many places, then I say where art thou in this thy work?
if not drunk with new Wine, and smothered in the dark Clouds of the misty day,
behold confusion upon confusion, is Babylon overcome, is Babylon ceased, when
so many languages, voices, and sounds breaks forth, and discover themselves in
a confederacy against the simplicity of truth, yet will not my people see
these things, says the Lord; but though they will not see, yet will I go up to
the Mountain of my holiness, and there will I plead for my Name sake, that if
may be the restorer might comfort Zion, and Israel my glory might see their
deliverer.

Thou go on with my words, which speaks, that I was guided not to pluck off
my hat to any man, to speak the words Thee and Thou, not to bow to any man, not
to direct my mind in drinking to any, to pull off my points at the knees, and
my buttons which were unnecessary; and such like things which thou say we
would loath, see go down, and therefore give it, as though it was the spirit of
the devil, which bear witness against them, and so we would condemn the spirit
of God, and practice of the Saints, to which I say thou art denied in what is
spoken; for that cause and end for which those things were discovered, was to
show the rashness and forwardness of my zeal, by which I was guided in all
those things without the spirit of God; and though the spirit of God should
witness the denial of all those things in another, (which I can yet scarce
believe) yet, I say, in that my hasty work of denying them, it was not of God
but of the devil, and let such who are found in the practice of them, see if
the same spirit be not the ground of their practice; yet do I not judge, for
judgment is committed to the Son, whose light is in you all, but for pride and
excess I rest silent, directing that moderation might be our guide, and for a
moderation in all those things, I find not the spirit of God any where witness
against: But thou say I am a Judas, for that I have betrayed thy Light, and
so I cannot see, being over-shadowed with darkness: Well, is it so? am I a
Judas? then it is unto thee; for that what I have betrayed is thy Light; if
then this thy Light be darkness, my work is true; yet however thy Light, as
touching what we have before spoken, is darkness to mine, and for that I have
done, and do, my conscience bears me witness in the sight of God, which
otherwise were I a Judas a burden would rest upon me; but know this, I have
seen the end of things, and have learned to cease from man; and if for these
things thou smitest at us, because I call my work, The Foot out of the Snare;
or, a restoration of the Inhabitants of Zion into their place; then is it that
truth is ceased, for it is not, that Zion the City of the Lord was lain wast,
and the inhabitants thereof dispersed to the ends of the earth, was not the
Mountain of the house of the Lord laid low, and the inhabitable parts of
Jerusalem made desolate; yea surely, and a great cry and lamentation there
was for the desolation of her people; but now the everlasting Father of love in
time has made known his power, by which deliverance has been wrought for his
Name sake, praises, praises to his name for ever: And as touching those things
before spoken, I have given in my witness already, they are no snare unto me,
yet do I not boast in them, for that I know much temptation attends upon them,
therefore I direct to all, as I have done before, wait for a moderation, for
the righteous Judge is in his work, and by your deeds you must be proved, and
not by words, and your reward shall be accordingly.

Thou go forwards, speaking of the restoration of that, whereof I say was
immutable, and when thou have so done, thou say we condemn that spirit and
way which caused the restitution; and so thou go on, passing judgment upon
us, for what thou have conceived with thy own feigned imaginations, turn over
and read once more what I have spoken, and see if truth does not speak plainly
its own meaning, and for that thou say, here are the two spirits we tell on
which were contrary to the other; it is true, here they are the effects of the
one, and the effects of the other, but as touching that spirit which guided me
in the denial of the spirit of meekness, and so in the exalted spirit,
following my damned imaginations (if thou can see what plain words speak) I
have not cast them upon you, but the way by which I became possessed, I have
declared, the end of which is a warning to others, (to speak in the spirit of
truth, deny me if thou can) and whereas thou say, this thing being so,
(speaking of my delusion) I was by you denied; I say, as to my person thy words
are not, (witnessed by what is before spoken) but as touching the deluded
spirit, read my words in the close of my relation, and thereby rest silent, for
truth has spoken, by which truth is set free.

In thy 19. page thou repeatest my words, where I say, that a short time after
my compliance with that spirit which entered into me by the observation of your
practice; and then thou go back to my second page, and there in thy deceit
thou borrowest a composed lie of thy own to witness against this truth before
spoken, but this lie is before laid open; and for that I said the entrance of
this unclean spirit was by the observation of your practice, which practice you
declare to be from the spirit; it is true, I say the entrance was so, for the
first entrance and work of deceit in me, after I came amongst you, was my
taking up of diverse your practices in the imitation, the manner of which deceit
I have (in its place) laid open; but as touching those things thou have
related, as the effects of this my saying, I deny, neither have thou any
ground or reason for what thou have declared, but herein thou show thy busy
mind, as one loving to pick quarrels, and watching to lay a snare before the
truth, but now receive thy words as thy own; O thou shameless man! behold,
amongst men, who would have judged like unto thee?

But to prove thy work of seeking to bring me into a confusion, after thou have
discovered thy vain mind in thy own by-waie, thou come in thy 21. page to
relate my words, which speaks of my hasty forward mind, and my own resolved
Covenant, by which in the fire of my zeal I was hastily carried forth before
the true Light, etc. which things are true, and thy own confusion being laid
open, thou may read them so to be, for this hasty forward mind, and this
resolved Covenant in this fire of zeal, was that by which I was overcome, and
so took up things in the imitation, by which was received in that deluded
spirit of which I have spoken, and so by degrees carried on, as I have said,
for a warning to others, that they also come not in the same excess, and yet
how is it thou can appear in such a witness, as to declare that what I have
done is the work of the devil?

Thou go on forwards with thy slanderous tongue in this thy false design,
and then in the close of this page thou say, I confess that when I came to
the place where the Quakers were, showing the holes I made in my thumbs, and
telling of those Lying-Wonders which I had been acting, many of the Quakers
being there, all of them judged me with one consent, etc. and then say thou
in my 51. page I confess I was restored to a right understanding, and my life
became a clear light, being guided in that obedience which was professed by
those people: And then say thou all this being my own confession, yet I
charge it upon a spirit which entered in me by the observation of your practice,
and so thou go on with thy refuge of lies, and then ask if ever such a heap
of confusion and falsehood was uttered and signed for truth, etc. but those
things being cleared already, I shall let them pass, only thou speak here
of lying-wonders, which either discovers thy meaning, that what I have related
are lies, otherwise they are the works of a lie wrought and witnessed in me, by
that deluded Spirit which led me forth in obedience to them; now if thy meaning
be thus, then is thy witness true, but if thon meanest that my words are lies,
then why is it that thou did not witness any one of them so to be, that so I
might have seen my errors, but herein is thy subtlety seen.

Thou go further, uttering much words to us for what thou have feigned in
thy own imagination, and then in thy 23. page thou ask, Is there any in this
City, but they are ashamed to have a hand in such a filthy thing? speaking of
what thy imagination has conceived, which thou have cast upon us, to which I
answer, nay surely I judge there is not any but thy self, and so receive these
thy own words; consider thy work in this thy confused thing, wherein thou have
been forced so often to clear us, both with thy own words, and also with mine,
of those things thou have so often accused us of, and to the world declare thy
self, whereof all the world cannot prove us guilty of these deceits, and open
manifest inventions wrought by thee, further then to testify against thee, and
that spirit in thee and them, by which thou wast helped in this thy works of
lies and slanders, which are one, for the sorcerer, the murderer, and the
liar, is one spirit, so thou who have cast these things upon us, which thy
self does testify we denied, and for that cause judgment was given, and a
witness for truth has appeared to the world, let all men see by what spirit
thou was led, Was there ever such a thing done amongst the people of God?
had thou lived in the Apostles time, would not thou have slandered the
truth, and the persons of the Saints, with the act of Simon Magus (though it
was much better then this of thee, who fell the truth for a lie?) would not
thou have charged the act of the incessious person upon the Apostles, and that
of Annanias and Sephira, upon that spirit which appeared in them, and that of
Judas upon Christ and his Disciples, which is the like case, (all these being
thy own acts, thou have appeared in their spirit, and then thou castest thy
Work upon us) and now had this been just dealeing to accuse the innocent, or
have you done here as you would be done unto, nay would thou have the false
witnesses in this thy paper, cast upon the innocent the abominations that is of
thy self cast upon us, this being the true case between thee and us, whose
persons thou have slandered, take it into consideration, and let the light of
Christ of which thou speak be Judge in you, whether you have kept the Royal
Law, Do as you would be done unto, let him be witness between us and you, whose
spirit you have blasphemed this day, also let all the Judges of this Nation
give their testimony, and all that understand Law between man and man, if such
a witness deserve not punishment suitable to his Slander, who would dare to be
a witness against others in things he never saw nor heard, though I am far from
desiring that any such thing should befall thee, but that thou may come to
see thy unjust dealing after the manner of men, in that thou dare to act and
witness such contradictions and confusions, as is in this thy book, and become
a certain witness to that thou never saw nor heard, and so speak thou know
not what, and yet notwithstanding thou have thus discovered the vain deceit of
thy own mind, that thou should for a cover thereof (to darken the
understandings of the simple) dare to appear with such an appeal unto such
persons of sound judgment, and clear understanding, in respect of those things
whereof thou speak as they are: O man! where art thou, if not beside thy
self? Is thy understanding laid aside? or art thou predominate in thy
affections, that thou might boast in vanity? was there ever such a thing
done by any that feared God? a moderate Heathen would have blushed thereat: But
now how art thou fallen? and how has envy besotted thee in this thy work?
These things, and much more, of which I am ashamed to speak, have thou prepared
a work for, and they for thy work: Did not Haman insult against Mordicai, and
so brought the evil upon himself which was designed for Mordicai? and is it not
so between thee and us? have thou not laid a snare before the truth to entrap
us, and then prepared a scourge? but now thou have brought that evil upon thy
self, which thou intendest for us, and here is thy deceit made manifest.

Having thus discovered thy uncleanness and work of a lie, thou go on in thy
23. page with my words, where I say, that I had a clear understanding of what
your Ministry held forth, and a right knowledge of your belief and practice
before I complied with you, and then say thou, here I add another lie to
cover the former, and so I go about to clear you again; to which I answer, as I
have cleared already, what I have spoken is true, and thy deceit being laid
open, thou may read them so to be; have I all along in my book discovered
the truth of things, that those scandals which have passed abroad might be seen
and witnessed against? Nay, could thou have done more thy self, had the case
been thy own? and yet for all this go thou about to reproach and revile me
for that I have thus done, and that by turning truth into lies, and so make a
scorn and derision of the work of the spirit? and yet do thou justify thy
deed as though thou wast thus guided by the spirit, let all those of whom thou
call to witness between thee and me, whose eyes are in their heads, bear
witness in truth without partiality between us, and then shall they not see
thy folly? yea, also read thy self, and thy own condemnation, that so thou
may, for the time to come, learn more wisdom, and not dare to appear in such
a fair show, as though in love to truth, whenas thou make thy self manifest
to be a devourer of the truth.

In thy 26. page thou confessest thy self, that I tell the occasion how I came
to be lost in my understanding, and so distracted and confused in mind, and
then thou go on repeating my words, which discovers the occasion to be
another thing then your persons, and yet the whole scope of thy book is
intended to make people believe that I cast it upon your persons; and again
thou acknowledgest that what I have here discovered, is for the clearing of
truth, and yet in thy confusion thou call this subtlety, but if so, then
thou art subtlety, for that thou deniest not by these thy words, but that it
is for the clearing of truth; was not deceit uppermost when thou appearest in
this work, and thy understanding covered with darkness? yea surely, and so it
was; and here that judgment, of which thou speak, is witnessed out of thy
own mouth to be thy own; for if it was the true spiritual Light which let me
to see my darkness, as I have said it was, and that it would have guided me out
of the works of the flesh, self-thoughts and imaginations; and if the cause why
I turned from that Light was my natural forward mind and resolutions (as it
was) and so lead forth in obedience to a covenant of my own before the true
light, by which the Light of the Sun was darkened, and a shape formed in the
likeness of the true light, whereby deceit got power to do those filthy
things; and if I was restored again by the true Light (as I was) and so guided
in the obedience which is professed by you; if these things are true (as they
are) then let all, unto whom thou appealest, wherein there is the least measure
of honesty, judge righteouslie between us, and see if that the blasphemy, lies
and slanders, and abominable confusions, which thou cast upon us, be not in
truth thy own, who all along in thy book has gone about to defile and slander
the true Light of the spirit of God, under a pretense of clearing the truth;
but receive thy own words as they are thine; can thou behold thy confusion
and not be ashamed? Do thou scoff at me for calling my work the Foot out of
the Snare, and declare against it, calling it the Foot in the Snare? Art not
thou ashamed at thy envy against the innocent? Is this that innocence of
which thou boastest on? have thou not cast a stone at us? but is it not fallen
back upon thy self? Is this thy Foot in the Snare? then consider thy work, and
see thy end, for for that thou have ensnared thy self, and so receive thy own,
can thou say and unsay, accuse and excuse and all in one thing, and yet
witness all for truth? who would have fed upon mischief like thee? do thou
believe that all are so blind, as some who are led by you, to believe all for
truth that thou speak without examination? Or do thou think that wisdom
and light is wholly excluded (as thou say) and true judgment wholly
respected, then might thou think with thy words, that thy lies and deceits
might have passed without reproof, and thou cover thy self therewith as with a
garment, but the Lord is risen, and rising, and the light is come, and the day
springing from on high, is visiting his people, and all works of darkness must
come to judgment; and for those despised people of whom thou speak, who
have none to take their part in the earth, I refuse to appear in enmity
against them, but for that I see you Builders have led them forth into bondage,
and have spoiled what is their liberty; have I spoken; my word shall stand
in truth? But for Herod and Pilate I deny, and all who are in their worship,
and that I own which is one in Spirit and Power, which is no lie; but that
Lamb of God and his light whereof thou speak, in whom there is no sin, and
for the liar it is thy self, witness the light in thy own conscience, and
diverse thy own words, which from that light thou wast constrained to speak in
the justifying of that truth which appeared in me, and with that light art thou
comprehended, by which thy ground and thy end is seen, with the depth of thy
own deceit, and though we are strangers in spirit, and enmity is gotten in
between us, yet that arm of the Lord is seen (whereof thou speak) gathering
his sheep which have been scattered upon the mountains this cloudie dark day,
who restores the lame, strengthens the feeble, and carries the lambs in his
bosom, because they are his own, glory be to his Name for ever, and as for
worship, adding to, or altering from what was in his Saints, by the same light
in my measure which was in them I deny; and also for those Vinedressers, who
stand up in defense of themselves against the heir, who is coming to call for
fruit, whose Vineyard brings forth pride, vainglory, and respect of persons,
love of the world, and conformity thereto, creature worships, and one which is
not of God, I say as for all such I deny, and their worship, neither have I
pleaded in the least for them, but for those and their fruits which are out of
time, out of the spirit of this world, and as for greatness of rage in me
against such whose lives are thus hid with Christ in God, it has not appeared
in me, neither dare I to appear in such a work, for that I know there is a
seed, whose Name is perfection, whichis risen and rising to utter his voice, to
the ends of the earth, that he might establish his own Name for a light to his
people Israel: This do I see and know, and for that cause do I rest silent; and
these are those of whom it is true, they have lost their Kindred, the pleasure
of the earth, and the delights therein is brought to their end, they have seen
a cessation of time, and they are laid much lower then the lowest of men; and
for this cause are they worthy, who follow the Lamb wheresoever he goes, and
in his life they shall live, yet such there are of whom thou art not known,
though not altogether, but for the Potters of the earth they shall be dashed in
pieces, therefore, Oh ye Sons of men! Why will ye not turn to the Rock from
whence ye were hewn, and to that pit out of which ye were dug, that ye might
draw from thence the fresh Springs of that Fountain, which gives to his people
eternal life. I am a Fountain set open for sin and for uncleanness, come unto
me all ye who are weary and heavy laden that ye might be watered with the dew
of heaven, and ye shall find rest for your souls, my yoke is easy and my
burden is light, but for such who are gathering together in a confederacy
against my Name, when my wrath is waxed hot, I will arise in my fury, and
recompense you according to your work.

Thou beginnest in thy 31. page with a word to me, discovering what I said to
diverse friends, that I did put forth what I have done to clear the truth
professed by you, from many scandals cast upon it, through my means, and then
savest thou, that truth by you professed is a witness against me for ever, that
I have not sought to clear it, but I have sought my own, and also that I have
caused the truth to be blasphemed above all that ever was before me in this
Generation since the time of his appearance, who is the Light of the world; and
for that end I have gone to consult with the greatest enemies to that truth
professed by you that are in the Nation. Now as touching all what thou have
here spoken, I utterlie deny; for did I so speak to friends my words are true,
for that I have spoken in much plainness to that end, witnessed and proved by
all what I have before spoken. And whereas thou say, that truth professed by
you witnesses against me that I have not so done; I say, by that truth of which
thou speak, I deny thy words, and that from whence thy words came; and this
is a Standard from the Lord in defense against thee, and the depth of thy
backsliding work also; and now shall the people mourn because of thee, who
has so much appeared in defense of the truth, and yet art found thy self
smothered in such filth, as thou have here appeared in; a man of unclean lips
and defiled tongue, shall not all, in whom there is the least measure of truth,
bear witness against thee? Yea surely they shall so if they appear for truth
(as I have said) without partiality: And now is it, that it is thy self, who
has sought thy own, and not the good of that whereof thou speak, but has
brought a ten-fold greater reproach upon that truth professed by thy self, then
can be witnessed I have, and for that thou say I consulted with the greatest
enemies of truth in the Nation, I deny thee thou body of deceit, how is it
(as I have said) thou dare to speak what thou neither saw nor heard, yet not
so alone, but also foretold, and (as I have said) witnessed to thy face, when
privilie thou wentest about to enquire of one, if the Anabaptist, or any other,
had not a confederacy with me in what I have done: Is this the work of
simplicity? Nay surely it is not, I say I did not consult with any, neither
was there any addition or exchange of one word but what is my own, all which I
yet own, and am fully satisfied in being witnessed therein by truth, only for
that I was persuaded to engage those Ministers, and so have brought them under
the reach of thy Snare, when in truth, as to them, were it not for that
mistake, they stood free in what they have there done, and also for that I was
overcome in such a great mistake, and carried aside by vanity in that deed of
engaging them: I say, only for these things I have much been disquieted, and
it does repent me that I have appeared therein, but for the rest it was not
mine but another, whose work shall abide, and for this (to prevent thy former
lying spirit) I declare that not one of those Ministers, or any other person
who would have stored me up herein, I say, not one of them have the least
knowledge of what I have here done, neither shall it be known to any one of
them until it be published to the sight of the world; and now for that evil
thou have declared to come upon me, fear possesses me not, but I bear with thy
weakness therein; yet for the reproach it is thy own, and for that thou say
I gainsayed and turned into fables, and believed lies; it is true, great was my
folly, I did so; yet in thy meaning thou art denied, for they were not
peremptory acts, on purpose to oppose the spirit of God, but I was guided
therein through mistake, in much love toward God, the manner of which mistake
I have plainly laid open, and let all be warned thereby, for truth changes
not; and for the Priests making me their refuge there was no such thing, for I
was guided of my self to go unto them, and being well known to some of them,
they gave credit to my words (as touching those things whereof their names were
intended) though they saw not my work, which was one, and the same, as though
they had seen it, for the thing it self being only a Relation, and no
discovery of judgment: Did I make known in few words what I had declared in
many words? and were those few believed? then was there as good faith in
believing the truth of the one, as the truth of the other, but that thy
contentious mind must be at work.

Thou go forwards, saying, Was I brought to see my sin, and yet I heard
nothing of the Gospel? I say, I have not spoken that I heard nothing of the
Gospel; but if thou here meanest that I did not hear any thing of the Gospel,
then have thou spoken thou know not what, for I have heard and seen the
Ministry of the Gospel, and the power thereof; but for my believing of lies,
and gainsaying the truth, I say, by the Spirit of truth, is that Spirit from
whence thou have so spoken denied; and had I dealt with Abel my Brother like
Cain, or turned back into Egypt like C^re, then would their judgment have
rested upon me; but (as I have before spoken) fear possesses me not, my
conscience bea^ing me witness in the sight of God; but were it so, I had dealt
with Abel like as did Cain, yet nevertheless the day of my visitation had not
been over, neither had the Law power over me any longer then I had been a
servant unto corruption; for when Cain had killed his brother, there was yet
mercy if that he increased not in his uncleanness, as the spirit says unto
him, If thou do well, thou shall have thy reward, if otherwise, then sin
lies at the door: Now where either of us are found in ungodlie deeds, the
Lord rebuke us, but for thy railing Accusation, and turning truth into lables,
and so making lies thy refuge, thou art come up for proof before the Lord, by
whose spirit thy spirit it is which is savoured and tried, unto whom thy voice
is known and witnessed against, as being the voice of a roaring Lion, and a
ravenous Bear, and not from the spirit of the Lord; and now is it that thou art
the man who has ensnared thy self, and brought a prejudice upon the truth, for
that thou have consulted with the Beast and the false Prophet, and so thou art
become the devourer; and here is Judas and the chief Priests, and their false
Witnesses; and here are the lies and the confusions, least simple minds should
be led with a lie through the some of the Frogs.

And now art thou made manifest in this thy work, as one who is gone astray out
of the plain way of the true shepherd, and so art become a stranger to the
flocks of his Companions; wherefore learn hence to stay at home, and receive
teachings from that true shepherd, that thou may know his voice, and follow
him, who gives to his chosen eternal life, who is the Light of the world, and
^nlightneth every one that comes into the world; whose judgment is true upon
his enemies, and whose condemnation abides for ever.

Wherefore a Word to those three sorts of people (of whom thou speak) who
may be concerned in what I have done.

To the first sort, Those who have received the Light of Christ, whose eye is
in their head, who are come to any measure of the Anointing, who are joined in
the Election; to you I say, is this deliverance from the bonds of iniquity,
and from that Captivity wherein you were carried aside from the peaceable
union and enjoyment of the eternal love; to you is this deliverance given, that
your lives might show forth the life and death of him, by whom you were called,
to the praise and glory of his grace, and for which end he have given his
Light, that with it ye might see all what is darkness, all what loves and
makes a lie, all what is fallen from God; that ye might comprehend the depth of
Satan, and all the secret bonds of iniquity; and here is the Rock Christ,
before whom all shall fall, and this Rock, this Light is your defense, in whom
abiding, the false Prophet, the Beast and the Deceiver is seen and rejected,
and not only in your selves, but also in the persons of those in whom he does
appear; wherefore stand fast in that liberty whereunto you are called, that
your obedience being wrought in that faith which gives life, ye might in the
end obtain the Crown.

To the second sort, Those who in their hearts are convinced of the way of
truth, but finding it straight to their carnal pleasures and profits, not
loving the truth more then the world, but taking pleasure in unrighteousness,
and serving and loving the creature more then the Creator; to you I say, watch
while as yet ye have time, and please not your selves with vanity and the work
of lies, that ye stumble not in the way which leads to life, and so he
swallowed up of corruption; for if while you seek to be justified by Christ you
are found in the transgression, and so frustrate the Grace of God, there
remains no more sacrifice for sin; wherefore call to mind your former
condition, when you were strangers to the true Faith, and so kept in bondage
under the Law, and learn from him who is true, to receive the love and grace
made known, that ye might walk worthy of that calling whereunto you are
called, and show forth the praise of him who has opened your eyes, and give
you to see that darkness by which (in times past) you were sold under sin,
wherefore in love receive admonition, that so being redeemed out of the world,
ye might grow up in him who is the Fountain of eternal life, and be brought to
see the glory of the Fathers love, This then is the message that we have heard
of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, in him is no darkness at all,
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and
do not the truth, John 1.5.6.

To the third sort, such who have a simplicity in them, and a love to the
truth, and the way thereof, and would walk in it did they know it, but are yet
kept in blindness and darkness by their blind Guides, who take advantage by
these works of the devil, lies, and slanders, to thicken the Vail, and
strengthen the bonds, thereby to keep them from the light of life, and the way
of peace, and so in the way of destruction for their corrupt ends, I say, for
you who are in this case, out of the knowledge of God, his light, and life,
which is salvation, for you have I much been disquieted, being sensible of your
condition; but as I have already endeavored to remove that prejudice, which
may attend you by those false conclusions, which have appeared in enmity to
what I have done, though I may not say directly in enmity to you: And as I have
discovered the truth of that cause and end for which I have appeared to the
world, which thing is not that thereby ye should be affrighted from the truth,
but when received, that ye might give heed to abide in that by which you were
convinced, that so ye may not run into the same excess, so also that ye may
not be overcome with that spirit of deceit, and stablished in that corrupt mind
in which you have been kept and guided out of the ways of truth, I say, that
ye may not be overcome (by any work of mine) to abide in this darkness. That
God who is a Spirit, is not divided, but his Name is one, and this God cannot
be known by any ways of worship, or practice amongst men, but by his Son, who
is that Spirit and Life, by which the Election of God are redeemed out of all
corruption, out of all ways and works of the flesh, into a spiritual Union
with that God who is the Father of Spirits, and cannot be worshipped, but by
and in the Spirit, and therefore is it spoken in Scripture concerning Christ,
That for this purpose was he made manifest, to destroy the works of the devil,
John 3.8. Now where is this manifestation of Christ to be found, for the
destruction of the works of the flesh, or of the devil, but in fallen man, where
the works of the unclean spirit are wrought? and from whence they do proceed?
and for which cause was that promise given? That the Seed of the Woman, should
break the head of the Serpent, which Seed is Christ, he was born under the Law,
to redeem them that were under the Law; he was brought forth into the world,
and made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it, he suffered in his
body the death of the Cross, and after that time, appointed of his Father, he
was raised out of the grave, clothed with immortality, and received up into
glory; and now he has given gifts unto men, he has dispersed his seed, he
has given of his spirit, he has made known his light, in, and unto all the
children of men, that by, and with this his manifestation and discovery of
himself, his eternal love and grace, I say, that by, and with this, men might
see, and understand, and receive power for the destruction of the body of
corruption, and for the service and worship of God in spirit, in obedience to a
living faith; and now let men profess what they will, and assemble themselves
in what way, and under what manner soever, yet if they receive not their
Ministry from this Spirit Christ Jesus revealed in all, and follow him who is
the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin, that they may receive power from him
to be redeemed out of sin, I say, if they receive not their testimony from this
Spirit of Jesus, to live therein, they shall not, neither can they ever come to
see that eternal love, that peace and union, which is in God through Christ
Jesus, the portion of the faithful, in him who is perfect: Wherefore I say unto
you all, who take pleasure in your uncleanness, and sport your selves with your
secret abominations, now in the day time, and yet boast of your Redeemer, I say
unto you repent, lest that day come upon you unawares, in which there is no
time or space for repentance, and look unto him who is the light of Israel; and
is given for a light to the Gentiles, that they might see and return unto him,
who is the Redeemer out of all sin, who restores the breaches, and builds up
the walls of Jerusalem, and gives life unto his two Witnesses who have lain
slain in the streets thereof, that they might go forth, and declare the
everlasting Gospel of peace.

FINIS.
