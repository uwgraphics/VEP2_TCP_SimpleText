THE WATCHMANS Warning-peece, OR, PARLIAMENT Soldiers Prediction. SHOWING,
THAT If our ARMIES lay down ARMS*
before the Work is at an end,
We may expect yet worser Harms,
More precious lives and States to spend.
depiction of a man on a mountainside.
An Emblem of this Age, before all is set,
To show the thing that is not ended yet:
Smile not thereon, for sure it is a sad one;
For good men to be cheated by Abaddon,
The Relation.
THere was a plain, just, down right man indeed,
Armed for Truths defense in time of need;
His foes he conquerd', thought the storm was over,
Unarmed himself of weapons which he wore.
Then on a sudden comes the Dragon fierce,
With open mouth, and arrovv^d tongue to pierce,
The Leopard against the Lamb appeared most cruel:
Venomous Serpent acts his part in Duel.
The Heart did start, the Lamb did stand in fear,
When vvilde beasts came with open mouths to tear,
When Reason savv it, he was at a stand,
And went to take what was at his left hand.
The Description.
And what is by this EMBLEM represented?
The STATE ( by PLOTS of Papists) circumvented
Shall I demonstrate still, to make you know,
That these (PPP) are Papists all arovv.
The Dragons He^d, the POPE does represent,
His sharp tongued shaft, Curses which he does vent,
His Teeth are ENVY, and his Horns are Power,
The Dragons Body, is Romes Church, that whore.
The Spotted Leopard also has his Doom,
This body pleads for Prelates Brats of Rome.
His Jaws are Malice, Head EPISCOPAL.
A gaping Mouth, Teeth, Pavves, tyrannical.
The Crooked Serpent creeps upon the Earth.
An Antichristian Pre^byter by birth,
His Head's from Rome, his Tail and Body so.
With them to Aye- Perdition he shall go.
But all the choycest Friends to Parliament,
That join with one Unanimous Consent,
A blessing may expect on their Designs:
Where Wisdom guarded with an Army, shines.
