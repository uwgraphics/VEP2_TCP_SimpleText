To the Right Honorable, the high Court of Parliament;
The Humble Petition of many hundreds of distressed Women, Trades-mens Wives,
and Widows.
THAT your poor Petitioners being fallen into great want and necessity through
the great decay of Trading, as it is generally conceived, occasioned for want
of due execution of Justice upon incendiaries and delinquents upon this State,
producing the manifold distractions and distempers that are now therein; and
having diverse times petitioned for redress thereof, and composing the
differences in the same, the relief and remedying the excessive grievances not
only by the Citizens of London, and Tradesmen in and about the Suburbs
thereof, which have not yet been answered, not as we conceive through the
neglect or reiection of the Honorable House of Commous, but by the mere
opposition of some Bishops and Lords sitting in the House of Peers: And there
having also been several Petitions by your Petitioners delivered formerly
into the Lords House, which they having received no satisfactory answer of as
yet, info^ceth us once again to Petition this Honorable House for answer to
the same, in granting your Petitioners their just desires and requests, which
are:

First, that Bishops, with their whole usurped government, both Spiritual and
Temporal, and all Offices appertaining to the same government, wherein they
have exercised and executed injustice and oppression over the Children and
Saints of God, the Kings faithful and loyal Subjects; may be extinguished and
abolished, all superfluous and superstitious Ceremonies now joined to the
service of Almighty God, and introduced into the exercise of true Religion, and
war^anted by the same, but repugnant to the purity and sincerity thereof, whose
beginning is from Satan and that son of Perdition, who is the child of that
bottomless pit, Antichrist and his followers and Disciples, children of
disobedience to God and their lawful Princes, the principal steps leading
to idolatry; and finally to Apostasy from God and his true Religion, the only
means and instrument to nourish vice and impurity in the Clergy and Ministry
in their lives and conversations; the mixing with the true Doctrine of Christ
and his Apostles, the Traditions and Inventions of man, thereby corrupting the
pure and sincere teaching of the Word of God, seducing and blinding the people
and Disciples of Christ in their Religion; may be annihilated and utterly
abolished in the Church of England, and other his Majesty's Dominions under his
Royal subjection.

Secondly, that faithful, laborious and learned Teachers may be placed in the
Ministry, whereby the people of God may rightly be taught and instructed in
the ways of Godliness and Holiness, and such as are scandalous and vicious
in their lives and conversations, whose examples does more increase the
Kingdom of Darkness, whose original is the Devil, by teaching men to live
in uncleanness and unholinesse, then their Doctrines win souls to God, or
such as are unsound and corrupt in their doctrines, may be removed from the
place of the Ministry.

Thirdly, that Popish Lords, and all such in the House of Peers may be
sequestered the House, that are any ways dissaffected to the Protestant
Religion, who are generally conceived to be the hinderers and opposers of
composing the differences in the State, of bringing evil doers to trial, and
deserved punishment, and of settling true Religion in this Kingdom.

Fourthly, that the distressed estate in Ireland may be in time remembered
before it be too late, and that speedy aid and assistance of men money and
ammunition may be thither transported for their Relief.

Fifthly, that this Kingdom may be put into a present posture of War, for the
safety and defense thereof.

Sixthly, that all incendiaries and delinquents, may without any further delay,
be brought to trial, and punishment, as they shall be found to deserve the
protraction of time therein, has been the only cause of the decay of trading,
as it is conceived, and of all the miseries and troubles this Kingdom now
groans under.

And your humble and distressed Petitioners, with bended knees, and upright
hearts, shall daily pray for the continuance and prosperous success of this
High and Honorable Court of Parliament, to settle and reform all things that
are amiss in this Commonwealth, both in Church and State, and all other his
Majesty's Kingdoms, to which they shall ever say, Amen.
