LONDON, Printed for Robert Wood. 1643.

A Perfect Declaration of all the Promises, and Protestations, made unto the
Kings Majesty by the Parliament, by way of Accommodation.
Wherein the Parliament have made known to the World their own ends and
intentions, and offered to His Majesty all that a Treaty can produce, or His
Majesty desire.
WHereas by a Declaration of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament of
the 26. of January, 1642. It is said, That having taken into serious
consideration the present state and condition of eminent danger, in which the
Kingdom now stands, by reason of a Malignant Party prevailing with His
Majesty, putting him upon violent and perilous ways, and now in Arms against
us, to the hazarding of His Majesty's person, and for the oppression of the
true Religion the Laws and liberties of this Kingdom and the power and
privildges of Parliament, all which every honest man is bound to defend,
especially those who have taken the late protestation, by which they are more
perticulerly tied unto it, and the more answerable before God should they
neglect it; wherefore they finding themselves engaged in the necessity to take
up Arms likewise for the defense of these which otherwise must suffer and
perish, and having used all good ways and means to prevent extremities, and
preserve the peace of the Kingdom (which good endeavors of theirs, the
Malignity of their Enemies have rendered altogether successelesse and vain)
therefore they did now think fit to give this account unto the world to be a
satisfaction unto all men of the Justness of their proceedings, and a warning
unto those who are involued in the same danger with them, to let them see the
necessity and duty which lies upon them, to save their Religion and Country,
for which purpose they set forth this declaration; wherein is most excellently
showed the eminent danger of the kingdom, and how far the malignant party
has prevailed: and in the latter end of this declaration, it follows in these
words, we the Lords and Commons are resolved to expose our lives and fortunes
for the defense and maintenance of the true Religion the Kings person honor
and estate, the power and privileges of Parliament, and the just rights and
libertyes of the Subject, and for the prevention of that mischievous design,
which gives motion to all the rest, and have been so strongly persued these
many years, the altering of our Religion, which if God in his great mercy had
not miraculously diverted long ago, had been brought to the condition of poor
Ireland weltering in our own blood and confusion, and do here require all
those who have any sense of piety, honor or commpassion, to help a distressed
state especially such as have taken the protestation, and are bound in the same
duty with us unto their God, King and Country, to come in to aid and assist
this, being the true cause for which we raise an Army under the Command of the
Earl of Essex, with whom in this cause we will live and die.

And after many humble Petions to his Majesty whereby the Parliament presented
their dutiful affections in aduising and desireing those things which they
held most necessary for the preservation of Gods true Religion, his Majestyes
safety and honor and the peace of his Kingdom: By their Petition the 16 of
July. 1642 there be these words viz we do in this our humble and loyal
Petition prosterate our selves to your Majestyes feet beseeching your royal
Majesty that you would be pleased to forbear anb remove all preparations and
accomodtions of War perticulerly the forces from about Hull from Newcastle
Plymouth, Lincoln, Lincolneshire, and other places, and that your Majesty will
recall the Commissions of Array which are illegal, and dismiss Troops and
extraordinary gaurds by you raised, your Majesty would come near to your Parl
and harken to their faithful advise and humble petions which shall noely to
the defense and advancment of Religion, your own royal honor and safety, the
preservation of Our Laws and Liberties, and we have been and shall ever be
careful to prevent and punish all tumults and seditious actions speeches and
writings, which may give your Majesty just cause of distaste and apprehension
of danger, from which public ayms and resolutions no synister or private
respect shall ever make us to declyne etc. To which if your Majesty's courses
and Councels shall from henceforth concur, we doubt not but we shall quickly
make it appear to the world by the most eminent effects of love and duty, that
your Maiestyes Personal safety your royal honouor and greatness are much
deerer to us then our own lives and fortunes, which we do most heartily
dedicate and shall most willingly employ for the support and maintanance thereof.

And in a Declaration and Protestation of the Lords and Commons in Parliament
of the 22 of October 1642 they being in these words; we the Lords and Commons
in this present Parliament assembled do in the presence of Almighty God for
the satisfaction of our Consences and discharge of that great trust which lies
upon us make this Protestation and Declaration to this Kingdom and Nation and
to the whole world, That no private passion or respect no evil intention to
his Maiestyes person, noe design to the prejudice of his just honor and
authority, engaged us to raise forces and take up Arms against the authors of
this War. wherewith the Kingdom is now inflamed: And we have allwaies
desired from our hearts and souls, manifested in our actions and proceedings,
and in several humble Petitions and Remonstrances to his Majesty profess our
loyalty and obedience to his Crown, readiness and resolution to defend his
person, and support his estate with our lives and forunes to the uttermost of
our power, that we have been willing to pass by not only those Iniuryes
ignomines slanders and false accusations wherewith we have been privately
oppressed and greened, but likewise many public encroachments and high
usurpations to the prejudice of Religion and liberty diverse bloody traiterous
practices and designs for the utter ruin and destruction of the Church and
state, so as we might for the time to come been secured from that wicked and
malignant party, those periurous and traiterous Councels, who have been the
authors and fomenters of the former mischiefs and present calamities, which
have and still do distemper the Church and state.

And for diverse weighty reasons expressed in this Declaration and protestation,
it is said, we are resolved to enter into a sollemn oath and covenant with God
to give up ourselves into his hands, and that we will to the uttermost of our
power and judgment maintain his truth and conform our selves to his will:
That we will defend this cause with the hazard of our lives against the Kings
Army, and against all that shall ioyn with them in the persecution of this
wicked design, according to the form to be agreed upon by both houses of
Parliament to be subscribed by our hands, and that we will for the same ends
associate ourselves, and unite with all the well affected in the City of London
and other parts of of his Majestiie dominions, etc. and we doubt not but the
God of truth and the great protector of his people, will assist and enable us
in this our just defense, to restrain the malice and fury of those that seek
our ruin and to secure the persons, estates and liberties, of all that ioyn
with us and to procure and establish the safety of Religion and fruition of our
Laws and liberties in this and all other his Majesty's dominions, which we do
here again profess before the everliving God, to be the chief end of all our
Councels and resolutions, without any intention or desire to hurt or iniure his
Majesty either in his person or power.

And in the Parliaments humble answer to his Majesty's message of 11 of
September 1642 page 2. are the words: Neither had your Ma^jesty cause to
complain that you are denied a Treaty, when we offer all that a treaty could
produce or your Majesty expect securely, honor, service obedience support and
all other effects or an humble loyal and faithful subjection and seek nothing
but that Religion, liberty, peace of the Kingdom, and safety of the Part may be
secured from the open violence and cuning practices or a wicke party, who have
long plotted our ruin and destruction etc. And after diverse other things
contained in that message they conclude thus: all this notwithstanding, as we
never gave your Majesty any just cause of withdrawing your self from your
great Counsel, so it has ever been and shall ever be far from us to give
any impediment to your return, or to neglect any proper means of curing the
distempers of the Kingdom, and ^^^sing the dangerous breaches betwixt your
Majesty and the Parliament according to the great trust which lies upon us; and
your Majesty shall now be pleased to come back to your Parliament without your
forces, we shall be ready to secure your royal person Crown and dignity, with
our lives and fortunes your presence in this great Council being the only
means of any treaty betwixt your Majesty and them, with hope of success.

And in none of our desires to your Majesty shall we be swayed by any
particular man's advantage, but shall give a clear testimony to your Majesty
and the the whole world that in all things done by us we faithfully intend the
good of your Majesty, and of your Kingdoms, and we will not be diverted from
this end by any private or self respects whatsoever.

So by whot has been already gathered it does most clearly appears (not to
degresse feom their own words in that Declaration of the 26 of July 1642) that
all this while the two houses of Parliament have with all duty and loyalty
still applied themselves unto his Majesty and labored by humble prayers and
clear convinceing reasons and arguments in several perticulers to satisfy
him of their intentions, the ^^nesse of their proceedings, their desire of the
safety of his royal person, and the peace of the Kingdom, and l^kewise (as
has been declared in some speeches) that if his Majesty would be graciously
pleased to apply himself to the faithful advice of his Parliament, they would
make him the greatest King that ever swayed scepter in this Kingdom; Therefore
(in my opinion) I conceive it not amiss that the Kingdom should once more be
put in mind of some part of the Declaration or the 15 of October 1643 in these
words: That it be commended to ^e^ious consideration of those in the Kings Army
and of a^^o her that inc^^nd to assist and serve his Majesty in this unp^o^s
and (...) War, (amongst whom it may be hoped there a^e ^om^ (...) men and I
contestants) what it is that moves them in this quarrel? Is it for fear or
some Innouations and alterations of Religion or Church government let such as
are possessed with his vain and cause esse apprehension know, that no^ thing is
intended or desired but to take away the Government ^^y Bishops which has been
so constantly evidently mische^ and dangerou^ to the Church and state, and such
other thing as shall be found to be ^y offensive and nothing to be settled and
introduced but by authority of Parliament, after a consultation first had with
an assembly of Learned and reverent Divines.

Is it to uphold the authority prerogative and honor of the King and safety of
his royal Person? Surely the Parliament is and ever has been ready to do
any thing that belongs to them to secure all those, which they have often
testyfied by many hemble Petitions to his Majesty.

If there can be no cause for any of these respects to seek the destruction of
the Parliament, and the blood and ruin of their kindred and friends and
acquaintance what (...) to be the matter of quarrel and the motives of such
great (...) and the effects and consequence of their victory^^ if they should
prevayl? that priests Jesuits and the Popes Nunticioes may, do^ ^ere and govern
in the Kings Counsel as heretofore, that the A^ of (...) York and their
Suffragants may suppress dilligent a^ (...) and banish and oppress all the
most pious and best (...) of the Kingdom, and introduce the Romish Religion
(...) profession, till they have strength and boldness to cast off (...) and
openly apear that which indeed they are, and would not (...) to be.

That the Earl of Bristoll and his son the Lord Digby, Mr. Germine and other
such Traitors, may possess the great places of government of this Kingdom, and
be the Arbitrers of preferments and disgraces to such as shall further or
oppose their designs that the Delinquants opposers and dsstroyers of the
Kingdom, may not only escape the Justice of the Parliament but Triumph in the
sopyles of all honest and good patriots and that through our troubles and
divisions, the Rebels in Jreland may prevail, that we may cease to be free
Nation, and become the object of cruelty and oprpession at home, and scorn and
infame abroad.

If there can be no other fruit of their hazard and endeavor on that side, let
them then cosinder whether by adhering to the parliament they may not expect
effects more suitable to the desires of honest men, the glory of God in the
preservation of his truth the peace of the Church, by securing it against the
pride ambition of the Clargy, the greatness and security of the King by
freeing him from false and Traiterous Councels, and establish him in the hearts
and affections of his people, the prosperity of the whole Kingdom, by the
blessing of good Laws and righteous government.

FINIS.
