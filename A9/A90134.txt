THE SPEECH, OF Phillip Herbert, Late Earl of PEMBROKE.
Many worthy Members, coming out of the House, received his Honer in with all
respect, as a Member elected by the County of Berkshire, in stead of Sir
Francis Pile disceased, where being no sooner outred but he spoke as follows.
Gentlemen,
FOr so I can but now rightly call you all, though I know there be amongst you
many worthy Lords, Knights and Burgesses; yet since all Domination and Lordship
is cried down by the People, I think it my Duty to lay down the vanity of my
Titles at the feet of this Supreme Authority, and Sink me. I hold it the best
Policy so to do; and the best honesty too; LORDS, EARLS, KINGS, DUKES are all
but Marks of the Gentiles, and cannot be proper to us Christians, that should
have wit enough to Rule our selves, and not exercise Lordship over our
brethren, he that would be chief among you, let him be your servant, Damme, I
have been your Servant, and will be your servant till death, I am an elect
Member of this House, and no Ruler; neither have I any desire to Rule: for a
Ruler should have his rule, 'Zblood, do ye make a Carpenter, or a Coxcombe on
me, that ye think I Will be a ruler; Sinck me, I grow Old, it is enough for me to
Rule my Horse, and not to assume a Power to Rule others, for Ruling LORDS in an
overruling scence, is a thing that stands neither with reason, law, justice
nor Christianity; D^, I think (...) lawfully Elected, and have as good
quallities as another, and therefore may claim, have, and make use of any
Privilege of Parliament, either in relation to my Person. Quallitie or Estate;
Sink me and Damme, if I exercise Lordship over a worm: Judge me, I am as proud
of Phillip Herbert, or Burgess of Berkshire, as I am of Earl of Pembroke, and
my Reason, (Mr. Speaker) is this, I was PHILLIP HERBERT before I was Earl of
Pembroke, and now I am Burgess for Berkshire, and I Bark not, and bawle not,
(if I see occasion) as well as the best -- of you all, then let the County that
choose me their minister, and servant, complain of me, or turn me out, and
choose another; No, Sink me, the Country ought not to be at the charge of
keeping Dogs, and bark themselves, or feed their Dogs so high and lusty,
that like Acteons, they devour their Masters: Pardon me, (Mr. Speaker) I hope
you do not conceive that I call the Parliament Dogs, I speak concerning their
vigillancy, to preserve their Masters Estates, and in that point, I may (in my
blunt language) liken them to Dogs; but every like is not the same; Mr.
Speaker, conceive me aright, I would have you not to be Dogs, but as dogs,
that is as I conceive, not to be Dumb dogs; I shall ever hate a dumb Dog, but
SIR, I know you are no dumb Dog, because you are Speaker.

Gentlemen, -- Member of this honorable House of Commons, though it be a thing
strange, and not common in England for an Earl (as not long since I held my
self to be) and a Member of the LORDS House to be made a Commoner, or removed
from the upper end to the Lower end of the Table, I am not so void of
Understanding, or common Scense, as not to think my self highly honored
therewith, I am no respecter of Persons or Places Sir, I know how to humble my
self, and do acknowledge it my Duty, not only to lay down my Titles and
Dignities, but my life and Honors for the Good of the Commonwealth, -- Damme,
it is not my Wealth that I prize above the Commonwealth, though I love both,
and would do my uttermost to preserve both, which I take to be the chief Cause
of the Peoples choosing me to be their Representative; It Is true, I was formerly
chosen Chancellor of Oxford, not only by this honorable House, but the House
of LORDS then being, but considering my weak abillities in Divinity, being (I
thank God) little troubled with the same, nor guilty of any more confused or
confounding langvages, then my own Mother Tongue, and for Arts and Sciences,
they never shall trouble my head, I hold it my best Art and Science to preserve
myself and my Estate, and get more if I can; Damme, he that cares not for his
Wealth, can never care for the Commonwealth, for how can he that will not do
good for himself, do good for Others; Charity ought to begin at home Mr.
Speaker.

Truly Gentlemen, I know not what errors are lately crept into that University,
but at my last Visitation I think I plagued them to purpose; Confound me, they
had as good to have been Visited with the plague as with me, for I spared none,
right or rong, Damme, I think the University was never better weeded since it
was a University, I pulled up all the Popish Poppies, the Malignant mayweed,
the thistles and hemlock that choked the wheat, Damme, they had nigh choked
me with fuming and swearing at them, a Pox of their Reasons, they were logic
to me, for I could understand not one of them, and if I could, I would not, I
had no such Order in my Instructions, I acted as vigorously as God would give
me leave; I spared nere a son of Rome amongst them all, Damme, not my own
Godson; 'Zblood, if my Father had been there a Scholar, and Popishly affected,
(as I was told they were) he should have turned out with the rest, M. Speaker,
I hate a turn-coat and a Black-coat too. I love a Buffe-coat, or Mistress Mays
Petty-coat, better then Popish Canonical coats, Damme, if ye were all of my
mind (Gentlemen) you would pull down the Universities, they are but the Nurses
of Learning and Superstition; Damme, Learning and Superstition has occasioned
all these Wars, and Blood; Refuse me, I had rather be a Sculler then a
Scholar, these Arts and Sciences (as they call them) are dangerous Enemies to
the State, and steal and draw away the hearts and affections of the People
from Martial Affairs; and therefore (in my simple judgment) it would redound
much to the strengthening of the State, to change the property of them, and in
stead of making them Nurceries of learning, to make them fencing Schools, or
Nurceries of War; Damme, this Kingdom has more need of Warring then learning,
for all Christendom threatens Us; therefore (Mr. Speaker) let us not always be
fools, 'Zblood, I have so much wit in my Block-head, That if I see a storm a
coming, I can provide for shelter, the very hooggs teach me that, Gentlemen, I
hate human learning, Damme I can learn as good a lesson from a hog, a horse,
a Dog or a Catt, as from the best Divine in England; Pox, am I not a layman?
and can I lay out my time in in any thing better then lay learning; Besides I
am a Statesman, (I know nothing to the contrary) but that I may state my
Question then, That as I am no divine, so that J may not meddle any more with
divinity, J am no ruler, and therefore, if they cannot learn the Wit to rule
themselves, let them be unrul'd; for J have done my part with them; Gentlemen,
J hold the Chancellorship a fitter place for my Man Oldisworth, or Mr. Peter's
then my self, and therefore if your wisdoms think fit, J desire to be
discharged therefrom, because the self-denying Ordinance forbids (as J take it)
to hold two Places in the Commonwealth, therefore J desire to leave the one to
the intent, that J may mind, and apply my self the better to the other; Damme,
J cannot serve two masters, the Church and the State too, God and the --
Parliaments; if it please this honorable House, (J conceive) one Office is
enough for one man, therefore J shall betake my self only to do my Business
in this House, that the County that choose me may be the better for it;
Gentlemen, J need not be ashamed to do my business in this House, and was
never backward ye know in any good office, and would strain my self as much
for the good of the State, as Alderman Adkins, or any Member of you all; and
shall untrusse my pursestrings too, upon any just and honest occasion;
Gentlemen, as J have always loved you dearly, so J hope you will love me
again, for my great Affection to you, should draw your great Affection to me,
and indeed, we are brethren, and brethren ought to love, and agree with one
another; Damme, the very Devils can agree with one another, and cannot we?
'Zblood, are we worse then Devils? Our grand Enemy (the King) is now cut off,
and must we needs be enemies to one another, and cut off one another too;
Believe me, Lilburne deserves to be hanged, and Overton to be turned over a
ladder, and Prince the Cheesemonger to be served in the same kind, as the
Prince of Wales, that they dare be so impudent bold as to tax the Parliament,
or the Counsel of STATE with injustice, or Tyranny: Damme, It Is at least
Treason and Nonscense but to think so, and, Sink me, it is a thousand times
worse to say so, or to write so, and show the People reason for it too; A Pox
of all reasons, and reasonings for me, J never loved it in all my life; Zounds,
break a man's head, and give him a reason for it, as the Scot served me, when he
switch'd me over the face, broke my head with my own staff of office, and then
gave me a reason for it, and that was all the satisfaction J could have for
that Affront, Damme I hate a Scott, as I hate a reason, and hate a reason as I
hate the Devil, Reasoning is neither better nor worse then Treating, and we
all Know, TREATING is a Malignant and an Enemy to the State, and if the Treaty
had taken effect, 'Zblood we might all have been hanged and Damm'd before this:
No, reason is dangerous in a State; neither is the State bound to render any
reason to Lilburne, Overton, or any body else for their Actions, or what ever
they do; had it not been for Reasoning, we had settled the Suprcame Authority
on the People long ago, and then we had had Peace, and a settled STATE; How
simple is it to think that a Parliament is unjust, or can err, that's a likely
matter indeed? No, Parliaments are chosen by the People, because they cannot
err? KINGS may err, as David, and the late King did; But when did you ever
read in the Bible, that a Parliament could err, or had erred. And thus I hope
I have given you Satisfaction in this point.

For this your Act of Leavying Money, I give my free consent, Pray what can be
done without money, Damme, Soldiers that fight for Money, must have money; and
though J am no Soldier my self, yet Damme, I love a Soldier with all my
heart, and he that fights for money, let him win Money, and (Sink me,) if he
winnes it, let him wear it too; Zblood, where should we have money for
Soldiers, but of the Countries and Cities whom they fight to preserve; unless
they would have us pay them out of our own Estates; but surely there is none
in this Honorable House, but has more Frugallity, or at least more Wit, then
to part with any of their own Estates; Do we not labor, and spend our time
for the Good of the Commonwealth, and shall the Commonwealth deny to spend
their money for Us; Zblood, time is precious, (Mr. Speaker) and God refuse me,
we have spent a long time in their Service (at least Eight years) and cannot
so much as have a good word for our pains; Ram me, Sinck me, and Damme me, it
were a good deed to give over, and leave them to themselves, and then we should
have a Kingdom well Governed; Damme, I am out of breath, and therefore will
conclude my Speech.

Vera Copia, Your Affectionat Servant, PEMBROKE and MONTGOMERY.

FINIS.
