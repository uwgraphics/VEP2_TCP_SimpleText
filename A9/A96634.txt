TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL Sr Theophilus Biddulph KNIGHT and BARONET.
Honored Sir,
I Have presumed to Dedicate these my labors to you, being the Translation of
a most Worthy and Learned Author, Dr. Tho. Willis his Works, out of the Latin
into our Mother Tongue, for the benefit of my Countrymen: and knowing you have
always been a general, and generous Patriot, a lover of your Country, and of
all manner of Industry and Ingenuity, I question not, but you will kindly
receive this my Dedication; though not for my sake, yet for the many admirable
things that may be found in the Book it self, and for the good and benefit,
which this my laborious task may bring to the public. As I doubt not of your
innate Goodness, having already had some particular experience thereof, so I
shall no ways fear an unkind reception: And although I launch not into the sea
of your Praises, as is the late custom of Dedicators to do, I am persuaded,
that this my plain Epistle will be as kindly accepted; for I know you to be so
modest a Man, as not to love to see all your good Actions, Virtues and worth,
Rhetorically painted and laid open before your Eyes: for as your Worth is too
well known, this way to receive any addition; so the praise thereof being
needless, will rather cause you to blush, than be any ways pleased. But yet I
cannot forbear to take notice to the World, that your whole Life has been a
true pattern of Loyalty and Religion, which in these troublesome and distracted
times, may be worthily related and mentioned, as a praiseworthy Example for
others to imitate and follow: and that you are both a true lover of the Church
of England, your King, and Country, which you have eminently showed in all your
Actions, and manifested to the World, by your several public Employs, in the
behalf of your Country, and of the Renowned City of London, of which you are a
most worthy Member. And no doubt, but that it is for this your stedfastness in
Religion, your Loyalty to your Prince, your Love to your Country, and your
uprightness in your Dealings, that God has showered on you all manner of
external Blessings, giving you a fair Estate, through your own Industry,
Wisdom, and Prudence, a Virtuous Consort, and a prosperous Issue, the fair and
flourishing Branches of your Ancient Stock and Family: To all which outward
felicities, I shall pray, That God may also indue your noble Soul with the
Celestial and Eternal Blessings and treasures of the World to come, and that
you may be constantly happy both here and hereafter. I remain,

Honored Sir, Your most humble and faithful Servant, S. PORDAGE.

A Medical-Philosophical Discourse OF FERMENTATION OR, Of the Intestine Motion

MDCLXXXI.

TO THE Most Reverend Father in Christ And the Right Honorable HIS GRACE,
GILBERT: By Divine Providence Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate and
Metropolitan of all England, and one of His Majesty's most Honorable
Privy-Councellors.
Most Holy Prelate,
THE Eagle will not acknowledge his suspected Chicken, by one only sign, for it
is not enough that it can look against the light, unless it be able also to
behold the Sun's Beams without winking: and indeed although this our hasty issue,
whether by the help of its own blindness, or of that doubtful light in which it
lived, has been able to come abroad, yet it has not sufficiently given marks
of its true race, until it might delight its Eye with your brightness as at the
Sun's Beams.

These Meditations or Discourses tho several times published, now therefore at
length boast, that they are able to show themselves to the light first, with
your Sacred name in the front, it is then but reason, that the same Mecaenas,
who has brought me forth into the open light, from my own darkness, and from
the filthiness, and soot in which I was involved, being condemned among the
metals; should think not it any detraction, to lend to my Works Ornament, and
Splendour, as well as to the Author and Publisher.

It was by your means (most Noble Prelate) that I obtained the Votes in this
Famous University for the place of Sidly Professor, for how small soever my
Merits might seem, they were helped by the greatness and weight of your opinion.

I am exceeding conscious to my self, how unfit, being destitute of all help, I
came to that Province, both for the Dignity of the Place, of the University,
and of my Mecaenas, yet I believe nothing is to be dispair'd of, under so great
Auspicies. I would therefore, if there be any thing, at any time, more happily
thought of, in the scrutiny of Nature; and brought forth by me, that it be not
referred to my Ingenuity, or (which I might perhaps more truly deserve) my
Industry, but to the Influences of my Patron: For to him only he Dedicates and
Consecrates himself and all his, who is

Your Graces most humble And for ever obliged Servant, T. W.

THE PREFACE.
THE same thing happens to me, about to speak of Fermentation, that once did to
a Famous Historian, when he wrote his Commentary of the Roman Empire, to wit,
whilst he endeavored to draw forth, as it were in a little Table, the affairs
only of that Nation, he was necessitated not only to recount the Actions of one
people, but of all mankind: in like manner, whilst I did meditate on a few
things only concerning the energy, and the means of the working of Ferments, I
have brought into this Tract, as it were swelled up with a certain Ferment, the
whole Provision, and Dowry of all Nature. Entering upon this Disquisition, I
thought I had been tied only to the Bakers Oven, and Brewers Furnace, being
condemned to the Mill, not to have proceeded beyond their limits, unless by
chance, or with leave; but after that I had begun to look more deeply into the
matter, I perceived I had gotten a far more large Province: Because it plainly
appeared, besides these of Art, very many Works of Nature, to be not only like,
but themselves the effects of Fermentation: For when, for the solving of the
Phoenomenas, which are met with about the swelling up of the mealy Mass, and
the working of Wine, and of other Liquors, I had Composed diverse Arguments,
Reasons, and Hypotheses, I found at length, those first begotten Particles, by
whose Orgasm or Heat, those vulgar preparations do Ferment, to beget the Causes
of motions, and alterations, in whatever things they are mixed with besides;
wherefore, I may be pardoned, if I have strayed far from our proposition, and
have seemed to any one, to have heaped together here, too plentiful an Harvest
of Matter, because I was wholly led by the same third of Ratiocination, and the
most conjunct Affinity of things, to these various and diverse Concretes. If
any one shall object, that I prostitute the unusual Notions, and almost only
heard of, in the Shops of the Chemists, unhandsomly among the works of ordinary
people, I say, these Principles, which being brought indeed to perform the self
moving motions of Natural things, also more easily to represent them to the
vulgar capacity, and lay them not only before their Eyes, but even into their
very Hands; what of these kind of substances, I call Particles, men tho rude
and unskilful, may perceive even by the help of their senses to be in the
things: besides the names of Sulphur, Salt, and Spirit, and the rest, are more
familiarly known, than Matter, and Form, or the four Principles of the
Peripateticks. As to our method, and manner of Philosophizing, no man can blame
me, if I should not here describe all things according to Rule, and Analytick
Patterns; because in this Work, it chances for me to wander, without a Guide,
or Companion, in solitary places, and as it were in a solitude trodden by no
footsteps, where I not only make a Journey, but my way also: therefore, when
ever I deviate, I cannot be said to err, among right Judges of our endeavors,
who have no Path in which I should Walk, nor could find a Track, which I might
fear to miss.

ON THE AUTHORS Medical-Philosophical Discourses.
THE intricate and hidden cause of things,
Both Peace and Strife by what means Nature brings,
What various motions Bodies do inspire;
What mixes with the Waters quenchless Fire?
What Bonds the Elements together tie,
Before this happyer Age unfolded lie:
Things hid to former Ages, and unknown,
The Secrets of the world to all are shown.
Metals dug from the Bowels of the Earth,
Tho they from Phoebus boast their Heavenly birth,
We without light, dark and obscure behold,
And Splendor's found only in burnisht Gold.
Iron unknown lay hidden without light,
By Slaves wrought from the Mine grows dazeling bright.
This to whole Troops confusion does afford,
Wit, which first framed, stoops to, the Victor Sword.
We thus of old did Nature search in vain,
Our Arts did only in the outward bark remain,
But now we her hid mysteries unfold,
And the great secrets of the world behold.
Better than us, herself can hardly tell,
What Love does far within high Mountains dwell.
What flame first gives the Marble Quarry birth;
To Metals forms blind Rudiments of Earth,
And the hard child does to perfection bring:
Why Earth shows her rich Treasures in the Spring;
And shines, made brave with her own Native flowers.
What gentle gales, and what sweet moistning showers,
Do on the pregnant Goddess Seed bestow;
Whilst Heavenly Iris mounts the Cloudy Bow.
Why Ceres swells with watery Nymphs embrace,
What Strife, what Wars spring from hot Bacchus race:
What Vulcan does the Aetnean Furnace blow;
What does soft fires through all Bodies throw.
What Spirit nimbly moves the human frame:
Whence Milky juice here, there a Purple stream,
Watering the Body: whence the Crimson flood;
And the quick Circulation of the blood.
What hidden fires in veins and intrals burn,
Which do the boiling Blood to Fevers turn.
What mixes freezing cold with parching heat,
And makes the different Zones together meet.
Whence comes the Pestilence with Stygian breath,
Riding on blasting Winds, and armed with death.
What Prophesying Humor through the Reins does pass,
What color, and what odor in the Glass?
All things lie open now: He did not know
So much, to whom Prometheus did bestow
His stolen fires: We now every part
Of the whole Earth compass about with Art.
He Is happy who Causes of things can show;
Sacred to Nature and to Phoebus too;
About his Temples Delphic Laurels spread,
And flames of lightning never shall blast his head.
Whom Hermes does with Sacred Arts imbue,
Whose Labors, Learning out of Darkness drew,
May all is days happy be, may he shine bright,
And may he still enjoy Celestial light:
May no Disease infect with poisonous breath,
Him, who gains Health from Sickness, Life from Death.
OF FERMENTATION, OR THE Inorganical Motion OF NATURAL BODIES.
CHAP. I. Of the Principles of Natural things.
THere is nothing more rarely to be met with, in the Vulgar Philosophy, where
Natural things are unfolded, with the vain figments of Forms and Qualities,
than the word Fermentation: but among the more sound (especially of later
years) who respect the Matter and Motion chiefly in Bodies, nothing is almost
more usual. But Fermentation has its name from Fervescency, as Ferment from
Ferviment or growing hot. The word is well known in making of Bread, and in the
purgings of new Wine, Beer, and other potable Liquors: thence it is also
applied to other things, which are wont to swell or grow turgid, after the same
manner: that at length it signifies, whatsoever Effervency or Turgency, that is
raised up in a Natural Body, by particles of that Body variously agitated.

Bodies of a diverse Consistency and Habitude, are apt to a Fermenting, viz.
either Thin or Thick, Liquid or Solid, Animate or Inanimate, Natural or
Artificial; in all which is found an Heterogeneity of parts or particles, to
wit, there are in them some substances light, and always endeavoring to fly
away: and also there are others thick, earthy, and more fixed, which entangle
the subtle Particles, and detein them in their Embraces, whilst they endeavor
to fly away; from the strivings, and wrestlings of these two twins, in one
Womb, the motion of Fermentation chiefly proceeds; but on the contrary, what
things do not Ferment, for the most part consist of like Particles, and are of
the same Figure and Conformation, which indeed consociat among themselves,
without any Tumult or Turgescency, lie quiet, and enjoy a deep peace. If Must,
or new Wine, or new Ale or Beer, be closely Bottl'd up, or put into Vessels of
small vent, they will grow so very hot, that often the Vessels are in danger of
breaking. But if the same Liquors, being Distilled by themselves, and then what
is separated shut up, from thence no motion or heat will follow. Wherefore,
Distilled Waters, hot Spirits, Oils, fixed Salts of Herbs, and very many other
more simple preparations of the Chemists, remain a long while without any
alteration or Fermentation, Perhaps some of the Particles do evaporate, but the
rest do not tumultuate. In the mean time the juice and blood of Vegetables or
Animals, as also all Liquors Concreted, and compounded of many things, quickly
Ferment, and from thence enter into diverse turns of changes. The Spirit of Wine
being closely shut up in a Phial shows no sign of growing hot, but if but a
little Oil of Turpentine be added to this Spirit, the Particles of the Liquor
will so leap forth, that I have seen it break a Glass Hermetically Sealed. All
Distilled Waters of Herbs, so they be kept simply in a Glass, will remain
incorrupt a long time, but if you add to the same Sugar or Syrrup, it presently
grows sour and is corrupted: Wherefore, that the Fermentation of Bodies may be
rightly unfolded, we must inquire, what those Particles or Substances are, and
of what Nature of which mixed things are Compounded, and from whose being put
together, and mutual strivings, motions for the most part naturally proceed.

Although there be many and diverse Opinions of Philosophers concerning the
beginnings of Natural things, yet there are three chiefly deserve our Assent,
and Faith, before the rest. That famous fourfold Chariot of the Peripateticks
obtains the chief place, which emulous of the four wheeled Coach of the Sun, is
hurried by a quick passage, through the fictitious Heaven of the first Matter,
and measures that vast and empty thing, with a perpetual reciprocation. For
they say, all things are Constituted out of Water, Air, Fire, and Earth; and
that out of the diverse transposition of these, Generation and Corruption, as
also the changes of all alterations whatsoever, do arise. In the second place,
and next, stands the Opinion of Democritus and Epicurus, which lately also has
been revived in our Age, this affirms all Natural effects to depend upon the
Conflux of Atoms diversely figured, so that in all Bodies, there be Particles
Round, Sharp, Foursquare, Cylindrical, Checkered or Streaked, or of some other
Figure; and from the diverse changes of these, the Subject is of this or that
Figure, Work, or Efficacy. The third Opinion of the Origination of Natural
Things, is introduced by Chemistry, which, when by an Analysis made by Fire, it
resolves all Bodies into Particles of Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water, and Earth,
affirms by the best right, that the same do consist of these. Because this
Hypothesis determinates Bodies into sensible parts, and cutts open things as it
were to the life, it pleases us before the rest.

As to the four Elements, and first Qualities from thence deduced, I must
confess that this Opinion does something help for the unfolding the Phenomenon
of Nature, but after so dark a manner, and without any peculiar respect to the
more secret recesses of Nature, it salves the appearances of things, that it is
almost the same thing, to say an House consists of Wood and Stone, as a Body of
four Elements. The other Opinion, which is only a piece of the Epicurean
Philosophy, forasmuch as it undertakes Mechanically the unfolding of things,
and accommodates Nature with Working Tools, as it were in the hand of an
Artificer, and without running to Occult Qualities, Sympathy, and other refuges
of ignorance, does happily and very ingeniously disintangle some difficult
Knots of the Sciences, and dark Riddles, certainly it deserves no light praise:
but because it rather supposes, than demonstrates its Principles, and teaches
of what Figure those Elements of Bodies may be, not what they have been, and
also induces Notions extremly subtle, and remote from the sense, and which do
not sufficiently Quadrate with the Phenomenon of Nature, when we descend to
particulars, it pleases me to give my sentence for the third Opinion
beforementioned, which is of the Chemists, and chiefly to insist upon this in
the following Tract, to wit, affirming all Bodies to consist of Spirit,
Sulphur, Salt, Water, and Earth, and from the diverse motion, and proportion of
these, in mixed things, the beginnings and endings of things, and chiefly the
reasons, and varieties of Fermentation, are to be sought. If any one shall
object, That the Atomical, and our Spagyric Principles, are altogether
subordinate, to wit, that these, tho at the last sensible, are resolved into
those, only to be signified by Conception; I shall not much gainsay him, so it
shows that those Conceptions are real. I being dull and purblind, leave the more
accurate to quick sights, being content to be so wise as to perform the
business of the outward Sense with Reason: for I profess, it pleases not me, to
devise or dream Philosophy. But that our Work may more rightly proceed, it will
be necessary, to speak first a few things of these kind of Principles in
general, and of their Affections.

I mean by the name of Principles, not simple and wholly uncompounded Entities,
but such kind of Substances only, into which Physical things are resolved, as
it were into parts, lastly sensible. By the intestine motion, and combination
of these, Bodies are begot, and increase: by the mutual departure and
dissolution of these one from another, they are altered, and perish. In the
mean time, what Particles are gathered together in the subjects, or depart away
from them, will appear under the form of Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, or of one of
the rest.

CHAP. II. A description of the Principles of Chemists, and the Properties and
Affections of them.
1. SPirits are Substances highly subtle, and Aetherial Particles of a more
Divine Breathing, which our Parent Nature has hid in this Sublunary World, as
it were the Instruments of Life and Soul, of Motion and Sense, of every thing;
whilst they of their own Nature are always enlarged, and endeavoring to fly
away, lest they should too soon leave their subjects, they are bound sometimes
with more thick Particles, that by entering into them, and by subtilizing them,
and variously unfolding them, they dispose the substance to maturity, as is to
be observed in the Vegetation, and Fermentation of Bodies; sometimes being
restrained within some spaces, to wit, the Vessels or Bowel of living
Creatures, they are compelled more often to repeat the same measures of their
motions for the performing the works of Life, Sense and Motion. From the motion
of these proceed the animation of Bodies, the growth of Plants, and the
ripening of Fruits, Liquors, and other preparations; they determinate the Form
and Figure of every thing, prefixed as it were by Divine designation: they
conserve the bonds of the mixture by their presence; and open them, by their
departure, at their pleasure: they bridle the irregularities of Sulphur and
Salt. The perfection and state of every thing consists in the plenty and
exaltation of Spirits, and the fall and declination, in their want and defect.

As to the Subjects in which the Spirits are: Minerals because they are of a
more fixed nature, wanting Motion and Vegetation, are almost without Spirits,
or at least are contented with a few. For the birth and growth of Vegetables,
they are required in a more moderate quantity. In the Constitution of a living
Creature, where there is greater Use of Spirits, for Sense and Motion, a far
more plentiful quantity is found. In the works of Art, and chiefly in those
which ascend to perfection, by Digestion and Fermentation, there are found to
be a sufficiently great proportion of Spirits: but in all subjects whatsoever,
whilst the immersed Spirits are mingled with the other Principles, their
condition or state comes under a threefold consideration: for they are either
depressed and scattered, and so involved with more thick Particles, that they
are very little seen, or show forth their powers, as in things undigested,
crude and unripe, may be perceived, in which the Spirits can hardly extricate
themselves into motion, and from which they can hardly be drawn by
Distillation. Or secondly, the Spirits flying forth from the thick substance of
the rest, are full of vigor, shake and rightly dispose the more gross
Particles, subtilize the thick, digest the crude, and bring things to the steme
or height of maturity and perfection: or lastly, Spirits having obtained the
height of things, do luxuriate and make excursions out of the Body: hence those
that remain, are by degrees lessened of their plenty and strength, until being
less in power than the Particles of the Salts and Sulphur, they are put under
their yoke, and by little and little are destroyed and driven away out of the
Subject; on this threefold state depends the beginnings or rudiments, the
maturity and exaltation, and the defect and end of things.

It is observed, when the Spiritous Latex is drawn forth of any Liquor by
Distillation, that the vapor or steam is not elevated into dew, that is, comes
together in little drops or dew, every where poured forth, as it is wont to do
in watery things; but it is divided into streaks, and many little rivulets, and
renders the Alembic marked in every part, with straight lines, only not
meridional, leading from the Center of the top, to the brim of the
Circumference. The cause of which seems to be this, to wit, since that the
spirituous substance is very subtle, it is not easily Collected into Liquor;
neither is it fixed every where about the sides of the Vessel, in its ascent,
as watery Liquors; but always stretches (...) and unless when it comes to the
top it self of the li^ head does in no wise (...) but there the spirituous
breath, being restrained as it were in a punct, and being brought backward, it
begins to gather into dew: wherefore, from that top, as it were the Fountain,
the Spirits flowing forth on every side by streams, descend in streaks toward
the mouth or brim of the Alembic. And when those lines wholly disappear, it is
a sign, that the spirituous substance is quite stilled forth, and that the
watery breath only ascends.

2, Sulphur is a Principle of a little thicker consistency than Spirit, after
that, the most active: for when the Spirits first break forth from the loosned
sub^^^nce of the mixture, presently the Sulphurous Particles endeavor to ^low
The Temperament of every thing, as to Heat, Consistency, and amiable frame or
contexture, depends chiefly on Sulphur; from hence also for the most part arise
variety of Colors and Odors, the fairness and deformity of the Body, also the
div^^s^^y of tastes. In the Bosom of this the Spirits immediately, in which as
in a Copula, they are united, by the more hard embraces of the rest. The
substance of Sulphur, though less subtle, is yet of more firceness and
unruliness than the Spirits are, for this unless it be restrained, by the
embrace of the others, as it were in bonds, and its Particles be detained one
from another by the interjection or coming between of the rest, not only leaves
the subject, but destroys it self, with too impetuous an eruption. Indeed the
little bodies of this being gently moved, do cause digestion, and maturation,
sweetness, and many perfective qualities in things: being a little more
strongly moved, they induce heat, and an excess of qualities, inordinations,
and chiefly a stinking favor: but being more impetuously moved or stirred up,
they bring in the dissolution of Bodies, yea a flame and Burning.

The substance of Sulphur is never seen sincere, yea it consists not of it self
from others, but vanishes away into Air: its Particles being concreted and
chained together, with Salt and Earth, are fixed as it were immovable, as is
seen in Metals and some Stones: or being Diluted with Spirit and Water, and
tempered together with the rest, exist in motion, by which means (as was before
said of Spirit) they are in a threefold state, within the substance of the
mixture: for either first of all its little bodies being involved with Salt and
Earth, or too much drenched with a watery humidity, are obscured, so that they
exercise but little of virtue, from whence the humid and cold temper of things
exists, their qualities are Obtuse, Dull, and of small virtue or force, and the
Bodies less apt to be inflamed, as is discerned in unripe Fruit, raw Juices and
green Wood. Or secondly, The Particles of Sulphur begin to shine forth with
Spirit, to be more thickly heaped or rolled together, and to appear eminent
above the rest of the Principles. And so by its motion, they evaporate the
superfluous moisture, digest Crudities, and induce a warm temper in things,
active qualities, a lively force and maturation, or ripeness: which kind of
exaltation of Sulphur may be observed in Wine and Liquors long Fermented, in
ripe Fruits, in the Youth and florid Constitution of living Creatures. Or
thirdly, The Sulphurous Particles being gathered into vigor, grow too hot,
loose the bonds of mixture, and desire to fly away; and from their diverse
manner of departure and separation, the dissolution of Bodies variously
happens: For either they evaporate with Water and Spirit, by degrees, and
without tumult, and leave their subjects lean and dry, which, when the Sulphur
is wholly gone, fall into Ashes: Or secondly, in Bodis which abound with Sulphur,
when the mixture is loosned, and the Spirits begin to fly away, the remaining
Particles of Sulphur are wont to be very much moved, and to grow exceeding hot;
and being shut up in a thick substance, are gathered together more nearly, (as
in Dung and Hay growing hot) and conceive heat, and sometimes Burning: breaking
forth after this manner, by heaps, and impetuously, they breath out a stinking
smell, and bring on a rottenness to the subject. There is a third manner of
eruption, whereby the Sulphurous Particles go forth of Bodies, when they
withdraw themselves, as it were with violence, and being gathered together,
break forth into fire and flame: whereby indeed becoming unbridled and untamed,
they break all bars or lets, and wholly destroy the substance or frame of the
Subject: By this means, by their own and proper effervescency they procure a
Burning, as when they being laid up wet, or the wheels of Carts, or Axeltree,
made hot by motion do fire, or because Sulphur is inkindled by Sulphur: for
its Particles being impetuously moved, shake or move all that is near them, and
carry them into the like motion of Conflagration, as shall be more fully shown
hereafter, when we shall discourse concerning the nature of fire.

3. Salt is of a little more fixed nature, than either Spirit or Sulphur, nor
so apt to fly away; but bestows a Compaction and Solidity on things, and also
weight and duration, It retards the dissolution of Bodies, and promotes
Congelations and Coagulations, and very much resists Putrefaction, Corruption,
and Inflammation; to wit, forasmuch as it fixes the too volatile Sulphur and
Spirit, and detains them in a Body: wherefore ponderous Woods, Stones, Metals,
and what abound in Salt, are hardly enkindled, and remain a long while free
from Corruption. Not only the duration of the individual, but also the
propagation of the Species, depends very much upon the Principle of Salt,
because the fertility of the Earth, the growth of Plants, and especially the
frequent faetation, and bringing forth of young, in living Creatures, takes
their Original from the Saltish Seed: hence it is, that Venus is said to arise
from the Sea, and Lust is called Salacity. For Salt having obtained a flux,
gathers together, and stirs up into motion, the idle, or too much disjoined
little Bodies of Spirit or Sulphur, and excellently keeps them together with
itself, for the producing the first groundwork of things.

Salt within the frame of the mixture, is either altogether fixed, when its
Particles being almost destitute of Spirit and Water, but bound together with
Earth, or Sulphur, or both of them, grow into Stones, Metals, or Minerals of
another kind; which fixity in Nature is imitated in making Glass, and Earthen
Ware: or Salt is loosned from its fixedness, to wit, when its Particles being
mixed with the other Principles, and chiefly with Spirit and Sulphur, and
Diluted with Water do unfold themselves, and being diffused through the
mixture, do Ferment with the rest: whilst the little Bodies of the Salt are
after this manner put into motion, there is observed of them a threefold State
or Condition, to wit, of Fusion, Volatilisation, and Fluxation.

I call the State of Fusion, when the little Bodies of the Salt being Commixed
with the rest, begin as to their smallest parts to be dissolved, and diffused,
and explicated here and there, through the whole substance of the mixture, as
may be observed in the Germination of Plants, in the first Conceptions of
living Creatures, and in the beginnings of Fermentations; hence Spring only a
rude and indigested formation of things, an ungrateful savor, and for the most
part bitter or biting.

From these first Rudiments of Motions, the Saline Particles ascend by little
and little, to Vigor and Volatilisation, together with Spirit and Sulphur: to
wit, whereby they run through the whole substance of the Body, and variously
move its matter, and dispose it toward maturity. Some little Bodies sharpen,
and stir up into Motion, others Fix, Establish, and Congeal into a stony
hardness. If there be plenty of Spirits and Sulphur, the Particles of Salt, as
their handmaids, go about to unite, and associate themselves intimately with
them, that they are not only snatched together with them, through all the
recesses of the mixture, but (the subject being exposed to Distillation) Salt
also ascends in the Alembic, even as the Spirit. From the Volatilisation of
Salt, Beauty, and Fairness, and savor chiefly sweet, happen in things, as in
the florid blood of living Creatures, in ripe Fruits, as also in Sugar, Milk,
and Honey, we know by experience.

I mean the Fluxation of Salt, when the saline Particles, which being first
gathered together, with Earth, or Sulphur, or associated with Spirit, and so
remain separated one from another, afterward the bond of the mixtion being
loosened, they become wholly free, and unloosened from the yoke of the rest: for
so they flow together, explicate themselves through the whole frame of the
subject, and whilst Spirit and Sulphur for the most part fly away, these
exercise a dominion over the remainder, and induce a soureness into the whole
mixture: by reason of this Fluxation of Salt, Wine, Milk, Blood, and Eateable
Things, at first grateful and sweet, grow ingratefully sour when they begin to
Corrupt; and for this Reason, all Salts whatsoever, having gotten a Flux, by a
violent Distillation by Fire (that is, being driven from the Combination of
Earth) grow sour, than if the same sour Liquor, be put upon the insipid dead
Head, the Whole lastly becomes salted.

Salt being deprived of the Company of the rest, (except the Earth) becomes at
last fixed, as is observed in Sea Salt, or the incineration made of Herbs,
whose Particles so cleave together, that they cannot be pulled asunder by the
strongest Fire. When Vegetables are Distilled, some Saline Particles, though
but few, made fit for Fusion, ascend with the rest; and from thence some
Distilled Waters retain a genuine savor of the mixture: The parts of living
Creatures being exposed to Distillation, yield a Volatile Salt: when Minerals,
or ponderous Woods full of Salt, are brought under by Chemistry, the Distilled
Liquor is like to Salt that has gotten a Flux, and is very sour.

Spirit and Sulphur easily unlock the substance of the mixture, and make way
for themselves; but Salt cannot, unless it be snatched forth of doors together
with the Spirit it self. As Spirit and Sulphur being outwardly applied, in
dissolving or burning a Body, open as it were the doors for their Companions
shut within, so also, Salt Liquors Distilled, do the same thing. For Stygian
Waters strongly Corrode Metals, and are seen like a flame put to them, to burn
and consume the same.

Salt resists Inflammation, for that it detains the Sulphurous Particles in
its Bosom, and hinders them from breaking forth. But excepting that Sal Nitre
increases the burning of Sulphur, which indeed happens by accident, because
that Salt, as it were an Hermaphrodite, grows very turgid with Sulphurous
Particles also, combined in the mixture; wherefore, when the Salt is melted by
other fired Sulphur, the shut up Sulphur, breaks forth with violence, and (like
a blast from a Bellows) shakes the inkindled fire round about, and drives more
impetuously the subject into a Body: In the mean time, if yout put the flame to
Nitre, it will not be inkindled at all; but being put to a Sulphurous Body, it
promotes its enkindling; but the other Salts, less turgid with Sulphurous
Particles, or rather destitute of them, being mixed with Sulphur, hinder its
inkindling, and sometimes put it out.

So much for the Active Principles, which effect, as it were, the first
groundwork of Bodies: those which follow, chiefly bestow on them Consistency
and Substance. For from hence exist either Liquids or Solids, Small things or
Great. For Water and Earth, fill the little spaces that are empty, through the
Combination of the rest, with their coming between, and amplify and enlarge
the lineaments of the Body, otherwise too short and contracted.

4. Water is the chiefest Vehicle of Spirit and Sulphur, by whose intervention
they consociate one with another, and with Salt; for the other Principles,
being dissolved by a watery humor, or at least diluted, continue in motion,
without which they grow stiff, as congealed things.

When Water is wanting, the active Principles meet together too strictly, and
mutually rub against, and consume themselves; and when for this reason, the
suppliment of food is cut off, the Body grows withered. If humidity abounds too
much, these Elements are estranged or dissociated too much one from the other,
wherefore the subject becomes sluggish and slow, and of less efficacy, and
unapt for motion. Besides, Bodies too moist, are liable very much to rottenness
and Corruption; because from too much Humidity the Combination of Spirit, and
Sulphur, and Salt, is too loosely effected; that they do not mutually embrace
one another, nor are retained with their embracement, in the subject. Indeed
Water abounding easily evaporates, and then the frame of the mixture being
loosened, and the doors set open, Spirit and Sulphur easily break forth, the
way being made, and leave the subject, as it were vapid, or made sharp with
Salt: for from hence, the infusions of Vegitables, Decoctions, Juices of Herbs,
and all Liquid preparations, if the quantity of Water be greater than the rest
of the Principles, and improportionate, quickly Corrupt.

Water is most easily drawn forth out of every thing by Distillation, for when
Spirit and Sulphur are often entangled with nets of Salt or Earth, they hardly
let go-their embraces, and are not obedient but to a more intense heat, and
often times require a previous Putrefaction. Water most easily, and often with
no labor, is driven out of every Body. But most often it snatches in its
flying away, some more loose Particles of Spirit and Sulphur, and carries them
with itself, forth of doors.

5. As the interjection of Water in Liquids, so of Earth in Solids, fills the
empty little Spaces and Vacuities, left by the other Principles. For these,
hinder the active Principles from a too straight embrace, whereby they should
rub against themselves, and cleave one to another; also by its thickness, it
retains too Volatile things: besides, it inlarges the due substance, and
magnitude in Bodies.

The more that Earth abounds in any thing, it is so much the less active, but
of longer duration: hence Minerals endure a long while, then next the greater
Trees; in the mean time Animals, and the more slender Plants, are but of short
age.

In Distillations, Earth ascends the Alembic, almost not at all, or but in a
very little quantity: for the most part it is left, with a portion of Salt, for
a Caput Mortuum or Dead Head; therefore it is called Terra Damnata, or damned
Earth: because, when the other Principles are freed, the Prison being as it
were broken, this is still detained: besides, Earth being deprived of the
Company of the rest, is of no Use, nor capable of change, or exaltation.

Thus much for the Elements or Principles of Natural things, considered apart,
and by themselves. It follows, that some of their Affinities and Conjugations
be unfolded: because these very strictly cohere with those, and very hardly or
not at all are joined with others. Out of the mutual Combination of some, and
disagreement of others, various Affections arise, the knowledge of which gives
no little Light to the Doctrine of Fermentation.

There is a certain Kindred and Similitude of parts, between Spirit and
Sulphur, which are agil or light, and easily to be dissipated in both;
wherefore, Spirit being driven forth of the Body, draws abundantly with it
Sulphurous Particles, as is discerned in Spirituous Liquors Distilled out of
any thing; to some of which if you mingle Water, the Liquor appears as it were
troubled with precipitated Sulphur; but the Spirit without the Sulphur is
undiscernably mixed with the Water, which however by reason of is Volatility,
may be also easily drawn away and separated by Distillation.

Although Spirit and Sulphur are Principles very resembling, and (because of a
ready motion) either are inflameable, yet they are not one and the same, as is
asserted by some: For Sulphur Copiously subsists in Bodies almost destitute of
Spirit, to wit, in common Sulphur, Antimony, and other Minerals; in which its
Particles are very fixed, and of their own nature almost immovable, which is
very far from the Nature of Spirits: For they abounding in any mixture, never
lie idle, and always in motion, bring various alterations to the Subject where
they dwell; then if they abound in strength, they easily and without tumult
carry themselves forth of doors of their own accord. But Sulphur, although it
abound, does not easily evaporate, but has need of a strong heat, or an actual
fire, that may make a way for it; and lastly, it breaks forth, not without a
stink or burning: yea, if you endeavor to Distill Oily and Fat things, although
very Sulphurous, with a moderate Fire, they are wont to yield a Liquor only
Waterish, and not inflameable; but if we provoke generous Wine, which swells
with Spirit, by the gentle heat of a Bath, a most burning Water will Still
forth, and apt wholly to be inflamed.

Spirit is not presently joined with Salt: For Sugar and Salts are scarcely
dissolved, by the rectified Spirit of Wine, but are after a manner associated
by a long digestion and circulation; as is perceived in the Volatile Salt of
Animals, or Tincture drawn forth from the Salts of Herbs, or of Minerals, by
the Spirit of Wine. If that Spirits excel in plenty, and virtue, they assume to
themselves, and Volatilise the Saline Particles. And therefore the Salt
contained in the Juice or Blood of Animals, being associated with Spirit is
volatilised: also the Spirit of Wine, being Distilled by many Cohalations, with
the fixed Salt of Herbs, renders it Volatile, and makes it pass through the
Alembic; but if the power of the Salt be greater, it tames the Spirit and fixes
it. Hence the blood, being become Salt, by means of an ill diet, becomes less
Spirituous. Fixed Salts, and the Oil of Vitriol fix the Spirits, grown too
volatile, and unbridled; and Coagulate the Spirit of Wine it self.

But Sulphur is a more fit subject of the Spirit, by the coming between of
which it easily is united with Salt and the other Principles; and as Spirit
best agrees with Sulphur and Water, so Sulphur intimately cleaves to Earth and
Salt.

As to Sulphur, besides its affinity with Spirit, it has a great relation with
Salt it self, to the volatilisation of which it does not a little help:
wherefore in Bodies which abound with a volatile Salt, there is found plenty of
Sulphur, as in Amber, Soot, Horns and Bones, as also in the excrements of
living Creatures; where Salt and Sulphur are in motion, and evaporate from the
subject, a very stinking smell is sent forth; for Sulphur being sharpened with
Salt, pricks more strongly the sensory, and strikes it with its sharpness; in
the mean time, Sulphur exhaling with Spirit, both pleases the sense, and
excites a very pleasant Smell.

Sulphur is as it were distracted between Spirit and Salt, and adheres at once
to both parties. In the Distillation of Amber, Turpentine, Hartshorn, and the
like, a certain lesser part of Sulphur, being united to Spirit, first ascends,
and causes a Yellow Oil, or clear Liquor of a grateful smell: the other part of
Sulphur, being joined to the Salt, is driven forth in the second place, and is
Distilled with a most stinking smell, in the form of a red or black Oil: In
like manner, in the Circulation of the blood, a pure and delicate portion of
Sulphur, being mixed with the Spirit, supplies both the Animal and Vital Spirit
with matter; the other more thick part, being Boiled and Roasted with Salt, is
laid up in the Choledock Vessels (or belonging to Choler) as it were a certain
excrement separated from the blood. As Spirit does not easily Cohere with Salt,
so Sulphur does not with Water: wherefore Fat and Oily things, as also Gumms
and Sulphurous Refines, either swim upon the Water, or sink down to its
bottom. But Sulphurous things, Salt coming between, are commixed with a Watery
Liquor, as we see Oils imbued with Sugar or Salt, to be dissolved in common
Water, which otherwise would flow separate.

Sulphur is not so tractable in Distillation, as Spirit, Water, or Salt: for
the Particles of this, being very Viscous, stick together among themselves, and
also to others, that they cannot easily be pulled from their embrace. Hence
among Sulphurous things, there are some, which are not forced, but by a strong
and burning heat, into a stinking Oil, and very empyreumatick, or smelling of
Fire: but others, more pertinaciously cleaving together, are not to be loosened
by Distillation, but are only broken into integral parts; and so ascend under
the form of a dry Breath, as common Sulphur, Benzoin, Camphor, and the like.

Salt, besides its affinity with Sulphur, is also most strictly united with
Earth; wherefore Stones, and the more hard Minerals, consist chiefly of Salt
and Earth. The Acid Spirits of Minerals, (which are only Salts resolved into
Liquor by Distillation) if at last they be poured on the Caput Mortuum, Cohere
with a strict embrace to it, that there will be need of a most strong Fire, to
drive them forth again. Also in Glass, the union of Salt and Earth is so
strictly made, that it will not suffer a Divorce by any means. Salt also is
most easily dissolved in Water; and it melts of its own accord, in a moist Air:
and these are as easily separated one from another.

By reason of these Combinations, these Principles have got various
Appellations, and not Congruous in their own Nature to themselves. For Sulphur,
for as much as it is Associated with Spirit, is called pure and sweet; when
with Salt, impure and stinking, for as much as with Salt and Earth, it is
called thick and Earthly; when the Spirit assumes to it self Sulphurous
Particles in a moderate quantity, it is seen to be sweet; when saline, sharp;
when both, bitter. Salt has a diverse disposition, and is known by many names,
by reason of its various mixture with the other Elements, and chiefly with
Earth: for besides the Titles of Fluid, Fixed, Volatile, for this reason it is
termed Marine, Aluminous, Nitrous, Vitriolick, Armoniack, or of some other
kind. By some, these kind of Conjugations are esteemed, but wrongfully, as so
many diverse Principles, when they are but more simple mixtures, by the coming
together of the first Elements, and being loosened by Distillation they openly
show their Race, from whence they are. For all Salts whatsoever being driven
into a Flux by the Fire, show Liquors very near of Kin one to another, to wit,
Acetous: by the like means Spirit and Sulphur are compelled to put off their
Masks, and to resume the Native Species common to each.

And so much for the Principles of Natural Things, and of their Affections and
Conjunctions. It is abundantly manifest, that these kind of Substances are in
every Body, (besides the Analyzes of Bodies Chymically instituted) also from
the Mutations, and effects of Things, which happen of their own Nature. When
Must is Ripened into Wine, is not Spirit, a Sulphurous part, also Salt, and
Earth Conspicuous to our Taste and Eyes, besides the watery Liquor? Also the
Juice of every Plant being exalted by Digestion, exhibits the same sincere, and
as it were distinct: what is greater, things subject to the Flame, when they
seem to be burnt, and reduced almost to nothing, they go into these kind of
Particles; besides the Salt remaining in the Ashes, the Smoke and Flame grow
together into Soot, as it were a Meteor, in which are comprehended together,
Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water, and Earth, as it were in a certain compendium of
the mixture. For the active Principles abound in Soot, more than in any other
inanimate Body.

But because with some there has spread a certain suspicion, that those our
Princiciples, chiefly the Saline and Sulphurous, are to be produced for the
most part by Fire, and are no ways to be found in mixed things, unless after the
coming between of that: I will witness to you in some instances, that the thing
is plainly otherwise. Concerning the first, It is commonly known, that the
Ashes of every Plant, being once Elixivated, or made into a Lie, if it be
afterward Calcined, will not yield any thing of Salt; besides if Concretes
being Distilled, Exhale or Breath forth a very sharp or acid Liquor, their Calx
is not saltish; and on the contrary when the Salt being Volatilized or brought
to a Flux, ascends the Alembic, you shall seek for it in vain in the dead head.
To prove the existency of the Sulphurous Principle in Vegetables, take
Guaiacum, or a piece of any other ponderous Wood, and being put into a Glass
Retort, draw it forth by degrees; it shall exhibit, together with an Acid
Liquor (which water is saltish) in great quantity, a blackish Oil (which part
of it is Sulphurous.) It appears from hence that this was in the Body before
the Distilling, and in no wise produced by its Operation, because if you
proceed after another manner, that the Sulphur may be taken out of the Concrete
before Distillation, the Liquor that comes forth will be almost wholly deprived
of its Oyliness: Wherefore, if you pour Spirit of Wine to those Chips of Wood,
it will Extract in a great quantity, by this Menstruum, a pure Refine, which is
the Sulphurous part it self: then if you Distill (as before) in a Retort, the
remaining Chips being washed in common Water and dried, you will have a very
little Oil only. What is more to be admired, and confirms also more fully the
truth of this kind of Origination, some Bodies, which being almost destitute of
Spirit and Sulphur (because chiefly Volatile) consist chiefly of Salt, Earth
and Water, are separated into these Elements by Distillation: the same mixture
in number, and wholly known by the same accidents, is restored to them, being
mingled together again; for example, if you Distill Vitriol in a Reverberating
Furnace, you shall have a Phlegm almost insipid, or a Watery part, then a
Liquor very sour, or a Salt having gotten a Flux, and in the bottom, a Red
Earth, and finely Purpled: this being rightly performed, if the two Distilled
Liquors be poured to the dead head, you shall have the same Vitriol, as you had
before, and again revived, in the same Color, taste, yea and almost in weight.
In like manner you may proceed, with the same success, with Nitre, Sea Salt,
Salt of Tartar, and perhaps with Alum and other Minerals: So that those
Concretes, which consist of fixed, and stable Elements, may like a Mechanic
Engine be pulled into pieces, and presently without hurting the Machine, be
restored or made whole. But there is enough spoken concerning the Principles of
Natural Bodies. These being thus premised, we will proceed to the thing
proposed in the beginning, to wit, the Doctrine of Fermentation.

CHAP. III. What Fermentation is: Its Division as to the Subjects, and first of
Minerals.
FErmentation is an intestine motion of Particles, or the principles of every
Body, either tending to the perfection of the same Body, or because of its
change into another. For the Elementary Particles being stirred up into motion,
either of their own accord or Nature, or occasionally, do wonderful more
themselves, and are moved; do lay hold of and obvolve one another: the subtle
and more active, unfold themselves on every side, and endeavor to fly away;
which notwithstanding being entangled, by others more thick, are detained in
their flying away. Again, the more thick themselves, are very much brought
under, by the endeavor and Expansion of the more Subtle, and are attenuated,
until each of them being brought to their height and exaltations, they either
frame the due perfection in the subject, or complete the alterations and
mutations designed by Nature.

Fermentation is an action or motion merely Natural, and what does perform it,
are only Particles Naturally implanted in the Concrete; yet as to the subjects
in which they are found, it is wont to be variously distinguished. And either
things of Nature are said to Ferment in a threefold Family, of Minerals,
Vegetables and Animals; or the Works of Art, to wit, when Actives are applied
to Passives by an outward Agent. Though the Term and consideration of
Fermentation, are chiefly due to Artificial things, and things made by Hand;
yet it will not be from the purpose, to speak first something of Natural Things,
that a Comparison being made of either, the Truth of our Hypothesis, and the
certainty of the Principles may be confirmed. But this only lightly and by the
way, in this place I shall pass over, because their more full handling belongs
to Physiology, or the Discourse of Natural or Physical Things.

In the first place, as to Minerals, although in the Bowels of the Earth, the
Fermentation is less conspicuous than in the Superficies, yet it easily appears
that the Elementary Particles, or the Fermentative Principles, are included in
the depth of the Earth, as in a certain pregnant Womb: which there constitute
Concretes, and things gathered together, by strict Embraces, the Productions of
Minerals; but being loosned, and moved in the Bosom of the Earth, or exhaled
upwards, cause the appearances of Meteors.

First, The Generation of the more hard Minerals, induces rather Congelation
than Fermentation; because indeed these Principles, growing together in every
Subject, are so fixed, and as it were bound together in Bonds, that they are
not able any ways to move themselves, or to depart one from another. This kind
of Fixation chiefly depends on the plenty and greater proportion of Salt and
Earth, (sometimes with an addition of Sulphur) than there is of Spirit or Water,
To wit, Salt and Earth, being most smally broken, and resolved even into a
Vapor, lay hold of one another, and stiffen into a hard matter, and at last
not to be loosned; almost after the same manner as making of Glass, and the
burning of Bricks and Earthen Ware, are performed. For Glass consists of Salt
and Earth, which when being broken into most small bits by a very intense Fire,
they suffer a Flux, they mutually lay hold of one another, and so strictly and
intimately come together, that they are never to be parted. Glass is more
fragil, or easy to be broken, than Earthen Pots, or Minerals, because it has a
greater plenty of Salt, than of Earth, which is more plentiful in Earthen Ware,
and in Minerals: To some of which, also happens a modicum of Sulphur, and for
that reason they are more tenacious and ductil; as is to be observed in Metals,
when in the mean time stones, and what contain little of Sulphur, are fragil,
and apt by every stroke, to fly to pieces. In Vitrification there is need of a
violent Fire, for the fusion of the Salt and the Earth, (whose Particles, as is
commonly said, are the Pestles of the Chemists) but within the Bowels of the
Earth, there is not required such a fusion by Fire, for the Concretion of
Minerals, because Salt and Sulphur exist, being naturally resolved into most
simple Particles; which, when they lay hold on the Earth, easily stiffen into
Metal, or into a stony hardness. There are some Fountains found out, which, for
that they flow with a Primitive Salt, and resolved into small Particles, what
ever Bodies are immersed therein, they cause them presently to become stony. We
have read also, of Men changed into Stones, yea a whole City to have been
stiffned into a stony substance, by the Air, or by some Vapor brought forth of
the Earth: The Faith of which thing is left to the Authors.

Meteors are made out of the same Principles by which Minerals are made, and
conceived almost in the same Womb: but loosned from Concretion wandering here
and there, and diversely fluctuating: or which being included in Subterraneous
Vaults, and there moved, produce diverse Springings up of Fountains, or
ebullitions of hot Vapors; or exhaling from the Dens of the Earth, and being
mixed with Airy little Bodies, they cause within the Region of the Atmo-Sphear,
as it were a diverse fashioned Landscape, of Clouds, Winds, and the appearances
of other things, in the Superficies of the Earth, or on high: in either there
are highly active Principles, chiefly Salt and Sulphur. Spirits are either
deficient in Meteors, even as in Minerals, or are found only in a very small
quantity or proportion: to wit, they are almost wholly excluded from these, by
reason of the strict frame of the Subject, which does not easily yield space,
and passage for their motion; also they abstain from those ( viz. Meteors) by
reason of the lax, and wholly loose structure of Matter, from whence they, who
are mighty in swiftness, easily break forth, and desire to fly away.

Within the Bosom of the Earth, the Saline Particles being loosned, even into
a Vapor, and then kneaded with an Earthy Matter or the moistning of Waters,
they cause Eruptions of Fountains, and Acidulous or Spaw Waters, which resemble
the disposition of Vitriol, Alum, Nitre, sometimes of Iron or Copper. Also the
Sulphurous little Bodies being loosned, and gathered together, inkindle an
Heat, and sometimes Subterraneous Fires; by whose Breaths the Dens and Caverns
being made Hot, like an Hot-House, whilst the Watery humors pass through them,
they from thence conceive their Heat, and supply the Springs of Hot Fountains
for Bathes.

In like manner, in this visible and Etherial world, Vapors both Sulphurous
and Saline, and of a diverse Kind and Nature, perpetually breath forth, and are
diffused through the whole Region of Air. From hence the diversity of winds,
the vicissitudes of Cold and Heat, Rain, Snow, Hail, Dew, and Hoar Frost, and
what are of this Nature, have their Origin. Concerning the particular
instances of these, the famous Gassendus may be consulted, who in his Epicurean
Philosophy, most aptly deduces the Phenomenon, almost of all Meteors, and the
reasons of them, from the Exhalations of Sulphur, and Salts, either Nitrous,
Vitriolick, Aluminous or Armoniack.

CHAP. IV. Of Fermentation for as much as is observed in Vegetables.
IN Vegetables, Fermentation is yet more plainly discerned: for whilst they Bud
forth, Grow, Flower, bear Fruit, Ripen, Decline and Dye, we may observe the
diverse motions of Particles or Principles, their various Habits and Tempers. I
intend not here to describe the several ways and proceedings of these. It will
be sufficient, for the unfolding the Doctrine of Fermentation, to take notice
of some chief instances, concerning this Subject.

If is manifest, by daily Experience, that all Plants whatsoever, exposed to a
Spagyrical or Chemical Operation, may with little labor, be resolved into the
aforesaid five-fold Elements: But in some there is found a greater plenty of
Salt, in others of Sulphur; in some Spirits abound: Water, and Earth, are in
most proportionated, according to the Bulk and magnitude of the thing. Plants
in which Salt abounds, with a mean of Sulphur, and a little quantity of
Spirits, are for the most part of long Age, somewhat big, or flourish all the
Winter, or tho their Leaves fall, they keep a Nutricious Juice under the Bark.
Of which sort are the Oak, Ash, Elm, Box-Tree, and all ponderous Woods and
Shrubs.

In some Sulphur abounds, with a little Salt and Spirit, as are the Pine, the
Firr-Tree, Cyprus Tree, Juniper, Ivy, Olive, Cedar, and Myrtle Trees, and all
resinous Plants; which, for the most part have a sweet smell, and are
perpetually Green, by reason the juice, wherewith they are nourished, is
viscous, and not easily to be dissipated. In others, besides plenty of Salt,
and Sulphur, Spirits also are found, in a greater proportion, as are
Fruit-bearing Trees, and especially the Vine, from whose Fruit the Juice being
wrung out, and purified by Fermentation, grows very big with Spirit. Of this
rank are Plants for the most part Medicinal, also such as produce Curious, and
Odoriferous Flowers, But in some Water and Earth luxuriat in too great a
quantity above the other Elements, as in cold Plants, and such as grow in too
rank a Soil.

The Germination of Plants happens after this manner, either it is made out of
the Seed, Root, Trunk, or of its own Nature, from the naked matrix of the
Earth. First, the Spirit being shut up within, by the Ambient Heat and Moisture
loosening the frame of the mixture, being loosned, it presently endeavors to
fly away: But being held back in its flight, by the more thick Particles of the
rest, stretches forth more largely its Den, and together with the other
Principles, with which it is bound, thrusts forth on every side, into length
and breadth: even as a little bundle of Silk, being contracted into wrincles
and folds, is opened here and there: In the mean time, the little Spaces left
by the enlargement of the Spirit, and as it were made hollow, are filled up by
the next Matter, driven even into the Vacuities. And after this manner the
Architect Spirit, with his Ministers, Salt and Sulphur, still stretching forth
it self, like a Snail, frames for it self an House, whose Inhabitant it is, and
by dilating it self, stretches forth that, until at last it has wrought the
Plant into the due Bulk and Figure designed by Nature.

You may take notice, that the times of the year, for the Budding, Flowring,
Ripening, and decaying of Vegetables, are of great Efficacy and Virtue: All the
Winter, the Womb of the Earth, as it were shut up, is almost barren: for the
Spirituous Particles, which are wont to actuate the rest, and as it were to
lead the dance of Natural Motions, are either chased away by the Winters Cold,
or being Congealed in their Subjects, are fixed: Wherefore at this time
Germination and Vegetation are very rare, unless that some irregular Plants,
which are composed of plenty of Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, dare to break forth.
But in the Spring, when the bowels of the Earth begin to be a little warm, by
the Vicinity of the Sun, presently they are impregnated with a wonderful
Fecundity, and produce the effects of their Seminality. Not only the
Superficies of the Earth, but also the Water and Air, every where, grow big
with Spirituous Particles; which as it were raise up from the Dead, the little
Bodies of Salt, and Sulphur, and bring them into Motion: Therefore, besides
that the Plants Bud, the Juice and Blood of living Creatures is quicker and
more apt to abound. At this time the Birds and Fishes build their Nests, and
bring forth Eggs: also we may perceive in our selves the Blood to flow high in
the Vessels, and usually to Ferment too much. For all things are then full of
this Aetherial Substance, and the whole Bulk of Nature, as it were inspired by
a lively Fermentation, is abundantly fruitful of Motions and Generations. Yea,
these our Principles, at first separated and dispersed one from another, led as
it were by an Appetite of Copulation, enter into mutual Marriages, and being
Married together, almost with infinite Embraces, cause a most ample Seeding, and
Germination of the Herby State.

At the beginning of the Summer, (and perhaps in some sooner in some later)
when sufficient time has been granted for the Stature and Magnitude of every
Plant, and that it is now come to the highth of increase; it behooves Nature to
perfect her Work, and to cook and ripen the Substance, as yet rude and
undigested: Wherefore the active Principles leisurely extricate themselves from
the more thick, and creep forward toward the top, there being placed with a
mutual increase, they are formed into Flowers and Blossoms, from which at
length (for that they are of a soft and light texture) Spirit and Sulphur
easily evaporate, and the frame of the mixture quickly decays. But Nature
careful of the perpetuating every thing, when it cannot keep for ever the
individuum, is so provident, that the Species may not wholly perish: Wherefore
she institutes new and more firm and lasting Combinations of Spirit, Salt and
Sulphur. For she selects from the whole Substance of the Plant, the more noble
and highly active Particles, and these being gathered together, with a little
Earth and Water, she forms in the Seed, as it were the quintessences of every
Plant; in the mean time the Trunk, Leaves, Stalks, and the other Members of the
Plant, being almost quite deprived of the active Principles, are much
depauperated, and are of less Efficacy and Virtue.

About Autumn, after the Seeds are framed, (as it were pledges left in memory
of the Plant) the Particles of Spirits, Salt and Sulphur, which remain, being
now placed in their Strength or Exaltation, endeavor a Dissolution, and
Departing one from another. And first of all, the Spirits evaporate by degrees
with the Watery humor, through the Doors set open by the Summer Sun, with
which the more pure parts of the Sulphur, make also their Journey: in the mean
time the Salt being fixed with the Earth, and more thick Sulphur, is left
behind: Wherefore in most the Leaves fall at this time, and in those of a
tender and light Constitution, the Principles are wholly dissipated, and the
Trunk and Stalk, together with the Root, wholly die. In some, after the falling
of the Seed, with the Leaves, the Stalks wither; in the mean time the
Principles, which may renew the Plant in the next Spring, are preserved in the
Root.

Also Winter coming on, the face of things is wholly changed; and the Elements,
which in the Spring did affect to be Joined and to Marry one with another, seek
nothing more than Divorces. The Spirits fly away from very many things, and
wander in the Air; in the mean time the Particles of Salt and Sulphur lie as it
were benumbed and asleep. Not only the Bodies of Vegetables, but of very many
Animals, are left as it were dead all the Winter, till they are raised again to
life by the Spirit, returning with the Vernal Sun, and as it were animated
anew. But this little Branch being made concerning the Vegetation of Plants, it
is now fit that we proceed on our Journey to Fermentation, by the Rule of our
before established Method, to what is to be observed, concerning the parts, and
humors of Living Creatures.

CHAP. V. Of things to be Observed of Fermentation about Animals.
IT is so certain that the Bodies of Animals, consist of the aforesaid
Principles, that it wants no proof. For they so plentifully swell up, with
Spirit, Salt and Sulphur, that their Particles are obvious to the sense:
Wherefore they are moved with a more swift motion, and more excellent senses of
Life, and Functions of Heat, in the Subjects, in which they are implanted, are
enlarged. It would be too much labor, and tedious, here to describe, the
several manners and processes of Fermentations. The first beginnings of Life
proceed from the Spirit Fermenting in the Heart, as it were in a certain little
punct. The motion of this, is not as in Vegetables, slow and insensible, and
only to be known by their increasing; but presently becoming rapid, is
conspicuous to the Eyes: because the Spirit leaping from the Punct, as from a
Prison, being stirred, and having obtained the Vehicle of Blood, swiftly runs
forth; and leaping forth, it cannot wholly fly away, it makes hollow spaces for
it self in the thick substance, in which it is included, for its excursion,
being compelled some other way backward. Lastly being returned to the Heart, it
Ferments the more, wherefore it stretches forth further the spaces of its
Excursion, and so easily makes an hollow way for its return back; and after
this manner, for the carrying about the Blood, Arteries and Veins, as Channels
and Rivulets are framed through all the parts of the Body: and on such a
Vicissitude of Motion, or Reciprocation, depends the life of living Creatures,
which, that Nature might preserve a long while, she placed the Ferment in the
Heart, by whose instinct, or endeavor, the Blood grows impetuously Hot, and as
it were inkindled into a Flame by its Deflagration, diffuses the effluvia of
its Heat round about on every side: for by the Fermentation, or Accension which
the Blood suffers in the Bosom of the Heart, very many Particles of Spirit,
Salt and Sulphur, endeavor to break forth from its loosened frame: by which
being much rarefied, and like Water boiling over a Fire, the moved and boiling
Blood is carried through the Vessels, not without great Tumult and Turgescency.
We would speak more in this place, both of the Natural Fermentation of the
Blood, and the Feverish, but that we reserve this Consideration for a peculiar
Tract, where we Treat of Fevers.

Besides this Ferment constituted in the Chimny of the Heart, upon which the
motion and heat of the Blood very much depends, there are others laid up every
where in the Bowels, of a diverse disposition, by the help of which, both the
Chyle (which is the Rudiment or Beginning of the Blood) and the Animal Spirits,
its Quintessence, are truly framed. There are others also which serve for the
perfecting the Blood, transmuting it into other Liquors, and freeing it from
Excrementitious Matter: It will be too far from our proposed method, to wander,
to insist upon each of these, and to reap another Harvest: Wherefore I will
only add in this place, some select instances, which may illustrate the
Doctrine of Fermentation.

It is commonly received, that the Concoction of the Chyle, in the Ventricle,
is made by the means of a certain Acid Ferment: That such a thing is the Acid
belching in a full Stomach, and the want of it in the loss of Stomach, in
Feverish and Dysenterical people do testify, etc. and its restitution a sign
of Health: to which may be added this Observation; Chalybeat Medicines being
taken at the Mouth, a little after excite a Sulfureous savor in the Throat, as
if hard roasted Eggs had been eaten: which seems wholly to be made by the Acid
Ferment of the Ventricle, gnawing the Iron, even as Spirit of Vitriol, being
sprinkled upon the fileings of Steel, excites such a stinking and Sulphurous
Odor. Some say this Ferment is breathed into the Stomach from the Spleen, but
by what means that may be done does not yet appear by Anatomical Observation.
It seems not improbable that this Ferment is implanted in the Ventricle, that
it is only made by some remains of the perfected Chyle, which fixed in the
folds of the Ventricle. and there growing sour, puts on the Nature of Ferment;
even as a portion of Dough being fermented or levened, and and kept to a
sowrness, becomes a convenient Ferment or Leven, for the making of Bread. In
like manner this kind of Acid humor being prepared from the Aliments, and long
carried in the Ventricle, promotes the Concoction, and subaction or subduing of
the Food. For Acid things, which are full of Salt, carried out to a Flux,
excellently conduce both to the Fermenting and Dissolving of Bodies: Wherefore
by the action of this, Salt and Sulphur, with which eatable things very much
abound, are broken in the Ventricle, and are reduced into very small parts. The
Chyle being after this manner Fermented, acquires a Milky color, by reason
that the Sulphurous Particles are dissolved together with the Saline, and
mixed with the Acid Ferment. For if you pour an Acetous humor to any Liquor
impregnated with Sulphur and volatile Salt, it presently grows white like Milk;
as may be discerned in the preparing the Milk of Sulphur, or the Resinous
extracts of Vegetables. Yea, the Spirits of Hearts Horn, or Soot, being very
full of Volatile Salt, if they be poured to any Acid Liquor, or simple Water,
acquire a Milky color.

Concerning this Ferment hid in the folds of the Ventricle, it is observed that
it is after various manners, and changes the Aliments by a diverse means: for
tho in a sound Constitution it is indifferently Acid, and chiefly owes its
force and energie to the Salt being brought to a Flux; yet it often declines
from this laudable condition, and conteins in it self either too much of
sowrness, or less than it ought to have: In the former Case, where the Salt
has got too sour a Dominion, all things taken in, (the Saline Particles being
carried forth to a Flux, and the rest unduly brought under) presently grow
sour: as most often happens in Hypochondriack Distempers: on the other side,
where the Volatile Principles obtain the first place, (Fermentation being too
hastily made) the Sulphurous parts of the Chyle are suddenly, and as it were
forceably exalted; and the unconcocted of the Saline, pass into Choler: which
ordinarily happens to those abounding with bitter Choler. They therefore who
have the Ventricle affected after this latter manner, Sweet and Fat meats being
eaten, they are troubled with a bitter and bilious Taste: Again, they who
suffer the contrary disposition, although they eat the most simple Food, send
forth plentifully Acid and Stinking belchings: and indeed this seems to come to
pass even after the same manner, as when a little too much Yest is put to the
Batch of Dough, it becomes bitter; or when too great a Portion of sour Ferment,
or Leven is put to the same Dough, the Bread from thence contracts a mighty
sowrness.

As the Blood in the Heart, and appending Vessels, the Chyle in the Ventricle,
so the Animal Spirit is wrought in the Brain, whose Original and Motions are
very much in the dark. Neither does it plainly appear, as to the Animal Spirit,
by what workman it is prepared, nor by what Channels it is carried, at a
distance, quicker than the twinkling of an Eye. But it seems to me that the
Brain with Scull over it, and the appending Nerves, represent the little Head
or Glassie Alembic, with a Sponge laid upon it, as we use to do for the highly
rectifying of the Spirit of Wine: for truly the Blood when Rarefied by Heat, is
carried from the Chimny of the Heart, to the Head, even as the Spirit of Wine
boiling in the Cucurbit, and being resolved into Vapor, is elevated into the
Alembick; where the Sponge covering all the opening of the Hole, only transmits
or suffers to pass through the more penetrating and very subtle Spirits, and
carries them to the snout of the Alembick: in the mean time, the more thick
Particles, are stayed, and hindered from passing. Not unlike this manner, the
blood being delated into the Head, its spirituous, volatile, and subtle
Particles, being restrained within by the Skull, and its menynges, as by an
Alembick, are drunk up by the spungy substance of the Brain, and there being
made more noble or excellent, are derived into the Nerves, as so many snouts
hanging to it. In the mean time the more crass or thick Particles of the blood,
being hindered from entering, are carried back by Circulation: But the highly
agil and subtle Spirits enter the smallest and scarcely at all open pores of
the Brain and Nerves, and run through them with a wonderful swiftness: For
there is need only of such Receptacles and Channels, for the Animal Spirit, in
which there are none, or at least very small cavities or holes; otherwise the
blood or excrementitious humors, their Followers and Companions would not be
excluded. Also, besides, if these Spirits should run about through too open and
loose spaces, being easily dissipated, they would fly away: wherefore, when
there is need of a Pipe for the transmitting of blood, or serous water, the
Spirit of Wine runs rapidly through the secret passages of the Instrument or
Leather. Neither does the more strict frame of the Brain and Nerves serve only
for the straining of the subtle from the thick, and the pure from the impure;
but also that spirituous and most subtle Liquor, being as it were distilled
from the blood, gets yet a farther perfection in the Brain; for there being
inspired by a certain Ferment, whereby it is yet more volatilised, it is made
more fit for the performing the offices of motion and sense. Because the
substance of the Brain is exceeding full of a Volatile Salt, which is of great
Virtue for the sharpning and subtilising the Spirits; therefore the Spirits of
Hearts Horn, or of Soot, are far more penetrating than Spirits of Wine.

The Seminal Vessels and Genital Parts, do so swell up with Fermentative
Particles, that there is nothing more: here Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, being
together compacted, and highly exalted, seem in the Seed to be reduced as it
were into a most noble Elixir. These kind of active Principles do not only
Ferment in the Womb, for the forming of the Child or Young ones, but also as it
were with a living Ferment, they inspire through all the Body, the whole Mass
of blood, that it may be more Volatile, and more sharply Hot: wherefore in
women who have the Ferment of the Womb in good order, their Face is furnished
with a curious and flourishing color, their heat is more lively and copious;
moreover, the Mass of Blood growing too rank, there is need of emptying it
every Month by the Flux of their Courses; but when this Fermentation from the
Womb is wanting, both Virgins and Women become Pale, and as it were without
blood, short winded, and unfit for any motion. Also in men, from the Seminal
Ferment, happen abundance of heat, great strength, a sounding Voice, and a
manly eruption of Beard and Hair; by reason of the defect of this, men grow
womanish, to wit, a small Voice, weak Heat, and want of Beard are caused.

Since we Treat of Ferments, which are found in the Animal Body, we may here
opportunely inquire, what is the use of the Spleen: concerning which all good
things are said by some; that it is as it were another Liver, and serves for
the making of blood, for the Viscera of the lower Belly: It is by others
reputed to be of a most vile use; that it is only the Sink or Jakes, into which
the Feculencies of the blood are cast. By reason of its structure, we make this
sort of conjecture; because the Arteries, do carry the blood to this, and the
Veins bring it away, neither any other thing is carried in, or conveyed out,
and for that its substance is filled with black, and stagnating blood, it seems
that it is as it were a storehouse for the receiving of the earthy and muddy
part of the blood: which afterward, being exalted into the Nature of a
Ferment, is carried back to the blood for the heating of it: Wherefore, while
the blood being carried by the Arteries enters the Spleen, something is drawn
from it, to wit, the muddy and terrestrial Particles, which are as it were the
dregs, and Caput Mortuum of the blood; that by this means the whole Mass of the
Blood, might be freed from the Melancholic or Atrabilous Juice; which is
separated in the Spleen, even as the yellow Bile or Choler, is in the Liver:
wherefore, for the most part the Spleen is of a black or bluish color, by
reason of the Feculencies or dregs there laid up. But as this Juice deposited
in the Milt or Spleen, is not altogether unprofitable, but by reason of the
plenty of fixed Salt, is of a very Fermenting Nature; it is not presently, as
the Choler, cast into the sink, but is farther Cooked in the Spleen, and being
exalted goes into a Ferment; which being lastly committed to the blood,
promotes its motion and Volatilisation: Wherefore, as something is drawn from
the blood, entering the Spleen by the Arteries, to wit, the Crude Juice of
Melancholy; so something is continually added to the same, flowing back through
the Veins, to wit, the same Juice concocted and exalted into the Nature of a
Ferment: Even as Chemists, in Distilling, that the Liquor may be made better,
separate the Subtle and Spirituous parts, from the Caput Mortuum, and then
pour them on it again; and this work they so often repeat, till the Caput
Mortuum or dead Head, is by frequent Distillation Volatized, and the Liquor
rightly exalted, even in all its Particles. That this is the use of the Spleen,
it is a sign, for that this inward being ill affected, the blood either
ferments too much, as in the Scorbutic and Hypochondriack Distempers; or if
the Spleen be obstructed, or beset with a Scirrhous Tumor, the blood is
destitute of fit Fermentation, and causes the Dropsy, Cachexie or evil
disposition of the Body, or the Tympany.

As we assert, the Earth and muddy part of the blood, which consists chiefly of
Earth and fixed Salt, being separated in the Spleen, to pass there into a
Ferment; so it seems not improbable, that also the Adust, or as it were the
fiery part of the blood, to wit, the Yellow Bile, which consists chiefly of
Salt and Sulphur, being separated in the Liver, and from thence transmitted to
the intestines, serves for some use of Fermentation. For this being mixed with
the Chyme or Juice, fallen from the Ventricle to the intestines, makes it there
to grow hot and to swell up; whereby both the Elementary Particles are more
overcome, and by reason of the Rarification or swelling up, the purer part is
wrung forth into the Milky Vessels, for the Nutritious Juice.

We are not only born and nourished by the means of Ferments; but we also die:
Every Disease acts its Tragedies by the strength of some Ferment. For either
the Sulphurous and Spirituous part of the blood, being too much carried forth,
boils up immoderately in the Vessels, like Wine growing hot, and from thence
Fevers of a diverse kind and nature are inkindled: or sometimes the Saline part
of the blood, being too much carried forth, suffers a Flux; and from thence it
being made acid, austere, and sometimes sharp, is apt for various Coagulations:
from which the Scurvy, Dropsy, Stone, Leprosy, and very many Chronical
Diseases arise.

Yea we also endeavor the Cure of Diseases by the help of Fermentation: For to
the preserving or recovering the Health of man, the business of a Physician and
a Vintner, is almost the same: the blood and humors even as Wine, ought to be
kept in an equal temper and motion of Fermentation: wherefore when the blood
grows too hot, even as Wine, it is usual to empty some out of the Vessels, and
to allay its Fervor with temperat things. If any extraneous or heterogeneous
thing, is mixed with it, unless growing hot of its own accord, it drives it
forth of doors; Purging, Vomiting, and Sweating Medicines, by shaking and
fusing the blood and humors, promote its seclusion: when that the blood is
depauperated, and grows less hot than it should do, Cardiacks, Digestives, and
especially Chalybeats or steeled Medicines restore its vigor and Fermentation:
no otherwise than Wines growing sour or degenerating into a deadness or want of
strength, are mixed with more rich Lees, whereby they may Purge or grow turgid
anew. I could easily unfold the Curatory intentions, as also the effects and
operations of every Medicine, according to the Doctrine of Fermentation; but I
design a particular meditation for this thing: for the perfecting of which
serious work, God willing, I have determined to add to the business of
Medicine, as I hope, something not unprofitable.

Having thus far wandered in the spacious field of Nature, we have beheld all
things full of Fermentation; not only in the distinct Provinces of Minerals,
Vegetables and Animals, do we discern the motions and effects of this, but also
the whole Sublunary world, seems as if one and the same substance were planted,
and very pregnant through the whole with Fermentative Particles; which in every
Region and Corner of it, as little Emmits in a Molehill, are busied in
perpetual motion and agitation; they fly about here and there; sometimes
upwards, sometimes downward they are hurried, they variously meet one another,
associate themselves, and again depart asunder; with a continual Vicissitude
they enter into diverse Marriages, and suffer Divorces, on which the beginnings,
the death, and transmutations of things depend. These little Bodies do not only
very much abound in the bosom of the Earth, or in the midst of the waters, but
they are especially diffused through the whole Atmosphear of the Air in thick
heaps. It is sufficient that I have noted in this place, some examples in a
word: I have not determined a more full speculation of them here. It is time
that we proceed from Physical things, to the works of Art.

CHAP. VI. Of Fermentation, as it is performed in Artificial things.
IN the works of Art, so various and manifold provision of Fermentation is
perceived, that it is altogether impossible to enumerate their several Species;
or to reduce the diverse instances of this to certain Classes or Heads of
distribution. Making use of the third of the following method, we will subjoyn
some examples, (which have happened to our observation) by whose rule, many
others may be laid open.

Concerning Fermentation, which is made in the Subjects, made by hand, or human
industry, these three things are chiefly to be considered.

First, of what Nature and Composition Bodies are, that are most fit for
Fermentation, and which are less convenient for it. Secondly, What things are
requisite about Fermentation, to wit, what are wont to promote, or also to
hinder its motion in every Subject. Thirdly, How manifold the motion of
Fermentation is, and the end of it; also what are the effects and alterations
which follow it.
As to the first, That all Bodies, (when tending to perfection) may truly
Ferment, they are required,

In the first place, That there be some parts loose and disjoined; otherwise
the Fermentative Particles will not be stretched forth, or move from place to
place: Wherefore in the more hard compacted things, or in viscous things, or
too much boiled, or evaporated to a spissitude or dryness, Fermentation does
not succeed. What are Liquid, as Wine, Beer, the Juices of Fruits and Herbs,
easily and quickly swell up; next to these what are soft, tho they are of a
thicker Consistency, as Bread, and most Eatable things, and Medicinal
Compositions.

Secondly, It is required that there be an Heterogeneity of parts, or a
confusion of all the Principles together; to wit, that some Particles do oppose
others, and stir them into motion. For the more simple Bodies, in which one, or
at most two Elements only are strong, with a very small proportion of the rest,
are unapt to Ferment: because like Particles, or Symbolical Elements, lie
benumed and quiet. But between the unlike, there arises presently a strife for
domination, and some provoke others into motion.

Thirdly, There is a third condition, that there be neither too much Crudity,
nor Maturity of parts, in the body Fermenting. In the former, the active and
subtle Particles, are not easily extricated from the more thick, nor are
brought into motion: as it appears in Juices, which are pressed forth from
unripe Fruit; also in Beer which is made of Barley or Malt, not come forth or
germinated. In the latter the Particles being made too volatile, are not
contained in the bond of the mixture, but presently evaporate, and dispose
their Subjects to Putrefaction. Wherefore, Juice expressed from Summer Fruits,
or others too ripe, will not easily pass into Wine, but it will quickly
corrupt. And for this reason, extravasated blood, milk, and urine, do not
Ferment, but quickly putrify.

As to the second thing proposed, there are many ways by which Fermentation is
either promoted or hindered. The first and chiefest, is the adding of a certain
Ferment to the body Fermenting; the Particles of which, when being first placed
in vigor and motion, may raise up the others, idle and sluggish, in the
to-be-fermented Mass, and may drive them into motion. But there is a twofold
Ferment; either absolute, which is the same kind of Body, in which the active
Particles, being altogether placed in their vigor, are notably in motion, and
so whilst they are committed to the Subject in Fermenting, snatch with them
into motion other Particles there of the every kind before sluggish: by this
means Barm or Yest, beaten Eggs, and such like, stir up a Fermentation almost
in every thing. Or the Ferment is respective, to wit, which consists of
Particles, very much of one kind, which meeting other of another kind, in the
Mass to be Fermented, grow hot with them, and so produce in the mixture a
turgency or rising up of all the parts together. After this manner Saline
Particles having gotten a Flux, grow very hot, with other Salines, either fixed
or alchalisate; as appears when acetous Liquors are poured on Corrals, Hearts
Horn, shells of Fishes; also when the Spirit of Vitriol, and the Salt of
Tartar, are put together, a great ebullition is excited.

There are some accidents and external circumstances, which variously conduce,
either to the provoking or hindering the motion of Fermentation; of which sort,
are chiefly the condition of the Ambient Air, the placing or laying up of the
body Fermenting, and the means of conserving it.

The Southern Air (in which hot and humid Particles every where abound, which
also entering easily any Bodies, obtain the force and place of a Ferment)
impresses a notable motion of Fermentation in very many things: Wherefore in
drinkable Liquors, it does not only raise up at first, the force of
effervescency or growing hot, but also for a long while after induces new
swellings up in them being Fermented. On the contrary, the Cold and Northern
Air, binds up, and very much fastens Bodies; and in very many things hinders
the fusions, and flowings of the Elements, and oftentimes, either hinders
Fermentation from being stirred up, or restrains it being begun. Also the hot
Summer Air, because it too much moves the active Principles, drives away the
Spirits and subtle parts, exalts the Saline, and Sulphurous into a Flux, and
so perverts their equal motion; and either the Sulphur or Salt being too much
carried forth, it easily brings to Bodies a rancidness or putrefaction, or a
mouldiness; which nothing favors the business of Fermentation.

It is a vulgar opinion, that some select times of the year, to wit, those in
which the Vegetables of every Kind flower, cause anew the motion of
Fermentation in the Juices, and other things prepared of them, after they had
Fermented a long time before; so that Beer, when the Barley, and Wines in the
time that the Vine, flowers, conceive risings up, or new Fermentations: they
say also, that Bread and Flour, when the Wheat is in Flower, is want to become
sooner musty and moldy: also that spots or stains of the Juices of Fruits, as
the Mulberry, Blackberry, Rasberry, and such like, being in Clothes, are wont
to be gotten forth again, at that time when those Fruits are Ripe. Concerning
these things, I ingenuously confess, that I have not made trial of them, by my
own proper observation; so as to dare to affirm it for truth in every part: I
will therefore lightly pass them over, for it would both grieve and shame me
(lest I should relate false things) to Philosophize concerning doubtful things.

Concerning the laying up of the Fermenting Body, these things are chiefly to
be observed. When things first being to Ferment, that they are not to be shut
up in too close Vessels, neither while the Liquors are hot, are they to be put
into Bottles or Casks. For the Particles, at first boiling up, and as it were
rarefied, desire a very large space: wherefore the Fermentation of Wine or
Beer, is begun in open large Vessels: but when they grow less hot, those kind
of Liquors, lest the Particles being set and moved into motion, too much,
should fly away from the Subject, they are kept best, either in a cold Cellar,
or close Vessels. In the preparation of Vinegar, we observe the contrary, to
wit, it is wont to be placed in a hot place near the Chimney or Oven, or
exposed to the Suns beams: to the end that the vinous Spirit being depressed,
the Saline part might be exalted into a Flux, and so might give a sharpness to
the Liquor. There is another observation, that Liquors do Ferment better in
wooden Vessels, than in Glass, or Stone: For by long infusion, some Saline
little Bodies are got forth of the Wood, especially the Oaken, which promote
Fermentation.

As to the third thing proposed, concerning this thing; although to speak
properly, the motion of Fermentation, is only a carrying forth of the
Principles confused together, from a state of Crudity toward maturity; and the
end of it, is a tendency to the perfection of every thing: yet use or custom
has obtained, that this word is attributed to very many other motions of
Natural things, and includes other ends, and effects, far different. Therefore
when the Fermentative Particles in any Body, are greatly in motion, the
alterations which follow thereupon, may be in some respect referred to these
three Classes.

First, it either respects the exaltation, and perfection of the parts of the
same Body; or the resolution, and corruption of them.

Secondly, Or the dissolution of the parts of another Body is intended; or the
praecipitation of those loosened.

Thirdly, By the motion and action of these kind of Principles, a coagulation,
and also a congelation, now of the same Parts, now of different Bodies, are
induced. It remains, that we briefly run through every one of these Species of
Natural Motions, and ways or manners of Fermentation.

CHAP. VII. Of Fermentation, as it is seen in the exaltation of Bodies, and
tendency to Perfection.
THE Exaltation of the parts, is perceived best in Works, or in all things
appointed for human use, forasmuch as they get a greater perfection and vigor,
by Fermentation; as, chiefly Aliments and Medicines do: in many of these, we
endeavor to carry forth the Spirituous Particles above the rest; and so to
procure in the mixture, a grateful sweet taste, and other agreeable qualities;
as we may observe in Bread, Beer, Wine, Cider, and many others: But in some, we
strive to exalt the Saline part, the Spirit being somewhat depressed; as in
Vinegar, Mead, Broths, also in Sauce, Pickle, or in Preserved things, which
are made of Salt and sharp Liquors. We rarely on purpose carry forth the
Sulphurous part above the rest, for from thence a stinking smell, and
ungrateful rammishness, are wont to happen to eatable things. Among foods set
apart for man's use, Bread, Beer, Wine, and Cider, have the first place; which
owe mostly, whatever they have of virtue, or strength, to Fermentation.

Concerning the making of Bread, these things are chiefly to be observed: the
Meal of Wheat, or Barley, or of any other Grain, being kneaded with
common-water, is reduced to a mass, to be afterward baked in an Oven. If there
be nothing else added to this, it becomes forthwith heavy, and ponderous like
Clay, clammy, and of an ungrateful taste, and of difficult digestion: but if in
the kneading it, there be added a Ferment, the Mass presently grows hot, the
bulk swells, and afterward being baked, it is made light, spongy, of good
digestion and grateful to the taste. If you desire to know the reason of the
difference, it is this. The meat of the Grain is imbued with a moderate
proportion of Spirits, also of Salt, and Sulphur; but the Particles of these,
are overwhelmed in the Mass, with a viscous humidity, being kneaded with water;
so that they move not themselves mutually, nor are in motion: wherefore in the
baking, some superfluous humidity evaporates; what remains is cleaving,
viscous, and becomes pressed close like Clay, and ponderous. But when a Ferment
is mingled with the Mealy Mass, the active Particles of the Ferment being first
stirred up into motion, take hold of their Companions in the Mealy Mass, and
carry them with them into motion. By this means, whilst some move others, they
shortly are all stirred up into Fermentation; tumultuating here and there, they
compass and run through the whole Past or Dough, they subtilise and attenuate
the clammy and terrene parts, and they lift up the mass, with the motion, and
make it hollow, with little holes; which yet in the mean time, lest it become
too spungy, and whereby the parts made hollow, and attenuated might more
exactly be mixed, it is wrought with long kneading, then afterward, before the
Fermentation ceases, and before the hollowed parts sink close down, it is baked
in the Oven. In the baking, the superfluous moisture evaporates, and moreover,
very many Particles of Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, fly away; wherefore, the mass
becomes lighter, and less ponderous, in the mean time, those which remain in
the Bread, being much exalted, and brought to maturity, cause in it a laudable
consistency, with a grateful smell, and taste.

The Ferment commonly used, is a portion of the Mealy Mass, and unbaked, which
is kept, being imbued with Salt, to a sowrness (it is called in French Levain,
because it lifts up the Mass) or the flowring of Beer, or Ale, called Yest or
Barm; or for want of these the lees or dregs of Beer, or beaten Eggs, are made
use of. In the mealy Ferment, the Saline Particles having gotten a Flux, do
chiefly predominate; as also in the faeces of Beer: wherefore the Bread
Fermented by these, is made harsh and somewhat sour: In the mean time, Yest
being very big with Spirit, Ferments the Bread more potently, and brings to the
Mass lightness, and a very grateful sweetness. Beaten Eggs abound with Spirit
and a Volatile Salt, and do yet more cause the Bread to Ferment, and render it
more Spongy: without doubt there may be other kinds of Ferments used; for
whatever are big and turgid with Spirit, or abound with Salt carried out to a
Flux, seem to be fit enough for this use.

Sometimes the mealy Mass is kneaded with Sulphurous matter, as Butter, Sewet,
Fat, or such like, which being baked in an Oven, while it is hot, it is seen to
be light and spongy, (to wit while the Sulphurous Particles, are kept in
motion by the heat contracted in the Oven) afterward, when this Mass grows
cold, it becomes heavy, weighty, and very close: to wit, the ascititious heat
being exhaled, the Sulphurous Particles, before carried forth, at length sink
down; and when the Particles of the rest, not being excited into motion, the
Mass therefore becomes as it were Infermentated: For in these kind of Subjects
the Sulphurous Particles, because they are very viscous, hinder the motion of
the rest, nor can they themselves persist in motion, longer than they are
forced, by the actual heat.

Bread is sometimes made of the flower of Wheat, or Barley, that is Germinated or
Maulted, which without any Ferment added to it, becomes so exceeding hot, that
it cannot be contained in a compacted mass, but that in the baking it spreads
abroad: the reason of which is, in such Flower, by the Maulting it, the active
Principles are before placed in their vigor, and exaltation; wherefore in the
kneaded Mass, when they are urged, by the heat of the Oven, they run forth
inordinately, and force the more thick parts, hindering them, and as it were
fling them down headlong. We have said enough of making Bread; we will now
pass to Beer.

Beer is made of Malt or Barley, germinated and dried, which is performed after
this manner: First, the Barley is put into common water for three days, that it
may intumifie or swell, then (the water being let out from it) it is flung in a
heap upon a dry floor, moving it twice or thrice a day, lest it grow too hot,
until it begins to germinate, or bud forth, or put out little shoots of Roots.
Afterward, by frequent casting it about, it is hindered from germinating or
springing forth any farther, and lastly, being laid upon a Kiln, it is made
dry by rosting it; by this means, it yields a meat wonderfully sweet.

The reason of this kind of process is this; the Barley is permitted to spring
forth, that its active Principles might be brought or set into their strength,
or exaltation: for when it germinates, the Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, at first
asleep, and sluggish, do swell up or grow big together, and their sluggishness
being cast off, they are prepared to exercise their powers. The other
preparations, hinder the Barley from germinating further, lest that its
Principles being very much loosned, should exhale too much, and fly away from
the Subject. The Meal of the Barley thus prepared grows sweet, because the
active Principles are set in exaltation like Fruit brought to a maturity:
wherefore also the Liquor impregnated with this Meal, grows very turgid or big
with Spirituous and Fermentative Particles; when the simple decoction of Barley,
scarce Ferments at all, nor is kept long, but that it becomes musty, and
insipid.

But Beer is made after this manner; upon the Meal of the Barley, prepared as
above said, boiled water is poured, and is suffered to be macerated, or mashed,
for some hours, that it may be sufficiently impregnated with the active
Particles of the germinating Barley, now placed in their vigor: This Liquor
being satisfied or filled, is drawn off clear from its settling, and is lastly
boiled, that it might get a something more thick consistency, and be able to be
kept the longer: Then, when it is somewhat cold, it is Fermented, a Ferment, or
the flowring of Beer or Yest, being put thereto, and so tuned up in a Barrel.
Concerning its Fermentation, these things are especial worthy of observation.

If it macerate with, or stand too long on, the Maulted Meal, the Liquor
becomes thick and clammy; and afterward will hardly Ferment or Work at all:
the reason of this is, because the active Principles, in this work, are of a
prompt motion, and move together with them, the earthy Particles; with which,
if by a long stay, the passages and pores of the Liquor are filled; being too
full, they are wholly obstructed, and as the contents in the Stomach, stuffed
to a surfeit, scarcely Ferment at all.

If too hot, or too cold, the Liquor be put into the Barrel; as in the great
heat of the Summer, or the cold in the Winter, Fermentation does not rightly
succeed: for by too much heat, the Particles are dissipated one from another,
that they cannot, mutually take hold of one another, and so work; by too much
cold, they are bound up and fixed, that they scarce enter into motion, neither
perform it strongly.

When the Liquor of the Beer Ferments in the Vat, the active Principles do on
every side explicate themselves, they precipitate in the bottom the more thick,
and Earthy, being partly driven as it were into flight, and partly sticking to
them, they lead them as it were Captive to the top, and there make hollow
bubbles continually growing up, and bring them as it were to servitude. After a
due Fermentation, the whole space of the Liquor is rendered clear and without
dregs, in which the Spirits with a little Salt and Sulphur, do abound; in the
mean time, in the settlement or dregs, a little of Spirit and Sulphur, with a
greater plenty of Salt and Earth remains. So long as these shall be in their
places the Liquor will be clear, sweet, and Spirituous, but if long kept, or
not shut up closely in a Barrel, great part of the Spirits will fly away: in
the mean time, by the defect of these, the Saline Particles being exalted, and
having gotten a Flux, impregnate the whole Liquor, and make it sour; for when
Beer, as also Wine, goes into Vinegar, it does not happen because they are
wholly deprived of Spirits, (for so they would degenerate into a tastless
thing) but because the Tartareous or Saline parts, are carried forth to a Flux,
and infect the Liquor with their sharpness; in the mean time, the Spirits being
less in power, are depressed, that they cannot resist them. Very hot weather,
Thunder, the noise of great Guns, or the tunning it in the open Air, suddenly
makes Beer grow sour, for by these means the Spirits being disturbed in their
equal motion, are dissipated; and in the mean time, the Saline or Tartarous
parts, being before separated, and depressed, are moved, and carried forth into
a Flux.

Indeed it plainly appears that the Spirituous parts in Vinegar, are not wholly
destroyed, but suppressed only whilst the Saline are placed in a Flux; because
from Vinegar, may be Distilled, a Liquor exceeding hot and burning, like the
Spirit of Wine, after this manner: With the Distilled Vinegar, a Salt is
extracted from Minium, or Lead Calcined, of which you have plenty, and shall
distill it in a Retort, the Vinous and burning Spirit is driven into the
Receiver; the reason of which is, because when the Saline Particles of the
Vinegar are united with the Salt of the Lead, the Vinous Spirits yet remaining
are then freed; and having obtained their own right, they are urged from their
lurking places by the heat of the Fire: but those Spirits are not produced from
the Lead, because if you give thereto a more vehement Fire, the Salt of the
Lead, will be melted into a Metal.

But we will return to Beer, from whence we have digressed; to which, how great
a perfection happens, by Fermentation, appears by this experiment. If you take
Beer new made, not yet purged by Fermentation, and place it to be Distilled in
a Bladder or Cucurbit; only a vapid or tastless water ascends, without any
Spirits, and strength at all: but if you proceed after the same manner with
Beer truly Fermented, you will have a hot water, and highly Spirituous. And
this takes away the objection of some, who say that water being even
impregnated with the Meal of Malt, should not be any more boiled, lest the
Spirits should exhale; because the Spirits, before Fermentation, are so
obvolved with the more thick Particles of the rest, that they cannot break
forth from the Concrete.

The more the Beer is impregnated by the Malt, the stronger it is, keeps the
longer without sowring; which is helped if Hops be boiled therein, from which at
first it grows bitter, but afterward recovers a grateful sweetness; the reason
of this is because the pores of Liquor, which are empty of the Particles of the
Meal, when they are possessed by those of the Hops, the consistency is made
more compact, and is more full of Fermentative Particles; wherefore there is
not quickly given any room for the Flux of the Salt. But that the Liquor being
at first bitter, afterward grows sweet, happens for this reason; because the
Spirituous and Sulphurous parts, supplied by the Meal of the Malt, come not
so soon to Maturity, because of the others mixed with them from the hops being
boiled therein: but when this happens, that they grow to maturity, they easily
excel all the others, and impart a sweetness to the whole. Not only Hops being
boiled in Beer, keep it long from sowring, but also many other bitter, or sharp
things, do the same: for these, forasmuch as they exceed in a Volatile Salt,
hinder the flowings of other Salt; wherefore, some are wont to put into the
Barrel, a piece of Sassafrass Wood, the tops of Wormwood, Broom, the Firr-Tree,
the rinds of Oringes, also Spices in a small quantity; by which means, the
Drink, tho of a smaller substance, is kept a long while from sowring. Thus much
concerning the preparation of Beer, on the consideration of which, (as also of
Bread) we have stayed long, because the word Fermentation is chiefly due to
these. Let us pass next to Wines.

Excepting the Blood of Animals, there are no Liquors that grow hot, like
Wines; there is found in none a greater plenty of Spirits, Salt, and Sulphur,
or a more remarkable turgescency, or swelling up. The Fermentation of Wines,
and the handling of them Fermenting, are wont to be taught among the Vintners
or Wine-Coopers, as a secret only to their Apprentices, or the Adepti of their
Art. Among them there is delivered a certain Physical Science, or Method of
Medicine, by which means, the impurities of Wines are purged forth, their heats
attempered, or also their defect, or sickness may be healed. There are many
ways to be used, besides that of sophisticating, as a secret, by which
depauperated and tastless Wines are sold for sound and rich. But as to our
proposition, that the Doctrine of Fermentation might be illustrated, these
three things ought chiefly to be considered, concerning Wines: First, Their
defaecation or cleaning, and their going into parts. Secondly, Their immoderate
effervescency or growing hot, from what causes it is wont to be stirred up, and
by what means to be suppressed. Thirdly, The declination of them, when they
grow worse: and by what remedies they are kept that they do not quickly pass
into a tastlesness or Vinegar.

1. As to First, That Fermentation may begin in the Must, there is not (as in
Beer) required, the putting to any Ferment, for the Juice being expressed from
the Grapes, does so greatly swell up with active Particles or Principles, that
it presently of its own accord, grows remarkably hot: but it is a usual thing
in some regions, when the Grapes are trod, to besprinkle them with Quick Lime,
by the provoking of which, as a Ferment, the Liquor pressed forth, grows more
fervent, and is sooner purged. The Must or new Wine, is at first put into open
Tubs, for that they cannot be contained in close Vessels, for their great heat
or working, which so boyls up, that water over a Fire grows not more hot: when
the Wine is a little cooler it is put into more close Vessels, in which it is
further purged by Fermenting. In the purifying, the Spirituous and Subtle
Particles greatly shake the more thick dregs, and dismiss them from themselves
on every side, that the Mass of the Vinous Liquor, being made free from the
mixture of the dregs, is rendered clear and without dregs. The Faeces or Lees of
the Wine consist of Salt and Sulphur, with a little Spirit and plenty of Earth;
which whilst the Wines grow hot, being separated by degrees, either by
Coagulating themselves mutually, are affixed to the sides of the Vessels under
the Species of Tartar, or like Lees or Mother, settle to the bottom. In the
mean time the Liquor swimming over them, is very clear and exceeding Spirituous.

Sometimes the defecation or clearing of Wines is hardly brought about, as a
Vinous Liquor is not easily freed from the mixture of Tartar: wherefore
Vintners are wont to put to the Wines some Bodies that either clear them, or
precipitate them, so as the Earthy matter swimming in them, may sooner settle
to the bottom: The things which so clarify Wines are of two sorts: for they
have either viscous parts, as Glue, the Whites of Eggs and such like, which
stick close to the faeculencies of the Wine with laying fast hold on them, and
carry them with themselves toward the bottom: Or else they abound in a
precipitatory strength, which while they enter into the pores of the Liquor,
thrust forth the more thick Particles from thence, and strike them down to the
bottom; as are the dust of Alabaster, Calcined Flints, and such like.

2. Wines tho at first they were well cleared, yet afterward they conceive
immoderate effervescencies, so that the Tartar, being stirred up from the
bottom, it at length mingled with them; also the Spirits being loosened, now
the Sulphurous Particles, now the Saline being too much carried forth, render
the Wines unsavory, clammy or sour. We will consider these things, from what
Causes they come to be so, and by what means they are Cured.

Wines very often contract heats, when they are full of Tartar or too rich
Lees: For Tartar or Lees, tho separated from the Liquor of the Wine, and
depressed to the bottom of the Vessel, yet for that they consist of plenty of
Salt and Sulphur, they still send from themselves Fermentative Particles, by
the inspiration of which the Wine is kept in an equal motion of Fermentation:
and as the Wines are leasurely ripened, so the Salt and Sulphur which lurk in
the Tartar, are by little and little exalted; until at length, being carried
forth to a Flux, they infect the Vinous Liquor, with a troubled feces or dregs,
and compel it to grow immoderately hot, and to boil up. Against these too great
heats of Wines, there is a necessity, that they be presently drawn off or
racked, from this too rich Lees, and put into another Vessel, or else it comes
to pass, by reason of its too great disturbance, the Sulphur being very much
exalted, that they become unsavory and ropy; or the Spirit being lost, and the
Salt carried forth to a Flux, they contract a sowrness, and turn to Vinegar.

Neither does Wine grow more hot than it should do, only from Tartar, or too
rich Lees, but by too great agitation, immoderate heat, or by an extraneous or
strange Body put to it, and not miscible, or that cannot mingle with it: for by
these and other ways, the Sulphurous part of the Wine grows hot, and from
thence conceives a fervor, and undue boiling up; for the settling of which,
besides the racking or drawing it off, from one Vessel into another, they use
to pour plenty of Milk, into the Pipe or Barrel, by whose mixture the heats and
tumults of the Wines are presently appeased; but as by this means the Spirits
of the Wine are very much overcome, it cannot keep long, but soon after
degenerates to Vinegar, or without taste; therefore the Vintners are
necessitated to sell presently the Wines mended by this Artifice, and very
suddenly to draw them off.

These kind of heats of Wines, tho they be timely appeased, before they wholly
spoil the Wines, yet they leave some viciousness, by which the Vinous Liquor is
altered from its due color and consistency, and is made less grateful to the
Palate: for Wines made hot, oftentimes become of a more deep color, viz. they
degenerate from a watery and clear color, to a Citron or Red, and give to the
taste a rankness; all which indeed proceed, from the Sulphur being too much
carried forth and exalted: For these kind of distempers of Wines, they proceed
after this manner; for the mending the color, oftentimes simple Milk, or
boiled with Glue or fine Flour, is poured into the Hogshead or Pipe; for these
procure a certain separation of the exalted Sulphur, and with its whiteness
give a clearness, or restore the color to a brightness. Mucilaginous, clammy,
or ropy Wines, are amended by the infusion of burnt Alum, quick Lime, Gypsum or
Plaster of Walls, Salt and the like; for these cause a new Fermentation, that
the more thick Particles are thrust forth from the rest, and precipitated
toward the bottom. The unsavouryness is helped by the same means.

3. As to the third proposition; Wines are depauperated or made poor, when by a
long effervescency the Spirit and more pure Sulphur, being exhaled, the Saline
Particles begin to be exalted: in this case their languishing strength is
sustained with certain remedies, as it were Cordials.

As the Spirit and Sulphur being too much carried forth, and exalted, is cured
by the drawing off the Wines from the rich Lees: So the same being depressed,
the remedy is that they be put to a more rich Tartar or Lees: wherefore the
Vintners, are wont to pour the depauperated Wines, destitute of plenty of
Spirits and Sulphur, and which begin to grow sour, by reason of the Salts being
carried forth to sound and fresh Lees or Tartar; that they might as it were
anew inspired with Spirit and Sulphur, ferment and recover new strength and
vigor, besides they make Syrups of generous and rich Wines, with Sugar and
Spices, which they pour among the stale and deadish Wines. Further, for Wines
turning to Vinegar, they are said to administer profitably, some other
remedies. Gratarolus praises with many more, Lard and Swines flesh salted,
wrapped in Linen, and put into the Cask: and truly it is probable that the
Sulphurous odor of this does restrain the Flux of the sowring Salt; for this
end the same Author commends Leek-Seed, Pine-Nuts, blanched Wheat, boiled Wine,
Ashes, the shavings of Willow, and many others, for the Salt readily acts on
these kind of Subjects, and spends its force; even as Virgins sick of the
Green Sickness, desire greedily to eat such like absurd things, that may
satisfy the extraneous, and for the most part sowrish Ferment of the
Ventricle, but very hurtful to themselves. There remains another kind of Cure,
whereby small Wines almost corrupted, and growing vapid or smachless, recover
new vigor for a time, to wit, a portion of Rhenish Wine, or others, very
Fermentable, is laid up, and hindered from Fermenting, from whence it is made a
perpetual Must (commonly called Stum) if a little of this Liquor be poured into
a Cask of stale Wine, and jogged together, it gives a fresh, and new
Fermentation to the whole: so that that Wine will froth and boil, and shut in a
Glass will leap forth; but the drink mended by this Artifice, is accounted very
unwholsom, for that it is apt to stir up an immoderate Fermentation in our
blood: wherefore it is prohibited by Edict, that the Wine-Coopers or Vintners
make not use of this kind of Sophistication.

It is a usual thing also, to stop up close, in Stone or Glass Bottles, for a
time, small Wines, and new Ale or Beer, which being afterward opened, the
Liquor ferments so impetuously, that being almost all rarefied into froth, it
flies forth of the Bottles: which besides contracts such an acrimony or sharp
cutting, that it can scarce be swallowed: The reason of which (as it seems) is
this: The turgency or swelling up, and the notable acetosity, sharpness, or
quickness of these kind of Liquors, proceeds chiefly from the Salt being
exalted, and having gotten a Flux; for when as the Liquor, being full of much
Tartar and little Spirit, is shut up close in a Vessel, all the Particles
together are forced to be fermented, and when they cannot be separated, and fly
away from one another, they do the more trouble one another, and break
themselves into small bits; that by this means the bond of the mixture may be
wholly broken; but the little bodies loosened one from another, and as it were
freed by reason of the closeness of the Vessel, are forced together: wherefore
when the Vessel is opened, all the Particles at once being ready for flight,
like Air suddenly rarefied, break forth with noise and tumult; and because the
Saline parts having gotten a Flux, by reason of the plenty of Tartar, are
stronger than the Spirit and Sulphur, from thence the notable cutting sharpness
is caused in the Liquor.

Cider comes next to the Nature of Wine, to wit, of the smaller sort, which
kind of Liquor, is only the Juice pressed from Apples, and brought to maturity
by Fermentation: concerning this kind of Drink, it is worth observation, that
if it be made of Summer Fruit, or too much ripened, it will not keep in
strength, but presently degenerates into a deadness: but if it be prepared of
very unripe, and sour Apples, it contracts a bitterness, for that the Spirits
do not sufficiently arise in this, but give place to the Salt, having first
gotten a Flux: but in the other, they are not long enough retained, but wholly
fly away, before the mass of the Liquor attains to full Fermentation: but there
are Fruits and Apples, exceeding fit for this business, which being endued with
a more firm consistency, are not quickly corrupted, neither do they attain
their perfect maturity or softness, but of a long time: The Juice of these
wrung forth, and put into a Cask, does not grow hot, as Beer, with a great
frothy head, but after the manner of Wines, with a noise, like a Pot boiling
over the Fire: whilst Fermenting after this manner, it is made clear, the more
light recrements, are carried upwards, and remain in the Superficies, as the
flowering: but the more thick parts and Tartarous settle plentifully in the
bottom; but the more solid Crust, or Coagulated Tartar, is not fixed to the
sides of the Vessel: which is a sign Cider is a more wholesome Drink, nor so
infestous to the nervous stock, because it abounds less with a sharp Salt than
small Wines. The Liquor swimming over these Faeces or Lees settling in the
bottom, enjoys it as it were its food, and is kept by its inspiration in
strength; from which, if it chance to be drawn forth, it quickly grows sour:
for indeed this kind of Drink, is in great danger to be destroyed by the Flux,
or sowrness of the Salt: against this ill, to preserve it, some are wont to
cast into the Cask Mustard Seed bruised, or Mustard Balls, for that the
Volatile Salt of this hinders the Flux of the acetous Salt, so that the Liquor
thereby presently grows clear, and keeps the longer: another kind of remedy
against the sowrness of Cider, is, that as soon as it begins to grow sour, it
be drawn off from its Lees, and kept in close stopped Bottles, with a little
Sugar; for by this means it ferments anew, and because, together with the Flux
of the Salt, the Spirits being carried forth, are detained from flight, a very
grateful sharpness is caused to the whole Liquor. Also, almost by the same
preparation, and the like process of Fermentation, a potable Liquor is made out
of Pears, which is however above measure sweet, and if plentifully drunk,
renders the Belly loose, as if they had taken Physic.

So much for Fermenting Liquors, whose virtue consists in the Spirit being
carried forth, and obtaining the height of perfection: there remains other
preparations, whose vigor is placed in the Saline part being exalted, and
having gotten a Flux; among these, Vinegar is of chiefest note, the way of
making of which, being wholly unlike the aforementioned, requires a method of
Fermentation, very different from those before described: for example, small
Wines, or more generous or strong Beer, being put up into the Cask, are exposed
in the Summer time, for a long while to the Suns Beams, or else in the Winter,
they are kept near a Stove in some hot place; after this manner, whilst some
Spirits evaporate, the rest being put under the yoke, the Saline parts are
exalted and infect the whole Mass of the Liquor with their sharpness: but not
only Wines long kept, or Stale Beer, out of which the Spirits of their own
accord, begin to go away, but fresh Must, or new Beer, pass after this manner
into Vinegar; for the Country-women are wont to place without doors all the
Summer, strong Ale, and highly impregnated with Malt, in a Cask, by which
means they make an exceeding biting and most penetrating Vinegar.

Yea after the same manner almost, our kind of Hydromels, Honnied Drink, or
Mead are wont to be prepared: to wit, they boil sixteen parts of Water with
one part of Honey, to the consumption of a third part, adding then some Spices,
togegether with a sharp Ferment, they place the Cask and Liquor for many days
in the Sun, and afterward in a Wine-Cellar. It seems the Sunning of it is
used, that thereby the Saline parts being brought toward a Flux, might somewhat
restrain the nauseous sweetness of the Honey: and by that means the sweet being
tempered with sharpness, a most pleasing taste is afforded to this Drink.

By reason of the sharpness arising from the Flux of the Salt, also very many
eatable things are wont to be prepared after various manners; hence the flesh
of living Creatures, and especially of Fishes when they swell with too much
Sulphur, are pickled with Salt Brine or sharp Liquors, that the Salt being
brought forth, they may become more grateful to the Stomach. It would be a
tedious business to insist here on particulars; but I will in this place
describe a certain noted kind of Oaten Broth, Grewel, or Flumery, which
profitably nourishes Feverish, also Consumptive and Hectic people.

This kind of Drink, that it may become gratefully sowrish, the Meal of Oats is
put into common water for about three days, till it acquire a somewhat sour
taste: then, this infusion is placed upon the fire, and with a Ladle is stirred
about until it boyls, and when it rises up ready to flow over the Vessel, it
must then be poured forth into a platter, and presently cooled; it will appear
like Gelly, and may be cut into bits; which if heated soon melts. In this
preparation may be observed, that by a long infusion of the Grain, the Saline
parts being brought forth, do get a Flux; then these so impregnate the Liquor
that the more thick Particles being by the heat brought into its pores and
passages, they are so strictly shut up, that they cannot easily sink down, but
that the whole mixture becomes like Gelly.

It would also be too great labor to heap together here, the various Condites
and kinds of Pickles, for it would be to describe under that rank the whole Art
of Cooking and Diet. For in both the only aim is, that for healths sake and for
pleasure, the active Particles in our food, may be placed in their vigor and
exaltation; for so they greatly please the Palate, and by a more easy
digestion go into nourishment: for this reason, not only Drinks, and
Confections of Corn, and Herbs of a diverse nature and kind are thought on; but
also we variously prepare flesh, both boiled and roasted, and add to them
sauces, that the Particles, now the Spiritous, now the Saline, being carried
forth to a Flux, might please the taste, with a certain sharpness. Those which
are of a more fixed nature, are brought to exaltation, by Sauces made of Sugar,
Salt, or Pepper. They are wont to keep some flesh almost to putrefaction, that
by that means, the active Particles being placed in their strength and motion,
may become of a more grateful taste. Here might be interwoven, a long discourse
concerning Medicinal Compositions, but because this subject, deserves a
peculiar consideration, I will say nothing more of it here. Let us next see by
what motion of Fermentation and Habitude of Principles, Natural Bodies tend
toward dissolution; or what is the progress of every thing to Putrefaction and
Corruption.

CHAP. VIII. Of the motion of Fermentation, which is observed in the Death,
also in the Putrefaction and Corruption of Bodies.
NAtural Bodies in which Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, are found in but a mean
quantity, do not stay long in the same state: for these active Principles are
employed perpetually in motion: As soon as they come together, they tend from
Crudity and Confusion toward Perfection, for the sake of which, when they have
reached the height, they are able to come to, they are not quiet in this point;
but from thence they make have toward the dissolution of that thing. Those
which are more volatile do first of all break forth from the loosened bond of
the mixture; then the rest separate into parts, until the form of the mixture
wholly perishes: The Spirit being carried forth to the top, flies away first
with the water, and the more pure Sulphur, and by its expiration, diffuses a
very grateful odor; afterward the more thick Sulphur, with the Salt, being
loosened from the band wherewith they were tied, and having gotten a Flux, by
degrees evaporate, and together disperse a very stinking smell: together with
these, the watery parts flow forth, and the frame of the subject breaks, or
falls down into Earth or a Caput Mortuum.

This kind of process may be observed both in natural things, and also in
Subjects prepared by Art: Concerning Natural things, the disjunction of the
Elements, and their separation into parts, may be seen both in the death of
living Bodies, or the extinction of life and vegetation; and also in the
corruption of them being dead, and in their reduction to a rottenness.

As in Vegetables, the growth and maturity depend on the combination and mutual
cleaving together of the Principles, so the decay and death depend on their
going asunder, and separation, in Plants and Fruits; being by degrees exalted
from a crude and sour Juice by Spirit and Sulphur, they come to maturity; to
which a sweet taste and smell, and a pleasant color happen: then presently the
same matter, the Spirit and Sulphur, and the rest of the Elements leisurely
flying away from the subject, is soon reduced to a filthiness and rottenness:
If after the subtle and more pure Particles of Spirits and Sulphur are flown
away, there still remain plenty of Earth and Salt, with some Sulphur, the
matter does not putrify, but grows dry with an hoariness: but if the thick
Salt and Sulphur, having gotten a Flux, break forth from the Subject, together
with the rest, the bond of the mixture being loosened, presently the external
humidity, possesses the spaces left by these, and the Body is resolved into
rottenness.

Also all Animals whatsoever, have set bounds of their growth and duration: For
they ascend from their beginning, by slow increase, to motion and sensation;
then to the strength and exaltation of Nature: in which point they stay not,
but from thence, by equal steps, make have toward their fall.

If the cause of this kind of limitation be required, we say that Mother Nature
has placed in the primigenious seed of every thing, such a stock of Spirit,
Salt and Sulphur, which might suffice for the producing the utmost thrids or
lineaments of Bodies: so that the growth and ascent of the thing, to its height
or acme is only an evolution, or unrowling of that radical matter, and
protension or stretching it self forth into a greater dimension; in the mean
time the little spaces and vacuities, which are made by the protraction of this
matter, are filled up by the active Particles, supplied by Nutrition, which
also by a continual series of motion are ripened, exhaled, and give place to
others succeeding. As soon as this seminal matter is unfolded and exalted to
the height, that it cannot be moved, or expanded further, the matter is then
brought to the state of its perfection: from thence some Particles of this
Radical substance, together with the secondary supplied from the Nourishment,
begin to evaporate; and others daily, and then others, being after this manner
consumed, both the solid parts, by degrees decrease in their substance, as also
the Nutritious Juice and Blood, even decline for the worse, till by a long
wasting, the props of the Body, are made dry or withered, and the blood so
depauperated, that it will not suffice for sustenance to the vital fire: just
as it may be perceived in a Lamp, if the Oil being continually consumed, in its
place be put water, the Liquor is rendered poor, and diluted, that it is not
able any longer, to cherish at all the flame of the wick.

When the Life of Animals perishes, (either it expires after the aforesaid
manner leisurely, and like a Candle or Lamp is extinguished, the Oil or Tallow
being consumed; or it is choked by a hasty death, being snatched away by Fate,
or the violence of a Disease) presently the Spirits, with Salt and Sulphur,
flowing together in the blood; and also planted in every part, cease from their
regular motion, and are moved into confusion: then they partly exhale from the
pores, with the vanishing heat, and partly being shut up within in the
Cavities, inordinately Ferment, with the remaining Particles, and make a
swelling up of the inwards, and of the whole Body. But afterward the frame of
the solid parts being by degrees loosened, and the Sulphurous Particles,
together with the Saline, having gotten a Flux, begin to evaporate; from thence
a strong stink and corruption arise. The active Principles, breaking forth by
heaps, do often mutually take hold of one another, and being combined in the
superficies of the Carcass, produce Worms: at length when they are wholly
exhaled from the Subject, what remains falls into dust.

It is a usual thing for Worms to be generated in Vinegar when it is corrupted
and lost its strength, which being exceeding small; and somewhat long and smooth
like Eels, swim in the Liquor, and may by the help of Glass be exposed to our
Eyes; these being seen, it is commonly said, that the sharpness and pricking
of the Vinegar proceeds from these little Creatures, which is a vain thought
that deserves not a refutation; for they are only to be found in dead Vinegar;
and I pray from whence have they their teeth sufficient for the gnawing of
Iron? But the whole corrosive force of Vinegar is more truly referred to the
Salt having gotten a Flux: in the mean time those little Creatures seem to be
begotten by this means; it is sufficiently known, that when very many Subjects
are brought to putrefaction, the active Principles being thrust out of doors,
yet still affecting their old dwelling, remain somwhere about the
neighborhood, and being joined together, do often produce living Bodies;
wherefore, when moist things putrify, most often little Worms grow on their
Superficies; but in Vinegar the business is a little different, to wit, because
the Elementary Particles are more fixed, therefore when the mixture of the
Liquor is wholly dissolved, the active Principles, although loosened, yet
breaking very hardly and difficultly from the substance, meet together in the
bowels of the Subject, and there mutually cherishing one another, cause those
little Creatures in the midst of the waters.

Also the Bodies of living Creatures, being prepared for our Food, are disposed
toward putrefaction, if they are put up for some days, till the active
Particles are loosened, and begin to be in motion, tending to exhalation;
wherefore both the Flesh becomes more flaccid, and in eating more tender and
soft: and if they are kept longer, till the Saline and Sulphurous parts being
carried forth into a Flux, do break out, presently a stinking smell and
putrefaction is induced.

There are many ways whereby flesh is wont to be kept from putrefaction; the
chief of which are, that it be pickled with Salt or Spices. Things are kept a
long time incorrupt and very grateful to the taste, with Salt: Dead Carkases are
imbued with Spices, that they may remain a long while in their Sepulchers. As
to the first, Brine or salt Pickle hinders the eruption of the Sulphur, and
fixes it in the Subject by its embracement, and retains it. Spices, as they
consist of very active Principles, stir up a new Ferment in the Subject, the
dead Carcass; and the implanted Elements of this, join into the society of
their motion, and retain many of their Particles flying away, yet longer in the
Body: As Salt and Spices are made use of for the preserving long flesh, and
Sulphurous things, (which also preserve all other things from Putrefaction) so
Vegetables, and their Flowers and Fruits are better conserved with Sugar: for
this by cherishing the active Particles of the Subject, restrains them within,
and besides, renders the Confections, of a very grateful taste.

Minerals, chiefly the solid and hard, because they are endued with plenty of
Salt and Earth, with little of Sulphur, and with a less quantity of Spirits,
therefore they rarely, or not at all conceive Putrefaction: there is the same
reason for resinous things, which tho they abound in Sulphur, with Salt and
Earth, yet because there is but a small portion of Water and Spirits, therefore
their frame is not easily loosened, neither are they obnoxious to Putrefaction.
Among Minerals, Common-water only, falls under this rank: for this, if it stand
still, or is kept long in a Vessel, its Salt and Sulphur, though but in a
little quantity, having gotten a Flux, begin to evaporate, and together to
induce Putrefaction: but so long as water is in motion, these Particles are
still involved with others, and so by their mutual embrace, are detained from
evaporation.

Artificial things and preparations, are no less subject to Putrefaction than
Natural things; for Bread, and all manner of Eatable things or Food, Wine,
Beer, and other Drinkable Liquors, also Medicinal Confections, being long kept,
first lose their strength and vigor, and then afterward are Corrupted:
concerning which, we may observe these following things.

The more the things are Compounded, and have all the Principles conjoined
together, the sooner, and the easier, do they enter into Putrefaction;
wherefore Eatable things, prepared of Flesh, Broths, Decoctions of Herbs, also
many Medicines made after the Galenical way, are wont (unless preserved with
very much Salt or Sugar) to be Corrupted in a short time: In the mean time,
Distillations, and Chemical Preparations, which consist of Homogeneous, or not
much different Particles, are kept sound a long while.

In Compounded things, if there be too great quantity of water, things sooner
putrefie, for so the frame of the mixture is too loose; so that the fixed
Principles cannot take hold of the Volatile, or keep them back from flight: but
those in which Spirits abound with moderate Salt and Sulphur, if they are kept
in a close Vessel, that they may evaporate but little, continue a long time, as
may be perceived by strong or generous Wine. The next to these, are those
things which are preserved with Honey or Sugar, or in which the Saline Particles
are in great plenty by Nature.

Many of these, whilst they are corrupted, are either made Moldy or Rank, or
they grow sour, or degenerate into a vapidness, or without taste: things are
made Moldy, when the subtle Particles in the exhaling, are detained by the more
thick, and cleaving together by their mutual embrace on the Superficies of the
Body, grow into a soft Down or Hoariness, even as Moss is brought forth by
Stones or Wood exposed to moisture.

Rankness or unsavory Taste, happens chiefly in Sulphurous things, for Oily and
Fat things, by Heat or Age, become Musty or Unsavory, to wit, when the Spirit
being very much exhaled, the Sulphurous Particles are two much exalted, and
begin to evaporate.

Sharpness or Acidity is induced from the Salt, being too much carried forth
and loosened, for when the Spirit is depressed, or exhaled, the Salt being
fused, conceives a Flux, and so brings in a Sowrness: hence Wine, Beer, Cydar,
also Milk, very many Eatable things, and the Juices of Herbs, when they are
long kept, or if they are moved by too immoderate heat of the Air, or shaking,
do easily grow Sour.

Liquid things, degenerate into a vapidness or tastlesness, when the active
Principles, are for the most part gone forth, and nothing eminent besides Water
and Earth, or of the subtle parts, is left in the Subject.

That I may contract what is aforesaid; the corruption of every thing, is only
the separation and departure of themselves from one another into parts of the
Principles before combined, (the bond of the mixture being loosened) which
motion, by reason of the diverse disposition of their breaking forth, (either
with or without a stink) ends in Putrefaction or Rottenness.

Where Spirits abound, and that there is also plenty of Sulphur and Salt, and
the Particles being loosened from their bonds, break forth in heaps; the
mixture putrefies with a stink; also if it consist of a thick substance, so
that all the parts are not rightly ventilated, it conceives a heat from the
Putrefaction: in such a Corruption, the stink proceeds from the exhalation of
the sharp pointed Sulphur, or made pricking with the Salt: Putrefaction
follows, for that the external humidity, enters into the place of the Particles
flying away: But the heat is produced by the Sulphurous Particles being moved
together in heaps, and being shut up within the Subject, that they gather
together, and being united act more strongly. But if there be in the Subject a
lesser proportion of Salt and Sulphur, so that when the mixture is loosened,
the Particles are moved more slowly, and evaporate leisurely, the Body grows
dry, and is reduced to a wasting, without any ill smell, Putrefaction or Heat.

It will not be from the purpose to inquire in this place, from whence some
empty Vessels, and more moist bodies, by lying long, conceive a certain stink
without Putrefaction; also other things being put into them, or lying near
them, are wont to partake of their Evil; for which affection, a proper Latin
word is not easily to be met with; in our Idiom it is called Mustiness, and in
some sort seems to be designed by the word Mucor, unless that (...) or Mucor,
points at Bodies infected with a certain Down or Hoariness, (which we call
Moldiness) which here never happens. The consideration of this matter is not
improperly referred to the Doctrine of Fermentation, for this Tincture or
Impression of a stink, unfolds it self far abroad, as if it were a certain
Ferment, that the Vessel but lightly imbued with it; infects whatever Liquors
are put into it, and infusions of them, even new and often iterated; we may
observe a twofold effect of this thing: For sometimes the Vessels being almost
empty, at first vitiated, afterward infect most Liquors, which they by chance
receive, with a musty odor: sometimes more moist compacted, and solid things,
being kept long, somewhat close in a Cellar, contract this vice of their own
accord; when in the mean time the contagion is not perceived to be in the place
where they were kept; which things either may become musty, not because they
are corrupted, for in most Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, being yet contained, in
the bond of mixture, the frame of the matter is kept whole, but the vice only
consists in this, that from the Subjects after this manner disposed, effluvia's
as it were aculeated or sharpened fall off, and therefore become ungrateful to
our smell and taste.

First, that any Vessel may conceive a mustiness, there seems to be required in
the first place, that its inward hollowness be large, and its mouth narrow; to
wit, whereby a passage may lie open to the outward Air, and rest may be granted
to it being entered in: for Juggs with broad mouths, also Bottles close shut, do
not easily get this fault. Secondly, that besides the more ample inward
hollowness, the sides of the Vessel be endued with pores, and very small
passages; for in these kind of little spaces besmeared with humor, the Air
being strictly shut up, remains more quiet, and is apt to stagnate: Wherefore
Glass Bottles are not so apt to suffer this evil as Wooden, or Stone Bottles.
Thirdly, that some moisture, tho very little, stick about the sides of the
Vessel, or in its bottom, whereby the Air being entered may be entangled: for if
the Bottles be hung up, with their mouth downwards, that all moisture may drein
out, they will never be musty.

In the second place: when Bodies, without any contagion of a Vessel, contract
a mustiness or moldiness of their own accord, we may observe, first, that they
are of that kind, which consist of Heterogeneous Particles, that is, a mixture
of all the Elements together; because the parts of Vegetables and Animals, and
preparations of them, easily receive this evil; Minerals for the most part
remain free from it: Secondly, that there be plenty of humidity in the
concrete, for the more dry continue a long while without any hurt: Thirdly,
that the Bodies be either kept in a heap unmoved for a long time, or else in
some close Cupbord, or Cellar, without Air; for so Wheat or Grain, in a heap,
unless it be often moved, as also all Eatable things, being put up in a close
place quickly grow musty.

According to these positions we conjecture, that mustiness is made an
affection to a moist inanimate Body, from the ambient Air, being admitted
within its pores, and being got in there stagnating, whereby the Elementary
Particles of that mixture, being combined together with those sent in by the
Air, are exalted into the Nature of a Ferment; that they diffuse themselves on
every side with wonderful activity, and their effluvia's, as it were sharpened,
ungratefully strike against the sensories of the taste and smell. When
therefore, some Subject becomes primarily musty, a certain portion of the Air
placed near, and hindered from ventilation, enters into its pores and passages,
and there being entangled with a tenacious matter, is wholly shut up within the
substance of that Concrete. From the mixture of the shut-up Air, the implanted
little Bodies of the matter, especially the Sulphurous and Saline, acquire new
heads; that afterward, when they are exactly to be mixed with no other Body,
yet very greatly Fermentative, tho intermingled with any other thing, retain
their own Nature, and being diffused through the large substance of the matter,
infect the whole; to wit, they dispose by that means, the Particles of that new
matter, that they being armed with sharp points, bring in like manner a trouble
to our senses: But in the mean time, from the mustiness, whether primarily
arisen, or received by Contagion, the mixture of the thing is not dissolved,
nor the Principles dissipated; yea those things which are wholly tastless, do
scarce at any time become musty: the musty smell depends chiefly on the active
Principles, disposed by a peculiar rite, by the involved Air and their
effluvia's; wherefore, if they almost wholly fly away from any Subject, that is
rendered almost incapable of this affection.

There may be observed a certain likeness between mustiness and an Empyreuma,
or taste of fire or burnt-too, for as in this, the Particles of the fire being
entangled, and included by a tenacious matter, by their long stay there,
pervert the implanted little Bodies of Salt and Sulphur, from whence their
effluvia's, strike our Senses with an ungrateful sharpness; moreover, being
mingled with other things, they affix to them, the disposition of their
pravity; so in mustiness, the Particles of the Air, being obvolved with a
viscous matter, and stagnating, they change by their presence the Saline and
Sulphurous little Bodies, from their due temper, whereby they being as it were
gifted with sharp prickings, do strike bitterly our sensories, and being
exceeding Fermentative, diffuse their Odor to others: the alteration being
either way contracted, can scarce be blotted out, by any mixture with other
things, or emendation by Art: The chief means of helping of either, is by
placing it in a reciprocal trajection, viz. Empyreumatical things, or tasting
of the fire, are to be a long while exposed to a more moist Air, whereby the
Particles of the Fire may exhale: and musty things are to be held to the Fire,
or put to such things which may sweeten their Nature, to wit, quick Lime,
Sulphur, or Stygian waters, by which the parts of the included Air are driven
away, and so the remaining little Bodies of the mixture are wont to recover
their pristine state; wherefore, if musty Liquors are distilled, the water
falling into the Receiver, will be deprived of that stink: But the smatch of
Fire or Empyreuma, is not so easily mended by this Artifice.

So much for Fermentation, and the motion of the Principles, for as much as
within the Confines of the same Subject, they dispose it, either to maturity
and perfection, or toward dissolution and corruption. It now follows to treat
of the motion of the same kind of Particles and Principles, for as much as some
of one Body do act on others of another Body, and by dissolving the mixture, do
wholly draw them forth, and send them outward, or by precipitating it cause
them to go into parts,

CHAP. IX. Of the motion of Fermentation, as much as is to be observed in the
Dissolution of Bodies.
FOR the Solution of Bodies, there are two great solvencies, or Menstrua, which
exist from Nature, to wit, Water and Fire: Fire, if it be next and immediately
applied, destroys most Bodies, drives away the Principles one from another, and
as it were dissipates them into Air, Earth only, with a little Salt, being left
behind; if it be mediately applied, it brings away some Particles, so that in
the mean time others remain: After which manner it serves chiefly for
Distillations, and Chemical Operations, and is also used in the Preparation of
necessaries for our Food, both about the Boiling and Rosting of Meats. Water
does not so readily destroy Bodies, but it draws forth some parts from the
Subjects, and receives them into its own Bosom, and firmly retains them for
various uses: But as it does not easily penetrate every Body, but leaves almost
untouched those which are of a more fixed Nature, various ways are thought of,
whereby the Menstruum of water is made sharper, and is rendered fit for the
dissolving of any Bodies whatsoever. For by means of the Bodies, which it ought
to dissolve, and of the parts which it ought to receive in it self, it is armed
as it were with some Weapons; with which it is able to unlock any Subject, and
to possess now these, now those Particles. The Menstruum of water is sharpened
with Spirit, Salt, or Sulphur: to wit, either with each of these, or with more
of them joined together; we will first speak of the watery Menstruum, with the
various sharpning of it, and afterward of the fiery dissolvent.

Common water most easily dissolves the more simple Bodies, except Sulphur; and
hides their Particles, in its pores and passages; it readily receives Salts of
every kind, and easily imbibes Spirits; it loosens the frame of Earth, and
cherishes its more tender little bodies, in its embrace; but it is hardly mixed
with Fat, and Oily things, and receives not their Particles, but by the coming
between of others, but drives them forth to its Superficies, as not miscible,
or thrusts them down to the bottom.

Water in some measure enters the more compounded Bodies, whose frame is
somewhat loose; and then receives into its bosom, some not simple Particles, but
resembling the nature of the whole mixture: hence most Vegetables, also parts
of living creatures, and some Minerals, being put into common water, do
impregnate it with a certain virtue; and from most Metals, by a long
maceration, it takes away some strength, though but small. Some Bodies are
dissolved by water, which yet a Sulphurous or Spirituous Menstrua leave almost
untouched; as the Gums Tragacanth, Arabic, etc. also Salts and Sugar.

The first and most common way of sharpning, whereby simple water may more
easily enter the Bodies to be dissolved, is, that it be furnished with fiery
Particles, or darts of adventitious heat; for so it is driven more deeply with
a certain force, into Bodies, and destroys some thrids, as it were the smallest
mites, in their most inward recesses. Wherefore we are wont to boil for a long
while, the matter to be dissolved in water, or at least to infuse it in warm
water, by which means, the more tenuious, and certain subtle Particles, which
resemble the nature of the Subject, are easily drawn forth, and impregnate the
water, with the virtue of the whole mixture.

So much for the simple, or natural Menstruum of water, to wit, for as much as
its activity is wont sometimes to be promoted, by fire or ascititious heat. But
this cannot be so simple, but that it contains in it self some Particles of
another kind; as may be gathered from its easy Putrefaction; for oftentimes it
is impregnated with Spirituous, Sulphurous, or Saline breathings, contracted
from the Air or Earth; that for the drawing forth the tinctures of very many
things, sometimes it excels an Artificial Menstruum; for that Acidulous or
Spawish waters, Mineral waters, Rain water, and May Dew, are of frequent use
among Chymicks, for the remarkable faculty of dissolving, with which they are
strong. Besides, it is a vulgar observation, that some waters most easily
dissolve Soap, and being thoroughly mixed with the same, causes in the liquor a
great spume or froth; such, if they be rubbed between the fingers, feel soft
and gentle; but other waters, which being handled with the hands, are more
harsh, refuse the mixture both of Soap and Oil, and so are accounted
unprofitable for the washing of Clothes: these sort of waters, if they should
be evaporated in a Glass, oftentimes affix a Crust to its bottom and sides;
because they are impregnated, more than they ought, with Saline Particles, with
which, when the Saline parts residing in the Soap combine, the Sulphurous are
carried away, and they being excluded the pores, are thrust forth as not
miscible, to the top of the Liquor. When Flesh is boiled in these waters, it
grows very red; which tincture indeed being thence contracted, is a sign, that
those waters are somewhat imbued with Vitriol, or some other kind of Salt. But
we will pass to Artificial Menstruas, in which the watery Liquor is furnished
with Spirit, Salt, or Sulphur, being gathered apart, or many of them together.

The Spirituous Menstruum of water is made, when from a Body swelling with
Spirits, a clear and limpid water is distilled; as from Wine, or strong Beer,
or other Bodies truly Fermented, and brought to exaltation: The kind of
dissolvent is hardly to be had so sincere, but it is mixed with the Particles
of more pure Sulphur, and sometimes of a volatile Salt. The former kind of
Liquor is called Spirit of Wine, which being subtle, and very penetrating,
easily enters the Bodies, and parts of Vegetables, and also of living
Creatures, but hardly Minerals, or not at all: it extracts from many things,
not any Particles, or resembling the Nature of the whole mixture, (as common
water) but chiefly Spirituous, and Sulphurous, the rest being almost
untouched; wherefore, it is wont to be used for the resinous magisteria of
Vegetables, (which it draws forth almost sincere or without mixture, under the
form of Gum or Refine) in the mean time, it is not so fit as common water, for
the extracts of Plants, which are not so endued with Sulphur: from Sulphurous
things, as Benzoin, Sulphur, Olibanum, Styrax, Amber, and the like, it draws
forth excellent Tinctures: It dissolves the fixed Salts of Herbs, also of
Pearls and Coral, before prepared with Vinegar, by a long digestion, and
receives their Tinctures into it self: it leaves Sugar, and Gums, being
dissolvable in water, almost untouched. But there is another Spirituous
Menstruum, that is sharpened with a volatile Salt, such is the Liquor which is
distilled out of blood, Hartshorn or Soot; it is far stronger than the former,
and cuts most Bodies, except Metals, into parts, and oftimes destroys the forms
of the whole mixture: yea it most excellently dissolves secondarily, the most
fixed Metal, to wit, Gold, being first reduced into a Calx, by its proper
Menstruum, and reduces it into a Tincture, or potable Liquor.

They are accounted Sulphurous Menstrua, which are brought forth of
Sulphurous Bodies, under the form of an Oil: these are prepared, either by
distillation, such as are chiefly the Oil of Turpentine, Juniper, and the like;
or by expression, such as are wrung forth of Olives, Almonds, and other Fruits,
or Seeds of Vegetables. Things distilled are of more efficacy, than
preparations by expression; either of them draw forth some Particles, from
Vegetables, or Animals; by the virtues of which, these Oils being impregnated,
they are made fit for Medicinal use. Yea they are conveniently enough made use
of, for the extracting of the Sulphurous Particles of Minerals, which sometimes
they draw forth sincere or unmixt: But if Oil of Turpentine, or Lin-seed Oil,
draws forth by dissolving, the combustible part of common Sulphur, in the mean
time, the remaining Saline parts, and untouched by the Menstruum, grow into
Crystals; as is obvious to every one, in the preparing the Balsam of Sulphur.

Mineral Bodies, in which the bond of Concretion chiefly depends upon Sulphur,
as are the Fire-Stone, Antimony, common Brimstone, and the like, are in some
sort dissolved by a Sulphurous Menstruum, which draws forth of the Body,
Particles of the same kind, the Saline being almost untouched: wherefore Oil of
Turpentine, Linseed, etc. draw forth a Tincture from these; in the mean time,
Saline Menstrua such as are distilled Vinegar, or Stygian waters, profit little
for the dissolving their Bodies: but that these, unless before Calcined, hardly
are touched. But on the contrary, where the frame of the mixture consists of a
Saline bond, such as are Iron, Copper and the like, Saline Menstrua, as Aqua
fortis, Spirit of Vitriol, Salt, etc. receive in the dissolving, the Particles
of the same Nature into themselves, the Sulphurous being almost untouched.
This plainly appears, in the solutions of Metals, but chiefly and remarkably in
Camphire, which Stygian waters reduce into a Liquor, in form of an Oil,
swimming on the Menstruum; to wit, they dissolve its frame, and receive some
Saline parts, on which the Concretion depends, into themselves; in the mean
time the Sulphurous being untouched, they are gathered together apart, on the
Superficies of the Liquor. There is something to be wondered at concerning
Antimony: to wit, that its Concretion being very irregular, that Mineral
becomes exceeding unlike, not only to other mixtures, but also to it self; for
it is very lax, nevertheless much compacted; it lies open to the least
injuries, yet is almost impervious to the greatest, so that it may equally
number its losses, with its Victories: some of its Particles lie so loose, that
they are brought away by any Oily Menstruum, or by a common lixivium or Lie:
others in the mean while do so pertinaciously stick together, that Aqua Fortis
cannot touch them, only Aqua Regia being poured upon it can know it; which so
strongly resists it, that the fume raised up from thence, presently obscures
the whole Room, wherefore there seem to be in this, parts wholly of a different
Nature, some imperfectly mixed, viz. Earthy and Sulphurous, which are easily
loosned by a fit solvent; in the mean time others wholly Metallic, perfectly
mixed, coming near in some sort to the Nature of Gold it self; which therefore
are only to be dissolved, by a fit Menstruum of Salt.

The Saline Menstrua are of diverse kinds and natures, viz. of Vegetables,
Animals, or Minerals. Among Vegetables are eminent, the sour juices of Fruits
and Herbs, Counterfeit Vinegars, acid Liquors distilled out of ponderous Woods,
as Guaiacum, the Oak, and Box; in all which, the Saline Particles having gotten
a Flux, either by Art or by Nature, give a notable sowrness: or the Vegetable
Menstruum consists of Salts of Tartar, or made by the cineration of Herbs, and
dissolved, which by the Fire are very much whetted, and acquire an acritude; in
these the Saline Particles are fixed, and in a condition opposite to a Flux. To
the rank of Animals I refer the Spirit of Urine, Hartshorn, etc. which
although they are impregnated with Spirits, yet they take their chief forces
from a Volatile Salt. But the strongest Saline Menstrua, are drawn forth of
Minerals, such are acetous Liquors, which are most strongly forced by fire, out
of the Salts of Nitre, Sea Salt, Alumn, Chalcarth or Vitriol, and such like.

Those which are drawn out of Vegetables, as Vinegars, and acid Liquors do best
of all dissolve Corals, Pearls, Shells, and Shelly substances: because in these
there is great plenty of Alcalizat Salt, with which the fluid Salt, which
abounds in those kind of acetous Menstrua's, desires to be most strictly
united; wherefore they being applied to the body to be dissolved, enter its
pores and passages, loosen the Complications of the Particles of the Alcalizat
Salt, and snatch them into their own Embrace. Even after the same manner, the
fluid Salt in a Vegetable Menstruum, approaches the Volatile Salt in the Horns
of Animals.

These kind of Menstrua's do corrode some Metals toward the Superficies; but
do not so potently unlock their bodies by dissolving, as Stygian waters, some
Sulphurous subjects, being before loosened by Calcination, do enter aptly
enough, and from thence carry forth Saline Particles. Wherefore, for the Salt
of Tinn, Lead, Antimony, Soot, and others, being first reduced into a Calx, we
use distilled Vinegar.

The Salts of Tartar, and the fixed Salts of Herbs, although they serve for
praecipitation, rather than dissolution, yet because they consist of sharp, and
very penetrating Particles, they are of egregious use: For watery Menstrua's are
chiefly sharpened with these, for the extracting of the Tinctures of Vegetables.
And although bodies which abound with an alcalizat Salt, as Pearls, Coralls, etc.
are left wholly untouched by reason of the Homogeneity or agreeableness of the
parts in either; and that also, they but little gnaw, only on the Superficies,
being put upon Metals, and grow together with their Salt, and Sulphur into
rust; yet Sulphurous bodies they readily enter, so they be loosened by the
fire, and unlock and pull assunder their joyntings or complexions; wherefore,
for the making of the Milk or Magisterium of Sulphur, the Salt of Tartar most
excellently conduces.

Saline Menstrua's are most strong, which are forced by distillation out of
Minerals, to wit, out of Vitriol, Niter, Sea Salt, Alumn, Arsenick; Acetous
Liquors are distilled either from these single, or from many of them mixed
together; which as they are of the highest sharpness, like to fire, readily
enter most bodies, but chiefly Metallic bodies, and such as consist of a Saline
bond, and dissolve them easily into most small parts. These Liquors are only
Saline Particles, which being driven by the force of heat, from the embrace of
their Earth, having gotten by that means a Flux, are converted into water: as
actual fire chiefly assaults Sulphurous bodies, and by destroying the body
draws to it self the Consimilary parts; Stygian waters (which are also called
potential fire) easily pull assunder bodies, which very much abound with Salt,
as Metals; and break them, inviolable by fire, into most minute parts.

Concerning the Solutions of Minerals, we may observe, that their frame is not
easily destroyed, or loosened into parts, as other Concretes of Nature; but for
this, most strong Menstrua's, and those chiefly Acetous, distilled from Salts,
are required; the reason of which is, for that the Concretion of Minerals,
depends mostly upon great plenty of Salt, binding the rest of the Particles, as
with a bond; wherefore their substance is more solid, more hard, and compact,
and only gives place to a Saline Menstruum. When any Mineral, or Metal is
dissolved, the fluid Particles of the Salt, in the Menstruum, most easily enter
the most strict Complications, of the fixed Salt in the mixture, and impervious
to any other solvent, loosen them from their binding, and snatch them into
their Embraces: after this manner, the Particles of the Salts being united, and
dilated by the Liquor, are hidden in the pores and passages of the Menstruum;
and together with these, stick, and are also supped up, by the Menstruum, the
more pure and minutely divided bodies of Earth or Sulphur, which were in the
mixture; in the mean time, the more thick, and more stuffed with Earthiness,
are praecipitated to the bottom of the dissolving Liquor: wherefore Gold and
Silver are wholly devoured by the Menstruum; but Iron, Lead, etc. and also
Metallic recrements, send forth from themselves, in the dissolving,
Heterogeneous Particles, as so many offscourings: when Minerals are broke into
parts by this means, the divided Particles, and most minutely broken, (so long
as they equally cohaere with the Parti-of the fluid Salt, which are in the
Menstruum) being dispersed through the Liquor of the Menstruum, and hidden in
its pores and passages, are supped up, and rendered invisible. Yea also, the
humor of the Menstruum being taken away, the remaining Calx, which consists of
the Particles of a mixed, and fluid Salt, combined together, is dissolved in any
other Liquor: but if after a Metallic solution, the fluid Salt be drawn off,
from the Particles of the thing soluted, or by Calcination, it neither poyses
any Liquor it is put to, with a new adjection of fixed Salt, nor do the little
bodies of the thing soluted fall through the pores of the Menstruum, nor are
they lastly supped up, by any Liquor added to them.

But that among Metals, some are corraded by any acetous Liquor; in the mean
time others, as Silver and Gold, require a peculiar solvent, as it were to be
unlocked by an appropriat Key: and what is more wonderful, common Aqua fortis,
which eats Silver, leaves Gold altogether untouched: then the same Liquor by an
addition of Sal Ammoniac, is made a proper dissolvent of Gold, and has no power
upon Silver: The reason of those may be thus understood: Gold and Silver are
more compact Metals, very much cleansed from earthy matter; wherefore they are
not broken into parts by any solvent, but only by those kind of Menstruas,
which consist of a Salt homogeneous or agreeable with them. But as the frame or
substance of Silver depends upon a Vitriolic Salt, and that of Gold, on an
Ammoniac Salt (or of a more perfect kind, to wit, such as is wont to be most
strictly complicated with Sulphur) hence Aqua fortis, so long as it is strong
with a Vitriolic Virtue, combines with the Salt of the Silver, and therefore
unlocks its frame or substance, but does not loosen the concretion of Gold,
which depends upon an Heterogeneous bond: If that to this Menstruum, Sal
Ammoniac be added, the power of the Vitriolic Salt is blotted forth, and the
Saline darts of the solvent are made fit only for the Gold, the Silver being
untouched.

When Minerals are corroded by acetous Menstrua's, we are not therefore to
think, the same always to be resolved into Elementary parts: that the Salt and
Sulphur of them, may be had sincere or unmixt, by this means (although some boast,
that they are easily able to show such Analyzes of Metals) for that it appears
to our observation, and frequent experience, that many of these are of so
compact and solid a Concretion, that they cannot be broken, but into integral
parts: as for example, Gold and Quicksilver, after what manner almost soever
handled, when they are reduced into manifold Calxes, will at last by a strong
fire acquire their proper forms: viz. the Saline Particles of the Menstruum,
loosen the bond of Concretion, whereby the most minute integral parts of the
mixture stick one to another; but the same solvent, is not able in all things,
to break assunder the Copula of the first mixture, whereby the Elements are
mutually bound together: so that for the most part Metallic Calxes, are only
little bodies of the Concrete, broken into most small little Globes, being
involved by the Saline Particles of the Menstruum: Wherefore, fire being
applied, those corrosive Salts being pulled away from their Embrace, are wholly
driven away; then the Metallic little bits, or dust, as so many little
particular Globes being fused, by the intense heat, coming together into one
Mass by melting, resume the Species of the Metal: wherefore, they who commonly
affirm, that the Salts of Minerals for the most part, are only the Saline
Particles of the solvent, conjoined with the Metal, reduced as it were into
fine flower, without doubt speak truth in the preparations of Sol and Mercury,
or of Gold and Quicksilver; also the Salt or Sugar of Saturn or Lead, is
nothing else: But that sweetness comes only from the Vinegar; for if in the
distillation of Vinegar, the joynings of the Vessels are closed with Clay, and
Salt, Chaulk and Horse-Dung, on the Superficies of this, grows together a most
white Salt, wonderfully sweet, in every thing like to that Sugar: but from
some, viz. from Iron, Copper, and Silver, are prepared fictitious Vitriols,
which are for the most part Saline: For that the same, by distillation, may be
forced into acetous Liquors, as the Metallic recrements.

Besides the solvence hitherto recited (which, by means of the Particles, which
are strong in them, act upon a peculiar and determinate matter) I know that
Chemists do boast wonderful things, of a certain universal Menstruum, by whose
inspiration every body what ever, may be easily reduced to its Principles, or
first Elements: And tho Helmont have bragged, that he had attained to this
Secret by his own Labor, and now daily the Adepti of Chemistry, do aspire to
this end; yet the hopes and endeavors of most, have failed them in this work,
even as in the Philosophers Stone. There are also some other famous Menstrua's,
viz. The Aqua vitae Tartarisated of Quercitan, and his Philosophic Vinegar,
which are of noted use in the preparing of Medicines; but since I know nothing,
or any strange thing they have done, in the dissolution of Bodies, we will pass
them over.

So much concerning solvent Menstrua: about bodies to be dissolved, a certain
provision should be instituted, whereby indeed their complections may more
easily be unlocked, and cut into most minute parts: Wherefore the Concrete is
now pounded into powder, now cut into little bits, that the way might lie open
for the solvent, to its most inward recesses. If that the frame of the subject
be harder, and more strict, that it will not give place, but of a long time, to
the Menstruum, before the dissolution is begun, there ought to be administered
some aperitives, or openers, whereby the concretion may be first loosened, and
somewhat opened: wherefore, the tincture of Steel, is more easily extracted, if
its filings be sprinkled with the juice of Limons, or the Spirit of Vitriol: in
like manner Hartshorn, or the shavings of Ivory are handled when we would have
the decoctions of them quickly made: when formerly I have been very solicitous
about this thing, viz. that I might render the more hard bodies easily soluble,
in any Menstruum, and that I had especially tried many things about Iron; after
several experiments, at length by a certain chance, and almost thinking of
something else, I found out a preparation, whereby without any Corrosive, or
Acid Liquor, by the mediation only of a gentle heat, the body of Iron is
opened, that being reduced into powder, gives immediately a tincture, to any
Liquor, that neither Salts themselves, are sooner dissolved in common water: By
this means, I am wont to prepare suddenly, in great quantity, Mineral waters,
which exactly resemble our Tunbridg Spaws; and to render Wine, Beer, Milk, or
Whey, with no trouble Chalybeated. By this means, Syrrops, Tinctures, Extracts,
or Magisteria out of Steel, are most easily to be had. Moreover, plainly by the
same Artifice, Corals, Pearls, Eyes, and Claws of Crabs, and all shelly things,
are prepared, that their powders presently impart to any Menstruum, a tincture,
or the virtues of the whole Concrete. And in this preparation, no strange
quality is introduced to the Subject, nor its own proper quality lost.

When I had by this means, learnt to unlock all Bodies whatsoever, consisting
of a Saline bond, presently from the Analogy of this, was made known the means
of unlocking Subjects, whose Concretion is wholly Sulphurous: for I am wont so
to prepare common Sulphur, that its powder immediately impregnates any Liquor,
with the tincture and virtue of Sulphur. The Spirit of Wine, suddenly contracts
a deep color, and very red, that being put into it. Common water by the
infusion, or decoction of the same Powder, is rendered clearly Sulphurous, and
gilds Silver, and by this means, from that Tincture, a praecipitation being
made of White Wine, or Vinegar, the Milk of Sulphur is easily prepared, in
great quantity. Out of Sulphurated Wine by this infusion, I make a Syrrop, than
which there is scarce found a more excellent remedy, in the distempers of the
Thorax. By this means, Tinctures, Extracts, Magistries, are prepared from
Sulphur, with no labor, and without any smatch of the fire. By the same way
preparations from Amber, Benzoin, and other Sulphurous things, easily
dissolvable in any Menstruum, are composed. But enough and too much of this: we
will now pass to the other great dissolvent of Nature.

CHAP. X. Of the Nature of Fire: and by the way of Heat, and Light.
WE may almost pronounce the same thing of Fire, what the Philosophers of old
did of the first Matter, to wit, that it was potentially every where, and in
all things; but in none, in act. For among these sublunaries, Fire has got no
existence of its own Nature, or certain means of duration: It is produced
almost in every Subject, but is retained long in none, but it suddenly
vanishes, and expires: yea unless some external accidents, oftentimes should
concur for its production, I think it had not at all been in the world. Some
have dreamed, that its Sphere is situate under the Moon: but this was
introduced only, for the making the Hypothesis of the four Elements: for such a
thing seems consonant neither to Sense, nor Reason. That we may rightly search
out the Nature of Fire, we must seek in what Bodies it is chiefly to be found,
and how they are disposed; and then we may proceed to the unfolding its essence.

The Subjects most convenient both for the producing, and the maintaining of
Fire, are of that kind, in which there are very many Particles of Sulphur, and
but only a moderate portion of Water, Salt, and Earth: for these do hinder its
inkindlings, and being plentifully poured on it, extinguish it being inkindled:
Wherefore Bituminous, Fat, and Oily things, quickly take flame: so also Chips,
Straw, light and dry Wood: in the mean time, Metals, Minerals, the glebe of the
Earth, Dung, wet Straw, and green Wood, are hardly, or not at all to be
inkindled.

Secondly, we observe, that all the time Fire continues in the Subject,
Sulphurous Particles fly away in heaps, and from the departure of these, the
substance of the burning body is by degrees destroyed; in the mean time, very
much of Salt and Earth, remains in the form of Ashes, after the burning.

There is a third observation, that when the Sulphurous Particles are wholly,
or for the most part flown out of any Subject, the burning wholly ceases, and
the form of fire is quite destroyed; nor can it be renewed in the remaining
matter, wanting of Sulphur.

Fourthly, we will note, that sometimes some Bodies conceive a burning without
the advention of another fire, only by their own effervency, and by the
intestine motion of the implanted Particles, and of their own accord are
reduced into Ashes; as when wet Hay is laid up close, it first grows hot, then
afterward breaks forth into smoke and flame; or the Wheels and Axeltrees of
Carts or Wains, being heated by too great agitation, are inkindled.

According to these positions, we may affirm, that the form of fire, wholly
depends upon Sulphurous Particles, heaped up in any Subject, and breaking
forth from it in heaps: and that fire is no other thing, than the motion and
eruption, of these kind of Particles, impetuously stirred up. For Sulphur is of
an exceeding fierce and untamed Nature, whose little bodies, when (the yoke of
the mixture being shook off) they begin to be thickly heaped together, diffuse
themselves on every side like a torrent, break whatsoever obstacles are in the
Subject, destroy whatever comes in opposition, or fling it down headlong. Nor
do they only unlock their proper Subjects, but also lay open the gates and
doors of any other Subject near, that they can reach to, and there incite to
the like fury, all the consimilary Particles of Sulphur, and provoke them to an
eruption: wherefore fire every where inkindles fire.

The Sulphurous Particles, while they, heaped together within the confines of
their Subject, or on its Superficies, are agitated with a rapid motion, but are
detained by the Embrace of other little Bodies, from a more free eruption, and
more aggregated, constitute the form of fire; as is to be seen in burning
Coals, or in glowing Iron; but when these sort of Particles fly away by heaps,
from the same Subject, and bound together, they produce flame, which is only an
heap, or rather a torrent, of the Particles of Sulphur flowing together, and
conjunctly flying away: if Watery, Earthy, and Saline Particles, are commixt
with the Sulphurous breaking away, and are able to disjoyn and separate them,
only smoke is excited; which afterward, the Sulphurous little Bodies more
plentifully breathing forth themselves, and getting together, breaks forth into
flame.

The inkindling of Fire happens very many ways. The first and most simple is,
when from hard bodies struck one against another, but oftenest from a Flint
struck against Steel, sparks of fire break forth; which being received in
Tinder, made of a Linen Cloth burnt to blackness, dilate themselves, and then
a Match or Sulphurated thing being applied, they cause the inkindling of a
flame. Secondly, a fire often happens in dry Wood, and dry things, when by the
too great attrition of the parts, and agitation, being made hot, they conceive
an inkindling of their own accord. And thirdly, when Bodies abounding with
Sulphur, as Hay, or Flax laid up wet, (of which mention was before made) grow
hot of their own accord, and afterward are inkindled. The fourth way, is the
most usual, of introducing fire into any Subject, that it may be inkindled by
another fire. We will a little more consider the several processes of these.

1. Hard Bodies struck one against another, shake forth little sparks of fire:
as a Flint with Iron, or with a Flint; Indian Canes, the Fire Stone, and many
other things. The reason of this is, because the Particles of Sulphur, which
reside in the Superficies of a hard Body, if they are smitten by another hard
Body, are not able to go back inward, (because in hard things there is not
afforded any cession of the parts, from place to place) nor can the smitten
Particles of Sulphur evaporate by degrees; but that by reason of the vehemence
of the stroke, they are necessitated to break forth in heaps: Wherefore, when
by this means, many of them are moved together, and are aggregated, they
exhibit the apparition of fire, The sparks being received into the half-burnt
Linen or Tinder, are dilated into a greater fire, for that the Sulphurous
Particles, in such a Subject are eminent, and are brought as it were to the
very top it self of eruption or breaking forth, wherefore by the least spark
being moved or stirred up, a way being made they fly away.

The very same reason is for Wood being made hot, and afterward fired, by too
great attrition; by which means, the Axeltrees and Wheels of Chariots, or of
Mills, are frequently fired: for the Sulphurous Particles, being by this means
very much moved, are more thickly heaped together; and when, having as it were
made an Army, they are able to remove, or strike away the rest, they presently
break forth in Troops, and by their going away cause a burning.

In Hay or Dung laid up wet, the Particles of Sulphur very much abound; which
having gotten the watery Latex for a Vehicle, run themselves into motion: but
when for want of Ventilation, they cannot by little and little exhale, being
straightened within, and so brought into their exaltation, they are able to join
more one to another, and mutually to incite themselves: then afterward, being
very much heaped together, they unfold themselves more largely, and begin to
break the Dens of the Subject, and so produce a burning. For it is to be
observed in any Subject, when the Particles of Sulphur, being more slowly
moved, fly away by degrees, neither heat, nor fire, but only a dryness, and
leanness, succeed. But if they are more rapidly moved, than that they may be
able to exhale leisurely, a heat is stirred up in the Subject: then if yet they
are agitated more vehemently, and impetuously, and being more thickly
agglomerated or heaped together, they break forth in heaps, a deflagration or
flame follows the heat.

Fire being inkindled in any Subject, enters and inkindles, whatever
Sulphurous thing is next it. For as Saline Menstrua, viz. Stygian waters,
assault Metals, stuffed with Mineral Salt, and loosen their Saline Particles,
as being of kin, from the mixture; so also the Sulphurous Particles, being
inkindled, break whatever Sulphurous Particles are next them, and stir them up
into the like motion of burning, with themselves.

Thus much concerning the nature and production of Fire: it remains that we
next inquire into the effects of Fire, and also concerning its virtue and
efficacy; to wit, what kind of Bodies it dissolves, and by what means; and also
for what uses it serves for. The chief effects of Fire are Heat and Light;
either of them are excited by emanations, or Effluvia, sent from an inkindled
Body; but after a far different manner: for truly, heat is most often produced
at a distance, without light; also light, without any sensible heat.

Heat, forasmuch as it belongs to the sense of the touch, is conceived, when a
certain passion is induced in the skin, or any other Organ of the touch,
whereby the little Fibers and Nervous parts are drawn asunder, moved into light
Spasms or Convulsions, and sometimes (if the stroke be vehement) suffer a
solution of the union. This is wont to be done, either by the bringing near of
Fire, or of another Body made hot by Fire, or by some other means. For from
either, the Sulphurous or warming Particles being excited, into a more rapid
motion, and breaking forth by heaps spread abroad, which, as so many little
darts, being thrust into our skin, or other Sensory of the touch, either by
tickling gently, they bring to it a pleasing sense of heat; or by striking it
more grievously, the troublesome sense of burning or scorching.

For the effect of heat, Fire is applied to Bodies, either immediately, and so
either for the sake of Burning, Rosting or Boiling; or mediatly, viz. by the
interjection of another Body. Bituminous things, Coals, and other things dug
out of the Earth, also Vegetables and chiefly their Leaves, and Woods, are
burnt, for heat, necessary for human uses, and for the producing, and
conserving it. Stones are burnt for Lime; Vegetables for the preparing of
Salts. The flesh of Animals is wont to be Roasted, and the Fruits of Vegetables;
whereby they may become better food for men. For by Roasting, the superfluous
humidity is evaporated, and the Sulphurous parts being stirred by the
neighboring heat, are placed in their vigor and exaltation, by which means,
they afford a more grateful food to the Palate, and of better digestion to the
Stomach. By fire Metals are fused or melted, and most Minerals, whereby they
are either very much purified, or they are better formed into various figures
by Smiths. Metals, and very many Minerals, also Salts, although they are not
inflamed, and take a firing (because they abound with less Sulphur, than Salt)
yet by a violent fire, they glow, and suffer a fusion; for that the Sulphurous
Particles of the Fire, enter the Saline little Bodies, tho most compact, and
dissociate them for the time; which however pulled one from another, presently
the fire being exhaled, come again together, and are strictly united.

Secondly, when fire is mediatly administered, the Particles of the soluted
Sulphur, and heaped together into fire, are dissociated, as when a cloud is
dispersed into most little drops of Rain: wherefore they lay aside the form of
fire; but tho dispersed, they easily pass through any impediment, and induce a
sufficient strong heat to every Subject. By this means, fire is accommodated to
very many uses, the chief of which, and the more accustomed, are, elixation or
boiling, digestion, and distillation.

In Boiling, the Particles of heat do pass into a watery Menstruum, and being
united with its Particles, insinuate themselves deeply into the thing to be
boiled: whose superfluous humidities they carry away, digest the crudities, and
carry them into a state of maturity. Boiling is instituted, either that the
Liquor might be impregnated with the strength of the thing to be Boiled, or
that the thing to be Boiled might be made tender, by the Liquor entering into
it, and its Particles exalted: for Meats and all Eatable things, are rendered
more grateful to the Palate by Boiling, even as well as by Rosting.

Digestion is very much used in Medicines, that their more slow Particles, may
be carried to a greater activity; and sometimes, that they being too fierce
might be fixed, and rendered more mild.

The most noble use of heat, or of mediat fire, is had in distillations; for
the Particles of heat, do pull away some Particles of the Subject from others,
(as it were by a Spagyric Anatomy) they resolve all Bodies, into their parts
and principles. But the consideration of this thing, is too laborious and hard,
to be inserted into this Tract.

As heat respects the Sensory of the Touch, so Light that of the Sight, and
affects it so after a proper and peculiar manner, that nothing at all is
discerned, besides the rays of light, direct, or reflected: for the various
appearances of Colors, and the diverse proportions of Bodies, and whatsoever we
see with our Eyes, is only light; to wit, either proceeding directly, or strait
from a lucid Body, or retorted from another Body, to the Eye, and so formed
into various figures and colors. The consideration of Light, contains in it
self, very many stupendous things, and is of deep speculation; which are not
however proper for this place: It will suffice to take notice here, of a few
things, concerning its Original, Motion, and Perceptibility.

Light is wont to be distinguished, either that it is Etherial, which flows
from the Sun and Stars; or Elementary, which only proceeds from a fired Body,
enkindled into a flame. It seems, that either is only flame enkindled in a
greater dimension, and dilated into a most thin composition: for it appears to
the sense, that from Sulphurous things being inflamed, (as for example) from a
burning Candle, most thin Effluvia's, or most small divided little Bodies
perpetually do spring; which being diffused into an Orb, and stretched forth
into right Lines, as it were from the Center to the Circumference, are still
expanded on every side, in a great heap, and fill all the space within the
Sphere of its activity, with a luminous ray. The Particles of the flame, which
first fall away or depart from a lucid Body, are still driven forward by those
following behind; and so these also by others; and so by a continued Series of
Particles of the flames still succeeding, the beams of light are formed, and
are thickly or closly directed into all parts.

The motion of these is exceeding swift; like streams of water, breaking forth
with a force, they pass through the medium in the twinkling of an Eye, and, as
those waters, if the motion be cut off near the Spring, most swiftly vanish.
When the Rays of light come directly from a Luminous Body, they constitute a
medium, only clear or lucid, without the appearance of any color or image:
when the same Rays meet with a solid Body, they do not pass rightly through it,
but being either broken off, they are drowned or lost, or else they are
reflected and leap back or rebound, as when a Ball being cast against a Wall,
with a continued motion is struck back, upon other parts, according to the
Angles of what stopped it. The Rays of light, reflected from other Bodies,
being fallen into the Eye, represent the Images of visible things, and the
varieties of colors. For as the superficies of visible Bodies are rough, and
endued with little pores, and innumerable eminences, or risings up, hence the
Rays of light, being most thickly impacted in them, and reflected from every
part, according to all the ways of inclinations, and directions, as far as they
go, do meet together round about, into very many tops of Cones, in which the
beams proceeding from the whole object, as from a base, represent the image or
similitude of the whole; and in these kind of images, the medium is every where
planted, that wherever the Eye is placed, it beholds the image of the same
thing, though not wholly after the same manner. But forasmuch, as the beams of
the same light, being impacted in every Body, and variously refracted and
distorted, about its rough and unequal superficies, from thence reflected as it
were with turnings and windings into the Eye, they cause the diverse Phenomenon
or appearances of colors, to appear. For colous, and images of things, do not
exist in their own nature, but as it were spectrums, only from another place,
change their apparitions by the Rays of light. When dark night brings thick
darkness to this inferior world, things are not perceived but by the Touch, and
lose all their appearances: when the Sun revisits the Hemisphere, he brings
forth a new Creation of things; and the whole Atmosphere is filled at once,
with a sudden and manifold progeny, to wit, with infinite images of Bodies, and
appearances of colors.

Therefore Light does not only illustrate the medium, that sight may be made,
as some would have it; but it also creates the very objects of sight, and
introduces them into the Penetralia or inward parts of the Eye, yea to the most
inward recesses of the Brain. This does the same Office for the Eye, as the
Intellect does for the Soul, to wit, it forms the Ideas or Images of Bodies,
and renders them perceptible by the visive faculty. Light only is able to
penetrate the Coats and Humors of the Eye, to move the little Fibers of the
Optic Nerve, and to stir them up into an act of sensation. Because the Images
of things, being forged by the Rays of light, variously reflected, and meeting
together on the tops of the Cones, are stayed within the Pupil, or dark spot of
the Eye; they seem as objects in a close Chamber, admitted by a small hole, to
be represented to the life: and the Concave or Unequal Glasses, whereby the
parallel beams are broken, or the inverse reduced or brought back, do
egregiously supply the humors placed in the Eye, beyond the industry of human
Art; by the help of which, the image of every object is painted, near the thin
skin of the Eye, in its just figure and proportion: and then, from the motion,
which this Image impresses on the little Fibers of the Optic Nerve, the act of
sight is performed in the Brain. Thus much for Heat and Light, the Speculation
of which, tho it may seem to be altogether besides the Doctrine of
Fermentation, yet forasmuch as by the motion of these kind of Sulphurous
Particles, many other Physical Operations are also performed, a brief mention
of them ought not to have been overpass'd in this place. But before we shall
lay aside quite the consideration of Fire, it will be here worth our while to
inquire concerning some Subjects, as it were irregular, to wit, in which fire
shows admirable virtues, and beyond its common manner: of this sort, are among
Simples common Sulphur, and Sal Nitre; among Compounds, Gunpowder, and Aurum
Fulminans.

Concerning common Sulphur we may observe, that it quickly catches fire, heat
it immediately breaks forth into flame such (as nothing besides) that by its
deflagration it puts out the Kitchen fire, that it sends forth a blueish flame,
and whitens all objects with its Smoke or Soot. If you behold the matter of
this Subject, or the parts of which the mixture is composed, its Spagyrical
Analysis will exhibit, great plenty of pure Sulphur, a moderate quantity of
Vitriolic Salt, a little of Spirit, Water and Earth. For when common Sulphur is
dissolved, by the Spirit of Turpentine, the Sulphurous part impregnates the
Menstruum, with a very deep Tincture, and the Saline grows into Crystals: or
when it is fired under a Bell, the Sulphur wholly burns, in the mean time the
Salt being resolved, and having taken a Flux, is fixed about the sides of the
Vessel, and so exhibits a Liquor, most like the Spirit of Vitriol, or rather
the very same. To which add, if you mingle the Oil of Vitriol, and Antimony
together, and distill it in a Retort, a Yellow Sulphur, just like the common,
will be Sublimed in the neck of the Retort.

I say therefore, because there are very many Particles of Sulphur in this
Concrete, and that they lie loose and unbound in the mixture, (to wit, neither
divided and separated by the coming between of Earth, or Water, nor much bound
together by Salt) therefore they are of a most prompt motion: wherefore by the
least spark of fire, they break forth from the loose frame; and because very
many run forth adoors together, therefore not a naked fire, as in every
Combustible thing besides, but first of all and immediately a flame is
inkindled. Its flame becomes blueish, because it is almost pure Sulphur that
burns, not mixed with the Particles of Water and Earth, as it is in Wood or
Straw. The very same thing happens to Spirit of Wine being inflamed. It
extinguishes the Kitchen fire by reason of the little Bodies of Vitriolic Salt
left behind; and the same being eventilated with the flame and fume of Sulphur,
gives a white color to things; the like to which, the Effluvia's, exhaled from
the Spirit of Vitriol, or Stygian Waters, do effect.

Concerning Sal Nitre, we will take notice, that it is not to be inkindled at
all by it self; but to be melted by an intense fire: but being mixed with any
Sulphurous things, it breaks forth into a flame, with a certain force and
explosion: For being added to common Sulphur, Antimony, or Tartar, it burns
with a thundering noise; also if you put into melted Nitre, a burning Cole, or
Wood, the flame is exploded round about, with a wind, so that the matter put in
is flung up and down here and there, and often times flung clear out of the
Vessel: by this kind of deflagration, what is Nitrous is consumed, the fixed
Salt (which is Tartar) remains. When Nitre is distilled, Sand or Brick dust, is
mixed with it in a double quantity at least; otherwise the Nitre melting is not
at all loosened into a vapor. In the distilling the vapor sent forth is very
red; so that the Receptacle shines with a splendour, as if a flame were shut up
within it: a sharp corrosive Liquor is stilled forth, which dissolves most
Metals; also Gold.

These things being truly weighed, it seems that this mixture consists chiefly
of abundance of Salt, and a little Sulphur, but these not fixed and idle, but
either exalted, and ready for motion, and not without a certain resistance
bound together: to wit, the Sulphurous little Bodies, being rouled about by
the Saline, and as it were strictly pressed, still endeavor to get forth; but
being strictly bound within, they are not able to rise forth by their own
strength, or endeavor: but as soon as, by the mixture and inkindling of
another Sulphurous Body, the Particles of the Salt are disjoined, and their
Prisons unlocked, presently the included little Bodies of Sulphur, as it were
breaking Prison, fling themselves forth with violence, remove every Obstacle,
and strike the Air violently with a sudden eruption.

The reason why fire does not inkindle Nitre, being enclosed in a Vessel, but
only melts it, when in the mean time, any Sulphurous matter being fired, makes
it to flame forth with a noise, is, because the little Bodies, which fall away
from the fire, enter the Nitre, make it a little loose, and dissociate the
concretion of the Salt, but not so loosen it, that a way may be made for the
included Sulphur: but by the addition of Sulphurous things, the Saline
compaction is more dissolved, and is so far unlocked, that the Particles of the
enclosed Sulphur fly away all together, and being freed from their
straightness, do hugely stretch themselves abroad, and seek greedily an immense
space.

That there is plenty of Sulphur in Nitre, besides its deflagration, the
Genesis of it sufficiently testifies; for it is begot chiefly in places, where
the Sulphurous Excrements of Animals abound. The use of it in agriculture
argues the same thing, because the fertility of the Earth depends very much
upon it: And to this also, the flaming color, shining in the distilling may
persuade.

From these premises, it will not be difficult, to unfold the nature of
Gunpowder, used in Warlike Instruments. For the sudden firing, and vehement
explosion of it arise, for that those very many, and almost infinite Particles
of Sulphur, which constitute that fire-dilating Body, being fired, fly away
together in a moment; all which breaking forth at once, a force being made, and
desiring a most free and ample space, for their expansion, violently move the
Air, and all obstacles, and so are exploded or thrust forth with a noise. There
is in this mixture, common Sulphur put, because its Particles are loose, and
ready for motion, and therefore apt to move a quick inkindling: there is added
Charcoal dust, because in that also, the little Sulphurous Bodies (as is seen
in Tinder, that is made of half burnt Linen) are brought to the very top of
eruption; and therefore these presently conceive an inkindling, and both these
being fired, and opposed to the Nitre, they quickly loosen its frame, and send
forth the Sulphurous Particles enclosed in it; which indeed break forth from
their impediments with a force, and as the blast of a Bellows, increase the
strength of the whole in firing. The Charcoal dust is added in a moderate
quantity; though it abounds with Terrestrial matter, yet by reason of the
Sulphur being carried forth in it, it accelerates the deflagration of this
mixture: For the Coal and Nitre being beaten together, is sooner fired, and
with a greater explosion, than Nitre and Sulphur: But if the Coals be added to
this Composition, (as they are wont to make it for Cannon and great Guns) in a
greater quantity than it ought, and improportionate to the Nitre, the immediate
firing is somewhat retarded, by reason of the interjection of the Earthy matter;
and it happens, that the Sulphurous little Bodies therein, apt to be too
hastily inkindled, are a little disjoined, and so the substance of the infused
powder, takes fire successively, and by parts, and not all at once.

The reason of Aurum Fulminans does not so manifestly appear: but it seems
wonderful, that the Calx of a Metal, otherways inviolable by fire, should be
brought into a powder, one grane of which, if it be but lightly heated by fire,
is exploded with so great a force, and yields such a noise, that is an hundred
fold beyond Gunpowder. I know many deduce the cause of this, as in Gunpowder,
from a Nitrous-Sulphureous mixture: For they suppose the Nitre drawn forth from
the solvent Menstruum, to join together with the Sulphur of the Metal, and so
the powder from thence prepared, to get that fulminating force. But in truth,
if this matter be better thought on, it will appear far otherways; because this
golden thundering powder, is not at all inkindled, as preparations of Nitre with
Sulphur: for if fire be put to it, it goes off only successively, by grains,
nor as in Gunpowder, does the whole fulminate at once; but being put into an
Iron, Silver, or other convenient Vessel, and for some time heated, by a sudden
fire, at length all the Particles being stirred together into motion, it is
exploded with a mighty noise; but yet being explosed, it yields neither flame
nor sparks neither is the Gold lost. For if this powder fulminates in an open
Vessel; whatsoever is of the Gold, remains after the thundering, in the form of
a purple powder; and may be gathered up. That the genuine cause of this may be
extricated, there are some things to be observed, concerning its preparations,
which will give no small light.

For the making of this powder, it is altogether requisite, that a solution of
Gold be made with a Menstruum, impregnated with Sal Armoniack, or at least
Analogical to it: for I have tried it in vain with the Spirit of Nitre, Salt,
with the Bezoartic Spirit, and some others. Then next it is requisite, that the
Calx be precipitated with Oil of Tartar; for if the same be brought into a
powder, with Silver or Mercury being cast in, it loses its thundering force.
Also, if the Liquor of the Tartar, be too precipitately poured in, that with
the great heat, a repercussion of the thing soluted be made, it often loses its
fulminating virtue: but a precipitation being leisurely made, the powder
settling in the bottom is washed away, by the often pouring on of warm water,
which, though it be most often washed and dried, far exceeds the weight of the
dissolved Gold.

According to these positions, in seems most likely, that whilst the Gold is
dissolved by an appropriate Menstruum for this business, some little Bodies of
Sal Armoniack, (or some other resembling it) being greatly akin to the Gold, do
most strictly cohere with its Particles; which then by the Salt of Tartar
leisurely in the precipitating infused, are more fixed, and more strictly tied
fast together: and then the explosion of this powder, or Solary Calx, is
nothing else than a violent eruption of those kind of Salts, from the Cohesion
or Embrace of the Gold. For when the powder prepared after this manner; is
brought to the fire, or is otherways made hot: the heat causes the
Sal-Armoniack Particles, or others of the same nature affixed to the Solar, to
dissociate; which notwithstanding, (when they hardly depart one from another)
are not pulled asunder but by a strong and continued heat: yet afterward being
pulled asunder with a certain force, by reason of the sudden and violent
breaking off, they strike the Air impetuously, and so cause a most strong
noise, for their bulk. But in the mean time, if the explosion be made under a
Silver Spoon, you will see a separation made of either Particles, here the
Solar of a Purple color, there the Saline of an Ash color. But that this
powder does not make a noise, unless it be leisurely precipitated with the Oil
of Tartar, it is because some Particles of the Salt of Tartar, being before
bound together with the Sal-Armoniac Particles, do couple together, by which
means all are more strongly combined: For the Salt of Tartar being pounded with
the mixture of Nitre and Sulphur fixes their Particles for a time; that this
Composition is not presently inkindled by heat; but afterward is exploded with
a strong noise. And powder prepared after this manner seems to imitate the
Nature of Aurum Fulminans: and it is probable that from other Minerals
dissolved and precipitated by reason of the strict Cohesions of the Salt with
the Metallic matter, and their violent abruptions, thundering Calxes may be
prepared. That truly the preparation of this chiefly depends on the Combination
of the Salts, it appears, because, if in the Precipitating (as I have known it
sometimes to have happened) the Oil of Tartar, being too hastily infused, the
Complexion of the Salts is dissolved with the Metallic matter, the powder falls
in small quantity to the bottom, and of a very Purple color, whose grains are
fragments of almost most pure Gold, and therefore they do not fulminate at all:
afterward in that precipitated Liquor, very many slender Crystals grow
together, which are indeed the Salts, having suffered a Divorce from the Metal.
Besides, That the Salt of Tartar, brings something to the preparation of this
powder, it is a sign, because those things which take away the fulminating
force from this, are of the same Nature, which chiefly work upon the Salt of
Tartar; as a beating it together with common Sulphur, Spirit of Salt, Oil of
Vitriol, or of Sulphur: for these grow hot, and greedily desire to be joined
with the Salt of Tartar, and so they call it away from the Embraces of the
Gold; by which means the Combination of the Salts, with the Particles of the
Gold, is loosned, and therefore loses its Gun-like force. What is commonly
said, that this powder will be presently inkindled, or exploded, by a most
light heat, or by shaking it in an Iron Ladle, is nothing true, as appears to
me, for I have often tried it. Nor is it more worthy of belief, what is said,
that this only forces downwards, and breaks the thickest hollow Pipes with its
force; in the mean time, that it does not move or shake any thing laid over it,
because long since I made trial after this manner; two grains of this being
laid in a Silver Spoon, I covered with a Doller, then a Candle being held under
the Spoon, upon the explosion of the powder, there followed a great noise, and
there was a little hollow made in the bottom of the Spoon, almost through, and
the piece of money was carried up with a force to the Cieling, wherefore, when
this Aurum Fulminans is explosed, its force is diffused round.

Although vehement heat, and incited, and also the emission of Smoke and Soot,
depends for the most part upon fire; yet sometimes we perceive it to be produced
in some subjects, and that in a very high degree, without its being actually
inkindled. A most known instance of which thing is, quick Lime sprinkled with
water: which also Stygian waters show, being mingled with Iron, the Butter of
Antimony, and with the Salts of the stagma of Vegetables. The learned men,
Gunter, Conringius, Hogelandus, and almost all that have touched on the
Doctrine of Fermentation, have delivered the effects of this Nature, as
especial examples of Fermentations, wherefore it will be worth our labor, to
inquire something concerning each of them: but on this condition (which I also
have observed in other disquisitions) that I willingly let alone the opinion of
others; for a Traveller had rather drink at the Fountains themselves: I will
then as briefly and succinctly as I can dispatch the business.

Quicklime is made of the Lime Stone, also of many others (excepting only such
which consist of a reddish and as it were sandy grain) being Calcined in a
close Furnace, for many days, with a reverberating fire: by this means, the
frame of the mixture is loosned, that it goes into a friable matter, or that
may be crumbled, which by reason of the high astriction or binding Nature, in
which it excels, serves most excellently for the making of Cements for Walls:
This Calx or Lime being taken from the Furnace, reteins still the form of
Stone, and seems cold to the touch, but water being poured thereon, it swells
up, and grows wonderfully hot, sending forth smoke, that it burns all Bodies
that are put into it, besides it falls of it self into a white dust: To which
Particles this motion and heat ought to be ascribed, viz. whether to those
implanted in the Lime stone, or to the others acquired by the fire, does not
easily appear: but that we may loose this knot, if we can, I have instituted
this Analysis of quick Lime. I put about half a pound of it into a large
Cucurbit, then water being poured thereon, I fitted the little Head with a
capacious Receiver, by and by, within five minutes of an hour, the matter began
to swell, and to grow very hot; then a smoke, and a breath being raised, all
the Vessels became so hot, that I could scarce touch them with my hands. A
clear water Distilled forth into the Receiver, about six Ounces, which was not
sharp, but of a Styptic or Astringent sweetish taste; the remaining powder in
the Cucurbit, I boiled with common water, and the Lie thereof made, I
endeavored to boil away with a gentle Fire; while it did evaporate, there
gathered together on the Superfices of the Liquor, a white and crusty little
skin, also of a sweetish taste, and the same being taken away, presently a new
one succeeded; the humor being at last wholly exhaled, there remained in the
bottom nothing that was sharp or salt.

We may Collect from this, that this heat does not proceed from the implanted
Principles of the Lime stone, viz. either Saline or Sulphurous however moved
within themselves: for only a sweetish Salt was to be found in it, which was
also Volatile; and it is a sign that there is not much Sulphur in the
Limestone, because by a long Calcination, the form of the mixture is not quite
destroyed, nor its substance wholly broken: wherefore, it is very likely, that
whilst these stones are burnt in the Furnace, some Particles of Fire do
strictly cleave to the Saline, and so reside in that mixture, as it were
strangers; which whilst they lie a sleep, and continue idle, and being
separated one from another, by the coming between of Earth, although they are
very many, do not raise up heat; For all heat depends upon motion: but when
water is poured to it, those fiery Particles, being thrust out of their Cells,
flow together, and fly aways by heaps from that Inn; so breaking forth by
Troops, they cause a very intense heat, and because diluted with water, only a
smoke, and not an actual Fire.

It is a sign that little Bodies of fire, or fiery Particles, do stick a long
while in matters Calcined, because Iron Instruments, according as those
Particles are driven forth of their pores, more or less, leisurely or by heaps,
become soft or hard; tough or brittle: moreover it is observed, that bricks or
fresh Earthen Vessels being dipped in water, cause a certain hissing; also
Tobacco Pipes, if one end be put into water, and the other brought near to the
Ear, yield a certain sharp noise and rumbling: add to these, that fixed Salts
being Calcined, or having suffered a Flux by the Fire, become far sharper; also
Stygian waters, by reason of those kind of little Bodies involved therein,
which afterward leisurely evaporate, perpetually send forth sharp fumes: and
when these are poured upon Saline Calxes, not only an Ebullition is raised, by
reason of the disagreeing Particles of the Salts, which strike one another
mutually, whereby they might be more strictly combined; but besides, heat and
smoke succeed, which for the most part arise from the fiery Particles being
shuck out of their Dens. But it is not easy to give a reason why quick Lime,
and no other Concretes, retain so copiously those kind of fiery Particles, and
yield a strong heat, water being poured on them.

It Is plain enough that when the Sulphurous Effluviums of Fire, (forasmuch as
they are most penetrating) enter all Bodies whatsoever, brought near, affect
them after diverse manners: those which are more lax, and stuffed with active
Principles, are destroyed wholly by burning, and because their substance
decays, the fiery Particles, as Soldiers in a City spoiled by themselves, do
not continue long in the ruined place, but go farther, and move their Tents:
but where the Concretion of the Subject is very compact, and that its Elements
cannot be so pulled in pieces by the fire, that they rather grow stiff, as is
seen in Metals, Glass, Bricks, and other things made hard, either by boiling,
or fusion; the fiery Particles entered in, being received in an incommodious
Inn, presently go forth again; and therefore few are wont to stay in mixed
things of this kind, or in things fused, or Calcined: but if fire be so applied
to the more hard Concretes, of which sort are most stones, and shelly
Concretes, that the bond of the mixture be unlocked, some parts, viz. the
Watery and Sulphurous are driven away, and so some spaces are made hollow,
very fit for the receiving any stranger; in the mean time, that the frame of
the matter be not wholly destroyed, but that it may continue its compacted and
stony form, which flows not away together with its Particles, and ever
threatens its ruin; in such a Subject, chiefly the Particles of fire,
possessing the spaces of the parts flown away, copiously remain; and there
cleaving close to the Saline little Bodies, being detained one from another, by
the coming between of the earthy, lie quiet; which notwithstanding afterward,
being violently driven from those Inns, are able to produce by their eruption,
an intense, and almost fiery heat: in the mean time those Saline little Bodies,
are so loosned, by the long familiarity of the fiery, and by the embrace of one
another, and of the strangers, that they become Volatile, and being diluted
with water, for the greatest part evaporate with it; and the remaining Salt,
because also Volatile, and having suffered almost a divorce from all the rest
of the Principles, is both sweetish, and becomes desirous of Conjunction, and
astringent; and therefore also is of excellent use for plastring of Walls.

But that Stygian waters, being poured upon the Stagmas of fixed Salts, produce
heat, and the same mixed with Iron, or the Butter of Antimony, stir up a mighty
ardor, with a blackning smoke, the reason seems plain. As to the Stygian waters
and fixed Salts, it may be said that both these Concretes are only Salts,
having got diverse states by the fire, and so either being very much stuffed
with fiery Particles (which are the most minute atoms of Sulphur:) But they
being confused together, do forthwith rush into mutual embraces, and because
the Particles of either, are made unlike, therefore, whereby they may be more
strictly united, there is made a great attrition of parts, and together an
excussion of the fiery Particles, from whence the great ebullition, with a heat
is excited: when the same Menstrua, are poured on Iron, or the Ice of Antimo,
the Salts of either come together, and shake forth the fiery Particles, and
also the Sulphurous Particles, before implanted in either Subject; which
flying away in heaps, cause a smoke with a heat, but not a flame.

CHAP. XI. Of the motion of Fermentation, as it is to be observed, in the
Precipitation of Bodies.
WE have hitherto treated of the Solutions of Bodies; it remains now that we
speak of Precipitation, this is performed only in Liquids, which, when as they
are stuffed with Heterogeneous Particles, are compelled by a matter
Precipitating those Particles, to separate one from another, and to obtain for
their substance, diverse places and conditions: wherefore, since in this
operation, there is an agitation and motion of parts, its consideration ought
to be referred to the Doctrine of Fermentation.

Precipitation is performed, either in Natural things, as chiefly in Milk,
Blood, Urine, and perhaps in some others; or in Artificial things, which are of
a diverse Kind and Nature: but they may be described and ranked in a certain
order, according as the Liquor to be Precipitated, or Precipitating, is either
Spirituous, Sulphurous, Watery, or Saline: besides, according as the Particles
separated from the rest, are either Elementary, ( viz. either Sulphurous,
Earthy, or Saline) or Integral, which participate of the Nature of the whole
mixture, and are only very small portions of it very much broken.

There are two common and known ways of Precipitation, whereby is made from
Milk, both Cheese, and Butter: As to the first, if any sharp thing be poured
into warm Milk, the thicker and Cheesie parts, presently separate from the
serous and thinner, and are gathered together into a thick substance. The
reason of which consists in this: Milk has a somewhat thick consistence, and its
pores and passages are very much beset, with the thicker (to wit the Cheesie)
contents; wherefore when something more subtle and penetrating, (as is Rennet)
passes through the Liquor, it easily thrusts forth the more thick Particles,
with which the pores were possessed; which then mutually Embrace one another,
and are separated a part from the thin, and Wheyie Liquor. When Milk is kept
long to a sourness, it is Precipitated after the same manner, without Rennet,
by warming it over the fire. For in stale Milk its Saline parts get a Flux,
then being stirred up by the fire, supply by their own sourness the turn of
Rennet, yea it is not improbable that the fluid Salt in the Rennet provokes the
Saline Particles of the Milk, into a Flux, and that for this reason chiefly its
Coagulation succeeds: for that the Saline parts having gotten of their own
accord a Flux, so bind the pores of the Liquor, that the more thick Contents
are willingly exterminated from them: wherefore we do say, for that reason, the
same thing happens, when a Flux of the same Salt is caused by some thing else
put into it. But that the Coagulation of Milk happens not only by reason of the
passages and pores being possessed by a strange Body, the sign is; because the
Salt of Tartar, tho exceeding Precipitatory, effects nothing of this, and this
effect is excited almost only by sour things. Sugar hinders the Precipitation
of Milk, and many other Liquors, because it restrains the Flux of the Acetous
Salt, and as it is easily Soluble, and its Particles are soft and blunt, they
extrude not the former Contents implanted in the Liquor, but fill all
vacuities, that afterward there is no space whereby another Precipitating
Liquor may unfold it self, and break into another quarters.

But Country people are wont to make Butter of the Flowers or Cream of Milk,
kept for the most part to a sourness, only by shaking or Churning it. The
reason of which (as it seems to me) is this: in Cream there is great plenty of
Sulphur, with which also a mean portion of Salt and Earth is mixed, as may be
conjectured, both by the sourness of the Liquor remaining of the Butter, or the
Butter-Milk, and by its thicker consistency. In this mixture, the parts both
Saline and Sulphurous are in motion, and a Flux: but as the Liquor is thicker
they cannot presently fly away: wherefore it remains, that if the bond of the
mixture be further loosned, they will separate into parts, and that first the
Sulphurous Particles, which exceed the others in power, are Congregated
together with a mutual embrace; wherefore these two things, the Churning of the
Cream performs, viz. it brings the Sulphurous parts by their often obvolution
together, whereby they do the better entangle themselves, and mutually ensnare
one another; besides it breaks their mixture with the rest. For this reason, in
the Winter time, (when Cream is thinner, and abounds less with Sulphur) Butter
is hardly made. Besides the admixtion of Salt or Sugar wholly hinders its
making; because by the coming between of those little Bodies, the Sulphurous
parts are hindered, from a mutual adhesion.

The chief Precipitation of the blood, which is performed within a living Body,
is made in the Reins; where, not without the strength of a certain Coagulum or
Rennet, the serous matter is separated from the rest of the blood; just as Whey
from Milk: For which reason Diuretical things are of the same Nature, as those
which bring a Coagulation to Milk; and therefore, because they more Precipitate
the blood by fusing it, they cause a large profusion of urine. The blood being
sent forth of the Vessels, separates into various substances, by its own
disposition: whilst it is warm, it is variously Precipitated, by some Liquors
poured to it, (in like manner Urine) not without a pleasant Spectacle. If you
pour upon warm blood the spirit of Wine, Hearts Horn, Soot, Vitriol, or other
Liquors, chiefly Spirituous or Saline, a wonderful Ebullition, and heat is
stirred up; whence we may conjecture after what manner it grows turgid, in
Fevers. But before the rest. the Salt of Tartar, and a Solution of Alum,
procure both in Blood and in Urin, a great perturbation of the Liquor, and
falling down of the parts: for these disturb all the Contents in the pores and
passages of the Liquor, and by their astriction, very much lock them up for a
long time.

Precipitation in Artificial things is of greater note and use: for this for
the most part follows Dissolutions, and succeeds them as it were by a certain
right of Order; because this takes out of their Jaws, and as it were lays by,
the prey, which all Menstrua take by dissolving. According to the diversity of
the Menstruum, and of the Body dissolved, Precipitation also variously happens:
but in some Subjects there are two chief remarkable things, concerning the
manner of Precipitation, to wit, the soluted Particles, immersed in the pores
and passages of the Menstruum, are wont to fall out of them; either by reason
of the narrowness of the containing space, or else by reason of the Contents
being increased in weight and bigness: for in some the pores of the Solvent,
being either leisurely bound up, or beset with a strange Body, shut forth from
their Cells, the little Bodies of the thing soluted, and send them to the
bottom; as may be observed in Sulphurous Solutions, or such as are made of the
whole mixture of integral parts, in a thin Liquor; which are disturbed, and lay
away their Contents by external cold, simple water, or at least by any Acid
infusion. After this manner resinous Tinctures, also of Sulphur, Olibanum,
Benzoin, and the infusions and decoctions of Vegetables, also Urin, Milk, and
Blood, are wont to be Precipitated: but in several others, besides that the
pores, and passages of the Menstruum, are either leisurely drawn together, or
possessed by a new guest, also something new grows to the Particles of the thing
soluted from the Precipitating matter, whereby being increased in weight and
bulk, they can be no longer sustained; but that they are necessitated to sink
to the bottom. This is chiefly seen in the Saline Solutions of Minerals, which
are only Precipitated by the Salts; whose Particles presently cleave to the
little Bodies of the thing soluted, and increase their substance, that
presently they descend to the bottom by their own weight: For in Saline
solutions, the little Bodies of the thing soluted, are strictly bound together
by the fluid Menstruum, with the Saline Particles; and the Particles run
hastily and are heaped together into the Embraces of the same fluid Salt, from
the Precipitating infusion of the fixed Salt: wherefore, when these three, (to
wit, the little Bodies of either Salt, and of the soluted matter) do cohere
together, they constitute greater grains than can be contained in the narrow
spaces of the Menstruum, and therefore being thrust out, they fall down toward
the bottom: That this does truly happen after this manner, the great affinity,
both of the fluid and fixed Salt, is a sign; that the Particles of both being
placed near or mixed together, are presently combined in one: also, because
many solutions of Minerals, are presently Precipitated by a fixed Salt, but not
by Vitriol or Alum being put in, which do much more bind, and stop up the pores
of the Liquor. Thirdly, it appears clearly even to sense, because that the
matter put for a Precipitate, far exceeds the thing soluted in bulk and weight,
and is impregnated by the fixed Salt adhering to it, But these being thus
disposed, we will descend to the particular cases of Percipitations, forasmuch
as Precipitation is made manifold, to wit, according to the diversity of the
Menstruum, of the soluted matter, and the Precipitating infusion.

Simple water, though it do not well sustain the Particles of the mixture which
it receives into it self by infusion, or Cohesion, yet hardly sends them away
by Precipitation. For the pores of this Menstruum are too open and loose,
wherefore the Precipitating matter, does not easily strike the little Bodies of
the thing soluted: in the mean time, by reason of the more loose frame of the
Menstruum, some parts of the soluted Body sink down; others of their own accord
evaporate, from whence that Liquor does not long keep the Virtues or Tincture,
with which they are impregnated by another. As some more thick parts and
Terrestrial may be thrust down to the bottom, or otherways separated, we put in
the Juice of Limons, or some acid thing, or boil in it the whites of Eggs, to
wit, that whatsoever is thick might cleave to their viscous substance.

Spirituous and Sulphurous Menstrua, being impregnated with the Sulphurous
Particles of the thing soluted, easily lay by their burden; for they are
Precipitated by common, or any Distilled water; as is seen in Sulphurous and
Resinous Tinctures of Sulphur, Scammony, Benzoin, Frankincense, and others of
that kind prepared by the Spirit of Wine, or Oil of Turpentine, which presently
grow Milky, by Water or Phlegm being infused. For in these sort of solutions,
the pores are wholly possessed, that they admit nothing besides the thing
soluted, and besides, both the Liquor, and soluted Matter are so thin, that
they easily give place to any thing else being infused.

When Menstruas of this kind are filled with Saline Particles, as we may
observe in the Tinctures of the Salt of Corrals, of Tartar and such like,
Precipitation does not presently succeed from common water, but from an Acid
Liquor, as the Spirit of Vitriol, Salt, etc.

Saline Menstruas impregnated by the solutions of Stones or Metals, are most
easily Precipitated by Saline Particles, and scarce by others. The chief
Precipitatory Liquor, is the Salt of Tartar, or of Herbs burnt to Ashes,
deliquated or melted; for this strikes back the Particles of every soluted
thing whatsoever, and sends them headlong to the bottom; to wit, forasmuch, as
it passes through every where, the little spaces of the solvent, and sticking
to the Contents, increases them in bulk, that they more easily fall out of the
pores of the Menstruum, bound also together with their own weight.

What fluid Salt (as Vinegar, Stygian waters, etc.) dissolves, the same a fixed
Salt precipitates; and on the contrary: because Salt of Tartar being melted,
most excellently penetrates common Sulphur, and receives the Tincture; which
then is precipitated by a fluid Salt, viz. by the Spirit of Vitriol, and the
like: which indeed does not happen, by reason of the disagreeing Particles of
the Salts, and mutually opposing one another; but for that the same are greatly
of kin, and rush into mutual Embraces: for from hence, the little grains of the
thing soluted, by reason of the cohering of both the Salts together, being
increased in bulk and weight, are more readily thrust out of the little spaces
of the Menstruum, and descend to the bottom. We will in this place, more
sparingly insist upon instances of this nature, because the more full handling
of them belongs to the Chemical Work.

Precipitation is not only observed in the separation of a more thick matter,
from a serous latex, and in the settling of the disturbed parts toward the
bottom; but sometimes the Particles shut up within the pores and passages of the
Liquor, are so small and subtle, that being Precipitated, they are not
discerned by the sight, neither do they quickly descend to the bottom; but from
their situation and position, being variously changed, the color, and
consistency of the Liquor, are diversely altered. I was wont in times past, to
sport with the solutions of Vegetables and Minerals, which being made by
themselves, were clear like Spring water, and appeared bright, being commixed,
showed now a Black color, now a Milky, Red, Green, Blue, or some other kind.
The solution of Saturn, (or Lead) being made with distilled Vinegar, appears
bright like common water, if you add to this Oil of Tartar, like clear water,
the mixture straight grows White like Milk. If Antimony calcined with Nitre, be
boiled in Spring water, the straining seems clear, and almost without smell,
which yet being dashed by any Acid thing, presently acquires a deep yellow
color, with a most wicked stink. Common water being imbued by an infusion of
Mercury Sublimate, is presently tinged with yellowness, by Oil of Tartar
dropped into it. Quicksilver and Sal Armoniack, being beaten together, and
Sublimated in a Matrace by the heat of Sand, go into a white powder, this being
soluted by melting shows like to clear Spring water, which yet being smeared
upon Brass or Copper, appears like Silver; and being lightly rubbed on brazen
Vessels, renders them as if they were perfectly silvered. A solution of
Calcined Tin, being put to melted Salt of Tartar becomes bluish. A clear
infusion of Galls, being mixed with a solution of Vitriol, makes Ink; if you add
to this Spirit of Vitriol, or Stygian water, the black Liquor is by and by made
clear like Spring water; and this Oil of Tartar reduces again to Ink. And what
is more wonderful, if you write on Paper with the clear infusion of Vitriol,
and frame any Letters; what you so write presently vanishes, nor is there any
marks of the Characters left: but if you smear over the Paper with an infusion
of Galls, presently the Letters may be read, as if wrote with Ink; which yet,
with a Pen run over, dipped in Spirit of Vitriol, you may put quite out at once
wetting, and then again render them, with wetting them with another Liquor of
Tartar. The Sky-colour Tincture of Violets, being dashed with Oil of Vitriol,
becomes of a Purple color: to which, if you add some drops of the Spirit of
Hearts Horn, that Purple color is changed into Green. Brasil Wood, being
infused in common water, leaves a very pleasant Tincture, like to Claret Wine;
if you pour to this a little distilled Vinegar, the Liquor appears clear like
White Wine: a few drops of Oil of Tartar reduces it to a deep Purple color:
then if the Spirit of Vitriol be poured in, it becomes of a pale yellow, like
to Sack; if you add the Salt of Lead, being soluted by deliquation, the mixture
grows presently Milky: by this means you may imitate that famous Water-drinker,
who having swallowed down a great deal of Spring water, was wont to vomit forth
into Glasses placed before him, diversely colored Liquors, resembling the ideas
of diverse kinds of Wines: for Glasses being medicated with the aforesaid
Tinctures, (so lightly that they may not be perceived by the standers by) will
not only cause the water poured into them, to imitate every Wine, but will
exhibit the very Proteus himself of the Poets, changed into waters, and from
thence putting on all colors, and infinite forms.

If a Reason of these kind of appearances be asked, it ought to be fought in
the minute Particles, contained within the pores of every Liquor; which as to
their site and position, being diversely altered, by another Liquor infused,
transmit variously the Rays of Light, many ways break or reflect them, and so
make diverse appearances of colors. For when the Rays of Light pass through
almost in right Lines, they make a clear color like Spring water; but it in
their passage, they be a little broken, the Liquor grows yellowish; but being
more refracted, they cause a red color; if they are bowed back, so as to be
drained, or that they cannot show themselves, a dark or black color arises;
but if they are again reflected, to the outmost Superficies of the Liquor, they
create the image of Whiteness: after this manner we might variously
Philosophise about other colors, and their appearances, the diversity of
which, and sudden alterations in Liquids, depend chiefly on Precipitation:
because, as the Particles contained in the Liquor, are driven sometimes more
near by another infusion that they clasp themselves together; sometimes are
ordered into other series of positions, the diverse representation of colors
is made. For Liquor being impregnated with little Bodies or Atoms, or this
Nature, most minutely broken, seems as an Army of Soldiers placed in their
Ranks, who now draw into close Order, now open their Files and Ranks, now turn
to the left, now to the right hand, as is diversely shown in the exercising of
Tacticks, or the Art Military. When two clear Liquors being mixed together
shall make Ink, it is because the Particles contained in either, approach near
one another, and as it were placed in their close Orders hinder the passage of
the beams of light: when afterward, this Ink is made clear by another Liquor
poured in, it is because the new Bodies of the thing put in, disperse abroad
the former close joined Particles, and drive them as it were into their open
Orders.

CHAP. XII. Of the motion of Fermentation, as it is to be observed in the
Coagulation, and the Congelation of Bodies.
COagulation and Congelation of Natural Bodies, no less than their Solution,
depend only on these our Principles. The improportionate mixture of these, and
the exaltation, and powerfulness of some above others, are the cause of either.
Spirit and Sulphur being loosned from the bond, do not only pull assunder the
proper Subjects, but they set upon whatever is next them; and where they are
mighty in number and strength, they affect nothing more than divorces and
separations from the rest of the Principles, and suffer no delay: but on the
contrary, Salts love to be united to the rest, and to be made into hard and
solid substances; and being destitute of the Company of the rest, presently to
enter into new Friendships, and desire only not to be joined to any opposite.
If at any time they are more impetuously moved, either by their own
disposition, or being soluted, they destroy the substance of others, this thing
seems to be done for this end, destinated as it were by Nature, that they might
find out Subjects agreeable to themselves, and having through War obtained
Peace, they might at length be more strictly united to them: wherefore when
Saline Menstruums corrode Stones or Metals, they are Coagulated with their
Particles, and grow together into diversely figured Crystals.

When we here treat of Coagulation, we do not take this word after the usual
manner: to wit, as it is wont to be vulgarly usurped, when Milk is become
congealed, that is, departs from its simple and equal Liquor into Heterogeneous
substances, viz. Cheese, or Curds and Whey, or thick and thin; in like manner,
when blood or other humors go into parts after that manner, they are said to be
coagulated: also, we have elsewhere given this sense, to this word, tho to
speak properly, these sort of motions ought rather to be referred to
Precipitation than to Coagulation. But here we would have to be understood, by
the term Coagulation, an alteration in Bodies of the same kind, as when things
at first tender and soft, grow hard, into a stiff, and as it were stony matter:
or any thing is said to coagulate, when Saline little Bodies being dispersed
abroad in any Subject, begin to be congregated and joined together, and from
thence united, either among themselves or with Earth, produce out of a soft and
fluid substance, a hard and compacted. This may be perceived in the shells
clearly stony, of Fruits and Seed; in Bones and Horns of living Creatures, in
Shells and Shelly scurffs of Fishes; all which indeed very much abound with an
Alcali Salt, or the same Volatilized. Among Handicrafts, or preparations from
human Industry, the Crystalisation, Vitrification of Salts, or making of Glass,
also the baking of Pots and Earthen ware, ought to be referred to Coagulation.

But it is properly called Congelation, when the Saline Particles, coming from
elsewhere, strictkly bind together the Subjects on which they fall, fix the
Particles variously moved within the substance of the mixture, and gather them
together, that by that means the whole becomes stiff, and as it were stony. We
may behold these kind of effects in Ice and Frost, by which soft Mud, or fluid
Springs of waters grow stiff, into a very Marble substance. Also the same is
manifestly beheld, among the Operations of Art, in the confusions of some
Salts, and mutual Concretion in Sublimating; by which means, they go into a
substance, now like to Ice, now to Snow. To which may be added the Artificial
turning of water to Ice, which is performed by the mixture of Salt and Snow;
but the instances which we have remarked in either of these, about the Works of
Art, we will in this place briefly run through, and a little consider the
reasons of them, and the ways of being done.

The Crystalisation of Salts, is procured after this manner; Salts of every
kind are thoroughly dissolved in common water, and their Particles being
dispersed through the whole mass of the Liquor, wholly disappear; afterward,
if this liquor be somewhat evaporated, that its passages and pores be something
bound together, the little Bodies of the Salt close one with another, and
mutually take hold of themselves, and join together, the outward cold binding
them, and are figured in the midst of the water, into Crystals proper to their
Nature. By this means Sal Nitre into Pyramids, Sea Salt into Cubes, Alum into
eight cornered Figures, Sal Armoniack into six cornered, and other Salts are
formed into other Figures of their own accord, after a constant manner.

If the Reason of this be sought after, we say that these kind of Salts are not
simple Elements, but Bodies made up of abundance of Salt, with the other
Elements mixed with them in small quantity; which even as other Natural
Concretes, are allotted by the first Creator, peculiar manners of figurations,
according to the surpassing strength of Salt and Spirit, and commixion with the
rest. For in determining the Figures of Natural Bodies, Spirit and Salt are as
the Rule and Compass in describing Mathematical Figures: Spirit, as the
moveable Foot of the Compass, or as a Pensil in the hand of an Artist,
variously excurs and draws here and there diverse fashioned lineaments. But
salt (as the applied Rule) moderates the excursions of the other, and
determinates them, and restrains them within the confines designed by Nature:
when the Spirit is more powerful than the Salt, there happens a greater variety
in the Figuration of things, as in Vegetables and Animals; because the Spirit
running forth more largely, forms very many Marks of its Pourtracture, and
describes Bodies not in right Lines, but intorted, and very much variegated.
Where the Salt Lords it over the Spirit, as in Mineral Concretes, and chiefly
Saline; Bodies grow together in less adorned Figures, and are accounted the
first and more simple, and of that sort, as the Mathematical descriptions in
right Lines or Circles. For those Salts, are as it were second Elements; and
from the implanting of them in Bodies, the proper and native Figures of things,
very much depend; and therefore they themselves are primitively imbued by
Nature with a certain Elementary Configuration, (so that according to Plato,
God in truth exercises Geometry) and the first regular Figures are formed in
the more simple, that things compounded of them, might arise furnished with all
manner of variety of figures.

The fixed Salts of Herbs being prepared by Calcination, because they are
almost destitute of the Fellowship of Spirits, do scarce go at all into
Crystals, nor are they coagulated, but by a long evaporation. Sea Salt
containing a very little Spirit, with great Labor goes into Cubes. Next to
this Alum, guifted with a little more Spirit, is more easily coagulated, and
grows into more elaborate Figures, viz. eight cornered. Sal Nitre, swelling
with spirit, is most easily coagulated, and is framed into a more perfect
Figure, viz. Pyramidical; which consists of both Spherical, and Right Lines.
But Volatile Salt, (such as is distilled out of Urine, Blood, and the Horns of
living Creatures) being associated with a plentiful Spirit, is drawn into
Concretes, very much varying, which imitate now the Horns of Staggs, now the
Figures of Plants. Out of Mercury, with Salt, or the Calx of Silver, by an
Amalgama, in the midst of the waters a Silver Tree is formed, with Stock, Trunk
and Branches, painted to the Life. It is a usual thing in the Winter time, for
the Air, impregnated with Saline Vapors, and fallen on the Glass Windows, to be
condensed into most fair Figures of Trees and Woods. So much for the
Crystallisation of Salts: The other Species of Coagulation, is Vitrification,
of which we will speak next.

Vitrification (which is also said to be the last mutation of Bodies, of which
Nature is capable, and from which there is no going back) depends upon a fused
Salt, and united to an Earthy matter, even to its smallest Particle: for when
either matter is fused, by a most vehement fire, and divided in its smallest
parts, the Bodies of either, being put into a Flux, are by so strict a marriage
joined together, that afterward they are never to be pulled assunder.

There are many ways, and diverse provisions of Vitrification, to wit, of Sal
Alcali, with Sand or a sandy matter fused together by a violent fire, common
Glass is made; which is transparent, both by reason of the abundance of Salt,
and of the clearness of the Sand; for if you behold the little Sands of which
Glass is made, with a Microscope, each of their little Globes appear, (as they
were Glassie Gems) clear and shining. Wherefore Salt promotes the fusion of
that clear matter by fire, and then is admitted into its most strict embraces
being fused.

Besides Glasses of diverse Colors and Consistences are made of Minium, the
Calx of Tinn, Antimony, and some other Minerals, (when the Sulphurous part
does first fly away) fused, now by themselves, now with Flint or Sandy matter.
The reason of all which consists in this; that Salt and Earth, being most
smally broken by a violent fusion of fire, and being divided as to their least
Particles, catch hold of one another, and so are bound together, by the most
strict bond of the mixture. The Coalition or Coupling of these, is never to be
dissolved, because there is wanting within in the mixture, other Principles,
which might unlock the frame of the Subject: yea Salt and Earth, being joined
by the mediating fire, do so intimately cohere, that they affect not divorces
of themselves, nor suffer them from another.

The baking of Earthen Pots and Bricks, is of kin to Vitrification (or making
of Glass) whereby moist and soft Clay is stifned into a very stony hardness:
But in these, there is greater plenty of Earth, and less of Salt; wherefore
they are less brittle, and not transparent. Concerning these we say, that by
the fire mediating, and as it were handying the smallest, broken, and divided
Particles of Salt, are married to every Particle of the Earthy matter, and with
them grow hard, into as it were a stony substance, and that not easily to be
resolved. Also in these kind of matters, prepared by human Industry, we imitate
indeed, with an excellent Artifice, the Concretions of Bones and Stones, made
by Nature in diverse Families of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals.

As to what respects Congelation; Salts of a diverse kind, do often meet
together, and grow stiff, into as it were a new substance: But this happens
many ways. Of these, some Salts being mixed together, presently grow together
into Crystals: for the Acid Spirits of Minerals being added to the Salts of
Tartar, or those made of the incineration of Vegetables turn into a white
Coagulum like Snow, and with a spumeous or frothy Heat: The reason of which is,
that the Particles of the Salt, having gotten a Flux, take hold of other Salts
in the Spirit, Alcalisate by melting; but by reason of the first Particles of
either, being made unlike, there arises a strife; then from the same
consociated in one, that white settlement is made.

Not unlike the same manner, these Acetous Spirits, to wit, of Vitriol, Nitre,
Salt, and others being mixed with Metals, while they corrode them, are
Crystallised together with their Saline Particles: so the Spirits of Vitriol,
Nitre, also Stygian waters, (which are only Salts having gotten a Flux) are
formed into most elegant Crystals, in the dissolving of Silver, Iron, Copper,
and other things. For Salts, even as Sulphur, being loosned from the mixture,
dissolve other mixtures, and greedily desire to be united with the Homogeneous
Particles of the same Subject.

There is another manner of Congelation, when Salts being mixed with some other
matter, are elevated by Sublimation out of their Subjects, and then congeal the
Particles of that new matter, which they carry away with them, and grow
together with them (like a Meteor) on high: after this manner the Salts of
Vitriol, Nitre and Sea Salt, being sublimated with Mercury, are congealed as it
were into a snowy substance: The same being sublimed with Antimony, go into a
matter like Ice. After this manner the Natural Congelations, by which some
Minerals, and chiefly Vitriols and Sulphurs, are begot in the Bowels of the
Earth, may be imitated. For of Iron and Copper are prepared factitious
Vitriols, which are very like the Natural: Of Antimony Sulphur is made, which
answers to an hair our common Sulphur in taking fire, color and smell: for
example pour Oil of Vitriol, to the height of a fingers breadth, upon
pulverised Antimony; and let it be distilled in a Retort in a Sand Furnace, a
yellow Sulphur will be sublimed in the Neck of the Retort, that cannot be
discerned from the common Sulphur: which is a sign that the Concretion of
Sulphur is made in the Earth, when some Sulphurous Mineral is corroded by the
Salt of Vitriol, whose Sulphurous parts are congealed by the same Salt. This
also is an Argument, that Oil of Sulphur, which is separated, by inkindling
under a Bell from the Sulphurous matter, is nothing else but Vitriolic Salt,
nor does any thing differ from Oil of Vitriol.

Artificial Congelation concludes instances and examples of Congelations: to
wit, whereby common water, or any Liquors being put over the fire, or in an Hot
House, are suddenly congealed into Ice: it is a common way, and vulgarly known,
Salt being mixed with Snow and Ice, and agitated or shaken in a Vessel put into
water, suddenly the water about the sides of the Vessel will be frozen. This
will be done if you make trial of it, either with common Salt, or Sea Salt,
Nitre, or also with Vitriol, Alum, Sal Ammoniac, or Mercury Sublimate: For Salt
of every kind, being put to Snow or Ice, loosens their mixtures, and sends away
the Nitrous and Congelative Particles from the Subjects; which presently being
immersed in the neighboring water, Congeal it, as if they were freshly blown
from the North.

What is more admirable; let a dish with Snow be placed over hot Coals, and in
the middle of the Snow put a Glass full of water: as the Snow is melted by
degrees by the fire, the water shall be frozen: for the Nitrous Particles,
being driven away by the heat, by their departure, they are dashed against the
neighboring water and congeal it.

And thus much for FERMENTATION in general, and briefly of its various parts;
it had been almost an infinite Labor, and from our purpose, to heap up
instances in so diffuse a thing. Those hitherto brought, however chosen out of
Natural Philosophy, were fit to wait upon the following Medical dissertation,
that we may more happily know the Original, Progress, and State, as also the
Remedies and Cure of Motions, and Mutations, in Causes, which variously happen
to all kind of Bodies, and somewhat respecting the Tumults, which from thence
are begot in the human Body, from the blood being irritated, and the rest of
the humors; to which exercise, God willing, we will now proceed.

FINIS.
THE PREFACE.
To the Friendly Reader,
TO Institute in this Age a new Doctrine of Fevers, may perhaps seem the same
thing, as if any one should go about to describe the midst of our Country, for
a Land before unknown. For what respect the Diagnosis of this Disease, seem to
be firmly Established already, by the Precepts and Practice of the Ancients and
Moderns; yea by long Experience, they are so generally in the mouth, and known
of all men, that nothing can be more. However I deserve pardon, if I a little
receed from the Vulgar Opinion concerning Fevers, as a way mightily worn out;
and go in a less trodden Path; because I am not the first, or only man that
directs his course against the received Opinion, as against a Stream. For in
truth, in the Medical Art, (and that deservedly) those things have not pleased
the men of our Age, which did those of the former: because the Ancients relying
on a false Position concerning the motion of the Blood, proceeding as it were
through slippery and moist places, often fell foully and dangerously: wherefore
it is no wonder, if those who come after should take care for the thorough
instauration of Physic, and for the Re-Edifying the Building, (as they say)
even from the ground, the Ancient Props being fallen down, on that which our
most Famous Harvy has laid, the Circulation of the Blood, as a new Foundation
in Medicine. But in this Work, Learned men of other Countries, but chiefly of
our own, have happily labored, not only in removing the Rubbish of the former
Building, but for the supplying this plentifully with Stone, Planks, and other
matter. In times past, among the Ancients, as the distribution and Natural
motion, of the Nutritious humor, of the Blood and Nervous juice; so the
Feverish heats, and preternatural motions of them, were wholly hidden and lay
in the dark: but now new Lights have shined forth, and it is granted us to know
the Causes of things before hidden, it does not become prudent men, and
professing Philosophy, even to shut their Eyes and remain blind in the Light it
self; but especially about a Disease by which the third part of Mortals have
still fallen to this day, to be rather willing to Err with the Ancients, than
to understand the Truth with the Moderns, or to believe what is more likely,
argues a mind guilty of notable stubbornness. When therefore the Puretology or
Fever Tracts of former Medicine, had no firm and stable Basis, and that it is
easy to show that it was built upon very many, and plainly false Errors, what
should hinder, but that we having gotten more certain Principles, should
endeavor to erect a better Science concerning Fevers? Truly I think it would
hardly be, although the pleas of the Ancients, should be yet openly maintained in
the Schools, but that many Physicians, who have a mind to look within the Bark,
would frame new Hypotheses to themselves from their own Ratiocination, by which
they might more exactly quadrate the Phenomenon of Fevers, than by that of the
Ancients. But it may be objected, that Fevers have been happily cured by the
same Remedies, and the like method of Curing, from the times of Hippocrates and
Galen, even to our days; and therefore it may seem a rash Work and little safe,
that we should endeavor new things, after having had the Experience of so many
Ages, especially since it is about the human Body. To this it will be easy to
answer, that Medicine was at first Empirical, and Remedies were not invented by
general Precepts, or by Rule, but by the frequent trial of several things: And
if led by the Example of Hippocrates, his Followers had only polished his
Observations and Experiments, without doubt the Medicinal Art had grown up
better, more handsomely, and with greater benefit to the Sick. But that the
Light, clearly inkindled by the Ancients, did so suddenly shut up, and darkened
the Eyes of Posterity, it was, the preposterous study of those, who too bastily
framed, almost out of their own Brain, Physic into a general Method, after the
manner of some Speculative Science: for by this means, before they had laid a
firm Foundation, a sufficiently specious, and deceitful Pile of unstable
Doctrine, was erected. That therefore in the Cure of Fevers, some Indications
being more anciently received, remain yet confirmed, and are to be perpetually
observed, is to be ascribed wholly to Experience, the first Mistress of this
Art, and not to the Precepts of Scholars. And from hence, I hope for my self,
to have gotten a defense sufficient enough; for if the Opinions wholly
erroneous of the Ancients, had not hindered, but that the practice of Medicine,
at first instituted by a certain induction of observations; had proceeded
commodiously enough; the Theory being joined with Truth, would have brought
much less hurt to the Sick; or have less carried away those exercising
Medicine, quite contrary from that Path, which Antiquity had left commended to
us. In the mean time, it is not to be dissembled, that naked Experience, without
the helps of Method and Reason avails little, yea very often does much hurt;
for neither are the same Diseases, every where to be driven away by the same
Remedies. But he seems to have hit the mark, who joins both together, that
Reason may not pervert Experiments, and Nature it self, not that this may
remove Reason from its place. Although that I know well enough, I have not
obtained it, yet I will freely profess, that I have aimed at this Mark; and
perhaps I may have deserved some praise, even in failing in these sort of
Adventures; for after I had not found in Books, what might satisfy a mind
desirous of Truth, I resolved with my self, to search into living and breathing
Examples: and therefore sitting oftentimes by the Sick, I was wont carefully to
search out their Cases, to weigh all the symptoms, and to put them, with exact
Diaries of the Diseases, into writing; then diligently to meditate on these,
and to compare some with others; and then began to adapt general Notions from
particular Events: and when by this means, for a long time, observing the
Accidents and Courses of Fevers, I had busied my self, for the finding out
forms of Reasons for their Cure, at length a new Pathology of this Disease was
conceived in my mind; which afterward, by the frequent increasing Concourse of
Observations, as it were the Juice and Blood, was formed by degrees into a
Child, such as it now appears. But the Infant, which I had ordered to be kept
closely, in our private house, being remarkable for Paradoxes, as it were a
monstrous shape, the importune diligence of Friends has taken care to bring
abroad being gotten forth of my hands, and to be publicly beheld. What
therefore is there said concerning Fevers, besides the common manner, I would
not have any one esteem it brought forth by me, as from a Doctor in the Chair:
doubting, I bring these thoughts into Public, and submit them to the
Examination and Emendation of the more Learned. That others before me have not
spoken all things truly concerning this thing, shall be an Argument that I may
Err, yea (if you please) that I have Erred: however, if I should have rightly
traced forth any marks, in this, at least new search of Truth; and shall have
incited others (who are far better able) by this occasion, to the full
finishing of it; it will not repent me altogether of this, tho rash beginning.

OF FEVERS.
CHAP. I. The Anatomy of the Blood; and its Resolution into five Principles: A
comparing it with Wine and Milk.
THE Doctrine of Fermentation being explicated, it remains that we handle the
chief Instance or Example of it, to wit Fevers. For it seems that a Fever is
only a Fermentation, or immoderate Heat, brought into the blood and humors. Its
name is derived from Februo (or Purgament, which also is derived from Ferveo to
be Hot) which word indeed is commodiously put to every Fever, for that the
blood in this Disease grows hot, and besides, by its fervor, as working must,
it is Purged from its filthinesses. But that this Fermentation or Feverish
effervescency, may be rightly explicated, these three things are to be
considered. First, What the Fermenting Liquor is; whether only blood, or any
humors besides. Secondly, In what Principles in the mixture, and in what
proportion of them, this Liquor consists. Thirdly and lastly, By what motion
and turgescency of those parts, or Particles, of which the blood is made, the
Feverish effervescency is stirred up. These being thus premised, the Doctrine
of Fevers shall be delivered, not from the Opinions of others, but acccording
to the comparisons of Reasons, picked (tho from ours, yet) from diligent and
frequent observation, and confirmed by certain Experiments; all which however,
I willingly submit to the judgment of the more skilful.

It plainly appears, even to the sense, that the Blood does hugely boil up and
rage in a Fever, for every one (tho rude and unskilful) being in a Fever,
complains of the blood being distempered, and of the same growing hot in the
Vessels, and as it were put into a fury. Also, besides the blood raging in the
Veins and Arteries, it may be lawfully suspected, that that juice with which
the Brain and Nervous parts are watered, is wont oftentimes to be in fault; for
when this Liquor is seen to be carried back from the blood, into the Nervous
stock by a constant motion, and certain Circulation, and from thence through
the Lymphatick Vessels, into the Bosom of the blood, it is probable, if by
reason of a taint contracted from the blood, that humor be depraved in its
disposition, or is perverted from its equal motion, that from thence, the
Rigor, and Pain, Convulsion, Delirium, Frenzy, and many more symptoms of the
Nervous kind, usual in Fevers, do arise.

After the Blood and Nervous Liquor, two other humors, for that being apt to
grow hot, fall into our consideration, viz. The Chyme or nourishing Juice,
continually coming to the Mass of Blood, and the serous Latex, perpetually
departing from the same, which tho they be the first and last Liquors separated
from the Blood, and distinct from it, yet being confused with it, they ought to
be esteemed as its associate parts, or complements: For the nourishable Juice
being fresh brought, is accounted the crude part of the blood, and to be
assimilated; and the Serum, its stale part, and to be carried away. And after
this manner, so long as either are Circulated with the blood it self, in the
Vessels they participate of the heats of the first begotten blood, and
oftentimes occasionally begin them, or increase them being begun: but by what
means these things come to be done, is declared hereafter in their proper
places. As to the rest of humors, which are only the recrements of the
Nutritious juice, or the blood, when they are included, either in their proper
Receptacles, or constrained in the narrow spaces, in the Viscera, neither wash
the several parts of the Body with a continual lustration, as the blood or
Nervous Liquor, or the other humors but now recited, are to be exempted from
this rank; sometimes perhaps they may be the occasional cause that the blood
does conceive an undue Effervescency, or that it persists in it longer; but it
is only the blood, (with the Nervous Liquor, the alible juice, and Serum
associates) which boiling up above measure, with its heat, and stirred up with
a rage through the Vessels, diffuses the preternatural heat, and induces the
formal reason of the Fever: but how this comes to be done, is not to be known
plainly, but by a more near beholding the Nature of Blood, and as it were an
Anatomy made of its Liquor.

There are in the Blood (as in all Fermentative Liquors) Heterogeneous
Particles which as they are of a diverse Figure and Energy, remain a long while
in the mixture, by their mutual opposing one another and subaction, the motion
of Fermentation is continually conserved; as is perceived in Wine, Beer, and
other Liquors: then, if the mixtion of the Liquor be somewhat unlocked by the
adding of Ferments, the Native Particles being freed from their bonds, do yet
more swell up and induce Fermentation, with a more rapid motion and heat: which
is seen in a familiar Experiment of the Chemists, viz. when fluid Salts are
mixed with Saline Liquors of another kind; from thence a great heat and
ebullition are stirred up. Wherefore we ought to inquire concerning the Blood,
of what Particles it consists, that it should be fit to Ferment, (as Wine,
Beer, and other Liquors) of its own Nature: then by the help of what kind of
Ferments, both its Natural and Feverish heats are performed, with warmth, and
a more quick motion.

The Mass of the Blood by the opinion of the Ancients, was thought to consist
of four humors, to wit, Blood, Phlegm, Choler and Melancholy: and it was
affirmed, that according to the eminency of this, or that humor, diverse
temperaments are formed; and that by reason of their fervors or exorbitances,
almost all Diseases do arise. This Opinion, tho it flourished from the time of
Galen, in the Schools of Physicians, yet in our Age, in which the Circular
motion of the Blood, and other affections of it were made known, before not
understood, it began to be a little suspected; nor to be so generally made use
of, for the solving the Phaenomenas of Diseases: because these sort of humors
do not constitute the blood, but what are so called (except the Blood) are only
the recrements of the blood, which ought continually to be separated from it:
For in truth the Blood is an only humor; not one thing about the Viscera, and
another in the habit of the Body; nor is it moved at one time by Phlegm, and
another time with Choler, or Melancholy, (as is commonly asserted) but the
Liquor growing hot in the Vessels, is only Blood, and wheresoever it is carried
through all the parts of the Body, it is still the same, and like it self. But
because by reason of the abundance of the implanted heat in some, and because
of the smalness of it in others, the Coction of the Aliment is now quicker, now
slower performed in the Bowels, and in the Vessels; therefore the temper of the
Blood (tho but one, and always the same Liquor) becomes diverse: and according
to the various disposition of this, it may be said that men are Choleric,
Melancholic, or of another temperament. Besides, because whilst the Blood is
made in its Circulation in the Vessels, some parts continually grow Old, and
others are supplied anew, hence from Crudity, or too much Coction, there is a
necessity that what is excrementitious should be heaped together: which
notwithstanding by its effervescency, (as by the working or depuration of Wines
it comes to pass) it is separated from its Mass, viz. the watery humor, fixed in
the Bowels, or solid parts, is it which is called Phlegm: some Relics of
adust Salt and Sulphur, being separated in the Liver, and received by the
Choleduct Vessels are called Choler; the Earthy feculences being laid up in the
Spleen, are termed Melancholy. In the mean time, the Blood if rightly purified
ought to want Choler, Phlegm and Melancholy: even as when some Wines, or Beer
are purified, the more light Particles are carried upwards, which constitute
its Flowers or Head; and the dregs are pressed down to the bottom, which grow
together into Feces or Tartar: yet none can truly say it, Wine or Beer is
composed of Froth, Tartar, and a Vinous Liquor. But as these humors, commonly
so called, are made out of the other Principles, viz. Choler out of Salt and
Sulphur, with an admixtion of Spirit and Water; and Melancholy, out of the
same, with an addition of Earth; and as the blood is immediately forged out of
these kind of Principles, and is wont to be resolved sensibly into the same, I
thought best, the common acception of humors being laid aside, to bring into
use these celebrated Principles of the Chemists, for the unfolding the Nature
of the Blood and its affections. There are therefore in the blood as in all
Liquors, apt to be Fermented, very much of Water and Spirit, a mean of Salt and
Sulphur, and a little of Earth. The blood being loosned by putrefaction,
exhibits the same separated and distinct. Also in the blood contained in the
Vessels, or being fresh let out from them, we may discover their energies and
effects: besides when in the Food, whereby we are fed, by the juice of which
the Liquor of the blood is made, these same are implanted, no man will go about
to deny that the blood also is made from them: wherefore I will briefly run
through these, and endeavor to show by what means the Consistency, the
Properties, and the Affections of the Blood are made by them.

1. Spirits (which readily obtain the chief place) are a subtle, and greatly
volatile portion of the blood. Their Particles, always expansed, and
endeavoring to fly away do move about the more thick little Bodies of the
rest, wherewith they are involved, and continually detein them in the motion of
Fermentation. The Liquor of the blood, continually boils up with their
effervescency or growing hot and equal expansion in the Vessels, and the rest
of the Principles are contained in an orderly motion, and within the bond of
the exact mixture; if any Heterogeneous thing, or unagreable to the mixture, be
poured into the bloody Mass, presently the Spirits being disturbed in their
motion rage, shake the blood, and force it to grow hugely hot, until what is
extraneous, and not missible, is either subdued, and reduced, or cast out of
doors. By the irradiation, or rather the irrigation or watering of these, the
Bodies of the Nerves are inflated, the Functions of the Viscera, and also the
Offices of motion, and sensation are performed: from the want of Spirits also
from their motion being depraved or hindered, arise great vices of the Natural
economy or Government. The more quick motion and effervescency of these in the
blood, (above what is in Wine) chiefly depends upon the Ferment of the Heart;
because, whilst the blood passes through the Bosom of the Heart, its mixture is
very much loosned, so that the Spirits, together with the Sulphurous
Particles, being somewhat loosned, and as it were inkindled into a flame, leap
forth, and are much expanded, and from thence they impart by their
deflagration, a heat to the whole. By reason of this kind of expansion and
suffusion of heat, there is made a continual expense of Spirits, which being
rarefied, as it were inkindled, continually fly away, and are evaporated forth
a doors: and as long as we live there is made a continual reparation of these
by aliments, chiefly the most delicate; which contain in themselves very much
of Spirit and swelling matter: from which juice being drawn by digestion, and
collated to the blood, is assimilated to it and fills up its defects. When the
Blood of Animals is distilled, the Spirits (like Aqua Vitae) ascend of a limpid
color, they are made very sharp and pricking by the adhesion of the Salt; yet
they are not so easily drawn off as the Spirits of Wine, but that there is need
of a more intense fire to force them, because they are hardly driven from the
fellowship of the thicker parts, with which they are involved.

2. That there is plenty of Sulphur in the blood, it is plainly seen, because
we are chiefly fed with Fat and Sulphurous Aliments, also the Nutriment from
the blood, carried to the solid parts, goes into Sulphur and Fatness. It is
most likely, from the dissolution of this, that the red Tincture of the Blood
does arise: for Sulphurous Bodies; before any others, impart to the solvent
Menstruum, a color highly full of redness; and when by reason of too great
Crudity, the Sulphur is less dissolved, the blood becomes watery and pale, that
it will scarce dye a Linen ragg red. The Mass of blood being impregnated with
Sulphur, and together with Spirits, it becomes very Fermentable: which however,
whilst it enters the Ventricles of the Heart, there suffers a greater
effervescency, or rather accension; and on the Particles chiefly Sulphurous,
being inflamed; and thence diffused through the whole, the lively and vital
heat in us depends. When the Sulphurous part is carried forth, and does too
much luxuriate in the blood, it perverts its disposition from its due state,
that therefore the blood being either depraved, or made more bilous or
Choleric, does not rightly Cook the nourishing juice; or being inkindled
throughout, it conceives heats and ardours such as arise in a continual Fever.
For the Sulphur being too much exalted; and swelling more than it ought, stirs
up great heats in the blood: and they whose blood is more plentifully
impregnated with Sulphur, are most obnoxious to Fevers. By reason of the
Particles of this being incocted with the Nutritious juice, and from thence
carried to the solid parts, fatness, softness and tenderness, come to our Body.
From the Flesh or Blood putrefying, by reason of the abundance of evaporated
Sulphur, a most evil stink breaths forth: In the distillation of Blood, Sulphur
ascends under the form of a blackish Oil, which also by reason of the
Empyreuma, stinks most wickedly.

3. That Salt is in the blood, is evinced by the Salt; which, tho fixed, is
drawn forth, by being eaten, from Vegetables, and from other eatable things, at
first less volatile, afterward by the most excellent digestion of Nature, and
Circulation, is highly volatilised; that it passes through, not only without a
remaining Caput Mortuum, all the members and parts of our Body, but also the
blood being exposed to distillation, ascends the Alembic, and leaves the dead
Head as insipid earth: If at any time the Saline Particles are not rightly
exalted in the Blood, by reason of ill digestion, but remain crude, and for the
most part fixed, from thence the blood becomes thick and unfit for Circulation,
so that obstructions are begot in the bowels and solid parts, and serous
Crudities are every where heaped together: But if the Salt be too much carried
forth, and suffers a Flux, the Spirit being depressed, or deficient, a sour and
bitter disposition is given to the blood, such as is observed in Scorbutical
people, and those sick of a Quartan Fever. Also from the Salt, for this reason
being variously coagulated, the Stone, King's Evil, Gout, Leprosy, and very
many other Chronical Diseases arise. But when Coction being rightly performed
in the bowels and Vessels, the Salt is duly exalted, and being associated with
the Spirit, is volatilised, then by reason of its mixture, the Liquor of the
blood more equally ferments; also is defended from Putrefaction, Stagnation and
Coagulation: Also the Saline Particles, bridle the fiercenesses of the Spirits,
and especially of Sulphur; wherefore, those who have their blood well filled
with a Volatile Salt, are less obnoxious to Fevers: also hence those who often
are let blood, are more apt to Fevers.

4. Besides, There are in the blood (as it is a thick humor, and has a gross
consistence) many Earthy Particles: from hence also, its too great
Volatilisation is as it were supported, and its too hasty accension hindered:
even as Charcoal-dust, is added oftentimes to Gunpowder in a greater
proportion, that all its parts may not take fire at once, and too soon.
Further, from the Terrestrial Particles of the blood, and Nutritious Juice, the
bulk and increase of the Body proceeds. Lastly from the distillation of the
Blood, a light and friable Caput Mortuum, is left in great plenty.

5. Upon the watery part of the blood depends its fluidness; for from hence its
stagnation is hindered, and the blood is circulated in the Vessels, without
growing thick or stiff: also its too great conflagration, and adustion is
restrained, and its heat attempered. When blood is distilled a clear and
insipid water is drawn off, at least in a double proportion to the rest; for
from hence the matter of Urine, Sweat, and every humid Excrement, for the most
part proceeds.

What things were but now asserted, concerning the Principles of the blood, and
the affections to be deduced thence, will better appear, if we consider
consider a little the blood according to its sensible parts, and shall compare
it with other Liquors which are in daily use among us. Those sort of Liquors,
which have a very great Analogy with the blood, are v^z. Rich Wine and Milk. As
to the reasons of Fermentation and growing Hot, it is most fitly compared to
Wine; as to its consistency, coagulation, and departure of the parts one from
another, it is likened to Milk.

In the first place therefore, it is observed of Wine, that so long as it is
shut up in the Vessel or Pipe, its subtle and spirituous Particles, do
perpetually agitate, or very much shake others more thick, break them, and
render them fit for an exact mixtion; what is heterogeneous, and unfit for
subaction or mingling, is separated by its growing hot: In the mean time the
purified Liquor greatly fermenting is in perpetual motion, whereby all the
parts (as Atoms variously moved up and down, in a beam or streak of light) do
stretch themselves forth on every side, and contend with a constant rolling
about, from top to bottom, and from thence to the top again. By the attrition
and refraction of the Particles very many Effluvia of Atoms, go away from the
Liquor, which if the Vessel being closely shut, they are kept within; the
Liquor grows too excessively hot, and oftentimes causes the containing Vessel
to burst in pieces. Blood, much after the same manner being shut up within the
Veins and the Arteries, is urged with a constant Circulation: The Vital Spirit
makes subtle, breaks, and exactly molds the more thick Particles; what is
heterogeneous, and not mixable, it expels forth of doors; in the mean time by
the refraction and kneading of the parts, Effluvia of heat do constantly stream
forth, and evaporate through the pores; which being shut in, if transpiration
be hindered, presently by reason of the too great boiling of the blood a Fever
is inkindled.

Secondly, we will observe concerning Wines, that they grow turgid, or swell
up, if any extraneous thing, and of a Fermentative Nature, be poured to them;
yea sometimes, that they are moved more than ordinary of their own accord. For,
when by a long digestion, the Sulphurous part of the Wine is too much exalted,
it conceives a greater heat than it ought, and (unless presently appeased)
perverts the disposition of the whole Liquor, with its swelling up. It seems to
be for the very like reason, that the Feverish heat which is wont to be
introduced by reason of the same Causes, is stirred up in the blood, as shall
be shown in the next Chapter, where we treat of the Motion and Heat of the
blood.

The third Observation, or comparing of the Blood with Wine, shall be of this
sort: Wines (as also many other Liquors, as for example, Beer, or Sider) have
their times of crudity, maturation, and defection. For when they are first
made, the Spirituous parts are so obvolved by the others more thick, that they
show themselves but little, and put forth almost nothing of strength or virtue:
and as the other Particles, are not yet subtilised, nor truly concocted, the
whole Liquor remains crude, and of an ungrateful taste; and if put to
distillation, not any Spirit ascends. From this state it comes by degrees to
perfection, and when the Spirits being extricated from their intanglements,
obtain their own right, and have subtilized and exalted the more thick
Particles of the rest, the whole mass of the Liquor becomes Clear, Spirituous,
Sweet and Balsamic. Lastly, when by a long Fermentation, the Spirits are
consumed, and begin at length to fail, the state of defection is induced,
whereby Wines, and other Liquors, either pass into a tastlesness, or at last
the Salt and the Sulphur being too much exalted, are made sour or unsavory. In
like manner the blood also, while it is Circulated in the Vessels, may be
considered according to this kind of threefold disposition: First, in the
making or crudity, which has relation to the Chyme new made in the Viscera, and
freshly poured to the blood; the Particles of which, like to unripe Fruit, are
crude and undigested. Secondly, In the perfect state or maturation, which
belongs to the blood being sufficiently wrought, and made Volatile, according
to all its Particles after it is inspired by Ferments, and its inkindling in
the heart exalted. Thirdly, in its defection, which respects the blood; after
it has burned forth, and its Spirituous parts are very much flown away, and
the rest growing old and poor, have need to be removed; and so they are either
the Relics of Salt, which are with the Serum strained forth continually by
the Urine; or they are Particles of Salt and Sulphur, boiled and baked
together, which are strained forth by the virtue of the Liver into the
choleduct Vessels: or lastly, they are dregs and earthy recrements of the blood
it self, which are carried into the Spleen, and there (as it were a Caput
Mortuum, exalted by a new digestion) go into a Ferment, at length to be
transmitted to the blood. Whilst after this manner, the generation of the
blood, and its due maturation are truly dispatched, it is pleasingly circulated
within the Vessels, neither wanting in motion or heat, nor inordinately
troubled with them. But if either the supplement of the nourishing Juice, be
not made agreeable with the rest of the blood, nor assimilated with it, but
that either by reason of the defect of Concoction, it is washed into a very
crude humor, or because of its excess, it is roasted into a burnt matter; or if
the blood growing old, does not lay aside what it casts off, and give way to a
new Nutritious humor; I say, by reason of these kind of Vices, concerning
Sanguification, or the making of blood, the blood is variously perverted from
its due temper and equal motion, and now becomes Watery and Cold; now Sharp or
Salt; now Acid, Austere, or by some other way degenerate, and sometimes
obnoxious to stagnations, and somimes also to immoderate heats.

We may observe these kind of degrees of crudity, coction, and defection, in
the blood, both of the sound and of the sick: in healthful persons after a more
plentiful repast, Surfeit, or hard drinking, when too much of Serum or of
Juice, is poured to the blood, its whole mass being too much diluted with a
crude humor, becomes more watery and less spirituous; wherefore men are
rendered sluggish, and unfit for motion or exercise. In sick persons the
Phlegmatic Constitution of the Body, induces such a crudity of the bloody mass,
as is discerned in the White Dropsy, the Dropsy, Pica or longing Disease, and
the Chlorosis or Green Sickness. Also the state of this kind of crudity, comes
in an intermitting Fever, and in truth is the cause of the Feverish
accession, viz. by reason of the dyscrasie of the blood; the nourishing Juice
being heaped up, is not assimilated to it, but for the most part goes into a
crude, or otherwise degenerate matter; with which, when the mass of the blood
is filled to a plenitude, swelling up it brings on the fit.

The state of Maturation, Concoction being finished, happens in healthful
persons, some hours after Eating, especially in the morning, to wit, when the
supplement of the Chyme, is spiritualised, and as it were enkindled in the
whole, by reiterated Circulations: for then men are made more nimble and
lively, and more ready for studies, or any business.

The state of Defection, is in the blood of sound men after fasting long, hard
labor, and want of Food, for then the Vital Spirit being very much evaporated,
the mass of the blood begins to become as it were lifeless, wherefore they
presently languish, and are made weak. Moreover, the blood by a too long
Coction is burned, and grows bilous, from whence those accustomed to want Food,
or fasting, for the most part become sad and melancholic. Some Diseases
habitually induce such a disposition of the blood; such are the Scurvy, the
Yellow Jaundies, the Cachexia (or evil state of the Body when the nourishing
Juice turns to ill humors) long Fevers, and most Chronical Diseases, in
which, the whole mass of blood, passes from from a Spirituous, into either a
sour, sharp, or austere Nature.

So much for the comparing of Blood with rich Wine; what follows, being a
similitude of it with Milk, consists in the diversity of the parts, and their
settling apart, which is chiefly seen in its being let forth from the Veins, and
grown cold in the dish. For when the heat and vital Spirit, which conserve all
things in the mixture, are flown away, the remaining parts, depart from one
another of themselves, and a separation of the thin from the thick, and of the
Serum from the Fibrous blood is made. This sort of separation of the parts,
succeeds almost after the same manner, as in the coagulation of Milk. There are
in Milk, Buttery, Cheesie parts, and Whey. The like is in Blood, so long as it
does not much recede from its Natural temper: for it is good, when, being let
forth of the Veins, it grows cold in the Porringer, its parts do settle after
the same manner; to wit, the more pure portion, and Sulphurous (like Cream)
comes together on the Superficies, which in healthful people, looks brightly
red, and this answers to the flowring, or head of the Milk: under this lies a
Purple thick substance, which cosists of little Thrids and Fibers joined
together, and as it were concreted into a clotty substance or parenchyma, such
as the Liver: For the heat being consumed, and the bond of the mixture losened,
the Fibrous parts lay hold on one another, and by their weight, settle into a
more thick Coagulum, which answers to the Cheesie part of the Milk: In the mean
time, the Serous or Wheyey parts, being thrust forth from the rest, get their
own Nature, and constitute a clear Liquor, like water; which as it is thinner,
ascends to the top, and swims upon the rest. Further, as the Whey of Milk is
wont to be further coagulated, and does yet contain in it self some parts both
Buttery and Cheesie, so this Liquor swiming on the blood, if it be exposed
either to the fire, grows thick, like the White of an Egg a little roasted, or
if an Acid Liquor be poured to it, will be precipitated into a white Coagulum.
This being seen, some have thought this watery Latex, to be the nourishing
juice, which imparts nourishment to the whole Body, from the mass of the blood,
in the time of its Circulation, and that the rest of the blood, is only the
Vehicle of Heat and Spirits, and serves for no other use. But to me it seems
more likely, that in this watery Liquor is contained the nourishing juice,
which is employed on the Nerves, and the commonly termed Spermatic parts, for
nourishment is supplied to the Musculous stock, from the Fibrous blood of the
Parenchyma, or the Liver, Lights, and Milt. After this manner, blood being not
much vitiated, goes into parts like Milk; but if it be exceedingly depraved,
when it settles, it shows a far different disposition, and as to its single
Contents, is allotted into various appearances; for the Cream growing together
on the top, is seen to be sometimes white, sometimes green, now yellow, or of
livid or lead color: also it becomes not tender, but very viscous or clammy,
that like a Membrane, it can scarce be pulled in pieces. When the blood long
growing hot with a Feverish distemper, is let forth from the cut Vein, in its
Superficies, instead of a Scarlet Cream, there grows together often a white
skin, or of some other color: the reason of which is, because the blood is
thoroughly roasted, by too great Ebullition, and its more pure portion, as it
were by a certain elixation, is boiled forth from a red and tender substance,
to a white and tough; but if in the mean time the bloody mass be not
sufficiently purged from the adust recrements of Salt and Sulphur, the color
of this little skin becomes yellow or livid, and therefore the water swimming
over it, is often tinged by the same means. Further, the Purple Crassament or
thick substance, is also various: viz. sometimes it is of a blackish color,
when the blood is scorched too much, by a long effervesency. When the Fibers
are vitiated, as in the Liver, they grow not together, but the Liquor like
Beasting Milk, remains somewhat thick, and yet fluid; which indeed argues a
great corruption of the blood; as uses to happen, in a putrid Fever, a very
great Cachexy, sometimes the watery Latex is wanting, as in Hectical people, and
in too great a Diaphoresis. Sometimes it superabounds, as in Dropical people,
neither will the whole go into a white Coagulum, by heat: In some Cachectical
people, the blood being made more watery, appears like watered flesh. I knew
one, endued with a vicious habit of body, that was wont to have blood of a
whitish color, and like to Milk when it was let forth, and afterward, when he
grew better by Chalybiat Medicines, his blood was moderately red: but
concerning the settling of the blood and its appearances, there is enough. But
as blood being emitted from the Vessels by its coagulation and departure of the
parts one from another, imitates the various substances of congealed Milk, so
sometimes being shut within the Veins and Arteries, like same fused by a
Coagulum, enters altogether into the like mutation from Morbific causes; by
reason of which change, being hindered in its Circulation, or somwhere congealed
and fixed according to its portions, it produces many distempers: for it seems,
that from hence the Pleurisy, the Squinancy, the Inflammation of the Lungs,
the Dysentery, take their Original, and to this Cause the Pestilent diseases,
ow chiefly their deadliness, as shall be said hereafter in its place.

It is sufficient that we have hitherto drawn a parallel of the blood, from
which comparison with Wine and Milk, may be gathered what sort of Particles and
Substances, it comprehends in it self, viz. Spirituous, and very agil or
nimble, (such as generous or rich Wine has) for the heat and motion; and
besides soft and tender (such as are in Milk) for the nourishment of the Body.
Yea also, this Analogy of it with Wine and Milk, is yet further confirmed by
the use of them in our diet, out of which the blood is generated; forasmuch as
Milk is the best and most simple Aliment, and with it Infants, and Children,
who have need of a plentiful provision of blood are nourished chiefly: But Wine
copiously begets vital Spirits before all other things, and being weak and
fallen, excellently restores them, wherefore it is wont to be esteemed instead
of Nectar for old men, or those of ripe years.

The Nature and Analysis of the blood flowing within the Vessels, being opened
after this manner, the Nutritious Juice deserves yet our consideration, being
supplied from the blood, and separated out of the mass of blood, for the
nourishment of the solid parts, and cleaving to them (whereby it may be the
better assimilated) like Dew. For the Nerves, Tendons, and the rest of the
solid parts of the whole Body, are washed with a certain alible juice. The
Vital Spirits, having obtained the Nervous Bodies for a Vehicle of this, blow
them forth at length, and expeditiously execute the actions of Sense: also that
humor coming upon the solid parts, and assimulated with them, inlarges their
bulk and growth. This is not a place to inquire after the Origin, Birth, and
manner of the dispensation of this: It shall suffice only, that we have noted,
that it is supplied from the mass of blood, and (as it is rendered highly
probable by the most Learned Doctor Glisson, and Doctor Wharton) after it has
past through the Nervous part by a certain Circulation, what remains, being now
made as it were poor, and lifeless, is sent back by the Lymphatic Vessels, to
the blood. Whilst this Juice, being little cocted, or purged from dregs, is
sent from the depraved blood, to the Nervous parts, it is wont variously to
irritate them into Cramps and Convulsive Motions; also, no few Symptoms in
Fevers, arise by reason of the depravation, and irregular Motion of this
Juice, as shall be more largely laid open in another place.

CHAP. II. Of the Motion and Heats of the Blood.
SO much for the Anatomy of the Blood, as to its primary Elements and
Constitutive parts, into which it is sensibly wont to be resolved; also as to
its Affections, which appear clearly, by the comparing it with Wine and Milk:
it remains for us next to enquire concerning the motion of the Blood, both
Natural, ( viz. by the help of what Ferment, and by what swelling up of parts,
it is Circulated in a perpetual motion through the Vessels) and preternatural,
viz. for what Causes, and what fury of parts, when it boils up above measure in
the Vessels, and conceives Feverish Effervescences. These being rightly
unfolded and premised, we will enter upon the Doctrine of Fevers.

Concerning the Natural Motion of the Blood, we shall not here enquire of its
Circulation, viz, by what Structure of the Heart and Vessels, it is wheeled
about after a constant manner, as it were in a water Engine; but of its
Fermentation, viz. by what mixtion of parts, and mutual action of them together
among themselves (like Wine fermenting in the Ton) it continually boils up. And
this kind of motion, (as it were truly an intestine war of the blood) depends
both on the Heterogeneity of the parts of the blood it self, and on the various
Ferments, which are breathed into the mass of the blood from the Bowels.

As to the first: those things which have altogether like Particles do not
ferment, wherefore, neither distilled waters, Chemical Oils, Spirits of Wine,
or other simple Liquors are moved, as has been already observed: but I have
said, that Blood, according to the Nature things quickly irritable, does
consist of a proportionate mixture of the Elements; in which Spirits, for that
they are very nimble, continually strive to expand themselves and to fly away:
but being entangled by the more thick Particles of the rest, they are detained
in their flight. And being detained after this manner, they toss about, break
to pieces, and very much subtilise the more thick little Bodies, by which they
are hindered; they volatilise the Salt, otherwise fixed; by a most minute
kneading, and by the adhesion of it, they perfectly dissolve the Sulphur,
compacted in it self, and not miscible with the rest, and boil it in the Serum.
They break the Earth, even to its smallest parts, and mingle it with the rest.
But in the mean time, by the striking and molding the Salt and the Sulphur,
Effluvia's of heat plentifully proceed, which being mixed with the rest, and on
every side diffused, increase the motion of the Fermentation. And after this
manner all being most minutely broken and diluted with watery Particles, they
constitute the Liquor of the Blood: which, whilst in the Vessels, as Wine shut
up in a Pipe, continually ferments, and, according to all its Particles is in
perpetual motion.

But the Fermentation of Wine, and of Blood, differs in this: that in Wine
there is no wasting of the old parts, and a coming again of new; but the Liquor
being shut up in the Vessel, remains still the same: but it is otherwise in
Blood, in which some parts are continually destroyed, and in their place others
are always generated anew. In Wine, the times of crudity, maturation, and
defection, are distinct, and are successively performed in the whole; In Blood,
that threefold state is celebrated at the same time and by parts: Fermentation
being once begun in Wine, is continued even to the end; but in Blood, because
it is washed still with crude Juices, it ought still to be renewed; by which
means, the Nutritious Particles, not of kin, are assimilated to the rest of the
Latex; wherefore, for this work, besides the Fermentation once begun in the
blood, there is need of some Ferments, which may continue the same, otherwise
about to leave off.

That Ferments are required for the making of Blood, this is an Argument; that
when they are wanting by Nature, they are with good success supplied by the
work of Art: for fixed Salts, Alcaly Salt, Extracts, Digestives, Openers, and
especially Chalybeate Remedies, help for this reason, that, as it were by a
certain Ferment, they restore anew, the weak, or almost extinct Ebullition or
Boiling of the Blood.

As to what respects the Natural Ferments, very many may certainly be formed,
and in diverse parts, or hid in the Bowels: for any humor, in which the
Particles of Salt, Sulphur or Spirit, being much exalted, are contained, puts
on the Nature of a Ferment: after this manner, the flowring or dregs of Beer or
new Wine, being kneaded with Meal, and the mass kept to a sowrness, come under
this rank, by which new Beer, and the like Liquors, as also the mass of Bread,
are most excellently Fermented. In like manner in the Ventricle, a sowrish
humor participating of exalted Salt, there helps concoction: and in the
Spleen, the feculencies of the Blood from Salt and Earth being exalted, go into
a Ferment.

How much vigor comes to the Blood from the Womb and Genital parts appears from
hence, because by the privation, or evil disposition of them, follow, in Maids
the Green sickness, in men, barrenness or loss of virility, want of Beard, and
a shrill voice. But the chief Ferment, that serves for sanguification, is
established in the Heart; for this is the chief fireplace, in which the cruder
Particles of the Chyme, are as it were inkindled, and acquire a volatileness:
which thing may be confirmed by many reasons, but especially by its effects,
which we suffer in the precordia, as often as the Blood ferments more or less
than it ought to do: for when it is too much inkindled in the Heart, it is
agitated impetuously, as it were by fires put under it; the signs of whose
immoderate Ebullition are, a deep pulse and vehement, then almost an
intolerable heat in the Precordia, with a vehement thirst; on the other side,
when the Fermentation of the blood is lessened in the Heart, we are affected
with an anhelous, and difficult respiration upon any motion; as may be
perceived in the Dropsy, Cachexia, and Yellow Jaundice: the reason of which
is, not because the Lungs are stuffed, or filled full of a tough or clammy
matter; but because the blood does not rightly ferment, in that Repository of
Fermentation; wherefore, being fallen into its Bosom, it is not presently
Rarefied; nor does it soon leap forth into the Lungs, but being apt to
stagnate, and remain there, causes an oppression of the Heart it self; for the
helping of which, frequent breathing is made, that the blood being let forth
into the Lungs, succor might be brought to it: but if by motion or exercise,
the blood be more provoked into its Ventricle, than can be derived by
respiration, or the pulse, into the Pneumonic Vessels, there is danger of
choking. The like happens in those that are dying: when the pulse is very
small, and the blood being heaped up in the Heart for want of Fermentation,
begins to stagnate and to clodder, we then breath deeply, with a noise and
elevation of the breast; to wit, the blood with the ultimate endeavor of
Nature, and the whole force of the Lungs, as long as it is able to be done, is
emptied forth into the Lungs, lest residing in the Heart, it should wholly
choke it.

Therefore, Motion and Heat, in the Blood, depend chiefly on two things, viz.
partly on its own proper disposition and constitution, by which, it being
forged very greatly with active Principles of Spirits, Salt, and Sulphur, of
its own accord swells up, or grows turgid in the Vessels, even as Wine in the
Ton: and partly on the Ferment implanted in the Heart, which very much rarifies
the Liquor passing through its Bosom, and makes it to leap forth with a frothy
heat: that the blood, which is quietly instilled to the Heart through the
Veins, running gently like a River, from thence leaping forth through the
Arteries, (like a Torrent) with noise and rage, might be carried forward, to
all the parts of the whole Body. By what means this is done, though it is not
easy to explicate Mechanically, yet the manner, and some not improbable
reasons of this thing, are delivered by most Learned men, Ent, Carts, and
others. They suppose indeed, as it were a fire to be set in the Chimny of the
Heart, which presently inkindles the blood infused through the Veins, (even as
a flame put to Wine burns it) which being so inkindled, by its deflagration
(like lightning) passes most swiftly through the Arteries: so that heat, a most
rapid motion, and Effluvia sent by Perspiration, are wont to proceed from the
accension of the blood in the Heart only. Hogelandus affirms, that there is a
Ferment hid in the Bosom of the Heart, that compels the Liquor of the blood to
boil up, and to grow hot, with heat, and a plentiful emission of Soot, just
like Spirit of Nitre, when it is poured on the Butter of Antimony: so that the
blood flowing in gently through the Veins, being forthwith Rarefied into spume
and vapor by the ferment of the Heart, runs very impetuously through the
passages of the Arteries. It Is almost the same thing, whether it be said to be
done, either by this, or by that way: for the alteration which the blood
receives in the Heart, may be equally deduced from a flame, or a Nitrous
Sulphurous ferment, there supposed to be placed. Because, whilst the blood
slides into the Ventricles of the Heart, presently the frame of the Liquor is
loosned, and the active Particles, especially the Spirituous and Sulphurous,
the bond of the mixture being broke, do leap forth from the rest, and strive to
expand themselves on every side; but being kept in by the Vessels, and being
forced together with the remaining Liquor, through the open passages of the
Arteries, they rush with violence, and swelling up by the way they can find,
and by that means, diffuse Effluvia of heat, through the whole body: there is
little difference, whether this expansion of the Particles of the blood, and
exertion into the liberty of motion, be said to be done by Accension, or by
Fermentation, forasmuch as by either way, the frame of the blood may be so
unlocked, that from thence the Particles of Spirit, Salt, and especially of
Sulphur, being incited into motion, (as it were by an inkindled fire) may
impart heat to the whole Body.

But this Rarefaction, or Accension of the blood in the Heart, very much
depends upon the disposition and constitution of the blood it self: for if its
Liquor be rightly cocted, being made volatile, and (like rich Wine) brought to
maturity, it then Ferments there after its due manner, whereby the soluted
Particles of the Spirits and Sulphur, diffuse an equal, and moderate heat to
all parts. But if the blood, by reason of an ill manner of feeding, and want of
Concoction, be crude and watery, then it is less inkindled in the Heart; and
from thence follow a frigid intemperance of the whole, difficult breathing and
wheesing, with a weak pulse, and languishing; as in Cachectical people, those
distempered with the Green Sickness, and such as are about to die, may be
perceived: but if the blood becomes too luxuriant, and apt to grow turgid, by
reason of plenty of Sulphur being carried forth, or of its Effluvia being
restrained, or of eating hot things; either its Accension or Fermentation in
the Heart, is very much increased, so that from thence a Feverish heat, and
greater effervescencies than usual, are stirred up in the whole. This various
Fermentation of the blood in the Heart, according to the various temper of the
same, may be illustrated by the example of Wine: fresh Must, that is yet crude,
though it be boiled, or put on the fire, will not burn; but this being purified
and brought to maturity, is easily inkindled, but sends forth a small flame,
and quickly out. The same at first growing hot, or otherwise warmed, if
inkindled, is greatly inflamed, and for the most part is consumed by its
burning.

Whilst the Blood, after this manner being rarefied, or inkindled in the Heart,
and from thence growing hot, through the passages of the Vessels, is resolved
into minute parts, some little bodies depart from its loosned frame, which
refuse at last to be united, and fitted with the rest of the Liquor: but these
are of a twofold Nature; either thin, which like smoke from the burning fire,
or Effluvia from a Fermenting Liquor, do evaporate from the Liquor of the
Blood, by a constant Diaphoresis, through the breathing holes of the Body; or
more thick, which like ashes left after burning or the settling dregs after
Fermentation, ought to be soon strained from the mass of Blood, and to be
carried forth of doors: for otherwise, by their confusion, they produce notable
perturbations in the Blood. Whereby the Blood growing more hot, is dissolved in
the Heart, therefore these recrements, both Fuliginous and Earthy, are more
plentifully heaped together; and when by reason of too great congestion, they
cannot be presently subdued and secluded from the mass of Blood, they bring
forth a swelling up of the Blood and Feverish Heats.

Concerning the Motion, Heat, and Natural Fermentation of the Blood, in the
equal tenor of which, the means of our Health consists, what has hitherto been
spoken, shall suffice. We will treat a little more largely of the
preternatural, or too great effervescency, on which the types, and Paroxysms of
Fevers depend: I call that too much, or Preternatural Fermentation, when the
Blood, (like a Pot boiling over the fire) grows hot above measure, and being
rarefied with a swelling spume, distends the Vessels, excites a more quick
pulse, and like a Sulphurous Liquor having taken fire, diffuses a burning heat
on every side.

This kind of motion or Fermentation of the Blood, will be best of all
illustrated by an example of Wines growing hot. For Wines, besides the gentle
and equal Fermentation, by which they are at first purified, at some times do
so remarkably grow hot, and boil up, that they fly out of the mouth of the
Vessel, and if they are closely stopped up, cause it to burst in pieces. After
this manner, as if struck with fury, unless they are immediately drawn away
from the Tartar; or their Lees into another Vessel, they will not cease from
growing hot, until the Spirit being very much loosned, and the Sulphur or Salt
too much exalted, they are either made unsavory, or degenerate into a sowrness.

Such an Effervescency in wont to be stirred up for two causes chiefly: First,
When any extraneous thing, and not miscible, is poured into the Ton, (so some
drops of Tallow, or Fat, being dropped into the Cask; will produce this motion)
or secondly, when Wines being enriched with too rich a Lee or Tartar (by reason
of the Sulphurous parts being above measure exalted) conceive heats of their
own accord, and exceedingly boil up. For in whatsoever substance Sulphur
abounds, and its Particles being loosned from the mixture, consociate together,
and are bound close in one, there such immoderate heats are procured.

After a like (tho not wholly the same) manner, whereby Wines grow hot, the
boiling up of the Blood is induced, to wit, either what is foreign, and not akin
to the Blood, is mixed with it, that when it is not assimilated, is wont to
cause a Perturbation, and growing hot, until that Heterogeneous thing, is
either subdued or cast forth of doors; and the Particles of the Blood being
confused and troubled, are at last shaken forth, and that they get again their
former place and position in the mixture. Or, Secondly, the Blood grows hot
above measure, because some Principle, or its constitutive Element, ( viz.
Spirit or Sulphur) is carried forth beyond its Natural temper, and becomes
enraged; whereby indeed the Particles of this or that, being not agreeable to
the rest, are loosned from the mixture; being loosned, they become more violent
than they ought, shake much the Liquor of the Blood, and bring forth a heat,
which is not allayed, till the Blood being as it were inflamed, burns forth
with the long fire of a Fever. By either way, whether the Blood grows hot in
the Vessels, by reason of the pouring in of a thing not miscible, or by reason
of the rage of the Spirit, or Sulphur being carried forth, because from thence
its frame is more loosned, therefore it is more inkindled in the Heart; and the
active Particles first loosned from the Ferment there implanted, do grow
exceeding hot, leap forth from the mixture, and disperse on every side by their
motion, a strong heat, and as it were fiery: but yet with this difference, that
the Effervency, which depends upon the mingling of some extraneous thing with
the Blood, is for the most part short, or renewed, which, when what was
Heterogeneous is separated or subdued, is quieted of its own accord, and the
shaken parts of the Blood, and put out of order, easily return to their Natural
site and disposition. But the Ebullition which arises from the inordination of
the Spirit or Sulphur being enraged, is continual; to wit, here the whole mass
of the Blood is so loosned, and dissolved from the strict bond of the mixture,
that as an Oily Liquor having taken fire, it ceases not to grow hot, or to be
inflamed, till the Particles of Spirit, or Sulphur, or the Combustible matter,
be for the most part burnt out.

There remains yet a third manner of Preternatural Fervency, whereby the Blood
is subject to alteration, which happens not to Wine, but most often to Milk;
viz. when at any time, from a Morbific cause, a coagulation of its Liquor is
induced, so that its substance is poured forth, and goes into parts, and there
is a separation made of the thick and earthy from the thin; by which means the
Blood is not fitly circulated in the Vessels, but that its congealed portions,
being apt to be fixed in the extreme parts, or to stand still in the Heart, do
interrupt the equal motion, or grievously hinder it: For the sake of the
restoring of which Effervency, greater are wont to be stirred up in the Blood,
to wit, such as happen ordinarily in a Plurisie, the Plague, Smallpox, or the
Venereal Disease.

CHAP. III. Of Intermitting or Agues Fevers.
BY the Premises which we have spoken of already, concerning the Anatomy,
Motion, and Heats of the Blood, there now lies open an easy passage to the
handling of Fevers. The Notions which are commonly set forth, concerning a
Fever, out of the force and Etymology of the word, I here purposely omit: It
may be described after this manner, that it is, An inordinate motion of the
Blood, and a too great Heat of it, with burning and thirst, and other Symptoms
besides, whereby the Natural economy or Government, is variously disturbed. As
we have remarked already, concerning the growing hot of the Blood, so now we do
of a Fever, that indeed, its accession is either short, and by fits, which is
therefore termed Intermitting; or else great, and long protracted, which is
called a continual Fever. We will first speak of the Intermitting Fever.

Tho an Intermitting Fever, in our Popular Idiom, is known by a proper Name,
and is distinguished contrary to a Fever commonly taken, yet because it has
too great Effervency of the Blood joined to it, it is to be called a Fever. It
is peculiar to this, from a continual Fever, that it has certain remissions,
or times of intermission, that every fit begins with cold or shaking, for the
most part, and ends in Sweat; that the accessions or coming of the fits, return
at set Periods, and certain intervals of times, that a Clock is not more exact.
Wherefore, we will first discourse concerning this Fever in general, what sort
of heat of the Blood it is which continues its fit, and from whence it is
raised up. Secondly, Wherefore the fit appears equally with cold and shaking,
as with sweat following. Thirdly, What may be the cause of the Inmission, as
also of its certain set Periods. Fourthly and Lastly, Are added some
irregularities of Intermitting Fevers, as when now cold, now heat or sweat is
wanting; or when the Periods are wandering and uncertain, when the Remission or
space of Intermission, is not equal, but now comes sooner, now later, and
sometimes redoubled: and I will endeavor to show the reasons of these: and of
other Phenomena or appearances, which variously happen in this Distemper. These
being laid open, we will go on to unfold in the next Chapter, the division of
an Intermitting Fever, and the kinds of it.

As to the first: The Effervency of the Blood in an Intermitting Fever, (or
Ague) for the time of the fit, is as violent and strong as in a continual
Fever: wherefore, it is concluded, that the parts of the Blood, among
themselves, or some Heterogeneous thing being mixed with it, do strive
together, and Ferment above measure. But there is required, that they may
Ferment, or too greatly boil up among themselves, that some Principle, as
chiefly Spirit or Sulphur, being too much exalted and enraged, do appear above
the rest; which, when it cannot be yoaked with them, brings in a continual
strife and heat: but from this cause, a continual Fever draws its rise,
because such an Ebullition of the Blood, being once begun, is not suddenly
allayed, and when it is appeased, it does not afterward presently return.
Wherefore for an Intermitting Fever, it is to be supposed, that some
Heterogeneous thing is mingled with the Blood, whose Particles, when they are
not assimilated, make so long an Ebullition of the same, till either being
kneaded, they are rendered miscible, or being subtilised, are shut forth of
doors. Wherefore, such a matter being brought under, or shut forth of doors,
the fit ceases, and when this matter springs again, it stirs up a new
Ebullition, and so a new fit is brought on.

Concerning this Matter, which being mixed with the Blood, induces the
periodical Heats, and the other Symptoms of an Intermitting Fever, it is very
ambiguously, and diversely disputed among Physicians, where it is generated, in
what seat or place it lodges, and by what means it so exactly observes, the
times of its Motion, and Ebullition. But it would be a work of too much labor
and tediousness, to recount here all the Arguments, of the Ancients, and
Moderns, to reduce them into order and to weigh their reasons; Wherefore,
doubting, I propose what has come into my mind, when I thought deeply of the
matter, and submit to the judgment of others.

Of necessity there is something, which brings in the Heat of the Blood exactly
periodical, that is generated in our Body at the several periods, or accessions
of the Fever, always in a set measure, and equal proportion, and is
communicated to the mass of Blood; with which when the Blood is filled to a
plenitude, it forthwith grows turgid, and conceives an heat: But this is
supposed to be either an Excrementitious humor, sliding down into some Mines,
which by degrees, and at a set time, being brought to an increase, and moved,
Ferments with the Blood: or it is the nutritious Juice, supplied from the
matter of Food, and delated in weight and measure, which, when it is not
assimilated, by reason of a defect in sanguification, being heaped up to a
fullness, for its own expulsion, induces a turgency in the Blood. The reason of
Intermitting Fevers, is commonly explicated by the former way, and the causes
of the Intermission, and set times of approach, are fetched from the nature of
the Humor, and the seat, or place where it is cherished. The Nest, or Mine of
this Disease, almost by an unanimous consent, is fixed on the first shop of the
Body, and from hence the reason of the Intermission is fetched, and the
continual difference of an Intermitting Fever: but they affirm the matter to
be Choler, Phlegm, and Melancholy; and as these humors are said to putrify
flower, or sooner, so the Feverish courses, are said to be absolved, in the
space of one or more days. But this Opinion, after the Circulation of the Blood
has been made plainly known to all, is deservedly rejected. For when the Blood
never stagnates in the Vessels, but washes every place with a perpetual motion,
and continually carries away their filth, it is impossible that the Mine of
this Disease should subsist in the Mesaraick Veins, where it is commonly
asserted to be: as to what belongs to the cavities or dens, for the heaping up
of the humors in the Viscera, it neither appears, by what means such should be
formed without a Tumor or Imposthume; nor by what instinct, such humors, shut
up in their Nest, do increase, are consumed, and lastly spring forth again, at
so exact intervals of times. Besides, what is affirmed concerning Bile, Phlegm,
and Melancholy, and of their periodical motions, we hold wholly suspected;
because these sort of humors, are not afforded sincere, such as are described
in the Schools: but the Blood, having gotten a various disposition, now being
hotter, now colder, its nature imitates the qualities of such humors; or in its
Circulating, it lays aside its Recrements, which being deposited in little
Chests or Vessels, are falsely believed to be Morbific, and Preternatural
humors. Wherefore, as the nutritious Juice, is the only humor wherewith the
mass of Blood is daily refreshed, and its supplements are made still in
measure, and proportion, without doubt, the periodical heats of the Blood, are
to be drawn from the accession and commixtion of this.

I have already remarked concerning the Particles of the Blood, a triple state
of crudity, maturation, and defection: to wit, the nourishing Juice, supplied
from the daily Food, comes crude, is mixed with the Blood, and being for some
time Circulated, is assimilated to it, and is ripened into a perfect humor:
afterward growing stale, it goes into parts and is laid aside. Whilst after
this equal manner, the Blood is continually restored, and its losses repaired,
it very quietly Ferments, without any trouble, or immoderate heat, and is
Circulated within the Vessels; but if the supplement of the nourishing Juice,
is not (as before) ripened, nor goes into Blood, by a perfect digestion, its
Particles being confused with the Blood, remain as it were some Heterogeneous
thing, and not exactly akin, in the mass of Blood; with which, when it is
filled to a plenitude, the Blood forthwith grows troubled, and conceives a
Feverish heat, whereby the fresh supply of this depraved Juice, is either
overcome or cast forth of doors. I say therefore, from the first instant, in
which the nourishing Juice is not assimilated with the Blood, its Particles,
tho mixed with it, are as yet Circulated with it, without any great tumult or
perturbation, and so afterward till the mass of the Blood is filled with them
to a turgency: but then it quickly boils up, and conceives a heat: almost after
the same manner, as new Beer put into Bottles, which, if they are closely
stopped, that nothing may evaporate, is at first contained in those Vessels,
without heat or force; afterward when the Effluvia being still restrained, the
mass of the Liquor swells up, notably Ferments, and by reason of the force of
Fermentation, oftentimes makes the Bottles fly in pieces: also this happens at
a set time, and in the space of so mnay hours, as in an Intermitting Fever,
the Liquor arises to its height of turgescency.

There yet remains a difficulty, for what cause the nutritious Juice, being
confused with the Blood, is not assimilated, but degenerates into an
Heterogeneous, and Fermentative matter: I suppose this to be done, for the most
part, not by the default of the Aliments, nor yet of the Bowels, but by the
vice of the Blood it self. For the Blood, even as Wine, sometimes passes from
its native and genuine disposition, into an acid, sour, or austere disposition;
and because the Blood makes Blood, it comes to pass, that when it is departed
from its due temper, it easily perverts the provision of the nutritious Juice,
by which it should be repaired. What that disposition of the Blood is, and by
what means contracted, shall be told hereafter, when we speak of the kinds of
Intermitting Fevers, and of their evident, and Procatarctick causes. The Heat,
or Effervescency therefore of the Blood, which constitutes the fit of an
Intermitting Fever, depends only upon the assimilation of the nourishing Juice
being hindered; the Particles of this being commixed with the Blood, are not
(as before) ripened, nor are made into perfect Blood; but by the mixture of
these, the mass of Blood (as it were new drink) is imbued with little Bodies
greatly Fermentative; when the which are more thickly heaped together, and the
Blood is filled with them to a swelling up, it presently grows hot, and a
mighty agitation, and strife of the Particles is made, by which, they break,
and subtilise one another, till at length the vital Spirit getting the
dominion, and the rest being brought under, what is extraneous is thrust forth
of doors, from the company of which, the Blood being freed, the remission, and
intermission of the aguish fit follows; but afterward from a new supply of
this Juice, a new fit is brought on.

Secondly, As to the shaking, or cold preceding the heat, in this Distemper, I
say, when the Particles of the nourishing Juice, do proceed from a state of
crudity, toward maturity, but do not attain it, they contract a notable
sowrishness, with which they greatly prick, and haule the nervous parts, and
cause the sense of cold: even as new Beer, which being stopped close in
Bottles, passes from a sweet into an acid and nitrous taste, that for the
cuttingness and cold, can scarce be swallowed. When therefore, the Particles of
this sort of crude Juice, being endued with a Nitrous sowrness, do fill the
mass of the Blood to a fullness, or to a swelling up, and when they being more
thickly heaped together, begin to enter into a Flux, they first of all strike
down the Vital Spirits, with their sharpness, and somewhat overthrow their heat;
wherefore the Blood becomes colder, and is more slowly circulated: yea, and by
reason of the defect of heat, the sense of cold is perceived in the whole Body,
and a pulse very rare exists. Moreover, when the nervous and solid parts, are
watered with this sort of acetous Juice, for their last nourishment, by the
Flux of this, which happens together with the turgescency of the Blood, these
sensible parts are pulled, and irritated into Tremblings and Convulsions. And
this without doubt is the true and genuine cause of the cold and shaking, which
are excited in a fit of the intermitting Fever; to wit, the Flux, and swelling
up of the nourishing Juice, degenerated into a Nitrous matter, with which the
Spirits and Heat being suffused, are blunted, and the Nervous Bodies being
provoked, are moved into tremblings. But afterward, when these Nitrous
Particles being thrust forth, from some part, into the Superficies of the Body,
the Blood is somewhat freed from their weight and oppression, the Vital Spirits
recollect themselves, and begin to shine forth; but from thence a most intense
heat succeeds, because, both the mass of Blood, by reason of the growing hot
with the Feverish matter, being loosened, and also its mixture being laxed,
the Sulphureour Particles are more plentifully inkindled in the Heart; and
because (the pores of the skin, being possessed by the same matter, thrust
forth toward the circumference of the Body) the vaporous Effluvia are
restrained within, which do more shake, and make hot the Blood; that heat
persists still in the Blood, until that Fermentative matter being wholly burnt
out, and together with the adust recrements, remaining after the burning, being
fully brought under, and subtilised, and involved with the Serum, insensibly
evaporates by sweat, or transpiration.

Thirdly, These things being premised, it will not be hard to show the reasons
and causes of the intermission, as also of the set periods, viz. the
intermission follows, because all the Morbific matter is dispersed in one fit,
and so till new be substituted, there is a necessity that a remission follow.
But new matter begins to be begot, of which the last fit failed, to wit, the
mass of Blood being but now emptied, receives the nourishing Juice, and
perverts it (as before) by reason of its defect of due making of Blood, and of
Concoction, into a Fermentative matter; but its little plenty, stirs up little
or no trouble, or Fermentation; but when the Blood is filled to a swelling up,
it presently ferments, and is in Flux, even as when new Beer, or new Wine, shut
up a long while in a Vessel, at length, at a certain time, boils up, and leapes
forth at the mouth of the Vessel.

But that the Fits, or Accessions, do for the most part come again, at set
intervals of times, and that so certainly, that a Clock is not more exact; the
reason is, because the nourishable Juice, is for the most part supplied from
the Viscera, to the Blood flowing in the Vessels, in an equal measure and
manner; for tho we do not daily take exactly, so much meat and drink in weight
and dimension, yet, because we for the most part eat at set hours, for the
satisfying the Appetite, from the things eaten, and the mass of the Chyme
heaped up in the Bowels, an equal portion of the nutritious Juice is conveyed
to the Blood through the Milky Vessels: wherefore, if at such hours, so much of
the nutritious humor is poured into the Blood, which increasing to a fullness,
and swelling up, it brings on the fit that day: certainly, this being finished;
in the space of the same time, sufficient matter is laid up, for the following
fit: But if errors in feeding be committed, and that the sick indulging their
Appetite, eat more plentifully or inordinately, the approach of the fit
anticipates the wonted hour, by reason of the Bloods being filled sooner with
the Feverish matter; if that the sick are abstemious, and more sparingly take
their Food, the intermission is drawn out longer.

If it be yet asked, wherefore the periods of intermitting Fevers, be not of
one kind, and of the same distance, but that some repeat or come again daily,
others on the third or fourth day? The cause is the diverse constitution of the
Blood, to wit, whereby it is perverted from its due temper, now into a sourish,
now into an acid or sharp, or into an austere or harsh disposition. By reason
of the diverse evil constitution of this, the alible Juice, being fresh
carried, departs more or less from maturation, and is perverted into matter,
apt sooner or later to ferment. When the Blood has acquired a sour, hot, and
bilous disposition, I suppose that some part of the nourishing Juice is ripened
into perfect humor, and is assimilated with the Blood, and so goes into Food,
to be carried to the solid parts, and is affixed to them; but the other part of
it, from the Blood being too much cocted, and depraved, is changed into a
Feverish matter, and supposing, that half of the nutritious Juice is after
this manner perverted; in double the time, in which it is said to have a full
Concoction in our Body, (that is, after eight and forty hours) this kind of
Fermentative matter, rises to a plenitude, and turgescency, and then induces
the fit of a Tertian Fever. If that, by reason of the austere, and pontic
nature of the degenerated Blood, (in which a fixed Salt, with an Earthy Faeces
is exalted too much) and therefore apt to ferment more slowly, only a third
part of the nutritious Juice is corrupted, then in three times the space of the
aforesaid time, the fit is induced; that is, after seventy two hours, in which,
the period of a Quartan, is wont to be concluded. But, if by reason of a
greater infection of the Blood, almost the whole supplement of the nutritious
Juice is perverted into a Feverish matter; then in the space of that time, in
which the plenary coction ought to be absolved in the Vessels and habit of the
Body, (that is after twenty four hours) this matter arises up to the motion of
turgescency, and brings on the Quotidian fit. And hence it comes to pass, that
in a Quartan Fever, strength and courage do not presently fail, whilst in a
Tertian, the sick are wont to become more weak; but in a Quotidian Fever, they
are sooner brought into languishing, and greatest weakness: to wit, in each, as
more or less of the nutritious Juice goes into the Food of the Disease, so much
also is drawn away, from the strength and firmness of the Body. But more fully
of these, when we treat of the several kinds of Intermitting Fevers, and the
Causes of them.

Against the equal Circuits of these Fevers, it is argued: that for the most
part, the fits do anticipate the set time of the day, by the space of some
hours, and sometimes also come after it. But in truth, this objection is taken
away, if the times of intermission be computed, not by days, but by hours; for
so the intervals which but now seemed to be now sooner, now longer protracted,
will appear for the most part equal, by this Rule; forasmuch as in respect of
the day, it is said a Tertian Fever, sometimes prevents the wonted time of its
accession, two, three, or more hours, or comes after it; in the mean time,
every circuit exactly repeats or comes again, every time, after so many hours.
Wherefore the chief differences of Intermitting Fevers, consist in this only,
that the time of the accession in one Fever, comes more swiftly, and in
another more slowly, viz. now at twenty four hours distance, now at thirty
four, now at seventy or the like.

From what has been said, (unless I am deceived) it clearly appears, what the
Effervescency of the Blood is, which constitutes the fit of an Intermitting
Fever, from whence the forerunners of cold and shaking, and lastly, what may
be the reason of the intermission, and of the set periods. But that these, and
many other appearances of this distemper, depend upon the evil disposition of
the Blood, and because of the depravation of the nutritious Juice, and not from
humor, lurking in some mine, will yet more manifestly appear, from the
collation of the signs and symptoms, which are to be met with, worthy of note,
in this distemper: then secondly, from the Procatartic, or more remote causes
being truly weighed, which are wont to induce this distemper: and thirdly, and
lastly, from the ways of the Crisis, and Cures, by which this Disease, either
ceases of its own accord, or is driven away, by the help of Medicines.

First, Among the Signs, the Pulse and Urine, deserve the chief consideration:
The Pulse, the cold fit coming on, is very rare, and low, which clearly argues,
the Heat, and Vital Spirits in the Blood, to be as it were overwhelmed, by some
crude matter, not easily combustible; just as a fire inkindled on the Hearth,
and then covered with green wood, glows very slowly, and flames forth little,
which afterward, the crude humor being blown away, breaks forth into an open
and very strong flame: so also, the Blood, the crude matter, which is in Flux,
being something overcome, or dispersed, is very much inkindled; and what remains
in the Blood is burnt up, when fermenting with the Particles of it, and induces
a most violent heat, with thirst; wherefore the Blood growing impetuously hot,
is urged with a vehement, and most swift Pulse: otherwise, it being too much
heaped together in the Heart might cause the danger of choking.

As to the Urine; that is imbued (especially in a Tertian Fever) with a deep
color, and as it were inflamed, also when the Contents are wanting; which
seems to denote a scorching of the Blood, and too adust temper: moreover, in
this Distemper, different from others, the Urine, for the most part is ill,
when the Patient is pretty well, and on the contrary; forasmuch as all the time
of the intermission, it is at a great distance from its natural state, it
becomes filled with a red color, and thick, being exposed to the cold, and
lays down a plentiful sediment, like to Bole-Armoniack; which is of necessity
to be so done, because in the whole interval of the remission, the Feverish
matter is circulated with the Blood, and there rises to maturity, with a secret
increase. But in the middle of the fit, when the heat, and burning are at the
greatest, the Urine is laudable, and comes more near to the natural, viz. the
Fermentative matter, being sent to the Circumference of the Body.

The symptoms preceding the fit, confirm the same thing; for many hours before
the fit begins, a perturbation of the humors, and blood, is perceived; an
Headache, Vertigo, sparkling of the Eyes, unquiet Sleep, etc. which plainly
show, the Blood first infected with the Fermenting matter, and the assault of
the fit to be only so long deferred, until the mass of the Blood is filled to a
swelling up, with the same kind of matter: The forerunners of the approach of
the fit are, now a paleness at the ends of the Fingers, or Toes, or in the
Nails, sometimes a Convulsion, or numness; now a coldness, and pain in the Loins
and Thighs, and sometimes a shivering and trembling invade the whole Body, which
clearly show, the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, and also the thin Liquor in
the Nervous parts, first to conceive the motion of Fermentation, and this
Effervescency, not to be excited from any other fireplace, or mine. If it be
objected, that the sick are most often infested with Vomiting, about the time
of the fit; from whence it may seem to be concluded, that the chiefest hurtful
matter is established in the Ventricle, and in the first passages, especially,
when this distemper is chiefly cured, by the timely taking of a Vomit; I
confess, very great Vomitings are sometimes stirred up, in the fit of an
intermitting Fever; but this more often happens, because in the Feverish
shivering, the membranes of the whole Body are pulled; wherefore the Ventricle
also, as it is a very Nervous part, is distempered with a Convulsion, and
having from thence contracted a Spasm, casts forth upwards whatsoever lurks in
its bosom. Besides, if that the Choler-bearing Vessels, swell up with Bile or
Choler, by the same Convulsion also of the Viscera, the Bile is pressed forth
into the Duodenum by the Galish passage, and is emptied into the Ventricle, and
there, by its fierceness, provokes yet to more cruel Vomiting, wherefore for
the most part, the vomiting which is excited for this reason, follows the
shaking only. But that the Choler was not in the Stomach before the fit
troubled it, but only pressed forth from the Choleduct passage, by the Spasm
and Convulsive motions of the Viscera, and poured forth into the Ventricle,
appears from hence, because if a Vomit be given in the midst of the interval,
between the two fits, little or nothing of bilous matter will be drawn forth;
besides, this bitter humor is of that fierceness, that it cannot be long
contained in the Ventricle, but presently it will procure the pain of the
Heart, and Vomiting. Besides this sort of Vomiting, excited in the shaking fit,
sometimes a Vomiting is provoked in the midst of the burning fit, or in the
sweat, the cause of which is, the redundancy of the bilish humor in the Blood;
of which if there be greater plenty, than what diluted with Serum may be sent
forth by Sweat, a great part of it, whilst the Blood is circulated about the
crevises of the Liver, is laid aside in the Choleduct Vessels; which, when
being filled to a distention, exonerate themselves, and send away the Choler to
the Intestines and Ventricle, and there a Convulsion being presently stirred
up, sometimes Vomiting is provoked, and sometimes the Belly becomes loose, and
the Stools liquid. In this Year 1657. I observed very many affected after this
manner, for when after an hot and dry Summer, about the middle of Autumn, an
Intermitting Fever generally raged, the sick were wont suddenly to grow very
ill, in the middle of their hot fit, and sometimes also in their sweating, and
the Sweat being struck in, to be taken with Swooning; but shortly after, when a
Choleric Vomiting followed, they were eased.

Not only the signs and symptoms, but the Procatartic or more remote Causes of
this Disease, clearly indicate, that it takes its rise from the temper of the
Blood being changed: because Intermitting Fevers, are most frequent in the
season, and places, in which the Blood receives the greatest alteration from
the Air, viz. either in the Spring, when the vernal heat shutting out the
Winters cold, causes the Blood, before benumed, and apt to be more slowly
moved, to begin to flourish, and luxuriate in the Vessels, and from thence, to
get a bilous and hot temper: or in the Autumn, when the Blood being torrified,
or roasted by the Summers heat, and therefore its Spirits very much depressed,
and Salt and Sulphur exalted, acquires now a sharp and Choleric, now a binding
and austere disposition: wherefore, at this season, Fevers, now Tertian, now
Quartan, are frequent; besides, in some places, there is that constitution of
the Heaven, that on all men whatsoever, there comes either a Tertian or (more
frequently) a Quartan Fever; although in the first offices, where the Mine of
the Disease is commonly believed to be lodged, there be no congestion of
humors, by reason of an ill manner of living, or sickly disposition. Yea, they
most easily fall into this Disease, who have their inwards firm and strong, and
who abound with a lively heat: on the contrary, those who by reason of a weak
Concoction, heap up Crudities in the first passages continually, that they are
prone to the Dropsy, or Cachexia, remain free, for the most part, from this
Distemper; to wit, the Blood being made more watery, (like Wine degenerated
into a tastless substance) is altogether unapt to be fermented.

No less, does the Cure of Intermitting Fevers seem to prove this our
Assertion, whether it be Natural and Critical, or Artificial, and performed by
the help of Medicines. As to the first, Intermitting Fevers are wont to be
terminated, after a twofold manner. The first is, when from the fits
themselves, the temper of the Blood is altered, and often times is reduced into
its Natural disposition. For when in every coming of the fit, very much of
Sulphur, and adust Salt is burnt out, and exhaled by Sweat, the Liquor of the
Blood, by that means, becomes more temperate, and less torrid: wherefore,
oftentimes this Disease is cured, at six or seven periods, and of its own
accord ceases: but if it be longer protracted, and that the Blood being somewhat
changed, from the sharp and bilous temper, or disposition, is not restored to
its Natural temper, sometimes it degenerates into an Acid, Watery, and also
Pontic or saltish temper, from whence a long Tertian Fever passes into a
Quotidian, or a Quartan; also oftentimes, because the Blood is greatly
depraved, by the long continuance of this Fever, the Jaundies, or the Scurvy,
or the Cachexia follow. The other manner, whereby this Disease is terminated,
is, when the change of the Air, or the Country, brings a notable alteration of
the Blood: for so Fevers begun at the times of the Equinoxes, are ended about
the time of the Solstices; also the sick, traveling into another Region, often
grow well.

As to the cure of it, by the Institutions of the Medicines, it uses to be done
two ways, viz. Empirically, and Dogmatically; and in this Disease, Empirical
remedies, sought from Quack-salvers, and old Women, are more esteemed, and
oftentimes do more than the prescriptions of Physicians, administered after the
exact method of cureing.

Empirical Remedies, which are said to cure Intermitting Fevers or Agues, are
of that sort, which drive away the approaching Fit, without any Evacuation: and
are either taken inwardly, or are outwardly applied, where the Pulses chiefly
beat, viz. For the most part, they are bound either to the region of the heart,
or to the handwrists, or to the soles of the feet; these sometimes are so
commonly known to help, that some have warranted the sudden cure of this
Disease, by these Remedies, under the pain of some Forfeiture: Wherefore it is
worth our inquiry, how these operate, and by what way or means they stop the
Feverish accessions. It is clear, First, that those which are outwardly
applied, do immediately impart force, and action to the Blood, and Spirits; and
when they drive away the Fit, by preventing without the Evacuation of humor, or
any matter of necessity, the reason of this effect consists only in this, that
by the use of these sort of Medicines, the turgescency or swelling up of the
Blood, with the Feverish matter, and Fermentation are stopped, to wit from the
Medicine tied about the Body, certain little Bodies, or Effluvia are
communicated to the Blood, which do very much fix, and bind together the
particles of it, or also, as it were precipitate them, by fusing and shaking
them; and by either way, the spontaneous growing hot of the Blood, is hindered:
as when cold water is put into a boiling Pot, or as when Vinegar, or Alum is
flung into new and working Beer, presently Fermentation ceases, and the Liquor
acquires a new taste, and consistency, whereby it becomes fit to be drunk, as if
it had been kept to ripen a long time. But that these Ague-stoppers do work
after this manner, it is plainly seen, because those which are of principal
note, do excel in a Styptic, and binding force, or else with a precipitating
virtue; hence Sea Salt, Nitre, Sal-gemmae, the Juice of Plantan,
Shepherds-burse, any binding Herbs pounded with Vinegar, and the like, bound to
the wrists; the root of Yarrow, Tormentile, also Campher hung about the neck,
are said to take away this Disease: yea, those also which are taken inwardly,
are of the same rank; The Juice of Plantan, Red-rose water, Alum, for that they
fix, and constrain the Blood, a decoction of Piper, Sal Ammoniac, or of
Wormwood, Spirit of Vitrial, also a sudden passion of anger, or fear, forasmuch
as they precipitate the Blood, by fusing and shaking it, do oftentimes hinder
the Agues approach: even as the Concussion, and shaking much, any Liquour, or
the infusion of astringent things into it, hinder its spontaneous Effervescency
and rage. It is usual with some Empiricks, for the cure of Agues, to tie a
little knot in a Linen rag, or a piece of Paper roled up, so strickly to the
wrists, pressing hard upon the beating of the Pulse, that the circulation of
the Blood is somewhat hindered, and by this means, the Aguish fit coming on, is
driven away. Very many by this way, I have none to be most certainly cured of a
tedious sickness; the reason of which seems to be, that whilst the Blood is
hindered from its motion in any part, it grows more tumultuous in the other
parts; and so, by this perturbation, stirred up in the whole Blood, the
spontaneous Effervescency of the Liquor, being about to follow, is hindered. But
that the Fit, by this, or any other means, being once hindered, does not
afterward easily return, the reason is; Because, if this Feverish, and
depraved matter, be contained longer in the Blood, it is afterward cocted, and
in some measure ripened: and therefore the Blood does not (as before)
altogether pervert, either this, or the provision coming to it anew, but begins
to digest and assimilate it: besides, when the Fit is once stopped, its custom
is broke, by the instinct of which alone, Nature oftentimes repeats those her
Errors: for, as, when it has once made a fault, it is wont more readily to do
ill after the same way; so when it once omits its fault, it more easily
accustoms it self to do better.

The dogmatical cure, is instituted for the most part, by Vomitory and Purging
Medicines, also with the letting of Blood; with which the sick are miserably
tormented, and the Disease seldom profligated or driven away; that deservedly,
this Distemper is called the shame of Physicians; but Tertian Fevers are
sometimes carried away by a Vomit given just before the coming of the Fit,
which indeed happens (as I think) for the reason before mentioned. For I have
said, That the cause of a Tertian Fever, is an evil disposition of the Blood,
whereby it passes into a four and bilous Nature; and therefore it does not
rightly assimilate the nutritious Juice brought to it, but changes it into a
Fermentative matter; wherefore, if the Bile or Choler be copiously drawn forth
of the Blood, that Choleric and hot intemperance is very much taken away, and
that Fermentative power ceases of it self, But Emetick Medicines do chiefly
perform this, for if they operate-strongly, a Convulsion is not only brought to
the bottom of the Ventricle, but also the Duodenum, with an inverse motion, is
drawn together toward the Pylorus, and the Choler by a continual thrusting
forward, being squees'd forth from the Choleduct passage, is poured into the
Ventricle, which is presently cast out by Vomit; which being copiously
performed, the galish bladder is almost emptied, and after that, it becomes a
receptacle, that draws forth, and separates the bilous humor, or the particles
of adust Sulphur and Salt plentifully poured into the Blood; the next Fit
sometimes is by this means prevented, not because the mine of the Disease is
extirpated by Vomit, but because an Evacuation and motion is excited, contrary
to the Feverish motion, and for that reason, the spontaneous Effervescency of
the Blood is prevented. Also by this means, sometimes the Disease is taken away
after the Fit, because this way, the Blood is fully cleared from the bilous
humor. It is worthy observation, that in a Quartan Fever, Vomits profit
nothing, and seldom in a Tertian, unless administered presently at the
beginning, whilst the Feverish disposition is yet light, and not fully
confirmed.

Concerning Intermitting Fevers in general, there yet remain some Irregulars
of them, to be explicated, which vary from the wonted manner: for unless these
unusual appearances be solved, this our Hypothesis will seem to be defective,
and to halt in one part. First therefore, they are wont sometimes to lack the
cold or shaking fit. This Intermitting Fever is frequent in Autumn, whose fits
are wont to exercise the sick, only with heat, and that most Violent, and in
many they come with great Vomiting, but no Sweat or Cold; then after four or
five periods, upon the coming on of the fit, the sick are wont to be chil, and
presently after to quake, and in the declination to sweat: The reason of this
was, because, from the very hot Summer, the Constitution of the Blood was
become sharp, and very much burnt: Wherefore, the Particles of the crude Juice,
being commixed with it, were presently terrified or made hot, and scorched;
that they did not at first, (like new Beer) grow hot with an Acrimony, and then
afterward blaze forth; but a turgescency being stirred up, (like dry wood laid
upon a fire) presently the whole took fire, and broke forth into flames; but
afterward, the Liquor of the Blood being fired by several fits, became less
torrid, that the depraved Alible Juice was not presently torrified, but passed
into a Nitrous matter, and fermenting with a sharpness, which at first swelling
up, induced the sense of cold to the whole Body. When the cold fit was begun,
for the most part Sweat concluded it: which indeed happened, because the Blood
being made more watery, is more easily resolved into vapor, with the Feverish
matter, even as a watery Liquor is more easily drawn forth by distillation,
than what is Oily, or of a more thick consistency.

It often happens, in the declination of this Disease, when the fits begin to
lessen, that the sense of cold and shaking, by little and little are
diminished, and at length vanish, and the fit only troubles the sick, with a
light burning: The reason of which is, because at this time, the Blood being
somewhat restored, toward its natural state, begins to concoct and ripen the
crude juice; so that a great part of it is assimilated: but some Excrements,
being heaped together in the Blood, bring forth as yet a light burning: but
when the Feverish Particles, do not participate of the Nitrous Acrimony, the
Fermentation of the Blood is induced without any shivering, by which, what was
extraneous burns forth, is either subdued, or carried forth of doors. Sometimes
also, in the declination of this Disease, the fits appear without any burning,
only with a light cold: The reason of which is, because the Morbific matter,
being rather Nitrous, than Sulphurous, when it is in Flux, does somewhat blunt
the Natural Heat; and by that means is dissipated, and vanishes, without any
great deflagration.

There is yet a great doubt concerning the intervals of the periods, which
sometimes seem to be double in the same Fever, that the first Accession answers
to the third, and either perhaps comes in the morning; and again the second to
the fourth, and both happen in the Evening; and so forward: wherefore, the
Fever bearing this figure, is wont to be named a double Tertian, or Quartan,
of which it does not easily appear, how they should be done, if the fits depend
upon the evil disposition of the Blood, and from thence on a Congestion to a
Turgescency of the depraved Nourishing Juice: for which cause, they commonly
affirm, that this double figure is stirred up, or draws its original from a
double Nest, or Mine; but to me it seems most likely, that in this case,
sometimes it happens for the Fever to be simple, and of one kind, also its
types or figures to be alike, and all congruous one to another, but the error
to arise, because the interstitia of the periods, are not computed by hours,
but days: For when as, the beginnings of the fits are distant one from another,
not exactly twenty four hours, but either sixteen, or thirty hours, in a
Quotidian; and in a Tertian, not forty eight, but forty, or fifty six, more or
less, or thereabouts; it comes to pass, that every other fits, happen before,
and the others after Noon. To which also may be added, that the different
manner of eating, which the sick use, very often produces great inequalities of
figures: that sometimes the fit is redoubled twice in a day, as I have often
observed in Cachectical men, or full of ill humors, and living disorderly: but
it does not seldom happen, that Intermitting Fevers, repeat fits, which do
neither observe the same distance, nor bear altogether the figure of the same
mode. I have many times observed in a Quartan Fever, that besides the set
comings or Accessions, returning on the fourth day, about the same hour; some
wandering and uncertain fits, did infest the sick; that sometimes on the day
preceding, the wonted fit, sometimes on that following it, another fit (tho
lighter) was excited anew, with shivering, Heat, and Sweat, exactly like the
figure of an Intermitting Fever; and nevertheless, the primary Accession
returned at its accustomed time. This for the most part, is wont to happen,
either from diet evilly instituted, chiefly from surfeit, and drinking of Wine;
or else from Medicines wrongfully administered: The reason of which (unless I am
deceived) consists in this. The mass of Blood, being wont to be filled to a
swelling up, with the Fermentative matter, at a set time, often, by reason of
some errors in eating and drinking, heaps up more matter, than can be easily
dissipated in one fit; and when it unequally Cooks the same Fermentative
matter, it often happens, that it first shakes off its superfluous, or more
thin part, as it were by a certain skirmish, in a more light fit, but dispels
the more thick, (after the primary Accession) as yet remaining in the Blood, by
a Feverish Fermentation arising anew. And when the fits, in an Intermitting
Fever, redouble after this manner, either become more remiss, for that the
same matter in either, is only divided; and eventilated by two accessions.
Besides, when this Fermentative matter, or Nutritious Juice, depraved in its
circulation, is continued, partly in the Arteries and Veins, with the Blood,
and partly in the Nervous stock, and solid parts, it may happen, that both
humors do not ferment at once, but a great part of one may be dispersed in one
fit, and then a great part of the other, in another fit.

CHAP. IV. Of the kinds of Intermitting Fevers, and first of a Tertian.
WE shall easily accommodate to our Hypothesis, delivered in the former
Chapter, concerning the nature and beginning of Intermitting Fevers, all the
Phenomenon which belong to it, and the reasons of them. But as those which are
of this sort, do not observe the same space of Intermission, or of return, and
their figures, as to the appearances of their signs and symptoms, do not
altogether happen after the same manner; therefore according to the diversities
of these, and especially from the distance of the fits, the various species and
differences of Intermitting Fevers, are assigned. The chiefest division of
them is, into Tertian, Quotidian, and Quartan: We shall here remark the chief
things worthy of note concerning each of them.

It is called a Tertian Fever, not which is accomplished at the distance of
three days; but inclusively from the day in which one Fit begins, from thence
the other returns on the third. In the mean time, if the Fits be sometimes
longer, viz. protracted almost to twenty four hours, and the Remissions
anticipated also by their accessions, or comings of the Fits, the space is
oftentimes less by a night and a day. This Disease is commonly distinguished
into exquisite and spurious; The exquisite or exact Tertian Fever is, which
begins with a vehement shaking, to which succeeds a sharp and biting heat,
which goes off in sweat, and its Fit is finished in twelve hours, and that the
perfect intermission follows; In the spurious or bastard Tertian, the cold and
heat are more remiss, but the Fit is often extended beyond twelve hours, yea
often to eighteen or twenty. These differ as to the various disposition of the
Blood, which is in the former more torrid and sharp; therefore perverts the
alible Juice from Crudity, toward an adustion, wherefore a more vehement
Effervescency is stirred up; but as the matter more equally burns forth, it is
sooner finished. In the latter, besides the adustion, the Blood abounds with
too much serous humidity, wherefore, the nourishing Juice degenerates into a
Crude matter, and therefore less apt to be overcome, and to burn forth;
wherefore, its Fit is gentler, and more unequal, but is not finished but in a
longer space.

The Essence therefore of a Tertian Fever consists in this; That the Blood
(like Beer brewed with too high dried Malt) being too sharp, and torrid, does
not rightly subdue, and ripen the alible Juice, which is taken in from crude
things eaten, but very much perverts it into a nitrous-sulphurous matter; with
which, when the mass of Blood is filled to a swelling up, like new Beer stopped
up in Bottles, it conceives an heat: From the flux of this nitrous matter,
which blunts the heat, and vital spirits, and pulls the nervous parts, first
the cold, with shaking is excited; then the vital spirit geting strength again,
this matter growing hot in the Blood, begins to be subdued, and inkindled in
the heart; from whose deflagration, an intense heat is diffused thorough the
whole body; then its relics being separated, and involved with serum, are
sent away by sweat.

This torrid Constitution of the Blood, consists in this, That it is impregnated
more than it ought, with particles of Sulphur and Salt; wherefore, the
Procatartick causes, which dispose to this Disease, are an hot and bilous
temperament, a youthful age, hot diet, as an immoderate use of Wine and spiced
Meats, but especially in the Spring, and autumnal feafons of the year, when the
Blood (as all vegetables) is apt to flower, and to ferment of its own accord.
By reason of these occasions, the liquor of the Blood, is want to be thoroughly
roasted, and to be changed into a choleric temper: and when it departs from
its natural Disposition, so much, that it perverts the nutritious Juice, into a
matter plainly Fermentative, the beginning of this Fever is induced; which
sometimes happens from this intemperance, being leasurely increased and brought
to the height; but more frequently, an evident cause raises up this disposition
into act, and we ascribe the origin of this Disease to some notable Accident.
Wherefore, lying on the Ground, or taking cold after sweating, or transpiration
being any ways hindered; also a Surfit, or a perturbation of the Stomach, from
any thing inordinately eaten; and lastly, What things soever stir up an
immoderate heat in the Blood, bring the lurking disposition of this Disease
into act: for that, from every such occasion, the nutritious Juice, being
heaped in the Blood, and somewhat depraved, conceives a Flux, and departing
from the rest of the Blood, ferments with a nitrous sharpness, then being
inkindled and shaken by the Spirit, and vital heat, it induces the Fit, with a
very strong burning.

A Tertian Fever, is wont to be more frequent in the Spring, at which time,
the Blood is livelier and richer, and therefore more fitted for this kind of
Feverish distemper. If this Fever being taken, be ended within a moderate
time, it is commonly said to be a Medicine, rather than a Disease; which is
partly true, because, by this means, the impurities of the Blood burn out, the
obstructions of the Viscera are discharged, and in truth the whole body is
ventilated, so that it is wholly freed from every Excrementitious matter, and
the seminary of growing Diseases. But if this Disease be long protracted, it
becomes the cause of many Sicknesses, and of a long want of Health. For from
hence the mass of the Blood is very much deprived of the vital Spirit, and
(like Wine too much fermented) in a manner grows lifeless: wherefore the
Jaundice, Scurvy, or Cachexia, follow this Fever, being long er'e it be cured
For by its frequent Fits, the vital Spirit very much evaporates, and because it
is but little restored by things eaten, the Blood therefore becomes weaker, and
almost without life: In the mean time, the particles of Salt, and Sulphur, are
carried forth more, and exalted; from whence, the Blood is made sharp, and
salt, and so more unfit for Circulation and Transpiration.

Moreover, This Disease being long protracted, oftentimes changes its Figure,
and from a Tertian Fever, becomes either a Quotidian, or sometimes a Quartan:
then sometimes from either, it returns into a Tertian. The reason of this is,
the disposition of the Blood being variously changed: which at first being
sharp, and bilous, had perverted the nutritious Juice, by that means, that it
arise to a fullness of swelling up on the third day; afterward, by the frequent
Deflagration, becoming less sharp, or in truth more waterish, it grows far
weaker as to its Constitution, so that it does very little, or not at all
assimulate the nourishable humor, and ripen it, and by that means, the increase
of the Fermentative matter is made sooner, and the Fits return daily: or else,
the Blood from a sharp and bilous intemperance, (the constitution of the
Heaven, or the year, bringing on this alteration) is changed into an austere,
or saltish, and therefore more slowly perverts the nourishing Juice, and the
increase of the Feverish matter, gathering together more slowly, it does not
conceive the Fits till on the fourth day: but if either, by the means of
Physic or Diet, the temper of the Blood is reduced from either Dyscrasie,
toward a bilous, the periods also are altered, and they resume the figure of a
Tertian.

Certain symptoms are wont to come upon a Tertian Fever, which are commonly
esteemed for the Crises of this Disease; and in truth sometimes, these
appearing, the Distemper either clearly ceases, or begins to abate of its
wonted fierceness. But these kind of signs, are chiefly these three, viz. The
Erysipelas, or an Eruption of pimples in the Lips, the yellow Jaundice, and an
Inflammation, or swelling suddenly excited, in this or that part of the body:
very often there happens after three or four Fits to the Sick, little ulcers,
with a crusty scab, to break forth about the Lips, and although there be no coming
away of any matter, in all the body beside, yet from hence they presage, that
the Fever is about to depart, which sometimes the event proves true. But
indeed sometimes, I have observed, that the hoped for effect has not succeeded,
but that the Fever pertinaciously, and for a long while has afflicted them,
when their Lips have been broken out. But as to what respects this Symptom, it
seems to arise, for that the Blood having got a more free Diaphoresis, it not
only thrusts forth adoors, the more thin, and smokie recrements, but also the
more thick; and when the same, in other parts more easily exhale through the
more open Pores, they stick in their passage about the Lips, by reason of the
skin being more strictly bound together; and because the vaporous matter,
abounds in particles of adust Salt, and Sulphur, being fixed in the skin, it
there hinders Circulation, and therefore induces Pustles, and little Ulcers;
perhaps the more hot breath, which is breathed forth from the mouth, and
nostrils, may contribute something to this Distemper, forasmuch as it scorches,
and burns the Blood, and Juices flowing thither: wherefore, it may be said,
That this eruption of Pustles, denotes only a more full Diaphoresis in the
whole, by which, the more thick, as well as the thin recrements of the adust
Blood, evaporate forth of doors. For I have known in some, from a Tertian
Fever, little welks like the small Pox to break out in their whole body, that
if by this more plentiful Ventilation, as it were a purging, the Blood be so
freed, that it recovers its pristine disposition, the Fever is cured: But if
(as sometimes it happens) some recrements, tho more thick, break forth, yet
others stay within, and still cherish the Feverish disposition, those little
Ulcers, argue only a greater taint of the Blood, and pertinacy of the Disease,
therefore it may be observed, when that scabs break out in the lips, if the
Fever does not presently abate, that it will be more grievous, and tedious for
the future.

Sometimes the yellow Jaundice comes upon a Tertian Fever, and cures it;
(which Hippocrates has also taken notice of) the reason of which is, because,
when the Blood has got a sharp or bilous disposition; that therefore it had
perverted the alible Juice, and from thence had heaped together excrementitious
matter, it is oftentimes freed by that Dyscrasie, when by a sudden Secretion,
the recrements of adust Salt and Sulphur, are more plentiful purged forth. This
the Choleduct vessels being irritated by Physic, or of their own accord, and
so pouring out plentifully the Bile, from the Blood, do often perform: because
Vomiting, Purging, and especially a Diarrhea or Lask, very much conduce to the
cure of this Disease, yea sometimes, the Blood it self, putting forth of its
own accord, thrusts forth the bilous recrements, as its off-scourings, and in
the circulating puts them forth in the skin, and so inducing the yellow
Jaundice, cures this Fever.

When an Inflammation, (as sometimes it is wont) comes upon this Distemper, the
Ague is commonly said to fall down into the part distempered with the Tumor.
But that by such a breaking forth, this Disease is cured, it is no wonder;
because the Blood by this means continually lays aside out of his bosom, the
provision of the degenerate nutritious Juice, and transfers it to the
distempered part; and therefore, the degenerate and fermentative matter in the
mass of Blood, does not easily arise to a fullness of swelling up: wherefore,
the Belly being perpetually loose, has by degrees helped some, for that the
Blood by this means, readily casts forth its burden, now growing low, and not
having a more full increase yielded to it: sometimes also, a Deafness suddenly
arising, the Tertian Fever has presently ceased, to wit, by reason of a
continual translation of the Feverish matter, from the bosom of the Blood,
into the head.

If that the Tertian Fever, within a short time, neither by the free accord of
Nature, declines by degrees, that it does clearly cease within seven or ten
periods, nor is cured by any of the aforesaid means, nor is removed by the help
of Medicine, but that after ten or twelve Fits, the sick are still grievously
afflicted, it will be a very hard task to cure it: because the Blood, from the
continual heaping of the Feverish matter, and by the frequent burnings,
becomes at length so depraved, that it concocts nothing truly for the
nourishment of the Body, and for the sustaining its strength; neither is it
able to shake thoroughly out of its bosom, the impurities and excrements, whereby
the Disease may make a Crisis or separation, but in truth, the same growing in
strength every day, the Blood, besides its Dyscrasie or evil disposition,
begins to be hurt somewhat in its mixture; wherefore, more frequent Fits infest
them, nor does a perfect Remission come between, but that the sick being very
weak and languishing, are almost continually Feverish, with thirst and heat:
when it is come to this pass, unless they are succored by remedies from Art,
or that the change of the Place, and Air, bring timely help, this Disease often
ends in death.

As to its cure: the method of healing is commonly directed to this one scope,
to wit, that the mine of the Disease may be extirpated, and that the Feverish
matter may be eradicated out of our Body, without any cherisher remaining, or
fear of relapsing; wherefore, Vomits, and Purges are diligently Instituted,
which when profiting nothing to the cure, but that the Patients strength is
very much broken, the sick are left by the Physicians, and the business is
wholly committed to Nature. The Intentions (as it seems to me) ought to be of
this sort: First, a restitution of the Blood, to its natural Temper. Secondly,
a prevention of the depravation of the nourishing Juice, as much as may be.
Thirdly, an Inhibition of the Feverish Fermentation, that the Fit may not be
excited. And these Indications take place, not only in a Tertian Fever, but in
any other intermitting Fever besides: which yet are to be performed, not by
the same ways and remedies, but by several, according to the diversity of the
Disease, of the condition of the sick, and of the symptoms chiefly urging.
However in the curing of this Disease, there is more to be attributed to
Nature, and to a good order of Diet, or way of Living, than to Physic.

1. Concerning the first Intention, to wit, that the Blood may be reduced to
its natural Temper, Vomits, letting of Blood, and Purging are of great use:
especially, if they be celebrated in the beginning of the Disease. Vomitories
help, both for that they Purge the Ventricle, that the first Concoction may be
better performed, and by that means the nourishing Chyme may be more purely
supplied, for matter of the Blood; but chiefly, for that by plentifully
pressing forth the Bile, from the Choleduct passage, they empty the Galish bag,
as by that means, the Bile is poured forth more full from the mass of Blood;
and so the Blood is purified, from the recrements of adust Salt and Sulphur.
The opening of a Vein cools and ventilates the Blood, as by that means, it is
less torrified, or scorched, and is circulated more freely in the Vessels,
without danger of burning. Also Purging, plentifully draws forth, and by
provoking expresses, or squeeses out, the Bile, from the galish Vessels, and
consequently from the mass of Blood. For this end, (to wit, the reduction of
the Blood) Digestives bring help, the more temperate Vinegars, or Acetous
things forasmuch as they fuse, and alter the Blood, and do attemper its fervor.
Sometimes also, the change of ^he Soil, and Air, notably amends the evil
constitution of the Blood, before all other Remedies whatsoever.

The second Intention, is excellently performed, by Diet, and an exact manner
of living; which in this Disease ought to be slender and sparing: wherefore it
is commonly said, Starving is the best Remedy for this Disease: and it appears
by common experience, that by a more spare eating, the coming of the Ague fit,
is very often prolonged, beyond its wonted Custom. There are especially two
things to be observed, concerning Eating and Drinking: The first, that the food
be slender, that nothing Sulphurous or Spirituous be given, for so the
Conflagration of the Blood will be lessened; then secondly, that the Fit
approaching, or urging, nothing of Aliment be taken, wherefore, in fasting the
Fit is lighter, and sooner finished.

As to the third thing proposed; the Inhibition of the Feverish Fit, is
instituted by Remedies, which stay the Fermentation of the Blood. But tho this
Remedy seems Empirical, and unmethodical, and very failable to Physicians, yet
I have found these Fevers to be very often cured by this means, when Medicines
have profited nothing: What they are, and by what means, without the suspicion
of Witchcraft, they afford help, for the curing this Disease, is before noted.
We shall here only advertise you, that the use of these is most profitable
after Physic, and opening a Vein, if there be need of it; and unless these be
rightly performed beforehand, those other rarely stop the Fit. But Vomiting,
Purging, and breathing a Vein, unless they be presently celebrated after the
beginning, yield little help, yea, more often are wont to hinder: For whilst
the Blood is strong in vital spirit, its evil disposition, may with easy
labor be corrected, or amended: wherefore, if the Bile, about the beginning,
be copiously drawn forth, or the Blood eventilated, it is reduced to its
natural Complexion; but afterward, in the progress of this Disease (the Spirit
being now very much exhausted, and the Salt and Sulphur too much exalted) if
these kind of Evacuations be administered, they do more debilitate the
disposition of the Blood: and therefore it is clear by observation, that the
Tertian Fever, is rarely or never cured, by these Remedies late administered,
and often passes into a Quotidian. I my self have known some, in the Spring
time, being strong in very good health, from a more strong Emetick taken for
prevention sake, causing a violence by the Evacuation, to have presently fallen
into a Tertian Fever; and others, for some time cured of this Fever, when
they had taken a strong Purge, for the carrying away of the remains of the
Feverish matter, upon it to have fallen into a Relapse. It may be readily
said, that the mine of the Disease, being before at quiet, was stirred up, and
brought into Act, after this manner by the Medicine: But if you consider this
thing rightly, it may rather be said, that from the strong Medicine, the
disposition of the Blood was very much hurt, and when at first it was prone to
a bilous Dyscrasie, that it hardly did assimilate the alible Juice, from this
evident cause, it forthwith degenerated, that it wholly perverted the Nutriment,
into a Fermentative matter, and so conceived the Feverish disposition. It is a
common opinion, that a Tertian Fever can scarce be cured, without a Vomit,
wherefore some Medicasters, are wont under the pretext of the necessity, to
give to all whatsoever, laboring with this Disease (tho languishing and weak)
an Emetick Medicine not without great danger of life: and those whom they judge
wholly unfit for such a Medicine, they leave as not easily cureable to Nature.
But (as I have often found the contrary by experience) this sort of practice is
evilly instituted; yea, I rather judge, for the cureing of a Tertian Fever,
that Vomits are rarely or never to be required, unless in a strong Body, and
very easily prone to Vomiting, and when the Ventricle happens to be burdened,
with excrementitious matter, but instead of it, that a gentle Purge, by which
the load of the humors may be pleasantly brought away, may be of better use:
because, a Purge in this case, does the same thing as a Vomit, to wit, it
evacuates the choleduct Vessels, that the Bile, being plentifully exhausted
from the Blood, the Feverish Dyscrasie is mended. But when the galish humor,
being emptied forth into the Ventricle, is cast out upwards, from thence there
is great hurt brought to the stomach, and a mighty perturbation excited in the
whole Body: But if that humor be enticed downwards by a gentle Purge, it is
sent forth of doors, without any trouble. Then, if to a gentle Purge, once or
twice repeated, be added a very slender diet, without flesh it often answers
the preservatory Indication, that there needs no other Remedies, for the taking
away the cause of this Disease; but that these being rightly performed, shall
render beneficial those things, which being either inwardly taken, or outwardly
applied, stop the Feverish accession. By this sort of plain and easy
institution of Medicine, viz. A Purge of the infusion of Senna, and Rhubarb, a
slender diet, and a Febrifuge or Ague-resisting Topic, laid either to the
wrists, or the breast, I have known very often, and in a very short time,
Tertian Fevers cured, without the use of any other destroying Physic: yea, a
thin diet only, with Amulets timely administered, has very happily cured
Big-bellied women, and also very weak old men, whose strength could not bear
Purging. I have so often made trial of this method, with good success, that I
doubt not, but that a Tertian Fever, may as easily be cured, as any other
Disease, if it be at the beginning handled after this manner, viz. before the
temper of the Blood be more hurt, by an evil manner of Diet, or by Medicine
untowardly administered. For the truth of this thing, I will relate this
following History.

A certain noble young man, endued with a bilous Temper, had caught an
intermitting Tertian Fever; upon the approach of the Fit, he Vomited forth
much yellow and greenish Choler, then he was troubled most grievously, for many
hours, with a great pain of the Heart, and most strong Heat and Thirst. On the
day of the intermission there was taken from this person, with whom I was by
chance, by my prescription, eight ounces of Blood, and in the afternoon was
given an Emollient Glyster, he also used a most slender Diet, ( viz. only made
of Barley) He took every night going to sleep, this Opiate, viz. Conserve of
Roses vitriolated half a dram, of Diascordium a scruple, also every morning of
the Salt of Wormwood a scruple, in a spoonful of the Juice of Orange: but when
these did not succeed (for the Fit returned somewhat more remiss, but with cruel
Vomiting, as at first) besides, for that this sick person, extremely abhorred a
Vomitory Medicine, (because not long before this, from a very gentle Emetick,
he had Vomited almost thirty times, until being distempered with the Cramp, and
Convulsions, he was brought into great weakness, with hazard of his life)
therefore, the day following the aforesaid Fit, I gave him a Potion of an
infusion of Senna, Rhubarb, and yellow Sanders, with Salt of Wormwood, in
Springwater, by which he was Purged ten times, with ease: In the morning after,
and three hours before he expected the Fit, I put to his wrists an
Ague-resisting Medicine, and took from him six ounces of Blood, by which means,
he mist his Feverish Fit, and then being again Purged after the same manner,
became perfectly well.

If that the Tertian Fever, by reason of the evil Constitution of the sick, or
because of errors in Diet, or committed by Physic, has more deeply rooted it
self, that after a long sickness, the Fits still grow worse, and the sick
extremely languish, with want of Strength, Thirst, and almost continual Heat,
want of Appetite, wakeings, weak Pulse, high colored Urine, and very full of
Contents, the Curatory method ought to be a little otherways instituted; In
this case, first it is to be endeavored, that the Dyscrasie of the Blood, may
be taken away; wherefore, the sick are to be fed, with slender Aliments only,
as Barley broth, or Grewel, with opening Roots boiled in it, (flesh-broth being
wholly laid aside) the Belly is to be kept loose, (if need be) with the use of
Emollient Clysters; besides (Purges being omitted) only digestive Medicines,
which fuse the Blood, and bring away gently the serous Impurities by Urine,
also comforting Remedies, which corroborate the Viscera, and cherish the
Spirits, are chiefly to be insisted on. To this end, Apozems are fitly to be
prepared, of Herbs, and Roots gently Diuretic, also Opiats help very much, of
temperate Conserves, with Sal Nitre, or the fixed Salt of Herbs, with shelly
powders, and the Spirit of Vitriol mixed together. When the disposition of the
Blood is somewhat mended, that the Urine is clearer, and less colored, also
sleep quieter, with a remission of thirst, and heat following; then may be
profitably administered, Remedies to stop the Feverish fit: wherefore
Ague-resisting Amulets may be applied to the Wrists or to the Soles of the
Feet; also the powder of Peruvian Bark, or of something instead of it, or also
of the Barks of the Ash-Tree, Tamarisk, or Gentian, with Salts mixed with them,
and drunk in White Wind: after the comings of the fits are taken away, and the
sick being to get strength, and desire Food, and in some measure to digest it,
gentle Purges may be of use: but let the sick still abstain, from a more
plentiful Diet, or participating of Flesh, and they will shortly after recover
perfect Health, without any violent Purge or Phlebotomy.

CHAP. V. Of the Quotidian Intermitting Fever.
BEcause of its affinity to the Tertian Fever, and likeness of fits, the
Quotidian (or daily) Fever comes next, viz. whose Accession is wont to return
every day. It is the opinion of some, that this sort of Fever, is only a
double Tertian, and does arise from a dispersed matter, having gotten a twofold
Nest; to which I cannot assent, and I suppose its beginning is to be attributed,
to a peculiar Dyscrasie of the Blood. In this the symptoms of cold and heat,
are more remiss, but its fit is longer continued, and oftentimes it is wont to
last eighteen or twenty hours: This Fever for the most part follows a Tertian,
for when the Vital Spirit is very much flown away, by the frequent deflagration
of the Blood, and (the Feverish disposition still remaining) the Blood is made
weaker, it does not concoct the nourishing Juice, or ripen it, but perverts
almost the whole into a Fermentative matter; wherefore it comes sooner to its
increase, and is gathered together to a plenitude of swelling up, within double
the time, than at first. But because the congested matter, participates equally
of crudity, and adustion, therefore the heat of the burning is lesser, and more
unequal, and (like green wood laid on the fire) slowly burns; for which reason
the fit endures longer.

Sometimes it happens, that a Quotidian Fever, does arise without a Tertian
going before, viz. when a Feverish disposition, falls upon a Cacochymic Body,
or full of evil humors, and stuffed with depraved Juices; for then the Blood,
being poor in Spirits, perverts in a greater measure the nutritious Juice, and
in a shorter time, gathers to a fullness of swelling up: But that which begins
an every days Ague, oftentimes changes its figure, and becomes a Tertian; just
as a Tertian, often goes into a Quotidian, because between these Fevers, and
their causes, there is a great vicinity; and the constitution of the Blood
being a little changed, it makes a transition from one to another. A Quotidian
Intermitting Fever, is not so easily cured as a Tertian: For whether it comes
at first simple, or follows upon another Intermitting Fever, it is still
excited from a stronger cause, and argues a greater dyscrasie of the Blood,
which will not presently give way to Remedies. But also, if this Fever be of
long continuance, or comes upon another Chronical Disease, it has most often
adjoined to it, besides the taint of the Blood, the infirmities of the inwards:
to wit, the Blood being spoiled, easily affixeth its impurities, by degrees
heaped up, on the Viscera, whilst it passes through their Meanders: from hence
it is, that in a Quotidian Fever, the weight of the Ventricle, an extension of
the Hypochondria, Obstructions, or Tumors, now of the Liver, now of the Spleen,
or Mesentery, are joined together; but these kind of distempers, are not the
cause of the Fever, (as is commonly believed) but only its product. Wherefore,
in this Fever, besides the simple method of Cure, which is shown in the
Tertian, many other intentions or coindications, come under consideration: to
wit, that the Ventricle be cleansed from its load of humors, the stuffings of
the Inwards freed, Infirmities corroborated; and that together with these, the
Dyscrasie of the Blood may be mended, and the Accessions of the Fever may be
restrained, must by all means be endeavored; from whence, by reason of these
kind of various intentions, we come to the Cure by a longer way: In this case,
Vomits (if strength will bear them) are of benefit before all other Medicines:
also Purges, whereby the assiduous supply of Excrementitious matter, may be
drawn forth, are often to be repeated: Besides these, digestive Remedies,
openers of Obstructions, such as restore the Ferment of the Viscera, and Blood,
and correct their evil dispositions, are frequently to be administered.
Wherefore, the fixed Salts of Herbs, and their Extracts, Acid Spirits of
Minerals, and sometimes preparations of Steel, do very much help: concerning
these main things, the task will be hard, when by reason of the manifold evil,
many things are to be done together, yet by reason of the assiduity of the
Feverish fit, there is leisure for the sick to use few only. In Distempers so
complicated, tho the reason of the method requires, the impediments to be first
removed, and then to Cure the Disease, yet I have known, this kind of Fever,
beset with many other distempers, in a Body full of humors, often Cured,
without method, and by an Empirical way; viz. after a light provision of the
whole, Ague-resisting Remedies being outwardly applied, have at first stopped
the Feverish fit, that then there was time, for the Curing the other
distempers, and more happy occasions of healing were granted. I lately visited
a Noble Lady, who being long endued with a Cachectical habit of Body, a month
after her lying in, being weak and languishing, was taken with a quotidian
Intermitting Fever; after six or seven fits of it, her strength was so much
cast down, that she could scarce rise out of, or sit up in her Bed; nor able to
take never so little Food, tho very slender, but upon it, most grievous
molestations were raised up, in her stomach; besides, the Region of her
Ventricle, and left Hypochondrium, was wholly beset, with a hard shining tumor,
and cruelly painful: by reason of her strength being mightily cast down, there
was no place left for Evacuation, but the use of Clysters; also her Stomach,
being very weak, loathed all other Remedies, unless very grateful, and only in
a very small quantity. In this difficult case, circumscribed between narrow
limits of Curing, I counseled these few things, to wit, that twice in a day,
she should take this mixture, viz. The magisterial water of Earthworms two
Ounces, of Elixer Proprietatis twelve drops. Moreover, I ordered to be applied
to her Ventricle, a Fomentation, of the Leaves of Sea-Wormwood, Centaury,
Southernwood, with the Roots of Gentian, boiled in White Wind, in an open
Vessel: also, that after the Fomentation, a Cake of Tosted-Bread, and dipped in
the same Liquor, should be worn upon her Stomach; besides, Ague-resisting
Medicines were ordered for her wrists; and with these Remedies only, she mist
her Ague fit, on the third day, and remained free from it afterward; then, by
the use of Chalybeat Remedies, she became perfectly well, within a short time.

CHAP. VI. Of a Quartan Fever.
IN a Quartan Fever, the period is longer than in the rest; to wit, which is
extended to the fourth day inclusively; also its continuance uses to be longer,
and its cure harder: because this Disease is protracted for many months, yea,
oftentimes for years, and seldom, or scarce at all, is cured by Medicines.

The Fit, for the most part, begins with cold, and shaking, to which a very
troublesome heat succeeds, but more remiss than in a Tertian: Sweat for the
most part concludes the Fit. At the first coming of the Disease, the Fits are
more grievous, and very infestous, and keep the sick in their Beds; yea, they
make them lose their strength, and vigor of Body: But afterward, the trouble
is more easily born, so that the Fits are suffered out of Bed, and sometimes in
a Journey, or being about any business. If it continue long, it induces the
Scurvy, or Hypochondriac distemper, and involves men in an unhealthful
condition.

The causes which dispose to this Disease, are first, the constitution of the
Soil and Air, because this Distemper is proper to the fall of the Leaf, or
Autumn, that you rarely find this Fever to begin, but about that time: also in
some places, especially about the Seacoasts, this uses to be general, or
common to the Region, and to come upon those living there, or Strangers coming
thither from elsewhere. A declining age, which is past its acme or height, also
a melancholic Temper, and which, by reason of an ill manner of living, is
obnoxious to the Hypochondriac Distemper, cause this: besides, long Fevers of
another kind, and Chronical Diseases, often pass into a Quartan Fever.

According to these positions, and rightly weighed, it may be said, that a
Quartan Fever, even as the other intermitting Fevers, depends upon a vicious
disposition of the Blood; to wit, because the nutritious Juice, being by
degrees delated into the Vessels, is perverted into a Fermentative matter; and
the effervescency of this, heaped up even to a fullness of swelling over,
constitutes the Fit of the Quartan Fever. But as in this Fever, there are
some things, which are peculiar from the rest, we will inquire, what kind of
Dyscrasie of the Blood it is in this Disease, distinct from the others, and by
what means it excites, the very remarkable Symptoms.

The opinion, which is commonly had concerning this thing, is very far from
truth: almost by the consent of all, the Essence and beginning of a Quartan
Fever, is ascribed to a melancholic humor, heaped up somwhere in the first
passages, and there periodically Putrefying. Instead of this, we affirm, that
in this Disease, the Liquor of the Blood, does pass from a sweet, spirituous,
and balsamic, into an acid, and somewhat austere Nature, like Wine growing
sour: to wit, there is too great a want of Spirits, and the Terrestrial, or
Tartareous part of the Blood, (which consists chiefly of Salt, and Earth) is
too much exalted, and being carried forth into a Flux, induces the sourness of
the mass of Blood. Even as Beer, being disturbed by Thunder, and infected with
a troubled lee or dregs, grows sour. The Blood, after this manner degenerated,
from its native disposition, does not rightly dress the alible Juice, and
assimilate it to it self, but perverts it into an extraneous matter; with
which, when it is satisfied to a fullness, in the vessels, and the nervous parts
are watered by the Juice, from thence arising, a Flux of this matter, and as it
were a spontaneous effervency follows, by which indeed, the Feverish Fit is
induced, with shivering and heat, as is wont to be in a Tertian.

In a Quartan Fever, the periods have longer intervals, because, when the
Dyscrasie of the Blood is become sourish, and therefore less violent and hot,
it perverts the alible Juice without strife, or tumult: wherefore, it
assimilates some of it, and the depravation of the rest, does not so far recede
from its natural state, as in a Tertian, and from hence, its congestion to a
plenitude, is made longer, and almost in another half of that time, in which a
Tertian rises up to a Turgescency: And therefore, those taken with this Fever,
are indifferently well, and are strong; which is a sign, that the nutritious
Juice is less depraved; also, the Fits are made without cruel burning, because
the nutritious humor, is perverted into a fermentative matter, without great
adustion.

But why this Disease is so hard to be cured, and so pertinaciously infests the
sick, the cause is, the melancholic constitution of the Blood, which is not
easily to be taken away, and yields almost to no Remedies. The choleric
disposition of the Blood, is mended by the frequent Deflagration, and ceases
often of its own accord, even as too rich Wines are depressed, by their own
growing hot, and are wont to be reduced into their due state: but this
melancholic Dyscrasie of the Blood, in which, with a want and defect of
Spirits, Salt and Earth are too much exalted, (as when Wines grow sour) is most
hard to be restored, and is almost of the same labor and difficulty, as to put
again life, and a vinous Spirit, into Vinegar: For that the Blood, depraved
after this manner, may be restored, it will be needful, that its whole mass
should be volatilised, and as it were made Spiritual anew: wherefore, in this
case, evacuations profit not a jot, yea, by more depauperating the Blood,
oftentimes the strength is cast down, beyond help: but they had need to exalt,
and make volatile what is fixed, and to promote a Transpiration, or
Spiritualisation, in the whole mass of Blood: From hence it is, that in this
Disease, the change of the Air and Region, most often brings help, before all
other Remedies: For the Spring following, oftentimes takes away those Quartan
Fevers, that had arisen the Autumn before: which without doubt happens,
because the changed condition of the Air, is wont to alter for the better, the
evil disposition of the Blood: also for the same reason, the change of the
place, most often cures this Distemper, inexpugnable to all Physic.

If it be demanded, wherefore this Disease chiefly begins in the Autumn; and
rarely in the Spring, or Summer time; I say, the Autumnal time does most fitly
produce this kind of Feverish disposition of the Blood, for when very much of
the Spirit, and Sulphur, has flown away by the Summers heat, and that what is
left begins to be bound up by the cold; the Liquor of the Blood, (as Wine
growing sour by too much heat) easily degenerates into a saltish, and acidulous
or sharp Nature: This also, the Sea air, by infecting the Blood and Spirits,
with saline Vapors falling on them, easily procures: yea, also the affinity of
this Disease, with the Scurvy, and Hypochondriac distemper, plainly shows, the
evil disposition of the Blood to be in fault, whereby it becomes salt, and
earthy, with the want of Spirit.

Concerning Quartan Fevers, the last year was so abundantly fruitful of
observations, that many might collect by ocular Inspection, whatever belong to
this Disease; for when the most hot Summer was past, about the end of it, an
Epidemical Fever (of which in another place you shall have a description)
followed; then the Autumn coming on, when that Disease had ceased, a Quartan
Fever began very much to rage; that in very many places, the fourth part of
the people was taken with it: neither did it only infest old men, splenitick
and melancholic men, but of every age and temper, also Infants, Children, and
young men ordinarily: which was clearly a sign, that this Distemper had drawn
its rise, not from a melancholic humor, heaped up, by the default of the
Spleen, but from the Dyscrasie of the Blood, brought in, through the
intemperance of the year: for the mass of the Blood, after too great heats,
even as Wines after immoderate effervescencies, was made fit to grow somewhat
sour, or to get an austere disposition, and so also prone to this sort of
Fever, as is already showed.

If the Remedies, which for the Curing of this, have been made trial of, both
by Physicians and Empericks, were collected together, their description would
swell into a great Volumn; but although there is instituted, a manifold provision
of Medicine, against this evil, yet very few are cured in the Autumn. In some,
about the beginning of their sickness, before the Disease has taken too deep
root, a Vomit has brought help; but in most, all manner of Cathartics, tho an
hundred times repeated, have profited nothing. In whom the evil had deeply
implanted it self, the sick received no help, from the most studied Medicines
made use of all the Autumn. But when at this time, I perceived the ordinary
method of Medicine, was administered in vain, I proposed to a Noble Virgin,
requiring a sudden Cure, by any means, to be performed, that if she would
endure a Flux at the Mouth, for some days, from a Mineral Medicine, by that
means, it might be hoped, that the Disease would be profligated. When she had
readily assented to this, I gave her a gentle, and very safe Medicine, by which
a light spitting only was provoked, and that finished within twelve days: As
soon as the Salivation began, she mist her fits, but at those times they were
wont to come, she felt a perturbation in her whole Body, with an oppression of
the Heart, and dread of swooning, but after the spitting was finished, she
appeared very well; and when again after two months space, she was troubled
with some light fits of this Disease, from an Emetick powder, twice or thrice
taken, she was wholly cured without relapsing.

After the winter Solstice, this Disease began to rage less, and to cease in
some of its own accord, and in many others, to be easily expunged by the use of
Physic: because at this time, the Dyscrasie of the Blood, contracted by the
Summers heat, is wont to be blotted out leisurely, by reason of the cold of the
Winter, and the mass of Blood growing old, as it were to put off its old
spoils, and to be reduced toward its natural State. But those, who were of a
melancholic temper, or had their viscera, and especially the Spleen, evilly
affected, or that used an ill manner of Diet, received no change at this
Tropic, but to the next period of the year, viz. to the vernal Equinox, or the
Spring, kept the Disease; and then in most, the Blood being either restored of
it self, or its intemperance more easily mended by the use of Remedies, this
Distemper was seen to be overcome: But in the mean time, many old men, and such
as were full of evil humors, or otherways unhealthy, ordinarily dyed, in all
that space of time, of this Disease; also some lived, who could not shake off
its yoke, tho the Summer Solstice were past. But although very many had labored
with this Fever, as it were Epidemical, almost through the whole year, yet none
(that I know) contracted it first in the Spring, and very few grew well of it
during the Autumn, that in truth, I do not doubt, the Dyscrasie of the Blood,
to be the cause of this, and the cure to consist in the change of it.

The Remedies, which most often brought help, (as appeared at least to our
observation) were of this sort, which did restrain the Feverish Fit: for the
evils of the disposition of the Blood, being somewhat mended, by the time of the
year, being changed, if now the habitual custom of the Fits were broken off,
Nature recollected her self, and easily recovered the pristine state of health,
by her own endeavor. And this kind of intention, (to wit, the inhibition of
the Fits) tho sometimes performed by Vomits, given a little before the coming of
the Fit, (for these did not rarely stop the Feverish motion of the Blood, by
raising up another motion contrary to this) yet this Indication is far more
certainly, and indeed happily effected, by the use of those kind of Medicines,
which do not altogether evacuate from the Viscera, but induce, either a certain
fixation to the Blood, or a precipitation of the Feverish matter, for a time.
Wherefore, those whom I undertook to cure, in the Spring, and afterward; I
handled (and in most with good success) with this method; a provision being
made of the whole, sometimes with an Emetic Medicine, sometimes with a Solutive;
I was wont three hours before the Fit, to lay a peculiar Ague-Medicine to the
wrists, and together, to give them to drink in Sack, an Ague-resisting powder,
and to order the sick to be kept in Bed in a gentle sweat: It seldom happened,
but at the first, or second time, the Feverish Fit, was by this means
restrained, and then, by the same Remedy, sometimes reiterated, the Disease at
last wholly ceased. To this kind of practice, (besides our experience) the use
of the powder, of a certain Bark, brought of late from the Indies, seems to
give some Faith, and approbation; which is said, most certainly to cure this
Disease; but the virtue, or operation of this, without any evacuation, consists
in this only, that it hinders the coming of the Feverish Fits.

Concerning this Peruvian Bark, because of late it has begun to be in use,
there are some things to be said, which offer themselves to common observation.
The common manner of exhibiting this is, that two drams of it beaten to powder,
be infused in Sack, or Whitewine, in an open Glass, for two hours, and then
upon the coming of the Fit, the Patient being put to Bed, that the liquor and
powder be drunk up. This potion often takes away the approaching Fit, yet
oftentimes tho taken after the wonted manner, it prevents the next, however,
either in the first, second, or third period, the Fit is inhibited, and the
Disease seems to be cured, it is often wont to return, within twenty or thirty
days; then this powder being again exhibited, the Disease is for a time
deferred about the same space, and by this means, I have known many sick of a
Quartan, to have suffered some few Fits only, a whole Autumn, and Winter, and
so to have detained the enemy in his precincts, till the Spring coming on, the
disposition of the Blood is altered, for the better, by the help of the time of
year, and of other Physic, and so this distemper vanishes by degrees. Those
who by this means, have procured these frequent truces of the Quartan, have
lived cheerful, lively, and ready for any business, when otherwise, being weak,
and pale, they were brought into languishment, and a vicious habit of Body:
scarce one of an hundred, has tried this Medicine in vain, yea, if but half,
or a lesser quantity, viz. the weight of but one dram, taken, it very often
takes away the Fits, and suspends the same, a shorter space only; neither is it
any matter, whether it be taken in strong, or small Wine, unless with the
respect, to the disposition of the sick: because in a more hot temper, it may
be profitably taken in distilled Water, or Whey; also, a clear infusion of it,
the more thick substance being cast away, produces the like effect, but of
shorter durance: I have taken care to reduce this powder into Pills, with the
mucilage of Tragacanth, with a little cost to the sick, to be given to some;
after what manner soever it is taken, unless, to those loathing and abhorring
every Medicine, it causes no manifest evacuation, and takes away the Fit,
almost from all; neither is it only in a Quartan Fever, but in the other kinds
of intermitting Fevers, to wit, in every one where there is any remission
coming between, given with good success. It is commonly ordered, that a gentle
Purge should be taken before this, but in some who are very weak, and keep
their Beds, this powder being taken carefully, without any previous Medicine,
has procured laudable effects. In the mean time, I will ingeniously confess,
that I have not seen an intermitting Fever quite cured, by this Bark, once
taken: nay, rather the Fits not only of a Quartan, but of a Tertian, and
Quotidian Fever, wholly overcome easily by other Remedies, seeming to be
driven away by this powder, have constantly returned after a short time. For
this Reason, they who suppress intermitting Fevers, otherways easily curable,
no necessity urging them, by this Medicine, for a little while, only seem to
institute a deceitful Medicine, and do no more than those, who skin over a
rotten Ulcer, which will shortly break out again; in truth, in some cases, the
use of this will be requisite, viz. when by the too great assiduity of the
Fits, the spirits of the sick are cast down, truces are by this means procured,
by which Nature may recollect her self, and afterward may be more able to
fight against this potent Enemy: also, that a Quartan Fever, during the Autumn
and Winter, may pass over with little trouble, this Bark is profitably
administered: But those, who expect a longer resting time, from the assaults of
this Fever, are bid to take this powder in greater quantity, and more often,
to wit, that they should take two drams, three several times one after another,
whether the Fits return or no; by this means, they remain longer free, yet they
retain within, the Enemy still, tho asleep.

If it be demanded, concerning the Nature of this Bark, and the virtue in
suppressing the fits of Intermitting Fevers, it is not to be dissembled, that
it is very difficult to explicate the causes of these kind of effects, and the
manner of working; because, there is not found as yet in any Subject, besides,
the like efficacy; but from a singular experiment, a general Reason is not to
be rightly fitted: however, from the appearances diligently Collated, we will
deduce some Theses in order, which may make at least some steps toward, if not
obtain the verity of this thing.

It is to be noted therefore, in the first place, that this Medicine, being
inwardly taken, especially exercises its force and energy on the mass of
Blood; because, it does not at all irritate the Viscera, neither causes in them
any excretion, or trouble; besides, whilst it communicates its virtue to the
Blood, it does not at all put forth Antifeaverish property; wherefore, not
always the next following fit, but the second, or the third, is prevented, by
the same being taken: and for this reason, that it may sooner affect the Blood,
it is a usual thing, to drink the Liquor, very much impregnated with the same
powder, for so its Particles are more easily conveyed into the mass of Blood.
Secondly, the virtue of this Bark, being impressed on the Blood, stays in it
for some time, and that either shorter or longer, according as either a greater
or lesser portion of the Medicine was taken inwardly; for the Particles of
this, being confused with the Blood, are a long while circulated with it, and
by how much the longer they stay, by so much the more they affect its mass, and
produce a longer effect: for though Aliments, and some other things taken in,
for that they are presently overcome by the native heat, put off whatever they
have of virtue, within some few hours, this being then assimilated or sent
forth adoors, they cease to operate: yet some Medicines being taken inwardly,
because they are not easily tamed, nor cast forth of doors presently, by an
irritation stirred up, they remain for many days very active, and hold a long
time the Juices, and the Blood, in this or that manner of Fermentation, this
may be observed of some Medicines, also of Poisons, and Counterpoysons, the
once or twice taking of which, for some days, is wont to affect our Bodies for
a longer time; for it is an usual thing with Cathartic Medicines, when they work
little by Vomit, or Stool, to break forth after many weeks outwardly, in
Pustles and Wealks: yea, if Death be avoided, from the drinking of Poison,
every body knows, that the virulency will lie hid, a long time in the Blood and
Juices. In like manner also, this powder, and perhaps very many other things
inwardly taken, although they seem asleep, yet continue to act, on the Spirits and
Humors.

Thirdly, although this Medicine acts immediately on the Blood and Humors, yet it
takes not wholly away, the Feverish Dyscrasie, implanted in them: for, as soon
as its force is consumed, and all its Particles are flown away, from the
mixture of the Blood, the Distemper being only suppressed for a time, at length
rises up, and repeats its fits after its wonted manner, but forasmuch as
Nature, by the space of this cessation, becomes stronger, therefore, after the
Relaps, the fits (not as before) but on the third or fourth day, according to
the first figure of the Disease, are wont to return.

Fourthly, It is remarked, that this Remedy, does not stop the Feverish
accessions, as the ordinary Ague-resisters or Febrifuges, by fixing, or also by
fusing the Blood; for then the next fit always, and not the second, or third
following after, is prevented.

According to which positions, that we may instead of a Corollary, subjoin some
things concerning the manner it self of working, whereby this Medicine seems to
act; we say, it is most likely, that when the Particles, proceeding from the
same being taken, are thoroughly mixed with the Blood, they compel it into a
certain new Fermentation, by which, whilst the Particles of the Blood are
continually agitated, they are wholly hindered, that they cannot heap up any
Excrementitious matter, or enter into Feverish turgescencies; for, as after
the biting of a mad dog, or stinging of any venomous Creatures, the Blood it
self, and nervous Juice, are a long while impoysoned, yet lest they should
conceive presently great irregularities, Counter-poysons being taken, do hinder
their Liquors, by retaining them in another Fermentation; the use of which, if
so long continued, whilst the virulent little Bodies are quite flown away, no
horrid symptom is to be feared, from that evil being contracted; but if the
strength of the Remedy, being too sparingly given, be first consumed, forthwith
the Venom repullulates, and the old Poison, thought to have been exploded, is
at length brought into act: by the same way, when the Blood, having gotten a
vicious disposition, perverts the Alible Juice, and whereby it might more
rightly expel it, heaped together to a fullness, conceives Feverish swellings
up; this Peruvian Bark being beaten, and administered, by the Commerce of its
Particles, so agitates the Blood, tho distempered with an evil disposition,
with a new excited Fermentation, and alters it, that it in some measure
concocts the nourishable Juice, and continually evaporates its Recrements, that
they are not heaped together as before, into the matter of a fit: But, when the
Particles of this Remedy, are wholly flown away, from the company of the Blood,
and the whole virtue consumed, the evil disposition of the Blood, before
contrancted, at length rises up, and so the Feverish fits return, after their
wonted manner. Sometimes perhaps it happens, that whilst the Feverish fits are
suppressed, by the use of this powder, by reason of the season of the year
being changed, or by the help of another Remedy, or by the endeavor of Nature
it self, that Dyscrasie of the Blood may be mended, by degrees, and so the
Fever may at length vanish, of its own accord. This I have known to happen,
but very rarely, because almost with the same certainty, by which you expect
the Feverish fits to be suppressed, by that powder, you may afterward look
for their return.

As to what appertains to the sensible qualities, with which this Bark is
noted, it appears to abound with bitterness, and a certain stipticity, that it
seems to the taste, to have the likeness of Savor, which is in most
Conterpoysons, as the Root of Gentian, Serpentary, Contrayerva, etc. for what
are bitter in act, are strong in excellent virtue, for the suppressing the
force of preternatural Ferments; yea, the Root of Gentian, which is likest to
this Bark, was in times past of famous use, for the Curing of Quartan Fevers.
But now, although this Peruvian powder, be the only Alexiterion or Counter-poyson,
as yet found out against a Quartan Fever, to wit, that inhibits (tho only for
a time) its fits, and of other Intermitting Fevers, yet it is not to be
doubted; but that there are in the world, other Medicines extant, which are as
good Ague-resisters; and it is hoped, that led by the example of this new
invention, we may be excited, to the finding out the virtues of Herbs, almost
as yet unknown: so, whilst we shall insist on the trial of several, and the
Empirical be joined to the Rational Medicine, without doubt the Cures of the
Quartan Ague, and of other invincible Diseases, may more happily be
accomplished: which therefore I promise more willingly to this Age, or at least
to the next, when being led by the Analogy of this Book, I have found out a
Medicine, for the profligating of Fevers, of use not contemptible, it not
being long since variously tried, which also I am wont to give to the poorer
sort, instead of something else, with good success.

CHAP. VII. Of continual Fevers.
A Continual Fever is that, whose fit is continued for many days, without
intermission: It has its times of remission, and of more fierceness, but never
of intermission; the burning is now more remiss, now more intense, but still
the sick are in a Fever, until by the temperament, or insensible growing well,
the Disease is wholly Cured. Concerning this, it behooves us to inquire, what
Effervescency of the Blood it is, which causes a continual Fever; then, by
what ways, and from what causes, it is wont to be excited: also, how it differs
from that, which is in Intermitting Fevers. And these being performed, we will
descend to the Species of Continual Fevers.

There are many ways, by which the Blood growing hot, induces a continual
Feavear, the chief of which may be reduced to these Heads: The first way is,
when the more spirituous, and subtle Portion of the Blood, becomes too hot, and
is distempered, with a certain burning, which therefore agitates the other
parts of the Blood, and incites it into a certain rage, so that the Sulphur, or
the Oily part of the Blood; is more dissolved, and more inkindled in the Heart,
also, for that cause, there is among all the Particles of the Blood, a certain
syncrisis, contrariety, or perturbation, by which in truth, being confused, and
put out of order, they are not able quickly to be extricated, and reduced into
their former posture, wherefore, a heat and burning more than is wont to be, is
stirred up in the whole Body: but when the Spirits are only in fault, their
heat and disorder, are wont within a short space, to be allaied of their own
accord, therefore, this Fever is often terminated within a day, and is rarely
continued beyond three: and therefore, is called an Ephemera, or a Fever of a
day, or Synochus of more dayr,

2. The second manner, or degree of growing hot, is when the Sulphurous or
Oily part of the Blood, being too much heated, conceives a Fervor: for then, it
both grows immoderately hot in the Vessels, and being very much inkindled in
the Heart, produces by its deflagration, a very strong heat in the whole Body.
Indeed the Blood, as to its temper, mostly depends on the condition of the
Sulphur; when by reason of crudity, the Sulphur is less dissolved, the Blood is
made watery and cold, and is moved slowly in the Vessels: but if the
Sulphurous, or Oily part of the Blood, grows hot, beyond its Natural
disposition, presently it becomes fierce, and improportionate with the rest, so
that, almost the whole being acted, as it were into a flame, by the Ferment of
the Heart, compels the mass of Blood to grow immoderately hot, and to boil up.
For as when Wines, endued with a rich Lee, are stirred up into an heat, by the
too rancid Sulphur; or as Hay, laid up too wet, by reason of the want of
Ventilation, conceives of its own accord a burning, the Particles of the
Sulphur being loosned from the mixture; in like manner, when the Blood is not
rightly ventilated, but being restrained from Evacuation, by reason of the
admixtion of some hot thing, or a more plentiful sanguification, or for some
other cause, the Particles of the Sulphur begin to be thickly gathered
together; presently, all its Liquor, immoderately boils up, by the Sulphurs
being loosned, and inflamed in the Heart, and this kind of Fever is induced,
which is called a putrid Synochus; notwithstanding which appellation, tho of
many rejected, for that the Blood so long as it is in motion, does not
putrify; yet forasmuch, as in this Fever, the mixture of the Blood, is
somewhat loosned, by the Sulphur being too much exalted, and the mass of its
Liquor being changed, from its Natural disposition, tends toward putrefaction,
therefore, the term of a putrid Fever, as has been anciently used, may be
still, with good reason, retained.

3. The third degree of growing hot, (and which constitutes a distinct kind of
continual Fever) is excited, from a certain malignant, and invenomed Ferment,
by which, when the mass of the Blood is imbued, and the Spirits, and the
Sulphurous part together, conceive an heat, and their burning is not sooner
appeased, than that either that malignant matter be consumed, and cast forth of
doors, or else a certain coagulation, and as it were putrefaction, of the
Blood, from its corruptive venom is induced, by which, both circulation is
hindered, and the Vital Spirit extinguished. This malignity is wont to arise,
either from a certain contagion received from without, or from some infection
begotten within us; according to these ways the malignant Fever, Smallpox,
Measels, and also the Plague, draw their beginnings, and by their contagion,
far and near set upon many.

There are therefore three degrees, or manners of growing hot, by which, the
kinds of continual Fevers are determined. From the subtle portion of the Blood
made hot, or the Ebullition of the Spirits, the Ephemera arises, as also the
Synochus of one or more days: by the Sulphurous, or Oily part of the Blood,
being too hot and inkindled, the putrid Fever is stirred up, then thirdly,
upon an invenomed taint, infecting the Blood, and congealing its Liquor,
malignant Fevers depend. In every one of these, by the depravation, or rather
corruption of the Alible Juice, fresh carried into the Blood, the various fits,
inequalities, and critical motions arise. But before I enter upon the several
kinds of a continued Fever, it is requisite for me, to consider, how the
growing hot of the Blood, in a continual Fever, differs from that other, which
constitutes Intermitting Fevers.

I say therefore, that the growing hot of the Blood, in an Intermitting Fever,
depends only, upon the commixtion of a certain Fermentative matter, and not
rightly miscible, with the Blood, and on its growing up, to a fullness of
boiling over. Because of this heat, with the Blood in the Vessels, and of the
deflagration in the Heart, the fit is induced; because of its growing cool, the
intermission follows, that in the coming between of the fits, neither the
Spirits, nor Sulphur, become outrageous, but the bond of the mixture being kept
whole, the Liquor is circulated in the Vessels, equally, and without trouble:
on the contrary, in a continual Fever, the disorders of the Spirits, and of
Sulphur, of either, or both together, by their proper Ebullition, also without
the mixture of any other, stir up the Ebullition of the Blood; wherefore, there
are required, for an intermission, besides the difflation or cooling of the
Excrementitious matter, a deflagration of the inkindled Blood, and a reduction
of it to its due Temper.

The Constitution of the Blood in a continual Fever, is of the same sort as of
Wines, when they grow hot upon too rich a Lee; to wit, are mighty in Spirit,
and grow turgid with exalted Sulphur, and therefore they conceive a Fervor, and
greatly boil up, of their own accord, without the mixture of any other thing.
In an Intermitting Fever, the Blood is moved after that manner, as Wines, when
they conceive an heat, because of something poured to them, that is not miscible
with them: Moreover, in this Fever, the disposition of the Blood is of that
sort, as of Wines, when in their decay and declination, they become ropy,
unsavory, or acid, to wit, in which the Spirit is depressed, that in the mean
time, either Salt, or Sulphur, or both together, appear above the rest, and
infect the whole Liquor with their disorder. An Intermitting Fever, for the
most part, is free from danger, because the constitutive parts of the Blood,
although they should somewhat change their disposition, however, keep the bond of
mixture, and whilst they are in power, are circulated equally in the Vessels,
yea they pervert the nutritious Juice, into a matter, not altogether besides
Nature, but rather infesting, with its fullness and turgescency. In a continual
Fever, besides the intemperance, the mixture of the Blood, and constitution of
the Liquor, are somewhat loosned, and its corruption easily follows; wherefore
this Disease often ends in death: further, the nourishing Juice is depraved,
into a matter wholly vicious, and altogether infestous to Nature.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Ephemera or Fever for a Day.
I Have said, the least degree of heat, which induces a continual Fever, is
placed in the subtle, and Spirituous part of the Blood, being too much agitated
and heated; for this, like the Spirit of Wine, boils up on every light
occasion, and conceives a fervor, by a too great motion of the Body, or
perturbation of mind, by the ambient heat as of the Sun or vapors, by hot
things taken inwardly, as the drinking of Wine, and the eating of peppered
meats, and being irritated by such like. For the Spirits of the Blood, easily
take fire, and being impetuously moved, are not presently appeased, but they
move thoroughly other Particles of the Blood, variously confound, and snatch
them, into a rapid and disorderly motion; also from this motion of the Spirits,
the Sulphur, or Oily part of the Blood, is more boiled forth, somewhat more
dissolved, and something more fully inkindled in the Heart, by which means, an
intense heat is raised up, in the whole Body. But forasmuch, as Sulphur is
inkindled, and inflamed only by small parts, and not in the whole, that fervor
of the Spirits is quickly appeased, and ceases: wherefore, the Fever which is
excited by this means, for the most part is terminated, within twenty four
hours, and therefore is called an Ephemera, or a Fever of a day. If that by
reason of a greater heat of the Spirituous Blood, it is prolonged further, it
rarely exceeds three days, and is called an Ephemera of more days, or a
Synochus not putrid: but if it should happen to be lengthned beyond this time,
this Fever easily passes into a putrid, viz. from the daily Ebullition of the
Spirituous Blood, the more thick Particles of the Sulphur, at length begin to
take fire, and involve the whole mass of Blood, in its Effervescency: even as
the Spirit of Turpentine, being shut up in a Cucurbit, and being put into a
Sand Furnace, if it be forced with a moderate heat, boils up gently, as the
Blood in a Fever of a day; but if the heat be made more strong; the Liquor
grows impetuously hot, till it breaks forth into a flame, to which the
inflammation of the Blood, in a putrid Fever, may be very aptly compared.

The Days Fever, and Synochus simple, rarely begin without an evident cause:
Besides what has been but now said, immoderate Labor, Watchings, a sudden
passion of the mind, a constriction of the pores, a Surfeit, also a Bubo or
inflamed Sore, a Wound, the coming down of the Milk in Childbearing Women, are
wont to induce them: The procatartic Causes, which dispose to this, are an hot
temper of Body, an active habit, a sedentary life, and difuse of exercise.

The chief beginnings of this Disease, depend upon the presence of the evident
cause: for either, little Bodies of extraneous heat, being confused with the
Blood, like water boiling over the fire, make it to boil up; or this Fever is
induced, by motion, or by reason of transpiration being stopped; even as Wines
made hot by motion, or when too closely stopped in the Ton, are put into a
Fervor: but what way soever an inflammation is first excited, presently the
Spirits become enraged, and being moved hither and thither, compel the Blood to
boil up, and to be enlarged into a greater space, with a spumous rarefaction:
wherefore, the Vessels are distended, and the membranous parts hauled, hence
follow pain, chiefly in the Head and Loins, a spontaneous weariness, and as it
were an inflation of the whole Body. If that, with the Spirit of the Blood, a
certain Sulphurous part, be also in some measure inkindled, a sharp heat is
diffused through the whole, the Pulse is vehement and quick, the Urine red,
also thirst, watchings, and many other symptoms infest, the reasons of which
are added hereafter.

Concerning the Solution, or Crisis of the Ephemeran Fever, and of the not
putrid Synochus, three things are chiefly requisite: viz. a removing of the
evident cause, secondly a separation, and a scattering of the depraved, or
excrementitious matter, from the mass of Blood: Thirdly, a quieting of the
parts of the Blood, and a restitution of them, to their natural and equal
motion and site. According as these succeed, now more suddenly, now more
slowly, and difficully, this Disease is finished in a shorter, or longer time.

1. The evident cause, which for the most part is extrinsick, is easily
removed, and the sick are wont, presently to avoid the presence, or assiduity
of that thing, and do perceive a sense of any thing that is hurtful; none
taking a Fever from Wine, will still indulge the drinking of it, as soon as
any one grows more than usually hot, in a Bath, or the heat of the Sun, it is a
trouble to them to stay longer.

2. As to the Excrementitious matter, which ought to be scattered, and
separated from the Blood: this is either brought from without, as when the
Blood is infected by surfeit, drinking of Wine, sitting in the Sun, or from a
too hot Bath, with Effluvia, or little dry, and Fermentative Bodies; or this
matter is begotten within, as when its Liquor is stuffed with recrements, or
adust Particles, from the deflagration of the Blood. Either of these matters,
ought to be separated from the Blood, to be dispersed, and either by sweat, or
insensible breathing forth, to be thrust out of doors, before the Fever be
appeased; wherefore, when as the pores are bound up, and transpiration hindered,
the Ephemeran Fever is longer protracted, and sometimes passes, from a simple
Synochus, into a putrid.

3. The evident cause being removed, and this degenerate matter dispersed,
there is required for the remission, a quieting, and reducing into order, the
parts of the Blood; for diverse Particles of the Blood, being after this manner
confused; and by reason of the Feverish heat, carried up and down, they do not
presently get again the former order of situation and position; but it is
needful, that they be by degrees extricated, and by little and little restored,
to a just mixture.

Although this Disease, after the removing of the evident cause, for the most
part ceases of its own accord, within a while, yet some Medicinal Remedies may
be administered, with good success, especially, when there is danger, lest the
Ephemeran Fever, should pass into a putrid, The chief intentions should be, to
suppress the fervor of the Blood, and to procure a more free transpiration; to
the which conduce, first a breathing of a Vein, a slender diet, or rather
abstinency, cooling drinks, and a bringing away the filth of the Belly, by
Clysters: Sleep, and Rest, greatly help, above all the rest; which, if wanting
should be procured in time, by Opiats, and Anodynes.

Verily, although the Histories, and Observations of those, distempered with an
Ephemeran Fever, contain in themselves nothing very rare; yet I shall subjoin
an example or two, in this place, whereby the delineation or type of this
Disease, may be illustrated.

A certain young Gentleman, about twenty years of Age, endued with a strong
habit of Body, by the immoderate drinking of strong Wine, fell into a Feverish
distemper, with thirst, heat, and with a great burning of his Precordia; being
let Blood, he drank a great quantity of fair water, and upon it presently a
plentiful sweat following, he grew shortly well: In this case, the more thin
portion of the Blood, being heated by the Spirits of the Wine, fell into a
rage, caused the whole mass of Blood to be shaken, and its frame to be loosned,
more than it was wont; and for that reason, that happened to be more dissolved, by
the Ferment of the Heart, and to be as it were inkindled by the active
Particles, loosned from the mixture; until the Vessels being emptied by
Phlebotomy, the raging Blood was cooled, and by the drinking of the water, its
fervor was attempered; then the hot Effluvia, being involved, together with the
adust matter, with a copious Serum, and sent away by Sweat, the Blood at length
recovered its due temper. Moreover, an ingenious young man, of a sedentary
life, and also very much addicted to the Study of Learning, when he had for
sometime exercised himself, beyond his strength, in the hot Sunshine, he began
to complain of the pain of his head, a want of Appetite, a heat of his
Precordia, and of a Feverish distemper all over; to whom, (for that he was
wholly averse to Physic) I ordered an abstinence from all things whatsoever,
unless from Small-Beer, and Grewel; on the second day, and so more on the
third, the symptoms remitted, by little and little, on the fourth, he went home
freed from the Fever, without any Medicine.

CHAP. IX. Of a Putrid Fever.
SO much for a Continual Fever, which is raised from the most simple heating
of the Blood, or its lowest degree of inordinate heat; that which depends on a
greater degree of heat follows, viz. when the Oily or Sulphurous part of the
Blood, being too much heated, swells up above measure, and as it were forced
into a flame; and therefore from the similitude, by which humid things
putrefying, conceive an heat, this kind of Ebullition of the Blood, because it
induces an immoderate heat, is called a putrid Fever: which name ought to be
retained without injury, because that in this Fever, the Synthesis of the
Blood, (as is wont to happen in putrefying Liquors) is very much unlocked. When
the Spirits only grow enraged, (as in an Ephemera) the frame of the Blood is
somewhat set open, and loosened, that it is more dissolved, by the Ferment of
the Heart, than is wont, and more Particles than naturally use to do, leap
forth, and diffuse a more intense heat; but yet the mixture of the Liquor, as
to its chief parts, is conserved. But when the Sulphurous matter taking fire,
grows hot above measure, the bond of the mixture, for the greatest part, is
loosed, that its Principles are almost wholly drawn away, by the Ferment of the
Heart, and the active Particles, being loosned from the mixture, break forth as
it were into a flame. Wherefore, the Liquor of the Blood being after this
manner rarefied, in the Heart, and as it were inkindled, is from thence
carried, through the Vessels, with a most rapid motion, and disperses very many
Effluvia of heat, from its deflagration. Hence, the whole mass of Blood, (like
water put over the fire) continually boiling, distends the Vessels, pulls the
Brain and Nervous parts, raises up Convulsions, and pains in them, very much
destroys the Vital Spirits with its heat, wastes the Ferments of the Bowels,
hinders the Offices of concoction, and dispensation, often depraves the
nourishing Juice, destinated for the Nervous stock, that from thence exceeding
great disorders of the Animal Spirits follow; yea almost perverts the whole
economy of Nature.

The course of this Disease shows it self after this manner; It rarely begins
without a procatartic cause, or previous disposition: to wit, the Sulphurous
or oily part of the Blood, is first too much carried forth, and exalted beyond
its due tenor, which afterward, either of its own accord, (like Hay not
eventilated) begins to grow hot, or by the coming of an evident cause, it is
forced into a preternatural heat. But when it grows turgid in the first place,
by reason of the admixtion of a crude Juice with the Blood, now a shivering,
now heat infests, which show themselves unequally, like fire, which is covered
with green wood, sends forth now smoke, now flame: But at length, the fire
glowing more largely, as here the victor fire spreads it self abroad, so there
(sooner than said) the whole mass of Blood is inflamed, and is urged at once
with heat, and a most swift motion: Nor is this immoderate heat of the Blood
appeased, before its active particles being loosned from the mixture, and then
successively inkindled in the Heart, are wholly burned out, which does not
happen, but in the space of many days. And then at length this Fever ceases,
when the remaining Liquor of the Blood, the Spirit and Sulphur being very much
consumed, being made lifeless and poor, is fit only for a weak and small
fermentation. From this kind of deflagration of the Blood, and also of the
alible Juice, (by the same fire burnt out) the recrements, or little Bodies of
torrified matter, are heaped up in the Blood; which yet do more promote its
fervor, and ebullition, and for a time, increase the Feverish distemper. After
the Blood has very much burned forth, and these kind of little Bodies, are
gathered together to a fullness of swelling up, the vital Spirit endeavors a
separation, and tries to concoct, and to overcome, (what it may) these adust
recrements, and then, having put a great many of them into a swelling up, a
Flux being risen, strives to shut them wholly out. And indeed, in the
subaction, and seclusion of this matter, chiefly consists the event of this
Disease; for if the vital Spirit being strong, the Bloody humor (when it has
sufficiently burned forth, and shall be freed from these adust particles)
should recover its pristine tenor, whereby it is made fit for motion, and a due
fermentation in the Heart, the sick tends toward health; but if, by a long
deflagration, and an inextricable confusion of the morbific matter, the liquor
of the Blood, being wanting of Spirits, and more pure Sulphur, or those same
(by the impure mixture growing ill) being as it were put under the yoke; is
rendered so lifeless, that it is not any longer rarefied, by the ferment of the
Heart, or inkindled; by degrees, its heat, and motion, together with Life it
self decays.

The procatartick causes, which dispose to this Disease, are, an hot and humid
Temper, an active habit of Body, a youthful Age, the Spring time, or Summer
season, a high and rich Diet, besides the often drinking of rich Wines, a
sedent^ry and idle life, a Body full of gross humors, and stuffed with vicious
Juices; but above all the rest, it appears by observation, that the frequent
letting of Blood, renders men more apt to Fevers; wherefore it is commonly
said, from whom Blood is once drawn, that unless they do the same every year,
they are prone to a Fever. The reason of this is, (unless I am deceived) by
the frequent letting of Blood, the Sulphur is more copiously gathered together,
in the mass of Blood; in the mean time, the Salt (which should bridle it, and
hinder it from raging) by this means is drawn away; for the Blood, the older it
grows, becomes so much the more Salt, the Salt of all the Elements not
evaporating. But by how much the more the Blood abounds in Salt, by so much the
less it abounds in Sulphur; for Salt eats and consumes the Sulphur, and makes
it evaporate: wherefore, they who are lean, and abound with a Salt Blood, are
less prone to Fevers. But when, by the letting of Blood, the ancient Blood is
drawn forth, in its stead another more rich, and more impregnated with Sulphur,
is substituted; so that it becomes less Salt, and more Sulphurous. Hence it is,
that those who often let Blood, are not only prone to Fevers, but also are
wont to grow fat, because of the Bloods being more impregnated with Sulphurous
Juice.

The evident causes, which deduce the latent disposition of this Fever into
act, are of the same sort, which procure an Ephemeran Fever, and simple
Synochus; in this rank chiefly come, Transpiration being hindered, and
Surfeiting. By reason of the effluvia being restrained, the mass of the Blood
being increased in bulk grows turgid, and conceives a Fervor, as it were from a
certain ferment, inspired anew, and cruelly boyls up; from thence, presently
the pores are more obstructed, by the infartion of the effluvia, and the frame
of the Liquor being loosned, the particles of the Sulphur, exuberating in the
Blood, leap forth from the mixture, and are inflamed by the ferment of the
heart, as it were by fire put to them, and so they enkindle a very intense
Fever. But from a Surfeit, both an immoderate fermentation is induced in the
Blood, and also a nitrous Sulphurous matter, apt for adustion, and an
inkindling is conveyed, as it were food, to the burning Blood.

In this Fever, four times or seasons are to be observed, in which, as it were
so many posts, or spaces, its course is performed: These are then, The
Beginning, the Augmentation, the Height, and Declination. These are wont to be
finished in some sooner, in others more slowly, or in a longer time. The
beginning ought to be computed, from the time the Blood begins to be made hot,
and its Sulphur to conceive a burning, until the ardors, and burnings are
diffused, through the whole mass of Blood. The Increase or Augmentation, is from
the time, that the Blood being made hot, and inkindled through the whole, burns
forth for some time, and its mass is aggravated with the Recrements, or burnt
Particles, which increase the fermentation. The state, or standing of the
Disease, is when (after the Blood has sufficiently burned forth, and its
burning now remits) the long vexed Blood, like a noble wrestler, when his
adversary is a little yielding, recollecting all his strength, endeavors a
bringing under, and a separation of that adust matter, with which it is filled
to a plenitude, and also, a Crisis or separation being once or oftener
attempted, an expulsion of it forth of doors. The Declination succeeds after
the Crisis or secretion, in which the Blood grows less hot, with a languishing
fire, and either, (the vital Spirit being as yet strong) overcomes what is left
of that adust and extraneous matter, and by degrees puts it forth, until it is
restored to its former vigor; or, whilst the same Spirit is too much
depressed, the liquor of the Blood, is still stuffed with adust recrements, and
therefore becomes troubled and depauperated, that it neither assimilates the
nourishing Juice, nor is made fit for an accension in the heart, for the
sustaining the lamp of Life.

1. When therefore any one is taken with a putrid Fever, the first assault is
for the most part accompanied with a shivering or horror: for when the Blood
begins to grow hot, there is a flux made, and a swelling up of the crude Juice,
freshly gathered together in the Vessels, even as in the fit of an intermitting
Fever, heat, and sometimes sweat follow, upon the shivering, by which, the
matter of that crude Juice is inkindled, and dispersed: afterward, a certain
remission of the heat follows, but yet from the fire still glowing in the
Blood, a lassitude, and perturbation with thirst, and waking, continually
infest: A pain arises in the Head, or Loins, partly from the ebullition of the
Blood, and partly from the motion of the nervous Juice being hindered; also a
nauseousness, or a vomiting offends the Stomach, because the Bile, flowing out
of the Choleduct Vessels, is poured into it, and a Convulsion from Vapors, and
from the sharp Juice brought through the Arteries, is excited in the Stomach. In
the mean time, although the heat be more increased, and inequal, it is not yet
strong, because the Blood as yet abounding with crude Juices, is only inkindled
by parts: and therefore burns out a little, and then ceases, and at last
returns; like a flame that is made by wet, and moist straw. In this condition
for some days, the Disease remains, the Urine is more red than usual, by reason
of the Salt, and Sulphur being more dissolved, and infected with the serum; It
still retains its Hypostasis or substance, because the Coction and assimilation
are not altogether depraved; it appears greater than ordinary, in its sediment,
which is yet easily separated, and falls to the bottom of its own accord. At
this time, they may let Blood, and administer Physic by Vomit, or Purge, so it
be done without any great perturbation of the Blood: it often happens, from
these kinds of evacuations, timely performed, that a greater increase of the
Disease is prevented, and the Fever as it were killed in the shell. The limits
of this stadium or space, are variously determined, according to the temper of
the sick, and other accidents of the Disease; sometimes, the first rudiments of
this Fever, are laid in a day or two; sometimes the beginning of the Disease is
extended to more; if in a corpulent Body full of Spirit, Juice, and hot Blood,
or it happen in a youthful Age, and very hot season, if the disposition to a
Fever be potent, and the evident cause coming thereupon be strong, the
Feverish heat, being once begun, quickly invades all the Blood, and on the
second or third day, having rooted it self, the Disease arises to its increase;
but if the Feverish indisposition, be begun in a less hot Body, a Phlegmatic
temper, or a melancholy, and in old age, or a cold season, the entrance is
longer, and scarce exceeds the limits of this first stadium or space, before
the sixth, or seventh day.

2. The increase of this Disease, is computed from what time, the burning of
the Fever has possessed the whole mass of Blood: that is, the Sulphur, or the
oily part of the Blood, having been long heated, and growing fervent in parts,
at length, like Hay laid up wet, breaks forth, after a long heating, all at
once into a flame; the Blood at this time cruelly boils up, and very much
inkindled in the Heart, by its deflagration, diffuses as it were a fiery heat
through the whole Body, and especially in the precordia; hence the sick complain
of intolerable thirst, besides a pain of the head, pertinacious wakings, and
oftentimes a delirium, Frenzy, and Convulsive motions infest: all food
whatsoever is loathsome, either it is cast up again by Vomit, or if retained,
being baked by too much heat, it goes into a Feverish matter; besides, there
happens a bitterness of the mouth, an ungrateful savor, a scurfiness of the
Tongue, a vehement and quick Pulse, an Urine highly red, and for the most part
troubled, full of Contents, without Hypostasis or laudable sediment; when the
Blood is at this time almost wholly inkindled by its deflagration, it begets
great plenty of adust matter, (as it were ashes remaining after a Fire) with
which the serum being very much stuffed, renders the Urine thick, and big with
Contents: Also the Blood, being filled with a load of this, to a rising up, is
irritated into Critical motions, by which this Feverish matter, (if it may be
done) being brought under, and separated, is shut out of doors; and indeed,
this state of the Fever induces that, in which a Judgment is discerned,
between Nature and the Disease, the strife being as it were brought to an
aequilibrium; and therefore the evacuation, which follows from thence, is
called the Crisis.

The state therefore, or height of a putrid Fever, is that time of the
Disease, in which Nature endeavors a Crisis, or an expulsion of the adust
matter, remaining after the deflagration of the Blood. To this is required, in
the first place, that the Blood has now for the most part burned forth;
because in the midst of its burning, Nature is not at leisure for a Crisis, nor
is it ever prosperously endeavored, nor in truth procured by Art with good
Success. Secondly, that the spirit of the Blood, does first, by some means
subdue this adust matter, or Caput mortuum, separate it from the profitable,
and render a period to the expulsion, for otherways, tho a copious evacuation
happens, Nature will never be free from her burden. Thirdly, that this matter,
be gathered together in such a quantity, that by its turgency, it may irritate
Nature to a Critical expulsion. If these rightly concur, a perfect Crisis of
the Disease, for the most part succeeds, in which, even as in the Fits of
intermitting Fevers, a Flux being arisen, whatsoever extraneous and
heterogeneous thing, is contained in the bosom of the Blood, is exagitated,
then being separated, and involved with serum, it is thrust forth of doors;
when any thing of these is wanting, the Crisis, for the most part, is in vain,
and not to be trusted, and rarely cures the Disease. For if in the midst of the
burning, before the Blood has sufficiently burned forth, an evacuation
happens, by Sweat, a Lask, Bleeding, or any other way, the adust matter is not
all separated, or else, if for the present, it be drawn away for the greatest
part, the Blood more largely flaming out, presently substitutes new, and will
renew the Fever again, that seemed to be vanquished: If that this matter, not
being yet overcome, nor brought to a fullness of rising up, be irritated to an
expulsion by Nature, an imperfect, and partial Crisis only follows; and when
the first endeavor of excretion shall be in vain, rarely a perfect, and
curatory succeeds after that one time.

The Crisis in a continual Fever, is almost the same thing, as the Fit of the
intermitting Fevers. For as in this, when the mass of Blood, is filled to a
fullness of swelling up, with the particles of depraved alible Juice, and fitted
for maturation, there are made a Flux, secretion, and expulsion out of doors of
that matter: so in a continual Fever, from the deflagration of the Blood, and
alible Juice, very many little Bodies of adust matter are gathered together,
with which, when the Blood is aggravated, and is at leisure, a little from the
burning, it overcomes them, by little and little separates them, and then a
Flux being raised up, endeavors to cast them out of doors: wherefore, as the
Fits of intermitting Fevers come not but at a set time, and after so many
hours, so also the Critical motions, happen from the fourth day to the fourth,
or perhaps from the seventh day to the seventh, for in this kind of space, the
Blood being inkindled burns forth, and with its burning makes an heap of adust
matter, as it were ashes, which being troublesome to Nature by their irritation,
induces Critical motions.

Therefore, what some affirm is not true, That the Crises depend altogether on
the influences of the Moon, and Stars, and follow their Aspects, Quadrations,
Oppositions, or Conjunctions: because the Critical evacuations are only
determined, by the gathering together, and the swelling up, of the adust
matter. For, as soon as the Blood is at leisure, from the deflagration, and
being filled with the particle of that adust matter, is able in some measure to
overcome, and separate them, presently a Flux, or swelling up being risen, it
endeavors to thrust them forth by any way; which, for that they are easily to
be separated from the Blood, and the breathing places of the skin are
sufficiently open, being involved with serum, are sent away with sweat. And
this is the best way of the Crisis, which if it rightly succeeds, very often,
wholly, and at one time, perfectly cures the Disease without danger of relapse:
To this next, follows the Crisis, which which is endeavored by the Hemorrhage
or bleeding at nose; for this matter, as it were the flowring, being moved with
the Blood, (if it be not cast forth by sweat, by reason of a less free
transpiration) is transferred from the heart, into some remote part, and
frequently is cast into the head, by the impetuous rapture of the Blood; where,
if a passage be open, from the private holes opening into the nostrils, the
morbific matter, leaps forth of doors, with a portion of the Blood. But
otherways being oftentimes fixed in the Brain, brings a frenzy, delirium, or
other grievous, and tedious Diseases of the head; yea, it is to be observed, that
almost in all continual Fevers whatsoever, when they are hardly or imperfectly
cured, so that the Blood is infected, for a long time with the Feverish matter
or adust recrements, that from thence, the nervous Juice (as it seems)
contracting an infection, pertinacious distempers, to wit, watchings, also
Deliriums, Tremblings, Convulsive motions, and long adhering weakness of the
nervous parts follow. Also, there are other ways of Crisis, by which Nature
endeavors, not at once and wholly, but by little and little, and by parts, to
expel the Feverish matter; now by Urine, now by Vomit, or Stool, now by
breakings forth, and buboes, or biles; by what way soever, that it may be done
with a good event, it is required, that the deflagration of the Blood be past,
and that the adust matter be concocted, and rendered fit to be separated.

The state or standing of the Disease, is therefore not one, and simple, nor
always happens after the same manner, but with a various difference of
symptoms, and tending to far different events. But by a prudent Physician, a
Prognostication is expedient to be given, in what space of time, the Disease
will come to its height or standing, and what end it will have.

If the Fever be vehement from the beginning, and suddenly invades the whole
mass of Blood with a burning; if it urges constantly, and equally without any
remission, with a ferocity of symptoms; for the most part, the Blood will so
much burn forth, in the space of four days, that the adust matter, will arise
to a fullness of swelling up, for the making a Crisis. But if its beginnings are
more slow, and the accension of the Blood often interrupted, the Fever will
come to its acme or height, about the seventh day. If it should begin yet more
remiss, the standing of the Disease is wont to be drawn out, to the Eleventh or
Fourteenth day. In the mean time it is to be noted, that as the Fits of
intermitting Fevers return at set times, so the Critical motions in continual
Fevers, (but for the most part they observe the fourth day:) for although the
Crisis may be perfectly prorogued to the fourteenth, seventeenth, or perhaps
the twentieth day, because all things, requisite to the full curing of the
Disease, do not sooner concur; yet in the time betwixt, more light motions
happen, by which the Feverish matter arising leisurely, to an increase, is a
little emptied, and as it were cut off by parts, until Nature may be able to
enter upon its more full discussion; but when the great provision of the adust
matter, in the burning Blood, is heaped up in the Vessels, Nature, unless
otherways disturbed, on every fourth day, being tired with the plenty of
matter, trys to shake off part of its burden by a certain swelling up:
wherefore, for the most part, the Critical motions happen on the fourth,
seventh, eleventh, and fourteenth days, not by the direction of the Planets,
but by reason of the necessity of Nature.

As to the event, whether the Crisis shall be good or not, certain
foreknowledges are taken, from the strength of the sick, the Pulse, Urine, and
other signs, and concourse of symptoms: If the sick appear with some strength,
the fire of the Fever urging, has a strong and equal Pulse, if the Urine be
of a moderate consistency with some sediment, with a separation of the
Contents, and easily falling to the bottom, if the Disease shall make its
progress, without great Vomiting, Watchings, Frenzy, Convulsive motions, and
suspicion of malignity, the standing will be laudable, and to be expected with
a good Crisis: if the contrary to these happen, viz. that presently strength is
cast down, and that the sick is obnoxious to frequent Swoonings, Convulsions, a
delirium, with a weak intermitting or unequal Pulse, if pertinacious watchings,
intolerable thirst, and Vomiting continually infest; if the Urine be thick and
troubled, without sediment, or sinking down of the parts, if, the burning yet
troubling, Nature is provoked to critical evacuations, a very dangerous state
of the Disease is imminent, nor may there be hoped for any thing of good from
the Crisis.

Concerning the Crisis of a Putrid Fever, we will here subjoyn a particular
Prognostication, in which, though the things, which from the beginning did
appear, might promise a most desired event, a very deadly one is imminent; I
have often observed, in a Putrid Fever, which begins slowly, and with a small
burning, if the Urine be red, and when rendered presently troubled, and thick,
which is not precipitated, neither by the cold, nor of its own accord, puts
down a sediment, and if at the same time, the sick lie for many days without
sleep, tho quiet, and that they toss not themselves up and down, their
condition is in danger: and the suspicion will be more, if in the mean time,
they are neither troubled with a strong Fever, nor infested with thirst, or
with a very troublesome heat; because those distempered after this manner, are
incident for the most part, about the state of the Disease, to a delirium,
Convulsive motions, and oftentimes fall into madness, from which they are
quickly cast into death; and when these symptoms arise, the Urine is altered,
from a thick and red, into a thin and more pale Urine. It seems in this case,
the mass of Blood, beink taken with the Fever, not to grow turgid, so with
Sulphur exalted to the height, as Wines or Beer are wont in their
Effervescencies; but (the Salt, and the terrestrial Lee or Dregs, being stirred
together with the Sulphur) to be affected after the same way, as Wines and
Beer, being suddenly disturbed with Thunder, and growing sour; wherefore, although
the Blood does not presently conceive an immoderate heat from the Fever, yet
its disposition being changed, it wholly depraves the Juice destinated to the
Brain, and Nervous parts, and therefore, about the beginning of the Fever,
pertinacious watchings happen, then the state growing urgent, the economy of
the whole Nervous stock is perverted. Melancholic persons are most obnoxious to
these sort of Fevers, in whom the unruliness of the Sulphur, are a little
restrained, by the Salt, and Earthy dregs being stirred up with it,
notwithstanding which, all being leisurely carried forth, break forth
afterward, with a greater slaughter.

When the Disease shall come to the standing, either the business is done at
one conflict, and from thence with a manifest declination, there is made a
translation to life, or death, or there are made frequent skirmishes, between
Nature and the Disease, and critical motions are often attempted, before the
victory is yielded to either party.

1. As to the first, If after the Blood has sufficiently burned forth, with a
good precursion of signs and symptoms, and its burning has remitted, the adust
matter being equally brought under, and subtilated, arises from a full
increase, to the motion of boiling up; and Nature being free from any
impediment or depression, is strong with able strength enough, for the
decertation or strife, the Feverish matter, for the most part, is exterminated
at one motion of its flowring or putting forth, and the Blood being freed from
its fellowship and infection, soon recovers its former vigor.

2. But if Nature is stirred up, to a critical motion, before the Blood has
perfectly burnt forth, or that adust matter is prepared for excretion, although,
as to the rest, things are in a moderate condition; yet from hence, but an
imperfect Crisis follows, by which indeed, something of the load or burden,
with which the Blood is oppressed, is drawn away; notwithstanding presently
another springs up afresh, in its place, and then at set times, (perhaps in
four, or seven days space) like the fits of intermitting Fevers, the critical
motions are repeated, the second, and perhaps the third time, before the strife
being ended, the matter openly inclines to this, or that party.

3. But when, with the preceding evil appearance, of signs and symptoms, the
burning of the Blood yet urging, the critical motion is provoked, without any
coction of the Feverish matter, sometimes Nature is overthrown at the first
conflict, nor does she recollect herself, but yielding her powers overcome by
the Disease, is precipitated into death. Nor is the business much better, when
the Crisis is at first imperfect, and in vain, celebrated, without any ease to
the sick, and from thence, the next to this succeeds worse, and then in
another, and perhaps another conflict, the Disease prevails, until the strength
being wholly broken, and cast down, there is a plain end of life.

Thus much concerning the state and Crisis of the Disease, on whose good or
improsperous success, the event of the Disease depends; the declination of the
Fever, takes its period of this, of which we must speak next.

4 Although the Declining of the Fever, for the most part, is taken in the better
part, that it denotes the condition of the sick growing well of the Disease, in
which the Blood being almost freed from its Effervency, recovers leisurly,
strength and spirits, that were lost, and expels what extraneous thing is left
remaining in its bosom; yet, in a genuine enough signification, it may be used
for that state, when from an ill Crisis, or in vain, the Blood being
depauperated, and infected with an extraneous and Feverish mixture, still
declines for the worse, until at length (like Wine changed into a lifelessness)
being made wholly unable for circulation, and accension in the Heart, it calls
on death. Therefore, in this place, the name of declination signifies the
condition of the sick, and of the Disease, which follows the standing, whether
it tends to life, or to death; whether the Fever, or life it self of the sick,
at this time, declines.

As to the times of declination, it will be worth our labor to inquire, what
the temper of the Blood may be, and what turns of alterations it has undergone,
as often as from a good, or bad Crisis, there has been made a progress of the
Disease, toward Health, or Death. To wit, first, what the disposition, or
condition of the Blood and Spirits may be, from a good Crisis, and with what
alterations, its spoiled Liquor recovers its former vigor. Secondly, what their
temper is, from an evil Crisis, and by what degrees it still tends to worse;
and lastly, how they are, when from a doubtful state, and long weakness, the
sick hardly get up at length, and recover their health.

The vice, or depauperation, which the Blood has contracted from the Feverish
heat, consists in this: The Spirit very much evaporates, and is lost: the
Sulphurous part is too much scorched, and is much wasted by the deflagration,
and from its burning, the adust matter (as it were the Caput Mortuum) is left,
with the Particles of which, the mass of Blood is aggravated, and debilitated;
in the mean time, the Saline and earthy parts, are too much exalted, even as is
wont to come to pass in Wine, or Beer, by the use of too much Ferment. The
Blood, by these ways being spoiled, evilly assimilates the provision of the
Nutritious Juice, yea also, by reason of the roasting of the Sulphur in the
Heart, or defect of it, not rightly Fermenting, or inflamed, it untowardly
dispenses the Vital Spirit, in the mean time, from the adust matter, and Salt
too much exalted, it grows more fervent than it should, and more wastes it self.

1. From a good Crisis, the Spirit, tho made weaker, yet gets the upper hand,
wherefore, what is left of the Feverish matter, it by degrees overcomes, and
expels, and concocts, and assimilates (so what is brought be thin or slender)
the Nutritious Juice: from thence, the mass of Blood is amended anew, with
Spirit and Sulphur; and the Blood which now being Salt and sharp, did
continually grow hot, acquires at length a Sweet and Balsamic Nature, and being
quickened with a lively motion and heat, rightly performs the offices of life
and sense.

2. From a bad Crisis, the business is otherways, the Liquor of the Blood (like
Wine too much Fermented) degenerates, almost into a vappidness or lifelessness;
its Spirit is greatly deminished; the Relics which remain, are intricated,
and as it were overwhelmed, with the Particles of adust matter, from whence
there is yet a continual growing hot remaining in the Blood, yet without
concoction, or assimilation, of the Alible Juice, or separation of the
profitable, from the unprofitable: The benign Sulphur, and the Food of the
Vital flame, is much consumed, so that the Blood is less inkindled in the
Heart, than it ought to be; in the mean time; from the adust recrements, and
also the Salt, and Earth being too much carried forth, it perpetually burns in
the Vessels, with thirst and heat. And because it is daily depauperated, the
Spirit and benign Sulphur being wasted, and more infected, with the Salt, and
Earthy dregs being too much exalted, its Liquor in a short time becomes
tastless, and is made unfit for circulation, and for the inkindling in the
Heart, for the sustaining the Vital fire: wherefore there is a necessity that
life be lost, even as the flame of a Lamp is extinguished, when instead of the
wasted Oil, a Salt and Muddy Liquor only supplies it.

3. From an imperfect and doubtful Crisis, when the sick being weakened by a
long imbecility, become not well, but of a long time, the business is after
this manner. The Spirituous and Sulphurous parts of the Blood, are very much
consumed, by the slow deflagration; the remaining Liquor, being not Purged from
the adust recrements and feculencies, is rendered very impure; but when there is
yet remaining, something of Oil for the Vital Lamp, nor Spirits are altogether
wanting, for the subduing the Feverish matter, the Blood is still circulated,
and (tho but smally) is inkindled in the Heart: yea, and by little and little
the Spirits recollect themselves, set upon the matter remaining of the Fever,
and what they are able, begin to overcome it: then by a pertinacious assiduity,
of coction, like a flame, wavering and half extinct, among green wood, at
length rise up victorious, and restore anew, both with heat and motion,
leisurely renewed, a quick and lively Fermentation, in the Heart.

So much in general of the Fever called Putrid: it remains, before we descend
to the kinds, and particular Cases of it, that I recount the symptoms, and
signs chiefly notable, in the course of this Fever, and subjoyn the reasons,
and causes of them, and their manner of being done.

CHAP. X. Of the Symptoms, and Signs chiefly to be noted, in a Putrid Fever.
THE Symptoms, coming upon a Putrid Fever, although they argue, the economy of
the whole Body, to be for the most part depraved, and the disposition, and
functions of some part, or Member hurt; yet, the accidents, which a Physician
ought chiefly to consider, about the Diagnosis of this Disease, and its
Prognosis to be rightly instituted, may be referred to three casses or common
places; to wit, they have respect to the Viscera of Concoction, viz. the
Ventricle, and Intestines, with their Appendixes: Or secondly, to the humors,
flowing in the Vessels, viz. the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, and the thin
Liquor in the Nervous parts, together with the chief springs of either, viz.
the Heart, and Brain; or lastly, these symptoms respect the habit of the Body,
with the various constitution of the pores, and the extension or emarceration
of the solid parts. They, who would exactly observe, the course of this
Disease, and would fitly draw out Curatory intentions, may take notice of these
three heads of symptoms, and carefully consider, what alterations may happen in
these, as it were distinct Regions, according to the different times of the
Fever.

1. Troubles, and disorders, such as nauseousness, vomiting, want of Appetite,
indigestion, a looseness, a scurfiness of the Mouth and Tongue, a bitter
favor, are wont to infest about the Ventricle, and first passages, in the
whole course of this Fever. These, for the most part, are attributed to the
humors, first heaped together in the Stomach, and there putrefying: But
besides, that the recrements of the Chyle, being thoroughly roasted, by too much
heat, degenerate into an hurtful matter, very often, these kind of accidents
happen, for that the Purgings, and the filth of the Blood, and Nervous Juice,
whilst they grow hot, are carried inward, and being deposited in the membranes
of the Viscera, provoke Convulsions, and also make a filthy heap of vicious,
and very infestous humor. I have often observed, that about the beginning of
the Fever, the Blood growing hot, laid aside its recrements even inwardly,
with a benefit to the sick, where, although great molestations did arise about the
first passages, yet the burning was therefore more mild, the Pulse moderate,
and the Urine laudable, and these being after this manner in a Fever, quickly
grew well, with a slender diet, and the use of gentle evacuations. But if in
this case I should administer a vehement Cathartic, for the extirpating the
humors, that Natural Purging of the Blood being hindered, presently the Fever
became strong, with a red Urine, and troubled, a deep Pulse, Watchings, and
other horrid symptoms: also, oftentimes after the state of the Disease, by this
kind of interior Lustration or Purging, the adust matter, and excrementitious,
is separated from the Blood. Hence, sometimes a Lask, sometimes a scurfie
covering of the Mouth and Throat, follow: Wherefore, there is need of caution,
about the accidents which happen in the first passages, lest that whilst we
oppose them, we should pervert the motion of Nature; and lest whilst we
fortify these parts, against the course of the Morbific matter, we untowardly
keep the same shut up, in the mass of Blood.

The Symptom chiefly to be considered, about the Bloody mass, are, an heat
diffused through the whole, a burning of the Praecordia, thirst, a disorder of
the Pulse, a red urine, a spontaneous wearisomness, a loss of all strength, out
of which rightly considered, these things following may be known, viz. what the
manner of the heat is, or with what tenor the burning Blood flames forth; what
times of remission, or of increase, its Effervescency observes, in the
deflagration; whether it retains its Crasis, or mixture whole; for the burning
of it, and circulation of it inkindled, what strength of the Heart will
suffice, and what space the Vessels may require; so long as the Blood burns,
what plenty of adust recrements it may heap up, by what means it may overcome,
separate, or at lest endeavor to separate the same, and lastly, what way of a
Crisis it endeavors, and with what success.

The accidents, which have a respect to the thin Liquor, with the Brain, and
Nervous Appendix, are, disorders concerning sleep and waking, a debility of the
whole Body, a trembling, shivering, pains, Convulsive motions, Cramps of the
Viscera, Stupifaction, Frenzy; and the observation of which suggests, what
the temper, and constitution of that thin Liquor may be; by what means it
waters, and influtes the Nervous parts, and performs its circutes through them;
how the Animal Spirits execute the functions of the Viscera; what the state of
the Brain may be, whether it remain free from the incursion of the Feverish
matter, or whether it be not in danger of being overwhelmed, by reason of its
critical metastasis or translation.

Concerning the habit of the body may be observed, what may be the reason of
sweating, and the manner of it; whether only by vaporous Effluvia? or by
sweats? or also by little wealks! whether the flesh falls away on the sudden
from its wonted bulk? Or whether it retains it self a long while? What the
color of the Face is! And the vigor or habit of the Eyes? from these well laid
together, the course of the Fever may be best of all measured; at what time it
will come to its hight or standing? Whether Nature will prevail over the
Disease or not; with what manner of separation, and with what success she will
endeavor the expulsion of the Feverish matter; also by these signs may be
learned, by what degrees the Blood growing hot, and often congealed, does tend
toward Putrefaction, or Corruption; whether it does any thing concoct the
alible Juice poured to it; or whether or not it presently casts forth of doors,
all its provision by sweat, as often happens in the declination of this Disease.

By these symptoms and signs, a yet more plentiful Indication may be had, if
first it be known, upon what causes the several species of them depend; and by
what provision, they are wont to be raised up in our Body: wherefore I have
thought it worth our labor to recount particularly the chief of these; and to
explicate the reasons of them, and their ways of working. But the symptoms,
chiefly to be observed in a putrid Synochus, or continual fervor without
intermissions, are, an heat in the whole Body, a spontaneous weariness, a
burning of the Precordia, intolerable thirst, an ardor, and scurfiness of the
Tongue, or Jaws, a pain of the head and loins, pertinacious watchings,
Frenzy, Convulsive motions, a Syncope, Heart-burning, Vomiting, Nauseousness,
want of Appetite, a Looseness, a Flux, with which, not all at once, now with
these, now with those, this Disease is wont to be beset.

1. Heat, which is felt sharp and biteing, in the whole Body, depends upon the
too great effervency of the Blood, and the accension of it in the Heart: For
the Sulphurous or oily part of the Blood, being exalted, and taking an heat,
is inkindled in the heart, in a double proportion, more than it was wont;
wherefore, it copiously diffuses, by its deflagration, effluvia of heat through
the whole Body. When the Sulphur is less dissolved, and inkindled in the heart,
as in the green sickness, or the white dropsical Disease, etc. Heat is wanting
in the whole: but in a Fever, when the Sulphur too much burns forth, Heat
superabounds. For heat, depends not only upon the actual inflammation of the
Sulphur, or the firing of it, but an intense heat is excited without fire, in
many mixtures, where the particles of Sulphur are dissolved by corrosion, or
are more thickly heaped together for want of ventilation; wherefore, when Iron
is corroded by any acid mineral Spirit, or when Spirit of Nitre is poured on
the butter of Antimony, a mighty heat with a fume is produced; in like manner
when Dung, or Hay laid up wet, are kept from ventilation, grow highly hot: it
is the same reason, why the Blood burns above measure in Fevers, to wit, the
particles of the Sulphur, being too much exalted and made hot, are more thickly
heaped together in the Vessels, and are more dissolved, and as it were
inkindled by the ferment of the Heart; wherefore, they every way diffuse heat,
being loosned in the bond of the mixture, and every where stretched forth or
expansed.

2. A spontaneous weariness or lassitude, is felt in the whole Body: to wit, by
reason of the Vessels being distented with the boiling Blood, also the
musculous flesh is very much stuffed with Blood, and a copious breath, that it
is made less fit for motion, as they who are sick of an Anasarca, have their
limbs very unwealdy by reason of the abundance of serous humor: besides, in
Fevers, by reason of the inflammation of the Blood, the Juice, which is sent
for a supply to the nervous stock, departs from its due temper, that it becomes
little fit, for the actuating the Body.

3. The burning of the Praecordia is made, by reason of the Blood being more
copiously enkindled in the Chimny of the Heart, which from thence boiles forth
into the Lungs, with great ardency; wherefore, by how much the nearer this
Region is to that fire place of heat, it is pierced therefore with the greater
burning.

4. An almost unquenchable Thirst is caused, both from the glowing heat in the
Praecordia, also by reason of the sharp and hot particles of the Feverish
matter, affixed to the ventricle, in the circulating of the Blood; which
indeed, desire to be washed, even as salted and spiced meats, being plentifully
eaten, or also strong, or sour things, rouled in the mouth, or throat; for this
kind of distemper, calls for a more free swallowing down of Drink, as a member
too much heated, the pouring on of cold water.

5. The ardor, and scurfiness of the Tongue, and Jaws, as also oftentimes an
accretion of a certain white, or yellow, or black filth, happen without doubt,
because of the heat, and soot, exhaled from the Ventricle, and Lungs, burning
with heat: but the Tongue grows white, as often as that humidity, (with which
it is naturally much imbued) is dried up, and parched, and so the exterior skin
of the Tongue, is as it were roasted, by the burning heat, from hence also it
becomes scurfie; which is also seen in healthful people, when it happens, that
the Tongue is scorched by broth, or any other very hot suppings; in like
manner, as when the Tongues of Animals are boiled, for the use of the Table,
their skin becomes white and sharp or rugged. For whether the spittle is drawn
from the maxillary glandulas, (as the doctrine of the most ingenious Wharton
has first made known) or any other humor from the glandulas of the Jaws, or
elsewhere; yet because, by the reason of the heat, and dryness, it grows too
thick, and becomes clammy, also then the outward skin of the Tongue grows
nevertheless white; but also it is covered with a certain filthy glue, to wit,
because that humor, by reason of its thickness, may smear the Tongue, but
cannot wet, or moisten it: but if it happens, that the Tongue is inwardly
suffused, with a bilous humor, or outwardly tinged (as comes to pass by the use
of Choler-abounding Vomits) then its hairy nap, being spongy, imbibing the
yellow poison, exhibits also the like color. If that lastly, the heat be so
strong, that it burns the Blood, and inkindles a fire, more ardent than usual,
it follows, that from the fire place of the Heart, the breathing places through
the Lungs, scarcely sufficing for the ventilating so great fire, soot or smoke
is raised up, which being smitten to the furnace of the Pallat, strikes against
the Tongue, as it were in a reverberatory, and infects it with blackness. But
this same kind of blackness, (and as other filthinesses of the Tongue) is most
conspicuous in its middle parts, because the more exterior compass, is cleansed
by its frequent rubbing against the gums and palate.

6. Sometimes it happens in Fevers, and especially about their declinations,
that the Tongue, palate, gums, yea the cavity of the whole mouth, and throat,
are covered over with a certain viscous matter, as it were a whitish crust;
which being often wiped off, presently new springs again, and unless by rubbing
diligently, and washing the mouth, this crusty matter be frequently wiped away,
the sick are in hazard of being choked. This kind of distemper, is most often
excited in Children newly born; for they are wont, for the most part, within
fourteen days with an external growing hot, to be sprinkled through the whole
skin, with broad and red spots; if that this suffusion of redness, do not
freely break forth, or vanishes away sooner than it ought, for the most part,
this whitish crust follows, in the parts of the mouth. This symptom, when it
troubles Infants, after this manner, is wont to be ascribed to the fault of the
Milk, to wit, that being to sharp, it induces the ulcerous distemper of the
mouth. In those sick with Fevers, it is commonly attributed to thick vapors,
and soottie, elevated from the ventricle: But to me it seems most likely, that
in either, this distemper arises, from the impurities of the whole Blood, (and
perhaps in some measure of the nervous Juice) deposited about these parts: for,
as often as in the mass of either humor, any extraneous thing intimately mixed,
is contained, that it is not to be dispersed by sweat, nor easily sent away by
Urine, that, most often, is fixed, with the serous filth about the mouth; from
whence Catarrhs, tumors, and troublesome spittings are caused: For when for the
chewing of the meats, the salival humor in this place ought to be plentifully
suffused; nature very often endeavors to send forth of doors, what is
superfluous, or otherways troublesome, by these usual ways of excretion. Hence
from Mercury being taken, when both the Blood, and nervous Juice, are
abundantly stuffed, with its most smally divided particles, and endeavor to
thrust them forth, being involved with serum, because they are not able to
exterminate those mercurial little Bodies, being intimately confused, neither
by sweat, urine, or by any other ways, what is remaining, they endeavor to
expel through the Arteries, and other passages, which supply the mouth with
spittle, the same being involved with the serous Latex. Also in like manner, in
Fevers, when from a long deflagration of the Blood, the adust matter is very
much heaped together, of which no small part remaining, after the Crisis, is
yet confounded with the Blood, and nervous Juice, being fixed either to the
brain, or to some other place, from them it is at length supped up again, it is
most probable, that this matter, is thoroughly roasted, by a long concoction,
and so becomes almost like Glue, thick, wherefore, being not able to be
dispersed, neither by spittle, or insensible transpiration, nor to be separated
by the urinarie passages, but at length leisurely runs out, by the little
Arteries, and other passages of the spittle, lying open into the Palate, as the
most usual way of excretion, and forthwith by reason of its thickness grows
into that glewiness. The same reason holds in Infants, whose Blood being made
impure, by filths contracted in the Womb, presently it endeavors to purify it
self, by that exterior putting forth, which if it do not rightly succeed, by
reason of the thickness of the matter, immediately the viscous impurities, are
exterminated by this way, as the more open. I have known some, in the
declination of a Fever, to whom, not only this kind of Crust of gummy matter,
has happened in the parts of the mouth, but a copious salivation, as if they had
taken mercury, with a stinking of the breath, also a swelling of the Tongue,
and Gums, has been raised up for many days.

7. The pain of the Head, in Fevers is excited, because of the Meninges of the
Brain, being pulled or hauled with vapors, and with a sharp Blood, and hot; for
the Blood being impetuously moved, by reason of the direction of the great
Artery, is carried in a greater plenty to the Head, than to the lower parts;
because the passage, from the bosom of the Heart to the head, is strait, from
the same, to the inferior members, oblique, and as it were reflected;
wherefore, as the membranes are very sensible, and that there the Blood is
stopped, and reverberated, in its rapid course, it is no wonder, if cruel
headaches are excited in Fevers. Besides, this impetuous flowing of the Blood,
wherewith (as it were by a certain Ramming) the membranes of the Head being
distended, ache grievously; also sometime, Headaches arise, by reason of the
nervous Juice, (which is supplied from the burning Blood) being too sharp, and
pricking: wherefore, when the membranes, and nervous parts, are watered, with
the same, they being pulled by its acrimony, are moved into Pains and
Convulsions.

8. In like manner also, the other distempers of the Head, as watchings,
delirium, Frenzy, Convulsion, etc. arise, sometimes from the Blood being in a
rage, and so stirring up inordinate motions in the Brain, and sometimes also,
from the nervous Juice being depraved, and therefore made improportionate, to
the regiment of the Animal Spirits: But most often, these kind of symptoms are
frequent in Fevers, by reason of the translation of the Feverish matter, from
the bosom of the Blood, into these parts. For the Blood, being full of the
adust recrements, remaining after the deflagration, endeavors (like the
flowring of new Wine) to subdue, and exclude them from its Company, by every
manner of way; which, a Flux being arisen, when it cannot expel by Sweat,
Urine, or bleeding, it oftentimes transfers, to the substance of the Brain, and
there fixes them: and from hence chiefly, the aforsaid distempers, when they
are fixed, and firmly rooted, draw their original, when as the lighter, and
that are easily moved, often proceed from the afore-recited causes.

9. Convulsive motions, happen in Fevers, for diverse causes: sometimes, because
of the matter being heaped together in the first passages, which there haules
the membranous parts, with its notable pravity, and then, by the consent of the
nervous stock, the Convulsion is presently Communicated to the beginning of the
Nerves, in the Brain, and by that means draws aside now these, and now those
parts: by which means, Worms abounding in the Viscera, sharp humors being
stirred, and strong Medicines, induce Convulsions: or secondly, when the
Fever, is a partaker of some malignity, so in the small Pox, Measels, or the
Plague, frequently Convulsions happen; to wit, because the Blood is altered,
from its benign and natural temper, into a destroying and venomous, by which
the Nerves, and their beginnings, are pierced, and forced into Convulsions.
Also, oftentimes without the suspicion of malignity, in a putrid Fever,
Convulsive motions are induced, by reason of the translation of the Feverish
matter, to the Brain, as was but now intimated: so I have often observed, when
the Disease is not presently cured with the Crisis, the sick ly by it, with a
tedious sickness, and are made obnoxious to tremblings, and Convulsive motions.
Thirdly, and lastly, for the most part in every Fever, which terminates in
Death, Convulsive motions are the sad forerunners of it; which I think to
happen, not only from the malignity of the matter, with which the nervous stock
is pulled and pierced, but because the Spirits, very much exhausted and
debilitated, do not sufficiently blow up, and distend the Bodies of the Nerves,
wherefore, being released from their wonted extension, and tonick motion, they
are however by a more weak endeavor of the Spirits, agitated into a disordered
motion.

10. A syncope or swooning, is wont to be raised up several ways in Fevers,
but chiefly for these three causes, to wit, either from the mouth of the
Ventricle being distempered, which part, as it is interwoven with a manifold
texture of Nerves, is very sensible, and because from the same branch of the
sixth pare, little shoots of Nerves, are equally derived to the heart, and to
the Ventricle, of the Orifice of the Ventricle, so implanted with Nerves, be
distempered, with any great trouble, it is also Communicated to the heart, and
either the motion is stopped in it, or at least an inordinate one is excited,
whereby the equal Flux of the Spirits, and the Blood, is interrupted for a
time. I knew one in an acute Fever, taken with a frequent swooning, which
distemper wholly ceased, after he had cast forth by Vomit, a long and smooth
Worm. Secondly, a syncope also, is sometimes induced, because the invenomed
matter is circulated with the Blood, which suddenly fixes, and extinguishes the
vital Spirits, and congeals the Blood it self, that it is apt to stagnate in
the heart, as usually happens in the Pest, small Pox, etc. of which we shall
speak particularly hereafter. Thirdly, a syncope is wont to happen, by reason
of the more rare texture of the Spirits, which as they are very tender and
subtle, are easily unbent, by any immoderate motion or pain: so I have known
some, who being quiet in bed, have found themselves well enough, but being
removed from one place to another, presently have swooned away.

11. The pain of the Heart happens in Fevers, when the Ventricle, and
especially its Orifices, by reason of the manifold insertions of Nerves, being
very sensible, are beset with a sharp and bitterish humor, or else with an
acid, and corrosive; for hence a pain and trouble arises from the acrimony of
the humor, after the same manner, as when the sphincter of the fundament is
afflicted, in Cholloric dejections, with pain and molestation.

12. By reason of the same cause, Vomiting, and nauseousness are wont to be
excited, to wit, by the Ventricles being beset, and irritated to a Convulsion,
from an extraneous matter, and not akin to it self: Such an excrementitious
matter, may be gathered together in the Ventricle, by three ways; for either
the aliments, partly by reason of a want of an acid ferment, by which they
should be rightly Cooked, and partly by reason of the burning heat of the
Ventricle, are roasted into such a Corruption; or Secondly, this kind of
matter, is laid up in the Ventricle, from the Arteries, terminating in its
Cavity, as uses to happen in the small Pox, the Plague, and malignant Fevers;
or Thirdly, mere Choler, being pressed forth from the Choleduct Vessels, into
the empty intestine, by reason of an inverse motion, and as it were Convulsive,
of that intestine, it is poured into the Ventricle, want of Appetite, also
happens, by reason of the Ventricles abounding with vicious Juices, and because
the acid ferment, is wholly perverted, by the scorching heat. These kind of
distempers of the Ventricle, and Viscera, sometimes arise from an
excrementitious matter, (to wit, alimentous, degenerated in the concoction)
heaped together, a long while before the Fever, in the first passages, which
not seldom becomes, the occasional cause, of the Fever it self: but sometimes,
nauseousness, want of Appetite, Vomiting, pain of the Heart etc. are the
immediate products of the Fever; for when the day before the sickness, those
distempered, have been well enough in their Stomach, as soon as the immoderate
heat of the Blood was induced, whilst it boiled up above measure, both the
Effluvia, and the recrements, being wonted to be evaporated outwardly, also the
bilous humor, flowing out of the Choleduct Vessels, are poured into the
Ventricle; by which, its Crasis is overthrown; also the Relics of the Chyle,
and other contents in the Viscera, are egregiously depraved; from whence, the
aforesaid Distempers draw their Original.

14. No less frequent a symptom in Fevers, is a Diarrhea, or Flux of the
Belly, which sometime happens about the beginning of the Disease, and arises (for
the most part) either from the Bile, flowing forth of the Coleduct Vessels,
into the Duodenum; or from the recrements of the Blood, and Nervous Juice,
poured forth from the Arteries, and the passage of the Pancreas, into the
intestines. All the aforesaid humors, (but especially the Choleric) when they
are supplied in abundance, often Ferment with the mass remaining of the Chyme,
that the same swelling up with a spumous rarefaction, irritates the intestines,
and provokes to the motion of excretion: sometimes also, about the standing of
the Disease, and in the declination of it, a Lask is excited; and so, either
Nature being Conqueress, the more thick purgings of the Blood, are this way
critically sifted forth; or being overcome, the Flux of the Belly, is the
effect, and sign, of the Viscera wholly losing their strength, and firm tenor.
It sometimes happens in a Fever, that the Belly is always bound, that it is not
at all loosned, but by Physic, and tho the sick take nothing but liquid
things, for many days, the stools are still of a solid consistence, and hard,
this seems for the most part to be done, when the Blood growing sharply and
exceeding hot, like fire, consumes the humidities, wherever they flow, and
draws to it self, out of the Bowels, the watery matter, by a Copious emission
of vapors, and presently makes it to be evaporated outwardly: wherefore, the
thicker part, being left in the intestines, is made firm, from the scorching
heat, as it were a Caput Mortuum, remaining after distillation.

A Dyssentery is a distemper, so frequent in continual Fevers, that some years
it becomes Epidemical, and not more mild than the Plague, kills many: The cause
of it is wont to be, not any humor produced within in the Viscera, that
corrodes the intestines with its Acrimony, (as some affirm) but a certain
infection impressed on the Blood, and so intimately confused with it, that,
under the form of a vapor, or a sincere humor, it cannot be pulled away from
the Blood: wherefore, the thrusting forwards, toward the intestines, unlocks
the little mouths of the Arteries, and makes there little Ulcers, and
exudations or flowings forth of the Blood, like as when from the Feverish
Blood. Pustles and inflammations break forth outwardly, with a flowring toward
the skin: But it is most likely, these dysenteric distempers, which accompany
Malignant, or Epidemical Fevers, arise from a certain coagulation of the
Blood, as shall be more fully declared hereafter.

And here also, among the symptoms of Fevers, might be recited, what are wont
to appear outwardly, in the superficies of the Body, as are Spots, Whelks,
Buboes, Carbuncles, etc. but because these belong after an especial manner to a
Malignant Fever, therefore we will forbear in this place, from the
consideration of them, until we shall speak of the Plague, Smallpox, the
Pestilential, and Malignant Fever.

The Pulse and Urine shall conclude here the troop of symptoms and signs in a
Putrid Fever, which are much heeded, for the finding out, both the state and
the strength of the sick: For, as there are two things, by which our life is
propped, viz. Heat inkindled in the Heart, and concoction to be made in the
Viscera, and Vessels, because the Pulse and Urine, best show the alterations in
either, induced in a Fever, therefore from hence, a most certain judgment is
taken of this Disease, about to end, in Death or Health. I think it is not
needful, to speak of th^se at large, or to recount the several causes and
differences of either: It will suffice for me to note here, the chiefest things
of them, and what are worthy of consideration in the course of Fevers. And
first of all the Pulse is consulted, as it were a Thermometer or Weather-Glass,
constituted by Nature, that from thence, the heat inkindled, in a Fever might
be meted; which if it should be more strong, stirs up a great ebullition or
boiling up of the Blood, the Artery beats more strongly and quicker, so long as
the Spirits are in strength; then they being a little exhausted, the more
strong Pulse is remitted; which however is compensated with swiftness, and is
made quick, and small. If the Fever be gentler, and is troubled with a lesser
burning, the Pulse also declines less, from its Natural condition, and the
moderation of this, in the whole course of the Disease, denotes the truces of
Nature. Neither does the Pulse only, betray the forces of the Fever, as of an
Enemy, but shows also plainly the strength of Nature, and her ability of
resisting. So long as the Pulse is laudable, the matter goes well, and it shows
good hopes; but from the evil state of this, a bad omen is shown, and a despair
of Health. So without a frequent, and diligent examination of the Pulse a
Physician connot make a right judgment or Prognostication, or safely prescribe
Physic.

1. As to the first thing, it ought to be known (as much as may be) what every
ones Pulse is, according to its Natural Constitution; for it is in these
stronger, in those weaker: then it is to be considered, in every moment of the
Fevers, by what degrees it is distant from its Natural state: for now it is
sometimes more vehement, and argues the Fever to grow stronger; now it is
depressed, below its wont, and denotes the Spirits and Strength dejected.

Those whose Pulse in Health beats weakly and languishing, when taken with a
Fever, if they have a small and weak Pulse, it is not so evil a sign, that we
should presently despair of their Health: In whom the Pulse is by Nature strong
and vehement, if after the Crisis of the Disease, it has scarce a moderate
vigor, tho it be not wholly weak, it argues the condition of the sick to be
suspected, and not safe.

If from the beginning of the Fever, before the Blood has flamed out, or if a
Crisis being made, when part of the burden is drawn away, or at another time,
without an evident cause, the Pulse becomes weak, it portends evilly: but if
after long watchings, or great evacuations, the Pulse is made a little weaker,
Health is not therefore to be despaired of, because the strength cast down by
these means, or overwhelmed, may be restored, and the Spirits renewed.

When the Pulse is suddenly altered for the worse tho the sick seem to be
better, as to the rest of the symptoms, you may forespeak the sad
prognostication of Death; and so contrariwise, although most horrid symptoms urge,
and yet the Pulse is laudable, Health may be yet hoped for. If in a strong man,
that has a Fever, the Pulse is very small, and creepingly, or becomes like
the motion of Ants, death is at hand.

2. In the exhibiting of Medicines, cautions and rules of no small moment are
taken; Purging and Vomiting are forbid, by the pulse being too quick and
violent; also by being low and depressed; because, whilst the Blood is too
fervent, evacuation helps little, because both what is hurtful is not
separated, also for that by the perturbation, the strength or spirits, are more
debilitated. But when the spirits are broken, and strength cast down, Medicines
cast them more down, and sometimes wholly overthrows them. Wherefore, when a
Physician thinks of evacuation, upwards or downwards, he first examines the
pulse, and goes about this work only, when Nature is strong and quiet; that she
may at once be at leisure, for the operation of the Medicine, and may have
sufficient strength.

Nor is there less need of circumspection, in sweating Medicines and Cordials:
which, if administered in the Feverish fit, do too much strengthen, the former
violent motion of the Heart, and oftentimes break its strength; also, when the
Pulse is very languid, if hot and strong Cordials are administered, (as when a
small flame is troubled with a more strong blast of wind) life is easily
extinguished; wherefore, it is a vulgar observation, that Cordials often
accelerate death, for that by too much troubling the Blood, they sooner beat
down strength.

There is yet the most need of the caution, and direction of the Pulse, in
exhibiting narcoticks; for these, (because they perform their work by
extinguishing, and fixing the too fierce vital spirits) if used in a weak or
inconstant Pulse, either by diminishing the vital spirits, render them wholly
insufficient for the Disease, or by suffocating them too much, cause a
perpetual sleep: wherefore, in a languid, unequal, or formicating or creeping
Pulse, opiats are to be shunned, more than a mad Dog or a Snake.

An unequal, and intermitting Pulse, has a most evil report, from the writings
of Physicians; yet, although of an ill note, does not so certainly portend death,
as a weak Pulse: for I have known many, to have recovered, tho by those kind of
signs condemned to the Grave; because the inordination of the Spirits, and the
Blood, may be more certainly and easily composed, or allayed, than their
dejection restored.

2. The inspection of Urines in Fevers, before all other Diseases whatsoever,
has more of certainty, and is of greatest use: for from hence, the conditions
of the sick, and of the Disease are best known, and the medical intentions,
concerning what is to be done, are better directed; what observations, and
rules, concerning this thing, are vulgarly set forth, are so many, that it
would be almost an infinite labor and tediousness, to recount them all: it
will be sufficient here, to note the chief of them.

Concerning the Urines of persons in Fevers, there are chiefly to be
considered, the color, consistency, contents, and subsidency or settling. The
color of the Urine, shows the measure, or excess of heat in the Blood; which,
as it is increased, and becomes more remiss; the Urine also is more, or less
red; the cause of which is, the ebullition of the Blood or the effervescency
induced from the Fever, to the Blood; by reason of which, the particles of
Salt, and Sulphur, implanted in the Blood, humors, and solid parts, are more
dissolved, and incocted with the serum, and impart to it a redness; even as,
when Salt of Tartar, and common Sulphur being mixed one with another, and
boiled in water, impart a deep red color to the Liquor.

The Urines of some, are highly red, when they are but a little, or lightly
Feverish: and on the contrary, the Urines of others, laboring with a
Feverish burning, are less colored. Who abound with lively heat, and a very
hot Blood, or are obnoxious to the Scurvy, phthifis, or hypochondriac
distemper, when by taking cold, condensation, surfeit, or drinking of Wine,
they are troubled by any little Fever, they render a Urine strongly red: for
that the particles of Salt and Sulphur, remain exalted in their Blood, and
before half loosned; wherefore, there is a necessity, that the Fever urging,
they are more boiled in the serum; on the contrary, they who are endued with a
cold temper, with a faint and weak Pulse, being taken with a Fever, with a
greater effervescency of the Blood, render their Urine less colored.

The consistency, contents, and subsidency of Urines, being put as it were upon
the same third, depend all of them, on the adust and recrementitious matter,
which is remaining in the Blood, after the Feverish deflagration: if there
shall be plenty of this, the consistency of the Urine becomes somewhat thicker,
and after it has stood, it is troubled by the cold: but if there be a lesser
quantity of this, or otherways derived than to the Reins, (to wit, by sweat, or
is called away by a critical translation, to this or that part) the consistency
is made thinner, and the Liquor remains clear. Also the particles of this
matter, do enlarge the contents of the Urine, which show themselves diversely,
according as the nutricious Juice, is now somewhat cooked, and assimilated by
the Blood, now altogether perverted, and carried into a putrefaction, some
signs of concoction, and assimulation, show themselves, in the Urines of
Feverish persons, now a laudable Hypostasis now some marks and rudiments of
the same: A want of Hypostasis, and the confusion, and perturbation of the
Urine, denote the concoction vitiated, But as this matter is more or less
roasted, in the Blood, the contents are now of a pale, now of a red color,
like oker. By reason, that the recrements, confounded with the Blood, either
the Spirit being strong, begin to be overcome, and separated, or the same being
depressed too much, they are less able to be separated, also the contents of
the Urine, are wont to be more or less, sooner or slower separated, from the
rest of the Liquor, and to sink down toward the bottom.

As to the Prognostics, to be taken from the Urine, we may take notice, that
the color of the Urine being somewhat more remiss, the consistency mean, the
contents few, and the subsiding free or easily collected into a Cloud, portend
good: on the contrary, a deep red, a thick and troubled consistency, thick and
cloudy contents, which slowly or scarce at all sink to the bottom, denote a
very great heat, plenty of adust matter, and its being brought under, and
secretion, difficult or frustrated.

As to the Medicinal directions, the business depends on this, that we attend,
by the frequent inspection of the Urine, the motion of Nature, and be helpful
to the same; neither is it to be moved, by purge or sweat, but when a certain
hypostasis of the Urine shows signs of concoction and separation. I thought it
needless to say any more here concerning this matter, because those things are
more largly handled elsewhere, in a proper place, which belong to Urines.

CHAP. XI. Of the Kinds, and Cure of a Putrid Synochus, or contitinual Fever.
ANd thus much for a Putrid Synochus in general, in which is described its
formal reason, according to the accidents and symptoms which are commonly
observed in its Figure; there are besides, (I shall not say species but) some
varieties, or irregularities of this Disease, in which, this Fever sometimes
declines from this common Rule, and by reason of some accidental Distempers,
gets new names and distinctions.

In the first place therefore, a Putrid Synochus is wont to be divided into
Symptomatick, and essential; It is called Symptomatick, which draws its
beginning from some other Distemper, or Disease before excited in the Body, so
that the Fever, is only a symptom, coming upon that other Disease: of which
sort is accounted, what depends upon the squinancy, plurisie, the inflammation
or imposthume of the Lungs, or any imposthume from a wound, or ulcer in a
principle part, or its neighborhood, of which we think a little otherways,
viz. That truly no Putrid Fever is merely Symptomatical; perhaps it may arise
occasionally, from some other Distemper; but it is founded immediately, in the
Sulphurous part of the Blood being made too hot, and as it were inkindled: for
without a Procatarsis, or preceding indisposition of the Blood, the aforesaid
Distempers, rarely, or not at all, cause a Putrid Fever.

As to what respects the squinancy, plurisie, the inflammation or imposthume of
the Lungs, and the like; I say, that these are the products of the Fever, or
Distempers following it; but by no means the cause of it; for most often the
evident cause, went before, which produced the Feverish effervescency of the
Blood, as a taking of cold evacuation being hindered, etc. then, although the sick
do not openly grow presently into a Fever, yet a greater ebullition of the
Blood, than was wont, is stirred up, as may be easily conjectured from the
Urine, Pulse, and inquietude of the whole Body. After some days, ^nhw sooner,
now later) an Inflammation is brought forth, in one part or other; the reason of
which, may probable enough be said to be of this sort: The Blood, by reason of
the effluvia being retained, (which are like ferment) is increased in its bulk,
and grows more turgid than its wont, in the Vessels; and when for want of
Ventilation, it is straightened in the space of its circulation, it easily
springs forth, where it can find a passage, through the Arteries, and being
extravasated, from the broken thread of Circulation, it gathers together into a
Tumor: and because from this kind of tumor, an heat, and pain, are increased in
the part, the Blood is more disturbed in its motion, and so the Fever, at
first inkindled, is more aggravated.

Further, in these kind of Distempers, we may take notice, of a certain
aptitude of the Blood to be coagulated, whereby it is made less fluid, so that
it is apt to be congealed in the lesser Vessels: even as it is to be perceived
in Milk, when it begins to sour, for then it will not be boiled, nor heated
over the fire, without coagulation: and in like manner, there is to be
suspected in the Blood, a certain disposition to growing sour, by reason of
which, it is made more obnoxious to coagulation; for it easily appears, that in
a plurisie, a peripneumonia, the squinancy, and the like Diseases, the
inflammation, or extravasation of the Blood, does not always depend on the
exuberancy of the Blood, and plenitude of the Vessels: for oftentimes, the
Blood is stopped in its motion, with a weak pulse, and a sinking down of the
Vessels, and being extravasated in the side, or elsewhere, causes a most acute
pain, yea being driven from one part, by and by it is fixed in another: and
sometimes it begins to stagnate in the heart it self, and there oftentimes
induces a deadly oppression: wherefore, some pluritical people, are wont, when
the pains are gone, to complain of a great burden, and as it were weight,
fixed about the region of the Heart: And when we have opened the dead Bodies,
of such as have dyed of these kind of Diseases, we have seen the Blood to be
gathered together, in little bits, or oblong gobblets, in the secret parts of
the Heart, and round about the cavities of the Vessels. But for that these
Diseases, are wont to be handled apart from the Fever, therefore we shall say
no more of them here.

It only remains, that we inquire, whether the Fever which accompanies these
Distempers, is to be esteemed in the rank of those, that are called Putrid, or
not? To which we reply, that most often, they are simple Fevers, in which only
a subtle, and spirituous part of the Blood is inflamed; and therefore, it the
extravasated Blood may be restored to circulation, by a plentiful detraction of
the Blood, or an emptying the Vessels by sweat, presently the growing hot of
the Blood is appeased, and the Fever shortly allayed. But sometimes, when a
predisposition, as in a Plethora, or fullness of good humor, or in a great
Cacochymie or fullness of evil Juices, brings it on, together with the same kind
of distempers, a Putrid Fever is inkindled, wholly from the same cause.

Among the symptomatick Fevers, is reckoned that which is commonly called the
slow Fever: they who are sick of this, are more than usually hot, especially
after eating, any motion, or exercise; the Urine for the most part is red, the
Spirits are feeble; and strength cast down, as to their appetite, and rest,
they are indifferently well, they have neither Cough, nor much spitting, but
they daily (like those in Consumptions) grow lean, without any evident cause.
The fault for the most part is ascribed, to obstructions in some inward, (as
the liver, spleen, or mesentery) by whose default, the aliment is not well
Cooked, nor rightly dispensed. But it seems to me, that this sort of distemper,
is immediately founded in the evil disposition of the Blood, by which it is
inclined, into a too salt and sour temper, and therefore is rendered less apt
for nutrition, and an equal circulation. For the Blood in the Heart, just like
oil in a Lamp, if it redounds too much with saline Particles, is inkindled not
pleasantly, and equally, but with a noise, and great evaporation of the parts;
whereby indeed, it is sooner wasted, and exhibits but a languishing, and weak
flame. I opened one, sometime since dead of this Disease, in whom the Viscera
destinated to concoction, were well enough, but the Lungs were without
moisture, and dry, and beset throughout with a sandy matter like Chaulk. Also
oftentimes, in this Disease, the Mesentery is beset, the glandules being filled
with such a Chaulky matter: But whether the Blood being made more saltish, does
first bring in these kind of distempers of the Viscera, or whether the
Dyscrasie, or evil disposition of the Viscera, first brings it upon the Blood
is uncertain: it seems probable, that either distemper depends upon the other,
and that the causes of either evil are reciprocal.

But the Fever, which chiefly deserves to be called Symptomatic, is that which
is excited in Phthisical persons, from an Ulcer, or Consumption of the Lungs.
For the whole Blood, whilst it passes through the Lungs, in its circulation,
often impresses on this Inward, the ideas of very many Diseases; and on the
other side, receives the same from it, being evilly affected, whatsoever impure
thing is contained in the mass of the Blood, as the flowring of New Wine, is
cast forth by extremities of the Arteries; wherefore, when Nature being made
more weak, it cannot transfer its recrements into the superficies of the Body,
it deposes them, by a more near Purgation into the Lungs. From hence a
Cacochymia, or fullness of ill juices, and many Chronical Diseases, end in a
Consumption: in like manner, when the flesh of the Lungs wastes, or abounding
with an Ulcerous matter, becomes half putrid, the Blood passing through it, is
infected with the purulent matter, or tabid infection, and for that cause, is
stirred up into a continual Effervescency, by reason of the confusion of
something not miscible, and wherefore, it induces an assiduous Fever, and
wholly perverts the Alible Juice. The same reason is, of Fevers, form an
Ulcer, or Imposthume, oftentimes raised up in other parts: for these, even as
the tabid constitution of the Lungs, cause oftentimes a Consumption, and
Hectic Fever. The full consideration of these, are not for this place,
wherefore, we will return, whence we have digressed, to a Putrid Fever
properly called, or essential.

The Essential Putrid Synochus, is wont to be divided, into a Putrid (such as
is already described) into a Causon, or hot burning Fever; and besides into a
Quotidian, Tertian, and Quartan: The Putrid Synochus, but now delineated, ought
to be the rule or square of the rest, to whose type, most Fevers, which are of
this kind, are to be composed. As to the rest, but now mentioned, according as
they vary their kind, I shall briefly subjoyn.

The Causon, or Burning Fever, is that which performs its course, with a
greater heat, almost intolerable thirst, and other symptoms, arguing a greater
inflammation of the Blood: The formal reason of it, by which it is differenced
from the rest, consists in this; that the temper of the Blood is hotter, that
is, abounds more with fireable Sulphur; therefore, when it grows fervent, it is
inkindled in a greater plenty, and with its deflagration, diffuses the Effluvia
of a most intense heat, through the whole Body: its motion is acute, and
quickly comes to its standing, it is compassed about with more horrid symptoms,
has a difficult Crisis, and an even full of danger.

But as to what respects those periods, or fits, in which a Putrid Fever
sometimes is wont to be more cruel, at a set time; and (as if intermitting) now
every day, now every third, or fourth day, repeats as it were the Feverish
fit; the reason of this seems not easily to be explicated: especially, if we
reject from this cense, the fewer humors, to the spontaneous motion of which,
this distemper is commonly ascribed, concerning this matter, what seems most
likely to me, I shall doubtingly propose. In a continual Fever, there are two
chief things, (as we have already noted) which for the most part induce the
Effervency of the Blood; to wit, the exaltation and inkindling of the
Sulphurous part of the Blood, then consequently, an heaping together of the
adust matter, and remaining after the burning of the Blood, to a swelling up:
upon the former the continuance of the Fever, upon the other, its standing,
and critical perturbations, depend: to these some times, a certain third thing
happens, to wit, a fullness, and swelling up of the crude Juice, from the
Aliments newly taken; which in a continual Fever, (as in the fits of
Intermitting Fevers) induces a greater Effervency, at set intervals of times.
But why this does not always happen, nor wholly after the same manner, the
reason is this: when the Putrid Synochus is very acute, and the whole Blood
almost is quickly inflamed, and highly rages, whatsoever of Nutritious Juice,
is poured to the Blood, is presently burnt, and consumed by the fire;
wherefore, little or nothing of it, is contained in the mass of Blood, for the
matter of a fit. But if this Fever be less acute, and the Blood only flames
forth moderately, and in parts, the supplement of the crude Juice, is not
wholly consumed, by the burning; but is perverted, by a more gentle fire, into
a Fermentative matter, which, when it arises in the Vessels to a fullness of
swelling up, conceives a Flux, and by its Effervency, makes stronger the
Feverish heat, before glowing in the Blood, as it were by the coming of new
fuel. The flowring of this matter does not seldom begin with a light
shivering, or cold, and sometimes end with sweat: but for the most part, it is
exhaled by insensible transpiration. In every fit, besides the provision of the
degenerate Nutritious Juice, something from the adust, and burnt matter of the
Blood, evaporates; wherefore, the Crisis of the Disease, is drawn forth longer,
that it is hardly cured, under eleven or fourteen days; yea (for the most part)
in this sort of Fever, with fits and remissions coming between, the perfect
Cure of the Disease happens, scarcely within twenty days: and sometimes
leisurely, without any through Crisis, it remits, and then, by a long
declination, it is ended in Death, or Health.

But that this kind of remission, and acerbation or growing more violent, are
varied, according to the type of an Intermitting Fever, that they repeat their
turns now every day, now every other day, and sometimes not but within four
days, the reason of this is to be sought, from the Doctrine before delivered,
of Intermitting Fevers: to wit, that according as the Dyscrasie of the Blood,
diversely appears, the suppliment of the degenerate Nutritious Juice, arises to
the fullness of swelling up, either sooner or later; and for that reason, its
Effervency, causes now more frequent, now more rare fits in this Fever.

Concerning the Cure of Putrid Fevers, of every kind, there are four general
intentions, on which, the whole stress of the matter depends. First, that the
Blood, (if it may be done) may be defended from burning, and the flame, or fire
inkindled in its Sulphurous part, be wholly suppressed; which about the first
beginning of this Disease, happens to be often brought about. Secondly, that
when the Blood having taken fire, cannot be presently extinguished, that at
least it may perform its burning more mildly, and with lesser hurt. Thirdly,
the deflagration being ended, that the Liquor of the Blood, be freed from the
recrements of the adust and burnt matter, and afterward restored, to its
Natural temper and vigor. Fourthly, that the symptoms chiefly troubling may be
timely helped, the which, unless taken away, will frustrate the work both of
Nature and Medicine.

As to particular Remedies, with which these intentions may be served, there
are various prescriptions, and forms of Medicines, not only among Physicians,
but also among old women and Emperies, ordinarily in use: from which however,
like a Sword in a blind man's hand, used without difference, and exact method of
healing, more hurt than good, most often accrues to the sick. There will be no
need here to repeat the forms of Purges, Cordials, and of other Medicines,
eligantly enough delivered among many Authors: I will add in few words, some
chief indications, and Medical Cautions, which ought to be observed in the
course of this Fever, according to its various times, and diverse symptoms.

1. At the first beginning of this Disease, the business will be, that the
Fever may be presently suppressed; and the inflammation of the heated Sulphur,
may be inhibited: to which, the opening of a Vein does chiefly conduce; for by
this means, the Blood is eventilated, and the heated Particles, too much heaped
together, and almost ready to be fired, are dissipated one from another: as
when Hey, apt to burn, if exposed to the open Air, its firing is prevented.
Besides, let a slender diet be instituted, in which nothing Spirituous or
Sulphurous ought to be administered; The Viscera, and first passages should be
freed from the load of excrementitious matter; wherefore, Clysters are of
necessary use; sometimes also Vomits, and gentle Purges; by which, sometimes
timely and with judgment administered, the Fever presently after the beginning,
is extinguished, the Food of the fire being drawn away. If that notwithstanding
this method the burning spreads more abroad, and more and more, daily snatches
hold of the Sulphurous Particles of the Blood; it must be endeavored, (as
much as may be) that the deflagration proceed gently, without great tumult.

2, When the Fever is augmented, if the Blood be too hot, and distends the
Vessels very much, with a vehement and strong Pulse; if watchings, a Frenzy,
or a pain of the Head cruelly urge, the letting of Blood may be again repeated;
Transpiration (as much as may be) should be freely procured, wherefore, let the
sick keep in bed, for the most part; let the diet be sparing, of the most
slender Aliments, also drink small, and plentiful, that the burning Blood, may
be diluted with a more plentiful Serum: Clysters are administered safe enough,
and in truth commodiously; but Medicines, whether Cathartics, or Diaphoretics,
and which too much exagitate the Blood, are to be shunned, with the same
industry, as blasts of wind to burning houses: but rather Opiates, and Anodines
which fix and bind up the Blood, and Spirits, are to be made use of; also
Juleps, and Decoctions, which refrigerate the burning Viscera, attemper the
Blood, and cherish the Spirits, are often to be exhibited: acetous Liquors of
Vegetables, or Minerals, also putrified Nitre, because they restrain the rage
of the Blood, and extinguish Thirst, are truly convenient. Hot waters, and
Spirits, Cordial, and Bezoartic powders, (so long as the Disease is not
malignant) are not to be meddled with. If that the Blood be unequally
circulated, and is carried more toward the Head, than the Feet, Epithemas are
profitable, of the warm flesh, or Inwards of Animals, applied to the soles of
the Feet.

3. When the Fever is at its standing, the motion of Nature is diligently to
be attended, whether it will make a Crisis, or not; Wherefore, nothing rashly
is to be attempted by the Physician; the opening a Vein, or strong Purgation,
is wholly to be forbid; but after that the Feverish burning is somewhat
remitted, from the deflagration of the Blood, and signs of concoction appear in
the Urine, if that the motion of Nature be slow, a Sweat, or gentle Purge may
be admitted; which however are better, and safer done, by the Physician, when
Nature first, by a critical motion, has entered upon the seclusion of the
Morbific matter. If that all things are crude, and troubled, the Urine yet
turbid, without sediment, or separation of parts, if the strength be
languishing, the Pulse weak, if there be no Crisis going before, or only in
vain, any evacuation, either by Sweat or Purge, is not to be attempted, without
manifest danger of life: but it must be longer staid for, that the Spirits of
the Blood may recover themselves, may by some means overcome the
excrementitious and adust matter, and then by degrees may separate it, and put
it forth; in the mean time, the Spirits are to be cherished, with temperate
Cordials, the immoderate Effervency of the Blood (if it still be) is to be
stopped, and its due Fermentation sustained, which in truth is best performed,
by Corals, Pearls, and such kind of powders; which indeed are dissolved by the
Ferments of the Viscera, and then Ferment with the Blood, and greatly restore
its weak and wavering motion. In the mean time, (whilst Nature is laboring)
all obstacles, and impediments are to be removed, and especially the provision
of excrements, heaped up in the first passages, is to be brought away, by the
frequent use of Clysters.

4 By what way or method, the symptoms chiefly urging, ought to be handled,
will not be easily prescribed by certain Rules; because, they themselves
require sometimes to be presently appeased, and quieted, and sometimes to be
quickened forward: and what is something more, perhaps at another time, they are
to be left wholly to Nature. Some of these are too opposed, with gentle and
lenitive Remedies, but others with more sharp and irritative Physic: yet in the
mean time, it is a precept to be held in all, that you dilligently wait upon
the footsteps of Nature: which if it works wrongfully, its disorder is to be
reduced; if rightly, yet too vehemently, to be bridled: If she works rightly,
yet too slowly, or more weakly than she should, the business will be, that her
endeavor may be incited, and helped, by the help of Medicine.

5. In the declination of the Fever, when after a perfect Crisis, Nature is
stronger than the Disease, the business goes well, nor is there much business
left for a Physician: It only remains, to propose an exact manner of diet, that
the sick may soon recover strength, without fear of relapsing: also it is
requisite, to exterminate the Relics of the Feverish matter, with a light
Purgation. About Diet, they often fall on the Rock of relapsing, viz. by the
too hasty eating of flesh meats, or more strong Food, the sick relapse into the
Fever: for when the Viscera are weak, and the Aliments (unless very slender)
not easily digested, and when also the disposition of the Blood, is weaker,
that it does not assimilate the more strong nourishing Juice; if any thing
improportionate is brought to either, the regiment of Nature is again
perverted, and all goes ill. Wherefore, those growing well, should for a long
time refrain from flesh, and when at length they use it, it should not be
unless the Urine shall be like that of healthful people, and no more troubled
by the cold: and then indeed it will be safest, to begin with broths made of
flesh, and then by degrees, to proceed to more strong Aliments.

6. When from an imperfect Crisis, things are grown doubtful, and remain yet
undetermined; then is the Physicians most difficult task: The motions and
strength of Nature are carefully to be waited on, whether it begins to prevail
on the Disease, or to yield to it: If signs of concoction appear, and that
there is strength, a gentle evacuation, and only by leisure, is to be
celebrated. In the mean time, the symptoms most urging, are to be succored,
with convenient Remedies, all impediments to be taken away, and strength is to
be sustained (as much as may be) with Cordials, and a right manner of living or
diet.

7. When from an evil, or no Crisis, all things turn to the worse, and when the
Physician almost dispaires of Curing the Disease, he may predict its event
suspected, and much to be feared, But yet, he ought not to trust to a naked
Prognostication, to hinder all things else, but that as yet, what is in the
Medical Art, should be consulted for Health, tho desperate: Remedies may be
administered, to the symptoms most infesting; the Spirits of the Blood almost
extinct, may be restored by Cordials. When we despond of Health, life should be
prolonged as long as it may, and at least a fair exit procured.

According to the various types but now described, of a Putrid Fever, I might
readily add very many Histories of sick people, and particular observations,
made about their Cure; for these kind of examples are usually met with in our
daily practice, so that they are sufficient to fill a great Volumn; out of
these however, with the good leave of the honest Reader, I will briefly propose
some few, respecting the several kinds of the aforesaid Fever, by which their
Doctrine, and Method of healing them, above delivered, may be illustrated.

A Noble Matron, about fifty years of Age, of a slender habit of Body, little
stature, endued with a ruddy Complexion, when on the fifteenth day of June, by
reason of the Summers heat, she had put on more thin Garments, than she was
wont, felt herself ill in the Evening; from thence she was distempered with a
nauseousness, and oppression of her Stomach, she felt wandering pains, troubling
her now in her shoulders, now in her back, very thirsty, yet without any
immoderate heat: on the second, and third day, almost after the same manner, on
the fourth day after a Vomit, Viz. of the infusion of Crocus Metallorum one
Ounce given, she cast forth yellow bile four times, and had three Stools, and
seemed to be eased: the night following, she slept something better: but on the
next day, the Fever being thoroughly inkindled, she complained of thirst, a
burning of the Praecordia, and of a pain, now in her side, now in her back;
presently blood was taken to eight Ounces, her Urine was of a very deep red,
thick, and troubled without any Hypostasis, or settling of the Contents, her
Pulse unequal, and often intermitting, the following night without sleep: on
the sixth day of the Disease, early in the Morning, a small Sweat broke forth,
from whence the heat something abated, which in the Evening again grew stronger:
on the seventh day, a very acute heat, with thirst, burning, an inordinate and
intermitting Pulse, as also with a mighty restlessness, and tossing of the
whole Body troubled her, on the eighth the symptoms were somewhat more remiss,
also in the Urine, some marks of an Hypostasis; she took that day posset drink,
with Meadow-sweet boiled in it, and sweated plentifully; and was cured of her
Fever. All the time of her sickness, for Food they gave only small Beer, Posset
drink, Barley broth, or Grewel, also frequently Clysters; Drink, and a cooling
Julep, they gave her at her pleasure.

This Noble Lady, through transpiration being hindered, fell into a Putrid
Synochus: the Effluvia, wont to be evaporated through the skin, being retained
within, (together with the Choler flowing out of the Choleric Vessels) and
fixed to the Viscera, did overthrow the dispositions of their parts, and
especially gave trouble to the Stomach, and raised up pains and Convulsions, in
the parts filled with Muscles and Membranes: the Pulse was unequal, and
intermitting, not because of the malignity of the Disease, as in the Plague,
but by reason a certain proper disposition of the Heart, by which indeed, its
ferment being not well constituted, the Blood growing fervent, is not presently
equally inkindled, and wholly leaps forth, but a part of the Blood, in flowing
in a small, then a greater, and after some turns the graatest proportion,
stoping for a moment of time, in the Bosoms of the Heart, produces the unequal
and intermitting Pulse. I have known in many others, clearly, the like
distemper of the Pulse: to wit, so long as they were free from intemperance,
the Pulse was altogether equal, and orderly, but if they were more strongly
heated than usually, by any sudden passion of the mind, or too great agitation
of the Body, presently they were affected with an unequal Pulse, and between
the vibrations or strikings, intermitting perhaps 4, 7, 10, or 20. and as often
as they fell into a Fever, the Pulse showed it self after this irregular
manner. When this habitual irregularity, concerning the Pulse, was not yet made
known to me, by frequent experience, I was wont to suspect still a malignity in
the Disease, and to foretell a fatal event, which happened otherwise.

On the fifth day, in this sick person, the Fever, although slowly inkindled,
came to an augmentation, and from thence past through the rest of the stations
with a swift motion: on the sixth a light emptying of the adust matter, arising
to a fullness, a sweat being risen, and so a certain remission of the Feverish
heat followed: on the seventh day, this adust matter arising to its height of
increase, made the standing of the Disease, to which, at length on the eighth
day, a plentiful sweat, with all things requisite to a good Crisis, followed,
and perfectly Cured the Fever: because (as it ought to be) those three things
went before this critical evacuation, viz. first a full and sufficient
deflagration of the Blood, as appeared by the very strong heat, and plainly
fiery, continued for three days before: also secondly, a congestion of the
adust matter to a plenitude, as was collected by the high disquiet, and tossing
about the preceding and then a certain Pepasmus or Concoction of the same
matter, and a begun secretion in the Blood, which a ceasing of the symptoms and
signs of Concoction in the Urine, showed: wherefore, the Copious sweat, coming
upon so laudable a sign, so long as there was no suspicion of malignity,
portended nothing but good.

About the beginning of the year 1656, a Gentleman endued with an active habit
of Body, without any manifest cause, (unless that being much addicted to study,
he used no exercise after it) became ill; at first he complained, of a
nauseousness and want of Appetite, with a great Headache: on the second day, he
was affected, now with a shivering, now with heat, several times reciprocating,
besides, with thirst, and burning of the Praecordia, with a scurfieness of the
Tongue, and an ungrateful savor. On that day, he took ten drams of an Emetick
Liquor, by which he Vomited seven times, and cast up a great quantity of yellow
bile, and had four Stools; the night following he was unquiet, and almost
wholly without sleep, and in which the sick person grew more Feverish, with an
increased heat: on the third day, when the aforesaid symptoms were grown worse,
he was let Blood to ten Ounces: his Urine was red, thick, and with a copious
sediment; his Pulse quick, and vehement; at night he sweat a little, with a
short sleep, but disturbed: on the following morning, he seemed to be a little
eased: yet in the evening all things grew worse, with most strong wakings,
heat, and thirst: on the fifth day, by a light sweat, the heat somewhat
remitted, which yet a little before the evening, returned with its wonted
fierceness, The night again was wholly without sleep, with a continual tossing
up and down of his Body: In the morning, by a little gentle sweating, he felt a
little ease; in the evening an increase again of all things more cruelly; the
night also was very unquiet: about the beginning of the next day, a sweat, as
before succeeded, and a little more plentifully: on this day was a manifest
change toward health; the heat and thirst was a little less vehement; his
Urine was less red, with some Hypostasis; thence, for three days, the Fever
leisurly declined; yet every night he had a certain fit, but more remiss than
before on the eleventh day, he sweated more plentifully, and was perfectly
Cured: all the time of his sickness, he used a most spare diet, taking truly
nothing of Aliment, besides small Beer, and Posset drink made of it; he
sometimes took drink, and cooling Juleps, of boiled Barley, and distilled waters;
daily, if his Belly was not loose of it self, an emollient Clyster was
administered: he used no other Physic besides, to wit, neither Purge nor
Cordial. But the Fever being allayed, he was twice Purged, and from thence
quickly grew well.

This Fever was a Putrid Synochus, as may be conjectured by the shivering
about the beginning, and then with continual heat, thirst, watchings, and other
symptoms grieviously infesting, for many days: but forasmuch, as its
intemperature was exasperated every night, it might be called a continued
Quotidian: This Disease, made its first assault without any evident cause,
because the Blood being little ventilated, like Wine growing hot of it self,
had conceived an ardour, from the exalted Sulphur; the Choler flowing forth
from the Choleduct Vessels, and likewise the Purgings of the raging Blood,
being poured about inwardly, (as it is wont to do for the most part in Fevers)
presently stirred up troubles, and disorders in the first passages: therefore
by reason of the excrementitious matter there heaped up, there was procured a
depletion, and soon after the beginning, a Vomiting: notwithstanding which
evacuation, and likewise a more strong Purging of the Belly by Stool, if
administered, the Fever being wholly inkindled, because they too much agitate
the Blood, and disturb greatly the Concoction of the adust Feverish matter,
for that reason bring more damage for the most part than benefit to the sick:
The first station of this Disease, viz, until the whole Blood was fired, was
extended to the third day; and then from thence, when the Blood flaming forth
was burdened with adust recrements, its greater ebullition, with a frequent
endeavor of expulsion by sweat followed: on the seventh day, when the Blood
for the greatest part had flamed forth, and the adust recrements, heaped up in
its bosom to a fullness of swelling up, began to be troublesome, the critical
motion was stirred up: by which nevertheless, that matter not being as yet
wholly subdued, nor ready for separation, the Disease was not perfectly Cured;
but after another period, the same increasing, at last being stirred up, on the
eleventh day, brought on that other, and perfectly Curing swelling up: in the
days between, because, besides the recrements remaining after the deflagration
of the Blood, and reserved for a Crisis, also from the Nutritious Juice not
presently taking fire, but after a peculiar manner depraved, other matter in
the bosom of the Blood, apt to a swelling up, was gathered together; therefore,
from the continual increase, and Flux of this, there happened to this Fever
continual fits, (such as are wont in Intermitting Fevers) on set days, and
hours. (...) suffocating Catarrh: For this kind of distemper (as also the Cough
with great spitting) arises not, for that the watery humor (as is commonly
said) falls from the head, into the throat, and lungs; but because the serous
Latex is poured forth, now from the pneumonic vessels, immediately into the
lungs, now dropping forth from the Arteries opening into the larynx, falls down
on the breast; on the third day, from the same serous humor, with a portion of
the Blood, being fixed in the side, the acute pain arose; for the Blood
beginning to grow fervent, when as yet it did contain in it self a crude
matter, and (as it should seem) something sour, from the degenerate alible
juice, deposed the same, (because it could not cast it forth of doors by sweat)
by a proper lustration or purging through the intercostal Arteries, into the
membrane surrounding the Ribs; and there (as it is always wont in a Plurisie)
either by coagulation, (which may be lawfully suspected) or by the shutting up
of the vessels, the Blood being entangled with the same matter, is stopped in
its motion; then being increased in its bulk, by a new coming still of the
Blood, it causes a break of the union, and so an acute pain. That in this sick
woman, the same kind of matter, disturbing the mass of Blood, with a portion of
it extravasated, was fixed about the Pleura, it from thence happened, because the
pain urging, the urine was clear, and not full of contents: then, when the
vessels, by reason of Phlebotomie, being emptied, they supped up again that
matter, into its mass, before exterminated from the Blood, the urine presently
became troubled, and again big with contents: The pulse was unequal, and
intermitting, because of the idiocrasie or proper disposition, which she was
wont to have in every intemperature: for when I cured this woman of a Fever,
many years before, her pulse being unequal, and intermitting, had struck a fear
in me, and others, of a sad presage, concerning the event of the disease, which
however at that time, (as also in this sickness) ceased, prosperously, without
any horrid Symptom.

A strong young man, and corpulent, after immoderate exercise, about the Summer
solstice, and then a sudden cold coming upon the heat, found himself ill: At
first, a want of Appetite, nauseousness, and cruel pain of the head, as also
thirst, and a more intense heat than usual troubled him; on the second day, an
acute pain invaded him ^n his right side with a Cough, and difficult breathing;
Blood being presently taken plentifully from the Arm of the same side, that
pain remitted somewhat, which yet in the evening returned, being made more cruel
by a Cough, and bloody spittle. The night followed, without sleep, and very
unquiet: on the third day, he was again let blood, besides Liniments, and
fomentations were applied to his side; Moreover pouders, Juleps, and
antipleuretick decoctions, being taken inwardly, about night the pain almost
wholly ceased. Then by and by, he was afflicted with a cruel headache, and a
vertigo: on the fourth day, a stream of Blood fell from his right nostril,
about two ounces, by which the pain of his head clearly ceased, and the
vertigo; but in the Evening, the pain in the side before distempered, returned
with greater fierceness: In the mean time his Pulse was small, and weak, that
when it was consulted upon, for the letting him blood again, 'twas thought
dangerous, lest his dejected strength would not admit of such a remedy:
wherefore, Phlebotomie was performed only, in a very small quantity, and a
fomentation, and a Cataplasme was prescribed to be diligently applied to his
side; besides twenty drops of the spirit of Hartshorn, to be taken in a
spoonful of Cordial Julep, and the same to be repeated continually, within the
space of six hours: He sweat that night very much, and the pain much remitted,
his spitting was but little, interspersed with Blood, which, within a day
wholly ceased, and the pain also leisurely vanished. The sick man took twice a
day, a scruple of the same spirit of Hartshorn, and within a few days, he grew
perfectly well, without relapsing.

This Fever was a simple Synochus, stirred up from the evident cause, viz. a
Constriction of the pores: as soon as the Blood began to be somewhat filled with
adust recrements, and so to swell up more, the matter, which should have been
separated, by reason of its peculiar evil, was transferred into the Pleura, and
being there fixed, compelled the Blood coming to it, to be coagulated, and
therefore to be stopped in its circulation, and (when it could not be received
by the veins) presently to be extravasated: from hence happened the acute pain in
the side, and bloody spittle, by and by, after the beginning of this Disease;
then afterward, the same matter being thrust out of that nest, which it had
got, and being supped up again into the mass of Blood, was fixed in the head;
and there inducing the like stagnation of the Blood, and (as it is probable)
coagulation, caused the vertigo, and cruel pain; which nevertheless was quickly
cured, by the hemorrhage being arisen, by reason of the extravasated Blood. A
part of the morbific matter, being after this manner drawn away, the other part
resumed by the Blood, was again conveyed to its usual nest, to wit, the side
before distempered; where depositing its latex, (to wit, a portion of the
Blood) it did coagulate it again, and compelled it to be extravasated or to
flow out of the vessels: For that pain being renewed on the fourth day, with
the bloody spittle, from the ebullition of the Blood, too extremely, and
therefore flowing out of the vessels, would not be brought away; because at
that time, the Pulse was small and weak, with a falling down of the vessels,
that indeed the Blood was thought to have been run all out of the vessels, for
that being coagulated by the morbific matter, (and therefore tho expulsed the
Arteries, yet not being able to be carried back by the veins) it was stopped in
its circulation. Upon this, an acute pain followed, because the Blood being
heaped together by its frequent approach, and elevated into a Tumor, made a
dissolution of the union; also, by and by from the beginning, a bloody spittle
came upon it, because the Blood being restrained within, in the Body, somwhere
in its motion, by reason of the most tender, and easily opening little mouths
of the vessels, ran forth into the Cavities; when to the same outwardly
extravasated, by reason of a more thick skin, and the mouths of the little
vessels being locked up, no way lay open, unless by its being made and ripened
into an Imposthume. The opening of a vein profited in the beginning of the
Pleurisy, because it restrained the Blood, somwhere hindered in its circuit,
from too great effervency; but especially, for that, when the vessels were by
that means greatly emptied, they did again receive, and render fluent,
whatsoever humors were before exterminated, and also the Blood beginning to
stagnate in the distempered part. Also, the remedies helping most, about the
beginning of this Disease, were of that sort, which hinder the coagulation of
the Blood, or dissolve it in the coagulating; such they are, which abound very
much with a volatile, or an alchalisate Salt: to wit, spirit of Soot, of Blood,
Hartshorn, also spirit and salt of Urine, the powder of the claws and eyes of
Crabs, of a Boars tooth, or the Jaw of a Pike, are of known use. Among the
common people, it is a custom to drink an infusion of Horse dung; which
medicine indeed, I have known often to have brought help, in deplorable cases.
In the mean time, all acid things whatsoever, because they more coagulate the
Blood, and hinder expectoration, are highly hurtful in this Disease.

CHAP. XII. Of a malignant or pestilential Fever in general.
BEsides the continual Fever, which is already-described, and which arises
from some principle of the Blood being too much carried forth, there is another
species of this, which is stirred up, by reason of the Blood being touched with
some invenomed Infection, and therefore liable to enter into various
coagulations, and corruptions: In which, not only the Spirit and the Sulphur,
as in a Putrid Fever, rage, and compel the Blood to grow immoderately hot, but
besides, the mixture of the Blood is presently dissolved, and its liquor goes
into parts; and so most horrid Symptoms, with manifest danger of life, are
induced in this sort of distemper. Under this rank, we comprehend malignant,
and pestilential Fevers, the Plague, Smallpox, and Measles: of which we shall
speak presently.

Pestilential Diseases, wander so in the dark, and have an unknown original,
that their causes, and beings are seldom explicated, without having a recourse
to occult qualities. By the unanimous consent of all, the strength, and power
of these are placed in an invenomed matter; because we perceive, from a
pestilent distemper, strength suddenly to be overthrown, and life quickly
destroyed, no otherwise than from the dri^king of Poison. And therefore, for
the explicating the nature of the pestilence, it will not be besides the
matter, first, to inquire concerning Poison in general, and by what means it
distempers our Bodies, then to show what sort of Poison is sprinkled in the
Plague, and contagious Diseases: which being performed, we will treat
particularly of the Diseases but now recited.

Every thing deserves the name of Poison, which striking into our Body, after
an occult manner vehemently hurts the temper, and actions of any part, or of
the whole, profligates the Spirits, or perverts their motions, solves the
mixtures of the Liquors, and induces Coagulations and Corruptions, destroys the
functions and ferments of the Viscera, and so suddenly and hiddenly brings life
into danger, of these, which after this manner lie in wait for us, there is a
mighty plenty, and very rich provision in the nature of things: oftentimes they
are inly begotten within our body; outwardly they are abundantly supplied from
every Coast, and out of every tract of Earth, water and air, these daily arise
out of the distinct families of minerals, vegetables, and Animals, and so
mingle themselves with our food, yea with our medicine, that we may complain
with Pliny, quod non sit fateri, an rerum natura largius mala, an remedia
genuerit. That it was not known, whether Nature had begot greater Evils, or
Remedies.

As there is great varieties of Poisons, so, as to their Subjects, and ways of
hurting, there is no less diversity of them: for the most Poisons, in their
whole substance are said to be contrary to us, that whatsoever they come to,
with a burning force, and like fierce fire, they reduce into ashes, yet out of
these, some being noted for a peculiar raising of hurt, do more endammage one
part or substance than another. The subjects, on which the taint of Poison, is
next and more immediately inflicted, are twofold; to wit, the animal Spirits, or
the spirituous subtle Liquor flowing in the Brain, and nervous stock; and the
Blood flowing in the Vessels, and heart, when the object is carried only to
one, or being improportionate, at one to either, that from thence, the
disposition of the Liquors, or of the containing parts, is overthrown, whereby
the necessary functions, for the performing of life and sense, are restrained,
and this done latently, and as it were unforeseen, these kind of distempers, we
ascribe to Poison.

The nervous bodies, with the animal Spirit, are not invaded wholly after the
same manner, by every sort of Poisons; for they are tormented, now with a
Stupor, now with Convulsions, and those of diverse kinds, and manners: The bile
of a Tarantula causes dancing: A power sent from the Torpedo, by the Angle, or
lines of the Net, stupifies the hand of the Fisher. The roots of the wild
Parsnip, or the seeds of Lolium or Darnel, being eaten, make men mad: Opium,
Mandrakes, Henbane, and the like, cause deep, and sometimes deadly sleep. These
and many others, chiefly impress their Poison, on the spirituous or animal
faculty, without any great perturbation of the Blood, or hurt brought to the
heart.

There are also some Poisons, which most of all insinuate their malignity, to
the mass of Blood; wherefore, from some Medicines, there have been produced, a
yellow or black Jaundice, sometimes a Leprosy, or leprous distempers, and
swellings of the whole body, vapors breaking forth from secret hollows of the
Earth, also from Coals newly inkindled, often suffocating the vital Spirits, at
once congeal the Blood, and stop it in its motion, whereby the flame of life in
the heart, could not be continued. How much corruption of the mass of Blood is
imparted from the pestilent Infection, is perspicuous to every one, from the
spots and Whelks, which are as it were the marks of the blasted Blood.

If the hurt, being first inflicted to either, viz. The regiment of the Heart,
or Brain, be more lightly made, it is for the most part cured, without any
great offense to either; wherefore, Convulsive motions, Stupifaction,
Lethargy, Melancholy, Paralytick distempers, do not seldom begin with a
laudable Pulse, and without an immoderate effervescency of the Blood; and then,
if the distemper does not get strength, leisurely end, and cease. There are
other Poisons, which often deprave the Blood, and by dissolving its mixture,
corrupt it, in the mean time the animal functions remain whole enough. But if
the ferment of the Poison be stronger, and has more deeply fixed its roots,
presently the Poison is dispersed, from one Province to the other: for when the
nervous parts swell up, with a virulent juice, a portion of the Poison, is
carried with the nervous Latex returning through the Lymphatick Vessels, into
the veins, easily into the bosom of the Blood, and infects its mass, with the
evil with which it was big: also, from the Blood being grievously impoysoned,
the juice, by which the nerves are watered, quickly contract the infection;
hence mad men are in a Fever, and those taken with a pestilent Fever, are
most often tormented with a Delirium, or Frenzy. Concerning these things, we
must consider, what the alteration is, or the impression of hurt, which is
inflicted from the Poison, to the animal Spirit, with the brain and nervous
appendex; and what also, to the Blood, with the Heart, and the annexed Vessels:
tho here, it is not in the power of humane skill or wit, plainly to show, or as
it were point out with the finger the manner of its being done; yet we may be
able to attain to some little knowledge of this thing, by reasoning, and by
comparing it, with other distempers.

Concerning the former, we shall observe, that the subtle Liquor, or animal
Spirits, wherewith the Nervous Bodies are blown up, and by whose expansion,
sense and motion perform their reciprocal actions, are easily perverted from
their tensity, and equal expansion: for as the Nerves are of a soft texture,
and the Spirits which abound in them of a very subtle substance, they cannot
endure any strong or vehement objects; wherefore when any violent or
improportionate thing falls on them, they are often compelled from their
expansion, and excursion into flight, and a running backward, and not seldom
into irregularities of motions: wherefore sudden passions of the mind distract
them, and drive them into Spasms, and Convulsions; when the Alible Juice, by
which they are repaired, is supplied too sharp, sour or austere, they suffer
now Palsies, and now contractures: If that some object more incongruous, (such
as we have affirmed Poison to be) should be offered, whose Particles are endued
with such fierceness, or are of such a kind of configuration, that when they
grow impetuously hot with the Nervous Liquor, they shake or lose here and there
its more subtle or spirituous part, or wholly drive it away, and fix the
remaining Liquor either with a styptic force, or by ebullition, force it into
inordinate motions; hence of necessity, evil distempers of the Brain, and
Nervous parts arise, viz. sometimes a Convulsion, Trembling, Shivering, sometimes
loosnings, or a stupefaction, and other symptoms of more grievous note. What
things after this manner infect the Nervous Juice with Poison, are now more
thick, and only when they are applied in a very Corporeal substance, do inflict
their hurt; now they are thin, and being resolved, even into a vapor or
breath, pour forth from a certain little prick, the ferment of Poison, through
the whole Nervous stock. Sometimes the Poison of some hurtful thing, being
eaten, first begins its Tragedy in the Ventricle; more often by a naked touch,
leaves on the superficies of the Body, a virulent taint, which easily and
quickly with its ferment, contaminates the Spirits, dispersed through the
whole. The Infection, wherever inflicted, either within or without, is more
largely dispersed from the extremities of the Nerves, by their easy passage,
being from thence brought into consent of the evil, by the very many little
shoots of the same branch. Often a more light touch of an invenomed thing, by
the finger, or extremity of any other member, presently communicates to the
Brain, the received infection, and from thence it is retorted into the whole
Body, and the farthest members; the reason of this is, that both the Particles
of the Nervous Juice, and of the same invenomed infection, are so light, and
ready for motion, that they pass through most swiftly, as the Rays of light
through a Diaphanous medium, the whole mass of one another.

2. As often as the Blood contracts hurt from some Poisonous thing, the Poison
is fixed within; either slow, and of lesser activity, which does not presently
betray it self, nor break forth into cruel symptoms, till of a long time after,
it is ripened by a silent fermentation, and has first infected the whole mass
of Blood, as may be observed in some Poisons, which are said to kill at a
distance, and not till after some months, or years. Or the Poisons inspired
into the Blood, are imbued with a much more acute sting, that from their
Contagion, the Infection contracted, presently breaks forth into cruel
symptoms, and thereupon follows now a Feverish effervency with Vomiting,
Thirst, and burning of the Precordia, now a swelling up of the whole Body, a
discoloration of the skin, oftentimes a breaking forth of whelks, and buboes,
and frequently also a sudden loss of all strength, so that sudden death,
without tumult, and almost insensibly steals upon one: where by the way it is
to be noted, If the Spirits of the Blood, provoked by the enemy, are able to
encounter him, and to strive for the victory, this Feverish ebullition of the
Blood is stirred up from the conflict; but if the Particles of the Poison,
being far stronger, suddenly profligate the Spirits of the Blood, and
extinguish life, presently the Bloody mass is corrupted, neither can it be
circulated in the Vessels, nor rightly inkindled in the heart.

If it be yet demanded, what mutations, the Blood infected with Poison,
undergoes, either in its substance, or consistency, that, for that reason it is
rendered unfit for the sustaining of Life? I answer after this manner; some
Poisons fuse the Blood, and too much precipitate its serosity, such are
Medicines, which by a strong killing Purging, or by a Profluvium of Urine, or a
discoloration, or swelling up of the whole Body, or with an eruption of
Pustules, cause a very great secretion of the serous Latex; in the mean time a
great ebullition of the mass of Blood is induced, whereby the Vital Spirits are
greatly destroyed, the Particles of Salt and Sulphur too much exalted, by the
Concoction, and are often so roasted, that a Yellow or Black Jaundies is caused.

There are Poisons of another kind, far more dangerous, which congeal the
Blood, and by destroying its mixture, corrupt it, viz. the first induce a
congelation to the Bloody mass, and then a Putrefaction: for when the Spirits
of the Blood, being overthrown, by the contagion of the Poison, are dissipated,
the equal mixture of the Liquor is loosned; wherefore the more thick Particles
mutually infold one another, and (like Milk when Rennet is put to it, or
growing sour of it self) are coagulated apart: hence the Blood curdles in the
Vessels, that it is less readily circulated in them: coagulated portions of
this, being inwardly diluted, into the bosom of the Heart, are apt to stagnate
there, and so to bring forth frequent syncopes, and swounings: being carried
outwardly, and in the circulating, fixed in the skin, sometimes being more
plentifully heaped together, they induce a suffusion of blackness through the
whole, sometimes being more sparingly dispersed, they cause only spots, or
Purple marks, like black and blew strokes, and other appearances of malignity.
But the coagulation of the Blood, quickly disposes it to putrefaction or
corruption; as is seen in extravasated Blood, which is wont to grow soon black
and putrid. For the Spirit being exhaled, the Particles of Sulphur and Salt
remaining in the Blood, begin to go apart one from another, and to break the
bond of the mixture, from whence follows Putrefaction.

These things being thus premised of Poison in general, the reason of the
method requires that we enter upon the handling of Fevers, which draw their
Original, altogether from a malignant, and invenomed infection: and as under
this title, the Pest or Plague easily obtains the chief place, I will begin
with its consideration, and afterward, I will speak of malignant Fevers,
Smallpox, and Measels, in order. But yet, before I shall propose its
definition, I will briefly inquire, of the pestiferous Poison, what its
disposition and Nature may be; also, from whence it may be born, and lastly, by
what means it is propagated into others, by contagion.

For the expressing the Nature of the Plague, Authors are wont to choose some
invenomed Bodies, and from their names to frame an Elogy of this most wicked
Disease; wherefore in the definition of the pest, are commonly recounted the
Nepelline, Aconital, and Arsenical Poison: the Lethiferous force of which
however, as it consists in a very thick matter, and does not exert or put forth
itself but by a Corporal contact, does not truly imitate the essence of the
Pestilential Disease: for this is founded in a Spiritual and Vaporous
infection, by which its Effluvia being every way diffused, so potently unfold
themselves, that out of the best seminary or seed plot, they quickly propagate
a fruitful Crop of death and destruction, By reason of its notable activity,
this infection may deserve to be called, as it were a certain quintessence of
Poison; the very agil and subtle Particles of this, do penetrate all Bodies,
and inspire them with its ferment: for either being dispersed through the Air,
or hid in a certain tender or cherishing nest, tho they strike against the
human Body but lightly, and as it were through a Casement, they easily subdue
it; for both the Animal Spirits, and those of the blood, they quickly infect,
and by that means, shortly pour forth the Venomous taint, into all the members.

When a Pestilential Breath or Vapor, has invaded any one, and that Poison
has first laid hold on the Animal Spirits, or those of the Blood, or both of
them at once, (as has been already said of Poisons) the taint is quickly
derived from the subtle and more thin substance of these, into a more thick
matter: because it quickly ferments the whole mass of Blood, or of the Nervous
Juice, and the excrementitious humors, every where abounding, and from thence
is deduced into the solid parts, and fixes the evil in them. If this Disease,
first possesses the Animal Spirits, presently the hurt is communicated to the
Brain, and the Nervous stock, and especially to the Ventricle, forthwith it
impoysons the humor growing in these; loosens its mixture, perverts the
regular motion, and renderr it wholly incongruous, and infestous to the more
tender substance of the containing parts: by and by from thence, Cramps and
Convulsive motions, cruel Vomitings, pains of the Heart, also Phrensies,
deliriums, or pertinacious watchings, are stirred up, about the first assault
of the Disease: when in the mean time, the infection not being yet dispersed
through the Blood, the sick are not Feverish, nor are troubled with inordinate
Pulse, or Syncope, or appearances of marks; which symptoms however arise
afterward, as soon as the Blood is infected. If when the Spirits of the Blood
are first possessed, with the impoysoned infection, either drawn in with the
Air, or attracted through the pores, its ferment is presently dissipated
through the whole mass of the Blood, the infested portions immediately begin to
be loosned from their equal mixture, to go into parts, and to be coagulated,
and the same, being delated, into the bosom of the Heart, are wont there to
stagnate, and so to induce a Syncopy, Swoonings, and often sudden Death; also
being carried outwardly, fixed about the skin, to cause Buboes, inflamed
risings, and other marks of Poison; in the mean time, the sick appear well in
mind, nor are they troubled with Delirium nor Convulsive motions. If that from
a more strong cause, the hurt is inflicted to both parts at once, the course of
the Disease is performed with a more horrid provision of symptoms, and
especially with a Syncopy, and Frenzy at once infesting.

As to what appertains to its rise; when the Plague first arises in any Region
or Country, there is attributed a twofold cause of it, viz. Primary or
Metaphysical, also Secondary or Natural, subordinate to that: The very Heathens
did acknowledge this Disease, wherever it raged, sent first of all from God, for
the castigation of the wickednesses of men, and therefore for its extirpation,
they equally made use of Prayers and Sacrifices as of Medicines. As to what
belongs to the Natutal cause, there are diverse opinions. Some will, that the
Pestilence newly arisen, be derived from the Heavens, and influences of the
Stars only: on the contrary, others have affirmed it only to arise from the
internal putrefaction of the humors of our Body: but these endeavor to deduce
the cause of this sickness too far off, and these more near than it ought. We
will walk in the middle way, and what Reason persuades, and what very many
Authors assert, we will place the chief and first seminary or seed plot of this
Poison, in the Air; because, it seems consonant to Reason, that from the same
Fountain, from which the common food of life is had, the beginnings of death,
no less diffusive, are to be sought. There is the same necessity for our
breathing in the Air, as of Fishes living in the Water; wherefore, as to waters
infected by Poison, the murrain of Fishes dying in heaps is ascribed; so men
dying of an Epidemical slaughter, without any manifest cause, nothing could
kill, besides the infection of the commonly inspired Air.

For the Air, which we necessarily draw in for the continuance of Life,
consists of an heap of vapors and fumes, which are perpetually breathed forth
from the Earth; in which the exhalations of Salt and Sulphur, being mingled
with the atomical vaporous little Bodies, constitute here as it were a thick
cloud: the motions of these are swift and unquiet, they are of a manifold
figure, and very much diverse, wherefore some continually meet against others,
and according to their various configurations, they cohere with these, and are
mutually combined one with another, and from those they are driven, and fly
away: from hence the reasons of the Sympathy and Antipathy of every thing,
depend. From the diverse agitations of these kind of Atoms, near the
superficies of the Earth, this or that tract of the Air, enters into diverse
alterations, by which, Bodies, chiefly the living are variously affected:
because the intestine motion, of the Particles of every Animal, depends very
much upon the motion and temper of the Particles of the Air: forasmuch as these
perpetually exagitate those, raise up those lying asleep, repair the loss of
those flying away, shake the vital flame with their Nitrosity, and supply it
with a Nitrous-Sulphureous Food, eventilates it being inkindled by continual
turns of access and recess, and carry away the Soot and Fumes. So long as an
apt contemperation happens in either, for motion and configuration, living
Creatures enjoy perfect health and life; but if the little Bodies swiming in
the Air, be of that sort of figure and power, that are plainly adverse to the
Spirits implanted in living Creatures, they loose the mixtures of these, from
the rest, from whose Elements they are collected, and pervert their motions;
hence the dispositions of things are destroyed, life profligated, and, the same
being scarce extinct, the Bodies undergo putrefaction; hence the tops of
Trees, or of Corn, being struck with a blast, suddenly grow dry or wither;
hence among Cattle, the murrain often rages, which kills at once whole Flocks;
by reason of this kind of cause, the Seeds of the Pestilence first put
themselves forth, and attempt the slaughter of human kind: for as invenomed
Bodies in the bowels of the Earth or concreted on its superficies, produce the
Arsenical or Aconital mixtures, so these being even resolved into vapor, and
heaped together in the Air, create most pernicious Airs, from which Malignant
and Pestilential Diseases arise; the infection, which after this manner
Contaminates the Air, the most ingenious Diemerbrochius, a searcher of this
Disease, contends, that is only sent (as the wrath of angry Apollo) immediately
from the angry right hand of God: but this were to multiply without any pretext
of necessity (I will not say beings but) miracles, and in every Plague to
assert a Creation of new substance; when in the mean time, the virulent product
of Minerals and Vegitable, which daily appear, and of as quite adverse Nature
to us, as the Plague, clearly testify, that there lives hid in the Bowels of
the Earth, plenty of invenomed matter, sufficiently fitted for this business.
For the little Bodies, which being roled about with earthy matter, do constitute
the Poisonous mixtures in the bosom of the Earth, the same being resolved into
vapors, will be no less hurtful afterward, and impress a pestiferous blast to
the Air, which they wander through: wherefore, by the leave of so Learned a
man, I should say, that it seems not improbable, that the things which first of
all affix the seed plot of the Pestilence, to any tract of Air, be the
Poisonous Effluvia of fierce Salts and Sulphurs, and (by the Divine Will
instigating) breathing forth from the bowels of the Earth; which sometimes,
being a long time before shut up, are leisurely exhaled out of Dens and
Caverns; sometimes by reason of the motion of the Earth, or Earthquake, or a
gaping of the Earth, they break forth in heaps; also, of the same kind, are
those which ordinarily are breathed forth from the filth of Soldiers in their
nasty Camps; or from unburied Carcases; or from places, beset with standing and
stinking Mud: but the little Bodies after this manner exhaled, obtain their
wonderful height, properties, and abilities, by a long putrefaction, that
therefore they are incongruous, and heterogeneous to all others whatsoever, and
so being received into the Air, ferment it (as it were a mass of Liquor) and
pervert it from a wholesome and benign, into a most pernicious and wicked Nature.

Some Bodies more easily, others not so readily receive the malignant tincture
of the Pestilent Air. Those who by reason of ill feeding are full of evil
humors, and who by reason of fullness, have their Blood stuffed with firable
Sulphur, receive the Pestilential Poison, by the lest blast of the invenomed
Air, especially if fear or sadness happen, which convey inwardly, and lead to
the Heart, as it were by a certain attraction the most light darts of the
contagion. On the contrary, those who have their Viscera clean, and the mass of
Blood well tempered, and are endued with a strong, and fearless mind, do not so
easily receive this infection, and sometimes exterminate it soon, being received.

Thus much for the beginning and divulgation of the Pestilence, according to
its first Fountains, and from thence the stream of the infected Air being
deduced: it remains for us to speak concerning its propagation by contagion,
forasmuch as it is derived, as it were extraduce from some and so to others.

We understand by Contagion, that force or action, by which any distemper
residing in one Body, excites its like in another. But as this may happen,
either immediately by contact, as when any one lying in the same bed with
another, taken with the Plague, or mediately, and at a distance, as when it
happens that the infection is transferred from one house to others remote, or
also if the Plague come upon any one, after many days or months, perhaps years
handling a Garment, or household stuff, brought from an infected house:
therefore that the Nature of the Contagion, and its diverse modes may be
plainly made known, we will first weigh what that is, which streams from an
infected Body. Secondly, how it bears it self through the Medium of its
passage. Thirdly, by what means it begets a distemper like it self, in another
Body.

1. That from every Body, although of a more fixed Nature, Effluvia of Atoms
constantly fly away, and run forth, which round about constitute as it were a
Cloud or Halos, and as it were cloth it, like the down of a Peach, is so much
received among the more sound Philosophers, that nothing can be more. But by
how much the more any thing consists of active Particles, by so much the more,
it sends from it self, little Bodies of more remarkable virtue and energy.
Hence the Effluvia which fall from Ambers, are able to move other Bodies from
their place: emanations proceed from Sulphurous things, which fill the whole
neighborhood with odors. And so when the Pestilential venom, as has been
already said, is from hence any where fixed, and tho in the smallest bulk, is
of great efficacy and operation, there is a necessity, that some emanations,
proceed from the Bodies imbued with it, which refer the nature or disposition
of the same Poison and malignity, and diffuse them on every side according to
its sphere of activity. But when these little Bodies, which retain the
contagion of the Pestilence, as they stream from one Body, are not presently
received by another, we shall inquire, how they carry themselves, in respect of
their passage, through the medium.

Where we shall presently meet with a difference in those, from many others,
for that the Effluvia, which ordinarily evaporate, do not long retain the
Nature or Disposition of the Body, from which they flow, but either vanish into
Air, or being impacted to other Bodies, are assimilated to them: but those
Particles, which fall from a Pestilential Infection, are not easily supped up
by the Air, or any other Body, so as they may be wholly destroyed; but among
the various confusions of Atoms, and the dashings of other Bodies, they keep
themselves untouched, For this untamed Poison remains still the same almost,
and not to be overcome by others, and tho it consists of never so little heap
of Atoms, will not presently vanish; but with its ferment, imbues the next
little Bodies, and so acquires new forces, and gains strength by going; from
whence it lurks a long while in some nest, and after a long time, when it
assaults a convenient subject, puts forth it self, and imparting the taint of
its Poison to another, raises up again the Disease of the Pestilence anew,
which seemed before to be exploded, and tho from the smallest seminary,
sprinkles far and near its deadly Poison.

For the Pest, brings forth such most sure signs of its contagion, that some
Authors contend, that for this reason it only continues among Mortals, and does
never spring up anew, but is only conserved from its nest, and carried from
thence, from one Region to another. Histories relate, that the seeds of this
have lain asleep for several years, in some Garment or Bedcloaths, and that
afterward, they being stirred, it has appeared, and has stirred up anew the
Disease of the Pestilence, increasing with a mighty slaughter of men. When by
reason of the tinder, or cherishing nest, the Plague is propagated after this
manner, at a distance, the invenomed little Bodies, which remain in the
infection, being moved, presently leap out, and unfold its Poison every way, as
it were by a certain irradiation: if that they strike against an human body,
presently they lay hold on the Spirits, and are by their Vehicle conveyed
inwardly, and then by an easy labor, they infect the Blood and Humors,
wheresoever flowing in the Vessels, with their ferment, and quickly bring to
them coagulations and putrefaction. And after this manner, through the most
subtle Effluvia, is made as it were a certain transmigration of the
Pestilential Disease, even as when a shoot being cut off from some Tree, and
laid up for a time, and afterward ingrafted to another Trunk, tho from the
smallest bud, it is able to produce a Tree of the same Kind and Nature.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Plague.
THus far we have discoursed of Poison in general, also of the Pestilence, its
beginning and propagation by contagion: it now remains, that we explicate the
description of the Plague, its Nature, according to its accidents, and
symptoms, most worthy of note; then some things shall be added, which belong to
its Cure.

The Plague may be described after this manner, that it is an Epidemical
Disease, Contagious, highly infestous to human kind; taking its beginning from
an invenomed Infection, received first by the Air, and then propagated by
Contagion; which having hiddenly and largely set upon men, causes extinctious
of the Spirits, coagulations of the Blood, blastings, mortifications or
deadnesses of the solid parts, and with the appearances of whelks, buboes, or
carbuncles, as also with the horrid provision of other symptoms, brings the
sick in danger of life.

Although the Plague be one kind of Disease, and its specifical differences, or
essential are not found, yet by reason of the diverse kinds of accidents, which
come upon it, some diversities and irregularities of it are observed, which
something vary the type of the Disease, tho they change not the species. For
first this distemper sometimes is more universal that it rages every where
through many Vilages and Cities at once; but sometimes it is circumscribed in
narrower bounds, and only threatens one Region or Tract of Land. Secondly,
sometimes the Plague comes simple, and unmixt with other Diseases, wherefore
privily, and as it were by surprise, almost without a Fever, or vehemence of
symptoms, brings a secret killing of the sick. Sometimes it is complicated, with
a number of other Diseases, that the business is carried with tumult and
frequent skirmishing between Nature and Death. Thirdly, the degree of malignity
constitutes a great difference; for the Plague in some places, and times is
much more mild, that many of the sick escape; sometimes it is highly mortal,
that most taken are killed, and that scarce one of an hundred recovers.

But because this Disease hides its weapons, and coming on men unawares, kills
them suddenly, therefore it shall be our work, that by some signs, as it were
watchmen planted, we may know the Clandestine coming of this enemy, although we
are not able to foresee it from afar. Very many signs happen, which foretell
shortly a Plague about to come: to wit, if the year keeps not its Temper, but
has immoderate, and very unseasonable excesses, either of heat or cold, or of
dryness or wet; if the smallpox or Measles, do every where rage; if Boils or
Buboes, accompany reigning Fevers. Besides, Astrologers are wont, from the
Aspects of the Stars, or appearances of Comets, to predict the approaching
Plague, but this ought rather to be called a vain conjecture, than a certain
foreknowledge. From a preceding Famine, a most certain presage may be taken,
of a Plague to follow, as in the Adage-(...). The Plague comes with the Famine.
For the like Constitution of the year, which for the most part, by reason of
the Corn being blasted, brings scarcity, is apt also to produce the Plague:
also, an evil way of feeding which people in dearths use, eating all unwholsom
things, without choice, disposes their Bodies, to the more easy receiving the
Infection. Yea, also earthquakes fresh openings of Caverns, and secret Vaults,
by the gaping of the Ground, by reason of the eruptions of malignant and
impoysoned Airs, often give beginning to the Pestilence. For indeed, as there
is need of great diligence, to foresee, as it were from a Watchtower, the
approaching Plague, so there is no less need of care and diligence, to
consider, or take notice of the same, being fresh risen, and the shooting of
its first darts: For oftentimes, being too solicitous, we dread vulgar Fevers,
if perchance they end in death, for this Disease; and sometimes being too
secure, contemning the Pestilence, by reason of its Symptoms, like to a common
Fever, we apprehend not out danger, till too late; wherefore, for the more
full knowledge of this Disease, we will subjoyn its Signs and Symptoms both
common, and Pathognomic or peculiar, and briefly describe their causes, means,
and manner of being done.

Besides the signs already delivered, which by a certain demonstration a priori
or beforehand, bring a suspicion of the Plague about to come, there are
others, the concourse of which, plainly show its presence, in the sick body: of
these, some are common to the Plague, with a Putrid Fever, some are more
proper to this distemper. For the impression of the Pestilence, most often
stirs up an effervency of the Blood, and so has frequently a Fever joined with
it, that among some, in the definition of the Plague, it has the place of a
kind of Fever; wherefore, by reason of the ebullition of the Blood, and the
hurt brought to the Viscera, presently there follows, a growing hot, a
spontaneous weariness, thirst, a burning of the precordia, often great
Vomitings, pains of the Heart, torments of the Intestines, a scurfiness of the
Tongue, or a blackness, a pain of the head, watchings, Frenzy, palpitation of
the Heart, swooning, and sudden loss of strength: tho Fevers are most often
beset, with these kind of Symptoms, yet if at the same time, the Plague has
spread in the neighborhood, and a fear of it has possessed the minds of men,
hence a greater suspicion of this evil is caused, especially, because, whilst
the Pestilence reigns, other Diseases in any one, leave their proper Nature,
and change into it: wherefore, if there happens to the distempers but now
recited, a Communication of the same sickness to many, and a frequency of
Burials, that it becomes every where very deadly, and spreads largely even by
contagion; and if besides, Buboes, Carbuncles, Spots, or other marks of the
pestiferous infection appear, the business is put without doubt, and we may
with no less faith denounce it the Pestilence, than when we see an house
flaming, with fire breaking through the Raftures, we cry out Fire. But because
here is mention made of Buboes, Carbuncles, and of other Symptoms, (of which we
have already spoken, where we treated of Putrid Fevers) it remains, that we
briefly touch the causes of them, and the manner of their being made: They are
these: A Carbuncle, a Bubo, Whelks, Inflammations, and malignant Pustles.

Concerning these in common, we say, that they are all produced of the Blood,
and nervous juice, touched with the pestiferous Poison, and coagulated in
parts, in their circuit, and distempered variously with putrefaction; forasmuch
as the Spirits, residing in either Liquor, especially in the Blood, are no
sooner profligated, by the blast of this malignant Disease, but a coagulation
is induced to the remaining Liquor, even as milk growing sour, or when some
acid juice is poured to it; wherefore, portions of it being more grievously
touched with the Poison, they soon curdle or grow into gobbets, and suffer
corruption with blackness, like Blood out of the Vessels; from whence,
presently they hinder the motion of the rest of the Blood in the Vessels, and
in the Heart, and by means of its ferment, more coagulate it; but whatsoever by
congelation grows into curdled gobbets, unless it be presently cast out of
doors, causes death quickly, by restraining the circulation of the Blood; and
being thrust forth outwardly, toward the superficies of the body, ir is
stopped in its motion, between the narrow windings of the Vessels; and being
wholly destitute either of Spirit, or being struck by a blasting, produces its
deadness, black and blew spots, and black or purple marks; or, by reason of the
Salt and Sulphur, being exalted, by the pestilential ferment, and affecting new
things, grow together into tumors of a various kind.

A Carbuncle, or Fiery Inflammation, is a fiery Tumor, with most sharp and
burning Pustules round about it, and infesting the sick, with an acute pain;
which arising in various places severally, will not be ripened, but creeping
more abroad on the superficies, burns the skin, and at length shakes off the
lobes, or gobbets of its Corruption, and leaves an hollow ulcer, as if burnt by
an Escharotick or burning Plaster.

The generation of Plague-sores, seem to be made after this manner, when
Poisonous infections do strike into the Blood, in its own nature torrid,
portions of it congealed, are fixed in the superficies of the Body; and in that
place, because the motion of the Blood is a little hindered, a tumor at first
small, is induced; which afterward, by a malignant ferment, unfolding it self
more largely, being leisurely increased, creeps into the neighboring part: A
suppuration follows not, because the matter being extravasated, and stagnating,
is not concocted and digested by a gentle heat, but by reason of the particles
of the outrageous Sulphur, together with the carried forth Salt, being heaped
up in these Tumors, and because of the stagnation, they being presently
loosened from the mixture, a burning is excited, as if a Cautery were affixed
to the part: pieces and lobes of skins, eaten as it were from a covered Eschar,
fall off, because the Corrosive venom, impacted in the Muscles, gnaws not only
to the superficies, but those that lie transvers through the whole substance;
wherefore, before all the flesh is consumed, with the membranes, in which the
eaten pieces were invalved, some piece, as it were cut off from the rest falls
away. A Carbuncle, oftentimes but one, oftentimes more arise: sometimes they are
alone, sometimes they are accompanied with a Bubo.

A pestilent Bubo springs forth, only in glandulous places, into whose
substance goes, not only the Blood congealed by the Poison, and carried through
the Arteries, but the nervous juice heaped up there, and carried back into the
Veins. Because this Tumor happens from less torrid juices, and in part more
frigid, therefore it partakes of suppuration. For the matter being leisurely
heaped together, when (by reason of the stagnation, the vital Spirit being
departed) it had lost the form of Blood, it was by a long concoction converted
into matter, from the particles of Salt and Sulphur exalted, and restrained in
the Tumor. But that these Tumors only happen in the Glandulas, the reason is,
not that by the destination of Nature, the nest or tinder of the Disease, is
carried to these parts, but as the particles of the virulent infection, abound
every where in the Blood, and nervous juice, they are more readily gathered
together, as in a common Family, and where the Blood being dilated to the
extreme parts of the Arteries; and is so not readily received, and carried back
by the veins, and also the alible juice, to be carried back from the nerves,
into the veins, is deposed: either of these, as it appears clearly, by late
observations of Anatomists, and by experience, are made or done about the
Glandulas; wherefore, when in these parts, either humors, being stuffed with
the pestilent seeds of the contagion, come together at once, as it were the
nest of the malignity, because of the virulency here deposed from either, is
blown up.

Whelks, fiery inflammations, and purple spots, in respect of the venom, are of
the same stuff, as the Tumors but now described: but in these, the product of
the virulency, consists in a lesser substance, yet with greater danger, by
reason of the seeds of the Poison, being more dispersed: more small portions of
the coagulated Blood being fixed in the skin, constitute these lesser
appearances, wherefore, out of these, some being increased, are ripened into
little itching blisters: others, by reason of a certain blasting, or deadness
of the corrupted Blood, grow into black and blew, and purple Spots.

Although the Plague, by reason of its sudden, secret, and very swift assault upon
sick people, hardly gives time or place, for a prognostic, and when this
Disease, by reason of the occult manner of hurting, contains in it self nothing
that is not suspected, yet there are some signs, that appear in its course, by
which we are wont to foretell, either Life or Death. The business is then
desperate, if the Disease pass presently into an Epidemical distemper, and
makes violent assaults; if that bleeding, or only a small sweat follows, in the
beginning of the Disease; if the Urine be thick and troubled, the Pulse
unequal, and weak; if a Convulsion, or a Frenzy presently follow; if the
Vomits, or Stools are bluish, black, or highly stinking; if the Whelks at
first contract a redness, afterward a blewness; if the Carbuncles are many; if
the Buboes at first swelling up, disappear; if strength be suddenly lost, the
face horrid, or grows black and blew; if with a shivering of the outward parts,
there be an heat of the bowels, especially if these, or many of them happen in
a body full of ill humors, or in an unwholsom season. On the contrary, the sick
may be bid to be of good cheer, if the condition of the Pestilence be lighter,
and less deadly; if the Disease happens in a robust and healthful body, with a
strong mind; if remedies may be timely had, before the Disease has possessed
the whole mass of Blood. Also, if with a continuance of strength, high and
equal Pulse, a suppuration of the Buboes, and a large profusion of matter, with
the absence of more horrid Symptoms, the course of the Disease is performed: In
the mean time, although here we may hope all good, yet we are not to be secure,
because, sometimes the snares of life, are laid privily, with the laudable
appearance of signs, and we suffer most grievously as from a reconciled Enemy,
whose fierce threatenings we seemed to have shunned.

Concerning the curing of very many sicknesses, the business is chiefly
committed to Nature, to whose necessity, Physic is the Midwife: and the
office, and science of a Physician, chiefly is busied in these, that occasions
of giving convenient aids, to this laboring, be attended, but the Plague has
this peculiar, that its cure is not at all to be left to Nature, but that it is
to be endeavored any way, by remedies gathered from Art. Nor are we to be
solicitous of a more opportune, or as it were a gentler time, but Medicines are
most quickly to be prepared, and we must not stay for them some hours, no nor
minutes. But because, whilst the Pestilence reigns, there is no less need of
care, that the Contagion may be driven far away, than that the Disease being
impressed may be cured, therefore, a double task is incumbent on the Physician,
to wit, that he looks to the prevention of this malignant Disease, as well as
to the cure. To prescribe a method for both these, had been a work of too much
tediousness, and to have given you a dish a thousand times dressed by Authors,
wherefore, we will only touch lightly here, some chief Indications, and have to
other things.

Preventive cautions, either respect the Republique, and belong to the
Magistrate, or private persons, to whom it should be taught, what is to be done
by all men, when the Plague is feared.

The public care in the time of the Plague, consists chiefly in these, that
Divine worship be truly observed, that all nests of Putrefaction be cut off,
that filths, Dunghils, and all stinking things may be removed out of the
Streets, and all occasion of the Contagion diligently avoided, and that an
wholesome means of living be constantly observed by the Citizens. For which end,
the use of fruits, and of other unwholsom things should be interdicted: that
poor people, who have not plenty or choice of food, should be provided for, at
the public charge: If still the Pestilence begins to spread, the empoysoned
force of the Air should be corrected, as much as may be, which may be best
done, by the frequent burning of Sulphurous things; the infected should be
separated from the sound, and the dead Carcases, and household stuff should be
avoided; and lastly, that able and fit Physicians, and Ministers be provided
for the use of the sound, and the necessities of the sick.

The preventive means of a private person, is wont to be concluded in these
three things, viz. Diet, Physic, and Surgery. Diet respects the six
nonnatural things, among which, of the greatest moment are, the Air and
passions of the mind: as to the rest, Hippocrates his precept may suffice, viz.
Labor, Meat, Drink, Sleep, Venus, should be taken moderately. The Pestilent
Air should be avoided, by going into some other place; or corrected by the well
burning of Sulphurous things, or whilst we breath it should be cured by
fumigations and sweet smells, often carried near the nostrils. As to the
passions of the minds, fear, and sadness, whilst the Pestilence rages, are as
it were another Plague; for in these, the seeds of the envenomed Contagion,
which are placed in the superficies of the Body, as it were on the edge of a
whirlpool, are snatched inwardly, by a certain force, and carried to the Heart;
wherefore, it is a most excellent Antidote, to be of a cheerful and confident
mind. I have known many, who (as Helmont was wont to say) by fortifying the
Archeus, with Wine and confidence, never used any other Poyson-resisting
Medicines, and remained without any hurt of the Contagion among the infected:
and on the contrary, some struck with fear, when they have dwelt far from all
Contagion, have drank in the seeds of the Pestilence, as if they were derived
from the Stars.

Among the Chirurgical things, to be administered for preservation sake, are
wont to be commended, the opening of a Vein, Cauteries, and Amulets. Where
there is a fullness with a great swelling up of the Blood; or in those who
constantly, by long cu^^om are wont to be let Blood, it is convenient to open a
Vein: For the less the Blood grows hot, and is circulated without Tumult, in
the Vessels, it will be so much the longer, ere it be contaminated, by the
pestiferous Disease. Issues made by Cauteries, are so much used, almost by the
suffrage of all, for preservation sake against the Plague, that it is become the
most common receipt: For these by a constant transmission pour forth the
assiduous coming of the superfluous and excrementitious matter; and if that the
infections of the Pestilence be admitted inwardly, they are cast forth of
doors, at these open ports.

Amulets, hung about the neck, or born on the wrists, are believed to have a
wonderful force against the Pestilence; of these, among some, of the greatest
esteem, are such as are made out of Arsnick, quicksilver, the powder of Toads,
and other Poisons. That the same in this case may be profitable, besides the
observations of Physicians this reason may seem to persuade something. The
Effluvia, or atomical little bodies, emerging now from these bodies, now
residing upon these, are before affirmed to fly about through the whole Region
of the Air; these, as they are diversely figured, some of them easily cohere
with others, but if they strike against some of another form, they oppose and
overturn them: hence, the particles of the pestilent Infection, which are
adverse to our Spirits, excellently agree with those little bodies of Poison
placed near, and are readily fixed to them: wherefore, the Amulets made of
Poison do this, viz. They receive the seeds of the Pestilence meeting us, into
themselves, by reason of the likeness of parts; also, by alluring the same from
our bodies, into their embraces, they in some measure, free the infected from
the infection.

The Medicinal prevention has a twofold scope: First, that the assiduous
coming of the excrementitious matter or humors be taken away by a gentle
purging, as often as there is need: Secondly, that by the daily taking
Poyson-resisting Medicines, our Spirits, and Body may be fortified against the
assault of the Poison: By the former, the Food and cherishers, of which
increase putrefaction brought in by the Poison are drawn away; by the latter,
the first inkindling of the pestiferous Infection, as it were a deadly fire, is
inhibited. Alexipharmies or Medicines contrary to Poisons seem to be helpful
against the contagion of the Plague for this twofold Reason; Both because the
mass of Blood and Viscera being filled with the particles of these, and also
the Spirits before possessed with the same, they do not easily admit of the
company of the impoysoned Infection; also, because the Blood being incited by
the gentle fury of these is kept from coagulation.

Thus much for preservation, it follows now, that we speak of the cure of the
Plague. The doctrine of which, is either general, and comprehends remedies,
which for this end, are taken from Diet, Surgery, and Medicine; or special,
which delivers the use, and Cautions to be exhibited, about those Remedies; and
by what means we are to oppose the Symptoms variously arising.

Diet comprehends the use of the six non-naturals, but the chief care, and
medical cautions, are to be given about eating, the primary Indications of
this, consist not at one and the same time together, but ought to be supplied
by turns, according to the nature of the thing, and the exigency of nature. In
respect of the malignity, and of the loss of strength, Aliments are to be
desired, which greatly cherish the Spirits, and bring a more plentiful
nourishment: in respect of the Feverish distemper, a more slender
refrigerating Diet, and temperating the Blood, seems to be required: The
Physician must regard either, but he may rather intend his Remedies against the
malignity, than the Fever.

The helps that belong to Surgery, are the opening a Vein, which seldom and
very cautiously ought to be used in this Disease, because the Blood being too
much exhausted, and the Vessels falling down, sweat is not so easily procured;
instead of this, it is better to use Cupping, with scarification. For this, and
Blistering, are rightly applied for the drawing forth of the Venom; moreover,
against Buboes, Inflammations, or malignant Ulcers produced by them, Cataplasms,
Fomentations, Plasters, Ointments, and many other things, to be outwardly
applied, are to be sought for from Surgery, in which some Poisons, as the
Electric of Poison, are prescribed by some to be admixed; wherefore,
preparations of Arsnick, to wit, the oil and balsom of it, are commended by
many, in this case too of most excellent use and efficacy.

Medicines for the cure of the Plague, are either Evacuators, or
Poyson-resisters: The intention of the former is, that the serous Latex in the
Blood, and the excrementitious humors, which abound in the Viscera, be thrust
forth of doors; and together with them, very many particles of the invenomed
Infection, every where dispersed in the Body: But these are both Vomitories and
Purgers, the use of which is more rare, and only in the beginning of the
Disease, also Diaphoreticks or sweating Medicines, which at some times may be
suffered according as there is strength, are to be prescribed in the Plague:
For these more fully, and from the whole body at once evacuate, yea, and by
agitating the Blood, defend it from Congelation, and as they move from the
Center, still to the Circumference, they drive the empoysoned ferment, also the
Corruptions of the Blood and humors, far from the heart, and so chase the Enemy
without the Camp. But Vomits, and Purges evacuate less universally, and by
Concentrating the malignant matter, oftentimes carry it inwardly, and fix it to
the Bowels. But these Medicines, whether they operate by purging, or sweating,
ought to be of that kind, which have particles, rather agreeable to the
empoysoned infection, than to our Blood or Spirits; for such a Medicine, will
pass through the various windings of our body, with its whole forces and
unmixt, and by reason of the similitude of either, more certainly takes hold of
the virulent matter of the Disease, and carries it forth of doors with it self,
by the mutual adhesion of the parts, which way provoked nature leads.
Wherefore, Medicines, whether Catharticks or Sudorificks, are commended before
others, which are prepared out of Mercury, Antimony, Gold, Sulphur, Vitriol,
Arsnick, and the like; which, when they cannot be subjugated by our heat, or
mastered, become the best Remedies against the Poison of a pestilent Disease:
for these do not only potently evacuate superfluous things, but when as they
put forth very strong and untameable particles, and explicate them every where
in the body, dissipate the ferments of the Poison growing here and there, and
hinder them from maturation; and as these Remedies, being of themselves not to
be overcome by Nature, are necessitated to be carried outwardly through the
open passages of the body, they carry forth of doors with them, whatsoever
extraneous or hostile thing is met with.

As to Poyson-resisting Medicines, or Alexiterians, which are said to resist
the Poison of this Disease, without any sensible evacuation, they are (for the
most part) such, whose particles are not very much of kin to Nature, so as to
go into Aliment; nor so diverse, as to provoke to an excretion. The same being
inwardly taken, and broken into the smallest pieces, inspire the Blood, and
juices flowing together in the Vessels, and Viscera, with their little bodies,
as with a new ferment, and by moving the same gently, and by keeping them in an
equal mixture, defend them from Coagulation, and Putrefaction; dissipate the
particles begun to be heaped up, one from another, by the same gentle
agitation, and hinder them from maturity; and lastly by pre-possessing the
Blood and Spirits, defend them from the impressions of the pestilent mark.
Among these, some more simple Remedies are commended as Rue, Scordium, etc. but
most of all by far are esteemed, those that are compounded, wherefore, Treacle,
Mithridate, and Diascordium, some of which are composed of no less than fifty
simples; that, it is esteemed a crime in Medicines so complete in all numbers,
to omit one Plant, or one Dram of them in their Compositions; the reason
perchance is, because very many things being put together, may make a mass,
whose diverse kinds of particles being exalted, by long digestion, may stir up
the greater fermentation in our Blood and humors.

Having after this manner ranked the Remedies, in which we ought to be
instructed, for the curing of the Plague; now next we should speak of the
method of cure, viz. What first, and then what next, should be done in order:
but that this Disease has so precipitous a Course, that there is neither place
for deliberation, nor is there frequently any Physician to be gotten, for fear
of the Contagion; wherefore, there is no need here of of many prescripts, or a
long series of Indications; this business is to be quickly performed, and may
be comprehended in a few things. Therefore, when the pestilence reigning, any
one is distempered with the Contagion of this Disease, the help of the
omnipotent God being requested by Prayers, presently Remedies are to be flown
to: If the Plague happens in a body not thoroughly purged, and prone to
Vomiting, presently let a Vomit be taken, whose operation being finished,
immediately let a sweat be provoked, by taking Diaphoreticks, and the same
continued as strength can bear it, and afterward be often repeated. Besides,
let Alexipharmicks or Poyson-resisters, be used almost every moment, until by
the eruption of Whelks, Inflammations, or Buboes, all the Venom be wholly driven
forth of doors: but in the mean time, proper and respective Remedies, are to be
opposed to the most urging Symptoms: but especially, fit helps are to be sought
from Surgery, for the cure of the Buboes, and Plaguesores: the whole weight
of this business, leans on these two Intentions, that the pestiferous Poison
may be every way expelled from within, and then, that the recourse of what is
driven forth, be with equal diligence prevented.

Concerning the Plague, we cannot so readily write examples, and histories of
sick persons, with exact diaries of the Symptoms: because these kind of
sicknesses came not every year, neither when they spread, is it lawful for
every Physician that takes care of his own health, frequently to visit the
sick, or to stay long with them, whereby he may denote all accidents, and
diligently consider the reasons of them; which task however, the renowned
Diemerbrochius, did so firmly persist in, that after him, others may lawfully
be superseded from this work: when sometimes past, in this City, viz. 1645. the
Plague (tho not great) had spread, Doctor Henry Sayer, a very learned
Physician, and happy in his practice, many others refusing this province,
boldly visited all the sick, poor, as well as rich, daily administered to them
Physic, and handled with his own hands, their Buboes, and virulent Ulcers, and
so cured very many sick, by his sedulous, tho dangerous Labor. That he might
fortify himself against the Contagion, before he went into the infected
houses, he was wont only to drink a large draught of Sack, and then his
perambulation about the borders of Death, and the very jaws of the Grave being
finished, to repeat the same Antidote; After he had in this City, as if
inviolable as to the Plague, a long while taken care of the affairs of the Sick
without any hurt, he was sent for to Wallingford-Castle, where this Disease
cruelly Raged, as another Aesculapius, by the Governor of the place: But there
being so bold, as to lie in the same Bed, with a certain Captain (his intimate
Companion) who was taken with the Plague, he quickly received the Contagion of
the same Disease: nor were the Arts then profitable to the Master, which had
been helpful to so many others, but there, with great sorrow of the
Inhabitants, nor without great loss to the Medical Science, he dyed of that
Disease. As to others, distempered by the Pestilence, he was wont to order this
kind of method of healing, if he was sent for before the Buboes or Whelks
appeared outwardly, for the most part he gave a Vomit, the prescriptions of
which were of the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, sometimes with white, and
sometimes with Roman Vitriol: The Vomiting being ended he commanded them to be
presently put into a sweat by the taking of Diaphoreticks; and thence, some
intervals being granted, for the recovery of strength, the sweating to be
continued to the declination of the Disease: but if he were sent for to the
sick, after the appearances of the marks, the Vomiting being let alone, he
insisted only upon Sudorificks.

CHAP. XIV. Of Pestilential and Malignant Fevers in specie, and of others
Epidemical.
AFter having unfolded the Nature of the Plague, by the order of our Tract, we
ought to proceed to the Diseases, which seem to be nearest like its Nature;
which chiefly are Fevers, called Pestilent and Malignant; for it is commonly
noted, that Fevers sometimes reign popularly, which for the vehemence of
symptoms, the great slaughter of the sick, and the great force of contagion,
scarce give place to the Pestilence; which however, because they imitate the
type of Putrid Fevers, and do not so certainly kill the sick as the Plague, or
so certainly infect others, they deserve the name not of the Plague, but by a
more minute appellation of a Pestilential Fever: Besides these, there are
Fevers of another kind, the perniciousness and Contagion of which appear more
remiss, yet, because they are infestous, beyond the force of Putrid Fevers,
and seem to contain in themselves in a manner, the (...) or hand of God of
Hippocrates, are yet by a more soft appellation, called Malignat Fevers.

Those Fevers differ both from the Pest, and from one another according to the
degree, and vehemence of contagion and deadlyness: as the Plague is a Disease
highly contagious, and deadly to human kind; it is the Pestilent Fever, which
commonly spreads with a lesser diffusion of its infection, and frequency of
burials. When the infection is only suspected, and the Crisis happens beyond
the event of vulgar Fevers, only not to be trusted or less safe, it is esteemed
for a Malignant Fever. They are yet more fully described thus.

When the Fever commonly spreads abroad, which for the variety of symptoms,
puts on the likeness of the Putrid Fever so called, to wit, when there are
present, Thirst, Burning, Weariness, Anxiety, roughness of the Tongue,
Watchings, Frenzy, Vomiting, want of Appetite, Syncopy, Swooning,
Heart-pains, and a concourse of other most terrible accidents; if there happen
besides, spots either like to the little Flea-bites, or broad ones like black
and blew strokes, and livid, we esteem this disease of an evil Nature. If
besides these, it is not cured after the wonted manner of Fevers, but that the
strength of the sick is cast down, without any manifest cause, and that death
comes often unlooked for and unsuspected, against the Prognostic of the
Physician, there is yet a greater cause of suspicion of malignity: But if it
kills very many of the sick, and that those who converse with the sick,
contract the evil of the same Disease, that the same Disease spreads through
all the Villages or Cities, it may be said to be more than malignant, a
pestilential Fever; which is yet fully proved, if it rages in very many
ordinarily with a certain common symptom, as when a Squinancy, Dysentery or
deadly Sweat, such as in times past spread in England, accompany these sort of
Fevers.

If that a Fever arises, which Distempers many living in the same Region
together, almost after the same manner, which notwithstanding observes the laws
of a common Putrid Fever in its course, and is cured almost after the same
manner, this is not said to be Pestilent, but only a Malignant Fever; unless
that in some laboring with a remarkable Cacochymy, or fullness of ill humors,
the appearances of Buboes, or of spots, sometimes with a deadly Crisis, and a
contagion creeping upon others, betray some signs of Malignity.

If it be demanded, to which Class of the aforesaid Fevers, these sort of
Pestilential and Malignant Fevers ought to be placed, we ascribe them only to
the rank of continual Fevers; we discharge or acquit intermitting Fevers,
because by intervals they grant such firm Truces to Nature, and then they
regularly and exactly observe their periods, which does not consist with an
invenomed disposition. Also we except Hectic Fevers from malignity, because
otherwise their mortality would not be so long delayed, but that partaking of
Poison, they would kill sooner: among continual Fevers, although we affirm, that
the simple synochal Fevers, are not free, yet they are rarely touched with
this evil: but most of all, the Fever which shows the notes of pestility or
malignity, is of that sort, which resembles the figure of the Putrid Fever so
called: for when in these Fevers, besides the appearances of virulency, we
perceive a continual growing hot of the Blood, which passes through the courses
or stadia of beginning, increase, standing and declination, as in Putrid
Fevers, we deservedly affirm here, the Sulphurous part of the Blood to be
heated and inkindled, and by its burning to have brought in the Fever:
wherefore in these kind of Fevers, two things are especially to be noted, the
growing hot of the Blood and the malignity joined with it, of which now this,
now that is the greater: also, in both there is a great Latitude, and very many
degrees of its intension or heat, according to which the Fever becomes more or
less acute or malignant.

The growing hot of the Blood is performed after the same manner, as is already
said concerning Putrid Fevers: to wit, the Sulphurous part of the Blood
growing hot above measure, as it were takes fire by its fervor; in the time of
its burning it accumulates a great quantity of adust matter, upon whose
subaction and seclusion, depend the state and Crisis after the wonted manner of
Fevers: but besides these, the Blood being infected with a certain venomous
taint, in the burning it begins by reason of the malignant ferment, to be
coagulated into parts, and to putrify: wherefore besides the usual symptoms of
the common Fever, by reason of some congealed portions of the Blood, follow
either deadly Distempers, Swooning, a dejection of the Spirits, also
appearances of spots and marks: besides venomous Effluvia, which depart from
the sick, that are able to raise up the like Distemper in others, by the force
of their contagion; wherefore by reason of its perniciousness and contagion,
and their various degrees, it is called, either a Pestilent or Malignant Fever.

Also whilst the Blood growing hot, is infected with a venomous and malignant
ferment, not only proper coagulations of its mass, with a disposition to
putrefaction, are induced; but also the Nervous Liquor, easily contracts the
taint of this, from whence it being made improportionate to the Brain and
Regiment of the Animal Spirits, stirs up great irregularities in them:
wherefore upon these sort of Fevers, come not only spots and whelks, but most
often a Delirium, Frenzy, Sleepiness, Tremblings of the Limbs, Cramps, and
Convulsive motions; I have often observed, that in some certain years,
Malignant Fevers have increased, which have shown their virulency, without the
appearances of marks, chiefly about the Nervous stock; because in some,
presently after the beginning, has followed a sleepiness, with a mighty
heaviness of the Head, in others, strong Watchings, a perturbation of mind,
with Trembling and Convulsive motions, but in most, either none, or only an
uncertain Crisis, and instead of it, a translation of the Feverish matter to
the Brain; besides it is observed, that these Fevers creep upon others by
contagion, and that very many are killed by them, that therefore they do
deserve to be called Malignant.

But these kind of Fevers are sometimes first begun from a venomous infection,
and the Blood being touched with the Particles of the venom, conceives of it
self an Effervescency, and is inkindled; as when from a contagion or malignant
Air being inspired, any one has fallen into a Malignant Fever, without any
evident cause or predisposition: But sometimes the Feverish Distemper is
induced from a proper cause, and then the seeds of the Malignity, either lying
hid within in the Body, exert themselves in the Effervent Blood, or they come
from another place by the contaminated Air, as it were the Food of the flame
before inkindled; for it appears by frequent observation in the time in which
an Epidemical Fever spreads, that others being any way arisen, turn into it.

Malignant Fevers, as also Pestilential, for the most part are popular, and
invade many at once: but sometimes they are private, and not ordinary, so that
perhaps only one or two are taken in the whole Region; in such a case, it is to
be suspected that they come not from a malignant Air, or Epidemical cause, but
from a morbous provision of the Body; for I have often observed that when in
the Spring or Autumn, a Fever sufficiently common, has spread in some City or
Town, of which very many have dyed, perhaps some one on whom an evil
predisposition, and a more strong evident cause, has brought the Fever, has
lain by it, with more horrid symptoms, and great notes of malignity: in which
case that malignity is not to be called common to the Fever, but not ordinary,
and accidental only.

Although the greatest reason of the difference, by which these kind of Fevers
are distinguished from one another, and from other Fevers, consists in their
deadliness and contagion; yet sometimes, they are noted with a certain peculiar
symptom, from which they take for that time, both the note of malignity, and
the appellation of the name: hence in some years an Epidemical Fever reigns,
which induces to most of the sick a Squinancy, another time an inflammation of
the Lungs, a Pleurisy, Dysentery, or some other distemper, and that oftentimes
most dangerous, and contagious: so the seeds of Diseases, not only derived from
the Parents by traduction, excite their fruits as it were by a certain
designation, in the same part or member; but also, those received from an
Infection commonly spreading, produce in all, a distemper of the same mode and
figure: which yet I think to happen, not because the seeds of the venomous
Infection, respect either this or that Region of the Body, with a certain
peculiar Virtue; but these so affect the mass of Blood, by a like manner in
all, that there is a necessity, for the sake of washing away this stain, that a
Crisis be attempted after the same manner in all. For when, without malignity,
the Blood, by reason of Coagulation, or perhaps other causes, is apt to be
extravasated, the usual places, in which portions of the same being
extravasated, are wont to be fixed, are the Throat, Pleura, Lungs, and
Intestines: wherefore, it is no wonder, when from a malignant cause, the
congelation of the Blood, and for that reason an extravasation is induced, if
the Disease is nested in the accustomed cherishing place of Nature.

Concerning the causes of these kind of Fevers, there is not much business:
they are for the most part deduced, in respect of the malignity, from the
vicious Constitution of the Air; in respect of the Feverish heat, from the
morbous provision of the Body: either of these, are easily made clear, by what
has been already said, concerning a Putrid Fever, and the causes of the
Pestilence: If the malignity be stronger than the Fever, and has induced it,
the impression of it is to be imputed to the inspired Air, or to a Contagion
received from others; if the Fever be first, its inkindling is ascribed to
transpiration being hindered, to a Surfeit, or to some other of the evident
causes above enumerated.

As to the signs, besides contagion and destruction, these show the malignity
of the Fever, a sudden loss of strength, a weak and unequal pulse, and evil
affection of the Brain and nervous parts, being suddenly induced, cruel
Vomitings, blackness of the Tongue, a suffusion of darkness through the whole
Body, but chiefly the appearances of Spots, Buboes, and of other marks.

For the cure of Fevers, both Pestilential and Malignant, there is greater
need of Judgment, and Circumspection, than in any others whatsoever: For when
there are two primary Indications, to wit, the Malignity, and the Feverish
intemperance, and when one can scarcely provide for the one, without detriment
to the other, it is not easily to be discerned, which should first be helped,
or soonest regarded. In respect of the Fever, purging, opening a Vein, and
cooling things, do chiefly help; but whilst these are performed, the Malignity,
for the most part is increased, and being neglected, spreads abroad more
largely its Poison: against the Malignity, Poyson-resisting Cordials, and
Diaphoreticks are required, but these extremely heighten the Fever, they more
shake the Blood and Spirits before inkindled, as it were with the blast of
Bellows, and force all as it were into a flame; wherefore, here is great need
of skill, that these things be rightly ordered in themselves, and where there
is most of danger appearing, thence the Curative Intentions are to be more
immediately designed; but so, as whilst one is consulted about, the other be not
neglected. But in these cases, besides the private Judgment of every Physician,
experience may supply the chief means of healing: for when as these Fevers
first spread, every one almost tryes several Remedies, and by the success of
them collated together, it may be easily reckoned, what kind of method is to be
relied on, till at last, by a frequent trial, or the footsteps of those passing
before, there is made as it were a high and broad Road, for the curing of these
sorts of distempers, bounded both with various observations and warnings.

Besides these sort of Fevers, which spread on many at once, and by reason of
the Contagion, deadliness, and conspicuous notes of virulency, deserve to be
called Pestilent or Malignant; there are some others, epidemical or popular,
which almost every year, either in the Spring or Autumn, rage in some
Countries; of which the Inhabitants for the most part of them are wont to be
sick, and not few, especially of the Elder, to dye: In which notwithstanding,
no signs of Pestilence or Malignity appear, neither does the Disease seem to
spread, from one and so to another, so much by Contagion, as to lay hold on
many, by reason of a predisposition, impressed almost on all. But these kind of
distempers, depend chiefly upon the foregoing Constitution of the year: for if
the season going before was very intemperate, by reason of excess of cold or
heat, of dryness or humidity, and so had continued for a long time, it changes
our Blood very much, from its due temperature, whereby it is apt afterward to
conceive Feverish effervescencies; and from hence a Fever, now of this Type
or Figure, now of that is produced; which presently becomes Epidemical, because
it draws its beginning from a common cause, wherewith the bodies of all, are in
a manner affected: But such Fevers, forasmuch as they depend upon the Blood
having gotten a disposition, now sharp, now austere, or of some other kind, by
reason of the temper of the year, for the most part are of the rank of
intermitting Fevers: yet, by a proper provision of Symptoms, they are wont to
be noted, according to the peculiar Constitution of every year. These are not
able to be comprehended, under a certain common rule, or formal reason, which
may quadrat to the nature of each of these; because they vary every year,
according to their several accidents. However, we will give you the
descriptions of these kind of Fevers, spreading of late years in this Region,
had at that time, for some specimen of the rest, and add it for a conclusion at
the end of this Tract.

There yet remains to be ascribed to the rank of malignant Fevers, some other
private Fevers, and participating of no Contagion: of which sort chiefly are
those, which are wont to happen to Childbearing women, by reason of difficult
and hard labor, or by reason of the stoppage of their Courses. Indeed it
sufficiently appears, by common observation, that these are very dangerous, and
often mortal: for if, by the parts of the Womb being hurt, or by cold being
admitted, or perhaps by any other cause, the Courses are stopped, and the
humor which ought to be thrust forth, shall be confused with the mass of the
Blood, it most wickedly infects it, as it were with a certain venomous mixture;
that by that means, presently a Fever is excited, which with an evil provision
of Symptoms, is very much beset, viz. with heat, and cruel thirst, Vomiting,
pain of the Heart, and watchings, and for the most part obtains, either no
Crisis, or a very difficult one: because, unless the wonted way of the flux of
the Courses, may be at length restored, it is wont, after the heat of the Blood
has been continued for some days, to Communicate the evil to the Brain, and
nervous stock; from whence, by and by, a Delirium, Frenzy, Convulsions, and
other most wicked distempers, are most often induced, which do not seldom end
in Death: but these sort of Fevers deserve a peculiar consideration which we
have more fully determined to show hereafter in a particular discourse
concerning this business; in the mean time, we will undertake to propose some
instances or examples of the Fevers, but now delivered, viz. of the Pestilent,
and Malignant.

The pestilent Fever, of late years, has more rarely spread in these Regions,
than the Plague it self: of the only one of this kind, which fell under our
observation, I will give you a brief description. In the year 1643, when in the
coming on of the Spring, the Earl of Essex besieged Reading, being held for the
King, in both Armies there began a Disease to arise very Epidemical; however,
they persisting in that work, till the besieged were forced to a surrender,
this Disease grew so grievous, that in a short time after, either side left
off, and from that time, for many months, fought not with the Enemy, but with
the Disease: as if there had not been leisure to turn aside to another kind of
Death, this deadly Disease increasing, they being already overthrown by Fate,
and as it were falling down before this one Death. Essexe's Camp moving to the
Thames, pitched in the places adjacent, where he shortly lost a great part of
his men: But the King returned to Oxford, where at first, the Soldiers being
disposed in the open Fields, then afterward among the Towns and Villages,
suffered not much less: For his Foot, (which it chiefly invaded) being pact
together in close houses, when they had filled all things with filthiness, and
unwholsom nastiness, and stinking odors (that the very Air seemed to be
infected) they fell sick by Troops, and as it were by Squadrons. At length the
Fever now more than a Camp Fever invaded the unarmed and peaceable Troops, to
wit, the entertainers of the Soldiers and generally all others, yet at first
(the Disease being yet but lightly inflicted) tho beset with an heavy and long
languishment, however many escaped. About the Summer Solstice this Fever began
also to increase with worse provision of Symptoms, and to lay hold on the
Husbandmen, and others inhabiting the Country. Then afterward, spread through
our City, and all the Country round, for at least Ten miles about. In the mean
time, they who dwelt far from us, in other Counties remained free from hurt,
being as it were without the sphere of the Contagion. But here this Disease
became so Epidemical that a great part of the people was killed by it; and
as soon as it had entered an house, it run through the same, that there was
scarce one left well to administer to the sick; strangers, or such as were sent
for to help the sick, were presently taken with the Disease; that at length,
for fear of the Contagion, those who were sick of this Fever, were avoided by
those who were well, almost as much, as if they had been sick of the Plague.

Nor indeed, did there a less mortality, or slaughter of men, accompany this
Disease: because Cachectic, and Pthisical old men, or otherways unhealthful,
were killed by it; also not a few of Children, young men, and those of a more
mature and robust age. I remember in some Villages, that almost all the old men
dyed this year, that there were scarce any left, who were able to defend the
manners and privileges of the Parish, by the more anciently received
Traditions.

When this Fever first began, it was something like the figure of a putrid
Synochus; but it was harder to be cured, and when it seemed to be helped by a
sweat or looseness, presently it was wont to be renewed again: but for the most
part, after the deflagration of the Blood, continued for six or seven days,
this remitting, and instead of a Crisis the adust matter being translated to
the Brain, the sick for a long time keeping their Beds with raging sometimes,
but more often with a stupefaction, with great weakness, and sometimes with
Convulsive motions, scarcely escaped at last. About the middle of the Summer,
besides the Contagion and frequent burials, this Disease betrayed its
malignity, and pestilential force in open signs, viz. By the eruption of Whelks
and Spots: because about this time in many there appeared without any great
burning of the Fever, an unequal, weak, and very much disordered pulse; also
without a manifest expense of Spirits, their strength presently became
languishing, and very much dejected: In others, sick after the same manner,
appeared little Blisters or Measles, now small and red, now broad and livid: in
many, Buboes, (as in the Plague) about the glandulas: of these some died
silently and unforeseen, without any great struggling of the Spirits, or
Feverish burning excited in the Blood: in the mean time others, by and by
becoming furibundous, whilst they lived suffered most horrid distractions, of
the animal Spirits. Those about to escape from this Disease, without any
laudible Crisis, (unless they were the sooner freed by a sweat provoked by Art)
the Brain, and nervous stock becoming distempered, at length, with a
benummedness of the senses, tremblings, vertigo, debility of the members, and
Convulsive motions, did not grow well but of a long time after. During the
Dog Days, this Disease being still infestous, began to be handled not as a
Fever, but as a lesser Plague, and to be overcome only by Poyson-resisting
Remedies; letting of Blood, was believed to be fatal to this: Vomits, and
Purges, sometimes tho not often, were made use of, but the chiefest means of
Cure, were accounted to be procured by Alexiteriums, and timely sweat. For this
end, besides the prescripts, of Physicians, to be had at the Apothecaries, some
Emperical Remedies deserved no small praise; then first of all, the powder of
the Countess of Kent, began to be of great esteem in this Country; also of no
less note was another powder, of the color of Ashes, which a certain Courtier
staying by chance in this City, gave to many with good success; and to others
approving of the use of it, he sold it at a great price; the sick were wont
having taken half a dram of this, in any Liquor, to fall into a most plentiful
sweat, and so to be freed from the virulency of the Disease; That Diaphoretick
(whose preparation I afterward learnt, from the Cosen German of the Author)
was only the powder of Toads, purged thoroughly with Salt, and then washed in
the best Wine, and lightly calcined in an earthen Pot. The Autumn coming on,
this Disease by degrees remitted its wonted fierceness that fewer grew sick of
it and of them many grew well; till the approach of the Winter, when this
Fever almost wholly vanished, and health was rendered to this City, and the
Country round about fully and wholly.

Thus you have seen the beginning, progress, and end of this Fever, at first
only a Camp Fever, but at length became Pestilential, and Epidemical. That at
first the Disease began in the Soldiers Camp, may seem to be imputed, not only
to their nastiness, and stinking smells, but in some sort to a common vice of
the Air, for as these Fevers come not every year, their original may be
ascribed, partly to the peculiar Constitution of the year. Because, by that
means, a more light intemperance of the Air being contracted, tho it did not
affect the more healthful Inhabitants; yet in the Army, where evident causes,
viz. errors in the six non-naturals, very much happen to the general
procatartic cause, there is a necessity for these kind of sicknesses easily to
be excited. For the constitution of this year, was in the Spring very moist,
and slabbery, almost with continual shours, to which a more hot Summer
succeeding, and the infection of the Feverish Contagion here first increasing,
still grew worse, and disposed all Bodies the more for the receiving it;
wherefore, that this Disease was almost proper to this Region, and at this time
Epidemical, the seed of it ought to be ascribed to its first rising from the
Army, being quartered round about. But forasmuch, as it afterward being made
Pestilential, and very Epidemical, it infected most of the people living here,
and killed not a few, the reason was, the evil affection of the Air; which
because of the intemperance of the year being unwholsom, besides by the
continual breathing forth of stinking vapors from the Soldiers Camps, and the
quarters of the sick, it became at last so vicious, that the infection of the
Fever, being dispersed in it, was greatly exalted, and arose almost to the
virulency of the Plague. Diemerbrochius relates from the like Camp Fever,
arising in the Summer at Spires, afterward another Malignant and Pestilential,
and then the Plague it self to have accrewed. Also, it was a sign that this
Fever of ours, became at last equal to the Plague it self, besides the great
force of the Contagion, and the frequency of Burials, most wicked distempers of
the Blood, and nervous Liquor, being brought presently upon all, by it:
because, strength being suddenly overthrown, the weak intermitting pulse, the
creeping forth of measly Blisters, the eruption of Buboes, argued the
Coagulation, and corruptive disposition of the Blood: besides the Delirium,
Madness, Frenzy, Stupefaction, Sleepiness, Vertigo, Tremblings, Convulsive
motions, and diverse other distempers of the Head, showed the great hurt of the
Brain, and nervous stock.

That the figure, or Idea of this malignant Fever, may be painted to the life,
very many observations or histories of sick people, are easily to be had; of
the many examples of this Disease, I shall only mention a few, which happened
some years since in the house of a venerable man, and as with a mournful
slaughter, so not without some admiration.

About the Winter Solstice, in the year 1653. a youth of about Seven years old,
without any manifest cause, found himself ill, being troubled with a pain of
his Head, Sleepiness, and mighty Stupefaction; with it he had a Fever, tho not
strong, with an ordinary burning, which grew more grievous, only by wandering
fits, sometimes once, sometimes twice in Twenty four hours space: presently from
the beginning, he slept almost continually, also he was wont in his sleep to
cry out, to talk idly, and to leap often out of his Bed; being awakned, and
sometimes of his own accord awaking, he presently came to himself, and
constantly called for drink; his Urine was red, and full of Contents, his pulse
equal, and strong enough; in his wrists appeared light contractures of the
tendons, and in his neck, and other parts of his Body, some red spots like
Flea-bites. At the first, was ordered a light Purgation, and a frequent taking
down of the Belly, by the use of Clysters; he daily took Cordial Julaps, with
Poysonresisters; Vesicatories or blistering Plasters, were applied to his neck,
and other Plasters to the soles of his feet: on the sixth day, a little Blood
streamed from his nostrils; on the seventh, without any manifest through
Crisis, the Fever very much abated, the heat so gentle as to be perceived only
by the Touch; also, the Urine pale, thin, and without any sediment, yet he was
much more grieviously troubled with sleepiness, and a stupefaction of the Head,
so that his Urine, and the excrements of his Belly came away involuntarily;
however, being called upon, he knew the standers by, and answered to their
questions; These distempers, notwithstanding the Remedies every day grew worse:
About the Fourteenth day, the sick youth became so stupid, as neither to be
able to understand, nor to speak, yet he swallowed still what was put into his
mouth, tho unknowingly, and his pulse was laudable enough: about this time, he
fell into a Flux, excited of it self by Nature for four day, which at last
ceasing, a whiteish crust or scurf, and as it were Chaulky, began to spread
over the whole cavity of his Mouth and Throat, which being often in a day wiped
away, new presently broke forth: when he had thus for four days more been sick,
he became better in his intellect, and sense, so that he was able to know his
Parents and Friends, to take notice of their words, and to do something as he
was bid: but as his sensitive faculty began to be restored, so he began to grow
worse as to his speech and the Organs of swallowing; without doubt the matter
being fallen from the Brain, into the beginnings of the Nerves, a Palsy in the
Tongue and Throat had succeeded to the heaviness and stupefaction: which
distemper in a short time so increased, that afterward the sick person could
not swallow at all, but that what he took in at the Mouth presently flowed back
again, neither could any thing go down into the Stomach; when besides the
cruelty of the Disease, there was danger least he should be killed by Famine,
an Instrument was prepared of a pin of Chalk, put into a little pliant wand,
and on the top of it, a little tuft of silk made fit; and this being thrust
down his Throat, opened the closing for a time, whereby the Food taken in, was
suffered to pass, after the use of this for a day or two, he was able to
swallow again, and afterward to take his Food well enough: and within a few
days, he began to speak, to discern any thing, and becoming wonderful hungry,
to ask for, all day long, all sorts of Food, and greedily to devour what ever
was brought to him. In the mean time, by reason of his long sickness, and the
Nervous parts being grievously hurt; he was grown so Lean, that the Bones
scarce sticking to the Skin, he represented exactly a living Skeleton. But
afterward, by the sedulous, indefatigable, and prudent care of the Mother
about his diet, he recovered perfect Health, and is yet living, and well.

When this child had hardly arived to the height of his sickness, his Brother,
elder about two years, on the Ides of January, was taken almost after the same
manner. At first he was troubled with a Torpor and heaviness of the Head, then
growing Feverish, with a sleepiness and stupidity: he began to talk idly in
his sleep, then being awake hardly to come to himself: after four or five days,
these symptoms grew more grievous: he was able to understand little, nor scarce
to speak articulately, and not without stammering. His Urine was thick, cloudy,
without Hypostasis, or settling of the Contents: there appeared, as in his
Brother, red spots, small, like Flea-bites; his Excrements both of his Belly
and Bladder, came away involuntarily. But his Pulse was yet strong and equal;
his Hypochondria were stretched out, and inflated with a tumor of the Abdomen;
about the eighth day, he had a small stream of Blood: on the eleventh day of
his sickness, he fell into a Diarrhaea, by which, in the space of five hours,
he cast forth seven times, bilous, thin, and highly stinking stuff, from whence
there was some hope of his amendment; but the next day after, the flux of his
Belly ceasing, pains, and torments cruelly infested his Belly, that crying out
and moaning night and day, he sent forth most heavy complaints; his
Hypochondria and Abdomen were tumid like a Tympany, and mightily distended;
when he could not receive any thing of ease, from no remedies, the most
exquisite skill of many Physicians being tried, on the fourteenth day he died
Convulsive, in these torments.

A little after his death, viz. on the thirteenth of February, his Brother,
elder than him, about eleven years old, a youth of great hopes, began to be
Feverish; and as the others, with a Torpor and heaviness of his Head, tho less
strongly affected; but the heat in the Blood was greater, which was of a more
hot temperament, and greater perturbation appeared, that for the first six
days, besides heat and thirst, he was troubled with a continual endeavor of
excretion, now by sweat, now by stool. His Urine was red and troubled; some red
spots as in the rest broke forth; on the seventh day he had a bleeding about
five Ounces, which ceasing, a great benumedness succeeded, that for all that
day and the night following, he could scarce lift up his Eyes: on the eighth
day, a most plentiful bleeding followed again at the Nose, that there was
danger, lest he should have lost his life, together with his Blood: the Blood
sprang so copiously from his left nostril, that being received in a Basin, it
made little Bladders or bubbles by its fall: when he had lost above two pound
of Blood, and being taken with a cold sweat, began to lose his strength,
remedies were at length administered, and the Flux was yet hardly stopped. The
Haemorrhage being stayed, the Youth slept soundly, and all that day became
sleepy: yet often awakning, he remained well in his senses and was quick in
sense, and understanding; and being asked of his health, he said he was pretty
well; his Urine, which was before red and troubled, then appeared pale, thin,
and with a laudable Hypostasis, that the sick seemed, (especial because he
wanted thirst, or immoderate heat) to be perfectly cured and freed from the
Fever: on the following morning, being the ninth day of the Fever, he
remained yet torpid, but being raised up, he living cheerfully and without
intemperance, seemed to be in a condition of growing well, but that he began a
little to faulter in his speech: in the evening, when it was lest suspected,
the Fever being again inkindled, on a sudden he fell into a Lethargy, that he
was scarce able to be awakned from sleep, and being pulled, scarce to know any
body, or to speak plainly: although so great a loss of Blood had gone before, the
Pulse was yet quick, high, and vehement, also his Urine red: after deriving,
and withdrawing remedies, had been used all that Night, this Youth seemed to be
in a little better condition, so that in the morning, he continued a long time
from sleep, but began to role about his Eyes hither and thither, and to set
himself up a little; yet without speaking, or knowledge of those that were about
him: before noon, his Eyes being shut again, he wholly lost the use of every
Animal faculty: he lay for three days, as it were Apoplectick, with an high and
vehement Pulse, with a palpitation of the Heart, and a difficult and painful
breathing; his Pulse at length growing lesser by degrees, he dyed the
thirteenth day of the Fever.

On the fifteenth of February, his Sister, somewhat lesser than he was, began to
complain of a pain and torments in her Belly, a trembling in her hands, and a
painful tension or stretching out of the Muscles of her Neck, with a Feverish
intemperance, and thirst: on the last day of February, she growing plainly into
a Fever, could not keep out of her Bed: moreover she was troubled with a
wandering heat, now in her Face, now about her lower parts; also she became
heavy and somnolent, and awaking from sleep, could not presently come to her
self. On the first of March she was lightly Purged and with ease, with an
expression of Rhubarb: her Urine was thick and red; elso petechial red spots,
(as in the rest) were conspicuous: we gave her after that, for four days, at
several times, to wit, after the interval of every six hours space, ten drops
of the spirit of Hartshorn, in a Spoonful of Cordial Julep; the aforesaid
symptoms afterward leisurly remitted, and this sick child, tho slowly,
recovered health without a manifest through Crisis.

About the same time her little Brother, younger than any of these, fell sick
almost after the like manner; who, yet, a looseness arising Naturally of it
self, for many days, voyding Choleric and greenish stuff, was easily cured.
Also in the same Family, many other Domestics, and some strangers coming to
help them, the evil being propagated by Contagion, fell sick of the same
Disease: who notwithstanding, at length became well, tho with difficulty, and
slowly, without any regular Crisis being made.

That this Fever was malignant, plainly appears by the Contagion, Mortality,
and appearances of spots, and many other signs; tho that infecting Contagion,
whereby it spread from one to another, showed it self slow, and of lesser
Efficacy: because, between the sicknesses of each of them, many days, and
oftentimes weeks happened to be, that the infection of this tho acute Disease,
and the dissemination on others, was scarcely finished in four months space, in
the same House. The Fever about the first beginning seemed gentle and mild,
not very terrible as to burning; but the matter being heaped together, from the
deflagration of the Blood, became presently untameable, hard to be
exterminated, also enemical to the Brain and Nervous stock; wherefore in each
of them, the beginning of the Disease, was to be known rather by the torpor and
somnolency, than the fervor and heat; also, the Crisis, tho by several ways
attempted, viz. by Sweat, Flux, Bleeding, did not happily succeed, but for most
part, the Blood growing turgid with the critical motion, endeavored to
transfer the Feverish matter, upon the dwellings of the Animal Spirits; yet it
self notwithstanding, became not putrified by this means, but that about the
standing of the Disease, both humors (to wit the Blood and Nervous Juice) being
vitiated, by an impure mixture together, and grievously touched, caused the
event of the Disease, to be either deadly, or extreme dangerous.

CHAP. XV. Of the Measles and Smallpox.
IN the next place, we refer the Smallpox and Measles to the rank of
pestilential and malignant Fevers, which indeed are mixed Distempers,
consisting at once according, and contrary to our Nature. As to their Original,
they have their seminary born with us: but as to the effect, they produce
preternatural symptoms, and (as the Plague it self) poisonous; so that they
constitute ar it were a certain peculiar kind of Fevers, proper indeed to men,
but after another manner, than Porphyrius has assigned; for it happens for
every man only, and once to be distempered with the Smallpox or Measles: if
perchance any one lives free their whole life, or another more often fall into
these Distempers, they are rare and unusual events of Nature, which lessen not
common observation; yea it is fully confirmed, to wit, that all, and only men are
obnoxious to the Smallpox and Measlles, and are wont to be rid of them at one
sickness. Concerning the Smallpox, we will treat of them apart from the
Measles, what the cause of them is, then what signs and symptoms they have, and
lastly what things belong to the Crisis and Cure.

Concerning the Causes, we ought to consider in the first place, what is the
secret leading Cause, to wit, which renders only and all mankind, and that
once, obnoxious to this Disease. Secondly, we will inquire concerning the
evident Causes, viz. by what and how many ways, this latent and occult
disposition, is wont to be, now sooner now later, deduced into Act. Thirdly, it
shall be declared, what is the conjunct cause, to wit, by what motion and
alteration of the Blood, the figure of this Disease is produced.

1, As to the first, this disposition or Natural predisposition, which inclines
human kind to this Disease, seems to be a certain evil or impurity of the
Blood, conceived in the Womb, among the first Rudiments of Generation; almost
all Authors, would have this ascribed to the Menstruous Blood: which Opinion
seems not altogether improbable: because in a woman's Womb, (otherways than in
most other living Creatures) there is generated a certain Ferment, which being
communicated to the mass of Blood, affords to it vigor and spirit, and then at
set periods, procures a swelling up, and an excretion of the superfluous Blood;
but at the time of Conception, when the Menstrua wholly cease, very much of
this ferment is bestowed on the Faetus or Child; and its Particles, being
Haeterogeneous to all the rest, as a certain extraneous thing, are confused
with the mass of Blood and humors; with which being involved and separated one
from another, lurk or ly hid a long while; yet afterward, at some time, being
moved or stirred up, by some evident cause, they ferment with the Blood, and
induce to it an ebullition, and then a Coagulation; from whence very many
symptoms of this Disease arise.

These fermentative seeds sometimes are few and gentle, and so involved with
other little Bodies, as they do not easily appear, and are brought into act;
sometimes they are more and stranger; so that on the least occasion they are
ripened into this Disease; hence indeed some are taken sooner, with the
Smallpox in their tender years: others more slowly, and not till full or more
ripe age: also some easily receive the contagion, but others converse often
with the sick without danger. The sooner that any one has this Disease, the
more secure they are; wherefore children most often escape, old men, or such as
are of years, are more in danger, viz. in children or young people,
transpiration is more easy, also the habit of the Body more firm and
healthful. But although the venomous seeds of this Disease, for the most part are
wont to be dispersed or blown away at once, and with one sickness; yet it
sometimes happens, that a part of the ininfection being still left, the sick
have fallen into this Disease twice or thrice.

2. The evident cause which stirs up these fermentative seeds, and most often
brings them into act, may be said to be threefold, viz. The contagion received
from some place: the disposition of the Air, and the immoderate perturbation of
the Blood and Humors. It is most manifest by daily experience, that this
Disease does come upon others, and spread abroad by contagion; viz. from the
infected Body, continually flow Effluvia, which being received by other Bodies,
presently like poison they ferment with the Blood, and suscitate or awaken the
lurking or sleeping seeds of the same Disease, Homogeneous with themselves, and
dispose them into the figure or Idea of this Disease: neither is the infection
only communicated by contact, but at a distance. They who live within the same
house, or neighboring to the sick, easily receive the infection; also it is
cherished in Clothes, and dissipated afar off, and transferred to more remote
places. They who are of kin one to another, soonest infect each other: also
they who are fearful, and extremely dread this Disease, more readily fall into
it: For by fear, the Particles of the infection are conveyed inwardly from the
superficies of the Body. At what time the contagion spreads, and that the
Smallpox are Epidemical, all other Diseases almost degenerate into this.
Secondly, a certain peculiar disposition of the Air, notably induces the
Smallpox; hence most often it becomes Popular, and rages ordinarily through
whole Regions, Cities and Villages; hence also it more often exists in the
Spring and Autumn: because at that time especially diverse manners of little
Bodies, and by that means tumultuating flow about in the Air, which we draw in
with the vital Air, and so various effervescencies of the Blood and Humors, and
Ideas of Diseases are raised up, Neither does this Disease become only more
frequent and Epidemical, for these Causes, but also it gets a manifold Nature,
that sometimes the Smallpox are deadly, and as it were pestiferous, and
sometimes they are more mild and benign; to wit, as they have contracted more or
less of malignity from the Air; hence also sometimes black and livid Whelks or
Pustils appear, and have much of the Nature of the Plague. Thirdly, sometimes,
tho the tinder of contagion be absent, and that no malignant constitution of
the Air had gone before, yet by reason of the Blood and Humors being
immoderately disturbed, the Smallpox do arise: so I have known some to have
fallen into this Disease, from a surfeit, or immoderate exercise, when none
besides in the whole Country about, has been sick of it, to wit, the seeds of
this evil, lying hid, without any previous infection, being stirred up by a too
great fervor of the Blood, and being associated, gathering together, easily
defile, and infect the whole mass of the Blood, with their ferment.

3 So much for the secret leading, and evident causes, but as to the conjunct
cause, viz. which is the formal reason of this Disease, or the manner of its
being made, the business seems a little more intricate. It is commonly wont to
be compared to Must growing hot, or Beer when it Purges in the Vat: For if you
put to these Liquors, any thing of ferment: as their Particles are
Heterogeneous, and of wonderful activity, presently they diffuse themselves
through the whole substance of the Liquor, they exagitate the more thick and
impure Bodies, against which they are dashed, beat them asunder, and role about
them, until a flowring being made, they drive the same from the intimate
embrace or company of the Liquor, to the outmost superficies. After the like
manner the Heterogeneous seeds of this Disease, are thought to ferment the
Blood, and then by a certain eruption of Whelks or Pustles, like the flowring,
purifies it. But indeed, if we should more strictly consider the business,
there will appear here a great difference: because the infection of the
Smallpox, is as it were a ferment, but corruptive, and compels the Blood to
grow hot, not toward perfection, but depravation; for when the Particles of
this venomous infection strike against the receiving subject, they presently
raise up little Bodies like to themselves, and born with us, with which being
associated, they pass through the whole mass of the Blood, and make it to grow
highly turgid, and to boil up, and after some time growing fervent, to go into
parts, and to be coagulated, viz. the dispersed seeds of the Poison, dissolve
the mixture of the Blood, presently profligate the more pure Spirits, then they
join its more thick Particles to themselves, and by their adhesion, render them
as it were congealed: The portions being so coagulated, together with the
infolded seeds of the poison, being left by the rest of the Blood, in its
circuit, between the extremities of the Vessels, are affixed to the skin: by
which means, if Nature being strong enough, does cast forth the whole poison,
with the congealed Blood, the remaining mass of the Blood, although made poorer,
remains however in a condition to continue life and health: but if the Blood,
being too excessively congealed, cannot be purified after this manner; or if
portions of the Blood growing together with the poison, do not fully break
forth, or at last do stagnate within, they wholly corrupt the Liquor of the
Blood, or else being affixed to the Viscera, and especially to the Heart, they
destroy their constitution and strength.

Portions of the congealed Blood, with the poison, begin to break forth about
the fourth day, (now sooner now later:) because coagulation is not presently
induced, but after some time, in which the venom unfolds it self, and ferments
the Blood with its effervency: First, light portions of the infected Blood, and
those but few in number, like to Flea-bites, are fixed in the skin: quickly
after more appear, and those first broke forth, by the accession of new matter,
and by the continual appulsion of the congealed Blood, increase and are
elevated into a tumor: then these whelks at first red being by degrees
increased, at length grow white; viz. the Blood being thrust forth of the
Vessels with the poison, by reason of the heat and stagnation, is changed into
matter: about the seventh day after the eruption, the white tumors grow crusty,
into a dry scab; for the more thin part of the matter being evaporated, the
rest grows hard, which then having eaten, and broke off the Cuticula, or
outward thin skin, falls away from the flesh or next skin.

When the infection of the Smallpox, is at once impressed on the Blood and
Spirits, it very rarely can be blotted out, or dissipated by Medicines, or
blood letting; but that its hidden disposition, will break forth into act;
wherefore at first it diffuses it self by little and little, and inspires the
mass of Blood, as it were with a ferment, hence an ebullition and growing hot
are produced in the whole Body, the Vessels are distended, the Viscera
provoked, the membranes pulled, until the seeds of the contagion, by fusing and
coagulating the Blood, being at length involved with its congealed portions,
are thrust forth of doors. The essence of this Disease will be better laid
open, if that I shall recount the signs and symptoms, which are to be observed
in its whole course, and shall add in order the reasons and causes of them, on
which they depend: but they are those which either indicate the Disease being
present, or that foretell its state and event.

As to the Diagnosis of this Disease, by which it may be known, whether any one
at first falling sick, will have the Smallpox or not; at that time are to be
considered, the force of the contagion, and the concourse of the symptoms first
appearing; for if by reason of the evil constitution of the Air, this Disease
does spread abroad every where, none then is taken with a Fever, without the
suspicion of the Smallpox, especially if they never had them before in their
lives; but if this Disease be more rare, and without fear of contagion, yet its
unlooked for assault quickly betrays it self, by these sort of signs and
symptoms.

1. There is a wandering and uncertain Fever, sometimes strong, sometimes more
remiss, observing no reason of increase, or growing continually hot, so that
the sick are now highly hot, by and by without any evident cause, they are
without a Fever; the cause of which is, for that the fermentative seeds are
not agitated by an equal motion, but like fire half choked, now increases
more, and now are almost quelled, and ready to expire; until the burning
spreading more largly, the flame every where breaks forth.

2. A pain in the Head, and Loins, is so peculiar a sign in this Disease, that
it almost alone, in a continual Fever, signifies the approach of the
smallpox: the reason of which is commonly imputed, to the greater Vessels
being very much distended, by the effervency of the Blood: but indeed it
appears not, wherefore the same trouble is not caused equally in other parts,
by reason of the like distention of the Vessels, and wherefore in the
smallpox, more than in a burning Fever, or in other Fevers, where the Blood
grows more hot, these kind of pains should increase; yea, it may be observed,
that great pains, now in the Head, now in the Loins, do urge, when the Blood
but little swelling up, the Vessels are not amplified, viz, in the beginning of
the Disease, when the Feverish distemper is not yet conspicuous, whilst the
sick as yet go abroad, and are well in their stomach, upon the first coming on
of the smallpox, they betray themselves by these kind of pains. Wherefore, the
cause of these kind of dolorific pains, seems rather to subsist in the nervous
stock, viz. in the Brain, and spinal marrow, and that by reason of the
membranes, and nervous parts being pulled or hauled, by the particles of the
Poison, these pains do arise. For it is most likely, that the innate seeds of
the smallpox, are chiefly hidden in the Spermatick parts, and that first of
all, the Contagion lays hold on, for the most part, the animal Spirits; hence,
the first effervency is stirred up in the juice, wherewith the Brain, and
nervous parts, but especially the Spinal marrow are watered, and from thence
the evil is Communicated to the mass of Blood; wherefore, this Disease
beginning, the Head and Loins are tormented with cruel pain; afterward, the
venom being translated into the Blood, the Feverish effervescency is stirred
up in the whole.

3. Great anxiety, and unquietness, and sometimes a swooning, infest the sick,
viz. by reason of the perturbed motion of the Blood, as also its equal mixture,
beginning to be solved, by the Poisonous ferment, the Blood from thence being
apt to stagnate in the Heart, and to be hindered in its Circuit, causes these
affections to be thus excited.

4. Cruel Vomiting, also when the Ventricle is free from an impure ballast of
humors, very often accompanies this Disease; the reason of which is, because
the fermentative seeds, being stirred up into motion, by the little Arteries
gaping into the Coats of the Ventricle, are deposed by every appulse of the
Blood, and raise up Vomiting, as if the particles of stibium had been
swallowed; but afterward, as soon as sweating being procured, the Poison is
driven forth outwardly, this Symptom ceases, and the sick are well in their
stomach, without any purging forth of the noxious matter.

5. With these may be ranked, the Symptoms which show themselves, according to
the various habitudes of the Body, after a diverse manner, as heavy sleepiness,
terrors in sleep, deliriums, tremblings, and convulsions, sneezing, heat,
redness, a sense of pricking over the whole Body, involuntary tears, a
sparkling and itching of the eyes, a tumor or swelling up of the face, a
vehemence of Symptoms from the beginning, that the Disease seems presently to
have attained its strength: the reason of all which, may easily be elucidated,
if what has been already said, concerning the Symptoms of Fevers, be
observed; with respect to the diverse tempers of the sick, their habit, and
age, as also the condition of the year.

2. As to the Prognosis of this Disease, by the Symtomatick signs, it is
indicated to be either salutary, or mortal, or of a doubtful Event.

1. The business promises well, when this Disease has benign circumstances; to
wit, when it happens in a good constitution of the Air and Year, at what time
the smallpox are less malignant and pestilential; as in the year 1654, at
Oxford, about Autumn, the smallpox spread abundantly, yet very many escaped
with them: but before, in the year 1649. this Disease was more rare, yet most
dyed of it. Also, there is less danger, if it should happen in the age of
Childhood, or Infancy, or in a sanguine temper, and good habit of Body, or in a
Family, to whose Ancestors, the smallpox have not proved mortal: Besides, if
in the whole course of the Disease, the Symptoms prove laudable, if in the
first assault, there be a gentle Fever, without cruel Vomiting, Swooning,
Delirium, or other horrid Distempers; if the Fever about the fourth day be
allayed, with the Symptoms chiefly urging, and then some little red spots begin
to appear: if on the second day, of the coming forth of those little red spot,
they become more conspicuous, which afterward grow together by degrees into
little Pimples, and are ripened into matter; if about the tenth day, or
thereabouts, after the eruption, the white tumors begin to scab, and by little
and little from thence to fall off: if after their first coming forth, the
smallpox are soft, distinct, few, round, sharp pointed, lying only toward the
skin, and not in the inward parts, you may be confident the sick will do very
well, and is in a good condition.

2. The appearances, which in the smallpox, signify the business to be
suspected, and full of danger are of this sort: if there be a malignant
constitution of the Air that this Disease becomes Pestilential, and that many
die of it: if men of more ripe years, or middle age, be taken with it; if it
happens in a cold and melancholic temper, or in an impure or evil humoured
Body, where the Blood is not rightly circulated, nor transpiration truly
performed; or if the Hypochondria, or Precordia are obstructed, some of the
Viscera infirm, or troubled with an Ulcer, or if the habit of the Body be too
fat, the smallpox happen not without great danger of life; nor is it less to
be feared, when presently after the beginning, a great Fever, cruel Vomiting,
Swooning, a dejection of strength, Frenzy or Delirium, come upon them, and
that these desist not, upon the full coming forth of the smallpox, for these
signify a too great perturbation in the Blood and humors; also, a confusion
and contumacy of the morbifick matter, which can neither be subdued, nor easily
separated from the mass of Blood, or equally extruded from it: if there be an
anxiety, and great unquietness, with an inordinate boiling up, and growing hot
of the Blood; also a great thirst, a difficulty of breathing, also a flux of
the Belly, or Dysentery, they show that sweating is hindered, and that the
malignant humors, restagnate toward the inward parts: The smallpox breaking
forth slowly, argue the crudity, and untameableness of the matter, and the
impotency of Nature, and it is much more a sign, if they come forth double, and
continued, in too excessive a quantity, and confusion, and also if there be a
disordered expulsion, and irregular, of that matter, when not in certain
issues, but every where undistinguishable. The pox being hard, signify the
incoction of the same matter, being depressed, a weak expulsion; and they are
the worse, if in the midst of them appear black spots; or if purple spots
familiar to the Fever, or the Plague, are sprinkled among the pox, they
indicate a great malignity, and putrefaction of the Blood, such as is wont to
be found in the Pestilence. Lastly, the pox being black, livid, or green, are
of an evil omen, because, besides the coagulations of the Blood, they argue its
deadlinesses, and corruptions, as in a Gangreen, or pestilent Plague sore; if
when the smallpox being come forth, they presently grow dry, and the swelling
of the parts remit, it shows a going back of the malignant matter, or of the
congealed Blood, with the Poison, and a restagnation of it to the inward parts;
from whence unless a more free Diaphoresis or sweating be excited, that it may
be thrust forth of doors again, death for the most part quickly follows: For
from hence, the Blood being more coagulated, enters into putrefaction, also it
is apt to be hindered in its motion, and to stagnate in the heart, and Vessels.
If after the coming forth of the smallpox, a flux of the Belly, or a Bleeding
at nose, comes upon them, it is an evil sign, because, by this means, the Venom
driven outwardly, is again called back inwardly; but sometimes I have observed
these Symptoms to have happened, with great ease to the sick, viz. Nature being
before oppressed, and burdened; after this manner, part of the burden being
as it were detracted, she was eased; wherefore, she buckled her self to the
work of sweating, and more readily expedited the expulsion of the noxious
matter.

As to the Curative part, since the stadium or course of this Disease, has
three seasons, as it were so many measures, distinct one from another, the
Curative intentions ought to be accommodated to each of these; wherefore the
Curative method concerning the smallpox, teaches first, what is to be done so
long as the Blood boyles up, and grows hot inwardly, with the motion of the
fermentative matter, and before the smallpox appear, which period for the most
part is finished, in four or five days.

Secondly, what means or manner of Diet and Physic is to be instituted, after
the coming forth of the smallpox, until the state or standing of the Disease,
viz. whilst the whelks or pox come to the height, and being fully suppurated or
ripened, begin to dry. Thirdly and lastly, what we must observe in the
declining of the Disease, even whilst the smallpox growing dry, fall off.

1. As to the first, let the intention be, that we may carry away every
impediment of Nature, whereby the Blood being infected by the ferment of the
Smallpox, and apt to be coagulated, may yet retain an equal motion in the
Heart, and without stagnation in the Vessels, and growing hot, may expel forth
of doors the congealed portions with the Poison; in the mean time, there must
be a caution, least the work of fermentation or growing hot be any ways
hindered, or too much provoked; for by this, the mass of the Blood is agitated
into congealed portions, more than it ought to be; by that other, it is
restrained too much, in its motion, nor are the invenomed Particles sent forth
of doors, with the congealed Blood; Nature in the work of secretion and
expulsion, is wont to be hindered, by too great an heap of excrements in the
Viscera, or by the abundance of Blood in the Vessels; wherefore, upon the first
assault of the Disease, care must be taken, that if need be, an evacuation by
Vomit or Stool, be timely procured; but only more mild Purges, and gentle, are
to be used, which do not too much provoke, or disturb the Humors: wherefore, at
this time, Purges, Emetics, or Clysters, now these, now those, take place; also
the letting of Blood, if there be a fullness, is performed with good success.

During this growing hot of the Blood, diet ought to be instituted slender and
moderately cooling, viz. Barly-Broth, or Grewel of Oatmeal, Posset Drink, Small
Beer or the like: Flesh, and Flesh Broths are to be avoided, whereby the Blood,
by reason of the too great plenty of Sulphurous Food, may be inkindled more
than it ought; also all cold, and sharp or acid things are hurtful: for these
congeal the Blood more, and contract the little mouths of the Vessels, by their
astriction or binding Nature, that the Smallpox come forth less freely; also
hot things, and Cordials are cautiously to be administered, for by these the
Blood and Humors are too much agitated, and driven into confusion.

2. When the Smallpox begin to appear, there are three things, which by a
constant Rule we prescribe to be performed, to every sick person; to wit, that
a soft and gentle Sweat be still continued in the Blood; also, that the Throat
and Eyes may be preserved, from a too great eruption of the Smallpox. That the
Blood lightly growing hot may emit the Smallpox, decoctions of Figs, Marigold
flowers, and shavings of Hartshorn in Posset Drink, are commonly prescribed,
and the use of them is general for a long time, almost with all people; for the
same intention, we are wont sometimes in a day, to give them moderate Cordials;
but the more hot and strong are carefully to be shunned; Purging and Blood
letting here are most wickedly enterprised, and these tho necessity compelled,
Physicians dare not meddle with for fear of blame: For to defend the Throat and
Gutteral parts, we put on the outer skin, a defense of Saffron dipped in Breast
Milk, and sowed in a Rag; for these, by opening the pores, draw away the venom
outwardly, from the most inward part of the Throat; also for this end, we
administer Gargarisms, and things to wash the mouth, which by their
restriction, restrain the coming forth of the Smallpox withing: we defend the
Eyes, with peculiar Medicines, of Rose Water, and Breast Milk, with Saffron,
and such like, frequently iterated, from the incursion of the Smallpox:
Besides these, sometimes certain most horrid symptoms do trouble, which must be
timely helped with convenient Remedies; sometimes there are present, Watchings,
Frenzy, Bleeding at Nose, Vomiting, Looseness, and a falling back of the
Smallpox: for these and diverse others, as occasion arises, a prudent Physician
knows how to provide; in which however there is need of great caution, least
whilst we take care of the smaller matters, the great work of Nature should be
disturbed by a too great molestation of Medicines. For in all this time there
is one, and a continued Crisis: wherefore nothing is to be meddled with rashly.
There is required the most care and circumspection of the Physician and Nurses,
or those that administer to the sick, when this Disease is at its height or
standing, viz. least that when the Smallpox be fully come forth, and brought
to their greatest height, transpiration should be hindered; for then the sick
are in danger of renewing the Fever, and of the restagnation of the Malignant
matter within, whilst we study to prevent the one, we for the most part bring
on the other.

3. When the Disease shall be in its declination, and the Smallpox begin to
wither and Scab, the business for the most part is out of danger, nor is there
much need of a Physician: let the sick, tho he grow very hungry content himself
still with a slender diet, and without flesh: if the Scabs fall off slowly, we
are wont to ripen them with Lineaments, and peculiar Medicines, to make them
fall, and care should be taken that they leave not behind them too great pits:
after the sick having the Scabs every where fallen off, and are able to rise
and walk about the Chamber, the filthy Excrementitious matter in the Bowels, is
to be carried away, by two or three times Purging, and then they may be
permitted to use a more plentiful and stronger diet.

The Measles are so much akin to the Smallpox, that with most Authors, they
have not deserved to be handled apart from them, but that either distemper have
been treated of together, after the like manner and method. The essence and
cure differ at least accidentally, or as they are greater or lesser; because in
the Measles the whealks rise not up to so great a bulk, neither are they
suppuritated; wherefore the sickness is sooner ended and with less danger. This
distemper is wont mostly to spread upon children, more rarely among those of
years, or old men, also those who first have had the Smallpox, are not
afterward so obnoxious to the Measles, but in most things, either distemper
are of kin, viz. the evil being contracted in the Womb, disposes men only, and
all men once, to the Measles; the malignant constitution of the Air, and
sometimes a surfeit, and most often the contagion, are wont to bring the hidden
disposition into act: there are present marks of malignity, and the sickness
oftentimes becomes Epidemical, and with mortality and contagion.

That I may briefly contract the sum of the matter: it seems that the Measles
are a certain lighter flowring, of on extraneous ferment, contracted from the
Womb; by which, some Particles being stirred up into motion, make the Blood
lightly to grow hot, and to be a little coagulated: wherefore the marks from
thence spread abroad, are dissipated without any breaking of the Cuticula, or
outward skin, by evaporation only: but the Smallpox are a more full and strong
agitation, according to all the Particles of the same ferment, which causing a
greater ebullition and coagulation of the Blood, produces far more full whelks,
and greater in bulk, and not to be dissolved, but by suppuration, or growing
into matter: when the Smallpox preceed, they are not only exempt from the same
disease any more, but also from the Measles, because they consume only some of
the Particles of the ferment, leave still a disposition to the Smallpox;
wherefore old men, or those of years, are not so readily infected with the
Measles, because they are either freed from the contagion, by having before had
the Smallpox, or else the infection of this more light Disease, is easily
resisted by their more strong Spirits.

It were easy to illustrate the afore-recited Doctrine, concerning the Small
Pox, with Histories and Observations of the sick, because there is no Disease
besides can supply with a greater plenty of Examples, or variety of Accidents:
but of the great number of this kind, I shall only propose in this place a few
Cases, and those remarkable for some irregularities.

It is a usual thing to handle all that are sick of the Small Pox, with a like,
or wholly the same method of Curing, and manner of Diet; wherefore, a Physician
is rarely sent for to the common sort, but the business is wholly committed to
some women, professing themselves skilful in this Disease: and these are wont
to boil in their broths, and all the suppings of the sick, Marigold Flowers,
shaving of Hartshorn, and sometimes Figs; also every night to administer a
Bolus of Diascordium: and they who grow not well by this kind of Government,
tho not neglected, yet are affirmed to be incurable, by reason of the cruelty
of the Disease. But truly this kind of practice is not convenient for all
alike, nor to be administered to every one indifferently, as these two following
Histories will make manifest.

A Young Man, about 20 years of Age, of a slender body, and more hot
temperature, began to be feverish in the beginning of the Spring, at first
cruel Vomitings, an oppression of the heart, and frequent changes of heat and
shivering, a pain in his Loins, a disturbance of his fancy and wakings infested
him: on the third day, the Small Pox appearing, those symptoms remitted, but
still the Fever, with heat and thirst continued. Not only the accustomed
Decoctions in this Disease, but also a most elegant Julep, of a most grateful
taste, were so nauseous and troublesome to him, that he would not so much as
taste the same, but with a great deal of trouble: as often as he took going to
sleep, Diascordium, or any other more temperate Cordial, for the continuing his
sweat, tho in a very little quantity, the night following he was without sleep,
and in great disquiet; and then in the beginning of the morning a bleeding
followed, by which means, indeed, the Small Pox being full come forth, the Life
of the sick was in great danger, by reason of this occasion happening once or
twice; wherefore, when I had found by observation, his blood apt to grow
immoderately hot, by so light a provocation, I instituted this method as
occasion served. All Medicines being let alone, he took for the quenching his
thirst small beer, and simple Almond Drink, at his pleasure: for his food,
because he vomited back all Oatmeal Grewel, or Barley Broth, he eat only apples
roasted tender, and dressed with suggar and rose water, often in a day. Nature
being contented with this slender ordering, and being seen to be disturbed with
any other thing, performed happily its work, that the sick person grew well,
without any grievous symptom afterward, the Small Pox from thence ripening,
and then of their own accord falling off.

In the middle of the Autumn, of the former Year, a Gentile Young Man, being
endued with a sharp Blood, and obnoxious to a frequent bleeding at Nose, fell
sick of the Small Pox; his Blood of its own accord grew immoderately hot, that
the whealks very quickly broke forth over all his Body: Posset Drink, with
Marigold Flowers, and other usual things boiled in it, also Juleps, or any
Cordials, tho temperate, and gently provoking sweat, most certainly stirred up
a Flux of Blood in this Person; wherefore I ordered the like manner of Diet, as
in the sick Person before cited, by which he found himself better, however, in
the very state or standing of the Disease, (when the Small Pox being fully come
forth, by reason of a more difficult transpiration, the Fever is wont to be
somewhat renewed in all) this sick Man fell into a most plentiful bleeding;
that after a large profusion of Blood, the Small Pox began to flagg or fall:
After that Remedies, very many, were tried in vain, for the staying of the
Blood, at length a little Bag being hung about his Neck (in which was a Toad
dried in the Sun, and bruised) he first, and immediately perceived ease; tho
the bleeding was by this means stayed, and not any more returning, (whilst he
constantly wore this peculiar Medicine in his Bosom) our sick Man still using a
most thin and cooling Diet, grew quite well; that indeed from hence it may
appear, that although the Blood in this Distemper, is apt to be greatly
coagulated, yet so long as the Vital Spirits, being strong and robust, are able
sufficiently to execute their government, they endeavoring by their proper
strength or forces, do best of all separate and thrust forth the congealed
portions of the Blood, as it were by a certain skilful separation; and this
work is most of all hindered, when the same spirits are too much irritated by
Cordials, or more hot food, and agitated into confusion: But in the Plague it
happens otherwise, because in this, if any delay be granted, the Spirits
themselves are presently profligated by the venom; wherefore, here they must
fight close and quick, when in the Small Pox, the Physician does his business
better by delay.

Concerning letting of Blood, at the instant breaking out of the Small Pox, it
is very dubious: formerly, among our Countrymen, this was esteemed a wicked
business, neither were they wont to admit of Phlebotomy under any pretext of
necessity: but of late, experience having taught us, in some cases, it is
found, that to let Blood has been wholly profitable and necessary; which
evacuation however, if it should be administered indifferently in every
constitution, or when this need should be, it should be performed in too large
a quantity, by that means oftentimes very great damage arises.

Some years before, I visited a young Gentlewoman, of a storid countenance, and
more hot temperature, growing into a Fever, after the fourth month of her
being with Child: she was troubled with a cruel vomiting, a most cruel pain of
the Loins, besides with most strong heat and thirst: her pulse was swift, with
a strong and vehement vibration or beating: although the Small Pox had never been
in that place, yet these symptoms gave no light suspicion of this Disease;
however, its great effervescency indicated that Blood should be taken away;
wherefore I took away about six ounces presently, upon which the heat remitted
somewhat, yet the vomiting, with a cruel pain in the Loins, remained still: At
the hour of sleep I gave her a Cordial Bolus, with half a grain of our
Laudanum, by which means quiet sleep followed, with a pleasant sweat, and an
allaying of all the symptoms: the next morning the Small Pox came forth, with
which, although the sick Gentlewoman was greatly distempered, yet she grew well
without any dangerous sickness, or fear of miscarrying, and went out her full
time.

The last Autumn, a strong Man, of an active and robust constitution of body,
yet of a pale countenance, and more cold temper, fell into a Fever: on the
second day he was tormented with heat and thirst, and a most cruel pain in his
Loins: when I had prescribed Blood to be taken in a small quantity, the
unskilful Surgeon, who was sent for, took from him almost half a pound; a
little after, the sick man began to be all over in a cold sweat, on a sudden to
loose all strength, to be troubled with a shivering, a weak Pulse and unequal,
and frequent swooning: At this time being sent for, I gave him a temperate
Cordial, to be taken frequently. His Spirits and Pulse being thereby restored,
the Fever was renewed, which afterward, for some days, yea, weeks, exercised
the sick man, after a very irregular manner; for he was wont for three or four
days, to grow very hot, also to be infested with thirst, watchings, headache,
and other symptoms, then to be troubled all over with a copious and critical
sweat, by which indeed for half a days space he found himself better: But from
thence, the Fever still growing worse, heaped together again new matter, till
it was dispersed by another Crisis, and then another. After that he had been
thus feverish, for at least twenty days irregularly, at length the Small Pox
began to come forth, in several parts of his Body, here and there, and then the
Fever wholly remitted; yet within few days, by reason of some errors committed
in his Diet, very many of the whealks began to fall down again, few of them
only being brought to maturity: However, instead of the subsiding Small Pocks,
a mighty Bubo grew up behind his right Ear; from which, being soon ripened, and
broke, a great plenty of matter flowed forth for many days, and so at length
the corruptions of the Blood, unable otherways to be dissipated, were carried
forth by degrees, and the sick Person recovered perfect Health.

CHAP. XVI. Of Fevers of Childbearing Women.
VUlgar Experience abundantly testifies, that the Fevers of Women lying in are
very dangerous, beyond the disposition of other common Fevers: also that the
same differ very much, as to their essence, from both a simple and putrid
Synochus, plainly appears from their signs and symptoms rightly weighed:
wherefore, I believe it not to be from the matter, to handle after malignant
Fevers, the acute Diseases of Women lying in, being exceeding near of kin to
those, for their mortality or perniciousness. Yet, before I shall enter upon
the unfolding these Diseases, it behooves us to consider their subjects, viz.
the Bodies of Women in Childbed, after what manner they are predisposed, and by
what provision they are made obnoxious to these kind of sicknesses.

Concerning this, the first thing that offers itself, is, that the Flux of the
menstruous Blood, is wholly convenient to be suffered by human kind, and at
this time for Women, concerning whose nature and original we shall not inquire
in this place; but it shall suffice to note, that in them, the particles of the
Blood, to be periodically thrust forth, are very Permentative; which, if
retained in the Body, beyond the wonted manner of Nature, are very often the
cause of many Diseases: unless only when a Woman conceives with Child. For all
the time of her being big Bellied, the monthly Flowers are stopped without any
incommodiousness; and in the mean time, milk, or the alible juice, is disposed
in great plenty, about the parts of the Womb, for the nourishment of the Child:
but after the Birth, this daily suppression of the monthly Flowers, is
recompensed by a copious flowing forth of the Lochia, or what comes away after
the Birth; and the milk within three days having wholly left the Womb, springs
forth plentifully into the Breasts: at which time, Women lying in, are wont to
be troubled with a small Fever. If that the milk be driven away from the
Breasts, it restagnates again toward the Womb, and is thrust forth, together
with the Lochia, under the form of a whitish humor. In the mean time, the
Womb, after the Birth, becomes subject to various distempers; for oftentimes,
its tone is hurt, the unity is dissolved, and many other accidents are induced,
which render Women lying in subject to danger: wherefore, that their acute
Diseases may be rightly unfolded, it is convenient, for to consider chiefly
these three things, viz. first, the nourishment of the Child, or the Generation
of Milk, both in the Womb, and in the Dugs, and the metastasis or translation
of it from one to another. Secondly, the purging of the Mothers Blood, or the
profluvium of the Lochia, after a long suppression of the Menstrua. Thirdly,
the condition of the Womb after the Birth, and its influence on other parts of
the Body. And these being premised, we will speak of the Fevers of Women lying
in, viz. both the milkie, and the putrid, called, and that deservedly,
malignant, by reason of its deadliness.

First the Milk, and nourishing humor, being heaped up in the parts of the
Womb, for the nourishment of the Child, are of a like nature, tho somewhat
different in consistency. Milk is indeed more thick, because it ought to be
received in at the mouth, and to be kept in the Ventricle, and afterward it
more thin portion to be conveyed to the mass of Blood. The other alible Juice
is more thin, and like the water of distilled Milk, because it is immediately
poured into the Blood of the Embryo, through the umbilick Vessels, without any
previous digestion. Either Juice is supposed to come from the Chyle fresh made
in the mothers stomach; what is reposed, or laid up in the Breast, is more
thick and white, by reason of the more thin or open strainer, and coction in
the greater Glandulas; on the contrary, it happens in the Womb ootherwise,
where the Glandulas are smaller, and the Straining more close. But there is a
great disagreement among Authors, concerning the passages, by which this humor
is carried, both in the Breasts, and into the Cake of the Womb. Some contend,
that Milk only is begotten of the Blood, more plentifully cocted in the
Glandulas, which yet, by reason of the immense dispense of Milk, which consists
not with the Blood, this seems not probable. Others affirm, that the Chyle, or
Milkie humor, is immediately conveyed from the Viscera of Concoction, through
occult passages, without any alteration, into either receptacles. But in the
mean time, while these passages lie open, it seems indeed to me more likely,
that from the meat taken into the Mothers Stomach, a portion of the Chyle
thence made, is presently supped up into the Veins, which having obtained the
vehicle of the Blood, before it be assimilated by it, is said up in the
Glandulas, destinated here and there for the receiving of it, being carried by
the Arteries, and lastly separated from the mass of Blood; for as it appears,
that drink being plentifully taken, presently passes through the whole mass of
Blood, and is rendered by Urine like water: and as old Ulcers, by means of the
Blood coming between, prey upon the nutritious humor, from the whole Body, and
pour it forth under the shape of a putrified matter, Why may not the alible
Juice in like manner, being strained by the Collander of the Glandulas, before
it has endued the color of Blood, go into a Milkie humor? This indeed seems
more probable, because, whilst the Milk is carried from the Womb into the
Breasts, and on the contrary, passing through the mass of Blood, it is wont to
stir up a perturbation through the whole, with a feverish intemperance;
besides, in the first days, after the Birth, when the Glandulas do less rightly
perform the office of secretion: Beasts, who have not the Lochia, give a bloody
Milk, which is drawn forth of their Udders, that is, mixed with Blood, by reason
of the plenty of it flowing forth together.

Secondly, As to what belongs to the Menstrua being suppressed, in the time of
being with Child, and the Lochia plentifully coming away, after being
Delivered, we say that after the Conception of the Child, the Menstrua ought to
be suppressed by Divine Designation, for that the flowing of them often causes
abortion; then, because the Vessels are filled by a continual stilling forth of
the alible juice into the parts of the Womb, the mass of the Blood does not
arise into swellings up to be allayed by the menstruous Flux. For the same
reason, Women for the most part, have not their courses so long as they give
suck. Perhaps in some, endued with a more hot Blood, the monthly courses flow,
both whilst they are Big-bellied, and in the time of their giving suck, but
that more rarely, and is wont not to happen without trouble; yet in the mean
time, the Menstrua being suppressed, during the time of being with Child,
because much less of the nutritious humor is expended at that time for Milk,
they much more deprave the Blood, than the same being restrained at the time of
suckling the Child, are wont to do: yea, from them being long suppressed, in
the former condition, an, as it were, envenomed taint is impressed on the mass
of Blood, which, unless it be purged forth by the daily Flux of the Lochia,
presently after being brought to Bed, produces grievous, and almost malignant
Distempers. Wherefore, that I may give my opinion of the flowing of the Lochia,
I say, that this bleeding proceeds immediately from the Vessels being broken,
by which the Afterbirth did stick to the Womb, and that by this way, the
excrementitious Blood and humors, being partly heaped up about the Womb during
the time of being with Child, and partly flowing from the whole mass of the
Blood, are evacuated, viz. whilst the Womb at first intumified in its bulk,
falls down presently after the Birth, and is contracted into a lesser space,
the Blood is plentifully pressed forth, from the Vessels opening into it. But
besides, forasmuch as during the suppression of the courses, the bloody mass is
imbued with very fermentative Particles, as soon as after the Birth, the mouths
of the Vessels are opened, forthwith, as it were at the instant of a more large
Flux of monthly courses, the whole Blood grows hot (even as Must or new Wine
upon the opening the Bottle) and endeavors to purge forth the highly
fermentative particles, out of its bosom, by the going away of the Lochia, as
it were the flowring: And therefore, besides the Blood, which in the first
days, oftentimes flows pure, by reason of the fresh opening of the Vessels,
afterward is sifted forth matter very much discolored, viz. livid and green,
and this very stinking, This kind of Flux is wont to continue, at least for 14
days, yea, in some for a month; and if that by reason of any error, it be
stopped before the mass of Blood be thoroughly purified, by such flowring,
presently a Fever, very dangerous, with horrid provisions of symptoms, is wont
to be induced: of which we shall speak anon in its proper place.

The third consideration, previous to the Doctrine of Fevers, belonging to
Women in Childbed, is chiefly about the Womb it self; to wit, how it is
affected after Childbearing, and what influence it has on other parts of the
Body. As to the first, there are chiefly two accidents, upon which the acute
Diseases of Women in Childbed very much depend, viz. First, The falling down
of the Womb, or the reduction of it, from the bulk of ingravidation, to its
natural site and magnitude: Secondly, the solution of the unity, within its
cavity, by reason of the breaking of the connection, or tying to the cake of it,
or Afterbirth. When the Child, with what wraps it about, is put forth,
presently the sides of the Womb it self, before very much amplified or
enlarged, do mutually close, and by the help of the Fibers, leisurely contract
themselves into a narrower space; by reason of this kind of contraction, the
Blood and Corruptions, or matter, are plentifully pressed forth, from the
Vessels and Pores of the Womb, and are thrust forth with the Lochia. But
sometimes it happens, by reason of some preternatural things contained in the
Womb, as part of the secondine or after Birth, a Mole or piece of Flesh,
clodders of Blood, etc. also, if there happen after a painful Birth, a
Contusion or great Dilaceration, that the Womb cannot rightly draw it self
together, but by an inverse motion of the Fibers, ascends upwards, and is
lifted up into a bulk; also the membranes being affected with a Convulsion, it
self is still tormented with torments, as if it were yet in Travel; which kind
of Distempers, if they long continue, by reason of the Orifite of the Womb
being tied together, with the Convulsive motion, the Lochia are oftentimes
stopped also: from hence grievous symptoms follow, and very often the Fever is
either first excited, or it happens, being for some other cause induced, to be
rendered far more dangerous. Secondly, as to the solution of the unity, from the
cake of the Womb being broken, it comes to pass, that the Birth, either at its
just time, or precipitous, being too much hastened; then the secundine is cast
forth, either whole, or being torn, or pulled away, part of it being left
behind, it is cut off as it were in half. If the Child be born at its just
time, and the Birth, with what inwraps it, comes away from the cavity of the
Womb, as ripe fruit from a Tree, whole, and without violence, the mouths of the
Vessels are somewhat unlocked, and the Lochia moderately flow; but from hence
no grievous symptom is to be feared: but if the Child, not being yet ripe for
the Birth, is pulled away, or breaks forth as it were by force, although the
Cake, with the membrane is pulled away whole, yet the Vessels being torn, a
greater hemorrhage or bleeding, and at length an Ulcerous disposition follows,
the little mouths of the Vessels spewing forth a stinking matter. If that part,
or the whole secundine sticks to the sides of the Womb, after the Birth, it
there putrifies, and sends forth very stinking matter or corruption, and stirs
up wicked distempers: oftentimes the Orifice of the Womb is shut up, and
retains within gobbets of clodder'd Blood, little pieces of Membranes, or
Flesh, which putrefying, by reason of the heat, impoyson the Blood and humors,
flowing together to that place, by Circulation, from the whole body; also, by a
troublesome itching or provocation, they stir up the parts of the Womb, being
so very sensible, into Convulsions.

When therefore hurt is brought to the Womb, from Childbearing, after the
aforesaid ways, the same is quickly communicated to other parts, not without
trouble to the whole body; which thing indeed is wont to be done by a double
means. For first, this happens, because the Lochia being hindered from being
thrust forth, presently restagnate or flow back upon the mass of Blood, and
infect it as it were with a virulent taint: moreover, from the contents
putrefying in the Womb, either the substance it self of the matter, or the
Particles coming away from the cadaverous substance, are mingled with the
Blood, and nervous juice, passing through that place, and quickly infect their
whole liquors. Secondly, hysterical Distempers, are more largely extended, by
reason of the notable consent, which happens between the Womb and the Brain,
with the Fibers and Membranes of the whole body, by the means of the nervous
passage: for when the extremities of the Nerves, planted about the parts of the
Womb, are driven into Cramps and Convulsive motions, by reason of the presence
of some hurtful humor, the Convulsions there received, presently creep more
largely upwards, by the endeavors and circumduction of the Nerves, toward the
Brain; and so it happens, to the Viscera to be successively inflated, and
cruelly haled together, and the Brain it self at length to be pierced, and its
functions to be as it were overwhelmed: hence, from the convulsive motions,
arising about the Womb, an inflation of the Belly, and hypochondria, a
rumbling, vomiting, sobbing, and streightness of the Praecordia, difficult
breathing, a sense of choking, and oftentimes a stupor, and want of speech, or
at least some of these are excited: nor does the Tragedy to easily leave, but
that also the Brain being hurt, by the continuance of the distemper, by that
means, the evil is retorted upon other parts, that oftentimes the whole nervous
stock is compelled into irregularities of motions; For what commonly is said to
be done by vapors, and the distemper, called the ascent of vapors, creeping
from the nether parts, to the upper, is nothing else than the parts of the
Membranes, and nervous passages, being successively driven into Convulsions.
Further, in these sort of distempers, the hurt action does not always begin, or
is at first perceived, in that region or place where the hurt is inflicted,
neither do the passions which are called hysterical, proceed only from the
Womb; for sometimes, the trouble is immediately brought from the Brain, or the
Convulsions and Contractions begin in the extreme parts, and sometimes the
extremities of the Nerves, somewhere in the Viscera, as the Stomach, Spleen,
Reins, no less than the Womb, are haled; in which, irregularities being arisen,
they are continued into the neighboring part, and from thence to the Brain:
From whence again, the Convulsions are reflected to other parts, and not seldom
through the whole Body. Just so the business in Childbearing Women, and with
others in Fevers, as I have often observed; to wit, some by reason of their
Womb being evilly affected, but others by reason of a Feverish matter fixed in
the Brain, by a critical metastasis or translation, fall into passions like to
the hysterical. And these things being rightly prepensed, concerning the
praevious provision, in the Fevers of Women in Childbed, there is not any
thing that we should stick at in the entrance more, so that we take notice that
the bodies of Women lying in, (especially those who are feeble, and of a more
tender constitution) are debilitated, chiefly after a difficult and hard
Labor; so that, by reason of this occasion only, they easily conceive
feverish intemperatures, and being brought in by this or any other means, they
are hardly able to bear them. We will next speak of the Fevers themselves,
with which Women Lying in are wont to be sick, of which Distempers there are
commonly recounted as it were three kinds, viz. the Milkie Fever, the Putrid,
the Symptomatic, or of that manner by a certain borrowed symptom, but is
chiefly marked with the Pleurisy, Squinancy or the Smallpox: of which we will
discourse in order.

The Milkie Fever.
WE have already said, that as yet it was uncertain of what matter Milk was
immediately made, and by what passages it is carried into the Breasts, moreover
when this part appears not at all to anatomical inspection, I am of the
opinion, that the Milkie Chyme, being made out of aliments in the Bowels, and
from thence confused to the Blood for nourishing juice, is presently again, for
the most part of it, separated from its mass by the help of the Glandulas in
the Womb, or in the Breasts, that it might supply the Child with nutriment,
either in the Mothers Belly, or in her bosom by the Breasts. In the time of
going with Child, although the greatest part of this is derived to the Womb, yet
in the last months, a little quantity of it is laid up in the Breasts; but
about the third or fourth day, after being brought to bed, the Milk is more
plentifully carried into the Breasts, and as it were with a certain force, that
it quickly fills them to a stretching them forth, and begins to be troublesome.
At this time, Women lying in (tho not all, yet most) are wont to be troubled
with a feverish intemperature, with thirst, heat, and an inquietude of the
whole Body, they complain of a pain very troublesome in the Back and Shoulders,
of a fullness and burning of the Breasts; and unless the Milk be diligently
drawn forth, it being too much congested or heaped up, oftentimes brings forth
an inflammation, with an Imposthume following of it in the Breasts. This Fever,
whilst the Lochia are in good order, hardly lasts three days, but that about
that space it is wont to be allayed, a plentiful sweating arising of its own
accord: yet this intemperature being excited by the coming of the Milk, is
somewhat increased and continued longer, if that the Milk entering the Breasts
in abundance, be not milked forth, but is again repelled from thence; for by
its departure, as well as by its coming, a perturbation is wont to happen in
the whole Body, with thirst and heat, which also more certainly comes to pass
if it happens to be driven away violently, by repelling Topics. But being
driven by their help from the Breasts, or departing of its own accord, it is
thrust forth, with the Lochia, in the form of a whitish humor, and a sweat, or
more plentiful transpiration, exterminates the Relics of the Disease. If that
with this kind of intemperance, brought in by reason of the commotion of the
Milk, the Lochia be stopped, or errors in eating and drinking be committed, or
any other evident cause should happen, that may increase the fervor of the
Blood, very often the Milkie Fever, presently acquiring worse symptoms,
changes into a putrid, or rather malignant Fever.

The cause, or formal reason of the aforesaid Fever (whilst the way of the
Milk lies hid) may be only proposed, from an hypothesis, and as it were a
certain Augury; for being supposed, that this milky humor is carried to the
Breasts immediately, by a peculiar passage, from the Viscera of concoction,
without any commerce with the Blood, this feverish Distemper arises, for that
the Breasts being filled with Milk, and greatly distended, the sanguineous
Vessels are so compressed, that they do not easily transmit the Blood flowing
thither; from whence, the Blood being hindered in its circuit, begins to
tumultuate through its whole mass, and the Spirits being inordinately moved, and
wholly confused, it conceives a fervor, such as being induced by a stopping,
Surfeit, Inflammation, or Wound, constitutes ordinarily the simple Synochus; but
if the matter of the Milk (as it is not improbable) passes through the Blood,
this Fever of Women in Childbed, seems to spring from hence, that when this
Latex is transferred to the Breasts, having left the Womb, a great portion of
it subsists in the mass of the Blood, which indeed, for that it exceeds the due
provision of the nourishing juice, and so cannot be wholly assimilated, and
besides abounds in heterogeneous parts, and as it were something extraneous,
and not mingleable with the Blood, creates a trouble, therefore for the
carrying it forth of doors, and putting it forth, this three days feverish
Distemper is employed: For when the milky Chile, being used to be separated
about the Womb, by and by, after being Delivered of a Child, that wax of
excretion is hindered, restagnating into the mass of Blood, it is there first of
all heaped up more plentifully, than that the whole may go into nourishment, or
be received into the Breasts: wherefore, the Milk, not only in its passage to
the Breasts, but also in its return toward the Womb, brings forth the Fever,
to wit, by reason of either passage through the Blood.

But however the cause of this Disease is ordained, it matters little or
nothing toward the Cure; for this is wholly committed to Nature, and so long
as the Lochia are in good order, it proceeds for the most part happily, without
any Physical help: because, after the growing hot of the Blood, for three or
four days, either a plentiful sweat, or a more free transpiration, cures this
Distemper, to wit, either the Particles of the Milky humor, degenerate in the
assimulating, or the adust recrements, remaining after the deflagration of the
Blood, or both of them at once supplying the food or tinder of the Fever, are
by little and little subdued, and evaporated out of doors, which being
excluded, the Blood becoming free from the extraneous mixture, quickly recovers
its pristine condition; yet in the mean time, certain vulgar Rules are wont to
be observed, about the admission of the Milk into, or the driving away of the
same, out of the Breasts. If the Milk too plentifully springs into the Breasts,
that their inflammation, as also the immoderate growing hot of the Blood, may be
prevented, at that time, a more thin and sparing diet, to wit, no flesh broths,
and also in a less quantity, is to be ordered: also the Breasts are to be
frequently drawn. If it be not commodious for the Mother to suckle her Child,
it is usual after the first or third day of her being Delivered to cover all
the Breasts over with Sear-Cloaths moderately binding (as the Plaster of
Red-lead, ande.) for so the spongious substance of the Glandulas, is somewhat
constrained, or closed together, whereby they less readily receive the milky
humor flowing thither, yet this kind of Remedy ought to be cautiously
administered, lest if the Milk be wholly excluded, or driven out of the Breast
too abruptly, restagnating suddenly in the Blood, it induces its disorder, the
prodromus or forerunner of the Putrid or Malignant Fever: of which it remains
that we speak next.

The Putrid Fever of Women in Childbed.
WOmen Lying in, from the fault of an evil affected Body, as by the Contagion
of a received Pestilential Air, are found to be too obnoxious to the Putrid, or
rather Malignant Fever; but all do not a like receive the Infection of this
sort of Disease; for poor people, Laboring Women, Country Women, and others
accustomed to hard Labor, as also Viragoes, and Whores, which are brought to
Bed clandestinely, bring forth without any great difficulty, and then, after a
little time, leaving their Beds, return to their wonted Labors: But more rich
Women, tender and fair, and most living a sedentary life, as if participating
after a more grievous manner of the Divine Malediction, bring forth in pain,
and then presently after the Birth they are subject to difficult and dangerous
chances; the reason of which seems to lie in this, that those who are used to
much exercise, continually agitate and eventilate the Blood, and therefore
fewer infectious taints from the monthly Flowers being suppressed, do gather
together for the matter of a Disease; moreover, laborious and nimble Women, as
they have their nervous parts more firm, therefore they are less subjected to
convulsive motions, and to the passions commonly called hysterical: on the
contrary, in delicate, and idle Women, the mass of Blood, in the time of their
going with Child, becomes very impure and fermentisible; besides, because they
have the system of the Nerves, and the Brain soft and weak, upon every light
occasion, they suffer distractions of the animal Spirits, and inordinate
motions of the nervous parts. And here, by the way, it is to be noted, that
Women more than men, and that some of the same Sex before others, are sensible
of the affections called hystorical, not so much by the default of their Womb,
as for that they are of more weak constitution of Brain, and nervous stock; for
in those so affected, the passions of anger, sadness, fear, as also all
troublesome and more strong objects, easily pervert the dispositions and
functions of those parts, which, when they are once hurt, for the most part
afterward, are accustomed to those irregularities. But we will return from
whence we have digressed. The Fever but now proposed, is wont to infest Women
Lying in, indeed at various times, and by reason of diverse occasions, now
presently after the Birth, especially if it be difficult and laborious, now it
arises in the first, now the second, third, or fourth week; yet the sooner it
begins, the more safely it is wont to be cured. The Type or Figure of this
Disease, is performed almost after this manner. After a previous indisposition,
an open feaverishness, for the most part with a shivering, or horror,
constitutes the first assault, which is followed with heat, and afterward
succeeds a sweat: perhaps, for a day or two, they have various reciprocal fits
of heat and cold; then the Blood being wholly inkindled, the Lochia, if not
before suppressed, either flow smally, or are wholly stopped: If the Disease be
acute, and of a swift motion, it comes to its height on the third or fourth
day, then an intense heat, with a very troublesome thirst, a vehement pulse,
and quick pertinacious wakings, a great inquietude of the whole Body, that they
are continually tossing themselves in their Beds hither and thither, a thick
Urine, and high colored, and other most grievous symptoms, are wont to trouble
them: whilst the Fever is after this manner at its height no Crisis is to be
expected; for I never saw this Disease cured by a critical sweat, but that the
business was still very precipitously acted, as after the Blood was grown hot
for a little time, presently the adust matter being translated to the Brain,
most dangerous and heavy inordinations of it, and the whole nervous stock
forthwith come upon them; for most often are stirred up, convulsive motions of
the Tendons, wonderful distentions, and inflations about the Viscera, like to
the hysterical passions; then sometimes, also follow a frenzy, or dilerium,
not seldom a stupefaction, and speechlessness; the strength is suddenly cast
down almost in all, without any manifest cause, the Pulse becomes weak, and
unequal; and the sick are suddenly precipitated to death: If that any perhaps
escape, either by the return of the Flux of the Lochia, or a Lask, coming upon
it, they hardly recover but of a long time: I have known in some, purple spots
to have appeared, and certainly in many, symptoms that respect either the Blood
or nervous juice, which argue no light Malignity.

We will distinguish the causes of this Fever, after the ordinary manner, into
Procatartic, Evident and Conjunct. Those of the first sort, upon which the
malignity, and the greatest perniciousness of the Disease depend, are two, viz.
first, a depraved disposition of the Blood, from the long suppression of the
monthly Flux. Secondly, after the Birth, the evil affections of the Womb, from
the dangerous Labors of Women, (who undergo the Divine Malediction appointed
them) from the Menstrua being long suppressed, the Blood not only swells up,
and its Sulphurous parts being too much carried forth, are rendered more apt
for burning, but besides, the mass of the Blood is imbued with very
fermentative Particles, so that (as has been already hinted) as if it were
touched with a venomous infection, presently growing fervent, it is disposed
toward putrefaction, and corruptive disorders; and besides, forthwith
impoysons the nervous Liquor, and renders it infestuous to the Brain and the
whole nervous stock. These kind of evils, being impressed on the Blood, ought
to be purged forth, by the Flux of the Lochia; but if after the Birth, the Womb
be out of order, the Lochia are not only stopped, and so a purifying of all the
Blood is hindered, but besides, stinking corruptions or defilements, are thence
bestowed on the Blood, and grievously infect it: Also, by reason of convulsive
motions, begun about the Womb, and from thence continued to other parts,
inordinations are stirred up in the Blood and juices, which oftentimes
conspire, either the production, or the acerbation or growing worse, of the
Fever.

The evident causes, which induce an actual effervescency, either to the Blood,
having gotten an ill disposition, or invert the vices of the whole Body to the
Womb, are after a diverse sort. A painful Labor, a solution of the unity about
the Womb, a bruise, a retention of preternatural things, an ulcerous
disposition, and very many other accidents, which are induced by a certain
necessity, may do this. But the occasions, that are at the dispose of the
Patients, and easily to be avoided, which are wont to excite this kind of
Fever, are chiefly two, viz. an ill manner of Diet, and the taking of cold. It
is an usual thing, to give to weak Women, after being Delivered, on the first
or second day, the flesh of living Creatures, or Broths made of flesh meats,
and other foods, very improportionate to their dispositions, from whence
presently arise an indigestion, and great trouble in the Bowels, and a
feverish distemper in the Blood, by reason of a more rich nutritious juice
than ought to be. Besides, the errors in Diet, oftentimes hurt is caused, for
that their Bodies, being so very tender, also by reason of the labors of the
Birth, and bringing forth the Child, the passages are on every side opened,
they are exposed too heedlessly to the cold: for most of them, being impatient
of their Bed, within a day or two, or sooner than they should do, rise out of
it, and put on their Clothes, from whence, presently the Pores of the skin
being suddenly contracted, and the Air being admitted into the parts of the
Womb, transpiration is hindered, and often the Lochia, on the sudden are
stopped, either of which suffices to excite the feverish distemper.

The conjunct cause, or formal reason of this kind of sickness, chiefly
comprehends these three things, to wit, there are present, first, a very
notable discrasie of the Blood, that growing hot, from the Fever being
occasionally induced, it does not equally burn forth, nor leisurely overcome
the adust recrements, and afterward critically thrust them forth; but the
Blood growing hot, is presently loosned in its mixture, and its frame being
unlocked, turns and declines toward corruption; hence, when it grows but a
little cool, the spirits being shaken out of their dominion, are moved into
confusion. In the mean time, the Sulphurous Particles become untamed, and
fierce, wherefore, the strength falls down without any manifest cause, the
Pulse is made weak and disordered; after the deflagration of the Blood, although
the adust recrements are very much heaped up, yet nothing is rightly concocted
or separated, but the sick being greatly oppressed in Nature, tho they
continually sweat, receive nevertheless oftentimes no ease from thence; but the
feverish matter, which ought to be thrust forth, being transmitted into the
head, and nervous stock, induces there most grievous perturbations of the
animal regiment. Secondly, the Tragedy of this Disease owes no small part of
it, to the nervous juice being presently made sharp, and so improportionate to
the Brain, and its Appendix; for this being infected, from the taint contracted
from the Blood, does not gently water, or pleasantly blow up its subjects, but
notably hale or pull those tender parts, (as when an infusion of vitriol is
poured upon a Worm) and irritates or provokes them into convulsions, and into
motions, as if of dancing or suddenly leaping forth, and sometimes wholly
overturns their functions; hence comes contractures, grievous convulsions,
dilerium, wakings, and sometimes stupification, and the sleepy Disease, upon
Women Lying in. Thirdly, whilst these things are done, oftentimes a third band
of symptoms infest the sick, to wit, for that the Womb, being hurt by some
evil, moves it self disorderly, and is struck with a Convulsion, according to
these or those parts, from thence by and by, convulsive motions invade, by the
membranes, and nervous passages, the whole Region of the Abdomen; wherefore,
the Viscera and Hypocondria are blown up, belchings, and grievous vomitings are
stirred up, then the Distemper creeping upwards, and possessing the nervous
parts of the Thorax, a difficult breathing, and unequal, a palpitation of the
heart, a sense of choking in the throat, by reason of the Muscles being there
drawn backward, and other symptoms, through the whole Body are excited, the
same evil being at last carried to the Brain.

The Fevers of Women in Childbed almost never want danger; but sometimes it
happens, about the beginning, that they are cured by a slender Diet, and by the
Flux of the Lochia being restored; but if the feverish distemper does root it
self more deeply, that the whole Blood is inkindled, and immoderately grows
hot, the Prognostic ought not to be esteemed of a light Omen; and there will
be a greater reason of danger, if besides the heat being suffused all over, the
sick are troubled with a frequent shivering, if they are affected or molested
with a great disquietness, and wakings, with sudden concussions of the Body, or
a contracture of the Tendons: or if, thirdly, they complain on the fourth day,
of a tingling of their ears, with a great repletion or fullness of the head, you
may from thence collect the evil to grow worse, viz. a translation of the
feverish and hurtful matter to the Brain; nor is it less to be feared, if they
have on them an oppression, and weight of the Praecordia, that the sick cannot
breath freely, nor draw their breath deep, and from the bottom of their breast,
but only from the top, and that frequently, and sighingly, and that they move
themselves restlesly hither and thither: For this argues the Blood to stagnate
in its circulation, about the Heart and Lungs, and also to be apt to grow into
clodders, and to be coagulated: that if yet worse distempers of the Brain and
nervous stock follow, and the Pulse should become weak and unequal, you may
pronounce the business almost deplorable; but if (as sometimes tho it more
rarely happens) after the Fever being inkindled, and grievously threatening,
either the Flux of the Lochia returns, or a Diarrhea with ease succeeds, some
hope of health may be admitted, tho the same be at the last cast.

Concerning the Cure of these kind of Fevers, there lies a very great task
upon the Physician, because any Physic is esteemed with the vulgar not only
unprofitable, but also hurtful for Women in Childbed; wherefore, Physicians
are rarely sent for, unless when there is no place left for remedies, and the
opportunity of all profitable means be wholly past: If that perchance they
should be present, about the beginning of the Disease, it will not be easy to
procure health to the sick by vulgar Remedies; but whatever they should
attempt, unless it should bring help, it would be said by the Women, and others
about the person, to be deadly, and the only cause of her death; that in truth
there is wont to happen to us, less of profit, or more of ignominy, about the
Cure of no other Disease, as in this.

But the method of curing (even as in Contagious Diseases) ought to be
instituted twofold; to wit, Prophylactic or Preventive, and Therapeutic or
Curative: The former of these, delivers precepts and cautions, whereby Women
Lying in, may he preserved from the assault of Fevers: the other suggests
Curative intentions, whereby the sick (if it may be done) may at length recover
health.

1. Although this Fever be somewhat Malignant, it is not caught by Contagion,
and there is no fear of the sicks receiving outwardly any invenomed taint;
notwithstanding, all Women in Childbed, have an innate mine of virulency, and
from the evil of this, as it were the tinder of most high Malignity, they ought
to beware; wherefore, they need an exact ordering, to wit, whereby after the
Birth, the impurities of the Blood and humors, may be rightly purged forth,
without danger of a Fever; also, that the evil affections of the Womb, may be
healed, and that the strength being broken and debilitated, by the Labor, may
be restored after its due manner. For these ends, these three things are
chiefly to be inculcated, for prescripts by Physicians. First, I judge it
necessary, that a most exact manner of Diet be commanded to Women in Childbed;
to wit, that they be wholly fed with Oatmeal Candle, made sometimes of Beer,
and sometimes of Water and White Wind mixed together, also with Panada, and
other light nourishers, for a week at least; because they are much emptied,
therefore it may be lawful for them to sup often, but nothing of solid or more
strong food is to be given. For I have diligently observed that these Fevers
have been oftenest induced, by the eating too soon flesh, or strong Broths or
Food. Forasmuch as Women Lying in, ought to be handled, not only as those that
are grievously wounded, but as those that have got a feverish indisposition,
from a disturbed disposition and temper of the Blood: For with them, the Blood
being already too much carried forth, and as it were touched with an impure
infection, most quickly catches Flame, by the access or means of any
Sulphurous thing. Secondly, after Diet, the care will be, lest the Pores be
shut up, by the incautiously taking cold from without, or that the Lochia
should be stopped: for upon the least occasion, the manner of transpiration
being changed, the Blood first growing hot, conceives disorders: also the Womb
being touched by the blast of Air, contracts it self, and shuts up the mouths
of the Vessels, whereby the Lochia flow forth less: wherefore, for five days at
least, after being Delivered, I would have Women wholly to keep their Beds. I
know that it is a common custom, to raise them from Bed on the third day, but by
that means I have known many that have fallen into Fevers; and in truth, if we
desire to keep Women in Childbed from all danger, the safest means will be,
that they may be kept long in their Beds. Thirdly, concerning preservation, the
intent remains, that by causing a gentle provocation of the Blood, in Women
Lying in, the Flux of the Lochia may be continued: for this end, Midwives are
wont (if after a difficult Labor they fear that evil) to give them Sperma
Ceti, or powder of Irish Slate, or Saffron steeped in White Wind: Moreover, to
make them Oat-meal Candle, that may more fuse the Blood, of Water, and White
and Rhenish Wine mixed together, in which they boil, or in posset drink also,
Marigold Flowers, leaves of Penyroyal, or Mugwort, there are many other kinds
of administrations extant, about the ordering Women in Childbed, which being
commonly known, I willingly pass over here.

The Cure of the subsequent Fever of Women in Childbed, is far from the usual
method in Putrid Fevers: for in this, it is not to be expected, that the Blood
being touched with a feverish burning, should by degrees burn forth, and the
same should be separated by a Crisis, but rather (as it is done in a Malignant
Fever) as soon as the Blood grows immoderately hot, it is convenient for it to
be moved by gentle Diaphoretick Remedies, and its heterogeneous and impure
mixtures to be carried forth of doors; wherefore, among the common people it is
a custom (and that not bad) to give to feverish Women Lying in, sudorificks
presently: by this means, the Blood being eventilated, its effervency is
allayed; also, by reason of its agitation, the Lochia apt to be restrained, are
provoked into a Flux. There is great difference among Authors, from whence the
beginnings of these kind of Fevers ought to be computed, viz. whether from the
Birth it self, or from the first sense of growing feverish? however it matters
little whether it be after this or that manner: For since this Fever runs not
the usual stadia or courses of the Putrid, neither has a Crisis, nor wholly
admits the use of Cathartic or Purging Remedies, we need not be solicitous so
much for the days, concerning its period and mensuration. But yet, as to the
Curative indications, it will be of use only to distinguish what is to be done
in the beginning, increase, and end of this Disease: also, what we ought to
endeavor whilst there is some strength remaining, as also what, when it is
oppressed, and very much dejected.

When therefore any Woman in Childbed is first taken with this Fever (whose
assault is known from the milky Fever, because for the most part it begins
with a shivering) you must presently let it be your work, that the more
plentiful sustenance may be drawn away from the burning Blood, and as I have
already admonished, that the flesh of living Creatures, and Broths made of
them, be utterly forbidden; yet in the mean time, all cold things, and that are
endued with a styptic or binding virtue, are equally to be avoided; for these
fix the Blood, and bind it too much, and hinder its very requisite Purgation,
both by the Lochia, and by transpiration through the skin. But rather, though
the Fever be urgent, give them decoctions, powders, and confections of things
moderately hot: of which sort are, (as is already said) decoctions, or
Distilled Waters of the Flowers of Marigoids, the Leaves of Pennyroyal,
Mugwort, the roots of Scorzonera, also Bezoartic Powders, Spirits of
Hartshorn, fixed salts of Herbs, etc. If the Lochia should be stopped, that
their Flux may be again provoked, must be endeavored every way: To the moving
of this, conduce frictions and ligatures about the Thighs and Legs; sometimes
Cupping-Glasses, or Blisters about the Thighs or Hips, also in the soles of the
Feet: also, sometimes the opening a Vein in the Ankle is convenient, in the
mean time a fomentation of the hysterical decoction, is to be applied about the
Pubis, or the Caul of a Weather or Sheep, taken out warm, may be laid to the
bottom of the Belly; and experience manifests, that sometimes injections into
the Womb are profitable: If the Belly yields not, it may be gently brought
down, with a violet suppository so called, or an emollient Clyster; of more
strong provocations you must take heed, because in Women Lying in, even as in a
Malignant Fever, from a copious dejection, with loss of Spirits, Life is
quickly lost. If with the suppression of the Lochia, there be a notable
perturbation of the Blood, with vomiting, thirst, and wakings, I have often
known, Laudanum mixed with Saffron, given with happy success. Instead of a
cooling Julep, this kind of mixture is convenient, viz. take of water of
Pennyroyal, and Balm, each three ounces, of hysterical water two ounces, of the
Syrrop of Mugwort three ounces and an half, of the tincture of Saffron two
drams, of Castor tied in a rag, and hung in the glass, one scruple, mingle
these, and let them drink of this three or four spoonfuls oftentimes in a day.

2. If notwithstanding the use of these Remedies the Fever grows still worse,
and by degrees is increased with worser symptoms, that besides the disorders of
the Blood, the Brain and nervous parts begin to be touched, Medicines, tho many
of every kind may be tried, do little; yea, in this case the indications are
almost the same, with those made use of in the Plague it self: forasmuch as the
Lochia being for a good while suppressed, they cannot easily be reduced, or
scarcely at all, in the great confusion of the Blood and humors, therefore it
is convenient quickly to move a sweating, to wit, that the corruptions,
impressed on the Blood and nervous juice, and restagnating from the Womb, may
be carried forth some how, by sweat, and insensible transpiration. Therefore
here, Powders, and Confections of Bezoar, Spirit of Hartshorn, or of Soot,
tinctures of Corals or Pearls help. I have sometimes seen, by the help of those
kind of Medicines, in a desperate case, when the Pulse, and other symptoms have
appeared a little better, some small hopes to show themselves; yet Cure rarely
to follow: but when the use of these Cordials were left off, the sick with a
weak Pulse, and a Looseness presently arising, have been precipitated to Death.

3. When yet the business of the sick proves still worse, when the Fever being
increased, the Pulse is weak and unequal, and frequent horrors, and convulsive
motions in the whole body, with a delirium, and stupefaction infest them; then
the Physician having first made a Prognostication of Death, may insist upon a
few Remedies, and those only Cordials, and must wholly abstain from
blood-letting, scarification, blistering, or the use of Cupping-glasses: for
such administrations beget only an odium and blame, that by so doing, we are
esteemed by some Women, as wicked and cruel.

The Symptomatic Fevers of Women in Childbed.
THE Acute Diseases of Women in Childbed, show themselves not only according
to the Figure of the aforesaid Fever, but sometimes they are beset with some
signal symptoms, to wit, the Squinancy, Pleurifie, inflammation of the Lungs,
Dysentery, Smallpox, or of some other kind; and at that time, they get the
appellations of those Distempers. It will not be here seasonable, to repeat at
large, what belongs to the essences and natures of each: but I shall briefly
show, what these sicknesses, being complicated with the distempers of Women
Lying in, contain peculiarly, as to the Causes or Cures.

All these symptoms, we suppose to proceed, from a certain Coagulation of the
Blood, and from thence its extravasation: But whilst the Blood is extravasated,
or put forth of the Vessels in one part, its efflux, however natural, and
critical, is hindered in another: wherefore it is dangerous, lest whilst the
Blood begins to be coagulated, either in a particular or accustomed nest of
Coagulation, or universally in its whole mass, the flowing of the Lochia be
stopped, which in truth for the most part happens, and therefore these
Distempers, for the most part, are deadly to Women in Childbed: yet the cause
of their Death, for the most part, happens with some difference, viz. in the
Small Pox, the flowing of the Lochia, draws inwardly the malignity, begun to be
carried forth outwardly, and forthwith compels the mass of Blood, and the heart
it self, to be impoysoned, with its evil; and therefore in the Small Pox, these
purgings of the Womb, are convenient to be stopped: But in the Pleurisy,
Squinancy, and the rest, when the provocative of the Disease, being fixed here
or there, in a particular place, draws to it self the impurities of the Blood,
which ought to be separated or sifted forth by the Lochia, and derives it
straight from the Womb, for that reason it increases the impurity of the Blood.
The Lochia being stopped in the Small Pox, by the more universal manner or way
of excretion, may be shut forth of doors, with the venomous Particles of the
Disease, which thing indeed does not succeed in the rest, by reason of the
minute, and more sparing manner of excretion.

Of these, the Squinancy, Pleurisy, and Inflammation of the Lungs, by reason,
both of the great similitude of the Cause, and analogy of the Cure, may be
considered together: when any Woman Lying in is distempered with any of these,
it is to be supposed, that besides the Infection, gathered together in the time
of being Big-bellied, there happens a certain sourish disposition of the Blood,
by the means of which, whilst that it self grows feaverishly hot, certain
Particles of it, being fused with the sourness enter into congelation, in this
or that part, like Milk growing sour, and then to be coagulated: The Blood
being there frozen or congealed, and hindered in its circuit, stops the passage
of the rest; but the Blood being obstructed in its motion, buts against the
impediment, and so being heaped up about it, and driven forth of the Vessels,
grows into a tumor: from thence presently, whatsoever is contained in its
mass, that is heterogeneous, and to be sifted forth, is laid aside into the
distempered part, as it were a sink: wherefore, the corruptions of the Blood,
that ought to be purged forth by the Womb, are derived from thence toward the
nest of this Disease, which, when they cannot be sufficiently purged forth by
this way, both more remarkably corrupt the Liquor of the Blood, and render the
particular distemper, viz. the Squinancy, Pleurisy, or any other more hard to
be cured.

For the Cure of these kind of complicated distempers, presently from the very
beginning, it should be endeavored, that the Blood being fixed somewhere, and
begun to be extravasated, may be restored to Circulation, that it may not
impostumate; because, very rarely, Women Lying in, are cured of these
Symptomatic Fevers, by an Imposthume, or spitting forth of the corrupt matter:
Wherefore, internal Remedies, which fuse the Blood, and free it from
Coagulation, are to be made use of; of which sort are chiefly Diaphoretics full
of a volatile Salt, as Spirit of Hartshorn, Soot, Urine, also the Salts
themselves; in like manner Shelly and Bezoartic Powders, Lapis Prunellae
Decoctions and Juleps of Vegetables provoking Urine, or the terms, with all
which ought to be mixed, what by experience are found proper for the distempers
of the Womb: Besides, discussing Remedies, which may drive away the impacted
matter, and disperse it (of which sort are Liniments, Fomentations, and
Cataplasms) are diligently to be applied. In the mean time, the more impetuous
motion, and immoderate effervency of the Blood, are to be removed, and its
purgings, by all the ways possible transferred to the inferior parts. For this
end Frictions, Ligatures, Epispastics, and (if need be) Scarifying about the
Feet and Legs, are to be administered; if the distemper very much growing worse,
a taking away of Blood be indicated, unless there be a great fullness in the
whole Body, and a very acute inflammation in the distempered part; it will be
best to open a Vein in the Foot, or to take away Blood from the hemorrhoid
Veins by Leeches: But if necessity urges, it may be done in the Arm it self; if
after that Letting Blood (if another be admitted) let it be done in the Leg;
but you are to be warned, that in these cases, the opening a Vein is to be
ordered very cautiously, for unless it brings present help, (which I have
rarely known it to do) immediately the Pulse being made more weak, the business
of the sick becomes much worse.

The Dysentery takes its rise almost for the like cause, with the aforesaid
distempers; but in this, because the extravasated Blood is presently poured
forth, nor being retained in the Body, becomes there troublesome, or is any
more corrupted, and as this Flux makes an excretion near the Womb, and does not
afterward dreive it to any other place, there is less of danger to be feared,
from this Disease, than from those aforesaid: yet oftentimes this Disease is
fatal to Women in Childbed, for that indeed, the rather, because things
attempering the Blood, and moderately binding, are ordered for the Dysentery:
for these are found too apt to inhibit the Flux of the Lochia; wherefore in
this case, until the Women Lying in are sufficiently purged by a long Flux, the
Cure of the other Disease is to be omitted, and the fierceness of the symptoms
is to be allayed, only with gentle asswaging things.

The indications of the Small Pox, do not only differ from those above
described, but indeed they are beset with contraries to themselves; for they
require (as has been said) that the Flux of the Lochia should be moderately
staid: yet in the mean time, that the flowring forth of the Blood, and a gentle
sweat ought to be continued; for when in this Disease, the invenomed ferment is
twofold, and the corrupt Particles of the Blood, are carried outwardly in a
twofold way, you must beware, lest that the lesser, and straiter part, should
draw to its door, the whole matter, or more than it were able to send forth:
therefore, lest the Lochia flowing more plentifully, should recall inwardly the
venom, apt to flower outwardly, the manner or way of Diet is somewhat to be
changed, and specially those things which have a poison resisting force, and
are also astringent (as the roots of Tormentil and Bistort) are to be boiled in
the Broths of the sick; also Powders, Juleps, and Opiats, endued with such like
virtue, are convenient to be administered at due intervals: yea, in this case,
by no means, Women should be indulged, that they might eat flesh, or Broth made
of it, or to rise out of their Bed: but the quiet, both of mind and Body, is to
be procured, as much as may be, and a Diet to be ordered of those things, that
move not the Blood, and the business almost wholly to be committed to God and
Nature.

What has already been said, concerning the acute Diseases of Women in
Childbed, may easily be illustrated with Histories and Observations: But
examples which may be brought in this thing, for the greatest part, are
mournful and of an ill chance: because those Fevers for the most part end in
Death. But to describe these kind of sicknesses, does neither confirm the work
of the Physician, nor render approved the method of Medicine, altogether taken
in them; however, because the knowledge of these may make for the better
discovery of this Disease, I shall here propose some singular cases of Women
Lying in, and variety of symptoms; in which, although the forms and means of Cure
more sparingly occur, yet we may have some rules of precaution, of no
contemplable use.

A Gentlewoman in her six and twentieth year of her Age, brought forth her
sixth Child, with very difficult Labor, and not without danger of her Life;
yet presently after, she began to be better; on the second day she eat a whole
Chicken, on the third rose out of her Bed, and sat in a Chair for four hours;
the night following she found her self ill, at which time her Milk came into
her Breasts; which, by the application of Diaculum Plasters, soon vanished;
the next morning she complained of a weariness, and as it were an ulcerous pain
of her whole Body, also of a vomiting, nauseousness, and fullness about the
Ventricle, and Hypochondria: the following night was full of trouble; on the
fifth day she was plainly in a Fever, she felt now a shivering, now a heat,
every where increasing, she nauseated every thing, and was troubled at her
Stomach, moreover being unquiet, and without sleep, the Lochia flowed little,
but a whitish humor (commonly called the Flux of the Milk) came away: In the
evening she had a weight, and as it were a sleepiness about her forehead and
temples, and began to sleep a little; but awaking in half an hour, being
disturbed with Phantasms, she complained of her head, as if increased in bulk,
also of her jaws being set, that she could not open her teeth, and her fists
being strongly clutched, she seemed as if she felt a pricking and stupor, or
numness in her whole Body; her Ventricle and Hypochondria stood still inflated,
and stretched forth; they administered to her Frictions, Ligatures,
Cupping-glasses, and other Remedies, both inward and outward, that might recall
the Lochia, and drive the recrements of the Blood from the head: Her Pulse
being weak, and disordered, would not admit of Letting Blood; Powders, and
Juleps, which might gently move sweating, and fuse the Blood and nervous juice,
and hinder them from restagnating, were diligently given her; yea,
fomentations, now of Woollen Clothes dipped in emollient Decoctions, and now of
warm inwards of living Creatures, were applied to her Belly; in the mean time,
stinking things (such as they use to the Mother Fits) were put to her nose,
which might drive away the impetuousness of the Spirits and Blood, carried into
the head, but these, and other things, being for several hours carefully
performed, she seemed to feel some ease; but still she feared to shut her eyes,
or to settle herself to sleep, for her eye lids being closed, a thousand
Phantasms ran in her mind, with noise and tingling in her whole head: she
continued that night almost without sleep; as soon as she had begun to sleep,
presently being affrighted, and feeling a weight in her Precordia, she was
awaked: on the sixth day about noon, she was troubled with a great shivering,
or rather an horror, with a strong concussion of the whole Body; to which, as
in the fit of an Ague, by and by heat, and then sweat copiously followed: but
from thence, nothing of ease accrued to the sick, for presently after the
sweat, the feverish heat was renewed, and convulsive distempers infested her
more: the night following, with the rest of the symptoms growing worse, first a
Palsy was excited in her tongue, and by and by in her throat, that she could
not speak, and scarce swallow at all: on the seventh day, about the same hour,
a shivering invaded her again, with heat and sweat; then her Pulse being much
weaker, and unequal; also a difficult breathing, and fetching the breath short
and quick, with her Breast lifted up, she knew not them about her: on the
eighth day she died.

There was a manifold occasion of the death of this Gentlewoman, predisposed to
a Fever, by reason of her Big-belly, and which had increased the malignity of
the Disease over and above; for the hurt received by her hard Labor, the
sudden exclusion of the Milk from her Breasts, the eating of flesh, and the
rising too soon our of her bed, happening together, made as it were a
conspiration for the greater evil: The Blood being touched with a feverish
burning, presently conceived inordinations, and snatched into it self the
Lochia, and perhaps other defilements of the Womb, and so by that means
acquired a greater infection, and plainly venomous disposition; the membranes
of the Viscera, being imbrued with the degenerate nervous juice, were struck
either with Convulsive motions, or with Convulsions continued to them from the
Womb; for these kind of inflations, about the Abdomen, and those distentions
are the effects of Convulsions: For although the direct Fibers drawing the member
do oftentimes press it, yet since the Fibers are direct and transverse, and
others placed in a various site, the membranes are pulled together into an
hollowness, by their coming together, the part swells up like a blown bladder,
into whose vacuity the Air being rarefied secondarily carries it self forward:
But it is not the Air (as is commonly said) or a blast there at first heaped
up, that is the cause of the distention. The Blood growing hot in our sick
person, and being quickly filled with an adust and malignant matter, did
endeavor to subdue it, and being unable to put it forth by sweat, forthwith
fixed it in the Brain; the first suffusion of the same matter into the head, by
reason of the animal Spirits being half overthrown, brought in that sense of
her head being much increased in bulk; which thing happened by the like means,
as when the foot being taken with a sleepiness, seems as if it felt much bigger
than it is: But that after some case, the distemper grew worse, by sleep and
closing of her eyes, the reason is, because waking, and the exercise of the
senses, shake off and remove from them, somewhat, the matter besieging the
Brain and Nerves; which notwithstanding being near and in its precincts, sleep
creeping on, is as it were supped up by them, and enters their Bodies more
deeply with the alible juice. But the Blood, although it had plentifully poured
forth its recrements in the Brain, yet did not itself become free; but being
still full, with an impure ballast, it conceived as it were a critical
flowring, and attempted to shake off its burden once or twice (as it is wont
in a great excretion) with a shivering, and with heat and sweat following it,
by which endeavor however nothing was further effected, than that the matter
sticking to the Brain, pierced more deeply into it, and becoming fixed in some
little shoots of the Nerves, took away her speech and swallowing, and
afterward her senses; and the mass of Blood, being by degrees more and more
depraved, at length became unable to sustain Life.

A noble Gentlewoman, being married a little before she was twenty years of
Age, and being with Child, used, during the time, an ill diet, and little or no
exercise; yet falling into Labor, and suffering the torments with
intermission, and frequent case for twelve hours, at length was brought to Bed
of a Son: The Child, with the afterbirth came away, and all things were right
about the Womb: the first and second day she found her self indifferently well,
but on the third, after a light shivering, she began to complain of thirst and
heat; to which a looseness followed, that she had that day four stools: the
following night she was almost without sleep, the feverish distemper remained,
after that, in the same manner for two days; daily she purged three or four
time the Lochia as yet flowed moderately: when on the sixth day, by the
persuasion of the Women, she had took some astringent thing, to moderate the
Flux of her Belly, the purgings of the Womb were almost wholly stayed: at which
time the Fever became more strong, and symptoms as it were hysterical
appeared; for in her Precordia, she had great and frequent oppressions, and was
troubled with a sense of choking in her throat; on the seventh day, the heat
was yet stronger, and her breathing difficult and laborious; but then, by the
prescription of a Physician, at that time first sent for, Blood was taken from
her foot to three ounces, by which she was better for four hours; for a quiet
steep, with a plentiful sweat followed upon it, and the Lochia appeared again
tho in small quantity: In the Evening again, all things grew worse, her
strength being very much lost, her Pulse weaker and unequal; she complained
also of a noise and tingling of her ears, with a fullness of her head, moreover
a leaping up of the tendons in her wrists; also she had sudden concussions of
her wholly Body, yet still her looseness held; to her were administered, by the
prescripts of several Physicians, Cordials, and other Remedies, and kinds of
Administrations carefully, but nothing profited: her Pulse being more weak, and
her strength leisurely wasting, she died on the ninth day, after she was
delivered.

This Fever very much depended upon the vicious provision of the Body, as the
procatartic cause; for I have often observed, that it fares ill with Women
Lying in, who when Big bellied devoured fruit, and any unwholsom trash, and
living without motion or exercise, indulged themselves with ease and rest: the
Blood, by reason of the previous Cachexie, conceived a burning without any
evident cause, as it were of its own accord: But growing hot, laying inwardly
still its recrements, and impurities, caused the Diarrhea: neither yet was its
mass made more pure, by its almost continual excretion, yea, rather being still
more depraved in its mixtion or crasis, the Blood at length wholly departed
from its proper disposition, and became unable to be fermented in the heart,
whereby heat and breath might be every where dispersed: The looseness, excited
by the motion of Nature, was untowardly stopped, especially by the use of
astringent things; for this I have often observed, never to be done without
paying for it; because the Flux of the Belly has cured some that have been ill,
but in this Lady, and in many others (as has abundantly appeared to our
experience) although it did not take away the Fever, yet it freed her from the
more grievous distempers of the Brain and nervous stock: from whence this sick
person was wholly free from a Delirium, nor was struck with Convulsive motions,
till reduced almost to extremity.

The Mother of a Family, and a Gentlewoman, about 36 years of Age or upwards,
being with Child of her seventeenth Child, was troubled, and very anxious, lest
she should die of that Childbearing: But (God favoring) she was delivered
well enough of a Son, and for three days after she was very cheerful: on the
fourth day, when she had eaten more than she should do of a Chicken, a little
before night she fell into a feverish Distemper, with vomiting, and a stopping
of the Lochia: all night she lay restless and without sleep, the next morning
she had four stools, and seemed somewhat eased: about Noon (about which time I
came to her) she complained again of heat and thirst, as also a palpitation of
the heart, and of the ascent of some substance in her throat: her Pulse was
quick and small, her Urine red, the Lochia scarce appeared: I ordered her
Juleps, Cordials, and things to purge the Womb, besides a fomentation for the
bottom of her Belly, also her Legs and Feet to be rubbed often, with warm
Woollen Clothes; at going to sleep I gave her of Laudanum one grain, with
Saffron Powder half a scruple, in a spoonful of Treacle-water: She slept well,
and the Lochia came down plentifully, and by that means, with a slender diet,
and continuing to provoke moderately the Flux of the Womb, for a few days, she
became very well.

The immoderate eating of flesh, as an evident and almost only sufficient
cause, without any great provision, or vicious predisposition, induced the
Fever. The Lochia restagnating into the Blood, increased its intemperance, and
presently brought troubles upon the nervous kind; but in the mean time, the
Blood although growing hot, did not undergo any great corruption, but when the
recrements, heaped up by the Surfeit, were sent forth by the looseness, and the
Blood, the Lochia being restored, began to be purged forth again after its
wonted manner, this Fever wanting a further malignant ferment, quickly
vanished.

A noble Lady, young, and fair, was brought to Bed of a second Child, and for
six days, as to the Lochia and other accidents, she was well, and wholly free
from the suspicion of any intemperature: she ate flesh daily, and rising from
her Bed, was brisk and cheerful in her Chamber; on the seventh day, without any
manifest cause, a shivering came upon her, with a Fever, and a lessning of the
Lochia, but not suppressed: to the tenth day after her Delivery, she was only
moderately feverish; whilst the purgings of the Womb yet flowed, she remained
free from any grievous symptom: but then, although she was greatly feverish,
she was more cheerful than ordinary, and seemed more confident of her health:
at Night she slept little or nothing; the morning following (at which time I
first visited her) she clearly raved, the Lochia were stopped, also her whole
Body was shaken with horror the tendons in her wrists were pulled together, so
that I could hardly distinguish her Pulse, which in the mean time was weak,
unequal, and very quick. I said she would die quickly, unless God should
miraculously restore her by his Divine Power, however, six grains of Oriental
Bezoar being given her, in a spoonful of Cordial Julep, brought upon her a
plentiful sweat, with a better Pulse; then other Cordials being given, wi^^ due
intervals, gave some little hopes, tho I doubted they would not continue: a^t^r
four hours from the time that I came, the sick Lady had of her own accord a
great Stool, and presently her strength wholly failed her, and within half an
hour she died.

When there happened nothing of ill to this Lady, as to her Delivery, or Womb, so
pernicious a Fever, and so suddenly Mortal, could not happen without a great
and malignant procatarsis of the Blood and humors: whether a more full Diet, or
taking Cold, or any other evident cause, gave a beginning to this is uncertain;
because, the Women and Nurses helping her, knew of no manifest occasion of her
sickness: The Fever being inkindled, the infection of the Blood could not be
wholly carried away, by the purging of the Womb, tho long continued; tho for
that reason, the more cruel symptoms came not presently upon her, yet the evil
still lurked within, and the Disease being very acute, showing it self with a
swift motion, on the fourth day, when Nature should have endeavored a Crisis,
the matter of the Fever being moved, but not overcome, as it were in a moment
overturned at once, the Brain and nervous parts, whence Death was to be
expected, and suddenly followed.

A Woman well known, who had scarce passed the twentieth Year of her Age, of a
florid countenance, and slender Body, after her being brought to Bed, when the
Lochia flowed immoderately, made use of some astringent Remedies, by the
counsel of those about her, by which means they were wholly stopped; but a Flux
of her Belly succeeded, which when it had increased for three days, the Women
gave her other things for the stopping her Looseness: nor were they frustrated
in the success; in the mean time, in the place of the former evil, they had
brought a most dangerous Fever, and distempers as it were hysterical: for the
unhappy Gentlewoman Lying in, was troubled with thirst, heat, wakings, and at
several turns, with swoonings, and cold sweats; at this time being sent for, I
prescribed her Cardaic Remedies, and such as moved the purgings of the Womb,
and also a Clyster to be given her: at length, the Flux of her Belly being
provoked, the Lochia also came down, and the sick Woman being freed from the
aforesaid symptoms, and the more grievous Disease, to wit, the Remedies of the
Nurses, quickly grew well of her Fever.

The more plentiful Flux of the Womb, happening to this Woman, removed the
Procatartic cause of a more grievous Disease: wherefore, when they had
committed so many errors about the ordering her, ( viz. first in stopping the
Lochia, then what might compensate their defect, in hindering the Flux of her
Belly) yet the Fever was only light, and without any venomous taint impressed
on the Blood; the like to this I have known to happen frequently, to wit, when
at first the purgings of the Womb have flown very plentifully, afterward when
they have flown very sparingly, and sometimes stopped, the Women in Childbed
have escaped. And by the way, it is here to be noted, that it is wholly
dangerous, to inhibit, or at least divert, and cross any motion of Nature,
incited, tho irregular.

A Noble Gentlewoman, about 20 years of Age, endued with a smooth and full
habit of Body, miscarried twice in the space of a Year; when she had again
Conceived, by the prescription of her Physician, she provoked a Vomit once a
month, by drinking plentifully Posset Drink, by which she was wont to cast
forth much thick tough Phlegm, also in the time of her being with Child, he Let
her Blood 5 times; the time of her going being over, she was brought to Bed of
a Son, with very hard Labor; the Secundine came whole away, and she purged
notably: on the second day, whilst she was lifted upon her feet in Bed, that
the Sheets and the Blankets might be laid in better order, she took Cold, and
by that means the bloody Lochia wholly stopped, and only a little serous Water
came away: on the third day she began to complain of an acute pain in her right
side, to which the Women laid Bags of Camomil made hot with Bricks, but the
distemper grew worse with a bloody spittle; on the fourth day of her being
brought to Bed, a most ^harp pain, with a difficult breathing, and very
Laborious, invaded her: by the prescription of her Physician, then coming to
her from the neigbourhood, six ounces of Blood was taken away, out of the
Basilic Vein, and she felt sudden ease, for 10 hours she was better, in the
middle of the night the pricking pain returned with its wonted fierceness: at
length, other Physicians being called to Counsel, they agreed that it was
necessary to open a Vein again, in the arm of the distempered side: four ounces
of Blood being taken away, the pain remitted, and the sick breathed better;
then by Diasphoretic Remedies, she fell into a great sweat, with a quiet sleep:
But the Pulse was made quicker and weaker, also contractures of the tendons in
her wrists appeared: presently afterward she talked idly, and within 24 hours,
after she was last Let Blood, she departed.

That this Lady fell into a Pleurisy, with a Fever, upon the Lochia being
suppressed, the cause in some measure seemed to be, the Letting of Blood so
often in the time of her being with Child: for by this means, the Blood being
accustomed to be eventilated at the arm, afterward growing hot, leaving the
Womb, was carried violently toward the place of its letting forth, where, when
it found not a passage, it fixed in the neighboring side, as the next nest to
the place of extravasation; yea, besides the usual manner of a Pleurisy, there
was no small malignity happened to this Disease; for the Blood being hindered from
being let forth of the Vessels, began presently to be corrupted in its
disposition, and in the third day of the Fever, was so much depraved, that it
could not be any longer fermented in the heart so as to Prorogue Life.

It was not so with the Wife of a certain Smith, who was brought to Bed, at
what time her Children had the Small Pox in the same House, and she her self,
as it seemed, had taken the Contagion of the same Disease, for on the second
day after her Delivery, they began to break forth with a feverish heat, and
pain in her Loins, which indeed for three days, whilst the Lochia moderately
flowed, arose rightly into little swellings; although the purging of the Womb was
very copious at that time, she had the Small Pox very thick all over her Body,
not only in the superficies of her skin, but also they filled the cavity of her
mouth and throat, so that she could scarce speak or swallow: The sixth day of
her Lying in, the Lochia flowed immoderately, from whence presently fell upon
the sick, a frequent swooning, with a flagging of the Small Pox, Convulsions,
and other symptoms of an ill nature, which threatened Death soon; being sent
for, I prescribed half a dram of this Powder, to be taken constantly every
three hours, in a spoonful of the following Julep, viz. take of the Roots of
Tormentil in Powder, drams two, of the best Bole Armonie dram one, of the
species of Hyacinth half a dram, make a Powder. Take of the Compound Water of
Scordium, of Dragons, of Meadowsweet, each three ounces, of Therecal Vinegar
one ounce, of the Syrup of Corals two ounces, of Hartshorn burnt half a dram,
make a Julep. Besides, I ordered to be boiled in her Broths, and in every thing
she drank, the Roots of Tormentil: by these Remedies, the purging of her Womb
was soon wholly stopped, and the Small Pox by degrees being ripened, came off
without any grievous symptom.

Indeed this case was difficult, and was cured with great danger, viz. for
either the Lochia, or the Small Pox to have been restrained inwardly, was very
dangerous, and yet the more full eruption of the one, hindered the motion of the
other; so long as either moderately proceeded, things being permitted to the
conduct of Nature was moderately well: but when one of them became ill, the
work of Art was required, and it was requisite to bridle the Lochia, but to
provoke the Small Pox.

CHAP. XVII. Of Epidemical Fevers.
HAving meditated rather a Commentary, than an entire Tract, I had thought here
to have concluded our Discourse of Fevers: But forasmuch as certain Epidemical
Fevers do often spread, which observe no Laws, nor can be brought to any
certain rule of Doctrine, but being irregular vary every year, and for that
reason, as often as any of them increase or spread abroad, presently it is
called the new Disease; therefore, I thought it worth our while, because
general precepts concerning these Fevers are not to be delivered, to subjoyn
some particular Histories, of some of this kind; for out of the various
provision of symptoms, whereby they are wont to be noted, the nature and the
whole formal reason of these kind of distempers, may somewhat appear. Since
therefore of late years, within a short tract of time, three popular Diseases
have spread in these Countries, I will add, as a Crown to this work, the several
Descriptions of them, made at those times, when these Fevers raged.

A Description of an Epidemical Fever, spreading about Autumn, in the Year
1657. taken in the middle of September.
WHilst we meditate the Description of a Fever, at this time cruelly raging,
it is fit, that following the example of Hippocrates, we first consider the
foregoing constitution of the Year, its intemperance and excess of qualities.
For Epidemical Diseases, and commonly excited among the people, are from a
common cause; such as the habit of the Year, and by that means contracted, a
disposition of the Blood, by which many are alike affected. But that we may
draw the matter from the beginning, the last Spring, and the time succeeding
it, even to the end of the Summer, was all that half years space extremely dry
and hot, but especially after the Summer solstice, the heats were so intense
for many weeks following, that day and night there was none that did not
complain of the heat of the Air, and were almost in a continual sweat, and were
not able to breath freely: About the Calends of July, this Fever, at first
sporadical or particular, began to break forth in some places, that perhaps one
or two were taken in the same City or Village: In many it imitated the likeness
of an intermitting Tertian, viz. the Fits returned every other day; which yet
infested the sick with a most intense heat, without any cold or shivering going
before; Vomiting and Choleric Stools plentifully happened to most, sweat
succeeding but difficultly, and often interrupted, whereby the feverish fit
rarely ended in a remission, but that all the time between, the sick continued
languishing and weak, with thirst and restlessness; in some, when the business
began to grow better, after three or four fits, cold and shivering began the
fits, and the Fever became an exact intermitting Tertian: But in most, the
Fever still grew worse, and presently became of an evil nature, and difficult
Cure, with a depraved provision of symptoms; for when the sick were highly
heated in their fits, and hardly sweated, they were wont to commit errors,
which daily increased the strength of the Disease, because by reason of the
inpatience of the sick, and the unskilfulness of Servants, the sweat being
interrupted, which should have ended the fit of the Fever, after one fit was
scarce finished, another presently succeeded, and so the Disease was wont to
have wandering and uncertain periods, without any intermission between and
afterward to pass into a kind of continual Fever. The condition of which,
sometimes being very dangerous, with an evil affection of the Brain and nervous
stock, so that oftentimes a Lethargy, or Delirium, or not seldom cramps, and
Convulsive motions, were excited: About the month of August, this Fever began
to spread far and near, among the people, that in every Region and Village many
were sick of it; but it was much more frequent in the Country, and smaller
Villages, than in Cities or Towns. It was still like an intermitting Fever,
unless that it seemed more infestous than that is wont, and with more cruel
fits, and shorter intermissions, and therefore was called the new Disease:
besides, it underwent the note of a certain malignity, and gave knowledge of its
Contagion and Deadliness; insomuch, that it crept from house to house, infected
with the same evil, most of the same Family, and especially those familiarly
conversing with the sick; yea, old Men, and Men of ripe Age, it ordinarily took
away.

If you respect the nature and essence of the Disease, this Fever properly
should be referred to the rank of intermitting Fevers, for the fits returned
at set times, also for the most part they began with cold and shivering, and
oftenest with vomiting, and by and by a most intense heat proceeding, they were
finished at last with a sweat. The Urine in most appeared of a flame color,
thin in the fits, with some hypostasis, without it more thick, and with a
redish sediment; although with a most copious sweat, and often iterated, the
Disease was not cured, which might be expected in a continual Fever; yea, the
distemper continued exceeding long, for many days, sometimes months, tho much
evacuation almost daily happened by vomit and sweat: which we observe frequently
in an intermitting Fever, rarely to happen in a continual; out of the fit, at
any time of the Disease a purge was profitably instituted, which in a Synochus
before the sign of concoction, were a wicked thing to attempt; besides, that
this Fever was of the intermitting kind, it seems to appear from hence,
because very many recovered of it, that scarce one of a thousand died, which I
scarce ever knew in an Epidemical Synochus. About the first beginnings of this
Disease, it appeared very like to an intermitting Tertian, although afterward in
some, by reason of the vicious provision of their body, and errors committed in
Diet, and sweating, it seemed to change into a continual; for in whom the fits
were not rightly concluded, nor ended in a remission, by reason of the morbific
matter not being thoroughly dispersed, their Blood was continually hot: from
whence it came to pass, that the fits sooner returned, and continued longer;
till at length, by reason of the plenty of matter, and the languishment of
Nature, the Blood being made weaker, endeavored no longer to swell up, and to
separate the feverish matter at set hours, but to subdue it by little and
little, with a continual effervency.

We are to inquire concerning the causes of this Disease, what may be the
leading, evident, and conjunct cause, viz. by the means of which it spread so
generally, and became Epidemical through all England; by what means, and for
what occasion, it was wont to be excited in all men: and lastly, what kind of
alteration of the Blood and humors, being induced, brought forth this kind of
Fever, with such a provision of symptoms, and conserved it in the Act.

I know it is easy to place wholly the cause of this so popular Disease in the
malignant constitution of the Air, to wit, that the Particles of the Air, in
which we breath, were infected by a certain extraneous Infection, and not
agreeable to our Nature, the little bodies of which Infections being admitted
within, did ferment with the Blood and humors, and so in most, brought in this
Fever, almost with the same appearance of symptoms. For who dares deduce the
original of a Disease so generally raging, from a less public fountain? or
refer to any other place, the received causes of Diseases, than to that nest of
Vital Air, on which every one seeds? But whilst I more attentively consider the
thing, it seems to me, that its stem, and as it were its first beginnings, are
to be sought a little deeper. To wit, that this Fever is born not from the
Contagion communicated by the Air, and immediately fixing its evil on men, but
rather from a certain feverish predisposition or nature, impressed somewhile
before on our Bodies, because of the intemperance of the Year, which at length
having gotten maturity, on the least occasion is brought into Act, and so
breaks not forth into this Fever, so much as it sifts it forth.

For when about the Calends of July, the Air was immoderately hot, with a most
intense heat for many days, is easily altered our Blood toward an hot and
bilous intemperance, by which (as (...) ^ine growing more hot than it should
do) the sweet part, and the spirituous was much consumed, in the mean time, the
Saline and Sulphurous was too much carried forth, that by that means, the
Liquor easily contracted a rancor or sourness: We have in another place shown,
that this kind of disposition of the Blood, whereby indeed it turns from a
sweet and spirituous temper, into a bilous or choleric, is most apt for
intermitting Fevers: Hence the alible juice, which is continually carried into
the mass of Blood, is not rightly concocted nor assimilated into Blood, but
perverted as it were into an extraneous and fermentative matter: which arising
to a fullness in the bosom of the Blood it self, and growing turgid according to
its increase at set periods, as we have already shown, induces the fits of the
intermitting Fever: when therefore, from the great burning heat of this
Summer, the Blood almost of all men, becoming more hot than usual, was very
much scorched, it is no wonder, if from thence it should contract a great
aptitude for intermitting Fevers. But why not whilst the fervor of the Heaven
was yet urgent, but a little after, this Disease spread it self, the reason is,
because this indisposition is not impressed on our Blood at once, or at one
time, but by little and little, and not but of a long time; and therefore,
Diseases like Fruits, are chiefly ripened in Autumn, after the foregoing heat
of the Summer.

This aptitude or feverish disposition, all do not contract alike; those whose
Blood is of a more hot Nature, and abounds more in Sulphur, and for that cause
is sooner scorched, also such who labor, or stay long in the heat of the Sun,
and open Air, by reason of their Blood being more remarkably torrified, more
easily fell into this Disease; wherefore, at first, it chiefly raged among
Husbandmen in the Country: of these, who had acquired an aptitude to this
Fever, from the Blood being before scorched, some perhaps fell into this of
their own accord, the feverish disposition being leisurely carried forth to a
maturity; others, by reason of a light occasion or evident cause, which was
wont otherways to stir up the feverish burning, as from taking Cold, Surfeit,
drinking of Wine, and the like; and others fell sick from the Contagion
received of others, for as the effluvia constantly came away from the sick,
when they pierced Bodies predisposed to the like distemper, they easily excited
the hid powers into Act.

As to the third Proposition, to wit, that the conjunct cause of this Disease,
and its formal Reason, may be known, we must put you in mind of those things,
which we have elsewhere delivered concerning the nature of intermitting
Fevers; for we suppose the retorrid and bilous constitution of the Blood, as
the basis of this Disease, by reason of which, the alible juice, being supplied
daily, as it were in a certain measure, is not rightly concocted, but by the
assation or scorching, becomes or goes into a fermentative matter, not miscible
with the Blood. When the Blood is filled to a fullness with this matter (which
happens at set intervals of times, because the alible juice is supplied as it
were by a set measure) it of its own accord conceives a swelling up, and the
growing hot or effervescency being excited, for the carrying away of this
matter, causes the feverish fit: which so long indures, till this feverish
matter being inkindled, and as it were burnt in the heart, is wholly dissipated
with sweat.

From these things premised, it is made plain, that in this distemper, we now
discourse of, there are some things happen by a peculiar way, from the common
kind of intermitting Fevers, and therefore it was noted, and that not
undeservedly, with the appellation of a New Fever; which are, First, That
about the beginning of the Disease, fits did a long while afflict the sick,
without cold or shaking, but with a most intense heat, thirst, and cruel
vomiting; by which, the sweat hardly, and for the most part partial, and often
interrupted, succeeded, whereby the fit was not finished but of a long time.
The reason of which, may be only laid upon the very choleric disposition of the
Blood, and being above measure scorched: For this proceeding from the
domineering Sulphur, wholly inhibits the wonted sourness of the Blood, which
follows its turgency or swelling up, and is wont to stir up the cold or
shivering; and by reason of this kind of temper of the Blood, too much roasting
and as it were burning the alible juice, the Blood growing turgid, together
with that juice, and being stirred up into motion, is inkindled more than it is
wont in the heart, and by its deflagration, induces a most intense and
troublesome heat, with thirst, to the sick. Choleric vomitings, happen not
only at the beginning, but in the middle of the fit, by reason of the abundance
of choler, with which, the Choleduct Vessels being too much filled, infuse the
intestines; which then, a Convulsion being stirred up, is easily emptied into
the Ventricle: sweat hardly succeeds, because the bile abounds more than the
serum, wherefore the feverish matter being burnt, it is not easily sifted
forth by sweat but being either mingled with the Blood, causes the long
effervency, or being carried toward the intestines, produces Vomiting, or a
Flux. Secondly, This Fever differs from the vulgar intermitting Fever,
because after the fit was ended, there was no full intermission, even to a
remission, but the sick still remained languishing and thirsty; and as to
appetite, sleep, and other accidents, very ill: which indeed happened, because,
by the intense heat of the fit, more of the Blood and feverish matter is
inkindled, than that its recrements remaining after its deflagration, are able
presently to be dissipated, especially, because the sweat, by reason of the
dryness of the matter, very hardly succeeds, nor is the feverish matter enough
diluted with the serous Latex, to be sifted forth; wherefore, the Blood by its
Contagion, in the time of the fit, not being perfectly freed, grows hot still,
neither the fit being ended, does it get any full truce from the Disease: In
the mean time, whilst the Blood is urged after this manner, with almost a
continual effervency, it differs from a Synochus; because in this, the
Sulphurous part of the Blood, being too much carried forth, and as it were
inflamed, causes the Fever by its deflagration; but the continual ebullition,
which after this manner comes upon this intermitting Fever, wholly depends
upon the confusion of the not miscible matter, and its hard secretion from the
Blood. The Synochus happens like Wine growing hot of its own accord, by reason
of its richness, the other conceives its fury, like the same Wine, by reason of
some heterogeneous thing poured to it: wherefore we remark, that whilst our
Fever is seen still to be continual, it is not cured by sweat or the Flux of
the Belly, although they frequently and copiously happen: because it depending
upon the Blood being depauperated, rather than being inflamed, it continues
long, and disposes the sick toward a Cachexie,

3. There is a third reason of difference, by which this Fever may be
distinguished from the common rank of intermitting Fevers, and it is this,
that it is easily propagated to others by Contagion; the reason of which is,
because here very many bodies are predisposed after the same manner, toward
the same distemper, which happens not at another time; wherefore, the mere
effluvias from a diseased Body, are able to excite the like effect, in a very
fit subject; even as some Beams of Flame enkindle Flame, in a very combustible
matter: In the mean time all do not alike contract the Infection of this
Fever, but that some being less prepared or fitted for it, converse with the
sick without harm.

4. There is another symptom occurs, not constant to this Fever, but only
happening in some places, that discriminates it not only from the common, but
varies its own proper type; to wit, sometimes it happens, this Disease to be
accompanied with a Dysenterick distemper; in some choleric Vomits, and bilous
Stools very much infest, and in others Bloody Stools follow, with cruel pains
and torments of the Belly. The former I often observed in our Neigbourhood, and
the reason of it may be deduced from the highly bilous temper of the Blood: For
by reason of this, the adust matter, not to be dissipated by sweat, is
copiously sifted into the Liver; then by reason of the choler-carrying Vessels,
being filled to a flowing over, it is sent away to the Ventricle, and
Intestines. The other Dysenterical distemper, was found only in some places,
and there peculiar rather than common, it laid hold only of some sick. The
origin of it may be referred to the peculiar dispositions of some Bodies, or
vicious provision, also to the site of the place, or condition of the Air; then
the Disease is to be suspected, to be thence translated to others, not without
the communication of a certain Infection.

There is to be had a double Prognostication concerning this Disease: First, of
the Fever in General, what end it shall have, and when; what it may threaten
to the Land: whether it precede not (which is commonly feared) the Plague, or
Pestilential Sicknesses. Secondly, The signs ought to be laid down, whereby we
are wont to presage health, or danger, in the various cases of the sick.

As to the First, Because we have shown that the Origin of this distemper is
not to be fetched from the Contagion of the Air, or its being infected with any
venomous Infection, nor from any malignant seeds of Vapors diffused through
the Air, but only from the signal bilous temper or disposition of our Bodies,
with the Blood being made adust and roasted extremely, by reason of the Summer
heats, I think there is no reason of fear, that this Fever should be carried
forth into any thing worse, by the vice of the Air, or might at length grow to
be Malignant or Pestilential. But rather (that the season of the Year being
changed, and the alteration of our Blood assuredly to be expected) we might
fear lest this Fever, which now imitates the way of an intermitting Fever,
should afterward pass into a Quartane, the Blood growing into a melancholy
temper. Which thing indeed I observed to happen to some already, and I believe,
that before the Autumn be fully passed over, will happen to many more.

As to the particular Prognostication, the chiefly notable signs, which occur
in the course of this Fever, and in a manner foretell its condition and event,
are of this sort; if the Disease happens in a firm Body, well tempered, and
easily perspirable; if vomiting with ease succeeds, and that the Belly be
loose: if the fit begins with a light shivering, and afterward a moderate
heat, with sweat concludes it, and that the intermission be with some tolerable
remission; if the Pulse be strong, the Urine of a flame color, clear, and with
a laudable hypostasis, we may Predict that the Disease will quickly end without
any danger. But if this Fever be excited in a fat Body, and or a vicious
habit, it with troublesome vomiting, an intolerable thirst, and fierce heat,
long exercise the sick; if to the heat a difficult sweat, and partial, and
often interrupted, and between frequent vomitings succeed, and that it ends not
in a remission, we may declare, that this Disease may be long, and of a
dangerous issue. But if the sick remain in strength, and the Urine show signs
of concoction, we need not despair of health; especially, if after four or five
periods, the Disease, as it is wont to do, remits of its wonted fierceness.
Thirdly we observe, if this Disease is excited in an old Body, or others broken
with sicknesses, or debilitated; if besides horrid vomitings, there happen
swoonings, faintings, Deliriums or Lethargic distempers; if after many fits,
the sick having lost their strength, the Disease remits nothing, but exercises
the Blood, with a continual effervency, and that the Vital Spirits are much
destroyed; if the appetite be lost, wakings pertinacious, and that they have
Convulsive motions, with a weak Pulse, and Urine troubled, or thick, we judge
the matter to be full of danger: yet is not the sick to be left as desperate,
because the Disease is not hasty, and kills not suddenly, and out of hand; but
is drawn out at length, and grants time and occasions to nature, of
recollecting her self, and to the Physician, of giving Remedies.

The Therapeutic Indications, which have place in the Cure of this Fever, are
chiefly four. First, That the Blood being now scorched, and made too choloric,
may be reduced to its due temper. Secondly, That the depravation of the
nourishable juice, and its alteration into a fermentative matter, may be
inhibited, or at least lessned. Thirdly, That about the declining of the
Disease, the Blood depauperated by a frequent deflagration, and made more
impure by the fusion or pouring into it the morbifick or adust matter, may be
restored, and rendered as it should be volatile. Fourthly, That the symptoms,
which chiefly infest in the course of the Disease, may be timely helped, by fit
Remedies; that these intentions may be satisfied, I counsel that this following
method be used.

About the beginning of the Disease, if the bilous or cholorie humor, flowing
forth of the choler bearing Vessels, and being suffused into the Venticle,
cause the sick to be prone to vomiting, let a more plentiful evacuation be
procured, by a gentle Emetie in the time of the fit: The opening of a Vein, and
Purging, ought not to be administered, unless between the fits: for whilst the
Blood grows mainly hot, or is resolved into sweat, Nature ought not to be
called back from the Work begun, nor her endeavors to be disturbed, by the
prescriptions of Physicians; wherefore, after the (...) being past, and the
sweat thoroughly finished, a Purging may be instituted, by a gentle Cathartic,
and the same afterward sometimes repeated, on the like occasion: for by this
method, not only the provision of the excrementitious matter, is brought away,
from the first passages, but chiefly the choler-bearing Vessels being emptied,
the choler is copiously drawn forth from the mass of Blood, and by that means
the Blood is restored to its natural Crasis or disposition. The Letting of
Blood, if it be indicated, should be performed presently after the beginning;
for so its Liquor being too turgent or swelling up, is eventilated, whereby
both the nutritious juice is less perverted, and the fit urging, it burns forth
with a less heat, together with the morbifick matter: but otherwise, if a Vein
be opened after a long sickness, when the Blood being made poorer, and more
watery, more of the morbific matter is heaped together, and does not rightly
concoct, and sift it forth, it detracts much from the strength of Nature, and
nothing from the power of the Disease. In the interval of the fits, when there
is no place for opening a Vein, nor Purging, let the Belly be kept loose, by
the constant use of Clysters; also digestive Remedies, of acetous or saline
Liquors and Powders, are to be exhibited; of which sort are, Cream of Tartar
fixed Salts of Herbs, Tartar Vitriolate, Hartshorn burnt, Spirit of Vitriol,
and Salt, etc. for these restore the lost, or sleepy ferments of the Viscera,
purify the Blood by fusing it, also separate the morbific matter, and as it
were precipitate it: also, at this time, between, if pertinations waking infest
the sick, and overthrow their strength, it may be lawful to administer anodyne,
and gentle narcotic Remedies; but never in the fit: for then they greatly
hinder the subduing, and sifting forth of the feverish matter, and draw out in
length the fit that would end sooner.

These things are to be done about the interstitia, or intervals of the fits;
but whilst the fit is urgent, although the sick then chiefly send for, and call
upon Physiicans, yet at this time their prescripts are limited to a narrower
space: If Vomiting (notwithstanding an Emetic being given) still infest, it may
be more freely provoked, either by simple Posset Drink, or with bitter Herbs
boiled in it: But let the chiefest means of help be, in temperating the heat
and thirst, which most grievously torments the sick in this Fever: For whilst
the Blood growing hot, with the morbific matter, and being inkindled in the
Heart, leaps forth into the Lungs, stirs up there a cruel Inflammation, which
requires a profusion of a cold humor as it were for the extinguishing the
Flame; wherefore they greedily desire without any measure drink, for want of
which the sick are almost killed with too great heat, and their Blood being
almost wholly rarefied into flame and fume, the third of Circulation is hardly
continued; wherefore, drink ought to be wholly granted, to those in Fevers:
which however, if it be taken in too large a quantity, it at first more
disturbs the estuating Blood, and at length brings confusion to the feverish
matter, begun to be separated; that from thence, the Work of subaction and
secretion is longer protacted, and the fit is made longer: also, besides, large
drinking causes troubles in the Ventricle, and by disturbing it, and often
provoking Vomiting, hinders the breathing forth, and calls inward the sweat
breaking forth, or perhaps already broke forth: wherefore, at first, the heat
of the Fever being inkindled, although the sick be very thirsty, let them only
sip a little, and abstain from drink as much as they can; afterward, when the
matter being burnt, and subdued, begins to be dissipated by sweat, they may be
more freely indulged as to this, for so the sweating is greatly helped, and the
fit is sooner finished: as to the nature of the Drink, let them take sometimes
Posset Drink, sometimes Small Beer, or Barley Water, and sometimes simple Water,
or sharpened with the juice of Lemons: In this case, the use of Sal Prunellae is
deservedly praised, to be given in every Liquor; for this, with its nitrosity,
wonderfully allays the raging Blood, and potently moves sweats, I have often
observed, in the midst of a fit, the sick wont to fall into a swoon, or
syncopy, to whom presently they give Cordials or hot Waters that much increase
the violence of the Fever, and bring forth more troubles than usual, that the
fit is more difficultly finished: But these faintings, for the most part,
happen, either from a bilous humor suffused in the Ventricle, or by reason of
the sweat suddenly breaking forth; and against these I always found the most
present Remedy, that either a feather being put down the throat, Vomiting may
be provoked, or that Liquor being plentifully drunk, a sweat may be again
raised up: also, in the whole course of this Fever, I am wont never to give
any Cordials, or alexiteriums.

The Diet in this Fever ought to be only slender, and not nourishing, all
sorts of Flesh, or any thing prepared of them, are wholly to be avoided; for as
these abound with Sulphur, they give a more plentiful food (as Oil poured on
Flame) to the hot or enkindled Blood: besides, nothing spiritous, as strong
Waters, strong Beer, or Wine, is to be yielded to; but Decoctions, or Broths of
Oat-meal, or Barley, altered with cooling Herbs, are chiefly to be used; also
Posset Drink, and small Beer, or Whey, is to be given them at their pleasure:
for by this means, when a very slender and watery nourishing juice, is conveyed
to the mass of Blood, the soluted Particles of Sulphur, burn forth sooner, and
with the less tumult; also the recrements of the adust matter, are more easily
carried from the bosom of the Blood: but if on the contrary, a more rich or
plentiful nourishment be administered, the effervency of the Blood is thereby
very much augmented, and the Blood is more infected, by the confusion or
pouring in of the adust matter.

After that the Blood being much burnt forth by frequent fits, and the Fever
being in its declination, remits of its fervor and fierceness, you must take
heed, lest the sick at length growing well, fall not into a Cachexie, or
Scorbutic Distemper: for the disposition of the Viscera being hurt, and the
Blood very much depauperated, the alible juice, though not scorched so as at
first, is not however rightly concocted, and ripened into perfect Blood: but by
reason of the want of transpiration, the serous excrements, being imbued with a
fixed salt, are greatly heaped together, and now fixed in the Bowels, now in
the extreme parts, bring forth various Distempers. Wherefore in a long
languishing of the sick, or otherwise for the sake of being sooner well,
Remedies should be given them, which volatilise the Blood, or hinder the
stuffings of the Viscera, or if stuffed, may open them, and their ferments as
if extinct, restore: for this use, those Remedies and Preparations chiefly
help, which are commonly called Digestives and Antiscorbuticks; with which
being timely administered, I have known very many weak, pale, and as it were
without Blood, suddenly to recover a liveliness and vigor.

The Description of a Catarrhal Fever Epidemical in the middle of the Spring,
in the Year 1658. taken the fourth of June.
AN equally intense Frost followed the next Winter, the immoderate heat of the
foregoing Summer, so that no one living could remember such a Year, for either
excess both of heat and cold. From the Ides of December, almost to the vernal
Equinox, the Earth was covered with snow, and the North wind constantly
blowing, all things without doors were frozen: also, afterward, from the
beginning of the Spring, almost to the beginning of June, the same Wind still
blowing, the season was more like Winter than Spring; unless now and then a hot
day came between. During the Winter (unless that a Quartan Fever contracted in
Autumn infested some) among our Countrymen, there was a moderate state of
health, and freedom from all popular Diseases. The Spring coming on, an
intermitting Tertian (as used to do every year before) fell upon some. About
the end of April, suddenly a Distemper arose, as it sent by some blast of the
Stars, which laid hold on very many together: that in some Towns, in the space
of a Week, above a thousand people fell sick together. The particular symptom
of this Disease, and which first invaded the sick, was a troublesome Cough,
with great spitting, also a Catarrh, falling down on the palate, throat, and
nostrils; also it was accompanied with a feverish Distemper, joined with heat
and thirst, want of appetite, a spontaneous weariness, and a grievous pain in
the Back and Limbs: which Fever however was more remiss in some, that they
could go abroad, and follow their affairs in the time of their sickness, but
complaining in the mean time, of want of strength, and of languishing, a
loathing of food, a Cough, and a Catarrh: But in some a very hot Distemper
plainly appeared, that being thrown into Bed they were troubled with burning,
thirst, waking, hoarsness, and coughing, almost continual; sometimes there came
upon this a bleeding at Nose, and in some a bloody spittle, and frequently a
Bloody Flux, such as were endued with an infirm Body, or men of a more
declining Age, that were taken with this Disease, not a few died of it; but the
more strong, and almost all of an healthful constitution recovered: those who
falling sick of this Disease, and died, for the most part died by reason of the
strength being leisurely wasted, and a serous heap more and more gathered
together in the Breast, with the Fever being increased, and a difficulty of
breath, like those sick of an Hectic Fever. Concerning this Disease, we are to
inquire, what procatartic cause it had; that it should arise in the middle of
the Spring suddenly, and that the third part of Mankind almost, should be
distempered with the same, in the space of a Month: then the signs and symptoms
being carefully collated, the formal reason of this Disease, also its Crisis
and way of Cure ought to be assigned.

That the Northern Wind is most apt to produce Catarrhs, besides the testimony
of Hippocrates, common experience does make known: but why Catarrhs did not
spread, at least in some peculiar places, all the Winter and Spring, but only
in one months space, and then joined with a Fever, this Distemper should
become Epidemical, does not so plainly appear. I know many deduce the cause
from the unequal temper of the Air, at that time; which although for the most part
very cold, yet the North Wind sometimes lessening, there would be a day or two
very hot between: wherefore, from this occasion, as from cold taken after the
heat, men should commonly fall sick: But indeed, for the exciting the
Distemper, so suddenly rising, and commonly spreading, there is required,
besides such an occasion, a great foregoing cause or predisposition, tho the
other might suffice perhaps, for an evident cause, for to distemper them with
this sickness; for we ought to suppose, that almost all men were prone to the
receiving this Disease, otherwise no evident cause could have exercised its
power so potently on so many, wherefore, it seems very likely, that this
Disease had its Origin from the intemperance and great inordination of the
year: and as the Autumnal intermitting Fever before described, was the product
of the preceding immoderate heat, so this Catarrhal Fever, depended altogether
upon the following part of the year, being so extremely cold: For the Blood
being now thoroughly roasted by the very hot Summer, and prone to the Fever
before described, then being made more sourish by the Autumn urging it, and apt
for a Quartan Fever, afterward being a little eventilated by reason of the
strong cold of the Winter, and hindered from its due perspiration, retained yet
its Dyscrasie, or evil disposition, and readily broke forth on the first
occasion given: wherefore, when the Blood, in the middle of the Spring, (as the
juice of Vegetables) being made more lively, and also begun to flower and grow
rank, by reason of the stoppage being still continued, was straightened in its
Circulation, and easily made prone to a feverish effervescency: and as the
serous Water redounding in the Blood, could not evaporate outwardly, because of
the Pores being still straightened by the cold, restagnating within, and chiefly
falling upon the Lungs, (where it might be moved about, instead of an outward
breathing forth) excited the so frequent and troublesome Cough.

The Original therefore, and formal Reason of this Disease, are founded chiefly
on two things, to wit, that there together happened a greater effervescency of
the Blood than usual, from the coming on of the Spring season, and also a
stoppage, or great constriction of the Pores, excited by the too great cold of
the foregoing season; that therefore there was not a free space granted to the
Blood, flowring or luxuriating in the Vessels: The business being after the
same manner, as if Wine begun to grow hot, should be put up into close shut
Vessels, for by this means, either the Vessels, or the Liquor, were in danger
to be lost.

Wherefore, that we may contract the thing in short, the cause that this
Disease begun in the middle of the Spring, having presently spread largely,
seized very many, was not the blast of a malignant Air, whereby the sick were
distempered, as if struck with a blasting, but that at this time, the Blood
being inspired by the constitution of the Spring, and so luxuriating, and apt
to grow hot, was contracted or straightened in its motion, and, the effluvias
being constrained inwardly, could not be sufficiently eventilated or cooled. In
every year, tho temperate, it is usual in the Spring and Autumn for some
Epidemical Diseases to reign, because at this time, the Blood being as it were
restored, flowers anew; and therefore, intermitting Fevers, and sometimes the
Small Pox ordinarily spread in this season; wherefore, it is no wonder, after a
great unequal constitution of the year, and not natural, when in this Spring,
the Blood boiling up more lively within the Vessels, by reason of transpiration
being hindered, could not be freely circulated, and sufficiently eventilated, if
for that cause, great disorders follow, and from this most common cause, a
distemper greatly Epidemical should be excited.

As to the symptoms joined with this Disease, a feverish intemperature, and
whatsoever belongs to this, the heat of the Praecordia, thirst, a spontaneous
weariness, pain in the Head, Loins, and Limbs, were induced from the Blood
growing hot, and not sufficiently eventilated: hence in many, a part of the
thinner Blood being heated, and the rest of the Liquor being only driven into
confusion, a simple Synochus, or of more days was induced, and this for the
most part ceased within a few days: But in some endued with a vicious
disposition of Blood, or evil habit of Body, this kind of Fever, arising by
reason of the same cause, quickly passed into a very dangerous Putrid Fever,
and often Mortal.

The Cough accompanying this Fever with a Catarrh, draws its Origin from a
serous humor heaped up together in the Blood, by reason of transpiration being
hindered for a long time, and then an effervescency being risen, dropping forth
more from the little Arteries, gaping within: for when the Pores are
constrained, the superfluous serosities in the Blood, being wont to evaporate
outwardly, are poured forth on the Lungs, by a proper castration or cleansing
of the Blood, wherefore, by taking cold, (as they commonly term it) that is,
from transpiration outwardly being hindered, the Cough for the most part is
stirred up: And for a foregoing cause to this Distemper, the flowing forth of
the serum into the mass of Blood, has for the most part the chief place; for,
from the long cold hindering the scorching of the Blood, or the provision of the
bile, and prohibiting the breathing forth of the watery humor, there was a
necessity, that very much of the serous humor should be heaped up in the Blood:
wherefore, when the Blood flowring in the Spring, conceived an heat, the
flowing forth of the serum, and a pouring of it on the interior parts, was wont
to cause first the Cough, as the proper symptom of this Disease: and those,
whose Blood was more diluted by the mixtion of the serum, and who were greatly
obnoxious to the Cough and a Rheumatic Distemper, were cured with less trouble
of the feverish Distemper. the Prognostic of this Disease, concerning private
persons, is for the most part easy, that one may deliver the event, from the
first assault; for if this sickness be excited in a strong Body, and healthful
before, and that the feverish Distemper be moderate, and without any grievous
and horrid symptom, the business is free from danger, and the Distemper is to
be accounted but of light moment, as that commonly is of catching cold, neither
needs a Physician be consulted, nor Remedies, unless trivial and ordinary, be
administered: But if this Distemper happens in a weak and sickly Body, with an
evil provision, or that the Fever being carried into a Putrid Fever, or the
Cough growing grievous, induces difficult breathing, and as it were a tabid or
Consumptive disposition, the event of the Disease is much to be suspected, and
often terminates in Death. The common Prognostic, that was taken from hence,
concerning the future state of the year, conteins nothing to be feared, or
ominates any great ill; by reason of the unequal intemperance of the year, the
great heats, and then excessive cold, we might fear Diseases to arise from the
Dyscrasie of the Blood, yet from the present condition, we need neither suspect
any noted depravation of the Air, or Infection with poisonous breaths; that
from thence may be had any judgment of the Plague, or Malignant Disease to be
at hand.

As to what belongs to the Cure; when this Disease is more lightly inflicted,
its Cure for the most part is left to Nature: for this Fever, when it is only
a simple Synochus, is wont to be cured within a few days by sweat: wherefore,
by a copious sweating, for the most part about the third or fourth day, the
heat, and thirst, the weariness, and heavy pains are allayed; then the Cough
being somewhat longer protracted, by little and little afterward remits, and
at length the sick leisurely grow well; if this Disease has rooted it self
more deeply, there is need of fit Remedies, and an exact method of curing, the
Fever growing worse is to be healed, according to the Rules to be observed in
a Putrid Fever: but nevertheless with this difference, that, because
transpiration being hindered, and the suffusion of the serous humor on the
Lungs, are chiefly in fault, therefore Diaphoretic Remedies, and those called
pectoral are of more frequent use, for these restrain the flowing forth of the
serum, from the Vessels within, or by opening the Pores convey it forth of
doors; or precipitating it from the bosom of the Blood, send it forth be the
urinary passages; therefore the method of Medicine for this Disease, being
brought into the worser state, respects both the feverish intemperance, for
the sake of curing which you are to be directed, according to the intentions
shown in the Putrid Fever, and also the Rheumatic Distemper, which however let
it be secondary, and not every expectorating Remedy, or those used against a
Cough are to be admitted, but of that kind only which do not increase the
Fever: the forms of these, and the means of curing, are to be sought from the
precepts, delivered generally for the Cure of the Putrid Fever, and of the
Cough; the helps, which now, by frequent experience, are commonly said to bring
Cure chiefly in this Disease, are sweating, or the provoking of sweat, and
letting of Blood: for the Vessels being emptied by this or that means, both the
immoderate heat of the Blood, and the abundance of the serum, are restrained.

A Description of an Epidemical Fever arising about the beginning of Autumn
1658. taken the 13th of September.
THE vernal Fever but now described, did not last longer than six weeks, that
it plainly was seen, that it was only a more light flowring of the Blood, which
swelling up in the Spring, and at the same time straightened in space, for want
of ventilation, most impetuously boiled up, like new Wine close shut up in
Bottles, and then ceased of it self. Yet from thence, as neither the year, so
neither our Blood did recover its due temperature, and so another tinder or
nest for a new Fever, was quickly gathered together. Because after the Summer
solstice, the North wind still blowing, a cold season remained for a long
while; so that the Fruit and Corn this year, was feared by the Husbandmen,
would scarce be thoroughly ripened; but after this, a little before the
beginning of July, a most fierce heat followed, for several days: and when the
Dog days were begun, the Air grew most cruelly hot, that one could scarce
endure the open Air. By reason of this heat and cold in excess, the temperature
of this year was very unequal: wherefore, there was a necessity, for our Blood
to be now fixed, and as it were congealed, now too much roasted, and so
perverted from its natural disposition, to a scorched, and melancholy temper;
also it came to pass that the Pores of the skin were much altered from their
right constitution, that by that means, an insensible transpiration could not
be performed, after the wonted manner.

From the time that the former Fever ceased, almost to the end of the Dog
days, there was a state of health, and free from all popular Diseases; but then
a few here and there among the Villages, and in lesser places, first fell sick;
but afterward, about the end of August, a new Fever suddenly arising, began
to spread through whole Regions, everywhere round about us; also, this as the
other which spread the last Autumn, raged chiefly in Country Houses and
Villages; but in the mean time, few of the Inhabitants of the greater Towns and
Cities fell sick. At the same time, in other Regions, situate at a distance
from us, yea, almost throughout England, the Epidemical Fever was said to
rage; and in some other places, to be far more deadly, than it was about our
Country. Perhaps the Idea of this Fever now reigning, had not the provision of
its symptoms alike in all places, or was noted wholly with the same appearances
and accidents: yet whatever it showed in our parts, as to its nature, I shall
briefly and succinctly add, from our own proper observation, or what I had
learnt, being communicated from others.

About the beginning of this Disease, its figure was wandering, and very
uncertain; because in some there was a continual fervor, in others it was
intermitting, being renewed by set fits; but at this time it happened to very
many, as a pathognomic symptom, that they were ill in their brain, and nervous
stock, that presently from the very beginning of this Fever, almost all
complained of their head being grievously distempered: For a cruel headache
infested some, and hardness of hearing, with a noise in the ears troubled
others, but to most was wont to happen, either a stupidness, and heavy
sleepiness, with a vertiginous Distemper, or pertinacious wakings, with a
delirium, and distractions of the animal spirits. I have observed in some, that
on the first or second day of their sickness, that little broad and red spots,
like to the measles, have leisurely broke forth in the whole body, which being
shortly vanished, the Fever presently became stronger, and especially the
Distempers of the head, far more grievous. From thence a benumedness of the
senses, and a sleepiness fell upon some for many days, that they lay a long
while as if dying, without speaking, or knowledge of their friends. I knew
others to have fallen from hence into a Lethargy, and others cast into an
Apoplexy, and some into a Frenzy, and Delirium. Of these, the younger, and
strong men (yet not without a long languishment, and doubtful recovery) most of
them escaped; in the mean time, old men, or other ways weak and sickly,
generally died. Those who fell sick with the Fever, as it were continual, with
those notes of malignity, were more rare, and the distempered were only
sporadically, in some houses only. But the sickness which most commonly spread
about us, fell upon most, and tho it cruelly raged, it seemed to imitate an
intermitting Fever, to wit, either a Tertian, or a Quotidian: for that the
sick had fits, either every day, or (which I more often observed) every other
day, which infested them grievously, and a long while, with cold, heat, and
sweat, succeeding in order: but these kind of fits, as also the course of the
whole Disease, were wont to be noted with diversity, according to the age and
temper of the sick; and with various concourse of symptoms, and accidents. Yet
this was common to most of (I had like to have said all) the sick that together
with the Fever, they were troubled with Cephalic Distempers.

When therefore any one was troubled with this Disease, (whether the sickness
was excited from an evident cause, or Contagion, or without any manifest
occasion) its coming betrayed it self, by a pain in the head, and often in the
loins, with thirst, want of appetite, spontaneous weariness, and heat tho not
strong: if it happened in a young Body of a florid Blood, and more hot temper,
the fits wanted the cold and shivering, about its beginning, but they were very
troublesome, and sharp, with long heat: The sick were often troubled with
vomiting, and their head aked cruelly for the most part; sweat difficulty
succeeded, which being often partial and quickly broke off, rarely cured the
fit, but when the sweat failed, they grew hot again, that scarce in 18 or 24
hours the fit was finished in some. In the mean time, from the Blood being very
fervent, the fantasy was disturbed, that oftentimes a Delirium, absurd or
idle talking, wakings, and high inquietudes were stirred up during the fit; but
the same being finished, in the time between, still a troublesome thirst, a
slow heat, languor of spirits, and great debility of strength, with an headache,
and a vertiginous Distemper, for the most part molested them. It was rarely
found, for any to find themselves indifferently well, as in a common Tertian,
between the fits. About the beginning of the Disease, the feverish
fiercenesses were somewhat more mild, which afterward at every turn, leisurely
grew worse, and then began with cold and shaking; to which nevertheless, after
a long and very troublesome heat, sweat very hardly succeeded in most, so that
the fit rarely ended in its due temper. Within six or seven periods, the
strength of the sick was much cast down, that being made languid, and weak,
they had an hard task to struggle with the Disease: because unless Nature were
succored by Art, the Fever still prevailed, and rarely or never in a short
time, was it cured by a Crisis, or leisurely remitted; but it brought the sick
into great streights, by its long siege, and still persisting, till the Blood
being by its frequent deflagration made very liveless and watery, was unable to
grow too hot in the Vessels of its own accord, or to be inkindled more
plentifully in the heart, and then oftentimes, became so dead, and wanting of
spirits, that, being insufficient for the continuing of the Vital Lamp, it
brought in Death. But sometimes the mass of Blood being depraved, and made
poor, by this Disease, was able (tho hardly) to continue the half extinct Vital
Fire, and to renew it by little and little, with spirit and vigor, in a long
time: yet in the mean time, after the height of this Disease, when the Blood
being made more weak and impure, could not expel forth of doors this feverish
matter, or adust recrements, by a critical motion, it often transferred it to
the Brain; and therefore about the height of this Fever, a torpor, and
stupidity of spirits, sleepiness, vertigo, tingling of the ears, tremblings,
and convulsive motions, with a great oppression of the whole animal faculty,
were most often induced.

Men of a more cold temperament, or in years, who were taken with this Disease,
although they were but little feverish, were wont however to be in greater danger
of Life; because, in these, besides the disposition of the Blood, not easily
reducible, also what was gathered together in the fits, that was extraneous and
not to be mixed, was hardly subdued, and difficultly sifted forth of the mass
of Blood; wherefore, both the Blood was still more notably depraved in its
Crasis, and in every fit more infected by the impure mixture: Moreover the
nervous Liquor was greatly perverted from its due temper, and defiled most
badly, by the adust recrements continually poured on the Brain. Therefore, when
old men, melancholic, or otherways sickly persons, fell into this Fever, they
became, presently after its first assault, stupefied, and for the most part
vertiginous: Tho in the fits, the heat was not very sharp and piercing, they
were however very unquiet, and still tossing about, oftentimes they talked
idly, and at random; after a long burning, either no sweat, or only partial,
and often broke off, followed; whereby the fit was not fully helped, but that
in the whole intervals, the sick were thsrsty, and remained very ill, with a
dryness of the mouth, a scurfiness of the Tongue, and a suffusion of a viscous
filth. After some fits, their strength being exceedingly cast down, they were
wholly fixed to their Beds, or rise only for a little while, could scarce stand
or set a foot before another, to move from place to place, or able to walk: in
the mean time, they labored with a languishment, a difficult breathing, a
nummedness of senses, and a great debility of the whole nervous stock: The
Urine in most was highly red, of a more deep color, and of a thicker
consistency, than in a common Tertian: The Pulse, whilst the strength was not
wholly cast down, for the most part was strong and equal; afterward, when the
sick became very languishing, it was weak and unequal, and oftentimes
intermitting; to which also, constructures of the tendons, and convulsive
motions in the wrists, being joined, were for the most part prognostics of
Death. Those who leisurely being debilitated, declined toward Death, some
little time before they died, lay for the most part without speaking, or
knowing those about them, as it were stupid: and it rarely happened in this
Fever, that any one about to die, was so perfect in their memory and
intellect, as to dispose of their Family affairs, or to take leave of their
friends. But it happened to those who escaped, from a deep languishment and
almost desperate condition, not quickly, or suddenly to recover, from their
manifest evil disposition, but lying a long while wavering, stupefied, and
without strength, that Nature at length, not but after a doubtful and difficult
strife, got indeed scarcely the better of the Disease, and then recovered
strength by degrees, and health lingringly and slowly.

If the nature, and formal reason of this Epidemical Fever but now described,
be demanded, we say, that this (as that of the former year) properly is an
intermitting Fever: for what commonly spread bore that figure; although some here
and there, more rarely, had it continual, which we shall by the way mention by
and by. The seed plot or seminary of this, need not be derived from the air,
being infected with any Infection, but rather its leading cause is to be
sought, from the undue constitution of the year, and from thence an
indisposition of our Blood being acquired. Because, in the Spring and Autumn,
intermitting Fevers have yearly sprung up and increased; to wit, for that our
Blood, like to the juice of Vegetables, is wont to be more lively moved than
usual, and to flower at those times. Wherefore if the mass of Blood, by reason
of the foregoing season, of the Summer, or Winter, should be altered from its
due temperature, and should contract either a sharp or atrabilous disposition,
or of any other kind, its evil dispositions begun before, are chiefly ripened
about the Equinoxes; to wit, when the Blood more freely fermenting (if that it
has departed from its natural disposition) does not so easily sanguifie, but
that it will be apt to pervert the alible juice, poured to it, into an
extraneous and feverish matter. When therefore this year, had not very much
declined from a right constitution, (as not only the Dog Days going before but
that the two solstices, and the equinoxes, were wholly intemperate, it was no
wonder if intermitting Fevers, more frequent than usual, and those noted with
some unusual symptoms, did increase about the Autumn. That therefore an
intermitting Epidemical Fever raged at this time, I judge it not to be
attributed to the fault of the present Air, but to the irregularities of the
foregoing season: yet from what causes and occasions, some symptoms proper to
this Fever, and distinct from the common rule of intermitting Fevers, did
arise, will be worth our Inquiry. I have already said, that the provision, that
made this Fever so deadly, consisted in two things, chiefly, viz. the temper
of the year, now extremely cold, then upon it very hot, then that it had
variously perverted the disposition of our Blood, and had distempered the pores
of the skin, with an undue constitution. According to the reasons taken from
either, I shall endeavor to explicate the accidents of this Disease, and to
assign the causes of its appearance.

1. First, We shall observe, that the type of this Fever was various, to wit,
in some with a continual heat, in others with an eruption of spots, but in most
intermitting, and like a Tertian, and sometimes (tho rarely) a Quotidian,
repeating the fits every day, or every other day: the cause of this diversity,
we impute to the more strong and potent morbific procatarxy of this year, which
produced in the Autumn, a more common intermitting Fever than it was wont,
wherefore, in some (perhaps endued with a more praved habit of Body) it stirred
up Fevers something malignant; and in whom it caused intermitting Fevers,
according to the wonted manner of the season, it made them to be noted with a
peculiar appearance of symptoms.

2. Those taken at this time, with the Epidemical Fever (whether it was
continual or intermitting) suffered presently evil Distempers of the head, viz.
now they were wont to be infested with cruel headache, now with a stupor, or
too great distraction of the Animal Spirits. The reason of this is, that the
nervous juice, as well as the Blood, by reason of the intemperance of the year,
was much altered from its due Crasis or Disposition, viz. by nature sweet and
spirituous, and was become now heavy, and almost lifeless, now sharp, and too
much pungitive. Besides, also, the mass it self of the Blood, very much
contributed to this evil; for whilst it grew hot, the vaporous effluvia, which
ought to have been dispersed outwardly, by reason of the Pores being shut up,
were poured upon the Brain, and membranes of the head: and by reason of this
kind of stopping, impressed almost on all, sweat hardly, and not but partial,
and often interrupted, succeeded in the fits; hence also in the height of the
Disease, a perfect Crisis, or spontaneous, rarely or never happened to Cure it;
but instead of this, if the business was committed to Nature, the adust matter,
or recrements gathered together in the Blood, were transferred to the head, and
there raised up now the sleepy evil, now Phrensies, and those long and stubborn.

3. That the fits sometimes begun without cold or shivering, but with a
troublesome heat, and were prolonged with a difficult sweat, partial, and often
interrupted; then forasmuch as the same being finished, the sick began again to
wax hot, that the fits were not finished without a long evaporation of a dry
breath; the cause was, the too sharp and bilous disposition of the Blood,
whereby when it grew turgid, it was stuffed rather with adust Salt and Sulphur,
than a serous juice, and presently conceived an inkindling, without any
previous Flux of nitrous matter; and therefore for want of serum, and by reason
of the Pores being shut up, its deflagration was continued for a long time,
almost only with a dry exhalation, and scarce at last ended in a remission. And
therefore the interstitia of the fits were most troublesome with heat, and
thirst, Headache, Vertigo, and other Distempers: because the feverish matter,
being heaped up in the Blood, was not all dispersed by the several fits, but
part of it being left after the fit, as it were extraneous and not miscible,
induced almost a continual burning.

4. It was observed, that those distempered with this Fever, presently lost
their strength and flesh, that after a fit or two, they panted for breath, and
being very weak, were not able to stand or go, without being led; when it is an
usual thing, in an intermitting Fever that is common, for the Patient to be
very lively and cheerful, between the fits: the reason of the difference is,
because in this Fever, the mass of the Blood is both more depraved by the
impure mixture of the degenerate juice, and especially, that the same is more
perverted from its natural disposition, and therefore, when it boyls up less
out of the fits, it yet ferments not rightly, and equally in the bosom of the
heart: wherefore, when by any more quick motion, or agitation of the Body, the
Blood is carried more impetuously into the bosom of the heart, because it is
not there presently inkindled, it both leaps forth of doors, and by its
stagnation, causes the oppression of the heart, and great weakening of the Vital
Spirits. By reason of this kind of dyscrasie of the Blood, to wit, whereby it
is made more unfit for due Fermentation and inkindling in the heart, also some
Beasts, and especially Horses, in the Spring time, are made hard breathed, and
very unapt to any rapid motion.

5. Lastly, We are to inquire, concerning this Fever, wherefore it spread
chiefly in Villages, in lesser Towns, and the Country, when Cities and greater
Towns were less troubled with it. It might seem that this Distemper, should be
excited from marshie Fogs, and other hurtful Vapors, plentifully heaped
together in this or that Tract of the Air: but there is a better reason, for
that the inhabitants of these kind of places, being more exposed to the Spring
cold, and then to the Summer heats, might have contracted a greater Dyscrasie
of the Blood, and so a more apt disposition to this Fever. For in truth, the
Inhabitants of the Country, could scarce go out of their houses, but they were
exposed to the Sun's Beams, or the fervor of the heated Air. Besides,
Countrymen, Husbandmen, and such as were accustomed to Labors (among whom this
Fever chiefly raged) from their immoderate toil in the Sun, or open Air, also
using a bad and sharp Diet, sooner acquired an adust and torrid disposition of
the Blood, and so more apt for this Disease, than Citizens and Townsmen, who
lived an idle life, and enjoyed wholesome food, and mostly continued within
doors, and in refrigerating shades. We may believe this assertion, for that not
only the Epidemical Fever now raging, but also another of the Autumn before,
excited by reason of the evil disposition of the Blood, increased chiefly among
the Countrymen, and inhabitants of the Country: but the popular Fever, which
arose in the middle of the Spring, depending chiefly upon transpiration being
hindered, mostly infested Citizens and the Inhabitants of Towns; whilst rustical
men, that were wont, by Labor and Exercise, to procure a more free breathing
forth, remained free.

The general Prognostication of this Disease, seems only to ominate or foretell,
the like evil almost to follow this, as followed the Epidemical Fever of the
former Autumn, to wit, (the Augury being taken rather from the intemperance of
our Blood, than from the evil of the Air) not the Pest, but a Quartane Fever
might be feared to come upon it. As to the particular Indication, as Signs that
promise Health or Death, I shall briefly mention them; and they chiefly respect
the temper and government, either of the Blood, with the Vital Spirit, or else
of the nervous juice, with the animal Spirit. If it be plainly indicated from
the Pulse, Urine, from Actions less hurt, and the appearance of other symptoms,
that the Blood, as to its feverish disposition, is not very much perverted,
from its natural temper; that in the fits it moderately burns forth; and in
every Combat easily subdues the load of the feverish matter, and wholly shakes
it off from its company; that after same fits, the mass of Blood is somewhat
restored toward its due temper; that it perverts little the alible juice, and
sifts forth, with a more gentle rising up, what is extraneous, and not
mingleable, and that if in the mean time, the other spirituous Liquor, rightly
inspires and waters the Brain, and nervous Bodies, that sleep, waking,
sensation, and motion, are performed well, or at least indifferently, all good
is to be hoped concerning the sick. But if it appears from the same Fountains
of Indications, that the Blood has acquired in this Fever, a disposition far
removed from the natural, if it perverts much of the alible juice, and then
from its extraneous and incongruous mixture, the Liquor of the Blood is greatly
disturbed, and the Spirits driven into confusion; if in the fits, the Blood too
strongly, and in a long time burns forth, yet does not truly subdue the
feverish matter, or exclude the whole, but that by its impure mixture, it is
still more and (in every feverish fit) more infected, and the Spirits being
continually consumed, it becomes poorer, we may pronounce the life of the
patient to be in much danger. Besides these, if the vices of the nervous juice
happen, that being altered from its due temper, or being too dull, and as it
were liveless, little actuates the Brain and nervous stock; or being above
measure sharp, continually provokes the same into Convulsions and Distractions;
and if besides the vaporous effluvias continually falling away from the Blood,
or the adust recrements being wont to be sifted forth by a critical sweat,
should be transferred into the head, and there induce Lethargic or Phrensical
Distempers, the hopes of health will be little, and we may fear a very deadly
event.

Concerning the Cure of this Disease, the intentions will come under three
considerations chiefly. First, a quick reduction (as much as may be) of the
Blood, and nervous Liquor, to their natural tempers, or at least a prevention
of their too great depravation. Secondly, Concerning the right handling the
fits of the fick it ought to be procured, First, that less of the degenerate
juice, may be gathered together, for matter of the fit; Secondly, that what is
gathered together may be wholly dispersed by every fit, that thereby the sick
may be better in the intervals; Thirdly, that the Body being altered for the
better the fits may be inhibited by anti-feaverish Remedies. The third
intention respects the symptoms chiefly urging, which should be timely opposed,
whereby Nature, being not hindered, may reduce whatsoever intemperance may be
contained in the Viscera or Vessels, may subdue and sift forth the extraneous
matter, and at length may recover a lively force and pristine vigor.

First, therefore, for the reduction and emendation of the Blood and nervous
juice, diverse manners of evacuations are wont to be exhibited in this Disease,
about the beginning of the Sickness, with good success. It appears plainly from
Modern practice, that vomitories are of more noted use in this Distemper, than
in a common Tertian: wherefore in a robust Body, and prone to Vomit, about the
beginning of the second or third fit, it is convenient to give an Emetic
Medicine. The operation of this seems to be very helpful in this Fever,
forasmuch as it more plentifully evacuates the filth from the ventricle, and
the yellow bile from the choler-bearing Vessels; and because it copiously
presses forth the serous juice from the emunctories of the nervous stock,
planted about the Pancreas and Intestines, and by provoking them draws it out.
Wherefore we observe, that from a Vomit being taken, the sick do find
themselves better about the Distempers of the Head. A Purge (to whom a Vomit is
not convenient) may be ordered instead of it, the day following the fit, also
tho an Emetic have been taken, it may be well permitted after a fit or two: But
yet only with gentle and benign Physic, let it be performed, which will not
disturb or too much move the Blood. We were wont in these Fevers, letting
alone Diagridium or any Aloetic Medicine, only to give an infusion or Powder of
Senna, Rhabarb, and yellow Sanders, with Tartar and Salt of Wormwood; and to
celebrate this kind of Purgation not very long after the beginning of the
Disease: But at other times to keep the Belly soluble, with the frequent use of
Clysters. Frequent experience has sufficiently taught, that Letting of Blood is
highly profitable in this Disease: for when by reason of the Pores in every
one, being more strictly closed than usual, the Blood growing hot, by the
Fever, wanted Ventilation, the Letting of Blood supplies the place of a more
free breathing forth, and prevents the restrained effluvia, from so readily
suffusing themselves on the Brain and nervous stock. But this Remedy is chiefly
indicated from the very fervent Blood, and more hot temperament, nor ought to
be indifferently used to old men, Phlegmatic, and other very weak persons,
unless perhaps in a small quantity, that the mass of Blood may be somewhat
eventilated, and that the removal of the feverish matter into the Brain, may
be hindered. If it be convenient to open a Vein, let it be done about the
beginning of the Fever, or at least before the fourth or fifth fit, viz.
before the Blood is made very lifeless by the frequent deflagration, and
rendered too impure by the confusion of the adust matter: because, if Phlebotomy
be made use of, whilst the Blood is highly corrupted, the Vital Spirits, and by
that means the strength of the sick are more debilitated, nor yet is there any
thing taken away, from the power of the Disease, or from its cause. There
remains another famous way of evacuation, in this Fever, to wit, Vesicatory
Plasters applied to various parts of the Body; these are commonly observed to
be so helpful, that those that abhor and dislike very much such a Remedy, by
the example of others being the better for them, have admitted them. By what
means they separate the Cuticula from the skin, and lift it up like a Bladder
filled with Water; or whether they press forth this watery and limpid humor,
out of the Arteries, or out of the nerves, is not in this place to be inquired
into; yet that they are profitably administered in this Disease, besides
experience, Reason seems something to persuade; because it in some manner
compensates the want of transpiration, by the large profusion of this kind of
serous Latex: Moreover, this kind of Remedy, as it were opens the ways and
doors, by which both the Blood, and nervous juice, may forthwith send forth by
a proper purging, the extraneous matter, confused with them; wherefore, in the
Plague, and Malignant Distempers, Vesicatories are esteemed very profitable.
Also it appears by common observation, that in this, and other Fevers,
frequent at the same time, they did prevent the more grievous Distempers of the
Head, and were wont to help them, if they were brought in before: wherefore,
epispatic Plasters, may be applied about the beginning of the Disease, for
preservation sake, to Phlegmatic persons, elderly people, and men of a more
cold temper; and they are wont profitably to be administered to several others,
laboring with a Vertigo, Stupefaction, or cruel Headache, for the Cure of the
same Distempers. But in constitutions very hot, where with the defect of the
serum, the Blood is too much burnt, and if those sick of the Fever are
obnoxious to wakings, or a Frenzy, with intolerable heat, blisterings seem
then to be of little use.

For the mending of the temper of the Blood, and also the tenor of the Viscera,
at vacant times, when there is leisure from purging, attemperating Remedies
have place, and digestives, which fuse the Liquor of the Blood, and separate
its faeculencies, and as it were by precipitating them, thrust them toward the
emunctuaries: For these sort of intentions, are wont to be given Juleps, and
refrigerating Decoctions, sharpened with spirit of Vitriol, of Salt, Tamarinds,
or with the juice of Oranges or Lemons; forms of which choice enough are
commonly to be had. Also for this end acetous, saline, and shelly Powders are
used, to wit, prepared out of Tartar, Salnitre, the fixed Salt of Herbs, of
burnt Hartshorn, also the claws and eyes of Crabs. As for example, take of
Cream of Tartar drams three, of Salt of Wormwood dram one and an half; the Dose
half a dram, in an opening Decoction, twice in a day out of the fit. Or take of
Cream of Tartar dram one, of the Powder of Crabs eyes dram one, of purified
Nitre half a dram, mingle them, let them be taken after the same manner. Or
take of Hartshorn burnt drams two, of the Spirit of Vitriol, what the Powder
will drink up, the Dose is one scruple, it is of excellent use when those in
Fevers are infested with Worms. These kind of Remedies, promote the secretion
of the feverish matter, and also restore the almost destroyed ferments of the
Blood, and Viscera.

The second intention, viz. concerning the right handling the fits, comprehends
more. First, there ought to be instituted a right order of Diet, whereby the
more full heaping up of the degenerate juice, for the matter of the fit, may be
inhibited; wherefore, they are only to be fed with thin aliments, and they must
wholly abstain from flesh, (or broth made of it) Eggs, strong Drink, and all
rich meats and food whatsoever; and be contented only with Barley Broth, or
Grewel, Panada, Whey, and small Beer: for that a more plentiful aliment is not
digested, or assimilated, but loads the Ventricle, and being poured into the
Blood, disturbs its Liquor, and compels it to grow impetuously hot. In the
beginning of the fit, and the time of its duration, no food should be taken,
unless for the allaying of thirst: But for the tempering of heat and thirst,
Juleps, and cooling Decoctions, and especially small Beer, and posset Drink
should be granted. Secondly, a little before the coming of the fit is expected,
a gentle Medicine may be administered, which may drive away the fit by
preventing it, or make it more easy by procuring a sweat: for this use, the
febrifuge potion of the most learned Riverius serves well, of the Water of
Carduus, with oil of Sulphur, and salt of Wormwood: Or take of Cream of Tartar,
of salt of Wormwood, and the seeds of Nettles, each one scruple, let it be
given in the Decoction of the Roots of Sorrel; when the Fever begins to
decline, and that the fits are a little more remiss, proper febrifuges, applied
outwardly, often inhibit the comings of the fits. Yet in the mean time, so long
as the fits of the Fever return, the sick are to be handled so, that in every
fit, the feverish matter heaped in the Blood, may be thoroughly dispersed;
wherefore, when sweat hardly succeeds, it should be a little excited by
temperate Medicines. Also the sick should be kept in bed, with a gentle
breathing many hours, nor quickly permitted to rise; for I have often observed,
that sick persons have been still worse, because impatient of their bed, they
have put on their clothes before the vaporous effluvia were sufficiently
exhaled.

Thirdly, as to the symptoms, and particular accidents, wherewith the sick are
wont to be infested in this Fever, it is sufficiently provided for most of
them, with Remedies, in the method of Cure hitherto described: again thirst,
the heat of the mouth, the scurfiness of the tongue, vomiting, the looseness,
fainting, swooning, may be referred hither, very well the prescriptions
commonly used in other Fevers: but what may seem to require in this Disease a
peculiar method of healing, are chiefly the Distempers of the head and brain,
with the nervous stock, which not being timely helped, may soon put the sick
into great danger of life: As to the indications of these kind of evils of the
head, they are of a twofold kind; if it appears from a stupefaction or torpor,
a Sleepiness, Vertigo, or Headache, that the nervous juice is become too dull,
and as it were vapid or lifeless, and therefore does not sufficiently actuate
the brain, and nervous bodies; besides the Remedies already delivered, and
especially vesicatories, Medicines full of a volatile salt do chiefly help:
wherefore, spirits of Hartshorn, and of Blood, also the salts of them, are of
excellent use: but if the nervous Liquor be too sharp, or the effluvia suffused
from the estuating Blood, drive the Animal Spirits into confusions or
distractions, Remedies of the same sort of volatile salt are administered with
success in a little smaller quantity. Besides, a frequent letting of Blood, and
asswaging Medicines, against its Fervor, help much; as Emulsions, Whey, and
simple Water, plentifully drunk; Opiats are cautiously to be given in this
Fever, for the Frenzy being often allayed by them, is changed into a
Lethargy, or a deep stupefaction.

THE AUTHORS EPISTLE TO Dr BATHURST.
Worthy Sir,
THE Inspection of Vrines, and from them an investigation of directions
concerning the Medicinal practice, began to be esteemed among the Ancients,
even from the first beginning of Medicine: for from hence for the making of
judgments concerning the Sick, and for the choosing the most fit times for
Curing, the great Hippocrates has chiefly taken both his praenotions, and his
precepts, so that that famous and to this day approved statute of old Medicine,
to wit, (...), to compose Medicine according to digestions, cannot be observed
without rightly consulting the Vrinal. Also this seems consonant to common
reason, that for as much as we cannot search into the most intimate parts of
the sick Body, as it were a Vessel shut up, judgment is sought from the infused
liquor, washing all its parts, and taking from many some little parcels. For
neither more certainly do the acidulous or Spaw-waters, show the nature of the
hidden Mine, through which they are strained, than Vrines give testification of
the diverse manners of dyscrasies of our Bodies, and their habitudes. Wherefore
the Contemplation of this Excrement, (as vile as it is) has grown to a
Science, and has exercised the ingenuities of the most excellent Physicians,
both Ancient and Modern. Concerning this thing there are many Books extant,
writ with great diligence; in which are rehearsed the great differences of
Vrines, varieties of Colors, and diversities of Consistence, and their
Contents exactly described, and distinct precepts are delivered for every
excretion of them: Which indeed are esteemed by some of so great certitude,
that from the inspection of the water, a signification is sought of any
Disease, or of the part affected; yea of every accident concerning the sick.
But in this the common people are egregiously deceived, and still
pertinaciously will be deceived, whilst they imagine the knowledge of every
Disease, and the prognostication of it cannot be found out, but by inspecting
the Urine; and esteem a Physician of little worth unless he undertakes to
divine from the Vrinal as from a Magical Glass. But indeed, as to what belongs
to the precepts, and rules, whereon the reason of Judgment by Urine does
depend, there are many collected by diligent observation, that are extant, and
from thence established with good reason and judgment: yet for as much as the
signification of Vrines is by some too largely extended to particular Cases,
very many uncertain things interwoven, and some obnoxious to deceit, and others
plainly false; therefore who shall confidently pronounce concerning the
business of the Sick, by the judgment only of the Water, deserves rather the
name of a juggling Quack, than of a Physician.

But this Doctrine concerning Vrines, abounds so ordinarily with errors, that
the observations which belong to its practice, are either wrongfully made, or
not well reduced into method. We may lawfully suspect that the observations are
not rightly made, because, perhaps from one or two particular cases, oftentimes
a general Rule is established. For Example sake, because some Hydropical people
render a thin and watery Urine, therefore it is affirmed, such sort of Vrines
necessarily denote a Dropsy, when also in some other diseases, such like
Vrines are made; and sometimes in the Dropsy, the Urine are thick, and full of
redness. Also as it is most commonly received, that Vrines on which a cream
does swim (as on water that has Tartar boiled in it) does denote a
Consumption, which is most uncertain, because this sign is more proper and
familiar to Hypochondriacks, than to Consumptive people: And how many dye of
Consumptions without this? Besides, what is generally asserted, to wit, that in
all diseases whatsoever, Nature does make known the Disease by the Urine, is
altogether false; because sometimes sick people make their Urine like healthful
people; and sometimes those who are very well in health, by reason of some
accident (perhaps from the meats eaten) have suspected Urine, varying from the
natural state or condition. As to what belongs to the method, or doctrine
delivered by most, concerning Vrines, they seem to be altogether Empirical, and
nothing rational: for the naked differences of Vrines are rehearsed, and are
wont to be distinguished according to their color, consistency, and contents:
thence are opposed to the several species of these pathologick significations,
collected only from more rare observations; when in the mean time, the causes
of the appearances, nor of the preternatural alterations in the Vrines, are not
assigned, as they ought to be; nor is the signification of the Vrines applied
to the Causes of diseases, but only to the Disease or Symptom; and therefore it
is most often deceitful, and uncertain; because the same morbifick Cause, and
signification of the same Urine, may in like manner mediately respect at once
diverse Diseases, and Symptoms. As for Example, a thin and watery Urine most
often immediately denotes Indigestion, or a defect of Concoction in the
Viscera: nevertheless, by reason of that condition of Crudity, the
Green Sickness in Virgins, sometimes the Dropsy, or the white watery
phlegmacy, sometimes Headaches, and many other diseases arise. But the task
which you have required of me, Worthy Sir, to wit, That the notions which in
times past we have discoursed together, and conceived concerning Vrines, as it
were collected notes, and what have since fallen under my own knowledge, by my
proper study and observation, concerning this thing, should be framed into a
little Treatise, and that I should write a plain, and new method of
Vrinoscopie. I confess the work greater than can well be performed by our own
proper strength: however, I have resolved as much as I am able, to obey you
therein. But that a doctrine or method concerning Vrines may be instituted,
beyond the vulgar and plainly Empirical manner of Philosophising, there shall
be these two heads of our Discourse. To wit, First that the Anatomy of Urine
may be delivered, of what elements and parts it consists; and also its genesis
in our Body; to wit, by what Concoction this kind of Liquor is made, and then
by what secretion of some Particles from others. Secondly, That the inspection
of urines in the Vrinal may be truly unfolded, and what may be the Rules, and
the Certitude of Vromancie, or divination of the Urine.

OF URINES.
CHAP. I. Of the Elements and chief Accidents of Urine.
WHEN the Liquor of the Urine, being either fresh rendered from the body, or
putrified by a long digestion, is exposed to a spagirick Analysis, it is wont
to be resolved into these parts or principles: In the Distilling, first,
ascends whatever of a vinous spirit is in it, diluted with water; but yet in fo
very small quantity, that it is not easily to be perceived by the taste it
self. To this follows a watery liquor, large enough in proportion, with which
are mixed some more loose particles of Salt, and Sulphur especially. Thirdly,
There is stilled forth a very penetrative water; which is commonly called the
spirit of Urine, but in truth almost without any vinous spirit, and is chiefly
phlegm highly sharpened with Salt, and therefore it ascends last, as in the
distillation of Vinegar: but forasmuch as the salt of Urine is volatile, but
that of Vinegar only in the Flux; therefore the liquor stilled forth, which is
greatly impregnated with its particles, is very acid: That which is imbued with
the saline Particles of the other, is exceeding sharp and pricking. It is a
sign that this kind of Spirit of Urine (as it is commonly known) ows its
sharpness chiefly to the Salt; because, though it be most subtle it will not
take fire, but being put to it extinguishes it. After the humidity is wholly
exhaled, another portion of Salt remains with the earth, in the bottom of the
cucurbit; to which if a more hot fire be made, that Salt will be sublimed into
the Alembick, and the earthy feces only remain. This kind of Anatomy of Urine
plainly shows, that the Elements of which its liquor is composed, are a great
deal of Water and Salt, and a little of Sulphur and Earth, and a very little of
Spirit.

The saltness in Urines is perceived by the taste and touch; it comes nearest
to a Nitrous salt in savor: It is drawn indeed from saline particles of things
eaten, which being more plentifully exalted by the concoction in the Bowels,
and the circulation in the Vessels, for the most part go into a volatile Salt.
That is truly Salt and Spirit, by reason of the long accompanying of either
together, are gathered into a most strict bond; and therefore it happens, that
the Salt it self otherways fixed, is carried up on high, and rendered able for
motion, as it were by the wings of the other. Urines contain in them more or
less of Salt, according to the disposition of our body, and have it either more
volatile or fixed; which are therefore of a diverse color and consistency.

That there is Sulphur contained in Urines, their quickly putrefying, and
stink, sufficiently testify: it arises from the fat and sulphurous particles
of Meats, in the concoction being most minutely broken, and boiled with the
serum and salt; so as also there is less plenty of Spirit in it, than is in
Blood, Soot, or the Horns of Animals: wherefore in the distillation of Urine,
there ascends nothing almost of an oily form or fat. But indeed, whilst the
blood is circulated in the Vessels, the spirituous and sulphurous little
bodies, which fall away from it, do for the most part evaporate out of doors;
in the mean time, the saline recrements, and the watery, chiefly constitute the
Piss: nevertheless, Urines do always participate a little of sulphur, but its
quantity and proportion, is diversely altered according to the various degrees
of Concoction and Crudity; and thence also the color and consistence receive
many mutations in Urines.

That there is but a very little of vinous spirit in Urines, the defect of it
in the liquor first distilled forth, also the soon putrefying of the Stale do
testify: but that there is some, the intestine motion of the particles in the
Urine, does argue, to wit, the departure of the thin from the thick, and the
spontaneous separation of some parts from others, and a collection of them into
a settlement: besides, the saline particles (for that they are made volatile)
are married to spirituals, and so they are of a more ready motion, and energy;
yet according to the diverse plenty of spirits in Urines, and their power, there
arise diverse manners of hypostases and settlements; also the Urines themselves,
sooner or slower putrify.

The watery part of the Urine far exceeds the rest in quantity, and is greater
than they by almost a sixth part: it is not so simply drawn forth by
distillation, but that some particles of Salt and Sulphur (for as much as they
are volatile) ascend with it, and impart to the water an ungrateful stink: the
potulent matter, copiously taken with aliments, affords an original to this;
which of what kind soever it be, before it is changed into Urine, lays aside
its proper qualities, and acquires others; for truly, from the assumed liquor,
there is nothing sincere almost left in the Piss, besides mere humidity.

That there is earth, and muddy feces to be had in Urines, its distillation, or
evaporation sufficiently declares: for when the rest of the parts are exhaled,
the earth as it were a caput mortuum, will remain in a moderate quantity in the
bottom: Forasmuch as in the nourishing juice, there is required something solid
besides the active principles of salt, sulphur, and spirit, whence the bulk and
magnitude of the body grows; the recrements of this, viz. the earthy
feculencies, are plentifully dissolved in the serum, and contribute to it a
thick consistence and contents: but these show themselves after a diverse
manner, according to the state of Concoction and Crudity.

These are the principles which constitute the body of the Urine, also into
which it is easily resolved, by a Chemical Analysis: Out of the diverse changes,
and various contemperation of these, the other accidents of Urine arise, viz.
Quantity, Color, Consistency, and Contents, which are as to the sense the most
notable concerning it, and the chief objects of the rendered Urine: For when
there is nothing almost beheld besides in the Piss, they constitute these first
Phenomenon, in which rightly solved, consists the whole Hypothesis of this
Science: Wherefore we shall speak in the next place concerning these, and first
of the Urine of healthful people, what its quantity may be, how colored, with
what consistence and contents endued; and together shall be unfolded, out of
what mixture of Elements, and by what Concoction in the Viscera, and Vessels,
each of these depend. Secondly, shall be shown how many ways the Urines of Sick
people vary from the square or Rule of this of the Sound: and I shall endeavor
to assign, for the several differences of them, proper Causes of their
alterations; and these shall conclude our first proposition in this Discourse,
viz. the Anatomy of Urine.

CHAP. II. Of the Quantity and Color of the Urines of Sound People.
THE Quantity of the Urine in sound people ought to be a little less than the
humor, or liquid substance daily taken; for moist and drinkable things daily
taken, are the matter it self of which Urines are first made: But these (hunger
and thirst urging) are more plentifully required, both that they may
sufficiently wash the mass of the Chyme, by which means it may rightly ferment
in the Viscera; and that they may serve for a Vehicle, both to the Chyme,
whereby it may be conveyed to the bloody Mass, and to the Blood it self, that
it might be circulated in the Vessels without thickening; and to the Nervous
Juice, whereby it might actuate and water the Organs of sense and motion: when
the serous Latex by this means has bestowed whatever it has almost of Spirit
and Sulphur, for nourishment, Heat, and Motion, it gives way to a new
nutritious humor; and it self as unprofitable, being secluded from the Blood,
by the help of the Reins is sent away. The nourishing liquor, which will at
last be changed into Urine, of its own nature is diverse, viz. now watery, now
impregnated with Spirit, now with Salt and Sulphur, and according to the
various forces of this or that Element in it Urines are wont to be somewhat
altered: However all liquors taken in at the mouth, do not pass through our body
whole and untouched; but that they undergo mutations in various parts, and lose
a little portion of their quantity, before they are made into Urine: For the
Latex or Humor to be converted into Urine, is first of all received into the
Ventricle, (for I assent not to Reusner, who affirms the same falling for the
most part on the Lungs, to cause the more quick making water after drinking)
whilst that it stays in the Ventricle, it is there boiled; also impregnated
with Salt and Sulphur of its own, or from more solid Aliments dissolved: then
very much of it is confused in the blood, with the nourishable juice; which,
when it is a long time Circulated, from thence receives a farther tincture of
Salt and Sulphur, according to the various temper of the Blood, and its
inkindling in the Heart: Hence some portion of it is derived with the Animal
Spirit, to the Brain and nervous stock; and afterward from thence, being made
lifeless and weak, is lastly reduced into the bosom of the Blood; after that it
has bestowed on the Blood and Nervous Juice, whatever of generous or noble is
contained in the Serum, also no small quantity is consumed by sweat and the
other emunctories; what remains, whilst that the Blood continually washes the
Reins, a precipitation being made, either by a straining or force of a certain
ferment, it is there separated from the Blood, and from thence passes through
the Ureters into the Bladder, and so is carried forth of doors.

From the origin and lustration of the Serous Latex, but now described, it
plainly appears, that the Urine ought to answer to the quantity of the liquids
taken, in somewhat a lesser proportion, perhaps under a third part; which
plainly shows the disposition and strength of the Viscera serving for
Concoction, as also the temper and distribution of the Blood it self, and after
a sort of the nervous juice; moreover it carries with it signs of the
affections of the Urinary passages. The quantity of the Urine declines often
from this Rule, so that sometimes it superabounds, also sometimes is deficient:
and either for a short time, may consist with a disposition not much
unhealthful; but if these kind of distempers continue long, they argue a sickly
condition. Concerning these we shall speak among the appearances of the Urine
in a diseased condition of the Body; we shall now next consider the color of a
sound Urine.

The Urine of Sound People, which is rendered after Concoction is finished in
the Body, is of a Citron color, like Lie a little boiled: which without doubt
proceeds from the Salt and Sulphur of the nutritious juice, and the Blood,
dissolved in the Concoction, and boiled in the Serum. This color does not
arise only from Salt (as some would have it) because the Liquor impregnated
with Salt, unless it be evaporated to a certain thickness, will not grow
yellowish: Also Salt of Tartar, being dissolved by melting, continues still
clear. What may be objected concerning the Lie of Ashes, I say, there the whole
Sulphur is not consumed by burning, but the Citron color arises from some
saline Particles, and others Sulphurous burnt, and sticking together in the
Ashes, and then infused or boiled in the liquor. Neither does the Urine of
sound people acquire this same color from Sulphur only, because Sulphur in a
watery Menstruum, is not dissolved unless by the addition of Salt, nor will it
give any tincture of it self; but if Salt of Tartar and common Sulphur be
digested together in water, or if Antimony be boiled in a saline Menstruum,
both liquors will by that means grow yellow like Urine; after the like manner,
the saline and sulphurous Particles of Aliments, being incocted and most
minutely broken in the Serum, by a Digestion in the Ventricle and Intestines,
and by a Circulation with the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, impart to it a
Citron Color.

This kind of dissolution of Salt and Sulphur, by whose means the Urines are
made of a Citron Color, is first begun in the Bowels; and afterward perfected
in the Vessels, and very much depends upon the Concoction performed in the
Ventricle and the Intestines: For here, by the help of heat and of ferments,
the Aliments taken are chiefly subdued; the bond of mixture being broken, the
saline and sulphurous Particles being most smally broken, and made small, go
into a milkie Cream, and from thence the Serum remaining after that Concoction
and distribution of that milkie juice, becomes of a Citron color: after the
same manner, as when the Salt of Tartar and common Sulphur being dissolved
together, and mixed with some acid thing, indue a milkie color; then the
contents being separated by settling, the remaining liquor grows yellow like
Lie. If that the aliments, by reason of an evil disposition of the Ventricle,
are not rightly digested in the first Concoction, as in the Longing Disease or
Pica, the Dropsy, and other ill dispositions of the Bowels, usually comes to
pass, the Urine also is rendered crude, clear, and almost insipid, like Fountain
water; but if by reason of the ferments of the Viscera being more than duly
exalted, or otherways depraved as in the Scurvy, Hypochondriac distemper, or
Feavourish intemperance, the particles of things eaten are too much dissolved
in the first Region, by that means Urines are rendered red, and thick.

The Serum, as has but now been said, being imbued with a lixivial tincture in
the first Concoction, and confused in the Blood, so long as it is circulated
with it, it is yet further Concocted, and acquires a more deep color; for the
particles of the Blood being roasted and scorched, although for the most part
they are laid aside into the Gall bag, yet being in a manner boiled in the
Serous Latex, they heighten its color; hence the Concoction being ended, the
Urine which is first made, is more Pale, and that which is last, more Red. That
which is made after long fasting, is yet more high Colored. Where the Blood is
more cold, as in Cachectical people, the color of the Urine is made less;
where the Blood grows raging with a feavourish Heat, and is roasted, the Urine
grows highly Red.

Concerning the Urines of sound people, it is worth observation, that which is
made after plentiful Drinking, has no tincture, but is pale like water; of
which we shall enquire, by what means the Serous Latex so suddenly slides away
out of the Ventricle, (contrary to what is vulgarly believed) and passing
through all the Chyliferous passages, then the Veins, Arteries, the bosom of the
Heart it self, and the turnings and windings of the Veins, and Ureters, is put
forth of the Body within so short a space: moreover, how it comes that the
Urine being so precipitately made, contrary to most other things, is not only
changed into no Color in its passage, but it also loses its own proper: For as
the Proverb is, Our Drink goes thick in, and comes forth thin: or We Drink
thick Beer, and Piss clear.

Concerning this we say, that besides the long wandering of the nourishing
juice, to wit, whereby, after some stay in the Ventricle, it slides into the
Intestines, and from thence through the milkie Vessels into new passages, and
thence is carried into the Veins, (which carrying about cannot be quickly
performed) it is most likely, that there is another nearer passage of the same
Nutritious Juce, whereby indeed it may be conveyed immediately and without
delay to the Mass of Blood, and perhaps to the nervous Liquor; and therefore,
after fasting there immediately follows a most quick refection of strength and
spirits, after Eating, and especially after Drinking; which indeed cannot be
thought to be made by the Spirits and Vapors; also from such drinking, the
Urine is presently rendered, and indeed sooner than it can be thought, that the
Mass of the Chyle can be sent out of the bosom of the Ventricle; wherefore, it
is not improbable, that when the Alimentous Liquor is entered the Ventricle,
presently the more thin portion of it, which consists chiefly of Spirit and
Water, is imbibed by its Spongeous Membranes; and from thence being instilled
into the little mouths of the Veins, it is presently confounded with the Blood,
flowing back toward the Heart. For of this opinion (though not very
stubbornly) I always was, That the Chyme was in some measure immediately
derived from the Ventricle, and Intestines, by the branches of the Vena Porta,
into the Mass of Blood; and as the milkie passages carry it about by a long
compass, whereby it may be instilled into the descending Trunk of the Vena
cava; so that it may be carried in a more near way, viz. into the ascending
Trunk of the same, by these Vessels; forasmuch as the Blood being made poorer
in its Circulation, returning from either part, before it had entered the Heart,
it ought to be refreshed with a new juice, whereby it might more lively ferment
in the bosom of the Heart; but forasmuch as the much greater part of the Blood
is carried upwards, surely it may seem agreeable to truth, that at least some
portion of the nourishing Juice may be added to this, as it were a sustenance,
it being before burnt forth, and almost lifeless, for its new inkindling in the
Heart. The Arguments that seem to persuade to this, not of light moment, I
could here heap together, but I should so divert far from our proposition:
wherefore, that we so suddenly make a waterish Urine after Drinking, I esteem
to be done after a manner as was but now said; therefore the Liquor that is
carried so hastily from the Aliments to the Mass of Blood, passing through the
so narrow windings (as are the Membranes of the Viscera) being drawn as it were
by distillation, the more thick matter being rejected, consists almost only of
Water and Spirit; with which indeed it refreshes the vital Spirits, and dilutes
the Blood; about which task, when the spirituous part is consumed, the watery
Latex, because of its plenty, being heavy and troublesome, is continually sent
away by the Reins; and when it comes from the Ventricle, not yet imbued with
Salt and Sulphur, nor is long circulated with the Blood, that it might by that
means acquire a lixivial tincture, it is rendered thin, and clear.

CHAP. III. Of the Consistence and Contents of the Urine of Sound People.
SO much for the Quantity and color of Urines, which proceed from a sound
Body; but as to what belongs to the Contents, we must know, that there ought to
be nothing besides the Hypostasis in a sound Urine; but what this is, and by
what means it sinks down, remains to be unfolded in the next place.

So long as the Mass of Blood, being fused with the serous and nourishable
humor, is continually Circulated in the Vessels, from it a certain nutritious
juice is made, by a perpetual digestion, which being put continually to the
solid parts, goes into nourishment: This first of all is digested into a
glutinous humor, like the white of an Egg, afterward into thin Filaments or
Rags, which being interwoven in the Pores and little spaces of the solid parts,
still afford to them an increase of new substance; but whilst the Serum being
mixed with the Blood, washes all the Regions of the Body, it sucks up into it
self a certain superfluous portion of this last Aliment, to be laid on the
solid parts, and carries it forth of doors with it self; and this it is that
constitutes the Hypostasis or settlement in Urines; wherefore so long as this
is present, it indicates how far Concoction and Nutrition in some measure is
performed, and is accounted a laudable sign; its absence shows Crudity and
Cachectical people, or a Dyscrasie in Feavours; it consisting of small Threads
or Filaments, is dispersed at first through the whole body of the Urine, and
then is collected into a little Cloud, by this means. These Filaments or
Threads, are long, and smooth, also endued with some sharpnesses like
Brier-pricks, that from thence being shaken about, they easily lay hold of one
another, and are fastened together; even as if into an Urinal full of water, you
should cast many Hairs, and then by shaking about the Vessel, the hairs at
first swimming dispersedly, in a little time would lay hold on one another, and
be collected into a little bundle; after the same manner (as it seems) the
little threads which constitute the Hypostasis or settlement being variously
here and there agitated by the color and spirits implanted in the Urine,
entangle and thrust upon one another, until they gather into one little Cloud
by the mutual knitting of all together; and because these Filaments are
compacted, and more solid than the other Contents of the Urine, they sink
toward the bottom with their weight.

It is very likely, that these kind of Filaments, make the Hypostasis in the
Urines of Sound people, for that the Blood being well constituted, and disposed
to nourishment, is very much stuffed with Fibers, or white Filaments: because,
when a Vein is opened, if the Blood let out be received into warm water, it
will be conspicuous to any one; for the red thick substance being diluted with
the liquor, these smooth and white threads swim in the water; wherefore it
seems, that some of these thin or slender rags, being snatched away with the
serous juce, are the matter of this cloud subsiding in the Urine; wherefore in
Cachectical people, by reason of Crudity, the Blood being very waterish, and
unfit for nourishment, is destitute of these well labored Fibrils; also in
Dyscrasies, when the nutritious humor, the Blood being too much scorched, is
not rightly concocted into these kind of Filaments, the Hypostasis in Urines is
either wholly wanting, or is very confused and disturbed.

It is said to be a good and laudable Hypostasis, which is of a whitish color,
of a round and equal figure, and sinks toward the bottom, to which are
required, First, that that last Aliment be rightly labored, whereby the
Filaments may become white, smooth, and solid, like to slender Fibers.
Secondly, that the Urine be sufficiently strong in spirits, which (as is beheld
in the growing hot of Must, or new Wine) may agitate, and compel here and there
all parts. Thirdly, that the liquor be not too thick, nor that its Pores be
first possessed by strange bodies, whereby the motion of the contents may be
hindered, but that a sufficient space may be left, for the free agitating and
tossing about these kind of Particles.

If the substance be red, it is a sign that that last Aliment is scorched and
burnt, with too much heat; wherefore such a sediment, for the most part is in
the beginning of a Feavour, so long as the Coction in the Viscera and Vessels,
is not wholly perverted; if the Hypostasis be broken and unequal, it is a sign
that the nutriment destinated for the solid parts, is not rightly and equally
concocted, and that its Particles are not homogene, and alike in every part:
wherefore the Filaments do not cohere together, but these with those, and they
with others, are entangled apart; hence some more thick descend toward the
bottom, and others more light swim upon the top. When the Hypostasis does not
wholly sink down, but hangs all of it, either in the middle or upper Region,
that happens, because that those Filaments are not perfectly labored, nor
solid and compact, but more rare and spungy, or because the liquor is thicker,
and more impregnate with Salt and Sulphur, and therefore like Lie it sustains
some weights, which otherwise would sink to the bottom. Sometimes the
Hypostasis is wholly wanting, in sound people, after long fasting, immoderate
labors, or copious sweating, the matter being wholly consumed into nutriment,
or evaporated by sweat; in Feavours, by reason of the very depraved condition
of the Blood; also in the Pica, Cachexie, and other Distempers of that kind, by
reason of the great Crudity.

Concerning the consistency of the Urine in sound people, there is not much
worthy consideration to be met with: It is wont to be of that sort, as midling
Beer is, being purified by a long Fermentation; or Lie a little boiled, viz.
the watery liquor of the Urine, ought to include in its Pores and passages, a
great many Particles of Salt, and Sulphur, most smally broken, and dissolved;
and besides a little of earth, divided very exceeding small, and dispersed
through the whole body of the Piss; if the consistence be thinner than it ought,
as it is in clear, or limpid Urines, and watery, it is a sign of indigestion and
crudity; that the Aliments are not fully overcome, and Concocted; but if the
Urine be thicker, and closer than it ought, it is a sign, that the body of the
liquor, is filled with preternatural Contents. But of these elsewhere, when we
shall speak of the Urines of the Sick.

Thus far of Urine, forasmuch as it is an Excrement, and sign of Concoction in
a sound body (truly performed in the Viscera and in the Vessels) the quantity
or bulk of which is to be determined by the potulent matter; the color Citron,
from the dissolved Salt and Sulphur, and boiled in the Serum; the Hypostasis or
Contents depend upon the Filaments, elaboured in the Blood, for the nourishment
of the solid parts; the consistency on the Salt and Sulphur, together with the
Particles of Earth, filling the Pores and passages of the serous liquor. It
next remains, that we treat of the Urines of sick people: in which also, the
Quantity, Color, Contents, Consistence, and some accidents besides, offer
themselves to consideration.

CHAP. IV. Of the Quantity and Color in Urines of sick People.
IN a Morbous provision of Bodies, or Sickly estate, the quantity of the Urine
does not exactly quadrate with the proportion of the liquid things taken; for
sometimes it wants of its due measure, and sometimes exceeds it. When the Urine
is much less than the drinkable things taken, the reason is, because the watery
Latex either stays somewhere in the Body, or is diverted by some other way of
Excretion, than by Urine: if it remains within; First, it is either heaped up
about the Viscera, and their Cavities, and so is stayed now in the Ventricle,
more than it ought to do, and induces by the distention of it, troubles, with
spitting; but more often, it is laid up in the hollowness of the Abdomen, and
sometimes of the Thorax and head, and there is wont to cause Hydropic Diseases.
Or, Secondly, the Serum stagnates in the Vessels, and so increases the bulk of
the Blood, and Nervous Liquor, and notably perverts its motion; whence
Catarrhs, Rheumatick distempers, and often Palsies and Convulsions are caused.
Or thirdly, this watery humor is fixed in the habit of the body, and so creates
a swelling up of the whole body, or of some parts. Or fourthly and lastly, it
is obstructed in the urinary passages, by the Stone, or thick matter, as it
were a dam opposing it; and causes in those parts pains and Convulsions, and a
fullness of the Serum in the whole body. When the serous water is other ways
bestowed, the Patients are for the most part prone to frequent and troublesome
Sweats, or almost to a continual Looseness.

The distempers therefore which the small quantity of the Urine is wont to
indicate, are sometimes the swelling up of some of the Viscera, and a heaping
up of water in them, sometimes Catarrhal distempers, sometimes evil
dispositions of the nervous stock: sometimes an Anasarca and watery Tumors; and
sometimes the stony disposition of the Reins and Bladder. And sometimes also
the diminution of the Urine is the effect and sign of some other preternatural
evacution, viz. an immoderate excretion of Sweat, Lask, or some other thing. To
describe here exactly all the subsistences of the serous Latex, either in the
body, or the causes of it other ways excreted, and the manner of doing it, were
to transfer hither almost the whole matter of Pathology; for many and diverse
are the occasions and circumstances, whereupon this Serum is heaped up in this
or that part, and subsisting in the body, diminishes the quantity of the Urine;
but for the most part the principal and most frequent cause of this consists
not so much in the fault of the Liver, Spleen, or Reins, as of the blood it
self: to wit, a copious and free making of Urine, as also its stay in the body,
and only made in little quantity, depend chiefly on the temper of the blood,
and either on its kindling, or fermentation in the heart: for if the blood be
strong in rightly exalted principles, ( viz. Spirit, Sulphur, and Salt) it
grows very hot in the Vessels, and so the frame of the liquor being loose
enough, it is duly kindled by the ferment of the heart; and almost
spiritualizes the whole, passes through all parts with heat and a rapid motion,
without stopping, and whatsoever is superfluous and volatile, evaporates out of
doors: and whilst the blood is ratified, and boiling with heat, passes through
the Reins, what is serous is easily separated, either by the strainer of the
Reins only, or (which is most likely) by a coagulation, and is as it were
precipitated from the remaining mass of the blood. The same thing almost
happens after this manner to the blood, as we may observe in Milk, viz. whilst
it is warmed, and grows hot, it most easily goes into parts, and its Serum is
most easily separated by the least drop of Runnet, or Coagulum put into it: but
if you pour much more strong and sour ferment into it, when it is cold, a
precipitation will hardly follow; so if the blood becomes through an evil
constitution, or ill manner of living, more cool and watery, that being less
endued with active Elements, it grows but dully hot, and is but little kindled
in the heart; it is circulated very slowly and difficultly in the Vessels;
passing through the Pores and passages of the Viscera, it cleaves a little to
them, and leaves something behind it; whence are begotten every where
Obstructions and Tumors; also the blood by this means becoming viscous and
cool, and so unfit for precipitation or percolation, lays aside less readily
its excrements in the Reins; but leaves them every where in the body, because
it hardly, and not without the residence of a certain humor, is circulated.
Wherefore in this state, those things that move the blood very much, as
exercise and a more quick motion; or also such as may fuse it, as it were with
a Coagulum or Runnet, as are sharp things, and preparations of Salts, will more
freely provoke Urine.

It sometimes happens, that the Urines of the sick are made in a large
quantity, and very profuse, that in a day and a nights space, they make perhaps
twice or thrice as much water, as the Liquids they have taken; the causes of
which distemper are also various, and the significations very diverse; if after
the suppression of Urine, or its quantity formerly lessened, if in Hydropick
distempers, Rheumatisms, or passions of the nervous stock, or in the Crises of
Fevers, a flowing down of the Urine follows, either of its own accord, or by
the use of Diuretics, it denotes a Cure of the disease, or preternatural
disposition, or at least a declining of it. But if (as I have often observed)
in a lean and weak constitution (without any of the previous distempers but now
recited) the Urine exceeds much the Liquids taken, and from thence a great
debility of the whole follows; this indeed signifies an evil disposition, with
a tendency to a wasting or Consumption. I have known some women of a tender and
most fine make, who sometimes being ill, for many days, were wont daily to make
water in a great abundance, (exceeding twice the Liquids taken) and that watery
and thin, without contents or settlement; at which time they have complained of
a languishing of strength, difficult respiration, and an impotency to motion. I
suppose in this case, that the blood and nervous juice grow too sour, from the
salt carried forth, and suffering a Flux, and therefore that they are somewhat
loosned in their mixture, and fused so much into serosity, as to be made fit
for it. For it is to be observed, that all Liquids, though more thick and
mucilaginous, if they be kept to a sourness, presently become for the most part
watery and limpid: also the flowing down of the Urine is sometimes seen to arise
from such a disposition of the blood and humors: for that the Urine so
copiously excreted, is like Vinegar in taste; and these kind of distempers are
usually cured, chiefly by Chalybeates, and not by binding and thickning things.

But as to what respects the Color, the Urine of sound people may be the
square or rule, to which all the rest of the sick may be referred; for as the
color of sound peoples is Citron, the Urine of the sick is paler than Citron,
and so either watery, or white, or higher colored than it; whose chief kinds
are, flame-colour, yellow, red, green, and black. I shall run through every one
of these briefly, and endeavor to weigh them together, by what causes all the
alterations may be made, and what distempers, or provisions of diseases they
are wont to make known.

The Urine is watery or limpid, when by reason of the indigestion of the
Ventricle, the saline and sulphurous particles of things eaten, are not
rightly subjugated, nor being smally broken, are made so volatile, that being
dissolved in the Serum, they may impart to it a tincture, which it may carry
with it, through the several turnings and windings of its passage: For the
Latex or juice to be changed into Urine, because it is forced through very
secret passages, and narrow, as it were by a certain distillation; therefore it
is wholly deprived of the color and consistency, which it had from the taken
Liquids, and imbibes almost nothing, but the volatile part, from the Chyme,
whose Vehicle it is. Wherefore, if by reason of the great crudity, the Salt,
Sulphur, and other contents are not first made volatile in the Viscera, nor
afterward dissolved in the Vessels, that they may make their passage together
with the serous juice; it being at last stripped almost of all, is sent out
like clear water. That such Urines do want the active principles, it is a sign,
because they are kept a long time from putrefaction: This sort of Urine denotes
in Virgins, for the most part, the Green Sickness, in most the Cachexy or
Dropsy; in all it is a note of indigestion and crudity. Sometimes in those
obnoxious to the Stone, it foretells the approach of the fit, viz. whilst the
Serum is coagulated by the stony juice in the Reins, its dissolutions and
contents are congealed into a tartareous matter, only a watery juice or Latex
staying behind. Those who for some time make a thin and watery Urine, whatever
sickness they are obnoxious to, have often adjoined to it a difficulty of
breathing, and shortness thereof after motion, and a distention about the
region of the Ventricle, and as it were a swelling up after eating. The reason
of the former wholly depends on the defect of spirits in the blood, because its
liquor is not fully imbued with active principles (of Spirit, Sulphur, and
Salt) rightly exalted; therefore it is not sufficiently kindled by the ferment
of the heart, whereby the whole may presently leap forth, and break as it were
into a flame: but that hardly fermenting, and being apt to stagnate in the
heart, and for the most part to reside there, burdens it grievously: wherefore
if the blood so disposed, is urged more than it is wont, by a more quick
motion, into the bosom of the Heart, because not being rarefied of its own
accord, it may presently go wholly forth, therefore there is need of great
endeavor of the Lungs, and a more quick or frequent agitation, whereby it may
be carried forth. Therefore watery Urines signify this kind of Crudity in the
blood; because, for as much as they receive no tincture almost from the Salt
and Sulphur, it is a sign that the Particles are little dissolved in the mass
of blood, or are rendered volatile. As to what appertains to the inflation of
the Ventricle (of which also limpid or clear Urines are the effect and sign) I
say, because of a defect of due Fermentation, the Chyle goes not into a
volatile Cream, but (like bread not fermented) into a sad and heavy mass; which
indeed is slowly, and not without a residence of viscous Phlegm, carried out of
the stomach: its relics being impacted in the folds and Membranes of the
Ventricle, obstruct all the Pores and passages, that nothing may vapor forth,
nor that the thin and spirituous part may be conveyed (as it ought to be) by
the secret passages, to the blood: hence flatulencies are begotten, which
continually distend the Ventricle, and blow it up beyond its due bulk: also
when those Feculencies are left a long time in the stomach, they abound in a
fixed Salt, and degenerate now into an acid, now into a vitriolick matter, or
of some other nature; from whence Heart-aches, desire of absurd things,
oftentimes Heat with cruel thirst, and sometimes Vomiting arise: some of which
though they argue a very sharp heat to lie hid within, yet by reason of the
want of concoction, such distempers often render the Urine crude and watery. We
have treated thus largely of a limpid or clear Urine, because from hence the
reasons of the rest (which as to color and consistency are pale and thin in
healthful persons) may be drawn. For from the Salt and Sulphur, more or less
dissolved and boiled in the Serum, the appearances of a pale and straw-coloured
Urine, and of other colors, under a Citron color, are excited; and by the
like means, which was said of the watery, they may be unfolded.

There remains another certain kind of Urine, more pale than the Citron color,
not thin, but thick and cloudy, and of a whitish color; it appears by common
observation, that children do often make such water, when they are troubled
with the Worms: The reason of which seems, because the matter whereof the worms
are made, is a certain viscous Phlegm, heaped up in the Viscera, by reason of
the indigestion of the Chyle, and a defect of making or generating Spirits,
which matter at first transmits no tincture to the Urine, because of its
fixity, the same afterward putrefying is exalted, and is in some manner
volatilized; and then partly by heat and spirit, is formed into worms, and
partly being confused with the passing Chyle, and carried into the vessels,
when it is made unfit for nourishment, it is separated with the Serum from the
blood, and being mixed with the Urine, gives it that white color. Sometimes
also in Fevers, especially of children, the Urine is whitish: the reason of
which is, because the supplement of the nutritious juice being poured from the
Chyle to the mass of blood, is not rightly assimilated, but degenerates into an
excrementitious humor: A portion of which being incocted in the Serum, imparts
to it the thick consistence and milky color: otherwise than in the Fevers of
those of riper years, where when the heat is stronger, the same degenerate
juice impresses on the Serum a red color. Also the Urine is whitish in the
flowing of the Whites, the Gonorrhoea, Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder, and of
the urinary passages, by reason of the confusion or mingling of the filthy
matter, or the corrupted seed: however it be, that the color of the urine be
white, it is produced from its contents, which at last putting down its
settlement to the bottom, the liquor for the most part becomes of a palish and
yellowish color; even as it may be perceived by the making of the Milk of
Sulphur, where the milky substance sinking down to the bottom, the over
swimming liquor is of a Citron color.

Urines whose color is deeper than Citron, owe their appearance, not only to
the Salt and Sulphur dissolved more than usual, but in some sort to the more
thick contents in the liquor. The more plentiful dissolution of the Salt and
the Sulphur, is chiefly performed in the vessels, in the mass it self of the
blood, and from thence the Tincture is impressed on the serous Juice: But this
happens to be done for the most part, after a double manner, viz. either by
reason of the feverish fervor, for as much as the blood boiling in the
vessels, and being more kindled in the Heart, is very much loosned in its
mixture, and so copiously fixes on the Serum the particles of Salt and Sulphur,
wasted as it were by the boiling: Or without a Fever, when these kind of
sulphurous and saline little bodies, wont to be sent forth at other sinks, are
restrained; and so being by degrees heaped up in the blood, are poured into the
Serum. Of this also there are two chief causes or means; for either the
excrements of the blood, which chiefly participate of adust Sulphur, and that
ought to be sent away by Choler-carrying vessels, are retained, and so they
impress, being suffused on the serous humor, a tincture of yellowness: or else
the Effluvia's, which are chiefly of a saline nature, and ought to be
evaporated by insensible transpiration, are restrained, and from those the
urine is filled with a lixivial tincture. The urines of the former kind are
proper to people that have the Jaundice; but those of this latter are familiar
to the Scurvy: for in the Scurvy the saline particles of the blood depart from
volatilization, and get a Flux: wherefore, by reason of their fixity, they will
not evaporate, and so being more fully heaped together in the blood, they more
and more pervert its Crasis, and very much impregnate the serous humor with a
saltness. The contents which heighten the color of the urine, are of a twofold
kind, to wit, either adust recrements, remaining after the deflagration of the
blood, or particles of the nutritious juice, degenerated into an extraneous
matter: Concerning which we shall speak hereafter in their proper place. It now
remains that we describe particularly the several Colors of Urine more intense
or deep than Citron color.

1. The first is a flame-coloured urine, which shines with a brightness like
the Spirit of Nitre: and this is very often seen in an intermitting Tertian
Fever; this color arises from a portion of the thinner yellow Bile, mixed
with the Serum, whilst it is in motion: for that in this Fever there is a
sharp and hot intemperature of the blood, which burns and scorches all the
humors, and so plentifully begets Choler. But although this, for the most part,
is separated from the mass of blood by the bilary vessels and passages; yet
when it abounds in the vessels, a part of it, or (which is the same thing) some
burnt and adust particles of the blood and humors being boiled in the serous
water, impart to it an high or deep yellowness. This urine is thin and shining,
for that there is in this disease almost a continual breathing forth, that
thrusts out the recrements of the nutritious Juice, and all the thicker parts
of the Serum toward the circumference of the body.

2. The Saffron-coloured urine, and which dies Linen with the same color,
undoubtedly is a sign of the Jaundice: it is tinged after this manner by the
yellow Bile or Choler, or by the Salt and Sulphur burnt and plentifully mixed
with the Serum: for the yellow Bile is necessarily begot from the yoked heat
and motion of the blood; but for this the Gall bag is designed by Nature, for
the separating it from the mass of the blood, its passages being rooted in the
Liver: But if such a separation be any ways hindered, that humor flowing back in
the blood, and copiously heaped together, infects the skin with its yellowness,
the blood, and especially the serous Latex. The Saffron-coloured urine differs
from the flame-coloured, because in this only a certain portion of the more
thin Bile is poured into the urine, but in that the more thick part, and much
more plenty: besides, in the yellow Bile the Sulphur, with the Salt, being
joined and long circulated, is fully dissolved by it, that it becomes like
paint, imparting to every subject a Saffron-coloured tincture; as when common
Sulphur and Oil of Tartar are mixed together. But what things cause a redness
in urines, without the restagnation of this Bile, happen after the same manner,
as in the Lie of Ashes: where the particles of the Sulphur, without any
previous disposition from the saline, are forthwith put down with them in the
Liquor.

3. It remains that we speak next of red Urines, which are of a diverse habit,
neither do they always depend on the same causes, nor plainly denote the same
kind of distempers; we shall briefly run through the chief differences and
proper significations of them. First, the liquor of the urine is either red of
it self, and remains after the same manner, nor is the color altered by the
settling or sinking down of any of the parts: or secondly, the redness of the
urine chiefly owes its color to the Contents, which being settled to the
bottom, the liquor grows yellow, or is less red. The distempers that these kind
of urines are wont to show, are chiefly Fevers, and a confirmed Scurvy, and
Consumption. We shall consider the reasons of each.

1. When the Urine that is made red so remains, it is first either of a mean
consistency, and somewhat clear, and then it owes its color to the Salt and
Sulphur, being burnt more than usual, and so boiled more copiously in the
Serum: or secondly, such an urine is red, and also troubled and cloudy: but
this, besides the contents of Salt and Sulphur, has boiled in it some earthy
particles also, which indeed being impacted in the Pores and passages of the
serous Latex, do not descend: because the liquor of the urine is destitute of
convenient spirits, which may segregate all heterogeneous things, and drive
them to the bottom, as is wont to happen usually in dead drink, or Beer growing
sour by reason of Thunder; where the liquor is infected with a troubled Feces,
and by reason of the defect of spirits, will not grow clear; wherefore this
kind of urine is a very bad sign in Fevers, because it shows such a confusion
in the blood of adust and to be separated matter, such as the vital spirits are
not able to master by taming and subjugating it.

2. Sometimes the Urine is made red, by reason of its contents; which settling
in the bottom, the liquor becomes of another color: but these contents, as
before we hinted, are twofold, viz. now thin, which are the remaining matter,
or adust recrements after the burning forth of the blood; now more thick, to
wit, the degenerate particles of the nutritious Juice; both these being
torrified, and separated from the burning blood, are partly thrust forth by
Sweat, and partly mixed with the serous Latex, thicken its consistence, and
heighten its color, viz. so long as these kind of contents are included in the
Pores and passages of the liquor, they are sustained, the color of the urine
appears more deep, and the consistency thicker: but these being precipitated to
the bottom, both the redness and thickness of the liquor are lessened. The
reason of this shall be given anon, where we shall speak of the Causes of the
Colors, and also of the Clearness and Cloudiness of Urines: we shall now
inquire, what is the reason of the difference, that red urines are wont to be
made both in Fevers, and also in the Scurvy, Consumption, and perhaps in
several other distempers.

1. In Fevers, the liquor of the Urine is filled with redness, because of the
more plentiful dissolution of the Salt and Sulphur, and their particles
copiously boiled in the Serum; for whilst the blood and humors grow hot, from
the feverish cause, by reason of the heat being more fully inkindled, the
saline and sulphurous little bodies, being burnt and torrified, are more
dissolved; and being boiled in the serous Juice, impart to it a deeper
tincture: Even as if the Lie of Ashes be boiled over the fire, it grows more
red, than if it were only made by infusion. Also in Fevers, the contents of
the urine most often increase its color, viz. by reason of the intemperance
and deflagration of the blood, both the degenerate particles of the nourishing
Juice, and also other matter (as it were the Ashes remaining of the burning of
the blood) are burnt together, as it were into a reddish Calx; which being
included in the Pores of the urine, renders its color deep, and afterward
sinking down, makes a sediment like red Oker.

2. In a long Scurvy, the liquor of the Urine grows sometimes so highly red,
that it cannot be greater in a burning Fever: if such urine be evaporated, or
exposed to distillation, it will show great plenty of Salt, with a muddy Feces
or dregs: wherefore it seems to be manifest, that this deep redness does
chiefly arise from the Salt, (as we have already hinted) by this Experiment;
because in Scorbutic people the saline particles, which ought to be made
volatile, and so constantly exhaled by transpiration, become fixed, and being
hindered from a flux, are heaped together more plentifully in the distempered
body. The Salt remaining within, is variously coagulated with Sulphur and
Earth, and then is continually dissolved: and from this diverse coagulation and
dissolution, the to be admired Symptoms of this Disease are caused. Also from
the saline little bodies plentifully dissolved with Tartarous feculencies, and
diluted with the Serum, urines are filled with an high redness; to which most
often happen in this inveterate disease vices of the Liver and Gall; for when
these Inwards, being either obstructed or other ways depraved, cannot perform
their tasks, for the separating the adust particles of the blood, they being
more fully heaped up in the blood, are dissolved in the serous Juice, and
infect it yet with a more lixivial tincture. And if the adust particles of the
Sulphur do excel the rest of the fixed and scorbutic Salt, the yellow Jaundice
happens together with the Scurvy, and the urine fixes to Linen a Saffrony
tincture. But if they be less than they, and that the saline particles excel,
the Scorbutic distemper only is produced, in which the urine is intensly red,
yet does not dye the Linen. I am persuaded that it is thus; because, when I
have opened the dead carcasses of many dead of the Scurvy, in whom there was a
red urine, I observed that the Liver or Gall was in fault: In some the Liver
was wholly without blood, and dry like a Cows Udder; in others the bag of the
Gall was empty, and nothing in it; in others it was beset with little stones;
in others it was filled with filth, not bitter; in all these Inwards were so
distempered, that the secretion of the Bile was hindered.

3. By reason of this kind of dissolution of the Salt, Urines sometimes grow
red in Arthritick diseases: for besides the Gout (in which such urine is often
made) I have observed in some a painful distemper, and as it were like a
Fever, caused, with a very high-colored urine; they had wandering pains, now
in this place, now in that, grievously tormenting, that the sick were scarce
able to stand, or to stir their limbs: they were obnoxious to wakings and
frequent sweats; they were also troubled much with thirst, and heat of their
mouth: and they had a urine highly red, with a plentiful red sediment. In the
mean time it did not appear, either by the Pulse, languishing of the Spirits,
or Headaches, that the blood grew excessively hot, or that they had a Fever.
Wherefore I suppose that this kind of distemper does chiefly consist in the
nervous stock, and depends on the exorbitances of the saline Principle, rather
than the sulphurous.

4. Also in the confirmed Phthisis or Consumption, especially if an Hectic
Fever be joined with it, there is a red Urine; the reason of which is, if at
any time an Ulcer is excited in the Lungs, the putrid filth from thence being
mingled with the blood sliding by, causes in it almost a continual
effervescency, whereby the sulphurous and saline particles being more
plentifully dissolved and boiled in the Serum, affect its liquor with redness:
besides, by reason of the blood being defiled after this manner, the nourishing
Juice degenerates almost wholly into putrefaction, by whose recrements the
urine being filled, grows more red, and is very much stuffed with contents: The
sign or note of this is, that the sick for the most part grow hot after eating,
and that they are troubled with an heat through their whole body, followed with
a nightly sweat; besides, their urines yield a thick and copious sediment, to
wit, when the nourishing Juice, being mixed with the blood, is not assimilated,
it stirs up in it a fervor, and being degenerate into an extraneous matter,
exhales partly by sweat through the Pores of the skin, and partly being
transmitted to the urine, very much heightens its color and consistency.

Thus far of a red Urine, whose several species, but now related, have more
degrees of intention and remission, accordingly as the causes, altering the
color and consistence in them, are either weaker or stronger.

4. As to what belongs to a green and black Urine, I confess I have never seen
those kind of deep colors (exactly like those of Leeks and Ink) in any urine:
but I imagine I may have seen the appearance of a greenish color from a more
deep yellow, and of a blackish urine from the same with a cloudy and somewhat a
dark mixture, and from thence called by Authors a green and black Urine. But
those urines, colored after that manner, are esteemed either signs of the
Jaundice, or of being distempered with some virulency of the blood, if they
continue so constantly for some time: or such urines, as occasion offers, are
variously changed, and are now of this or that, and presently of another
color. So I have known Hypochondriacks wont to make such urines, as it were
critically for some time, and then afterward to render them like sound men. As
to the first, when the Jaundice is very great upon them, that the adust
portions of Sulphur and Salt remain a long time in the mass of blood, they
acquire by a long incoction a fullness of the yellow color, at first green, and
afterward black, and impart the same to the Serum: For if the yellow Bile,
being taken out of the bag of the Gall, and put into a Cucurbit, be exposed to
the gentle heat of a Bath, the same in a short time will grow green, and
afterward appear like the blackest Ink: wherefore in the black Jaundice, which
is only the yellow carried forth into a worse state, by its long stay or
continuance, there is nothing more usual than to make black urines. Besides,
these kind of urines sometimes appear in a malignant Fever, and in the Plague,
also often from drinking of poison, and in this case it is for the most part a
sign of death, because it argues the blood greatly corrupted, and the spirits
profligated, and the bond of the mixture loosned, as it were the deadly or
mortified distemper: even as where some part of our body, being distempered
with an Ulcer, is afterward taken with a Gangrene or mortification, forthwith
the flowing corrupt matter, which was at first white, waterish, or yellow,
becomes black. Wherefore in the forementioned distempers, when the urine grows
black, the Serum and the blood being wholly vitiated, the skin also is dyed
outwardly with such a color. As to what belongs to urines periodically
tinctured with a greenish color, and especially with black (which happen often
to Hypochondriacks) it is most likely, that such arise from the melancholic
Feculencies laid up in the Spleen, and from thence, by reason of its
congestion, too much flowing forth sometimes, and confused with the blood: for
such a matter, being often poured into the Ventricle in some men, stirs up
black Vomitings; also in others, the same being supped up from the blood
passing through, may impart suffusions of the same colors to the serous Juice.

So much for the Colors of Urines, of which the more pale arise from too much
Crudity, almost all the high-colored, either from the Salt and Sulphur
plentifully dissolved, and sometimes from the adust recrements thoroughly boiled
in the Serum, or from the more thick contents of the urine; whether they be the
Calx and remaining part of the aliment, degenerated in the concoction, or the
wasting or melting of the pining body, or some part of it evilly distempered:
what has been said may be better understood, if the means, whereby these kind
of dissolved things or contents are able variously to change the color of the
urine, be unfolded.

The causes of the diversity of appearances of colors, and their variously
changing, as also of the cloudiness and clearness in Urines, (as in all other
Liquors) depend only on the various incidency and emersion of the beams of
light, as is hinted in another place, in the Tract of Fermentation: For if the
substance of the liquor be rare and thin, with open Pores and passages, that
the beams of light may easily pass through, it is shining and clear like
fountain water: but if the Pores of the liquor be filled with contents, or
little bodies swimming in it, so that the luminous beams are broken in their
passage, but so that at length they may show themselves, according to those
various manners of refraction and emission, there will appear a Citron, a
Saffron, or red color in a yet clear liquor. If that, in the little spaces of
the Pores yet more obstructed, the light cannot pass through, there is a
darkness induced: but then if the immersed beams be a little or nothing
reflected, the liquor will appear of a brown or dark color; but if they are
beaten back, according to the diverse manner of reflection, a white, ashy, or
some other kind of appearance, is induced. From this being supposed, according
as the liquor of the urine, sometimes almost wholly deprived of Salt and
Sulphur, and other things dissolved, easily admits of light, sometimes either
very much stuffed, or else moderately with these kind of contents, either
distorts the beams falling on them in their passage, or wholly imbibes them, or
lastly beats them back; it were easy to explicate all the Phenomena or
appearances of colors and their consistence.

It often happens, that the color of the same Urine is variously changed: for
what is made red, being exposed to the air, becomes white, or of a dark color,
and then after a long time of a Citron color: the reason of which is this, if
I am not deceived, this kind of urine, when it is made, is red, because the
Pores of the Liquor are very full of contents; yet so long as they are dilated
with heat, they transmit the rays of light, (although variously distorted) that
they may at length show themselves or appear; but this urine is no sooner
exposed to the cold, but that the Pores being straightened, the site and position
of the parts is changed in the contents, and by that means the passage of the
beams of light is hindered: wherefore the liquor presently becomes cloudy, and
according as those beams are reflected after this or that manner, a white, or
brown, or some other kind of color is induced: but at length the contents
falling down toward the bottom with their weight, the Pores being freed,
transmit again the rays of light, and do not distort them; wherefore a clear or
a Citron color appears.

From these things which have been spoken concerning the Colors of Urines, may
appear what is the cause of the various consistence of urines. For as the
particles of Salt and Sulphur, of the adust matter, or nutritious Juice,
depraved in the assimilating, are more or less boiled in the Serum, urines also
get their more thin or thick consistency. It remains next that we speak more
clearly of the Contents in preternatural Urines, whereof we have often made
mention.

CHAP. V. Of the Contents in the Urines of sick People.
WE suppose the Contents in the Urines of sick people to be twofold, viz.
either universal, which proceed from the mass of Blood, and of the nervous
Liquor, and respect the habit of the whole Body; or particular, which are the
layings aside or excrements of one bowel, or part ill affected, of which we
shall speak anon. Those of the former kind, which come away from the whole, are
either natural, viz. Filaments or small threads constituting the Hypostasis or
settlement, as in sound Urines; or preternatural, which chiefly are particles
of the nutritious humor degenerate from assimilation, and constitute the more
thick bodies of the sediment in Urines; and lastly to these, (if there be a
feverish intemperance) the adust matter of the blood after deflagration, and
diluted in the serous Juice, is added, and increases the bulk of the Contents.

But these Contents, both natural and preternatural, of Urines, represent
themselves after a various manner, as the blood more or less unduly grows hot,
also as the aliments in the bowels and vessels are variously concocted, and
either the superfluities or corruptions of the Chyme, from thence made, are
washed away with the Serum: for if the nourishable humor transmitted to the
blood, is not all perverted, but a great portion of it, laid upon the solid
parts, is changed into nourishment, some parts of this also rightly made, being
mixed with the Serum, impress yet some marks of an Hypostasis in urines: Also
from the adust or degenerate matter, a preternatural sediment is framed, yet
little and thin, neither does it wholly blot out the appearances of this
natural. Wherefore in the beginning and declination of a Fever, sometimes also
in a Consumption, or a Cachexy an Hypostasis, though not so perfect, is
perceived. If that the greater portion of the same Chyme, growing hot with the
blood, by reason of the immoderate heat, is perverted into an heterogene
matter, which afterward is sent away with the Serum, as hurtful and
unprofitable, presently an obscure and imperfect Hypostasis appears; and
besides it, very many contents are seen in the urines, which heighten their
color and consistency. Such an urine, which contains an Hypostasis, though
imperfect, together with other things of the same kind dissolved in it, if it
be kept in a warm place, the Hypostasis will be perceived alone; but the rest
of the contents, comprehended in the pores of the urine, dilated by the heat,
are made wholly inconspicuous or not to be seen: yet afterward the little
spaces of the Pores being straightened by cold, the same contents are
precipitated, and by that means they render the site and position changed, and
the urine troubled and cloudy, and blot out the appearance of the Hypostasis.
These kind of urines in the better state of Fevers, in a Catarrh, Cough,
difficulty of perspiration, fullness of humors, and in the more light
Dyscrasies are wont to be made.

But if in the more grievous state of sickness the Concoction be wholly
vitiated, and the whole nutritious Juice changed into a putrefaction, these
kind of contents also may be perceived in the urine without an Hypostasis, and
signifies variously in diseases, after their various ways of being
precipitated, and sinking down, and constituting a diverse kind of sediment; to
wit, as the separation of the parts succeed soon or late, or not at all; and as
the matter falling down shall be little or much, or also of a white, red, or
dark color. I will briefly run through what is most notable and worthy
observation concerning this thing.

1. This kind of Urine being full of contents, is not sometimes at all
precipitated, (unless the substance of the liquor be dissolved by putrefaction
a long time after) but remains a long while troubled and somewhat cloudy, with
little bodies swimming through the whole. The reason of this is, either because
these contents are too much incocted in the Serum, so that the spirits
implanted therein, cannot separate the pure from the impure, the thick from the
thin; as may be perceived in brewing Beer, if that the Malt be too much
boiled, the liquor shall never grow clear: or else the urine remains troubled,
because it is wholly destitute of spirits, which may compel the parts of the
liquor into the motion of Fermentation; as it usually comes to pass in Beer
growing sour by reason of Thunder, or of immoderate heat, and being infected
with a troubled Feces or Lee, will scarce ever be rightly made clear again.
This kind of urine is perceived for the most part in very dangerous Fevers,
and sometimes in a desperate Cachexy, and always portends evil.

2. Sometimes it happens, that the Urine is so full of contents, that it begins
to be troubled whilst it is yet warm. I have often observed it, after this
manner, in a slow Fever, whose heat was gentle and more remiss, to wit, in
which the particles of the nutritious crassament or substance are depraved, but
being a little subdued by heat, or boiled in the Serum, they easily fall out of
its pores: as when common Sulphur is boiled in Lie, if that before it be
perfectly dissolved, it be taken from the fire, the liquor at first clear and
red, by reason of the quick precipitation of the dissolved matter, becomes
presently troubled, dark, and of a somewhat whitish color.

3. But what most usually comes to pass, that this sort of Urine, big with
contents, as long as it is hot, and some time after, seems clear and
perspicuous when it grows cold, is wont to be troubled, and as if some Runnet
were infused to be precipitated according to all its parts; yet the same, if
held near the fire, or in warm water for a little space, shall grow clear
again. The reason of this is already fully unfolded, where we spoke of the
Causes of Cloudiness and of Clearness.

4. After that the Urine being exposed to the cold, is precipitated in this
manner, it may be observed by what means its contents descend to the bottom;
for sometimes they settle in a short time: and if the liquor grows clear in the
space of two or three hours, it is a sign that the liquor of the urine is not
too thick, nor very much filled with Salt and Sulphur: wherefore in the
beginning or declination of Fevers, when the heat is slack, such an urine is
most often made: sometimes such a settlement follows not but in the space of
many days; the reason of which is, because the consistence of the liquor is
thicker than it should be, therefore the contents or dissolved things are not
so easily let go from its embrace, that they may fall down to the bottom by
their weight. These kind of urines are wont to be made in the state or height
of Fevers, and most often precede an evil Crisis.

5. Of no less a diverse kind are the sediments which fall to the bottom. That
I may pass over in this place the filthy matter, and blood, sand, gravel, and
the like, deposited from some parts, I shall mention those which are the
products of the whole body, and they for the most part are either white or
brown, or red like Oker: If you strain urine, when it has stood long, through
brown paper, you may collect these contents. I have often seen a whiteness like
Chalk, and sometimes red like Bole Armene, without doubt there is the same
matter of all, to wit, the recrements of the deflagrated blood, and of the
nutritious juice depraved in the assimilating: which, as they are burnt by heat
in our body, and diversely perverted, appear also in the urine under a various
color and form; even as Antimony mixed with Nitre, as it is more or less
calcined exhibits a Calx, now red, now Saffron-colour, now yellow, now brown:
The like reason is (as it seems) of the sediments of urines, which are as it
were the Calx of the sulphurous and earthy matter burnt forth by the fire of
the Fever in the Viscera and Vessels.

6. Besides these kinds of Contents, which happen in the Urines of sick people,
I have often observed, that after the urine had stood a long while, something
was affixed to the sides of the glass like sand, and indeed in diverse figures;
for now these little bodies like sand grow together with a sharp and unequal
superficies, now with ridges like the Crystals of Nitre, and some shine and are
pellucid like Ice. I have seen these kind of Crystals fixed to the Urinal,
sometimes in the urines of those troubled with a Dysentery, also in those
troubled with pertinacious wakings. Sometimes in urines, when they have stood
long, a certain Cream will swim on the top, as when Tartar is boiled in water:
this kind of whitish crust growing together in the superficies of the urine, is
commonly thought to be fat and fattish things, and taken for the melting of the
solid parts: wherefore such as are wont to make such an urine, are presently
pronounced to be consumptive, and in a desperate condition: But indeed that is
only a saline concretion, which if put into the fire, will not melt, but grows
hard into a crusty substance. Yea both this and the other concrescences of
urines are as it were the Tartar brought forth in them by a certain
Coagulation: But such a concretion depends altogether on the particles of the
fluid or acetous Salt, combined with others of the fixed or Alcalisate Salt:
For in every subject where there is a commixtion of the Salts of either kind,
Crystallizations and Coagulations of a diverse manner are caused, either
spontaneously by Nature, or may be procured by artificial separation: wherefore
this kind of urine, on which this Cream swims, or that Crystals gather in the
sides of the Vessels, indicates the blood to be departed from its sweet and
Balsamic nature (such as depends on the volatile Salt) into an acid and
corrosive, by reason of the flux and fixity of the saline Principle. Such an
urine, if it be evaporated, leaves in the bottom of the Vessel great plenty of
Salt: the distempers wherein it is usually found (as I have often observed) are
spitting of blood, Atrophy, or general wasting, and the Hypochondriack
disposition.

In the Urines of sick people it is worth observation, whether they dye the
Urinal or not? For sometimes in Fevers the urine is no sooner put into the
Glass, but presently it darkens its sides with a whitish cloud, and again at
another time this does not happen: I suppose that the Glass is dyed, when the
liquor of the urine is fuller of dissolved Sulphur than its pores can contain
within themselves; as may be perceived in Lie, wherein common Sulphur or
Antimony is boiled: Also every urine, if it stand in the Glass till it
putrify, will infect its sides with a crust or cloud, sometimes whitish,
sometimes reddish, sometimes of another color: for the frame of the liquor
being loosned by putrefaction, the particles of the Sulphur being loosned from
the bond of mixture stick to the Glass: But in the urines of sick people
sometimes this presently follows, because the Sulphur is more copiously
dissolved than can be included in its pores.

As to what respects the particular Contents of Urines, they indeed are
manifold, and may come from many parts and places: yet they most often depend
on diseases implanted about the Reins, Bladder, and Urinary passages: sometimes
it happens by reason of an Imposthume in the Liver, Spleen, Lungs, or other
Inward; or by reason of preternatural humors heaped up in those places, and
flowing out with their fullness, an extraneous matter is transmitted into the
mass of blood, and thence into the serous Juice: but this happens more rarely,
because an Imposthume being broken within, for the most part pours out its
matter into the cavities of the Viscera, from which there is no passage open
into the urinary passages: besides the mass of blood flowing with impurities,
does not presently endeavor to send them forth by urine, but oftener by sweat,
spitting, breaking out of Wheals, Tumors, or by other ways of excretion.
Wherefore it appears by common observation, that the other contents of urines
(than which we have above cited) are chiefly sent from the Reins and their
dependences; the chief of which are sand, stones, blood, matter, bits of flesh,
skins, branny or mealy sediments, which for the most part signify either the
stony or an ulcerous distemper, or both together, planted beyond the emulgent
Vessels.

It is an usual thing for some to void with their water, gravel or small find
of a red color in great quantity; some of these are obnoxious to the stone in
the Reins, and are frequently tormented with Nephritick fits: I have also known
others without pain, or other grievous Symptom, for a long time to make a sandy
water. All urines whatsoever, if they stand for some time in a leaded or earthy
glazed vessel, affix this kind of red land to the sides and bottom of the Pot,
to wit, the volatile Salt of the urine is coagulated with the fixed Salt of the
Metal: so when Sal Ammoniac being mixed with the filings of Steel, Sea Salt, or
Vitriol is sublimated, the elevated flours grow notably red: wherefore it seems
that these kind of little sands are begot in the Reins, for that the Salt of
the urine is coagulated with the Tartarous feculencies laid up about the
windings of the Reins, from whence the sandy matter is made, which is presently
washed away by the serous Juice passing through: Therefore the gravel that is
so frequently made are no small parts or fragments of a greater stone, (as is
commonly thought) but extemporary products of the blood and Serum washing the
winding passages of the Reins.

By what means little stones are produced in the Bladder or Reins, is not to be
fully discoursed in this place: But without doubt it is done rather by
Coagulation than Exsiccation or Excalefaction, by drying or heating. I have
observed some sick of the Stone in the Bladder, who after they have made water,
were wont to void with great striving and pain a thick and viscous Juice, which
presently hardened into a scaly matter: the smell of this was like Lie, and of
such a consistence as Lie evaporated to a thickness, the liquor of which being
made thick, presently stiffens into a saline hardness. Lesser stones sometimes
pass through the urinary passages, and are carried out: the greater remain
unmoved in their Cells. The places wherein they are usually begotten are the
narrow winding bosoms of the Reins, from thence the smaller slide into the
Bladder, and if not excerned, they grow into great stones. I once saw many
great stones shut up as it were in a Chest about the sides of the Bladder
between its Membranes; these without doubt being sent from the Reins while
smaller, remained in the passages of the Ureters, creeping between the Coats of
the Bladder, and there by degrees did increase in bulk. A Matron so distempered
long before her death, cast out of the urinary passage a Membrane thick and
broad, full of sandy matter, which (as appeared after her body was opened) was
part of the interior Tunick of the Bladder worn and broken by the stones there
included.

It is ordinary for Nephritick people, or such as are troubled with the Stone,
frequently to void blood or matter with their Urine: for from a greater stone,
and endued with sharpness, the flesh of the Reins is easily worn, and the
mouths of the Vessels opened, whereby blood flowing out tinges the urine; and
when a solution of unity is caused in this manner in the Reins, an Ulcer most
commonly follows, whereby matter and filthy stuff are poured out with the
serous water, and constitute a plentiful and stinking sediment in the urine:
then the sore being more enlarged by the Ulcer, more large profusions of blood
often follow, and the flesh it self of the Reins being worn away, and by
degrees eaten off, is voided with the urine. I visited once an ancient Woman,
who daily voided with her urine, for many months, pure blood in great quantity;
besides, as often as she made water, she used to void in great quantity pieces
of flesh, great gobbets, as it were the little Tubes of the Vessels eaten away,
that it was suspected one of her Kidneys was all thus cut away from her body:
yet afterward by a vulnerary Decoction acidulated with Spirit of Vitriol, that
bloody water was staid, and this Woman lives still well and in health. I knew
another Matron, who used for a long time in making water to void at first blood
with a purulent matter, and Membranes: then the bloody water ceasing, for many
years she made a waterish urine with a copious sediment, and white like snot,
sinking down to the bottom of the Urinal. Afterward when she began to want
that sediment, a feverish intemperance followed with pains wandering here and
there, with a languishing of strength, and other dangerous Symptoms: and when
this sick Woman was brought into danger of her life, a Tumor arising in her
left side about her Reins, and ripening into a Boil or Sore, by reason of the
large flowing out of the matter, freed her: but yet an hollow and sinuous Ulcer
pouring out a thin matter, remained in that place during her life: and being
sometimes healed up, would presently break out again. Scarce two years after
this Noble Lady having endured the suppression of her urine for fourteen days,
became apoplectick and dyed. Her body being opened, her left Kidney was quite
gone, in the place of it a membranous substance growing to the Loins, enfolding
the extremities of the Vessels and Ureter, was grown up: some prints or marks
of the Ureter remained, but without any opening into the hollowness of the
passage: yea a certain ichor or serosity dropping out from the little mouths of
the emulgent Artery, was carried outwardly into that sinuous Ulcer. The other
Kidney was very full of sandy matter and small stones; besides, near the top of
the Ureter a stone about the bigness of ones thumb was fixed, whose extremity
was so fitted and firmly impacted to the passage or cavity of the Ureter, that
it shut it up just like a Tap, and quite hindered the passage of the serous
Juice. The purulent matter comes into the urine, not only from the Reins, but
sometimes out of the Bladder and urinary passage distempered with an Ulcer; and
sometimes also a corrupt seed, or white flux, or menstruous blood are poured
into urines from the Vessels and genital parts, and produce in them
preternatural settlements.

4. In the Urines of sick people are often seen abundance of white Contents
composed of most small bodies; which, when they are settled, fill up above half
the liquor, and make it white and duskish, the rest remaining limpid, and thin
in the upper region of the Urinal: this kind of sediment is called Mealy,
because it is like water imbued with meal. Concerning this it is doubtful,
whether it proceeds from the whole mass of blood, or only from the urinary
Viscera. It appears by observation, that the same sort of urine is always made
in the stone of the Bladder, also sometimes by reason of the Kidney being
oppressed with some great stone. I never saw such a settlement in urines
without a Nephritick distemper; wherefore I have thought it almost indubitable
to be always a sign of the Stone: And it seems that it should wholly depend on
the juice or humor heaped up about the bulk or substance of the stone: For
where the stone is fixed in the Kidney or Bladder, the nutritious humor is
there perverted from assimilation, and degenerates into a more thick mucor,
which uses to be copiously heaped up; like Ichor, which by reason of a Pea put
into an Issue, runs out plentifully. But this mucor or filth being washed with
Serum, makes that white sediment.

CHAP. VI. Of Judgments to be given concerning the Urines of sick People.
SO much for the Anatomy of Urines, wherein are unfolded their Elements and
constitutive Principles, together with their chief Accidents, viz. Color,
Consistence, and Contents, both what ought naturally to be in them per
essentiam or essentially, and also what are wont to happen to them
preternaturally, by reason of the body being ill affected. It will be easy for
any one to accommodate this Hypothesis to practice, and to give Judgment on
Urines beholding them in the Urinal; for from what has been said it appears of
what parts the Diseases are made known by the inspection of the Urines, and
what the Urine signifies in each of them. Concerning this subject there has
been enough said by Authors; I shall therefore only touch upon it briefly, and
lightly pass it over.

Although the matter of Urine, viz. the Serum of the blood washes the whole
region of the Body, and is circulated with the blood through all the several
parts, yet it does not lay open the condition and diseases of them all, but
only of those to which it owes either the natural perfection and genesis of it
self, or from which it receives every alteration: wherefore in some respect it
shows the action and disposition of the Viscera serving to Concoction, and
besides denotes the temper and motion of the blood and humors in the Vessels:
but that any one should pretend to know from the Urinal, and to divine a pain
in the Head, an Imposthume in the Throat, or any other Disease of any part,
from whence nothing is communicated to the Serum, he shows rather his ignorance
than the knowledge of any Disease.

Urines brought from sick persons sometimes are wholly like those of sound
peoples, and then they give no light to the disease or distempered part; but it
may be lawful, having inspected them, to say something negatively, viz. that
the Patient is free from a Fever, that as to the Ventricle and Concoction of
the food, they are indifferently well: wherefore unless he be inclining to a
Consumption, or is sick of an Imposthume, or some other disease of the unity
being broken; whatsoever it be, the distemper seems not very dangerous or hard
to be cured.

But in the mean time I would not have him declare any thing rashly, nor
proceed farther than he can with safety return: for I have often observed in
some most grievous distempers, viz. in a malignant Fever, when with loss of
strength, a weak and unequal Pulse, eruption of Spots, and other dangerous
Symptoms, the Patients have been desperately sick, that the urines as to the
color, consistence, and Hypostasis, have been laudable, as in sound persons,
so that in such a case the Physician by only viewing the Urine, as to his
Prognostication had grievously erred: wherefore there is scarce credit to be
given to the single testimony of the Urine, unless there be other signs
agreeable; but that it is a liar in the Plague and malignant Fevers, and
deceives: the reason is, that in those diseases the blood is leisurely, and as
it were silently corrupted, sometimes without any great fervor: and so,
although its liquor be infected by Coagulation, or by mortification or
deadness; yet because it does not burn out much at the same time, so as to make
an heap of adust matter, as of Ashes, the Serum is little or nothing altered
from its usual disposition or tenor: Besides, sometimes when in such a
sickness the blood grows very hot, whatever of excrementitious is heaped up in
its mass, is presently transferred to the Brain and nervous stock: wherefore
the serous water being free from preternatural contents, remains after its
usual manner; besides this case, when the Urines appear of a deep color,
troubled, and without any sediment, there is no reason why the Piss-prophet
should make a Prognostication.

As often as the Urines of sick people are unlike those of sound, either
something natural is wanting, or what is preternatural is added, or it happens
both together.

1. There may be wanting Color, Consistence, Contents, and Quantity. If the
Color be more remiss than it should, and the Liquor paler, it indicates
Crudity, and a defect of making Spirits, to wit, that the nourishing Juice is
not rightly concocted or exalted either in the Viscera or in the Vessels; so
that the saline and sulphurous Particles being carried out together, following
the distribution as it were the distillation of the Serum, might thoroughly
stick to the same, and impart also to it the tincture: wherefore such Urine
being viewed from these kind of Symptoms, you may unfitly divine, that there is
a weight in the Ventricle, want of Appetite, evil Digestion, a tension in the
Hypochondria, an unfitness for motion, sleepiness, difficult breathing, and a
frequent palpitation of the Heart upon exercise, a pale color, a swelling of
the Feet and Belly, you may say they are in danger of falling (if not already
fallen) into a Cachexy or Dropsy, and if it be a Maid, that she is troubled
with Longings and the Green Sickness.

If the Color of Urines be remitted in a Fever without a Crisis, it is a sign
that the fermentative matter or adust recrements of the blood are separated
from the bosom of the blood, and fixed somewhere, which for the most part
happens in the Brain; and for that cause such Urines use to foretell a Delirium
or Frenzy; in those troubled with the Stone, a sudden alteration of the urine
into a pale and watery color, denotes the approach of a Fit.

A copious and pale Urine often shows the too great resolution or melting of
the Salts, by reason whereof the serosities are sent away as it were in a flood
from the whole body, and chiefly from the nervous parts: such an Excretion
sometimes is healthful, and as it were critical, when the superfluities happen
only to be carried away: sometimes it is symptomatick, and causes a great
debility, to wit, because the nutritious Juice and the good humors are purged
out.

If the Consistence be thin, and the Liquor pale, it argues Crudity, want of
Spirits, or too much Drinking, or the Nephritick distemper: if it be of a
flame-colour, it is a sign of an intermitting Tertian Fever.

If the Contents be wanting, and it be pale, want of Concoction is signified,
and a Cachectick distemper of the body. But if it be of a Citron color, and
the consistency mean, without Hypostasis, you may suppose the Patient to have
used too much labor or exercise; or to be frequently distempered with Sweats
in the night, or perhaps to have an Atrophy, or general wasting, or to be
inclining to a Consumption.

If the Urine be continually made in a lesser quantity than it should, unless
there be a larger transpiration, it is a sign that the blood is not
sufficiently purged from the serous Juice: wherefore there is a necessity that
it become more watery, and that at length a Cachectical disposition of the body,
or a Dropsy be brought in. But if it be suddenly suppressed, or made with pain
and difficulty, it is a sign of the Stone or Gravel.

2. Something is added to the Urine, to wit, when the color is heightened, and
in the mean time the consistency and contents show themselves in due measure,
there may then be a suspicion of a Feverish or Hectical distemper: perhaps
some evident cause may precede, as the use of Baths, Heat, Surfeit, or
immoderate Exercise, which might have heated the blood; or Cold may have
heedlesly been taken, whence may arise a shutting up of the Pores, and
difficulty of Perspiration. If the urine be of a Saffron-colour, and tinges the
Linen with yellowness, you may say it is the Jaundice: but if it be of a
Saffron color or red without a Fever, and does not dye Linen, it shows for
the most part the Scurvy or Hypochondriack disposition.

Though the Color and Hypostasis may be in good order, preternatural Contents
are often in the Urine; therefore when it grows cold it is troubled, and makes
a sediment sometimes white, and then there is a suspicion of the blood's
overflowing with filth, also of an impure Ventricle stuffed with
excrementitious matter, or with Worms; sometimes red, which often happens by
reason of Transpiration being hindered, a Consumption, and sometimes by reason
of a Surfeit, or the beginning of a Fever.

Preternatural and thicker Contents are sometimes in Urines, showing themselves
naturally, which denotes a distemper of some part about the urinary passages;
whence Matter, Filth, Blood, the Whites, corrupt Seed, or the like, are mixed
with the Urine: and you may easily know by asking how, and in what place the
Patient is ill, what part is distempered; and the straining the sediments of
those urines will show what the disease is, and you may be more sure of the
nature of the distemper.

When Urines have stood some time, copious white sediments are thence made; it
is not easy at first sight to know from whence they come, viz. whether from
the whole mass of blood, or only from a particular bowel employed for the
preparations of the Serum or the Seed. For the impurities of the blood and
nervous juice being deposited under a mealy species in the bottom of the
Urinal, are wont to cause a suspicion in the Physician of the Whites in Women,
and of the Running of the Reins in Men: such like contents are also seen in
Urines, which proceed from the urinary and spermatick parts. Amidst these
ambiguities, lest you should guess rashly and confidently by the urine, and
assert uncertain for certain things, and falsehood for truth, the difference of
these kind of urines ought to be indicated after this manner. If the contents
be universal, and their signs be to be applied to the mass of blood; for the
most part these presently after the making (unless sometimes by chance in a
Critical separation) are wholly inconspicuous (as in a thinner substance,) then
the urine being troubled by cold, they descend slowly to the bottom; and being
settled, and the Urinal heated, they disappear again. But if these white
settlements are sent from a particular nest, they presently disturb and thicken
the urine newly made, are soon precipitated, and vanish not by heat. But that
it may appear to what bowel these kind of particular contents should be
ascribed, it is easily made known to Learned men by other circumstances.

3. The Urine is sometimes wholly altered from the natural state; the color
and contents which should be therein are wanting, and strange things are in
their place; then indeed is indicated that there is an intemperance in the
whole body, and that the Concoction in the Bowels and Vessels is depraved; you
may say the Patient is sick of a Fever; and thence by asking, you may learn
and presently pronounce that he is distempered with the Headache, Thirst, Heat,
queasiness of Stomach, want of sleep, and by consequence with other Symptoms.

It happens sometimes, that the Urine declines from its natural state, yet not
to show the distemper the Patient complains of, but either the cause of the
disease, or the consent of some other part with the distempered; as if any one
should complain of a cruel Head ach, or trembling of the Heart, and make a
watery Urine, that does not denote those distempers, but only a crudity in the
Ventricle, and some obstructions about the Spleen and Viscera, which may be the
cause of those distempers: I say in this case, the urine being inspected, the
chief indications are taken about the Method of Curing, and we must not use
Cephalic or Cardiack Remedies, but either Catharticks, which cause Vomit or
Purging, or Openers, and especially Chalybeats: But the urine is sometimes
vitiated, and yet its signification is wholly a stranger to the distemper the
Patient complains of, as if any one were subject to the sleepy disease, or a
Lethargy, and makes it red and full of preternatural contents, its inspection
suggests chiefly coindications, viz. that we insist not on too hot, but
temperate Remedies.

The chief use of Inspection of Urines will be for the observing the state and
progress of every disease, as also the alterations toward health or death. For
in Chronical diseases, by daily inspecting the urine, is made known to the
Physician, by what degrees the sickness may increase day by day; at what time
purging or altering Remedies will be most fit, and what Medicines will be most
profitable: hence is to be observed, whether Nature prevails on the disease or
not; and a most certain Prognostication may be drawn from hence, either of the
hope or danger of health; to wit, according as the signs of Concoction or
Crudity appear in the Urines. In acute diseases, hence the state and height of
the Fever may be best known, at what time the Crises may be expected, and with
what success; when it is best to insist upon Evacuations, and when on Cordials.
The Compass is not beheld with more certainty and diligence by the Mariner or
Steers-man, than the appearances of Urines ought to be observed by the
Physician for fit times and ways of Curing.

These were what I had to had to say concerning the Judgments of Urine, not
collected from the vain Traditions of Quacks, but what are consonant to reason
and truth. Besides I know there are ordinarily delivered by Medicasters and Old
women almost an innumerable company of Rules and Directions of
Urine-divination, that the Urinal is no sooner inspected, but they will
undertake to divine, whether it be a man or a woman that is sick, how long they
have been sick, what their disease is, and whether the distemper shall end in
health or death; whether the Patient be subject to the passions of Love or
Sadness, whether a Woman has conceived with Child or not, or whether it shall
be a Boy or a Girl, and an hundred other the like; in which using a vain
conjecture, they either impose by their confidence on the minds of the
credulous, or (which is more frequently their custom) by a cunning craftiness
they other ways sift out the matter by inquiring, and falsely ascribe it to
their knowledge in the inspection of Urine.

CHAP. VII. Of the Examination and various ways of proving of Urines.
ALthough the business of the Examination and Inspection of Urines seems
commonly only a simple thing ( viz. the Medicasters and Quacks for the most
part behold the Urine sent in a Glass, shake it a little, and presently give
Judgment) yet to those who honestly endeavor the recovery of the sick, the
matter seems a little more intricate, and they use to observe several
circumstances concerning Judgment by Urine; which being omitted, nothing indeed
can be certainly or directly learnt in the Medicinal Practice from the Urinal.
Moreover, in some diseases, besides the mere inspection of the Glass, there are
other ways of trial to be had, by which, what lies hid in the Urines, and out
of sight, may be made clear: from whence some not unprofitably taking care of
the separation of Urine more accurately, have used to evaporate, distill,
putrify, and precipitate them. Wherefore we shall speak briefly of the right
manner of inspecting Urine, and in some cases of the Analysis or separation
variously to be instituted.

When the Urine of the Patient is offered to the Physician, if it has first
stood for some time in the Glass, and if the liquor be clear, the Hypostasis as
it were gathered into a little cloud, and if the rest of the contents sink down
to the bottom, there is nothing more wanting, but that forthwith a prognostic
sentence may be given. But if the Urine be newly poured into the Urinal, or be
troubled by a former shaking, you must stay till the confused parts be
separated, and the settlement have acquired its due place. If the Liquor be
full of contents, and the Pores straightened, it becomes troubled and dark, and
the Glass must be put in a warm place, till the urine grow clear again, and
then let it be placed for some time near the fire, that whilst the
preternatural of more thin contents are absorpt by the Pores dilated by the
heat, the more thick may fall down to the bottom, and the filaments or little
rags making the Hypostasis, (if there be any) may be gathered together below,
or in the middle region; for so will appear what is the power of Nature, and
what of the Disease: Also in Fevers, the degree of heat and effervescency, the
concoction or depravation of the nutritious Juice, also the congestion or
heaping together of the adust matter in the blood, and its separation begun, or
wholly frustrated, may somewhat appear by the signification taken from Urines;
wherefore you ought to proceed after this manner, when the urine is brought
from far, to wit, whose Particles are disturbed by much shaking, unless it be
kept for some time in a warm place, they will not easily get again their due
place of position. But if you often visit any Patient that keeps his bed, it
will be convenient, that the urine newly made, and put into an Urinal, be
placed near a Stove, where, whilst it grows moderately hot, the several parts
may, after the best manner, be disposed to a settlement without any trouble or
disturbance.

Afterward the Urine thus naked, and as it were disrobed from any covering, is
offered to the sight, the next caution will be, lest any of its Phenomena or
appearances being accidentally contracted, and not properly belonging to it,
may impose upon the Physician: which indeed sometimes happens, by reason of
alterations caused in them by food taken, and which chiefly consist in the
color and smell of urines, being variously changed besides Nature, and the
expectation of the Physician.

For it is an error commonly committed, when the Urine being yellow, and
tinging the linen by the taking of Rhubarb, Saffron, Sanders, and the like,
undoubtedly to believe it a sign of the Jaundice; also the urine being imbued
with blackness by the taking of Cassia, to attribute it to the melancholic
Tumor or black Bile; also when the urine is deep colored by taking of
Pulse-broth, or a Decoction of Madder, or other drinks, we falsely suppose it to
indicate a feverish intemperance. It often happens from the drinking
plentfully thin liquor, the urine is lessened of its high color beyond
expectation, and heightened by the drinking of strong drink or hotter things:
unless the Physician take notice of these kinds of mutations, he will give but
a false Judgment concerning Urines by looking on them. When therefore the
color is changed in the urines without any manifest cause, the manner of
living must be inquired into, if that the alteration proceeds from what is
eaten or drunk, that it may not be wrongfully ascribed to the disease. A
question will here arise, why forasmuch as most things taken in at the mouth,
before they go into urine, wholly lose all their color; yet some others, which
being eaten, so pertinaciously impress a tincture to the Serum, that they pass
untouched through all the strait turnings and windings of the passages? The
reason or cause of which consists chiefly in this, that some mixtures have the
constitutive parts of their color or dye very subtle, and those highly
volatile; wherefore these being taken only in a small quantity, dye the whole
mass of the Chyle with their color; and from thence the nutritious Juice
conveyed to the blood, ascends colored, and its vehicle, viz. the serous
Latex, is sent away still dyed or tinctured.

What the odor of Urines of sound people may be, is obvious to every one that
can smell, viz. whilst it is fresh made, it is not very ungrateful, by reason
of the sulphurous and saline Particles bound up in the substance of the
liquor; when it has stood so long, that the Sulphur begins to exhale, sharpened
with the Salt, the mixture being loosned, it putrifies and stinks grievously.
Besides we may observe, that sometimes there arises from urines fresh made, a
sweet odor like Violets, and sometimes they offend the nose with a very
ungrateful stink. The former does not depend either on an healthful or
unhealthful condition of the body, but is produced only from things taken:
Turpentine, Nutmeg, and other Gumms and Spices taken in at the mouth, though of
a diverse nature and operation, impart a like suavity or sweetness to the
urine. The reason of this seems to be, because in these kind of mixtures very
many particles of the purer Sulphur (that is imbued with Spirits) are eminent;
which, for that they are volatile, being confused with the Serum, are not
contained in the bond of the mixture: wherefore the urine being made, these
alone leap out, and not accompanied with others of the stinking urine, and so
diffuse a grateful odor; which, although it proceeds from diverse kind of
things eaten, yet remains still after the same manner like Violets, for that in
all, those sulphurous Particles are set free by digestion from the others
joined with them in the same concrete, nor are infected by different ones from
the urine. But as to what respects the stinking urine, that sometimes proceeds
from an Ulcer about the Reins, Bladder, or urinary passages; sometimes also it
is raised from a too hot intemperance of the Reins, or of the whole Body: for
when the Sulphur is deeply boiled in the Serum, its particles being sharpened by
the Salines, (for that they are less closely shut up) do presently evaporate,
and grievously affect the sense of smelling; but besides, sometimes urines
contract a stink from things eaten. For the Balsam of Sulphur, Garlic,
Asparagus, Cider, Rhenish Wine, and many other things taken at the mouth, do
cause a strong smell in the urine. If the reason of this be demanded, we say
that such things which impart a stink to the urine, also provoke it in a more
plentiful quantity: wherefore it seems that these sort of things being taken,
fuse the blood, and greatly hasten the precipitation of the Serum: and when by
this means the serous Juice is pulled away as it were abruptly from the blood,
the frame of the liquor is made lax, nor are its parts exactly mixed, nor
contained in an equal bond of disposition: wherefore when this urine is made
from the body, its frame or substance being before loosned, the particles of
the more gross Sulphur (that is combined with Salt) presently breathe out, and
so diffuse a stinking smell. For urine thus altered by things taken, seems very
like to Lie, wherein Antimony or common Sulphur is boiled, and is afterward
instilled into some acid thing, because in this Decoction, as also in such
urine, the frame of the liquor being unlocked, the little sulphurous bodies
leap out, and affect the sensory with a stinking smell.

If that any one more curious in the search of Urines, shall seek further than
the examination of the sight and smell, he may easily, by a diverse manual
operation, resolve them into parts, and as it were dissect them to the life,
and thence draw Medicinal directions of no small moment; for that in many
Chronical diseases where the Dyscrasies of the blood are more exactly to be
sought into, that the proportion and temperature of Salt and Sulphur may be
truly found in it, it is sometimes convenient to evaporate urines, or to distill
them; something also is to be learned from them, being precipitated, or loosned
by putrefaction. I knew an honest Woman greatly afflicted with a scaly
filthiness of the skin, which she was daily wont to scratch off in great
plenty, as it were a branny matter. Her urine being evaporated in a little
Skillet, lest sticking to the sides of the Vessel, a crusty and salt sediment,
like the excrement of her skin. Not long since I evaporated the urine of a
Gentleman, grievously subject to convulsive motions and painful stretchings out
of the Muscles, in the bottom of which there remained a quantity of salt and
tartarous matter, exceeding the weight of half the liquor. By this means it
will be an easy thing to find the proportion of the saline Principle in the
blood and humors: but whether this Salt be volatile, or becomes fixed beyond
measure, the distillation of the urine will presently show: For if the Spirit
(so called) be copiously drawn out of the urine, and that besides the Salt
ascends into the Alembeck, it is a sign of volatilization: but the contrary to
this argues the fixity of the Salt.

As the evaporation and distillation of the Urine show the power of the saline
Principle, so the precipitation, putrefaction, and Sulphur lay open the thicker
contents of the Urine, as it were in weight and measure. As to the former,
although the liquor of the urine be salt, and often big with contents, yet for
as much as its saline Particles are not (as it is wont to be in most
Menstruums) either wholly in a state of fixity, or of flux, but for the most
part volatile, therefore it is not easily nor presently by any salt infusion
subject to putrefaction; the Spirit of Vitriol and other acetous things effect
nothing: the Salt of Tartar stirs up a little perturbation. But the solution of
Alum, for that it greatly constrains into a little space, presently disturbs
the whole liquor extremely, and delivers all the contents of the urines, as
they were thrust out of their dens, to be seen openly by the eyes. Wherefore by
this means, without any long stay for settlement, you may presently know how
much of sulphurous and earthy matter is deposed from the mass of blood for
recrements in the bottom.

The putrefaction of Urines is wont to exhibit the several particles of every
kind, yet more distinct, and disposed as it were by themselves; for if the
urine be left to stand unmoved for many days in the Glass, the color, odor,
and consistency will be very much altered, for the color will be deeper, the
smell ungrateful, and highly stinking, the consistency thicker, and will have
on the superficies a downiness or hoariness, sometimes whitish, sometimes
bluish; there will be also fixed in the bottom of the Vessel a thick and
copious sediment, and often on the sides a sandy or tartareous crust, of a
whitish or Ash Color. From these kind of appearances, and as the urines sooner
or later putrify, and so are more or less altered from their former state, it
may be conjectured what the proportion of Salt or Sulphur may be, whether of
them exceeds the other: also no unfaithful Judgment of the quality and plenty
of the earthy matter or the contents may be taken from hence.

And thus, Sir, at length you have the Doctrine or Method of Separation of
Urine, such as our unskilfulness has rendered it: I desire you would be pleased
not only to pardon the errors and barrenness of this Discourse, but also to
excuse it in other things, because at first writ by your persuasion, and then
by your command and request made public. Wherefore pray take care of this
child hardly brought forth and almost an abortive, and as it were exposed and
deservedly laid at your door, without portion. Farewell.

Two Physical and Medical EXERCITATIONS, VIZ. I. Of the Accension of the Blood.
II. Of Musculary Motion.

The first Medical and Physical DISCOURSE. Of the growing hot or inkindling of
the Blood.
IT is long since I designed to print my Meditations concerning the remaining
Pathology of the Brain and Nervous stock: But when many Diseases of that kind
affect the animal Spirits, and not rarely the whole Hypostasis of the corporeal
Soul more immediately than the Humors or solid Parts; I therefore thought it
necessary first to publish the Disquisitions of the nature of this Soul, and
its manner of subsisting, and also of its Parts and Powers, that from these
things rightly known, its preternatural Passions may at length be the better
discovered. But concerning these very hard matters, and difficult to be
unfolded, when I had begun to frame (as I think) probable and rational
Arguments, I saw well that they would be looked upon and laughed at by some as
unusual things and Paradoxes; which indeed it becomes me not to take ill, but
to let every one freely to enjoy his own sense, and to use in all things his
own opinion and judgment. Among the many things conjecturally proposed by me,
(which I could not avoid) two chief Arguments are opposed, to wit, that I had
affirmed, that the blood for the continuing of life was inkindled, and that the
animal Spirits, for the motive act, were exploded: which terms, though perhaps
they may sound rough and strange to be applied to the animal economy; yet if
any one shall weigh the Reasons and Arguments which do persuade to the truth of
either opinion, I doubt not, but that there will be none who will not give
their assent, or easily pardon me for mine. In the first place therefore,
because there are so many opinions concerning the growing hot of the Blood, for
that some attribute it to an innate heat, others to a flame in the Heart, some
also to a fermentation of the bloody mass, and others to its inkindling;
therefore I shall endeavor more narrowly to introspect the matter, and as much
as I am able, to build upon a more certain Ratiocination, its genuine Cause,
though very abstruse.

We have formerly discoursed concerning that Soul, which is common to the more
perfect Beasts, with that subordinate or more inferior of Man, and have showed
it to be indeed Corporeal, and to consist of two parts; the one of these rooted
in the blood we called a Flame, and the other dwelling in the Brain and nervous
stock, Light. As we shall here only treat of the former, I think it will be no
difficult matter to make use of the same Reasons and Instances, which truly
conclude, or at least very like truth, that in the first place the blood is
animate or has life: secondly, that this Animation is in its accension or
inkindling, or consists in an affection most analogical to this.

1. Not only the opinions of Philosophers, but the undoubted testimony of the
Sacred Scripture plainly asserts the animation of the blood: to wit, the use of
blood was forbidden in the Mosaical Law, for this reason, because the Blood is
the Life or Soul; which is also apparent by the observation of the most famous
Harvey, for that its motion is to be observed by the eye, shows that it first
lives and last dies. For the greater proof of this, it is commonly known that
Animals only live so long as the blood remains in its due plenty and motion;
and that they presently dye, if either too great a quantity of this be taken
away, or its motion suppressed.

But as to the second Proposition, to wit, that the life or soul of the fervent
blood depends upon its inkindling; this will appear probable, if I shall show:
First, that the liquor of the blood ought to be very hot in the more perfect
living Creatures. Secondly, that this growing hot can be produced or conserved
in the blood by no other means besides accension or inkindling. Thirdly, that
some chief affections, as it were proper passions of fire and flame, are
agreeable to the life only of the blood growing hot. Fourthly and lastly, these
being clearly shown, some other less signal accidents and properties, in which
common flame and life agree, are added, and also we will unfold how and in what
respect they differ among themselves.

As to the first we affirm, that the blood is perpetually moved in all living
Creatures; besides in the more perfect it does estuate or grow hot in act.
Indeed its undiscontinued motion is required, both for the conservation of the
disposition of the blood it self, whose liquor would otherwise be subject to
stagnation and putrefaction, as also that being carried about in the whole
body, it might be able to give a due tribute to all parts. For that the offices
of the blood, at least in the more perfect living Creatures, are diverse and
manifold, viz. to instill matter in the Brain and nervous stock for the animal
Spirits to dispense the nutritious Juice into all the solid parts, to suggest
to the motive parts an elastic Copula, and besides to separate all recrements
and worn out Particles, and to put them aside into convenient Emunctories.

But although the mere motion of the Blood in less perfect Animals, or at least
its moderate swelling up, such as may be perceived in Wine and other Liquors
agitated into Fermentation, is able to sustain and perform the economy of
Nature; to wit, for as much as both a crude nutriment is every where received
from the river of the blood, though cool, continually flowing into all parts of
the whole Body, and that fewer spirits and more thick, as it were separated by
percolation or straining, enter the Brain and nervous stock with that plenty,
that may suffice for local motion, and the Organs of the few senses to be
rudely actuated: yet the blood watering the bodies of more perfect Animals,
require offices of a far more excellent kind; for it ought not only to be
carried about with a continual and more rapid motion, but very much to swell
up, yea actually to grow hot or effervent: to wit, for that end, that its frame
or substance being very much loosned, it may more copiously send forth the
respective Particles of various kinds, every where falling off from it, and may
dispose them here and there for the use and wants of Nature.

But first, for that the animal Spirits are continually to be supplied in great
plenty from the mass of blood, and that there is need for the elastic Particles
requisite for the locomotive function, to be thence perpetually poured into all
the Muscles, it seems very necessary that the liquor from whence these generous
and manifold supplements are drawn should be actually hot, or rather should
burn forth; to wit, that the aforesaid Particles, not sufficiently to be
unlocked but by heat or burning, should freely run out from the substance or
frame of the liquor: which truly is manifest, because from Wine, and also from
the same bloody Liquor, and all other spirituous things, a subtle and
spirituous humor is copiously drawn, but not to be performed by distillation
without heat or fire. Yea the sulphurous Particles, although they are less apt
to be exhaled from any Liquor, yet they most readily fly out by inkindling the
subject. By these there is an apparent necessity of the blood's growing hot for
the perfection of the animal as well as vital function; but that it may appear
by what means this is done, to wit, whether by Accension, or by Fermentation,
or by any other way, we shall first in general inquire, by what means, and for
what causes any liquid things are wont to grow hot; then we shall consider, to
which of these the growing hot of the blood ought to be attributed.

Concerning these we say, that there are only three ways, or so many kinds of
causes, by which Liquors conceive a heat, viz. first, by fire or heat being put
to them, as when water is made to sees or boil over the fire, or that it grows
hot by the heat of the Sun, a Bath, or Stove, or by the dissolution of quick
Lime; instances of all which are commonly known. For the same reason
Bath-waters seem to boil. For, that we may instance in our own Baths, to wit,
they are impregnated neither with Sulphur nor fixed Salt, as I have plainly
experimented, by distilling and evaporating them, and by pouring into them
precipitating Liquors; yea by dissolving them with Sulphur, and many other
ways. They most resemble Limewater, and they, as we believe, grow hot from a
like cause, to wit, by imbibing the fiery little bodies somewhere hid within
the Earth. Of these, unless it had been superfluous, we had here given a fuller
description, which may perhaps be done at some other time. Secondly, when
saline Corrosives, which are of a diverse kind, being mingled with themselves,
or with sulphurous things, work mutually one on another with a great strife
and agitation of Particles, and oftentimes excite heat, yea sometimes fume and
flame; as when the Spirit and Butter of Antimony are poured to, or mixed with
stygian Water, wherein lixivial Salts are melted, or with Oil of Turpentine, or
other distilled things; besides when corrosive Liquors eat metallic Bodies,
they often grow hot. Thirdly, and the only way besides (as I suppose) whereby a
liquid thing is made hot, is when any humor, being very much imbued with
Sulphur or Spirit, conceives a burning by putting a flame to it, and so grows
hot by burning forth. This is ordinarily seen in oily or very spirituous
Liquors, being inkindled and inflamed.

There remain indeed some other ways of Calefaction, to wit, Fermentation,
Putrefaction, and Attrition, whereby more thick Bodies, or Solids, often
conceive a fervor, but they produce not such an effect in Liquids: whilst the
mealy Mass or Dough is fermented, the active Particles being stirred up into
motion, unfold themselves on every side, and lift up the bulk or substance of
the subject; in the mean time, for as much as the sulphurous Particles being
agitated with them, take hold one of another, and begin to be combined, a
certain heat, though more remiss, is excited; in like manner from Putrefaction,
Dung or wet Hay get an heat, to wit, for as much as the sulphurous Particles,
within included, are very thickly heaped up together, then being combined
together, they break out in troops: yet no Liquors, either thin or thick,
whether they ferment or putrify, do for that reason at any time grow hot: For
Wines, whilst in fermenting they break in pieces the sides of the Tun, or
overflow the top of the Vessel with a great noise and ebullition, do not
actually grow hot, yea not so much as grow warm. The blood being let out of the
Body, and placed in convenient Glasses, either to ferment or putrify, does not
get any actual heat: yet in truth we grant the Blood in living Creatures to be
fermented, and by fermenting to be putrified, yea and some other offices of the
animal economy to perform the same: moreover, we have formerly showed from its
Fermentation being hindered, or too much increased, or otherwise depra^ed,
diverse kinds of diseases to be produced: yet we deny the heat of the blood to
be excited by Fermentation. Because neither the blood of more frigid Animals,
nor Wines, nor any other Liquors, though agitated with the highest
Fermentation, are for that reason actually hot. And indeed the reason seems
evident enough, to wit, because the sulphurous Particles being raised up in
the more thick subjects, though they lay hold on one another mutually, and
being more thickly heaped together, raise up heat: yet in Liquids, the same
kind of Particles, however stirred up or agitated, are immediately disjoined by
the watery coming between, and are hindered from their mutual embrace and
combination; so that they cannot of themselves produce an actual heat: For the
same reason, hard Bodies being rubbed one against another, or violently knocked
or bruised, do not only produce heat, but oftentimes fire; whenas yet Liquids,
however shaken and agitated, do not grow warm. Therefore as there are only
three ways, whereby actual heat may be begotten in all Liquors, we shall
inquire to which of these the heat of the Blood may be ascribed.

First, Some say it is the first way, from the opinion both of the Ancients,
and of some of the Moderns: the Blood is said to grow hot, by reason of some
hot thing put to it, to wit, whilst those affirm an innate heat, and these a
little flame to be placed in the Heart, and to heat the blood passing through
it; but either of these opinions easily fails, from which it is clear, that the
Heart is a mere Muscle, her does contain in it self any tinder or matter for a
flame or heat (I know not how) implanted, fit for their continuance. For though
it be confessed, that on the continual motion of this Bowel, (which is only
animal) the Circulation of the Blood does depend, yet the Heart borrows heat
altogether from the blood, and not the blood from the Heart.

Secondly, As to what respects the second way of making hot a liquid thing, to
wit, whereby a great heat is excited by the mixing of saline Corrosives
together, or also oily, or by corroding a metallic Body, I think there is none
that will seriously assert, that the blood grows hot from such a cause; for
that its liquor, in its natural state, is always homogene, and although it be
stuffed with plenty of Salt, it is however with that which is volatile gentle,
and benign only: But there is not to be found, either in the Heart, or in any
other place a saline or any otherwise heterogene Mine, whereby the bloody
liquor, by working or corroding, may get or conceive an heat: to wit, it
behooves either such a Mine or the Body to be corroded, to be perpetually
renewed, because the ebullition and heat raised up by the strife of Salts,
ceases as soon as the Salts are combined, or the Body corroded. If at any time
the saline Particles of the humors in our Body depart from their right temper,
and become enormous and unbridled, for that reason the blood, as to heat and
motion, enters into some irregularities; yet it seems impossible, that it
should originally and perpetually become hot by the congression, and strife, or
corrosion of the Salts.

Thirdly, As to the third way, whereby Liquids are made hot, though it may seem
an uncouth saying, That the blood is so inkindled, yet since we cannot
attribute it to any other way besides, what should hinder from attributing its
heat to this Cause? And the rather, for that the proper passions of Fire and
Flame are agreeable to the life of the Blood alone.

For indeed these three things are chiefly and principally Essentials,
requisite for the perpetuating flame. First, that there be granted to it,
as soon as it is inkindled, a free and continued accession of the Air. Secondly,
that it may enjoy a constant sulphurous food. Thirdly, that its recrements
both sooty, as also the more thick, be always sent away. So then if I shall
show these things to agree after the same manner with life, as flame, and to
those only, without doubt, I think that life it self may be esteemed a certain
kind of Flame.

In the first place therefore, that a flame may be inkindled, and remain
inkindled, there is need of a free and undiscontinued access of Air, and that
not only, that the vaporous Effluvia's, threatening the suffocation of the
flame, may be carried away, and always depart, but much rather, that the
nitrous food necessarily requisite for the burning of any thing, may be
supplied by the Air. For indeed every sublunary fire, and especially flame, is
compounded or made up altogether of sulphurous Particles, breaking out in
heaps from a combustible Body, and of nitrous Bodies, which every where flow in
the Air, meeting with them: when Particles of Sulphur, breaking out slowly or
interruptedly, get to themselves a few nitrous, only planted near them, a fire
is usually produced, such as is seen in a burning Coal: But when the former
going away more impetuously, either of their own accord, or forced by blowing,
presently lay hold on very many nitrous Particles flowing round about in the
whole circuit, a flame arises. In truth the whole region of the Air is
abundantly stuffed with nitrous little bodies, which are every where ready for
the constituting of fire and flame, and they being any where inkindled, meet
them after the manner of a stood, although not always after the like manner or
measure, because it is observed at some times, especially in the Winter-cold,
when the Air abounds more in Nitre, that fire or flame does more ardently burn,
and diffuse farther its heat: on the contrary, in rainy weather, as also when
the beams of the Sun shine upon the fire, and so dissipate the Nitre of the
neighboring Air, the fire is so dulled, as is commonly said, that it is
extinguished by the Sun. If at any time the nitrous Particles of the Air are
excluded from the sulphurous of any subject breaking out in the inkindling or
burning, the fire and flame quickly perish; which appears, because this or that
being put into a Glass, after the Air is sucked out or excluded, they presently
expire. Further, in the open Air, although a naked fire propagates a fire in a
fireable matter by mere contact, yet a flame is hardly inkindled without a
flame be put to it, or a very strong fire: because, for the stirring up of a
flame very many nitrous Particles of the Air, implanted round about, ought to
be inkindled at once; as if Nitre and common Sulphur being pounded together, be
commixed (because both incentives agree) even the least spark falling into such
a mixture begets an highly impetuous flame, which desiring no farther a nitrous
food, is inkindled or burns under water, in a place void of air, or in any
place as freely as in the open air. In like manner the least sulphurous
things, as a bit of ponderous wood, being cast into a red-hot Crucible, in
which Nitre is fused, the same at first touch presently conceive a flame, and
continue till it be wholly consumed: But that fire and flame being included in
a place empty of air, expire by reason of the food of Nitre being drawn away,
rather than choked by their own proper smoke, Exper. Phys. Mec. 50.
the Illustrious Mr. Robert Boil has most clearly demonstrated by very many
Experiments. For a Candle being lighted, and put into a capacious globe of
Glass, and the Vessel stopped up: as soon as the air was sucked out by a
wind-instrument, the flame did expire. Moreover he observed, what concludes for
our Hypothesis, Exper. 1.3.
that the flame contracted it self according to all its dimensions, as soon as
ever the Engine began to suck, then after the second or third draught of the
drawn forth air, the flame about the utmost extremities appeared very blue, and
to go back more and more from the Tallow, till at length getting to the top of
the snuff it expired: the same Candle being again lighted, and shut up in the
recipient, this worthy Gentleman tried how long it was able to sustain its
light, when the air was not exhausted, and he found it to endure much longer
lighted than before. From these it clearly appears, that the flame shut up,
expires not so much because it is suffocated by its own proper smoke, as
because it is destitute of the nitrous food of the Air. For in the former
Experiment the air being exhausted, there was more space for the smoke and
fume, that the flame might not be stifled, and yet this dyed sooner, the
Recipient being empty, than the same being full of air; besides, the flame
dying became bluish, for as much as it participated of more Sulphur than Nitre;
and it left the Tallow, and expired at the top of the snuff, for that it
followed its most necessary food as far as it was able, Exper. 78.
to wit, the nitrous Particles of Air. The same Experiment succeeded alike in
live Coals, viz. the naked fire, after the food of Nitre was drawn away,
suddenly dyed. Here also it does what the flame of a Candle does in Mines or
Caves under ground, where the nitrous air is wanting or dispelled, at first it
becomes more contracted and blue, and then a little after expires.

I have been more large in this Argument, because there is for both the like
necessity of drawing in of the air, after the same manner, for the sustaining
the life of the Blood, and for the continuing of flame. For the more hot
Animals, if they are hindered from respiration dye quickly, wherefore the same
means of killing is most ready and common to shut up the breath, which being
wholly obstructed, life perishes as a flame. If it should be objected, that
those choked do dye, because the foot or smoke being retained, blow up and
intumifie the bloody mass, which for that reason, the bulk or substance being
increased, and made almost immovable, fills the bosom of the Heart, and
hinders its motion: I say, that this is improbable, because if the Arteries,
every where in the Limbs and about the Neck, be strained hard together with
Ligatures, that the blood being straightened as to the compass of its circuit, be
very much stopped about the Praecordia, (more certainly than can happen from
the mere retained smoke) yet for that cause death neither presently follows,
nor any deadly Symptoms. That this happens in those that are hindered from
respiration, because the vital flame of the blood is wanting of the nitrous
food of the Air, rather than overthrown by its proper soot or smoke being
detained, Exper. 41.
the most Famous Boil also by his Experiments has put it out of doubt; for he
has observed, that hot living Creatures being put within a glassy Globe, and
shut up, did far sooner expire, the air being drawn away from them, than the
same being left within it, though in the former case, there was more space left
for the receiving the smoke, left the retaining of it might constipate the
blood: yet however, if the heat of the blood should arise from Fermentation, or
the congression of dissimilar Particles, or from an ebullition, by reason of
admitted heat, or from any other cause besides accension, it is so far that
that effect could be inhibited or suppressed by reason of the air being
excluded, that on the contrary it would rather for that cause become more
strong or intense. For it appears, by a common observation, that Liquors
chiefly fermentable, the more strictly they are kept in the Vessel, the more
they grow hot, and the air being admitted through some vent-hole, they
presently cease from their fury. Moreover, Mr. Boyl's Experiments clearly show,
that the effervescencies or growing servent, stirred up by the ebullition of
unlike Particles, or by corrosion, also the boiling up of hot water in a
glassie Sphere, are above measure increased after the air is sucked out,
Experiment. Physicom. 41, 42, 43. That most ingenious Tract of the aforesaid
Author supplies us with many Experiments, whereby it is abundantly manifest,
that the intestine motions of those Particles, and almost of every thing,
besides fire and life, are very much heightened or made strong in the space
emptied of air; but their act, presently after the air is withdrawn, is
extinguished: hence we may conclude, the life of a living Creature to be either
fire, or something analogical to it. The like to these is yet more clearly
observed by the diggers of Minerals, who ordinarily experiment in subterranean
Caves, where either the Nitre is wanting, or is driven away by some strange
damp or vapor, so that they are in danger of being stifled or smothered, at
the same time the flame of the Candle is diminished, becomes blue, and at
length expires.

The second thing requisite to sustain a flame, is a constant supply of
sulphurous food, whereby it may continually be fed, which being subtracted,
or by reason of some incongruous mixture depraved, the flame is extinguished;
as is perceived in a Lamp, which for want of oil, or water poured in its place,
expires: further, as this sulphurous food is more or less suggested, sometimes
more plentifully, sometimes more sparingly, the flame being more or less
intense, is sometimes produced clear, sometimes smoaky; in the mean time, the
food being constantly consumed by burning, goes away partly into vaporous
Effluvia's, and partly into ashes, which are made up of some Particles of
Earth, Salt, and Sulphur: But it is much otherwise in Liquors exposed to
Fermentation, to which if new Particles be continually administered, and the old
ones depart, the Fermentation is hindered or disturbed.

In like manner, as in Flame, the Blood of the hotter Animals (and this only in
all natural things, besides fire) requires a constant and copious sulphurous
food; and that being quickly worn, is for the most part consumed in vaporous
Effluvia's, a Caput mortuum being left of Earth, Salt, and stinking Sulphur: In
the mean time from its food consumed by burning, it disposes other Particles
for other uses. That the life or flame of the blood does continually want
aliment, there is none but daily finds it in himself: For if that be for some
time denied, the vigor of the blood is diminished, yea and consuming the solid
parts, it snatches into its bosom their remnants, and other humors of the Body
whereby it may be fed. If the nutriment daily suggested from things taken, be
too thin and watery, the fervor of the blood, like flame without food, uses to
be remitted; but if the food be very sulphurous and swelling with a vinous
Spirit, and plentifully taken in, the blood is presently inflamed, and often
breaks out into a Fever, as it were an open burning. In the interim out of
that food of the blood exhausted or consumed, as it seems by accension, hot
Effluvia's full of soot and vapor go away, which according to a just account,
far exceed all the other excrements of the Body; and that their nature is
plainly fiery, the frequent burning of the mouth and tongue, and infecting them
with blackness like the soot or smoke of a Chimney, witnesses; besides, from
the inflamed blood adust Feces, like a Caput mortuum, are sent into the Bladder
of the Gall, Spleen, and perhaps into other Emunctories.

Thirdly, That inkindled Flame may for some time continue, there is need of
continual ventilation, to wit, that its sooty Effluvia's may still fly away,
which else being detained and heaped together thereabouts, will suffocate the
fire, because by obstructing the Pores of the inflamed Body, they hinder the
eruption of the sulphurous matter to be inflamed. Although this condition does
often interfere with the other more potent, viz. the necessity of nitrous food
to be so drawn in from the air, that it can scarce be distinguished from it;
yet we may plainly perceive, from the detained soot gathered together about the
snuff, the light to be put out: for which cause a Lamp, whose wick is made of
plumous Alum or other incombustible matter, will not (as it promises) endure
any long time, because the soot sticking to the wick, hinders the access of the
oil to the flame; for this reason blasts of wind from the Air wiping away the
sootiness, does not only render the flame more clear, that is free from fume
and thick vapor; but food being sufficiently given to it, it becomes more
durable.

Even as Flame, the life of the Blood requires also continual ventilation; to
which end, besides the greater breathing places of the Breast, innumerable
lesser, viz. the Pores of the skin gaping every where through the whole Body,
do send forth Effluvia's departing plentifully from the boiling blood; which if
it happens to be hindered, or too closely shut up, the blood will grow
excessively hot, being as it were beset with fume and vapor: besides, there is
need to shorten its circuit, that passing through the Lungs with a more
frequent turn, it might there, as much as it can, dispel all its soot or smoke.
When the Heavens are heated, the Air seems as it were immovable and to
stagnate, we are wont very much to estuate or grow hot about the Praecordia;
for that the blood being fed with a more sparing nitrous food, does not burn so
clearly, but glows with a more suffocating and intrinsic burning: further, for
that the Particles of the Air being less nimble, when they are inspired and
expired or breathed forth, do not so readily convey away the vaporous
Effluvia's of the blood; hence it is, that we fan the Air, that it may be made
more moveable, and carry away more quickly and plentifully the soot or smoke
from our Praecordia.

There yet remain some other smaller Considerations of Fire and Flame,
respecting indeed not so much the Essence, as the production and extinction of
either, which, whether and how far they may agree with the life of the Blood,
we shall briefly inquire into.

Fire or Flame is produced two ways, viz. either it is kindled from another
fire or flame, or begot by an intestine motion of sulphurous Particles. We
have largely showed the Species of either, and the manner of their being made,
in our Tract of Fermentation (only we omitted there, that the accession of
nitrous food was necessary for the sustaining it) even as flame, the life also
of the hot or warm Blood, we have observed to be produced by a twofold way, to
wit, it is either inkindled from another life or soul, as in Creatures that
bring forth alive; or intrinsical Particles predisposed to animation, are at
length raised up to life with the blood by a long cherishing of external heat,
as in oviparous or egg-laying Creatures.

If it be further demanded, when and how the vital Flame is kindled first in
the Blood? I say, some small beginnings of it are laid up from the conception
it self in the Genital humor, to wit, when the rudiment of the bodily Soul
culled out from the Souls of the Parents, as a little spark stricken from those
flames, is hid in a convenient matter; which being from thence raised up by the
Mothers heat, begins a little to glow and shine, and afterward being daily
dilated with the blood brought forth, and leisurely increased, is equally
extended with the Body, which it actuates and animates. But yet as long as the
young one is included in the Egg or Womb, the vital fire, getting very little
or scarce any aerie food, does not yet break out into open flame, but like a
Brands end covered over with ashes, burns only slowly and very little, and
spreads abroad scarce any heat; wherefore both the formation and increase of
the Embryo depends very much on the Mothers heat, or the cherishment of some
other analogical thing, whereof being destitute it perishes: but as soon as the
young one is born in due time, and begins to breathe, the vital fire presently
receiving the nitrous food, largely unfolds it self, and an heat or
effervescency being raised up through the whole bloody mass, it inkindles a
certain flame; and because the blood then first rushing into the Lungs, having
there gotten an accession of Air, begins to burn, the flesh of that Bowel, at
first reddish, is shortly changed into a whitish color, like burnt ashes, and
the blood it self undergoes a notable alteration; for what did flow of a dark
Purple color into the Pneumonick Vessels from the right side of the Heart,
returning from thence presently out of the Lungs, becomes Crimson, and as it
were of a flame-colour, and so shining, passes through the left Ventricle of
the Heart and the appending Arteries.

Indeed that in Creatures newborn, the color of the Lungs is so suddenly
changed, I think it ought to be attributed to the blood, there at first more
openly inkindled, and their flesh as it were somewhat roasted; although the
mere inflation of the Lungs in a dead Embryo produces the like effect, because
the Membranes of the Lungs and the Parenchyma being distended and increased
into a greater capacity, shake off the stagnating blood, and so draw it away
into little and scarce to be discerned rivulets.

As to the Color of the Blood, so variously changed into circulating from a
dark purple to a crimson, and from this to that, I say, that the immediate
cause of this is, the admixtion of the nitrous Air with the Blood; which
certainly appears, because the change into a crimson, begins in that place
where the blood chiefly gets the access of the Air, viz. whilst it is
transferred out of the Arteries into the Pneumonick Veins; for in those it
appears of a dark Purple, in these every where florid, as the most Learned
Doctor Lower has observed. Further, it yet farther appears, that this
alteration of the color proceeds from the admixture of the Air, because that
crimson color follows in the superficies of all blood, let out of the Vessels
by reason of its meeting or mingling with air; and if the flowering or top be
taken away, another presently arises. Besides, the blood being let out of a
Vein, and very much struck with a switch or rod, it becomes crimson through
all: and in like manner the blood of living Creatures shines at first within
the Pneumonick Veins, to wit, presently after the influx of the air by the
Windpipe; and from thence, by reason of the same Particles of inkindled air
being yet retained, it passes through all the Arteries still florid; in the
mean time, from the Nitre of the Air mingled with the sulphurous Particles,
and burning with them, the blood being greatly rarefied, and in truth expanded
into flame, impetuously swells up within all the passages of the Pneumonick
Vein and the great Artery, sending from it self copious breaths and hot
Effluvia's; but being dilated toward the ends of the Arteries, and returning
toward the Heart, that it may enter more closely into the little mouths of the
Veins, it lays aside its turgid and burning aerie Particles, and being presently
made more quiet and half extinct, and so both its vigor and also its color
being changed, it returns through the passages of the Veins, that at length
running into the Lungs, it might renew its burning. After this manner, that the
inkindled blood might flame through the whole Body with a perpetual and equal
flame, and successively renew its burning in all its Particles, it ought to be
carried about by a perpetual course from the nest of its accension into all
parts, and from these to that. For this end the Machine or Engine of the Heart
was needful, as a Pin or Cock, which being made with a double bosom, might
receive in it self from the whole Lungs the blood fresh inkindled, that it
might presently drive forward, whilst burning, into every part of the whole
Body, and might then receive the burnt and half extinguished blood returning
from the whole Body; which being imbued with new inflammable juice, it might
deliver to the Lungs to be re-inkindled.

In performing this task, although the Heart be a mere Muscle, and exercised
only with an animal motion, seems to serve alone for the Circulation of the
Blood; yet in the mean time, it so much helps to moderate the accension of the
blood and its burning, according to the rage of the passions, and to direct
other works and uses of the animated Body, that we have thought the vital or
flamy part of the Soul to have its chief, and as it were Imperial seat in the
Heart and Lungs, in every distemper or affection, as of Grief, Joy, Fear, and
the like; also in the fits of Diseases, the Heart is disposed after a various
manner, and hence it comes to pass, that the blood flowing in fluctuates, and
is inkindled with a diverse rage; of which there will be a more opportune place
of discoursing, when we shall treat of the Passions.

Whilst we consider that the burning of the Blood, and for that reason the
vital or flamy part of the Corporeal Soul does not appear lively or vigorous in
all, nor ever after the same manner or measure; yet it exists according to the
various constitutions of the blood, to wit, as it is more or less sulphurous,
spirituous, saltish, or watery, yea and according to the diverse constitutions
and conformations both of the food, with which this flame is nourished, as also
of the little spiracles or breathing holes, by which it is eventilated; and
further, of the Heart it self, whereby it is agitated and driven about here and
there; the accension of blood varies also in every one, by means of several
other accidents, to wit, as its flame is sometimes great, clear, and expanded,
sometimes small, contracted, or cloudy, sometimes equal and in order, sometimes
unequal and often interrupted, yea and it becomes subject to many other
mutations; also because the Soul it self having gotten a various nature or
disposition, it conceives diverse affections and manners, whereof we shall speak
hereafter; for as much as it is not a little thing, that the disposition of the
whole Soul depends upon the temperament of the bloody mass, and the degree and
manner of its accension or inkindling.

It clearly appears, from what has been said, that Fire and Life do dye or are
extinguished alike many ways, to wit, there is an end of either, if the access
of nitrous food, or the departure of Effluvia's be hindered, or if the oily or
sulphurous aliment, requisite to either, be consumed, too much withdrawn, or
perverted from its inflammable disposition; of each whereof it is so clearly
apparent, that there needs no farther explication.

Thus far we have shown, that the Life of the Blood, or that part of the Soul
growing therein, is a certain kind of Flame; let us now see by what means it is
disposed to burning, and how near it comes to the similitude of a burning
Candle or Lamp.

A common Lamp, whether designed to give heat or light, for the most part is
wont to be made after this manner; to wit, the Oil flowing perpetually to the
wick, gives continual food to the flame; wherefore as there is but one
fireplace or hearth only of light and heat, the action of either is limited
only to one place, and so as often as there is need of more places at once, or
diverse parts of the same space or body to be illuminated or made warm, we place
here and there diverse lighted Candles or Lamps. But if an Instrument made with
great artifice (such as is truly an animated Body) with one liquor only
contained in it, should be made hot throughout the whole, and to be kept always
warm, it ought not only to be lightly inkindled in the wick, but in the whole
superficies, and derived by fit Tubes or Pipes to all the parts of the Machine,
then the burning liquor ought to enjoy, proportionably to all its parts, an
access of nitrous Air, and to lay aside Effluvia's and other recrements, and
ought also to have a supply of that constant expense: these kind of offices are
not to be performed any where up and down, but only in some set places;
therefore the burning liquor ought to be carried about through the whole with a
perpetual turn, that all its portions might enjoy successively all those
privileges, and at once heat the whole capacity of the containing Machine, to
wit, both the inward and outward recesses. Indeed such a Bannian or Bathing
Engine, artificially made, might aptly represent the real Divine handiwork of
the Circulation of Blood, and what burns in it, the Life-lamp.

But it may be objected, that the Blood seems not to be inflammable of its own
nature; further, since there is no flame of this heat or effervency to be
beheld with the eyes, it may well be doubted, whether there be such a thing or
no. I say first, That the Chemical Analysis of the blood shows very many
particles of Sulphur and of Spirit, yea a plentiful stock of inflammable Oil,
which are however mixed with other more thick Elements, in a just proportion,
to bridle their too great inkindling; to wit, that this liquor might flame out
by little and little, and only through fewer parts, for the constituting of a
benign and gentle Lamp of life: wherefore the blood being let out of a Vein
upon a burning fire, does in some measure burn, though it is not like the
Spirits of Wine, or Oil of Turpentine turning all into a flame; besides, the
whole mass of blood, as the Oil of a Lamp, ought not to be fired; yea its
burning is instituted for that end, that whilst all the Particles of the
Mixture being freed, some sulphurous and spirituous are consumed by burning,
others more subtle being sent in Troops, might serve for the necessary uses of
the animal Regiment; and also others more thick or crass and nourishing, as it
were boiled or roasted, might be dispensed for the cherishing all parts;
besides, that all the dead, or worn out, and excrementitious may be sent away
by fit or convenient sinks, and others constantly substituted in their places
by nourishment.

But in the interim, that the vital Flame, which destinated to so many offices,
we suppose to be inkindled in the Blood, (otherwise than the common flame,
which is plainly conspicuous) appears not at all, a probable reason thereof may
be given; as it is most thin, and burns in the Heart, and its depending Vessels
as it were shut up in Receptacles, it does not clearly flame out, but perhaps
remains in the form of smoke, or a vapor, or breath; yea, although the blood
should openly flame out, yet it might be so done, that its shining being most
thin, may not be perceived by our sight, as in the clear light of the day we
cannot behold a glowing red hot Iron, nor shining sparks, nor false fires, nor
rotten wood, nor many other things shining by night; why then may not the vital
fire, even thinner than they, quite escape our sight? Although sometimes hot
living Creatures use to send forth a certain fire or flame only conspicuous by
night: For we have known in some endued with a hot and vaporous blood, when
they have put off their inner garments at night going to bed near a fire or
Candle, a very thin and shining flame to have shown it self, which has
possessed the whole inferior region of the Body. The reason of which affection
seems wholly the same, as when the evaporating fume of a Torch just put out is
again inflamed by a light inkindling, and manifestly argues that another flame,
the root of this extrinsick one, lies hid within the Body. For this very cause
it is, that from the Mains of Horses, and the Skins of Cats, or other hot
Animals being shaken, little sparks as it were of fire leap out, and often
flames, only conspicuous in the dark, arise. Besides, we here take notice in a
burning Fever, caused by immoderate drinking of Wine or strong Waters, that
the blood, as the flame of it is very much increased, does grow excessively
hot, and such are wont to emit dry breaths, and sharp Effluvia's of heat, not
like those that proceed from fermenting or boiling Liquor, but only inflamed.
That which some in Fevers have imagined to have seen or observed even burning
fires and flame in the eyes, argues indeed that the flame of the blood is very
strong, and also that it penetrates the enclosure of the Brain. I knew a
certain ingenious Man of a very hot brain, who affirmed, that after a very
plentiful drinking of Wine, he was able in the darkest night to read clearly;
from hence also may be collected, how the accension of the blood, like that of
burning Liquors, is to be increased or made stronger, viz. by an agitation of
the parts, and a more plentiful affusion of sulphurous food.

But that in the hot blood of living Creatures, the Properties, Affections, and
many other accidents of Fire or Flame are found without the manifest form or
species of it; what if we should say the cause to be, for that the vital flame
of the blood is subjugated, or made subordinate to another form, viz. to the
corporeal Soul? Wherefore, although it retains the chief qualities and
affections of common flame, yet it loses the species of flame or fire; for in
every natural mixture, the superior form exercises a Right and Dominion over
all included Particles whatsoever, however fierce and untameable they may be in
themselves, and stripping them of their species, ordains and disposes them to
peculiar actions in that proper Concrete: when the form of fire excels, that
bright burning, that it might propagate largely its ends, destroys and consumes
all inflammable objects. But if the form of the corporeal Soul be induced upon
the fire, kindled within the blood, it burns forth without fulgor or shining,
or destruction of the subject, and is invisible, and as it were subjugated
flame, is ordained for the sustaining of life and its offices: but truly the
Divine Providence, from the very Creation of the World, has seemed to have
predestined Forms to natural Bodies, to wit, that they might remain as so
many Figures or Types, according to which every portion of matter framing the
Concrete, whether animate or inanimate, might be modificated; so that the Mass,
according to the virtues of the hidden Seeds, being disposed after this or that
manner, happens to have the form of a Stone, a Plant, or Brute, or of any other
kind; then the acts and affections, appropriate to such a Species, follow the
form it self. When therefore Life or Soul is destinated to these kind of
Functions of the more perfect Animals, for the performing of which, the blood,
after the manner of burning Liquors, ought to be perpetually hot, and as it
were inkindled; what should hinder, but that the act of Life, or of that
corporeal Soul (consisting in the motion and agglomeration or heaping together
of most subtle and agil Particles) may be called a certain Burning or perpetual
Fire of the bloody Mass? Wherein although the accidents and chief qualities of
common fire are implanted, yet the form of fire is obscured, as being
subjugated to a more noble form, viz. of the corporeal Soul: not much unlike
water, which being congealed into Ice or Snow, lays aside the species of water
for a time, and may be applied to other uses far distant from fluidity.

But truly, though we affirm, that the corporeal Soul does stick in the Blood,
yet we do not, that it is adequated or limited to it: because whilst the more
thick portion of it, as the Roots of some Tree, fixed in the Earth, are sowed
in the bloody Mass, the more noble part of the same Soul, as the higher
branches, are expanded in the Brain and nervous System; or as we before hinted,
when the vital or flamy part of the Soul is contained in the blood, the animal
or lucid portion of it is contained in the Head and its Appendix; by which just
limit the Sphere of either may be defined, neither may the vital flame
impetuously break through the animal Region, the substance of the Brain being
more cold, and also shining or bright, is opposed to it, as it were an icy or
glassie Bar, whose interior frame or substance, the small and slender as it
were rivers of the blood, for the sake of cherishing heat, can enter: but truly
spirituous Particles plentifully flow from its juice or liquor, every where
heaped up near the confines of the Brain, and there disposed as it were to be
stilled forth, which being immersed in the Brain, and more exalted, affords
matter, out of which the animal Spirits are procreated, to be derived through
the Nerves into the various Regions of the Body.

The second Medical and Physical DISCOURSE. Of Musculary Motion.
AS there are two chief or primary Faculties of the Corporeal Soul, to wit, the
Sensitive and Motive, we have assigned certain exterior Powers of either of
them, which are chiefly acted in the Nervous stock, and others interior, the
Exercises of which lie within the Brain, to wit, such as the Imagination,
Memory, Appetite, etc. What we have publicly discoursed of some time since
both concerning internal and external Senses, may perhaps hereafter be brought
to light and made public: in the mean time, because I am opposed, concerning
both the natural and convulsive Motion, I think it fit at present to publish
what I had meditated touching the Motive power, and what Hypothesis I had
conceived of so hard and highly intricate a thing.

The motive Faculty of the bodily Soul is wont to be exercised with another
kind of Action than the sensitive, viz. with a diverse aspect and tendency of
animal Spirits. For that every Sense is a certain passion, wherein the Soul, or
some portion of it, being outwardly struck, is forced to nod or shake, and a
wavering of the Spirits being inwardly made to look back toward the Head; but
on the contrary, every Motion is a certain Action wherein the Soul seems to
exert it self whole, or part of it self, and by a declination or fluctuation of
Spirits being made to bring forth a Systasis, and to extend something as it
were its member. Further, whilst the Soul so exerts it self, or some part of it
self, that the works then designed might be performed, an heap of animal
Spirits being every where disposed in the motive parts, sometimes one,
sometimes more are raised up by the Soul, which by that means being expanded
with a certain force, and as it were exploded, they blow up the containing
bodies, and so the same being increased as to their thickness, and made short
as to their length, are made to attract the adjoining member, and stir up local
motion.

1. In every motion, these three things ought to be considered: viz. First, the
original of the Action, or the first designation of the Motion to be performed,
which is always in the Brain or Cerebel. Secondly, its instinct or transmission
of the thing begun to the motive parts, which is performed by the commerce of
the Spirits lying within the Nerves. Thirdly, the motive force it self, or
exertion of the Spirits implanted in the moving parts, either into a
contractive or elastick force. From this threefold Fountain, viz. as the
business is performed in every one of these in a various manner, very many
kinds and differences of Motions are deduced.

1. As to the original or beginning of Motion, we shall take notice, that that
which proceeds from the Brain, with a knowing and auspicious appetite, may be
called Spontaneous or Voluntary; but that which is wont to be excited from the
Cerebel, where the Law of Nature presides, such as are Respiration, the Pulse,
with many others, may be called merely Natural, or Involuntary: either of these
is either direct, which is stirred up of it self, or primarily from this or
that beginning, as often as the appetite requires this or that thing, out of a
certain proper, and as I may say, intestine deliberation, and chooses out
respective motions; so in like manner, when the ordinary offices of the natural
and vital Function are performed, according to the solemn Rite of Nature; or
the motion of either kind is reflected, to wit, which depending on a previous
sense more immediately, as an evident cause or occasion, is presently retorted;
so a gentle titillation of the Skin causes a rubbing of it, and the more
intense heats of the Praecordia stir up the Pulse and Respiration.

2. As to the Vehicle of the Instinct, which we suppose to be wholly done by
the Nerves, for as much as it is performed by a single Nerve, or by more at
once, it is called either a Simple or Complicate Motion; then for that some
Nerves help motion more or less than others by sooner or later moving, this or
that member is said to be moved first, or by it self, and another by consent:
yea, and that consent is wont to be acted or done with neighboring or more
remote parts, and that with a diverse respect: But we have in another place
largely shown instances of these kind of sympathetick motions, as also the
causes of each of them, and their manner of being made.

3. There is another, and that a remarkable distinction of Motions, taken from
the various constitution of the moving parts: to wit, parts endued with nervous
Fibers, and in which the motive Spirits dwell; either they are Muscles, which
perform local motions; or membranaceous bodies, the motions of which are
terminated in themselves, which therefore we call Intestine. As to what belongs
to local motion, of which only we treat at present, although it be confessed by
all, that the Brain or Cerebel, and the Nerves and Muscles together one or
more, as it were with joint forces, do contribute to this motion; also, though
it may be sufficiently understood, that the beginning of the motion to be
performed is designed in the Brain or Cerebel, and that its instinct is
conveyed wholly by the Nerves; yet by what means the Muscles perform that work,
far exceeding any mechanic virtue or operation, seems most hard to be made
plain.

That local Motion is performed by traction, and does depend upon the
contraction of a Muscle, is not only a vulgar Opinion, but is also plain by
ocular demonstration; yet it is very much disputed and variously controverted
among Authors concerning the manner of Contraction and efficient Cause; some
think it enough to say, that the Soul it self, by its presence, does actuate
the Muscle, or contract or draw out here and there its Fibers, as it were a net
spread forth. But indeed this is to attribute to the sensitive Soul a
supernatural, and as it were Divine virtue. To wit, that the same, by its mere
Spirit, was able to bend and force heavy and very great bodies whither it
pleases. Further, for what end are the motive Organs framed with wonderful
artifice and manifold difference, unless that after the manner of Machines,
they might perform their operations by an orderly structure, and as it were
mechanical provision of parts? Truly it will be no hard thing to apply the
exercises of a Muscle and of the whole nervous Function, and to explicate them
according to the Rules, Canons, and Laws of a Mechanic. Before I enter upon
this, I think it not amiss first to speak something of the make, conformation,
and use of a Muscle in general. The ancient Anatomists, almost all with one
consent, did divide the body of a Muscle into Head, Belly, and Tail; taking for
the Head the extremity of the Muscle connexed to the part, to which contraction
is made; for the Tail, the end or portion of the Muscle inserted to the part to
be moved; for the Belly, the part of the Muscle coming between, which is beheld
more tumid, with a bulk of flesh; then for the performing of motion, they did
suppose the Muscle to swell up about the Head and Belly, and so to grow short
as to its length, and to attract nearer to it self the hanging part; yet by
what means, and for what cause the belly of the Muscle swells up, none yet has
clearly unfolded.

Moreover, although the Doctrine of the Nerves has been much described by the
most skilful Anatomists of every Age, so that the Muscles of the whole Body (as
it is thought) have been exactly recounted, and offices assigned them, and
monstrous names fitted for the expressing them, yet the true frame of a Muscle,
not yet showed by others, first began to be delivered lately by the most
ingenious Doctor Steno. He has found out in every Muscle two opposite Tendons,
into which both the Fibers go; yea, and has taught, that the same Fibers
wholly, which compose strictly on one side, the Tendon of the knitting being
more loosly joined, do constitute the flesh; yet so, that some being laid upon
others, compose the thickness or profundity of the Muscle, and some laid nigh
to others, its breadth or latitude: he calls the former Fibers Ordines or
Orders, but the other Versus or Turnings; then the parts and composition of a
Muscle being after this manner laid open, he aptly reduces its Figure to
Mathematical Rules, and according to Canons thence taken, shows the action to
be unfolded: because he advertising, that in a Muscle with a simple right line,
all the fleshy Fibers, parallel within themselves, and for the most part equal,
are carried from one Tendon obliquely into another; and that those Tendons are
sowed in the opposite ends or angles of the flesh, whereby he most ingeniously
describes a Muscle to be, a Collection of moving Fibers, so framed together,
that the middle flesh constitute an oblique angular Parallelopipedum, but the
opposite Tendons compose two quadrangular Prisms or Figures. The Instrument
which Painters use for the describing many Examples of the same thing, fitly
represents the figure of this delineated in a plain: because the styles being
fixed to the opposite Angles, express the insertions of the Tendons and the
Parallelogram it self the fleshy part of the Muscle: for when the opposite
Angles are diduced to a great distance from one another, and made sharper, the
two sides come nearer together, and render the Area or middle of the Figure
longer, but narrower, a Muscle not contracted is denoted: But if the same
Angles are brought nearer, and made more obtuse, the two sides go farther
apart, and so make the middle of the Muscle shorter, but also wider, a
contracted Muscle seems to be represented. In the mean time, in either site of
the aforesaid Parallelogram the quantity or longitude of the sides is not
changed, but only their position, and the largeness of the Angles is varied:
whether it may be also so in a Muscle, shall hereafter appear. In the mean time
we shall take notice, out of the observation of the same most Learned Steno,
that a Muscle is either simple, which consists of one belly and two Tendons, of
which sort there are many in the Arm and Leg, which are the movers of the
fingers and toes, yea and almost every where in other parts of the Body; or
compounded, that has many bellies, to every one of which, two opposite Tendons
are hung; yet so, as when those compounded Tendons, to wit, two together, shall
be joined, one compound Tendon enters the middle of the flesh, and the other
embraces the middle on both parts. This is evidently discerned in the Masseter
or Throat-muscle, the Deltoid, and diverse others, in all which, even as in a
simple Muscle, whilst the fleshy Fibers (to which only the motive power
belongs) are contracted, the opposite Angles are enlarged according to the
insertions of the Tendons, and so the bellies being made shorter, and at the
same time thicker, do swell up.

In a simple Muscle, according as one Tendon or both together, or either by
turns, ought to be drawn; besides, according as the part to be drawn is thin,
or broad, or planted near or far off, and for several other respects the fleshy
belly is diversely formed; and as the Rhomboides is its chiefest regular figure,
yet that also is sometimes triangular, sometimes trapezial or quadrangular,
pyramidal, spiral, semilunar or like an Half Moon, or of some other irregular
form. But in all these kind of Muscles, the fleshy Fibers, according to all
their positions, whilst they are contracted, at the same time intumifie or
swell up, and are shortened from either end toward the middle, though in all
Muscles not always in a like manner and dimension; for if either Tendon be to
be drawn at once, the contraction from either fleshy end, is for the most part
equal; but at the same time, if one only be drawn from the others that are
immovable, the contraction is made less, and sometimes, viz. where the flesh
immediately sticks to the bone without any notable Tendon, almost none.

The compounded Muscles are distinguished with a far greater variety; for
besides their diversity of figures, all which would be an immense labor to
enumerate, according as they are more or less compounded, or have their bellies
more or fewer, with a manifold Series stretched out here and there, with Fibers
sometimes of the same, sometimes of a diverse order, they are very much
differenced.

The more thin and less compounded Muscle, when perhaps it is sorted into two
or three bellies, disposed in the same being plain, has the series of fleshy
Fibers for the most part looking diversely, all the exterior Tendons embracing
one end of the Muscle, and has the others intermediate or that come between
immersed about the other end; so that the several fleshy Fibers of every Belly
lie parallel between the one extreme Tendon and the other intermediate Tendon.
The thicker and more compounded Muscle, that it might perform at once quick,
hard, and long motions, has many bellies planted in diverse plains, and the
series of fleshy Fibers (which are all short) looking many ways. The frame of
them, although it be very intricate, that one can scarce number all the
bellies, much less observe their habitudes, mutual dependences, and means of
connexions among themselves; yet they may in some sort be reduced to this
common Rule in most, to wit, in the great compounded Muscles, such as are those
round ones which contribute mighty strength and elastick force to the middle of
the Arms and Legs, we may take notice, in one end of two vast exterior Tendons
covering almost the whole superficies of the Muscle, which being divided
presently into many fissures or clefts, are stretched out between a broad shoot
or claw to the other extremity of the Muscle; then on the opposite side, about
this other end, a great Tendon enters the middle of the flesh, which also is
cleft or divided presently into many laps, distributed through the whole
interior belly of the Muscle. And as these interior lamens or laps meeting
with the exterior, and being stretched out almost to the opposite end, look
many ways, and have their superficies turning on every side, some every where
are destinated to others opposite, and are committed or sent through the
intervenient series of the fleshy Fibers: such a Muscle, whose very many
bellies being planted in diverse plains, do look many ways, can by no manner or
way be cleft or pulled asunder, but that the other series of fleshy Fibers must
be broke asunder in the midst. The bellies of a Muscle, so very much
compounded, although manifold, yet are very slender, so that the fleshy Fibers
thereof being most short, and having their Angles always equal, but oblique,
with the tendinous laps, for that cause make a most strong attraction. Because
the numerous series of fleshy Fibers seem as it were so many distinct posts or
supporters set together for the moving of any weight, or rather, for that
either great Tendon is presently so cut into many lappets, it is like, as if a
mighty draw-rope, hung for the drawing up a body, should be presently divided
into many little ropes or cords, by which many men might draw at once. For
whilst the several series of the fleshy Fibers are shortened at once, they draw
the opposite Angles of all the tendinous lappets together, and so the belly of
the whole Muscle being intumified or swelled up, they strongly draw either end,
or that which is moveable toward the middle.

On every Muscle, both simple and compound, there is stretched on every side a
membranaceous covering; besides, other little Fibers transverse, to wit,
membranaceous, are woven between the direct moving fleshy Fibers of every one,
which clothe each of them, and keep or fasten them together, yea (as it seems
probable) they both communicate to all the fleshy Fibers the same instinct of
obeying the motion, and also carry to the Tendons, the troops of the inflowing
Spirits, received from the Nerve.

The Arteries and Veins, inserted in the middle of every Muscle, send forth
little branches on all sides, obliquely cutting the moving Fibers, from which
lesser branches dispersed between the Interstitia of the flesh, water them all
with a flux or reflux of the blood. But the Nerve entering the fleshy belly of
every one, distributes some smaller circles only in the neighboring parts, as
it were bearing only the Symbol or mark of the commanded action, commands the
execution of it to the Guard or inferior Company of the fleshy Fibers and
membranaceous Fibrils.

I had designed Figures, almost of every kind of Muscles, to be engraved
according to the natural appearances: but the Printer making haste, I had not
the opportunity to dissect an humane Body, having only taken some few Muscles
from the Leg of an Ox, we have caused them to be delineated to the life, which
are to be seen at the end, although the famous Steno has already accurately
performed this task. Which Figures, if any one think too much bending to
Mathematical Rules, he may with an easy labor behold the same Conformation of
a Muscle, as he has described it in the flesh it self. For if a simple regular
Muscle be cut out of any Animal, and so placed, that the Tendons here and there
be held on the sides, the fleshy Fibers between them intercepted in oblique and
equal Angles, be pressed upon an Horizontal plain, the flesh will be exactly
like a Rhomboides or an oblique angular Parallelopipedum. Then if the site of
the same Muscle being changed, and its Tendons placed above and below, you
shall cut long ways the inferior Tendon, and pull the parts one from another,
and divide by tearing the whole Muscle into two parts, you shall presently see
a most elegant spectacle, all the fleshy Fibers disposed in one series, yea and
parallel between themselves, and of the same longitude, to proceed from one
Tendon into another, and to make both Angles always oblique and equal; although
we cannot cleave after this manner the compounded Muscles, whose manifold
bellies have a diverse plain, yet it will easily appear, to one curiously
cutting them, either raw or boiled, two Tendons to be fitted to each
Parallelogram of the flesh.

As to what respects the action of a Muscle, we plainly saw in dissected living
Creatures, (which only show this) that it is contracted, yet not so as the old
Opinion declared, to wit, that the Fibers being contracted from the end toward
the beginning, one extremity of the Muscle was carried toward the other; but
the fleshy Fibers only and their ends are seen to be contracted toward the
middle, the Tendons being still unchanged and altered neither as to their
longitude or thickness: which thing also the most Learned Steno did first of
all observe long since. This is clearly perceived in the Diaphragma and the
Muscles dedicated for Respiration, which are moved with a constant change: for
as often as the Muscle is contracted, you may behold all the fleshy Fibers, in
either extremity, to be pulled together at once, and as if they would enter on
either side one another to be carried nearer, and so at once to become shorter
and thicker, then from that constriction to return loose to their wonted
longitude and slenderness. Whilst you behold this to be so done, you will
easily think, that something, to wit, spirit or subtle matter does flow from
the Tendons into the flesh or fleshy Fibers, which entering them on either side,
blows them up, and at the same time draws them together nearer within
themselves, that presently all the Fibers are made shorter and intumified; then
when that matter recedes from the flesh or fleshy Fibers into the Tendons, the
Fibers being emptied and loosned from their corrugation or wrinkling, are
restored to their former longitude, and so by turns: whether this in truth be
so done or no, shall be discoursed anon.

In the mean time, that we may proceed to other appearances of Musculary
Motion, if that the Membrane of the Muscle being drawn away, you shall separate
some fleshy Fibers from others by cutting the little fibrils, whereby they are
joined, and loosen them quite, you will see them so singular and free, to be
wrinkled or drawn together in every motion like the others compacted together.

Further, I advertise you, that these Fibers so loosned and freed, some cut off
in one end, and separated from the Tendon, did yet contract themselves to the
motion of the Muscle, together with the other Fibers, about the other whole
end, without that cut off in the mean time growing flaggy or loose. After this
I divided with a pair of Scissers, a certain fleshy portion of the thinner
Muscle, in three or four pieces transverse, the bigness of an inch: which being
done, the portions cut off in either end, only entered into, for a short space,
some light and inordinate corrugations, and presently became immovable. The
other extreme portions of the Muscle so cut, sticking to the Tendons, continued
to be much more lively and longer contracted, but irregularly and convulsively,
to wit, with a certain intortion of the Fibers. Truly, in the Fibers so cut
off, some small footsteps of contraction did remain for a little while, partly
by reason of the Instinct of Motion delivered through the membranaceous
fibrils, by which they did yet cohere with the whole flesh, and partly because
the animal Spirits, implanted in the fleshy Fibers, now divided from the rest,
and left without influence, did exert or put forth their utmost contractive
endeavors after the usual manner. For this reason sometimes in the Heart taken
out, and in a piece of it cut off with a Sword, as also in other Muscles, after
the Nerves and sanguiferous Vessels are cut off, a contraction and relaxation
continue for some time. The other Fibers cut off only by reason of the access
and recess of the Spirits from the Tendons, were able still in some measure to
be contracted and relaxed.

When in the Diaphragma I had freed many singular Fibers from the knittings of
others, I tried what Ligatures put in several places of them might effect. Some
of them then being bound about the middle, were contracted even as the whole
fibers, but with some little swelling about the Ligature. When I had bound
others about the ends, where they cohere to the Tendons, now one, then another,
the motion was chiefly and almost only continued about the free end. Further,
in the fibers bound at both ends at once, the contraction wholly ceased.

Contraction and Relaxation are not only seen, and indeed probable, in the
Heart, but in the Diaphragma and other Muscles appointed for Respiration, which
use to be performed in all, acting vicissively, according to the Instincts of
Nature, and for the most part equally (though there are not the like intervals
of motions in all) yea, and the Muscles serving to the voluntary function,
enter oftentimes into spontaneous Contractions, unless they be hindered by their
Antagonists, as it appears, for that the Spasm or Cramp of one Muscle comes
upon the Palsy of another. Contraction and Relaxation are iterated more
swiftly in the Heart, than in the Muscles of Respiration, and so perhaps in
these, than in several others. In those ready to dye, the fleshy Pannicle every
where trembling, clearly shows their changes by innumerable beatings or
leapings.

As to what respects the Humors, whereby all the fibers of a Muscle, viz. the
fleshy, tendinous, and membranaceous, and what lies between them, seem to be
watered, filled, or blown up, we ought to take notice of them, at least two of
them, (to wit, the bloody and nervous liquor) if not more. And in the first
place it is clearly manifest to the sense, that the blood does wash all the
fleshy and membranaceous fibers which are interwoven with these: because, if
the Spirit of Wine, tinctured with Ink, be put into an Artery belonging to any
Muscle, the Vein in the mean time being tied close, the superficies of all the
fleshy fibers and transverse fibrils are dyed with blackness, the Tendons being
then scarcely at all changed in their color; it appears from hence, that the
blood does every where outwardly water all the flesh or fleshy fibers, and only
those. We have not yet found by any certain mark, whether the blood enters more
deeply the fleshy fibers, or instills into them the subtle liquor falling from
them, although this last seems most probable; but indeed we affirm, that all
the fibers, viz. the fleshy, tendinous, and membranaceous, are perpetually and
plentifully actuated by the implanted and inflowing animal Spirits, and
constantly imbued with the nervous liquor, which is the Vehicle of the Spirits.
But how far, or how much the aforesaid humors conduce to the exercise of the
animal Faculties, does not easily appear; but because the animal Spirits cannot
consist without the nervous liquor, and depend very much upon its disposition,
we may conclude, that it does serve something to the actuating the motive
power; for that reason also, that the continual afflux of the blood is
nevertheless necessary, an Experiment cited by the Ingenious Steno, and proved
of late by others, plainly confirms. He has observed, that in a living Dog,
the descending great Artery being tied without any previous cutting off, the
voluntary motion of all the posterior parts have ceased, as often as he tied
the string, and as often returned again as he loosned the knot.

These are the chief Phenomenon to be observed concerning the frame and action
of a Muscle in the dissection of Animals, both of such as were living, as also
of the dead and dying. From which, however placed together and compared among
themselves, how difficult a thing it is to constitute the Aetiology of the
animal motive faculty, appears even from hence, that the most Ingenious Steno,
after he had very accurately delivered the Elements of his Myology, by himself
first invented, nevertheless he wholly avoided that Hypothesis which might be
founded out of them; for that he yet doubted, whether the explication of a
Muscle by a Rectangle were convenient to Nature in all; wherefore when many run
to the manner of musculary Contraction, by the repletion of the fibers, and
others from their inanition, and some to both, he ingenuously professes, that
the true causes of this thing do not clearly appear to him.

And as to this abstruse matter, although I do not believe that I am able to
bring to light, or show any thing more certainly than others; yet as in
mechanical things, when any one would observe the motions of a Clock or Engine,
he takes the Machine it self to pieces to consider the singular artifice, and
does not doubt but he will learn the causes and properties of the Phenomenon,
if not all, at least the chief: In like manner, when it is brought before your
eyes to behold and consider the structure and parts of a Muscle, the
conformations of the moving fibers, their gests and alterations whilst they are
in motion, why is it that we should despair to extricate the means or reasons
of the motive function, either by truths or by what is next to truth? Wherefore
I think it may be lawful for me here to bring before you our conceptions and
notions concerning this thing, indeed not rashly taken, or to comply with our
former Hypothesis, or to oppose any other; which if they shall not satisfy
all, may at least excite others to find out better.

But we shall here repeat what we have mentioned before, viz. that the power or
virtue by which a Muscle is moved, proceeds from the Brain, is conveyed through
the Nerves, and is performed by the fleshy fibers contracted, and by that means
abbreviated. This latter is proved by ocular demonstration, yea it appears by
it, that the motive force does depend also upon those former, and is so
transferred by a long passage, that the influence of the Spirits being
suppressed in their beginning, or intercepted in the way, for that reason the
exercise of the designed motion may be hindered. Further we notify, that the
motive force is far greater in the Muscle, or in the end, than in the beginning
or middle: because the Brain and depending Nerves are made of a tender and
fragil substance, and can pull or draw nothing strongly; but the Muscle putting
forth strongly its contractive force, seems almost to be equal to the strength
of a Post or Crow, or of a Pully or Windlace. Sometimes the local motion is a
compound Action to be performed of many Organs, which consist in diverse places,
and as its virtue is far more strong in the end than in the beginning or way,
we will inquire by what means, as it were mechanical, the motive force may be
so augmented or multiplied in its progress, then what is brought to the motion
from the several Organs.

As to the first, in Artificial things, when for the facilitating of motion,
and the increasing the moving force, many Instruments are invented, all of
them, or at least the chief, may be reduced to these two Heads, viz. first,
either the same force or impression may be continued, without the addition of
any new force, from one term or end to the other, or from the first mover to
the thing moved, which notwithstanding may be much increased in the way, as the
Centers of Gravity are farther off or multiplied; for the farther the motion is
begun from the first Center of Gravity, the stronger it proceeds, as is beheld
in a Crow or Leaver, and in other things reducible to a Leaver. Then if other
things be disposed beyond the first Center of Gravity successively before the
end of the motion, as in a circular Wheel, the same motive force is wont to be
increased very much. But to this there is required, that the instruments of
motion be sufficiently strong and tenacious in their whole tract; for otherwise
the motive force being increased, the same breaking falls down before the
designed action be performed. Secondly, there is another way of multiplying the
motive force to a great degree, and also at a great distance, which is
performed with the addition of new forces or of fresh supplies, to wit, when
the elastick Particles, or those making the force, being disposed and shut up
in private places, as it were little Cells, afterward, as occasion serves, are
sent forth by a light contact or blast of a remote Agent, into the liberty of
motion, which they readily perform. By this means, Air compacted and shut up,
when it is permitted to get out, impetuously forcing a Bullet or other object,
sends or drives it out a great way. It is sufficiently known what mighty and
often horrid forces Gunpowder yields about the end of the Explosion, when in
the beginning or first inkindling, the force being transmitted through the
fiery fume, as yet weak, might be restrained by a light impression of the hand.
There are also other explosive little bodies of a various kind, which being hid
in convenient Boxes or Cells, when they are raised up into motion by an
inkindling, or irritament, or provocative, do often exert an incredible force.
It behooves us then to inquire from which of these ways it comes to pass, that
the motive force does in the Muscles so far exceed the force transmitted from
the Brain through the Nerves, or whether the action of the Musculary Motion be
merely contractive, or rather elastick, or in some measure explosive?

Concerning these things it manifestly appears, that the Muscles do draw, to
wit, being abbreviated, do bring the Tendon with the hanging part toward it
self. Further, for as much as there is need for the offices of traction to be
sometimes more strongly, sometimes more weakly performed by them, so to have
the Centers of Gravity now nigher, now farther off planted from the beginning
of the motion; hence the Muscles which extend or bend the Thigh, especially the
Psoae and Glutaei (great Muscles beginning in the Breast, and reaching into the
Thigh) do hide their fleshy moving fibers deeply within the Trunk of the Body:
but those which turn about the Thigh are constituted either near the hole or
the rising of the Bone of the Thigh, or somewhere thereabout; in like manner it
is observed in all the rest of the members, that the belly of the Muscle gets a
more remote or nearer site from the article or hinge of motion, as it designed
for performing either a stronger or weaker motion: But truly this does not hold
as to the other moving parts, to wit, the Brain and Nerves, which cooperate
with the Muscles in the motive Act; because, although the motive force is
carried by a long passage through all these Organs, yet it seems impossible,
that a contraction so strongly performed by a Muscle, should be begun by the
tender and immovable Brain, and continued through the small and fragil Nerves,
but that it must necessarily be supposed some motive Particles are hid in the
Muscle, which, as occasion is given, are stirred up according to the Instinct,
delivered by the Nerves from the Brain, into motion, as it were with a certain
explosion. But what these Particles may be, by what means they are instigated
into motion, and how they induce the contraction of a Muscle, seems most
difficult to be unfolded.

Truly it may be lawfully concluded from the effect, that elastick Particles,
and fit to move themselves, are contained in the Muscles, and hid every where
within the fibers, because the Anatomy of living Creatures discovers often a
motion in a separated Muscle, yea in its fibers divided one from another. The
Hearts of some Animals beat a long while being pulled out of the Body, the
Muscles cut off, sometimes perform the motions of contraction. In great
laboring Beasts slain or dying, although the Heart and the Brain be taken out,
the fleshy Pannicle performs for some time very many turns of contractions and
relaxations. From these it is manifestly clear, that there are among the
Particles of the Muscles some agil and self forcers, or carried by their own
force heaped together, which, although the animal economy be very much
disturbed or overthrown, do enter into motion of their own accord, yet in a
tranquil estate they perform no actions, unless commanded by the Brain or
Cerebel, and delivered by the Nerves.

Whilst a Muscle is contracted, the cutting up of a live Creature shows only
the fleshy fibers to run into motion by themselves, to wit, being made more
tumid, sharper, and shorter at the same time, to amplify or enlarge the belly
of the Muscle, and in the interim, the Tendons, as if immovable of themselves,
to wit, not altered either as to their thickness or length, only pulled as it
were by the fleshy fibers, to be moved, and to draw with them the moved part;
whence it seems to be manifest, that the animal Spirits or elastick Particles,
which soever they are, whilst they perform the Musculary Motion, are only or
chiefly agitated among the fleshy fibers. Further, hence any one may strongly
think, that such Particles are not at all contained, or are wholly idle in the
tendinous fibers; for as we have noted, that the Tendon is not changed in the
act, we may lawfully suspect, that it is only instead of a Crook, by which
means the fleshy fibers being contracted, may draw the member to be moved at a
distance from them toward themselves.

But indeed it sufficiently appears by evident signs, that the animal Spirits
or elastick Particles do lodge within the tendinous fibers, and truly much more
plentifully than in the fleshy: First, the sense shows this, to wit, the touch,
which is much sharper and far more sensible in the Tendon than in the flesh:
yea any irritation or breach of the unity happening in that part, brings not
only a most troublesome sense, to wit, a very cruel pain, but besides, is wont
to excite in the neighboring flesh a Tumor or Swelling, and frequently most
grievous Convulsions; whence we necessarily conclude, that the animal Spirits
do inhabit the tendinous fibers in great abundance: but what they do there, and
by what means they serve to the motive function, we will next inquire.

As often as the motion of a living Muscle was beheld by me, I considered and
weighed in my mind by what means all the fleshy fibers were contracted and
released by turns, I could conceive or collect no other thing than that in
every contraction, the Spirits or certain elastick Particles did rush into the
fleshy fibers from either Tendon, and did intumifie and force them nearer
toward themselves or together; then the same Particles presently coming back
from the flesh into the Tendons, the relaxation of the Muscles happened. In a
bare or naked Muscle, when I had separated every fleshy fiber or a company of
them apart from the rest in the whole passage by help of a Microscope, I most
plainly perceived the Tumor, begun at either end of the flesh, to be carried
toward the middle, as it were by the Spirits, entered here and there at once.
Further (which I mentioned before) each fiber being tied about the middle,
being as it were as yet free and compacted with the others, was contracted or
drawn together; but a Ligature being put to both ends, it remained flaggy
constantly above or beyond the bound place. But that I might no longer doubt
concerning this, I applied two Ligatures, at equal distances from the middle
and the ends, about the same bundle of fleshy fibers, which being done, a
contraction and swelling up arising presently from either fleshy extreme to the
places bound, went no farther; the middle part between in the mean time being
unmoved, remained flaccid; whence it may be well concluded, that in every
musculary contraction the animal Spirits or elastick Particles do leap out from
the tendinous fibers into the fleshy, and vicissively in the relaxation, recede
or run back from these into those.

However this being proved and granted, there yet remain very many difficulties
concerning Musculary Motion; for first, it may be asked how the animal Spirits,
which enter silently, or without any incitation, or Tumor, the tendinous fibers
do so blow up the fleshy fibers, that they are able to force them altogether
into shorter spaces.

For the producing this effect, plenty of Spirits leaping from the tendinous
fibers, do not seem alone sufficient; but besides, we may suppose some other
kind of Particles, implanted in the fleshy fibers, meeting with the others
flowing from the Tendons, do forthwith strive, whence a mutual rarefaction, and
turgescency or swelling up of them, or an inflation or sudden blowing up of the
containing bodies, together with an abbreviation or shortning of them, does
arise; not much unlike, as when the Corpuscles or little bodies of fire entering
into a piece of leather, or any thing, and forcing variously here and there its
implanted Particles (whereby they are presently ensnared) make it so to be
stuffed and wrinkled; in like manner also the animal Spirits, although they
pass through the Tendons, where they are solitary or by themselves, without
moving them (as the Effluvia's of heat in Metals or more dry bodies) yet being
dilated in the flesh, for that there joining with elastick Particles of another
kind, they are expanded or stretched out, they cause the sudden inflations and
corrugations of the containing fibers. But we have elsewhere shown, that such
Particles diverse and wholly heterogene to the nature of the Spirits, may be
copiously and easily carried to the Muscles. For indeed it is plain by ocular
demonstration, that the blood does every where wash and water outwardly all the
fleshy fibers, which besides, it is thought not only to nourish, but also to be
busied about the offices of the animal Function: and what can be less
suspected, than that it does instill into their Pipes a certain subtle liquor,
whose Particles being agitated, and also rarefied by the Spirits flowing
therein, stuff up the fibers, (as we but now hinted) and compel them
intumified, by reason of the assault on either side made, into shorter spaces?

But that the fleshy belly of the Muscle, whilst it is contracted, does swell
up, is not at all to be doubted, because this is evidently beheld by the sight
and touch in the diffection of living Creatures: to wit, all the fleshy fibers
being wrinkled together, are made more tumid and sharper, and so shorten the
Muscle, and make it also thicker and broader: For the more certain belief of
this, when I had bound some of the fleshy fibers, separated from the knitting
of the rest, and had left others near them loose, there appeared a notable
difference between those flaccid or not swelled, and these intumified or
swelled up in every contraction of the Muscle.

But if it be demanded, of what nature, to wit, whether spirituous saline, as
may be believed, or of any other disposition, the animal Spirits, derived from
the Brain into the Muscles, may be; and then whether the other Latex,
immediately carried to them from the blood, is sulphurous or nitrous.
Concerning these, because it appears not to the sense, we shall pronounce
nothing rashly or positively. But even as in other natural things, the active
Particles of a various kind, which being unlike among themselves, are found apt
mutually to grow hot, or to be struck off from one another, or otherwise to be
rarefied or expanded; and as the intestine motions of Bodies, and especially
the elastick, such as are the contractions of the Muscles, can only proceed
from the congressions of such like, certainly it may be lawful to presume, that
these do wholly depend upon such a cause.

Therefore as to the Musculary Motion in general, we shall conclude after this
manner, with a sufficiently probable conjecture, viz. that the animal Spirits
being brought from the Head by the passage of the Nerves to every Muscle, and
(as it is very likely) received from the membranaceous fibrils, are carried by
their passage into the tendinous fibers, and there they are plentifully laid up
as in fit Storehouses; which Spirits, as they are naturally nimble and
elastick, where ever they may, and are permitted, expanding themselves, leap
into the fleshy fibers; then the force being finished, presently sinking down,
they slide back into the Tendons, and so vicissively. But whilst the same
animal Spirits, at the instinct given for the performing of motion, do leap out
of the tendinous fibers into the fleshy, they meet there with active Particles
of another nature, supplied from the blood, and presently they grow mutually
hot; so that by the strife and agitation of both, the fleshy fibers, for that
they are lax and porous, are stuffed up and driven into wrinklings, from all
which being at once wrinkled or shrivelled up, the contraction of the whole
Muscle proceeds; the contraction being finished, the sincere or clear Spirits,
which reside or are assuaged, go back for the most part into the tendinous
fibers, the other Particles being left within the flesh; the loss or wasting of
these the blood supplies, as the Nerves do those. By what instinct the
musculary contraction begins and ends, shall be inquired into presently.

That the animal Spirits, flowing from the tendinous Fibers, may enter equally
all the fleshy, there are two Tendons in every simple Muscle, which are so
constituted, according to opposite Angles, that the Spirits running to them
from a twofold starting place or bound, might presently fill the whole belly of
the Muscle, and that motion being finished, might immediately swiftly retire.
If the contraction ought to be performed indifferently toward the middle of
the flesh, the Tendons for the most part are equal; but if the motion inclines
more toward one region of the flesh, one Tendon (to wit, which may supply a
greater company of Spirits) exceeds the other in magnitude. If the Muscle,
whereby it may be the stronger, is big and endued with an ample bulk or
substance, it is divided as it were into many Lobes or Bellies, and two Tendons
are ordained to each of them; to wit, to the end that the animal Spirits might
be carried through short passages from the Tendons into the fleshy fibers, and
might leap back again: because the compounded Muscle does not always contain
more series of moving fibers, that it might perform many and diverse motions,
but that it might make the same motion often with the greater strength. For, as
we hinted before, as a simple Muscle was as a single leaver or bar, the
compound seems as if it were many leavers or bars serving for the removing the
same body conjunctly.

Further, hence we may observe in some Muscles, which are simple and regular,
that all the fleshy fibers are equal, and so all the tendinous of one extreme
being put together, are equal to all of the other end being put together; yet
they single, where they are shorter in one Tendon, are longer in the other, and
so disposed, that the tendinous fibers on either part, the top and bottom, have
their excesses inverse, and at once equal; to wit, that here a long is laid
upon a short, or the longest upon the shortest, and there quite contrary; the
shortest upon the longest, to the end, that the motion might be so made every
where in this or that side of the Muscle, or at the end more strong, more
plentiful Spirits flow together into those parts from the longer tendinous
fibers, and on the contrary: wherefore in some Muscles less necessary, where
the part of the flesh growing to the bone, either becomes immovable, or only
serves for the filling up of empty spaces, one Tendon is shorter or lesser, and
oftentimes degenerates into a bony or cartilaginous hardness. Further it is
observed, as to other strong and greatly moving Muscles, that their Tendons are
not so disposed, as if they were only stays, props, handles, or hanging crooks
of the fleshy fibers; for so they are only constituted in their extreme ends;
yet the tendinous fibers, that they may be made more apt promptuaries of the
animal Spirits, being stretched out almost into all parts of the Muscle,
receive every where both ends of the fleshy; which indeed yet more manifestly
appears in the compound Muscles, for that one Tendon being compounded, embraces
the extreme flesh, and the other enters into the middle of the flesh, as has
been already shown.

But truly the animal Spirits, whilst they leap out of the tendinous into the
fleshy fibers, are not sufficient of themselves for the wrinkling of them, but
require another elastick Copula from the blood; this may be argued from many
reasons. First, it seems to appear from this, that the same Spirits being
solitary or by themselves, though most thickly planted within the Tendons, stir
up no Tumor or Contraction whilst they are moved in them; wherefore being
dilated within the fleshy fibers in a lesser quantity, and having got a larger
space, they would be stretched out, unless they met or strove with other
Particles, much less would they obtain a contractive force. Besides, when any
wound or grievous trouble happens to a Tendon, the belly of the Muscle or
fleshy part is chiefly troubled with a Tumor or Spasm; for the Spirits being
irritated, not so much within themselves, but where they are violently driven
among heterogene Particles, stir up the greatest tumults and inordinations. But
further, when the fleshy fibers are watered with the sanguineous humor beyond
other parts, and more than may suffice for their nourishment, for what other
use should it be assigned, unless that it may contribute to the motive
function? Especially we take notice in lean Bodies, which are more sparingly
nourished, that the Muscles being fused or drenched with more plentiful blood,
do perform the strongest endeavors of motions: moreover, it does not appear by
what way besides, the expense of the Spirits in a Muscle, consumed with
continual hard motions or labors, should be made up or renewed, unless,
besides the small supplements by the Nerves, others sufficiently plentiful
should be supplied from the bloody mass. Add to these, that members destitute
of the wonted afflux of blood, easily fall into weakness or a Palsy; and that
from the observation of Doctor Steno, in a live Dog the trunk of the descending
Artery being tied, all the lower or posterior members were suddenly deprived of
motion. And though it does not yet appear plainly to me, whether the exclusion
of the blood from the spinal Marrow, or from the Muscles themselves, or from
both together, be the cause; yet however it comes almost to the same thing, for
as much as the animal Spirits being procreated within the Head, and stretched
out by the medullary and nervous Appendices into every member, without the
concourse of the blood, they should not be able to perform the loco-motive
power.

Having thus far explained by what means a Muscle being contracted in the
fleshy part, as to all the fibers at once, performs the motive function; we
shall next inquire, what is the reason of the Instinct whereby every motion,
both regular and irregular, is wont to be obeyed or is performed. Concerning
this in general, it first appears, that the motions of every regular motion,
yea and the impulses of some irregular motions being conceived within the Brain
or Cerebel, are transmitted from thence by the Nerves to every Muscle. This (as
we have elsewhere shown) is most evidently declared by the effects and
consequences: yet here great difficulties remain, to wit, how by the same
passages fresh forces of animal Spirits are conveyed from the Head to every
Muscle, and at the same time the old ones exercising the Empire of the Soul;
besides, with what difference and diverse carriage of the inflowing Spirits, the
Nerves perform either of these tasks, or both these offices.

Of these, as I conjecture, it seems that the animal Spirits, which flowing
continually from the Head to refresh the forces of the implanted Spirits, are
carried to the Muscle by the Nerves, do move to it quietly and easily, and
being there presently received by the membranaceous Fibers, they go apart into
the Tendons: which kind of relief, although it should be but little in bulk,
yet because it is carried night and day by a constant course, it easily arises
to a sufficient provision for the continual filling up of the Tendons. But that
we suppose, the Spirits so brought perpetually to the Muscle to be transferred
by the membranaceous Fibers, and not by the fleshy, to the Tendons, the reason
is, because if they should first enter into these, straight running into an
elastick Copula, they would stir up the Muscle into continual motions: more
over, for that in the Heart and Muscles of Respiration the fleshy Fibers are
exercised with a perpetual motion, they wait not for the passage of fresh
Spirits to the Tendons.

But as to what respects the Instincts delivered through the Nerves from the
Head for the performing, or staying, or any ways altering of the musculary
motion, of these we ought first to consider, that the moving animal Spirits,
whose companies or throngs constitute the Hypostasis of the bodily Soul, have
these two properties as it were implanted in their nature; to wit, that whilst
they are lively, numerous, and free, they exert or expand themselves, then that
force being finished, they being a little diminished, retire themselves and
grow quiet; but afterward being refreshed, they leap out again, and so
vicissively. Waking and sleep, and the alterations of work and idleness or
rest, inbred in all living Creatures, sufficiently declare this. Wherefore to
the impulse or instincts of some Muscles, (which are wont to be perpetually
contracted and released) scarce any thing more is required, but that their
Tendons may be supplied by the Nerves with a constant influx of animal Spirits;
but the Spirits themselves, because they are numerous and expeditious of their
own nature, do willingly leap out into the moving Fibers, then the charge being
performed, after a small loss or expense, they immediately withdraw, and being
again presently recruited, they are again expanded, and so vicissively.
Further, their actions (which chiefly are Pulse and Breathing) are variously
changed according to the degrees of heat or of the affections, for as much as
the Spirits being brought by the Nerves, are sent from the Cerebel, sometimes
more remisly, sometimes more plentifully, or more nimbly.

Further, in some other Muscles subject to the Empire of the Appetite, as the
animal Spirits naturally affect turns of expansion and recess, there is only
need of a sign to be given, either for the performing or stopping of the
commanded motion; either of which, the inflowing Spirits by their various
knocking against the Muscle, easily perform, in ordering the implanted Spirits
into various aspects or tendencies. When the Muscle is contracted, the
implanted Spirits, whilst they are loosned from either end toward the middle,
look and tend with a changed front from the middle toward either end. And so,
whilst the inflowing Spirits carry the Symbol of performing Contraction, they
being incited by heaps within the Nerve, more fully blow up its end, inserted
to the Muscle, (where they are more thickly crowded together) and so cause it
there to be contracted and abbreviated; whereby it comes to pass, that the same
inflowing Spirits, about to enter into the Muscle, are at that time stopped by
a mere heap, or rather are called back toward the intumified Nerve; wherefore
by and by the whole series of the implanted Spirits (hence their inclination
being changed) also looks that way, and so the inhabitants of the Tendons,
leaping out from their little Cells into the fleshy Fibers, cause motive
contraction: then the motion is broken off or ceases as soon as the Spirits
being before called back toward the Nerve, do tend again into the Muscle, and
so the front of the Army being again changed, bands of the implanted Spirits
are presently compelled into the Tendons. That the thing is in a manner thus, I
am persuaded, not out of a mere agreeableness or concinnity of our Hypothesis,
but from Anatomical observation. Because once dissecting a Whelp alive, when by
chance I beheld some Muscles of the hinder part of the Head and Neck divided
and separated at the same instant, wherein the fleshy Fibers, as also the
Nerves inserted into them, were seen at once to be contracted, and being
intumified, to be abbreviated.

For the promoting the recess of the Spirits out of the fleshy Fibers into the
Tendons, whilst the Muscle is contracted, the membranaceous Fibrils, which
every where cut cross-wise the fleshy, and thickly stick between, seem to help.
The texture of these never to be enough admired, is better perceived in a
Muscle endued with large Fibers, viz. an Oxes being boiled to a tenderness. For
in such a one, if gently opening the fleshy Fibers, you shall draw them one
from another through the whole series, you shall see little Fibrils, like
hairs, most thickly extended upon every one of those Tubes, which little
Fibrils not only close and knit together the fleshy Fibers, but also lying upon
every one of their series, and cutting them in oblique Angles, they also are
all carried parallel, from Tendon to Tendon, in an opposite site to the fleshy:
therefore whilst the Muscle being contracted, the fleshy Fibers do swell up,
the Fibrils embracing them, that they may give place, are somewhat distended;
then as soon as the swelling up remits, these returning to their wonted
straitness, press together every where the flesh, and the Spirits being
expulsed on either side, they reduce them to their pristine length. It makes
for this, that whilst the Muscle is contracted, the Spirits inflowing through
the Nerves, depart from their membranaceous Fibrils; wherefore these being
empty and lax, are able more easily to be distended; but whilst the Muscle is
relaxed, the Spirits again entering the Fibrils, fill them, and that they may
the better bind the fleshy Fibers, they make them shorter.

The Instincts of Motions, to be obeyed by the Muscles, so delivered by the
Nerves, are, being sent either from the Brain, performed at the command, and
with the knowledge of the Appetite; or from the Cerebel, according to the Laws
of Nature, for the most part unknown to us. But besides, sometimes the Muscles
are carried beyond, or contrary to the pleasure of the Appetite or Nature, into
irregular motions, viz. violent and convulsive, and that happens after various
manners and for diverse causes. Concerning these, some time since discoursing
more largely, we have shown, that from thence do arise many kinds and
differences of convulsive motions; as the Spasmodick matter being somewhere
fixed, does subsist either about the beginnings, middle, or ends of the Nerves;
or because the same thing being wandering and loose, runs about here and there
through the whole passages of the Nerves, and so variously transfers from place
to place convulsive distempers. But besides these diverse kinds of Convulsions,
which are excited by reason of some evil or vice sticking somewhere to the
Nerves themselves, this our Myology or Doctrine of the Muscles, has discovered
some Convulsions of another kind arising from the Muscles being chiefly
affected.

For indeed we must advertise you, that the animal Spirits, disposed among the
Muscles themselves, by reason of a taint or evil derived from the Brain, or
from the Blood, or perhaps oftentimes from both together, are infected with
certain heterogene Particles, by reason of which they cannot rest or lie quiet
in their Cells; but being always unquiet and restless, leap out of their own
accord from the tendinous Fibers into the fleshy, and so oftentimes produce
frequent and cruel Convulsions. But this we have observed to be done after a
twofold manner, viz. first, for that the Spirits being burdened with an
elastick Copula, remain not long within the Tendons, but leaping out from
thence into the fleshy Fibers, induce frequent Convulsions of a Muscle, but
short, and as it were by leaps; or secondly, because the animal Spirits,
although they sometimes lie quietly within the Tendons, yet being inordinately
snatched into the flesh, and there cruelly exploded, they cannot be presently
repressed, brought into order, or reduced into the Tendons, but whether we will
or not, they persist a long while expanded, and so bring forth a long and very
painful contraction of the Muscle. Which kind of Spasm, sufficiently known, we
vulgarly term the Cramp.

The former distemper (called the Convulsive Leaping) is familiar both to
malignant Fevers, and to the Scurvy. As to those, we have ordinarily known,
when either no Crisis, or an evil one is obtained, that heterogene Particles
from the blood and nervous juice very much vitiated, are not only laid up in
the Bowels, (whose dispositions and functions they pervert) but almost every
where in the Muscles; and there growing to the Spirits, do affect them with a
certain madness, so as they cannot continue peaceably together, or rest within
the Tendons, but being divided and distracted one from another, leap out from
thence by bands into the flesh, and there stir up the lesser and most frequent
Spasms or Convulsions. In like manner, by reason of the Spirits inhabiting the
Muscles, being burdened with an elastick Copula there growing to them, some
laboring with an inveterate Scurvy, cannot contain their limbs in the same
site or position, but are necessitated sometimes to extend the hands or feet,
sometimes to fling them about here and there, to transfer them variously, and
sometimes to subdue their madness by running, leaping, or other hard labors.

Treating some time since of Convulsive Motions, we did almost wholly omit the
Aetiology of the continuing Spasm or Tetanism, as a thing which depended upon
the Doctrine of the Muscles, to be treated of afterward: Then we only hinted,
that the contraction of that kind did arise in one Muscle, because its other
Antagonist was resolved or loosned, which indeed oftentimes happens in the face
and some members; in which, whilst the parts upon one side are troubled with
the Palsy, those opposite on the other, as it were loosned in the Reins, are
too much contracted. Notwithstanding this kind of Spasm for the most part is
without pain; besides, this is not easily or presently passed over or cured no
more than the Palsy, which is the cause of it.

Therefore as to what belongs to the formal reason of the Spasm, called in our
Idiom the Cramp; every one laboring with this distemper, perceives in himself
one or more Muscles to be most strongly and involuntarily drawn together, and
they being for some time so highly distended, remain as it were stiff; and in
the mean time, for that the fleshy Fibers being cruelly contracted, do
violently haul or pull either Tendon, to wit, that which is fixed to the
immovable part, perhaps no less than the other part to be moved, they cause a
most troublesome pain. But sometimes this Spasm being excited, by reason of the
animal Spirits carrying themselves out impetuously into the fleshy Fibers, does
not cease until the same Spirits being returned into the Tendons, suffer the
flesh to be relaxed; therefore its nearest causes will be both the greater
impetuosity of the animal Spirits among the fleshy Fibers, with which they leap
thither unbid; and also their long continuance or stay, for that they return
back more slowly and difficultly into the Tendons. For the secondary causes may
be reckoned, both the evil disposition of the animal Spirits, and also the evil
conformation of the Tendons, viz. sometimes this, sometimes that, and not
seldom both together.

As to the former; this distemper, as other Convulsions, seems to arise, for as
much as the animal Spirits, being burdened with heterogeneous Particles or an
elastick Copula, at length being irritated, they are incited to the striking of
it off: which notwithstanding, being thick and viscous, and for that cause more
tenacious, is not soon nor easily shaken off, but that the Spirits being still
provoked by the same, and shut up within the fleshy Fibers, are longer detained
in the expansion: which thing perhaps happens not so much unlike, as when water
and air being joined together, make a bubble; which, if it be made of water,
wherein a little Soap is put, is more tenacious, much more large, and continues
longer than that made only of mere water. So we observe, that they who abound
in thick and tartareous humors, are most obnoxious to these kind of Cramps,
and besides, that they who presently sleep upon drinking or eating gross meats,
after full eating, and especially after a large and plentiful supper, do suffer
most cruel assaults of this disease; but sometimes the Tendons themselves are
found to be in the fault, for that they being too hard bound together or
obstructed, they do not easily admit the Spirits returning from the fleshy
Fibers. The obstruction of the Tendons is the cause, that Gouty and Scorbutic
people, whose Tendons salt and tartareous humors easily run into and obstruct,
are wont to be cruelly tormented with these kind of painful Cramps: But that
the constriction of the Tendons does sometimes bring forth this disease,
appears by this, for that some Women with Child, (as I have been often told)
about the latter end of their Time, by reason of the Muscles of the Abdomen
being too much extended, are wont to be troubled with frequent Cramps, only in
the bottom of their Bellies. For the illustrating of this Pathology we will add
this following Case.

A Noble Woman, young and fair, some time since obnoxious to Hysteric
distempers, and now above two years ago to Convulsive, and in a manner
Epileptical; of late, by reason of the frequent and most cruel assaults of the
disease, she became also Cachectical and Paralytical, that at length her
Abdomen was distempered with an Ascites, and her Legs with a waterish Tumor,
and lastly, all her lower parts, below her Hips, were deprived of motion;
hence, as often as the Convulsive fits infested her, she was wont, not now to
move her body or members here and there, but sometimes these, sometimes those
parts being snatched with the Tetanism, were variously bent and twisted about,
that in the mean time, she her self sitting in her Bed or Chair, remained stiff
and almost immovable. It is not long since, that seeing the whole manner of
one of these Fits, I observed, not without great admiration, diverse sorts of
turns and changes of alterations of the Spasms. At the first assault, her eyes
being turned about swiftly hither and thither, she was presently taken with
insensibility, then by and by her head being turned and contracted of one side,
presently her arms and legs at once became stiff, and all her Joints, sometimes
of one side, sometimes of both, were bowed or stretched out: perhaps after four
or five minutes these Spasms both in her Head and Limbs remitting, of a sudden
others, for the most part opposite, followed; which being often finished in the
like space, others far different did arise, and so for two or three hours,
longer Spasms almost of every kind and fashion; being excited through her whole
Body, followed upon one another; so that her head being convulsed or pulled by
turns from the right to the left, and contracted before and behind, yea and all
her Limbs being bent inwardly here and there, or distended outwardly in the
Course of one Fit, she exhibited all sorts of Convulsive gestures. When at any
time the Spasms of one sort continued longer in the Head or Limbs than usual,
it was the custom of the Servants about her to blow up strongly into her
Nostrils the Fume of Tabaco; which being done, as the Spirits recovered within,
the present Spasms immediately remitted, but upon them others of a new kind
succeeded. Of late the Legs of this Lady were so debilitated by being loosned,
that she could neither go nor stand, yea her Tendons under either Ham, being
made tumid and shorter, were so contracted, that she could not stretch out her
Legs straight.

Concerning the case of this sick Noble Lady, it may be demanded, wherefore
upon the first coming of the Fit, no throwing about of the Body or Limbs, as is
wont in most Convulsive or Epileptical people, but only continued Spasms or
Convulsions variously translated from one part to another, and so others, did
arise? For the solution of this, we say, that the Spasmodick matter is not only
heaped up in the Brain and Nerves, but also in the Muscles themselves, and
grows to the Spirits inhabiting the Tendons: And as that matter is tenacious,
and the Spirits weak, and unable for the striking off quickly or easily such a
Copula; therefore as often as these being irritated, do leap out of the Tendons
into the flesh, the Muscles being first possessed, they cause strong and long
Contractions; in the mean time, other Muscles, especially their Antagonists or
opposites, being hindered and bound up from motion, until the Convulsions of the
former are remitted; hence the Members, however convulsed, are not moved out of
their place, because the moving or carrying of the Body, or any Members, is not
performed but by the help or duty of many Muscles, whilst some of them either
rightly cooperate with others, or at least obey them, to wit, so that some
respective Muscles, observing due cooperation, are contracted at once, then
those being loosned, the contraction of others immediately succeeds. But if
they which are unequal and unlike, are at once contracted and strongly
convulsed, and so continue long, so that other Muscles in the mean time cannot
be contracted, there will be a necessity for the members bent or extended here
and there, to remain as they are wholly stiff. But that the present Convulsions
were always remitted by the blowing the smoke of Tabaco up her Nose, the reason
is, because the region or some part of the bodily Soul being vehemently
affected, if by chance a new passion equally violent be brought upon another
part, the first is presently abolished or ceases: For in truth, it appears by
constant observation, wherever the greater or fresher trouble is, that
thither greater plenty of Spirits presently flock and make a tumult: wherefore
any new irritation being excited in the Brain or its Meninges, whatsoever
others were begun outwardly among the Muscles, immediately vanish or are
obscured; then as soon as this fresh trouble is passed over, Convulsions
outwardly arise forthwith again, but in other parts where more heaps of
Spasmodick matter lie not yet consumed. But that long continued Spasms do
arise, either by reason of the Spirits being burdened with a more tenacious
Copula, or by reason of the Tendons being obstructed with a viscous or
tartareous matter from either or both, it appears from hence, because this
disease increasing (as in the case of this Noble Lady) the Tendons are at
length so shortened by the more plentiful heaping up of the morbifick matter,
that they become stiff and shorter, and for that reason they hardly or not at
all grant any place to the Spirits for the constant performing of the motive
function.

Thus much for the Musculary Motion, both natural and convulsive, and the
reasons of both, which we have proved with what diligence we were able, and by
Anatomical Experiments: But if any one shall object, that they are not very
firm, because we have noted in the cutting up of live Creatures, that the Heart
and Muscles of Respiration and the fleshy Pannicle, after that the Nerves and
Arteries are cut away, do continue for some time their turns of Contraction and
Relaxation, whence it is argued, against our Hypothesis, that their motions do
not depend upon the constant influx of the blood and animal Spirits; it will be
plain to return this Answer, That in those about to dye, it sometimes happens
so, because the Soul being then distracted and drawing near to dissolution, all
the implanted Spirits at once being cut off from the commerce of those
influencing or flowing in, do of their own accord exert themselves, and perform
(as long as they are able) their wonted motions; which being continued for a
little space only, need not the subsidy or assistance of fresh forces, because
the veterane, till they are quite worn out, perform their wonted tasks; yea
also the old sanguineous Copula, till it be wholly consumed, receives and lets
go their embraces with a constant change: But this more rarely succeeds in
other Muscles subject to the Empire of the Appetite, and wont only to be
exercised as occasion served.

Moreover, as we have affirmed, that the Instinct for the performing of Motions
is brought altogether through the Nerves from the Head to the Muscle, and as
every Trunk of the same Nerve, being oftentimes broken into many shoots,
variously distributing them, sends it to many destinated Muscles, it may very
well be doubted, how the animal Spirits, conveying the Symbol of the motion to
be performed with a certain choice, do actuate only these or those branches
apart from other branches of the same, and do not indifferently enter all the
branches or shoots of the same; to wit, as the blood passes through the Trunk
of the Artery, and all its ramifications equally. The most Learned Regius, that
he might solve this knot, supposes in the Nerves some little doors, like to
those which are found in musical Organs, the apertures whereof admit the
Spirits to these or those parts especially, the rest being shut up. But he
ought to have shown, if not the little doors themselves, yet at least by what
instinct and by whose direction sometimes these, sometimes those are locked up,
and others opened. But in truth, this may rather be said, that all the shoots
of the Nerves and lesser branches remain distinct and singular among themselves
from the parts to which they are inserted, even to their beginnings; so that a
peculiar tract of the Spirits or way of passage lies open, from the Brain and
its medullary Appendix, to every Muscle and nervous part; for in truth,
although the Nerves, according to their beginnings, may seem to arise from the
greater Trunks; yet it will easily appear, if you shall open the trunk and
those branches, that in them many little Nerves, only like hairs, for the sake
of a better conduct, are collected together in the same bundle; yea, the
coverings being separated, you may follow oftentimes the little Nervulets, and
those single to the respective parts and members, to which they are destinated.

But in the mean time, although there be singular passages or channels of the
animal Spirits of most Nerves, distinct among themselves; yet some do variously
communicate with others through the branches and shoots sent on either side;
which indeed ought to be so made, that when many Nerves together, are required
to some motion of a Muscle equally, all these, by reason of the commerce
mutually had between themselves, might conspire in the same action; hence, in
some motions of the members, as in the striking of a Harp or Lute and other
complicated actions, many Muscles cooperate with admirable celerity; so that,
although many be employed at once, they perform their task severally without
any confusion. Besides, there is need for the Nerves to communicate mutually
among themselves, because of the Sympathetical motions of the members and of
some of the parts, for neither for any other cause is the Nerve of the
Diaphragma inserted into the brachial branches, or those belonging to the Arms,
than that the exercise of living Creatures, especially in running or flying,
might be proportionate to the tenor of Respiration. Hence it also proceeds,
that in any passion, the Praecordia being bound up or dilated, the countenance
and aspect of the face, yea and the gestures of the hands and members are
pathetically figured. We have proposed sufficient Instances of this sort in our
particular History of the Nerves, so that we need not here add any thing more.

What remains for the illustrating our Myology or Tract of the Muscles, we have
taken care to have added, viz. four Figures, which may represent to the life
both the exterior and interior true and natural faces or appearances both of
a simple and compounded Muscle.

The Explication of the Figures.
The First Figure
Shows a simple regular Muscle, described according to its natural appearance,
in the Belly of which the fleshy Fibers being opened, are diduced one from
another, that the membranaceous Fibrils may be the better beheld.

A. The right Tendon. B. The left opposite Tendon. C. The fleshy Belly; all the
fleshy Fibers of which lie one by another equal and parallel, but in even and
oblique Angles between either Tendon. D. The aperture of the fleshy Fibers,
which being drawn aside, the membranaceous Fibrils, thickly crossing them,
appear.
The Second Figure
Shows a simple Muscle cleft in the middle, after the Tendon being cut off, and
portions of it pulled away, that the interior series of the fleshy Fibers, or
their commixtures or mingling with the Tendons, may appear.

A A. The right Tendon being placed above, both portions of which divided, do
in some measure appear. B B. The left opposite Tendon placed below, either
portions of which divided, lie hid for the most part under the Flesh, those
toward the edges being only conspicuous. C D. Portions of the fleshy Belly
divided and separated, which before (this being laid upon that) did cohere, in
either of which all the fleshy Fibers proceed equally, and in like manner
obliquely from one Tendon to another. E. Some membranaceous Fibrils
represented, thickly crossing the fleshy Fibers.
The Third Figure
Exhibits a certain Muscle less compounded, to whose two fleshy Bellies two
compounded Tendons also (equal to four simple ones) are destinated.

A. The exterior compounded Tendon, embracing either side of the fleshy
Fibers, which being almost only conspicuous on the edges, lies hid for the most
part under the Flesh. B. The interior compounded Tendon, entering into the
middle of the Flesh, which receives on both sides the fleshy Fibers, sent from
either side of the exterior Tendon. C. The first Belly of the fleshy Fibers,
all whose equal and parallel Fibers lie between the opposite sides of the
Tendons in oblique Angles and equal. D. The second Belly of the fleshy Fibers,
all whose Fibers being in like manner formed, are beheld in the same as in the
other Belly. E E. Both extremities of the exterior compounded Tendon. F. The
extremity or end of the interior compounded Tendon, the like to the other
being opposite, at an equal distance from the end of the Muscle.
The Fourth Figure
Shows a regular compounded Muscle, divided and opened in the middle, so that
the interior face of either Belly may appear.

A. The exterior compounded Tendon cleft into four parts. B B. Portions of one
side of the divided Tendon separated from the other. C. Portions near sited, of
the other side of the divided Tendon, which for the greatest part lie hid under
the flesh. D D. The flesh of one Belly also divided, and separated one far from
another. E E. The flesh of the other Belly also divided, and placed near one
another. F. The interior compounded Tendon entering the middle of the Flesh. G
G. Portions of the same Tendon divided, and with portions of the Bellies, which
they receive, separated apart.
THE ANATOMY OF THE BRAIN.
The Authors Epistle Dedicatory to his Grace Gilbert Archbishop of Canterbury,
etc.
Most Honorable Prelate,
ONCE more your Sidley Professor and your Servant (the more happy Title) flings
himself at Your feet, with this only Ambition, that he might render something
of Thanks for Your Kindness and benefits, and that our Labors might choose such
a Patron, that might give Credit to the Author. But I fear, lest by my repeated
Duty I may seem troublesome, and no less in acknowledging Your Benefits, than
others in suing for them: But so great is my Gratitude, and so exceeding is
Your good Nature, that they cannot be crowded into a little compass, much less
wearied out or drawn dry.

But there is another Reason, which if it does not command what I do, may at
least excuse and defend it. For when I had resolved to unlock the secret places
of Man's Mind, and to look into the living and breathing Chapel of the Deity (as
far as our weakness was able) I thought it not lawful to make use of the
Favors and Patronage of a less Person, neither perhaps would it have become
me. For You indeed are He, who most happily presides (both by Merit and
Authority) over all our Temples and Sacred Things. Therefore after I had slain
so many Victims, whole Hecatombs almost of all Animals, in the Anatomical
Court, I could not have thought them rightly offered, unless they had been
brought to the most holy Altar of Your Grace.

I am not ignorant, how great the labor is that I undertake: For it has been
a long while accounted as a certain Mystery and School-house of Atheism to
search into Nature, as if whatever Reasons we grant to Philosophy, should
derogate from Religion, and all that should be attributed to second Causes, did
take away from the first.

But truly, he does too much abuse the Name of Philosophy, who considers the
wheels, curious frame, setting together, small pins, and all the make and
provision of a Clock, by which invented Machine the course of the Time, the
orders of the Months, the changes of the Planets, the flowing and ebbing of the
Sea, and other things of that kind, may be exactly known and measured, if that
at length, when by this his search and consideration, he has profited himself
so much, he should not acknowledge the Artist, to whose Labor and Wit he owes
all those things.

I am sure I am of another mind and opinion, who look into the Pandects of
Nature, as into another Table of the Divine Word, and the greater Bible: For
indeed, in either Volume there is no high point, which requires not the care,
or refuses the industry of an Interpreter; there is no Page certainly which
shows not the Author, and his Power, Goodness, Trust, and Wisdom.

In the mean time, there is no right Weigher of things that can lay to our
charge as a fault, that we have studied these Rolls of Nature, because some
Atheists may be made thereby; which may be objected to the studies of Divines
in Sacred Letters, that from their provision Heretics have taken their
Arguments and Opinions, and turned them against them and Godliness.

That I may deal freely, whoever professes Philosophy, and does not think
rightly of God, I do judge him not only to have shaken hands with Religion, but
also with Reason, and that he has at once put off Philosophy as well as
Christianity. Therefore I desire, that all mine may be tried and approved, no
less by the demonstration of Piety and Canons of the Church, than by the Rule
of Experience and Knowledge, to which I keep: Neither do I entreat and respect
only the Mecaenas of humane Arts, but also the Primate and chief of Divine,
whilst I openly profess my self, with all due observance,

YOUR GRACES Most humble and obliged Servant, THO. WILLIS.

The Preface to the Reader.
THE Romans sometimes promised to themselves an Empire, an Eternity by the
happy Augury of an humane Head being turned out of the Glebe; neither could
they persuade themselves, that the Capitol should be the Head of the World,
unless it had been built upon the Skull of a Man. I do not think of Empires in
Arts, nor do I promise to my self Triumphs by overcoming the World of Letters:
But in the mean time, I had wholly frustrated those Illustrious Documents I had
long since learned, unless with those Auspices I had labored in Philosophy,
especially the Natural.

For the Province, which I hold in this Academy, requiring that I should
Comment on the Offices of the Senses, both external and also internal, and of
the Faculties and Affections of the Soul, as also of the Organs and various
provisions of all these; I had thought of some rational Arguments for that
purpose, and from the appearances raised some not unlikely Hypotheses, which
(as uses to be in these kind of businesses) at length accrued into a certain
System of Art and frame of Doctrine. But when at last the force of Invention
being spent, I had handled each again, and brought them to a severer test, I
seemed to my self, like a Painter, that had delineated the Head of a Man, not
after the form of a Master, but at the will of a bold Fancy and Pencil, and had
followed not that which was most true, but what was most convenient, and what
was rather desired than what was known. Thinking on these things seriously with
my self, I awaked at length sad, as one out of a pleasant dream; to wit, I was
ashamed that I had been so easy hitherto, and that I had drawn out for my self
and Auditors a certain Poetical Philosophy and Physic neatly wrought with
Novity and Conjectures, and had made a Fucus as it were with deceits and
incantations for either of us.

Wherefore all delay being laid aside, I determined with my self seriously to
enter presently upon a new course, and to rely on this one thing, not to pin my
faith on the received Opinions of others, nor on the suspicions and guesses of
my own mind, but for the future to believe Nature and ocular demonstrations:
Therefore thenceforward I betook my self wholly to the study of Anatomy: and as
I did chiefly inquire into the offices and uses of the Brain and its nervous
Appendix, I addicted my self to the opening of Heads especially, and of every
kind, and to inspect as much as I was able frequently and seriously the
Contents; that after the figures, sites, processes of the whole and singular
parts should be considered with their other bodies, respects, and habits, some
truth might at length be drawn forth concerning the exercise, defects, and
irregularities of the Animal Government; and so a firm and stable Basis might
be laid, on which not only a more certain Physiologie than I had gained in the
Schools, but what I had long thought upon, the Pathologie of the Brain and
nervous stock, might be built.

But for the more accurate performing this work, as I had not leisure, and
perhaps not wit enough of my self, I was not ashamed to require the help of
others. And here I made use of the Labors of the most Learned Physician and
highly skilful Anatomist, Doctor Richard Lower, for my help and Companion; the
edge of whose Knife and Wit I willingly acknowledge to have been an help to me
for the better searching out both the frame and offices of before hidden
Bodies. Wherefore having got this help and Companion, no day almost past over
without some Anatomical administration; so that in a short space there was
nothing of the Brain, and its Appendix within the Skull, that seemed not
plainly detected, and intimately beheld by us. After this, when we entered upon
a far more difficult task, viz. the Anatomy of the Nerves, then very much
appeared the plainly to be admired skill of this Man, as also his indefatigable
Industry, and unwearied Labor: For having prosecuted, with a most exact
search, all the divarications, wandering on every side of the Nerve, how minute
or small soever, and immersed, and variously infolded within other Bodies, and
so turning over the Labyrinths of the Branches, and shoots of every pair, far
and near diffused, he drew out with his own hand the Schemes, Images, or
Draughts of them, and also of many passages of the Blood, as they appear in
this Tract; which indeed, that they might be faithfully and most exactly shown,
without any falsity or error, he caused, that no Table might contain scarce
any line or the most light passage, whose conformation and exact habitude he
had not found proved by the marks or inspection of many Animals for that
purpose killed.

Besides the helps brought me by his most skilful dissecting hand, it becomes
me not to hide, how much besides I did receive from these most famous Men, Dr.
Thomas Millington Doctor in Physic, and Dr. Chr. Wren Doctor of Laws, and
Savill Professor of Astronomy; both which were wont frequently to be present at
our Dissections, and to confer and reason about the uses of the Parts. Besides,
the former most Learned Man, to whom I from day to day proposed privately my
Conjectures and Observations, often confirmed me by his Suffrage, being
uncertain in my mind, and not trusting to my own opinion. But the other most
renowned Man, Dr. Wren, was pleased out of his singular humanity, wherewith he
abounds, to delineate with his own most skilful hands many Figures of the Brain
and Skull, whereby the work might be more exact.

But although instructed by these helps, and as it were hemmed in by the
plentiful assistances of these Illustrious Men, I come forth on the Stage, I
presume I shall not be however safe from calumny, and free from blame and most
just reprehension: because here is inquired into the recesses and most inward
dens of the Brain, and its depending parts as it were shut and sealed up;
concerning the certain uses of which, scarce any thing may be brought forth,
but that, as it may be published and shown, for the Judgments of the more
Learned, so it may be carpt at and torn by the opprobries of detractors. In
other parts, where matters appear to the Senses, we do not so easily run upon
errors. For in most of the Viscera and Vessels, the Contents and contained
humors, as also their passages within the larger Cavities of the containing
parts, are discerned by the sight: But in the Brain and Nerves, neither the
rushings on or impressions, viz. the Animal Spirits themselves, nor their
tracts or footsteps, can any ways be seen. Wherefore to explicate the uses of
the Brain, seems as difficult a task as to paint the Soul, of which it is
commonly said, That it understands all things but it self: for in truth, the
unwearied labor of the Brain beholds or searches the hidden places of other
Bodies, in the mean time the economy or regiment of its own Family and Kingdom
being wholly hid and unknown.

But what we profess to be performed by us in the following Tract, and hope for
the future from the help or labor of others, is chiefly this; to wit, that we
have not rashly described the parts themselves, of which the Anatomy is
instituted, but that we have with diligent care and great trust collected the
various appearances and Arguments of Observations by a manifold Dissection.
Which things, if you shall delineate out of those Sentences and granted
Decrees, as it were to a Mathematical Rule, and from thence would collect a
Theory, as yet lame, and that may not appear absolute in all its numbers, no
doubt but that a longer time, and the getting of more Observations may give it
a more perfect form, that Antiquity may not have said altogether in vain, That
Minerva was born from the Brain, Vulcan with his Instruments playing the
Midwife: For either by this way, viz. by Wounds and Death, by Anatomy, and a
Caesarean Birth, Truth will be brought to Light, or for ever lie hid.

THE ANATOMY OF THE BRAIN.
CHAP. I. The Method or Anatomical Administration of Dissecting the Brain is
proposed.
AMong the various parts of an animated Body, which are subject to Anatomical
disquisition, none is presumed to be easier or better known than the Brain; yet
in the mean time, there is none less or more imperfectly understood. All of it
that appears, and is commonly described in the forepart or forehead, is beheld
almost at a sight or two after some rude cutting up; but if you seek what lies
hid in the recesses for that end, new bosoms and productions of Bodies, before
hid, are every where laid open: yea the parts of the Brain it self are so
complicated and involved, and their respects and habitudes to one another so
hard to be extricated, that it may seem a more hard task to institute its
perfect Anatomy, than to delineate on a plain, the flexions and Meanders of
some Labyrinth: Because, as we are not able to estimate the measure or to paint
forth the pattern or draught of the frame of this, so neither of that, unless
the bulk or substance of the subject be first searched to the bottom, and its
frame broken into pieces. Hence it came to pass, that the old Anatomists in
dissecting the Brain, not sufficiently attending what was placed first, what
second, and what after that in the order of Nature, cut its Globe as it were
into slices or parts, and the Phenomenon arising by chance from such a
dissection, they easily esteemed for true parts of the Brain; when yet in the
mean time, by others from a dissection otherwise made, the parts and processes
of it appear far different from the former. The reason of which is, because the
substance or frame of the Brain and its Appendix lies so within the Skull, that
there are many swellings or tuberous risings, with several tails or little feet
compacted together: all which, although distinct one from another, and are
endued with figures diversely expanded; yet they, that they may be contained in
a lesser room, are thrust as it were into the same Globe, and so complicated
among themselves, that it is a hard thing to find out where the beginning and
end of the Brain, as also where the limits and partitions of the near adjoining
parts do remain; further, that the several parts of the Encephalon so
complicated, may retain their site, nor presently being loosned one from
another, may spring forth, they are knit together into due foldings, with
Fibers and Membranes stretched out from part to part. And as often as the
substance or bulk of the Brain so conglobated or rolled together is cut, there
is as often a necessity that the slips being cut, the portions of diverse parts
cleaving together, are carried away with them. Wherefore that a true and
genuine description of the Brain might be showed before its substance and
continuity is dissolved, before all things its whole frame or substance ought
to be explicated, and the knitting of the Membranes being wholly loosned, the
several parts ought to be turned over and stretched forth into their proper
dimensions. By what means these things may be done, and by what Method the
dissection or Anatomica administration of the Brain may be best performed,
ought here in the first place to be shown; then these things being first done,
we will more largely deliver the Description of the Brain, together with the
use and action of its several parts.

That the perfect knowledge of the Brain and its parts may be gained, it is
necessary not only to dissect and look into men's Heads, but all other kind of
living Creatures heads: for besides, that the humane Heads or Bodies are not so
readily to be had, that one may from day to day behold the Brain and its frame,
and carefully consider the situation of the parts, and search one after another
their respects, habitudes, and dependencies; besides also, the immense bulk of
an humane Head is in it self an hindrance, whereby its most intricate frame and
various recesses and Appendices are the less accurately discerned and
investigated: all which being reduced into an Epitomy, are plainly represented
more commodiously in the dissection of Beasts. Wherefore when the form and
composition of the Brain in a Dog, Calf, Sheep, Hog, and many other four-footed
beasts, were little different (the magnitude only excepted) from the figure of
the same, and the disposition of the parts, in a man, I was the more satisfied
to compose a certain Anatomy of the Brain by the frequent dissection of all
sorts of living Creatures. And in this employment, for that I shall show the
communities and differences which the subjected parts obtain in various
Animals, compared among themselves, and with Man; certainly from such a
compared Anatomy, not only the faculties and uses of every Organ, but the
impressions, influences, and secret ways of working of the sensitive Soul it
self will be discovered. Concerning the Heads of living Creatures, in the
dissection of which it happened for us chiefly to be exercised, it was
observed, as to the chief parts of the Head, that there was a notable Analogy
between Man and four-footed Beasts, also between Birds and Fishes: For when the
first Inhabitants of the new-made World were produced, as one day brought forth
Fowl and Fishes at once, another in like manner Man and four-footed Beasts; so
there is in either twin species a like form of the Brain; but between that
Child of the former, and this of the following day, there is found a great
difference as to those parts. For as much therefore as Men and four-footed
Beasts have got more perfect Brains, and more alike among themselves, we have
ordered our Observations from their Inspection: Then afterward we shall
deliver the Anatomy of the Brain in Fowl and Fishes. And here first concerning
the Heads of Men and four-footed Beasts, (as we hinted but now) we will propose
a Method of Dissection it self, or of Anatomical Administration, and will at
once recite all the parts one after another, and as it were in a compendious
Catalogue; then we will by and by more largely draw out the Particles of the
Brain and of its Appendix, so shadowed, in a short Table, and will design their
uses and actions for the exercise of every faculty.

When therefore we had in our hands the Head of a Man, or Dog, Calf, or Sheep,
its more outward coverings were taken off; concerning which, as they are well
enough known, we are not at all solicitous: then the covering of the Skull
being divided by a Saw or Instrument, and taken away, on every side the bones
are broken off with a pair of Scissers or a Penknife to the Basis of the Skull,
that so the Contents might, as much as may be, be all made plain or open to the
Spectators. What therefore comes first in view is the hard Meninx including all
the rest with a common covering. This Membrane outwardly and above is knit to
the Skull in diverse places, especially about the Sutures; but indeed about the
foot or Basis it most strictly cleaves to the bones, so that it cannot easily
be pulled away. Inwardly (or in its hollow superficies) it is lax and loose
enough, unless that nigh all its bosoms by the insertions of the Veins, and in
the Basis of the Skull by the Arteries and the Nerves it is tied to the Pia
Matter.

This same Membrane between the Interstitia or division of the Brain, and
besides of the Cerebel it self insinuating it self deeply on one side, and
rising up again on the other, leaves some duplicatures or infoldings, in which,
being shut up above by the increase of the same Membrane, Cavities, which they
commonly call Bosoms, are formed: to wit, by this means, almost the three first
bosoms are constituted; but the fourth is a smooth and longish, and also hollow
process of the same Membrane, which is sent through the Interstitia of the
Brain, nigh the end of the callous body, even to the pineal Glandula. The
Cavities of the greater Bosoms are severed in many places, as it were into
little Cells; as it seems for that end, that the blood passing so through the
various turnings in those ends, may be hindered from a more rapid motion.

Besides, this Meninx or Film of the Brain admits two Arteries from either
side, one conjugation of which arises not far from the Carotick Arteries
through the holes of the Cuniform bone, but the other from the bone of the
Forehead: all which indeed being diffused through the exterior superficies of
the Membrane, water it; but are terminated, partly in the Skull, especially
nigh the Sutures, whither they convey the blood, and partly in the bosoms,
where, what is superfluous is laid up. Moreover, these Arteries perforate the
hard Meninge in several places on the top of the Brain (as Webser observes) and
impart some shoots to the Pia Matter. Lastly, the exterior superficies of this
Meninge is no where planted with so many shoots of Veins as Arteries; but from
its four Bosoms (which are the veinous Receptacles of the blood) many Veins go
out through the interior superficies of this Membrane, which being inserted in
the Pia Matter, are presently dispersed through its whole compass, and the same
sliding down on every side from the bosoms, meet every where the Arteries
ascending from the Basis of the Head, and being intermingled with them,
constitute the manifold infoldings of the Vessels.

That these may be the better beheld, after the Arteries are sufficiently
noted, let the hard Meninx be cut round near the border of the broken Skull;
then let whatever of it serves for a covering and partition to the Brain and
Cerebel, be lifted up, that the goings out of the Vessels, viz. the Veins and
their distributions into the Pia Matter may be considered; which being
afterward broken asunder, let the Membrane with its bosoms be wholly taken
away; but the relics of this Membrane, which stick to the bones at the bottom
of the Skull, should be separated; so that the whole frame or substance of the
Brain and its Appendix may be somewhat elevated, and moved here and there, be
every where conspicuous, and at length taken from the Skull. But that these
things may be performed, you must begin from the anterior or fore part, where
the bone of the Forehead separates it.

Therefore if the prow of the Brain, hid under this bone, be a little lifted
up, the mammillary processes come presently in sight, together with the
smelling Nerves hanging to them; which being dissected near the insertion;
there will appear an hollowness in either process. These are large and round,
also full of clear water in Calves: but in either smelling Nerve a manifest
Cavity is found continued on either side to the anterior Ventricles of the
Brain, to which if a Pipe be put and blown into, presently the whole substance
of the Brain will swell.

Next the smelling Nerves about the Cocks comb two small Arteries are seen to
arise from the Skull, and to be carried toward the Interstitium of the Brain,
which in truth are branches of the Carotides, which are knit to the dilated
Comb before, and from thence are seen to be reflected to the anterior Brain.

These Vessels being there dissected, the coming together and going out of the
Optic Nerves follow, the trunk of which being cut off a little lower, the
Tunnel, and out of both its sides the Arteries called Carotides, arising out of
the Cuniform-bone, do appear; which are more clearly beheld, if the Brain be
lifted up. These also being cut off, and the brain farther bent back, the
moving Nerves of the Eyes presently show themselves; and so from thence the
other pairs of Nerves follow in order, that one pair of them being cut off, and
the brain with its Appendix more lifted up, the next is still obvious to those
beholding it, till all the Nerves arising within the Skull, and also the
Arteries, both the Carotides, and the Vertebral being at length cut off, the
whole frame of the Head may be taken out of the Skull.

But (that these Vessels may be described in the same order as they are met
with in the cutting them up) two small Nerves follow after those moving Nerves
of the Eyes, which, for a reason hereafter rendered, we call Pathetick. These
Nerves higher than the rest, arising behind two round Prominences called Nates
and Testes, (the Buttocks and Stones of the Brain) and bending down forward,
and entering for a little space under the dura Matter, then coming out through
the same hole, together with the former, from the Skull, are propagated into
the sight of the Eye. This pair is called by Fallopius the eighth, by us the
fourth.

Beneath these little Nerves, from both sides of the annulary protuberance,
(which being sent from the Cerebel compasses the oblong Marrow) two Nerves of
noted magnitude arise, which, after they have passed through the dura Matter,
send forth another notable branch on either side straight down without the
Skull, the other branch, by a longer tract, passing through both sides the
Skull near the Turkey Chair. These Nerves (as is shown afterward) having gotten
a larger Province, are enlarged in the Palate, the parts of the Mouth and Face,
and also their branches in the Nose and Eyes, yea they impart roots to the
intercostal Nerve. We call this pair the fifth, commonly esteemed the third.

Nigh to the beginning of these, out of the lowest foot of the oblong Marrow or
Pith, two lesser Nerves, endued with a single trunk, arise, which being dilated
forward, and presently entering under the dura Matter, come out of the same hole
with the moving Nerves of the Eyes, and are all carried into the balls of the
Eyes. This pair is called by us the sixth.

Next to these Nerves follow the auditory or hearing pair, which indeed arises
higher from the sides of the oblong Marrow, in what part the Cerebel is hanged
to it, viz. nigh the lesser annulary process; from whence it is immediately
carried with a double process into the hole of the stony Bone: one of its
branches is harder, serving chiefly for motion; the other altogether medullary
and softer, as it were only destinated to sense.

A little lower arises the wandering pair, which is commonly called the sixth.
This seems to be made of many Nerves, many of which arise together; and to them
comes another, endued with a greater trunk, which being brought from the end of
the oblong Marrow, yea beyond this, out of the spinal Marrow, is united with
the former. And so all being made like a bundle of Nerves, go out through the
hole of the hinder part of the Head; through which also goes out the greater
branch of the internal jugular Vein. This is by us called the eighth pair.

Under the wandering pair, almost out of the Basis of the oblong Marrow, another
pair arises, consisting also of many Fibers, which going straight down, and
being presently immersed in the dura Matter, comes forth again through a
peculiar hole out of the Skull; then either Nerve, being inoculated into the
trunk of the wandering pair, is presently bended back toward the Tongue. In a
man, a peculiar protuberance grows above the oblong Marrow, out of which the
beginning of this Nerve proceeds. This we call the ninth pair.

Below this, in the lowest part of the hinder part of the Head, out of the
sides of the oblong Marrow, where it is about to go into the spinal, another
pair, consisting also of many Fibers, arises; which tending toward the spinal
Marrow, enters the dura Matter at the same place where the vertebral Artery
ascends into the Brain; yet it arises out of the bosoms of the bones, but below
the first Vertebra or Joint, from whence it is carried into the Muscles of the
hinder part of the Neck, so that it is doubtful, whether this pair ought to be
called the last of the Skull, or the first of the Vertebrals.

When these parts, viz. the aforesaid Nerves and Arteries, both the Carotides
and the Vertebrals, with the jugular Veins (by which the Encephalon is fastened
to the foot or basis of the Skull) are cut off, and their ends stretched out as
much as may be; either let them remain in the taken out substance or frame,
whereby the beginnings of all the Nerves may be plainly noted; or the trunks of
them being cut off near the roots, may be left in the holes of the Skull,
whereby their goings out and distributions may be observed. The images of
either Example are delineated in the first and second Table.

The business of Dissection being thus far brought, the residue of the Skull
shows many things worthy consideration, of which we shall speak particularly
afterward. But first we ought to view thoroughly the taken out frame or
substance of the Brain, together with its Appendix, and to examine all its
appearances as they follow in the order of Dissection.

The substance or bulk being taken out, which is of a somewhat round figure or
spherical, it exhibits to the sight in its superior and unequal part the Brain
and Cerebel; but the oblong Marrow, with the utmost borders or edges of the
superior bodies, possesses almost all the basis or its lowest part. The
thinner Meninx covers these three placed near, and the outward superficies of
them all; nor does it clothe the same loosly, but deeply insinuating it self
into all their cavities and recesses, covers and binds them strictly. And as
this Membrane is every where interwoven, with the folds of the Vessels, by its
stretching out, it reaches the same to every part and portion, and so waters
the whole with a sufficient afflux of blood. Here we must consider the Vessels
of this Membrane and its protension.

As to the former, the whole superficies of the frame of the subject may be
seen, covered with the infoldings of Vessels, as it were with a net admirably
variegated or flourished, and its sight or aspect shows like the picture of a
fruit-bearing wood; the Idea of which, the Vessels of the Brain more aptly
represent, and are themselves seen better and more distinctly, if you first
squirt into the Carotidick Artery some black liquor. The Vessels interwoven
within the thin Meninge or Piae Matter are Arteries and Veins. The Arteries are
four, viz. two Carotides and two Vertebrals. Out of either side of the Tunnel
the ends of the cut off Carotidick Arteries show themselves, the trunks of
which ascending upwards, are presently diffused from either side into the
anterior and posterior, or fore and hinder branch. Either pair of these
inclining one toward the other, are mutually conjoined: moreover, the
posterior branches so joined, are united with the Vertebral branches (growing
together first into one trunk.) For the Vertebral Arteries, arising from the
last hole but one of the Skull, fall at first divided through the sides of the
oblong Marrow; then united in its basis, they go into a single chanel, which
meeting with the hinder branches of the Carotides, (as it is said) it is joined
with them; and from that place of the joining of them together, a noted branch
ascends on either side under the edge or rim of the Brain, which being dilated
upon the shanks or stocks of the oblong Marrow, is cleft or divided into very
many small shoots like hairs, some of which ascend to the Glandula's placed
behind the Cerebel, but the rest make the arterious part of the Choroeidal
infoldings. The anterior branches of the Carotides, before they are united,
send from themselves on either side a noted branch, which creeping upwards like
a bounding River, distinguishes either Hemisphere of the Brain as it were into
two Provinces; but after the aforesaid branches are united, presently departing
again from one another, they are carried to the Prow of the Brain, and from
thence bending back between its Hemispheres, they fall upon the callous body.
All these Arteries, before and after their mutual joining together, send forth
shoots and little branches on every side, which do not only creep through and
intimately bind about the utmost compass of its Sphere, but its Penetralia and
more inward recesses, like the young branches of Vines. The ramifications or
these sorts of branchings, both of the Carotides and of the Vertebrals, are
shown in the first Table, as they are found in a Man, and as in a Sheep in the
second Table.

Moreover, this thinner Meninx or Pia Matter clothing the whole Brain and its
parts, as it receives the Arteries ascending (as has been said) from a
fourfold Fountain, so it is stuffed throughout with Veins, sent from four
bosoms. These Vessels mutually meeting, are complicated together, and almost
every where constitute by their branches derived from both, and meeting one the
other, and variously contorted among themselves, the net-like or retiform
infoldings; which indeed are not only outwardly in the superficies, but in the
dissection, wherever you may separate one part from another, without breaking
it, these kind of infoldings of the Vessels are to be found. Because, if you
behold this frame, taken out of the Skull, collecting together the tops of all
the turnings and the Interstitia in this Membrane, and covering them with the
joynings of the Vessels, it will make the whole compass or frame of the
Encephalon appear like a curious quilted ball. But if you go on to cast abroad
this Sphere, and to separate the cleaving parts, knit together, of this
Membrane, one from another, you will soon find, that this Meninx covers the
gapings of the crevices or turning chaps of the Brain, binds the Interstitia of
either moity or Hemisphere, draws together the hinder part of the Brain,
otherwise being lax and hanging loose, and compassing about every border of it,
as it were with a Welt, knits it to the oblong Marrow: and what is the chief of
all, the universal Cortical or shelly substance of the Brain (to wit, in which
the animal Spirits are procreated) is covered over with this Membrane planted
with most frequent infoldings of the Vessels; notwithstanding the interior
superficies of the Brain being stretched out, (which being called the Callous
body, is altogether medullary and white) is not clothed with this Membrane;
but instead of it many foldings of Vessels, commonly called Choroeides, are
hung and as it were freely flow within its complicature. The reason of which
is, because as this part, to wit, the callous body, is rather designed for the
Circulation than for the generation of Spirits, therefore it admits not a more
plentiful influx of blood: nevertheless, for as much as there is need of heat,
whereby the Spirits may be there more easily circulated, the blood being moved,
within the Vessels hanging there through the empty space, might afford heat as
it were from a fire kindled within a Stove. But within all the other recesses
of the Brain, and besides within the folds or lappets of the Cerebel, yea and
the Interstitia or gaps of both these, and of the oblong Marrow, this Meninx
insinuates it self, and inserts the distributions of the Vessels. In truth, the
protension or out-stretching of this Membrane seems therefore the more
admirable, because having no where a peculiar place of its origin, it not only
binds about the Head or Encephalon with a common covering, but also clothes all
its parts with proper coverings, and knits together their tops and processes.
Yea this Meninx seems to enjoy a manifold and diverse original: for wherever
the gapings or Interstitia of any parts or processes happen, portions of this
Membrane there springing forth, cover them all, and gather them together, and
reach to them the ramifications or branchings of the Vessels. In a moister
Brain this Meninx may be easily separated, and ample and large portions of it
pulled away with the fingers; which being drawn away, the insertions of the
Vessels, into the substance of the Brain and its Appendix, every where clearly
appear. Lastly, by this means the brain being thus left naked, unclothed of its
Membranes and Coverings, its make or fabric, and the disposition or order of
all its parts are next subjected to Anatomical Inspection.

That the Anatomy of the Brain, properly so called, might be rightly
celebrated, I judge we ought not to proceed after the common way of Dissection.
But whenas the substance of the whole Head, taken out of the Skull, stands in
view, first let the hinder partition of the brain, where it is knit to the
Cerebel and oblong Marrow or Pith, the Membranes being every where cut or
pulled off, be freed (as much as it may be) from its cleaving to the subjected
parts; then it will easily appear, that the substance of the brain is not
united to those bodies, but of it self is altogether free and independent of
them, unless where it is joined toward the superficies by the knitting of the
Membranes. Also this keel or hinder part of the brain being divided by this
means from the neighboring parts, if the fore part be bent back, the shanks of
the oblong Marrow will appear wholly naked, and distinct from the brain and
Cerebel (unless where they are in some places hung to it.) Moreover, when the
partition of the brain, being loosned from its cohesion, is lifted up, the
three Ventricles, commonly so called, go into one empty space or mere vacuity,
resulting from the complication of the brain. Besides, it may be observed, how
the brain before is only united to the oblong Marrow; and that in two places of
its shanks, as it were the tops, it is fixed; which Fornix so called, or arched
Vault, is as it were a string or ligament, which arising before, where the
brain is hanging to it, is carried to its hinder border, to which it is united
as it were with two stretched out arms, and so it holds together the whole
frame of the brain, lest it be rolled out into a plain, still in a spherical
figure, and firmly binds the same to the shanks of the oblong Marrow. From the
knitting of the other parts of the humane brain divided and lifted upwards,
whereby the vacuity resulting from its enfolding, and esteemed for Ventricles,
also whereby the Fornix or arched Vault and shanks of the oblong Marrow, naked
and distinct, may be beheld, is represented by figure in the fourth Table.

And truly, this Position or Aspect of the Brain, to wit, when its hinder
border or partition, being freed from its cohesion by the Membranes to the
oblong Marrow, and elevated, is bent forward, exposes to be seen by the eyes
themselves, its whole frame or substance, to wit, whatever it has without or
within, or before and behind, and also plainly detects what its habitude and
respect is to the other parts. The chief things of these I shall add, and in
the same order wherein they occurred to Inspection.

The figure of the Brain, especially in a man, shows somewhat globous or
spherical: the outward superficies is on all sides noted with chinks turning
and winding like to the rollings about of the Intestines: each breach or
involution, yea the whole circuit of it contains a twofold substance, viz. the
Cortical or rindy, which is the outmost and of an Ash Color; and the medullary
or marrowy, which lies under it, and appears white. The brain being as it were
plowed with these kind of rollings about, like so many ridges and furrows, is
cleft in the middle, and parted as it were into two Hemispheres; yet both the
moities come together, and are as it were founded in one like white substance,
which covers inwardly, and as it were in Chambers or Vaults, the whole bulk of
the brain. This is harder than any other portion of the brain, and as it is
altogether medullary, it receives all the marrows of the circumvolutions within
it self, and is to them instead of a common basis. In either Hemisphere of the
brain, about the fore parts, this callous body or marrowy substance, becomes
more firm and thick by far than in any other place; and there it is on both
sides fastened to the tops of the oblong Marrow. From those tops, as it were its
beginning, this medullary substance, covering over or chambering or arching the
brain, is stretched out toward the hinder parts, and by degrees lessens in its
thickness: at length the outward border of this stretched out, is drawn
together more narrowly, and more below, it is conjoined by the knitting of the
Membranes and Vessels (as we but now mentioned) to the tail of the oblong
Marrow. Besides, for its more firm connection, a medullary process arises from
the fore part of the callous body toward the tops of it, which stretching
under the fissure or cleft of the brain, reaches to its border; to which it is
united, as it were with arms bending on either side: which arms indeed embrace
the tail of the oblong Marrow, and so more firmly knit to it that border of the
brain.

This medullary process, commonly called the Fornix, under its rise or
beginning, has two white and medullary roots, either of them alike going out
from the callous body, which roots nigh the tops, where the brain is hung to
them, meeting together, pass into the Fornix or Vault it self, as if it were a
broad process, which stretches under the chamber of the brain, like a beam.
Under this twofold root of the Fornix is laid cross-wise, of the same
magnitude, a medullary trunk, by which, like a bridge, there is a certain
passage and communication between two processes of the form of a Lentil, and
chamfer'd or furrowed bodies beaming or shining in them. Further, from the
midst of the superficies of this Fornix, a thin and pellucid hedge or pale is
erected, which is affixed to the chanel or furrow of the callous body, almost
along its whole passage. And for this reason, whilst the three-sided Fornix
stretched underneath a chamber, arising from the complication of the brain, it
distinguished its appearing cavity as it were into three partitions, and so
caused, that in it three Ventricles were represented.

The interior recesses of the Brain will lie yet more clearly open, if the
border, being on every side separated and lifted up, as much as may be, from
its cohering with the oblong Marrow, be cut a little further through the
substance at the sides of the same Marrow, to which it is united, nigh the
chamfer'd bodies, and also the Fornix, being cut nigh the roots, be bent back,
together with the brain; for then the frame of the brain may be wholly lifted
up, turned forward, and unfolded into a plain, so that the whole interior
superficies of the callous body being stretched out into a broad floor, may be
seen and handled. Where, besides the medullary, and its most white substance,
may be observed many white parallel lines, which cut the partition of the brain
in right angles, as if they were certain tracts or footsteps, in which the
animal Spirits travel from one Hemisphere of the brain to the other, and return
back again.

After this manner, in very many perfect four-footed Beasts, the frame or
substance of the brain was wont to be turned over, the Sphere being projected
into a plain, and its interior superficies to be unfolded into breadth. Also
this kind of Method of Dissection may be used in a man's brain, where the same
Phenomenon wholly occur to Anatomical observation. The chief difference is,
that the bulk of the brain of a man, for that it is very large, and also far
thicker, and endued with more turnings and windings; therefore it cannot be so
easily and thoroughly inverted, as that of a Calf or Sheep, and reduced into a
broad plain: yet it may be so far expanded and lifted up near its border or
partition, that all the interior recesses may appear in view. The third and
fourth Figures show the image of an humane brain bent back: but in the seventh
Table is shown the aspect or sight of a Sheeps brain wholly unfolded, and as it
were spread plain.

In the lesser four footed Beasts, as a Mouse, an Hare, Coney, and some others,
the superficies of the brain being wholly plain or even, wants the turnings and
windings; however from the complication of the border, and the under-stretching
of the Fornix, there results a cavity representing Ventricles.

After that we have thoroughly viewed all things which belong to the Brain, in
the order as we have said, let either Hemisphere, covered within with the
callous body, by which it hangs, be divided and removed from the tops of the
oblong Marrow: which indeed may be exactly done, by cutting it near to the
sides of the Lentiform prominencies, which are found in the vulgar dissection
of the Head, within the interior Ventricles: for those prominences are the tops
or heights of the shanks of the oblong Marrow, to which the callous body is
immediately fixed. When the brain is cut after this manner, that the
prominencies, which are the tops of the shanks of the oblong Marrow, may be
left naked, let them be cut long ways through the midst (to wit, in the
medullary part, where they are conjoined to the callous body) and their
interior substance will appear through the whole chamfered or streaked; viz.
medullary streaks or chamferings are seen to ascend and descend forward and
backward; that none may doubt, but that these chamferings or streaks were made
by Nature, as it were passages or channels for the passage and return, or going
to and fro of the Spirits out of the callous body into the oblong Marrow, and
on the contrary. The Figure of the shanks of the oblong Marrow, divided from
the Brain, with their tops, which are the chamfered bodies, is expressed in the
eighth Table.

After these st^iated or streaked bodies, the shanks of the oblong Marrow being
divided for a little space, go forward, then being united, they meet together
in the same stock, made up as it were of two stems. But the stock or trunk of
the oblong Marrow in its whole tract, viz. before and after the coalition of
its shanks, has many Processes, Appendices, Prominences, and Insertions of
Vessels, some of which arise from one side, and others from the other side, and
make it unequal, with various productions and protuberances; of which hereafter.

CHAP. II. The Parts of the oblong Marrow, and the rest of the hinder Parts of
the Head are recounted, and their Dissection shown.
HAving described both the Meninges, and the ramifications of the Vessels in
them, also the fabric of the Brain, properly so called; and next showed its
outward partition gathered together into folds about the shanks of the oblong
Marrow, and either middle or marrowy part of it hung to the chamfered bodies;
we will now follow the remaining parts of the Head in order.

The chamfered or streaked bodies, or the tops of the oblong Marrow, are two
lentiform Prominences, which are beheld within the former Ventricles of the
Brain, as they are commonly termed; the heads of these, which are more large
and blunt, incline mutually one to another, and are almost contiguous. Out of
the angle of this inclination the Fornix arises with a double root; to which is
subjected or underlaid a certain transverse medullary process, and seems to
knit together these streaked bodies, as may be seen in the seventh Table GG:
but the ends of those bodies, being made sharper, are reflected outward, and
make as it were two sides, with a sharp triangle, to whose anterior superficies
the marrow of the callous body sticks for a long tract; where, if these bodies
be cut long-ways through the midst, the medullary streaks (as was already said)
will presently appear. The figure and place of these, as also the medullary
chamferings, are truly represented in the eighth Table.

Where the streaked bodies end, the chambers or Thalami, as they are termed, of
the optic Nerves, possess the next part to the oblong marrow; to wit, in this
place, its shanks rise into unequal protuberances, out of the ridges of which
the Optic Nerves arise, and from thence, being bent down in the forepart with
a certain compass, they join together about the base of the same marrow, and
seem to be united; by and by being again parted, and going forward toward the
ball of the Eye, they go out of the Skull. In this place the shanks of the
oblong marrow in a Man are for the most part distinct, and gaping one from
another, leave a descending opening, which is the passage to the Tunnel; but in
most four-footed Beasts the shanks of the same medullary stocks are there
distinct, only a little lower, and have a chink cut for the Tunnel: but the
ridges of them, in which the beginnings of the Optic Nerves lie hid, are
somewhat conjoined, and for the space of half an inch do grow together.
Wherefore in Brutes there is one hole before this growing together, and another
behind it, both which lead toward the Tunnel. The reason of this difference
is, because in a Man, for that the frame or substance of the brain it self is
very large, and that its marrowy parts are remote one from another, it is
behoveful for its shanks, whereby the tops of the oblong marrow may be the
better fitted to the same, to be separated, and from their mutual touching to
be bent into a greater aperture. Hence it is observed, that in a Man the shanks
of the oblong marrow, from the hanging on of the brain, go forward with a
greater angle of inclination, and with a certain bending compass; but in Brutes
the same lie almost parallel. After what manner these parts are formed in an
humane brain the third and fourth Figure shows; after what manner they are in
four footed Beasts is shown in the seventh Figure.

From the same ridges of the medullary shanks, from whence the Optic Nerves
take their origines, certain medullary processes arising, and being dilated on
either side above the brim of the second hole, grow together about the root of
the pineal Glandula. These processes (as it seems) are those parts, which the
Famous Carts supposes to be Nerves belonging to the pineal Glandula: but I
rather suspect them to be productions only, by which the Optic Nerves may also
communicate near their origines. Their figure is very well described in the
seventh Table.

After the Thalami or Chambers of the Optic Nerves, other notable
protuberances, commonly called Nates and Testes, the Buttocks and Testicles (of
the brain) grow to the superior part of the medullary Trunk or stem, and cover
its superficies about the space of an inch; and for that they are not
contiguous in the midst, there is under them a certain hollowness in their
whole tract. These protuberances are lesser in a Man, also in a Dog and Cat;
lastly, if we observed rightly, in other living Creatures, which are newly
brought forth, that are impotent, and not instructed for the finding out of
food. In a Calf, Sheep, Hog, and the like, they appear far greater: in Fishes
and Fowls they are wholly wanting.

In number they are four, viz. two grow to either side of the oblong marrow.
The former called Nates or the Buttocks, seem the greater and principal; to
which the other latter called Testes or the Testicles, hang as if growing out
of them. As to their figure, they are round, and are commonly taken for two
shanks on either side of the brain and Cerebel planted near, which being bent
inwardly, and turned back one toward the other, are said to grow together, and
so to constitute the oblong marrow. But this opinion, as we shall show more
largely hereafter, by the dissection ordered according to our Method, is
clearly false. For it plainly appears, that the brain is fixed, long before
these bodies, to the oblong marrow; nor is there any commerce between these and
that, unless very remote.

But if the site of these parts, and their respects and habitudes to the
neighboring bodies, be well noted, it will appear plainly, that they make as
it were a certain peculiar Region wholly distinct from the Brain and Cerebel,
also from the oblong marrow it self. Their situation is remote enough from the
fore-parts, and sufficiently separated by the Cavity or Ventricle under-lying
from the medullary stock or stem: yea a proper way, or one process, seems to
lead from the long marrow into these prominences, and another to go from them,
and thence to be carried into the Cerebel. From hence we may suspect, that
these prominences (especially the Natiform, or of the shape of a Buttock, which
are the chief) are certain places of diversion, in which the animal Spirits go
apart in their passage from the oblong marrow into the Cerebel, and from this
to that on the other side, and there stay for some animal uses, of which we
shall speak hereafter. As to the way, which leads from the oblong marrow into
these prominences; it is manifest, that beneath the origines of the Optic
Nerves on either side a medullary Process descends, with little Villages proper
for it self, which terminates in the aforesaid prominencies. Then, if from
these, you look for a passage out, it is equally clear, that from the
hindermost prominences, which are called Testes, on either side, a medullary
process does obliquely ascend, which being dilated into the Cerebel, is
divaricated through its whole frame. But that the Natiform or Buttock-formed
Prominences are Principals, and the Testes their dependences, or the heads of
medullary Processes, which are carried from thence into the Cerebel, manifestly
appears in a Sheep, Calf, or Horse, and in some others, where the Nates are of
a noted magnitude, the Testes of a very small bulk grow to them, and in the
middle between these the medullary Processes, the Appendices of the former
Prominences, exist. The aforesaid Prominences, as also the medullary Processes,
which lead forward and backward, to and from them, are aptly represented in the
fourth Table, but yet more clearly in the eighth Table TT. PP.

Further, because the animal Spirits residing in either Promptuary and
Appendix, before they are carried to the Brain, ought to be confounded and
mingled together, therefore the two prominences of either side do mutually grow
together as it were with wings stretched out one to another; but for as much as
it is behoveful for those growings together to be distingushed from the oblong
marrow, therefore an hollowness comes between, which is by some esteemed the
fourth Belly, and by others a passage to it. These prominences in a Man, Dog,
and Cat, and some other Animals (as was above mentioned) are very small, and
almost even; also they appear, as the other portion of the oblong marrow, of a
white color. In a Calf, Sheep, Horse, and many other four-footed Beasts, the
former protuberances, commonly called Nates or Buttocks, are remarkably great,
also outwardly they appear to be of a flesh color, because they are clothed
with the thin Meninx or Pia Matter, which contains in it self very many Veins
and Arteries; which if separated, the interior substance of those parts is of a
wannish color, and such as is not in all the oblong marrow or pith besides.
But it plainly appears, as in Brutes, so in Man, the hinder or posterior
prominences are Epiphyses or additions of the former, and that from these
additions or dependences the medullary processes ascend obliquely into the
Cerebel; near which, other processes cutting those, descend direct from the
Cerebel, which seem not to be inserted into the medullary Trunk, but going
about it, do constitute the annulary or ringy protuberance. This annulary
protuberance is greater in a Man than in any other Creature. Besides, it is
observed, that wherever the superior prominence of the Buttock-form is
larger, this inferior annulary is very small; and so on the contrary. Further,
those medullary processes, ascending toward the Cerebel, communicate mutually
among themselves by the other transverse medullary process; and out of this
transverse process, two small little Nerves arise, the fourth pair of those
which we have recounted, and which are called by us Pathetical. Each of these,
delineated in fit figures, the seventh Table shows clear enough.

Not far from the aforesaid Prominences, to wit, between these and the Chink,
which is called the Anus or Arse-hole, the Pineal Glandula or Kernel is placed.
This is put in a Valley, which lies between the Natiform protuberances, and
those which are the Chambers or Thalami of the Optic Nerves; in which place
that Glandula or Kernel is fixed, sometimes by very many small Fibers, and
sometimes by two noted medullary roots subjected to the part; and besides, it
is included in a Membrane, which is a portion of the Pia Matter, as in a Chest;
and as this Membrane is stuffed with very many Arteries and Veins, some small
Vessels also enter into this Glandula.

Under the Prominences but now described, (as was above hinted) a narrow Cavity
or Ventricle is stretched out with a long passage, which, although it obtains
some egregious uses, yet it self seems to be only secondary, and as it were by
chance; for that the processes of either prominence ought to be conjoined among
themselves, and to be distinguished from the under-lying medullary Trunk. Two
holes lie open into this Trunk, one of which is placed in the beginning, and
the other in the end of it, and through the middle of its passage the
down-bending aperture tends toward the Tunnel; so that the serous humor
entering at either hole, may presently slide away into the Tunnel. Moreover,
into the same aperture of the Tunnel there lies open another passage, to wit,
through the first hole, which is placed near the roots of the Fornix; so that
from every quarter of the Head the serosities might be carried into that sink:
to wit, that through the first hole, from the infoldings or the anterior
Ventricles of the Brain; through the second hole, the humors which are gathered
about the orbicular prominences, do come away; and through the third hole,
those which are laid up high the confines of the Cerebel, do find a passage.
These several holes, with the distinct ways to the Tunnel, are plainly
delineated in the seventh Table H. M. T.

Above the Pineal Kernel, as it were above the Button, the enfolding of the
Choroeides seems to be hung; now this enfolding is made after this manner: out
of either side of the oblong marrow, where the border of the brain is knit to
it, two Arteries arising from the posterior branches of the Carotides, where
they are united to the Vertebrals, do directly ascend; which being presently
divided, like many Rivers planted near together, are carried toward the pineal
Glandula, and there seem to be terminated by a mutual meeting: and in that
place, out of the fourth bosom, sent down upon the pineal Glandula, the veinous
branches come out on both sides, which in like manner being divided into
filaments or small threads, meet with the capillary or hairy Arteries, and are
in many places inoculated into them, and variously complicated with them; and
so these Vessels, being Net-like, much interwoven among themselves, and
interserted with the Glandula's, do constitute the to be admired infoldings.
These kind of infoldings of the Vessels, as it were with two outstretched
wings, are thrust out on either side upon the shanks of the oblong marrow, even
to the streaked bodies; but yet they only lie upon their superficies, nor are
they more firmly affixed either to the oblong marrow, or to the callous body by
any insertions of the Vessels; so that the blood seems only to be brought to
these places, and carried away without any afflux of it made into the subjected
parts; for what uses shall be spoken of hereafter. The Choroidal infoldings,
with the pineal Glandula, are drawn out in the seventh Table G. F. E.

And thus far concerning the appearances found above the oblong Marrow, between
the streaked bodies and the Cerebel; which indeed are almost constantly after a
like manner both in Man and four-footed Beasts, unless that they only differ in
bigness. Within this space, in the Pedestal or Basis of the same Marrow, many
things worth noting occur: For besides the ends of the cut off Vessels, which
are above recited, the site and structure of the Infundible or Tunnel deserve
consideration. For behind the coalition or joining together of either Optic
Nerve between the shanks of the oblong marrow there gaping, is sent down a
receptacle as it were tubulated or made like a Pipe, covered without with a
thin Membrane arising from the Pia Matter, and defended within with a medullary
substance. The orifice of this is placed higher between the shanks of the
oblong marrow, and receives their bending aperture; from thence a short Tube or
Pipe being sent down, is inserted to the pituitary Glandula or Kernel. We see
this Tube in an Horses brain greater than a Gooses quill, also shining and full
of clear water; that it is not to be doubted, but that by this way the serous
humors slide away from the brain to the pituitary Glandula: but how these
humors are carried away from thence, shall be afterward inquired into, because
they are not carried into the Palate or roof of the mouth, as is commonly
believed.

Nigh the lower border of the Tunnel, in a Man, underneath there are two
whitish Glandula's; though in Brutes only one, but greater, is found. What is
the proper use of this part shall be told hereafter: in the mean time, whether
it be doubled or only one larger, it seems to be as it were instead of a bank
to defend or preserve the thin Membrane of the Tunnel, lest it should be broken
or thrust out of its place: on the other side the growing together of the
Optic Nerves serves instead of the same kind of defense.

What besides is contained in this space are only the shanks of the oblong
marrow it self, which proceed directly from the chambers of the Optic Nerves
toward the hinder part of the Head in a straight passage; and when both grow
together below the Tunnel, they are afterward distinguished in their whole
tract by a line drawn through the midst. These shanks of a man's brain are far
larger than in brute beasts: to wit, in that they seem to be made up of very
many medullary chords or strings joined together in one, as if in this common
passage and highway of the animal Spirits, they were so many distinct paths,
which the Spirits enter into respectively, according to the various impulses of
sense and local motion. Moreover, this space of the oblong marrow therefore
appears shorter and more broken in a man, because much of it is hid by the
annulary protuberance, which is sent from the Cerebel, and is very big. The Pia
Matter, all about covering the sides of this medullary Trunk, clothes them with
most thick infoldings of the Vessels; by which heat and the nervous juice are
carried, as a continual provision for the Spirits, taking a long journey. Thus
much for the first Section, or anterior portion of the oblong marrow: now our
order carries us to the inspection of its hinder Region, to wit, where the
Cerebel grows to it; and the Processes sent from this either compass about its
Trunk, or are inserted into it; out of which also, the other Nerves produced
within the Skull, take their beginnings. Concerning these we will speak in
order.

CHAP. III. A Description of the Cerebel and its Processes, also of the hinder
Region of the oblong Marrow.
BElow the orbicular Prominences, the Cerebel follows to be inspected. The
figure of this, like the Brain, is somewhat globous, also it appears unequal,
marked with certain turnings and windings about; the ridges and furrows of
whose turnings about the Pia Matter stretches over, and reaches out the
infoldings of the Vessels to them all, and deeply inserts them into all.
However the Cerebel is diversified or variegated with its turnings and rollings
about, not as the Brain, after an uncertain manner; but its folds are disposed
in a certain orderly series; for the exterior frame of it seems to consist of
thin lappets, or little rings or circles, being contiguous and infolded, also
going about through the whole compass with a parallel site or situation.

Either Region of the Cerebel, to wit, the former and the hinder, is terminated
in a process in form of a Worm. According to these ends, as it were in a double
Pole, these Circles are very short; thence ascending toward the top or
Equator, they are by degrees enlarged, as it were Parallels in a Sphere or
Globe. These Circles are outwardly Cortical or barky, and within medullary, and
all their marrowy parts pass into two ample middles; which indeed seem to be
the same in the Cerebel, as the callous body in the brain.

The Cerebel in some Animals consists of one frame, and all its little circles
are placed in the same parallel site, and keep the same proportion among
themselves; but in others there grow to the Cerebel as it were the primary
Sphere, and endued with greater circles, some other bodies as it were Wens or
Extuberances, or additional Spheres marked with lesser circles. These being
eccentrick to the Cerebel it self, have oftentimes labels or folds ordered in a
diverse series from it.

But the Cerebel it self (whether it has these little Excrescences growing to
it or not) is found almost in all Animals of the same figure and proportion,
also made up of the same kind of labels or lappets. Those which have the brain
diversely framed from a Man's, as Fowl and Fishes, also among four-legged
Creatures, Conies and Mice, whose brains want turnings about or convolutions,
have the like species and the like disposition of the folds and composure of
the other parts of the Cerebel. The reason of this difference in the brain, and
of the conformity in the Cerebel, is rendered hereafter, when we treat of the
Use of the Parts.

As the Brain, within its Cavity, has the Choroidal enfolding made up of
Arteries and Velsis variously complicated, and of Glandula's thickly
interserted; so also the Cerebel has got the like infoldings of Vessels, and
those marked with very many Glandula's, and greater than those in the Choroidal
enfolding. These infoldings and heap of Kernels, the Pia Matter being separated,
which clothes the hinder part of the Cerebel, easily appear in sight; for in
that place these creep upwards on either side nigh the Worm-shaped process, as
it were with two branches; and receive the Artery on either side, from the
Vertebral Artery, lying under the Basis of the oblong marrow and the veinous
passages, sent from either lateral bosom. We shall inquire hereafter into the
use of this Enfolding and of its Glandula's.

In the mean time, that we may describe the site and hanging on of the Cerebel;
the same standing on the oblong marrow seems to be fixed to its sides, as it
were by two little feet; between which, planted on either side, and the Cerebel
placed above, and the trunk of the long marrow below, (because all these should
be distinct one from the other) there comes a cavity or hollowness between,
which is commonly called the four Bellies.

In either little foot, sustaining the Brain, are found three distinct
medullary Processes. The first of these, sent from the orbicular Protuberances,
ascends obliquely; the second descending straight from the Cerebel, and passing
through the other across, compasses about the oblong marrow; the third process,
descending from the hinder Region of the Cerebel, is inserted into the oblong
marrow, and increases its trunk as it were with an additional cord or string.
These several Processes are truly represented in the seventh Table Q. P. R.

But as to what belongs to the annular or ringy Protuberance, by which the
medullary Trunk, both in Man, and in some four-footed Beasts, is compassed
about, that is made after this manner. The second or middle process of the
Cerebel, descending straight to the oblong marrow, seems not to be implanted in
it, as soon as it touches its sides, but growing into a larger bulk, goes about
the superficies of the same marrow with diverse circular Fibers. And so when in
either side both those kind of processes of the Cerebel, being dilated or
carried from the top of the medullary Trunk toward its Basis, do mutually meet,
they make that circular protuberance. The substance of this is far larger in a
Man than in any other Animal; in an Hare, Rabbet, Mouse, and the like, it is
very small; in Fowl it is either wholly wanting, or for its smalness scarce to
be discerned by the eyes. Concerning its bulk, this is a constant observation.
They who have the orbicular prominences before the Cerebel small, have this
annulary protuberance very big; and on the contrary, they who have those
prominences big or very great, have this ring very small: further, they who
wholly want the Buttock form protuberances, as in Fowl, seem also to want this
annulary.

In many brute Animals, but not in Man, nigh to this greater Protuberance, a
little lower, another lesser, in like manner orbicular, stands, and compasses
about the superficies of the oblong marrow; the root of which is a white and
medullary line, stretched out under the Cerebel, above the bottom of the fourth
Ventricle. From the sides of this lesser protuberance the auditory Nerves
arise: In Man the auditory or hearing Nerves are seen to arise out of the
utmost brim of the greater protuberance, in like manner they have for their
root a white medullary line covering the fourth Ventricle.

That this line, and the three distinct medullary Processes, which constitute
either little foot of the Cerebel, may be more plainly shown, also that the
most inward frame of the Cerebel may be viewed, its whole globe ought to be cut
through both Poles, viz. in the middle through the Vermiform or Worm-shaped
processes; then it will plainly appear, that in either Hemisphere there is an
ample middle or marrow, wherein the marrowy branches, being stretched abroad on
every side, like those of a tree, spread through the Cortical substance of the
Cerebel, every where diffused; and that in either middle or marrowy part, the
three distinct processes, which make either trunk, or little foot of the
Cerebel, are inserted. Each of these are fitly represented in the seventh Table.

Thus much for the Cerebel, and by what means it is fastened to the oblong
marrow. Beside these, it is to be observed, that about the bottom of the Basis
of the oblong marrow, out of the greater Ring, come out two medullary strings,
which being distinct from the rest of the medullary Trunk, go right forward
toward the spinal marrow, and in its progress, being made straiter by degrees,
like Pyramids, after about the space of an inch, end in sharp points. The
extremities of these consist on the other side, where the wandering pair of
Nerves have their orignal, and make a certain rising up in the oblong marrow.
Hence it is likely, that these strings are passages or channels of the animal
Spirits, wherein they are carried from the greater Ring, or what is the same
thing, from the Cerebel into the wandering pair, and the beginnings of other
Nerves implanted near; for what end, shall be said hereafter. These pyramidal
Bodies do not so manifestly appear so long as the Pia Matter clothes them, and
hides them with the infoldings of the Vessels; but this Membrane being pulled
away, they are so conspicuous, especially in a Man and a Dog, that they seem
like greater Nerves. In those Animals, where the annulary Protuberance is
greater, these processes being brought from the same in right angles, are
greater and more conspicuous; and on the contrary, in Fowl they are clearly
wanting.

Concerning this hinder Region of the Head, there is not much besides worth
noting, except the productions of the Vessels. But there are Vessels which
chiefly belong to these parts, the latter six pair of Nerves arising within the
Skull and the Vertebral Fig: III.
human brain Arteries. We have already described in some measure the beginnings
of the former; what belongs to the more full knowledge of them, we shall leave
to be handled in its proper place. As to the Vertebral Arteries, they reach
from about the farthest end of the oblong marrow, now about to end in the
spinal, to its sides. These Vessels, as they are smaller, so they enter the
Skull with lesser provision than the Carotides; for they are neither flourished
first with Net-like infoldings, nor are carried in a long journey by compassing
about; but either Artery, passing directly through the Cuniform or Wedge like
Bone, embraces the medullary Trunk on either side. Although these go forward
divided for a little space, yet afterward they are united, and with a single
chanel or passage, they meet with the posterior Carotides inclining mutually
one toward the other; and so all the branches, meeting as it were in a
threefold way, are inoculated one in another. The Vertebral Arteries, first
showing themselves within the Skull, are disposed otherwise in Brutes than in
men: in the latter they fall through the sides of the oblong marrow parallel
for some space, then as it were with a certain semicircular compass, they
mutually incline one toward the other, and presently meet. The branches which
first go forwards divided, are sometimes only two, to wit, one on either side,
sometimes three, and then besides the two former, another is produced in the
middle. But in Brutes, either Trunk of the Vertebral Artery, at the first
coming to the marrow, inclines presently to the meeting of the other with an
acute angle, and quickly both meet together. The Vertebrals, even as the
Carotides, send forth manifold branches in their progress with an innumerable
series of shoots, which cover over the oblong marrow, the Cerebel, and all
their cavities and recesses, and water them all with a plentiful flood of blood.

These are the Phenomenon or Appearances which the whole frame of the Brain and
its Appendix is wont to exhibit to Anatomical Inspection, and which, as to its
fabric, and all its parts, and processes, are to be found both within and
without. As it is a hard and troublesome business to inquire into the actions
and use of each of these, so it is also joined with so much pleasure and
profit, that I dare promise to my self and others, that it will be a thing
worth our labor and while. Yet before we enter upon this, there remain to be
unfolded some things hid in some of the bones of the Skull, such as are the
pituitary Kernels, the admirable Net, and some others; also we ought to show
first, briefly at least, a type or figure of the Brains in Fowl and Fishes.

CHAP. IV. The Parts and some of the Contents of the separated Skull unfolded.
IT is not our intent, nor will it be needful for us to delineate the figures
and situation of the several Bones of the Brain-pan, or to describe their
various holes, which transmit the Trunks of the Vessels like the hanging
weights of a Clock. All these are well enough known; so that to treat of these
Gates or Entries is superfluous. Besides also, by what means the Nerves,
arising within the Skull with their ramification or branching forth, enter the
dens and caverns of the Bones, shall be delivered particularly afterward.
Wherefore for the present our business shall be only to take notice of some
things, chiefly worth noting, concerning the sanguiferous Vessels passing
through the Cuniform or Wedge-like Bone, not sufficiently noted by others.

Among the various uses and offices which the Cuniform or Wedge-like Bone
yields to the Brain and its Appendix, it is not of the least note or moment,
that it transmits the Carotidick Arteries, not without a certain mechanical or
artificial provision; and that in the middle way, by which they must pass, it
contains the pituitary Kernel, and sometimes the wonderful Net. Each of these
deserve consideration; the more, for that in diverse Animals they are after a
different manner; and because it is much controverted among Physicians
concerning their frame and use. But we will first speak of the pituitary
Glandula, because this part, being placed higher, is observable to Anatomical
Inspection before others.

The pituitary Glandula or snotty Kernel is hid within a proper Cell or stall,
made hollow in the middle of the Wedge-like Bone, being shut up in the Chest
sometimes Fig. IIII
brain of a foolish youth more strictly, sometimes more loosly: For in a Dog,
Cat, and some other Creatures, sticking to the Tunnel, it is pulled away
together with it when it is removed; and then its bulk consists of two
Glandula's or Kernels distinct among themselves, and easily to be separated one
from another. But in a Calf, Sheep, Hog, and many others, it is strictly
included on every side, except where it admits the Tunnel, and clothed with the
hard Meninx or dura Matter, and with its coverings shut up between the cavity of
the bone. Besides, in these, its frame or substance seems but one and
undivided, though, in truth, it is made up of a substance which is of a twofold
nature or kind.

This Glandula is found in all perfect Creatures; for Man, all four-footed
Beasts, yea Fowl and Fishes are provided or endued with it: from whence we may
conclude it to have some necessary uses in the Brain. But as to its quantity or
bigness, its proportion is various in diverse Animals, according to the bigness
of the head and body wherein it is; because in a Lamb it is greater than in a
Man or a Dog; also its bulk in a Horse is lesser than in an Ox. But the reason
of this difference seems to consist in this chiefly, for that the pituitary
Glandula in some, respects the bulk of the brain only laid upon it, and in
others both the brain and the Carotidick Arteries ascending near it; and so as
it has a respect to both these together, or only to one, its substance or bulk
is either greater or lesser. For truly in some Animals the Carotidick Arteries
being dilated within the Skull, are presently divaricated into Net-like
infoldings, and from those infoldings many shoots of the Vessels every where
enter this Glandula, and are interwoven into its substance. Further, because
this enfolding of the Vessels, called the wonderful Net, is found very large in
some, and in others very small; therefore this Kernel, for as much as it admits
from these, few branches, and from those far more, and in some other Animals
scarce any shoots from the Arteries, answers to this diverse distributions of
the Vessels, with the various proportion of its bulk. Because it is observed in
some Animals, as chiefly in a Man and a Horse, that this wonderful Net is
wholly wanting; and whereas in such, either Artery is carried about by a long
compass between the recesses of this bone; from its trunk in a man sometimes
one or two shoots, sometimes none, are carried into the pituitary Kernel; also
in an Horse fewre branches enter into it, and so its bulk in these becomes
lesser.

But in very many other Animals (especially those who have the wonderful Net)
it may be proved, besides ocular inspection, also by this Experiment, that many
sanguiferous Vessels enter this Glandula: for if an inky liquor be squirted
into the Carotides with a Syringe, the exterior part of the Glandula, that is
interwoven with the blood-carrying Vessels, will be very much dyed with a black
color. Wherefore without doubt, it may be thought, that this Glandula does
receive into it self the humors, to wit, flowing into it from the Tunnel in all
kind of living Creatures, and in some from the branches of the Carotides. Yet
by which way these humors are carried away again, does not so plainly appear;
for we affirm, with the most Learned Schneider, that they do not at all fall
down into the Palate through the holes of the under-lying bone. Yet in the mean
time, we suppose those holes to be only made to procure lightness to the bone;
because in those Animals, which have the greater pituitary Kernel, those holes
in the bone are more and larger: further, I have often found vessels or channels
to be contained between those holes: and when I had injected Ink within the
great hole of the same bone in a Calf, the black liquor presently entered the
lesser Vessels subject to the bone, and at last the Jugular Vein. And by this
Experiment chiefly we conjecture concerning the office and duty of this
Glandula; of which we shall speak more fully hereafter, when we inquire into
the use of this and the Tunnel.

Nigh to either side of the pituitary Kernel, if the dura Matter be opened, the
Carotidick Artery lies stretched out upon the wedge-like bone, about the length
of an inch: for as this Artery rises up below the Turkey Chair, sometimes
higher, sometimes farther within the Skull; the same being presently bent in
from its first ascent, goes in under the dura Matter till it comes to the
anterior border of the same Chair; where again being intorted, and being sent
forth upwards with a certain compass, it perforates the hard Meninx, and is
carried straight toward the Brain. So this Vessel with its double ascent and
crookedness (to wit, above the Basis of the Skull, and then above the hard
Meninx, together with its situation, stretched out in length under the same)
represents in most the letter inversed; but in a man (as shall hereafter be
more largely shown) its site, by reason of the longer tract of the Vessel and
its greater curvature, represents the same letter double after this manner.

The Carotidick Artery in all Animals ascends obliquely within the Skull; but
as to its site or protension nigh the pituitary Glandula, it is not after the
same manner in all: for in a man passing through the Canal-bone, peculiarly
engraven by it, with a single Trunk, it lies every where stretched out at
length; and out of this Trunk it sends forth sometimes, though not always, some
shoots to the pituitary Glandula. Also in a Horse, its Trunk is single; but
where it first arises within the Skull, either Carotides, through the cross
branches sent from one side to the other, before they perforate the dura Matter,
communicate among themselves. And as in most other living Creatures, the
Artery, however before branched forth, yet being made one single Trunk, goes
into the Brain; in a Horse either Carotick Artery being parted in two, sends
forth upwards two branches, arising from the dura Matter, in two distinct places.

In a Dog, Fox, Sheep, Calf, Stag, and many other four-footed beasts, either of
the Carotides, whilst hid within the Skull under the dura Matter, being divided
into small shoots, and complicated with other Vessels, to wit, both Veins and
nervous Fibers, constitutes the Net-like infoldings; which infoldings, being
stretched out on either side of the Turkey Chair, fill the cavity there
existing; then after manifold divarications of all the Vessels, some arterious
shoots being disintangled from the others, and again united, grow together into
one Trunk, which boring through the dura Matter, pailes straight into the Brain.

The aforesaid Enfolding is, commonly called the wonderful Net, and that
deservedly, for there is nothing in the whole fabric of the animal Body more
worthy of admiration; in which, besides the arterious little branches which
proceed from either of the ascending Carotides, the veinous shoots, though
fewer, meet with those descending from the inward Jugular branches; and both
kinds of Vessels being divided into small shoots, like a bundle of twisted
silk, are variously folded together: which complications of the Vessels however
are sustained by the nervous Fibers, supplied from the greater Trunk of the
fifth pair of Nerves. The aforesaid enfolding of the Vessels or wonderful Net
in some Animals is far greater, and contains much more divarications of the
Vessels than it has in others; for in a Calf, Sheep, Goat, which are fed with
grass, its frame is larger than in a Dog, Cat, and other flesh-eating and
hotter Brutes. Further, it is observable, where the wonderful Net is greater,
that the enfolding of one side is ingrafted into the enfolding of the other
opposite side, and that from both, many more shoots of the Vessels do enter
into the pituitary Kernel; so indeed, that if you shall inject Ink into the
Trunk of the Artery below the Skull, the Vessels on either side, or the
infoldings, will be dyed with the same tincture, and the black liquor will flow
out of the Trunk of the opposite Artery.

In truth we have often seen this kind of Experiment repeated. Let the
Carotidick Arteries be laid bare on either side of the Cervix or the hinder
part of the Head, so that their little Tubes or Pipes, about half an inch long,
may be exhibited together to the sight; then let a dyed liquor, and contained
in a large Squirt or Pipe, be injected upwards in the trunk of one side: after
once or twice injecting, you shall see the tincture or dyed liquor to descend
from the other side by the trunk of the opposite Artery: yea, if the same be
more copiously injected toward the Head, from thence returning through the
Artery of the opposite side, it will go through below the Praecordia, even to
the lower Region of the Body; when in the mean time, little or nothing of the
same tincture is carried through the outward and greater Jugular Veins. Then the
Head being opened, all the Arteries, before the entrance of the Head, and the
Veins of the same band with them, will be imbued with the color of the same
injected liquor. Further, in the Vessels which constitute the wonderful Net,
and which cover the Basis of the Brain, some footsteps of the same tincture
will appear. But that this liquor does descend so plentifully by the opposite
Artery, and not by the Jugular Vein, either associate or opposite, the reason
is, because it cannot enter those Veins, unless the region of the whole Brain,
being first passed through, it had entered the bosom; but the liquor being
plentifully injected, could not so suddenly pass through the very small Vessels
covering the Brain: wherefore rather than the force should be carried to the
Brain by the violent impulse of the liquor, it, returning from the injection,
and otherwise threatening a flood to the Brain, finds the way of receding also
by the opposite Arteries, for that end, both before they enter the Brain, and
after they have entered it, communicating among themselves. And here we cannot
sufficiently admire so provident (and to be equalled by no mechanical Art)
Figura V.
interior base of a human skull a dispensation of the blood within the confines
of the Brain. For in as much as the Carotidick Arteries do communicate between
themselves in various places, and are mutually ingrafted; from thence a double
benefit results, though of a contrary effect: because by this one and the same
means care is taken, both lest the brain should be defrauded of its due watring
of the blood, and also lest it should be overwhelmed by the too impetuous
flowing of the swelling stream or torrent. As to the first, lest that should
happen, one of the Carotides perhaps being obstructed, the other might supply
the provision of both; then, lest the blood rushing with too full a torrent,
should drown the channels and little Ponds of the brain, the flood is chastised
or hindered by an opposite Emissary, as it were a Flood-gate, and so is
commanded to return its flood, and haste backward by the same ways, and to run
back with an ebbing Tide.

By this kind of provision the Arteries about to enter the Brain are provided:
yea, and the passages of the Veins, destinated for the returning of the blood
from thence, seem also to be disposed with a wonderful artifice. For when the
anterior bosoms transfer their load into the two Laterals, which are the
posterior, and they themselves end in the Jugular Veins, it is observed, that
those latter bosoms have furrows or cavities insculped whereby they may settle
or rest upon the hinder part of the Head: and whenas either bosom, through a
proper hole, being about to go into the Jugular Vein, slides out of the Skull;
nigh that hole, in the outward part of the Skull, a round and ample den is made
hollow, and covered over by the extremity on either side of the same bosom,
enlarged into a greater capacity, to the end, that the blood, whilst it slides
forth out of the Head with a full torrent, should not rush into the Veins with
too rapid and vertiginous an influx, and so make a forcible entry on the Heart
it self, therefore it has here a diversion large enough, in which estuating or
boiling up, till a more free and open space may be granted to its course, it
may be staid without any trouble. Certainly there can be nothing more
artificial thought upon, and that can better argue the Providence of the great
Creator, than this fit or convenient disposition of the blood in the brain, and
without it, and the way of its reciprocation in diverse Animals, accommodated to
the necessity of every one. And lastly, in the dissection of Beasts, other
miracles of the same nature happen, whereby showing the finger and Divine
workmanship of the Deity, a most strong and invincible Argument may be opposed
to the most perverse Atheist.

CHAP. V. The Brains of Fowls and Fishes described.
WHat hitherto we have shown concerning the description of the Brain and its
Appendix, we chiefly owe to the observations made of the dissection of the
Heads of a Man and of four-footed Beasts. We shall now proceed to the
commenting upon these Observations; to wit, that we may endeavor, from the
fabric rightly considered of the parts of the Brain, so described, to erect
their offices and uses, and so to design the government of the animal Function:
But because a compared Anatomy may yield us a more full and exact Physiology of
the Use of Parts; therefore before I enter upon this task, it will seem worth
our labor to inquire into the Heads of some other Animals, to wit, of Fowls
and Fishes.

We have already hinted, that the Brains of Men and of four-footed Beasts, were
alike in most things; and also that the contents in the Heads of Fowls and
Fishes being far different from both the former, yet as to the chief parts of
the Head, are found to have between themselves an agreement. The kinds of
either Animals being coetaneous, and as it were Twins from the Creation of the
World, do testify their affinity in nothing more than in the fabric of the
Brain. That it is so in Man and four-footed Beasts plainly appears already: we
shall now see if that the Anatomy of Fowls and Fishes will show us any thing
worthy of note.

That we may begin with Fowls; the covering of the Skull being taken off, the
hard Meninx or Membrane embraces strictly the bulk or mole contained within. In
the midst of it, where the brain is divided into two Hemispheres, it has a
bosom stretched out at length, which notwithstanding, no Falx (or Scythe) being
let down between the interstices, is inserted less deeply in the brain: then,
where this Membrane distinguishes between the brain and the Cerebel, two
lateral bosoms are formed. Besides, in Fowls there is a fourth bosom, which
has its place a little more backward than in a man or four-footed beasts; for
a little below the pineal Kernel a hollow and smooth process of the hard Meninx
is sent down upon the shanks of the oblong marrow, where presently it is
divided into two branches, on either side whereof it sends forth one upwards
into the cavity between the streaked Membrane and Fig: VIa
interior base of a calf skull the Hemisphere of the brain, planted in the
hinder part of the brain.

This superior Membrane or hard Meninx being cut off, and separated round about
the Pia Matter, appears very thin, which is not, as in man or other perfect
Creatures, marked with such frequent infoldings of the Vessels; but this most
subtle Meninx being made of a texture of Fibers, only clothes, and every where
intimately binds about the even and plain superficies of the brain contained
within, and wholly destitute of turnings and windings about.

The fabric of the brain in Fowls is otherwise than in man or four-footed
beasts: for besides that in its compass the inequalities and the turnings and
windings are wholly wanting; also more inwardly, the callous body and the
Fornix, as also the chamfered bodies, which we described before, are all
lacking: and besides, the substance of the brain it self is figured after
another manner. That these may the better be beheld, make the dissection of the
brain of a Goose or a Turky-Cock; and the Membranes being cut off, by pressing
lightly the fissure or cleft of the brain, you may divide the middle of it one
from another, and go forward to separate it, till you come to its bosom, in
which place are two marrowy bodies, which being stretched out like Nerves,
connect the Hemispheres one to another. Either side of the Interstitium or the
space between, is clothed with a whitish Membrane, which is marked with streaks
or beams, lying or running from the whole compass or circumference, to the
lower corner; and these streaks concenter about the insertions of the medullary
bodies. Then, if this Membrane be cut, in either Hemisphere of the brain, there
will appear underneath a cavity, which goes under the whole space, from the
side of the Interstitium, and for a great part, the hinder region of the brain,
and is arched or chambered with that streaked Membrane. Either cavity or
hollowness, about the bottom, is opened into an intermediate or common passage,
which lies open to the Tunnel; and from either side of this passage the shanks
of the oblong marrow are stretched out, to which, on either side, the
Hemisphere of the brain is hung by two medullary bodies; to wit, one marrowy or
medullary body goes out from the mole or substance of the brain lying under the
Ventricle, the other from the streaked Membrane covering the Ventricle. From
these two, placed on either side, the medullary bodies being stretched out
cross-wise, like Nerves, join the two Hemispheres of the brain to one another.
Besides, these two growing together on either side, fix either Hemisphere of
the brain to the shanks of the oblong marrow.

So the figure of the Brain in Fowl, if you compare it with the brain in men
and of the more perfect four-footed beasts, seems to be as it were inversed.
For as in these the Cortical part is outward, and the medullary laid under it;
so in Fowls, the lower frame of the brain, which consists of a thick and closer
substance, is instead of the Cortex or shell; but the outmost and upper
Membrane, chambering the Ventricle, appears medullar or marrowy above any other
part. Moreover, the Ventricles in the brains of a man and four-footed beasts
are placed beneath, and near the bottom; in Fowls, above and nigh the outward
border. The reason of this difference seems to be, because in a more perfect
brain, such as is in man and four-footed beasts, the animal Spirits have both
their birth and exercise; viz. they are procreated in its Cortical or shelly
part, and in its medullary, which being large enough, lies under this, they are
circulated and variously expanded for the acting of their faculties. But truly
in the brain of Fowls there is space enough for the generation of Spirits, but
for their circulation there is scarce any left: to wit, the brains of Birds
seem not to be much possessed with the gifts of fantasy or memory: yea it is
thought, that the Spirits begotten in the brain are exercised chiefly in the
oblong marrow for the preserving the animal function; for there, as we shall
show anon, the medullary substance, which is instead of the callous body,
consists; and like the streaked bodies in others, in these are streaked
Membranes, through which the Spirits, procreated in the brain, are carried,
without any order there, forthwith into the oblong marrow: but because the
Spirits, begot in the brain, ought to lay aside a serous excrement; therefore
the Ventricles, from the complicature of the streaked Membrane upon the keel or
lower part of the brain, and on the shanks of the oblong marrow it self, do
serve conveniently enough for this business. Notwithstanding, because in the
brains of Fowls, the Fornix is wholly wanting, there are only two anterior
Ventricles; between which, the Choroeides enfolding is stretched out; the
veinous portion whereof, as was but now said, arises a little lower from the
fourth bosom; but the Arteries ascending, come from either side of the oblong
marrow.

Nor is there a greater heterogeneity or difference of conformation in the
Brain it self of Fowls, than in the oblong marrow from the same in men and
four-footed beasts. For in the first Section, from whence the Optic Nerves
arise, two noted protuberances grow to either side. These are much greater in
proportion than the orbicular prominences in the more perfect Creatures; so
that they seem another additional brain: either of them of a white color, and
purely marrowy, is hollow within; so that in these kind of Animals are found
two bellies or Ventricles in the brain, and as many in the oblong marrow. And
seeing in these, as in all other Animals, a cavity is put under the Cerebel,
the Ventricles in the whole Head differ as well in number as in figure and
position.

In the middle of the medullary Trunk, to wit, where those prominences grow to
its sides, the Chink, leading to the Tunnel, is cut, but into it the aperture
of either Ventricle gapes or opens, that it is not to be doubted, but that the
serosities heaped up there, are sent out by that way. Moreover it is likely,
that these hollow and medullary prominences in Fowls supply the course of the
callous body, to wit, in which the animal Spirits are circulated for the
exercising their faculties: because in the brain the space is so narrow, that
the Spirits cannot be produced and circulated together within its confines.
Further, as in Fowls, the use of the animal Spirits is required for the act of
the sensitive and loco-motive faculty, more than for fantasy or memory;
certainly the chief place where they may meet and be exercised, ought to be
placed rather in the oblong marrow than in the brain.

The Carotidick Arteries, which carry the blood to the brains of the greater
Birds, are so small, that there is no proportion of these to the same in man
and four-footed beasts. Their Trunks being carried within the Skull, ascend
without any branchings into net-like infoldings, after the same manner as in
other Animals, nigh to the pituitary Glandula, and pass right into the brain,
and distribute some small shoots of the Vessels both to its exterior compass,
and through its inward recesses. But in truth, the brains of Birds are watered
with a very small portion of blood, in respect of other living Creatures;
because, where the fancy or imagination is little exercised, there is not much
blood required for the refreshing the animal Spirits.

Fowl (otherwise than some affirm) have both the mammillary processes, and the
Cribrous or Sieve-like bone. For the anterior productions of the brain being
highly extenuated and involved with the dura Matter, stretching out almost to
the middle part of the bill, are inserted into the triangular bone, which has
a double bosom, distinguished between with a thin mound or pale. But these
processes being dilated within the bosom of the aforesaid bone, and in Bladders
full of clear water, which are very like the mammillary processes in a Calf,
full of clear water. Besides, as out of the fifth pair of Nerves, a noted
branch on either side passing through the ball of the Eye, enters into the
cavern of the Nostril, a shoot of it being sent out of the Trunk, is bestowed
to the very orifice of the Nostrils; in the mean time, both the greater Trunks,
compassing about the Cribrous bone, meet together, and presently going one from
the other, and being carried to the end of the bill, are distributed into the
palate. After this manner Fowls, even as men and four-footed beasts, are
furnished with a peculiar organ of smelling, to wit, with a double mammillary
process; and besides, they have within the Nostrils additional Nerves out of
the fifth pair, by whose action and communication of branches into other parts,
and among themselves, so strict an affinity is contracted between the smell and
the taste. The other pairs of Nerves are almost after the same manner as in men
and four-footed beasts. In like manner we also observe, that there is no great
difference as to the Cerebel and the other portion of the oblong marrow,
between Birds and the other Animals we have already considered on, unless that
the orbicular prominences before the Cerebel, and the other annulary under it,
meeting within them, are both wanting in Fowls; indeed these latter seem not at
all to be required; but instead of the former, they are easily supplied from
the hollow medullary prominences, such as we have shown to be in Fowls.

And these are what are chiefly worth noting to be found in the brains of
Fowls. We have already mentioned, that there is a certain likeness between
these and Fishes as to the most parts of the head: wherefore it will seem to be
to the purpose, that here for a conclusion we should say something of the brain
of Fishes. First, we shall observe, that as the heads of Fishes, in respect of
the whole body, are greater than of any other living Creatures, yet they
contain in them less brain than others. For two little moles or substances,
placed before, sustain the whole place of the brain, properly so called; out of
these, two signal smelling Nerves proceed, which are carried by a long and
straight journey to the holes made hollow, out of either side of the mouth, and
which are instead of nostrils: and this is singular to Fishes. Moreover, we
advertise concerning the Optic Nerves, that they, as in other living
Creatures, inclining mutually one to the other, are not however united, unless
perhaps toward the superficies; but they are crossed, and a Nerve arising from
the right side of the oblong marrow, is carried into the left Eye, and so on
the contrary: so indeed, that the visory rays have their refraction, not only
in the Eye, but within the very bodies of the Nerves. The oblong marrow in
Fishes, wholly after the like manner as in Birds, has two signal protuberances
hollowed within; and in truth, as to local motions, the Spirits in either seem
to the exercised after the like mode. For as Fishes swim in the water, so the
flying of Fowls or Birds seems a certain kind of swimming in the Air. Further,
in these it is observable, there are the pituitary Kernel, the Tunnel, and the
Carotidick Arteries as in other Animals; also many pairs of the Nerves have the
same origines and distributions, excepting that the hearing Nerves are here
wanting; although Casserus Placentinus attributes this gift to the smelling
Nerves. The figure of the Cerebel is the same as in more perfect Animals.
Besides, what we have remarked concerning the wandering pair of Nerves in man
and four-footed beasts; to wit, many fibers of it arising together, the trunk
of the Nerve from the spinal marrow comes to them: in like manner the same is
in Fishes. But to describe them all further is needless: for the rest, as those
which are proper to them only and Birds, as also those which they have common
with Fowls and the more perfect Animals, may be easily known, partly out of the
peculiar similitude with birds, and partly out of the universal Analogy of all.
Therefore we will now philosophise upon the Use and Action of the Brain and its
Parts, and of its Appendix, together with the whole economy of the animal
Function: where in the first place, we will inquire into the offices of a more
perfect Brain, such as of man and four-footed beasts; and also secondarily and
collaterally we shall explain the Offices and Actions of a less perfect Brain,
and of its Parts, such as that of Fowls and Fishes.

CHAP. VI. Of the Offices of the Brain and its Parts: where first of all the
Uses of the Skull and the hard Meninx or Dura Matter is treated of.
THE Poets feigned Pallas to be formed within the Brain of Jupiter, and from
thence to be born. In truth, within the Womb of the Brain all the Conceptions,
Ideas, Forces, and Powers whatsoever both of the Rational and Sensitive Soul
are framed; and having there gotten a species and form, are produced into act.
Wherefore it will be worth our labor to inquire into these places, of the
generation of these more noble faculties, and the first rise and primitive
beginnings of them, as also more curiously to consider the diverse parts of the
Brain, or the Organs serving to their Generation: And I go about this part of
my labor the more willingly, that I may by handling the thread of our
dissection again, bring all the Phenomenon, before given to our inspection and
sense, before the Eye of Reason, and to be again weighed by a more severe
Examination of Discourse; at least those things which seem to be of the greater
moment, and chiefly worth taking notice of. Neither do we think here to heap up
into a great Volume the several things worn out by the handling of others, and
offered to common observation.

Therefore recollecting the Anatomy of the Brain, the first things to be
considered are its coverings, to wit, the Skull, and the two Meninxes or
Matters. Concerning the first it is observed, that all perfect Animals have an
hard and bony Skull. A double reason for which may be given: First, that the
Head being destinated for the most noble use, might be protected with a more
firm and not easily penetrable covering, as a natural Helmet, against the
injuries of external strokes; besides secondly, as this is in the place of
Armor, so also of a Cloister; because the same covering the dura Matter within,
may restrain and keep within the Brain the Effluvia's of the animal Spirits,
lest they should too thickly evaporate, or in heaps. Further, as the Skull for
these ends is made bony, the efficient cause are the saline Particles of the
blood watering the brain, which being unprofitable to the interior work of the
animal Spirits, and so to be sent away outwardly, grow together thus in the
circumference, and are congealed into a stony hardness: For indeed the blood
being carried toward the Head, as it abounds very much in Spirit, so in Salt;
its Particles highly volatile, being joined to the Spirits, are bestowed on the
brain; in the mean time, the saline little bodies, which are of a more fixed
nature, being thrust out into the circumference, from the Spirit implanted in
the Brain, constitute the stony Skull, as it were a bubble covering enclosed
wind.

Within the hollow superficies of the Skull, there appear many furrows and
inequalities imprinted by the protuberances of the Vessels; and we perceive
frequently either border or plate of it to be perforated by the passing through
of the Vessels in several places: but the Arteries, arising in the exterior
superficies of the dura Matter, make these kind of little ditches through the
concavity of the Skull. For when the whole substance of the brain is at first
soft, and easily giving place, like Wax; the Arteries underneath it continually
beating, as it hardens by degrees, easily imprint the marks of their tracts.

The figure of the Skull in four-footed beasts is narrow and pressed down, but in
man, the substance of whose brain is large, there is required a more capacious
and almost spherical figure. For as God gave him an upright countenance to
behold the Heavens, and also endued his brain with an immortal Soul, and fitted
for the speculation of Heaven; therefore his face is erect or lifted up: so the
brain it self is placed in a more eminent place, to wit, above the Cerebel and
all the Sensories. But in Brutes, and such whose faces are prone toward the
Earth, and have a brain unfit for speculation, the Cerebel, however serving to
the more noted action and office of the Praecordia, is placed in the highest
seat to which the mole of the brain is subjected. Besides, some organs of the
Senses, to wit, the Ears and Eyes, if they be not superior, they are placed at
least equal to the brain. In an humane Head, the Basis of the Brain and Cerebel
being placed nigh together, yea of the whole Skull, is made parallel to the
Horizon; whereby it comes to pass, that there is less danger for any portion of
the Head to be jogged here and there, or to be moved out of its proper seat:
But in four-footed beasts, who go with an hanging down head, the Basis of the
Skull makes a right angle with the Horizon; wherefore the brain being
subjected, the Cerebel is put in the highest place; so indeed, that this seems
less stable, and that it may shake, or be moved from its seat. However against
this inconvenience, lest a frequent concussion of the Cerebel might induce a
sinking down or loss of the Spirits, or irregularities about the Praecordia, in
some it is taken care of by a wonderful artifice of Nature; for as in all the
frame or substance of the Cerebel is most strictly bound fast together by the
dura Matter, besides in some it is staid by a bony fence; but in others, as in a
Hare, Rabbet, and other lesser Brutes, a certain portion of the Cerebel is
included on either side by a stony bone, and so by this double hold its whole
bulk or substance is firmly tied to the Skull. Concerning the chief bones of
the Skull, viz. the Cuniform or Wedge-like bone, the Cribrous or Sieve-like
bone, and the auditory or hearing Organ, they shall be spoken of in their
proper places, when we come to treat particularly of the Ventricles of the
Brain, and of the Senses to which these bones serve. We shall pass next to the
hard Meninx or dura Matter.

The dura Matter or hard Meninx, formed of a double kind of Vessels and
Processes, bears also a double Aspect, and owes part of its office to the
Skull, that is about it, and part to the Encephalon contained within it. The
exterior processes of this Membrane are insinuated within all the bosoms and
cavities of the Skull; to some whereof they are a covering and defense, but to
others they impart a sensible force; which manifestly appears in the Sieve-like
bone, through whose holes the fringes of this Membrane passing, conduce
something to the sense of smelling. Also the productions of this, lying over
the recesses and caverns of the Wedge-like bone, fortify the ways for the
entrance and coming out of the Vessels. The interior processes of the dura
Matter, which belong to the Head, divide and distinguish between the parts of
the brain and Cerebel; and in those places the dura Matter is very thick, lest
in any great concussion of the Head, these two should be smitten one against
another, and should press one upon the other. Wherefore in Dogs (as we have
already hinted) who are wont to run violently with their heads down, there is
sent down between these bodies a bony fence. In like manner in a Cat, Horse,
Fox, and many other Animals, from whose manner of living and use it is
required, that they be moved with a swift motion, that bony fence, commonly
called the Triangular Bone, is sent down deeply between the Brain and the
Cerebel; yea, and all the bosoms pass through that bone in the holes curiously
made hollow in it.

The Vessels belonging to the dura Matter are either Arteries, that carry the
blood thither; or they are Veins, which receiving from thence the superfluous
blood, and from the whole Head besides, return it toward the Heart. As to the
first sort of Vessels, on either side, two Arteries arising from the Carotidick
Artery on the same side, before it comes to the Basis of the Brain, are carried
into the dura Matter: which notwithstanding, only possessing the exterior
superficies or unequal part, carry blood and juice to this Membrane, also in
some measure to the Skull and its coverings. As to the Vessels carrying the
blood back, this Meninx contains four, into which, as into a great Sea, all the
Rivulets of the Arteries, serving the whole Head, do exonerate themselves: to
wit, there are observed in this Membrane four noted Cavities, commonly called
Bosoms; which are disposed after that manner, that, like Promptuaries or
Storehouses framed in several places, they receive the blood returning from
every region and corner of the brain: For the third bosom, or the longitudinal,
looks toward the anterior brain, the fourth toward its middle; but the first
and second admit the blood flowing back from the Cerebel and hinder part of the
brain. Further, out of these the third and fourth disburden themselves into the
first and second; and these at length transfer their burden into the Jugular
Veins. On every side, from these bosoms, the lesser Vessels, viz. the channels
of the Veins are sent forth, which going out nigh the interior or concave
superficies of the dura Matter, are presently inserted into the Pia Matter, and
following its protension, being distributed through the whole compass, and all
the interior recesses of the brain and its Appendix within the Skull, and being
complicated with the Arteries, receive the superfluous blood, and carry it into
those greater cavities. That it is so, it plainly appears, because if you
squirt a liquor, dyed with Ink, into the Pipe of the Artery, that passing
through the arterious shoots, and then the veinous, goes through at last into
the bosoms.

Whilst the blood, returning from the whole interior Head, is collected within
those bosoms, as with a full belly, it seems also in another respect to be of a
very notable use; to wit, for the supplying of heat, requisite for the
distilling forth of the animal Spirits, as if it were a certain Chemical
operation. For as much as the blood to be distilled, is contained in the
Vessels, interwoven into the Pia Matter, the superior Rivers diffused on every
side through the dura Matter, the heat being brought to it like a Balneum
Mariae, flow about the underlying blood, and so force out of it a most subtle
Liquor into the substance of the Brain; or rather, the blood raising up heat
within the bosoms, is like the fire of suppression, which in the distillation
by descent, is inkindled round about the Vessel containing the matter to be
distilled. For indeed the interior substance of the Brain, for that it is
endued with plenty of Salt and very little Sulphur, is of a more frigid temper:
wherefore, that from the blood watering its superficies, the spirituous part
may be stilled forth, and forced into its middle or marrow, the degree of the
ambient heat ought to be made the more strong, such indeed, as the blood
collected in the ample Estuaries of the bosoms, may easily afford. Further, as
those bosoms being distended with heated blood, are like a certain distillatory
Bath; so the other Membrane of the dura Matter being stretched out about the
whole Head, is like an impervious Alembick, which with its covering keeps
within the spirituous breaths, that they may not be immoderately evaporated.

Concerning this Membrane there may yet be considered, with what motion or
sense it is endued. And as to sense, it is not to be doubted, but that it has
it exquisitely: For since all the Membranes have feeling, and owe that faculty
to the afflux of the animal Spirits from the Brain, surely this Meninx, for
that it is nearer and very much of kin to the Brain and its Appendix, so that
it clothes very many Nerves going out of the Skull, it obtains a very accurate
virtue of feeling: which thing also may be argued from the effect; because the
pains of the Head often proceed from the breach of unity excited in this
Membrane. But that it has motion, it can hardly be thought, because it is tied
in very many places to the Skull; and yet it is probable, that the same may
sometimes, in some parts at least, be contracted and wringled or drawn
together: And certainly there is no doubt, that it is contracted and remitted
in sneesing. In like manner, when from an hurt of this a Vomiting or Convulsive
motions follow in the Viscera or Members, this Membrane is the cause, which
being somewhere contracted or divided, infolds with it self the substance
contained within with the same Convulsion or Spasm.

Concerning the motion of this Membrane, a curious mind may yet further
consider its texture, and especially how it is within the cavities of the
bosoms, and the Interstitium or separation of the Brain and Cerebel. For in
these places are found many Fibers, or as it were greater or nervous cords or
strings, such as we have observed to be variously stretched out in the
Ventricles of the Heart. Within the bosoms, from the various processes of the
Membrane, a cavity full of turnings and windings, and manifoldly divided, as it
were with many little Cells, is constituted. This seems to be thus made, to
this end, to wit, that the blood returning back from diverse little rivers into
the cavities of the bosoms, may be retarded by several obstacles, as it were
little floodgates; lest perhaps rushing too impetuously and by heaps, it might
flow within this Sea with a vertiginous and inordinate motion. But there is
observed, besides these intrications and little cells of this Meninx in the
heads of four-footed beasts, that moreover in the whole cavity of the bosoms,
very many cords, as it were Ligaments, are every where produced from one side
to the other. The office of these is partly, that they may contain the sides of
the cavity within their due ends of aperture and dilation, lest they should be
distended above measure by the vehement rushing in of the blood, and so may
press upon the substance of the brain. Yea the contexture of these whitish
Fibers, which are met with, both within the cavities of the bosoms, and in this
Meninx, going about the Cerebel, and distinguishing between it and the Brain,
seems to intimate, that they serve also to some motion. For it may be
suspected, that those strong Fibers, and as it were Ligaments, do sometimes
contract, sometimes dilate, and variously draw the Membrane to which they are
knit. From these kind of motions of the dura Matter, the blood flowing within
the bosoms, may be variously agitated, and as occasion serves, sometimes
hastened in its Circle, and sometimes restrained or hindered; for in many
affections of the sensitive Soul, the blood being disturbed from its equal
circulation, is sometimes precipitated by heaps and impetuously to the Heart,
and sometimes detained from its nest longer, nigh the confines of the Brain.
But that various whirlwinds of passions stir up such irregularities in the
motion of the blood, the nervous parts implanted about the Praecordia, are in
some measure the cause, which by contracting or dilating the same, variously
moderate the course of the blood; yet so, that in the mean time, some part of
this office is due from the brain it self, or at least to its Appendix. Indeed
the brain it self wants motion; but the blood passing through its substance,
for as much as it is poured wholly in this Meninx, and passes through its
receptacles, is at the motion and beck of this Membrane, sometimes driven away
from the brain, and commanded to succor the Heart, as in fear and great
sadness, sometimes being hastened toward the brain, is for some time
prohibited from flowing back, as in shame, indignation, and some other
affections.

Truly, that these kind of interior processes of the bosoms, and as it were
transverse strings or cords, do conduce to the more commodious reduction of the
blood, we gather also from hence, that in working beasts, whose brain (because
they feed and go with a prone and hanging down head) is in greater danger of an
inundation of the blood, those processes are very big, for that they being
successively contracted, may leisurely thrust out the blood, apt otherwise to
stagnate by reason of the inclination of the head. Neither is it from the
purpose to observe here, that these same Animals are always furnished, for that
reason, with a greater wonderful Net: by which means indeed it is provided,
that the blood may not too much invade the brain by heaps; as care is taken by
the artifice but now described, lest the same should make too long stay in the
brain, and so oppress its more weak frame.

Therefore in the last place, that I may recollect what I have said of the dura
Matter, and rehearse its chief uses: First, It covers over the Skull within, and
reaches to it somewhat of nourishment by the Vessels. Secondly, It is a
covering to the whole head, and serves to distinguish its chief parts. Thirdly,
It contains the Vessels designed for the reducing the blood from the whole
interior head; which, in the mean time, by reason of the plenty of the blood
contained in them, and the opportunity of their situation, administer requisite
heat for the distillation of the Spirits. Fourthly, It provides ways for the
admission and going out of all the Vessels within the Skull, and fortifies
them; to which may be added, that it bestows on some of them their Coats, as
shall be shown anon. Fifthly and lastly, This Meninx being here and there
contracted or divided by the animal Spirits variously moved, according to the
passions of the Soul, or the necessities of Nature, stays the blood sometimes
longer near the confines of the Brain, sometimes drives it forward from thence
toward the Praecordia.

CHAP. VII. Of the thinner Meninx or Pia Matter, of its stretching out, as also
of the Infoldings of the Vessels every where interwoven with it.
THE interior Meninx or Pia Matter is far thinner than the exterior, and
consists of a most subtle contexture of Fibers. This does not compass about the
Encephalon's superficies as loosly as the Dura Matter; but embraces it so very
strictly, that it is very hardly separated from it: besides, it insinuates it
self into all its turnings and windings and furrows, and clothes their inward
parts. Further, this Meninx, although it be thin, yet being covered over
throughout with the infoldings of Arteries and Veins, is interwoven with them,
and so waters all the spaces of the Brain and Cerebel with innumerable rivers.
For as the Region of either of these, especially of the Brain, is full of
turnings and windings, this Membrane in like manner grows to the deep furrows
of the crankling turnings about, and also to the tops of the ridges; yea, the
chief complications of the Vessels are still placed in the valleys, as if they
were there hid in regard of their safety. Neither does this Meninx only cover
the gapings of the turnings and windings about; but also gathers together the
tops or heights of all their interstices or places between, and knits them
together, and so makes the whole superficies of the Head plain, globous, and as
it were like the World.

That the diffusion of this wonderful Membrane into all the turnings and
windings of the Brain, and the distribution of the Vessels through those most
intimate recesses, may be the better beheld; let the head of a man, or of a
brute beast that dyed of the Dropsy, be opened: For in such, whose brain
abounds with much moisture, the little stays, whereby this Meninx is fixed to
the substance of the brain, are loosned, so that the Membrane, with the
infoldings of the Vessels, may be easily drawn away, and pulled off almost
whole: which indeed being pulled off, the folds of the brain will appear naked;
also the insertions of the Vessels every where into the more inward substance
of the brain, may be perceived. But to a sound and dry brain the Pia Matter
sticks so closely, that it can scarce be drawn away in any part, or separated
with a Penknife.

We have already shown after what manner the Veins and Arteries (which creeping
like Ivy, are knit into the Pia Matter, and variously interwoven into it) cover
over with most thick little shoots, the whole compass of the Brain and Cerebel,
and their Interstices, the gapings of the crankling turnings and windings
about, bosoms, and cavities, and send forth every where small shoots into the
medullary substance; so that it is not to be doubted, but that the animal
Spirits, being as it were stilled forth immediately from the blood, every where
in the whole head, are received into the Pores and passages of the Brain and
Cerebel. From hence it will be easy to assign the use or office of the Pia
Matter: viz. First, this Membrane clothes the universal parts of the whole
Encephalon, and distinguishes them all one from another. For indeed, this lying
over all the gapings and interstices of the turnings and windings, is instead
of a mound or fence, by which the animal Spirits are restrained every where
within their proper cells and orbs of expansion, nor are they permitted by this
means to run beyond their bounds, and so confound the acts of the many
Faculties. Then secondly, this Meninx sustains all the blood-carrying Vessels,
viz. both the Arteries and Veins, together with their manifold productions, and
so affords a passage to the blood, by carrying it to and fro toward the brain.

Concerning these Vessels, which are knit to this Meninx, and follow its
stretching out into all parts, there are many admirable things to be met with,
and highly worthy of note, the uses and reasons of which is our purpose to
search into.

As to these, we shall first observe, that these Arteries and Veins, otherwise
than in any other part of the body besides, not arising nigh one another go
forth as companions, but going forth from opposite ends, meet every where
mutually, viz. the Arteries ascend from the Basis of the Skull, and by creeping
through the whole, emit upwards shoots and branches, which are met by the Pipes
of the Veins arising out of the bosoms, and carried downwards. By this means
the rivers of the blood seem to be made equal every where in the Brain, viz.
whilst the smaller shoots of the Veins follow or match the greater branches of
the Arteries, and on the contrary, the small branches of the Arteries the
Trunks of the Veins.

Secondly, We have already shown, that these Vessels are variously and very
much ingrafted or inoculated among themselves, not only the Arteries with the
Veins, but what is more rare and singular, Arteries with Arteries; to wit, the
Carotidick Arteries of one side, in many places, are united with the Carotides
of the other side; besides the Vertebrals of either side among themselves, and
are also inoculated into the posterior branches of the Carotides before united.
The joynings together of the Carotides, in most living Creatures, are made
about the Basis of the Skull under the Dura Matter, and that after a diverse
manner; in some communicated through the Vessels of the wonderful Net from one
side to the other; in others (as in a Horse we have observed with a certain
admiration) the arterious chanel is produced between the Trunks of the
Carotides, whereby the blood may be carried from one side to the other, and so
on the contrary. But besides, between the Dura Matter, about the Basis of the
Head, the same kind of ingraftings of the Arteries are still seen in man and
all perfect four-footed beasts.

The reason of these seems to be partly, that the blood to be carried from the
Heart into diverse Regions of the Brain, might be exactly mingled as to its
parts and particles, before it come to the place designed. For the Torrent of
the blood, because divided into lesser rivulets, is incident to languish in so
long a circuit, and its Spirits to be depauperated, and lastly it self to grow
cool; unless that various courses of its Latex should anew inkindle this vital
flame about to be extinguished or dye.

But there is another reason far greater than this of these manifold
ingraftings of the Vessels, to wit, that there may be a manifold way, and that
more certain, for the blood about to go into diverse Regions of the Brain, laid
open for each; so that if by chance one or two should be stopped, there might
easily be found another passage instead of them: as for example, if the
Carotides of one side should be obstructed, then the Vessels of the other side
might provide for either Province. Also as to the Vertebral Arteries, there is
the same manner of provision made. Further, if both the Carotides should be
stopped, the offices of each might be supplied through the Vertebrals, and so
on the other side the Carotides may supply the defects of the shut up
Vertebrals.

After this manner, lest there should be wanting an afflux of the blood at any
time in any part of the Brain, or its Appendix, within the Skull, there is care
taken with singular Art: For as there are four distinct passages, and those
remote one from the other, of this Latex, if perchance three of them should
happen to be shut up, the blood being carried through one only, will soon
supply or fill the channels and passages of all the rest. Which thing I have
found by Experience often tried, not without admiration and great pleasure. To
wit, I have squirted oftentimes into either Artery of the Carotides, a liquor
dyed with Ink, and presently the branches on either side, yea and the chief
shoots of the Vertebrals, have been dyed with the same tincture: yea, if such
an injection be sometimes iterated by one only passage, the Vessels creeping
into every corner and secret place of the Brain and Cerebel, will be imbued
with the same color. Also in those who have the wonderful Net, the Tincture or
dyed Liquor being injected in one side, it will come through the Net-like
infoldings of the Vessels in both sides. Hence it plainly appears, that there
is a communication between the Vessels watering the whole Head; and although
every Artery is carried to one only Region, as its peculiar Province, and
provides for it apart; yet, lest that any part should be deprived of the
influence of the blood, more ways lie open to every part by the ingraftings of
those vessels; so that if the proper vessels by chance should be wanting in
their office, its defect may presently be compensated by others neighboring.

It is not long since we dissected the dead body of a certain man, whom a great
Scirrhus or hard Swelling within the Mesentery, growing at last ulcerous, had
killed. When his Skull was opened, we beheld those things belonging to the
Head, and found the right Carotides, rising within the Skull, plainly bony or
rather stony, its cavity being almost wholly shut up; so that the influx of the
blood being denied to this passage, it seemed wonderful, wherefore this sick
person had not dyed before of an Apoplexy: which indeed he was so far from,
that he enjoyed to the last moment of his life, the free exercise of his mind
and animal function. For indeed, Nature had substituted a sufficient Remedy
against that danger of an Apoplexy; to wit, the Vertebral Artery of the same
side, in which the Carotidick was wanting, the bulk of the Pipe being enlarged,
became thrice as big as both its Pipes on the other side: because, the blood
being excluded the Carotidick, adding it self to the wonted provision of the
Vertebral Artery, and flowing with a double flood into the same belly, had so
dilated the chanel of that Artery above measure. This Gentleman, about the
beginning of his sickness, was tormented with a cruel pain of the Head toward
the left side. The cause whereof cannot be more probably assigned, than that
the blood excluded from the right Carotidick Artery, when at first it rushed
more impetuously in the left, had distended the Membrane; and therefore the
same distemper did afterward vanish of its own accord, to wit, the superfluous
blood being derived through the Vertebral Artery.

Thirdly, Concerning these sanguiferous Vessels covering the Pia Matter, we
observe, that the Arteries and Veins, whilst they meet one another, going out
from opposite ends, do not only transfer their burden immediately through the
several branches or shoots, mutually ingrafted, as is wont to be done in other
parts of the Body; but being variously complicated and interwoven, do
constitute every where admirable infoldings, into which, for the most part,
very small and very numerous Glandula's or Kernels are inserted. Which thing is
seen, not only in the infoldings, which are called Choroeides, (by which name,
besides those which are found within the plicature or folding up of the Brain,
we also intend others planted together behind the Cerebel) but these kind of
infoldings of the Vessels, with Glandula's sowed between, are seen every where
to be sprinkled through the whole compass and interior recesses of the Brain
and Cerebel, and especially between the gapings of their turnings and windings
and interstices. This is clearly manifest in a moister Brain, or in an
Hydropical, where the very small Glandula's, which otherwise are scarce to be
seen, being intumified by the moisture, are easily beheld. Moreover, from the
aforesaid infoldings, on every side implanted, little slender Vessels, being
every where sent forth, enter the Cortical, and in some measure the medullary
substance of the Brain and its Appendix; for if you squirt into the Carotides a
black liquor, besides the shoots of the Vessels, which it dies every where with
the same color, little blackish pricks will appear sprinkled in the substance
of the Brain. Further, if the brain of a living Animal be cut up, the live
blood will spring forth both from its Cortex and medullary part. The reason and
end of all which, if they be inquired into, it seems that these foldings of the
Vessels, being variously complicated with repeated windings about, as if they
were little serpentine channels hanging to an Alembick, through whose narrow
straits the blood passing with a long circuit, becomes still more subtle and
elaborated; to wit, its thicker part, being by degrees put off in its passage,
or sent away by the little branches of the Veins, and so at length the only
pure and most spirituous blood, and it self now ready to go into animal
Spirits, is admitted within the Pores and passages of the brain. But as the
blood or sanguinolent part is supped up by the Veins, so it is very likely the
Serum or watery part is received by the Glandula's or Kernels interwoven in
them. For it appears not for what other end these Arteries are every where
beset with so many Kernels, unless they should lay up in them the superfluous
serosities. Between these infoldings there appear not any Nerves to be found,
which may require any juice or serous humor from these Kernels; and it is not
yet found, whether these Lymphaeducts or Water-carriers be accompanied with any
Vessel: wherefore it may be lawful to suppose, that whilst the purer and
spirituous part of the blood, being separated from the rest of its mass, is
stilled forth into the brain, the serous humidities are received by the
Glandula's, which are numerous, and that they are for some time retained by
them, till they may be sent away into the Veins growing empty again.

Thus far we have beheld only the superior branchings forth of the
blood-carrying Vessels, which are every where interwoven in the Pia Matter; and
their infoldings, which like the leaves of a Wood, or creeping Ivy, cover the
exterior compass of the whole Head. But by what means, and as it were Chemical
Artifice, these Vessels do instill the animal Spirits into the Brain and
Cerebel, and serve for the use of one another besides, shall be told anon,
after we have considered of the inferior Aspect and next the ground of this
most thick Wood, viz. the greater Trunks of all the Arteries, which are
destinated for the Brain, where they pass through the Skull, and show
themselves beyond it.

CHAP. VIII. Shows with what difference the Arteries in various Animals pass
through the Skull; also for what use the wonderful Net is made, and the reason
of it.
THE Arteries, destinated to the Brain, are four in number, viz. two Carotides,
and as many Vertebrals. Concerning the former, we have already observed, that
their Trunks pass through the Wedge-like Bone, as it were with a mechanical
provision; to wit, either Artery is so bowed and intorted in its ascent, that
the blood, before it can reach to the Brain by a repeated stopping of shores,
or hindered by a certain let or impediment, might flow to it less rapidly and
more slowly. But this is not effected after one and the same manner in all
Animals: for although the ascent of the Artery be oblique and intorted in all,
yet in some, viz. in a Man and a Horse, it being bowed about with a greater
compass, still enters, even to the Brain, with a single and undivided Trunk:
when in most other beasts the same passes the Skull with a lesser circuit, and
sliding presently under the Dura Matter, diversifies it self there into Retiform
infoldings, commonly called the wonderful Net. Therefore it seems to be to the
purpose, that we inquire into the various reasons of this difference.

In the first place therefore we shall advertise you, that the Carotidick
Artery in a man enters a little more backward the Skull, than in any other
Animal, viz. nigh that hole through which the lateral bosom slides out of the
Skull about to be implanted into the Jugular Vein; for in the rest, this Artery
arises within the Skull under the end or acute process of the stony Bone. But
in an humane Head, the same being carried about by a longer compass, (that the
Torrent of the blood, before it comes to the border of the Brain, might flow
slowly and pleasantly with a broken force) attains to the Basis of the Skull
nigh the den made by the ingress of the lateral bosom; where being presently
intorted, it enters the proper Chanel insculped in the Wedg-like Bone, and for
the greater assurance it is clothed besides with a thicker additional Coat.
This double defense seems to be given it, lest the blood, boiling up too much,
and whilst it is carried violently toward the head, should make a Whirlpool
about the ingress of the Skull, to wit, where it begins to be wreathed about
from its direct ascent, and should break by its stood the banks of the Belly,
unless they were more firm. The Artery being slid out of the bony chanel, lays
aside also its ascititious or additional Coat; and now being well enough
defended within the Skull, goes forward clothed only with its proper Coat, and
creeps under the Dura Matter, and being as it were depressed in the midst of its
passage into a valley, being immediately carried out again, it goes on till it
comes to the head of the Turkey Chair; where again being bent in and intorted,
with a certain compass, it ascends straight, and boring through the Dura Matter,
is carried toward the Brain. The Trunk of this Carotis, like a Meander,
passing through the Skull with a very much bending way or passage, is aptly
represented in the first Figure of the following Table.

If the reason of this kind of Conformation be inquired into, it easily occurs,
that in an humane Head, where the generous Affections, and the great forces and
ardors of the Souls are stirred up, the approach of the blood to the confines
of the Brain, ought to be free and expeditious; and it is behoveful for its
River not to run in narrow and manifoldly divided Rivulets, which would scarce
drive a Mill, but always with a broad and open chanel, such as might bear a
Ship under Sail. And indeed, in this respect, a man differs from most brute
beasts, in which, the Artery being divided into a thousand little shoots, lest
it should carry the blood with a fuller chanel, or more quick course than is
requisite, makes the Net-like infoldings, by which indeed it comes to pass,
that the blood slides into the Brain very slowly, and with a gentle and almost
even stream. If that be true, as some affirm, that the wonderful Net also is
sometimes found in an humane Brain, I believe it is only in those sort of men,
who being of a slender wit or unmoved disposition, and destitute of all force
and ardor of the mind, are little better than dull working beasts in fortitude
and wisdom.

Secondly, The conformation of the Carotidick Artery in a Horse, comes nearest
its structure in a man; for in this the Artery enters the Skull also lower, and
with a greater compass than in other four-footed beasts: which being passed,
its Trunk being intorted, with a certain compass, and then a little depressed,
goes forward whole to the side of the Turkey Chair still with a full and broad
chanel: which truly ought to be made so, because magnanimous and fierce forces
are convenient for this Animal, born as it were for War and any dangerous
attempts; and so there was need, that the blood might ascend the Brain with a
free and plentiful course, and (when occasion requires) with a full Torrent.
But though the blood passes through the Basis of a Horses Skull in the same
undivided chanel, yet it ought not to come to the Brain it self in one single
passage; because the frame or substance of this in a Horse being far weaker and
colder than in a man, it might be overthrown and drowned by the blood rushing
in by heaps: wherefore the great River of the Artery disburdens it self by two
Emissaries, and pours out its Latex at so many distinct places of the Brain.
Further, as if by this means there were not yet sufficient caution against the
Deluge of the Brain, a transverse or cross chanel, as it were a diversion, is
formed between the channels of either Artery; through which the blood, being
straightened for room, may go aside, and flow and reflow from one bank or chanel
to another, rather than oppress or overflow the Brain. Also besides, certain
shoots being sent out from the Trunk of either Artery, are inserted into the
pituitary Glandula, the use of which is doubtless to separate certain
serosities of the too watery blood, and to lay them up into that Glandula,
whereby the rest of the bloody Latex, to be carried to the Brain, becomes more
pure and free from dregs. By what means the Carotidick Arteries, in the head of
a Horse, pass through the Basis of the Skull, is represented in the second
Figure of the following Table. I have not yet had the means to inspect the
brains of a Lion or a Monkey; but there is reason to suspect, that in these
also the Carotides do pass through the Skull with a single Trunk. In a Sheep,
Calf, Hog, yea in a Dog, Fox, Cat, and other four-footed beasts, which I have
hitherto opened, this Artery is divaricated into Net-like infoldings, which
Vessels, for what causes and for what uses they are so made, we shall now
inquire into.

Thirdly therefore, most other four-footed beasts, different from a Man and a
Horse, have the wonderful Net adjoined to the Carotidick Artery. In truth, this
is met with in so many, that common Anatomy has ascribed it to all Animals,
and also to man it self. In whom it is found, we observe, that the Artery,
about to enter the Skull, is not carried about with so long a compass, but
rising up nigh the hinder part of the Turkish Chair, is presently divided into
small shoots; yet so, as one little chanel is stretched right out, which the
blood quietly running to, passes through without any stay, being carried
straight into the Brain: but from the side of this many rivulets are derived on
every side, into which the blood impetuously ascending, may be easily diverted.
These little rivers are partly ingrafted into the veinous passages of the same,
and the Vessels of the other side, and are partly carried into the pituitary
Glandula, and partly a compass being fetched, are returned into the former
chanel or belly of the Artery. That it is so, besides naked inspection, appears
plainly by this Experiment. If below the Skull, an inky liquor be gently and by
degrees injected into the Trunk of the Carotis, that passing through the strait
passage, is carried presently into the Brain, nor does it dye the lateral
infolded Vessels with its tincture; but if this liquor be immitted continually
and forcibly, presently running into the folds, it will make black the Vessels
of the same and of the opposite side, also entering the hither part of the
Glandula and its interior substance. If the use of these kind of infoldings of
the Vessels, or the wonderful Net be inquired into, I say, that it is made
chiefly for these ends: viz. First, that the Torrent of the blood being divided
into small rivulets, its more rapid course may be so far dulled or broken, that
it may be but leisurely instilled into the Brain. For otherwise in laboring
beasts, who go with their heads hanging down, and have but a weak brain, the
more free influx of the blood might easily overthrow the fabric of the Brain,
and spoil the animal Spirits. Secondly, the divarication of the Carotides into
Net like infoldings, has another use of no less moment, to wit, that the more
watery blood being (as it is its temperament in most Beasts, and especially in
those who are fed with herbage) before it be poured upon the Brain, might carry
away some part of the superfluous Serum to the pituitary Glandula, and instill
the other part into the branches or shoots of the Veins to be returned toward
the Heart. Thirdly and lastly, for as much as the Vessels on either side are
mutually inoculated by this means, there is care taken both that the blood may
be exactly mixed before it ascends to the Brain, as also that more certain ways
may be made for its passage: because, if perchance an obstruction should happen
in one side of the wonderful Net, the blood by that enfolding being presently
carried to the other, may find a passage: for this cause, to wit, that the
blood might be the better prevented from any impediment in its passage, the
Vessels are not only inoculated under the Dura Matter about the wonderful Net,
but the Arteries again on either side, do the same thing as soon as they, being
knit to the Pia Matter, reach the superficies of the Brain, as has been already
shown. By these sort of ingraftings of the Vessels in the wonderful Net, it
comes to pass, that an inky liquor being injected into one of the Carotides,
and forced upwards, descends by the Trunk of the Artery on the opposite side,
as we have elsewhere observed. Some rude draught of the wonderful Net is
expressed in the third Figure of the following Table.

But as the Carotides (of whose office and ascent we have hitherto spoken)
carry the destinated Tribute of the blood to the Brain; so the Vertebrals serve
chiefly for the watering the Cerebel and the hinder part of the oblong Marrow.
Hence we observe, because the conformation of the Cerebel is alike in all
Creatures, therefore also the Vertebral Arteries, different from the Carotides,
are found alike in all without any great difference. Nor does there seem to be
need of any great provision for the admission or entrance of the Vertebral
Arteries within the Skull; because, as they carry a lesser portion of the
blood, and for that the blood it self that is to be bestowed on the Cerebel, is
wont there to be agitated or moved with no perturbations of passions or
conceptions; therefore there is not that necessity that there should be placed
any remora or any incitement for its Torrent.

The Vertebral Artery, arising from the branch in the fifth Rib, in its whole
ascent through the hinder part of the Head, passes through the little holes cut
in the extuberances of the Vertebrae, till it comes near the Basis of the
hinder part of the Head; where the same being bent down on either side, and
admitted into the Skull by the last hole, excepting where the spinal Marrow
goes forth, is carried by the side of the oblong marrow; but as soon as it is
brought to the region of the Cerebel, it sends forth branches on either side,
which cover its superficies, and besides on its back side make infoldings no
less signal than those commonly called the Choroeides, and with larger Kernels
more thickly interwoven. As those shoots convey the Juice requisite for the
stilling forth the animal Spirits, so these convey the heated blood and the
purified from the serous Colluvies. Further, beneath the Cerebel, both the
Vertebral branches, inclining mutually one to another, are united, as it were
for that end, that if the flowing of the blood should be stopped on either
side, it might be supplied from the other to the whole compass of the Cerebel
and its neighboring parts. These sanguiferous Vessels covering the Cerebel,
even as the others do the Brain, make signal infoldings both in its outward
superficies, and in that of the oblong marrow, and also within its lappets and
folds; from which small shoots are sent forth every where into its under-lying
substance: so that from these a subtle liquor, as it were stilled forth and
imbibed by the Cortical substance of the Cerebel, seems to go into animal
Spirits. By what means, and in what parts of the Head the production of the
animal Spirits is performed, remains next to be inquired into.

CHAP. IX. Shows by what provision, and in what places of the Head the Animal
Spirits are begotten: Also other Uses and Accidents of the Pia Matter are added.
FRom the description of the Sanguiducts or Blood-carrying Vessels, which cover
and weave about on every side the Pia Matter, hitherto handled, we are led by a
certain thread to consider by what provision, and in what places of the Brain
and its Appendix the production of the animal Spirits is performed.

1. As to the first, it appears from what has been already said, that the
blood is it self the matter out of which the animal Spirits are drawn; and that
the Vessels containing and carrying it every where through the whole compass of
the Head, are like distillatory Organs, which by circulating more exactly, and
as it were subliming the blood, separate its purer and more active particles
from the rest, and subtilize them, and at length insinuate those spiritualized
into the Brain and its Appendix. Concerning this matter to be distilled, there
is care taken, and indeed by the best means, that its stock or provision may be
still supplied in fit quality and due quantity.

In respect of the quality, from the whole bloody mass, a portion highly
volatile, spirituous, and endued with active Elements, ought constantly to
arise toward the Head; which thing succeeds partly of its own accord, and
partly that it might be more commodiously done, care is taken with a certain
artificialness; to wit, the Vertebral Arteries, in all Creatures ascending
straight, and almost perpendicularly, do in a manner cause, that only the more
subtle and light blood is carried upwards, the remaining more thick as it were
sinking down for the baser offices of the Limbs and of some of the Bowels. Yea,
also the Carotides in a man, having an erected head higher than the rest of the
parts, and in a Horse in some sort lifting up his face, have also the same
privilege; to wit, that by their more steep ascent only the more pure and
volatile blood may ascend to the region of the Brain. But in other four-footed
beasts, who go with a prone or hanging head, and who have a more frigid and
watery blood, which may easily slide into, and too much wash the Brain, this
evil is in some part prevented by the wonderful Net and pituitary Glandula
joined to the Carotides; which indeed receive the superfluous humidities of the
blood, and so make it more pure and free from dregs before it comes to the
brain.

But that the blood may be supplied still in due quantity, to wit, as it were
in weight and measure, from the distillatory Vessels, stretched about the
compass of the Head, there is a notable provision made in all the Carotides
about the Basis of the Skull: because their crooked imbowings and branching
into infoldings, hinders the too great or too rapid approach of the blood:
then, lest the passage of it should at any time be shut up, the mutual
ingraftings of all the Vessels on either side, do help or provide for. After
this manner, the business of extracting the animal Spirits is performed even as
a Chemical Elixir; to wit, great care is taken in the beginning of that
Operation, both that choice of matter may be had, and that only a due
proportion of it be exposed to distillation.

The blood by this means, as it were a Chemical work prepared, is carried by
the fourfold Chariot of the Arteries to four distinct regions of the Head: and
as the sanguiferous Vessels, being distributed with separate ramifications or
branches through the whole compass of the Brain and its Appendix, cover all the
heights of its compassings about or gyrations, and also all its crevices and
their gapings and recesses, they bring to their doors the matter to be
distilled into the Head every where through the whole circumference of the
Brain and Cerebel nigh the Cortical substance of either; out of which as the
Spirits are distilled, by this means it is brought about, that they are
insinuated into the subjected substance of either. The blood being carried
through the narrow infoldings and divarications of the Vessels, as it were (as
was said) through the serpentine channels of an Alembick is made extremely
subtle, as much as may be, in its liquor; in the mean time, what is bloody is
received by the little shoots of the Veins associates, or meeting one another
every where, and what is serous by the Kernels every where dispersed; yet its
more purified and spirituous part being carried on further through the very
small shoots sent forth on all sides, are instilled more deeply into the very
Pores and passages of the Brain and Cerebel; which presently flowing from the
Cortical substance into the medullary, there exercise the gifts of the animal
Function. What peculiar body and constitutive particles of the Brain it self
and Cerebel, conduce to the generation and perfection of the animal Spirits
within the substance of either, shall be shown hereafter, when we treat of the
Use of those Parts: now shall be taken notice of what we before mentioned, to
wit, that the fluid extillation of the spirituous liquor from the blood about
the Pia Matter, is performed after a signal manner, both from the ambient heat,
which is stirred up from the blood contained within the bosoms, as it were from
a Balneo Mariae, enriched by the continual flowing of it anew, and also from
the obduction of the Meninges, like an Alembick, by which the spirituous
Particles, apt to fly away, are constrained and forced into the parts beneath.

But indeed, though the animal Spirits are procreated wholly from the blood,
yet the blood watering the Brain and its Appendix, is not only bestowed on this
work: for as to the sanguiferous Vessels, which arising out of the Trunks both
of the Carotides and the Vertebrals, cover over the whole Head and all its
parts and processes; though many of them, yet not all, are little distillatory
channels of the animal Spirits. For the animal Spirits are not produced in all
places, to which these Vessels reach; for we affirm, that these Spirits are
only procreated in the Brain and Cerebel: (which it were easy to prove by the
Symptoms which happen in the Apoplexy and Palsy, and shall be afterward
clearly shown) and from this double fountain of the animal Spirits they flow
out into all the rest of the parts, and irradiate, by a constant influence, the
whole nervous stock. In the mean time, the oblong marrow and its various
processes and protuberances are either retreating places, or high roads for the
animal Spirits, procreated in the Brain and Cerebel, and flowing from thence.
But for as much as the Arteries and Veins clothe these parts also with a thick
series of shoots, and that within the enfolding of the Brain the folds called
Choroeides are hung slack and loosly, these seem to be so made for other
reasons, viz. both that these parts might be actuated by heat, supplied as it
were from a continual fire, and also that the nourishing Juice might be
bestowed on the Spirits which flow there.

As to the first, that the animal Spirits now perfected, may be freely
expanded, and irradiate the nervous System, there seems to be required, that
the ambient heat, being excited by the blood flowing thither, might open all
the little spaces for their passage, and notably dilate or lay open for them
ways or roads: wherefore we intimated before, because the little shoots of the
Vessels ought not to be deeply inserted into the callous body, (for that, lest
the commerce of the Spirits, diverting in this Mart or meeting place, should be
disturbed by the perpetual influence of the blood) therefore the enfolding of
the Choroeides is hung under its chamber, that at least by this nigh situation,
as by a Stove or Hot-house, the heat there might be preserved. Besides, we
intimated another use of this enfolding; to wit, that the blood, passing
through the very narrow Meanders and convolutions or rollings about of the
Vessels, might lay aside its serous recrements into the Glandula's or passages
of the Veins.

2. But secondly, That many branches and lesser shoots of the same Vessels,
which water the Brain and Cerebel, cover also the oblong marrow, and in some
measure enter into its Pores and deeper substance (within which the animal
Spirits are not begotten, but only exercised and expanded) I say, that this is
so made for this other respect; to wit, that the substance of the oblong marrow
might imbibe a constant provision of nourishment from the pouring in of the
blood whereof it has need. For whilst the animal Spirits, flowing into the
nervous stock from the Brain and Cerebel, pass through this passage, as it were
the high road, some food he e ought to be administered to them, as it were in
their journey, from the watering blood: For indeed we suppose (which also will
afterward clearly appear) that the oblong marrow, together with the nervous
parts, is moistened with a double humor, viz. one spirituous and highly active,
which flows altogether from the Brain and Cerebel, and being from thence
derived into the whole nervous stock, bestows upon them the sensitive and
moving Faculties; and the other humor softer and more oily and sulphurous,
which being supplied from the blood, and affused immediately on every part, is
the Author of their Heat and Vegetation. Both these Juyces agree among
themselves, and being every where joined together and married, they are as it
were a masculine and feminine seed mixed together; and so they impart to all
parts both sense and motion, and all the powers of life and growth. Wherefore
it is observed, that all the parts of the whole body, by which motion and sense
are performed, do not only swell up with the animal Spirit, of whose influence
being deprived, they presently suffer a resolution or loosning; but also they
admit the sanguiferous Vessels; of whose Tribute if they be defrauded,
presently they wither away, or are distempered with a mortification or
Gangrene. Wherefore, that the flesh, membranes, and all the bones may be
watered with the blood, (as may be perceived by the help of a Microscope) the
very little or minute bodies of some of the Nerves are surrounded with
Capillaments or little hairs of Arteries and Veins, together with their proper
Fibrils, that we need not doubt to assert, that the Vessels penetrating the
superficies of the Brain and Cerebel, do distill into them a subtle matter for
the generation of the animal Spirits; but that some other shoots of the same
Vessels, covering the oblong marrow, do only impart to it heat and nourishing
Juice. Lastly, that the infoldings of the Choroeides were built under the
chamber of the oblong marrow, chiefly for the dispensing of heat, and in some
measure for the sake of separation of the serous Latex. But concerning these,
we shall have occasion to speak more largely afterward, when we shall treat of
the nutritious and nervous Juice, and when we shall consider of that famous
Controversy, viz. whether nourishment is made by the blood or Nerves: further,
we shall elsewhere speak more fully of the Nature, Hypostasis, and diverse
Disposition of the animal Spirits; also, what the substance of the Brain, and
the conformation of the parts, may contribute to their production.

Thus far concerning the Pia Matter and the blood-carrying Vessels, which are
woven in it, and following its protension, water the whole Head, we have
treated largely. But before we quite leave the consideration of this Membrane,
we will inquire what sense and motion it may have. Certainly it is not
undeservedly that we ascribe the most cruel Headaches to the more acute sense
of this; (in which however, by what means this Meninx is affected, does not so
easily appear.) It is the common opinion, that sharp and tormenting Vapors,
being raised from the Viscera of the lower Belly, especially from the
Ventricle, Hypochondria, or Womb strike against this Membrane, and so pierce it
with pain. But we say, though this be impossible, that Vapors passing so many
interstices and bars of the Viscera and bones, without any trouble, should ever
come to the Head and hurt it: yet we do not deny, but that sometimes vaporous
Effluvia's do proceed from the blood boiling or estuating within the confines
of the Brain, which being shut up together under the Pia Matter, and as it were
gathered into a Cloud, do greatly blow up and distend it, and so distemper it
with pain. I have often seen, in a Head newly opened after death, the Pia Matter
distended, and shining like a Bladder, that the same seemed to be intumified,
with much water included under it; which notwithstanding was found to be so
done by wind distending the Membrane, for that being dissected, that Tumor fell
down without the effusion of water.

But we think the Headaches, which happen by reason of the evil of this
Membrane, are chiefly excited by another means, to wit, for as much as this
Meninx suffers a breach of the unity by the blood boiling up above measure, and
rushing into its Pores, and so it is contracted into lighter Convulsions. I
have sometimes opened the Heads of the defunct, which when living, were
obnoxious to most miserable Headaches; in which, near the longitudinal bosom,
where the seat of the pains was, the Pia Matter or interior, grew to the Dura
Matter or exterior for some space, oft-times for two fingers breadth, and by
their growing together had excited a sharp and unequal Tumor; in which the
mouths of the Vessels were so wholly stopped up, that there was left for the
blood, though very much boiling up, no passage into the adjoining bosom.

As to the motion of this Membrane, we wholly deny, that it has in it self a
perpetual Systole and Diastole; however, the Pulses in some Arteries, have
seemed something like it, which have given occasion perchance to this vulgar
Opinion. Yet in the mean time, it may be lawful to believe, that this Meninx,
for that it is very sensible, is rendered obnoxious to Cramps and convulsive
motions: and that from its greater contraction the fits of the Falling Sickness
do arise, and from its lesser and more partial corrugation or wrinkling
together, Headaches, as has been said, and also sometimes Scotomies,
Vertigoes, and often Convulsions of the Members and Viscera, planted at a great
distance from the origin of the Nerves, being drawn into consent.

CHAP. X. A Description of the Brain, properly so called, and the Explication
and Use of its Parts.
WE have thus far beheld the Coverings of the Brain, both the bony and the
membranous, also the Arteries and Veins growing and knit to them, like Ivy, and
distributed through the whole compass of the Head. There now remains, these
coverings being removed, that we next consider the Fabric and true Hypotype or
Character of the Brain and its Appendix, together with the action and use of
all the parts. And here at first sight we meet with three things, to wit, the
Brain, the oblong Marrow, and the Cerebel: of which the oblong marrow seems to
be a common Trunk, to which the Brain and Cerebel grow like branches: wherefore
some contend the medullary Rope to be the principal part, and the Brain and
Cerebel its dependences. But that it is otherwise appears by this, because
these bodies, both in the generation and dispensation of the animal Spirits,
are of more noble use than the oblong marrow; so that if the out-flowings of
the Spirits from the Brain or Cerebel be shut up or hindered, the nervous System
presently suffers an Eclipse; in the mean time, if this be primarily
distempered, the Brain and Cerebel suffer not for its fault.

That we may begin with the Brain, it may be considered in a double respect; to
wit, both as to its unequal or exterior superficies, as it is beheld in its
proper site and position; and as to its interior cavity, to wit, as the Brain
appears opened, its concave superficies being expanded and turned upside down.
We have already taken care to delineate its true form or Type in either manner,
by what has been before said, to wit, after what manner it is both within and
without. There now remains, after its fabric and conformation being rightly
weighed, for us design its offices, and to show the uses of it and of every one
of its parts. Concerning which, we ought to unfold in general, first, what the
office of the whole Brain is, then secondly, when we shall descend to
particulars, there will come under consideration, 1. The division of the Brain,
to wit, its double Hemisphere, also the two Lobes or partitions of either. 2.
The narrow crankling turnings and windings, or the gyrations and convolutions
or rolling together of the Brain. 3. Its double substance, viz. Cortical and
Medullary. 4. The common Basis of all, viz. the callous body. 5. Its subtension
or Fornix. 6. The appension or circuit of the Brain over or above the oblong
marrow. 7. And what results from thence, the void space or Ventricles made by
its enfolding together. Concerning these, we shall take notice of what things
occur worth noting; concerning the smelling Nerves and their processes, we
shall inquire afterward, when we shall speak particularly of the Nerves.

1. The Brain is accounted the chief seat of the Rational Soul in a man, and of
the sensitive in brute beasts, and indeed as the chief mover in the animal
Machine, it is the origin and fountain of all motions and conceptions. But
some Functions do chiefly and more immediately belong to the substance of this,
and others depend as it were mediately and less necessarily upon it. Among
these, which of the former sort are accounted the chief, are the Imagination,
Memory, and Appetite. For it seems, that the Imagination is a certain
undulation or wavering of the animal Spirits, begun more inwardly in the middle
of the Brain, and expanded or stretched out from thence on every side toward
its circumference: on the contrary, the act of the Memory consists in the
regurgitation or flowing back of the Spirits from the exterior compass of the
Brain toward its middle. The Appetite is stirred up, for that the animal
Spirits, being some-how moved about the middle of the Brain, tend from thence
outwardly toward the nervous System. The rest of the Faculties of this Soul,
as Sense and Motion, also the Passions and Instincts merely natural, though
they depend in some measure upon the Brain, yet they are properly performed in
the oblong Marrow and Cerebel, or proceed from them.

2. In some Animals, the substance of the Brain is divided into two parts, as
it were Hemispheres, distinct one from another almost through its whole
thickness, even to the callous body, which is instead of a bottom; and in like
manner also in all the Sensories, and in most of the other Organs of the
necessary Functions, the Brain is as it were twofold, that there might be a
provision made against the defect of one side by the supplement of the other.
Further, in man, who has a brain more large and capacious than other
Creatures, either Hemisphere is again subdivided into two Lobes, to wit, the
Anterior and the Posterior; between which a branch of the Carotidick Artery,
being drawn like a bounding River to both, distinguishes them as it were into
two Provinces. Certainly, this second partition of the humane Brain also seems
to be designed for its greater safety; that if perchance any evil should happen
to one or both the foremost Lobes, yet the latter, for that they are separated,
may avoid the contagion of the neighboring and farther spreading evil: So the
Brain, like a Castle, divided into many Towers or places of Defense, is thereby
made the stronger and harder to be taken.

3. Also the universal frame of the Brain appears yet more divided and
variegated within all its aforesaid partitions; for all its whole exterior
superficies is made uneven and broken, with turnings and windings and rollings
about, almost like those of the Intestines. Those Gyrations or Turnings going
from the forepart of the Brain toward the latter with a creeping compass, and
as it were a spiral circuit, encompasses both its Hemispheres, that they might
mutually furnish all the convolutions with a continued passage: in a more moist
Brain, or long kept, the Pia Matter, clothing every one, and collecting them
together, is easily pulled away; and then the turnings or folds being opened
and separated one from another, the substance of the brain is seen to be
plowed, or laid as it were with furrows; out of which arise banks or ridges of
broken crevices, not in a direct series, but cross-wise; so that in the bottom
of every furrow, a convolution arising from the right side, is carried to the
left, then others following next, being sent from the left side, is drawn to
the right, and so by turns the inequalities of the whole brain are variegated
in this order.

If it be inquired into, what benefit its Turnings and Convolutions afford to
the brain, or for what end its whole anfractuous or broken crankling frame is,
we say, that the brain is so framed, both for the more plentiful reception of
the spirituous aliment, and also for the more commodious dispensation of the
animal Spirits for some uses. As to the aliment to be bestowed on the brain,
because it is required to be subtle and extremely wrought or elaborated;
therefore it ought to be admitted, not by a more open passage, but only by very
small pores and passages. Wherefore that there might be sufficient plenty of
spirituous liquor supplied, it is not only drunk in every where in the plain
superficies of the brain from its Cortical substance; but that superficies of
the brain or Cortical substance is uneven and rough with folds and turnings
about; that the spaces for the receiving the Juice might be enlarged as much as
may be: For the anfractuous or crankling brain, like a plot of ground, planted
every where with nooks and corners, and dauks and mole-hills, has a far more
ample extension, than if its superficies were plain and even. Further, those
cranklings of the brain do more fitly hide the sanguiferous Vessels, for that
they are very small and slender, and more safely keep them, being variously
interwoven into one another infoldings, than if they should be openly
distributed; for so being carelessly laid, they would be liable to too frequent
hurt.

But a reason and necessity of the turnings about in the brain, and not of
lesser moment than the other, is fetched from the dispensation of the animal
Spirits. For as the animal Spirits, for the various acts of Imagination and
Memory, ought to be moved within certain and distinct limited or bounded
places, and those motions to be often iterated or repeated through the same
tracts or paths: for that reason, these manifold convolutions and infoldings of
the brain are required for these diverse manners of ordinations of the animal
Spirits, to wit, that in these Cells or Storehouses severally placed, might be
kept the species of sensible things, and as occasion serves, may be taken from
thence. Hence these folds or rollings about are far more and greater in a man
than in any other living Creature, to wit, for the various and manifold actings
of the superior Faculties; but they are garnished with an uncertain, and as it
were fortuitous series, that the exercises of the animal Function might be free
and changeable, and not determined to one. Those Gyrations or Turnings about in
four-footed beasts are fewer, and in some, as in a Cat, they are found to be in
a certain figure and order: wherefore this Brute thinks on, or remembers scarce
any thing but what the instincts and needs of Nature suggest. In the lesser
four-footed beasts, also in Fowls and Fishes, the superficies of the brain
being plain and even, wants all cranklings and turnings about: wherefore these
sort of Animals comprehend or learn by imitation fewer things, and those almost
only of one kind; for that in such, distinct Cells, and parted one from
another, are wanting, in which the diverse Species and Ideas of things are kept
apart.

But that in more perfect Animals, all the turnings about are made of a twofold
substance, viz. Cortical and Medullary; the reason seems to be, that one part
may serve for the production of the animal Spirits, and the other for their
exercise and dispensation. For we may well think, that the animal Spirits are
wholly or for the most part procreated in the Cortical substance of the brain;
for this severs and receives immediately from the blood the subtle liquor, and
imbuing it with a volatile Salt, exalts it into very pure Spirits. It is
obvious to every one, that the Arteries enter the Cortex of the brain with a
more frequent insertion of shoots, and instill to it a spirituous liquor; the
leavings of which, or what is superfluous, the Veins in like manner entering it,
do sup up and carry away; in the mean time, the more subtle portion being here
set free, goes into Spirits. In truth, the blood waters the medullary substance
of the brain in a very small quantity; which seems truly to be rather for the
sake of exciting of heat, than that the animal Spirits should there be
generated by the flowing in of that blood. For indeed, the volatile Salt, which
like Ferment, spiritualizes the subtle liquor stilled forth from the blood, is
had more copiously in the Cortex of the brain, rather than in its middle or
marrowy part; because that part, being endued with an Ashy color, shows by its
aspect the spermatick Particles and Humor contained in them, in which Spirit
and a volatile Salt very much abounds; yea and plainly resembles an Armeniack
smell, (such as either part alike breathe forth.) In the mean time, the
medullary part of the brain seems very like the oblong marrow and the spinal.
But it is well enough known, that these medullary parts serve for the exercise
and dispensation of the animal Spirits, and not for their generation. The sign
of which is, that wherever an obstruction happens in them, whatever is below,
being destitute of the influx of the Spirits, suffers an Eclipse; whence it
follows, that the animal Spirits, irradiating the medullary Rope, are not
produced in it, but flow in from elsewhere; and why should not we think the
same of the middle marrow of the brain? Truly, that this part is rather the
Mart or Exchange of the Spirits than its Shop or Workhouse, appears from
hence, because the Animals which excel in Memory, Imagination, and Appetite,
are furnished with a more ample marrow of the brain; as is observed in man and
the more perfect four footed beasts: and they who seem to have little need of
those Faculties, as the lesser four-footed beasts, also Fowls and Fishes have
the Cortex of the brain greater, but the medullary part very small. It is a
familiar Experiment among Boys to thrust a needle through the head of a Hen,
and that she in the mean time, whose brain is so pierced through, shall live
and be well a long time. The reason of which is, because the whole substance of
the brain in these sort of Animals is almost merely Cortical; wherefore from
the suffering such a hurt, (as long as the marrow remains unhurt) the Spirits
are generated in a lesser quantity, but their commerce to the necessaries of
life, are not therefore presently interrupted. Indeed the brains of Birds
consist almost wholly of a Cortical and Ashy part; and the medullary part is
exceeding small, and is only like a smaller Nerve descending on either side
from the substance of the brain it self.

After the animal Spirits are begot by a constant afflux of the blood within
the Cortex of the Brain, being there begotten, having obtained a watery Vehicle,
they flow presently more inwardly, and soon enter into the marrows, filling the
furrows and baulks of all the turning and winding Crevices; from whence being
carried farther through all the particular tracts of each marrow into the
marrowy substance, which lies under all the winding Crevices, as their common
Basis, they are brought at last into the Callous Body, as into a spacious
field; where, as in a free and open place, these Spirits being newly produced,
are expatiated or issue forth.

5. Indeed this medullary substance called the Callous Body, which chambering
the more inward superficies of the brain, receives into it self the marrow of
all the turning Crevices, seems to be made for that end, and disposed there for
the same purpose; to wit, that the Spirits flowing into it on every side, might
be stretched out as in their proper Sphere, and begin to exercise the acts of
the animal Faculties. In this place, they which come out of the several winding
Crevices, do meet together, and remain as in a public Emporium or Mart; from
whence, as occasion serves, they are raised up, and drawn forth for the uses of
every Faculty. But whilst they here remain at leisure and not busied, they
become purified or refined more and more by a continual circulation: because
these Spirits newborn, do gently and perpetually flow on every side from the
outmost bounds of this body (to wit, where this common marrow besmears the
hinder productions of the brain, or the border of either of its Hemispheres)
toward the forepart of this callous Body, where it is thickest; and there, if
there be need, they are employed on the act of the Imagination, or entering the
shanks of the oblong Marrow, they actuate and inspire the nervous Appendix: but
what Spirits are remaining there, after these offices are served, run forthwith
into the Fornix, and passing through its passage, they are remanded back again
to the hinder region of the brain by a certain circulation; and lastly, after
this manner, penetrating through the narrow passages of the Fornix, those
Spirits are made more subtle, and also, as it seems most likely, they perform
in this circulary motion those more subtle acts of the Fantasy.

6. Truly, that we may here speak something of the Fornix, it seems that this
part serves for a twofold use: viz. first, lest the more inward sides of the
Brain hanging slack and loosly, might fall together among themselves, or might
be removed beyond the limits of a just protension or out-stretching; for they,
not only by the coming between of the Pia Matter, and by little cords drawn from
it, cohere to the oblong marrow and the Cerebel; but besides, the Fornix, like
a Ligament or string brought from one end of the brain to the other, constrains
and keeps its whole frame in its due figure and situation. For this part purely
medullar, and of the same substance with the callous Body, seems to be a
certain process of this, which arising more forward between the streaked
bodies, and falling upon the two shanks of the oblong marrow, first of all
distinguishes them; afterward, being separated from them, is carried through
the midst of the cavity, and about the hinder part of the brain is divided as
it were into two Arms, which being bent on both sides, and again cleaving to
the border of the callous Body, strictly embrace the oblong marrow, and knit
and firmly tie the hinder bulk of the brain to its Trunk, lest it should flow
or slide forth. But the other, and that the more noted use of the Fornix seems
to be what we but now mentioned; to wit, that the animal Spirits may
immediately pass through its passage from one end of the brain to the other,
and so, as it were through the bill of a Pelican, they might be circulated into
their own intorted belly.

That those things which were but now declared concerning the Penetralia and
inward recesses of the Brain, may be the better understood, we will here add a
Scheme of its Sphere turned inside out, and stretched out as it were upon a
plain, so that the concave and inmost superficies of the callous Body, together
with the Fornix, may be sufficiently seen.

CHAP. XI. Shows with what motion and tendency of the Animal Spirits the
Exercises of the Animal Faculties are performed within the Confines of the
Brain: Also what the use of its Ventricles is.
HItherto setting forth the uses and offices of the Brain, properly so called,
and of its parts, we have showed after what manner the animal Spirits are
procreated from the blood in this their principal Shop or Workhouse; and into
what diverting places, they being newly brought forth, do depart of themselves,
and are there kept as it were in distinct Cloisters or Cells to be drawn forth
for the manifold Exercises of the animal Function. But because these Spirits,
so brought to perfection, and ready for their work within the same parts of the
Brain, enter into other manner of motions, and diverse ways of emanations;
therefore before we proceed any further, for the searching out their tracts
within the oblong Marrow and Cerebel, we ought to declare concerning these
Spirits disposed within the confines of the Brain it self, with what forces
they are furnished, in what form they unfold themselves, and in what ways they
diffuse themselves and go forward as often as being mustered in due order, they
produce the acts of the Imagination, Memory, Appetite, and other superior
Faculties of the Soul. But for as much as hereafter, when we have finished the
explication of the Head and nervous Appendix, we have resolved, for a
conclusion, to treat of the Soul of Brutes and its powers, I may therefore for
the present lay aside this task; unless that in the mean time it may not seem
amiss to give a taste only in general of these few things: viz. as there are
two parts of the inferior Soul, or of Beasts, to wit, the vital or flamy, being
inkindled in the blood, and the sensitive or lucid, being diffused through the
whole Head and its nervous dependences, the animal Spirits being continually
produced in the Brain and in the Cerebel, do constitute a double as it were
Root or Fountain of this lucid part: yea, the Spirits of either lineage, for as
much as they are continued both within those Fountains, and from thence through
the frame or substance of the nervous System, as it were under the same beamy
Systasis and contexture, they effect or cause the whole Hypostasis or
subsistency of the sensitive Soul.

But there happen to this Soul, because it is apt to be moved with a various
impulse, and so to contract or dilate its species in the whole, or in part, for
that reason diverse manners both of Actions and of Passions, to wit, the Senses,
which we call its Passions; and Motions, which we name the Actions of the same.
The formal reason of the former, viz. the Senses, consists in the retraction or
drawing back of the Spirits, or a flowing back toward their Fountains. For
where ever the impression of a sensible object is carried to this radiant or
beamy contexture, presently either the whole frame, or some portion of it,
whereby it admits the species, is compelled to wag, and to be moved back, as it
were to leap back and recede into it self: on the contrary, the actions or
motions of this Soul are made, for that this shadowy Spirit, being incited or
stirred up in the whole, or in a certain part, unfolds it self more largely,
and by an emanation, and as it were a certain vibration of the Spirits, exerts
or puts forth its virtue and force of acting.

Both the Senses and Motions of this sensitive Soul are made either transient,
when the Spirits, or its constitutive Particles, being moved somewhere in the
System of the Nerves, draw together with them the containing parts, and deflect
them with the like carriage or gesture with themselves, as is observed in the
five outward Senses, and the local motions of the Members: or else, either both
Actions and Passions are continuing, to wit, when both the Motions and Senses
are silently performed without any great agitation or moving of the body, or
its parts, within the first Fountains of the Soul, viz. the Head it self. These
kind of Passions indeed, made within the substance of the Brain, are the common
Sense and Imagination; but the Actions are Memory, Fantasy, and Appetite: and
either of these, as to their beginnings and instincts, depend for the most part
upon the outward Senses.

Concerning the former, we take notice, that as often as the exterior part of
the Soul being struck, a sensible impression, as it were the Optic Species, or
as an undulation or waving of waters, is carried more inward, bending toward
the chamfered bodies, a perception or inward sense of the Sensation outwardly
had or received, arises. If that this impression, being carried farther, passes
through the callous Body, Imagination follows the Sense: Then if the same
fluctuation of Spirits is struck against the Cortex of the Brain, as its utmost
banks, it impresses on it the image or character of the sensible Object, which,
when it is afterward reflected or bent back, raises up the Memory of the same
thing.

The active Powers of this Soul, viz. Local Motion, Memory, Fantasy, and
Appetite follow sometimes immediately the Passions, sometimes are induced apart
from them upon other occasions. For indeed the sensible impression striking the
streaked or chamfered bodies, oftentimes, the Brain being in no wise affected,
causes the local Motions to be retorted with a reciprocal tendency of the
animal Spirits; so in sleep (the Appetite knowing nothing of it) when pain
troubles, presently we rub the place, moving the hand to it: but more often,
after that the sensible Species, having past from the common Sensory to the
callous Body, has stirred up the Imagination, the Spirits, reflecting from
thence, and flowing back toward the nervous Appendix, raise up the Appetite
and Local Motions, the Executors or Performers of the same: And sometimes a
certain sensible impression, being carried beyond the callous Body, and
striking against the Cortex of the Brain it self, raises up other species lying
hid there, and so induces Memory with Fantasy, also often with Appetite and
Local Motion associates. Further, these active Powers, sometimes upon other
occasions, are wont to be stirred up and exercised apart from Passion. In Man,
the Rational Soul variously moves the sensitive, and at its pleasure draws
forth and brings into act its Powers, sometimes these, sometimes those.
Moreover, the blood boiling up above measure, and by that means striking
impetuously the border of the Brain, excites the species of things lurking in
it, and driving them forward toward the middle or marrowy part of the Brain,
causes also the various Acts of the Fantasy and Memory to be represented.

Concerning the aforesaid interior or abiding Faculties, we shall at present
further take notice, that their more perfect Exercises are chiefly and almost
only performed by the Spirits already perfected and highly elaborated; for
those a making, or that are new made, being numerous, they very much obstruct
and hinder the acts of the animal Function: to wit, when from the Vessels, on
every side watering the Cortex of the Brain, the subtle Liquor is plentifully
instilled for the matter of the animal Spirits, this flowing inwardly stuffs
all the pores and passages of the Brain, and so excludes for that time the
Spirits from their wonted tracts and orbs of expansion. Wherefore whilst the
chief reflection of the Brain and Spirits is celebrated, sleep, or an Eclipse
of the animal Spirits happens; then waking returns, when from the Liquor
instilled, the more subtle part is exalted into very pure Spirits, and at
length the more watery, being partly resolved into Vapors, is exhaled, and
partly supped up by the passages of the Veins entering the substance of the
Brain, or else is sweat out into the vacuity lying under the callous Body.
Concerning these I hope we may discourse more largely afterward. In the mean
time, that we may proceed to the rest of the things proposed, concerning the
frame of the Brain, properly so called, there yet remains that we speak of its
Ventricles: But since they are only a vacuity resulting from the folding up of
its exterior border, I see no reason we have to discourse much of their office,
no more than Astronomers are wont of the empty space contained within the
vacuity of the Sphere.

But in truth, as there is nothing met with in Nature that is not destinated to
some use, surely we suspect this same Vacuum or empty space not to be built in
vain within the Globe of the Brain. The Ancients have so magnified this Cavern,
that they affirmed it the Shop of the animal Spirits, both where they
themselves were procreated, and performed the chief works of the animal
Function. But on the other side, the Moderns or those of later days have
esteemed these places so vile, that they have affirmed the same to be mere
sinks for the carrying out the excrementitious matter. But indeed that opinion
of the Ancients is easily overthrown, for that the animal Spirits, being very
subtle, and apt to fly away, require not such large and open spaces, rather
than the more narrow passages and little pores, such as are made in the
substance of the Brain: for these Spirits (because they ought, for the various
Faculties of the Soul, to be composed into various series, and diverse orders
and dispositions, therefore) ought to be moved within peculiar orbs and tracts.
Further, if any one shall exactly consider the fabric of the Brain, and
seriously weigh, that these Ventricles are not formed out of the primary
intention of Nature, but result only secondarily and accidentally from the
complication of the Brain, he will be far from thinking, that the supreme seat
of the Soul is fixed there, where being hemmed in with a most noble Guard of
Spirits, it does execute and perform its Functions. For it neither appears at
all out of what matter, and by what artifice the Spirits are there begotten,
nor by what ways of emanation they are derived from thence into the other parts
of the Brain and nervous System. Wherefore almost all Anatomists, who are of a
later Age, have attributed that vile office of a Jakes or sink to this more
inward chamber of the Brain. To which Opinion there has been some trust given,
for that these Ventricles are often seen in the dead to be filled with water;
also from these, ways seem to lie open for excretion, both toward the Tunnel,
and also into the Sieve-like Bone. It is observed, that wherever the blood
flows more copiously into any part, and waters it, there Vapors or watery Humors
are begotten from the superfluous Serum left in the circulation, which for the
most part either exhale out through vaporous Effluvia's, or are brought back
into the blood by the Veins or Lymphatick Vessels. But when the blood, by a
plentiful influx, waters not only the Cortex of the Brain, but the interior
marrow also, it remains, that the serous Latex (whenever it abounds more in
the blood, than that its superfluities may be reduced immediately by the Veins,
or by the Lymphaeducts, if they be there, or may be separated by the
Glandula's) should slide down into this den, made hollow within the enfolding
of the Brain. Truly there are many instances, which plainly evince, that the
serous humors are ordinarily laid up in the Ventricles of the Brain. Anatomical
Observations of men dying of many Cephalic diseases, and especially of
soporiferous or sleepy distempers, confirm this. Yea, it may be lawfully
thought, that natural sleep follows, for that the Pores and passages of the
Brain are occupied and stuffed with a watery Latex, which serves for a Vehicle
to the Spirits. Then as often as a profound sleep invades any one from a
Surfeit, or drinking of Wine, the cause is, that the little spaces in the
medullary substance of the Brain, destinated for the motions of the Spirits,
are too much obstructed by a Narcotick or a watery humor: certain relics of
which, being resolved into vapor, and thrust out from the company of the
Spirits, do often sweat out, or drop into this Vacuum or empty space.

After this manner, it may be believed concerning the Ventricles of the Brain,
or the empty space left within its plicature or folding together. But in truth,
because this matter has been very much controverted among Physicians of every
Age, and the right decision of it seems to be of great moment, for the
explicating the offices of the other parts of the Head; I will here compare
together the reasons for and against this Opinion, that we may at length give
our Judgment of this Opinion, what may be either true, or most likely.

CHAP. XII. It is inquired into, whether the serous Humors, heaped together
within the Vacuity of the Brain, be sent out by the Pituitary Glandula and the
Sieve-like Bone, or not?
SInce Experience testifies, that the Serum and excrementitious, I may justly
say morbifick, and oftentimes deadly Humors, are found frequently within these
Ventricles of the Brain; we ought to inquire more diligently concerning their
passage in and out: and the rather, for that it is very much doubted by some
concerning the use of these Dens, nor are there wanting those in this late Age,
who have endeavored to bring into vogue the ancient Opinion, though long since
exploded, concerning the Spirits being begot in this place, and here exercised.
I believe without doubting, for the reasons before alleged, that the Spirits
are not here begotten, nor exercised: and no less certain is it made by
Experience, that the serous Colluvies is here often gathered together. This
therefore only remains, that we should see from whence, and how this flows
hither, and then by what ways of Excretion the same should be carried out.

As to the first, it is exceeding probable, that the serous Latex, which is the
Vehicle of the Spirits newly produced, and is introduced together with them
into the Pores of the Brain, after it is grown stale, and being attenuated into
Vapor, does distill forth into this Cavern, and there at last grows into a
watery Humor: for otherwise what becomes of that Humor, or into what other
Receptacle could it be derived? Besides this ordinary, and I believe assiduous
heaping together of the serous Colluvies within the Ventricles of the Brain,
certainly it may be believed, that this kind of serous Humor is distilled out
of the Glandula's inserted in the Choroeidal enfolding, being too much filled,
into the Ventricles so called. I have often seen in a Dropsy the Glandula's of
the Brain to be intumified, and like grains of Barley, bursting with too much
wet, to become flaccid or withered, so that they could not retain the
ferosities brought to them, but continually disposed them into the Cavity
beneath. Truly in a Dropsy of the Brain these Cavities or Ventricles are
always seen to be full of water; the cause of which kind of distemper is, the
blood being made more watery, puts off in its circulation a greater heap of
Serum than the Veins can presently carry back, or the Glandula's are able to
receive and retain. For indeed, that the Serum, redounding on every side from
the Vessels, may the better slide into the Ventricles of the Brain, it is so
ordered, that the greater infoldings of the Vessels, with the inserted
Glandula's, should be disposed near all the Ventricles of the Head: because,
not only the enfolding Choroeides is placed nigh the concourse of the three
Ventricles in the Brain, but another enfolding, and no less noted, (which we
above described) with greater Glandula's, is set behind the Cerebel nigh the
fourth Ventricle. In all, as it seems, for that end such care is taken, that
the watery part, coming from the blood, which is destinated either for the Brain
or the Cerebel, for that it is not fit for the procreating of Spirits, might
run into these infoldings of the Vessels. But yet if a greater plenty of Serum
be there laid up, than can be contained in them, or may be sent away outwardly,
whatever is superfluous will slide into the Cavity underneath.

Hence it appears, from whence, and by what means the serous heap is gathered
together within the Ventricles of the Brain: certainly to deny this going out
is no other than to assert every ones Brain big with a Viper, which cannot be
brought forth but by gnawing asunder the bowels of its parent. Who shall
lightly consider the parts nigh the Ventricles, and their Fabrics, at first
sight only would swear with the Ancients, that the excrements of the brain were
laid aside both lower through the Tunnel into the Palate, and above or more
forward through the mammillary Processes into the Nostrils: But if the
structure of these parts be a little more diligently searched into, there is no
body who presently will not easily think, that by neither of these ways the
excretion of any humor can be made; for neither from the pituitary Glandula
through the Wedge-like bone, nor from the mammillary Processes through the
holes of the Sieve-like bone, is there any manifest aperture or opening to be
perceived. But in very truth, we do suppose that the brain is in some measure
purged by both these Emunctories, for that objection may be answered, That the
translations of Humors in living Creatures are easily performed through places
that seem impervious or unpassable; for while the Pores and passages in all the
parts of a living Creature are dilated by spirit and heat, they transmit the
rain of the Serum as through the fine texture of a woolen Cloth. This plainly
appears from Arthritick distempers, in which the serous Latex creeps by degrees
through the nervous bodies, and passing through very small spaces, makes a
falling down of humors sometimes upon these parts, and sometimes upon others;
so that it is obvious, that the Membranes and nervous Processes drink in the
serous humors like Sponges, and then by a light compression render them by
heaps, as is manifest in the Toothache; for as often as a Bodkin or Instrument
is put up into a hollow Tooth, clear water will come out plentifully. Indeed,
in the body of a living Creature the passages of humors are not only made
through open passages and channels; but the thinner and more watery Latex creeps
through the solid and smooth bodies of the Nerves, as also the Fibers and the
Membranes, as through the holes of a Filtre, and so is transferred through
imperceptible straits from place to place. I sometime knew in the Impostume of
the Lungs the humor to have been derived through the Membranes growing to the
Pleura from the bag into an Issue made in the side, and so the spitting
ceasing, the disease that seemed otherwise incurable, was healed by such a way
of Evacuation. Why in like manner may we not suppose the serous humors falling
down from the Ventricles of the Brain into the pituitary Glandula, and the
mammillary Processes to be carried away through the Nerves or Membranes passing
through here or there?

Concerning the Tunnel, the thing is probable enough; because the position and
structure of this seem to show, that some humor is carried out of the
Ventricles of the Brain toward the pituitary Glandula. For this part is so
constituted, that a falling down of the humors may be made from every angle and
recess of the interior Brain and its Appendix into its aperture or opening. And
as in several Animals, the figure and site of the Ventricles vary very much,
(as we have already shown) yet in every one of them all the Ventricles of the
Head, whatsoever they be, have their openings gaping toward the Tunnel. But
that this Kernel or Glandula, to which the passage of the Tunnel is inserted,
receives and carries out the serous humors, seems also to appear from hence;
because it admits, not only those falling from the brain into its Pores, but
also those secreted from the blood ascending into the brain: For that in many
four-footed beasts, certain Vessels are inserted to this Glandula from either
Carotidick Artery, which intimately enters its substance: a sign of which is,
that Ink being injected into the Trunk of either Artery, dies with a black
color the wonderful Net, if it be there, and oftener the interior substance of
this Glandula: whence it may be argued, that the office of this Glandula is to
receive the superfluous serosities; and it receives not only those sent away in
the return from the brain, but sometimes preoccupies or prevents them, and is
wont to derive them from the blood before it is carried to the brain. And
therefore this Glandula is very small, if the superfluities of the Serum be
derived to it only from the brain; but greater, if they come to it also from
the blood, to wit, as it executes either one or a double office, as we have
already shown at large.

But as to what respects the way of passing through, to wit, by which the
humors, deposited in this Glandula, are carried out, the vulgar Opinion is,
that they do come away through the holes of the bone beneath into the Palate:
wherefore in those kind of Animals, who have the wonderful Net, and many of its
shoots enter this Glandula, more holes are made in the underlying bone.
Further, if you take away the ditch or gutter of the Wedge-like bone, or the
seat of this Glandula, cut off from the Skull, and pour water upon its holes
being made bare from the Membrane, it passing presently through the substance
of the whole bone, will suddenly still forth through other holes lying open in
the sides of the bone. Yet this Experiment concludes nothing for the Opinion
proposed: because these holes are wholly wanting in some Creatures, and very
much in an humane Skull; in those who have them, as in a Calf, especially it is
observed, that the same are filled by some hollow Vessels; into which if a
black liquor be cast by a Syringe, that passing through the substance of the
bone, will go into many other Vessels lying under the bone, and at length into
the Trunk of the Jugular Vein; which certainly is a sign that the humors are
not carried from hence into the Palate. But as to the Vessels which cover over
the holes of the bone, and which more abundantly lie under the same, they seem
to be either Veins or Lymphaeducts.

But among these it is lawful to conjecture, the chief means of Excretion,
whereby the serous humors, laid up in the pituitary Kernel, may be carried out;
to wit, that they are remanded back from it, as from most other Glandula's or
Kernels, into the mass of blood. In a Calf the thing lies open to ocular
inspection, nor is it to be doubted of other Animals, who have the admirable
Net: because, as the arterious branches, so also the veinous reach to this
Glandula; which sup up not only the humors deposited from the Arteries, but
also those falling from the Ventricles of the Brain. Yea, it may be lawfully
believed, that in a Man also, a Horse, and in other Creatures, who want the
strange or wonderful Net, there are other Lymphaeducts or Water-carriers, or
some such kind of Vessels, as are seen in the head of a Calf, that most
certainly carry the humors from this Glandula. We cannot so easily find out
their footsteps, because, before these break out of their dens, the tracts of
the Lymphaeducts, if there be any, would vanish. Nor can we find out these
Vessels in all, as in a Calf, by injection; because the holes of the bone, by
which, as by the leading of a thread, the injection arrives at, and dies the
Vessels, otherwise lying hid, are wanting in most. No doubt but time will
render sufficiently manifest the reductions of the humors from the pituitary
Glandula in other living Creatures: in the mean time, it may be lawfully
suspected, for that the serosities in some are remanded from thence into the
bloody mass, that in all it is done after the like or the same manner, although
the ways of the passing do not yet sufficiently lie open.

As to the other Emunctory of the Brain, to wit, whereby the serous humors,
laid aside from the Ventricles of the Brain into the mammillary Processes, and
thence are thought to be sent away through the holes of the Sieve like bone:
truly, concerning this way of Excretion, it is much more to be doubted, because
these holes in the defunct being covered over and fully stufft, with the
insertions of the Dura Matter and nervous Fibers, sent on either side from the
mammillary Process, transmit nothing of humor, how clear soever it be. Further,
there is nothing more certain, than that the serous humors are pressed out from
the Glandula's and extremities of the Vessels ending within the Nostrils into
their Caverns; so besides that it is scarce possible for the humors to descend
thither from the brain, it is not absolutely needful to suppose this sort of
means of Excretion. But that we may reason a little farther concerning these;
if it may be lawful to argue from the provision, and from the effects of the
parts, there is no reason but that I may probably believe, that some humors
also do shower down from the Brain into the cavities of the Nostrils: for it
being supposed, that the serous humor passes through, not only open channels,
but the more strict Pores and passages also of the Nerves, and creeping both
through the Fibers and Membranes, as through the straining or holes of a Filter
or Strainer, is carried from place to place, (which it were easy to
demonstrate) what should hinder but that the same sort of Latex may descend
through the Fibers impacted in the holes of the straining bone? For although in
dead Creatures those parts seem to be impervious or unpassable, yet during the
life of the Animal the passages and blind ways of the nervous bodies, being
dilated by Spirit and Heat, most easily transmit a copious humor wherewith they
are watered.

The Sieve-like Bone in diverse Animals is variously perforated for the manifold
necessity and difference of smelling. A Process from the Dura Matter and
manifold nervous Fibers pass through every one of its holes, and besmear the
inside of the Nostrils. But as the impressions of sensible things, or sensible
Species, continued as it were by the undulation or waving of the animal
Spirits, ascend through the passages of these bodies stretched out from the
Organ toward the Sensory; so the humidities watring the same bodies, for as
much as sometimes they may be more superfluous than usual, may distill into the
Nostrils through the same ways. For indeed such humors as are perpetually to be
sent away from the brain, ought so copiously to be poured upon the Organs of
Smelling, as we shall show hereafter, when we shall speak particularly of the
smelling Nerves; in the mean time, that there is such a way of Excretion
opening into the Nostrils, some observations, taken of sick people troubled
with Cephalic diseases, do further persuade. I have known some very obnoxious
to the Scotomy and Vertiginous distempers, who had great plenty of clear water
that distilled forth about the end of the Fit; by which kind of Evacuation, as
it were Critical, the Fit was wont to be ended. Not long since, a Virgin living
in this City, was afflicted a long time with a most cruel Headache, and in the
midst of her pain much and thin yellow Serum daily flowed out from her
Nostrils: the last Winter this Excretion stopped for some time, and then the
sick party growing worse in her Head, fell into cruel Convulsions, with a
stupidity; and within three days dyed Apoplectical. Her Head being opened, that
kind of yellow Latex overflowed the deeper turnings and windings of the Brain
and its interior Cavity or Ventricles. I knew a Gentlewoman that was wont to be
infested with a most cruel Headache, also with a Vertigo, and a frequent
melting of the animal Spirits, or Swooning away; who when she began to be
better, after a grievous Fit, felt at first a creeping motion in the top of her
Brain, as it were the sliding down of water: then that motion passing a little
more forwards and downwards, at length many drops of clear water distilled from
her Nostrils. This Symptom she used to have so ordinarily, that the sick
Gentlewoman did not doubt but that this water stilled out from the brain it
self. I could here bring many other reasons, which might seem to persuade, that
the Ventricles of the Brain, or the Cavity made by the complicature or folding
up of its border, is a mere sink of the excrementitious Humor; and that the
humors there congested, are purged out by the Nose and Palate: But it is time
for us to hasten to other matters, and to pass from the Brain, properly so
called, to its Appendix, viz. the oblong Marrow and the Cerebel.

CHAP. XIII. The Actions and Uses of the oblong Marrow, and of some of its
Parts are unfolded.
WE will pass now from the Brain to the explication of its Trunk, to which both
it and the Cerebel do grow like Mushrooms or large Excrescences. This part is
commonly called the Oblong Marrow; under which name we comprehend all that
substance which reaches from the inmost Cavity of the callous Body, and
conjuncture in the Basis of the Head, to the hole of the hinder part of the
Head; where the same substance, being yet farther continued, ends in the spinal
Marrow.

The superficies of the oblong Marrow, though it be made unequal with some
protuberances and processes, yet it is not variegated or garnished with any
turnings about, and involutions, as it is in the Brain and Cerebel; neither is
its exterior and cortical substance, or of an Ash Color, and the interior,
medullar or marrowy and white; but all its frame or substance is in a sort
marrowy or medullous: nor does it however appear pure and bright, but much
darkened with fibers and hairs variously stretched forth, and diversely going
out. To wit, its fibers being figured in various places, after a diverse
manner, in some places they are found chamfered, and as it were beamy, in
others direct or stretched out at length, and in other places again circular.

The figure of this is forked, and as it were like the Poets Parnassus, seems
like the ter Y: for its shanks arising more forward from either Hemisphere of
the Brain, and inclining one to another, grow together near the center of the
Skull into one and the same Trunk; which notwithstanding, a line being brought
through the midst, seems to be made as it were out of two stalks, and those to
be distinguished in its whole process.

The oblong Marrow seems to be a broad or high Road, into which the animal
Spirits perpetually flow from their double Fountain, to wit, the Brain and the
Cerebel, to be derived from thence into all the nervous parts of the whole
Body: which Spirits, whilst they are orderly disposed in this common passage,
as it were by series and orders, carry a twofold aspect; to wit, they are
directed either outward toward the Nerves, when they exert the loco-motive
Faculty, or they look inward toward their Fountains, when the acts of sense,
or rather the apprehensions of sensible things are performed.

Within this open way, a more large and greatly open path leads straight to the
spinal Marrow, through which the Spirits flow forth to the Nerves, the
Executors of spontaneous Motion in most members. In the mean time, out of the
same tract of the oblong Marrow, lesser paths are carried outwardly, here and
there, by particular Nerves, arising from the same, within the Skull. Also
besides, many diverting places, viz. various processes and protuberances grow
to this medullary Trunk, into which, the Spirits destinated to some peculiar
offices, go apart: lest that all the Spirits traveling this way and that way
in the same path, should meet one another and disturb one another offices.

Whilst after this manner, for the performing the acts of Motion and Sense, we
suppose the animal Spirits to be expatiated within the oblong Marrow; we
affirm, that they are not there begotten, but only exercised. For indeed, they
being created only in the Brain and Cerebel, as they proceed from this or that,
they perform the offices, either of a merely involuntary Function, or else of a
spontaneous, as shall be showed more largely hereafter.

But that we may unfold here all things which belong to the oblong Marrow, I
shall mete it forth from its first coming out to the end of its race, and
handle its several Stadia, diverting places, and cross ways. Where the callous
Body is thought to end, the oblong Marrow begins; to wit, when the medullar
substance of the Brain is thickest nigh the bosses or knobs of either
Hemisphere, a body of a whitish color and somewhat darkened or obscured, and
streaked like Ivory, is joined to that marrow on both sides. These two bodies
are the extremities or tops of the shanks of the oblong Marrow; between which
and the Brain there are nigh and very immediate commerces. Either of these
seems as it were a Cylinder rolled about into an Orb, which nevertheless
constitutes the top of either shank, not spherical, but oval, and something
bent downward in the hinder part. A more large portion of its superficies is
joined to the medullar substance of the Brain; but yet some part of it, being
free from the cohesion with the Brain, shows it self apart, and makes that
protuberance showing it self in either lateral Ventricle. These bodies, if they
should be dissected along through the middle, appear marked, with medullar
streaks, as it were rays or beams: which sort of chamferings or streaks have a
double aspect or tendency; to wit, some descend from the top of this body, as
if they were tracts from the Brain into the oblong Marrow; and others ascend
from the lower part, and meet the aforesaid, as if they were paths of the
Spirits from the oblong Marrow into the Brain. And it is worth observation,
that in the whole Head besides there is no part found chamfered or streaked
after the like manner.

If the use of these be inquired into, this presently occurs, that these
bodies, placed between the Brain and its Appendix, are the great and common
diverting places of either; to wit, which receive whatsoever impulses or forces
of the animal Spirits are sent from either, and communicate them presently to
the other: Or that I may speak more plainly, this part is the common Sensory,
to wit, as Aristotle says, (...), the first Sensory that receives the strokes
of all sensible things, dilated from the Nerves of every Organ, and so causes
the perception of every sense; which kind of strokes of sensible things, when
from hence they are passed further into the Brain, presently Imagination
succeeds the Sense: and further, these bodies, as they receive the forces of
all the Senses, so also the first instincts of spontaneous local motions. To
wit, as often as the Appetite discerns any thing to be done, presently the
reciprocal tendencies of the animal Spirits, that is, from the Brain into these
parts, are disposed here to act the conceptions of motions coming from any part
or member. For here, as in a most famous Mart, the animal Spirits, preparing
for the performance of the thing willed, are directed into appropriate Nerves.
That it is so, it appears, because every influence from the Brain into the
nervous stock, and on the contrary, from this into that, and the mutual
commerce of the animal Spirits, must of necessity pass through these bodies.
Wherefore all the Nerves, also those which belong to the more inward Organs of
the Senses, arise behind these chamfered bodies. For the Optic and smelling
Nerves creep through the superficies of the Brain by a long passage and
windings about, that they might be inserted below this part of the oblong
Marrow.

For indeed, the Species of sensible things, received by those Nerves, might
more immediately be carried to the middle of the Brain, unless that they ought
first to be staid at this Sensory. Further, we may lawfully conjecture, that
these parts perform the aforesaid office from their chamfered, and as it were
beamy contexture: For as those chamferings, with which these bodies are marked,
(as we but now intimated) are of a double kind, to wit, some descending, which
look from the Brain toward the oblong Marrow; and others ascending, which are
carried distinctly from this toward that, it may be lawfully concluded, that
in these carried upwards, the impressions of sensible things are perceived: and
in those tending downwards are performed the Instincts of Motions.

Further, that these bodies, as was said, perform the offices of the first
Sensory, besides the fabric of their parts, and the Analogy to be collected
thence of their use, it seems yet more certainly to appear from some
Observations concerning these chamfered bodies, after what manner they are
affected in Paralytick diseases. For as often as I have opened the bodies of
those who dyed of a long Palsy, and most grievous resolution of the Nerves, I
always found these bodies less firm than others in the Brain, discolored like
filth or dirt, and many chamferings obliterated. Further, in Whelps newly
littered, that want their sight, and hardly perform the other faculties of
motion and sense, these streaks or chamferings, being scarce wholly formed,
appear only rude.

The chamfered Bodies, inclining one to another near their blunt and greater
angles, are almost contiguous; but that the Trunk of the Fornix intervenes with
its twofold Root: yet in that place where the two Roots of the Fornix, being
sent straight down, are inserted into the callous Body, a transverse medullar
process, like a great Nerve, stretched from one chamfered body to the other, as
it were joins the same, and makes them to communicate one with the other.
Certainly, this joining together of the chamfered bodies is made, that their
actions and passions may not be double: but though the species of the sensible
object or conceptions of the motions to be performed, coming from the Brain or
Sensory being double, are carried also double to the first Sensory; yet for as
much as either substance or frame of this, communicates with the other, every
impression coming this or that way, becomes still one and the same. For it may
be observed, in the whole Head, that though almost all things are double, yet
each of them communicate among themselves, either by a contiguity, or by
processes sent forth. And so as by the duplication of it, care is taken against
the absolute privation or defect of the act, so the joining together of its
duplicature provides against the empty or confuse multiplication of the same
species.

After this manner, the chamfered bodies in Man and four-footed Beasts are
constantly found of the same species or form, and in every one of them, figured
after the same manner; and are as it were the Joints that join the Brain to the
shanks of the oblong Marrow. But we have already shown, that in Fowls and
Fishes, whose brains being alike, differ from those of men and four-footed
beasts, the thing is somewhat otherwise: For in Fowls the callous body is
wanting to the brain; but what serves instead of it, is found in the oblong
Marrow, to wit, two little Ventricles show themselves nigh the chambers of the
Optic Nerves, which are arched or chamber'd with a whitish substance, such as
the callous body is in man or four-footed beasts. Then on the contrary, the
chamfered bodies, or the parts which serve in their stead, in Fowls, are not a
portion of the oblong Marrow after the usual manner, but are entered into the
Brain it self. For near the fissure of the Brain, two Membranes being marked
with medullar chamferings, both distinguish either Hemisphere of the Brain, and
cover over its Ventricles. The streaks or rays of either Membrane descend, and
being concentred about the Basis of the Brain, go together into a medullary
process, which is inserted on both sides to the oblong Marrow. So these parts,
viz. the callous body, in which the animal Spirits are expanded, and the
chamfered bodies, in which their passing to and fro is instituted, seem to be
transposed in the head of Fowls. The reason whereof, (as I elsewhere hinted)
unless I be deceived, is this: because these Animals are of less excellency in
Imagination and Memory than four-footed beasts; yea also, for that the sense
and motion of them are their chief Faculties: therefore for the exercises of
these to be performed with a greater expansion of Spirits, the callous body is
transferred into the oblong Marrow, and in its place the chamfered bodies are
removed into the Brain.

About the lower end of either chamfered body the smelling Nerves are inserted.
For you may take notice, that the mammillary Processes, a little more obscure
in man, but much more conspicuous in brute Animals, who are endued with a more
remarkable sense of smelling, do pass into firm and plainly whitish bodies of
Nerves, which being dilated or brought nigh the lateral turnings and windings
of the Brain, are implanted into the oblong Marrow on either side about the
lower angle of either Ventricle behind the chamfered bodies; yet so, that the
Tube or Pipe of either Nerve may open into the Cavity of the Ventricle, as we
before showed. After this manner these Nerves are carried by a long journey
from the forepart of the Brain, that they may bring the sensible species to
the chamfered body, as to the common Sensory, first and rather than to the
Brain. But we shall speak of the smelling Nerves more particularly hereafter.

Where these chamfered Bodies end from either side, a marrowy substance
succeeds, which being somewhat of a darkish color going forward for some
space, is distinguished by a peculiar bending forward from the other contiguous
parts. This Galen (perhaps not improperly) calls the Chambers of the Optic
Nerves; for in this place the Optic Nerves showing themselves from the highest
region of either side, being carried downward with a certain compass, are
united about the Tunnel. Then being divided again, and carried a little
further, enter the Skull, going straight forwards to either Sensory. The
growing together of these Nerves, and their being again separated, seems to be
ordained for this end, that the visible species, received from either Eye,
might appear still the same, and not double; for this conjunction of the
twofold Organ frames the double image into one; which once united, when
afterward it is carried to either side of the common Sensory, for that it is
on both sides alike, appears still the same. If at any time, through
drunkenness, or a distortion of the Eyes, the object appears double, and two
Lights upon a Table, it is because the image of the same thing is received
after a different manner by one Eye than the other, for that reason the objects
are represented like two distinct things. For that this Eye is distorted after
one manner, and that after another, the same Species, coming to either Pupil by
a diverse angle of incidence, appears diverse or double. There is another
reason of the coalition of the Optic Nerves, to wit, that one Eye being hurt,
all the visible animal Spirits might be bestowed on the other. Further, for
that these Nerves are carried with a long passage, their uniting helps to their
mutual strength and support.

Whereas the Optic Nerves arise here from the oblong Marrow, all or its most
intimate substance is not bestowed upon them; but these Nerves are inserted
into the medullar Trunk, as branches of a Tree to the stock, that so they may
receive by that means the influence of the Spirits, and by this way transmit
the Species of visible Things. In the mean time, this more inward substance of
the oblong Marrow is the common passage both to the Eyes and to the other
nervous System arising more backward: through which, by the going and returning
to and fro of the animal Spirits, the impulses of sensible things, and the
instincts of Motions between the Brain and the other nervous parts, which
depend upon it, are performed. Forasmuch as the smelling and seeing Nerves
arise so near the chamfered bodies, the reason hence is plain, why odors or the
objects of the sense of smelling so strike the Brain it self, and immediately
affect it; also why there is so exceeding swift a communication between Sight
and Imagination.

Concerning the Optic Nerves in a man, (which also in some measure is after
the same manner in other living Creatures) we shall advertise you, that when
they, after their uniting or mixing together, being presently again separated,
do go out of the Skull, the sanguiferous Vessels going out of the Skull with
them, and following either Nerve even to the Basis of the Eye, are knit into
the Trunk of either. There is a noted shoot of the Artery destinated to this
office, carried from the anterior branches of the Carotides. Hence, as I
suppose, a reason may be given, wherefore, when by drinking or more plentiful
eating, a sleepiness is caused, presently a great heaviness, and as it were an
oppression, is felt about the Eyes. For when the blood, very much boiling up,
fills above measure the Vessels watering the Brain, and by distending them,
obstructs the Pores of the Brain, those Nerves also from the blood in like
manner boiling up within the Optic Vessels, are pressed together in their
whole passage.

In Fowls and Fishes this chamber of the Optic Nerves, bunching out with a
great bulk, is not much less than the Brain it self; for, as we but now
intimated, what is instead of the callous body is placed here; and in this
place the animal Spirits seem to have their chief Mart or Empory in a most
large medullar chamber, or the Sphere of their Expansion. And so, when from
hence the animal Spirits are derived from so full and plentiful a Storehouse,
it is for that reason Fowls are furnished with so curious an Eye, and with so
highly perspicacious and acute a sight. And the same perhaps may hold
concerning Fishes, if that we consider the sight in these is performed in a
thicker Medium, and often double.

In some Animals, in the midst of these chambers of either Optic Nerve, the
shanks of the oblong, Marrow a little opening, Leave a chink or aperture, which
receiving the serosities coming from every region of the Brain and its
Appendix, sends them through the Tunnel into the pituitary Glandula.

There is no need that we should discourse much here of the Tunnel and the
pituitary Glandula, because, already speaking of the Ventricles of the Brain,
or the empty space left within its plicature, we fell occasionally on the
consideration of both these; where we showed, that the serous humors, which
were wont to be heaped together within many places of the Brain and of its
Appendix, do all slide down on every side from each angle and recess of it into
the steep opening of the Tunnel; and so there is a necessity that they should
be poured out by it into the pituitary Glandula. Further, it is manifest, that
this Glandula, in some Animals, is charged with a double office; to wit, as it
receives the serosities sent from above from the Brain, so also it separates
the humors from the blood brought to the same from the wonderful Net by the
Arteries, and prepossessing them, imbibes them before their ingress to the
Brain. Wherefore this part is furnished with a substance of a double kind: viz.
one reddish, more thin, and interwoven with Blood-carrying Vessels, which
constitutes either side of it; and the other more white placed in the middle,
to which the Tunnel is inserted.

Fig: VIIIa
oblong marrow of a sheep

But having shown, that this Glandula receives the humors so brought by a
double Tribute, we did diligently inquire concerning the ways and means whereby
they are at length carried away from thence: and as it appears by an
Experiment, that there is a passage open from this Glandula into the Vessels
lying underneath the bone, and from thence into the Jugular Veins, we affirmed,
that 'twas most likely, that the humors to be carried away from this Glandula,
(after the manner of others) may be reduced at last into the bloody mass. I
shall not add any more concerning these things, but proceed to the other parts
of the oblong Marrow. But that, what has been said, concerning the shanks of
the oblong Marrow, and their tops, viz. the chamfered bodies, may be the better
understood, it will seem to the purpose that we represent the Images of all
these in the following Figure.

CHAP. XIV. Of the Uses of the Pineal Glandula and the Choroeidal Enfolding;
also of the orbicular Prominences which are commonly called Nates and Testes;
and other Parts which seem to be dependences of them.
BElow the Chambers of the Optic Nerves in a common Valley which lies between
the tops of these and the Buttock-form Prominences, is placed the Pineal
Glandula or Kernel in form of a Pineapple, called also Conarium; this is not
only found in Man and four-footed beasts, but Fowls and Fishes also are endued
with the same. Wherefore, although from hence it may be concluded, that this is
of necessary use; yet we can scarce believe this to be the seat of the Soul, or
its chief Faculties to arise from it; because Animals, which seem to be almost
quite destitute of Imagination, Memory, and other superior Powers of the Soul,
have this Glandula or Kernel large and fair enough.

It is observed in all Animals of every kind and form, that to this Glandula,
always placed nigh the holes or passages, open to the Tunnel, the Choroeidal
Enfolding is continually joined; yea this enfolding (seeming to hang from the
Pineal Kernel sustaining its middle Process, as it were by a nail or hasp, from
thence) is divided into two wings stretching out on either side upon the shanks
of the oblong Marrow, Wherefore we may justly suspect, that this Glandula is
chiefly made for the sake of this enfolding; and that the office of it is no
other than of other Kernels, which are placed nigh the concourse of the
sanguiferous Vessels: to wit, that it may receive and retain within it the
serous humors deposited from the arterious blood, till the Veins being emptied,
may sup them back, or the Lymphaeducts (if there be any there) may convey them
outwardly. For it is observed, that the Choroeidal enfolding is beset with very
many lesser Glandula's or Kernels, and every where interwoven with them, which
imbibe the Serum secreted from the blood, in the smaller Vessels; therefore for
this very same office, where all the Vessels concur, this Kernel is placed, of
a bigger bulk, that it might be able to receive and contain the serosities
there plentifully deposited. Moreover, it is of no small moment, that this
Glandula sustains and keeps duly stretched out the Chroeidal enfolding
otherwise hanging loose, and apt to fall down into it self, or at least to
slide out of its proper place. Wherefore I have often taken notice in the
Dropsy of the Brain, that this Glandula being loosned at the roots by too much
moisture, and often broken off, and removed from its place, the Choroeidal
enfolding has slid together from its proper expansion, and slipped down lower,
and also suffered its Vessels to be folded together disorderly.

From these things thus premised concerning the pineal Glandula, it will not be
difficult to assign also the use of the Choroeidal enfolding: Concerning which
there will be little need to refel that Opinion of the common sort, which
asserts, That the animal Spirits, to be bestowed upon the whole Brain, are
begot in this enfolding: because the Vessels of this instill nothing to the
substance of the Brain or its Appendix, for that they are no where inserted to
it; but it was before shown, that the Ventricles of the Brain, or the Cavity in
which these same Vessels are hung, do not at all contain the Spirits; which
further appears more plain, because in Cephalic diseases those Ventricles are
filled with water, and the continuity of the enfolding is dissolved by too much
moisture, when in the mean time the sick are indifferently strong in the
exercise of the animal Faculties.

But indeed we suppose, that this enfolding serves for a twofold office: viz.
First, that the more watery part of the blood, destinated for the Brain, might
be sent away into its Vessels, to the end, that the remaining portion of the
bloody Latex might become more pure and free from dregs to be distilled forth
into Spirits; even as is wont to be done in a Chemical Distillation, to wit,
when there is a peculiar Receiver fitted for the receiving of the Phlegm by it
self, more sincere, pure, and subtle Spirits are instilled into the other more
noted Receiver. The more watery blood entering the arterious Vessels of this
Enfolding, being carried from them into the Veins, is remanded back toward the
Heart. In the mean time, lest the Serum, too much redounding, and boiling up in
these Vessels, might hinder circulation, its superfluities are received for
some time both by the lesser Glandula's thickly inserted, and also by the
pineal Kernel.

The other and no less noted use of this Enfolding, is to conserve the heat of
the blood boiling within the complications of the Vessels, and as it were
circulating about, being excited as from a fireplace within the enfolding of
the Brain. For though the Pia Matter need not implant thick shoots of Vessels in
the callous Body and inward Marrows of the Brain, for that they are rather
dedicated to the Exercise than to the Generation of the animal Spirits; yet
that the heat requisite for the circulation of the Spirits, might be kept
constantly in that place, this enfolding is hung upon the whole neighborhood.
For as the blood, aggested or heaped together within the Cavities of the
Bosoms, is instead of an hot Bath, whereby the animal Spirits are distilled
plentifully into the outmost and cortical part of the brain; so the blood
contained within the small Vessels of this enfolding, seems to be in the place
of a lesser and more temperate Bath, whereby the same Spirits might be fitly
circulated in the more inward and medullar substance.

Lastly, Another reason may also be given, why the Choroeidal enfolding is
found always within the Ventricles or Cavity of the Brain, made by its
enfolding, and after what manner soever figured; to wit, that another sort of
commodity might result from thence; that when the Vessels of that Enfolding,
carrying too watery blood, lay aside more Serum than the Glandula's are able to
receive or contain, what is superfluous might slide down opportunely into the
underlying Cavity, as into a Sink. Wherefore the Pineal Glandula, though set in
a more eminent place, is however placed always near the hole or passage that
lies open toward the Tunnel in every brain.

Next to the Pineal Kernel are found in the upper superficies of the oblong
Marrow certain noted Prominences, which are commonly called Nates and Testes.
These being placed near together, do constitute as it were four Mole-hills,
which yet are joined one to another by certain processes. Beneath these
Mole-hills, or rather between the joining of them and the trunk of the oblong
Marrow, placed underneath, a narrow and long Cavity or Den is left, which by
some Anatomists is called the fourth Ventricle; but according to others later,
who place the fourth Ventricle under the Cerebel, this Cavity is affirmed to be
a passage to it.

The hinder extremity of this Den ends nigh the beginning of the fourth
Ventricle; the more fore-extremity of it opens before the former Mole-hills or
little bulkings out, called Nates. From the midst of this Cavity or narrow Den
a passage goes straight to the Tunnel. It is very much controverted among
Anatomists concerning the site of these parts, and of their dependency on one
another, and of other parts, and of their use: Concerning which this is first
to be noted, as we hinted above, that these four Protuberances are far greater
in some brute Animals than in a Man, as in a Sheep, Calf, Goat, and the like;
also in a sound, dry, and old Head they are more conspicuous, and their
processes, joynings, and habitudes may be more easily noted than in a younger,
moist, or otherwise sickly brain. Indeed the use of these (unless my conjecture
deceives me) seems far more noble, than that they should deserve those vile
names of Nates and Testes, Buttocks and Testicles.

Notwithstanding, to what office these parts were designed, neither have the
ancient Anatomists delivered, nor will it, by the help of Reason, be easy to
guess for certain. We have already shown, that these aforesaid Prominences
ought not to be taken for the two shanks either of the Brain or Cerebel bending
back one toward another, and so growing together into the oblong Marrow. For
although from this supposition a very neat Hypothesis may be made for the
economy of the animal Function, to wit, by affirming that these double shanks,
on either side, were so many distinct ways of passage through which the animal
Spirits, for the performing of motions, flowed from the Brain and Cerebel into
the oblong Marrow, and returned thence from this into those for the performing
the acts of the Senses: yet from our Method of Dissecting it plainly appears,
that the brain is not fixed to the oblong Marrow nigh this place, but far above
it; so that indeed the anterior Prominences, unless mediately only, viz. by the
chamfered bodies, receive not any portion of the medullar stock, or any
influence from the brain, nor can have any dependency from it. Besides, if the
Protuberances called Nates were shanks of the brain, why should the same be in
man, (he having got the greatest brain, the least) or at least lesser than in
most other living Creatures? Then between the Prominences called Testes and the
Cerebel, although there happens a certain communication; yet it seems that
there lies open a passage from those little lumps into the Cerebel, and not
from this, through them into the oblong Marrow. For out of these aforesaid
Prominences a medullar Process ascends obliquely on either side into the
Cerebel, by whose passage the animal Spirits, tending from one stage to the
other, cause a mutual commerce between those parts and the Cerebel: But indeed
the Processes which lead from the Cerebel into the oblong Marrow, and carry to
it its influences, being distinct from the former, stand somewhat lower, as
shall be more clearly shown hereafter, when we shall speak of the Cerebel.

But in the mean time, concerning the offices and uses to which the aforesaid
Protuberances serve, we shall make this conjecture. The animal Spirits
perpetually flow out and leap back again from the fountain the brain into the
oblong marrow, so that there may be had a constant commerce between the brain
and many organs of sense and spontaneous motion: from which those parts are
entertained which perform their actions, not at the beck of the Appetite, but
either by the instinct of Nature, or the blind impulse of the Passions; for
such receive wholly their influences from the Cerebel, as afterward shall be
more fully showed. Whilst therefore the Spirits, flowing from the brain, abound
in the oblong marrow, it is fit that some of them should be carried from thence
into the Cerebel: (for what uses this ought to be done, shall be told by and
by) wherefore from either side of the oblong marrow a Protuberance grows forth,
into which indeed the Spirits designed for the Cerebel, may go apart from the
common passage of the oblong marrow; and these Prominences are the former,
which are commonly called Nates, and, as we have said, are far greater in most
brute Animals than in man (the reason of which shall be declared anon.) The
other hinder Protuberances, commonly called Testes, grow to these former, and
are only certain Epiphyses or Excrescences of them, as it were the heads of the
medullary Processes, which are from thence carried by an oblique ascent into
the Cerebel; for when the animal Spirits ascend from the former Prominences
into the Cerebel, they enter these latter first, as it were the more large
beginnings or entrances of their passage, from whence they go forward by the
passage of the medullar Processes into the Cerebel.

Besides we may take notice, that when the animal Spirits are carried out of
the oblong marrow into the greater natiform Prominences to be derived toward
the Cerebel, they, according to their custom, (as often as they tend toward
the common Sensory from a double Organ of any Faculty) ought to be confounded
and mingled together before they enter the Cerebel: wherefore both the first
Prominences, and also the second growing to them are joined together with
certain Processes like wings reaching one another; which connection indeed of
them, because it ought to be distinguished every where from the medullar Trunk
lying under it hence, from the separation or empty space that comes between the
oblong marrow and the growing together of the Prominences, that cavity arises,
which is by some called the fourth Ventricle, and by others the passage to it.

If it be yet farther inquired, to what end the animal Spirits are carried by
this by-passage from the common passage of the oblong marrow into the Cerebel,
and thence back again; I say, that this is done for a twofold respect, viz.
both that the Passions or Affections of the sensitive Soul, begun from the
brain, may be transmitted to the Praecordia and Viscera; then secondly, that
the natural Instincts, excited in the Praecordia and Viscera, might be
communicated to the brain. These reciprocal commerces which are had between the
brain and the Organs of involuntary Functions, ought to be instituted or
performed by this private passage, lest otherwise the exercises of these
involuntary Faculties should very much disturb the acts of the outward Senses,
or the intentions of spontaneous motions.

As to the first, it is observed, that by every passion of the sensitive Soul,
as from Anger, Sadness, Pleasure, and other Affections, the Praecordia are
disturbed, whether we will or no; which variously dilate or constrain
themselves, and so stir up in the blood diverse fluctuations. Moreover, from
this kind of force of the Passions the countenance or the aspects of the Face
are wont to be altered and distorted after various ways. The reason of all
these seems to be, because when the animal Spirits, existing within the brain,
are moved according to the Idea of the conceived Passion, the other Spirits
also flowing within these diverting places, being in like manner moved, affect
the Cerebel, and that coming between, the original of the Nerves, serving to
the Praecordia, Viscera, and Muscles of the Face, and so the parts to which
those Nerves are distributed, are also stirred up or provoked into motions
answerable to the same passion.

But the aforesaid Prominences and their dependences serve no less also for the
conveying of the impressions of natural Instincts to the Brain, that from
thence the Appetite and local motions might presently be retorted: by which all
the exigencies or wants perceived by the Praecordia or Viscera might be
supplied. When in a young one newly born the stomach cries out for hunger, the
Instinct of this is carried by the passage of the Nerves to the Cerebel, and
from thence by the medullar Processes to these Protuberances; and the Spirits
there inhabiting, form the Idea of the impression, and carry it to the brain,
wherein presently, without any previous knowledge or experience, such kind of
conceptions of the Soul are stirred up, that every little living Creature
presently seeks out the Mothers breasts and sucks.

But it may be objected, it does not seem of necessity we should suppose these
kind of acts of the Passions and Instincts to be made apart in this by-place;
for why are not the commerces of the animal Spirits ordained by the influence
from the Brain into the Nerves leading to the Praecordia and so back again
through the common passage of the oblong Marrow? But to that it may be readily
answered, That this reciprocal motion of the Spirits ought to be made through
the middle region of the Cerebel, from one stage to another for the exercise of
these Faculties: And therefore (since that all manner of communication between
the Brain and Cerebel is performed by these Prominences) there should also be
had a passage by the same way between this and the Organs of the Functions
merely natural. Besides, if the rage or furious motions of the Passions and
Instincts should be carried in the same path in which the forces of sensible
things are carried, their acts might be greatly confounded by the mutual
meeting or gathering together of the animal Spirits. But this kind of
Hypothesis concerning the Acts and Progress of the Passions and natural
Instincts, shall be made more clear afterward, when we design the Actions and
Uses of the Cerebel, and of the other parts, which in like manner seem to be
destinated to the same offices with these Protuberances.

In the mean time, what we have affirmed, that the latter Prominences are only
Additionals or Excrescences of the former, will clearly appear to any one
beholding them. But this, as we have already hinted, is seen without
Controversy in the brains of a Calf, a Sheep* and some other four footed
beasts; where, when the Nates are signally great, the Testes grow to the same
in a very small bulk. Further, that the medullary Processes lead from these
into the Cerebel, and convey the animal Spirits by this by-path, is so
manifest, that none who has carefully beheld these parts, can be able any
further to hesitate or be doubtful of it. For indeed the little hairs or fibers
wherewith these processes, ascending into the Cerebel, are marked, are
otherwise figured and placed than those which are beheld in the neighboring
process descending from the Cerebel toward the oblong Marrow.

Moreover, either pair of Prominences do not only communicate among themselves
mutually by their stretched out wings, but also another medullar Process, going
cross-wise, knits together the aforesaid Processes stretched out from thence
into the Cerebel; and from this joining together of them two small Nerves are
produced, which bending down on either side, and being carried forward, enter
the Dura Matter, and so go straight through it, till having reached to the
moving Nerves of the Eyes, they go forth of the Skull at the same hole with
them, going forward straight to the Trochlear Muscle of the Eye. Concerning
these little Nerves it is observed, that when many others proceed from the
sides or the Basis of the oblong Marrow, these arise from the aforesaid
Prominences in the bunching forth at the top. The reason of which, if I be not
mistaken, is this: We have affirmed, that these Prominences do receive and
communicate to the Brain the natural Instinct delivered from the Heart and
Bowels to the Cerebel; and on the other side, or back again, do transfer
toward the Praecordia, by the mediation of the Cerebel, the forces of the
Passions or Affections received from the Brain; but in either action the motion
of the Eyes is affected with a certain manifest Sympathy. For if pain, want, or
any other signal trouble afflicts the Viscera or the Praecordia, a dejected and
cast down aspect of the Eyes will declare the sense of its trouble: when on the
contrary, in Joy, or any pleasant Affection of the Praecordia or Viscera, the
Eyes are made lively and sparkle again. In like manner, the Eyes do so clearly
show the Affections of the Mind, as Sadness, Anger, Hatred, Love, and other
perturbations, that those who are affected, though they should dissemble,
cannot hide the feeling and intimate conceptions of the mind. Without doubt
these so happen, because the animal Spirits, tending this way and that way in
this diverting place between the Brain and the Praecordia, do at once strike
those Nerves as the strings of a Harp. Wherefore from this kind of conjecture
which we have made concerning the use of these Nerves, we have called them
Pathetical, although indeed other Nerves also may deserve this name.

There yet remains for us to take notice of the aforesaid Prominences, that
either of these pairs, and the Processes hanging on them, are distinguished
from the trunk of the oblong Marrow lying under by the Cavity between them; so
that this Cavity or Ventricle seems to exist only secondarily, because the
empty space between the aforesaid bodies, placed above and beneath, separating
the same one from another, ought to come between. But this Cavity seeming to
result so by accident, has a very signal use; for in the middle of its passage
a sloping aperture reaches toward the Tunnel, through which the humors sliding
into either of its holes, one made more forward, the other more backward, are
sent out. The more forward hole is placed between the chambers of the Optic
Nerves, a little before the pineal Glandula, into which the serous heap being
laid up nigh to the confines of the oblong Marrow, slides by degrees: but the
other hole is opened more backward into the fourth Ventricle which is planted
under the Cerebel; which hole is covered with a thin Membrane, which girding
about its mouth and that of the Cerebel, provides lest the humors, derived from
the fourth Ventricle, or the confines of the Cerebel, should fall down any
other way than into that hole; but if at any time that little hole be broken
asunder by a deluge of the Serum, the watery Latex sliding down upon the Basis
of the oblong Marrow, overwhelms the origines of the Nerves, and so brings
Convulsive distempers and meltings, and not seldom deadly, of the vital
Spirits, as I have observed in the bodies of many dying of Cephalic Diseases.

CHAP. XV. Of the Uses of the Cerebel, and of some of its Parts and Processes.
HAving hitherto continued the former Tract of the oblong Marrow, which as it
were the Kings Highway, leads from the Brain, as the Metropolis, into many
Provinces of the nervous stock, by private recesses and cross-ways; it follows
now that we view the other City of the animal Kingdom. The situation of this
being remote enough from the former, its kind of structure is also different
from it: yea it seems that there are granted to this, as to a free and
municipal City, certain Privileges and a peculiar Jurisdiction.

The Cerebel is placed a little below the orbicular Prominences in the hinder
part of the Head; where growing to the trunk of the oblong Marrow by a double
little foot, it appears almost of a Spherical figure. Its superior gibbosity
coheres toward the superficies to the border of the Brain by the intervention
of the Pia Matter; but nevertheless it is intimately united to it, nor is there
any immediate commerce between this or that or their parts. There has been
spoken enough already of the figure and situation of the Cerebel, and of its
various Processes, and how it is fastened to the oblong Marrow; it now remains
that we proceed to design or draw out the offices and uses of it, and its
several parts. Where in the first place shall be inquired into, what kind of
office the Cerebel is endued with in the animal economy; then when we shall
descend to particulars, there are more things worthy to be noted, which will
offer themselves to our consideration: viz. first the infoldings of the Vessels
covering the whole compass of the Cerebel, and especially its hinder part, with
the heap of Kernels: secondly, its folds and lappets ordained with a certain
and determinate series, and almost after a like manner in all: thirdly, the
double substance of the folds, viz. cortical and marrowy: and the concentring
of all the medullary tracts in two large Marrows or middests: fourthly, either
little foot or pedestal of the Cerebel made out of those two middle Marrows:
and in either pedestal three distinct medullar Processes to be found: fifthly,
the annular Protuberance made by a process of the Cerebel descending into the
medullar Trunk: sixthly, some Nerves, which arising immediately from this
Protuberance and other Nerves in the neighborhood, which being designed for
the involuntary Function, receive the influences of the animal Spirits from the
Cerebel: Lastly, the Ventricle or Cavity lying under the Cerebel ought to be
considered.

1. As to the office or use of the Cerebel in general: nothing of it occurs,
spoken by the Ancients, worthy its fabric, or agreeable to its structure. Some
affirm this to be another Brain, and to perform the same actions with it: but
if any one should have a soft and foolish Brain, I greatly doubt, if he should
become wise, though he should obtain perhaps a more hard and solid Cerebel.
Others place the Memory in this part, supposing the Cerebel to be as it were a
Chest or Box, wherein the Idea's or images of things, before laid up, are kept
apart from the incourse of fresh Species. But it is far more probable, that
this faculty resides in the cortical spires of the Brain, as we have elsewhere
shown. For as often as we endeavor to remember objects long since past, we rub
the Temples and the forepart of the Head, we erect the Brain, and stir up or
awaken the Spirits dwelling in that place, as if endeavoring to find out
something lurking there; in the mean time, there is perceived nothing of
endeavor or striving motion in the hinder part of the Head. Besides, we have
shown, that the Fantasy and Imagination are performed in the Brain; but the
Memory depends so upon the Imagination, that it seems to be only a reflected or
inverse act of this: wherefore that it should be placed with it in the same
Cloister, to wit, in the Brain, is but necessary; for it plainly appears, that
there is no immediate commerce between the Brain and the Cerebel.

When some time past I diligently and seriously meditated on the office of the
Cerebel, and revolved in my mind several things concerning it, at length, from
the Analogy and frequent Ratiocination, this (as I think) true and genuine use
of it occurred; to wit, that the Cerebel is a peculiar Fountain of animal
Spirits designed for some works, and wholly distinct from the Brain. Within the
Brain, Imagination, Memory, Discourse, and other more superior Acts of the
animal Function are performed; besides, the animal Spirits flow also from it
into the nervous stock; by which all the spontaneous motions, to wit, of which
we are knowing and will, are performed. But the office of the Cerebel seems to
be for the animal Spirits to supply some Nerves; by which involuntary actions
(such as are the beating of the Heart, easy Respiration, the Concoction of the
Aliment, the protrusion of the Chyle, and many others) which are made after a
constant manner unknown to us, or whether we will or no, are performed. As
often as we go about voluntary motion, we seem as it were to perceive within us
the Spirits residing within the forepart of the Head to be stirred up to
action, or an influx. But the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel perform
unperceivedly and silently their works of Nature without our knowledge or care.
Wherefore whilst the Brain is garnished as it were with uncertain Meanders and
crankling turnings and windings about, the compass of this is furnished with
folds and lappets disposed in an orderly series; in the spaces of which, as in
designed Orbs and Tracts, the animal Spirits are expanded according to the Rule
and Method naturally impressed on them. For indeed those in the Cerebel, as it
were in a certain artificial Machine or Clock, seem orderly disposed after that
manner within certain little places and boundaries, that they may flow out
orderly of their own accord one series after another without any driver, which
may govern or moderate their motions. Wherefore forasmuch as some Nerves
perform some kind of motions according to the instincts and wants of Nature,
without consulting the government of the will or appetite within the Brain, why
may it not be imagined, that the influence of the Spirits is derived wholly
from the Cerebel for the performing of these? For it seems inconvenient, that
for these offices which should be performed without any tumult or perturbation,
the Spirits should be called out of the Brain, which are continually driven
into fluctuations as it were with the winds of Passions and Cogitations.

As I only imagined of the use of the Cerebel after this manner, I was led to
it at length by a certain thread of Ratiocination; to which afterward happened
an Anatomical inspection, which plainly confirmed me in this opinion. For in
the frequent Dissection of the Heads of several sorts of Animals certain
Observations did occur, which seemed to put this matter out of all doubt. For I
first observed, the pairs of Nerves, which did serve to the Functions, wont to
be performed by the Instinct of Nature, or the force of the Passions, rather
than by the beck of the will, so immediately to depend on the Cerebel, that
from thence only the influence of the animal Spirits seems to be derived into
their origines or beginnings. By what means the Nerves arising from the
Cerebel, or receiving from it the provision of the animal Spirits, do perform
only involuntary actions, shall be declared hereafter; in the mean time, for
the confirmation of this Opinion, we have in readiness another Reason of no
less moment.

Therefore secondly, we took notice, that not only the conformation or make of
the Cerebel was ordained after a certain and peculiar manner, that is, that its
frame or bulk was couched together with folds or little circles, disposed in a
certain distinct series, and apt method, and proportionate within themselves,
as has been said; whence it may be argued, that the Spirits arising from
hence, and flowing outwardly, are employed or bestowed on some certain works
determinate to one thing. But further it is observed, that in all Animals,
although they differ in form and kind, yet the figure of the Cerebel is always
very like or wholly the same. The Brain and oblong Marrow are figured in many
after a diverse manner; for as we have showed before, there is some difference
of these parts found in man and four-footed beasts: but between either of
these, and Fowls and Fishes, there is a notable difference as to these parts.
Notwithstanding in all these the Cerebel, furnished wholly with the same
lappets or little circles alike infolded one in another, is marked with the
same form and proportion; which certainly is a sign that the animal Spirits in
this workhouse are begotten and dispensed, as it were by a certain dimension,
for certain necessary offices, which are performed in all after the same
manner; and which cannot be any other than the motions and actions of the
Viscera and Praecordia. As to the other Faculties, of which sort are
Imagination, Memory, Appetite, yea local motions and sense are exercised after
one manner in those living Creatures, and after another manner in others;
wherefore their brains are formed after a diverse manner. But the motions of the
Heart and Respiration in all endued with an hot blood, are performed after a
like manner, that is, with a perpetual vicissititude of Systoles and Diastoles.
Besides, another office is to be assigned to the Cerebel, and different from
what is convenient or agreeable to the Brain; because where the folds and
turnings are wanting in the Brain, they are constantly found in the Cerebel.
Besides these reasons drawn from Anatomy, the Pathology of the humane Body
affords many others, which confirm the aforesaid office of the Cerebel. For it
oftentimes happens, that cruel and horrid Symptoms infest the Praecordia and
the region of the middle or lowest Belly; whilst in the mean time, the
morbifick cause lies in the Cerebel or nigh its confines. I have known
sometimes men laboring only in appearance with a Dyscrasie of the hinder part
of the Head, who complained of frequent Swooning and repeated meltings of the
Spirits or Deliquiums, as if they were just dying: in whom notwithstanding
nothing more could be detected of the morbifick cause or its seat, but that the
Patient perceived a great heaviness and pain in the hinder part of the Head,
and that upon any sudden motion or bending back of the Head, they were ready to
dye. In truth, the Symptoms which are wont to be raised up in the distemper
called the Incubus or Nightmare, viz. loss of speech, and a mighty weight or
load that seems to lie upon the breast, proceed altogether from the morbifick
matter fixed in the confines of the Cerebel, and obstructing the passages of
the Spirits destinated for the Praecordia. But indeed this Hypothesis of the
office of the Cerebel shall be more illustrated and confirmed from the uses of
its several parts, being rightly designed or drawn forth.

As to the parts and accidents of the Cerebel, 1. we take notice, that the
infoldings of the Vessels every where cloth the Cerebel no less than the
Brain, also that the ridges and furrows of its folds intimately hide or cover
it, which certainly is a sign that the animal Spirits are begotten in this
other workhouse of them from the watering blood, and instilled into its
substance: which thing also more clearly appears, because the Arteries and
Veins are not only variously complicated in the superficies of the Cerebel, but
both of them in like manner as in the Brain, send forth frequent shoots into
its more inward substance; wherefore whilst the most subtle and spirituous part
of the blood being carried through long windings about, and as it were
serpentine channels of the Vessels, and so sublimed into Spirits is received
within; the bloody part is carried away by the shoots of the Veins sent also
deeply down. Further, even as the more watery portion of the blood, destinated
for the Brain, runs into the Choroeidal enfolding; (whereby it may there lay
aside its unprofitable Phlegm into the Glandula's) so for the sake of
separating the Phlegm an heap of Glandula's, with the foldings of the Vessels,
as it were a Receptacle fitted for this business, is placed in the hinder
region of the Cerebel.

2. From the blood, after this manner cleared from Phlegm, and made subtle by a
long circulation, a very pure and spirituous liquor is instilled into the
cortical substance of the Cerebel, which is presently exalted by the Ferment
there placed into animal Spirits. For indeed we have affirmed, that the Spirits
are procreated only in the cortical part of the Cerebel, as in that of the
Brain: wherefore, because this kind of Cortex is wanting to the oblong and
spinal Marrow, we think these parts do serve only for the exercise of the
animal Spirits, and not for their production.

3. The Spirits every where produced within the cortical or exterior compass of
the Cerebel, in which they are presently prepared for the work of the animal
Function, are derived from all the folds into the medullar tract, and thence
into two ample middle Marrows; where they keep full as it were the fountain or
spring, and there like the bubling up of waters, are circulated within with a
perpetual turning, and from thence they continually stream forth into the parts
of the nervous System proper to themselves.

4. As to the ways of Emanation it is observed, that the two middle Marrows of
the Cerebel pass as it were into two pedestals or little feet, by which they
are fastened to the trunk of the oblong Marrow; and for that in either little
foot of it three distinct medullar Processes are found, all these, or at least
two of them, are as it were so many paths whereby the animal Spirits stream
forth from their fountain and flow back again.

5. The first of these Processes ascends into the Cerebel from the orbicular
Prominences: the use of this we have already declared; to wit, that there may
be a certain passage between these Prominences and the Cerebel, in which,
whilst the animal Spirits, as in a by-path, move this way and that way, to and
fro, they may transmit both the force of the Passions from the Brain by the
interposition of the Cerebel to the Praecordia, and convey also the natural
Instincts delivered to the Cerebel from the Praecordia and Viscera toward the
Brain. But the second Process descending straight from the Cerebel, embraces
the medullar Trunk, and so going round about it, constitutes the annular or
ringy Protuberance, out of which the fifth, sixth, and seventh pair of Nerves
take their originals; so indeed, that this Protuberance seems to be the
Warehouse or Storehouse of the Spirits flowing from the Cerebel, from which
they may influence and be derived into the opposite passages of the Nerves.
Lastly, the third process of either little foot, descending from the Cerebel
into the oblong Marrow, is inserted into its trunk over against where the
eighth pair of Nerves have their original; so that it should seem very likely,
the provision of the Spirits destinated for this Nerve is derived also by this
way from the Cerebel; then what Spirits superabound, remaining longer than this
Nerve requires, they sliding down into the common belly or chanel of the oblong
and spinal Marrow, increase the plenty of those parts. For this same end the
smooth and pyramidal bodies are reached out of the annular Protuberance above
the oblong Marrow toward the Spine, to wit, that by the passage of those
Processes the Spirits of that provision or stock superabounding, might flow out
partly into the beginning of the eighth pair, and partly into the common tract
of the medullar Trunk.

Thus much we have spoken briefly and summarily of the Uses of the Cerebel, and
of its parts and Processes. But that it may be the better understood, and also
that this new thought of Theory concerning the involuntary Function of the
animal Regiment, may be more clearly illustrated, we shall here give you a more
particular Order or Method of the Spirits brought forth in the Cerebel, and as
it were take a view of, or muster their Arms or Forces. Further, it will seem
to the purpose, that we should design or draw forth more openly the abundance
or plenty of the Nerves receiving their gifts from this Fountain of the Spirits
concerning the Acts to be performed only of the involuntary Function.

CHAP. XVI. Of the various Order and diverse manner of Exercise of the Spirits
produced in the Cerebel for the Acts of the involuntary Function.
AFter having shown, that the office of the Cerebel is to procreate animal
Spirits apart from the Spirits begotten in the Brain, and to dispense them into
the Nerves, the Executors of the involuntary Actions and Passions; there yet
remains to be unfolded by what manner of economy or government the Spirits
inhabiting the Cerebel and made free, are busied both by an intestine
Circulation, within their proper dwelling places, and also are wont to be
expanded and flow out with an exterior irradiation for the necessities and
wants of other parts: then these things being shown, we shall design more
particularly the Uses and Offices of the Nerves, and of some other Processes
doing service to this Government.

As to the first, as the Cerebel is the other primary Root of the sensitive
Soul, or the Fountain from whence the animal Spirits, being diffused through
the whole substance of it and its Appendix, are continued still under the same
Systasis and radiant Contexture, it is to be noted, that this radiation of the
Spirits from the Cerebel does flow after another manner than the other from the
Brain: because this being left to it self, is bestowed by a constant efflux or
flowing out on the Organs both of the vital Function and the merely natural,
and its expenses by an equal continual provision of Spirits, are made up again
from the bloody mass continually instilled in. But on the contrary, the Spirits
flow out from the Brain, neither by such a continual course without
intermission and by little and little, nor are sustained by a perpetual
provision and sliding in by degrees; but both the loss of them, and their
refection, are uncertain, unequal, and variously interrupted. For neither are
the spontaneous Acts of the Function it self, to which they serve, performed
after any constant or always the same manner; but according to exterior
accidents and occasions we put them forth by heaps, and with a certain force
sometimes, and again sometimes we suffer them to be wholly intermitted and
unimployed. Therefore the Spirits also are in like manner supplied with an
uncertain measure; to wit, they are instilled in sleep plentifully and more
copiously, but waking more sparingly and with hard labor, or scarce not at
all. Yea the involuntary portion it self of the sensitive Soul (which flows
from the Cerebel) for that it has a near commerce and affinity (as was already
said) with the other radicated in the Brain, therefore it is wont to be much
disturbed in the performing its office equally and peaceably, and being
variously affected and agitated by the impulses sent here and there, or from
this place and that, it is compelled, sometimes to contract, sometimes to
extend its Systasis in the whole or in part, and so is rendered obnoxious to
several Passions, and ordinarily instigated to the performing irregular and
disorderly actions.

But indeed the contexture of the Spirits, or the part of the Soul irradiating
the Cerebel and its Appendix, is both affected with a certain sense, and is
urged into motions appropriate to it self, though diverse. The sense or Sympathy
belonging to this, if it be terminated within the confines of the Cerebel, is
always private, nor goes any farther forward to the Brain with a more strong
undulation or wavering; and because it is performed the living Creature knowing
nothing of it, unless by the effect it cannot be known, for that it excites a
peculiar motion. But such an affection of the Cerebel is implanted in it, that
by every new disposition of the Praecordia and Viscera communicated to this
from beneath, also from every violent passion excited within the Forum of the
Brain, and so sent from above, a certain impression is carried to the
inhabitants of the Cerebel: by which indeed they are disposed into various
ordinations for the performing these or those motions respectively.

For examples sake, so long as the tranquil region of the Cerebel, like a
serene and fair Heaven, is free from all perturbation, the Spirits its
inhabitants, being poured out with a pleasing sense, or as it were a certain
complacency, flow within their proper habitations, both with a gentle
circulation, and also with an equal flowing out enter the beginnings of the
Nerves serving to the Functions both vital and natural: by which indeed easy
Respiration, the Pulse, Chylification, and other offices of the same nature,
are performed peaceably. But if that any trouble or molestation happen
outwardly to any one, from whence an impression of it is communicated to the
Cerebel, presently a troublesome sense being stirred up there, it disturbs the
animal Spirits in the Fountain it self, and so is wont to excite irregular
motions in the Organs of the involuntary Function. For from hence the frequent
alteration of the Pulse and of Respiration, also Cramps of the Viscera, and
convulsive motions arise unknown to us, or also against our wills. But an
impression sent from elsewhere to the Cerebel, and inducing the same kind of
troublesome sense, either ascends by the passage of the Nerves from the
Praecordia and Viscera, or it is carried from above from the Brain by the
passage of the orbicular Prominences; as shall be shown more largely anon.

In the mean time, from these things already showed of the passive power or
sense of the Cerebel, it may be easily collected, by what means, with what
order and series the animal Spirits, arising from the same, are moved. But
first you must distinguish between their twofold motion. For one is customary
and ordinary, consisting in a perpetual and equal efflux of Spirits; by which
indeed, they flowing into the beginnings of the Nerves nigh their risings,
especially of the intercostal and wandering pair, the solemn acts of the Pulse,
Respiration, Chylification, and others of the involuntary Function are
performed. Then secondly, the other motion happens extraordinary and
occasional, which the same Spirits perform confusedly, as it were in disturbed
orders: as when the Pulse becomes quicker or slower than it ought, or the
Respiration unequal or interrupted; and when the other Faculties, which belong
to this Class, are perverted from their regular and constant manner. But these
kind of extraordinary motions are again twofold, to wit, for that its
instigation proceeds from a double bound; for the impulse whereby the Spirits
inhabiting the Cerebel, are compelled into an irregular action, (as we have but
now intimated) is carried either from beneath, viz. from the Praecordia and
Viscera; or it is wont to be transmitted from above, to wit, from the Brain.

As to the first, if at any time the Praecordia grow too hot, and are burnt
with a feverish heat, presently by the passage of the Intercostals and the
wandering pair of Nerves, the Spirits residing in the Cerebel, being warned of
this evil, institute more frequent and stronger acts both of the Pulse and of
Respiration. In like manner, if by chance the humors and sharp Juyces irritate
or greatly trouble or afflict the Coats of the Ventricles or Intestines through
the sense of this affection communicated to the Cerebel, the instinct of
performing the motion is reciprocated, whereby the fibers of the parts, being
contracted and wrinkled together, endeavor the shaking off of the hurtful
matter. More instances might be here brought of all the other acts of the vital
or merely natural Function: of which besides it may be observed, that when a
sense of the trouble is immediately conveyed from the Praecordia or Viscera to
the Cerebel, this affection, like the waving of waters, is either stopped or
terminated there, from whence a motion, as the business requires, unknown to
the Brain, is presently retorted, as when the actions of the Praecordia are
altered by a feverish distemper without our knowledge; or secondly, that sense
of the trouble being transmitted to the Cerebel, for that it is more vehement,
it unfolds it self more largely, and like a stronger waving of waters, passing
through the Cerebel, goes forward further even to the Brain, and warns its
inhabitants of the evil; by which they being incited to oppose the enemy, cause
a motion of another kind: So (as has been said) when the Praecordia grow
cruelly hot, the Cerebel feeling this, makes the Pulse and Respiration
stronger. But further, the Brain being warned of the same trouble, seeks and
diligently requires cold drink and other remedies to moderate the heat.
Moreover, it is after this manner also in several other actions, which though
they are regular, yet being made in the Brain without any previous knowledge,
they are said to be done by Instincts merely natural; as when brute Animals,
being newly brought forth, presently seek for the Dams teats, and greedily
suck; or Birds, without any showing or example, build nests with wonderful Art,
lay eggs, and hatch young ones. In these kind of works the Brain being taught
before by none, directs fit means to the ends instituted by Nature: which
indeed seems to be done by this means. The sense of every necessity being
brought to the Cerebel, incites the Spirits inhabiting it to succor it; which
when they are not able to do, the impression going from thence further forward,
is carried to the orbicular Prominences: by which the Spirits there inhabiting,
being presently struck, form the Appetite or the intention of performing, which
being thence communicated to the Brain, it readily causes that local motions,
fit for the executing of the work, be retorted. Of these we shall speak anon a
little more largely, when we treat of the respect which happens between the
orbicular Prominences and the annular Protuberance.

In the mean time, we shall take notice in the second place, that the irregular
motions of the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel, are wont also, by reason of the
force of the affections, to be transmitted from thence to the Brain: for as
often as a violent passion, as Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, or of any other kind,
is conceived in the Brain, presently the impression of the same being brought
through the bypath of the Prominences into the Cerebel, disturbs the Spirits
destinated to the vital or merely natural Function in their very fountain, and
for that reason presently induces notable mutations in the Organs of those
Functions.

What has been spoken hitherto of the Cerebel being employed about the offices
of the involuntary Function only, also concerning the sense and the motions
both usual and irregular of the Spirits inhabiting it, will be made more clear,
if lastly we shall show the offices of the Nerves and of the other processes,
immediately depending upon the Cerebel, to be no other than such as perform
only involuntary Acts: which shall be briefly and succinctly done, as far as is
pertinent to our purpose, because a more full consideration of them is left to
another place.

CHAP. XVII. Of the Nerves, which receiving the stores or companies of the
Spirits from the Cerebel, bestow them on the Acts of the involuntary Function.
WE have already showed, that out of the annular Protuberance (which is a
certain Process of the Cerebel) three pairs of Nerves, to wit, the fifth,
sixth, and seventh immediately arise. We have said that Protuberance to be as
it were a Repository or Storehouse, wherein the Spirits flowing out of the
Cerebel, and to be derived into the depending Nerves, as occasion serves, are
kept: and in the mean time, whilst they remain there, they who stream out from
either middle Marrow of the Cerebel divisively, meeting mutually in this
Cirque, are united together. But as the aforesaid three pairs of Nerves receive
the forces of the Spirits from the Cerebel by the mediation of that
Protuberance; so also the eighth pair having its rise near the insertion of the
other ( viz. the lowest) medullar Process sent down from the Brain, seems to
derive by its passage the influence of the Spirits no less from the Cerebel:
wherefore when these four conjugations of Nerves owe the Tribute of their
Spirits wholly to the Cerebel, if I shall show that all these Nerves serve
chiefly and almost only to the involuntary acts of the Senses and Motions,
surely this will be a signal Argument, that according to our Hypothesis, the
office of the Cerebel is to beget and to dispense the animal Spirits requisite
for the involuntary Functions.

Therefore in the first place we observe of the fifth and sixth conjugation of
Nerves, that as this arises out of the Basis of the greater Ring, and that from
its sides both in man and in four-footed beasts; the fifth pair being carried
more forward, distributes its branches into the Glandula's of the Eyes, into
the Nostrils, into the Palate, Teeth, yea and into most parts of the Face and
Mouth; but the sixth pair is wholly bestowed on some Muscles of the Eyes.
Further, out of the trunk of the fifth pair two shoots, and another out of the
Nerve of the sixth pair bending back behind, meet together; and what is
wonderful, and not before taken notice of by Anatomists, the intercostal
Nerves, destinated to the Praecordia and Viscera, do make a Trunk; so that the
Nerves of the fifth and sixth pair stretch out a double Ramification, to wit,
one more above about the parts of the Mouth and Face, and the other lower
through the Viscera of the middle and lowest Belly. But it will appear clearly
to any one considering this thing more carefully, that the chief branches of
either partition are employed about the involuntary offices of Motion and
Sense, of which sort those are chiefly, that either cause the passions, or
perform the natural Instincts.

1. Concerning the intercostal Nerve, which (as was said) being radicated in
the Nerves of the fifth and sixth pair, depends as to its origin wholly on the
Cerebel, it is not here to be doubted but that it looking toward the
Praecordia and Viscera in a man, and toward these latter only in most
four-footed beasts, is bestowed on the Functions only vital and merely natural,
and so confers little or nothing to spontaneous actions. Further, forasmuch as
this Nerve reaching forth into the Praecordia and Viscera of the whole Abdomen,
is continued by its superior ramification also into the Eyes, as also into the
parts of the Mouth and Face; certainly from hence a true and genuine reason may
be given wherefore in every passion the Eyes, Face, and Mouth do so correspond
with the affections of the Praecordia, often unknown to us or against our
minds, that oftentimes we are compelled to betray the most intimate sense of
the Heart by the countenance and aspect. Yea, hence a reason may be brought,
why in sneesing, yawning, laughing, and crying the Muscles of the Face conspire
so in motion with the Praecordia. Besides, when in man different from any other
living Creatures besides, as we shall show afterward, many shoots are sent
from the intercostal Nerve to the Nerve of the Diaphragma; this certainly is
the cause why risibility is the proper affection of man.

But the Trunk of the fifth pair being carried more forward, and distributing
its branchings through the parts of the whole Face, causes the same not only to
be pathetically moved, and figured according to the affections of the
Praecordia; but also produces some acts, both of motion and sensation, of
another kind, which for the most part are involuntary, and so seem to depend
wholly upon the Cerebel immediately. For example, this Nerve imparts shoots to
either mandible requisite for the business of chewing: but it is very well
known, that the taking in of the food at the mouth is the first and oldest
business of every Animal, which indeed is taught by natural Instinct before any
knowledge of the Brain. But as to the Senses, the branches of this pair conduce
something to the smelling, but for the most part for the knowing and choosing of
savors. Hence it comes to pass, that as odors refresh the Brain by the smelling
Nerves, so also they affect the Cerebel by the branch of this pair, and are
wont by that means to recreate the Viscera and Praecordia. But sapors or tastes
(for that they are almost the peculiar Province of this) carry whatsoever they
have of pleasantness or trouble, first to the Spirits inhabiting the Cerebel,
and then by their consent to the Praecordia and Viscera. Hence it is, that a
Pectoral not only allays hunger, but the very first tasting of Wine raises up
those that are fainting or swooning away. Moreover, forasmuch as from this
Nerve certain branches serve for the taste, and others for the smell, there is
contracted so strict an affinity between either of these Sensories, that
nothing pleases the taste unless it be approved of by the smell: and the loss
of one of these senses oftentimes causes the privation or the diminution of the
other.

2. Concerning the Nerve of the sixth conjugation we observe, that as one shoot
is bent back for a root of the intercostal Nerve, the remaining Trunk of it
being carried forward toward the ball of the Eye, is distributed to two of its
Muscles, viz. to the seventh, proper to beasts, and to the drawing Muscle.
Hence may be inferred, that this Nerve, besides the influence of it bestowed on
the vital and natural Function, serves also for the producing some pathetick
motions of the Eye, to wit, such as are wont to obey the affections of the
Praecordia and Viscera; so that the whole provision of the animal Spirit, which
it receives from the Cerebel, it bestows only on involuntary acts.

3. The seventh pair, or the hearing Nerves, seem also to depend upon the
Cerebel, forasmuch as they take their originals out of the annular
Protuberance: but the use of them is a little otherwise in man than in
four-footed beasts. For in him the annular Protuberance is one, and that very
big, from whose lower margin the auditory Nerves proceed: but in Brutes the
Protuberance is twofold, viz. one greater, sent down from the Cerebel, in which
the beginnings of the fifth and sixth pair of Nerves consist; then near this
there is another lesser, and as it were secondary, from which the auditory
Nerves proceed. This lesser and lower Ring does not so manifestly depend on the
Cerebel, as the former; but there is stretched out from either height of it a
white medullar line upon the oblong Marrow in the bottom of the fourth
Ventricle: so as this seems to receive either the Spirits from the oblong
Marrow, or at least to carry into the same the sensible Species: for what use
it is so constituted shall be inquired into afterward; for concerning these
Nerves of the seventh pair, forasmuch as some offices of them very much
illustrate the government or economy of the Cerebel, we shall discourse here a
little more largely.

Therefore in man, who has got a great and undivided annular Protuberance, the
auditory Nerves coming out of its margin or brim, show its stock received of
the Cerebel: by which means we may see the tasks of those Nerves quadrate with
the assigned government of this. We have shown before the Processes (which in a
manner may be called distinct Nerves) of the seventh pair to be twofold on
either side: one, the softer of these, serves only for the sense, but the other
harder seems to perform some motions. This latter Nerve, being carried without
the Skull, is divided into three branches, all which serve to pathetick
motions, or at least to such as are performed without consulting the Brain.

1. The first of them being bent back toward the auditory passage, is bestowed
on the Muscles of the Ear. Without doubt, by the action of this, it is
effected, that all Animals at the sudden impulse of a sound or noise, erect
their Ears at it were to catch the sound too soon passing by. 2. The other
branch of this same Nerve climbing over the Muscles of the Jaw, sends forth
shoots toward either corner of the Eye: which are inserted into the Muscles
lifting up the Eyelids; the office of which is certainly to open suddenly the
Eyes at the sudden approach of any sound, and as it were to call them forth to
watch, that by the stroke of the Air being brought to the Ear, the Eye might
presently look about to see what is the matter, and whether there might be any
danger near or not: which also all Creatures do unthought of. 3. The third
branch of the same auditory Nerve descending toward the root of the Tongue, is
distributed to its Muscles, and to those of the Bone Hyoides, and so actuates
some of the Organs for the framing the Voice. For this reason in some measure
it comes to pass, that living Creatures being astonished at an unaccustomed or
horrid sound, presently putting forth an uncertain voice, cry out and make a
noise. But the conformation of these kind of Nerves in man serves for another
more noted use, to wit, that the voice might fitly answer to the hearing, and
that this might be set as the Echo of the sound admitted by this: so indeed, as
on the other side, there be two Nerves of the same pair, the sound is received
by the hearing through one, which is rendered again by the voice through the
other. The common and extrinsick Echo consists in this, that a certain
undulation or waving of the Air shaken or moved, being stirred up, and tending
toward or about, when by reason of some stop or hinderance, it cannot go any
further directly, being presently repercussed or struck back or reflected at
certain angles, it is terminated contrary to the former bound. In like manner,
in the hearing, the impression of the sound, or the Species admitted to the
Ears by the hearing faculty of the Processes of the same or neighboring Nerve,
and being carried inwardly toward the Cerebel and common Sensory; and from
thence again reflected on the vocal process, it is carried out by the Mouth.
But between these there is some difference, to wit, forasmuch as the outward
Echo renders back the sound immediately; but the sound of the Hearing is not
necessarily carried forth at the mouth presently, but that this leaves an Idea
in the Head, according to which afterward, as occasion serves, the voice is
formed, which bears the type and image of that, though some time before
admitted.

But here (if I may digress a little) we should inquire in what part of the
Head the Ideas of sounds are left: whether only in the Brain, which is the
Chest of Memory acquired as it were artificial; or whether not also in the
Cerebel, which is the place of natural memory? Truly we suppose, that sounds
belong to both these, as it were to distinct Storehouses. Every audible
impulse being struck against the Ear, it is presently carried by the passage of
the auditory Process to the annulary Protuberance; but from thence it is
carried, as other sensible Species, to the chamfered bodies or the common
Sensory; (which way it passes thither, shall be showed afterward) this
impression tending from thence farther, and being also delivered to the Brain,
stirs up the Imagination, and so leaves in its Cortex an image or private mark
of it self for the Memory. Further also, as the auditory Process depends on the
Cerebel, and receives from it the provision of the animal Spirits: so it is
most likely, that by the recess of the same Spirits the Ideas of the Sounds are
conveyed also to the Cerebel; which forming there footsteps or tracts, impress
a remembrance of themselves, from whence when afterward the Species there laid
up are drawn forth by the help of the vocal process, voices, like the sounds
before admitted, and breaking forth in a certain ordained series, come to be
made.

Hence it is usual, that music or melody is soon learnt by some men, which
afterward they bring forth with exact Symphony, without any meditation or
labor of the Brain; to wit, from the distinct accents of the heard harmony,
the Spirits moving within the Cerebel are disposed into peculiar Schemes;
according to which, when they flow on both sides into the vocal process of the
auditory Nerve, they render as it were with a certain spontaneous voice, and
like a Machine or Clock with the succession of Species, the measures or Tunes
of the Instrument which they had drunk in at the ears. Without doubt hence the
reason may be sought, why some men learn Music without any trouble, and others
hardly or not at all. For it is observed, that some Children, before they can
speak distinctly, quickly sing, and remember certain Tunes; whilst others,
though very ingenious men and of excellent memory, are very Fools at Music,
and become incapable, as an Ass for the Harp; wherefore it is commonly said,
that some have musical ears, and others are wholly destitute of that faculty.
In the mean time, it is to be confessed, that in these the Organs of the Voice
are not defective; but all the fault, though wrongfully, is cast on the hearing.

But in truth the genuine cause of this defect seems to consist in this, that
when in all, the audible Species go to the Cerebel sooner and more immediately
than the Brain; yet in some the Cerebel being harder, and not easily yielding
to the received impressions, those Species, because they could impress nothing
of themselves in their passing to the Cerebel, being carried toward the common
Sensory, leave their Types or Ideas chiefly and almost wholly in the Brain:
which part being still busied with disturbed motions, is less apt to keep
distinctly the composures of Harmony. But in the mean time, in others the
Species of audible things, besides that they are carried to the common Sensory
and to the Brain, do also affect the Cerebel, especially if they are
harmonically figured (forasmuch as in them there is a softer capacity of the
impressions) with a peculiar order and Scheme of the animal Spirits: where, as
the Species of the Harmony being disposed in convenient little places and cells
are kept, afterward they flow out from thence, almost unthought of, without
any endeavor or labor of remembrance, but in a distinct series, and as it
were in composed modes and figures, and so by blowing up the vocal processes,
they constitute sweet Tunes and vocal Music.

If that the diverse ways of passage are inquired into, to wit, whereby the
audible Species, being carried into the annular Protuberance, do get both to
the Brain and Cerebel; I say it is not improbable, but out of that Protuberance
both a passage lies open into the underlying tract of the oblong Marrow, and as
it were the high road; as also another passage is opened into the Cerebel
through the medullar processes of the same Ring. But lest there should
perchance be a confusion of the animal Spirits and the sensible Species, (which
indeed can hardly be avoided) if the way made for their passage should lie open
into various passages and manifold apertures; therefore concerning this it may
well be supposed, that the Ideas of the Sounds pass through the Cerebel, when
they are carried to the common Sensory; which region being first past, they are
at length brought by a by-path, viz. through the orbicular Prominences to the
chamfered Bodies: which perhaps is partly the reason, that in the Hearing the
perception of the sense succeeds so late, and the impulse of the object, in
respect of sight, follows so slowly.

Whilst therefore the audible Species passes through the Cerebel, in some men,
it leaves in this region (for that it is of a soft temper, and fit for the
receiving impressions) tracts and marks of it self, and so they obtain musical
ears. But in others who have a harder frame of the Cerebel, they produce no
tracts of the same Sounds, and therefore such are wholly destitute of the
faculty of Music.

As therefore we suppose the audible Species to pass through the Cerebel after
this manner, a reason may be given from hence, wherefore Music does not only
affect the Fantasy with a certain delight, but besides chears a sad and
sorrowful Heart; yea, allays all turbulent Passions excited in the Breast from
an immoderate heat and fluctuation of the blood. For since the animal Spirits,
serving for the motion of the Praecordia, are derived from the Cerebel; as the
perturbations conceived in the Brain, the influence being transmitted hither by
moving these Spirits in the Fountain it self, transfer the force of their
Affections on the Breast; so the Melody introduced to the Ears, and diffused
through this Province, does as it were inchant with a gentle breath the Spirits
there inhabiting, and composes them, called off from their fury, to numbers and
measures of dancing, and so appeases all tumults and inordinations therein
excited.

From these may in some measure be known the reason of the difference, why the
hearing Nerves are after a different manner in man and in four-footed beasts:
for, because in these there is little need that the audible Species should pass
through the Cerebel, either for the reciprocations of the sound heard, by the
voice, or for the impressing there the Tunes of the Harmony (for neither is
Music required, whatever Poets feign, to the taming the Affections which move
the breasts of beasts) therefore in these (I mean in four-footed beasts) the
annular Protuberance dispensing the animal Spirits to the auditory Nerves, and
receiving from them the sensible Species, requires not so strict an affinity
with the Cerebel: yea, whenas it may suffice, that those Nerves arise from the
oblong Marrow, yet the annular Protuberance, as it were a common Porch, ought
to be prefixed to them; to wit, in which both the Spirits going out from either
side, and the sensible Species to be carried to either, ought first to be mixed
and united together, lest otherwise every sound should become double.

Among the Nerves which are seen to belong to the Cerebel, and to perform its
offices, lastly follow the eighth or wandering pair, which indeed has its rise
out of the common Trunk of the oblong Marrow, near the place where the last
process of the Cerebel is terminated, and over against where the pyramidal
bodies, being produced from the annular Protuberance, end: so that we think
these Nerves also, by that process coming between on either side, and also
perhaps in some measure through the passage of the pyramidal bodies, do derive
all manner of influence of the animal Spirit from the Cerebel.

The beginning of these consists of very many fibers and filaments or little
threads presently distinct one from another; to which belongs, from the very
beginning of every Nerve, a noted Trunk arising out of the spinal Marrow. The
description of the wandering pair of Nerves, and its protension into the
Praecordia and some Viscera, are added hereafter. For the present it shall
suffice, that we take notice, that for as much as this Nerve is bestowed
chiefly on the Praecordia, the acts whereof are involuntary, and are performed
without our care or knowledge in sleep as well as waking; and for that the same
Nerve seems to receive the forces of the Spirits wholly from the nearer
fountain of the Cerebel; from hence it may certainly be well concluded, that
the government or economy of the Cerebel regards only the involuntary Function.

So much for the Nerves, which being subjected to the Government and Laws of
the Cerebel, seem to obey and serve under it: among which moreover ought to be
placed the fourth pair, or the pathetick Nerves of the Eyes, to wit, which
arising out of the first processes of the Cerebel, come between that and the
orbicular Processes; of the use of which we have spoken already. Further, we
shall here take notice, that some other Nerves to be described below, for that
they communicate with the aforesaid Nerves near their originals, cause also
some involuntary acts to be performed; of which sort are first the ninth pair,
the spinal Nerve accessory to the wandering pair, also the Nerve of the
Diaphragma, and some others, as we shall show more at large in the particular
History of the Nerves.

We may also observe, concerning the Nerves but now described, which owe their
stock to the Cerebel, and seem to be designed for the offices of the
involuntary Function, that sometimes some of them, though of another Dominion,
are compelled to obey the beck and government of the Brain: for we are wont to
draw the parts of the Face, usually moved pathetically and unthought of, and
also at our pleasure, into these or those Configurations or postures: we are
able also in a measure to alter the motions and actions of the Praecordia and
Viscera at the will or command of the Appetite. The reason of these is, partly
because the Nerves of either Government communicate variously among themselves
with shoots sent forth one to another, so that oftentimes the offices of the
one are drawn into the parts of the other. But besides, we have mentioned
before, that the sensible impression being inflicted on the parts of the
involuntary Function, forasmuch as it is vehement, like a strong waving of
water, passing through the Cerebel, affects the Brain it self. In like manner
it may be thought concerning the motion which belongs to those parts, viz. that
made after the ordinary manner, that it is performed by the command of the
Cerebel. Notwithstanding some more severe Edicts of the Brain, by the
by-passage of the Prominences, belong also to the Cerebel, and determine the
Offices of the Inhabitants of it to be performed at the beck of the Appetite.
As every one sees that violent Passions (whether the will be privy or not)
easily do this; why therefore may not the will it self also, as occasion
requires, exercise the same dominion? But in the mean time, this derogates
nothing from the privileges of the Cerebel, that it may not be called a free
and municipal City, and so Mistress of the involuntary Function; for that in
some few it is after the manner of the Brain: because the Brain it self in many
things is compelled to serve the Cerebel and its Government, as we have already
shown, and is necessarily bound to it. For the Brain owes much to the Cerebel,
forasmuch as it receives from the vital Function (which is of its Province) the
provision of the blood, and by consequence the Tribute of the Spirits produced
of it: so indeed that both these parts, though Principals, perform mutual
offices, and as it were in a circle, require and accomplish services one for
another.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the relation or mutual respect of either Appendix of the
Cerebel, to wit, of the anterior, which are the orbicular Prominences; and the
posterior, viz. the Annular Protuberance: Also of the remaining portion of the
oblong Marrow continued into the Spinal Marrow.
BEsides the aforesaid Nerves, to wit, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and
eighth pair which are employed for the performing the tacit Edicts of the
Cerebel for every involuntary Function, and those equal in number to the rest
subject to the Brain, that cause the Cerebel to have an Empire divided with it;
there are also some Processes and Protuberances, which being placed before and
behind the Cerebel, are its Appendixes, that are taken into part of the same
Office and Ministry. The description and use of these, are already particularly
delivered. But for that (as a while since we intimated) there happens a certain
respect or habit between the orbicular Prominences, which is the anterior
Appendix of the Cerebel, and the annular Protuberance, which is the other
posterior Appendix of the same, and that one part is proportionate to the
magnitude of the other; so as when the natiform Prominences are greater or
greatest, the annular Protuberance is always smaller or smallest; and on the
contrary, they who have this latter in a very great bulk, in them the other is
lesser; and so for that either part seems to be a peculiar Repository of the
Spirits, which belong to the economy of the Cerebel, when a greater provision
of them is laid up in one Storehouse, therefore there resides a lesser in the
other; when I say there is this kind of constant relation found between these
parts, it yet remains for us to find out for what end this is so constituted.

Seeing that the animal Spirits are disposed within the several parts of the
Head in distinct Schemes of Rays, through which are variously transmitted, as
through Perspective-glasses, the impressions of sensible things and the
instincts of motions to be performed; it easily occurs, that there are
commerces had this way and that way in the natiform Prominences between the
Brain and Cerebel; and that the Spirits inhabiting the annular Protuberance are
Inter nuncii or Messengers going between, which transfer the mutual respects of
the Praecordia and Viscera, as also of the parts that are wont to be
pathetically moved. But if it be inquired into, what kind of commerces and
respects those are which the Brain carries to the Cerebel, and on the contrary,
and that either have to the Organs of the vital and merely natural Function, we
shall in so difficult and very intricate a matter propose our Opinion, though
with an hesitating and doubtful mind.

We have before intimated, that the orbicular Prominences did deliver to the
Cerebel the forces of the Passions to be carried from the Brain to the
Praecordia, and did receive from it, and communicate to the Brain the
necessities of the natural Instincts delivered from the Praecordia and Viscera
to the Cerebel. To these moreover we add, that the annular Protuberance serves
wholly for the same offices, though after another manner; to wit, this receives
the forces of the Passions, as it were at a second hand, from the Deputiship of
the Cerebel, and transfers them then immediately to the Praecordia; and this
seems to be the chiefest office of this part. Further, the same Ring receives
immediately the natural Instincts from the Viscera of the middle and lowest
Belly, and impresses them on the Cerebel to be conveyed further to the Brain;
which kind of use it exhibits secondarily by affording only a way of passage:
For indeed such Instincts having past through the Cerebel, we suppose to be
formed and perfected within the orbicular Prominences, from whence being
transmitted into the Brain, they draw forth requisite actions without the
previous knowledge of it, or intention of doing.

Hence it may be supposed, that the annular Protuberance contains chiefly the
animal Spirits which perform the intestine commotions of the Affections. In
every violent passion of the Soul, presently the Praecordia are greatly
troubled, to wit, the same being variously drawn together or spread abroad,
compel the blood into diverse fluctuations; but indeed a great company of the
Spirits, somewhere got together and ready for Excursions in a set Battle, do
perform these disorders and irregular motions of the Praecordia; and for that
the Spirits can be disposed for this in no other part than here, before the
beginnings of the Nerves, constituted for these offices; therefore this
Protuberance in a man, by reason of the ragings of the Passions to be performed
by a certain force and incitation, is far greater than in any other Animal. For
as he is wont to be suddenly and vehemently disturbed, therefore the Promptuary
or Storehouse is required to be more large, in which a greater plenty of
Spirits may be kept, to be bestowed on such inordinations of the Affections.
Next to a man this part is greatest in a Dog, Cat, and Fox; in a Calf, Sheep,
Goat, Hare, and other milder Animals it is very small.

But as the annular Protuberance seems to be the chief Organ or Chest of the
Spirits, from whence the winds of the Passions, destinated for the exciting the
Praecordia, are conveyed into the breast; so we suppose the orbicular
Prominences to be a means of passage, and the very instruments whereby the
instincts and necessities of the Praecordia and Viscera are communicated from
the Cerebel to the Brain. Yea, the animal Spirits dwelling in this, as a
retiring place, do not only transmit these kind of Ideas or formal Reasons of
the Instincts, but in some measure form and prepare them for the Brain. For
when as some brute Animals, whose Brain is not imbued with a previous knowledge
or practical habits, choose and bring forth some spontaneous actions as it were
with judgment and deliberation, certainly we may believe the intentions of
these kind of acts are suggested from some other place than the Brain, to wit,
from the aforesaid Prominences. Wherefore it is to be observed, that in some
Brutes endued with an indocil or dull Brain, the Buttock-like Prominences are
greatest, as may be seen in a Calf, Sheep, Hog, and many others; which Animals,
as soon as they are brought to light, presently seek for their food, and what
is congruous for them they readily know. But in a Man, a Dog, Fox, and the
like, who are more apt to learn and acquire habits, these Prominences are very
small; and these Animals being newly born, are furnished only with a rude and
imperfect sense; besides, they are found wholly unapt to seek out their food.
Upon this Observation (which holds good in most Animals which I have yet
happened to dissect) as upon a Basis or foundation I dare build this kind of
abstruse Hypothesis concerning the natural Instincts and Affections of the
Praecordia. For as the living Creatures which are more strong in instinct, as
Sheep, Hogs, Oxen, Goats, and other slow and gentler beasts, that are not
obnoxious to Passions, are also less docile or apt to learn; and on the
contrary, they in whom the Affections are wont to predominate, and who are
furnished with a certain wit, (as besides Man, are Dogs, Foxes, and some other
hotter Animals) are less powerful in Instinct: and as I have observed in the
frequent Dissection of all sorts of Heads, that in those kind of living
Creatures, who live rather by Wit than Instinct, the annular Protuberance,
placed below the Cerebel, was notedly great, and the orbicular Prominences only
very small; but in other living Creatures, where the Instinct exceeded the wit,
and who were less prone to strong Affections, the orbicular Prominences were
very great, and on the contrary, the ringy Protuberance exceeding small: From
hence I was forced to think, that the orbicular or natiform Prominences, where
they are great, are instead of another or supplementory Brain, and the chief
Organs of the natural Instincts; yet so, as these parts also serve for a way or
means of passage for the transferring the Passions from the Brain toward the
Cerebel and Praecordia; and that (as we have already hinted) the greater
existency of the annular Protuberance is to contain plenty of Spirits requisite
for the winds of the Passions; yet in the mean time, by a further tending
forwards or declination of the Spirits inhabiting this, the Species of the
natural Instincts, being sent from the Praecordia and Viscera, pass through.
But however the business is, because nothing can be certainly affirmed, or by
demonstration, if this our Opinion please not others, at least it may be
pardoned.

There remains not much more to be spoken concerning the Offices and Uses of
the Cerebel and its Appendix. Concerning its substance, there is something more
worthy taking notice of, to wit, that it very much differs in this respect from
the structure of the Brain also, for that its cortical little circles are not
founded in the stretched out Marrow, as the convolutions of the Brain; but
being deeply cut in, are discontinued in their whole tract: so that the whole
System of the Cerebel is as it were a cluster of Grapes compacted closely
together; in which, although the Berries be contiguous, yet they remain
distinct one from another, and bring forth fissures through the whole thickness
of the mass. Yea the outward superficies of the Cerebel consists as it were of
very many Tubercles or little Tad-stoles or Puffs which grow together on little
stalks; and those stalks pass into greater branches, and they at length being
bipartite or twofold, go together into two larger Marrows near the bottom of
the Cerebel, in either of which are three distinct medullary Processes: of
which threefold processes on either side we have already spoken. But of these
concerning the use of the Cerebel in general, we shall yet further advertise
you, that as very much of its substance is cortical, it begets animal Spirits
in great plenty, to which in the circulating there is not granted, as in the
Brain, an equally great space; for that there seems not to be much need of it
in the animal Government. For the Spirits so produced in the Cerebel
plentifully by a perpetual emanation, ought to flow outwardly for the offices
of the natural and vital Function: but more inwardly for the impulses variously
sent into them, they admit certain undulations or wavings, by which some
occasional acts of the involuntary Function are brought forth, as is shown
before.

But as it is manifest enough, that the animal Spirits are generated within the
cortical little circles of the Cerebel, it does not seem needful that we should
ordain their Workhouse in the Ventricle subject to its frame. For that Cavity
(as we have already shown) is only an empty space, which lying under its double
little foot and medullar Trunk, comes between it and the overlying bunching out
of the Cerebel. But indeed there belongs to this besides a certain use, to wit,
that the serous watery heap laid aside out of the Glandula's and infoldings of
the Vessels, as also from the substance of the Cerebel, being made over-moist,
distilling down, might slide into this Cistern. From whence, lest it should
flow down upon the beginnings of the Nerves, by a restraining Membrane it is
compelled into the hole of the strait Den lying under the orbicular
Prominences; and from thence is received from the declining aperture of the
Tunnel, and carried out.

Below the Cerebel, the oblong Marrow going forward with the rest of its tract
even to the hole of the hinder part of the Head, ends at length in the spinal
Marrow: but in its Trunk, as yet contained within the Skull, besides the Nerves
and Processes but now recited, the beginnings of the ninth and tenth pair of
Nerves are also radicated. Of which there will be hereafter a proper place to
speak, when we shall institute the whole Neurology or the Doctrine of the
Nerves. In the mean time, we shall take notice of the beginning of the ninth
pair, which is peculiar in Man, and different from what is found in Brutes: To
wit, in Man below the origin of the eighth pair, a certain Protuberance grows
to either side of the oblong Marrow. Out of that four or five distinct Fibers
do come forth; one or two of which binds about the Vertebral Artery passing
through it, but all grow together into the same Trunk, which is the Nerve of
the aforesaid pair. This Protuberance, the Pia Matter being pulled away, may be
easily seen, and seems to be the Repository or Storehouse of the Spirits
destinated to this Nerve.

For as this Nerve is bestowed on the Tongue and its Muscles, and so conduces
chiefly to the performing of speech in Man, who has a greater and more
frequent use and exercise of the voice, there seems to be need of a great
provision of Spirits, plenty of which ought always to be in a readiness. But in
Brutes, who have none, or a rarer necessity of the voice, such a Protuberance
is wanting, because it is not required in them that the Spirits should be
gathered together by heaps, as it were in a certain Porch, before the Organs of
the Voice, but that it may suffice for them to be called forth by degrees out
of the common tract of the oblong Marrow. Further, whereas some fibers of this
Nerve bind about either Vertebral Artery, unless I am deceived, that is so
ordained for this end, lest perhaps in speaking, when at any time we are more
vehemently moved, the blood being stirred up, might rush upon the Brain with a
torrent. For this Nerve binding about the Vertebral Artery, as it were with a
bridle, and so as a Moderator not only of the Tongue, but also of the Blood,
restrains its more rapid influence. After the same manner, and for no other
ends, do the recurrent Nerves, destinated to some part of the same office,
variously bind about the Trunk of the great Artery, as shall be shown
afterward.

As soon as this inferior portion of the oblong Marrow is uncloathed from the
Pia Matter, the pyramidal bodies come in view otherwise lying hid. These in all
Animals, endued with the annular Protuberance, are constantly found; also as
that Protuberance is bigger, so these bodies appear more noted: but indeed in a
Man and a Dog they seem like two large Nerves, which being produced out of that
Ring, end over against where the eighth pair arise in sharp points. If the use
of these be sought into, it is most likely, that the animal Spirits
superabounding in the annular provision or store, do flow out as it were by
these Emissaries, which Spirits however run into the beginnings of the eighth
pair placed near, and so are bestowed by their proper means on the offices of
the involuntary Function.

Although the oblong Marrow retains not its name beyond the limits of the
Skull; yet it is the same substance, which from thence being continued further
into the cavity and utmost recesses of the whole Spine or Backbone, is called
the Spinal Marrow: but it is brought forth for this, that the Nerves to be
distributed into the Limbs and Members more remote from the Head, might more
commodiously arise out of the same medullar substance stretched out into the
neighborhood of every part. Indeed all this whole medullar Trunk, which is
continued from the bottom of the Brain even to the Os sacrum, seems like the
Pneumatick Chest, or Bellows of a pair of Organs, which includes the blast or
breath destinated to every Pipe; for in like manner the animal Spirits are
contained in this marrowy tract, which blow up and actuate all the Nerves
hanging thereto, as occasion serves.

If you behold the origin of the whole, it seems that the whole frame both of
this oblong Marrow and the spinal, is of a medullar or marrowy substance, every
where growing dispersedly through the Brain and Cerebel, and then being
gathered more round together in the middle of either, becomes as one heap. For
the Marrows besmearing all their folds and turnings about, are as so many
little rivers, which springing from thence, begin to be congregated in the
middle, and to be poured out in one great one; but being from thence united,
they make the oblong Marrow, as it were the chanel of the Sea, big enough for
the motion or ebbing and flowing and reciprocation of the animal Spirits: which
belly or chanel, however stretching it self further beyond the Skull, is
increased into the spinal Marrow, as it were the bosom or process of the former.

But as the medullar tracts, besmearing the folds and convolutions of the Brain
and Cerebel, unfold themselves into their middle Marrows and medullar Trunk,
and so the Spirits springing dispersedly from their first fountains, congregate
as it were into a certain diffused Sea; so from this Sea, causing an ebbing and
flowing, or a continual or very frequent influence of the animal Spirit, the
same Spirits flow out into the depending channels of the nervous System.

Concerning this part of this Marrow, which being included in the long bosom or
chanel of the Vertebrae or Backbone, and according to all their joyntings,
being marked with as it were knotty processes, is called the Spinal, there
occur not many things worthy consideration, besides what are commonly known.
The figure, situation, as also the body of this, in its whole tract, are known
generally to be cloven in two, not only by Anatomists, but by every Butcher.
The ramifications or branchings of the Nerves, proceeding from the spinal
Marrow, are delivered hereafter. Concerning its conformation something peculiar
occurs. For as the spinal Marrow is as it were the common passage or chanel of
the Spirits flowing out of the Head into the Nerves, it may be observed, that
this chanel, not after the usual manner of other passages, where many rivers
flow in, does swell up more; but on the contrary, in what place it has more
and greater Emissaries, its magnitude is increased; for in those parts of the
spinal Marrow, out of which the brachial and crural Nerves arise, (or those
Nerves belonging to the Arms and Legs, whose beginnings are more and larger)
its Trunk becomes much thicker than in the rest of the frame or substance. The
reason of this is, because within the medullar tracts the animal Spirits run
not, nor pass through with so swift a passage, but for the most part flowing
leisurely from their Fountains, when they have filled the whole space, they
stay therein; and as many Spirits, upon occasion offered, are wont to be
bestowed on every work, those remaining there in readiness frame certain
convenient Promptuaries where they may divert themselves. Wherefore we
ordinarily observe, not only of this Marrow, but of the Nerves themselves, that
as often as a small branch is distributed into many shoots or suckers to be
sent forth here and there, always in the very knot of the division there grows
a far greater fold than in the rest of the Trunk of the Nerve; so that it is a
wonder from whence the Nerve should acquire so in the middle of its passage a
new substance and more ample bulk. But of these things and others belonging to
the Doctrine of the Nerves, it behooves us to discourse in the following
Chapters.

CHAP. XIX. Of the Nervous System in general, where its parts (which are the
Nerves and Fibers) being designed, a prospect of the whole Animal Government is
exhibited.
WHenas hitherto having beheld the several Regions of the Brain it self, the
Cerebel, and medullar Appendix, and the provision and offices of them all, we
have designed or drawn forth the uses and employments also of the parts and
processes, and the sanguiferous Vessels belonging to every one of these; it is
now time for me to stop and retire into the Port from this troublesome and
intricate Sea of Disquisition: But indeed, because I find that I have not yet
reached to the farthest shores and utmost parts; but that beyond this Sea,
which we have sailed through, as yet the nervous System, and very many Creeks
or Bosoms, Meanders, and highly intricate Recesses or private places in it
remain to be viewed; therefore although we know it is difficult to proceed with
full Sail, we have resolved to undertake the task of the Doctrine of the
Nerves; and the rather, because without the perfect knowledge of the Nerves the
Doctrine of the Brain and its Appendix would be left wholly lame and imperfect;
for neither what has already been delivered concerning them can be
sufficiently understood or illustrated, nor (which I chiefly desire, and is the
end of the former Disquisitions) without those things before known can the
Pathology of the Brain and nervous stock be rightly instituted. And indeed
there are many things which might easily deter any one from such an
undertaking: to wit, the hardness of the work, and full of hazard; which
promises at first sight more difficulty and thorny labor, than pleasure or
profit. Then some will object, that this Province is already so perfectly
cultivated, and adorned by former Anatomists, that by a repetition of the same,
I may seem to have meddled with a thing done to my hand. But I may readily
answer to these, first, That the Anatomy of the Nerves yields more pleasant and
profitable Speculations, than the Theory of any parts besides in the animated
Body: for from hence the true and genuine Reasons are drawn of very many
Actions and Passions that are wont to happen in our Body, which otherwise seem
most difficult and unexplicable; and no less from this Fountain the hidden
Causes of Diseases and their Symptoms, which commonly are ascribed to the
Incantations of Witches, may be found out and clearly laid open. But as to our
Observations about the Nerves, from our following Discourse it will plainly
appear, that I have not trod the paths or footsteps of others, nor repeated
what has been before told.

Therefore that according to our determination we may enter upon the
explanation of the nervous System, we shall comprehend under this name all
parts, upon which gifted with the animal Spirit, Motion and Sense necessarily
and immediately depend, to wit, for the performing either one only, or both
together in the whole Body. But these kind of parts, in respect of the Head and
marrowy Appendix, are like a branching stock or imps growing out of the trunk
of a Tree: for supposing that the cortical substances of the Brain and Cerebel
are in the place of roots, and that the substances every where medullar are
taken for the stock or pith; the nervous germination or budding forth expanded
into divarications of Nerves and Fibers, will appear like so many little
branches, twigs, and leaves. Or if the Head containing in it self the chief
part and power of the sensitive Soul, be taken for the body of some Luminary,
as of the Sun or a Star; the nervous System shall be that radiant or beamy
concretion compassing it about. Because the animal Spirits flowing from the
Brain and Cerebel, with the medullar Appendix of either, as it were from a
double Luminary, irradiate the nervous System, and so constitute its several
parts, the Organs of Motion or Sense, or of both together, as has been said.

The parts of the nervous System, as a radiant or beamy texture, are either
primary, viz. the bodies themselves of the Nerves, into which the animal
Spirits immediately flow from the Head and its medullar Appendix; or
secondarily, which are Fibers planted or interwoven in the Membranes, musculous
Flesh, Tendons, and some of the Parenchyma, which also contain in themselves
animal Spirits, but they receive them not but mediately and secondarily derived
from the Head through the bodies of the Nerves.

We have already showed that the animal Spirits are procreated only in the
Brain and Cerebel, from which they continually springing forth, inspire and
fill full the medullar Trunk: (like the Chest of a musical Organ, which
receives the wind to be blown into all the Pipes) but those Spirits being
carried from thence into the Nerves, as into so many Pipes hanging to the same,
blow them up and actuate them with a full influence; then what flow over or
abound from the Nerves, enter the Fibers dispersed every where in the
Membranes, Muscles, and other parts, and so impart to those bodies, in which
the nervous Fibers are interwoven, a motive and sensitive or feeling force. And
these Spirits of every part are called Implanted, forasmuch as they flow not
within the Nerves, as the former, with a perpetual flood; but being something
more stable and constant, stay longer in the subject bodies; and only as
occasion serves, viz. according to the impressions inwardly received from the
Nerves, or impressed outwardly by the objects, are ordained into diverse
stretchings or carryings out for the effecting of motion or sense either of
this or that manner or kind.

Indeed the animal Spirits flowing within the Nerves with a living Spring, like
Rivers from a perpetual Fountain, do not stagnate or stand still; but sliding
forth with a continual course, are ever supplied and kept full with a new
influence from the Fountain. In the mean time, the Spirits in the rest of the
nervous kind, especially those abounding in the Membranes and musculous stock,
are like Ponds and Lakes of Waters lately diffused from the channels of Rivers,
whose waters standing still are not much moved of their own accord; but being
agitated by things cast into them, or by the blasts of winds, conceive diverse
sorts of fluctuations.

But because there is no light difference between the motions and consistency
of the Spirits and of Waters, perhaps it will better illustrate the matter, if
the Spirits of either kind, to wit, the inflowing and implanted, are compared
to the beaming forth of diverse rays of light. And so when light is let into a
dark chamber, and presently inlightens the whole, we may conceive the particles
of the light so swiftly diffused to be of a twofold kind; to wit, some are
bodies sent from the light it self, which diffuse themselves every way into an
Orb; and other luminous particles are as it were Etherial little bodies
existing before in the pores of the Air, which being agitated by the former,
and as it were inkindled, cause as it were a flamy, though most thin
contexture, stretched out in the whole clearness. After the like manner, the
animal Spirits flowing from the medullar substance into the Nerves, are as it
were rays diffused from the light it self, and the other Spirits every where
abounding in the Fibers, are as so many lucid particles included and implanted
in the Air, which are actuated by the former, and being stirred up by them into
motion, perform the acts both of the sensitive and locomotive Faculty.

That it may the better appear by what means the animal Spirits do irradiate
and swiftly pass through the parts of the nervous System, both primary and
secondary; so that light is scarcely carried swifter through a diaphanous
Medium, than the communication of the Spirits is made from one end of the
nervous System to the other; it will be requisite to inquire here a little
concerning the Origin of the Nerves and nervous Fibers, also of their Fabric
and Conformation, to wit, what pores and passages either of these bodies have,
and how disposed for the passing through and commerce of the animal Spirits.

As to the Nerves, it is manifest from what has been said, that all of them
are produced immediately out of the medullar Trunk or its processes; so that as
these parts are the common and broad roads which lead both from the Brain and
from the Cerebel, all the Nerves are particular paths reaching out from them on
every side into the several Regions of the animated Body. Wherefore the same
Marrow, which is the original of every Nerve or Sinew, forasmuch as it is drawn
into a more thin thread, constitutes the matter of the same Nerve; which
indeed, that it may be made more solid and compact, is clothed with a peculiar
production of the Pia Matter: for as from a Silver mass gilt or enriched with
Gold, all the threads produced from it are gilded; so the same Membrane, which
covers the medullar Trunk, is produced together with all the Nerves coming out
from the same, and clothes them all. Further, very many Nerves arising
together out of that marrowy beginning, go forth as it were by bands; which
notwithstanding, for the sake of the better passage, being presently united and
carried out of their bony Cloister, are included in a common Coat taken from
the Dura Matter. For we suppose (which also shall be more clearly showed anon)
that all the Nerves, destinated to any parts or every particular member, do
arise distinctly and apart, and so remain in their whole passage. But in that
oftentimes a Nerve appearing as it were one Trunk, afterward seems to go into
many branches, it is because those branches being indeed singular, and divided
in the whole passage, are collected as it were into one bundle; for sometimes
we have separated those Nerves, seeming to grow together as it were into one
rope or cord of a Nerve, one from another, dividing them to their very
original; for neither otherwise could the Instincts of the Motions to be
performed be carried so respectively to these or those parts, separate one from
another, to which the branches of the same Trunk belong.

The passages of the Nerves are not bored through as the Veins and Arteries;
for the substance of those are not only impervious to any Bodkin, but no cavity
can be seen in them, no not by the help of Spectacles or a Microscope. As to
what belongs to the smelling little Pipes, they seem to be so made, not for the
passage of the animal Spirits, but that some serosities might slide down that
way: but the Spirits themselves are carried in the sides, and not in the cavity
of either Pipe; but the substance of the other Nerves appears plainly firm and
compacted, that the subtle humor, which is the Vehicle of the Spirits, may pass
through their frames or substances, even as the spirits of Wine, the extended
strings of a Lute, only by creeping leisurely through. Hence it may be argued,
that because the animal Spirits require no manifest cavity within the Nerves
for their expansion; neither is there need of the like for them within the
substance of the Brain; but that the Ventricles, commonly so called, ought to
be deputed to some other office than this.

But the Nerves are white, smooth, and round bodies: within the Skull and nigh
their beginnings, being as it were only covered with the Pia Matter, they are
soft and easily broken; without this, for that many of them are for the most
part gathered together, and also clothed with the Dura Matter, they become
somewhat hard and more tenacious. The Nerves themselves (as may be discovered
by the help of a Microcosm or Perspective-glass) are furnished throughout with
pores and passages, as it were so many little holes in a Honeycomb, thickly
set, made hollow, and contiguous one by another; so the Tube-like substance of
them, like an Indian Cane, is every where porous and pervious. Within these
little spaces the animal Spirits or very subtle little Bodies, and of their own
nature ever in a readiness for motion, do gently flow; to which is joined, both
for a Vehicle, as also for a Bridle or stay, a watery Latex, and that it self of
very subtle parts, This Humor diffuses with its fluidity the Spirits through
the whole nervous System; also by its viscosity retains them, that they be not
wholly dissipated, but as it were in a certain Systasis and continued Series;
for it seems, that without such an Humor the Spirits could not consist within
the nervous stock, but they would vanish away into Air. Further, the same Humor
is no less required for the passing through of the sensible Species: because
the animal Spirits, we suppose, like the rays of Light, to be diffused through
the whole nervous System; and those rays, unless the humid particles of the Air
be mingled with them, do not easily transmit the forms or images of things; as
is obvious in an Optic Scene, which is hid or shadowed by the clear beams or
brightness of the Sun. And in like manner, from the defect or depravation of
the nervous Juice, we can readily show, that the inordinations of the animal
Spirits, and oftentimes most horrid distempers of the Brain and the nervous
stock do arise.

This nervous Juice being derived from the Brain and Cerebel into the medullar
Appendix, is carried from thence by a gentle sliding down through the Nerves
even into the whole nervous stock, and waters its whole System. Upon the equal
emanation of this depends the expansion of the animal Spirits through the
whole; and the substance of these, yea the Hypostasis of the sensitive Soul it
self is founded on the diffusion of the same humor. The animal Spirits being
left to themselves, follow the motion of this Juice, and flowing together with
it in the same course, are pleasingly or quietly expatiated; but in the mean
time, as occasion is offered, the same Spirits, as a breath moving upon those
waters, conceive other spreadings abroad, and those more rapid. For as in a
River, from winds or any thing cast in, diverse undulations or wavings are
stirred up; so the animal Spirits being raised up by objects for the performing
the offices of sense and motion, do tend this way or that way to and fro within
the nervous stock, and are agitated hither and thither by other means.

But to return to the parts of the nervous System, besides the Nerves
themselves, Fibers also being dispersedly interwoven in the Membranes, the
musculous Flesh, the Parenchyma, and other parts, and united in the Tendons,
are the Organs of sense and motion. Yea, the acts of their faculties are
principally and more immediately executed by the Fibers than the Nerves; for
they, by drawing together the Muscle and other motive parts, cause the motion
it self; but the Nerves only carry from the Head the instinct for the
performing of that motion. In like manner, in Sensation the Fibers receive
first of all and immediately the impressions of sensible things, and express
the same (as musical strings do the strikings of a quill or fingers) by an
intrinsecal modification of the Particles, and represent the various approaches
of the object by the like motion of the Fibrils, as by a moveable and fluid
Character, whose Idea the Nerves transfer only to the Head.

Concerning the nervous Fibers it behooves us to inquire from whence they have
their rise? For it appears plainly, that they arise not immediately from the
Head or its medullar Appendix; nor is it less improbable, that they are
produced (as it is commonly said) from the Nerves: because what is asserted,
that the Fibers are productions of the Nerves, and little bits or pieces of
them torn off, as it were into hairy branches, seems unlikely; for that the
Fibers in some parts, being placed nigh, exceed in their bulk the magnitude of
the Nerve that is brought to that part, at least an hundredfold: which thing
appears clearly from the Tendon of every Muscle, which being made up of united
Fibers, is observed to be far greater than the Nerve inserted to it. And indeed
for almost the like reason we are induced to think the nervous Humor it self
also, whereby the Membranes and musculous Fibers are wont to be watered, to be
derived unto them not by the only means and passage of the Nerves; because it
is heaped up much more plentifully and in more abundance than can be carried
thither through those narrow passages, as appears clearly in Ulcers of the
Kings Evil, or in Impostumes or Wounds of the Tendons and nervous parts, in
which a glutinous Humor drops forth in so great abundance, that all the Nerves
of the whole Body could scarce be able to supply it.

Wherefore concerning these, it seems that we may affirm, that the Fibers are
not continued portions of the Nerves broken off into little hairy strings or
Capillaments; and that all the Fibers originally proceed not from the Nerves,
because some of them, viz. those interwoven to the Heart and its Vessels are of
equal birth with the Nerves themselves, and coexist with them together from the
beginning. However most Fibers, as to their production, depend upon the Nerves;
and all, which way soever brought forth, receive constantly from the Nerves the
forces and supplements of the animal Spirits, and also the Instincts of the
Motions to be performed by them.

Therefore to recount the births or kinds of Fibers; they are first either
spermatick and first begotten, the rudiments or first beginnings of which being
of the like antiquity as the Heart and Brain, placed in the Conception,
afterward leisurely increase; to wit, such are, as has been said, those in
the Heart it self in its depending Vessels, the Membranes and some other parts,
which form the first stuff or threads of the Embryo: or secondly, other Fibers
are produced secondarily, and by a second birth; of which sort chiefly are such
which are interwoven into the parts taken for the completing of the animal
Fabric, and especially those termed Sanguineous, which we think to be begotten
after this manner.

The Heart and Brain, with the Arteries and Nerves hanging to them, are
primigenious parts, and highly original; but these, for the second birth of
others, and for the nutrition and increase of all the sensitive parts,
distribute a twofold humor; viz. one spirituous and endued with very active
Particles which perpetually flow, though but in a very small quantity, through
the passages of the Nerves from the Brain and Cerebel; and the other slow and
softer, which being every where laid aside through the Arteries from the bloody
mass, is rendered more plentifully. This latter being of it self dull and
thicker by much, is actuated by the former, and being imbued by it, as by a
certain Ferment, acquires strength and power of growth or vegetation. But
indeed the nervous Juice, forasmuch as it diffuses with it self the animal
Spirits, imparts to every part, besides the faculties of Motion and Sense, the
determinations also of form and figure. Further, whilst that, being joined to
the other arterious humor, is disposed into the substance and matter of the
member or part to be nourished, it forms some tracts as it were, to wit, the
Fibers themselves, in which the animal Spirits, coming together with them,
reside and are expatiated. These twofold or twin humors, coupling together in
every sensitive part, constitute a liquor truly nutritious, to wit, which is
both spirituous and nourishable. And in truth, both these Juyces, viz. the
nervous and arterious, being married together, are as it were the male and
female seed, which being mingled in a fruitful womb, produces the plastic
Humor, by whose virtue the living creature is formed and increases. Hence may
be observed, as the particles of the spirituous liquor, or of the other more
watery juice ( viz. this latter being supplied from the Arteries, or that from
the Nerves) are strong or excel, as to their properties or powers, all living
creatures become more or less nimble, active, and ready to any motion and
labor. Besides, from the default or depravation of the one and the other humor
excelling, the sorts or kinds of this or that disease are excited; concerning
which, and also what belongs to the explication of the nutritious Humor, we may
perhaps have some other time occasion to discourse.

The animal Spirits which enter and fill the ordained series of the Fibers as
so many little places, flow thither by the passages of the Nerves;
notwithstanding the Spirits which are seated in the Fibers, interwoven with the
musculous stock, receive nourishment, yea and as it were auxiliary forces, from
the arterious blood there plentifully flowing: whereby indeed both the Spirits
themselves acquire for the performing of Motions a greater force and as it were
elastick; so that their force being stirred up by a strong endeavor, it seems
like the explosion of Gunpowder; and also the same Spirits being continually
consumed within the Muscles more profusely than is wont to be in the Membranes
and other parts, are in some measure made up or repaired from the bloody
sustenance: because whenas the arterious Juice joins more plentifully with the
nervous flowing within the sanguineous parts, it may be well thought, that it
also lays upon the Spirits brought thither with it, as it were some
nitrosulphureous particles, and intimately fixes them on them; and so, by
reason of this Copula, highly flatuous and apt to be rarefied, the Spirits
themselves become there more active, so that in every motive endeavor, whereby
the Muscle is suddenly intumified, they, as if inkindled, are exploded.
Moreover, a sudden refection of the consumed or wasted Spirits, after great
exercise or labor, is for this reason also performed by the blood; for that
the spirituous particles being left and forsaken by motion, presently a new
Copula of the same kind of matter, apt for explosion, is joined to them. For it
is not possible, that the immense loss of Spirits which happens in hard labors
(if they were wholly destroyed) in so short a time, should be able to be
restored by supplements coming only through the Nerves. We shall discourse more
largely of these things, if at any time hereafter we shall treat of the Motions
of the Muscles.

The animal Spirits being disposed within the several Muscles, according to the
series of Fibers, seem as it were so many distinct Troops or Companies of
Soldiers; all which being set as it were in a Watchtower, are ordained, as a
new impression is carried to them by the Nerves, either from the objects
outwardly, or more inwardly from the Head, forthwith into various forms and
peculiar orders for the performing of motion or sense of this or that kind. The
carriage or behavior of these is worth the seeing in an animal newly killed
and its skin taken off. For when life perishes, and all the force of the
Spirits flowing in through the Nerves has quite ceased; yet the Spirits
implanted into the whole Body breaking forth from the Muscles, still move and
shake them, and force them into several Convulsions and trembling motions.

From what has been said we may gather, what the disposition or order of the
animal Spirits may be in the whole animal Body: to wit, those procreated in the
cortical substance both of the Brain and Cerebel, are congregated into the
middles of either, as it were into distinct Empories or Marts; and an expansion
being made in either, they cause certain interior powers of the sensitive Soul
to be exercised; yet the same Spirits, affecting more room, enter the oblong
Marrow (as it were the Chest, as has been said, of a musical Organ) and fill
it full; within which flowing, they carry to and fro the impressions of
sensible Things and the Instincts of Motions. From the oblong and spinal Marrow
the same Spirits, unless when they are otherwise busied, tending outwardly,
flow toward the several parts of the whole Body; which notwithstanding
wandering so out of doors, because they pass through very strait ways in their
passage, to wit, the slender bodies of the Nerves, they break not forth in
heaps, or in a thick troop, but only contracted orderly, and as it were by
bands or divisions: but they being carried beyond the extremities of the
Nerves, and there possessing the Membranes, Muscles, and other sensible parts,
dilate themselves as it were into a most ample field, and with a very diffuse
Army they dwell in the Pores and passages of the Fibers planted every where
about; where also being endowed from the blood with new food, they become more
lively and more expeditious or ready for the designed offices.

Here perhaps it may be demanded, how the animal Spirits, diffused in such
numerous troops through the habit of the Body, are able to be supplied by so
strait channels of the Nerves? To which we reply, That those which reside more
outwardly do not quickly evaporate, nor are remanded back by Circulation:
wherefore when all the Fibers are filled by an influx of the Spirits made by
little and little from the beginning, very small supplements suffice to repair
their expense: For neither are those dwelling more outwardly, for that they are
repaired by the bloody food, much consumed, though in frequent action.

Hence may be noted the difference between the distributions of the blood and
animal Spirits. That Latex, because it is reduced in a circle, its Vessels are
in the whole passage proportionated as to the bulk of the Trunk and the
branchings sent from it, to wit, so that the branches of the great Artery,
being carried from the Heart, contain at the least so much of the blood, as the
shoots reaching forth from them, into all the parts. But because the animal
Spirits, being once begotten and carried more outwardly, subsist longer there,
and evaporate very slowly and by little and little; therefore the Vessels
carrying them, viz. the Nerves, in respect of the Fibers receiving them, are
made much lesser in proportion; lest perhaps by too great a supplement of the
animal Spirits, and the too thick gathering of the fresh ones still into the
nervous parts, the Army of the Veterans, before instructed, should be
confounded, and so the orders of all being disturbed, the exercises of the
animal Function should be performed any how. For indeed when at any time the
Spirits are made too sharp, so that being therefore struck as it were with
madness, they rush upon the nervous System with tumult and impetuosity; from
thence a great unquietness and continual throwing about of the Members are wont
to be excited, to which sometimes madness and fury succeed.

In the order and ordination of the animal Spirits, such as was but now
described, the Hypostasis or the Essence of the sensitive Soul consists, to
wit, which is only a certain Systasis or shadowy subsistence of those Spirits,
which like Atoms or subtle Particles, being chained and adhering mutually one
to another, are figured together in a certain Species. Moreover, the faculties
of the same Soul depend upon the various Metathesis and gesticulation of those
Spirits within the aforesaid Organs of the Head and nervous System. But the
consideration of this Soul and its powers requires a peculiar Tract, which
hereafter (God willing) we intend; in the mean time, our Method demands of us,
that (according to our weak skill) by the cense or numbering of the Nerves,
being particularly made, we should deliver an exact Neurology or Doctrine of
the Nerves.

But for that in the premised general consideration of the Nerves and Fibers,
there was mention made of the nervous and nutritious Juice; notwithstanding
what belongs to their powers and natures, has been neither fully nor clearly
enough delivered; therefore we will a little divert here, and make it our
business to inquire what sort of Juyces and Humors are carried into the parts
of the animated body for their nourishment, and by what ways or passages: then
this difficulty being removed, a plain and easy way leads into the Doctrine of
the Nerves.

CHAP. XX. Of the Nervous Liquor, and whether that or the bloody Humor be
Nutritious.
SInce the Circulation of the Blood was made known, and it has been plainly
made appear, that it did no where stagnate and stand still long, but was
carried in a reciprocal motion, always as in a circle; it began to grow
doubtful, whether its Latex is nutritious or not. For besides, that the more
rapid course of the blood, as of a torrent, might seem to wear the banks which
it flowed between, and to carry away some Particles from them, rather than to
be able to affix any thing to them; the substance it self also of the blood,
for that it is more torrid and uneven, is thought to be altogether unfit for
nutrition. Wherefore that a Juice may be found more convenient or fit for this
office, the passages and hidden recesses of the Nerves are to be viewed; and as
a certain Latex is found to flow within their Pores and passages, presently the
blood being rejected, that nervous humor is gifted with the title of
nutritious: but yet by what right, and after what manner nutrition is
performed, shall be our present purpose to inquire.

And here first of all, that we may take the part of the blood, it will be
easy to show, that there is matter contained in it fit enough for the
nourishment of the body, and a sufficient store of it. For besides the
sulphurous substance of the blood, which within the fireplace of the Heart,
with a continual inkindling, and by that means deflagration in the Vessels
produces life, and in the more perfect Animals heat, there is found also a
certain other humor soft and alible, which in the Circulation, being
distributed through several parts of the Body, by increasing them adds
nourishment and bulk: yea the deflagration it self of the blood, plainly as a
Kitchin-fire in dressing meat, as it were boils and prepares this humor,
whereby it more easily is assimilated into the substance of every part to be
nourished. Hence it comes to pass, that by reason of a defect of heat in the
blood, no less than of excess, nutrition is often hindered. But that this kind
of alible Juice is contained in the bloody mass, the Anatomy or spontaneous
Analysis of its Latex sufficiently declares; for the extravasated blood, when
it goes into parts of its own accord, this liquor being disjoined from the
purple thick part, and swimming a top of it, appears clear or limpid; but by
reason of its more thick contents, to wit, the nutritious Particles, like the
white of an Egg, it is easily made thick, and grows white by a gentle heat:
which thing appears by this familiar Experiment, to wit, if you shall evaporate
a little of it only in a Skillet over the fire, the whole liquor will presently
grow together into a white Gelly. By this liquor, as the blood is more or less
imbued with it, living Creatures grow and become more fleshy or lean: for both
the blood of younger Animals being loosned from cold, is wont to show much more
of this kind of white than more ancient or older Creatures; and we may take
notice daily at our Tables, that very much of this kind of Gelly comes out of
the flesh of a Lamb or Calf being boiled or roasted, and nothing almost from
Mutton or Beef, especially if old. Therefore we may lawfully suppose, that the
blood is truly nourishable; and that the whole, or at least the greatest part
of the matter, for the adding bulk or substance to every part, is dispensed
from it: but if at any time it be defective in this its office, that happens
not out of the natural unfitness of it, but because its disposition is
sometimes depraved, and as the Stomach laboring with some vice, rejects or
perverts the Chyle to be cooked by it.

But the blood, as it is not the only and alone humor, which is distributed in
the animated Body, so neither seems it able to perform alone and of it self the
whole office of nutrition. For besides that, being diffused through the
Arteries and Veins, another Latex is every where dispensed from the Head
through the Nerves; which shall be shown to afford something at least to
nourishment.

As to the first, there are many reasons which declare that kind of humor to be
in the Brain and nervous stock, and to abound in their whole passages. For
unless the animal Spirits, continually flowing out, should be founded in such a
Latex, which is their Vehicle, they would not be contiguous or joined, nor able
to continue and knit together the Systasis of the sensitive Soul. For if
Hippocrates did observe long since, that Cramps and Convulsive motions were
produced from dryness and emptiness, that perhaps might happen by this means:
to wit, because the humor in the Nerves or Fibers being deficient, the Spirits
distracted one from another, were separated; which notwithstanding, that they
might still retain their mutual embraces, and as it were folding of hands, bend
the containing bodies, and very much contract, and so force them into
Convulsions. Besides, Wounds and Impostumes of the Tendons and nervous parts
seem to witness the diffusion of the nervous Juice, either of which drop forth
a thin Ichor, and wholly unlike to the mere bloody Excretion: no less may be
argued from the Ganglia and Evil running Sores. In time of sleeping the
aforesaid humor is wont to flow more plentifully into the Brain and Nerves, and
to obstruct their passages; and therefore yawnings and stretchings come
frequently upon those awaking, that its relics might be shook off. Lastly, we
might readily show, that from the depravation of the nervous humor, Melancholy,
Madness, and some wonderful Convulsive distempers proceed. But it may be
objected, that there is no such kind of humor, because the Nerves being cut
asunder, it is not perceived to flow out; and that the Nerves being also bound,
they do not swell above the Ligature, as Arteries and Veins. But it may be
answered, That the liquor flowing in the nervous stock, is very subtle and
spirituous, and which, by any striving or wrinkling up of those parts, when
they are roughly handled, may easily evaporate and be blown away or dispersed
unperceivably. Then further, it is observed in the Whelps of some Animals newly
litter'd, who have as yet that juice viscous, and not easily to be dispersed,
and that have their Nerves greater, if they be bound hard together with cords,
they will swell above the Ligature.

Therefore seeing it appears, that a certain Humor does creep through the blind
Pipes and passages of the Head and of the Appendix, both medullar and nervous,
it behooves us next of all to inquire from whence that comes thither, and
whither it tends; and lastly, of what kind of nature and use it is. Concerning
these first it appears, from what has been said, that the aforesaid Latex,
serving for a Vehicle of the animal Spirits, is perpetually instilled, together
with them, from the blood watering the exterior confines of the Brain and
Cerebel, which from thence, passing through the medullar Trunk, is afterward,
with a gentle spring, poured through the whole frame of the nervous System; so
that the first fountains of the nervous humor are in the Brain and Cerebel. But
further, to this Juice conveying the forces of the animal Spirits, and supplied
only from the Head, there joins a certain other humor, as it were auxiliar in
the whole passage, and restores and refreshes it otherwise about to grow
deficient.

We think that these kind of supplements and subsidies, which happen to come
from elsewhere to the nervous Juice flowing from the Head, are received and
admitted inwardly from the sides and extremities of the medullar and nervous
System. We have already showed that an humor, as it were secondary, is
instilled from the blood watering these parts in its whole passage; because the
Arteries follow not only the medullar Trunk, but also the greater Trunks of the
Nerves in many places, and insert into them sanguiferous shoots. Besides,
forasmuch as the animal Spirits flowing within the nervous stock for the
performing of sense and motion, tend to and fro, and so bear a double aspect;
it is probable also, that the liquor watering the Nerves, as it most commonly
tends forward, so sometimes backward; and so that the extremities of the
Nerves, implanted in some parts, imbibe from them the humor, at least some
Effluvia's, with which they are satisfied, and oftentimes transfer them into
the Brain it self. Certainly there is no doubt, that the Fibers and nervous
Filaments or threads which cover the Sensory of taste, and the Viscera serving
for Concoction, do immediately receive some tastes of the taken in food, from
which supplies are carried to the Brain it self in great hunger and faintness
of Spirits. Because if at any time the Spirits inhabiting it, being exhausted
very much with heavy and long labor, begin to fail, a most swift refection is
performed, Pectorals or Cordials being scarcely swallowed, and long indeed
before the alible Juice can be able to reach to the border of the Brain by the
passage of the blood. Moreover it is most likely, that not only the benign
Effluvia's of the aliment are received by the extremities of the Nerves ending
about the Viscera; but also by this way, that oftentimes an infestous matter,
and in a manner malignant, is communicated by the Nerves and their passages to
the Head. But indeed the preternatural Juyces heaped up about the Hypochondria,
the Spleen, Womb, and other Bowels emit vaporous little bodies, which not only
infect the bloody mass, and distemper the Head by that means, but they climb to
the Brain more immediately by the passage of the Nerves, and strike it with an
heavy ill. For from hence in part it comes, that Hypochondriacks and Hysterical
people are so cruelly punished through the Symptoms stirred up in the Brain and
nervous stock for the faults of the lower Bowels; hence it is, that little
Pills of Opium, being scarcely dissolved in the Stomach, cause a Torpor or
heaviness. But here is no place to discourse more largely of these. It behooves
us to consider what remains, the Springs of the nervous Juice, the Auxiliaries
but now detected, and its Virtues and Influences.

Concerning the nervous Liquor we shall inquire what that does in its passage,
to wit, whilst it flows within the Marrows or middles of the Brain and Cerebel,
the medullar Trunk and the bodies themselves of the Nerves: secondly, then for
what uses it serves, when being sliden from the ends of the Nerves, it is
spread abroad on the secondary parts of the nervous System.

1. As to the first, whilst that of the nervous Liquor passes through the Head,
and either of its Appendix, its chief office seems to be for a Vehicle of the
animal Spirits, which indeed it carries along with its diffusion, and contains
them under the same Systasis. Yea, this Latex shows various Schemes of the
Spirits for the performing of sense and motion; even as the humid Particles of
the Air pass through the Optic Configurations of the Rays of Light. Also
moreover, the nutrition of the aforesaid parts and accretion or growth into a
greater bulk, depends in some measure upon the nervous Juice watering the same,
as shall be showed by and by.

2. But the greatest question is concerning this Liquor being diffused beyond
the ends of the Nerves upon the secondary parts of the nervous System, and in
the passages of them on the whole Body; to wit, whether such a Juice be
nourishing of all the solid parts, or of some of them by themselves, as Authors
variously think; or to what other office it is destinated.

Concerning these it first appears, that the Brain and Nerves, with the Juice
flowing out of them, contribute matter, or at least some influence to the work
of nutrition; the which if it should chance to fail (a sign of which defect is,
if the animal Faculty falters in part) the nourishment there is wont presently
to be hindered or perverted. This is plainly seen in the Palsy, excited from an
evident cause, without any previous Dyscrasie of the blood, where suddenly an
Atrophy follows the privation of motion or sense, or of both together. Further,
in the Scurvy, where the taint has corrupted the nervous Juice, when the sick
begin to be afflicted with the Vertigo and swimming of the Head, and with
wandering pains, Convulsions, and a frequent loosning of the Members, the flesh
falls presently away, as in a Consumption, and without any fault of the Lungs,
the sick wither away, as if distempered with a Phthisis. It is a vulgar
observation, That from the immoderate use of Venus, also from an inveterate
Gonorrhoea, from Strumous or running Ulcers, and other Impostumes, by which
much of the nervous Juice is wasted, a leanness or wasting of the whole Body is
produced. Certainly, if I be not deceived, there are some Atrophies, yea, and
sorts of breakings out, which seem to depend wholly upon the defect or the evil
dispensation of the nervous Juice, when the blood, as to its quantity and
disposition, is not much in fault. Lastly, the consideration of some Diseases
and Symptoms so plainly confirms the diffusion of the nervous Liquor and its
great influence on all the parts, that there is even left no room for doubting.

Also no less does the curing of some Diseases and the use of Remedies confirm
the same. For from hence a reason is taken, wherefore Cephalic Plasters
oftentimes yield such signal help in the Phthisis; not because they stay the
Catarrh of the Serum falling down on the Lungs, (as the common people think)
but because by corroborating the Brain they restore the disposition of the
nervous Juice, before vitiated. For this cause it is, that some diseases being
stirred up by the fault of the nervous Liquor, of which sort among others are
Cancrous and Strumous Ulcers, or such as come of the King's Evil, are hardest of
all to be cured; because the morbid tincture of the Brain, and of the Latex
watering it (whether it be innate or acquired) is not easily mended: yet
sometimes when the root of the disease, lurking in the Brain or nervous stock,
is taken away by the help of Nature it self, or by Chance, by the use of some
remedy; presently the Symptoms of other parts, though neglected in the whole,
vanish, not without the suspicion of a miracle. But how much the alteration of
the Brain serves for the curing of some most grievous diseases, some instances
taken from the Farriers Art will clearly show.

For when many Medicines and Methods of Administrations are wont to be tried in
vain for the curing the stinking disease in Horses, commonly called the Farcy
(which Helmontius asserts to be like the French Pox, and the Author of its
Contagion) the most certain means of curing (which I have very often known to
be applied with good success) consists in this; that some sharp Medicines, of
which sort are Hearts-case, Water-Pepper, Ranunculus or Crowfoot, and the like,
which very much abound in volatile Salt, being bruised into a mass, and put
into the Ears of the diseased Horse, and kept there for twenty four hours: it
is scarce credible by what means all the Ulcers are presently dried up, and the
disease healed, as it were by Enchantment, is quickly profligated in the whole.
For since this Application is made far from the affected parts, without any
alteration of the bowels or the blood, it should be so healed at a distance;
certainly the cause of such an Energy must only be, that by this kind of
Medicine the Dyscrasie or evil disposition of the Brain and nervous Juice is
taken away, and so the first root of the sickness being cut off, the shoots and
fruits presently wither. It were worth our labor to try such kind of
Experiments also in our Medicines. Yea it may be well suspected, that such a
way ought to be ordered for the common Cure of the King's Evil. Among our
Countrymen, as delivered from our Ancestors, it is thought that the seventh
Son, or he that is born the seventh one after another in a continued series,
can cure this disease by stroking it only with his hand; and truly I have known
many, whom no Medicines could help, to have been cured in a short time only by
that remedy. Few doubt but that this disease is wont to be cured often by the
Touch of our King. The reason of such an effect (if it be merely natural) ought
to be assigned not to any other thing than that in the sick (especially those
of ripe age) the Fantasy and strong Faith of the hoped for Cure induces that
alteration, or rather strengthening to the Brain, whereby the morbid disposition
radicated in it is profligated. But I shall return from whence I am digressed,
to inquire what the nervous Juice contributes to nutrition.

2. I say therefore secondly, although nutrition depends in some measure upon
the influence of the nervous Juice, yet it is highly improbable, that all the
several parts of the whole Body should be nourished only by this provision. For
besides that this were to impose upon the Government of the Soul it self, and
its primary Organs, the cooking office of nutrition wholly unworthy the
excellency and dignity of those parts; it seems also that the nervous Liquor
should be altogether unfit for the administering to this Province: because when
oftentimes immense expenses are made of the aliment to be assimilated into the
substance of the solid parts, especially by immoderate sweat, also by continual
labor and exercise, which Countrymen and Laborers daily use, it is not
possible that such losses should be repaired only by the nourishment supplied,
or sent through the small passages of the Nerves.

When I had long and seriously considered with my self concerning this thing,
what I at length thought, I shall tell you freely, and without any covering, or
making any reflection, or blaming the Opinions of others. It seems first, that
the nourishing matter of the whole Body is distributed into all parts from the
blood through the Arteries; yet it may lawfully be thought, that the conversion
of this matter into nutriment, and the assimilation of it into the substance of
the part to be nourished, is performed by the influence and help of the nervous
Juice, as it were of a certain spirituous Ferment. As to the first: we have
already noted, that the sanguiferous Vessels do not only follow almost every
where the Muscles and Bowels, but also the Head and its Appendix, yea the
Membranes, Bones, and Nerves themselves, and affix to them all thick shoots, as
so many little channels, for the receiving the nourishment. Moreover, as there
is a purple crassament or thick substance in the blood, whose substance stuffs
and nourishes the Pores of the Parenchyma of the Muscles; so there is a whitish
Gelly, by which the Membranes and the whiter parts seem to increase. Besides it
may be observed, that the blood it self increasing, contains in it self fibers
and small threads, such as are interwoven in the Muscles and nervous parts; and
if the same stand long in any Vessel, it is presently coagulated into longish,
white, and hard crusts or bits, whose substance is plainly fleshy; so that the
blood produces flesh of it self, though the same be rude and unformed:
wherefore the configuration and the apt disposition of the nourishing matter,
supplied from it, depends on the coming and Energy of the nervous Juice: but
after what manner this is done, we shall endeavor now to show.

After the web or stuff of all the parts is laid, it is required then that they
be both drawn forth in due proportion, and grow in substance, and also that the
little spaces which are left by reason of the Effluvia's perpetually falling
off, may be continually filled with the nourishing substance cast in. In these
two things the business of nutrition chiefly consists; for the performing of
either of which the blood affords matter, and reaches it forth (as was said) in
the circulating to the several parts of the concrete, and as it were stands at
the doors of the part to be nourished: yet, that this matter may be rightly
disposed, and its particles, to wit, the thick and thin, saline and
sulphurous, and others of a several nature, separated one from another, may be
employed with some choice to the destinated uses, there seems need of a certain
directing faculty, and as it were plastic virtue, got somewhere else than from
the blood it self. For indeed the blood being destitute of animal Spirits, is
unfit for the performing these offices. Wherefore, for that it appears there
does lie hid in the nervous stock, a certain juice, and the same being gifted
with animal Spirit to be diffused to all parts, how can we suppose less but
that this subtle and spirituous Liquor, every where meeting with the arterious,
which is duller and thicker, actuates and inspires it, and as it were ordains
it for the performing the designed work of nutrition? especially when it
plainly appears, that by reason of the defect or depravation of this nervous
Juice, nutrition is always frustrated or perverted.

Therefore it may be lawful, in the difficult Controversy concerning the
Matter and Method of Cure, to propose this our Hypothesis, though it be a
Paradox and very abstruse; to wit, that the nervous Juice (which we have said
was like the male seed) is poured out with the nutritious humor copiously
suggested from the Arteries, as it were the genitive or seed of another Sex,
every where upon all the parts; and that this former, being endued with active
Elements, imbues the more thick matter, as with a certain Ferment, and
impregnates it with animal Spirit; and when it so makes it, with a mutual
entering in or coming together, to be dissolved and to go into parts, its
particles being extricated one from the other (the Spirit infused helping) they
are put upon bodies of the same measure with themselves, and are assimilated
into their substances. In the mean time, because the animal Spirits are poured
out in great plenty with the nervous Juice, those which are at leisure from the
work of nutrition, or remain after that is finished, turn aside every where
into the Fibers, as into proper dwelling-houses, and there being ready for the
offices of sense and motion, stay; which offices indeed, that those Spirits the
Inhabitants of the Fibers, may the better perform, they acquire from the blood
watering the Muscles, certain auxiliary forces, wherefore they being endued
with a certain elastick force, are apt to be highly rarefied and as it were
exploded.

But indeed we suppose, that as the nervous Liquor, being turgid with animal
Spirit, causes the arterious humor to become nutritious; so in compensation of
this the animal Spirits remaining of the work of nutrition, and every where
disposed within the Fibers, receive from the arterious blood a mixture or
certain Copula; by whose help and cooperation the same Spirits exert or put
forth much more strongly their locomotive force. For it seems that little
sulphurous bodies are added to the spirituous-saline particles from the
watering blood; and so when the animal Spirits are furnished with this Copula,
they being stirred up into motion, shake off the borrowed particles, which
being struck with a certain force, like the explosion of Gunpowder, suddenly
intumifie the Muscles, and so by contracting them very much, they cause a
vehement motive endeavor. We shall have an occasion of discoursing more at
large of this, when we treat of the Motion of the Muscles.

Yet in the mean time, we shall take notice, that the Muscles of the whole
Body, as to their motion, have a certain Analogy with the motion of the Heart.
For indeed the animal Spirits in the Heart, flowing within the fibers and
nervous threads, (with which this part is much beset) receive plentifully
sulphurous little bodies from the inflowing blood distending the sides of
either bosom, which whilst the same Spirits, being filled to a fullness, shake
off and as it were explode, a Systole of the whole Heart (its sides being
carried with a certain force inwards) is brought in or caused, whereby the
blood, from either side the bosom, is cast out as it were by the impulse of a
Spring or Bolt. Truly, unless the Spirits inhabiting the Heart, should receive
food and matter of explosion from the blood it self, their stock, supplied or
sent by the passage of the few and small Nerves, would not suffice for the
performing of the undiscontinued motion. A sign of this is, that from a defect
or depravation of the blood, as well as of the animal Spirits, the motion also
of the Heart is ^efective or diminished. And not much unlike in the Muscles, as
in the Heart, is the business performed; the Spirits inhabiting their Fibers,
receive a sulphurous Copula and apt for explosion, from the blood there more
plentifully flowing than about the Membranes, with which being endued, as often
as they receive from the Nerve as it were the fiery inkindling or the match,
the instinct of the motion to be performed, they being excited, and striking of
their Copula, very much inflate or blow up the Muscle, and intumifie it for
performing or compassing the motive endeavor. Nor is it much to purpose, or
makes any great difference, that the motion of the Heart, stirred up by a
perpetual instinct, is found always necessary; but the Muscles the most of them
only occasionally and at the command of the Animal, do put forth their motive
power; for the Diaphragma and some Muscles, dedicated to Respiration, are urged
with a perpetual Systole and Diastole, as well as the Heart it self.

From the aforesaid Hypothesis concerning the offices and uses of the nervous
and arterious Juice, Arguments that otherwise determine the work of Nutrition,
may be easily answered. For that the blood is said rather to prey upon the
solid parts than to replenish them, that ought to be attributed to the Disease
and Dyscrasie of it, and not to it simply: because sometimes the blood is
accused, for that it too much stuffs the solid parts; to wit, forasmuch as its
mass being waterish and weak, it lays aside the alible Juice (which not being
truly cooked, is still crude and vicious) with very great plenty about the
habit of the Body, and so induces an Anasarca. In the mean time it ought to be
granted, That as it is the blood that is evil which heaps up too much vicious
nutriment; so it is the same, which being well and right, does laudably perform
the office of Nutrition.

But that it is argued, That the nervous is rather the nourishing Juice,
because by reason of its defect, depravation or too prodigal expense, the acts
of nutrition are wont to be hindered or perverted; it is easy to reply to this,
That the impediments of the nervous Juice, being made vicious, respect the form
of nourishment, and not the matter of it: to wit, it sometimes happens, that
the blood dispenses the alible matter in due plenty and disposition; which
notwithstanding, by the fault of the nervous Juice, is not rightly assimilated.
When an impotency of motion comes upon a too great distension of the Muscle or
Tendon with pain, shortly nutrition being hindered, a Jelly grows about the
distempered part: which notwithstanding drops not out of the Nerve (as is
commonly said) but the glutinous humor being poured out of the Arteries for
aliment, for that it cannot be received by the hurt part, is gathered together
there: nor is it to be thought, that Tumors, or Strumous Ulcers or the running
Sores of the Evil do contain or pour out only a nervous humor, since the matter
of either is for the most part bloody, which by reason of the evil Ferment of
the nervous Juice, puts on a strange form, and that diversely degenerous.

This supposition of the twofold Humor, for the matter and form of nourishment,
is taken to be of egregious use for the solving of the most difficult
Phenomenon, which are met with about the Distempers of the Brain and nervous
Juice: yea, that Pathology, seriously considered, seems to infer as a certain
necessary consequence, that a twofold Juice is necessary for the work of
Nutrition; as some other time perhaps we may show. In the mean time, leaving
this Speculation, we shall proceed to the remaining Task of our Anatomy, to
wit, the Neurologie or of the Nerves in particular.

THE Description and Use OF THE NERVES.
CHAP. XXI. The first four Pair of Nerves arising within the Skull are
described.
THE division or distinction of the Nerves, by reason of their various
respects, is wont to be manifold: to wit, as they are either soft or hard,
singular or numerous in their beginnings; or that they serve either to the
faculty of Sense, or Motion, or to both together. But they are commonly
distinguished, That some Nerves arising within the Skull, proceed from the
oblong Marrow; and others going out of the joints of the Vertebrae, are derived
from the spinal Marrow. But besides these, another manner of differencing them
seems best to us; to wit, That some Nerves, as it were Clients and Servants of
the Brain, perform only spontaneous Acts, and others, Ministers and Servants of
the Cerebel, are employed only about the exercises of the involuntary Function.
There will be no need to assign different Essences or Constitutions of Nerves
according to these several differences: but rather that there be instituted a
particular Cense or Muster of them, and following the order of Nature, that we
especially unfold every one of them in the series in which they are disposed in
the animal Body.

Among the Nerves arising from the Skull, the smelling Nerves, or those which
are commonly called the Mammillary Processes, lead the way; for that they have
their rise before all the rest, and are stretched out forward beyond the Brain
it self. These Nerves go out of the shanks of the oblong Marrow within the
chamfered bodies and chambers of the Optic Nerves; and being endued with a
manifest cavity, open into the first Ventricle of the Brain on either side
behind the same chamfered bodies; so that the humidity flowing between the
folding of the Brain, is carried through these channels into the mammillary
Processes; whether they go farther forward, shall be anon inquired into:
Because these Nerves being broad and large, arising near the chamfered bodies,
and from thence stretched forward under the Basis of the Brain, their bulk is
increased by degrees till they go into the round Processes like Paps, by which
either bosom of the Cribrous or Sieve-like Bone is besmeared. Within the Socket
of this Bone these Nerves, as yet soft and tender, obtain Coats of the Dura
Matter; with which being divided into many fibers and filaments, and passing
through the holes of the Sieve-like Bone, they go out of the Skull: from whence
being dilated or carried forward into the caverns of the Nostrils, and
distributed on every side, they are inserted into the Membrane bespreading
those Labyrinths.

If we inquire into the nature and use of these parts, without doubt the
mammillary Processes and their medullar roots, with the fibers and small
threads hanging to the same, are truly Nerves, and serve properly for the very
Organ of the Smell. Seeing these conduce to the sense only without any local
motion, therefore (even as the other hearing Nerve) whilst they are within the
Skull, they are plainly medullar and soft; whereby the animal Spirits more
easily moved within the more tender substance of the Nerves, might convey more
readily and accurately to the common Sensory the Ideas or forms of the sensible
Species: But because the effluvia's or odorous breaths to be received by the
naked Organ, carry oftentimes with them sharp and pricking Particles hurtful to
the Brain and Nerves; therefore in the first course these Nerves being about to
go out of the Skull, borrow Coats from the Dura Matter, which serve for Armor.
Further, as these breaths (lest they should strike more sharply by rushing
impetuously on the Sensory) being admitted only by little and little, and by
small bands, ought to be brought through diverse narrow turnings and windings of
the Nostrils; therefore that these Nerves may the better receive the effluvia's
flowing within the several dens, they are so divided into very many fibers and
small threads or filaments, that there may be no passage of the Nostrils to
which at least some of them are not destinated. And after this manner, although
the exhalations, as it were torn into little Clouds, are received by the
nervous filaments, and so care is sufficiently taken, that they being more
thickly elevated, may not overwhelm or obscure the Sensory; yet lest any thing
sharp and troublesome should be carried with them to the Brain, the cribrous
bone is set before the doors as an obstacle, through whose little holes being
strained, they may put off all sharpness. And lastly, they being carried
through the softer Nerve, as it were another Medium, and so broken again, they
at length being soft and gentle enough, are staid at the first Sensory.

But that these Nerves are noted through the whole with an open hollowness
within the Skull, the reason seems to be, that the watery humor stilling out of
the foldings of the Brain, and being derived into those channels, might beat
back and temper the impressions of the odours, when too sharp and fiery: for as
the humors included in the Eye, variously refract the visible Species, whereby
it passing at last through the Optic Nerve without any force, slides
pleasantly to the common Sensory; so it is not improbable, that the water
contained within these passages of the Nerves, does in like manner sweeten the
species of the odours, and prepare them in some measure for the Sensory.
Wherefore it is observed, that Cattle and Beasts which are fed with herbage,
have the mammillary Processes exceeding large and always full of water; to wit,
lest the odours of the herbs continually attracted by them (unless their force
should be blunted after the aforesaid manner) might hurt or overthrow their
more weak brain. Besides, it is very likely that this watery juice falling down
from the enfolding of the Brain, does not only flow into the open channels of
the Nerves and the mammillary Processes, but also does pass through by the
passage of the fibers and filaments the holes of the Sieve-like Bone, and does
wet and continually moisten the cavities of the Nostrils, apt to be dried or
torrified too much by the Air thither attracted, and by the breath continually
blown out. For it clearly appears, as we have elsewhere shown, that the serous
humors creep through the blind passages of the Nerves and Fibers, and by them
wander from place to place. Yea it may be thought, that not only water,
sufficient for the watering the Nostrils, does by this way sweat through; but
also whenever the serous heap is gathered together in the Ventricles of the
Brain, its superfluities or the excrementitious humor does very often pass
through the cribrous Bone by the passage of the Fibers, and is sent out. But we
have in another place discoursed more largely of this.

The smelling Nerves, which have within the Skull their mammillary Processes
depending on them, are much greater in an Ox, Goat, and in Cattle, and such
like beasts that live on herbage, than in flesh-eating Animals; to wit, because
in those there seems to be more need of the sense of smelling to be more
exquisite for the knowing the virtues of the manifold herbs. Also these Nerves
are larger in all Brutes than in Man: the reason of which is, because they
discern things only by the sense, and especially their food by the smell; but
Man learns many things by education or nurture and discourse, and is rather led
by the taste and sight, than by the smell in choosing his aliments. These Nerves
in Birds, as also in Fishes, are conspicuous enough; for either of these, even
as four-footed beasts, seek out and choose their food by the help or knowledge
of the smell.

As to the Fibers and Filaments or little strings stretching out from the more
soft Nerves through the holes of the Sieve-like Bone into the caverns of the
Nose, these are found in all Creatures who have the mammillary Processes: so
that it is not to be doubted, but that these Processes, with this Appendix and
its medullary origin, is the Organ of the Smell. And what more confirms this
thing, these filaments or little strings are far more, and more remarkable in
hunting Hounds than in any other Animal whatsoever. But besides these Nervulets
drawn through the holes of the Sieve-like Bone into the Nostrils, two branches
also are sent hither from the fifth pair, and distributed into both the
Nostrils. The reason of this seems to be, because though the Nerves but now
described, or of the first Conjugation, are properly smelling Nerves, and
effect by themselves the sense of Smelling; yet these are assisted or joined
with other Nerves, also by those sent from the fifth pair, because the Organ of
the Smell ought to have a consent with all other parts, which those subsidiary
Nerves, by reason of the manifold branching out of the fifth pair, are wont to
perform. It chiefly appears, that there is a certain nearness or strict
affinity between the taste and the smell: and the cause of this consists, in
that out of the same Trunk of the fifth pair certain Nerves are sent to the
Palate, and others to the Nostrils. Concerning the reason of that wonderful
consent which the Nostrils have with the Praecordia in sneezing, also wherefore
that light titillation stirs up a Cough, shall be spoken of hereafter, when we
come to unfold the fifth pair and the intercostal Nerves. But in the mean time
we shall take notice, that although many Nerves belong to the Organ of
Smelling, yet that sense is properly performed by the Fibers interwoven in the
inward Coat of the Nostrils: for those Fibers being struck by the sensible
object, move and contract themselves variously according to the Idea of the
impression; which Affection of them being carried by the passage of the Nerves
to the Head, forasmuch as it is there staid by the common Sensory, causes the
perception of the sense. Those sensible Fibers are diversely figured in several
Animals; which is the reason, why odorous things do not alike affect all
Animals. For what things by a man's nostrils, as endued with too sharp and
pricking Effluvia's, are esteemed highly naught and stinking, as especially are
dung and putrid flesh; the same are to Dogs, whose Organ of Smelling is made or
consists of more robust or strong Fibers, and proportionate to those
Effluvia's, as very grateful and chosen for food.

The second Conjugation are the Optic or seeing Nerves: concerning which we
have shown already, in the Anatomy of the Brain, after what manner they arise
from behind the chamfered bodies out of the second section of the medullar
shanks (which Galen calls the Chamber of the Optic Nerve) and descending from
thence with a certain compass are united, and being again separated and carried
into the Ball of the Eyes, constitute with diffused Fibers the hard Coat.
Moreover, in those Observations we did but now take notice, that the Trunk of
this Nerve growing a little hard without the Skull, was as it were a little
bundle of very many Fibers or small strings growing together into one, and of
produced Parallels, as it should seem for that end, that the animal Spirits,
flowing in the whole Nerve, might be moved in so many lines or direct rays; to
wit, whereby they may carry the visible Species, sufficiently refracted in the
Eye, thence to the common Sensory by a direct beam, and not intorted or rolled
about.

As often as in the distempers of the Eyes blackish pricks or concatenated
pieces of any thing seem to be rolled before the Eyes, it is likely that this
apparition is so made, because certain filaments or small strings of the Optic
Nerve are shut up, which when the light cannot pass through rightly, as through
the rest, so many as it were shadowy spaces appear in the middle of the
clearness. These Nerves, because they only serve for the sense, are therefore
more soft within the Skull: but because there may be need perhaps, that the
Trunk of this Nerve ought to be sometimes dilated or spread abroad, sometimes
bound close together or contracted according to the diverse appearance and
incourse of the objects; therefore very many Fibers, being sent out from the
motory or moving Nerves of the Eyes, do every where compass and bind it about,
and entering with it into the Ball of the Eye, are inserted partly near the root
of the Optic Nerve, and partly penetrate more deeply the Sclerotick or hard
Coat it self.

Further, the Optic Nerves are not only bound or environed with nervous Fibers
sent from the third pair, but (as we have shown above) with sanguiferous
Vessels in their whole process. The office of which certainly is, both that
there might be every where about the greater Trunk of this Nerve as it were a
continual heat or sufficient fireplace; also perhaps, that the food of the
bloody humor might be supplied to the Spirits, living there within the trunks
of the nerves, far from the fountain, as is wont to be in other places.

Concerning the Fabric of the Eye it self, and manner of seeing, also
concerning the whole dioptrick provision, here seems a fit opportunity of
discoursing: but this were to digress too far from our purpose, to wit, the
mere or naked Doctrine of the Nerves; and I may the better pass by this
addition, because this Province has been sufficiently and accurately adorned
by others. In the mean time we shall take notice, that as in the smelling, so
also in seeing, the sense is performed, not so much by the help of the nerve,
as of the fibers, which are interwoven with the organ: to wit, the little
fibers in the Membranes of the Eyes, and especially those inserted into the
Sclerotick Coat, and disposed after the manner of a net, do receive the
impression of the visible Species, and by representing the image of the thing,
so as it is offered without, causes sight. But it is the office of the nerve it
self to transmit inwardly, as it were by the passage of the Optic Pipe, that
image or sensible Species, and to carry it to the common Sensory.

The third Conjugation of Nerves are the moving nerves of the Eyes, which arise
in the Basis of the medullar Stem behind the Tunnel; from whence going forwards
nigh the pair of seeing nerves, and going out of the Skull with the other
nerves destinated to the Eye, they are carried toward the Globe of the Eye;
where, being presently divided into many branches, they provide it with moving
Muscles; but with various difference in diverse living Creatures. For in an Ox,
who has got a larger eye, the moving nerve of the eye imparts a branch to
every one of the six common Muscles; and besides, from the nerves of the
fourth, fifth, and sixth pair certain branches are distributed to some of the
same Muscles: so that, as often as any Animal intends or applies the sense for
the perceiving of this or that object, these nerves turn about the Eye, and
compose it at their pleasure for the spontaneous beholding of the same. Besides
we take notice, that the Eyes do get a diverse kind of involuntary motion;
because in Fear, Shame, Anger, Sadness, yea and in all Affections of the Head
and Heart, whether we will or no, the Eyes are respectively figured. Wherefore
it is highly probable, that these kind of pathetick motions of the Eyes, whereof
the living Creature is scarce knowing, are performed by the help of the other
nerves, to wit, of those coming from the fourth, fifth, and sixth pair: and
that more manifestly appears, because the same nerves which lend their branches
to the Eye, take their origines from the Cerebel, the office of which we have
often shown to be, to dispense the Spirits for the exercise of the involuntary
Function.

But concerning these Nerves of the third pair, which are properly called the
Moving nerves of the Eyes, we observe, that in Man, a Dog, and in some other
living Creatures they are found to be somewhat otherwise than in an Ox: for
either nerve in these, as in the rest, is carried out of the Skull, divided
into four branches, three of which are carried from thence into three straight
distinct Muscles, to wit, one lifting up, the other bringing together, the
third pressing close the Eye; the other branch of it goes forwards further with
a single trunk, and is implanted in the middle of the Muscle going about the
Eye, turning obliquely to the inward corner downwards. From these it appears,
that these Muscles, to which this nerve belongs in all, are sufficient almost
of themselves to perform most spontaneous motions of the Eye: but where the
aforesaid nerve is divided into four shoots, it constitutes a small and round
enfolding, out of which many small shoots creep through, and variously compass
about the trunk of the Optic nerve; for what use it is so made, we have
already intimated.

The fourth Conjugation of Nerves (which we call rightly the Fourth by order
and succession, although it is accounted the eighth and last by Fallopius) has
a diverse origin from all the rest. For whereas most of the others proceed
from the foot or sides of the oblong Marrow, this has its root in the top of
it behind the round Protuberances, called Nates and Testes: From whence,
bending more forward nigh the sides of the oblong Marrow, it is presently hid
under the Dura Matter; under which going along for some space, and passing
through the Skull at the same hole with the rest destinated to the Eye, it is
bestowed with a single trunk, not communicating with any of the other nerves,
wholly on the Muscle called the Trochlear Muscle. Above we called these nerves
the Pathetick nerves of the Eyes: for although some besides may deserve this
name, (as shall be shown by and by) yet it is most likely, that the proper
office of these is to move the Eyes pathetically, according to the force of the
Passions and instinct of Nature, delivered and remanded from the Brain to the
Cerebel, and so on the contrary, from this to that through the Nates and
Testes, and their medullar Processes. For, as we have shown, that by the
diverse impulse and waving of the animal Spirits dwelling in this by-path,
there are instituted certain mutual commerces between the Brain and the
Praecordia, (the Cerebel mediating between either) it will be of necessity,
that these nerves, rooted in the middle way, should be struck by every tending
downwards or remove of the Spirits, going this way or that way, and so the
motions of the Eyes to follow the affections of those parts. All perfect
Animals are furnished with these nerves; and in truth, as none of them but are
obnoxious to Anger, Love, Hatred, and other Affections, so every little
Creature show these by the mere aspect and by the gesture it self of the Eyes.
We see sometimes the greater Pike gaping for his prey first of all to roll
about his eyes, and to look four; then with a swift shooting out of his body to
invade the lesser fry of fish.

CHAP. XXII. The fifth, sixth, and seventh Pair of Nerves are unfolded.
OF the aforesaid four Pair of Nerves, the two former seem chiefly to serve for
the Sense only, but the two latter for Motion; and every single nerve of them
destinated to a peculiar Province: but this which follows next, to wit, the
fifth Conjugation of Nerves serves for the exercise of either Faculty, to wit,
both of Sense and Motion; nor is its Province so strictly bounded, that it
should belong only to one member, for it is distributed to the Eyes, Nose, and
Palate, and the rest of the parts of the Face; and besides, helps in its part
in some sort the offices and actions of the Praecordia and almost of all the
Viscera.

This pair (which by the Ancients was accounted the third, by us the fifth
pair, and that by right of order or position) below the former nerves, proceeds
with a broad and large trunk from the sides of the annular Protuberance or
Process sent out from the Cerebel. It consists of very many Fibers gathered
together, some of which are soft, others hard; so that the great trunk of it
near its beginning, is nothing else than a little bundle of very many nerves,
some of which are bestowed on these parts, and others on other parts, and in
some they perform the offices of motion, in others of sense. But that so many
nerves being destinated to so many several members, and remote one from
another, yet arising together, are collected as it were into one bundle, the
reason is, that in all the parts to which those nerves belong, a certain
Sympathy and consent of actions might be conserved: to wit, the communion of
those nerves is the cause why the sight and smell move spittle and please the
Palate; nor by any other means are the Praecordia affected, according to the
various conceptions of the Brain, and transmit their affections ^o he several
parts of the Face; from whence the aspect or countenance of the whole Animal is
pathetically figured, as shall be showed more particularly below.

In the mean time, let us deliver a short Hypotype or figure of this Nerve; its
trunk going out of the sides of the greater Ring, sometimes near its beginning,
but oftener the Dura Matter being first perforated or passed through, is divided
into two noted branches. The first of these tending straight downward, going
out of the Skull at a proper hole, in its descent toward the lower Jaw, (to
whose parts it is chiefly destinated) is divided into more branches, with which
it furnishes the Temple-muscle, also the Muscles of the Face and Cheeks.
Moreover from them shoots and branches are distributed into the Lips, Gums,
roots of the Teeth, Jaws, Throat, the farther end of the Palate, yea and the
Tongue; for this reason chiefly, that the nerves going out of the lower branch
of the fifth pair, might effect, besides sense, the diverse offices of Taste and
Touch or Feeling, and motions of a various kind in the aforesaid members and
parts; most of which, as the chewing of the aliment, also those which have
respect to configuration or framing of the mouth and face in laughing or
weeping (as we have already noted) are performed unknown to the Brain, that is
involuntarily, and by the help of the Cerebel only, from which these Nerves are
derived.

The other superior, and also the greater branch of the fifth pair under the
Dura Matter nigh the side of the Turkey Chair goes straight forward for a little
space, and is enlarged into some shoots over against the pituitary Glandula to
the trunk of the Carotick Artery or the wonderful Net, (where it is present)
then it is inoculated into the nerve of the sixth pair, and from thence sends
back sometimes one, sometimes two shoots; which being united with another
shoot, turned back from the nerve of the sixth pair, constitute the root or
first trunk of the intercostal Nerve. Concerning this intercostal nerve, which
is made of the lower ramification or branching out of the nerves of the fifth
and sixth pair, it shall be spoken of particularly hereafter.

Presently after the branches or shoots reflected or bent back for the root of
the intercostal nerve, that greater nerve of the fifth pair is divided into two
noted branches. The lesser and uppermost of these tending toward the globe of
the Eye, and becoming again twofold, sends forth two branches from it self; one
of which turning toward the inward side of the Bone, containing the ball or
angle of the Eye, is divided into two shoots. The other of these having passed
through the Bone nigh the mammillary Processes, is carried into the nostrils:
the office of this nerve is to keep a Sympathy and consent of action between
the nostrils and some other parts: but the other branch of this division is
bestowed on the Muscle by which Brutes wink.

The second Ophthalmick branch of the fifth pair is divided into four or five
shoots, all which going forward above the Muscles of the Eye, and in some part
passing through its Glandula's, are almost all lost in the Eyebrows, unless
that in the passage they send down two small shoots which enter the Sclerotick
Coat a little below the Tendons of the Muscles, and reach to the Wea, or the
fourth thin Membrane that clothes the Optic nerve; yea and also send in the
passage small shoots to the Glandula's of the Eye. It seems that these nerves
of the fifth pair, being distributed into the Glandula's of the Eyes and
Eyebrows, serve chiefly to the involuntary and pathetick actions of those
parts; the chief of which are, the languishing and mournful aspect of the Eyes
in weeping, and the unwilling pouring out of tears. For as the lower branching
of the fifth pair, to wit, the intercostal nerve, provideth in man for the
Praecordia, it easily happens, that from the sad affection of these, the
Cardiack branches of this nerve being forced and wrinkled into Convulsions, the
aforesaid Ophthalmick branches also so correspond, and by wrinkling the
Eyebrows, and by compressing the Glandula's, produce those kind of looks of
the Eyes, and marks of sorrow and grief. Further it is observed, that from the
Ophthalmick branch of the fifth pair a certain shoot is sent back higher nigh
the heads of the Muscles; which when it has passed through at a proper hole,
the Bone containing the ball of the Eye, is carried straight into the caverns
of the Nostrils. Hence, as I think, a reason may be given, wherefore passing
out of a dark place into the light, at the first beholding of the Sun,
presently whether we will or no we shall sneez; to wit, the eyes being too
strongly struck by the object, and being suddenly and disorderly moved, that
they might turn themselves aside, the same affection is immediately
communicated through the aforesaid Nerve to the Membrane covering the hollow
caverns of the Nostrils, which being thence contracted and wrinkled, (as it is
wont by some sharp thing pulling it) provokes sneezing.

The second or greater branch of the second division of the Nerve of the fifth
pair being carried nigh the ball of the Eye, is again divided into two
branches. The lower of these being bent downwards, cleaving into many shoots,
is bestowed on the Palate and upper region of the Jaws: The other and higher
branch of this second division stretching beyond the ball of the Eye, passes
through, together with the Vein and Artery, a proper hole made in the bone of
the upper Jaw; which Vessels this Nerve climbs and variously compasses about
with many shoots sent forth; then arising out of the bone, it imparts little
branches to the Muscles of the Cheeks, Lips, Nose, and to the roots of the
upper Teeth. Therefore forasmuch as this Nerve embraces and binds about the
sanguiferous Vessels destinated to the Cheeks and the other parts of the Face;
from hence a reason may be given, why the face is covered with blushing by
shame: for the animal Spirits being disturbed by the imagination of an unseemly
thing, by and by endeavoring as it were to hide the face, their irregularities
enter this Nerve, so that the shoots of the same Nerve embracing the
blood-carrying Vessels, by compressing and pulling the same, cause the blood to
be more forced into the Cheeks and Face, and the Veins being bound hard to be
there for some time staid and detained. But forasmuch as many shoots and fibers
of the same maxillar Nerve, derived from the fifth pair, interweave themselves
with the flesh and skin of the Lips, hence the reason is plain, why these parts
are so very sensible, and besides, why the mutual kisses of Lovers, impressed
on the Lips, so easily irritate love and lust by affecting both the Praecordia
and Genitals; to wit, because the lower branching of the same fifth pair
actuates these parts constituted in the middle and lower Belly, and draws them
into the like affection with the Lips. The same reason holds of Love presently
admitted by the eyes, that as the Poet says, Mars videt hant, visamque cupit.
As soon as Mars saw her, he desired her.


We have but now intimated, that many shoots of this Nerve were destinated for
the business of chewing; and therefore, because the aliments to be taken ought
to undergo not only the examination of the taste, but also of the smell and
sight, from the same Nerve, whose branches being sent to the Palate and Jaws,
perform the business of chewing, other shoots, as it were forerunners, are
carried to the Nostrils and Eyes, to wit, that these Organs of the other Senses
might be furnished with some helps of probation also, for the better knowing or
distinguishing the objects of taste. Certainly from the nearness of kindred and
manifold affinity of this Nerve, being also much diffused in the Head, the
mutual dependencies and confederations of very many of its parts, proceed. But
how this Nerve in other Provinces, to wit, in the Thorax and lower belly, and
there about the motions and sensions of the Praecordia and Viscera, does cause
various Sympathies of them among themselves and with other parts, shall
afterward be more largely shown, when we shall speak particularly of the
intercostal Nerve, which is rooted in this nerve of the fifth pair; where, from
the manifold communication of this nerve, may be easily drawn the reasons of
sneezing, yawning, laughing, crying, and of other actions merely natural. In
the mean time, the superior branching of the nerve of the fifth pair shows it
self after this manner in the Head, and almost after the same manner is
divaricated in most living Creatures; except however, that in some, presently
after its rise, it is divided into three great branches; one of which is
destinated to the lower Jaw, the other to the Eye and Nose, and the third to
the Cheek.

The Nerve of the sixth Conjugation follows, which arising out of the lowest
foot of the annular Protuberance, and being hid under the Dura Matter, presently
goes out of the Skull at the same hole with the nerves of the third and fourth
pair, and is carried with a single trunk into the ball of the Eye; but so, that
near the side of the Turkey Chair it is inoculated with the second branch, or
the greater of the fifth pair; from whence it turns back, sometimes one little
branch, sometimes two; which being united with the branches of the fifth pair
running back, constitute the beginning of the intercostal nerve. Then this
nerve going forwards, is divided into two branches near the ball of the Eye;
one of which is inserted into the Muscle drawing back the Eye planted in its
outward angle; and the other being torn into various fibers, is bestowed on the
seventh Muscle proper to Brutes; so that this nerve also seems to serve to
those motions of the Eye that are almost only pathetick, or excited by natural
Instinct. For, as to the use of the former shoot, it plainly appears, that it
is innate to every Animal in a sudden fear to draw the eyes backward, and to
look for what is to be feared on either side and behind: then as to its other
shoot, whereby Brutes wink or twinkle the eye, it is obvious that this same
motion is sudden and extemporary, without any previous intention, whereby the
eye endeavors to shun the injuries of outward things that occur.

The seventh Conjugation of Nerves, accounted for the fifth by the Ancients, is
employed about the sense of hearing. Of this pair commonly are noted two
Processes, the one soft, the other hard; which indeed seem to be two distinct
nerves, for that although they have their beginnings nigh one another, yet are
somewhat distinct, and are carried to diverse Organs; in the mean time, either
agreeing in a certain common respect of use or action. For whilst one nerve
performs the act of hearing, the other supplies some requisites whereby that
act may be the better performed: wherefore we shall not much strive against the
common description of this pair, by which it is taken for one. The process of
this pair, or the auditory nerve properly, which is called the soft Branch,
seems to arise in man out of the lower side of the ringy Protuberance, and in
beasts out of the midst of the lesser Ring. In some Dissections I plainly
found, that this softer nerve, having its beginning lower, seemed to ascend a
little before it went out of the medullar stock; and the other more hard nerve
seeming to arise higher ( viz. out of the medullar whitish line leading about
the bottom of the fourth Ventricle) did descend a little, and arose near the
meeting with the other. This softer nerve is carried into the passage of the
stony Bone, where entering into the den destinated for the receiving the sound,
which is on this side the Snail-like winding and the Drum, it so infolds it
self into the most thin Membrane wherewith that den is covered, that as often
as the Air implanted in that cavern is moved by the stroke of the external Air
made upon the Drum, this impression striking this Membrane, and stirring up as
it were an undulation of the animal Spirits, is forthwith carried toward the
common Sensory by the passage of the nerve there implanted. There will be a
more opportune place of discoursing, after what manner, and by what sort of
Organs Hearing is performed, when we shall speak of the Senses.

The other Nerve of this pair, or the more hard process, which conduces rather
to motion than sense, passing through the stony Bone at an hole proper to it
self, arises near the auditory passage, where it presently receives into its
trunk a branch from the wandering pair brought thither; then immediately after
that joining together or coalition, it is divided into two branches: The first
of these tending downwards, is bestowed upon the Muscles of the Tongue and the
Bone Hyoides; the other going about the auditory passage, and bending more
upwards, is divided into three shoots; the first of which, answering to the
nerve of the former division, bestows some shoots on the Muscles of the Lips,
Mouth, Face, and Nostrils, and so actuates some exterior Organs for the forming
the voice, as the former does some interior Organs. The second shoot of this
division distributes its shoots into the Muscles of the Eyebrows and Forehead;
and the third into the Muscles of the Ear it self. The offices and uses of all
these have been already shown, the sum of which is, that as often as the sound
is admitted in, especially if it be any ways unusual, new, or to be wondered at,
presently by a certain natural instinct the Ears and Eyes erect and open
themselves: to wit, for that end shoots from this nerve are inserted into the
Muscles of the Eyelids and Ears, that by the passage of these, the Spirits
inhabiting either Region, might be called out as it were to watch. For a like
reason shoots from the same hard process of this nerve are distributed both
into the Muscles of the Tongue and of the Bone Hyoides; as also into those of
the Lips and the outward parts of the Mouth, that by their passage, the sound
being transmitted further to these Organs of the voice, it being equal or like
the same, might officiously answer it as were an Echo. That the descriptions of
the aforesaid nerves might be better understood, I have thought good here to
represent in the following Figure the branchings of the fifth and sixth pair.
The seventh pair is fitly delineated in the ninth Figure.

CHAP. XXIII. The Description of the eighth Pair of Nerves.
THE Conjugation of the Nerves of the eighth pair, accounted by the Ancients
for the sixth, is called the Wandering pair; to wit, for that its Nerve, not
content with one member or region of the Body, is thought to respect diverse
parts, and those different, and situate at a great distance one from another,
and to reach forth its branchings, not only in the neighborhood about the Head
and Neck, but through the whole cavity of the middle and lowest Belly, and to
most of the Bowels in either. But indeed this nerve has a province large
enough, yet not so diffuse as is commonly thought: for many other nerves,
inoculated into this, join themselves with it, and are accounted a part of it,
although they have distinct beginnings, and going away again from the nerve of
the eighth pair, have peculiar divarications, and different from it. Wherefore,
that we may give to each its own, we shall endeavor to prosecute this nerve of
the wandering pair from the beginning to the end; and also show the
confederations and coincidences or joynings together of others with it.

The eighth Conjugation therefore of the Nerves arises below the auditory or
hearing nerves out of the sides of the oblong Marrow, its root consisting of
numerous Fibers. In a man there are at least twelve, some of which are greater,
others smaller; to which is added a noted Fiber, or rather Nerve, much greater
than the rest, from the spinal Marrow, which being joined with them, and
wrapped about with the same Coat, taken from the Dura Matter, goes forth
together out of the Skull, as if they all grew into one Trunk: but that
accessory nerve, yea and many other Fibers, do still remain distinct under that
covering, and afterward departing asunder, are carried into peculiar provinces.

Because this spinal Nerve having passed the Skull, leaving its Conjugation, is
carried to the muscles of the Neck and Shoulders; besides, the noted Fiber, out
of the beginning of the wandering pair, is presently carried into the hard
process of the seventh Conjugation; and two other Fibers, having presently left
the company of the rest, go into the muscles of the Throat and Neck: but the
rest of the Fibers, being collected together, go forward still as Companions,
and instead of their other Companions which departed from them, they presently
get new in their places; to wit, sometimes the whole trunk of the intercostal
nerve it self, as is seen in most four-footed Beasts, sometimes only a branch
of it comes to them, as is observed in Man and some other living Creatures.

In this place where the trunk or branch of the intercostal Nerve is inoculated
into the trunk of the wandering pair, a noted enfolding is constituted, to wit,
the trunk of the nerve being there made greater, seems to be lifted up, and to
grow out into a certain Tumor like to a callous or sinewy-swelled body: here,
for that it is somewhat long, it is called by Fallopius the Olive body; of
which sort the same Author affirms, there comes to this nerve sometimes one,
sometimes two; but in truth, one is constantly found in the trunk of the
wandering pair, but the other in the neighboring intercostal.

Of these sort of infoldings in general we shall take notice, that they are
made in the Nerves, as joints in a Cane, or knots in the stem of a Tree, viz.
as often as a branch goes out of the trunk, or sliding into another place, is
received into the same; and when oftentimes some shoots go away from the same
place, and others come to it, the enfolding there becomes greater; and so the
more branches and shoots do happen to come together any where, or to go out of
a nerve, the greater the bulk and magnitude of the enfolding is increased: but
if at any time a branch seems to proceed from any nerve without constituting an
enfolding, in truth, being included only in the same Coat, it is not accounted
so much a branch as a companion, which by a passage long before, had gone
together forwards, as a single nerve it self, and distinct enough, nor was it
at all inoculated before its departure. But the use of these same infoldings
seems to be the same with the knots in the stem of a Tree, or such as the
turnings aside or bypath that lie near cross-ways; to wit, that when the
animal Spirits, together with the nervous Juice, institute diverse journies,
lest mutually meeting, they should be confounded, they may be able to turn
aside a little, and depart one from another till they may recover their orders
and just method.

In the Dissection of the Nerves, which are distributed to the Praecordia and
Viscera, the two Ganglioform infoldings, to wit, the aforesaid in the trunk of
the wandering pair, and the other near growing in the intercostal nerve, are as
it were two bounding stones, which being first diligently traced, the other
threads of the Anatomical task, both on this and that side, are easily handled.
But that these infoldings may be found, the trunk of the Carotidick Artery is
laid open on both sides between the Muscles of the Neck; then by following its
tract, the aforesaid Olive bodies come into view about the insertion of the
lower Mandible; out of which, both the upper beginnings and the lower
branchings of either nerve, may be designed or drawn. But because about this
place the nerves begin to be figured otherwise in a Man than in Brutes; that
the reason of the difference may be known, we will here prosecute apart and
distinctly the Neurologie or Doctrine of the Nerves of either; and first we
shall deliver the Hypothesis of the wandering pair, and its confederations with
the intercostal and other nerves, as they are found in Man.

The Ganglioform enfolding therefore being constituted upon the Trunk of the
wandering pair, receives one Nerve sent into it elsewhere, and sends forth
another from it self. To this is brought a shoot from the intercostal nerve
different from most brute beasts, where the whole trunk of the intercostal
nerve comes, and seems to be united to the wandering pair. But from the
aforesaid enfolding, a noted branch being sent forth, is carried toward the
Larynx, which when it is divided into three shoots, the first of them is
stretched out into the Sphincter of the Throat; the second being hid under the
Scutiform or Shield-like Cartilage, distributes its shoots to the upper Muscles
of the Larynx, and to the Muscles by which the chink of the Larynx is shut up;
and the third also entering the Shield-like Cartilage, meets the top of the
returning nerve, and is united to the same. Such an inoculating of this nerve,
with the returning nerve, is constantly found in man and in all other perfect
Animals; the reason of which is delivered anon.

Below the aforesaid enfolding of the wandering pair, its stem, near the side of
the ascending Caroditick Artery, goes forward straight downwards, and in its
journey imparts some small shoots to the same, which sometimes compass about
the trunk of its Vessel, sometimes are inserted into its Coats. In the lower
part of the Neck this trunk of the wandering pair admits a branch of the
intercostal nerve from its neighboring enfolding, and in the left side about
that place sends forth another nerve from it self into the returning nerve;
which cross branch, being stretched out only in the left side, is found in man
and all brute beasts: but from thence the trunk of the wandering pair descends
without any noted branchings till it comes over against the first or second
Rib; where another enfolding being made, many shoots and numerous fibers are
sent forth toward the Heart and its Appendix. But this divarication of the
Cardiack nerves is not after the same manner altogether in either side.

For in the left side one or two noted shoots being sent forth, together with
other shoots arising from the intercostal Nerve, are inserted into the Cardiack
enfolding; but many fibers going out at the same place, are distributed to the
Vessels hanging to the Heart, and to its little Ears and Pericardium. In the
right side a noted shoot going into the greater Cardiack enfolding, another
into the less, and two other shoots from the middle enfolding of the
intercostal Trunk toward the Cardiack enfolding, associate themselves and are
united. Besides, numerous Fibers in like manner descend into the Vessels of the
Heart and the Pericardium. Also the returning Nerve in this side arising
higher, is turned back about the axillary Artery, when in the left side the
same going away much lower than this enfolding, from the Trunk of the wandering
pair, compasses about the descending Trunk of the Aorta, and from thence it is
turned back upwards.

The returning Nerve, although it seems a branch sent forth from the Trunk of
the wandering pair, being indeed a distinct and singular nerve, comes even from
the beginning of the wandering pair; yet for better conducts sake it is
contained under the same Coat with the rest of the Trunk of the wandering pair.
In either side about the knots of reflection or turning back, it sends forth
shoots and fibers which are distributed into the Vessels of the Heart. The
reflected Nerve in its ascent receives in the left side a branch from the
middle enfolding of the Intercostal, and another from the wandering pair; but
either running back, distributes many shoots to the rough Artery; then its
extremity meeting with the shoot, which is sent out of the Ganglioform
enfolding of the wandering pair, is united to it.

A little below the coming away of the returning Nerve on the left side from
the Trunk of the wandering pair, another noted branch is sent forth on both
sides; which being carried toward the Heart, covering its Basis in the hinder
Region, meets it on both sides, and disperses in all its process branches
through the whole Superficies of the Heart. As shoots go from these branches
into the hinder part of the Heart, so many branches and shoots go from the
Cardiack infoldings which are divaricated into its forepart.

But there are two Infoldings from which the Nerves are distributed into the
Heart. The upper and greater is between the Aorta and the Pneumonick Artery.
The nerves constituting this are one or two noted branches that descend hither
from either side the Trunk of the wandering pair; but chiefly many nerves from
either intercostal nerve, to wit, from the midst of its enfolding. From this
enfolding two or three noted nerves are carried under the Aorta into the left
side of the Heart. But from this enfolding, a shoot being sent forth, making as
it were an handle, compasses about the pneumonick Artery; and a branch
descending from the right Trunk of the wandering pair to the exterior part of
this handle, and another, which being carried from the nerve which is
destinated to the hinder region of the Heart, meet together and make the lesser
enfolding; from which nerves are sent into the right side of the forepart of
the Heart.

We are to take notice, That in brute Animals many more and far greater Nerves
are carried from the Trunk of the wandering pair into the Heart and its Appendix
than in Man, to wit, in whom the chief Cardiack nerves or belonging to the
Heart proceed from the intercostal pair, as is showed below; wherefore in
Brutes, for that reason, the wandering pair affords greater supplies or
subsidies to the Heart, because the intercostal nerve scarcely contributes any
to it. Further, through the whole tract of the wandering pair, from whence the
Cardiack nerves proceed, very many small shoots, being sent forth on both
sides, are inserted into the Oesophagus and the Glandula's implanted without
the Pericardium.

From the Region of the Heart, the Trunk of the wandering pair sends forth many
noted shoots on both sides, which being carried into the Lungs, are
distributed, together with the blood-carrying Vessels, through their whole
substance, and in their passage step by step they follow the Pipes of the
Bronchia, both the Arteries and the Veins, and many shoots being sent forth on
every side, they climb upon and compass about these Vessels; then the Trunk of
the same wandering pair, descending on both sides, nigh the sides of the
Trachea, distributes many shoots also into the Coats of the Oesophagus.

Below the Pneumonick branches, either Trunk of the wandering pair going
forwards downwards nigh the sides of the Oesophagus, is divided into two
branches, viz. into the exterior or more outward, and the interior or more
inward. Both the inward branches inclining toward one another mutually, do
again grow into the same Nerve, which being sent straight down toward the
Oesophagus, and being carried nigh the inward part of its Orifice, is bent back
from thence, and creeps through its upper part. From both branches, being
carried nigh the opposite parts of the superior Orifice, many shoots are
produced, which being mutually inoculated, do constitute the nervous enfolding
like a little net. The Stomachical lower branch sends forth very many fibers
and shoots nigh the left part of the bottom of the Ventricle, which are united
with others, sent forth from the Mesenterick and Splenetick enfolding. Further,
in the right part of the same bottom of the Ventricle, shoots being sent forth
from either Stomachical branch, are united with other shoots sent upwards from
the Hepatick enfolding; and about this place either Trunk of the Nerves of the
eighth pair seems to be terminated, for that the last that may be perceived of
it are some shoots sent forth from the Stomachical branches, which are
inoculated or ingraffed with the little branches or fibers sent upwards from
the Mesenterick infoldings.

CHAP. XXIV. The Actions and Uses of the Nerves of the eighth Pair, described
in the foregoing Chapter, are unfolded.
AFter this manner the beginning and branchings out of the Nerves of the eighth
pair are disposed in Man: and they are almost after the same manner in Brutes,
unless the Cardiack branches be more, because in these they go out only from
this one Conjugation. The Figure or Type of all these is well designed or drawn
in the ninth Table or Figure. It now remains, recollecting the Tracts of this
Description, or at least the things chiefly to be noted, that we inquire into
the Reasons of their Phenomenon or Appearances.

This Nerve, presently after its rise, appears with numerous Fibers, as may be
discerned in the ninth Figure E: the reason of which is, because many nerves
here arising together, and deriving plenty of animal Spirits from the same
stock or provision, ought to carry the same to diverse parts, and remote one
from another; and therefore they assume their Latex or Juice, not at one Trunk,
as the blood-carrying Vessels, and afterward distribute it equally by branches
and shoots here and there stretched out; because the Spirits, derived from the
same Fountain, have need to flow into these parts separate from them, and
variously to transpose and change their influence: wherefore for this business
it is required (that we may not suppose little doors in the middle of the
branchings out of the nerves, as are in the Pipes of a musical Organ) that the
nerves, which are destinated for the performing of diverse offices respectively
in distinct parts, should be single in their whole passage, and of themselves
distinct channels of Spirits; for the sake of a better conduct many of them are
collected together, and seem to grow together into one Trunk; but they are
parted both in their beginning, and also in their whole journey, and
distinguished, though involved in the same Coat, and so are carried to the
respective parts. Otherwise how should it come to pass, that the Spirits to be
carried for the performing the instinct of motion toward the Stomach, do not
enter at the same time the Lungs or Praecordia, and actuate them with an
inordinate influence? For indeed the shoots of the nerves of the wandering pair
may be followed by the eyes and hand backwards toward the beginning, from the
parts into which they are inserted, and where they seem to be united into the
same Trunk, so separated with the finger, that it may appear they are single.
After the same manner we have plainly separated one from another the returning
nerve also, and others, their common Coat being dissected. Yet in the mean time
we deny not, that in their progress they do communicate one with another by
Fibers meeting mutually, if it be granted, that the same, although they arise
together, in their very rise it self are in a manner distinct. For by reason of
the nearness of the beginning and progress, though all the nerves of the
wandering pair have a certain Sympathy and consent in their actions; yet for
that they consist of parted strings, they perform their actions successively,
and convey the influences of the Spirits to these parts separate from those.

We have already shown, that the Nerve of the wandering pair, and others
belonging to its family, do serve almost only to the involuntary function.
Wherefore it may be thought, that as there are many shoots and fibers, which
going out distinctly from the same origin, are carried to diverse parts, that
indeed those Bowels and Members, into which these nerves are inserted, do
perform their particular actions, stirred up either by the instinct of Nature,
or by the force of the Passions, the Animal in the mean time scarce knowing it:
yea also, that when certain other nerves, arising afar off, are joined to this
Trunk of the wandering pair, and communicate with it near the very origin of
it; this seems to be therefore done, that those nerves, an affinity with the
wandering pair being begun, may be drawn into Sympathy with it, and into an
unity of action of the involuntary Function. This appears clearly by the
accessory nerve from the Backbone, and some others, as shall be manifested
anon.

In the mean time, we shall observe concerning the Fibers of the wandering pair,
first that a noted shoot, inclining toward the vocal process of the seventh
pair, is united with the same, as in the ninth Figure e. Hence a reason may be
taken, wherefore in every violent Passion, as of Anger, Fear, Joy, and the
like, without the will or intention of the Animal, the Tongue sends forth a
voice, as an index of the excited affection; so that not only men, but some
brute beasts, in their fleeing or rejoicing, wail, cry out, and make a noise.

Secondly, From the beginning of the wandering pair very many Fibers are
distributed into the Muscles of the Neck, Figure the ninth FFF. in which there
seems little need of the stirring up of spontaneous motions in that part; for
to this task the Vertebral nerves serve sufficiently. Notwithstanding the
aforesaid Fibers of the wandering pair are the cause why the Neck is moved about
in fear, or at any noise or suspicion of danger; and also, why in some Animals,
from indignation or pride, the Muscles into which these nerves are inserted,
being inflated very much, their necks swell up, and the Crests of many are
erected. Of how great use the accessory nerve, coming from the Spine to the
wandering pair, is for the pathetick motions of the Arms, shall be showed
presently.

Thirdly, The other Fibers of the wandering pair, being gathered together, seem
to grow together into the same Trunk, which presently constitutes the
Ganglioform enfolding from a shoot coming from the intercostal nerve, as in
Figure the ninth G.H. And indeed it is very likely, that of these Fibers, which
are complicated together in the Trunk of the wandering pair, one is destinated
to the returning nerve, another to the Praecordia, a third to the Lungs, and
lastly, another to the Ventricle; all which, although they have communication
among themselves, and for the sake of a better conduct are gathered together in
one, yet they are still distinct from their very original, and constitute
diverse passages of the animal Spirits.

But that a shoot is carried from the intercostal Nerve into the upper
enfolding of the wandering pair, as in the ninth Figure h; the reason is, that
between these nerves a certain strict affinity and kindred might be, and that
either of them might be affected with the others offices. For as the nerve of
the wandering pair distributes shoots chiefly to the Praecordia, and the
Stomach, and the intercostal Nerve to the rest of the Viscera of the lower
Belly; we may observe, that between all these there are not only some
commerces, but Sympathies, and a consent of Actions and Passions; wherefore
there is a necessity, that the nerves designed to either parts, should
communicate among themselves. Further, in Man the intercostal nerve imparts to
the Heart and its Appendix more shoots and fibers than the nerve of the
wandering pair: wherefore these nerves do not only communicate by these
superior infoldings, but also again a little lower by a shoot sent out from
the cervical enfolding, or that of the Neck.

From the aforesaid enfolding a noted branch of the wandering pair is sent forth
into the Muscles of the Larynx, a certain branch of which, entering the
Shield-like Cartilage, meets with the returning nerve, and is united to it Fig.
9. h. It will not be difficult to collect what the use of this nerve may be;
for seeing the Larynx or the rough Artery serves both for the drawning in and
putting out of the breath, and also for the modulating the voice; for either
office that its Trunk, like the folds in a pair of Bellows, may become
sometimes more short, sometimes more at length, these same ringy Cartilages
ought to be pulled together, or contracted sometimes upward, and sometimes
downward. That a flat voice or sound might be formed, they ought to be pressed
down as much as may be to the bottom; but if you would form a more shrill or
sharp sound or voice, the superior Rings are lifted up; to wit, that the sound
might be broken but only in the very passage of the Jaws. For the performing of
this double motion of the Larynx two nerves are constituted like the hands of a
Piper, one of which stops the lower holes, the other the upper of the Pipe: to
wit, the shoots and branches of the returning nerve being lifted up from below,
move the ringy Cartilages downwards; and the nerve sent out from above from
this enfolding, presently draws the more superior upwards. Further, because a
certain consent and joint action is required in both nerves, therefore they are
mutually inoculated or ingraffed: yea, whenas either of them returning,
distributes frequent shoots into either side of the Trachea; it seems that
those that are sent out into the right part, move its Rings downwards for
Inspiration and a strong Voice; and the others, going out on both sides into
the left part, carry the Rings upward for Expiration and for an acute or sharp
Voice. Moreover, as the instinct for the motion of depression or pressing down
is delivered from the knots of the recourse or reflections; so the impression,
for the elation or lifting up of those parts, is received from this nerve of
the Ganglioform enfolding.

A noted branch from the middle enfolding of the intercostal Nerve is carried
into the Trunk of the wandering pair, Fig. 9. i. For what end that is so, we
have shown already; to wit, that the commerces of the Spirits dwelling in both
nerves, might be strengthened: but it should be noted, that it is only so in
the left side where the Trunk of the wandering pair shows it self single for a
long space; but in the right side, where the returning nerve goes from it much
higher, here the other nerve from the intercostal enfolding is plainly wanting.

About the Region of the first or second Rib, another noted enfolding appears
in the Trunk of the wandering pair, from which many shoots and fibers are sent
toward the Heart and its Appendix, Fig. 9. k. Further, in brute Animals, about
this place, the intercostal nerve leaves the Trunk of the wandering pair.
Without doubt, some animal Spirits go apart in this enfolding, which are
destinated to the anterior region of the Heart, also to the Pericardium and
some of its Vessels, whilst other Spirits pass through, which a little lower
are derived into the hinder region of the Heart; and which being yet carried
further, go to the Lungs, and lastly to the Ventricle.

We may observe, that from the aforesaid enfolding of the wandering pair
numerous shoots and fibers are sent forth, which are distributed into the
little ears of the Heart and all the sanguiferous Vessels belonging to the
Heart, Fig. 9. l. m. which fibers and nervous shoots creeping along like Ivy,
thickly cover over the Coats of the Vessels, and enter them in very many
places, and variously bind them about. Truly this copious distribution of the
nerves does effect the pulsifick force in the little ears of the Heart and in
the Arteries, or at least seems to excite it; and so to erect and strengthen
those parts by a continual influx of the animal Spirits through these nerves,
that they may be able to sustain an undiscontinued reciprocation of Systole and
Diastole. Moreover, that the thick fibers and shoots of the nerves are inserted
both into the Veins and Arteries, and bind both those kind of Vessels, and
variously compass them about, we may lawfully suppose, that these nerves, as it
were Reins put upon these blood-carrying Vessels, do sometimes dilate, and
sometimes bind them hard together for the determining the motion of the Blood
according to the various force of the Passions* or to deduce it here and there
after a manifold manner; for by this means it comes to pass, that in fear the
excursion of the blood is hindered, and in other Affections its motion is
respectively altered.

But that many shoots and branches are inserted into the Pericardium, it seems
to be for this use; to wit, that that little Chest which is made like a Fort
for the defending the Heart from injuries, as often as any troublesome matter
assaults or besieges it, might be able to draw it self together, and to shake
off the enemy. For it seems, that the inordinate tremblings and shakings of the
Heart, which are manifestly different from its natural Pulse, proceed from the
violent shaking of this Membrane.

As to the Cardiack branches sent from this enfolding we observe, that they,
because destinated to a public office, do therefore communicate and enter into
the pairs of either side before they are inserted into the Heart; for which end
the enfolding is made before the Basis of the Heart, where the aforesaid
shoots, from the wandering pair and many others, going out from either
intercostal nerve, meet together. From that enfolding, placed between the Aorta
and the pneumonick Artery, very many branches being sent forth above, cover
over the Hemiphere of the Heart: but yet from these certain branches, carried
under the Aorta, are brought into the left side of the said Hemisphere; and as
other pairs tend toward the right side, one of the first of them, making a
little handle, binds about the pneumonick Artery; then meeting with other
Cardiack shoots, makes the lesser enfolding, out of which branches are sent
forth into the right and anterior side of the Heart. That from the greater
Cardiack enfolding, nerves departing one from another, do institute contrary
journies toward the Heart, it is indeed, that they might come to diverse
regions of the Heart without meeting one another, and might affect its Vessels
respectively in their passage; to wit, the branches carried this way, insert
their shoots into the Aorta, and from the others going that way, one compasses
about the pneumonick Artery. The reason of both seems to be, that the blood
might be either sooner or slower drawn from the bosoms of the Heart for its
various need or necessity. For whilst the aforesaid nerves do both sustain its
motion by their influx, and also moderate and temper it by their instinct, it
so comes to pass from thence, that those Vessels also, being affected by the
same nerves, do further compose themselves to the requisite Analogies and
proportions of the Pulses.

Indeed there are many Nerves, and those conspicuous enough, which are inserted
into the Heart, and cover its outward substance with shoots sent forth from all
sides; yet it is not to be thought, that these nerves alone perform and sustain
the undiscontinued motion of the Heart: because so small little ropes seem too
unequal for the perpetual agitation of such a Machine. Yea it may be observed,
that more shoots and fibers of nerves are distributed into the little ears of
the Heart and the depending Vessels, than into its frame or substance. Further,
it is obvious to any that will behold it, that there is a greater plenty of
nerves destinated to the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, Ventricle, or Reins, than to the
Heart it self; so that some Anatomists (as Fallopius says) were doubtful,
whether there were any nerves that belonged to the Heart or not. But this being
clear enough, that we may describe the motive power of this Clock or Machine
stirred up by the help of some small nerves, as it were an explosive motion, we
say that the substance of the Heart it self consists of a very fibrous flesh,
and may rather be called a Muscle than Parenchyma or congealed substance:
wherefore in this, as in other Muscles, the implanted and proper fibers cause
the local motion and constant shaking; but by the inserted nerves is only
conveyed the instinct of the motion or action; for the performing of which
office, both fewer Nerves and fewer animal Spirits flowing in through their
passages, do suffice. But indeed we suppose, that the animal Spirits implanted
in the Heart, and abiding within its Fibers, did at first flow thither through
the nerves, and that by this way their expenses or loss are made up or
supplied; yet that the animal Spirits, which seem to be dispensed to the Heart
by so sparing an hand, may suffice for the actuating this perpetual motion,
they receive continually subsidiary Forces from the arterious blood. For
elsewhere we have showed, that in the Heart, as in the whole musculous stock
besides, a sulphurous Copula, from the suggested blood, is joined to the
spirituous saline Particles of the implanted Spirits; which matter, whilst the
Spirits are agitated, being at length struck off, and as it were exploded (just
like the rarefied and inkindled Particles of Gunpowder) for the effecting the
motive endeavor, do blow up or intumifie the Muscle or the Heart it self; and
so from the indiscontinued action of the Heart much of this sulphurous Copula,
which is easily supplied from the blood, and less of the Spirits, which are
brought by the passage of the nerves, is bestowed.

And here it may be rightly inquired into, whether the Pulse of the Heart so
necessarily depends on the influence of the animal Spirits through the Nerves,
that it being hindered, the action of the Heart should wholly cease? For the
decision of this, we once made a trial of the following Experiment upon a
living Dog. The skin about the Throat being cut long-ways, and the Trunk of
both the wandering pair being separated apart, we made a very strict Ligature;
which being done, the Dog was presently silent, and seemed stunned, and
suffered about the Hypochondria convulsive motions, with a great trembling of
the Heart. But this affection quickly ceasing, afterward he lay without any
strength or lively aspect, as if dying, slow and impotent to any motion, and
vomiting up any food that was given him: nevertheless his life as yet
continued, neither was it presently extinguished after those nerves were wholly
cut asunder; but this Animal lived for many days, and so long, till through
long fasting, his strength and spirits being worn out, he died. The carcass
being opened, the blood within the Ventricles of the Heart, and the Vessels on
every side reaching from thence, to wit, both the Veins and Arteries, being
greatly coagulated* was gathered into clotters; to wit, for this cause, because
the blood, though for the sustaining of life, it was in some measure
circulated, yet for the most part it stagnated both in the Heart, and in the
Vessels. The cause of which stagnation I can assign to no other thing, than
that the Praecordia, the influence of the animal Spirits being hindered, wanted
its usual motions.

If it should be further demanded, from whence the animal Spirits (the passage
of both the wandering pair being shut up) should be supplied to the Heart
continuing still its motion; I say, that this may be done by the returning
Nerves, as from the knots of which many Cardiack shoots and fibers proceed; and
besides, the end of either nerve meeting with the nerve sent from the upper
enfolding, is united. But we showed already, that the animal Spirits may be
carried either this way or that way within the passages of the nerves;
wherefore when the necessity of life urges, the provision of the Spirits,
though lesser, being sent from the aforesaid enfolding, is received by the tail
of the returning nerve, and from thence by a retrograde passage it was derived
into the Cardiack branches, and at length into the Heart it self. Further,
there lies open also another passage, and that perhaps more obvious, through
the passage of the intercostal nerve: by this way in a man, as well as by the
passage of the wandering pair, the Spirits are conveyed from the Brain to the
Praecordia; yea also in Brutes a branch is carried into the Trunk of the
wandering pair from the intercostal enfolding; so that by this by-path some
little rills of the animal Spirits (if by chance their influence should be
hindered through their wonted channels) might be carried to the Heart. However
that Experiment seems to conclude, that the motion of the Heart depends no less
upon the inflowing of the blood, than upon that of the animal Spirit: the total
privation of either takes away life; an Eclipse of the Spirits wholly takes
away from the Heart its motive power; and by the defect of the blood (forasmuch
as the sulphurous Copula is denied to the Spirit implanted in the Heart) the
vigor and elastick force of the Heart is suppressed, so that the Pulse being by
degrees weakened, life is by little and little extinguished. Without doubt, in
the finding out the tenor of the Pulse, we ought always to mind what the
alteration of the animal Spirits, and what the fault of the blood may bring to
it.

There is yet another consideration concerning the Nerves reaching from the
Trunk of the wandering pair to the Heart, to wit, that by their passage, not
only the solemn influence and state of the Spirits, for the equally performing
of the vital Function, is conveyed; but also the instinct of every irregular
motion, stirred up in the Praecordia by the force of the Passions, is in some
measure transferred this way. I say, as to these, we ought to discourse and to
show by what means, as often as the impression of any Affection exercises the
Imagination, or rather the Appetite, presently the Praecordia are disturbed by
the passage of the Nerves, and by reason of their various Affections the motion
of the blood is diversely altered. But because in a man the irregular and
extraordinary motions of the Praecordia depend on the intercostal Nerve as much
as and perhaps more than on the wandering pair; therefore we think good to defer
this Speculation till the Theory of that Nerve is proposed. In the mean time,
we will proceed to the other branches of the wandering pair; and what next
follows, we will inquire into the offices and uses of the returning Nerves.

The returning Nerve in the left side, going away from the wandering pair below
the aforesaid enfolding, and sent toward the Aorta, is reflected or turned
back about its descending Trunk, from whence being carried upwards, it imparts
shoots to the Muscles of the Trachea and the Larynx sent forth by a long tract
from either side of the Nerve; then its top or height is united with a shoot
meeting it out of the Ganglioform enfolding, Fig. 9. n. **** h. But the
returning Nerve on the right side is reflected much higher about the axillar
Artery, to wit, proceeding from the lower enfolding of the wandering pair, and
after the same manner is bestowed on the other side of the Trachea, Fig. 9. L.
But either returning back about the knots of reflection, sends forth toward
the Heart very many shoots and fibers, which are inserted into its little ears,
the appending Vessels or its Infoldings.

What the chief use of this Nerve is, we have already shown; to wit, being
rolled about on both sides the Artery, as it were a Windlace, it causes the
little rings of the Trachea or Weasand to be drawn hither and thither, like the
folds of a pair of Bellows, both for breathing and making a sound. But indeed
either Nerve, forasmuch as it being reflected about the Artery, is carried
upward into the part to be moved, does move downwards the little rings of the
Trachea or Windpipe by certain shoots of it; also forasmuch as either is
terminated in the Nerve, sent from the Ganglioform enfolding, it carries
upwards the folds of the Trachea by other shoots of it. Hence a reason may be
given, why the returning Nerves being cut off, every Animal is presently dumb;
to wit, because, unless the Trachea be moved, the breath being blown out,
passing without any refraction through its cavity, as it were through a Pipe
alike hollow in its whole passage, gives no sound.

Concerning these Nerves we ought to inquire, what is the reason of the
difference, that the knots of reflection are not alike on both sides; also for
what end the Cardiack branches proceed from both knots. As to the first, that
the left returning Nerve, not as its pair, binds about the axillary Artery,
some reason seems to be, because the left axillary Artery, arising below, is
carried as the right, by a bending, and not a straight passage, into the Arm;
wherefore the little cord of the Nerve, compassing about its Trunk, has no
fixed, but a very moveable knot of reflection, for that it might easily slide
from its place. But it may rather be said, that it is for other uses, and those
more necessary, that these Nerves compass about those Vessels after that
manner. For when they, as it were Reins or Bridles cast on the blood-carrying
Vessels, by pulling them hither and thither, variously determine the course of
the blood, it seems to be required, that one returning Nerve should bind
together or constringe the axillary Artery, and the other the descending Trunk
of the Aorta: for as often as there is need for the blood to flow forwards
toward the Head more plentifully, the returning Nerves perform it easily, by
pulling upwards the aforesaid Arteries: But the blood, after a sort, ought to
be continually urged into the higher parts, lest otherwise by its weight it
should turn too much downwards; wherefore in all Expiration or breathing forth,
when the Trachea, drawing nearer together its folds, is contracted upwards, the
blood about to descend through the Aorta, is snatched upwards by one tract of
the nervous little cord, and in like manner, the axillary Artery in the right
side being shaken with it, the blood flowing in the whole ascending Trunk of
the Aorta, is driven upwards a little swifter.

But besides this continual and equal snatching up of the blood toward the
upper parts, it is sometimes occasionally urged toward the Head by a more
intense and quick motion of the Trachea, and also by a more full and swift
course. For as often as any Animal grows angry, the voice presently shows signs
of such an Affection, and oftentimes by chiding, they make it sharp; as men,
when they are angry, chide or brawl, and Dogs bark: Now from such an intension
of the voice and chiding, as the upper rings of the Trachea, a reciprocation
being there made, are often struck together; so the blood also (the Aorta being
strongly drawn) is urged upwards by a copious afflux, so that it presently dies
the countenance and eyes of angry people with a redness, and induces to the
Brain it self a greater heat and provocatives to anger, and a greater glowing
or infiring to the Spirits by stirring them up. For the same reason, in Joy and
Gladness, forasmuch as the Trachea is exercised by singing or laughing, the
blood also is poured out more plentifully toward the exterior, and especially
the upper parts.

And from hence the cause is plain, wherefore either returning Nerve sends
forth Cardiack branches from the knot of reflection or turning back; to wit,
that in those kind of affections, the notice of which the Trachea in sounds or
voices gives by the help of the Nerves, the Heart it self by its means also
might be affected. For so, as often as we wrangle or brawl, the Heart being
irritated, presently inkindles the blood more, and drives it forward more
plentifully, as food for those Affections, toward the Brain. Also in laughter,
great rejoicing, or singing, by the passage of those Nerves, the Heart being
brought into a consent or Sympathy, or joint action, presently explodes or
drives out the blood by a swifter pulse, and casts it hastily out, which
otherwise would be heavy and troublesome by a slower motion or stagnation;
wherefore those sort of actions, to wit, laughing and singing, are said to
alleviate the Heart, because they make the blood more freely and readily to be
poured out of the bosoms of the Heart, and also, by the supplying help of the
Lungs, to be emptied into the same.

Below the production of the left returning Nerve another noted Nerve is
carried toward the hindermost region of the Heart, which being carried with a
certain compass about its Basis, sends forth frequent shoots, which cover the
left side of the hinder Hemisphere, Fig. 9. o. Then this branch meeting with
another pair sent from the opposite side toward the Heart, and distributing
shoots into the right side of the hinder Hemisphere, is united with it, Fig. 9.
q.

This Cardiack branch, destinated to the hinder region of the Heart, is
produced apart below the rest, that it might be carried by it self to its
Province without the meeting with or implication of others; the pairs are
ingraffed on either side, that they might accompany one another, and be
together drawn in the same action of the Heart. It appears not plain, whether
these nerves conspire with the other Cardiack nerves, arising above, reaching
forth to the anterior Hemisphere of the Heart; or whether this pair effect not
the Systole of the Heart, and the upper its Diastole. However it is, certain
shoots of the kindred or stock of either, being ingraffed with others of
another stock, communicate one with the other.

The Trunk of the wandering pair sends forth on both sides very many noted
branches from the region of the Heart, which are spread on every side into all
the Lobes of the Lungs, the Bronchia of the Trachea, and the Coat of the
Oesophagus hard by descending, Fig. 9. s.s.s. Those which go into the Lungs
pass every where through their whole substance, following the ramifications of
the Veins and Arteries, and the Pipes of the Bronchia, which channels of blood
and air they variously climb over, and bind about through their whole tract.

When that so many noted branchings of the Nerves are bestowed on the Lungs, it
is a wonder, that by some they should be thought to be insensible and
immovable of themselves. Yea it is doubted by many, whether these Bowels do
cause the motions of the Systole and Diastole of themselves by their own
endeavor. For that it is a received Opinion, That this reciprocation of the
Lungs does proceed wholly from the motion of the Thorax, and does obey or
observe its dilatation or constriction with a certain necessary dependency;
viz. that the Breast being dilated or spread open after the manner of a pair of
Bellows does compel the ambient Air into the Trachea, which rushing into the
Lungs, blows up and distends them; then the same Breast subsiding or sinking of
it self, that the Lungs being pressed together with the weight of it, do breath
forth the Air before intruded. In truth, however that I might judge, that the
Diaphragma and the Muscles of the Breast do conduce much to Respiration; yet
that these parts should perform this office alone, and that the Lungs are
merely passive, I cannot grant. For Respiration is chiefly instituted for the
sake of the blood and the Heart, and its act is wont to be determined according
to the various disposition of these, and to be altered every minute of an hour
almost according to the manifold necessity of the Pulse. But indeed the Lungs
themselves are they (and not the Diaphragma or the Muscles of the Thorax) which
the blood, boiling out of the Heart, passes through, and continually affects
according to its temper, and the tenor of the Pulse: wherefore from hence it
may be concluded, That the Lungs themselves do conceive the first instincts of
their motions, and by the help of the aforesaid Nerves, do in some measure
exercise themselves, and endeavor the Systole and Diastole, and design them
according to the sense of its proper necessity; but when in these, Fibers
requisite for local motion are wanting, therefore the Diaphragma and the
Muscles of the Thorax help continually the endeavors of the Lungs, and by the
cooperation of these, complete breathing is effected. And so when Nerves of a
twofold kind, to wit, some from the Spine being inserted into the Muscles of
the Diaphragma and the Thorax, and others from the wandering pair distributed
into the Lungs, actuate the Organs of Respiration; for that reason it comes to
pass, that the act it self of Respiration, of it self unforced and involuntary,
may be at our pleasure somewhat restrained, interrupted, and diversely altered.
The Sympraxis or joint action of the Nerves of either kind, in the work of
Respiration, shall be showed hereafter, when we shall speak particularly of the
Nerve of the Diaphragma.

It yet appears more plain, that the Lungs are oftentimes the chief in the act
of Respiration, because they being irritated from strange and improportionate
objects, presently conceive irregular and violent motions; as when a vehement
Cough is stirred up for the exclusion of any troublesome thing; to which motion
the Diaphragma and the Muscles of the Thorax presently obey. In like manner, in
difficult and sighing breathing, or any other ways unequal, its first instinct
for the most part is begun by the Lungs; yet sometimes when the exterior Organs
of Respiration are excited into irregular motions, the Lungs also are compelled
to follow their irregularities; so when the Diaphragma after a manner begins
laughter, the Lungs perform the same with a following cackling sound: so all
the Organs of Respiration intimately conspire and agree among themselves, that
although one of them do a thing inordinately, rather than there shall be a
Schism, the rest do imitate or follow its irregularity.

But that the Nerves, following the Arteries and Veins through the whole frame
of the Lungs, do variously bind about and cloth their Trunks with a thick
series of shoots, the reason seems to be, both that the Coats of the Vessels
being gifted with a constant influx of animal Spirits, might imitate the motion
of the Heart; and by that means, by a continual pulsation of the Arteries and
the constriction of the Veins, they might easily carry the blood in this its
more short lustration through the Lungs; and the rather, that the pneumonick
Vessels, being bound about with such Reins of Nerves, might moderate the course
of the blood according to the forces and instincts of the Passions. For whenas
the exterior circulation of the blood depends upon this interior; as the blood
is commanded to pass sooner or slower through the Lungs, or to stay there and
be hindered, the excursion and return of it also from or toward the Heart is
wholly performed. In Joy or Anger, because the Lungs rapidly transfer the blood
out of one bosom of the Heart to the other; therefore its swifter and more
plentiful flowing out into the outward parts, follows. In like manner, in Fear
and Sadness, for that the Lungs (its Vessels being strained together) deliver
the blood to the Heart by the Veins, and do not then presently carry it back by
the Arteries, the outmost region of the Body is destitute of its due influx.
Notwithstanding these kind of pathetick snatches of the blood are in some
measure performed, because its Vessels are bound about in other places in like
manner with the Nerves. If at any time Spasmodick Affections should afflict the
pneumonick Nerves from a morbific cause, so that being twitcht with inordinate
motions, they should pull or draw together here and there the Arteries and
Veins which they embrace; for that cause, the blood either too much flowing out
of the Lungs, makes them to flag, and to fall together into themselves, so that
drawing to them copiously the Air, they do not easily render it back again; or,
which frequently happens, the blood being detained within the Lungs, and there
stagnating, stuffs them up, and holds them a long while stiff, that they cannot
inspire or drawn in the Air. The Symptoms of either kind ordinarily happen in
the Hysteric distempers, and in some Hypochondriacal. Yea sometimes the
Bronchia themselves are pulled together by the like Convulsion of the Nerves,
and are hindered in their motion, so that they cannot take in and send forth the
Air after its due manner, as may be seen in Asthmatical Fits. The distempers of
which sort are oftentimes produced by the fault of the Nerves, without any
implanted Dyscrasie or evil disposition of the Lungs. I have sometimes observed
some Cases of sick people, in which, when at one time the morbifick matter
besieging the Brain, had induced Lethargick or Vertiginous Symptoms, a little
after the same matter occupying or possessing the origines or middle processes
of the nerves belonging to the Lungs, has suddenly excited a most horrid Asthma
without any previous Cough or Catarrh.

But that out of the same tract of the wandering pair many shoots are
distributed into the Lungs, and also many others into the Coats of the
Oesophagus; from hence a reason may be given, why a troublesome Cough oftentimes
causes Vomiting and a subversion of the Ventricle; why also on the other side a
perturbation of the Ventricle so frequently induces a troublesome endeavor of
Coughing. I have known in Hypochondriacks, that aliments of ill digestion,
taken into the Stomach, have presently excited a vain and very pertinacious
Cough; in the mean time, that the Lungs were free from any consumptive
disposition. The cause of either distemper seems to be, that when the nerves,
disseminated in either part, are taken with a Convulsion, oftentimes those
which are of the other part, are drawn into a consent of the same distemper.
Perhaps from hence it happens, that sometimes an Asthma is induced by reason of
the evil of the Ventricle, and that that distemper (as Riverius observes) is
often wont to be cured by an emetick Medicine.

After so many branches and shoots have been sent from both sides the wandering
pair, at length its Trunk is divided below the Lungs into two branches, viz.
the exterior and interior; either of which inclining toward the pair of
branches on the other side, are united to them, and after a mutual
communication they constitute the two Stomachical branches, viz. the superior
and the inferior, Fig. 9. t. u. w. x.

It is worth observing, with what wonderful artifice either Trunk of the
wandering pair do communicate one with the other with two branches, as it were
two hands meeting one the other, that the influence of either nerve might
equally reach to every region and part of the Stomach. For whenas either
Stomachical branch, to wit, both the upper and the lower, is carried together
from the two branches coming out from either side of the wandering pair; it is
provided, that the Tributes of the Spirits destinated to the Ventricle, should
be at once certain and very plentiful. For what appertains to the performing
the action of this Bowel or Chylification, the Spirits flowing in from either
side, are abundantly distributed into the Orifice, and from thence into all its
parts and private places; and by that means it comes to pass, that the Stomach
dissolves bodies beyond the force of any Chemical Menstruum. Then besides, as
to the feeling or sense of the Ventricle, or the affection of it from things
ingested; it is carried also toward the Head by a double way (whereby the
passage may be the more certain) to wit, by either Trunk of the wandering pair;
that for that reason being endued with a most exquisite sense, it might not be
deceived concerning its objects; and if that any thing inimical or contrary to
it, should lie hid among what is eaten, it might discern it and thrust it out
of its own accord, or at least by the knowledge only of the Cerebel.

That from the same double Trunk of the wandering pair, from whence the Cardiack
Nerves arise a little above, the Stomachical branches also proceed, the cause
is plain wherefore the Heart it self has such a Sympathy with the Stomach, so
that its Deliquium or Swooning follows upon any great pulling or hawling of
this.

Either Nerve of the wandering pair is terminated in the Ventricle it self: for
after the eighth Conjugation has made as it were an high road for the passage
of the animal Spirits to the Praecordia and to this noble Bowel, it puts a
bound to it self; nor indeed does it seem meet to have its branches stretched
out any further to the Viscera of the lower Belly: because it seems an unworthy
thing, that the same path which leads to the chief office of nutrition and to
the Palaces of life it self, should lie open to the more vile Intestines also,
and the sink of the whole Body. And truly, although the ample path and broad
way of the wandering pair is not produced beyond the Ventricle, yet because a
frequent commerce happens between this and the Praecordia and the other
inferior parts; therefore between the Stomach and the other Bowels, though of a
more base use, certain Fibers, as it were smaller paths, are reached forth, in
which, at least little bands of Spirits, like Discoverers or Messengers, run to
and fro.

CHAP. XXV. A Description of the Intercostal Nerve.
AFter the unfolding of the Nerve reaching forth to the Praecordia and the
Ventricle, we are led by the series or order of the inward parts to the
describing a Nerve akin to this, and which reaches forth its branches to the
furthermost Province, to wit, to all the Viscera or Inwards of the lower Belly
contained below the Ventricle. This is commonly called the Intercostal, because
that going near the roots of the Ribs, it receives in every one of their
Interstices a branch from the spinal Marrow. Its beginning is not yet
sufficiently detected; for by most Anatomists it is wrongfully taken for a
branch of the wandering pair, though indeed the wandering and the intercostal
pair do communicate among themselves by branches sent forth one to the other;
yet as to both their beginnings, Trunks and wanderings up and down, they are
plainly distinguished. If that this latter Conjugation, being denied the title
of a peculiar nerve, ought to confess it self of another stock, certainly it
owes nothing to the wandering pair, but should borrow its original from the
Nerves of the fifth and sixth pairs; for two or three shoots being sent back
from those nerves going out toward the Eyes and Face, go into the same stock
or Trunk, which is the Trunk of the intercostal nerve, as we have intimated
before.

The intercostal Nerve being constituted after that manner, and going out of
the Skull at a proper hole, presently contains the Ganglioform enfolding, near
to another the like enfolding of the wandering pair; into which two nervous
Processes are carried from the last pair within the Skull, or the first
Vertebral. From that enfolding one shoot is sent forth into the Sphincter of
the Throat, and another noted one into the Ganglioform enfolding of the
wandering pair. Then this nerve descending toward the Vertebrae, has in the
middle of the Neck another far greater enfolding, into which an ample nerve,
from the neighboring Vertebral pair, is inserted; but from the same many
nerves, which respect the Praecordia, are distributed on every side: For two or
three shoots are sent forth into the nerve of the Diaphragma, and one shoot
into the returning nerve; besides, numerous fibers and shoots are carried both
into the returning nerve, and toward the Trachea, which are inserted into its
Coats, and into those of the Oesophagus, and into the blood-carrying Vessels.
Further, one branch descends into the Trunk of the wandering pair, and two noted
nerves into the Cardiack enfolding; then a little lower another nerve by it
self, proceeding out of the intercostal Trunk, is inserted also into the
Cardiack enfolding: which noted branches sent down on both sides from the
intercostal nerve, for that they join together with others derived from either
Trunk of the wandering pair, make the Cardiack enfolding it self. But these
Cardiack branches from the intercostal nerve, as also the Cervical enfolding,
or that in the hinder part of the Neck, whence they proceed, are peculiar to
men, and are wholly wanting in brute beasts.

The intercostal Trunk descends from the cervical enfolding toward the
chanel-bone, where being about to enter the cavity of the Breast, it falls upon
the axillary Artery, as it were in right Angles, and strains or binds it; from
whence it is drowned or hidden in the Thorax near the roots of the first and
second Ribs; and there receiving three or four branches from the Vertebral
nerves next to those uppermost, constitutes another enfolding, which is
commonly called the Intercostal enfolding. The uppermost of these Vertebral
nerves coming to this enfolding in its journey binds the Vertebral Artery, and
almost compasses it about. In Brutes by this nerve which comes upon the
Vertebral Artery, the intercostal enfolding communicates with the root of the
nerve of the Diaphragma, and not by any other means, unless by small fibers
sent forth from the lower part of the enfolding into the Vertebral nerves.
Further, in Brutes a noted branch is carried from this enfolding into the Trunk
of the wandering pair. But in Man the intercostal Trunk passes through the
cavity of the Thorax without any communication had with the other parts; unless
that from hence in its whole descent, running near the roots of the Ribs, it
admits in every one of their interspaces, and from thence even to the Os sacrum
from between the knots of the Vertebrae, a Vertebral branch.

The intercostal pair sends forth a noted branch on either side, where having
gone through the cavity of the Thorax or Breast, it comes over against the
bottom of the Ventricle, which tending toward the Mesentery, constitutes the
chief infoldings of it. But there are seven Mesenterick infoldings, viz. five
great superior, and two less inferior: out of all which, numerous shoots and
fibers are sent forth together into the parts which they respect, and into the
neighboring infoldings. The Mesenterick nerves, which are carried into these
infoldings, and the infoldings themselves, and also the fibers and shoots,
which flow out from them on every side, like rays of light, are disposed
according to the following manner both in Man and in the more perfect Brutes.

The Mesenterick branch therefore in the left side going from the intercostal
Nerve, and bending downwards, is parted into two noted shoots: the greater of
these bending back upwards toward the Stomach, diffuseth it self presently
into an enfolding, as a narrow rivulet into a spacious Pool. From this
enfolding numerous fibers and shoots go forth as it were in four bands. The
first of these, and which is the greatest bundle of its fibers, being carried
into the Ventricle, is bestowed partly in the bottom of it, and partly these
fibers are met, and ingraffed with others sent from the-Stomachical branch. The
other maniple or band of nervous Fibers goes forth from this enfolding to the
Spleen, where the nerves accompanying the sanguiferous Vessels, and variously
binding them about, are dispersed into the more inward frame or substance of
the Spleen; yet out of which going toward the Spleen, some shoots following
the short Vessels, are carried into the Stomach. The third Company of nervous
Fibers is inserted between this enfolding and the Hepatick or that belonging to
the Liver, placed in the right side over against it. Lastly, the fourth
Conjugation of Fibers knits together this and the greatest enfolding of the
Mesentery lying under it.

The lower shoot of the Mesenterick branch, which is on the left side,
increases into an enfolding, to which the next Vertebral branch, destinated to
the intercostal Nerve, is carried. From this enfolding the chief bundle of
nervous Fibers is carried into the left Kidney, and before the Fibers enter the
Reins, they bind and variously compass about the emulgent Vessels. Further,
between this enfolding and the greatest of the Mesentery many Fibers are
stretched out; from hence also many shoots are distributed into the atrabilary
Chest, or the Receptacle of the Spleens excrements.

In the right side the Mesenterick branch being sent from the intercostal
Trunk, and being in like manner twofold, contains in its upper shoot the
Hepatick enfolding; out of which the greatest bundle of nervous Fibers is
carried toward the Liver; numerous shoots of which accompanying the
blood-carrying Vessels, greatly beset, and as it were cloth with a little net
the Trunk of the Hepatick Artery: which fibers and shoots, being carried
higher, are distributed into the Liver, the Gall-chest or bag, the passage of
the Gall, the Pylorus, and the Pancreas. Further, many Fibers, which are of
this Conjugation, meet with Fibers sent from either Stomachical nerve, and are
ingraffed into them. Another handful of nervous Fibers is stretched out between
this enfolding and the opposite enfolding belonging to the Spleen, and another
between this and the greatest enfolding of the Mesentery; yea, there is some
communication had between this and that belonging to the Kidney lying under the
same side by a large shoot sent down.

The lower shoot of the right Mesenterick branch, like as it is in the opposite
side, contains a sufficiently noted enfolding nigh the atrabilary Chest; to
which presently the intercostal Nerve imparts its Vertebral branch received
below. From this enfolding the chief bundle of nervous Fibers destinated to the
Reins, embraces the blood-carrying Vessels in like manner as in the opposite
side; also many fibers and shoots are stretched out from this enfolding to
those near, viz. the Hepatick and the greatest of the Mesentery; yea, certain
Fibers are dispersed from the same into the atrabilary Chest.

After this manner either Mesenterick branch being carried from the Intercostal
pair, and being presently twofold, immediately constitutes two infoldings in
either side. In the midst of these the greatest enfolding of all stands like
the Sun in the midst of the Planets; from which numerous shoots and fibers are
dispersed into all the parts of the Mesentery; which indeed following the
blood-carrying Vessels in their whole process, climb over and bind about the
same. Moreover, between this enfolding and every one of the four aforesaid is
produced a peculiar little bundle of Fibers. Besides, in the female Sex, from
hence some shoots are carried into the Glandula's of the Womb, commonly called
the Stones. But from the Mesenterick branches, which constitute the former
infoldings, no noted branches, but only little shoots, are sent into this
enfolding. Yea the chief Nerve which is inserted to this, and seems to be the
primary for the conveying of plenty of Spirits into it, and a broad way, is
carried from a certain small enfolding far lower nigh the straight Intestine;
which enfolding, together with the other neighboring one, that we call the
lesser infoldings of the Mesentery, shall be described presently. In the mean
time, that we may proceed to them in order, we will follow the passage of the
intercostal Nerve.

Below the Mesenterick branches, from which the aforesaid superior infoldings
are constituted, the intercostal Trunk descends between the Muscles of the
Loins, and bestows every Vertebral branch, admitted in its descent, upon some
internal parts.

For the Vertebral branch brought to the intercostal Trunk nigh both Kidneys,
is carried into the Women's Testicles, then some following into the Ureters.
From the Region of the twenty seventh Vertebra one Vertebral branch and two
others, going from the intercostal Trunk, tend toward the straight Intestine,
and there they meet with three pairs sent from the other side; all which being
united, constitute the enfolding, which is the lowest of the Abdomen. From this
enfolding a noted Nerve, being carried upwards, is brought into the greatest
enfolding of the Mesentery, which in its journey receives one and then another
shoot sent down on both sides from the intercostal Nerve; and there, near its
bounds, distributes some shoots into the Glandula's of the Womb.

But from the lowest aforesaid Enfolding, a Nerve going toward the upper
Infoldings, about the space of an inch, constitutes another lesser enfolding in
the neighborhood; out of which one Nerve tends upwards, and another opposite
straight downwards. The former of these is carried into the greatest enfolding
of the Mesentery, and in its whole passage stretches under the straight
Intestine, and part of the Colon, and inserts into them many small shoots. But
the other Nerve descending from this enfolding toward the Anus under the
inferior part of the straight Intestine, imparts to it also frequent shoots; so
that this enfolding, the least of all those which are within the Abdomen, seems
to be constituted for the sake of this Nerve only, to wit, which lying under
the straight Intestine and part of the Colon, is inserted into the greatest
enfolding of the Mesentery.

From the lowest neighboring Enfolding, to which this least owes its original,
two Nerves going out, and being sent down into the Pelvis, cause there two
infoldings, viz. one in either side, in which the Nerves coming from the Os
sacrum, and ingraffed with the former, meet; from which also the Nerves
distributed into the adjacent parts, serve unto the several Excretions, viz. of
the Urine, Dung, and Seed made in that place: for two Nerves enter into the end
of the straight Intestine, and as many into the Womb or Prostates; but one, and
that a noted one, is carried into the Bladder.

But that we may return to the Intercostal pair, after either Trunk of it had
sent forth three branches, out of which the aforesaid lower infoldings of the
Abdomen are mediately or immediately made, it descends straight toward the Os
sacrum, and in its journey sends forth yet one or two branches into the
Ureters: but as soon as it is come to the beginning of the Os sacrum, both
nerves mutually inclining themselves to one another, are demerged within the
bending of the same bone, and there nigh its declining, and then in its
descent, they seem to be knit together upon it by two or three processes; and
so at length either nerve ends in very small fibers, which are distributed into
the Sphincter of the Anus. But sometimes either nerve join together into a
round enfolding nigh one transverse process, out of which single enfolding the
like very small Fibers are produced. Further, many others from the last
Vertebral Nerve meet with, and are ingraffed with these Fibers from the
intercostal pair inserted into the Anus.

CHAP. XXVI. The Explication of the Intercostal Pair of Nerves which are
described in the former Chapter as to their Offices and Uses: and first the
upper Branching of them is considered.
THE beginning of the Intercostal Nerve are two or three shoots reflected or
turned back from the Nerves of the fifth and sixth pair, and united into the
same Trunk, Fig. 9. D. a. a. b. Here we may wonder at the birth of this Nerve,
as it were borrowed; for it grows as a shrub upon another tree or shrub; and
therefore dispenses the common virtues and influences of either with a double
branching, viz. both its own and that of its parent: by which ramification or
branching it comes to pass, that there are very quick commerces and consent
between the conceptions of the Brain and the affections of the Praecordia, also
between the Actions and Passions almost of all the parts of the whole Body,
which belong to the involuntary Function. For in that the Trunk of the
intercostal Nerve proceeds from the Nerves of the fifth and sixth pair nigh
their beginnings, that is a sign that both the influence of the animal Spirits,
and the instincts for the performing of motions, are derived chiefly into it
from the Cerebel; to wit, from whose annular process the aforesaid pairs of
Nerves arise. But forasmuch as the same intercostal Nerve is rooted in their
Trunks, and not immediately in the Cerebel; this is the reason why the Eyes, as
also the parts of the Mouth and Face, to which the fifth and sixth pairs have
regard, do answer so readily and unknown to the Cerebel, as it were by the same
act, to the motions of the Praecordia and Viscera, which the intercostal Nerve
effects; and on the contrary, the motions of these presently follow the action
of those. As for example, in Sneezing as soon as the nervous Fibers besmearing
the Nostrils, are wrinkled together by the pulling, presently by the passage of
the intercostal nerve the Diaphragma, by reason of a more deep inspiration or
drawing in the breath, is for some time depressed; then the Cramp of the
Nostrils remitting, the Midriff also being violently drawn back, causes a more
strong breathing forth with a vehement blowing of the Air. In like manner on
the contrary, when by a tickling made upon the Ribs, the Diaphragma being
affected with a Spasm, moves to a cackling noise, the Face and Mouth are
pathetically figured with it into laughter.

The intercostal Nerve being slid out of the Skull, presently constitutes the
Ganglioform enfolding, Fig. 9. G. it being after the same manner in the Trunk
of the wandering pair. What the use of these infoldings is in general, we have
already shown; and clearly for the same reason in this place in the intercostal
Trunk, where it receives into it self some nerves from elsewhere, and sends
forth others from it self into the neighboring parts, this enfolding, as it
were a knot in the stem of a flourishing Tree, is made, that it may be as it
were a diverting place for the manifold tendency of the Spirits. As to the
adventitious Nerves it is observed, That by them plenty of subsidiary Spirits
are transmitted hither, only from the spinal Marrow, but by a manifold and
frequent passage; wherefore in this enfolding, and again in the following, then
a little lower, nigh the several junctures of the Vertebrae, the Vertebral
branch comes to either Trunk of the intercostal pair: this seems to be so
constituted for many uses. First, That the intercostal Nerve, by the reiterated
fastening to the solid parts, as it were by a frequent stay, might become the
more firm for the making of a long journey, when otherwise its little rope, by
too much stretching out, might be easily broken. Secondly, By this means it
comes to pass, that the nerves which are the Executors of the spontaneous, and
those of the involuntary Function, might have both a more certain commerce
together, and might be sometimes excited into mutual succors. Hence Respiration
and some other Acts, especially what concerns the Act of Venus, participate of
either Regiment, so that sometimes they follow the will, and sometimes draw it
even by force or unwilling. Further, when at any time the stock of animal
Spirits is deficient in either Province, supplies of them are sought from the
other: to wit, (as we hinted above) if the influence toward the Praecordia be
shut up through the ordinary passages, viz. the internal nerves, their passages
requisite for the sustaining of life, might be supplied by the Vertebral
branches: yea it is probable in the partial Apoplexy, and in the Incubus or
Nightmare, when the Cerebel being affected, the Spirits destinated for the
Heart, suffer an Eclipse in the Fountain it self, that through these
Emissaries, to wit, the Vertebral branches inserted into the intercostal pair,
some extemporary Subsidies are carried for the actuating the Heart. Thirdly,
The Vertebral branches by so frequent an insertion, are added to the
intercostal nerve, perchance in some respect for this end also, that the
superfluous or excrementitious humidities, heaped together about the spinal
Marrow, might be sent away by these Processes: for indeed we have already
shown, that a certain humor does abound within the Head, the medullar Appendix,
and nervous System; which oftentimes (when it becomes watery, or abounds above
measure) begets a serous heap in those parts: wherefore when the branches of
the intercostal nerve are terminated into the Mesentery, Kidneys, Intestines,
and some Genital parts, it is probable they do transfer into these sinks
superfluous humidities, not only their own, but also of another sort, to wit,
those received from the spinal Nerves.

As to the Nerves, which as Emissaries, are carried from the aforesaid
Ganglioform enfolding into other parts, we observe; first, that a noted shoot
is carried from hence into the Sphincter of the Throat, Fig. 9. g. This nerve
in the Sphincter of the Throat corresponds with others akin, arising higher
from the fifth pair, and distributed into the parts of the Palate and Mouth,
and is helpful to them in the business of chewing: for when the maxillar
branches of the fifth pair should perform their work for the chewing of the
food taken in, the task of this nerve mediately arising also from the fifth
pair, follows, to wit, whereby the Throat being opened, the chewed meats may be
thrust forward into its passage.

Another shoot is stretched out from this enfolding into a like enfolding of
the wandering pair placed near, Fig. 9. a. The reason of this insertion is
delivered above, where we treat of the wandering Pair. But it may be observed
further concerning this; when so nigh a communication happens between these
infoldings; and when shoots are sent from one of them into the Muscles of the
Larynx, and from another into the Muscles of the Throat, from hence we may give
a reason, why in Hysteric distempers and in some Hypochondriacal there is so
frequent and familiar a Symptom of the sense of choking in the Throat. For a
Cramp or Convulsion being begun in any nerve, it is wont to creep forward
further by the passage of the same, and so to invade sometimes these parts,
sometimes those successively. If therefore at any time a Spasm arises any where
in any nerve of the wandering or intercostal pair, and from thence tending
upwards or downwards, shall come to either enfolding, presently both being
affected, and the Muscles of the whole neighborhood being contracted, a bulk
or Tumor like a Globe or round thing in the Throat is excited with a sense of
choking.

The intercostal Nerve descending a little lower, contains in the neck another
greater enfolding proper to man, to which a noted Vertebral nerve is inserted
also, out of which many nerves destinated to the Praecordia, are sent forth on
either side, Fig. 9. T. As to the principal parts, to wit, the Brain and Heart,
there is no such great difference between a Man and a Brute, as there is about
the passage of one to the other, or the commerce that those parts have mutually
among themselves. In either kind, for the exercise of the vital Function, the
animal Spirits are derived from the Head, with a constant emanation into the
Heart; to which sort of influence of theirs the passage of the wandering pair of
nerves seems sufficient: wherefore in most Brutes the passage to the Heart and
its Appendix lies open only by this way, and scarce at all by any nerves of the
intercostal pair. But in Man the intercostal nerve, besides its offices in the
lower Belly, common to him with other Animals, serves in the place of a special
Internuncius also before the Cloister of the Breast, which bears the mutual
senses of the Brain and Heart this way and that way, or to and fro. For when,
besides the nerves of the wandering pair, stretched out also into the humane
Praecordia, (which certainly seem sufficient for the executing of the offices
of the Function merely vital) so many noted branches are sent forth from the
aforesaid intercostal enfolding, what kind of office should be attributed to
these, unless that they should contain the animal Spirits, by whose work and
ministry the mutual respects and affections of the Brain and Heart should be
communicated to one another? Whilst I consider this difference of either kind,
it comes into my mind, that Brutes are like Machines framed with a more simple
furniture and with less workmanship, and therefore furnished with a motion of
one kind only, or determined for the doing still the same thing. But in Man
diverse series of motions, and as it were complications of wheels within wheels,
appear. For indeed, by the passage of the aforesaid enfolding, the conceptions
of the Brain presently affect the Heart and its Vessels, and cause the rest of
the Appendix, together with the Diaphragma, to be moved. Hence the motion of
the blood and its inkindling in the Heart, together with the Pulse and
Respiration, are altered: and for that cause, from the Heart being altered, not
only impressions are retorted upon the Brain by the passage of the same nerves,
but also the blood it self, its course being changed, drives to the Brain with
a different or unaccustomed fluctuation, and so by moving the animal Spirits
with various impulses, causes first one sort of conceptions, and then others to
be produced: and so by reason of these reciprocal affections of the Heart and
Brain, which are wont by a long series to be propagated vicissively, a
multiplicity of thoughts and Phantasms arises. Hence both the ancient Divines
and Philosophers placed wisdom in the Heart. Certainly the Works of Prudence
and Virtue depend very much on the mutual commerce which happens to the Heart
with the Brain: because, that cogitations about the acts of the Appetite or
Judgment may be rightly described, it is behoveful for the flood of the blood
to be restrained in the Breast, and the inordinations of it and of the Heart it
self to be governed by the Nerves, as it were by Reins, and to be composed into
requisite and apt motions. We might say more concerning this, but that this
Speculation is from our purpose, and belongs more properly to Pathology or the
Doctrine of the Passions of the Soul. In the mean time, we may refer hither one
or two Observations taken from Anatomy.

When of late we had dissected the Carcass of a man that was a Fool from his
birth, we could find no defect or fault in the Brain, unless that its substance
or bulk was very small. But the chief note of difference which we observed
between the parts of this man and of a man of judgment, was this, That the
aforesaid enfolding of the intercostal Nerve, which we call the Internuncius of
the Brain and Heart, proper to man, was very small in this Fool, and beset with
a weaker guard of Nerves.

Whilst we were writing these, we made an Anatomy of a Monkey, whose Brain
differed little from that which is seen in a Dog or a Fox, unless that it was
much more capacious in the proportion to the bulk of his Body, and the turnings
and windings of it were larger. The orbicular Prominences called Nates and
Testes, also the ringy Protuberance, sent down from the Cerebel, came nearer
the figure and magnitude of those parts in a man. But what occurred chiefly
worthy noting, was this, viz. That the intercostal Nerve, although even as it
is wont to be in other Brutes, being included in the same sheath with the Trunk
of the eighth pair, was carried through the Neck, yet departing from this Nerve
near the Chanel-bone, before it was inserted into the enfolding, placed nigh
the roots of the upper Ribs, did send forth some shoots into the Heart and its
Appendix, and certain Fibers into the nerve of the Diaphragma: which perhaps
partly is the reason, why this Animal is so crafty and mimical above other
Beasts, and can so aptly show and imitate, not only the gestures, but the
passions and some manners of a Man. But we will proceed to the explication of
the intercostal Nerve from whence we have digressed.

We have already intimated for what use the Vertebral branch is inserted into
its cervical enfolding. There is the same reason for this as for the other
Vertebrals, which communicate with the intercostal Nerve almost in its whole
passage. But for that the nerve of the Diaphragma is radicated in the same
Vertebral nerve, from whence a branch comes into this enfolding, I say from
that a reason may be taken, why the motion of the Diaphragma intimately
conspires with the Praecordia, yea and with the conceptions of the Brain: which
kind of Sympathy of the Diaphragma with the other parts, because it is
requisite to be more strict and noted in man, it is observed, That not only the
Vertebral branch comes between the enfolding and the root of the nerve of the
Diaphragma, but two and sometimes three nerves are sent from this enfolding
into the trunk it self of the nerve of the Diaphragma, Fig. 9 e. e. Truly from
hence not only the joint action or Sympraxis of the Diaphragma with the
Praecordia may be derived; but also the genuine cause is here manifest, why
Risibility is a proper Affection of a man. For as often as the Imagination is
affected by any pleasant or wonderful conception, presently the Heart desires
to rejoice, and as it were by shaking off its load to be eased: wherefore that
the blood might be more swiftly emptied out of its right bosom into the Lungs,
and consequently out of the left into the Aorta, the Diaphragma, instigated by
the passage of the nerves going out of this enfolding, is drawn upward by a
more rapid Systole, and raises up the Lungs, as it were making iterated leaps,
and causes them, by their more frequent striking together, to drive out both
the Air and the blood. Then forasmuch as the same intercostal Nerve, which
communicates lower with the nerve of the Diaphragma, is continued also higher
with the maxillary Nerves, a cackling being made in the Breast, with it the
gesture of the Mouth and Face pathetically answers.

One or two noted shoots and many nervous Fibers are carried from this
enfolding into the returning Nerve, Fig. 9. z. Certainly the reason of this
communication seems to be, that the Diaphragma and the Heart it self (into
which nerves are sent from this enfolding) might yet more conspire with the
rough Artery (which the returning nerve affects) in its various actions, and
especially in laughing, weeping, and singing. Moreover, when the returning
Nerves, by pulling upwards the Trunks of the Aorta, cause the blood, for the
stirring up some Affections, to creep more swiftly toward the Head, they may
in the performing that office be much helped by the associate labor of the
Nerves sent from this enfolding.

From this enfolding in the Neck many small fibers and shoots are spread into
the sanguiferous Vessels, as also into the Coats of the Trachea and the
Oesophagus, Fig. 9. ibid. As to what belongs to the former that respect the
Trachea and the blood-carrying Vessels; their office is, that they may
respectively draw together and spread abroad those channels of inspired and
exspired blood and Air, according to the way and manner wherewith the Pulse and
Breathing ought to be performed; whereby the motions of either might be the
better retarded or accelerated, according to the necessities or requirings of
the Heart. Then numerous Fibers are stretched out from this enfolding into the
Coats of the Oesophagus placed near, that by this means the admirable consent
between the Heart and the Stomach, by reason of the Nerves being reached forth
from this enfolding and from the wandering pair to both, may be produced.

Concerning the Cardiack branches sent from this enfolding, we need not
discourse any more: after having but now intimated, that these were as it were
Internuncii peculiar to men, which carrying to and fro the reciprocal
impressions of the Brain and Heart, cause Commerces in both Kingdoms. But
forasmuch as Nerves of a double kind, viz. of the wandering and intercostal
pair, respect the humane Praecordia, lest the gestures of one should be
different from those of the other, therefore the Cardiack branches, which are
of either family, partly communicate in the same enfolding, and are partly
inoculated mutually by shoots sent forth before they are distributed into the
Heart it self.

Below the Cervical enfolding, the intercostal Trunk being demersed within the
Thorax, admits three Vertebral Nerves arising higher, and constitutes the other
enfolding, which is commonly called the Intercostal, but more properly the
Thoracical enfolding, Fig. 9. T. In this place the intercostal Nerve being
about to pass into its last and more large Province, viz. the Viscera of the
lower Belly, and therefore seeking aid for the journey, and as it were a
Viaticum for it self, it gets together in this enfolding an increase or aiding
forces from the Vertebral nerves, and afterward receives lower others fresh
nigh the several knots of the Vertebrae; because it will have need of a great
stock of Spirits, which it must bestow on the Mesenterick infoldings, and on
other parts of the Abdomen.

That this Nerve about to enter the Thoracical enfolding, does bind the
Chanel-bone Artery, Fig. 9. l. and that the superior branch of the Vertebral,
being sent into the same enfolding, does bind about the Vertebral Artery, Fig.
9. p. the reason of both seems, that the blood, for the uses and necessities of
the lower Viscera (to which the intercostal Nerve from thence serves) may be
driven forward with a more plentiful afflux downwards: which thing those Nerves
easily do by pulling together the blood-carrying Vessels toward their
enfolding; so that they attempt this snatching of the blood in opposition to
that which the returning Nerves perform. And indeed when the blood, tending
upwards and downwards, is wont sometimes to flow too much toward either bound,
sometimes to be wanting; therefore the nerves, as it were an incitement or
remora, are variously disposed both in the upper and lower region of the
Circuit about the sanguiferous Vessels. After what manner this Thoracical
enfolding is in brute Beasts, shall be particularly shown hereafter. The
intercostal Nerve in a Man, both in this enfolding and in the whole descent
through the Thorax, receives many Vertebral nerves, as if sparing of its own
stock, and greedy of another, but sends forth from it self not a shoot:
whatever of Spirits is remaining either from the influence above, or comes to
it by the by, is reserved wholly for a largess to be bestowed on the Viscera of
the lower Belly. But after what manner, and by what passages of nerves that is
dispensed into the several parts, we will unfold in the following Chapter.

CHAP. XXVII. The lower Branching of the Intercostal Nerve belonging to the
Parts and Viscera of the lower Belly is unfolded.
AFter the intercostal Pair has past through the hollowness of the Thorax
without any expense of Spirits, unless in the Neck-infolding, at length it
sends down from the region of the Ventricle on both sides, a noted Branch;
either of which presently becoming divided into two, constitute two peculiar
Infoldings on either side; but one enfolding arises in the midst of them, as if
common to either side. Of the infoldings which are on the left side, one
respects the Kidney, and the other the Ventricle with the Spleen; but of those
which are on the opposite side, one respects the right Kidney, and the other
the Liver and its neighboring part. In the midst of these, the enfolding
proper to the Mesentery and the biggest, is placed as the Sun among the other
Planets. Further, from these are sent forth one to another and into the
neighboring parts numerous Fibers very thickly, as it were dartings of rays.
Fig. 11. plainly shows all these.

Concerning these, in the first place, it shall be inquired into in general,
For what end so many nervous infoldings, with almost innumerable fibers and
shoots, are distributed about the Mesentery and the Viscera of the Abdomen. For
when in these parts the fibers and nervous shoots are carried on every side
with so thick a series, that they are variously infolded with their manifold
meeting, it may seem wonderful, if every one of these be destinated to some
uses, and are not rather sprinkled here and there by chance, and as it were by
the inconsiderate sporting of Nature. And indeed any one can scarce think, that
so many Vessels should be prepared for the performing the offices of motion or
sense in that place. For those Viscera, unless highly pulled and affected with
a Convulsion, are sensible of little or nothing that we know of; and their
motions are almost no other thing than obscure Vermiculations or light
Corrugations, so that for the effecting them there is required no greater
preparation than for the slow progress of a Snail. Wherefore from hence it has
come into the mind of some, that a certain Juice, and that perhaps nutritious,
was dispensed by this manifold passage of the nervous Pipes: which sort of
office however if assigned to these Fibers dispersed about the Mesentery, why
should not the same office either of receiving or of carrying of nourishment,
be granted to those in like manner divaricated about the Lungs and the
Praecordia, and especially about the rough Artery? But truly it is highly
improbable, that a nutritious Juice should be contained in the Coats of the
Trachea or of the Bronchia, which the nerves may suck out; nor does it more
clearly appear, why more nerves should be destinated for the carrying of the
alible Juice to these parts of the Abdomen, or those of the Breast, than is
needful for the musculous stock. But in the mean time, though we deny, that the
whole nutritious matter is carried this way and that way by those or the other
nerves; yet we think, that within those nervous passages an humor does
perpetually abound, which may be for a Vehicle of the animal Spirits, and a
Ferment for the nutritious matter: with which going with the nervous humor
toward the Intestines and to the other sinks of the Body, it is likely, that
the superfluous and excrementitious serosities do often slide down together,
and so are carried out.

But it may be well thought, as to the Mesenterick Nerves, and Infoldings in
which they are terminated, and the Fibers most thickly going out of these, that
these different manner of Vessels are first Channels, then Storehouses, and
lastly the last Emissaries of the animal Spirits. If it should be demanded, for
what end so great plenty of Spirits should be designed for these ignobler
parts; I say, that this is done for the performing the acts of Motion and Sense
there, which are highly necessary for the preserving of life it self. For
although local motion, which is always performed by the help of a Muscle, as of
a Spring, is not convenient for the Viscera of the lower Belly; yet intestine
motions are brought forth by them almost continually, and after many fashions:
viz. for the subduing the Chyle, also for the separation of some parts and
particles from others, both of that, and also of the bloody Liquor, and the
protrusion of every one toward their designed bounds, the Fibers and nervous
shoots reaching into the Membranes of the Viscera and the Coats of the Vessels,
yea and into the textures of the Parenchyma, are variously drawn together, to
wit, these are pulled upwards, those downwards; sometimes many together,
sometimes apart or successively, are wont to be drawn hither and thither. In
truth, it is a sign of the indiscontinued action of these Viscera, that as well
in sleep, and perhaps more than in waking, the Culinary work of Nutrition is
performed; and whilst the Organs of the other Faculties are at rest, there is
no quiet granted to these: but that the Mesenterick nerves perpetually grinding
in the Mill, are always busied for the preparing the alible humor and the
exporting the same toward all parts.

Moreover in these parts, to which the aforesaid Nerves belong, there is found
an exquisite feeling no less than a motive Faculty; for whatsoever
heterogeneous or hurtful thing, mixed with the Chyle or blood, is brought to
any Viscera, presently the Spirits, inhabiting those parts, being warned of the
evil, do greatly tumultuate as it were by entering into a Conspiracy, that what
is hostile or troublesome they might shut out. But indeed, because the animal
Spirits, flowing by the passage of the intercostal nerve to the Intestines and
Viscera akin to them, proceed from the Cerebel* therefore the businesses of
either Faculty, to wit, both the sensitive and locomotive, forasmuch as they
are performed the Brain unconsulted, and the animal scarce knowing it, are not
so openly taken notice of, and for that reason they are accounted of less than
the spontaneous acts of the other parts.

But as to the manner it self or way of the economy, whereby the animal
Spirits, destinated to the Viscera of the lower Belly, are exercised, we
affirm, That plenty of them flow into all the Mesentetick infoldings by the
passage of the nerves sent from the intercostal pair; where being heaped up to
a fullness, as it were in so many Storehouses or places of Receipt, they are
kept to be distributed from thence into several parts, as occasion requires.
But that the Spirits flow out of these infoldings, not through singular and
larger branches, (as is done in the Muscles) but as it were by Troops of
Fibers, into their proper tasks, the reason is, because here the business is
performed otherwise than in the musculous stock. For where a Muscle is fixed to
the part to be moved, its implanted Fibers perform the whole work of
Contraction, or of the motive endeavor; but it suffices for the nerve still to
convey new supplements of Spirits, and as occasion serves, the Instincts of the
Motion to be performed: but in the Membranes and the Viscera, where Muscles are
wanting, the nervous Fibers themselves most thickly implanted, and distributed
as it were so many little ropes, almost into every part of the subject, perform
the business of Traction or drawing by themselves and their own proper
endeavor or force partly; and partly solicit or stir up into motion the
Fibers implanted in the Viscera disposed after an uncertain order; which they
determinate in their action, and moderate or govern them, as it were so many
fingers laid upon the strings of a musical Instrument. For although the
Membranes and the Viscera themselves are endued with some implanted Fibers; yet
these are not, as it is in the Muscles, of one kind and position; but in the
same part some are straight, and others oblique or crooked, these tend upwards,
those downwards, and others are carried round; so that diverse sorts of motions
ought to be performed in the same Membrane or Inward, sometimes together,
sometimes successively or by turns: wherefore distinct nerves are required, not
only for the several series of Fibers, but for all the parts of the subject, to
wit, which may stop here a motion begun in that place, and may begin another
anew, or may unite one with another. Truly the motion which is performed in the
musculous stock seems like the rude and more simple work of some Weaver, where
the shuttle being always cast after the same manner, the Woof is laid under the
Thread or Yarn: but the motions of the Intestines and Viscera may be aptly
compared to a Texture very much variegated or flourished, for the weaving of
whose more artificial substance or making there is made use of many hands
together, or of a Machine diversely turning about, and furnished with more than
a thousand sorts of motions.

Concerning the many Mesenterick Nerves, and Shoots, and nervous Fibers which
go out of them by bands, we must consider chiefly these two things: to wit,
what may be the office of each of them for the stirring up of motion or sense,
either of them, or both together in any part: then secondly, what the
communication of either of them may be with other nerves, infoldings or bundles
of nerves, by reason of which a Sympathy or consent of actions arises at once
in diverse parts. According to these two respects we will particularly weigh now
the several nervous Vessels belonging to the Viscera of the lower Belly.

Therefore in the left side the supreme Mesenterick branch being presently
forked like the figure of the Letter Y, contains in its upper shoot the
Stomachical enfolding, which is also the Splenetick, and in the other lower the
Renal enfolding or that belonging to the Reins. Moreover, about the knot of
division it sends forth some shoots to the greatest enfolding of the Mesentery,
Fig. 11. F. G. Hence a reason is plain, wherefore there happens such affinity
between the Ventricle and the Spleen, and between the Mesentery and the Reins,
so that the very often and familiar Symptom of Vomiting is both in Splenetick,
Colical, and Nephritick people: because when a Convulsion is begun in any part
or Inward, which the Mesenterick nerve respects, presently other parts, to
which the infoldings or shoots of the same nerve belong, are drawn into consent.

From this lower enfolding a little bundle of Nerves being carried toward the
Stomach, inserts its Fibers partly in its bottom, and partly sends them to meet
with other Fibers sent down from the nerve of the Stomach, Fig. 11. n. The
reason of the former is, That whereas there are many Coats of the Ventricle,
and diverse series of Fibers are disposed in them, for the actuating all of
which with a due influx of animal Spirits, the Stomachical nerves, derived from
the wandering pair, are not sufficient; it was fit, that for the outward Court
as it were or Precinct of this Inward, to wit, for the outmost bottom of it,
some forces of Spirits might be supplied from some strange Kingdom, to wit,
from the aforesaid nervous enfolding of the Abdomen. Instead of this, Spirits
also may slide downwards from the same Stomachical branch through other Fibers
sent down, and be sent into this Splenetick enfolding. Besides also it is
observed, That the adventitious nerves aptly conspire with the former, being of
the proper dominion of the Ventricle, and that either are not only inoculated
within the confines of the Inward it self, but they run into mutual embraces
without it, and as it were join hands together.

It seems plain, that the nervous Filaments being carried from the aforesaid
enfolding to the bottom of the Ventricle, may serve there for the performing
the acts of Motion and Sensation: but it does not so easily appear with what
office the other handful of Fibers reaching out from hence into the Spleen is
charged ( Fig. 11. z.) because this Inward is said to be destitute wholly of
every animal Faculty. When we did elsewhere inquire into the use of the Spleen,
we thought good to affirm, That its office was to separate the dregs of the
Blood and the acid-saline Particles, and whatsoever were of a more fixed
nature, and to concoct them more being received into its own bosom, and to
convert them into an acid Ferment; by which being again delivered to the blood
through the Veins, a sharpness and an asperity, as also an active or
fermentative virtue are gotten for its Latex. Wherefore the whole substance of
the Spleen consists of a texture of Fibers in the form of a net; to wit, that
the Feculencies of the blood might be more plentifully received, and contained
within its spongy cavities and thick passages. I say therefore, that for the
fit preserving and dispensing of the Splenetick Ferment, besides the Arteries
which carry matter, and the Veins which continually sup back some portion of
the same fermented, there seems to be need of many nerves also, which both by
pulling the fibrous texture of the Spleen, might cause the melancholic and
dark Faeces, laid up in it, to be shaken together, and so by defending it from
putrefaction and coagulation, cause it to be imbued with an acid and
fermentative nature; and also that those nerves may sometimes draw together and
constrain the blood-carrying Vessels, sometimes open and enlarge them; that as
occasion serves, the Feculencies of the blood may be sometimes more
plentifully, sometimes more sparingly laid aside out of the Arteries into the
Spleen, also that more or less of the Ferment, preserved in the Spleen, may be
poured out on the blood according to the requirings of the Passions or of the
natural Instinct. No Hypochondriack but does abundantly perceive, that some
Splenetick nerves do perform motions; for those great perturbations which are
wont to be excited in the left side, as when sometimes Inflations, sometimes
constrictions of the inward parts, and sometimes various concussions are
perceived with a wandering pain running here and there, they are only Spasms or
Convulsions or wrinklings together, with which the nerves of the Spleen are
ordinarily affected. Nor do its nerves, taken with a Convulsion, stir up
tumults only in the neighborhood of the Spleen, but oftentimes further into
the Heart it self, yea into the whole Body the effects of their inordinations
are carried. I have known an Hypochondriack, who presently upon the Spleen
being disturbed, seemed to have his Praecordia, being drawn downwards, to be
cruelly pressed and bound together; so that being very sad and dejected in his
mind, also complaining of an exceeding great straitness and constriction of his
Breast, he thought himself almost dead. The cause of which kind of distemper
was without doubt, that when many Fibers going out of the Splenetick enfolding
are united with other Fibers sent from the farthest end of the wandering pair,
it easily happens, that the former, being distempered with the Convulsion, do
draw together and pull downwards their yoke-fellows, and by consequence the
Trunk it self of the wandering pair, from which the nerves are sent into the
Praecordia: certainly by the Sympraxis or joint action of either kind of the
aforesaid nerves, viz. whereof these respect the Spleen, those the Praecordia,
it is effected, that the Trembling, Oppression, and other grievous Distempers
of the Heart, as also of the Spleen, so ordinarily happen. Further, forasmuch
as the Fermentation of the blood depends on the Spleen, according to the
influence of this, that performs its Circulation, sometimes pleasantly,
sometimes disturbedly. Whilst the Spleen is at quiet, and free from any
perturbation, the blood also is quietly moved in Hypochondriacal persons; but
if the same be moved and exercised, (as it is wont to be in any passion or
violent motion of the Body, or by a Medicine) presently its nerves being
distempered with a Convulsion, shake it more with reiterated contractions; so
that the fermentative Feculencies, being shaken out of its bosom, flow back
more plentifully into the blood, which cause its Latex presently to be
troubled, and as it were muddy, and sharpen it with so great acrimony and
mordacity, that it burns and pricks the Brain and Heart like needles; from
whence in Splenetick people, besides that the Reason is obscured, the
affections of the Mind, especially Sadness, Hatred, and Anger are very much
increased.

Concerning the Splenetick Nerves, by another conjecture, we are yet brought to
believe, that they, besides the exercise of the motive Faculty, do both instill
into the Spleen its own humor, which promotes the fermentative virtue of that
Inward; and also (because the nerves, as was shown already, convey the Spirits,
and sometimes the humors by either way, viz. forward and backward) the same
implanted in the Spleen, do often imbibe from it an acetous or Vinegar-like
humor, and as it were Vitriolick, from whose acrimony and notable twitching,
they are forced into Convulsions.

But forasmuch as the nervous Enfolding respecting the Spleen, communicates
more nearly with the Ventricle, Mesentery, Liver, and Kidneys, and more
remotely with the Praecordia and other parts placed at a distance; from hence
the cause is plain, wherefore not only these several Viscera and parts, by
reason of the fault of the Spleen, are folded together; but also on the
contrary, why the Spleen being indisposed by any Disease, or trouble raised up
in any of those parts, is wont to be disturbed: so it is not altogether for
nothing, that the Symptoms every where infesting, the cause of them being
unknown, are ascribed ordinarily to the Spleen; because it fixes not only its
own inordinations in other parts, but also suffers for their peculiar faults:
which notwithstanding is wrongfully ascribed to Vapors transmitted from this
or that part, when the formal reason of every Distemper of this kind for the
most part consists in the communication made through the Nerves.

The lower Enfolding of the left side seems to be made for the Kidney placed
near, into which chiefly the bundle of its Fibers is carried, Fig. 11.. g. g.
Certainly that these nerves, following the emulgent Vessels, do embrace the
same, and bind them about with a various and frequent complication; that is so
made for that end, that by reason of the Artery being so strained and
frequently shaken by the drawings of the nerves, the Serum may the more easily
be precipitated from the blood: wherefore it is observed in very great
difficulty or danger, when the mind and all the nerves are strained for fear,
that a frequent and more plentiful making of water, and that often painful, is
wont to be provoked.

The Renal Enfolding receives, besides the Nerve common to it with the upper
enfolding, another new and peculiar one from the intercostal nerve, or rather
that coming between from the spinal Marrow, Fig. 11. b. Hence it is, that the
Loins have a great consent with the Reins, and suffer so ordinarily for their
Distempers with a grievous and largely diffusive pain. Forasmuch as this
enfolding communicates with the greatest of the Mesentery, the Colic distemper
and the Nephritick are much akin, and it is often difficult to distinguish
their fits one from the other.

The Mesenterick branch in the right side, as well as the left, being forked,
contains two infoldings: the upper of these (which we call the Hepatick) sends
forth from it self many little bundles of nervous Fibers; the greatest of which
being carried toward the Liver, clothes the Hepatick Artery as it were with a
Net made of Fibers, Fig. 11.. o. The most Learned Glisson observes, That the
Hepatick Artery is bestowed on the Trunks of the Vessels, to wit, of the common
Chest, of the bilary Pore, and of the Vena Porta; for the watering of which,
and for the actuating them with heat and nourishing Juice, it carries the
arterious Blood; to which notwithstanding for the recarrying, an associate Vein
is wholly wanting: wherefore that ought to carry the blood, not with a full and
free influx, but by little and little, and always in a constant measure to
those membranaceous parts: for otherwise there had been danger, lest from the
bloody Latex plentifully rushing forward, for that it could not be still
remanded presently through the Veins, an Inflammation should be excited, or
lest from its torrent being transfused beyond its banks, the courses of the
other rivers in the Liver should be disturbed. But for that the nerves, like
Reins, do bind about the Trunk of the Artery, the inflowing of the blood it
self is moderated, and they cause it variously to be dispensed according to the
wants of those parts to which it is destinated.

From the Troop of Nerves going out toward the Liver, some bend down into the
Pancreas, and others into the Cholidock Vessels, Duodenum, and Pylorus, and sow
into them thick series of shoots, Fig. 11. p. p. The office of these seems to
be, to pull together the excretory passages of those parts, and to shake them
for the causing Evacuations of the boiling or turging humors upon occasion.
Further, from these Fibers being carried upwards, when many others sent from
either Stomachical nerve are united, the reason is plain, why from an hawling
or pulling made about the Ventricle, the yellow Bile is drawn out of the
Gall-chest into the Duodenum, which being carried from thence into the
Ventricle, by reason of a Convulsion of that same Intestine, is cast up by
Vomit: because the Stomachical nerves being irritated by a Medicine, or by any
troublesome thing, for the making an Evacuation above, and for that cause drawn
from thence upwards, they draw together the nerves belonging to the Liver and
the Cholidock Vessels, for that they are tied to them, and bring them into
consent with the superior Spasm or Convulsion. Hence it happens, that not only
the Stomach being first tired, draws to it self the Bile by its Convulsion, and
allures it into its own bosom; but the Bile also of its own accord growing
turgid, and so being poured out into the Duodenum, forasmuch as it irritates
the nerves of this Intestine, and then by their consent, provokes the nervous
Vessels of the Ventricle, it presently induces a choleric Vomiting.

The Hepatick Enfolding communicates with the Splenetick by Fibers going
between either, Fig. 11. t. The reason of which seems to be, That when one
enfolding respects the end or the right extremity of the Ventricle, and another
the left; that a consent in either and a joint action may be made toward the
Stomach, both communicate between themselves by nerves, as if Internuntii.
Truly it seems to come to pass by the passage of these nerves, that the
Hypochondriacal pains oftentimes run from the left side into the right; to wit,
for that a Spasm or Convulsion begun in the Splenetick enfolding, is wont to be
carried to the Hepatick.

Between the Hepatick Enfolding and the greatest of the Mesentery, many Fibers
reaching out by bands, are cast out in the midst, Fig. 11. p. p. the office of
which is to sustain a certain commerce and Sympathy; to wit, such an one is
required, both that the Chyle may be ministered from the Intestines toward the
Liver still in due proportion, also that the Bile may opportunely slide out
from the Gallbladder into the Intestines for the provoking of Excretion. For
we are of this Opinion, That the Meseraick Veins sucking out a certain portion
of the Chyle from the Intestines, immediately transfer it through the region of
the Liver into the Vena Cava, whereby the blood in the ascending Trunk of the
hollow Vein or Vena Cava, might be freshly imbued with nourishing Juice; even
as in its descending Trunk it is refreshed, the same being poured out through
the Thoracical Vessels or those belonging to the Thorax. Wherefore it is
needful, that there should be a very strict affinity between these Viscera; and
the rather, because the Bile ought to be poured out from the Gall chest to the
Intestines, not continually, but for some uses, by occasions and intervals. For
the Nerves knowing best the wants of either part, warn them both of their
mutual duty, and as occasion serves, stir them into action.

It is observed, That in the right side an ample Nerve is stretched out between
the Hepatick and Renal enfolding, Fig. 11. m. So that between these infoldings
a greater and more immediate consent is had, than between those pairs of the
other side. The reason of which does not easily appear, unless perhaps it
should be so made for this end, that when from the Reins, in making of water,
there is an endeavor of the serous Excretion, the Pylorus and the Cholidock
Vessels being at once drawn downwards, a protrusion of the Chyle and Faeces
might be provoked toward the lower parts of the Belly. Certainly this
connection of these infoldings is chiefly the cause, why oftentimes most cruel
Vomiting uses to come upon a Fit of the Stone; and that from such a Vomiting
the Cholidock Vessels are very much emptied, as if provoked by taking an
Emetick.

The greatest Enfolding of the Mesentery being placed in the midst of the rest,
like the Sun, disperses every where round about nervous Fibers like rays, Fig.
11.. and casts them not only on every one of those infoldings, as if so many
Planets with a peculiar Aspect, or Actinobolism or Irradiation, but also it
distributes them into many Intestines, sanguiferous Vessels, and other parts
lying round about: without doubt upon these nervous Filaments, which are
carried from this enfolding to the Intestines, as Lines from the Center to the
Circumference, every action of the Intestines, and especially the Peristaltick
motion of the Vermiculation, depends; namely for that these Fibers do move
successively, and still move further every begun action, as it were with a
spiral or Screw-like progress.

That from this Enfolding many Fibers and shoots going forth, are inserted into
the Trunk of the Aorta nigh its descending, and that these reaching toward the
Intestines, accompany the Blood-carrying Vessels, and in several places climb
over them; from hence it may be inferred, That nerves also in the Abdomen are
like Bridles and Reins cast on the sanguiferous Vessels, which either by
straining or pulling them together, may sometimes retard, sometimes incite the
course of the blood according to the needs of the lower Viscera.

From the greatest Enfolding of the Mesentery some noted Fibers and shoots are
sent out into the Glandula's of the Womb or the Women's Testicles, Fig. 11. t.
t. Into which also other shoots from the Trunk of the intercostal Nerve, ibid.
u. u. and others going out of the nerve which comes between this enfolding and
the lowest of the Abdomen, do come together, ibid. ps. ps. So that a provision
of Spirits is carried into those parts from a threefold Storehouse; which
indeed is much larger than is done in the other Sex, when we find scarce any
nerve to belong to men's Testicles. Indeed the Womb, besides that it is a very
sensible part, ought also to be moved diversely, and in bringing forth a child
very strongly: wherefore there are granted to this both more strong implanted
Fibers, and also Nerves of a various kind and original.

Most of the Infoldings of the Abdomen, but especially the lowest, and that
related to it the greatest of the Mesentery, are oftentimes affected in the
Passions commonly called Hysterical, as shall be presently declared. Therefore
if at any time such distempers proceed from the Womb, the cause is manifest
wherefore the aforesaid infoldings are drawn into consent. But we have
elsewhere shown, That those Passions are merely convulsive, and not seldom
excited without any fault in the Womb. Further, that Symptom very frequent in
those kind of Fits, to wit, in which as it were a Globe is perceived to be
carried from the bottom of the Belly, and about the Navel to leap out
impetuously, which therefore is thought to be an ascent of the Womb; I say,
that it is nothing else than most cruel Convulsions of these infoldings. Indeed
oftentimes in Women, and sometimes also in Men, I have known when the
convulsive Affection has invaded, that a bulk in the Hypogastrium has been
seen to arise, then about the midst of the Abdomen so great a swelling to
follow, that it could not be hindered or pressed down, though strongly attempted
by the hands of a strong man. Without doubt, the cause of this admirable
distemper is, that within the nerves of the intercostal pair the inflowing
animal Spirits, as often as they begin disorders or convulsive motions, first
(as it is wont to be) begin to grow hot or to be exploded about the extremities
of the nerve, to wit, in the lowest enfolding of the Abdomen; which affection
of theirs, when creeping upwards it is carried to the greatest enfolding of the
Mesentery, so that the Spirits inhabiting it are taken with the like
inordination, it is no wonder, if that swelling up of the middle of the
Abdomen, and as it were an explosion of a certain nitrosulphureous matter,
should be stirred up. For truly it is not probable, that that Symptom should be
excited from the Womb ascending and being removed from its place, because,
besides this part being fixed in its place and firmly established with
Ligaments, the bulk of it also in Virgins is so small, scarce exceeding the
bigness of a Walnut, that although it should be carried up into the Belly, it
could not produce such a swelling. Nor is it more likely, that this sort of
distemper is stirred up from the Muscles of the Abdomen taken with a
Convulsion: for they, however convulsive, draw together themselves and
subjected parts upwards or downwards, or of one side, but they are not able by
any means to bear themselves aloft, and to lift up on high, with a force, the
region of the Navel. But, as we suppose, the animal Spirits in the greatest
enfolding of the Mesentery growing fierce, and becoming apt to be exploded, (as
such indeed they are whenever they enter into convulsive motions) they being
there gathered round thickly into a Globe, do mainly blow up and lift on high
with their effervescency and notable rarefaction that enfolding with its whole
neighborhood, and at once drive upward the Viscera lying upon it with a
certain vibration or shaking. A more full explication of this Symptom belongs
to the Pathology of the Brain and Nerves.

In the mean time we shall take notice, that another certain Distemper, viz.
the Colical grief does belong to the infoldings of the Abdomen, and especially
to this greatest of the Mesentery. For it may be thought, that the most cruel
torments that are wont to be excited in this disease do come, not from an
excrementitious matter shut up in the cavities of the Intestines, nor always
from a sharp humor impacted in their Coats, but oftener from the nervous Juice
imbued with a certain acrimony, and stagnating within this enfolding; from
whence, by reason of a consent of this with the infoldings both Hepatick and
Splenetick, a frequent and cruel Vomiting comes upon these pains. But these
Pathologick Speculations being referred to their places, we will follow what we
first of all instituted, the further passage of the intercostal Nerve, by which
we are led to the two lesser and lowest Infoldings of the Abdomen.

Below the Mesenterick Nerves, out of which the superior Infoldings are made,
either descending intercostal Trunk sends forth three or four singular shoots,
which are carried into the Ureters, Fig. 11. u. u. The use of these seems to
be, to pull together, and to jog or shake those urinary Channels, that the Serum
separated in the Reins, may be the more readily drawn out toward the Bladder.
Moreover, if at any time a viscous or muddy matter does stick to the passages
of the Ureters, or a more fixed stone does obstruct their Cavities, they, by
the help of the Nerves inserted here and there in their whole tract, being
pulled together and wrinkled, may press down and always move forward any bulk
or substance staying in the passage.

Nigh the Vertebrae, out of which the Crural Nerves begin to go forward, three
distinct branches brought to either intercostal Nerve, are carried from thence
into the lowest hollowness of the Belly, where they make the enfolding which is
the lowest of the Abdomen, Fig. 11.. p. p. p. That here so many nerves, to wit,
six large ones joining together do make but a small enfolding, viz. a lesser
than is raised higher in a single branch of the nerve; the reason is, because
this enfolding is like an Inn, where the inflowing Spirits dwell no long time,
but it receiving them only in their passage, presently commits them to other
infoldings placed here and there above, below, and of one side, and made for
diverse offices; for from hence the chief passage, and as it were a broad way,
leads to the greatest enfolding of the Mesentery; moreover, from hence nerves,
diversely going out, make three other infoldings, which respect the parts and
ways by which the several Excretions, to wit, of the Dung, Urine, and Seed, are
made in the lower Belly.

The first Nerve therefore sent out of this lowest Enfolding into the greatest
of the Mesentery, a little before it reaches to it, imparts two noted shoots to
the Glandula's of the Womb; but in its ascent it admits four other branches, as
it were subsidiary, viz. two on either side from the intercostal pair, Fig. 11.
chapter so that the nerve here seems to be the chief means of passage of the animal
Spirits destinated to the greatest enfolding of the Mesentery and to the
uterine Glandula's; which passage however is carried into the designed parts,
not immediately, but a compass being made, it first goes forward beyond its
bound, and at length with a certain going back. The reason of which is, that
the motions of all the Intestines, viz. the Vermiculations should be directed
downwards toward the straight Intestine, and also that the actions of the Womb
should tend thither; therefore 'twas fit, that the animal Spirits should be
supplied from below whither the motion inclined. For by the like means, this
Mesenterick nerve and the two returning nerves, being first carried lower,
ascend into their Provinces; to wit, that they may pull together the respective
parts toward that bound placed below, as it were to a Pully.

Further, for this end, to wit, that the influence of the Spirits actuating
some Intestines, might be derived lower; the other enfolding of the Abdomen, to
wit, the least, is added immediately to this. Because upon the Nerves being
carried from hence about an inch, there grows a small enfolding; out of which,
one nerve being sent out into the greatest enfolding of the Mesentery,
stretches it self under the top of the straight Intestine and part of the
Colon, Fig. 11.. a. And another nerve, descending from this enfolding, is
carried under the lowest part of the same straight Intestine, Fig. 11. b. which
also, two shoots carried from the infoldings placed in the Pelvis or Basin,
meet, Fig. 11. d. d. It will not be hard to declare the uses of this enfolding
and its nerves: because all those nervous passages are emptied about the
offices and motions of the straight Intestine. The ascending nerve directs the
Vermiculations of the same straight Intestine, as also of the lower part of the
Colon, and then (the greatest enfolding of the Mesentery mediating) of some
other Intestines to be made downwards; but the descending nerve, in opposition
to the other, drawing the lowest part of the straight Intestine upwards, takes
care that the Excrements being carried toward the Arse-hole, may not slide out
suddenly and unexpectedly. Then forasmuch as two nerves from the two infoldings
placed within the Basin or Tunnel, (which infoldings immediately admitting a
noted Vertebral branch, are partakers of the spontaneous Function) meet with
this descending nerve, and are ingraffed into it; it comes to pass from all of
them together, that the Excrements being detained at the doors, when it shall
be convenient, the Appetite commanding, are cast out. Nature, that it might
shun filthiness, is so careful, that for the carrying out of the Excrements it
constitutes nervous Vessels, with as noted a provision, as for the performing
any where of the most splendid offices.

From the lowest Enfolding of the Abdomen, two nerves being sent into the
Tunnel, receive there on both sides a noted Vertebral Nerve; and so constitute
two infoldings, to wit, one in either side, Fig. 11. C.C. K.K. These infoldings
near the doors, placed before the chief excretory passages, serve for the
opening and shutting them: a Vertebral branch comes to either as a supply; by
which it comes to pass, that besides the increasing the forces of the Spirits,
their acts flowing from these infoldings, become in some measure spontaneous.
By what means and for what end, the nerve ascending from either enfolding, is
bestowed on the straight Intestine, was shown but now. Moreover, two descending
on both sides, are carried into the neck or porch of the Womb, Fig. 11. e. g.
Without doubt, whatever of sense or motion is made about the Venereal acts, is
owed to the influence of the Spirits through these Nerves. In Men the
delightful profusion of the Genital humor, and in Women the no less pleasant
reception of the same depends on the action of those nerves. Lastly, from the
same enfolding another nerve descending and broken into certain shoots, is
distributed on both sides into the Bladder and its Sphincter, Fig. 11. f.
Certainly by these nerves the business of making water is performed, and when
at any time the same is painful, the troublesome sense is impressed on them. But
forasmuch as the nerves dedicated to the several Excretions proceed on both
sides from the same enfolding, therefore the acts of them all are in some
measure alike among themselves, so indeed, that if any excretory passage should
be weak or ill affected, it sends forth its charge which it should keep,
whether it will or no. This is so well known, that there is no need to
illustrate the matter with instances.

These Nerves and Infoldings being so made, there is not much business besides
left for the intercostal pair. About the beginning of the Os Sacrum, both
Trunks inclining mutually one to the other, communicate among themselves by a
cross shoot or two, then they end in very small Fibers, which are distributed
into the Sphincter of the Anus, Fig. 11. q. r. s. Here the intercoast pair is
after the same manner, as we have observed concerning the wandering pair; to
wit, either nerve being brought to the end of its course, before they enter
upon their last task, incline themselves to mutual embraces. Concerning the
last offices of either pair, this Conformity may be also noted; that whenas the
Viscera dedicated to Chylification, to wit, the Ventricle and Intestines, are
still continued to the last by the same passage and the same perpetual cavity
or hollowness; the first doors of this Cavity, to wit, the Orifices of the
Ventricle, are kept by the lowest branches of the wandering pair joined among
themselves; but before the last door of the same, to wit, the Sphincter of the
Anus, the extremities of the intercostal pair, also before joined among
themselves, are placed. But to this part, as if it had never provided enough
for it, besides the nerves sent hither from either enfolding next above, and
these extreme productions of the intercostal pair bestowed on it, a branch also
and certain fibers from the Vertebral nerve are inserted, Fig. 11. i. k. By the
access of which it comes to pass, that the shutting and opening of this
door-keeping Muscle becomes spontaneous. Truly many nerves, and those of a
diverse kind, are distributed into the Sphincter of the Anus, to wit, because
the nutritious Juice and its stinking recrements, like a certain Chemical
matter, are digested within the Intestines, as it were within a Matrace;
therefore Nature, which best understands Chemistry, is very careful about the
well-stopping the mouths of the Vessels.

From the same Nerve, viz. the last Vertebral, out of which a branch disperses
fibers into the Sphincter of the Anus, two other Nerves proceed, which are
carried into the Yard, Fig. 11. l. m. The greater of these, which is very large
and long, is distributed into the nervous Body of it; the other lesser, into
its Muscles. This member, because it receives nerves only from the spinal
Marrow, according to our Hypothesis, ought to swell up and to be moved only at
the spontaneous pleasure of the will: but that oftentimes, by reason of the
swelling up of the Genital seed or humor, it is erected and blown up with
Spirit, whether one will or no, that is caused chiefly for this reason, Because
from this Vertebral pair, from whence the nerves of the Yard arise, a nervous
process is stretched out into the Vertebral pair next above it: in which the
enfolding, placed in the Tunnel, imparting nerves to the Prostatae, is
radicated, Fig. 11. I. K. into which enfolding also a noted nerve from the
intercostal pair is implanted. When therefore a communication is had between
the Prostatae, which depend much on the intercostal Nerves and the Yard, (by
reason of the roots of either being joined together by the nervous process) it
comes to pass, that the action of this follows the affection of those parts:
but those parts, viz. the Prostatae, are apt to be moved not only by the
turgescency of the Seed, but also by the passage of the intercostal Nerve are
wont to be irritated with too unseasonable an action, according to the
impressions made by the Senses or the Brain; into the consent of which
presently the Yard is excited.

Concerning the Nerves which belong to the Testicles, here is not much to be
spoken; for we have often sought in vain for a great company of nervous
passages in them: I have very diligently searched sometimes in Man, also in a
Fox, Dog, Calf, and likewise in a Boar and Monkey, but could never find
belonging to them but one nerve carried from the Vertebral pair, which also for
the most part is bestowed on the Cremasteral Muscle, Fig. 11. M. so that,
although an excellent humor is prepared within those parts, yet it does not
easily appear, that its matter is derived thither through the nerves; for we
think the Genital humor is no more dispensed by the nerves than the nutritious.
For truly it seems, that the Arteries instill a spirituous liquor into the
Testicles after the same manner as in the Brain; wherefore in their
neighborhood these sanguiferous Vessels being very much divaricated or spread
abroad, are turned about into little serpentine channels, whereby they subtilize
the humor destinated to the Testicles, and insinuate it, having put off all
thickness and Feculency, and being truly sublimated, into their substance;
because there, as within the Cortex of the Brain, the spirituous liquor being
imbued with a volatile Salt implanted in the part, passes into the most noble
Clyssus, viz. the Genital humor. But here is not a place to discourse more
largely of the nature and origin of the Seed: yet because it is commonly
objected, That the Seed is made of the nervous Juice and plenty of Spirits
fetched from the Brain, and therefore a large expense of it does induce quickly
on the Brain and Nerves a great debility and enervation; I say, this comes to
pass, because after great profusions of the Seed, for the restoration of the
same humor, (of which Nature is more solicitous than for the benefit of the
individual) presently greater Tributes of the spirituous Liquor are required
from the blood to be laid up into the Testicles: wherefore the Brain is made
languid, being defrauded of its due stock and afflux of the same spirituous
liquor; and the Spirits influencing it and the nervous System, because they are
deficient in the Fountain it self, are very much depauperated and become
flagging. Besides we may add, That the animal Spirits also which actuate the
Prostatae coming from the spinal Marrow, are consumed about the Venereal acts
very much; so that the Loins are also enervated for this reason.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of the Spinal Nerve an Accessory to the wandering Pair; also of
the Nerve of the Diaphragma.
AFter we have unfolded the Nerves of the wandering and intercostal pair, which
being Executers of the involuntary Function, are stretched out to the
Praecordia and all the Viscera of the middle and lower Belly, and also to some
other parts: Next to these follow some other Nerves communicating with the
aforesaid in their beginning, or in the exercise of the same office, viz. the
spinal Nerve and the Nerve of the Diaphragma; of which we will speak in order.

We have already shown, that the Nerve of the wandering pair in the beginning is
made up of numerous Fibers: to which is joined another noted Nerve arising from
afar, and being ingraffed with them, goes forth together with them out of the
Skull. Concerning this Nerve, because the beginning and distribution of it
being very irregular, have not as yet been noted by other Anatomists, it may
seem worth our labor to make a little more diligent inquiry. Therefore if we
would search into the beginning of this nerve, that is found beginning with a
sharp point in the side of the spinal Marrow nigh the sixth or seventh
Vertebrae of the Neck, Fig. 12. C. C. But being increased in its ascent, is no
where inserted into the medullar Trunk, but in its whole tract on both sides
leans on its side, to which it is knit by certain admitted Fibers toward the
superficies. This arising up from the Neck after this manner, and being carried
within the Skull, is joined to the Fibers of the wandering pair, and is
ingraffed with them seeming to grow together into one Trunk, and goes out with
them at the same hole from the Skull; which being passed through, the spinal
Nerve presently departing from the Trunk of the wandering pair, is at length
reflected outward, Fig. 9... This stranger or traveling nerve after a short
commerce having left his companion, is carried upon the Muscles of the Neck, to
which it imparts some shoots, and is inoculated with a certain shoot of the
tenth pair; but from thence being carried on further, it goes alone by a long
passage, till it comes to the Scapular Muscle, on which it is almost wholly
bestowed, Fig. 9.. This nerve is found constantly, not only in Man and
four-footed Beasts, but also in Fowls and Fishes; and in these it seems to be
destinated instead of Arms, and for the moving of their wings and fins.

Concerning the use of this Nerve, and the reason of its irregular beginning,
we shall conjecture after this manner: Forasmuch as that is destinated for the
performing the motions of the Muscles belonging to the Arms and Neck, therefore
it ought to arise out of the spinal Marrow: but that it is not carried by a
direct and near way into its Province, but being carried about by a long
compass before it enters upon its task, communicates in its beginning with the
nerve of the wandering pair; certainly this seems to be done, to the end that
this Spinal nerve, being carried into the parts of the wandering pair, might
perform the acts of the Function only involuntary. And indeed it may be
observed, That besides the spontaneous motions wherewith the Neck and Arms are
wont to be employed with the previous intention of doing this or that thing,
those parts also, before any other member, are affected with pathetick and
sudden motions, according to the force of the Passions, the animal not being
conscious of it. For almost all living Creatures do not only turn about their
necks at any noise to behold whatever might cause fear; but they being any ways
affrighted in the twinkling of an eye fly away, their feet, wings, fins, or
other part answerable to them, being set into a rapid motion. The Neck and the
Arms are pliable or observant, not only to fear, but in like manner to the
other Passions. For brute Animals, as well as Man, being puffed up with pride
or anger, (as we have elsewhere intimated) have their Necks swollen, and their
Crests lifted up: But as to Man, his hands and arms are so obsequious to the
Passions, and almost to all the conceptions of the Brain, that they are
continually agitated in the doing of any other thing with various gestures,
whereof we are ignorant or not willing them: we scarcely think or speak any
thing but at the same time the hands are flung out here and there; and whilst
the Tongue hesitates or sticks, or the words at it were stick between the Jaws,
the right hand is exercised, as if by its gesture it were endeavoring to draw
out more swiftly the sense of the mind. Truly that these parts, to wit, the
Hands and Arms, do so nearly conspire with the Affections of the Brain and
Heart in their motions in some measure in all living Creatures, but more
eminently in Man, the cause seems to be this nerve's coming from the spinal
Marrow to the beginning of the wandering pair, and communicating with its
nerves, and receiving from them as it were the note or private mark of the
involuntary Function.

So much for the spinal Nerve, which also like a shrub, growing from other
shrubs, has no peculiar origin, but having received various fibers, is
radicated for the greatest part in the spinal Marrow, and (as has been shown)
partly in the nerve of the wandering pair. Concerning the nerve of the
Diaphragma, (of which we shall speak next) many things occur no less worthy
remarking. As to its beginning, it may be observed, That it arises from the
brachial nerves with a double or triple root; to wit, two or three shoots going
out of the aforesaid nerves, grow together into the same Trunk, which is the
nerve of the Diaphragma. In man its first shoot, which is also the greatest, is
produced out of the second Vertebral nerve; and when the first brachial nerve
arises from the same handful of Vertebral nerves going out at this place, the
aforesaid shoot is rooted in its origin: wherefore, when in Brutes the first
brachial nerve arises from the fourth or fifth Vertebral, the nerve of the
Diaphragma also begins its rise far lower: two other shoots arise out of the
same stocks of the brachial nerves which follow next, Fig. 9. Y. ph. But the
Trunk which is made out of these shoots goes forward single through the passage
of the Neck and the cavity of the Thorax without any branching forth, even to
the Diaphragma, Fig. 9 chapter where being at last stretched out into three or four
shoots, it is inserted on either side to the fleshy or musculous part of it: so
that, because the Diaphragma is a Muscle, and performs both its motions, to
wit, Systole and Diastole by its own Fibers, the office of either nerve is only
to carry bands or forces of animal Spirits requisite for the indiscontinued
action of that part, and also to convey thither the Instincts of the Motions
variously to be performed.

As to the first use of this Nerve, viz. for the passage of the animal Spirits,
the business is performed in this Muscle, as it is in the Heart. The Spirits
flowing into the Diaphragma by the nerves, receive subsidiary Forces, to wit, a
sulphurous Copula from the blood, upon whose explosion being still iterated by
turns, and the receiving of new, the action of this perpetual moveable depends.
Concerning the Instincts of the Motions transmitted by the passage of this
double nerve, we may observe, That they are, especially in man, of a double
kind: viz. either the action of the Diaphragma merely natural for the
performing of Respiration, is continually reciprocated according to the uses of
the Heart and Lungs, and altered many ways in their tenor according to their
needs, or secondly, a certain irregular and unusual motion of the Diaphragma is
wont to be excited at the beck of the Appetite, or from the instigations of
other parts; for the which, whilst the rest of the Organs of Respiration are
compelled to conspire, the act it self of Respiration becomes after a various
manner interrupted or unequal.

1. As to the first of these, viz. the unforced motion of this Muscle, it may
be observed, That the Diaphragma, with the Muscles of the Thorax and the parts
of either, conspire in their motion with the action of the Lungs and Heart: and
that between all these such a joint action may be sustained, it is observed,
That three or four branches are sent out from the Vertebral nerves, in the
branches of which the nerve of the Diaphragma is rooted, into the intercostal
enfolding, Fig. 9. T. and whereas from this enfolding the nerves are carried
into the Muscles of the Thorax, by this means a communication and consent of
action is effected between these and the Diaphragma. Therefore the Diaphragma
drawing with it self the Muscles of the Thorax, by reason of other nerves,
conspires with the Praecordia. These in man going from the intercostal nerve,
are already described; and in Brutes from the lower enfolding of the wandering
pair a nerve is sent down into the enfolding of the Thorax, to which besides so
many shoots and certain fibers reaching forth into the nerve of the Diaphragma,
are instead of such a commerce.

2. The Anomal and irregular motions of the Diaphragma proceed from various
causes and from the diverse instigation of other parts, which also in man become
much more signal than in brute Animals; because in him the communication is
notable by the nerves reaching out from the Cervical enfolding of the
intercostal pair into the nerve of the Diaphragma; which kind of enfolding and
nerves are wanting in Brutes.

As to the Species themselves of irregular motions into which the motion of the
Diaphragma is wont to be perverted, it may be observed, That we are able at our
pleasure to stop breathing or respiration for some space, and presently to take
it or draw it out. In laughing, weeping, and singing sometimes the Systole,
sometimes the Diastole becomes stronger, and is made frequenter upward or
downward with a repeated shaking; which sort of actions of it are made by
reason of those near commerces had between the nerve of the Diaphragma and
other respective parts of the Breast and Face: yea indeed from hence it is
effected, (as we have already shown) that man is peculiarly a laughing
Creature. Further, (which we have shown elsewhere) from the Sympathy which
happens between the parts of the Mouth and Face with the Diaphragma by those
nerves, a good reason of sneezing may be given, and that Problem of Aristotle's
easily solved, to wit, why men alone, or chiefly before other Creatures,
sneeze: For the act of sneezing seems to be made for this end, that man may not
only clear his Nose, but that all Torpor or heaviness may be shook off for him
from the neighboring Organs of the Senses, yea and from all the forepart of
the Brain: which thing easily succeeds, if the Membranes and nervous passages
besmearing the Nostrils and the Sieve-like Bone, like the holes of a Sponge,
being strongly wrung forth or squeezed together, be forced to shed forth their
moistures; for these parts so emptied, presently like a pressed Sponge, receive
other humors, to wit, those coming from the neighboring parts. In the mean
time, that the watery heap so laid up about the caverns of the Nostrils, may be
emptied, it ought to be carried away, or wiped out from thence by a vehement
blowing of the Air or breath. Wherefore it is observed, That whilst the inward
parts of the Nostrils being very sensible, begin to be wrinkled together from
some sharp thing pulling or pricking them, and by that means to draw out the
watery humor presently by reason of the passage from thence by the branches of
the fifth pair into the intercostal Trunk, and from thence by the passage of
the nerves which are extended from its Cervical enfolding into the nerve of the
Diaphragma, the consent of the same Action or Convulsion is produced even into
the cross bound or Midriff; so that by the same Act as it were with which the
Nostrils are wrinkled, the Diaphragma also with the Diastole being stronger and
longer draw out, is depressed, that the Breast being dilated as much as may be,
the Air may be the more copiously inspired. Then as soon as the Spasm or
Convulsion of the Membranes, drawn together within the Nostrils and forepart
of the Head, begins to remit, presently the Midriff leaping back with a force,
causes the inspired Air to be violently exploded or driven out, which strongly
wipes away and carries forth with it the humor pressed out within the caverns
of the Nostrils.

We yet ought to inquire concerning the Nerve of the Diaphragma, what is the
reason, that it always proceeds from the Brachial nerves, and why it does not
rather arise immediately from the spinal Marrow. Truly from hence it seems to
follow, that the motion of the Arms in some sort respects the action of the
Diaphragma; or on the contrary, that this depends on that. Indeed between these
two a certain respect or habitude happens; which easily appears by this
Argument: The Arms or fore Legs in all Creatures are made for labor and hard
exercise; because by the force of these men fight, and perform the most hard
and laborious things, and Brutes run and ascend the most steep places with
great pains. But it is very well known, that by too much labor and
over-vehement motion of body, the act of Respiration is very much increased, so
that the breath almost fails, and is oftentimes in danger to be lost. The
reason of this is, because by great exercise the blood is too much forced into
the bosom of the Heart, which, lest it should suffocate it, that it might be
emptied into the Lungs, very frequent and difficult Respiration is instituted.
Therefore from hence may be inferred, That the exercises of the Body ought to
be regulated according to the state of the Praecordia; or that the motion of
the Arms should observe the action of the Diaphragma, viz. lest they being
stirred by a violent motion, cause the blood to be driven more into the bosoms
of the Heart, than the Diaphragma instituting a most frequent Respiration, can
draw from thence into the Lungs. That this Rule may be perpetually observed of
all living Creatures it is so provided, that the nerve of the Diaphragma,
chiefly conducing to Respiration, should be tied, as it were a bridle, to the
Brachial nerves, which are the principal in the motion of the Body, and so
might timely warn these, if unmindful of their duty, and as soon as breath
fails, should command them to desist from further moving the Body. Wherefore we
observe, when at any time laboring Cattle are urged beyond their strength in
labor or motion, oftentimes either some deadly hurt of the heart follows, or
else some uncurable disease of the Diaphragma; for by such immoderate labor,
either the Beast languishing quickly dies, when it is commonly said, that his
heart is broke; or else the tone of the Diaphragma being wholly broken,
Respiration ever after becomes painful and difficult: which is wont to happen
ordinarily to Horses, who are driven into too rapid a course with a full Belly.

CHAP. XXIX. Of the Reason of the difference that happens between the Nerves of
the wandering and Intercostal Pair in Man and brute Beasts; also of the other
Pairs of the Nerves arising both within the Skull, and from the Spinal Marrow:
also something of the Blood-carrying Vessels which belong to the Spinal Marrow.
THus far we have described all the Nerves stretching out to the Praecordia and
Viscera, also to most of the other parts, which are the Organs of the
involuntary Function, according to the manner by which they are wrought in man;
and we have shown their Offices and Uses, and the Reasons of the most noted
appearances in all. Before we proceed to the other Conjugations of the Nerves,
it behooves us to show with what difference the aforesaid Nerves are found in
brute Beasts, and for what end such a difference is ordained.

It was already intimated, That the Trunk of the wandering pair in four-footed
Beasts does send forth to the Heart and its Appendix more nervous Vessels than
in Man. The reason of which is obvious; because the Cardiack nerves in Brutes
proceed almost only from this pair, and scarce at all from the intercostal;
wherefore when they are only of one origination, therefore more are required,
all which notnotwithstanding are much fewer than the same are in Man from a
double stock, viz. being carried from both the Nerves: forasmuch as Beasts want
prudence, and are not much obnoxious to various and diverse Passions, therefore
there was no need that the Spirits should be derived from the Head into the
Praecordia by a double passage, viz. that one should be required for the
exercise of the vital Function, and the other for the reciprocating impressions
of the Affections; but that it may suffice, that all those destinated to every
one of their offices, may be carried still in the same path.

In most Brutes the intercostal Nerve goes alone from the Ganglioform enfolding
of it almost without any branching to its enfolding of the Thorax: in which
passage however it is not always after the same manner in all; for in some it
is carried single and apart from the Trunk of the wandering pair, nor does it
communicate with it in its whole journey, unless a little higher by a shoot
sent down from the Ganglioform enfolding: but in many the intercostal Nerve
passes presently from its Ganglioform enfolding into the neighboring enfolding
of the wandering pair, Fig. 10. C. where, when both the nerves seem to close
together, from thence both being involved under the same common enclosure, as
it were one Trunk, they are carried together till it comes over against the
first Rib, and there an enfolding being made, the intercostal nerve, departing
from the wandering pair, is carried into the enfolding of the Thorax; and the
other nerve also is stretched between this and that enfolding: which nerves,
when one is carried under the other above the Artery of the Chanel-bone, making
as it were an handle, straiten its Trunk, Fig. 10. g.

Although the intercostal Nerve is carried from the Throat to the top of the
Thorax under the same sheath with the Trunk of the wandering pair, yet it is not
united to it; but they remain distinct still both of them in the whole tract,
and the Membrane being dissected, they easily separate one from the other,
unless they be knit together by some fibrils sent from one another in some
places: but forasmuch as by this means the intercostal nerve being joined to
the Trunk of the wandering pair, goes under its cover, it seems to be so made
only for its safety and better passage: wherefore in some perhaps where the
intercostal Trunk is greater, or the course of its passage shorter, where such
a safeguard is not needful, it descends alone. We have seen this Nerve covered
with the safeguard of the wandering pair of one side, and in the other to have
gone out by it self alone.

Whether the intercostal Nerve departs from the lower Enfolding of the wandering
pair or not, however a branch is stretched out between this enfolding and that
of the Thorax in many, perhaps in all brute Beasts, which in its passage binds
about the Vertebral Artery, whereby the Sympraxis or joint Action between the
Praecordia and the exterior Organs of Respiration is sustained: yea from this
lower enfolding of the wandering pair sometimes we have observed a shoot and
fibers to be carried to the beginning of the Brachial branch, in which the
nerve of the Diaphragma is rooted; also sometimes, though rarely, we have seen
some shoots sent from the enfolding of the Thorax toward the Heart and its
Appendix. In a Monkey above this enfolding of the Thorax, as we have intimated
before, were some shoots and small branches reaching from the intercostal nerve
toward the Praecordia.

We may take notice concerning those Nerves below the Praecordia, distributed
every where into the Ventricle and the lower Viscera, that there is scarce any
difference of them in Man and Beasts. The nerve of the Diaphragma is placed
lower in four-footed beasts: the reason of which is, because the Brachial
nerves, out of which that ought to proceed, arise lower; to wit, because Brutes
have longer necks, as if destinated to the yoke. These things being thus
premised concerning the difference of the Nerves in either Species, it remains
that we pass on to the unfolding the remaining pairs of them.

Therefore of those arising within the Skull, the ninth pair is made up of many
Fibers also in its beginning, (as was showed before) out of which being
gathered together one Trunk being made is carried toward the Tongue, through
whose whole substance, to wit, from the bottom to the top, having passed, it
disperses in its whole passage small shoots on either side, Fig. 9. s. So that
nothing is more obvious than that this nerve performs the motions of the Tongue
requisite for the articulation of Sounds, as the nerves of the fifth pair
spread into this member, serve for the distinguishing of Tastes; for the
exercise of either Faculty, viz. both motive and sensitive, the texture of the
Tongue being notedly fibrous, has the virtue of a double Organ; therefore by
the two nerves, besides the supplements of Spirits, are carried both the
Instincts of the Motion and the sensible Impressions.

That the aforesaid Nerves of the ninth pair may more easily perform the
motions of the Tongue, it sends forth downwards one shoot before the entrance
of the Tongue, which is united with a shoot from the tenth pair meeting it
destinated to the Sternothyroeidal Muscle; and the other little branch of the
ninth Conjugation is distributed into the Muscles of the Bone Hyoides, Fig. 9.
T.. In truth these shoots being sent down as so many little ropes, conduce to
the moving of the Muscles, which are fixed to the bottom of the Tongue, which
Muscles being placed as so many Props to the Tongue, do facilitate its motion.

The Nerve of the tenth pair, although it may seem to arise within the Skull
with many little Fibers also, yet being sent down from thence into the bony
Cloisters of the Spine, not arising but within the first and second Vertebrae,
it is carried without. Presently after its entrance it sends forth two nerves
into the enfolding of the intercostal nerve; for what end has been already
shown: But its chief Trunk spreading downwards, and receiving a shoot produced
from the ninth pair, is bestowed on the Sternothyroeidal Muscle. Moreover, this
nerve reflects branches outward, which are distributed into the Muscles of the
Neck reaching out toward the hinder part of the Head; so this pair, as if it
were only of the number or rank of the Vertebral nerves, imparts some branches
to the intercostal nerve, and all the other shoots and branches of it serve for
the performing of the motions of the Muscles of the Neck, Fig. 9. H....

So much for the Nerves arising within the Skull, which (as was shown) having
their being from the parts of the Brain or Cerebel, are destinated to the
offices of the spontaneous or the involuntary Function, and are chiefly
distributed into the Organs of the Senses or the Viscera of the vital and
natural Faculty. There remain many other Conjugations of Nerves, the roots or
beginnings of which consist in the spinal Marrow, which is only the exterior
production of the oblong Marrow. These spinal Nerves, besides some branches
that they bestow on the intercostal pair, are employed almost wholly on the
musculous stock, and the office of them is to carry outwardly the forces of the
Spirits and the Instincts of the Motions to be performed, and to convey
inwardly the impressions of sensible things. Forasmuch as the spinal Marrow
seems to be derived from the Brain, and is as it were a broad and high road
produced or leading from the same, without any paths or tracts inserted to it
from the Cerebel, therefore the animal Spirits flowing within its nerves, do
almost wholly execute the Acts of the spontaneous Function.

To describe all the several pairs of the spinal Nerves, and to rehearse all
their branchings, and to unfold the uses and actions of them, would be a work
of an immense labor and trouble: and as this Neurologie cannot be learned nor
understood without an exact knowledge of the Muscles, we may justly here
forbear entering upon its particular institution: but it may suffice concerning
these nerves and their medullar beginning, that we advertise only in general
what things may occur most notable and chiefly worth taking notice of.

As to the Nerves therefore produced out of the spinal Marrow, it may be
observed, That in both sides of it, nigh the outward margin or brim, four or
five Fibers arise in the superior brim, and as many in the inferior: either
maniple or handful pass through with distinct Fibers the Pia Matter, or the
lowest Coat of the spinal Marrow, which is as it were the common sheath of them
all; but afterward the Fibers passing through the third Membrane of either
margin, (for three cloth the spinal Marrow) they join together, and having
clothed themselves with a Coat gotten from the second Membrane, they become as
it were one Trunk; which Trunk going out at the space between the knot of the
Vertebrae, is again divided into many nerves destinated to several parts. After
this manner in the whole tract of the spinal Marrow, the Vertebral nerves have
their birth; but in those places where the Brachial and the Crural nerves go
out, both the thickness and the breadth of the spinal Marrow are increased, and
also the handfuls or bands of the Fibers are larger. All these are well
represented in Fig. 12.

The Brachial Nerves are not only far greater than the Vertebrals, so that they
appear as it were large and broad nervous chords; but that they may conspire
together, and serve for the strong motions of the Arms, or the fore Legs of
Beasts, it is observed, That very many of them are knit together by the cross
nervous Processes. These Processes in four-footed Beasts (the fore Legs of whom
are destinated for unweariable pains and difficult lobour) are produced
cross-ways after a curious manner, as may be discerned, Fig. 10. l. l. The use
of these seems to sustain not only the consent of action in many nerves
together, but also their mutual strength; that some bands of Spirits might
awaken or stir up others, and for the exercising strongly the locomotive force,
they might mutually support and relieve one another. And not much unlike this,
the business is about the Crural Nerves, where nervous cords signally large,
being produced from the Junctures of the Vertebrae, whilst they descend toward
the Thigh, they which are above receive in their whole tract the nervous
Processes which are sent out still from those below, Fig. 11. p. p. p.

We may yet take notice farther concerning the spinal Marrow, that as it sends
out Nerves by bands, and as it were by troops, in an orderly series and
military order; so its sanguiferous Vessels are disposed with no less signal
artifice. For those which are carried in the superficies of the spinal Marrow,
and the Arteries, Veins, and other Sanguiducts, which are nigh its compass, do
contain some things more rare and highly worth the noting.

In the first place we may observe, That the blood-carrying Vessels do cloth
the whole substance or frame of the spinal Marrow, as well as the oblong Marrow
with a thick series of shoots; which may be made more manifest to any one, if
first of all Ink were injected into the Vertebral Artery; for from such an
injection often repeated, it will easily appear, that the infoldings of the
Vessels do cover as it were in the shape of a Net, the upper tract of the
Marrow. But by what means these Vessels proceed on both sides from the Trunk of
the Vertebral Artery, and also the blood-carrying Veins, which are destinated
to the whole spinal Marrow, and the inferior portion of its arterious passages,
does not so plainly appear; because the bony Cloisters of the Vertebrae are not
broken through without much labor, especially in grown up living Creatures;
and in that work the beginnings and branchings out of very many Vessels are
wont to be blotted out: But that we might more accurately search into these hid
things, we made the Dissections of several Embryons, in which we were able to
dissect the Vertebrae as yet soft, and to take out of them the Marrow whole,
and to look more narrowly into all the recesses of the Bones: further, that all
the tracts and branchings out of them might be the better perceived in all the
Vessels, we did cast in diverse colored Liquors. And we had our desired wish:
for presently we found with much admiration, that those kind of Vessels, viz.
Arteries, Bosoms, and Veins, which respect the Head, belong also to the spinal
Marrow with no less a noted disposition of provision.

When we did dissect the Heads apart from the Spine, we did think, according to
the Opinion of the Vulgar, that the Vertebral Arteries did belong only to the
Head: and when there did appear in the cut off Trunk of the oblong Marrow three
arterious branches (as they are described above in the first and second Table)
therefore in the Explication of either Figure we have affirmed the Vertebral
Artery to be carried with a triple branch into the hinder part of the Head. But
the Vertebral Artery pays to the superior part of the Spine as great Tributes
of Blood as to the Head it self; and that middle arterious branch, which is
marked in the first Figure with the Letter T, in the second with S, does not
ascend into the Head, but descends from that concourse of Vertebral Arteries
toward the Spine, and conveys downward from the common flowing together of the
blood there made by many Arteries, the Latex for the watring the top of the
spinal Marrow. Wherefore in this place it seems convenient, that we do not only
correct that error of ours, but that we deliver an exact Description of all
the Vessels which are destinated to the Spine, viz. which contain many
wonderful things. As therefore these Vessels are of a threefold kind, viz.
Arteries, Bosoms, and Veins, we will expose each of them particularly; and
first concerning the Arteries we say,

The Arteries which carry the Blood toward the Spine, are disposed after one
manner above the Heart, and after another below it. As to the first, whereas
the Trunk of the Aorta being there cleft presently into many branches, departs
from the Region of the Spine, therefore the Vertebral Artery is produced on
both sides from its axillary branches, which ascending straight into the hinder
part of the Head, sends forth a branch into the meeting together of every
Vertebra: But below the Heart, forasmuch as the Aorta, in its whole descent,
lies on the Spine, two Arteries are received into the Spine from its bottom
nigh its Internodia or spaces between the knots of the Vertebra; so that if the
Trunk of the Aorta be cut open long-ways, there will appear a series of double
holes through its whole tract, after a most curious manner, as in the head of a
Lamprey.

The arterious Branches which are carried both above and below the Heart
toward the Spine, becoming presently forked, bestow one shoot on the
neighboring Muscles, and another they insert into the Junctures of the
Vertebrae; which being carried within the bony Den, is cleft presently into
three branches, two of which are bestowed on the medullar Trunk, and the other
on the Membrane compassing about the bony Den before, Tab. 13. Fig. 3. a. b. c.
d. e.

As to the shoots destinated to the medullar Trunk, they presently tending two
ways, and meeting with either maniple or band of nervous Fibers, ascend toward
their beginnings; and so one little Artery having got to the superficies of the
hinder Marrow, distributes into it hairy Vessels: but the other arterious
shoot, which is the greater and chiefest, as soon as it attains the margin of
the former Marrow, is carried from thence by an oblique passage into the middle
fissure or cleft of it, where meeting with a shoot of the pair of the other
side, it is united to the same, and from that joining together the arterious
Trunk, as it were a common passage, and made up of either Vertebral shoot,
descends into that cleft by the open space of one of the Vertebrae, and in that
short passage both dispenses little Arteries on either side, and also inserts
them leaning on the Pia Matter more deeply betwixt the sides of the Marrow: and
so whereas in the whole tract of the Marrow, the chief Trunk of every Artery is
carried into the middle cleft, it seems at first sight, as if the same
arterious Trunk were carried under the whole substance of the Marrow from the
head to the tail, Tab. 13. Fig. 1. Further, as by a concourse of several shoots
of either side, the spinal Artery descends above the cleft of the Marrow; so
where the Trunks of the Vertebral Arteries join together (which happens to be
done sometimes in the hinder part of the Head above the oblong Marrow, and
often in the Neck above the spinal) an arterious branch somewhat bigger than
the rest is stretched out downwards. This formerly (as we mentioned but now) we
mistook for the third ascending branch of the Vertebral Artery. But I have
often taken notice, that in Brutes, where the Vertebral Arteries have met
together with an acute Angle above the medullar Trunk, they are presently,
departing one from another, stretched out directly to either brim of the
Marrow, from whence immediately being bent back, they are carried again into a
mutual meeting, so that between their two joynings together is made the figure
Rhomboides, as it is in Tab. 13. Fig. 1. C. The reason of which without doubt
is this; to wit, that the more rapid course of the blood going toward the Head
might be hindered by its flood being a little space divided.

The third Branch of either Vertebral Artery being carried into the anterior
Cavity of the bony Den, and being presently made forked, tends to the right and
left, and is on both sides inoculated to the next shoot of the same side and by
the cross process, they of either side are united after the same manner; and so
all the Arteries of this cense or rank receive one another mutually, as it were
links of a chain, in the whole tract of the Spine, and are continued in the
same bending passage. If Ink be cast into the Trunk of the Vertebral Artery and
most of the hollownesses of the Aorta, all these Arteries, dyed with the same,
will appear a pleasant spectacle, like Network, as may be seen Tab. 13. Fig. 3.

The top of this arterious Enfolding being carried into the Skull, inserts two
shoots sent forth straight into the wonderful Net, and imparts two others going
out sideways on both sides to the Dura Matter: the lower end of the same
reaching to the Os Sacrum, ends in very small Vessels which serve for the
Membrane of the Bones.

If it should be asked, For what end these Arteries being concatenated with
such frequent ingraffings are disposed within the Backbone: This seems to be
so ordained for three uses: viz. First, These Vessels (as also the passages of
the Bosoms) are divaricated after this manner with repeated compassing about,
that a constant heat from the blood being so turned about, as it were into
frequent Whirlpools, might be supplied about the compass of the spinal Marrow,
as it were by a Balneum Mariae; even such a manner of office as the Choroeidal
enfolding performs within the enfolding of the Brain. Secondly, Care is taken
by this means, lest the blood destinated for the spinal Marrow, might flow
thither too plentifully, of might be defective in its due influx; for the blood
being about to flow into the medullar stock plentifully, is diverted from the
little branches c. d. into these Emissaries e. f. and in its defect the
subsidiary provision being called out of the middle enfolding through the
chanel e. into the Vessels c. d. is derived into the same medullar Trunk.
Thirdly, The use of this arterious enfolding seems to be, that the blood may be
distributed from its passages into the Membranes, viz. which is carried every
where from them through the Capillary Vessels; the relics of which also are
supped back by the little channels sent out of the bosoms. Further, from this
Storehouse, if necessity urges, a certain provision is had for the wants of
the Brain; wherefore from hence the small Vessels end in the wonderful Net.

So much for the Arteries distributed about the Spine or Backbone: the Vessels
of the second sort are the Bosoms which come between the Arteries and the Veins
for the use of the spinal Marrow no less than of the Head it self, and are here
ordained with a more curious implication. But the reason why bosoms are
required to these more noble parts, and scarce to any in the whole Body
besides, is this; to wit, that about these bodies all manner of extravasation,
or any stagnation of the blood, might be hindered: but sometimes the Veins are
not sufficiently emptied, that they may presently receive from the Arteries the
deposited blood, and so may prohibit any flowing out of it; wherefore the
bosoms, as more fit receivers, are destinated to that office, for that their
receptacles are larger and soon emptied; and for that reason they may more
conveniently derive the blood from either medullar substance, lest it should
overflow it in the Head or Spine.

As to the Figure of the Vertebral Bosom, its passages being conform to the
arterious enfolding, are put under it in the whole tract of the Spine: for
after a like manner, in either bosom, which is extended within the cavity of
the bony Den, from the hinder part of the Head to the Os Sacrum, there is one
receiving Vessel, by whose twofold channels presently the blood is brought back
from either superficies of the Marrow into the bosom, and another carrying
back, by whose passage the same is exported into the Veins. Moreover, in many
Animals (though not in all) the bosoms on either side seem to be knit together
upon the knots between the Vertebrae by the cross processes, and so communicate
between themselves: either bosom in its top is continued into the lateral
bosoms of the Head; further, from it on both sides a passage lies open into the
Jugular Vein and into the Vertebral, Tab. 13. Fig. 4.

What the use of the aforesaid Bosom is in general was but now intimated; to
wit, that the blood deposited from the Arteries in the spinal Marrow, might be
presently emptied from thence, and be retained within the more large Cavities
of the Bosoms, till it may be transferred into the Veins being made more empty:
But the reason of the diverse sorts of implications, and the frequent
ingraffings which is found about their little channels, seems to be, that the
blood, if by chance it being plentifully heaped up within some part of the
bosom, should there stagnate, or be apt to regurgitate into the Marrow, it
might be drawn out by those frequent Emissaries here or there into the middle
or opposite side: after a like manner it is with the bosoms about the Spine, as
when a Countryman digs in his ground frequent cross Furrows for the draining
away any superfluous moisture.

There remains another use of the Vertebral Bosoms, of which we made mention
before, to wit, that the blood nigh the medullar Body, being brought through
their variously intorted Meanders, (like the arterious infoldings) might yield
heat requisite for the swift passage of the animal Spirits, as it were a
Balneum Mariae. That the bending tracts and complications of the Bosoms may be
the better seen, a certain tincture may be cast into the Vertebral Veins; and
presently that invading the passages of the bosoms and marking them, will
exhibit the appearance of a long Ladder with many little labels hanging to it.

Yea at length by those little roundles we are led to the third kind of Spinal
Vessels, which are the Veins, into which all the bosoms immediately convey
their burden, whereby they being continually emptied, may be still able to
receive fresh blood: wherefore the venous branch is stretched out by the
several joyntings of the Vertebrae into the bosom, which presently carries away
the blood laid up in it, and to be reduced toward the Heart. The Veins
designed to this office, after the example of the Arteries, are disposed after
one manner above the Heart, and after another below it. As to the first, a
branch going from the Trunk of the Vena Cava below the Chanel-bone, or the
first little Rib of the Breast, accompanies the Vertebral Artery, and ascending
by the holes of the Processes between the several Vertebrae, inserts a little
branch to the Bosom, Tab. 13. Fig. 2. h. h. h. Then the top of this Vein being
carried toward the hinder part of the Head, is continued into the Trunk of the
Bosom, and opened by the other passage into the Jugular Vein. But further, as
if these communications were not yet sufficient for the draining away the
blood, transverse branches also are stretched out between both Veins, Tab. 13.
Fig. 2. i. i. i. So manifold diverting places appear, by which it is enough and
more than enough provided, lest the blood might flow back toward the medullar
Trunk upon any occasion. Below the Heart, because the Trunk of the Vena Cava
cannot, as the Aorta, immediately lean upon the Spine, and carry shoots
straight to the same, therefore it sends forth a Vein without a Companion, out
of whose Trunk forked or twofold branches being sent forth, go forwards both to
the Muscles of both sides and to the Spine it self. Below the Kidneys, seeing
there is a space granted for the Vena Cava to be carried nigh the Spine, the
Azygos Vein ends, and from the Trunk of the greater Vein, as from that of the
Artery, the Vessels belonging to the Loins immediately proceed.

These things being lately observed concerning the blood-carrying Vessels
belonging to the Spine and the hinder part of the Head, and here inserted in
the place of an Appendix, ought to be referred to the other Doctrine of this
kind, delivered above in the eighth Chapter. In the mean time, that we may
return to our purpose, to wit, what remains of Neurologie, there is not much
more to be met with worthy note concerning the Nerves: For they, as to the
greater and chief Ramifications, are almost constantly both in Man and brute
Beasts, after the manner we have described them. Sometimes it happens, although
very rarely, concerning the divarications of the smallest Shoots and Fibers,
that there is some variety: but as to the primary Vessels, and those drawn from
them, the Configuration of every pair of Nerves is still the same or alike in
all. It now remains, that the Theory of the Nerves, hitherto drawn in words,
and so only objected to the Understanding, may also be shown to the Sense,
which will make it clearer. Wherefore we have taken care, that the engraven
Delineations of the wandering and intercostal pair of Nerves, and also of others
which are of chief note, and of the Spinal Marrow it self be plainly exhibited.
The Figures of these, although taken from a dead Example, yet after many
Dissections and a frequent comparing them together according to their several
parts, they are described as if from the life; the Lineaments of which with
Characteristical Notes, that they may be the better and more distinctly
perceived, and a large draught of every Figure, equal almost to the Scheme of
Nerves in their animated Body, we have caused to be cut: further, because the
Contents of either side and of the Cavity between, cannot be at once described
in their proper situation; therefore here it is supposed, That the Spine, with
the oblong Marrow, or the whole medullar Stock, cut in the midst is rolled out,
and both sides of it, with the pairs of the Nerves arising in the whole Tract,
is turned outward.

THE CONCLUSION.
THUS much for the Anatomy of the Brain and Cerebel, and of their Appendix,
both Medullar and Nervous, and of the Uses and Offices of all the several
Parts, of which we have largely treated. There yet remains, after we have
viewed, not only the outward Courts and Porches of this Fabric, as it were of
a certain Kingly Palace, but also its intimate Recesses and private Chambers,
that we next inquire into, what the Lady or Inhabitant of this Princely place
may be, in what part she does chiefly reside, and by what Rule and Government
she disposes and orders her Family. Then we ought to take notice, what defects
and irregularities happen to it, or to its parts and powers; then to what
injuries of changes or Diseases this Building or House, to wit, the Brain and
nervous Stock, may be obnoxious. For indeed I am as it were bound, by reason of
the Work it self, and the promise I made before, that for the Crown of the
Work, a certain Theory of the Soul of Brutes should be added after the naked
Anatomical Observations and Histories of Living Creatures, and of their
animated Parts. Truly it is but just and equal, that we enter upon this
Discourse of the Soul, and that other task of Pathologie, to wit, that the
Asperities and hard sense of our already instituted Anatomy may be sweetened
with those kind of more pleasant Speculations, as it were clothing the
Skeleton with flesh; and that the Reader being wearied by a long and troublesome
Journey, may be a little refreshed and recreated. For in truth, whatsoever of
our Work is performed without form or beauty, may seem as the Foundation of a
Building only placed on the ground, in which no elegancy or neatness does yet
shine, but that all things appear rude, and as yet built of rough and
unpolished stones. A Superstructure indeed may be promised to be put upon this
Foundation, perhaps fair and beautiful, whereby the minds of the Beholders may
be pleased and instructed. But truly this kind of work may be too hard and
great to be performed by our weakness: neither does it become me to proceed in
my undertakings, before these have undergone the Censure and chance to which
they are subject. For I fear, lest this Foundation, but now laid, should become
too weak and feeble for the sustaining an higher Fabric, at least until this
has for some time undergone the trial, by lying open to winds and storms.

AN ESSAY OF THE PATHOLOGY OF THE BRAIN AND Nervous Stock: In Which Convulsive
Diseases Are Treated of: Being the Work of THOMAS WILLIS of Christ-Church in
Oxford, Doctor in Physic, and Sidly-Professor of Natural Philosophy in that
Famous Academy.

Translated out of Latin into English, By. S.P.

LONDON, Printed by J.B. for T. Dring, at the Sign of the Harrow at
Chancery-Lane-End in Fleet Street. 1681.

The Authors Epistle Dedicatory. To the Most Reverend Father in Christ, His
Grace, Gilbert, by Divine Providence, Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate and
Metropolitan of all England, and One of His Sacred Majesty's most Honorable
Privy Council.
IT is so Ordained by the Laws, most Noble Prelate, that whatsoever shall
happen to be built upon any ones ground, it shall be his own, by right of
accession. Since therefore, to that work which I lately attempted, concerning
the gifts and Nature of the Sensitive Soul, as also the Affections of the
Brain, and nervous stock, and the various Diseases which belong to them, I had
placed the Anatomy of the humane Head for a foundation; it was altogether
necessary (this Treatise being Dedicated to your Grace) that whatsoever
building should be raised on that Foundation, should truly, and rightly be said
to be yours: And so indeed, we continue the fault, we had sometimes Committed,
and it becomes not only a step, but what is more, an obligation to the
following Crime; that at length, we seem rather to perform a Duty, the name of
a fault being lost, than to become Criminal.

But in the mean time, this matter in which I busy my self, may not be said to
be unfit for your Knowledge, or to be disagreeing to the business of the
Church, over which you most happily preside; For both those Epilepticks which
are to be met with here precipitating themselves into the water or the fire,
and those whose members variously Contracted and distorted with Spasms or
Convulsions, and those whose whole Bodies so bent, that they could not stand
upright, by and by, as if by Inspiration of the Devil* they are agitated with
Stupendous leapings, and other wonderful gesticulations. These I say, and
many other Sick men whom I here every where describe, seem not much to differ
from those whom we read of in the Evangelists, to be cured by our Lord Jesus
Christ; and although such be to be cured however Contumatious and rebellious
they are, the Physician, however Skillfull he be, ought allways to Implore the
help of the Heavenly Power, to be assisting to him, being above all the
Strength of Medicines. Therefore and by right the Disease by the Ancients
called Holy of the word Theoria, and the rest of our Pathology, as if it
contained in it a certain Divinity, explicates the Disease to be cured no less
with prayers and fastings than with Medicines, and therefore should desire
greatly to call upon the Authority of Holy men, and to be helped by the Power
of your Sanctity.

Besides it is no new thing that there should be an Entrance into the Church
through the Spittle, for that it appears, our Savior to have used almost this
method, who would for the most part, that the health of the Soul, should take
its beginning from the restored health of the Body. And truly, as the Stupid
Deliriums of Melanchollicks, the Caninish madness, and others sprung from an
infirm Brain, have driven some, both from the Communion of Saints, and from the
Society of men, if these had been profligated by the help of our Art, it would
not be dispair'd of, but that the men should not only, growing well, have left
both at once their Diseases and Errors, but also should have become Wise.

It remains, that I Supplicate the Great God, that he will render to his
Church, the peace he has happily given to the Commonwealth, that he may take
away the darkness from the eyes of the miserable people, that he may withdraw
the fury from their minds, and for a pledge and advantage of so great a
benefit, that he may long keep safe and in health, your Grace, the mighty
Pillar, and Glory of the Reformed Religion, which is Cordially desired by

Your Graces most humble and Devoted Servant, T. W.

Of Convulsive Diseases.
CHAPTER I. Of Spasms or Convulsive Motions in General.
IN handling the Convulsive Distempers, many Physicians distinguish between the
Spasme or Convulsion, and Convulsive Motion; by the first they understand a
constant Contraction, whereby the member becomes stiff and inflexible; by the
Second, swift motions, and Concussions, which, coming between, cease, and
return alternatly: But neither those who have observed these notes of
difference, nor other Authors, have taken notice that they are continual: for
that by the words Spasme, and Convulsion, they often design a certain
Spasmodick or Convulsive Affection; wherefore to distinguish it better, we will
call the former distemper with Cardan, tetanon, a continual Convulsive Cramp,
but the other Spasm, or, a Convulsive motion in general.

But that the irregular Nature, and Causes of Convulsive motion, might more
rightly have been made known, it should first have been declared, after what
manner the regular motive function, is effected in an animated Body: but the
more full Consideration of this, because it belongs to the Physiologie, or
Reasoning of the Nature, of the Brain, and Nervous stock, it is deferred to
another Discourse: For the present, we will signify in a word, as much as
shall serve for the elucidation of the matter proposed. How the regular Motion
is Effected.
That the animal Spirits are the next Instrument of regular motion, and that
their Action, or moving force, consists only, in that they being more thickly
heaped up together, in the motive part, and there spreading themselves in a
more large space, they blow it up, and intumefie it, which for that reason,
being contracted, as to its length, draws to it self the part hanging to it. In
our description of the Nerves already published, Its beginning twofold.
we have shown this kind of motion to be twofold, to wit, Spontaneous, and
merely natural, the Instinct of this is derived from the Cerebel, but of that
from the brain, but both through the pipes of the Nerves, as it were the
channels, both to the muscles, and also to the fibers, interwoven with the
membrains, and other motive parts of the Parenchyma, or Inwards; Lastly, in all
these, the various actions are so expeditiously effected, which either natural
necessity, or the rule of the will requires, by that only means, that there is
an intimate Conjunction, and communication of Duty, and most swift Commerce,
between the animal Spirits, which Constitute the Hypostasis of the sensitive
Soul, within the foresaid parts, disposed, or fitted by a continued Series. The
Subject also twofold.
But there is this notable difference between the motion of a muscle, and that
performed by other parts; for in these, the action is most often circumscribed
within the bounds of the motive body, so as its membranes only, or one part of
the inward moves another, and consequently this is moved of its neighbor: But
in the musculous stock, usually the moving part is placed in one member, and to
be moved of another next it (although within some musculous part, as the Heart
and Diaphragma, they properly for the most part move themselves only) hence the
Membranes and Inwards, are said to have as it were an intestine, and vermicular
Motion; such as wherever it is begun, the Spirits there more thickly gather
together, and Spreading themselves forth, they first intumifie this part, then
going forward another, and so farther, till at last they draw the hindermost
parts, and by this means transfer an intumifaction, and therefore a motion,
from one place to another; almost after the same manner as worms, and other
Creeping creatures make their progression. But to this motive function of the
Membranes and Inwards, if it be frequent or undiscontinued, plenty of spirits
are required, which notwithstanding execute their task calmly enough, without
tumult or great force: And indeed it is to be observed, that the Animal
Spirits, flow not more sparingly into the Membraneous Inwards, than into the
Muscles* as it appears from the more exquisite sense of those parts, and by the
manifold insertion of Nerves within them, and the diversity of divarication,
through the foldings and fibers, although in the mean time, the muscles are
watered, with a more plentiful influx of Blood: But as to the motion,
performed in the musculous stock, the heaping together, and rarefaction of the
Spirits, through the whole joynting of the motive part, suddenly, and at once
unfolded, are performed with such force, and strength, as the attraction of the
muscle, in its motive endeavor, may exceed the force of a pully or windlace;
and when this force, only depends on the expansion or rarefaction of the
Spirits, seated in the motive part, we can conceive it to be no otherwise, but
that the Spirits so expansed or stretched forth, The Motion of a Muscle is a
certain explosion of the Spirits.
as it were fired, after the manner of gunpowder, to be exploded or thrown out.
But we may suppose, that to the Spirituous Saline particles, of the spirits
inhabiting the interwoven fibers in the muscle, other nitrous-sulphureous
particles, of a diverse kind, do come, and grow intimately with them, from the
arterous blood, flowing every where within the same fibers: Then as often as
the particles of either kind, as Nitre and Sulphur combined together, by
reason of the instinct of motion brought through the nerves, are moved, as an
inkindling of fire, forthwith on the other side bursting forth, or being
exploded, they suddenly blow up the Muscle, and from thence cause a most strong
drawing together: for indeed it seems to be ordained for this end, that the
Muscles are imbrewed much more plentifully with the arterous blood, than the
membraneous inwards: to wit, that the Elastick coupling of the spirits, being
consumed, and perpetually falling off, through the very often, and sometimes
continual motion, might be by that means supplied, from the fresh sanguineous
juice: in the mean time, that the spirits themselves, being supplied in a
smaller quantity, through the small nerves, might even like old Soldiers
continue longer in the same station, and follow their manifold coupling or
labor. How else are laboring beasts supplied with a sufficient stock of
spirits, for so much labor, whilst they exercise almost all their muscles, by
a swift course for many hours, yea sometimes a whole day: or who can believe
that a little handful of spirits brought through the small branches of the
wandering and Intercostal pairs of the Nerves to the heart, can be able by their
own strength to effect that its so strong and indiscontinued motion? Indeed it
seems, that of necessity there must come to them from the blood perpetually,
auxilarie aid, and those afterward to be allways exploded. For this reason
certainly, the motive virtue, both of the Heart, and the rest of the Muscles,
becomes more strong and Elastick, above any mechanic Organ: to wit, for as
much, as the animal spirits, acting every where in the musculous stock, get to
themselves an explosive Copula.

If any one shall be displeased at the word Explosion, not yet used in
Philosophy or Medicine, so that this Spasmodick Pathologie, standing on this
basis, may seem only ignoti per ignotius explicatio, an explication of unknown
things by more unknown things; it will be easy to show the effect of this kind
of notion, and very many examples, and instances both concerning natural and
artificial things; from the Analogy of whose motions, in an animated body,
both regularly and irregularly performed, most apt reasons are to be taken. For
besides the mixtures of Nitre with Sulphur, with Tartar, and with Antimony, all
which are fired with a thundering noise; also Aurum fulminans or fulminant Gold,
and a Composition of salt of Tartar, with Nitre and Sulphur, without any actual
fire, being only thoroughly heated, are exploded with a vehement Crash; also to
this may be referred, many Liquors, which being mixed together, or poured upon
some certain bodies, cause or stir up violent motions, and plainly Explosive:
The spirit of Nitre, and the liquor of congeled Antimony, being powered on one
another, or either of them thrown upon the filings of Iron, cause a great
Ebullition, with heat and black smoke. It is commonly known, what heat or
effervescency, and force plainly explosive, arise from fixed Salts melted
together, and from acetous or sharp salt of every kind, mixed with one another:
Nor is the effect of Explosion less seen, when a Liquor imbrued with a volatile
Salt, as the spirit of Hartshorn, or of blood, is put to a saline, either
fixed or acetous Stagma, or sulphurious Nitre, to wit, the particles being
vehemently stricken one against another, leap up with a force, and on every
side are carried forth, a great way; which without doubt, if they were
restrained within the space of any body, as the fibers of a Muscle, they would
suddenly intumifie it, and so would constitute an Instrument of Local motion.
Concerning this thing, we have more fully discoursed already in our Neurologie,
or Tract of the Nerves, and perchance we may yet publish the explication of
this more fully and more accuratly some other time.

In the mean time that this opinion may not be thought altogether new, and that
I have exposed it as a child of my own brain, that had no other Patron, I will
here show you the assertion of the Famous Gassendus, which as it openly favors
this our Hypothesis, and in some sort gave an occasion of it, so perhaps it
will give to it some Authority. Therefore this Rational man, weighing in his
mind, how much that force or strength might be, with which, not only the Arm,
or Thigh, but the whole animal Machine, is moved, governed, lifted up, and
carried up and down: He adds, Who can easily comprehend that small thing,
whatsoever it is, within the body of an Elephant, whether we conceive it to be
a soul, or spirit, or any other beginning of motion, that it should be able to
agitate such a bulk, and to cause it to perform a swift, and regular dance? and
so much the more, for that, when as that small thing within that body, no
longer flourishes, there is need of so much outward strength, to remove it
never so little from its place: but indeed, the same fiery nature of the soul,
serves chiefly to this, which, although it be a very little flame, it is able
to perform within the body, by its own mobility, the same thing in proportion,
that a little flame of Gunpowder does in a Cannon: whilst that it not only
drives forth the Bullet, with so much force, but also drives back the whole
machine, with so great strength. But indeed he says as to the spirits, which
(like explosed Gunpowder) cause the agitation, it is doubtful, whether it be
they, which come from the brain, or those in the little tendons as it were of
kin to them or springing from them, that are thought to do it: But although
either of them concur, yet they seem to be more presently destinated to this
office, which are those of the same kin or offspring in the Tendons. There
needs no more, it is declared, that the motive function depends on the Elastick
Copula, of the animal spirits, and its decision or abating. But from this being
supposed, (which indeed we may suppose with very great probability) it easily
follows, that the Convulsive motions proceed from the like cause: For whosoever
shall consider the sudden puffings up, the violent and strong Contractions, in
the members and affected parts, yea sometimes the most impetuous concussions,
and violent throws of the whole body, can conceive no less, than that very many
heaps of the animal spirits are exploded, or thrust out, even as lightning
breaking forth from a Cloud. Further from hence it may be Argued, by a
reciprocal Argument, that because the Spasmodick motions are explosive, that
therefore the regular are also produced by the explosion of Spirits: But after
what manner, and by what means, and from what causes, the animal spirits being
exploded, or thrust forth; produce Spasmodick affections, shall be our present
business, a little more largely, and plainly to demonstrate, however difficult,
and abstruse the matter seems to be.

We will not here stand to recite many opinions of others, The Conjunct Cause
of Spasms.
concerning the Nature, and causes of a Spasm, or Convulsion; that which was
most common, and long famous among the Ancients, that this distemper was only
produced from repletion or inanition, or from fullness or emptiness, (however,
Not repletion or fullness or inanition or Emptiness,
besides the authority of Hipocrates, for the establishing of this, an example
is brought, of a Skin, or the strings of Lutes, which are wont to be
contracted, being either filled with a moist, or empted by too dry an air)
easily falls of it self; because it seems to suppose (that which is credible to
none by Experience, the fragility of a Nerve) to wit, that the Nerves
themselves, after what manner soever abreviated, and contracted, are able with
a certain force, to draw to them the Muscles. If that it shall be said, that
repletion or inanition, ought to be understood, in respect of the solid parts,
which are wont to be drawn together; it may be observed to the contrary, when
as the Muscels and Nervous stock, are very much watered with a watery humor,
as in an Anasarca, or are plainly destitue of the same, as in the Consumption,
or Mirasmus; yet no Convulsive motions are for that reason excited: among the
moderns, very many have determined, irritation of the Nervous parts, to be the
cause of Convulsion; taking their Conjecture from thence as I suppose, for that
by ocular inspection it appears from the Vellication it self, and by the only
touch of the Nerves, that spasms are induced: And indeed we have clearly
observed, in the dissection of a living whelp, that the knife being put upon
the naked ends of the spinal Nerves, presently both themselves, and the Bodies
of the Muscles, in which they were inserted, were hauled: neither is it
unusual, that spasms are excited almost in every man, by the punctures of the
Nerves and Tendons. I remember by reason of an Ulcer, in the Arms of a certain
man, that the Tendons of the Muscles were laid open, which when touched by the
Surgions Instrument, caused in the Patient a certain rigor, through his whole
body, and forthwith a Concussion arising, made him to quake for a good space.
But in truth, albeit we grant the irritations of the Nervous parts, not seldom
to serve the turn of the evident Cause, and further that sometimes this
solitary Cause, produces more light and transient spasms; nevertheless, that
the more grievious paroxisms of this Disease, and their frequent repetitions by
turns, may be duly unfolded, it behooves us to investigate, or search out other,
and deeper Causes, to wit, the Conjunct and procatartick Cause.

Forasmuch, as spasms never happen but in a living Body, where the Nervous
parts are blown up, and grow turgid with the animal Spirit, we may readily
Conjecture that those animal Spirits themselves, are, as in regular motion, so
also in the Convulsive, the next Instrument of Action: to wit, so long as they
are imbued, with a fit and moderate explosive Copula, and are moved to that
striking forth, only by the Command of the Appetite, or instinct of Nature,
they bring forth motions altogether regular; but if the same Spirits get to
themselves an heterogeneous Copula, and too much Elastick, or if they are
snatched into their Actions, more impetuously and vehemently than they should
be; they even like unbridled Horses, pricked forward with Spurs, leap forth
inordinately or throw off, or explode violently their Copula, although genuine
and natural: and so they carry away the containing parts, as it were a Chariot
tied to them, together with themselves, with a fierce and perverse motion.

There is a double Cause and two kinds of Spasms. Irritation.
When therefore as aforesaid, the Convulsive motions are chiefly stired up for
two Causes, hence, as many Species of them are ordained. For first, it happens
that a Convulsion is induced without a procatartick Cause, or heterogeneous
Copula, first acquired only from a solitary evident Cause: For so a vehement
passion, impressed on the brain, a dissolution of the parts, happening somewhere
in the Nervous stock, a spasmodick passion is suddenly brought upon some, whose
brain and Nerves are of a more weak Constitution: for that the animal spirits
do trouble the containing parts, the improportionate Object flying from them,
and by striking vehemently their Copula, though very agreeing it blows them up,
and so they pull others annexed to them: Spasms being after this manner
excited, because the natural Copula of the spirits in them, is stricken more
vehemently, they are after a manner explosive, which notwithstanding, quickly
leave off, and very often pass away with moving of the viscera, or Members;
only with a trembling, and some horror, into a fainting of the spirits. But
Secondly, Convulsions, whose paroxisms are more grevious and stay longer, or
are oftener repeated, seem altogether to depend on a procatartick Cause, or a
previous disposition, and to arise from some other Conjunct Cause, besides
Irritation. And therefore in this Case we suppose, A preternatural explosive
Copula.
that the heterogeneous, and greatly explosive particles, do increase with the
spirits, acting in this or that region of the Body: then from this wicked
Combination, and restless Collision of this kind of matter, and the Spirits,
frequent and vehement explosions being brought forth, the spasmodick Paroxisms
are induced.

But besides the Elastick Copula, which every where happens to the Spirits,
from the arterous Blood, and from whose orderly explosion, the motive force is
performed, according to the Beck of the Appetite, or instinct of Nature, in all
the Nervous parts; (as we have elsewhere declared) also sometimes other kind
of little bodies, of a fierce nature, or rather like Gunpowder or Nitre, come
to the Spirits, and intimately adhere to them, when frequent and sudden
divorces of this matter, from the Embraces of the Spirits, happen from the
mutual striking together of the particles, the containing Bodies are variously
blown up, and so are thrown into Convulsive motions. In truth, as often as the
Spasmodick Affection becoms habitual, that the Convulsive Paroxisms arise not
rarely on their own accord, and without any evident cause, but still on every
light occasion; the procatartick Cause of such a disease, consists in the evil
disposition, of such a sort of animal Spirits: For neither is the Serous filth,
or other less sharp humors, although deposited in the very ventricles of the
Brain, or about the origin of the nerves, sufficient to stir up such a
sickness: For that I have seen in the heads of dead people, oftentimes the
middle part of the brain, and the very beginings of the Nerves, wholly covered
with a limpid water, who, whilst they were alive, had neither the Epilepsie,
nor Convulsive Motions: But to the producing or these motions, very active
Bodies are required, such as are Saline, and Sulphereous, which being combined
with the Spirits, and then on a sudden breaking from them, they imitate the
combinations, and violent explosions, of particular mineralls. For indeed, if
in regular and ordinary motion (as we have intimated) the Muscles cannot get a
motive force, and elastick strength, unless a certain explosion of the animal
Spirits be supposed, certainly much more lawfully may we assert, that,
epileptick fits, and other admirable Convulsions, which still happen to be
excited, complications of the same Spirits, with other very firce particles,
and vehement elisions, or strikings of these, one against another, are
required. But, as to this kind of Sposmodic Copula, because it differs from the
natural and ordinary, which we have elsewhere shown to be in regular motion,
and to be supplied from the blood; it behooves us to inquire, from whence it
comes, and by what means, and in what places, it is wont to get to the Spirits.

As to the first, it is to be observed, that Spasmodick explosions do every way
happen, not only in the muscles, to which only they are limited, which effect
the regular motion, but also in the membranes, to wit, the ventricle,
mesenterie, and other parts almost without blood: besides, that the explosions
themselves, in the Convulsive Affection, though they are excited contrary to
the will of the Appetite, and the manner of Nature, are far more vehement, and
do longer continue, than in the regular motion: out of which it seems to be
manifest, that the Explosive Spasmodick Copula, does come from some other
place, than the Effectrice of Regular motion: And indeed, it is probable, that,
that flows not, as this, from the arterous blood, running every where among the
musculous fibers, but descends from the Brain, with the Liquore watring the
Nerves, The explosive Spasmodic Copula not immediately from the Blood but from
the Brain.
and so is heaped up, about their beginnings, middle, processes, enfoldings,
and Extremities, as it were the mine of the Convulsive disease. Indeed nothing
appears more evident, than that the Spasmodick Disease, does most often arise,
by reason of the evil first fixed in the Brain, and from thence is
transmitted, into various parts of the Nervous System: for it happens from
hence, that a vehement Passion, as of fear, or Anger, or of Sadness of spirit,
affecting the inhabitants of the Encephalon, the passion called Hysteric, and
Hypochondriac, does so often arise: Further, that in the evil Crises of
Feavours, when the adust recrements of the blood, are transferred into the head,
Convulsions do generally succeed. Moreover, and this is the reason, why the
Vertigo, the inflation of the head, torpor of the mind, and other accidents of
the Supreme Region, are wont to be the proamium, of Spasmes presently
following, in the Inwards, and not seldom, in the whole Body. Wherefore it is
not to be doubted, but that the heterogeneous, and explosive particles, are
instilled from the Blood, together with the nervous juice, into the Brain;
which afterward being thrust forth, into the nervous stock, do there grow to
the Spirits, and with them bring on a Convulsive disposition. In truth, the
Spasmodick distempers, which are either universal, or at least occupy many
parts of the body at once, arise for the most part, by this only means. But in
the mean time, we will not deny, but that particular Spasms, which contain
themselves within Certain places, the Head being no ways affected, are induced
sometimes by other means. For if the nerves imbibe their humor from either
end, to wit, the root, and the extreme fragments, (which both the learned
Glisson maintains to be most likely, and by us is showed in our Neurologie, not
without great probabillity) it may be from hence inferred, that the Spasmodick
particles are brought inwardly, not only from the beginning of the Nerves, but
somewhat also by their extremities: Therefore that perhaps appears clear and
plain enough, Sometimes received from the ends of the Nerves.
that from the spleen being evilly affected, Spasms arising about its region,
do not seldom affect the Hypochondria and Praecordia. I have known some, from a
tumor or ulcer existing in the Mesenterie, womb, and other inwards, were wont
to have Convulsions, both in the grieved part, and also all about it; the
reason of which seems to be no other, than that the heterogeneous particles
being more plentifully heaped up, in the affected place, Creeping also into the
nervous fibers, planted nigh thereunto, supply them with matter for Convulsive
motions like to fired gunpowder: But indeed, Spasms arising from such a cause,
are not wont to diffuse themselves far about, nor always to ascend to the Head.

These things being thus premised, concerning the inward and next Cause of the
Spasmodic Distemper, which we affirm to arise chiefly, and most often, from the
head it self, and in some respect also from the extremities of the Nerves, it
now remains, that we more particularly declare, the Various remoter Causes in
either Kind, The more remote Causes of Spasms.
and the manifold provision of this disease. The Convulsive Disease therefore,
for the most part, takes its original from the head: to wit; as often as the
heterogeneous and explosive particles, being diffused from the blood into the
Brain, or its medullarie Appendix, are afterward derived to the nervous stock,
and there grow together with the Spirits: But this happens to come to pass from
various causes: for there are very many ways and means, whereby the morbifick
matter is admitted into the head, and very many also, whereby it is deduced
into this, or that region of the nervous System; and according to the various
translations of this kind of morbifick matter, the diverse kinds of Convulsive
motions are constituted.

1 The mortifick matter is heaped up within the Head, by the default both of
the blood send-it*
Therefore, that the Heterogeneous and Spasmodick particles are admitted into
the Encephalon, it is to be imputed to the fault, both of the blood sending,
and of the Brain receiving it.

1. When the Blood powrs upon the Head the morbifick matter, either all its
whole mass is depraved, as it frequently happens in malignant feavours, also in
the Scorbutic, cacochymick, and chiefly in an originally corrupt Distemper; or
the Blood of it self innocent and incorrupt, receives elsewhere malignant
little bodies, and afterward fixes them on the brain, so in great impurities of
the Inwards, and chiefly when any parts are affected with an Inflammation, or
virulent ulcer, or hurtful ferment, for from such mines the taint of the
disease, the noxious particles bubble up into the blood, and afterward, in its
passage, are laid up in the Brain: So, by reason that the spleen, womb, and
other inwards, being evilly affected, Convulsive Diseases are excited, which
notwithstanding, depend more immediately upon the Brain receiving the corruption
of those parts, through the commerce of the Blood.

And also of the brain receiving it.
2. But in the second place, the Blood however vicious it should be, and
impregnated with the morbid seed, it could not easily leave its Infection on
the head, unless there were some fault in the Constitution of the brain, and
its Appendix; as long as these parts are well made, and are full of vigor,
they defend themselves, and what belongs to them, and the doors being shut,
they admit nothing but an unmixt spirituous Liquour, destinated for their use:
but if either the passages, and pores of the Brain are too lax, or the
door-keeping Spirits leave or are called off from their watches, an
heterogeneous and morsific matter, creeps in together with the nervous juice,
and unfolds its malignity, in the animal government. As to the evil disposition
of the Brain it self, The evil disposition of the brain is either hereditary
it is sometimes hereditary: So those sprung from parents obnoxious to the
Epilepsie, or Convulsions, are themselves for the most part prone to the same
Distempers: and indeed, the Constitution of the brain, may several ways become
vicious from the birth: for either its temperature is more moist, or more dry
than it should be, or it may be faulty by the excess, or defect of either
Quallity. Sometimes the pores are more lax, or its consistency is too soft, or
too hard: and also the Conformation of the parts of the Brain, Or acquired.
and its Appendix, may be after an undue manner; But sometimes, the disposition
of the Brain and Nerves, originally whole, and firm, is vitiated by accident,
and acquires a morbid inclination: long Intemperance may enervate these parts:
as also malignant feavours, and chronical Diseases, very much debillitate them:
besides outward accidents, as the excess of heat or cold, an ulcer or a blow
oftentimes perverts their Crases, and renders them more incident to the
impressions of Diseases. But as to the Constitution or irregularities of the
animal Spirits, by reason of which, the heterogeneous and Spasmodick particles,
enter the brain without any repulse, and more easily cleave to it; it is to be
observed, that the animal Spirits are in some more tender, and easily
dissipable, from their very birth; so that indeed, they are not able to suffer
any thing very strong or vehement, to be brought to the sense or Imagination,
but strait they fly into confusions: For this Reason, women more than men, and
some of them more then others, are obnoxious to the passions called Histerick.
Further, sometimes a violent Passion, impresses on the spirits, though
moderatly firm, this kind of dissipation and inordination, so that afterward
they are able to suffer nothing strongly, or to resist any injury: So it often
happens, that morbid impressions are affixed on the animal regimen, by sudden
fear, or great sadness, which can hardly ever after be blotted out: for from
hence women often contract first the Diseases named the Mother, or from the
Womb, and men the hypochondriack, and are for the most part still subject to
them.

From these things it appears, after what manner, and for what Causes, 2. How
the morbific matter being admitted within the head is disposed.
the Spasmodick Matter is wont to be admitted into the Head: now let us see
next, what is done with it afterward; if that this matter brought to the
Brain, induces the Convulsive distempers, either not always, or not altogether,
after the same manner.

1. It sometimes happens, that the heterogeneons and explosive Particles,
Sometimes it is carried back again from the brain.
are admitted into the Brain, which notwithstanding are again exterminated,
without any great hurt, and before they enter into the nervous stock: for that
the veins and Lympheducts, or water-carrying Vessels, often sup up what is
superfluous, and an enemy to the animal dominion, and convey it forth of
doors, or dispose of it into Emunctuaries, or Sinks. Whilst such a matter is
for a little while agitated in the brain, its particles being affixed to some
of its Spirits, and at length striking against them, cause the Virtego, and the
swimming in the head; but because they enter not into the passages of the
nerves, Spasmodick Distempers do not follow.

2. When the morbifick matter is admitted within the Head, and not presently
from thence sent back, oftentimes it produces not its evil, Sometimes it is
thrust out into the nervous stock.
till it is inserted into the stock of the Nerves; for the animal Spirits
within the Brain, being as yet strong, and having got a more free space, they
evade the embraces of every heterogeneous Copula; which indeed they are not
able to do, within the strait channells of the nerves: Besides, the morbifick
matter it self, if it cannot be sent away out of the Brain by the excretory
vessels, it is by and by sent forth to the System of the nerves as the more
ignoble part: Remaining in the brain causes the falling sickness.
but if in spite of the force of the superior faculties, such a matter stays
long within the brain, it much infects the Spirits that inhabit it, and induces
the Epilepsie, as shall be more particularly showed hereafter: but more often,
the hurtful matter is thrown on the nervous stock, from the brain, without
much harm to it, but this happens to come to pass, not always after the same
way.

For truly, the heterogeneous Particles, being mixed with the nervous Liquor,
The spasmodic matter being fallen on the nervous stock.
and fallen toward the beginings of the Nerves, do not indifferently enter all
of them together, or these, or those, as chance shall guide them, but they are
directed to the passages of some before others, and that not without some
Reason. For we observe, that the Convulsive Symptoms, do choose for the most
part one place in children, another in riper years, and a different one in more
tender, than in the more rebust.

In children, who are not yet accustomed to the Affections of the Heart,
Afflict the foreparts of the Nerves in Children.
and exercise of the outward members (whereby the morbifick cause may be
further carried from the brain) the Spasmodick matter runs more often into
those nearest Nerves, viz. the third, fifth, and sixth pares; wherefore, their
faces and mouths, and those parts, are chiefly handled: and it is rare and
unusual for them, to have their viscera, and praecordia, lifted up, or
affected, with an inordinate motion, as in those of riper years: on the
contrary, in men of more advanced years, Otherwise in those of riper years.
by its approach to the intercostals, and the Nerves of the wandering pare, it
being more open to those of the spinal marrow, which those nerves respect are
wont to be more frequently pulled: but yet with this difference, that in the
more tender, and those who are very delicate, and subject to passions, and who
by reason of the passions of the mind, have very often their praecordia and
viscera disturbed, the Spasmodick matter, more readily enters the more open
passages of the interior Nerves, and therefore, they are rendered more
obnoxious to Spasmes, stirred up in the Abdomen and the Thorax: for hence it is
that women are molested with the passions called Hysterical, and some men with
the hypocondriack; as shall be more largely declared hereafter, when we come to
treat particularly of these Distempers.

After what manner it disturbs the spirits, whilst it stays near the beginnings
of the Nerves, or being fallen more deeply into their passages.
When the Spasmodic matter falls upon the heads of some nerves, or remaining
there, it creates only a giddiness, and lighter Spasmes, and leapings of those
parts, to which these Nerves belong, or being slidden more deeply into the
pipes of the Nerves it brings forth more cruel Convulsive Paroxisms: but the
same being dilated, into the nervous processes is disposed through one or more
of the branches of the stock, or Trunk, sometimes all, and sometimes only those
more open than the rest, and by degrees cleave to the Spirits, both within
those Nerves, as also to those planted within the hanging Fibers: so that it is
after the same manner, and there is the like preparation in the disposition to
Convulsive Paroxisms, as if grains of Gunpowder were laid in a long train to be
fired successively: The Spirits after this manner imbred with an heterogeneous
Copula, are lodged within the Fibers, interwoven with the membranes, and
Muscles, but chiefly within the nervous foldings; and when they grieved with
too great plentitude, or troubled on any other occasion, are compelled to shake
off their Copula, the particles striking and leaping one against another,
hugely blow up the containing parts; and so excite a motive force, contrary to
the commands and Laws of the Appetite, and Nature: The spirits enter into
explosions, by reason of plenitude or irritation.
Besides, the Spirits once stirred up, to the performing Convulsive motions,
begin their explosions, from the one or the other extremity, of the nervous
System, but for the most part at the end. But they who are first explosed,
snatch or take with them their neighbors, also praedisposed, like a fiery
train; and so they propagate the begun affection, with a long, continued series
of Spasms, from one end to the other: For a convulsion begun in the bottom of
the belly, or at the foot, or hand, creeps by degrees to the upper parts, and
for the most part to the head it self: and the same Distemper, when it begins
in the brain, (as in the Epilepsie) is derived in like manner thence downwards,
to the remote Viscera, and also to the exterior members and Limbs.

The spasmodic matter causes Convulsions either continued or periodical or by
fits.
The morbifick matter, flowing in the heads of the nerves, produces diverse kinds
of convulsions, according to their various plenty and dispensation; for first
of all, it is to be observed, that the whole passages of the nervous System, or
of some of its parts, through the abundant, and exuberant matter, are sometimes
possessed, so that the animal Spirits, both flowing in, and there implanted,
being full of an heterogeneous Copula, and a perpetual supplement of it, are
urged into continual Spasms. I have known some, who have had all the muscles
and tendons through their whole body, afflicted with Contractions and leapings
without intermission: I have known others whose thighs, arms, and other
members, were perpetually forced into various bendings, and distortions: and
also others I have seen, who of necessity were compelled to leap and run up and
down, and to beat the ground with their feet, and hands; and if they did it
not, they fell into cruel Convulsions of the Viscera and Praecordia: 2. If the
explosive and heterogeneous Particles, be combined with the Spirits in a lesser
plenty, they stick to them without tumult or perturbation, until after some
time, both Particles leaping again one from another, and from their striking
one another, raise up Convulsive paroxysms; which sort of Paroxysms are
periodical, and are repeated exactly at certain hours; which happens by reason
of the morbifick matters, being daily poured upon the nervous stock, with an
equal dimension, and therefore about the same space of time, it is also daily
heaped up to an explosive plenitude; or they are wandering, and uncertain, in
others, for that the heterogeneous particles, are poured in with a lesser
company, and so arise not to an explosive fullness, under a long time; when in
the mean time, the more full heaping of them together, and their explosion, are
wont to happen sometimes more often, and sometimes more seldom, by reason of
several occasions, or evident causes: hence it comes to pass, that the
Spasmodic Distemper is sometimes altogether attributed to the evident cause,
when indeed, if a more remote convulsive cause had not gone before, such a
cause had stirred up none.

Therefore, that we may say something of the evident causes of Convusions, The
Evident causes of Spasms.
we have already observed, if they be more vehement, and happen to a weak and
tender constitution of Brain, and nervous stock, they are sometimes solitary,
or of themselves cause convulsive passions: but as often as the Spasmodick
Distemper is heavier, and being made habitual is wont to return oftener, though
the evident Cause be manifest, and bears the blame of the effect, nevertheless
it is to be suspected, that a procatartick, or more remote cause exists, and is
the more strong efficient, though it lies hid within: for unless the Spirits
are imbued with an heterogeneous Copula, they would not be so easily, nor so
often, driven into involuntary, and praeternatural Explosions.

We meet with a double order or Glasses of Evident causes; The Evident. Cause
twofold viz. Filling and Irritateing.
for either they are of that sort which increases the procatarick or more
remote, and brings it sooner to an explosive fullness, as are an ill manner of
living, and errors in the six non-naturals, which by infecting the blood, and
nervous juice, heap up to a Saturity, in greater plenty, on the Spirits
heterogeneous particles, and by that means do the sooner procure Spasmodick
accessions. Or 2dly, the evident cause is said to be, whatever stirs and
irritates suddenly the spirits, that they presently fall into explosions, and
whatever it be, that causes them to strike off their Copula, and of this sort
there are very many accidents, that provoke the spirits, The irritateing Cause,
stirs up Spasms, direct, or reflected.
planted now within the Head, and now within the nervous System, to convulsive
motions by a diverse instinct (as is wont in the regular motions) which motions
are either direct, or reflected.

1. Of the former kind chiefly are violent perturbations of the mind,
wherewith the spirits of the brain being agitated and confused, they excite
others lying within the nervous stock, and often praedisposed, to irregular
explosions, so a vehement fear, anger, or sadness, do not only introduce
epileptical and hysterical fits, to those that are disturbed in their health,
but sometimes cause to diverse others, palpitation, and trembling of the heart,
and also horrid convulsions of the members and Limbs. 2. As to the other kind
of evident cause, to wit, whereby Spasms are excited by a reflected Act, this
indeed comes to pass not unfrequently, as often as any heavy trouble, with an
irritation of the fibers and spirits, happens any where to the nervous stock:
for that this trouble being by and by communicated, to the chief fountains of
the Spirits, to wit, the brain or Cerebell, from thence inordinate and violent
motions, against the will of the mind, that is convulsive, being begun, they
are returned back, for so either worms, physic, or sharp humors, cruelly
hauling the coats of the Intestines, cause spasms in those parts, and not
seldom in the outward members.

So much for the several kinds of causes, the conjunct, procatartick, and
evident, whereby convulsive Diseases, becoming habitual, and are wont to be
repeated with more grievous Paroxisms, do arise: But as we have assigned
another species of this Disease, where the Paroxysms depend on an evident
solitary cause, or at most only from irritation, the Spirits being not yet
praeoccupied with an explosive Copula: it is now next to be inquired into, by
what, and how many ways, this may come to pass. Concerning this in general, it
is affirmed, that the Spasmodic fits produced by mere irritation are either
lighter and quickly passing away, or more grievious and not seldom deadly, as
when poison is taken, or when they come upon an overpurging medicine. Moreover
it is noted, when the morbifick, or irritative matter falls upon the tales
themselves, or the foldings of the nerves, that it also not rarely becomes
explosive, The irritateing Cause distinguished, as to the places affected, as
to the subjects.
and so Spasms produced also from mere irritation (as we have already noted)
are certain explosions; these being thus premised, we will dispatch the
business in hand.

The irritation of the Nervous parts, which is wont to cause convulsive
motions, happens in various places, and from various matters, which are
incongruous and inimical to the spirits, and fibers. As to the things, enemies
to the Nature of the spirits, you may observe, besides poisons, The places
affected, are the beginnings the extremities, and the middle processes, and
foldings, of the Nerves.
and the excess of cangible quallities, which are inflicted from without; many
things which are begot within us, viz. the various recrements of the blood, and
nervous juice, feverish taints, praeternatural salt, or sulphurous humors,
yea worms, the stone, with many other things, to be infestous to the nervous
stock, and ordinarily to stir up Spasmodick irritations. As to the places
affected, or the seat of the irritative matter, although this brings hurt in
any part of the nervous System, yet for the most part, it is wont to become
most infestous, when it is fixed near the beginnings, or the ends of the
nervous System, or about the middle processes of the Nerves, and especially in
their foldings: Besides, such a matter, which irritating the Spirits, is wont
to have the place of an Evident Cause, does not seldom become, as we hinted
but now, the means of a more remote cause, forasmuch as the heterogeneous
particles, being sent from it, enter into the nervous fibers, and being
combined with the Spirits, renders them more apt and ready to be exploded.

How the irritating Cause affects the origin of the Nerves
1. Therefore, it sometimes happens, that malignant humors, and infestous to
the nervous stock, being poured out from the blood, on the region of the brain,
and from thence dilated to the hinder region of the Head, do fall upon the
origin of the nerves; where, if the little skin, which clothes the oblong
pith, be broken, they fall into the naked trunks of the nerves, and enter
deeply into their fibers; wherefore indeed, Convulsive motions arise, not only
in the neighboring parts of the head, but sometimes in very remote, and not
rarely in the whole nervous System: This is generally observed, in evil Crises
of feavours, the morbifick matter being translated to the head; also in
cephallic Distempers, being brought to the worst and deadly state. Truly, when
I have opened the heads of those, who have dyed by this means, I found in all
of them, the hinder Region of the oblong pith, immersed with a sharp, and salt
Serum.

How the extremities of the Nerves.
2. As the interior extremity, or original of the System, so not rarely the
exterior, or the end, from a vellication or hawling there made, begets Spasms,
or Convulsive motions, and transfers them on every side: that this is done
ordinarily in the outward members, the prickings of the tendons, and Nerves, do
testify. No less are Spasms wont to be excited every way about, from a
vellication or pulling, made in the Viscera, when at any time Medicines, or
sharp humors, also worms lying in the Ventricle or Intestines, pull the
membraneous part, and so impress a troublesome sense on the chief sensories;
presently from thence, by reason of the firing of the spirits, Convulsive
motions torment now the affected parts, and now indifferently any other parts:
for oftentimes Spasms, from the more grievous hurt of some Inwards, do not only
employ the affected parts, and their neighbors, but also the Muscles of the
face and mouth, and are likewise transferred to the exterior members. The stone
impacted in the Uriters, causes not only cruel Contractions in that passage,
but in all its neighborhood. Moreover, some hysteric and other hypochondriac
Symtoms, are sometimes induced by this means, forasmuch, as by a vellication
made in the membranes of some Viscera, thence the Spasm is returned back.

How the middle proecsses and foldings.
3. The irritative matter, which is wont to be the Evident Cause of Spasms,
sometimes occupies the middle processes of the nerves; and therefore the parts,
sometimes above, sometimes beneath its seat, are incited to convulsive motions:
This appears plain enough in the foldings of the Nerves; for when the sharp
recrements of the nervous juice, are laid up in them, they do not rarely create
Spasms, through the whole neighborhood: by this means, the Colic or
Histerick Distemper, is often seen to be begot or excited, there being no fault
in those Inwards, only from the humors, deposited in the foldings of the
mesenterie, as we will show hereafter, when we come to treat of those
particular Distempers. In like manner, by reason that the ganglioform foldings,
being stopped up with a sharp and irritative humor, perfocation or choking in
the Throat, and various Contractions of the Praecordia are caused. Besides,
Spasmodick Distempers do not seldom depend, upon a sharp humor within the
whole trunks of the nerves, and filling the passages of the nervous Bodies. We
have seen some troubled with admirable, and perpetual Convulsions, so that they
have been forced (as we have already mentioned) to run about, to leap, to fling
about, and distort their members, to strike the ground with their feet and
hands, and to exercise other strange gestures, even as if they had been
bewitched; the genuine Cause of which kind of passion, seems to consist in
this, that the Juice watering the nervous stock, being most sharp like stygian
water, and being become degenerate from its due Crasis, does irritate
continually, and as it were possess with a certain madness, the Spirits therein
flowing, and implanted.

The difference of Spasms in respect of their origin.
From these things, which we have discoursed, about the various causes of
Convulsions, their manyfold Species and differences are made manifest: For
first, we have made known, that Spasmodick Passions are most often derived, in
respect of their origin, for the head, being affected; or the morbific matter,
flowing into the beginnings of the Nerves: yet sometimes, though more rarely,
they depend upon such a matter, Creeping into the extremities of the nerves.

2. As to the production of the Disease and symptoms, Of their Causes
we observe the same sometimes to be produced, from a solitary evident Cause,
as a sudden and vehement Passion: but indeed more often, to require a more
remote, or procatartic cause, or praevious disposition: moreover, the causes
sometimes so to interfeer, that the procatartick, also may supply the place of
the evident cause; and also, on the contrary, that this may serve in the place
of the other.

3. As to the extention of the Disease, the Convulsive Distemper may be
distinguished into Universal, because the Spirits actuating the whole nervous
System almost, and the Encephalon it self, are successively exploded; and
Particular, in which the Spirits, within some private Region of the Animal
Kingome, are disturbed.

1. The former is meant, when the animal Spirits are irritated, Of the extent
of the disease.
within their first fountains, to wit, the pith of the brain, and cerebell,
from whence their violent explosions happen; wherefore every internal function
of the soul, to wit, the sense and Imagination is obscured, and its exterior
locomotive faculty perverted: This kind of universal Spasmodick Distemper, in
which, besides the spasms of the Limbs and Viscera, the interior powers of the
Soul suffer an Eclipse, is again twofold: to wit, either primarie, which
begins at the Head, and arises, forasmuch as the Spirits inhabiting that place,
being imbued with nitro-sulphureous particles, are first exploded, and their
inkindling snatches or takes hold of the rest, flowing in both the medulary and
nervous Appendix, and there stirs up Convulsive explosions, as may be discerned
in the Epilepsie.

2. Or this universal passion, causing Insensibility is Secondary, to wit,
which being begun somewhere in the nervous stock, from thence, plenty of
spirits being successively affected, becoming like the undulation or moving of
waters, is at length carried to the head it self: this often happens in
paroxisms called hysterical, in which, by reason of the Spasm begun at first in
the bottom of the belly, or some intumescency or rising up in the Abdomen,
then, the same spreading higher, with the same effect, through the pipes of the
Nerves, the Ventricle, and by and by the Praecordia are drawn together, and at
length, the Spasm forceably rushing to the Head, the patients fall down, and
all Knowledge is taken from them, and lastly, the Disease being reflected into
other nerves, Convulsive motions of the exterior members succeed.

2. But as to the particular Spasm, in whose fit the sick continue well in
mind, this Indeed is distinguished into various differences. As to the seat of
the matter, which happens about the beginnings, extremities, or middle
processes of the Nerves (as we have shswn) there arises a difference: For even
as this morbifick matter, beseiging the beginnings of the nerves, is fixed
about the head, middle, or end of the oblong pith, it therefore happens, that
sometimes only the parts of the face or mouth, sometimes the Viscera of the
lower, or middle Belly, and again sometimes chiefly the outward limbs, are
hauled together.

Further, a Convulsion, as to the duration of the fit, and its magnitude, Of
the duration of the Fit.
uses to be distinguished, into a continual, and Intermitting: The former, as
we have already hinted, is called Tenasmus, or a permanent Contraction, as when
one part, or more, being Contracted or distorted with a constant stretching,
are detained for some time in the same praeternatural posture; so, when the
muscles, or a member, suppose the eye, Lips, Cheeks, are distorted from their
right position, nor cannot easily be presently reduced: the cause of which is
sometimes a resolution, or Palsy, in some other muscles, which when they are
loosened, the opposite do too strongly Act, and draw forceably the whole part,
toward themselves, which ought to stand, as it were betwixt them, in an equal
balance: but sometimes, such a permanent contraction, is excited, by reason of
the tendons heing stopped with an impacted serous humor, which become for that
cause stiff: This Kind of Distemper becoms very familiar in the Scurvy, that
the sick sometimes are not able to extend any member or Joint, but they are
contracted round like a globe. Sometimes the Tendons in the back by reason of
such a course of humor, draw the bones out of their due situation, and cause
a gibbousness, or bending out of the Body. The Tenasme is wont to be
distinguished into universal, of which there are three Kinds, to wit, Tension
forward, Tension backwards, and Tenasmus properly so called; and Peculiar or
particular, which chiefly respects some certain member or joint: we will speak
of these distinctly hereafter.

2. The intermitting Convulsion, is either short and momentary, which is acted
by frequent turns, and as it were by little leaps, as is to be observed in the
quaking and shakings of the Tendons in horror, which are to be distinguished
between, with a frequent alternation of motion and rest: or the leapings of the
Spasms, and their intervals, are drawn out longer: So it is usual, for
Convulsive paroxysms, when they are repeated, to endure for some time, and to
leave off again; but such periods are now certain, or come to certain set
hours, now rare, and uncertain, and happen after a diverse manner, and as
various occasions are given. There are other differences of this distemper,
which will be better illustrated hereafter, when we shall speak particularly of
each kind of Convulsions.

CHAPTER II. Of the Epilepsie.
THus far we have treated, of the Nature, Causes, and differences of Spasms, or
Convulsions in general according to a clean, new, and unusual Hypothesis, but
(as I think) agreeable enough with Reason: our next business is, to explain
particularly the chief kinds of that Distemper; amongst which the Epilepsie
easily deserves the pre-eminence, and the Consideration of it ought to proceed,
by a certain right of method and order; for that this Disease, having as it
were got a large Empire, in the humane body, exercises its Tyrranie, not only
in the whole Encephalon, but for the most part, in all the parts of the nervous
Sistem at once: wherefore by the Ancients, it was called Morbus Herculeus, or
the Herculean Disease, from the Cruelty of the distemper, and from the manner
of the violent fits, as if sent, as it were by some Divinity, being so amazing,
morbus Sacer, or, the holy Disease, to which may be added, the Conjecture of a
certain Divine of our own Country, of no small note, to wit, that many, who
were taken to be Daemonaicks, or possessed with the devil in the New
Testament, were only Epilepticks, and that they called the cure of this Disease
by our Savior Jesus Christ, an ejection or exorcism of the evil Spirit: In
truth, in this Distemper, no marks at all, of the morbifick matter appears, or
are so very obscure, that we may have deservedly suspected it, to be an
inspiration of an evil Spirit, at least it is probably, that as often as the
Devil is permitted to afflict miserable Mortals, with his delusions, he is not
able to draw more Cruel Arrows, from any other quiver, or to show miracles by
any better witch, than by the assaulrs of this monstrous Disease.

As the Symptoms of the Epilepsie are very Stupendous, so their Causes, and
the formal Reason of the Disease it self, are most difficult to be unfolded.
For indeed, the business is variously controverted among authors, both
concerning the part Affected, and also the manner of its being affected: many
place its seat in the Brain, or its Ventricles, others in the meninges, or thin
skins enwrapping the Brain, and some again in the middle, or lowest belly, but
by what right shall be inquired into anon: In the mean time, laying aside the
opinions of others, that the true speculation of this Disease may be found out,
by the clew af right reasoning, we will first of all endeavor to give you its
description, together with the whole sense of its Phaenomenas. Secondly, these
things being rightly weighed, to find out the subject of the diiease, and its
chiefly affected parts. Thirdly and lastly, to add the means and manner.
whereby this disease is begotten, with the true Causes of its Symtoms.

The description of the Epilepsie, or the history of the Disease.
In the first place, As to the Idea of the Disease, the Epileptick Fit or
assault, seems to be only an universal, and more cruel Convulsion, to wit, in
which the Spirits inhabiting the Brain, being first irregularly moved, and as
it were confused, all the rest, dwelling in both the medulary, and nervous
appendix of the Encephalon, begin at once Convulsive motions, or inordinate
contractions, and continue them for some space, with frequent leapings or
palpitations: The accession of the disease come upon them at unawares, and
oppresses the sick, not the least thinking of it, and in the twink of an Eye,
casts them on the ground, deprived of sense and understanding; for that they do
not only fall* but are flung down with a certain force, so that often times the
part first stricken against the Earth, or other adjacent Bodies, is hurt with a
bruise or wound; being last done, there comes upon them a gnashing of Teeth,
with a foam at the mouth also, oftentimes the shaking of the head, and a
frequent knocking it against the ground, the arms and thighs, yea, the hinder
part of the neck, and back, either become presently slit, or else they are
distorted hither and thither, with various bendings; some Cruelly beat their
breasts, others strongly thrust out their arms and thighs, and fling them, and
sometimes the whole Body, impetuously here and there; many have their
praecordia, and hypochondria, and also all their lower belly swelled, and blown
up very much: after some time, sometimes shorter, sometimes longer, these
Symptoms, the Tragedy being as it were acted, cease, on a sudden, and then the
sick come to themselves, and recover their senses: but after the fit there
remains an akeing in the head, with a dullness, and hebitude of the senses, and
not seldom a turning, or giddiness.

The Epileptick Paroxysms are wont to return sometimes at set times of the day,
month, or year; and most Commonly at the greater returns of the year or
Tropicks, or at the opposite aspects, or conjunctions of the Sun, or moon, they
are wont more certainly to return, and to afflict more grievously: sometimes
their comings or accessions, are uncertain, and wandering according to the
occasion, and variety of Evident Causes: there are also Fits or Poroxysms, now
more light, which quickly pass away, so that the sick are scarce thrown to the
ground, nor are carried into disorder or insensibility; now more grievous,
whereby they when taken, lie senseless the space of an hour or more, and are
tormented with horrid Symptoms, as if possessed with the Devil: Sometimes tho
more rarely, some foregoing signs of the fit, warn them of their falling into
it; as an heaviness of the head, a brightness of the eyes, a tingling of the
ears: sometimes a spasm or cramp proceeds, in some exterior part, as in the
arm, or thigh, or else in the back, or Hypochondria, which ascending from
thence, like a Cold air, and creeping toward the head, seems to bring on their
falling down. Boys, and young Men are found to be more obnoxious to this
disease, than old men, or men of mature age: who ever are once struct down by
its fit, unless they be cured by the help of Medicines, they will hardly be
altogether free, from the infection of it, all their Life after; the more often
the Fits are, the more grievous they become, which as they frequently return
become more cruel, and enervate the use of the memory, Imagination, and Reason,
and then the strength, and force of the whole animal function, until its
Occonomy being greatly perverted, the vital function at length decays, and by
degrees is abolished. The weapons, and wicked preparation of this Disease,
being after this manner laid open, we will next make an inquiry, in what part
it fixes its seat; or what is its next subject.

The accession of the Epilepsie, and the manner of invasion, The subject of the
seat of the Disease is inquired into.
seem plainly to declare, that its primary seat, or part chiefly affected, is
contained somewhere within the Head; but that a Paroxysm sometimes begins in
the remote parts, and from thence ascends toward the head, which indeed seems
only to be so, and happens by accident, when in the mean time, the morficick
Cause subsists about the Encephalon it self, (as shall be anon declared): but
that from the first assault of the Disease, presently a strange Insensibility,
and disorder, with contractions almost of all the Members and Viscera succeeds,
it is a manifest sign, that the whole joynting of the Encephalon, and the
original of all the nerves, are possessed with the morbifick Cause: But truly,
although it seem most difficult, to unfold where this cause, or morbifiek
matter subsists chiefly; for, neither is it probable, that the same is diffused
through all the parts of the Brain; Some affirm it the Meninges or thin skins of
the Brain, other the pith or middle part of the Brain.
yet it neither appears in what singular place this being fixed should draw all
the other parts so suddenly into a Consent of its evil.

Among the various opinions of Authors, about this matter, there are two that
seem more probable than the rest, and challenge an assent with an equal
likelinesse to Truth. One of which asserts the very middle of the brain, and
the other the meninges, or the thin skins encompassing or clothing it, to be
the primary seat of the Epilepsie: The Reason of the former is founded in this,
that where the fountain of the animal Spirits, and the original of the
sensitive soul it self consists, there ought to be placed the cause of this
Disease, certainly when the chief faculties are first hurt, all the rest easily
participate of the same evil: But in truth, though I may grant in the Apoplexy,
and the deliquium or fainting of the spirits, that it is so, yet it follows not
in a Convulsion (of which kind of distemper the Epilepsie is) that all the
fibers and nerves should be pulled together, because the middle part of the
brain is first pulled: for that this, as it is a moist and fluid substance, and
wanting of sense and motion, seems not capable of contraction, or the
Spasmodick Distemper: wherefore others thinking the brain, and every part of
it, free from the blame of this Disease, cast it altogether on the meninges:
affirming, that the membranes, clothing the brain, and chiefly their
processes, spread upon the clefts of the brain, and Ceribel, as they are hauled
by the morbifick matter, do conceive or beget Spasms, or horrid Convulsions,
and then that from the Meninges themselves, so Contracted and brought together,
the included Brain is greatly compressed, and bound together, so that its pores
and passages being bound up, the great amazing disorder and insensibility is
induced, and also the trunks of the nerves, to which either meninge or skin is
fastened, being brought into a consent with them, enter also into Convulsive
motions: And indeed after this manner, the formal Reason of the Epilepsie, may
perhaps seem to be unfolded; but truly when I consider further of the matter, I
think we may differ from this opinion, because it does not appear by what
Course, or for what cause, the falling down being at hand, these meninges
should beget such horrid Spasms. Nay, it neither appears, how from them,
however Convulsive they be, the Epileptick Paroxism should be induced.

It is affirmed, that the meninges are not first of all affected.
As to the former, it seems an impossible thing, for the meninges to be so
contracted, as to their whole Concavities, that being bound more strictly
together, like a purse, they should on every side pull together their contents,
and draw them into a narrower space: for that the Dura Matter sticks most firmly
to very many places of the skull, yea, and the Pia matter is tied to it, near
the processes of the hollow turnings, by a mutual knitting of the membranes,
and every where besides with a Continuity of Vessels: Hence it easily appears,
either that membrane, as to the greatest part of it, is immovable, so that they
cannot fall into so universal Spasms: but in respect of lesser Spasms, as when
a certain portion of this or that meninge, or both together, is pulled, indeed
we grant such may happen: for I have often heard those troubled with great
headache, to complain extremely of a great constriction of the parts, lying
under the side of the skull, sometimes on the right, sometimes on the left, and
yet from thence no assault of falling down, has followed: Further as those
membranes being notably hurt, do cause great vellications or haulings, yet upon
it there is not wont to be an Epileptick sit to follow: for I have known, from
an Imposthume in the Dura matter, when being broken, and that the stinking
matter had knawn the more tender meninges, and shell of the Brain, that the
sick have fallen first into an amazedness, and at length into a deadly
Apoplexy, who notwithstanding, in the whole course of the Disease, was free
from any Epileptical Symtom. Also I remember, I have seen one, who had the Dura
matter very much torn, by the instrument of an unskilful Surgion, and another,
that by a wound, had that with part of his skull taken away, so that a portion
of the Brain swelled forth, and yet to neither of them any Epilectical passion
happened: wherefore neither is it likely, that the blood, or humors, or (if any
shall so argue) the vapors, compacted within those meninges, can bring in any
greater evil, than either a stroke, or wound, inflicted on them, or filthy
matter there poured out: Besides, those who are more lightly troubled with the
Epilepsie, so that they scarce fall down, and have their minds free through the
whole assault of the disease, would perceive the membrans to be so contracted,
and the globe of the brain to be more straightly thrust together, if there had
bin any such kind of affection; The spirits inhabiting the middle of the brain
are the primary Subject of the disease.
but they on the contrary, seem to have the Brain as it were inflamed, and to
be sensible, that the spirits leap forth, and are as it were explosed, with a
certain fierceness.

And indeed, I think it is very likely so, that the Epileptick Paroxism is
stired up, from a certain sudden rarefication, and explosion of the animal
spirits, inhabiting the Brain, which are in truth the first, and immediate
subject of this Disease; to wit, whereby the Brain it self is inflated, and
rendered so insensible, and the Nerves hanging thereto, also put into
convulsions: For hence it comes to pass, that the accession of this Disease
begins so on a sudden, and determines perfectly without any great provision or
remains, of the morbifick matter; because the Infection is not brought so much
to the solid parts, as to the Spirits themselves.

We have already shown by what means, the heterogeneous and explosive Copula,
consisting as it seems of nitro-Sulphurous particles, cleaving to the
spirituous particles of the animal Spirits, and lastly, being smitten and
explosed by them, by reason of plenitude or irritation, produces Convulsive
Symptoms: But although this kind of Spasmodick Copula, is first distilled from
the blood into the brain, yet, for the most part, it does not take hold of the
spirits there, or at least, it stays not long with them, in that place: but
rather, being thrust from thence, toward the nervous Appendix, causes
particular and respective Spasms, near the places affected: But sometimes, if
the Spasmodic matter be more plentiful and strong, and the constitution of the
brain weak, the heterogeneous Copula, being fixed to the Spirits, not only in
the nervous stock, but also to those planted within the Encephalon it self,
causes the Epilectick disposition; and the explosive particles of the Spirits,
and this Copula knocking one against another, stir up the falling fit. For
indeed, since the assault of the Epilepsie urging, the Insensibility, and great
disorder is for the most part the first Symptom, and all the pathognomick, it
may be concluded, that the animal Spirits, lying within the middle of the brain
it self, are affected before others; and that therefore, that part, is the
principal seat of the Disease: Then, forasmuch as the falling of the sick, or
casting to the ground, and spasms of the members and Viscera, most often follow
that Insensibility great disorder, or leaping forth, of the spirits, it follows
that the animal Spirits also inhabiting the nervous System, are imbrued with
the same explosive Copula, and are drawn into consent with those inhabiting the
brain it self, and are excited by them, to explosions purely inordinate;
although sometimes (by the whole series of Spirits, planted both in the brain
and nervous stock, being like a long train of gunpowder, praedisposed to
explosions) an exterior Spasm, beginning a great way off, perhaps in some
member or Inward, may afterward be carried to the Brain, as shall be more
fully shown hereafter. In the mean time, it is concluded, that the region of
the Brain it self, is always the primary seat of this Disease; and that we
ought to suppose, the conjunct cause of the Distemper, not to be water heaped
up within the ventricles of the brain, nor a thick or clammy humor, impacted
in the passages of its pores: for such Causes are begotten by degrees, and
therefore would show some certain signs beforehand, of the first coming upon
one: further, the assault of the fit being over, such a matter could not be
wholly discussed in so short a time, but that from its relics, some
impediments of the animal function would remain, which indeed rarely happens in
the Epilepsie, unless inveterate: but, for the exciting of the falling down,
no less can be imagined, then that the animal Spirits, which flowing within
the marrowie substance of the brain, perform the acts of the interior sense, of
the Imagination, and appetite, having gotten an heterogeneous Copula, should be
inordinately exploded, and so they being disturbed beyond their orders and
stations, the Superior faculties of the animal regimen, must suffer an eclipse;
then, from this greater explosion of spirits, as it were from a fiery
enkindling, other Spirits, inhabiting the marrowy and nervous appendix, being
also praedisposed to explosions, conceive the like disorder, and in like
manner, cause the explosive Convulsive motions, of the containing Bodies.

For although we conclude, that the middle of the brain, The disease affects
secondarily very many parts, of the Nervous System.
is always the primary seat of the Epilepsie, and that from the beginning, the
morbific matter is laid up wholly in that Region; yet the distemper growing
grievous, this being more plentifully spread through the head, enlarges its
bounds, so that it being strowed here and there, and far and near stretched
out, Spasmodic particles, are cast into the rest of the Brain, and also into
the nervous appendix, like gunpowder or explosive seed, whereby it comes to
pass, that at the first approach of that disorder of Spirits, Convulsions
follow, sometimes in these, sometimes in those parts, and not rarely through the
whole Body.

CHAPTER III. The Differences of the Epilepsie, and the reasons of some of the
Symptoms are unfolded. Also its Curatory Method is represented.
THus far of the essence, and the Causes in general of the Epilepsie, it shall
be now our next task, to explicate the differences of this Disease, also the
reasons of some of the accidents, and Symptoms, belonging to it: to which we
will lastly add, Observations and Histories of sick people, with the method of
Curing.

The most notable difference of the Epilepsie, is wont to be taken from the
Subject, to wit, that the brain, or part of it, laboring with this disease, is
either primarily, and Idiopathetically, or properly, affected, or secondarily,
and not but by consent, with other parts: concerning the former kind, we have
hitherto discoursed, as to the other, to wit, in which the falling down seems
to arise, from some place without the head, and then lays hold of it
secondarily, and as it were by a blast sent from elsewhere; It is to be
observed, that this kind of distemper (as Galen has noted) proceeds either
from the external, or internal parts: The Reason of the Epilepsie which is said
to be excited by consent.
we meet with many examples of Epilepticks, in whom the fit being just coming
upon them, a spasm is felt, with a numness in the hand or toe, or other
particular member, which presently from thence, as it were with a pricking of
tingling, creeps toward the head, which when it has attained, immediately the
sick party falls flat on the Earth, and is hurried into Insensibility and
disorder of spirits, and other proper demonstrations of the Symptom of the
falling sickness: neither is it a less usual proaemium of this disease, that
there first arises as it were a conflict, in the stomach, spleen, womb,
Intestines, genitalls, or other inwards; or that some kind of perturbation is
raised in some of them; then from that place, the ascent of (as it were) a cold
air is perceived, to which distemper, follows the accession of the falling
evil, with its most horrid provision of symptoms: hence it was commonly
believed, that the cause of the Epilepsie, lay hid in the part, seen to be so
primarily affected, and propagated its evil to the brain, of its self innocent.

The Conjunct Cause of the Epilepsie consists only in the brain.
But in very deed, as to this, we must say, that in every Epilepsie, not only
the procatartick or remoter Cause, but also the conjunct, remains wholly in the
Brain; to wit, that the spirits inhabiting it, being disposed to explosions,
and there being explosed, bring on or Cause every falling Evil. As to those
praeliminary Symptoms in some Epileptical people, they sometimes have the place
of an Evident Cause, and sometimes only of a sign: For when the evil
disposition of any inward, as the stomach, spleen, or womb, happens with the
disposition of the Epilepsie, as often as any perturbation is begun in that
distempered Inward, it easily happens, by reason of a transmission of the
ferment from thence, or a continuation of the spasm to the head, an Epileptical
fit is excited in the Brain prae-disposed to act.

But these kind of symtoms of the falling evil, which being suscitated from
without, seem to propagate the distemper to the Brain, do often arise from the
consent of the Brain it self, and are only signs of the approach of the
Epileptical Fit, or of the spirits beginning to be exploded, in the brain: For
when the animal spirits planted in the middle parts of the Brain, and Cerebel,
and also those in the oblong pith or marrow, near the beginnings of the Nerves,
are so filled with an heterogeneous Copula, that, for the Casting of it off,
they are ready to bring on the assault of the Disease, before they are all
exploded heap by heap, some spirits lying more outward, in some private Nerves,
because they are destitute of the wonted influx of their superiors, fall into
certain inordinations, and so begin spasms, which spasms (as it is often the
manner in this kind of distemper) begin at the extremities or ends of the
Nerves, inserted to this or that member, or Inward, from whence by degrees,
they creep forward to their beginnings; whether being come forth with the
spirits, through the whole Encephalon, before disposed to explosions, being
moved by that spasms, and so being snatched away with a fiery enkindling, are
suddenly exploded or thurst out; so they seem to stir up the Epileptick Fit,
beginning at first from themselves, as it were secondarily, and by instinct,
brought from some other place. After this manner, sometimes the Histerical
passions, when beginning in the bottom of the belly, they are Communicated to
the Brain, are thought to arise from those Viscera, and to be stirred up by
their fault; when in the mean time, the morbific cause subsists chiefly, about
the beginnings of the Nerves, as we have elsewhere signified, and shall again
show hereafter, when we come to treat particularly of the Spasmodick distempers.

There yet remain other differences of the Falling sickness, to wit, that it is
either haereditary, or acquired; again, either kind is variously distinguished,

by reason of the Age, or time, in which it first comes upon one, to wit, when
the first coming of it happens before, or about the puberty, or being of ripe
age, or after it; further as to the Efficacy of the disease, into strong, and
weak, for as much as the Paroxysms or fits, are with, or without the disorder
of spirits, and falling, as to its inordinate manner, whose assalts are
wandering, and uncertain, moreover, it is wont to be distinguished, according to
the peculiar symptoms, in these, or those sick people, by reason of some
disposition, or manifold Idiosyncrasy, or propriety, of the Temperament.

But from what has been said before, of very many of the Symptoms, which are to
be met with in this Disease, the causes do easily appear, so that there will be
no need here, to consider all of them: but of some of them, which seem more
intricate, it will not be from the matter, to discourse in this place.

We will therefore first of all inquire, why those sick of this Disease, Why
Epilepticks fall down with violence.
do not fall as those that are apoplectick, or have swounding fits, but are
rather stricken down with violence, against the Earth, or any other bodies, that
are by chance opposite to them, as if they were smitten down by some wicked
Spirit, so that very often, some part of the head, or face, is hurt, with the
violent fall: And those so distempered, even like the Daemonaicks in the
Gospel, are frequently flung into the fire, or the water: but it may be here
declared, that the Epilepticks become obnoxious to these kind of evils, for
that the fit coming upon them, all knowledge or providence is taken from them;
and further the nerves neighboring to the head, being strongly contracted, the
whole bulk of the Body is carried away headlong: but in the Syncope, and
Apoplexy, the fall of the distemperd Body, seems as the ruins of a building,
which happens, by reason that its props are taken away: but indeed in the
falling Sickness, it is no otherwise than if a house were overthrown, by the
blowing up of Gunpowder, which is removed much from the place where it stood.

2ly. It is commonly esteemed a great pathognomick, From whence the Foam at the
mouth of these troubled with the falling sickness comes.
or peculiar Symtom of the Epilepsie, if when the diseased being fallen to the
earth, and suffering most horrid Convulsions, there flows from the mouth, a
spumous Spittle or foam, which indeed is thought to be pressed from the Brain,
being strongly contracted, into the palate: But in truth, though it be granted,
that this flux of spume be very often a sign of the falling Sickness, yet it
is not so appropriated to this disease, but that the same sometimes happens in
the Apoplexy, in deep sleep, in hysterical distempers, and other convulsive
diseases: Besides, this kind of Foam, does not descend from the Brain, for
there is no passage open, by which it may pass, but from the Lungs being
inflated, and elevated even to the Larinx, or the top of the sharp artery,
from whence spittle foams forth, with a certain fervency and ebullition: For
the fit of the falling evil growing urgent, when most of the nerves in the
whole Body are drawn together, those also that serve for the motions of the
Lungs, and Diaphragma, suffer most cruel convulsions, and lifting up all the
praecordia upwards, continue them almost immovable, in a long Systole, so that
the breathing, and pulse, cannot be at all perceived: In the mean time, because
the blood straightened within the bosom of the heart, distends it, and also almost
choakes it, the Lungs however hindered, that they cannot be moved after their
wonted and natural manner, perform what they can, with a thick and hasty
agitation, whereby the blood may be drawn forth from the Heart; by which
endeavor of theirs, the shaking air, by the frequent or thick respiration,
raises the viscous or clammy humidity into froth, like the shaking of the white
of an egg; by and by it lifts it upwards toward the Cavity of the mouth, and
so at last drives it out of doors: wherefore, a foam or spumous spittle does
often succeed in other distempers, where the pneumonic or breathing nerves are
either contracted, or are hindered from performing their Function.

Why some in the Falling knock their Breasts.
3ly. Moreover, from the same reason it comes to pass, that some Epilepticks
being fallen to the ground, beat most greviously their Breasts with their
Hands, and are hardly to be held from it: for when the Praecordia, being
troubled with the Spasm, and hindered that they cannot move themselves, after
their wonted manner, and the blood stagnating in them, not without a great
oppression of the heart, threatens a suffocation of Life; then it is that the
sick strikes their Breast, to wit, that the praecordia so shaken, and as it
were moved up and down, might renew their motions, and so the blood might be
relieved from its stagnation, and the heart from its heavy oppression: and this
is done after the same manner, as when some that are sleeping being tickled, or
bit by a flea, unknown to themselves, presently rub, or scratch the affected
place.

The prognostication of the Disease.
As to the Prognostication of the disease, we have already declared, that it is
of very difficult Cure, which difficultly consists in this, that the middle of
the Brain (in which is the chief spring and fountain of the animal Spirits) is
very much debilitated, not only by the morbifick cause, but also by its
effects, to wit, the several fits; and its pores loosened, so that they ly open
for the entrance of every heterogeneous matter: and so the morbid disposition
it self being confirmed, by the repeated Paroxisms, and taking deeper root, it
is hardly taken away. But it is to be observed, that the Epilepsie sometimes
terminates of it self, and is sometimes overcome by the help of medicines:
which happens about the age of puberty, and then only, so that, who are not
cured, that time being elapsed, that is before the twenty fifth year of age,
they scarce ever after recover their health, for about the time of ripe age,
there is a twofold alteration of the humane Body, and therefore, there often
happens a Solution or loosing of the falling sickness, or of any other disease
deeply rooted: For first, at that time, the genital humor begins to be heaped
together in the spermatick Vessels, from whence it follows, that the
Spiritious particles, and what are wont to grow to them, nitro-sulphureous and
morbifick particles, are laid up, not only in the brain, but also in the
testicles: wherefore, if this heterogenious Copula of the Spirits, be more
plentifully carried to that new storehouse, from thence, the brain becoming
free; often leaves the epileptical or otherways morbid disposition. 2. About
the time of ripe age, as the Blood pours forth something before destinated for
the brain, through the Spermatic Arteries, to the genitals, so also it receives
as a recompense, a certain ferment from those parts, through the veins: to wit,
certain particles imbued with a seminal tincture, are carried back into the
bloody mass, which makes it vigorous, and inspire into it a new and lively
virtue, wherefore at that time, the gifts both of the Body and mind, chiefly
show themselves; Hairs break out, the voice becomes greater, the courses of
women flow, and other accidents happen, whereby it is plain, that both the
blood and nervous Juce, are impregnated with a certain fresh ferment:
wherefore, the morbific ferments or seeds, unless they be overcome by this new
natural firment, they afterward continue untameable even to Death.

But that the Epilepsie is sometimes cured by the help of medicines, Experience
does testify: we shall anon discourse of the method of healing, and show the
reasons of the most famous medicines; in the mean time, as to what further
belongs to the prognostication of this Disease, if it end not about the time of
ripe age, neither can be driven away by the use of medicines, there happens yet
a diverse event in several sick Patients, The Epilepsie is changed into other
Diseases.
for it either ends immediately in Death, or is changed into some other Disease,
to wit, the Palsy, stupiditie, or melancholy, for the most part incureable.

As to the former, whenas the fits are often repeated, and every time grow more
cruel, the animal function is quickly debilitated; and from thence, by the
taint, by degrees brought on the Spirits, and the Nerves serving the
Praecordia, the vital function is by little and little enervated, till at
length, the whole body languishing, and the pulse being loosned, and at length
ceasing, at last the vital flame is extinguished.

But that this Disease often ends in the Palsy, melancholy, or madness, the
reason is, because the tone, and confirmation of the brain is depraved, by the
often explosions of the animal Spirits, and at length its natural state is so
perverted, that, by the morbifick particles of another Kind also admitted, the
spirits are fixed, nor are any more exactly prone to explosions, but rather
sometimes, by a contrary vice introduced, their Elastick virtue is too much
wanting, so that they become dull and sluggish beyond measure; even, as
oftentimes the intemperature of the blood, being more cold than it should be,
admits the more intense burning of a feavour: and indeed, these depressions of
the spirits happens partly by their own proper fault; for that their more agill
particles being too much explosed, the more dull or heavy are only left, and
from them they are supplied, but partly, as we have said, they happen from the
fault of the brain; for that its pores and passages, are so dilated and opened,
from the often paroxisms of this falling evil, that afterward, there is an
open passage made, for any heterogeneous, and diverse kinds of morbifick
particles, to enter with the Nervous juce.

Thus much for the Diagnosis and Prognosis, the description and judgment of the
Epilepsie, or falling sickness; in the unfolding of which, Of the Curatory
part of the Epilepsie.
it was necessary to bring reasons not altogether abstruse, and different from
the common Pathologie, neither are we constrained to receade, in the
Therapeatick or Curatory part of this Disease, from the common and usual
method of curing, in other Distempers: But in truth, are prescriptions of such
who follow the ordinarily received Opinions, by which, for the most part, they
endeavor to carry away, and wholly to eradicate the morbific matter, by
Catharticks only, do little or nothing avail in the falling sickness, yea they
are wont frequently to be hurtful to it. I have known some famous
Practitioners, omitting wholly the series of the Curatory intentions, betake
themselves to certain Empirical Remedies, without any foresight of the whole:
this kind of practice, tho sometimes it succeeds happily, would much more
certainly perform the proposed cure, if the Body being rightly prepared, they
should in like manner take away all Impediments, by other medicines.

Wherefore, the Indications concerning the Cure of the Falling Sickness, shall
be (as they are Commonly set down) either Curatory, which have respect to the
Fit, and drive it away either coming on, or when upon them, to set it going the
sooner: or prophylactic or preventory, which have respect to the Cause of the
Disease, which if they can take away, its accessions will be inhibited
afterward.

A general evacuation has scarce any place in the former Intention, for in the
fit neither a Vomit, or Purge, and very rarely the opening a vein, are wont to
be administered; if the amazed Insensibility and disorder continues very long,
sometimes a Clyster is wont to be used, but what that chiefly aims at is, to
fix the too fierce and Volatile animal Spirits, and also to suppress their begun
Explosions: For which ends, two kind of Remedies chiefly are made use of, to
wit, First, such as repress the animal spirits, being too apt to grow firce and
to leap forth, and repel them with some perfume that is ungrateful to them,
and Compel them into order: which thing indeed medicines imbued with a
volatile, or armoniack salt, or also with a vitriolic sulphur do effect, of
which kind are salt and oil of Amber, Spirits of Blood, Hartshorn, Sut,
tincture of Castor, and such like: for these being inwardly taken, or put to
the nose, often times bring help, and the evil Spirits of this Disease, are
thought to be driven away, even as in Tobit, the Devil was by the fume of the
gall of a fish. Secondly, the animal spirits are called away, or hindered from
their begun explosions, when they are allured, or held busied in some work,
they are accustomed to: wherefore, the fit urging, frictions being used and for
some time continued, through the whole body, do often help: But some that set
upright the diseased, and altogether hold or restrain their Arms and legs, from
their Convulsive motion, or hold them violently in this or that posture; that
also blow things into their noses to make them sneese, and power down strong
Cordials at the mouth, and apply either Cupping glasses, and Scarrifications,
and handle more sharply with other manner of administrations those sick people,
and disturb the manner of the fit, I say this kind of practice is most often
too roughly instituted or ordained: because after this manner, there is a
double trouble put upon nature, to wit, one from the disease, and the other not
lighter from the standers by, and helpers, when it were wuch better, for the
Fit to be suffered to pass over after its own manner, and the sick to endure
but one trouble only.

Truly the chiefest care of a Physician, and efficacy of medicines is used
about the prevention of this Disease, that the cause being taken away, or its
root cut off, all the fruits might wither; medicines requisite to this
Indication, respect many Intentions, which may yet be reduced, to those two
chief heads: to wit, in the first place, that the enkindling or matter of the
disease, being supplied immediately from the vicious Blood, or nervous Juice,
and mediately from the viscera, and first passages, be cut off; then in the
second place, that the evil disposition of the Brain, and the spirits its
Inhabitants, which is peculiar to the Epilepsie, be taken away.

As to the first Indication, here Vomits, purges, and other things, both
evacuating, and altering, yea phlebotomy, and Cauteries, have place; for as
much as by these means and ways, the impurites both of the viscera, and humors
are subdued or brought away; and their dyscrasie or evil disposition amended:
for although these kind of medicines, and medicall administrations, rarely or
never cure the Epilepsie, by themselves, yet those take away impediments, set
nature upright, and incite her to encounter her enemy; also, they prepare the
way, that so specific Remedies might more certainly, and efficaciously show
their virtues; wherefore usually, whilst they take care to cure this disease
with secrets and hidden mysteries, they make use of those kind of medicine
between whiles, in the spring, and autumn, and other fit times.

2ly. As to specific Remedies, which indeed only, though not allways, are able
to reach the Epilepsie and to subdue it; of which sort are the male Paeonie,
Missletow, Rue, Castor, the Claws of an Elk, preparations of a dead man's Skull,
Amber, Corrall, with many others. Forasmuch as these are taken without any
sensible evacuation, or also perturbation, following in the viscera or humors,
it is a wonder, by what formal reason, or virtue of acting, they are wont at
any time to help in this disease.

In what the Virtue of the specificks consists in the Epilepsie.
Concerning this matter, intricate and obscure enough, if there may be place for
Conjecture, when as we have already asserted, the procatartick Cause of the
Epilepsie, to consist in the heterogeneous Copula, joining or cleaving to the
spirits, inhabiting the Brain, and inciting them to praeternatural explosions;
it follows, that those things which take away, or resist such a cause, must be
of that nature, that by strengthening the brain, and binding up its pores, may
exclude that Copula, and so fix, and as it were bind the spirits, flowing
within the middle or marrow of the Brain, from leaving their Copula, that they
shall not be any more apt or prone, to irregular explosions; Perhaps after the
same manner, as when gunpowder or aurum fulminans being pounded with sulphur,
or sprinkled with spirit of Vitriol loses its thundering virtue. And indeed,
these kind of properties, to wit, one or both of them, may be suspected, yea,
in a manner detected, in most anti-epileptick Remedies: For truly, Paeony,
Missletow, Rue, the Lilly of the valley, with many others, abound in a certain
manifest astriction, that it is likely, their Particles being taken inwardly,
and so dilated to the brain, by the Vehicle of the blood, and nervous Juice, do
so bind, and shut up its too loose and open pores, that afterward, they do
not ly open, for the Passage of the morbifick matter: Besides, for that these
vapourous Concerts, breath forth as it were an armodiack scent or scattering,
therefore they are said to purify the animal spirits, to fix them, and to
strengthen them, having put off their heterogeneous Copula: This virtue
purifying the spirits, proceeding from an ammoniac salt, is more apparent in
Remedies, which are taken from the famuly of Mineralls, and Animalls, such are
the preparations of the humane Skull, of blood, amber, and coral, as the other
more binding, rather exists, in the parts and preparations of Vegitables.

It will not be needful here, for the curing of the Epilepsie, to propose a
complete method of healing, with exact forms of prescriptions, because there
are extant every where among Authors, general precepts, and most choice
Remedies, and the Prudent Physician will easily accomodate, both the
Indications, and that plentiful provision of medicinal stuff, to the
particular Cases of the sick. But because we have exhibited a quite new Theorie
of this Disease, here also ought to be rendered a Curatory method fited for it:
which we shall describe by and by more fully, after we have shown you some
cases or Histories, of people sick of the Epilepsie.

A fair maid, sprung from parents indifferently healthful, being her self very

That in this Case, the Vertigenous Distemper, with a short delirium, was the
forerunner of the Epilepsie, it plainly argues, the original of this Disease
being planted in the middle of the brain, to depend upon a certain inordination
of the Spirits; to wit, those dwelling there, at the beginning, begun to admit
an heterogeneous Copula; which being more plentifully heaped up, being moved
either of its own accord, or occasionally, while it was shaken off, induced, by
reason of the spirits being disturbed, and not yet very explosive those former
distempers; Afterward, from the same cause, by degrees growing worse, the
perturbations of the Spirits did raise up their manifest explosions, and
changed the vertigo, and Delirium, into the Epilepsie.

But that this maid began to be sick, about the time of ripe age, it hence
evidently follows, as the natural ferment, so sometimes the praeternatural,
explicates it self, first at that time; wherefore, as it happens, that the
menstruous purgations do then first break forth, so the seeds of the falling
sickness, whether innate or acquired then budded forth a little, and by
degrees were ripened into fruit: when the praeternatural Ferment first appears,
ofttimes the natural following, blots it out, hence the Epilepsie of young
ones, often ends about the time of puberty or ripe age, but if that Firment, or
taint of the disease, comes after the menstruous flux, or together with it, and
ceases not presently, it remains for the most part afterward, during Life, of
it self untameable, and not to be overcome by any Remedies.

From this observation, that a Cautery accidentally, and by chance being made
on this sick party, freed her from the fits of the Disease, it may be inferred
that fontanells or Issues, may be profitably administerd, in the Cure of the
Epilepsie: for wheresoever an emissary is opened, for the constant carrying away
of the serous water, both from the blood, and nervous juce, there very many
heterogeneous and morbifick particles, flow out with it, that therefore the
brain might remain free.

The Daughter of a Brewer of Oxford, had been very obnoxious to a Rheum be
tormented with Epileptick sits, of which she suffered near the greater changes
of the moon, especially then returning: Being asked to endeavor her Cute, I
gave her a Vomit of precipitate Solar, and order^d it to be renewed three days
before every new, and full moon; besides that she should take at every turn,
for four days after the Vomit, twice in a day, a dram of male-Paeonic root in
powder, with a draught of black Cherry water. By these remedies, the fits so
long intermitted, that the Disease seemed to be Cured. Afterward when they
returned again, she was again recovered by the use of those medicines: and then
the menstruous flux breaking forth, and observing its true periods, she
remained for the future, free from that disease.

The Therapeutic or Curatory Method.
IN the Curing of the Epilepsie, I judge it fit to begin with a Cathartick, and
if the sick can easily bear vomiting, first let an Emetick be administered, and
for several months, let it be repeated, four days before the full of the Moon.
For infants, and youths, may be prescribed wine of Squills, mixed with fresh
Oil of Sweet Almonds, or also of Salt of Vitriol, from half a Scruple, to 1.
Scruple: For those of riper years and of a stronger Constitution may be
prescribed the following forms of Medicines. Vomitories.
Take of Crocus mettalorum, or of Mercurius vitae gr. iiii. to vi. of Mercurius
Dulcis grain xvi. i. let them be bruised together in a mortar, mix it with the
pap of a roasted Apple or of Conserve of Burage i. make a Bolus; or you may take
an Infusion of Crocus Mettalorum or Mercurius Vitae made in Spanish wine from
ss. to i ss. or take of Emetick Tartar of Mynsicht gr. iv. to vi. who are of a
tenderer constitution, let them take of the Salt of Vitriol i. to ss, and half
an hour after let them drink several pints of posset drink: then with a
feather or finger put down the throat, let vomiting be provoked, iterate it
often.

The day following the vomiting, unless any thing shall prohibit, let blood be
taken out of the Arm, or from the haemorhod veins with a Leech: then the next
day after let a purging medicine be taken, which afterward may be repeated
constantly, four days before every new Moon.

Purger.
Take Refine of Jalop ss. Mercurius Dulcis i. of Castor gr. iii. of Conserve of
the Flowers of Paeony i. make it into a Bolus. Take pill faetida the greater
ii. of Hysterica what will suffice, make thereof v. pills. Take of the strings
of black hellebore macerated in Vinegar, dried, and powdered ss. of Ginger ss.
of the Salt of Wormwood gr. xii. of the Oil of Amber drops ii. make a powder,
let it be given in the pap of an Apple. Take of the powder of Hermodactils
compound i. of humane Scull prepared gr. vi. make a powder, let it be given in
a draught of the decoction of Hyssop, or Sage.

On those days that they do not purge, especially about the time of the
changing of the Moon, let there be administered Specific Remedies morning and
evening, which are said to cure this Disease, wirh (...) certain innate and
secret virtue: of these there are extant a very great company, and are
prescribed in various forms of Compositions.

Specificks.
The most simple Medicines, which Experience has found to be very Efficacious,
are the root of the male Paeony, and the seeds of the same. Take of the Root of
the Male Paeony dried and powdered i. to ii. or iii. let it be given twice a
day in the following Tincture. Take of the leave of Messletow of the Oak ii. of
the root of Paeony sliced ss. of Castor i. let them be put into a close Vessel
with simple water of Betony or Paeony, and white wind Each lb i. of the Salt of
Missletow, of the Oak or the Common Missletow ii. let them digest close in hot
sand for ii. days, let them take iii. with a dose of the aforesaid powder.

Poor people may take of the aforesaid powder, in a decoction of Hysop or
Castor, made with fair water and white wind.

At the same time, let the Root of Paeony be cut into little bits, and being
strung upon a third, hung about the neck. Also let the Roots being fried in a
pan, or boiled tender, be eaten daily with their meat.

Take of the Roots and Seeds of the male Paeony each ii. of Missletow of the
Oak, of the hoof of Elk i. each let them be fliced and bruised, and put into a
thin silk bag, and hang at the pit of the Stomach.

Among the spicificks, this powder is greatly commended by many Authors.
Powders.
Take of Castor Opoponax, Dragons blood, Antimony, and the seed of Paeony, each
alike, make a powder, of which may be taken ss. to i. every morning, with wine,
or some proper decoction, or with black Cherry water.

Take of a man's Skull prepared i. of Missletow of the Oak, of Counterfeit
Cinaber, of an Elks Claw, each ss. so mingle them. The dose is ss. to i.

If the form of powder be distastful to any one, or if it should become
loathsome by the long use of it, Electuaries, Pills, Troches, Spirits, and
Elixirs, each of which agree with specific medicines, are wont to be
prescribed.

Take of the Conserve of the male Paeony, of the Lilly of the Valley, each iii.
Electuaries.
of the seed and root of the male Paeony powdered each ii. prepared Coral i.
of the powder of Pearls, and of humane Skull prepared, each ii. of the salt of
Missletow, of the Oak i ss. with what will suffice of the Syrop of Coral,
make an Electuary, let them take of it morning and evening, the quantity of a
Nutmeg.

Take of the powder of the root of the male Paeony i. of the seeds of the same
ss. of Missletow of the Oak. of an Elks claw, of humane Skull, prepared, each
ii. of the roots of Angelica, Contrayerva, Verginian Snakeweed, each i. of the
whitest Amber, of Calcined Coral each i. of the Common Salt of Missletow, ii.
of Sugar Candy viii. dissolved in what will suffice, of the Antiepilepticall
water of Langius. Make a Confection, of which take twice in a day, the quantity
of a Nutmeg.

These powders, by adding to them, the Salt of Amber, and Hartshorn, Pills.
with what will suffice of Balsome Capivi may be formed into a pillulary Mass,
of which may be taken iii. or iv. pills, in the morning and evening, drinking
after them a draught of some appropriat Liquor.

Or of those sorts may be prepared an Elixir, of which may be taken viii. drops
to x. twice in a day, in a spoonful of a proper Julup, drinking a little of it
after it.

Take of Hungarian Vitriol vi. pints, Elixir.
let them be distilled with a glass retort in hot sand for 24. hours, then let
the same retort, being defended or done over with Clay, be put with a large
receiver in a reverberating Furnace, that the acid spirits may be forced with a
most strong fire, till they come forth. The whole Liquor being distilled, let
it be drawn off in hot sand, in a lesser glass retort, and let there be poured
into the Matrace, of the roots of Male-Paeony, cut into pieces and dried iiii.
of the seed of the same i. of humane Skull prepared, of Elks claws, and Red
Coral each ss. Missletow of the Oak, ii. let it digest with a gentle heat for
several days, to the extraction of a tincture, the Liquor being decantated, let
it be drawn off in a glass Retort to a third part remaining: being stilled
forth keep it by it self: to those Remains pour of the rectified Spirit of wine
a little quantity, impregnated with the Infusion of the same ingredients, and
let it digest for six days in horse-dung, the dose of which is ss. to i. The
distilled Liquor may be given from half a spoonful to a whole spoonful, for the
same Intentions.

Or let there be prepared an oil, out of the Salt of Venus or Copper, according
to the description of Henry Van Heers, and given as there prescribed.

Among the specific Remedies, Emperical Remedies.
which (when the former shall not be profitable) ought also to be tried, are
the Livers of Frogs, the Gall of a Bore, dried with Urine, The powder of Bryony
Root. The powder of a Cuccow, of Crows; the runnet and lights of a Hare, the
Liver of a Wolf, stones taken out of Swallows, the Liver of a Kite, the Eggs of
Crows, with many more, to be daily taken with food or Medicine; a famous
Catalogue of which is extant of Henry Van Brays, a Physician of Zutphen: and
from which, prescripts for poor people, may be taken, easy to be prepared, and
without great cost.

Whilst these kind of Remedies are to be taken inwardly, according to the
aforesaid method, some outward administrations being applied, bring help, and
are deservedly admitted to part of the cures; therefore, allways Issues are
made in this disease, in one fit place or other, and also more often
Veficatories or Blisters.

Amulets hung about the neck, or born at the pit of the Stomach, Amulets.
are thought to be useful: The fresh Roots of Paeony cut into little squares,
and being strung like bracelets, and hung round about the neck, and as soon as
they are dry, let new be put in their places, and they being reduced to powder,
may be taken inwardly: Take of the roots and seeds of Paeony each ii. of an
Elks claw, and humane Skull prepared, each i. of Missletow of the Oak, ss. let
them be beaten into gross powder, and sowed in a piece of red silk, and like a
little bag let it be hanged about the neck.

An Amulet of a stalk of the Elder, found growing in the Willow-tree, is
greatly Commended.

Plasters.
It agrees with some, to have their heads shaven and a plaster applied to the
forepart. Take of the root and seeds of Paeony, of Castor, Missletow of the
Oak, of humane-skull most finely powdered, each i. of betonie plaster ii.
Caranna Tacamahacca, each ii. Balsum Capive, what will suffice, make a mass,
and let it be spread upon leather, make a plaster for the suitors of the Head.

Let the Temples and Nostrills, be often anointed with Oil of Amber, by itself
or mixed with oil Capive.

Sternutories or sneezing powders.
Sneezing Powders, and such as purge the head of Rhume, are to be used daily in
the Mornings: Take of white Hellebore i. of Castor, and Euphorbium, each ss.
the leaves of sweet Marjorum, and Rue, each ii. make a powder; make a decoction
of Sage or Hyssop, with Mustard dissolved in it, with which gargle the mouth
and throat.

A Glister may be sometimes used, as need shall require.

Sometimes the more solid Medicines are to be moistened with liquids, or they
ought to be drunk after them, for which end, distilled waters should be at
hand, Julups, Tinctures, or Decoctions; which are endued with a certain
Specific Virtue against this Disease.

Distilled Water.
Take of Hungarian Vitriol four pound, of the powder of fresh humane-skull, four
ounces, of the root of Paeony sliced, six ounces, let them be bruised together
in a mortar, put to them either of Spanish wine, or small white wind, or wine
made of the juce of black-Cherries, a quart; being fermented in a vessel, let
it be distilled in a glass retort, in hot sand.

Take of the shavings of box-wood, of Hungarian vitriol, each two pound, of the
Missletow of the Oak, or the Common-Missletow leaves, three handfulls, of Rue
two handfulls, being bruised together, put to it of Spanish wine 4 pints: Let
them be distilled in a glass Cucurbit with hot sand.

Iulaps.
Take of Common Vitriol six pound, of the root of the male-paeony six ounces, of
the Missletow of the Oak one ounce, of Green-walnuts, viii. ounces, being cut
and bruised; let them be distilled in a glass-pot, a glass alembick being
placed upon it, in hot sand. Take of this Liquor one pint, of black cherry
water, and of the water of the flowers of the toil, or Line-tree, each half a

and chiefly to those called Great, or Notable: In this rank are placed
Diaphoreticks, Salivation, Bathes, and Spaws.

Alphonsus Ferrius affirms, that he had cured many Epileptical people, with a
decoction of simple Guaicum, being prescribed twice in a day, and taken, to vi.
or viii. ounces, and its second decoction drunk (as in the cure of the Pox)
instead of ordinary drink. If to such a decoction the roots of Paeony and other
specificks should be added, perhaps it would be more efficatious. It seems
probable, that a Salivation strongly excited from Mercury, and afterward a
sudoriferous or Sweating-Diet following, might certainly cure this Disease.
What Baths, or Spaw-waters are able to do, I have not observed, either by my
own or others experience. Perhaps I have made trial, that our Artificial
Spaws, sometimes have been available in Curing the Epilepsie, to wit, both
those impregnated with Iron, and also with Antimony, and taken in a great
quantity, for many days.

CHAPTER IV. Of other kinds of Convulsions, and first of the Convulsive Motions
of Children.
AFter the Epilepsie, as it were the principal Spasm, in the chief place
excited, to wit, within the middle part of the brain, the other Kinds of
Convulsions come to be treated of in order. The differences of those, are best
taken from a twofold kind of cause, and the various manners, and accidents of
either. We have already shown, that all Spasmodic distempers, do flow, either
from the mere irritation of the spirits or from their explosion, by reason of
the cleaving of an Elastick Copula to them, or jointly from both, together:
wherefore, the manifold Ideas of Spasms, may be distinguished, and distributed
into certain Classes, as it happens for this, or that cause, or either
together, to remain in the various places of the Encephalon, or the nervous
Appendix. For indeed, the Spasmodic matter, or the explosive Copula of the
Spirits, finding a passage chiefly, and most often through the Brain, and
sometimes in some measure through the extremities of the nerves, subsists either
about the origin of the nerves, or their middle processes, or their outmost
ends, or abounds in their whole passages, as shall be by and by more
particularly declared: Further, an irritation stiring up Convulsions by it
self, or with a previous remote cause, although it be made every where in the
nervous stock, yet it chiefly, and more frequently produces such an effect,
about the beginings, middle processes, and foldings, or ends of the Nerves. But
the same Kind of Cause and effects, are after one manner in Infants and
children, and another in youths, and those of riper age. Since therefore we
have determined, particularly to consider, all the kinds of Convulsions, we
will first discourse of the Convulsive motions of Infants, and Children.

Infants, and children, happen so ordinarily, and frequently to be tormented
with Spasmodick Distempers, that this is reconed the chief, and almost the only
Kind of Convulsions; for the Symptoms of this kind, in other more ripe
people, are wont to be called by other known Names, and referred to the
Epilepsie, hysteric, hypochondriac, Collie passions, or also to the Scurvie:
but in children, they are called, as it were by way of Excellency, Convulsions.

As to this we must observe, that children are found to be greatly obnoxious to
Convulsions, chiefly about two seasons, to wit, within the first month after
they are born, or about their breeding of Teeth: Although it often happens,
that the assaults of this Disease, may come also at other times, and from
certain other Causes.

In the first place therefore, it very often happens, that children newly born,
or at least er'e they are two months old, are afflicted at every turn with
Spasms, excited in diverse parts; for that inversions of the eyes, distortions
of the cheeks, and Lips, or tremblings, yea Contractions of the Tendons, and
frequent jerkings or leapings forth of the members, and sudden shakings of the
whole Body, infest them; and that the same effect likewise sometimes afflicts
the praecordia, appears plain enough, because whilst the Spasms busy the
Limbs, and outward members, also the face becomes now pale, now of a livid, or
dead Color, from the blood stagnating in the heart, and the Lungs being at
that time contracted. As therefore, Spasms are wont to infest three Regions of
the Body in children, to wit, the parts of the head and face, the outward
members and Limbs, and the Praecordia and viscera, we observe now these
regions, now those, now, two or all together to be possessed, by the morbific
Cause, to wit, as it is fixed, either about the beginings, or ends of the
nerves; and when the former of these happens, as the superior part of the
oblong pith, the middle, or the lowest part of the spinal marrow, is touched,
one, or more parts together, are assaulted by the morbifick Cause.

As to the other Causes of this Distemper, to wit, the procataric and evident,
those of the former Kind, do chiefly consist in two things, first that all the
parts of the Head in infants are very weak, and abound with a viscous humidity;
to wit, the Brain less firm, and the tone of the nerves very loose, so that
they are not able to bear the more light force of every matter, but the Spirits
inhabiting them, are easily incited into irregular motions or Spasms, by the
proper liquour, wherewith those parts are watered, if it flows never so little
immoderately, or at least more plentifully, than for the measure of so little
strength. But in the second place, because it appears by observation, that
children, not only, nor all, who are of a more tender Constitution, are found
to be prone to this Disease, therefore, this ought to be rather accounted for a
reason, of the more remote morbid Cause, that the Blood, and nervous Juce, are
originally vicious, in some Infants, by reason of evils contracted from the
womb: For that the sanguineous mass, wanting eventilation for many months past,
becomes impure in children newly born; wherefore, broad and Red puttings forth,
like the small pocks, show themselves through the whole skin, in most children,
soon after they are born; to which sort of wealks, or efflorescences, if they
are hindered, or repressed, oftentimes dangerous exulcerations, about the parts
of the mouth follow. Hence we may deservedly suspect, such impurities of the
blood, sometimes to be poured forth into the brain, and nervous stock,
considering their debility, and for that reason Spasmodic Distempers to arise;
to wit, whilst the blood being vicious from the womb, endeavors to purify it
self, it transfers its faeculencies into the head, which were wont to be
exterminated by the putting forth the Red-gum, or red spreadings through the
skin: Wherefore, a water now thin, and Serous, now thick and sticking, and
either participating of praeternatural Salts and sulphures, is laid up within
these or those recesses, and Cavities of the Brain, Cerebel, and oblong pith,
the recrements of which, when they begirt the beginings, or ends of this or
that nerve, and sometimes many together, affix on the Spirits inhabiting them,
heterogeneous particles, and apt for Spasmodic or Convulsive explosions. For as
soon as the nerves have deeply imbibed such particles, the spirits being
burdened with their Copula, endeavor either of their own accord, or being
incited by evident Causes, to thrust, and shake it off; and so they enter into
Spasmodic, or Convulsive explosions.

The evident Causes, which bring on Convulsive motions in children
praedisposed, are of two Kinds, viz. In the first place, whatsoever stir up
unwonted effervescencies of the blood, whether they be excesses of heat or
cold, a too plentiful nourishment, or hotter then should be, the changes of
the air, and weather, and chiefly the periodical times of the Moon; for by
reason of these, and other the like occasions, the Blood growing more hot than
by right it should be, affixes sooner to the Spirits an heterogeneous Copula,
even to a fullness, and causes it presently to be struck off, and exploded, by
them thoroughly disturbed. 2ly. An Irritation, in almost every part of the
nervous System, does not seldom bring into Act, a Spasmodic or Convulsive
Disposition: wherefore, not only an excess of tangible qualities, outwardly
inflicted, but the milk Coagulated in the stomach, choler, or other sharp
humors, or also worms knawing the Intestines, are wont to excite Spasms or
Convulsions: Besides, these kind of evident Causes, as they are stronger,
sometimes induce Spasmodick Distempers of themselves, and without a praevious
Disposition: even so worms, and perchance sharp humors, cause Convulsive
motions to some children, at least to the more tender.

That it might more certainly, and to the sense appear, what kind of morbific
matter might be in Convulsive motions, I have opened the dead bodies of many,
which this disease had oppressed: I have allways in vain sought the cause, within
the Visecra, and first passages of Concoction; In the heads of many, a serous
water being heaped up, within the Cavity, under the Cerebel, and distending the
Membrane which clothes the oblong pith or marrow, did overflow the beginings of
the nerves: in some, no footsteps of this Disease appeared: so that, what
sticking to the Spirits did irritate them into explosions, was of so
imperceivable a bulk, and its original so altogether hid, that it could not be
found out, by the most perspicatious scrutiny of the sight. Sometime past, in
this City, many chilbren of a certain woman dyed of this Disease, at length,
the fourth, as the others, dyed within the month; we dissected the Head, and
here no serous Colluvies or water did overflow the ventricles, but only the
substance of the Brain, and its appendix, was moister then ordinary, and
looser; what was most worthy of observation was, that in the Cavity, which lies
under the Cerebel, upon the trunk of the oblong pith, we found a remarkable
heap of clotter'd, and as it were concreted blood: but in truth it is
uncertain, whether this matter, deposited there from the beginning, had
primarily caused the convulsions; or rather, whether this blood being
extravasated, and expressed, by the contraction of the parts, planted round
about, was not the effect, and product of the Convulsions, and not the cause of
them; for also in Apoplectical people this kind of Phenomenon ordinarily
happens, which yet we shall afterward show, to be rather the effect, than the
cause of the disease.

Indeed, the heterogeneous Particles, which flow to the blood, from the womb,
are wont to be sent away through efflorencies or Cutaneous Pustles in the whole
Body, in many children, in others being poured on the head, are the material
cause of the Convulsive Distemper, may be inferred, besides the reasons before
recited, from the remedies chiefly helping: For that in little children
obnoxious to this haereditarie Disease, the Convulsive fits are best prevented,
if that an issue be made Presently after they are born, in the nape of the
neck, and blood drawn with a Leech from the jugular Veins; for the corruptions
of the nervous juce, are brought away by that, and the impure buddings of the
blood, are diverted from the head by this: by these ways of Administrations,
when before two or three children, of the same Parent, have dyed of
Convulsions, soon after they were born, all the rest have been freed from the
same evil.

2ly. Thus much concerning the Convulsive motions of Children, which are wont
to infest them, by reason of an Infection contracted from the womb. ^f that at
this bout they should escape the Disease it self, or at least its deadly
strokes, nevertheless, about the time of breeding teeth, they would be found at
last to be obnoxious, to the same danger: for when the Teeth, especially the
greater, are about to cut, oftentimes a feavour is excited, to which not seldom
Convulsions are Joined: and though at this Time, children are grown stronger,
and may better bear the fits of the disease, then when new born, yet the
convulsive Distemper, now stirred up by no other grievous occasion, becomes
very dangerous, and sometimes deadly.

But forasmuch as childern, who fall into feavours, about the time of breeding
of Teeth, are not all tormented with Convulsions, it therefore follows, that
some disposition to this disease, either innate, or acquired, does precede; and
that the pain caused from the breeding the Teeth, is to be esteemed only the
means of a more strong evident Cause, to wit, Children, who being endued either
with a Cacochymia, or juce causing ill digestion, or with a more weak
constitution of the brain, and nervous stock, have their animal Spirits too
much adulterated, or dissipable, are sometimes disposed for the coming of
Convulsive distempers: wherefore, when so acute pain, together with a feavor,
afflicts, that latent disposition is brought into Act.

If it be here asked, for what reason a feavour, and then Convulsive motions
following thereupon, come to those Praedisposed, in teething, it may be
answered, that either effect may be attributed to the pain, as the immediate
Cause: We experimentally know by our selves; what the torment is, that follows
an irritation about the roots of the Teeth; in truth so great, and so cruel,
that a more cruel can scarce be; for that one or two notable shoots, of the
5th pare of nerves, reaches to the roots of each Tooth, which when it ss hauled
by the sharp particles of the Blood, or other humors, there laid up, causes a
most sharp sense of trouble, or pain, by its Corrugation: But this kind of
Vellication or hauling of this Nerve, happens thus to children breeding teeth,
because that the membranes and fibers, are every way distended, by the Teeth,
now increasing into a greater bulk, and as yet included within the scarce
hollow gums: hence the blood being hindered in its Circulation, causes a tumor,
and so presses the nerves, and also pours on them the more sharp particles of
the Serum, by which, being notably pulled or hauled, they are tormented with
Corrugations, and painful Spasms.

Therefore, when so cruel pains happen to children, from their breeding Teeth,
it is no wonder if a feavour, and also Convulsive motions sometimes follow: the
former of these happens, both for as much as the blood being hindered about the
pained part, is not circulated with its wonted and equal course, wherefore it
becomes inordinatly moved, in the whole Body; and besides, because Spasms being
stirred up somewhere in the nervous stock, the corrugated and contracted
nerves, press together, and pull the Arteries, and by that reason, stir up
irregular and feavourish fluctuations in the Blood. But sometimes Couvulsions
happen in breeding Teeth, both because the blood growing hot, sends forth
heterogeneous particles, to the animal government, and so stirs up the spirits
into explosions; and besides also, when this acute pain, and as it were a
Lancing, follows upon the teeth being about to cut, it communicates a very
troublesome and irritative sense, from the affected parts, to the first
sensorie, presently from thence, the motion of the rage is retorted, by the
same or other neighbor nerves, which by reason of a praevious disposition,
does not rarely become convulsive.

Besides these two occasions of Convulsions (which are wont to be chiefly, and
more often in children) to wit, the times of Infancy, and breeding Teeth, this
Distemper also is excited at other Times very often, and for other Causes: For
in whom the Seeds of the Spasmodick Disposition is sown, they sometimes unsold
themselves presently after the birth, and are ripened into morbid fruit; or
else lying hid for a while, they now come before the breeding of Teeth, and
follow a long time after it; and by reason of other evident causes, to wit,
either external, or Internal; of which sort are a sickly, or breeding nurse,
milk Coagulated in the stomach, or degenerating into an acid or bitter
putrifection, a feavourish distemperature of the head, Ulcers or wealks of
other parts suddenly vanishing, the Changes of the air, the Conjunctions,
oppositions, and aspects of the Sun, and moon, and such like; they at length
break forth into Act, from an uncertain event. Concerning these, there is no
need, that we should particularly discourse.

When all the Children, of a man dwelling in the neighborhood, dyed of
Convulsions, within the space of three months, at length, to prevent that fatal
event, they sought for remedies, for a child newly born: I being sent for, a
few days after the being brought to bed, first advised the making an Issue in
the nape of the neck, then, that the next day after, a leech being applied to
the jugular vein of each side, two ounces of blood should be taken away:
besides, that about every conjunction, or opposite aspect of the Sun, and moon,
about five grains of the following powder should be given, in a spoonful of
Julap, for three days, morning and evening. Take of humane Skull prepared, of
the root of the male Paeonie, each i. of the powder of Pearls ss. of white
sugar i. mingle them, and make a very fine powder: Take of the waters of Black
Cherries iii. of the antiepileptic of Langius i. of the Syrrop of the flowers
of the male Paeonie vi. mingle them; also I ordered that the nurse at the same
times, should take a draught of whey, or posset drink, in which were boiled,
the seeds and roots of the male Paeonie, and the leaves of the Lilly of the
Valley, the Infant for about four months was well, but then began to be troubled
with Convulsions: at which time, the same Remedies being administered both to
the child, and to the nurse, in a larger dose, vesicatories also were applied
behind the ears, and blood was taken by the sucking of a Leech, from the
jugular veins: within two or three days the child grew well: afterward,
whenever within four or five months the Convulsions returned, it was cured
again, by the use of the same Remedies. After half a year, the Convulsive
motions wholly ceased, but a painful Tumor arose, about the lower part of the
Spinae dorsi or backbone, from which proceeded a certain distortion of the
Vertebrae, or joints of the back bone, and a weakness of the legs, and at
length a Palsy. It seems in this case, that the Spasmodic or Convulsive
matter, being wont to come upon the brain first, and beginings of the nerves,
entering at last the Spinal marrow, and being thrust out at its further end, it
wholly stopped up the heads of the appending nerves, and shut out the passage of
the Spirits: to wit, because other narcotick, and more thick, had joined
themselves, to the explosive particles.

The Curatory Method against the Convulsive Distempers in Children.
IT is to be endeavored either to prevent the Convulsive passions, threatening
Children and Infants, or to cure them being already begun.

For if the former children of the same parent, were obnoxious or liable to
Convulsions, that evil ought to be prevented timely, The Preservation of
Infants from Convulsions.
by the use of Remedies to those born after: It is usual for this end, to put
into the mouth of the child newly born, some antispasmodick Remedy, as soon as
it begins to breath: from hence some are wont to give them some drops of the
purest honey, others a Spoonful of Canary sweetened with Sugar, and some again
oil of Sweet Almonds fresh drawn, to some may be given half a Spoonful of
epileptic water, or one drop of oil of Amber.

Besides these first things given to Infants, which certainly seem to be of
some moment, certain other Remedies and means of Administrations, ought to be
used: to wit, let one spoonful of Liquor, proper to this distemper, be drunk
twice a day: as for example; Take of the water of black Cherry and of Rue each
i ss. of the Antiepileptic of Langius i. of the Syrrup of Coral vi. of
prepared Pearl gr. xv. mix them in a Viol. On the third or fourth day after the
birth, let an Issue be made in the nape of the neck, then if it be of a fresh
Countenance, let a little blood to about i ss. or ii. ounces be taken, by the
sucking of Leeches, from the jugular veins, having a care lest the blood should
flow out too plentifully in its sleep; let the temples, and the hinder part of
the neck, be gently rubbed with such a like ointment. Take of oil of nutmegs by
expression ii. of Capive iii. of Amber i. Let an Amulet be hung about the neck,
of the roots and seeds of the greater Paeonie, a little of the hoof of an Elke
being added to it.

Moreover antispasmodick Remedies, should be daily given to the Nurse: The
Method of Curing to be used to the Nurses.
Let her take morning and evening, a draught of whey or posset drink, in which
the roots and seeds of the male Paeonie, and sweet fenill seeds are boiled.
Take of the Conserve of the flowers of Betony, of the male Paeonie, and of
Rosemary each ii. of the powder of the Root, and flowers of the male Paeonie,
each ii. of red Coral prepared, and of the whitest amber each i. of the roots
of Angelica, and Zedoarie prepared, each ss. with what will suffice of the
Syrrop of Paeonie, make an Electuarie: let her take morning and evening, the
quantity of a Nutmeg.

Take of the powder of the root of Male-Paeony ii. the seeds of the same i.
make a powder; of the whitest Sugar iii. dissolved in the water of the flowers
of the Line-tree, and boiled to tablets, of the oil of Amber i. make tablets
according to Art, each weighing ss. let her eat one every sixth hour. Also let
her keep to an exact diet.

If any Infant be actually afflicted with Convulsions, because that an Issue
operates little, and slowly, it will be expedient to apply blistering
plasters, The Cure of Infants sick with Convulons.
to the nape of the neck, and behind the ears, and unless a more cold
temperament should gainsay it, let blood be drawn with Leeches, from the
veins: Let Liniments be used about the Temples, Nostrills, and hinder part of
the neck, and plasters also laid to the bottoms of the feet; Clysters that may
keep down the belly, should be daily administered: besides let specific
Remedies be inwardly taken, often in a day, to wit, every sixth or eighth hour.

Take of the oil Capive, of Caestor each ii. of Amber ss. make a Liniment.
Ointments.


Take of the plaster of Oxycrocia two parts, of dissolved Galbanum one part,
of oil of Amber i. make a plaster for the soles of the feet. Let there be
given of the powder of Ammoniacum, according to the description of Reverius,
twice or four times in a day.

Take of humane skull prepared, of the seeds of Paeony, of an Elks claw,
Powders.
of Pearls prepared, each ss. of Amber greese; gr. vi. make a powder; the dose
vi. grains, in a spoonful the Liquor hereafter described, three or four times
a day.

Or Take of humane Skull prepared, of pearls each ss. of the Salt of Amber i.
of the Sugar of Pearl i. the dose ss.

Or Take of the Spirit of hartshorn iii. drops, let it be given every sixth or
8th hour, in a spoonful of the Julap below prescribed.

To the children of the poor, may be administered the powder of the Roots of
wild Valerian ss. to i. let it be given twice a day, in a spoonful of milk, or
appropriate Liquor.

Vntzerus greatly commends the Gall of a sucking whelp, to wit, that the whole
juice of the gallie-Bag being taken forth, be given to the child to drink, with
a little of the water of the flowers of the Tile, or Line-tree.

A learned Physician lately told me, that he had Known many Cured with this
Remedy: Besides, Empericks are wont to cause the bigger children, after they
have drank the gall, to eat also the Liver of the whelp broyled.

Liquors.
Iulaps, distilled waters, and other appropriate Liquors, may be prepared, after
the following prescripts.

Take of black-Cherry water, iii. of the Antiepileptical water of Langius, i.
of perlate sugar, ii. mix them.

Take of the green Roots of the male Paeonie cut into little pieces vi. of
Hungarian Vitriol viii. of humane skull ii, of the Antiepileptic water of
Langius half a pint, mix them, and let them be distilled in a glass retort, in
hot sand, the dose i. spoonful, to ii.

Take of the fresh roots of the male Paeonie cut, iiii. being bruised in a
Marble mortar, pour to them of Spanish-wine, lib. i. make a strong expression,
add of manus Christi pearled, ss. let it be kept in a close glass. The dose i.
Spoonful, or ii. twice in a day.

Convulsions by reason of breeding of Teeth.
When Convulsive motions happen by Reason of the difficulty of breeding Teeth,
this Symptom as it is secondary and less dangerous, so the Cure, does not
always require the first or chief labor of healing, but sometimes we are
rather careful to remove it, by allaying the pain, and the feavourish
Distemper, wherefore both the patient, and the nurse, oughr to use a slender,
and refrigerating Diet; the Teeth being about to break through the Gums, their
passage should be made easy, by rubbing or cutting them; and also Anodynes
should be applied to those swelled, and grieved parts: Clysters and taking away
blood are often used: it behooves to cause sleep, and to attemper the feirceness
of the blood: some times antispasmodick Remedies are made use of, but the more
temperate, and such as do not trouble the blood, and humors, Vesicatories, or
Blistering plasters, because they aptly evacuate the serum, too much poured
forth on the Head, oftentimes bring help.

Spasms or Convulsions caused from other occasions.
When Children are troubled with Convulsions, not presently after they are born,
nor by reason of the cutting of their Teeth, but for other occasions, and
accidents; the cause of such a Distemper, for the most part subsists, either in
the head, or somewhere about the Viscera of Concoction. When the former is
suspected, as it is wont to be manifested by signs which argue a Serous
Colluvies, too much heaped up within the Head, the former Remedies, already
recited, ought to be given, in a larger dose; besides, in those, who are able
to bear purging, sometimes a Vomit, or a light purge is prescribed: Wine, and
Oxymel of squills, also Mercurius Dulcis, Rhubarb, and Resin of Jalap, are of
approved use.

As often as the Cause of the Convulsive Distemper seems to be in the Viscera,
either Worms, or sharp humors, stirring up the torments of the Belly, are
understood to be in fault.

By reason of worms.
Against Worms, a purge of Rhubarb, or Mercurius Dulcis, the Resin of Jalap
being added, is ordained: sometime past, a Child being miserably afflicted with
Convulsions, that he seemed to be just dying, I gave him a dose of Mercurius
Dulcis, with Resine of Jallap; with his stools, which were four, he voided xii.
worms, and presently grew well.

Take of the root of Verginian Snake-weed, in powder i. of Coral Calcined to a
whiteness ss. a powder i. the dose from half a scruple, to one scruple, twice
in a day, continued for three days, drinking after it a decoction of
Grass-roots. Take of the species of Hiera i ss. of Venice-Treacle ii. make a
plaster for the bottom of the belly, or apply to the Navel, a plaster of
Galbanum.

If the Convulsive motions are suspected to proceed from an irritation of the
ventricle, and intestines, made by sharp humors, a gentle purging, either by
vomit, or stool, or both successively ought to be instituted. For this end, let
them drink, a gentle Emetick, of wine of squills, or salt of vitriol; when even
the sicK are troubled with a striving to Vomit of their own accord: but if the
other Evacuation, or down-wards shall seem better to be tried; they ought to
take an Infusion of Rhubarb, or the powder, and Syrrop of succory with Rhubarb,
or of Roses with agaric and very often by these Remedies, timely applied, I
have seen the Convulsive Distempers in Children to be cured: besides in this
Case, Clysters are frequently used: but external Medicines are not to be
omitted; to wit, fomentations, ointments, plasters applied to the Belly.

Take of the flowers of Cammomel cut very small, ii. handfulls, let them be put
into two little bags, made of fine Linen, or Silk, which being dipped in warm
Milk, and wrung out may be applied successively to the abdomen, or lower region
of the belly.

Take of the tops or flowers of Mallows, in like manner but small, let them be
fried in fresh butter, of hogs Lard, and in the form of a Liniment, or a
Cataplasm, applied to the Belly.

CHAPTER V. Of Convulsive Diseases, of Ripe Age, arising chiefly by reason of
the Nervous origin being affected.
ALthough Convulsive Distempers, which happen to those of riper years, being
known by other Names, also are commonly reputed of some other stock, and are
wont to be referred to the passions called Hysterical, Hypochondriacal, or
Colical, or to the Scorbute; yet if the matter be a little better considered,
it will easily appear, that some Convulsive Symptoms, both in Men and Women, do
come from the Brain, which Convulsions properly and truly challenge to
themselves the Name: But these (as we have already mentioned) may be
distinguished after a various manner, by the manifold seat of the morbifick
Cause, but chiefly into these three kinds, viz. Into Spasms or Convulsions
stirred up, by reason of the origin of the Nerves being chiefly affected; into
others being stirred up, Three kinds of Convulsions happening to those of riper
years.
by reason of the extremities or ends of the Nerves, being possessed by the
morbifick matter; and lastly into such, from whose head the morbific matter
descending, fills the whole passages, or the most part, of some certain Nerves,
or of all together.

Therefore, that we may proceed, to unfold the Convulsions, Distempers arising
from the Nervous origin distinguished.
arising from the beginnings of the Nerves being affected, take notice here,
that the morbifick matter beseiging the beginnings of the Nerves, does
sometimes chiefly flow into the first pair of Nerves, to wit, which respect the
Muscles of the eyes and face, and from thence the contractions, and tremblings,
now of the Nose, Cheeks, or Lips, now of the Eyes, or the distortions of the
mouth, follow. Secondly, 1 According to the various Nerves being affected.
sometimes the wandering and intercostal pair do chiefly imbibe the
Heterogeneous particles; and then Inflations, or Contractions of the Abdomen,
and Hypochondria, and also the palpitation of the Heart, trembling, difficult
and interrupted breathing, an intermitting pulse, and other Symptoms of the
middle, and lower Belly, do very much infest. Thirdly, but sometimes the
morbifick Cause being placed lower, affects chiefly the spinal marrow, and
therefore the outward members, and limbs, are rendered obnoxious to inordinate
leapings forth, and contractions: Further, in very many Cases of this nature,
because the Animal spirits being explosed about the origin of the Nerves, do
inordinately leap back toward the Encephalon; for that reason, to all
Convulsions almost being excited by this means, the Vertigo, also the scotomie
or giddiness, the tingling of the ears, and sometimes the amassed Insensibility
or falling down of the Spirits, are joined, or follow.

But as we may Conjecture, from the various figures of the Convulsive
distemper, it seems, that the Convulsive matter hauling those, or these nerves,
2. According to the Various places of the same Nerves being affected.
or many of them together, is lodged either about their beginings, only, so
that the Spirits in that place being often explosed, a frequent and very
troublesome Vertigo arises, besides tremblings, and a short faintness about the
Praecordia, swoonings, and often leapings, and light contractions in the
Viscera, or muscles are felt. Or Secondly, the explosive particles being
dilated to the beginings of the nerves, enter more deeply into their processes,
and not seldom being slidden down into the nervous foldings, belonging to the
Praecordia, or the Viscera of the lower belly, or also to the exterior members,
procure there, other as it were nests of Convulsive distempers, that as often
as the Spirits about the nervous origin, are driven into explosions,
presently, fits as it were hysterical, asthmatical, or otherways Convulsive,
arise in the Abdomen, Thorax, or Limbs: Examples of these, and by what means
they are made, shall be anon more clearly delivered: In the mean time, the
spasmodic matter, flowing into the pipes of the Nerves, when it is transferred
even to their processes and remote enfoldings, yet, forasmuch as it has still
its chief mine about the nervous original, therefore after very grievous
Convulsions of the Viscera or members, a great perturbation of the Brain
follows thereupon, with a tingling of the ears, a vertigo, and often an
Insensibility or amassed excurtion of Spirits: but sometimes the morbific
matter, as to the greatest part, being translated to the farthest ends of the
nerves, from thence they become free or clear about their beginings: For I have
observed many, who, whilst at the beginning, they were infested with the
vertigo, often fainting away with fear, headache, and heavynesse about the
hinder part of the head, to have felt about the Praecordia or viscera, only
light inflations, or tremblings; but afterward, suffering more cruel
Convulsions about these parts, they did not complain of the former distempers
of the Head.

By what maens the convulsive matter flows into the Nerves.
If it should be further demanded, concerning the Convulsive matter, from what
place it should be brought, and by what ways carried toward the beginings of
the Nerves, and what kind of Settlement, and as it were cherishing nests it
there obtains; we say, that although we cannot detect the footsteps, and
manifest passages of this matter, yet so much may be collected from certain
observations, and the analogy of things, it may be supposed there are these
two distinct manner of passages, whereby the Convulsive particles, being first
poured out into the Brain and Cerebel, from the blood, are from thence carried
toward the beginings of the Nerves: viz. First sometimes this matter being
imbibed by the Brain and Cerebel, and by degrees passing through, the pores of
either, slides into the Trunk of the oblong marrow, whose tract being also
overcome by it, together with the nervous juice, it slides forward toward the
original of the Nerves, and is heaped up near their heads, or within the
medullarie trunk it self, or within the annularie Prominencies, in which
places, either a long while subsisting, it stirs up frequent Vertigoes, and
more light Convulsions, in remote parts as has been said; or being slidden
from thence, more deeply into the passages of the nerves, excites fits of
Convulsions very Cruel: such a progress of the morbific Cause, we suspect in
whom the Vertigo, swooning, heaviness of the head, and torpor of the mind, go
before the Convulsive assalts: Indeed, the matter of the disease, abounding as
yet in the brain and marrowy Appendix, produces these kinds of previous
distempers; which being slidden from thence, into the Nerves, causes
Convulsions.

2dly, There is yet another way, whereby it plainly appears, that the material
cause of the Convulsive Distemper, is transferred, to the beginnings of the
Nerves; to wit, when the same being deposited by the serous water within the
Cavities, or ventricles of the Head, it is insinuated into the Neighboring
roots of the Nerves: For in Chronical Diseases, when the remarkable discrasie
of the blood and humors, happens also to be accompanied with a praved
disposition of the brain, oftentimes a great plenty of sharp serum, infesting
the Nervous stock, dropping forth from the Vessels of the Choroeidan, or
retiform enfoldings, slides into the ventricles of the brain, and its Appendix:
But this serous water, afterward breaking through the under-spreading of the
Cerebell, into the fourth ventricle, the little skin there being displaced,
whereby the oblong marrow is uncovered, it falls upon the beginnings of one or
more of the Nerves, and either by irritating, or imbuing them, with
Heterogeneous and explosive particles, induces the Convulsive disposition. And
this for the most part is the cause, that sick people, after long and ill
handled Feavours, also after the more grievous Cephalic Diseases, at length dye
of Convulsions; as I have found, by the frequent Anatomy of the Carcases, of
those who dyed by that means. Also it appears by anatomical Observation, that
the brain may be overflowed by a certain serous water, without the distemper of
the Convulsive disposition; and further that in some, who dyed of the
Epilepsie, and other Convulsive diseases, there was no deluge of the serum,
within the ventricles of the brain: By which it is given us to be understood,
that the Convulsive distempers, do not flow only from the waterie matter in the
Head; but that they arise not at all from such a cause, unless the serous
water, overflowing the ventricles of the Brain, and chiefly that underlaying of
the Cerebel, be imbued with heterogeneous and explosive particles. I remember
once, my Council to be asked for a young man laboring with an Egregious
Phtisis, and at that time truly desperate, besides a cough, and shortness of
Breath, he had grievously complained for many days, yea weeks, that he could
not lie upon his back in his Bed, or whilst he sat in a chair, he could not
lean his head backwards: for that by this, or that posture of his Body, he was
wont presently to suffer tremblings of his heart, and a fainting of the
Spirits, as if he were just about to dye: wherefore of necessity he was fain to
hold his head upright, or leaning forward. After he was dead, his carcass being
dissected, his Lungs appeared all over tumified, and in some places Ulcerated:
then his Skull being opened, there flowed within all the Ventricles of the
brain, a great quantity of yellow and salt Serum: which water certainly whilst
it did slide forward upon the fourth Ventricle, about the Trunk of the oblong
marrow, his head leaning back, rushing upon the heads of the wandering, and
intercostal pair of nerves, did stir up the aforesaid Convulsions about the
Praecordia: but so long as his head was inclined forward, that the heap of
serum flowed back into the anterior Ventricles of the Brain, the origin of the
nerves remained free from that Convulsive matter.

Having hitherto shown, how many ways, and by what passages, the morbific
matter, being dilated toward the origin of the Nerves, seems to bring on
Convulsions, it were easy, according to these reasons, to unfold many
Convulsive Symptoms: for besides the Convulsive motions of Infants, and
children, oftentimes excited from the same kind of Causes, hither may be
referred the Contractions, and sudden leapings forth of the nervous parts,
which follow upon feavours. As also those passions commonly called Hysterical,
also hypocondriacal, and certain others, proceed not seldom from the morbific
Cause, rushing upon the beginings of the Nerves. We will therefore endeavor to
establish the truth of this Hypothesis by some other Histories, and examples,
of Sick people; but in the first place, we will propose observations of that
Kind, in whom the morbific matter, settling upon the beginings of the nerves,
and not being as yet slid deeply into their processes, induced frequent
vertigos, and only more light Convulsions, of the Viscera and Praecordia.

A noble woman about 30. years of Age, of a tender Constitution, and lean in
Catarrh or Rhume, flowing upon the wind pipe, and Lungs, with a hoarse Cough,
and great spitting, but the last year, great care and diligence being used,
she avoided that evil. But after the winter Solstice, having taken cold, she
was troubled with an huge pain of the head, a tingling of the ears, a
giddiness, with a great defluxion upon the eyes, that it easily appeared, that
the heap of Serum, which before this time was wont to distill into the Breast,
was now wholly laid up, within the head and Brain: besides, an effect of which
was, that as often as she began to sleep, she was greatly infested with
passions, as it were histerical, to which she had never been before obnoxious:
For when ever being sleepy she closed her eyes, presently a bulk ascending in
her belly, a choking in her throat, tremblings, and leapings about the
Praecordia, were stirred up; which Affections notwithstanding quite ceased,
when she was thoroughly awakened, so that the Sick party was necessitated, to
abstain almost altogether for many days and nights from sleep.

Being sent for to this Lady, after she had bin sick and weak for many days, I
was compelled at length to use gentle medicines: Therefore I took care, that
blood should forthwith be drawn from the foot, to four ounces, and every day a
Clyster of milk and sugar to be administered, by which she was wont to have
three or four stools: besides I gave her every eighth-hour a dose of the
Spirits of Hearts horn in a Spoonful of the following Julap. Take of the water
of penny-royall, of walnuts, and black Cherries each iii. of Histerical water,
ii. of the Syrrop of Clovegilliflowers i ss. of Caster tied in a little knot,
and hanged in the middle of the glass ss. of the powder of Pearls i. mingle it.
I Caused with success, a vesicatoris to be put behind the ears, and a
Cataplasm, of the leaves of Rue and Cuccowpint, with the Roots of Bryony, bay
salt, and black soap, to be laid to the soals of her feet. Sometimes I gave her
in the evening, in a little draught of the prescribed Julap, half an ounce of
Diacodium, to which succeeded a moderate sleep, without the wonted Convulsions
following: which kind of effects, from opiats exhibited in the like case, I
have often experimented: for the quenching her thirst, I gave her a Ptisan,
with diuretic Ingredients boiled in it: by the use of these, she was very much
eased, in a short time. But what proved a great benefit to her was, that an
Imposthume in her ear, breaking of its own accord, powered forth, at first a
yellow matter, and afterward for many days, a great plenty of thin Ichor or
Excrement, by which Evacuation, the Convulsions of the Viscera and Praecordia
wholly ceasing, the disease was perfectly Cured.

As to the Reason of the aforesaid sickness, without doubt it seems, that
those Distempers were excited, by the serous colluvies, laid up within the
Bounds of the Head: for the translation of that humor into the head, brought
at first both the Disease, and the Secretion or flowing of it out, through the
Emunctuaries of the ear, took away all the Symptoms: Besides, when the morbific
matter had brought in to the Spirits, planted about the beginings of the
nerves, a Disposition somewhat explosive, they, though being struck as it were
with madness, they were continually troubled, yet so long as leaping back
toward the Brain, they obtained a space, in which they might be more freely
expanded or stretched forth, they did indeed only more vehemently exercise the
Fantasy, and without farther trouble did only cause watchings. But, when by
sleep sometimes Creeping upon her,, the excursion of the unquiet Spirits were
restrained toward the Brain, (which indeed necessarily happens, when we sleep,
the nervous Liquor within the pores of the brain, at that time being more
plentifully admitted) they tumultuarily rushing upon the heads of the wandering
pair, and intercostall Nerves, troubled the whole series of Spirits, flowing
within the passages of those Nerves, and so caused the aforesaid Convulsions,
about the Praecordia, Viscera, and muscles of the Throat. I have known many
both Men and women sick after this manner, who, when they have been troubled
with an headache, an heaviness of the hinder part of the head, or a Vertigo,
have while they slept, felt forthwith in their Praecordia, or Viscera, or in
both together, perturbations as it were Convulsive; which indeed happens from
the bending downward of the tumultuating Spirits, being reflected from the
brain, upon the beginings of the Nerves: But that the use of opiats, brought a
pleasing sleep to this sick person, without the wonted Convulsions, following,
the reason was, because the animal spirits, as unquiet and furious as they
were, yet by the Intanglement of the narcotick Particles, they were bound as it
were in chains, that afterward, without any resistance they were overcome by
sleep. I have indeed very often happily cured, most grievous fits of
Convulsions, both Asthmatical, and as it were hysterical, by administering
Opiates.

Vertigo, with a trembling of the heart, a fainting away of the Spirits, and a
frequent striving to vomit: being laid in her bed, if she opened her eyes, or
turned her from one side to another, she was presently troubled with a notable
gididness, or swimming in the head, with swooning, and effectless vomiting.
Visiting this woman, I doubted not, but that the cause of her sickness was, the
Convulsive matter, being translated from the exterior region of the head, to
the most inward recesses of the Encephalon, by whose inspiration or
heterogeneous Copula, the animal spirits being, touched while they leaped forth
inordinatly toward the brain, they excited the vertiginous Distemper, and
while they rushed tumultuarily upon the heads of the nerves, the Scotomie,
disorder of the Praecordia, and endeavoring to vomit. A large Vesicatory or
blistering Plaster, being applied to the nape of the neck, and behind her ears,
Clisters daily administered, also the use of Spirits of hartshorn frequently,
and of a Cephalic Julap, cured her within a few days.

it: about the beginning of the spring, he perceived those usual evacuations to
happen more sparingly; in the mean time, he Complained of a fullness of his
hands and feet, and as it were a certain swelling or puffiing up, so that he
feared a dropsy was coming upon him; beside he was troubled in his head with a
giddiness, and frequent Vertigo: A little while after, this evil increasing,
light contractions, and sudden Convulsions, were ordinarily excited, about his
Lips, and other parts of the mouth and face; also presently after (the morbific
matter as it should seem, flowing upon the beginnings of the wandering pair and
intercostal nerves) he was afflicted with the trembling, and leaping of the
heart, with frequent fainting away of the vital spirits, as if a Leipothymy or
swooning was falling upon him.

I know that very many ascribe these Convulsive passions, so grievously
infesting the Praecordia, to the vapors rising from the spleen: but it seems
much more reasonable, to deduce there from the Convulsive matter laid up within
the brain, and rushing upon the beginnings of the Nerves; because a shifting or
translation of some excrements, from some other parts, to the head goes before,
and that it is so laid up, within the compass or bounds of the Encephalon, the
almost continual vertiginous distemper, and the Convulsions of the parts of the
mouth, and face, testify it plainly: wherefore I thought good to prescribe to
this man, Remedies, according to the method hereafter shown.

I might be able here to propose many observations of this nature, in whom the
morbific matter, subsisting near the beginnings of the nerves, stir up light
Spasms or Convulsions, only of the Viscera or members, with a Vertigo. But
because a portion of this matter, descending from the head, enters more deeply
the pipes of the Nerves, and so strows the tinder or enkindling of explosive
seed, as it were gunpowder, about their middle and ultimate processes and
enfoldings, it will be to the purpose, to add some examples of this kind.

A certain young maid E.L. tall and hansome, sprung from sound parents, and
Vertigo: within a little time after, the distemper growing worse, she felt
tremblings in her whole body, with a light shaking of her members, which came
at certain times, though wandering and uncertain: afterward she suffered fits
plainly Convulsive, and those horrid, and often infesting: a little before the
approach of the disease, she was afflicted with a short Scotomie, or swimming
in her head, by and by she felt a streightness, and great oppression of her
Breast, whereby all her Praecordia were drawn together: then presently gnashing
her teeth, and giving a great groan, she was wont to fall to the ground; in the
mean time, she was sensible, but laboring with the great oppression of her
heart, till that constriction of her breast was loosned, she was not able by
any means to rise: afterward, when the fit was past, she was disturbed a good
while, with a great palpitation of the Heart, an heaviness of the senses, and a
great debility of the animal function. After that this Sick maid had lived
subject to these kind of fits, being very often repeated, for about 14.
months, she at last became Epileptical, that as often as the assault of the
evil returned, being flung prostrat on the Earth, she was taken with the
insensibility or amazedness of Spirits, with the foaming at mouth, and other
peculiar symptoms of the falling sickness. Neither did this distemper stay
here, but ere the space of a year was elapsed, it degenerated into madness,
that at last, the sick maid, having lost the use of her Reason, grew sometimes
mad with fury, and sometimes was plainly stupid and foolish.

It is plain, from the beginning, progress, and often metamorphosis of this
Disease, The reason of the aforesaid Case.
that it at first, had its cause, and seat in the head, near the beginning of
the nerves, and from thence, did daily unfold more largely its bounds, both
into the brain, and into the nervous System; for from the beginning, the
morbific matter, consisting near the beginnings of the nerves, Caused only
lighter Spasms or Convulsions, of the Viscera and members, and shakings, with
the Vertigo; afterward, a portion of it being slidden into the pneumonic
nerves, and their foldings, produced most grievous Convulsions of the
Praecordia, Diaphragma, and Ventricle; and also another portion of the same
matter invading the Brain, and its marrow, caused the Insensibility or
amazedness, and so the fits of the Falling Sickness; and at length, the
texture of the spirits being wholly vitiated, and their Latex being degenerated
into a most sharp, and as it were Stygian Liquor, the convulsive distempers
passed into madness.

Therefore, as to the particular reasons, both of the disease, and symptoms, it
seems, that the aforesaid Virgin, by her sedentary Life, (she being deprived
altogether of the exercise of the body, and the use of a more free Air,) but
chiefly by her nightly watchings, and being frequently interrupted of her
sleep, she had contracted a vicious disposition of the blood, and humors, and
also a praved and weak constitution of the brain, and Nervous stock (to which
may be added, that she did perpetually attend on a master, sick of most
grievous distempers of Convulsions, and by that means, had received perchance
some contagion, or convulsive Infection: And first of all indeed, the
Heterogeneous particles being poured forth, together with the nervous juce,
into the brain and Cerebel, and there cleaving to the spirits, as it were
skirmished with the preliminarie scotomie, and vertigenous distemper; then the
convulsive matter, settling upon the beginnings of the wandering pair and
intercostal Nerves, and the spinal marrow, brought in, with the Vertigo, the
leaping of the Viscera and Muscles, and their lighter shakings: Afterward,
when entering more deeply the pipes of the Nerves, it was carried into the
Cervicall, and Cardiac, and perhaps intercostal, and other unfoldings, and
embued the spirits, performing the office of respiration, and the pulse, with
an explosive Copula; they being brought into explosions at every turn, together
with their superiors, inhabiting the nervous origin, by reason of fullness, or
because of irritation, excited most horrid Convulsions of the respective parts:
But the fit growing strong, from the pneumonic or breathing Nerves being
strictly bound, the sudden inordinate systole of the Thorax, was stirred up;
then presently, the Diaphragma being suddenly, and vehemently drawn back, the
obstreperous ejulation did succeed: Further, when by reason of the systole of
the Thorax, being sometime continued, the blood being hindered, that it could
not move, it stagnated altogether in the praecordia, therefore, during the fit,
that great oppression of the heart, with want of speech and motion afflicted
the sick maid: But in the mean time, while as yet the region of the brain
remained free, and clear from the explosions of the spirits, the sick party
remained in her senses, or memory: but afterward when the Convulsive matter
being daily increased, it was unfolded in the middle or marrowy parts, of the
debilitated and broken brain, to the former passions, about the praecordia,
came also the Insensibility and amazedness of spirits, then the Epilepsie, and
lastly madness, for the reasons before recited. Many medicines, and of various
kinds, being prescribed to this sick maid, by many, both Physicians and
Empericks, but confusedly, and with an uncertain method, being presently
changed, did her no good.

Vertigo at every motion, or stirring about of her head; a little after she
constantly expected a convulsive fit, or the insensible amazedness of the
spirits, and sometimes this, sometimes that, was wont to infest her: for that
after the Vertigo, as it were a praevious velitation, for the most part, she
felt in her ventricle, and left side, an heavy or weighty pain running up and
down here and there; hence belching, a striving to vomit, eruptions of blasts,
also wonderful distentions of the abdomen, and hypochondria, did follow, and
sometimes for many hours, did miserably Exercise this woman; but sometimes
these Symptoms happened to be wanting, and then the distemper more cruelly
afflicted her brain: for falling into frequent insensible fits, she was wont to
continue a great while immovable, and with her eyes shut, without sense or
understanding; and when her servants had moved her, by rubbings, and with the
fume of Tobacco, she came by and by to her self, but presently again she fell
into the like insensibility, and so for four or five times, before she could
perfectly recover her self, and be without expecting to fall into these fits
again: At length the Tragedy being acted, she remained however affected with an
heaviness, and torpor of her head, in some measure: but about noon, all the
clouds being discussed, she was wont to obtain a fair, and screne disposition
of her whole head, until the next morning, the same Symptoms would return
again.

Who shall rightly weigh these Symptoms, need not suppose them vapors, arising
from the womb, or spleen, and in those seek for the morbific cause in vain:
which truly may more certainly be placed in the head it self: for it seems,
that by reason of a great sadness (which happens often to women) at the
beginning, a great debility, together with a vicious taint, was impressed on
her brain; so indeed that the animal spirits derived to the brain and Cerebell,
brought with them, heterogeneous particles, of a mixed kind, viz. Partly
narcotick of stupifying, and partly explosive or rushing forth: which kind of
Copula, when they had more plentifully conceived, through sleep, they were
stirred up to the shaking of it of, by mere fullness: as soon therefore, as the
woman was awakened, the same spirits, being moved, either a bending downward
being made below, they were depressed upon the beginnings of the Nerves, and
there being explosed, they excited Convulsions of the viscera; or leaping back
toward the middle of the brain, and being there struck off, they brought in
those frequent and terrible Insensibilities. In truth, this distemper was
somewhat akin to the Epilepsie, but that the morbific matter was not as yet
stayed within the regal palace of the brain, or its middle part, so that there
it might infect the spirits, within their Fountains; but yet, the same
heterogeneous Copula, did cleave more strictly to them, dissociated or
disjoined below, and dividing themselves into various and lesser rivolets,
according to the beginnings of the Nerves. In the mean time, the spirits,
whereby they might shake off that matter, being often explosed, caused the
stupor, and Insensibility, but bending to some other place, they rushed upon
the beginnings of the Nerves, for that reason caused those Spasms or
Convulsions of the viscera: But that the fits come only in the morning, after a
plentiful sleep, the reason was because the heterogeneous Copula of the
spirits, coming to them with the Nervous juce, was at that time gathered
together to a fit fullness for explosions, which being then wholly shaken off,
the sick person remained therefore all the rest of the day, free from the
distemper, till the next day, when the nights sleep had brought to the head, a
new supplement of morbific matter, the like fit returned in the morning; which
perhaps, as the sleep had been shorter or longer, was moved now within the
brain, now near the nervous origin.

But it may be observed, that Convulsions have arisen, from the nervous
origin, An Observaon of a distemper as it wre hysterical in a man.
being chiefly affected, not only in the female sex, as the weaker and more
liable, but sometimes, these kinds of distempers have been excited in men, from
the like procatartic cause. Some years since, being hastily sent for from a
stranger, who lodged in this City, at first sight, I suspected that he was
possessed, and believed that he had more need of Exorcisms, than of Medicines.
He was about Forty years old, who had now for about three years, at certain set
times of the year, been wont to be troubled with convulsive Motions; whilst he
by chance lodged here, for a few days about his occasions, by reason of a great
sadness, he had a fit of his sickness greater than usual: He was wont for two
or three days beforehand, to feel the coming of his disease; to wit, from a
great commotion within the forepart of the head, almost a continual Vertigo,
and frequent dimness of his eyes: But the fit coming on him, at first his eyes
were variously roled about, and inverted, then a certain bulk, like a living
animal, was seen to creep from the bottom of his belly upwards, toward his
heart and breast, and from thence to his head: I my self pressing his belly,
with my hand, felt very plainly this kind of motion, and as long as I hindered
this round thing from ascending, with both my hands, and all my strength, he
found himself indifferently well; but as soon as this swelling creeping upwards
by degrees, had reached the head, presently the members of the whole body were
cruelly pulled together, that he would dash himself against the walls, or
posts, as if possessed by an evil spirit; He could hardly be held, and
restrained, by four strong men, with all their force, but that he would leap
from them, and fling out his arms, feet, and head, here and there, with diverse
manners of motions: when he ceased from leaping forth, or struggling, his
members would be strongly extended, and his muscles stiff, as if troubled with
the Cramp, or stiff extension: such a fit would last about a quarter of an
hour, then coming to himself, he would talk soberly, and walk about in his
Chamber; he knew what he had suffered, and asked pardon of the standers by,
presently after, he began to draw his eyes inward, and swiftly to role them
about: then presently the convulsive distemper returning, acted the like
Tragedy as before: and after this manner, he would have five or six of these
kind of convulsive fits, within three hours space. In the midst of one of
these fits, a vein in his Arm being opened, and a large orifice made, the blood
flowed out slowly, and was seen presently to be congealed: and so indeed, that
being received into the dish, it did not flow about, after the manner of
Liquors, with a plain and equal superficies, but like melted fewet, dropped into
a cold vessel, one drop being heaped upon another, it grew to a heap.

The reason of the aforesaid Case,
If this strange distemper had happened to a woman, it would presently have been
said, that it was the mother, or histerical, and the Cause of it would have
been laid on the fault of the womb; especially, for that the ascent of
something, like a bulk, began the fit, from the bottom of the belly: But when
this common solution, which most often is the mere subterfuge of Ignorance,
cannot be admitted in this case, it seems most congruous to reason, to referr
all these Symptoms, to the evil affections of the brain, and nervous stock.
For truly it may be plainly gathered, that the cause of the disease, did lie
hid in the head it self, by the Symptoms preceding the fit, which did denote a
very great agitation of the spirits, within the head; that inflation of the
brain, and heavy swimmings, which constantly came just as the fit was coming
upon him, the turnings of the eyes, manifestly argue, that heterogeneous and
explosive particles, did adhere to the spirits, dwelling within the Encephalon,
near to the beginnings of the Nerves. So that this case, comes near to the
nature of the Epilepsie, excepting, that the spirits within the middle of the
brain, did not admit an heterogeneous Copula, nor being explosed in another
place, did they tumultuously break forth there; for during the fit, the sick
person was still in his senses, or had the use of his memory: But the morbific
matter, being more plentifully laid up in the head, when from thence it was
slid, more deeply into the pipes, both of the Interior und Exterior Nerves, it
had placed mines of explosive seeds, very diffusive, in the viscera, both of
the lower and middle belly, and also in the exterior members; so that, when the
animal spirits began to be exploded, near the beginnings of the nerves,
presently from thence, others inhabiting the mesenteric enfoldings, and then
others in the other nervous enfoldings, interjected from the outmost bound,
even to the head, being explosed in order, did even continue the Convulsions,
from one part to another, until they came to the head it self: but presently
the explosion being translated from thence, to the spirits dwelling in the
spinal marrow, and Appending Nerves, the most strong Convulsions of the
muscles, and members of the whole body followed: But that, that ascent, as it
were of a bulk, or substance which very often was perceived in the lower belly,
about the beginning of the Convulsions, proceeding from the spirits, within the
mesenterick enfoldings, being brought into explosions, shall be more largely
declared anon, when we come to treat of hysteric passions.

In the mean time if it be asked, for what reason, that, the convulsive
paroxysm, beginning in the part of the head, near the beginnings of the Nerves,
presently the spirits dwelling in the outmost parts (as many as are
pre-disposed for that Symptom) enter into explosions, and so transfer the
convulsive Distemper, being there fully raised, upwards, (for it is for the
most part so, whether the entrance of the disease begins in the bottom of the
belly, or about the middle of the abdomen, the Hypochondria or praecordia, for
that the Convulsion is wont to creep by degrees, Wherefore the Convulsions
begin from the extremities of the Nerves.
from those places toward the head.) I say, for the solution of this, these
two considerations are offered, to wit, in the first place we consider, that
when some whole series of spirits is disturbed, those who reside in the
extremest bounds are first destituted of their original Influence; wherefore,
they, before others, grow tumultuous, and begin to grow irregular; hence it is,
when the Nerve of the arm or thigh, is strained hard, by leaning on it, that
the wonted Influence is hindered, that a numness, with a sense of pricking or
tingling, is first felt in the fingers or toes; from whence by degrees, it
creeps upwards toward the places affected. Secondly, the other is, and rather
the reason of this distemper, to wit, that the spirits being ready for
explosions, when they are contained within the nervous pipes, one or more, as
so many distinct little Tubes, they require a sufficient ample space, in which
they may be able very much, and indeed successively to be rarefied, and
expanded; which thing because it cannot be easily performed, within the Trunks
of the Nerves, from the beginning toward the end, therefore while the Spirits,
about the nervous origin, being first struck off, leap back toward the
Encephaleon, for that cause they stir up the Vertigo: the more open explosion
of the spirits, for the most part, begins about the inferior passages of the
nerves, or at their extremities, where the Trunk of the nerve is either
dilated, into more ample foldings, or terminated in more fibers largely
dispersed abroad; then those Spirits being explosed, there is room made
presently for others succeeding in order, whereby in like manner they may be
exploded: Hence we may observe, whilst the exterior Spirits are exploded, if a
Ligature or hard Compression being made, the succession of others into the same
space, or their progress toward the exterior parts be intercepted, the
Convulsion is wont to be hindered, that it cannot ascend upwards: wherefore when
a numbness (as medical Histories testify) being arisen from the farthest end
of the finger, or toe, creeps to the superior parts, with a tingling, or like a
cold air, and at length reaching the brain, causes most horrid Convulsions; if
by and by after the motion is begun, the Arm or thigh be strongly tied, the
Spasm or Convulsion not being able to get over the bound place, is hindered from
coming to the head; yea, it is usual for histerical women, as soon as the
swelling of the belly, or the ascent of the bulk in the abdomen is first
perceived, to gird strongly their waists, with Swathing-bands, and so
oftentimes they prevent, the Praecordia, and the region of the brain, from
being disturbed, by that same Convulsive Fit.

But that the Blood, being let out in the midest of the fit, was so soon
congealed, indeed it very ordinarily happens to be so, in Convulsive and
Apoplectical Distempers, as the most learned Heighmore has first noted, out of
Hendochius: Wherefore the blood is soon congealed in convulsive distempers.
But that some from hence contend, that Convulsions rely altogether upon the
thickness of the Blood, and stagnation, its motion being hindered, cannot be
granted: Because, the blood taken from those who are subject to convulsions, a
little before the fit, is dilated with serum, and fluid enough: wherefore, we
may lawfully think, that, that Congelation is caused by the paroxysm it self,
because in Convulsive motions, and immoderate Contractions of the Nerves, and
Viscera, the interflowing Blood, by the exhalations of its spirit, and serum,
is somewhat loosened in its mixtion, and therefore in some sort coagulated;
like as when milk, by reason of too much agitation, and separation of the parts
one from another, grows into butter; wherefore this kind of Coagulation of the
Blood, seems rather to be the effect, than the Cause of the Convulsions.

The Curatorie Method.
AS to the Cure of these kind of Convulsive Distempers, which in women, or
men, proceed from the morbific cause lying upon the beginnings of the Nerves.
The first Indication will be, to draw away the tinder or inkindling of the
disease, viz. to hinder, that the blood may not affix on the head, the
heterogeneous particles, either begot in it self, or received elsewhere from
the Viscera. For this purpose, an evacuation, both by catharticks, and
blood-letting, unless something contradict, is wont to be benificially
prescribed.

Vomiting most often brings help, wherefore Emeticks of the Infusion of Crocus
metallorum, or of the Salt of Vitriol, or wine of Squills, Emeticks.
is to be taken at the beginning. Then almost the next day, the taking away of
Blood, either by phlebotomy in the Arm, or by Leeches in the Sedal veins, is to
be performed; then afterward, a gentle purge of pills, or solutive Apozems, is
to be ordained, and timely repeated.

Take of the pills of the Amber of Crato, or of the Tartar of Bontius ii.

are to be administered, which indeed ought to be prescribed and chosen,
according to the Constitution, and habit of the Body, and temperament of the
sick; for too lean bodies, and such as being endued with a more hot blood,
medicines less hot, and which do not trouble the blood above measure, ought to
be given: On the Contrary, for phlegmatic and fat people, whose urine is thin,
and watery, and whose Blood is Circulated more heavily, and Viscera's stuffed,
more hot Remedies, and notably apt to ferment the humors, are designed. In the
former Case, let it be prescribed, after this manner.

In the mean time, while these Medicines are taken Inwardly, it is sometimes
convenient to raise blisters, with Vesicatories, in the nape of the neck and
behind the ears; for so the serous and sharp humors, are very much brought
away from the head: besides, sneezing powders, and such as purge Rhume from the
head, often give signal help. The taking away of Blood from the Sedal veins, or
the foot, ought sometimes to be itterated; yea, and the Distemper urging,
Plasters or Cataplasms, are profitably applied to the soles of the feet. It is
also beneficial to apply drawing medicines, about the calves and thighs.

CHAPTER VI. Of Convulsive Motions, whose cause subsists about the extremities
of the Nerves, or within the nervous foldings.
SOmetimes Convulsive distempers do arise, without any fault in the Head, by
the irritation and explosion of the spirits, remaining about the extremities of
the nerves, which plainly appears, because, when medicines haul sharply the
Ventricles or Intestines, or worms gnaw them, there do not only follow
Convulsions in those parts, but besides, convulsive motions do sometimes
torment (or are retorted on) the members, and outward Limbs: for indeed, as we
have shown elsewhere, when the sense of a very grievous Trouble torments any
part, and from that is communicated to the chief Sensorie, presently from
thence, an involuntary, and irregular motion, is wont to be reflected on the
spirits in that place irritated; and that not only by the same nerves, to which
the sense of the pain was carried, but sometimes also the Convulsion is
reciprocated, by others, either neighboring, or altogether extraneous: So the
Stone being fixed in the Ureters, and irritating very much its nervous fibers,
excites Convulsive motions, not only in the distemperd Vessel, but almost in
all the Viscera of the Abdomen; So that, the urine being suppressed, Torments
diffused here and there, and very often horrid Vomitings follow. Wherefore,
it is not at all to be doubted, but that both diseases, and some Convulsive
Symptoms, are very often induced, by reason of an outward hurt, brought to the
Tops of the Nerves, terminating within the membranes, muscles, or Viscera: yea,
in the hysterical, hypochondriacal, and certain other passions, if at any time
Convulsive motions are excited, in the hurt head, by the fault of the womb,
spleen, or other Inward; verily they arise by this only means, to wit, by the
Trouble of the rest of the parts, being translated this way through the Nerves,
(but in no wise, by the Vapors) to the brain, and are propagated, all about,
into various Regions of the Body.

Convulsions begin from the ends of the Nerves, both by reason of irritation
But it should here be noted, that although the evident Solitary cause,
forasmuch as it is strong and vehement, may sometimes induce Convulsions of it
self, and without a praevious disposition: because indeed the Animal Spirits
being irritated, beyond measure, begin greater and more than ordinary
explosions, as in overgreat purging, and Vomiting, and the fits of the Colic,
and Stone, is ordinarily wont to happen; yet in many other Convulsive
Distempers, whose fits are often and habitual, besides the irritation made,
about the extremities of the nerves, which serves for the most part for the
evident cause, also a certain more remote cause is present, to whose efficacy
the assault of the disease is chiefly beholden; to wit, when Convulsive motions
are wont to be excited, and at every turn repeated, by the fault of the Spleen,
womb, or other private part, it may be suspected, that the animal Spirits, of
the Fibers in the distemperd part, and those disposed in its neighboring
parts, had first contracted an heterogeneous, explosive Copula, And by reason
of an Explosive Copula.
by which being filled, to a running over, they were provoked, by a light
occasion, to Convulsive explosions: Then, those being first begun, about the
extremities of the nerves, creep upwards by the passage of the same nerves, and
are often carried to the same nervous origin, and sometimes beyond, to the
middle of the brain: from whence, lastly, being reflected, on the nervous
stock, they also secondarily, cause the Convulsions of the members, and Limbs:
But after the Brain, and a Superior portion of the nervous System, are wont to
suffer, and be affected often, by the Convulsions below excited, the spirits
inhabiting those parts, also begin to be themselves adulterated at length, and
to admit an heterogeneous and explosive Copula, and so to acquire, in part, a
procatartick cause; hence at length, a Convulsive procatarxis or more remote
cause, becomes Common to either end of the Trunk of the same nerves, and the
animal spirits of one nerve, or more, being evilly disposed, both at the head
and tail, conceive explosions from either part, and deliver them presently to
the other, as shall be more largely declared below, when we treat particularly
of hysterical, and other passions. in the meantime, we will add some histories,
and observations, of Convulsions, arising from the farther ends, or extremities
of the Nerves.

glandula's of her Breast, being then made more tumid, to be either touched or
handled, yea nor any noise, or shaking to be made in the Chamber.

When to this Tumor, about to degenerate into a Cancer, they had applied
fomentations, and Cataplasms of hemlock, and mandraks, and other stupifying and
repercussing things, this gentlewoman began to suffer certain Convulsive
affections, infesting her very often: At first, as often as the pain in her
breast did most cruelly torment her, she felt in that place, prickings, also
convulsions, and contractions, running about here and there: then presently her
Ventricle, and hypochondria, and often the whole Abdomen, were wont to be
inflated, and very much distended, with an endeavor of belching, and Vomiting;
by and by, the same distemper, being leasurely translated to the superior
parts, excited Insensibility; to which shortly after, Convulsive motions
succeeded,, in the whole Body, so strongly, that the Sick party could scarce be
held, by three or four strong men.

These kind of fits, at first were wandering, and only occasionally excited: to
wit, they would come, as often as the pain of her breast was strained, by some
evident cause: Afterward, these Convulsions did more often infest her, and at
last, they became habitual, and periodical, twice in a day, to wit, they were
wont to come again constantly, at so many set hours after eating: And when
after this manner, the sick Gentlewoman, had been miserably afflicted, for six
months, at length, she began to be molested with a vertiginous Distemper of her
head, exercising her almost continually: for which evil, when a fomentation of
aromatic and cephalic herbs, had been a good while administered to her head,
she became better, as to the giddiness; but then she was perpetually infested,
with a quite new, and admirable Symptom, viz. an empty cough, without spitting,
night and day, unless when she was overwhelmed with sleep: After this worthy
Virgin, had tried without much benifit, diverse medicines and remedies,
prescribed by several Physicians, she was at last helped, by making use of the
most temperate Bath, at the Bath; then being presently married, after she had
conceived, and was brought to bed, she by degrees grew well.

If the reasons of the whole disease and its Accidents, be inquired into, The
reason of this.
without doubt, the convulsive distemper, was first of all excited from the
tumor, or pained place of the breast; the cause of which was, partly the most
sharp sense of pain, being impressed from its fibers and nervous parts, but
partly by the heterogeneous Copula, being affixed on the spirits inhabiting
those fibers and nerves; for truly, it may be suspected, that the most sharp
humor impacted in the Tumor, which perhaps had in some sort flowed thither, by
the passages of the Nerves, being repercussed, by the use of Topics, had
entered the fibers and nervous filaments, or little strings disposed through the
whole border or neighborhood, and so the heterogeneous, and explosive Copula,
had clove to the spirits; for the shaking off of which, as often as by pain
they were excited, they entered into convulsive explosions, and together with
them, other spirits flowing within the neighboring Nerves, by consent of the
forms (as it often happens) were exploded after the same manner: Then the
convulsive distemper, when it first had begun in the extremities of the Nerves,
being continued through their passages, even to the head, was wont to cause the
insensibleness, and from thence, leaping back upon the whole nervous system,
the convulsive motions, of the Limbs and all the members: The fits, about the
beginning of the sickness, being excited after this manner, by reason of pain,
from the distempered part, were carried secondarily to the brain, and its
appendix: But afterward, when the spirits inhabiting those places, being often
explosed, by sympathy, had so loosned, and weakened the pores of the containing
parts, that there lay open a passage, within the same, for all heterogenious
particles to enter, with the nervous juce, the convulsive procatarxis or more
remote cause, also increased in the head; and the spirits inhabiting the
Encephalon, being infected with an heterogenious Copula, they themselves begun
the convulsive fit, or at least afforded the first instinct to its assalt,
which did return, for the most part, at such set hours after eating, because
the morbific matter, was carried in, together with the nervous juce, almost in
an equal dimension: In truth, in such cases, where the convulsion being
general, does possess almost all the parts of the whole nervous system
successively, we may suspect, that the animal spirits, had contracted an
heterogenious and explosive Copula, in the whole nervous stock, which, when it
is arisen, at the set time, to a fullness, incites the spirits themselves, at
the appointed time, in like manner to explosions, and the same explosion, being
begun somewhere, is propagated in order, to all, after the manner of a fiery
enkindling.

As to that empty cough, which succeeding the fomentation of the head,
exercised this sick person almost incessantly for many months; it seems, that
this Symptom should depend altogether from the nervous origin being
distempered, and not at all on the stuffing of the Lungs, for she did not avoid
any thing with the cough; and if at any time that force of coughing was
violently restrained, presently she was troubled with the sense of choking in
her Throat: So that, as it is very likely, the morbific matter laid up near the
nervous origin being rarefied and stirred, by the fomentation, entered more
deeply the heads of the nerves, appointed for the Lungs, and stirred up in
their fibers, and filaments, perpetual convulsions: after the like manner, as
when the nervous juce, which waters the fibers, and tendons of the Muscles,
being made sharp, and degenerate, induces to those parts, continual leapings
and contractions: hence, when a Convulsion or spasm was stopped, in some
branches of the distempered Nerves, so as she could not cough, presently the
Convulsive motion, running into other branches, of the same neighbor Nerve,
stirred up that choking in the Throat. I will here propose another example of
a Convulsion, arising from the extremities of the Nerves being affected.

deliquium of spirits, as if she had been just dying, exercising this sick
Lady: All which symptoms, she plainly perceived to arise, from that Tumor in
her ventricle: They saw that all vomitory, cathartical, antiscorbuticall, and
hysterical Medicines, did her no good, but were rather hurtful, and
troublesome; she received some benefit, by the taking away of blood by Leeches,
and by the use of Asses milk, and afterward she was much eased, by the long
drinking of spaw-waters.

The reason of it.
The aforesaid Symptoms, which commonly are ascribed to the hysterical passion,
and the vapors from the womb here plainly appear, to have proceeded from a
Tumor, arising about the bottom of the ventricle: for that the blood of this
Lady, being very hot, and melanchollick, when it could be no more purged, by
her courses, flowing from her, it laid up its recrements, and adust
faeculencies, at first in her breast, and then from a new beginning, in the
membranes of her stomach: From the tumor there made, sharp and heterogenious
particles falling down perpetually, entered the fibers and nerves, planted round
about; which cleaving continually to the spirits, dwelling in, and flowing into
those parts, excited them to frequent explosions, and so made Convulsive
distempers, in all the neighboring parts: But that sometimes the convulsive
motions were more light in that place, hence it appears, that the whole nervous
stock, and the head it self (as is wont to be in greater convulsions) had not
as yet been touched, with the same distemper: But the disorder of spirits,
arising about the parts affected, and from thence transferred, by a smaller
undulation or waving to the head, and so only lightly disturbing the spirits,
inhabiting it, induced watchings, with a great heat, and perturbation of the
fantasy, what we have hitherto discoursed of Convulsions, from the morbific
cause settling upon either end of the nervous system, will more clearly appear,
when we shall hereafter trear particularly of the chief kinds of convulsions,
viz. the hysterical, hypochondriacall, and other passions: In the mean time,
there will be no need to add a Curatory method, for this Hypothesis of
convulsions, arising by reason of the extremities of the nerves being affected,
because the ways of curing may be better accomodated, to the passions of this
kind, hereafter particularly to be spoken of: But for the present, it behooves
us, to proceed to the unfolding of the convulsive passions, whose cause, or
morbifick matter, seems to subsist, within the nervous foldings.

We have largely enough, in another place, discoursed of the nervous foldings,
and in their description, and use, we have shown, that it is very likely, the
more grievous fits of convulsive motions, beginning oftentimes within these
parts, are from thence propagated on every side, into the neighboring parts,
and not seldom to a great distance: at least, that it seems much more probable,
that the heterogenious and explosive particles, after they have overcome the
tract of the head, and its medullary appendix, and being more deeply slidden
into the Channels of the Nerves, and their passages, together with the juce
watering them, do spread their stores within the nervous foldings, as it were
in Cross-streets, and by paths, and there sometimes make their stations, until
at length, being more plentifully heaped up, they as it were with Collected
forces, produce the more cruel convulsive distempers: This I say, appears to be
much more probable, That the nervous foldings is the seat of Convulsive matter.
then (what is commonly said) to suppose them vapors, arising from the womb,
spleen, ventricle, or any other inward, in which all the fault is easily
thrown: For within these foldings, there are spaces large enough, for morbific
mines, that the matter may be there at leisure laid up, and remain, till it be
gathered to a fullness: But then, because we believe, that great plenty of
spirits lodge there, more than in any other little cells, the heterogenious
Copula growing to them, lays as it were tinder for more grievous explosions, so
that, the spirits being explosed within these bodies, do not only inflate, and
dilate them, but elevate and lift them up, from their Place (even as a house
blown up with gunpowder;) wherefore the parts lying over them, are suddenly
lifted up into a tumor, and loose are drawn violently hither and thither. That
after this manner, the more cruel fits of Convulsions, about the praecordia,
and Viscera, are very often stirred up, I have found to be true, besides the
Arguments taken from reason, not long since by my own sight: For when I opened
the dead body of a Gentlewoman who had been exceedingly troubled with (as they
say) the Mother fits, or hysterical Distempers, I found the womb wholly
faultless, but the Nerves near the foldings of the Mesentery, (as it seemed)
only to be lifted up, and elevated into a bulk, and the membranes of that
inward, appeared torn, and loosned one from another, as being on every side
tumid, and loose, as it were blown up into little bubbles, or bladders.

Indeed there are more considerations of solid reasons, whereby we are induced
Mesenterick enfoldings, and by turns explosed: which shall be more clearly
manifested, where we treat especially of those diseases: But, neither is it
less probable, that the Collick-pains, do very often proceed, from a more sharp
and irritative matter, contained in the same enfoldings. Besides, as often as
the convulsive fits seem to begin from the spleen, or ventricle, by reason the
beginnings of which are inflations, and very great disturbances of those parts,
it is likely, that the nest of the convulsive matter, was hid within the
nervous enfoldings, belonging to the spleen or ventricle: Also, this kind of
matter, seems to excite within the Cardiac foldings, most heavy tremblings, and
passions of the heart; and within the pneumonic, or cervical, (or those
belonging to the Lungs and throat) enfoldings, most terrible fits of the
Asthma. In our Treatise of the Nerves, we have related a notable case, of a
worthy Gentlewoman, to whom a serous matter, wonted to distill from the
forepart of her head, through her left nostrill, fell down behind her ear:
where, when the most cruel pain did infest her, Convulsions also, and admirable
contractions followed: whereby the joynting or compaction, now of the brain,
and the whole head, seemed to be pulled downward, now the throat, praecordia,
and Viscera upwards: which kind of Convulsions, vexing the parts so opposite,
and at such distance, by turns, when they did proceed from one and the same
seat, of the disease, planted in the midst, it will be obvious to conceive,
that the grieved place, as the origin of either convulsive affection, was the
ganglioform enfoldings, planted near the Parotidae, or the two chief Arteries
of the throat: into which, the Nerves both of the wandering pair descending from
the head are entered, and out of which the shoots do stretch themselves, into
the muscles of the throat and branches, into the praecordia, and viscera.
Further, front the same cause, to wit, the convulsive matter, heaped up; and by
turns explosed, within the ganglioform enfoldings, we think, (and not
undeservedly) that sense of choking in the Throat, so often excited in the
convulsive fits, did proceed. But there will be a more fit place, to speak of
this, when we shall particularly handle, the convulsive diseases, and symptoms.
We shall now endeavor, to search into what remains, of the last kind of
Convulsions, of which we made mention above, to wit, which relies on the
nervous Liquor being infected, through its whole mass, with heterogenous and
explosive particles, and for that reason, irritateing the whole processes of
the Nerves, and the nervous bodies, into universal Spasms, or Convulsions; and
those either continual, or intermitting.

CHAPTER VII. Of Convulsive Motions, arising from the Liquor watering the
nervous Bodies, and irritating their whole processes into Convulsions.
THat Convulsive distempers do sometimes wander through the whole nervous stock,
and infest now these parts, now those, now many together, is so noted, and
obvious almost to daily experience, that nothing can be more: we may therefore
take notice, in these, that the tendons of the Muscles, do every where leap up,
and are drawn together with spasms; in others, some exterior members, are
bended, or stretched forth, with various flections, and contortions, here and
there, after diverse manners, we have seen some, forced by the unbridled, and
untamed force of the spirits, as if struck with madness, to run, or leap about,
or strongly to smite, with their feet, or fists, the earth, or any objects:
which if they should not do, forthwith they would fall into swooning fits, and
horrid Ecclips of spirits. It would be too tedious, to enumerate all the cases
of universal Convulsions, wandering through the whole nervous stock: But the
symptoms of this kind, Chiefly three kinds of causes of universal Convulsions.
tho they are various, and manifold, may be reduced nevertheless to three chief
Heads; to wit, forasmuch as they depend chiefly upon three kinds of causes;
for indeed, in these wandering Convulsions, we ought to suppose, the whole
nervous Liquor to the vitiated, and the animal spirits, flowing every where in
the same, to be adulterated, and for that reason, to be almost perpetually
exploded: Take notice then, that this kind of Infection, is most commonly
impressed on the nervous juce, and the spirits every where flowing in it, by
one of these three ways, viz. 1st. By Poisons or witchcraft. 2dly, From
malignant, or ill-cured feavours, in which the morbific matter is poured forth,
on the Brain, or nervous stock. Or 3ly, when the nervous Liquor, by a long
tract of time, by reason of the scorbutic, or otherwise vicious distemper, does
degenerate from its due constitution, into sour, or acid, or any otherwise
praeternatural, and Convulsive Liquor: we will here consider of each of the
aforesaid cases, and first of all, of the fits of Convulsion, which are
produced by poisons, or Sorceries.

From poisons and sorceries.
First therefore, it is somewhere shown by us, that some poisons, do act rather
on the nervous Liquor, than on the blood, which depraving it, most strongly
induce Convulsive distempers: And it appears clearly, from the eating of
Hemlock, From poisons of the rank of vegitables.
the laughing-Parsly, man-drakes, the furious nightshade, wild Parsnips, and
other hurtful herbs, how soon after, horrid Contractions of the Ventricle,
numbness, delirium, Convulsions, twitches of the tendons, in the whole body,
were wont to follow: From a mad Dog.
Besides, those kind of Convulsions follow upon the biting of a mad Dog, and
other venomous beasts, where the Virulent infection, being received by the
nervous juice, and lurking a long while in it, at last puts it self forth, and
infects, and poisons, the whole mass of Liquor, in which it was involved, with
its ferment. But what does yet more illustrate it, are the admirable Symptoms,
the truly painful Convulsions, and unweariable dancing, which Authors have
related to follow, upon the biting of the Tarantula: and indeed, might seem
fabulous, unless that the truth of the Thing were asserted, by many men of good
Credit, both ancient and modern: For besides Mathiolus, and Epiphanius,
Ferdinand, Gassendus, and Kircher, add, that themselves were eyewitnesses, of
this distemper: yea it is said, it is a known thing in Apulia, and found almost
by daily experience, that in that part of the Country, there are Phalangii, or
a certain kind of Spider, which is called Tarantula, from Tarenta, an ancient
City of Apulia. This little Animal, being very frequent in the Summer, often
bites the heedless Countryman, and infects him with its Venomous stroke, from
whence presently succeed, a pain in the hurt part, with a Tumor, and itching,
by and by, in various parts of the body, a numbness, and Trembling, also
Convulsions, and loosnings of the members, and other Convulsive Symptoms, with
a great loss of strength; as may be collected from Mathiolus, Ferdinand, and
others, relating the wonderful effects of this Disease. But truly, what these
Authors say concerning the cure of this Distemper, and is practiced commonly
through the whole Country, is worthy of great admiration: for those stung with a
Tarantula, as very sick as they are, as soon as they hear musical Instruments,
presently they are eased of their pains, and leaping into the middle of the
room, they begin to dance, and jump about, and so continue it, a long while, as
if they were well, and ailed nothing: but if it happen, that the Fiddlers leave
off never so little a while, they straitways fall to the ground, and return to
their former pains, unless by the incessant music they dance, and leap, till
the poison be wholly shaken off: For this end therefore, Musitioners are hired,
and are changed by turns, that without intermission of the noise, those who are
bitten, may dance so long, till they are quite cured. Thus says Mathiolus: to
which Ferdinand adds, that poor people do expend almost all their substance, in
these fiddlers, and musicians, who wander up and down all that Province; and by
playing to these Tarantulasized people, make much benifit: they dance or leap
about, in the villages, and public streets, and fields, some one day, some one
week, and others more. To these Authors, the most learned men Gassendus, and
Kircherus agree, both of which, have related it from their own observation,
that they have known such affected; and they assert, that they are not
affected, or excited, indifferently with any music, but with certain kinds of
Tune, and that they dance to some measures, before others.

Let us inquire a little further, into the Reasons of these aforesaid
Accidents, The reason of the symptoms of those bitten by a Tarantula.
if we may follow our conjecture, in this first place, it is without doubt, that
a certain venomous infection is fixed on the humane body, from the bite of this
little creature, which tho it being less infestous to the blood, and vital
spirit, as soon as ever it passes from it, into the nervous Liquor, it
presently unfolds it self, through its whole mass, like leaven, and infects the
animal spirits, flowing every where in it; so that indeed, they being drawn one
from another, and here and there inordinately moved, induce convulsive
distempers, which are accompanied now with the contractures, now with the
languishing, and resolutions or loosning of the containing parts.

But why the painful Convulsions, which are raised by the bite of the
Tarantula, In what the reason of the Musicks allaying the symptoms consists.
being presently allayed by music, are wont to turn into dancing, does not so
plainly appear. That some affirm, this little animal (for that by the testimony
of Aristotle it should be most wise) to be delighted with music, and for that
reason, its venom being impressed on man, by fermenting the humors, to induce
the like love of music: I say, this conjecture will not satisfy a mind
desirous of Truth, because, that supposes a musick-loving nature in the spider,
and the same to be communicated to man, by a matastasis, or as it were a
certain metempsychosis, or transmigration of soul, both which are taken upon
trust, and little satisfactory, but it may be rather said, that the venom
inflicted on the nervous liquor, by the bite of the Tarantula, is too gentle,
to be able to extinguish wholly the Animal spirits, or to dissipate them very
much asunder, and to compel them into more cruel explosions, but only to put
them to flight, and to incite those flying here and there, into lighter, and
somewhat painful Convulsions; and that the Music, with its flattering
sweetness, does congregate together, and mutually associate, with ease, the
spirits so dissipated: wherefore, when as the same spirits, by reason of the
Infection sticking to them, are apt to involuntary and Convulsive motions, the
melody disposes them, delighted together, and directs them to such Convulsions,
that entering the bodies of the nerves, by a certain Course, and Order, they are
carried as it were in certain prescribed limits and compasses, until at length
the particles of the venom, being quite evaporated, and the fury and rage of
the spirits being worn out, they wholly shake off that madness. For truly,
music does easily carry men sound and sober, whether they will or no, or
thinking of another thing, into actions answerable to the sound of the harmony;
that presently the standers by, at the first striking up of the Fiddle, begin
to move their hands and feet, and can scarce, nay are not able, to contain
themselves from dancing: Let none therefore wonder that in men bitten by the
Tarantula, when the animal spirits being moved, as it were with goads, they are
compelled to leap forth, and wander about hither and thither willingly, if they
are excited to dancing, and composed measures, at the stroke of an harp; so
that as in these distempers, the spirit of the music, as it were enchanting
the outrageous spirits, and in some measure governing, and changing their
convulsive motions, serves instead of an Antidote: for that the animal spirits,
being very much, and for a long while exercised, after this manner, wholly
shake off the Elastic Copula, contracted by the poison, or otherwise; and they
being very much wearied, at length rest from that madness, or its incitation.

A description of the dance of St. Vitus.
That which is called the Dance of Saint Vitus, is an evil akin to this,
concerning which George Horstius relates, that he had spoken with some women,
who for some years, visiting the shrine of St. Vitus, which is in the borders
of Vlme, did there exercise themselves, even night and day, with dancing and
discomposure of mind, till they fell down like people intranc'd: by which
means, they seemed to be restored to themselves, that they felt little or
nothing for a whole year, till about the time of May following, when by the
inquietude of their members, they fay'd, they were so far tormented, that they
were forced to go for their health sake, yearly, to the aforesaid place, about
the feast of St. Vitus. Horst. Epis. Med. sect. 7. de admirandis Convulsionibus.

The reason of it.
Indeed it is a usual thing (as I have observed) both for men, and women, to be
sometimes tormented with this inquietude of their members, and as it were with
a fury or madness, that they have been forced to walk, till they were tired, as
also to dance, leap, and run about, here and there, that by this means they
might shun the grievous trouble, and sometimes faintings away, which were about
to invade them: The reason of which seems to be, that the animal spirits,
forasmuch as they being incited, by an heterogenious Copula, in the whole
nervous kind, become fierce, and altogether unbridled, which so to exercise,
and tire out, there is need, both that they themselves may be tamed, and that
the explosive Copula, may be shaken off.

Universal Convulsions from Witchcraft.
That Convulsive distempers are sometimes excited by witchcraft, is both
commonly believed, and usually affirmed, by many Authors worthy of credit: and
indeed, as we do grant, that very oftentimes, most admirable passions, are
produced in the humane body, by the delusions of the Devil, forasmuch as he,
to cause wonders, by which he might rule, by the subtletie of working,
insinuates to the sensitive soul, or the constitution of the animal spirits,
heterogeneous Atoms, or little Bodies, and so adds now spurs or pricking
forward, and now casts chains on its functions, and now carries them to
mischief: also by some means he enters himself into the humane body, and as it
were another more mighty soul, is stretched through it, actuates all the parts,
and members, inspires them with an unwonted force, and governs them at his
pleasure, and incites to the perpetrating of most cruel, Which are commonly but
falsely so thought.
and supernatural wickednesses: yet all kind of Convulsions, which besides the
common manner of this disease, appear prodigious, ought not presently to be
attributed to the enchantments of Witches, nor is the Devil presently or
allways to be brought upon the stage. For indeed, as often as a child, or
relation, of some man of the richer sort, is by chance taken with most cruel,
and unusual Convulsions, for the most part, it falls out, that by and by the
next old woman is accused of witchcraft, she is made guilty, and very hardly,
or not at all, the wretch escapes the flames, or an halter; when in the mean
time, the disease, proceeding from causes merely natural, may be easily Cured,
by no other Exorcism, The reason of them.
than Remedies usually prescribed against convulsive diseases: In truth, the
animal spirits being endued, with a more cruel explosive Copula, and being
stricken by it all of a heap together, obtain so much strength, and vigor,
beyond their proper and wonted power, as the flame of gunpowder, has above the
burning of the common flame; so that those, who obnoxious to this disease, out
of the sit, may be governed, lifted up, and moved at pleasure, with the light
help of one man; when the same is upon them, make nothing of the utmost
endeavors, and force, of at least four of the strongest men: But if in the
case of any one that is sick, there arise a suspicion of witchcraft, or
fascination, Which argue witchcraft.
there are chiefly two kinds of Motions, that are wont to create, and cherish
this opinion, viz. 1. If the patient does perform the contortions, or
gesticulations of his members, or of his whole body, after that manner, which
no sound man, nor mimick, or any tumbler can imitate. Then 2dly, If such
strength be shown, that surpasses all humane force; to which, if the avoiding
of monstrous things happen, as when bundles, as Henry van Heers relates, are
cast forth by vomit, or a live Eel, as Cornelius Gamma tells, voided by stool,
without doubt, it may be believed that the devil has, and does perform, his
parts in this Tragedy.

It were easy to heap together, very many, and indeed admirable histories, of
persons of every Age and Sex, affected after a stupendous and as it were
supernatural manner, with the manifest suspicion of witchcraft: for such are
every where extant, among Authors, both Physicians, and Philosophers: and
because vulgar rumor, noyses about diseases, caused by witchcraft, to happen
often in almost every Country: but because these kind of cases, are full of
Imposture, or allways increased, by the fictious lies of the relators, to
create admiration, (and for that they rarely fall under the medicall cure) I
will here purposely omit them: what remains is, that I proceed to unfold, the
next kind of universal Convulsions, to wit, which comes upon malignant, or
otherwise irrigular, or ill-cured Feavours.

CHAPTER VIII. Of Universal Convulsions, which are wont to be excited, in
Malignant, ill-cured, and some irregular Feavours.
THat Convulsions sometimes happen to persons sick of Feavours, Universal
Convulsions happening in Feavours.
almost every ordinary body understands, and from thence takes a remarkable
Prognostication, of Death, or peril: For in malignant Feavours, also sometimes
in the ordinary ill-handled, as the Virtego, or Delirium arise, from the
morbific matter being laid up in the Brain, from the Blood; so from the same,
being slidden down into the nervous stock, Contractures and twitches of the
muscles, and tendons; also sudden shakings of the members, and Limbs; and
sometimes most horrid stiffnesses, in the whole Body succeed: The reason of
which kind of Symptoms seems to consist in this, that the Liquor watering the
nervous parts, The reason of the symptoms.
abounds every where with heterogeneous particles irritating the Spirits: for
by that means, the Spirits inhabiting, and influencing, being disturbed in
their just Influence, and emanation, are incited into continual explosions, as
it were a crackling noise, not much unlike, as when the flame of a Lamp, being
imbued with drossy and salted oil, ascends with a noise and sparkling: which
kind of Convulsive distempers, for the most part, happen about the height of
feavours, when the morbific matter, being first laid up in the blood, is from
thence transferred to the Brain, and that being passed through, and also
infected, it is carried into the System of the nerves, and from thence stirs up
Convulsive passions, with, or without a Delirium.

But indeed, it is sometimes observed, that, besides these kind of Convulsive
distempers, coming upon Feavours, and secondarily excited; in a malignant
constitution of the air, also from the breath of a Pestilent Contagion, the
nervous Liquor has been infected before the blood, or else apart from it, and
therefore a Delirium, or Convulsions, have gone before a feavourish Distemper.
Further, I have often observed, that some irregular Feavours have arose, in
which the blood has been hardly seen to boil up, or grow hot above measure, but
the beginnings of this slow and very dangerous feavour, were laid chiefly in
the nervous humor; which being by degrees brought to maturity, did induce
Convulsive Distempers, with a Delirium, or madness, and other wastings or
exorbitances of the Animal Spirits. For the sick never complained of heat, or
thirst, being soon made feeble, and as it were strengthless, they were
presently obnoxions to frequent giddiness, also to rremblings of the Limbs, and
as it were leapings forth, besides, to twitches or jumpings of the muscles, and
tendons, and to contractures, and pains wandering about, here and there. This
kind of sickness, by some Physicians, because it seemed to consist in the
solid parts, rather than in the blood, is called a malignant hectic feavour;
when indeed, the same being fixed chiefly in the nervous humor, may be better
called, the Convulsive nervous Pestilence.

A description of a convulsive disease of Hassia, sometimes epidemicall.
There is mention made, by Gregory Horstius, of a Convulsive, and malignant
Disease, which was sometime past Epidemical, in Hassia, Westphalia, and the
neighboring Countries: they being taken therewith, without a feavourish heat,
immoderate effervescency of blood, whilst they were employed about their
familiar occasions, hardly perceiving themselves to be sick, were wont to have
about their hands, or feet, and sometimes in both, a sense of tingling, with a
numbness, running up and down: then by and by, their fingers, together with
their Arms, and thighs, were now strictly drawn together, now most strongly
stretched forth, as if they were frozen. Those kind of Contractions, and
extentions, rendered themselves by turns, and then changed places, that now the
distemper resided in one part, then presently in another: But (as it often
happened) if the Disease, at once invaded the whole Brain, Universal Convulsions,
and oftentimes epileptical Fits, infested the sick: besides, those laboring
with it, were obnoxious at some turns; to a Delirium, madness, and sometimes a
Lethargy: This sickness, continued a long time, without any Crisis, or sound
solution, and could scarcely be so perfectly Cured, but that the Disposition of
the Brain, and nervous parts, remained evil all their Life after.

The reason of the symptoms.
As to the Reasons of this Disease, and Symptoms, it is obvious enough, that the
same depends altogether upon the vice, and notable depravation, of the nervous
juce. That pricking, or tingling, for the most part, at the first coming of the
disease, was procured for this Reason, because that Liquor, beginning to be
poisoned, and loosned in its mixtion, by the malignant Infection, presently it
oppressed the animal Spirits, abounding therein, and inhibited them from their
wonted, a^ free expansion; wherefore, they being half overwhelmed, and
constrained to creep, as it were among briars, or things that caught hold of
them, or held them back, they excited the sense, as it were of tinglings
running about: but then, because this disease growing worse, the nervous Liquor
was yet more perverted in its Crisis, or disposition; the heterogeneous
particles, which were brought together in it, cleaving to the Spirits, caused
them to be moved hither and thither, and to be unduly exploded; for which
Reason, the Contractions and horrid distentions in the members, and the
tumults, and great inordinations in the head, were raised up. But that in this
feavour of the nerves a solution or difficult Crisis, or none at all happened,
the reason was, because the nervous juice being slow, and as it were
mucilaginous, and therefore heavy in its motion, was not defaecated, or
cleared, as the blood, by a critical effervescency, nor easily conceived, that
kind of fermentation, by which the pure, might be separated from the impure.

Indeed I have known a sickness, much like to this example, to be often excited
in our Country, and to invade whole families, especially children, and the
younger people. Some years since, a populary or childish feavour, very much
infesting the Brain, and nervous stock, exceedingly spread in this country, yea
almost through all England: The History of which Disease, being described in
that time, in which it raged, viz. in the year 1661. I think it worth our pains
to insert, in this place of our Convulsive Pathology: For from hence, it may
appear, by what means, and from what causes, the Convulsive Symptoms, which
come upon any feavours, are wont to be excited.

A Description of an Epidemical Feavour chiefly infestous to the Brain and
nervous stock spreading in the year, 1661.
IN this Country, before the last Summer, viz. 1661. The hystory of an
Epidemical feavour raging in the year 1661.
we had been free for above two years, from any popular disease, unless such
only as usually come in some places; but then, before the Summer Solstice, the
Smallpox (a distemper here rarely Epidemical) being rise in many places, raged
very much: After that Summer, which was extremely hot and dry, an Autumn
moister then usual followed: and after which, a most mild winter almost without
any cold: in all which space, the Earth was hardly covered with snow, or was
ever hard frozen, Its procatartick or more remote cause.
above three or four days; so that within a few weeks, after the winter
Solstice, the Trees began to bud, and the vernal plants to break forth, from
the bosom of the Earth, and to flower, and also the birds to build nests: to
this mild season, not eventilated at the beginning of the spring, by the
nitrous little bodies, that were wont to be blown from the North, a filthyness
of showrs, and almost continual wet succeeded. After the vernal aequinox, a
certain irregular, and unaccustomed Feavour, seized upon some, here and there,
which within a month, became so Epidemical, that in many places, it began to be
called the New Disease; Raging chiefly among children, and youths; it was wont
to afflict them, with a long, and as it were a Chronical Sickness: yea
sometimes, old men, and men of middle Age, though rarely, were seized by it,
and those indeed, it did sooner, and more certainly kill. The symptoms.
The Distemper at first invading any one, did creep on them so silently, that
the beginnings of the sickness, were scarce perceived: for arising without
immoderate heat, or more sharp thirst, it induced in the whole body a great
debillity, with a languishing of the Spirits, and a torpitude or numbness of
the function; The Stomach was ready to loath any victuals, and to be grieved at
any thing put into it, and yet not easy to vomit. The sick were unfit for any
motion, and only loved to be idle, or to ly down upon the Bed: within a short
time, also sometime at the first coming of the Disease, they complained of a
heavy vertigo, a tingling of the ears, and often of a great tumult and
perturbation of the brain. Which kind of Symptoms, were very often esteemed,
as it were the peculiar sign, of the approach of this Disease, if in some,
those had been wanting, or happened to be more remiss, instead of the head being
affected after that manner, the disease took more deep root in the Breast, with
an excited cough, as shall be told by and by. But whilst the brain, and the
nervous Appendix, being after this manner affected, the animal Spirits,
presently from the beginning of the sickness, were benumbed, a slow and as it
were hectic feavour, was inkindled throughout: but yet, the effervescency of
the blood, which was hardly continual, but flitting, and uncertain, was
according to the disposition of the blood it self, in some more intense, in
others more remiss; and therefore, thirst, the white scurf of the Tongue, and
other Symptoms, which accompany a feavourish distemper, did more or less infest
them: sweating did not willingly follow, nor could it easily, or by a light
thing, be caused by Art: yea, neither this, nor any other evacuation, as it
were critical, at any time succeeding, did suddenly help this disease; but it
persisting for many weeks, and sometimes months, reduced the sick to the
highest Atrophie, or wasting of all parts, and often infected them, with an
incurable Consumption.

About the increase of the disease, which happened in most, within eight days, if
the Distemper (as it was often wont) did settle chiefly in the head, and
nervous System, most grievous Symtoms, in their Dominions, viz. a plain
Frenzy or deep stupidity or Insensibility did molest them. For I often
observed, in many children, and not seldom in women, after seven or eight days
from their falling sick, that their knowledge and Speech failed them, and so
the sick have lain, for a long while, yea, sometimes for the space of a whole
month, without any taking notice of the bystanders, and with an involuntary
flux of their excrements; but if they continued in some sort the use of
Judgment, and Reason, they labored with a frequent delirium, and constantly
with absurd, and incongruous Chymera's, in their sleep. But in Men, and others
of a hotter temperament, from the morbific matter, instead of a Crisis being
translated to the brain, a Fury, or dangerous, and oftentimes deadly frenzy
did succeed. But if neither Stupidity, nor great Distraction did fall upon
them, swimmings in the head, Convulsive motions, with Convulsions of the
members, leapings up of the tendons, did grievously infest them. In almost all
the sick, the belly was for the most part loose, casting forth plentifully now
yellow, now thin, and serous excrement, with a great stink: it was rarely that
vomiting fell upon any one: The urine in the whole process of the Disease,
(unless when the morbifick matter, being carried more plentifully into the
Brain, did threaten a frenzy) was highly red, so that some, by reason of the
deep color of the water, judged this feavour to have been plainly Scorbutic:
which notwithstanding appeared to be otherwise, because antiscorbutic Remedies,
(of which indeed many, and almost of every kind were tried) were little or
nothing beneficial. It was most of all to be admired, how soon after the
beginning of this Disease, the flesh of the sick consumed, and they reduced to
the leanness of a Sceleton, when in the mean time, there was no great heat,
that might by degrees consume the solid parts, nor any violent evacuation,
which might greatly take them down.

Besides these evils molesting the region of the head, a distemper no less
dangerous, oftentimes fell upon the breast. For in some, tho not in all, a
cough very troublesome, with abundance of spitle, and thick, was excited: this
happened in some, about the declination of the disease, to wit, whilst the
confines of the brain were serene, as it were the clouds sent from thence to
the thorax, a great Catarrh suddenly rained down upon the Lungs. But in others,
who especially had little infection of the disease in the head, presently after
the beginning of the feavour, a cruel cough, and a stinking spitting, with a
consumptive disposition, grew upon them, and suddenly, and unthought of,
precipitated the sick into a Pthisis: from which nevertheless, they recovered,
by the timely use of Remedies, often beyond hope. It was observed in some, that
after a long ecclips of the sensitive faculty, and oppression of the brain,
from the morbific matter, at length tumors did follow, in the glandula's, near
the hinder part of the neck, out of which, being hardly ripened and broke, a
thin and stinking ichor or matter, ran for a long time, and brought help. I
have also seen watery pustles, excited in other parts of the body, which passed
into hollow ulcers, and hardly curable: sometimes little spots, and
petechiales, appeared here and there: yet I never heard, that any more broad,
or blew, of these kind, were seen in the sick. Notwithstanding, tho this
feavour was not remarkable for very many malignant spots, yet it was not free
from Contagion. For that in the same Family, it invaded almost all the
Children, and youths successively, yea not rarely those of more ripe years, and
at men's estate, who looking to the sick, were familiarly conversant in their
Chambers, or about their beds, were infected with the same infection: But
indeed, there was not so much cause of suspicion, that for it, the friends of
the sick should be wholly interdicted, from commerce with, or visiting of them.

Although the course of this disease, (unless when it intimately settled in the
brain) did appear so gentle, and continued without any horrid Symptom; yet its
cure being always difficult, succeeded not under a long time: For the sick
rarely grew well, within three or four weeks, yea for the most part, scarce in
so many months. If this disease fell upon men of a broken Age, or strength,
especially those who were before obnoxious to cephalic distempers, as the
Lethargy, Appoplexie, or Convulsion, it oftentimes killed them in a short
space: but if there was any hope of recovering, it could be but slowly
procured, (all Remedies whatsoever scarce bringing any sensible help) so that
the sick, did no sooner come out of the sphere of this disease, than they fell
into the confines of a Consumption.

The reason of them.
If the formal reason, and courses of this aforesaid sickness be demanded, it
here easily appears, the watering Liquor of the brain, and nervous stock, for
the most part both together, with the blood, to be in fault, and the immediate
cause, especially of the troublesome Symptoms: to wit, forasmuch as this water,
presently after the first assault of the disease, was grown more poor then
usual, and as it were lifeless; therefore a Languishing, and enervation, with
a spontaneous weariness, and impotency to motion, happened in the whole body, and
with a sudden wasting of the body, in the sick. Further, forasmuch as the same
Liquor, was stuffed with heterogeneous particles; viz. partly narcotick, partly
explosive, therefore, a numbness, a sense of pricking, leapings up of the
tendons and muscles, and contractures, also the Virtego, giddiness, and other
more grievous Cephalic distempers did arise: Moreover, forasmuch as by reason
of the evil of the nervous juice, being not quickly or hardly to be mended, the
cure or healing of the disease, became so hard, and lingering. But for that the
fault of this Latex, necessarily depended on the discrasie or evil disposition
of the blood, also of the depraved constitution of the brain, what their morbid
dispositions were, and by what means they brought forth the beginning, or
tinder of the Symptom of the feavour but now described, let us now see.

As to the former, it seems, that at this season, by reason of the hot and
humi'd constitution of the year, and no blast from the north (the little bodies
of which imbue the blood, and juices of our body, as it were with a nitrous
seasoning, and by agitating them, defend them against putrefaction) the blood
in most men, and chiefly in children, youths, and women, became like
standing-water, that so contracts a settling, very impure, stuff't with
heterogeneous particles, and turning to a clammyness, and watrishness; in
which, the more pure spirit and sulphur, being somewhat depressed, the watery
particles, being carried forth with the impure salt and sulphur, were too much
exalted. Wherefore the blood, both by reason of its Crisis or constitution,
being vitiated, also by reason of heterogeneous particles, being heaped up more
plentifully in its bosom, was made more fit, either of its own accord, or
occasionally, or because of the contagion, to receive a feavourish
Effervescency, so that from thence, very many fell at this time into feavours.
But the blood growing hot, from the feavourish taint being received, did not
presently burn with an open flame, but like green wood laid on the fire, with a
flame as it were suppressed, and much encumbered with smoke. Wherefore, the
morbific matter, being heaped within its mass, was not wont, (as in a regular
feavour) to be consumed by the burning, and its relics, at the set time, to
be exterminated by the Crisis: but yet, a little after the beginning of the
feavour, a great portion of this matter being powered into the head, at Thorax,
or into both at once, and afterward being continually supplied in those parts,
it induced either the aforesaid distempers of the brain, and nervous stock, or
a cough, with a consumptive disposition, or both together, and for this reason,
about the beginning of this disease, when a pulse quicker than it ought to be,
and a high colored urine, and full of contents, did show the blood to grow hot
with a feavourish distemper, the sick did not complain of heat, or thirst;
because the blood growing hot, did lay up its impurities, and recrements,
forthwith into the provision of the nervous Liquor, or into the Lungs;
wherefore, within these receptacles, the Symptoms presently became worse; but
afterward the disease growing on, a somewhat sharp heat, with scurfness of the
tongue, was wont to be troublesome to some: yea, in all, a slow, and as it were
hectic feavour, continued throughout; which neither by sweat, nor by
insensible transpiration, could be so wholly removed, but that it was daily
renewed, chiefly after eating, tho never so small: which thing truly seemed to
happen, because the nervous juice being full of the feculencies, brought from
the blood, did not afterward receive them in so great plenty, but that these
recrements, together with the nutritious humor, (and for that this was not
consumed by nourishing the solid particles) remaining within the bloody mass,
caused it then to grow feavourishly hot.

2ly, Besides this morbid disposition of the blood, contracted from the
intemperance of the year, it seems, that the brain also, from the same
occasion, was made prone to the aforesaid passions. For when, for a long tract
of time, the southern winds did continually blow, with a moist constitution of
the Air; from thence, the passages, and pores of the brain, being very much
loosned, and opened, and its connection too much dissolved, they gave an easy
passage, to serous humors, and for all sorts of heterogeneous particles:
wherefore the blood being very feculent, and watery, as soon as it began to
grow hot from the feavour, carried its serous recrements and filths, presently
through the too open doors into the head: for whosoever he was, who did not
complain of his head, being too much stuffed with a moist air, and numbness of
spirits; on the contrary, his pores being bound together, by an intense cold,
or dryer air, all his senses, and faculties, remained more quick and lively.

These things being thus premised, concerning the morbid provision of the
brain, and humors, to wit, of the blood, and nervous humor, by reason of the
constitution of the year, whereby indeed, very many at that time, sell into a
slow, unequal, and long continuing feavour, surrounded with Cephalic and
Convulsive symptoms, and hardly curable: hence also it will be easy, to unfold
the reasons, of the rest of the symptoms and accidents, chiefly to be noted in
this disease.

Why this disease chiefly invaded children, women, and phlegmatic men.
For first of all, that this irregular Feavour, raged chiefly among Children,
young men, women, and phlegmatic men, the reason was, because in those kind
of bodies, the blood was apt to be more waterish, and less perspicable, and
from thence to gather a serous Colluvies, or watery humor, and heterogeneous
feculencies; and also, the brain being more humid and weak, easily received any
recrements of the blood. Wherefore it may be observed, that those sort of
persons, were found more prone to Convulsions, arising by reason of any other
occasions.

The reason of the Atrophie coming upon this feavour.
Secondly, the noted Atrophie or leanness, came so suddenly upon this feavour,
because, by reason of the depravation of the nervous juice, the officies of
nourishment, depending upon it (which, as we have elsewhere shown, are highly
active) presently failed. For although we do not grant, the nervous humor to
be only nutritious, but to dispense through the Arteries, a matter destinated to
the nourishable parts, prepared in the bloody mass; yet it may be lawful to
think, that the Liquor watering the brain and nervous stock, by means of an
efficient cause, does conduce very much to alimentation; for this growing
turgid with animal spirit, actuates and invigorates the nutritious juice,
brought to every part by the blood, and admitting it into the passages, and
most intimate receptacles of the body to be nourished, and as it were leading
it in, assimilates or resembles it, Wherefore, when this household Liquor is so
depraved, that it does not rightly supply the animal spirits, requisite about
the work of nutrition, all the members and parts of the stomach vitiated in its
tone, either spues back whatsoever nourishment is brought, or cannot receive it
to its proper use: wherefore truly in this disease, the bulk or habit of the
body, however fuller or fatter, was more sooner pulled down, then in a
continual Feavour, where it might much more evaporate, by the intense heat, or
copious sweats. The reason of which is, because in a burning feavour, although the
blood growing very hot, exhales more plentifully; yet in the mean time, it
continually affords something of nourishment, which the several parts, helped
by the benefit of the nervous juice, easily received, and assimilated; but in
this nervous pestilence, although the nutritive matter was sufficiently provided,
yet by the defect of the Nourishment of the spirits, the nourishment was
altogether inhibited.

Why this feavour was hardly cureable.
3. For the aforesaid reasons also, this feavour, being a long while protracted,
was wont scarce ever to be critically helped, and difficulty cured, by the help
of almost any medicines: For the feavourish matter, creeping presently, from
the beginning of the disease, into the nervous Liquor, could hardly afterward,
and not but of a long time, be exterminated from its bosom: for that this
water, with a slow motion, and flowing leasurely in the straight vessels, does
not as the blood, conceive of its own accord a purifying effervescency, or
fermentation; neither can the forces of medicines, reach to it so easily, and
unmixed: but either they are first hindered by other parts, or because they are
heterogeneous, they are wholly excluded from the brain, casting back whatever
is incongruous. In truth for this reason, all distempers of the brain and
nerves, as it were making a mock at Medicines, are most difficulty cured.
Therefore in this feavour, if the evil impressed on the brain and nervous
stock was taken away, either a cruel cough with plentiful spitting, ot
tumors, or an Impostum in the neck did follow: to wit, the morbifick matter
being supped back, by the blood, and again deposited, settled either in the
Thorax, or in the Glandula's, and emunctories, nigh the hinder part of the
neck. But this disease, was the more contumacious, because the discrasie or
evil constitution of the blood, was not easily mended: for although from the
beginning, its Latex, the recrements being poured forth, even into the nervous
Liquor, grew but little and sluggishly hot; yet afterward, these receptacles
being filled, and the morbific feculencies, and besides the nutritious matter,
not employed in nourishing the parts, being resident even in the blood, did
aggravate it, and for the exclusion of this trouble, not to be mixed with it,
did induce an Effervescency, such as is wont to be in an hectic feavour,
either almost continual, or presently apt to come again. For I have often
observed in this feavour, from grewell, barly-broth, and other slender diet; no
less ebulition of the blood to be stirred up, than from broth made of flesh:
whether indeed the nourishing juice, supplying the blood from the chyle,
because it was not employed in the work of nutrition, carried something
heterogeneous, and not rightly miscible, as a trouble to the blood; and by
reason of the particles of this superfluous juice, being copiously sent away
with the serum, the urine became very thick, red, and very full of contents:
Also, for the same reason, the belly was for the most part loose, forasmuch as
the blood, filled full of the nutritious juice, did suck forth a lesser portion
of the chile from the bowels, and did pour back again part of that which had
been brought to it, on the intestines; the feavourish distemper did likewise
stick so long in the blood, because, till the animal regiment being restored,
nutrition was rightly performed, that superfluous matter was carried into the
mass of blood.

We deliver the example, and the Aetiology or rational account of this
aforesaid feavour, more largely for this reason, because the same disease, did
fall upon our Country men, here and there also at other times: for that of
late, in this City, all the younger people of a certain family, were sick of
it: yea, I remember, that some time past, very many labored with such a
feavour; Out of the many histories and examples of sick people, which it
rendered when it was epidemical, I will here propose one or two.

A strong and lively young man, about the beginning of the spring, 1661,
falling Cathartick Remedies, Antipyretics or allaying of heat, digestives, and
also antiscorbuticks, and others of various kinds, administered by the
prescriptions of the most famous Physicians, availed nothing: But
notwithstanding the sick man, hitherto languishing with a slow and wandering
feavour, with a quick and feeble pulse, a deep-colour'd urine, had kept his bed
a fortnight; besides, being reduced to the greatest leanness, he complained of
a giddiness, and as it were the fluctuation of a sound in his head, and a
tingling noise in his ears. Although he was troubled with a great stupor, yet his
sleeps were mightily troubled, and broken with delirious fables. After four
days, when the feavour was not yet declined, it was thought good to take away
four or five ounces of blood, by Leeches, from the sedal veins; from hence the
feavour began to be much exasperated, for a great intense heat, with thirst,
watchings, and almost continual tossing of the body, also the tongue dry, and
scurfy, appeared; then quickly a troublesome cough, with abundance of
discolored spittle followed, to him were administered, almond, and
barly-drinks, with temperate bechicks (or things to stop coughing) boiled in
them; water of milk distilled with snails, and pectoral herbs, the
shelly-powders, prepared nitre, and often Cordial opiats; which notwithstanding
scarce giving any help, the sick man still became more weak: when in this
manner being sick above two months space, the feavourish distemperature, and
cough also, daily growing worse, he seemed near death, at length a voluntary
sweating arising, so that every night, or every other night, he sweat
abundantly, and from thence finding himself better, using then the aforesaid
Remedies, he grew well within six weeks.

Till I had seen many sick people after the same manner, I suspected this
disease to be altogether an hectic feavour, with a consumptive disposition of
the Lungs; but when I saw many others at that time fall sick ordinarily, after
the like manner, I easily instituted the Aetiologie or national account of this
feavour, such as I have already described: to wit, that the blood, because of
the intemperature of the year, and perhaps from errors in diet, The reason of
it.
had contracted a vicious procatarxis or remote cause: Then it growing
feavourishly hot, and presently carrying its impurities to the brain, and so
depraving the juice, watering it, and the nervous stock, induced the
vertiginous distempers, with a stupor, a languishing of spirits, and an atrophy
of the whole body: but so long as the blood did transfer its recrements, from
its own bosom, into the brain and nervous appendix, the feavourish heat
continued more gentle and mild: But afterward, when the tending downwards of
the morbific matter, by the opening of the hemorhoid veins, was drawn away from
the brain, the same being first retained within the bloody mass, increased the
feavour; then being poured on the Lungs, excited the cruel cough; with
plentiful spittle: but forasmuch as the flesh of the Lungs remained free from
putrefaction, as soon as the serous water was sent away by a more plentiful
sweating, the sick man became free, both from the feavour, and phthisis or
Consumption, that seemed so deplorable.

vertigo, with a noise in his ears, and deafness, and also with a violent
cough, with yellow, and as it were consumptive spittle: his pulse was quick and
feeble, his urine red and thick, his appetite much dejected, his spirits so
languid, and his strength so cast down, that he could not keep out of his bed:
I gave this youth to drink often in a day, water distilled from milk, with
snails and temperate herbs: besides I ordered him an open decoction, such as is
in use for the Rickets, to be daily taken instead of his ordinary drink: by the
help of which Remedies, he was restored to his health, in a months space. At
this time I was sent for to many other people, of every age and sex,
distempered by the same disease, now clearly Epidemical; for it, running through
whole families not only in this City, and the neighboring parts, but in the
Countries at a great distance, as I heard from Physicians dwelling in other
places, increased very much. Those for the most part laboring with this
feavour, so be they were otherwise whole, grew well, by the fit use, and order,
of medicine and diet: but it happened very often but ill to those, who were
endued with a weakly constitution of brain, and nervous stock, or broken with
age; but not seldom the case of the sick became dangerous because the
Physicians were not wont to be sent for presently after the beginning of the
disease, yea, scarcely before it had more deeply spread abroad its roots, and
the opportunity of healing was past.

Crocus metallorum, and on the seventh day a Cordial powder being administered,
she incited the sick youth covered with blankets to sweat: his skin hardly
began to be moist: but presently he began to talk idly, complained that his Cap
was fallen into the water, by and by becoming speechless, within four hours,
whilst I was sent for, he expired before I came.

Diaphragma being carried upward, and with a renewed Sistole, held so a long
time, she made a great noise as if about to be suffocated: then this little
maid growing more apparently feavourish, complained of thirst and heat, and lay
all night without sleep, with a mighty agitation of her body, and began to talk
idly, after the same manner as her brother, of her coat being fallen into the
water; and when all things grew worse, she began to be tormented with
Convulsive motions, first in her Limbs, by and by in her face, and then in her
whole body: the Paroxysms coming by often turns, twice or thrice in an hour,
did most grievously trouble her, so that this little wretch, within the space
of 24. hours, after the Convulsive Distempers began to grow more grievous, her
animal spirits being almost quite spent, she dyed; whilst the Convulsive Fits
tormented her, her pulse was very much disordered, and often intermitting, also
a frequent vomiting molested her. Being sent for to visit this maid, also too
late, a little before her death; when I could contribute nothing to the
proroguing of Life, I endeavored what I could, to find out from her Death, the
knowledge of the aforesaid disease, therefore having got leave to dissect her
body, the reasons, and marks of the Symptoms chiefly urging, in this feavour,
more clearly appeared.

Opening therefore first the lower belly, The kn^wledg of the disease found ^ut
by dissecting the Carcass.
I found all the bowels in it sound enough, and well furnished: The ventricle,
although tired with empty vomiting, contained nothing besides the Liquor, lately
taken in at the mouth: for neither in it, nor in its Appendix, were worms, or
sharp humors found, which are wont oftentimes to give a cause to these kind
of Convulsions: the small guts, were in many places mutually involved: to wit,
the Unequal superficies of one part, was thrust into the concave of another, as
into a sheath, and hid far in it, which indeed I judge to have happened, wholly
from the convulsive Motions of those bowels: for whilst by reason of the
vehement Convulsion, excited from the nervous origin, the opposite fibers
being drawn together, did work the same Intestine, into contrary motions, it
easily happened that a part of the Intestine of the Ilion being carried upward;
might run into the hollowness of the other, being snatched downward.

The Thorax being opened, the flesh of the Lungs appeared very red, and as it
were sprinkled with bood, yea in some places as it were livid, and almost
black: out of the same wherever it was cut, there flowed forrh a thin and
frothy matter. Certainly this shew^d, that the feavourish matter, or the serous
impurities of the boiling blood, being soon impacted in the Lungs, did so stuff
up their pores and passages, that the blood it self, being in its wonted and
free Circulation, there stagnating, and being extravasated, did excite a
certain inflammation.

We found a no less clear track, of this so deadly disease in the head: for the
shell of the skull being removed, presently the vessels, creeping through the
meningae, were seen to swell very much with blood, as if almost the whole mass
of blood, were gathered together in the head: for the veins being cut or
broken, about the Inwards of the lower and middle belly, little blood flowed
forth: Besides, those membranes where they cloth the Cerebel, and being higher
spread divide it from the brain, being sprinkled in very many places with
extravasated blood, were noted to be of a black-purple color; that it was not
to be doubted, but the Phlegosis or Inflammation round about excited, was the
cause of the so cruelly infesting Convulsions. These coverings being taken
away, the substance of the brain was seen to be altogether moist, and watered
above measure with a watery humor: yea, its rine or bark being taken off, all
the ventricles were full of a limpid or clear water, of which kind of very
clear Liquor, there was judged to be more then half a pint.

From these appearances, the Pathologie of the aforesaid feavour is easily
Collected: to wit, in this sickness, as also in many others, The Pathologie of
the aforesaid Feavour.
the blood feavourishly growing hot, presently deposes its recrements, both
into the Lungs, and into the brain; wherefore a serous Colluvies, or watery
heap, did presently overflow the constitution of either; then, because the
blood being hindered, both here and there, from its due circulation, it began to
grow into a very great heap, about the confines of the affected parts, and at
length to stagnate, and to cause as it were a phlegosis or Inflammation: hence*
by reason of the serum being plentifully heaped up in the lungs, and baked by
the heat, the troublesome cough, with the thick and discolored spittle, for
the most part came in this disease; and by reason of the like affection,
excited within the head, the vertigo, swimming, stupifaction, and other
Cephalic passions, constantly seized on the sick: which kind of Distempers, in
this little maid, and in her brother, by reason of the infirm constitution of
the brain, before in either of them, being made more grievous, terminated in an
Apoplexy. I might easily here propose many other histories, of persons sick of
this feavour at that time, but from these but now recited, the Type of the
aforesaid disease, may be sufficiently known: But because the same feavour
happens almost every year, on some prae-disposed; and perhaps, by reason of an
evil constitution of the year, may hereafter at some time become Epidemical,
it will be worth the while, to represent some Method about its Cure.

Concerning which, first of all take notice, that in this feavour, The Curatory
Method.
no Critical days were to be observed, as in the vulgar continual feavours: for
the blood as soon as it began to grow hot, poured out a part of the morbific
matter, as yet crude, and not overcome, from its embrace to the head or breast:
wherefore it were vain to expect that the blood should suffer the heterogeneous
particles to be heaped together, in its mass to a fullness; that from thence a
flowring or putting forth arising, at the set intervalls of times, it might
thrust the same subtilities out of doors: yea rather this growing hot glows not
with a great, and open burning: but like a fire covered over with chips, sends
forth a moist smoke or breath, rather then a flame: But so, that from thence,
by reason of the nervous juice being depraved soon in its disposition, and not
rarely, because of the lungs being stuffed with the consumptive matter, the
convulsive, or phthisical or consumptive symptoms, did molest chiefly, in the
whole course of the disease.

Blood to be taken away at the beginning of the disease.
It behooves us to design the curative Intentions, according to the various
times of the disease, and the diversities of the symptoms chiefly urging. About
the beginning of this feavour, the taking away of blood, seemed convenient
almost to all: This kind of remedy, I often experienced with success, in
little Children: For that by the means, as it were another breathing place is
opened, to the mass of blood, silently and covertly growing hot, and obtruding
its soot or smoke, on the more noble parts; and for that reason, its impure
efflorescencies or puttings forth, are drawn away from the brain, and lungs.
Therefore, although this feavour of an ill Condition, may be accounted as it
were malignant, yet forasmuch as the blood is not presently apt to be
coagulated, but to be too much poured forth, and to bestow its serosities on
the nobler parts, to wit, the brain and lungs; therefore Phlebotomy, so it be
administered in the beginning of the disease, is convenient almost to all.

For the same reason, Cathartick Medicines, and chiefly vomitory, are
administered at the very beginning of the disease; for these do not only
evacuate the viscera of concoction, and so draw away the chief fomenting of the
disease, and as it were its original, but besides, they draw forth the
serosities from the blood, and so effect its cleansing, rather in the stomach
and Intestines, then in the head and lungs. Further by Emeticks, for that the
receiving Glandulaes of the Lympheducts, are pulled with a great shaking, the
superfluities of the nervous juice, least they should evilly affect the brain,
and its dependencies, are expressed forth into the lower bowels: also for this
end, the belly is to be kept continually loose, by the use of Clysters. But in
the mean time, whilst the blood being infected with the taint of this disease,
threatens the brain or praecordia, with the evil, it will not be safe to
attempt any thing with Diaphoreticks, or sweating medicines, or Diuretics or
such as evacuate by urine, or also with Catharticks* vomiting and purging
medicines: For these kind of medicines, forasmuch as they greatly pour out the
blood, and compel its serosities into more open issuings forth, all the
recrements, being apt to fall away from the mass of the blood, are easily
obtruded on the brain, or Lungs, when they are of a more feeble constitution:
So in the youth abovementioned, a loss of speech, came upon the raising of an
untimely sweat: Also I have known, that Sudorificks, no other then chaly beats,
in the morbid disposition of the lungs, have brought on a waisting or
Consumption.

Vomits and Purges, are to be administered.
Phlebotomy therefore, and if need be vomiting, or purging, either one or
other, or both, being to be made use of at the very beginning of the disease,
the other Intentions shall be, to draw away the morbific serosities of the
blood, apt to flow forth on the head or breast, and to derive them gently by
other ways of evacuation, Blistering plasters.
and to put them forth of doors. To this end, Vesicatories or blistering
plasters, ought to be applied, to the nape of the neck, or Parotida or jugular
Arteries, or to the Armpits, or the Groin, or about the thighs, or calves of
the legs, sometimes in this part, sometimes in that; to wit, that the little
Ulcers being here and there excited, and continually running, might plentifully
pour forth the serum, imbued with the morbid, and heterogeneous particles.

Diuretics.
But Remedies, gently carrying the serum, into the Reins, and urinary passages,
are most often administered with success: For this business, diuretical Apozems,
and Julaps, are to be ordained after the following forms.

A diuretic Apozem.
Take of the Roots of Scorzonera, cherfoil, grass, and of Eryngoes candied each

which restores the animal spirits, and defends them from any heterogeneous
Copula, Gentle Diaphoreticks.
are of very great use: wherefore, either the powder of pearls, or the spirit
of hearts horn, or of blood, in a moderate dose, are administered twice in a day,
viz. Morning and Evening.

Clysters are to be given almost every day, and if it be thought fit, Glisters.
a gently loosning purge, may be taken once or twice in a week.

The diet prescribed ought to be slender, as in other feavours, Diet.
let them be wholly interdicted from flesh, or broth made thereof, only let
the sick feed on Grewell, or barly-broth, and let their drink be small beer or
posset drink.

If that notwithstanding, any preventive physic, the morbific matter, should
lodge in the brain, or Lungs, or both together, so that a dissolution, or
inordination of the animal function, or also a violent cough, should assalt
them, it must be considered, what is to be done in either state of the disease,
carried forth after this manner, into an evil condition; but then the curative
Indications ought to respect the stupor, or madness, or cough: and lastly, if
in the declination of the disease, these symptoms do remit, proper Remedies are
to be adhibited, against the Atrophie, as it were the last fortress of this
Feavour.

1st. Therefore if the morbifick matter, as it is often wont, being brought to
the brain, should bring in an Insensibleness, or a soporiferous or sleepy
distemper, The Curatory Method in the unsensibleness and madness:
remedies drawing it another way, and deriving it some way from the head, and
besides such as stir up the animal spirits, and take away the impure Copula
ought carefully to be administered, wherefore in this case, the use of
Epispasticks or such things that draw the water outwardly, should be much
increased, and let the spirit of Hartshorn, be exhibited almost every sixth
hour, in a little bigger dose, let blood be also taken, by the sucking of
Leeches, more largely from the jugular veins, the Salvatella, or the sedal
veins. If the distemper remits not, the head being shaven, let Emollient
fomentations be often applied thereto: Further, let Cupping-Glasses, Plasters,
and Cataplasms, be laid to the soals of the feet, and other means of
Administrations, such as are commonly prescribed for the curing of the stupor,
or Insensibleness, ought to be used: In like manner, if on the evil, or no
Crisis of this feavour, a frenzy, or madness should come, remedies
appropriate to those distempers, are made use of.

2dly, But if either with, or without this sort of displeasure, In the Cough.
brought to the head, the Lungs also have taken the evil of this disease, so
that the sick, not yet free from the feavour, seem to fall into a waisting, or
Consumption, with a troublesome cough, with abundance of thick, and often
discolored spittle; Medicines commonly prescribed for such kind of
Distempers, are convenient enough; wherefore, pectoral Decoctions, Electuaries,
syrrops, distilled waters of milk and snails, and other remedies of the like
nature, ought diligently to be made use of; the forms of which may be found, in
the before-described Cases.

Thus far we have described the continual feavour, for the most part
convulsive, and arising no less from the fault of the nervous juice, then of
the blood: I will here further propose an example of a disease, having the
likeness of an intermitting feavour, but radicated chiefly in the nervous
juice; the nature of which kind of distemper, for that it is very rare, and
truly pertinent to our convulsive Pathologie, will appear from the following
history.

A noted Woman very young, A very rare Observation.
and endued with a more weak constitution of brain, and nervous stock, and for
that cause very obnoxious to convulsive distempers, after she had conceived
with child, about the fourth month of her being big, from cold being taken, she
was grievously afflicted with Astmatical fits, and besides, with a frequent
sinking down of her spirits: but by the use of remedies, endued with a volatile
salt, she grew well, within a fortnights space, but after that, about 14. days,
an unwonted and truly admirable distemper, fell upon this Gentlewoman.

One morning, awaking after an unquiet sleep that night, she felt a light
shivering in all her body, as if she had had the fit of an Ague: frequent
yaunings, and reatchings, with an endeavor to vomit followed thereupon: then
her urine, which was but now of a citron color, and of a laudable substance,
became pale, and waterish, and was rendered at every turn, to wit, almost every
minute of an hour: moreover, about her loins, and hypochondria, and in other
places, pains with light Convulsions, running about here and there, were
excited: which kind of symptoms plainly convulsive, with her frequent making
of a lympid urine, continued in the Morning almost to Evening, in which space
of time, a great quantity of water, at least three times more then the liquor
she had taken, was rendered; in the mean time, neither was the heat great, nor
did thirst trouble her, nor was her pulse increased: In the evening the
aforesaid distempers ceased, and her urine became citron color, and moderate;
and besides, all night she enjoyed a moderate sleep, then the morning
following, about the same hour, the fit returned, accompanied altogether with
the like symtoms, and so daily acted the same Tragedy.

The reason of it.
Visiting this Gentlewoman, after she had been sick in this manner for 12. days,
I framed the Aetiologie of the aforesaid case, to wit, that this disease,
chiefly radical in the nervous stock, did depend upon the effervescency, and
flux of the humor, watering the nervous parts: For it might be suspected, that
this water being diffused from the blood, made degenerate by reason of the
suppression of her Terms, upon the brain, and nervous stock, became more sharp,
and serous than it ought to be, and for that cause incongruous to the
containing parts: wherefore, being gathered together to a plenitude, by the
nights sleep, it did stir them up, or provoke them, for the expulsion of it,
every where into wrinklings, and contractions: hence shiverings, yaunings,
streachings, and wandering pains, were excited in the whole body: Furthermore,
from the sollid parts, after this manner contracted, and shaken, not only the
nervous Liquor, but also the nutricious, every where laid up in the sollid
parts, but not truly assimilated, were shaken off: and then, either Latex,
being exterminated from its receptacles, and received by the veins, or
Lymphaducts, or water-carrying vessels, was rendered to the Mass of blood:
from whose bosom, before it had acquired a lixiviall tincture from it, being
at last cast forth by the reins, constituted a clear, and Copious urine: But
that this distemper observed such exact periods, the reason is, because the
nervous water, being supplied with an equal dimension, did arise to a fullness
of running over, daily at the set time: Therefore also, the urine appeared
concocted, and yellow, before and after the fit, because then its matter
consisted only from the serum of the blood: Afterward, during the convulsive
fit, the limpid humor being shaken off, from the solid and nervous parts, and
passing quickly through the blood, adulterated the color and the quantity of
the urine. I prescribed to this big-bellied woman, Phlebotomie, and besides, a
powder composed out of Coral, pearls, ivory, and other Cardiacks, to be taken
thrice in a day, in a proper Liquor; morning and evening she took of the
tincture of Antimony, 12. drops (whose singular effect in the too great flux of
urine, I have many times experienced): By the use of these, all the symptoms
ceased, in a short time.

CHAPTER IX. Of Universal Convulsions, which are wont to be excited, because of
the Scorbutic disposition of the Nervous juice.
Universal Convulsions by reason of the Scorbutic disposition of the nervous
juice.
THus much concerning universal Convulsions, diffused through the whole nervous
kind, which come upon feavours; and especially concerning the Convulsions,
which are wont to be excited, in the commonly called malignant hectic
Feaevour. There yet remains (which was proposed in the third place) for us to
show, by what means, and from what causes, universal Convulsions are induced,
without poison or feavourish infection, by reason of the scorbutic, or
otherwise vicious dyscrasie or evil disposition, of the nervots juice. For
indeed, the Liquor watering both the nerves, and the nervous parts, sometimes
disceding from its natural disposition, is so much stuffed with heterogeneous
and explosive particles, that the animal spirits, admitting an incongruous
Copula, every where growing to themselves, are irritated into continual, as it
were cracklings, or convulsive explosions: These kind of Affections of the
spirits, Two kinds of these viz. Separate and Connex or joined together.
are either divided or separated, between which no Communication, or dependency
intercedes, viz. When many parts of the body are troubled at once, with so many
Convulsions proper to themselves, which do not come successively one from
another, but are terminated in the same muscle or member, where they begin:
After which manner, I have known some sick people, who have had their muscles
and tendons, all at once in their whole body, perpetually to leap forth, with
so many distinct Convulsions. Or Secondly, the Convulsive Distempers, which are
excited in the whole nervous kind together, are continued or connex, which
succeed one another, with a certain perpetual vicissitude continued between
themselves: Forasmuch as inordinate motions, almost of all the members,
mutually relieving themselves, being risen in one part, presently pass over to
others. For so Horstius relates of a maid, obnoxious to Convulsive motions,
whose members and Limbs not only were forced into diverse manner of flections
and distortions, but besides, as if agitated by an evil Spirit, not being able
to stand in a place, she was necessitated to run up and down here and there,
and to dance, and leap in the Hot-house; nor could be hindered from it by any
force or chiding, but that she would run here and there; now she would cast her
self on her feet, now impetuously fling her self after another manner, for if
she did endeavor never so little to be quiet, presently her Praecordia was
most grievously afflicted. Wherefore, the Business of our present task is, to
enquire a little more exactly, into the nature and Causes of either Convulsive
Affection, to wit, both of that, which is affected through the very much
leaping of the tendons and muscles together, and of this, which is caused
through the madness and inquietudes of the members or of the whole body: that
from thence it may appear, what method of healing ought to be administered in
either Case.

As to the former kind, it easily appears, that these kind of distempers, The
nature of the broken Convulsive distemper.
are not simple, but complicated, to wit, of a Convulsion, and Palsy. For the
muscles and tendons, are perpetually urged with Convulsive motions,
notwithstanding, the sick being made weak, they are not able strongly to move
any of their members, or their whole body: yea, to these Distempers, pains
equally diffused through all the Limbs, are adjoined. Hence we may infer, that
the animal Spirits are imbued, with a manifold Copula, viz. both with
explosive, and also narcotick ot stupifying, and in some sort irritative or
provoking particles: so that, although being always burdened, they enter into
explosions, yet, not many together, nor indeed any hastily or strongly are
exploded, by reason of the other interjected Particles of another kind;
wherefore the motive force does not long continue, but is short, and as it were
interrupted: just as if gunpowder being kneeded with some muddy substance,
should be fired: for then the whole mass is not let off at once, with a noise,
nor does one heap presently fire another, but a few grains only, and those
successively, to wit, one a little while after another, with small crackling
noises, are let off or exploded: In like manner, the nervous Liquor is stuffed
thorowout, with Convulsive particles, which even cleave to the Spirits: but
forasmuch, as some narcotick, and other painful ones, are mingled with them,
the elastick force of the former, however lasting, and greatly diffused, is yet
much broken and every where cut off.

For the illustrating this kind of broken convulsive Distemper, An observation.
I will here describe a very notable case of a certain Gentleman lately living
in this neighborhood: which being truly admirable, not any writings or
observations of Physicians, have scarce showed the like. An honorable
Gentleman whom I knew, sprung from Parents, and grandfathers obnoxious to a
someways morbid disposition either of the Brain, or nerves, about the hight or
beyond the strength of his Age, the fruit of this diseased Race began to punish
him: for first of all, he was wont to be tormented with a debility, and
numbness of his Limbs, and with light Convulsions; with which kind of
Distempers, when he had a while labored at length, for cure sake going to the
Bath, having used too much the hot bathes, instead of a remedy, he brought back
only an exasperation of the Disease, that from that time, the aforesaid
Symptoms did not any more torment him by fits, but almost continually, to wit,
the Convulsive motions, and painful extensions, did incessantly exercise every
Limb, yea, every part of his Body, so that all the muscles were perpetually
drawn together, with repeated leapings all at once, and that not without great
torment: The only means he had for quieting them, was to exercise his whole
body, sometimes some of his members, perpetually with a local motion: for so
long as he was awake, he was necessitated to be rocked in his bed, or on his
couch, or to be carried in a Coach, or to have his members press't or rubbed;
for which end they had made for him a Bed, and a Chair set upon bowfashon'd
feet, such as are on Childrens Cradles, in which, when he lay down or sat
upright, he was moved up and down continually, with a tottering or rocking
motion; which unless he did, he was infested with most cruel pain, and horrid
extensions of his muscles: This kind of daily trouble, of the Convulsive
Distemper, in the nightime, and presently after sleep; entertained much more
grievous Symptoms: for being newly awaked, his whole body presently was wont to
quake, his muscles to be exercised with painful stretchings, every Limb to be
wetted with a squalid or ill-favored sweat, as if in the agony of Death, which
was so very Corrosive, that, like aqua fortis, unless they presently wiped it
off, it quickly eat and rotted the Linen. The sick man, during this Conflict,
was tormented for many hours, between the sweats and shiverings, until being
quite tired out, sleep creeping upon him, brought him some ease; but if at the
approach of the fit, he was presently taken out of his Bed, he was better, and
so prevented the wonted cruelty of the Distemper: Therefore, as soon as he was
awaked from sleep, though it happened within half an hour, immediately to avoid
the torture, his servants being called, they took him out of his Bed: As to his
Appetite he was well enough, he eat without loathing, nor was his stomach
disturbed with what he eat: Bur he did often complain of the pain of the heart,
and sometimes a troublesome Spitting, with a stink in his mouth, as if he had
taken Mercury, molested him for many days. All hot things, whether food or
Physic, did nor agree with his constitution; he did not dare to taste, either
wine, or strong beer: In the first years of his sickness, he abhorred the very
sight of the fire, afterward becoming weaker; though the winter was sharp he
would not sit near the Chimny; his Urine was always of a Citron color, which
if it were evaporated in an earthen vessel, over hot coals, saltish
faeculencies remained in the bottom, to above half the Liquor; his belly was
continually bound, and never put forth its load, unless provoked by a purge or
Clyster: Yea, besides the Convulsive motions, a Spurious Palsy possessed every
member of his whole Body, for he could not lift up his hand, nor step a foot
forward; his tongue shaking, brought forth his words but imperfect, but
sometimes, when his mind was carried sorth, by some sudden occasion of Joy, he
would be able, his Spirits being raised with a wonderful strength, suddenly to
rise out of his chair, and without the help of another, to stand upright, and
to jump, which interval however lasted scarce a minute of an hour, but that his
members flagg'd, and were affected with their wonted languor and trembling.
When this worthy Gentleman, had been sick after this manner above 12. years,
and had consulted the most famous Physicians in all England, and had tried very
many Remedies, and almost of every kind, viz. Antiparalytick, antiscorbutick,
drying Diets, Sweating medicines, purges, Causticks, baths, Liniments, yea, and
had twice tried salivation, could find no cure by any method of healing;
wherefore, all hope of cure being wholly laid aside, for the latter seven years
of his life, he made use of only Remedies, chiefly respecting some Symptoms,
viz. he took thrice in a week a solutive medicine, of Senna and Rubarb with
Correctives, now in form of a Syrrop, or of an extract another time; every
night he was wont to take a dose of an opiate, out of conserves, and temperate
Species: Besides, as occasions served, he had ready a Julap, to be taken when
his Spirits fainted: moreover, he continually drunk Beer, made of oaten malt,
altered with temperate and diuretical herbs. By the use of these, he passed
over at least seven years, without any great alteration for the worse; at
length, old Age coming on him, together with the disease, more cruel fits of
Convulsions, not as at first after sleep, but as soon as he was warm in his bed,
invaded him, that he was forced to abstain altogether from his Bed, and rarely
put off his clothes, unless to shift his Linen: from hence transpiration being
hindered, the serous Recrements, and others; wont to be evaporated, were fixed
on the Lungs, which at first, brought in a frequenr or short breathing,
afterward an Asthmatical Distemper, and lastly a deadly Consumption or wasting.

If the Reasons of the aforesaid Symptoms be sought after, it will be easy,
The reasons of the symptoms chiefly tormenting.
to deduce all these evils from a depraved Constitution of the Brain, and
nervous stock, and more immediately from the dyscrasie, and fault, of the juice
watering those parts. For when that Liquor, in which the animal Spirits, do
abound, was, as to its temper, highly sharp and Corrosive, like Stygian water,
and as to its mixion, was fluffed full of both narcotick and explosive
particles, it is no wonder, because the Spirits being very much burdened, and
for that cause restrained from their due expansion, that they should be forced
every where into small explosions, as it were Cracklings; and that the
containing bodies, being loosed from their due extension and strength, should
be also continually irritated into painful Corrugations or shrinkings up.

Those Convulsive Distempers, did more sharply infest after sleep, The growing
worse presently after sleep whence it proceeded.
because the heat of the Bed, did exuscitate or stir up the heterogeneous
particles of the nervous juce, and rarifying them, as it were compelled them
into explosions; then also, because the nervous parts did imbibe its juce in
sleep, and a more plentiful provision of the morbifick matter, brought
together with it; which being filled to a plentitude, at the first instant of
waking, they immediately endeavor to shake off what is troublesome. For this
Reason, it is observed, that the pains of Scorbutical people, and the fits of
Asthmatical, are made worse by the heat of the bed, and by sleep; therefore as
in these, presently to leave the bed, was wont to give ease, so likewise it did
in our sick man: But that the trouble, Why allayed by Motion.
excited by the continual leapings, and painful extentions of the muscles, was
somewhat allayed by the local motion, or moving from one place to another, of
the body, or members, the reason is, because the Animal Spirits, whilst they
are compelled to diverse actions from without; they remit whatsoever
inordinations are excited from within: for as in pain, and itching, which are
lighter Convulsions, it helps to press, rub, or scratch the affected part, so
the Convulsive motions of the muscles, and tendons, are somewhat pleased, by
the inordinate agitation of the whole body, or the members.

As to the Ptyalismus, or copious spitting, with the stinking breath, The
spitting.
which was wont to return at uncertain intervalls, we do suppose, that might
perchance proceed from Mercury sometime secretly given, although I have seen
many laboring both with Convulsive, and also scorbutic distempers, in whom
this kind of perpetual defluxion of spittle from the mouth, was very
troublesome, without any suspicion of Mercury; also some (as shall be told
hereafter) on whom a salivation coming (the explosive matter being after this
manner Critically evacuated) helped the disease: moreover, it is likely, that
this distemper was produced from the mere recrements of the nervous juice; and
that the salival passages, when many, and enough were open, did receive, and
convey forth of doors, the superfluities plentifully deposited in the
glandula's, from the nerves, and also from the Arteries.

As to the lucid Intervalls, whereby the sick man used to obtain some truces,
Why this sick man obtained some truce from pains.
though short, the cruelties as it were of the disease being mitigated, as when
but now his sickness had bound him to his chair, he was able on a sudden to
leap up, and walk about; but yet, this unlook'd-for strength being vanished, by
and by falling again into his wonted languishment: I say these kind of motions
of laboring Nature, prostrate under a great burden, are its utmost
endeavors, and some more strong inforcements, to wit, whereby for a moment of
time she recollects her self, and attempts as it were to shake off the yoke of
the Disease; but because she is not able to sustain long this strife, she
quickly relapses, and lies down under her former burden. Truly it is a wonder,
how much above the strength of Nature, Anger, and fear, and some other passions
of the mind, do stretch the nervous kind, and compel them to show a force
plainly stupendous: But these prodigies of her attempts, are only of a small
duration. The secret leading cause of the aforesaid distemper.


The Conjunct cause of the aforesaid disease being after this manner designed,
and the Reasons of the Symptoms chiefly tormenting, being shown, it remains yet
for us to inquire into the secret leading cause, to wit, by what occasions, the
nervous juice being become so degenerate, at first brings in the Palsy, and
then leapings, or intestine Convulsions of all the muscles: further, we ought
to explain wherefore the fruits of this Disease, increasing by little and
little, came suddenly to maturity, by the use of the Baths; also wherefore this
sickness yielding to no Remedies became uncurable.

As to the first, it may be said, that the sick person, being sprung from
parents who were obnoxious greatly to Cephallic Diseases, had contracted
originally an evil Constitution of the brain, and nervous stock, so that
within the 6th luster ( i.e. about the 36th year) of his Age, he began to be
sick of a spurious Palsy, then, when the evident causes daily fixing the
infection more on the blood and humors, did happen upon this remote hereditary
cause (for there were many chances, and unfortunate accidents, which
continually brought sadness, and melancholy upon this Gentleman) indeed
therefore, the nervous Liquor being imbued above measure, with a fixed and
Scorbutic salt, became highly sharp and irritative, like aqua fortis, or the
Stagma's of Vitriol; and so continually incited the Spirits, and the bodies
containing them, into Corrugations and contractions, just as the aforesaid
Liquors when poured upon worms do the same thing.

Why this Distemper grew worse by the use of the Baths.
But that this disease, leasurly at first increasing, was quickly brought into a
much worse condition, by the use of the hot Bathes, the reason easily appears:
It is known by experience, that the hot Bathes, do very much exalt, and quickly
bring to the hight, the Sulphureous-saline particles, in the humane body, and
otherwise morbid, which abound in the Bowels, and humors, viz. do render them
more fierce by agitating them thoroughly, and force them from their first
passages into the blood, and from thence into the Brain and nervous stock, yea,
and join together those, that were before separate, and idle, and incite them
into a certain fermentation: wherefore, those who are hereditarily obnoxious to
the Gout or Stone, and have not as yet suffered any fits of those distempers,
very often feel the fruit of either disease in themselves to grow ripe soon, by
the use of the Bathes: When therefore in this sick person, both the blood, and
Liquor watering the Brain and nerves, were imbued both with narcotick or
stupifying, and convulsive particles; and also when they did degenerate from
their sweet, and balsamy Disposition, that toward a saltish, and this into a
sour, Ciaemul of a Stagma of Vitriol, the use of the hot mineral waters, was
so far from bringing help, that on the contrary, these evils, for that very
cause, presently grew all very much worse: and the Disease, proceeding from the
humors being so depraved, as to their temper and mixture, could never be cured
by any medicines, no easier than vinegar may be reduced into wine.

When this Gentleman's body, being at last dead of the Phthisis or Consumption,
was opened by me, we could find but very few footsteps, of these kind of
most grievous Symptoms. Hence, as it appeared, the Palsy and Convulsion, did
not depend, so much on a thick and copious matter, heaped together somewhere in
mines, as of an evil affection of the animal Spirits, who are subtle and
Invisible. I will lay forth, what was worthy taking notice of, in the anatomy
of this person.

Things worthy to be noted in the body being dissected.
The Abdomen being opened, the Caul (as is wont to be in most who dye of a
Consumption, and other Chronical Diseases) was putrified, and almost consumed.
In the mean time, the Ventricle, Intestines, Pancreas, and Mesentery, were well
enough, to wit, the membranes were firm, well coulour'd, and free from any
ulcer, or hard swelling: There grew to the greater Intestines certain
excrescencies like to the ears of a mouse; for that there were very many of
these kind of things out of either side of the Colon, and right intestine,
they showed like twins at certain distances, like the branches of Trees: The
like I formerly found in a Consumptive person: The Reason of this seems to be,
that the nourishment in Consumptive people, (though it be deficient about the
more solid, and outward parts, yet sometimes) within near the fountains of the
nourishing juice, performs more than it ought, and for that cause, superfluous
and unnatural additions grow forth.

The milt or Spleen, which always is thought ill of, and of most Physicians
condemned, for being the Principal cause of the Scurvy, and of all other
distempers, appear altogether blameless, and free from any fault: For, as in
most sound people, we observed, it was of a darkish Color, soft and of an
equal superficies, free from any obstruction, or swelling, endued with
vessels, and fibers, distinct, and firm enough: out of its substance, flowed
black biood when it was cut.

The Liver (which indeed might be wondered at) was indifferently well, neither
was it, from so long and grievous a sickness, become harder then usual, or
scirrhous, or planted with little whelks, but it was somewhat big, and of a
darkish color.

The Kidnys, though free from any ulcer, or gravel, were not however free from
fault: for in the middle of the right Kidney, was seen a great cavity, distinct
from the Tunell, and much greater then it, full of clear water: the like I have
very often found, in hydropical people: But indeed, this perhaps arose, from
the serum deposited in that kidny, that could not easily be strained through its
passages, and pores; for that the serum subsisting therein, had in the
beginning made for it self a little den, which afterward by degres was
enlarged, and when for this Reason, the secretion of the serum, and its passing
forth by the ureter, were something hindered, its Latex restagnating into the
blood, brought in the grievous trouble to the head; which indeed was the rather
to be suspected, because also the left Kidny, being mightily extenuated, and
consumed, contained many Cisterns, and Cavities full of clear water.

The Lungs, growing on every side to the Sternum, (or part of the breast where
the ribs meet) sides, and Diaphragma, seemed without any distinction of Lobes,
of one substance only of putrid spongy flesh, sta^fed throughout with a frothy
or ichorous matter: without doubt, the sick man had not contracted this evil
so long before, to wit, when he was not able to perform any exercise of the
Body, nor stay in bed that it might breathe out any thing more freely, the
faeculencies and recrements of the blood, which were wont to evaporate through
the skin, being laid up in the Lungs, were the cause, that they grew together
among themselves, and with other parts, and did vitiate their tone and
conformation wholly, so that, a Consumption being at last arisen, was the
effect and product, and not the cause of the rest of the distempers, wherewith
he had bin a long while miserably afflicted.

In either ventricle of the heart, blood was concreted into a solid whitish
substance, and baked like flesh, which being formed near the Cavities, and
processes of the vessels of the Heart, resembled the figure of a Serpent, with
a manifold divided tail: than which indeed nothing is more usual, in many dead
People after long sickness: The reason of which is, that the Blood being
without life, from long sickness, and from thence circulated slowly about the
Praecordia, begins to stand or stagnate in the heart, and depending vessels,
and by that means, is congealed leasurely, into this kind of fleshy Concrete.

When the Skull was opened, we sought among its contents, the chief Cause of
the Disease: The first thing that occurred was, the bulk of the brain was less
than it should be, and folded into fewer folds, from whence we suspected, that
the Animal Spirits, were not plentifully enough brought forth: Further, the
whole substance of the head, was more moist than it ought to be, and wholly
immersed in a wet watery humor, that its Covering, viz. the whole meninges,
were pulled asunder, and the compassing or crevices, and all the ventricles,
run over with clear water. It Is probable, that this deluge of the Brain, had
lately happened, to wit, forasmuch, as by reason perspiration being hindered, and
the Secretion of urine being but little, the serosities gathered together in
the bloody mass, were carried to the head, and therefore, the substance of the
Brain, and especially the chancelled or checkered bodies, were so wholly
wetted, and soked, that being cut, their substance could scarce remain
compacted, but that it would flow away, somewhat after the manner of thick
Liquids: within the bosoms overlying, and inserted to the brain, and its
Appendix, and the vessels coming from them, the blood had concreted into
little, round, hard, and as it were fleshy balls, just like those within the
ventricles of the heart, and the vessels hanging to them, which also lately,
when the Blood circulated slowly, we thought might happen, for the same reason,
for which the blood was coagulated within the Praecordia.

The trunk of the Spinal marrow, being drowned in clear water, was very much
extenuated, that it could scarce fill half of the bony cavity or hollowness:
which we thought to be effected, by the deluge of salt Serum, in which it was
as it were boiled.

The Nature, and the manner, of the continued convulsive distemper being made
So much concerning universal Convulsions, which being very much conjoined with
the Paralytick Distemper, are excited dividedly in many parts at once: There
remains others, which we called continued, because being suddenly translated,
from some parts to others, they mutually relieve one another, and compel the
members; now these, now those, and often the whole body, to be involuntarily
moved, and diversely bended, or agitated. In these Cases, the Animal Spirits,
not only those implanted in private corners, and mines, get to themselves an
explosive Copula, and being some how satisfied, or irritated, strike it off by
certain turns; but when the whole mass of the nervous Liquor, abundantly
abounds with elastick particles, they then every where cleaving to both the
Spirits implanted, and flowing in, for that reason stir them up into Continual
Convulsions: But forasmuch, as not all the Spirits at once, are not able,
however predisposed, to be exploded, (because within the nervous passages,
there is not room large enough for their so great agitations) therefore the
explosive force, arising in these, or those parts, is by and by transferred,
from thence, unto others, and so to others, and so like fire-draks, or
wildfire, it runs wandringly here and there, most swiftly creeping from these
Limbs, to those, and then presently from all into the Praecordia, or Viscera,
and back again. That the Image of those kind of distempers may be known, we
will here propose some more rare Cases; of sick persons, whom sometime past I
endeavored to Cure.

Amber by a tunnell into her mouth, she was suddenly cured, to wit, the
Catarrh, or violent Rhume ceased suddenly, but from thence she complained of a
notable Vertigo, with a pain in the head, and of the tingling noise of the
ears: on the Third day, the tendons of the hinder part of her neck, were pulled
together, that her head was bended now forward, now backward, and now of one
side, sometime it continued stiff and unmovable; a little after this, the same
kind of Convulsive Distemper invaded the outward members, and Limbs of the
whole body, her arms and hands were wonderfully turned about, that no jugler or
tumbler could imitate their bendings, and rollings about; she was necessitated
to spread abroad her legs, and feet, here and there, to strike them against
one another, and to transpose or cross them by turns: After this manner either
sitting in a Chair or lying in a Bed she was perpetually afflicted with these
Convulsive motions, unless when overwhelmed with sleep; and when she did a
little restrain her members from the great labor of the Muscles, presently she
was taken with a difficult and short-breathing with a sense of Choking; but in
the mean time, her eyes, jaws, mouth, and lower bowels, remained free from any
Convulsion; neither was she troubled with vomiting, belching, nor any inflation
of the belly, and hypochondria: Besides she was still her self, and had truly
the use of her memory, understanding, and fantasy, she did, nor said any
thing madly, or foolishly: but in these wonderful evils, she shew^d an
admirable example of Christian fortitude, and patienee, even with godly and
discreet speeches; her appetite was soon lost, so that she took any meat or
aliment very unwillingly; thirst continually troubled her, and her strength was
grown so feeble, that she could not stand or walk, her urine was of a Citron
color, very full of saltness, on whose superficies grew little tararous skins.

When I was sent for to this Gentlewoman, on the Sixth day of her sickness, I
framed the Aetiology of this kind of admirable distemper: For the
consideration of her father, who at that time was sick in the same house, with
most grievous Convulsive passions, kept me, that I did not with many others,
refer all things to the delusions of witches: wherefore, that I might seek out
the natural Causes of these Symptoms, it was in the first place plainly to be
suspected, that this Gentlewoman had contracted hereditarily the seeds of
Convulsive Distempers, which at length, about the flower of her age, broke
forth into this kind of fruit: for when her blood was very much imbued with
heterogeneous and explosive particles, they at length (as is wont in such a
disposition) began to be poured into the head, and there to be fixed: being
therefore first deposited in the Meningae, they induced the huge periodicall
headache; then afterward, the same matter having accidentally shifted its
place, falling down into the sinks of the throat and mouth, changed the
Cephalage or headache, into a Catarrh or Rhume: and when lastly by an untimely
use of the administered Remedy, the defluxion stopped, the morbifick matter
flowing back into the brain, brought the Vertigo; and then, being thrust forth
on the nervous stock, it excited the aforesaid Convulsive Affections.

As to the formal Reason, or the means of generation, The reason of the
aforesaid case.
whereby the Convulsive matter, falling down into the nervous stock; did
produce these admirable Symptoms, we may lawfully suppose, that the same being
thrust forth from the Confines of the head, being yet more firm, into the
spinal marrow, and its Appendix; and being like a malignant firment, it first
infected, with heterogeneous and highly explosive particles, these parts of the
juce watering the whole mass; which cleaving to the spirits, every where
disposed through their whole series, and agitating them, as it were with a
certain fury, did stir them up into continual explosions: When in truth, the
nervous juice, as is said, was so fermented by the inflowing of the Convulsive
matter, that which did other ways water the containing parts, with a gentle
falling on them, and through the same; did pass over the animal spirits; with
an equal Expansion; now the same did torment the nervous fibers, with various
contractions; and Corrugations or shrinkings up, and did hinder both the
spirits flowing in, being too much burdened with an heterogeneous Copula, from
their due irradiation, and also variously moving those implanted in every part,
did incite them, as it were with a diabolical Inspiration, so that no more
obeying the Empire of the will, they ran into inordinate motions, and did renew
them; translated rapidly here ahd there, with a perpetual reciprocation.

But, although the heterogeneous particles, being poured forth with the blood,
into the brain, and thence thrust forth into the nervous stock, did not enter
rightly the beginnings of all the nerves, but chiefly and almost only the
spinal marrow, and its nervous shoots; so that the internal Viscera, also the
parts of the eyes, mouth, and face, remained free from any Convulsion: yet,
that same explosive force, being hindered by some violence, whereby it entered
less in the outward members, presently like wildfire, a way being found, it
was wont to run into the praecordia, and bowels of the lower belly: viz.
because the inflowing spirits, being struck with a certain fury, and requiring
a larger space, in which they might exercise their madness, being excluded from
one place, presently enter another somewhere open: wherefore, if that fury had
been repulsed, both from the members, and the viscera, no doubt but it would
have flown back on the brain, and brought thither, madness, or as it were an
Epileptical Insensibleness: which Symptoms indeed happened to be wanting, for
that the brain of this most ingenious Gentlewoman, being endued with a more
firm Constitution, did take from the nervous Liquor freshly instilled,
whatsoever was congruous and spiritous, for its proper food, and enjoyed it: In
the mean time, it did depress all the morbific particles, into the spinal
marrow, by which the involuntary motions of the members were excited, after
that manner as we said but now.

Being requested to undertake the Cure of this worthy Virgin, first, The
Curatory Method Observed in this case.
a light preparation of her body being made, I gave her a solutive potion of
the Infusion of Senna and Rhubarb, with yellow Sanders and salt of Wormwood
added to it, by which she was purged 12 times with great ease, the next day I
took viii. ounces of blood from her left Arm, every evening I gave her an
opiate of the water, and Syrrop of the flowers of Lungwort, with the powder of
pearls: besides, once within vi. hours, I prescribed her to take a dose of the
spirits of Hartshorn, in a draught of the following Julap. Take of the waters
of black Cherries, Walnuts, and the flowers of Paeony, each iii. of the
Antipeleptic of Langius ii. of the Syrrop of the flowers of the male-paeony ii.
of the powder of pearls i. mix it and make a Julap: because she could not
endure much purging, Clysters with Sugar'd-milk, were made use of frequently:
besides antispasmodic ointments, being applied to the hinder part of her neck,
and the backbone, we ordered often rubbing of the distempered members, with
warm woollen Clothes wetted in proper oil.

By the use of these, the sick person within 6 days, seemed to be very much
helped; for the Convulsive motions almost wholly ceased, and she could contain
her members quietly in their due position, only her head sometimes by a lighter
Contraction was compelled to bend gently this way and that way; further she was
able to stand a little, and rise out of her chair, but when she went to step
forward, she went not rightly, but obliquely on one side: At this time going
away, I left her much better, and in a manifest state of growing well: But
after another week, when the North-winde being high, and arisen in Night time,
the window not being fast shut, blew very much upon the sick person being in
Bed, she presently taking cold, relapsed into that kind of Condition, that she
became obnoxious not only to Convulsive passions, but to an universal
periodical palsy: for after that she was forced to move about, turn, and wind
variously, all her limbs successively, with her head, and members by turns,
bent, and thrown about here and there (as before) from morning to night; till
at night these kind of motions wholly ceasing, a resolution of her members, or
palsy succeeded, so that she was not able to stir either hand or foot, or any
other part of her body besides, or to exereise any motive bending of the body,
lying in her bed almost, immovable like a stone; but being a little refreshed
with sleep, about morning, as she recovered some little strength or virtue of
the regular motive faculty, by bending, tho but weakly here and there, her
arms, and legs, so also the involuntary, and Convulsive motions, did constantly
return, enduring from that time, all the day, which again at the Evening, were
changed into these resolutions of the Limbs.

By these it appears clearly, that the sick Gentlewoman labored with a
twofold disease, viz. a Palsy, and Convulsion, and that the material Cause
of either, was somewhat distinct: For it seems, that the animal spirits, every
where abounding, being burdened with narcotick particles, were almost
continually bound: besides that, in the time of sleeping, together with the
nervous juiee, the Convulsive particles, plentifully flowing in, clove also to
the spirits: for the explosions of which, the spirits being incited, produced
the involuntary motions: but also at that time, the narcotic Copula being
somewhat shaken off, they were then able in some sort to perform the voluntary
or regular also: Besides the Remedies but now recited, they did carefully
administer very many others, almost of every kind, viz. Antiscorbuticks,
antiparaleticks, Decoctions, sudorificks, or sweating medicines, distilled
waters, spirits, Elixirs, Tincture, Baths, Liniments, with many others; by the
use of which, the Symptoms were something remitted, but yet the disease was not
wholly cured, the universal palsy soon ceased, that she was able at any time
to move her Limbs, and to bend them here and there; and also the involuntary
motions did trouble her but rarely, yet she continued Languishing, and weak;
and when she being of a more fine temper, and prone to a Consumption, by reason
transpiration was hindered, the recrements of the bloods being laid up in the
Lungs, brought in a Cough, which every day growing worse, she at length dyed of
a Phthisis or wasting.

Diaphragma, and muscles serving for breathing: for every minute of an hour and
oftener, her backbone was suddenly bent in, about its middle, and together her
breast shooting out forward, and her hypochondria being drawn inwards, she made
a noysie sobbing, now double, now threefold, but still with a less and less
noise: this kind of motion, and ebbing of a crashing noise, was wont to come
for many hours, and so that she might be heard through the whole house; and
when any short interval of this happened, she was compelled presently to shake,
or writhe together extremely her arms, and hands, and sometimes her legs and
feet, and also to fling about most furiously her head, and by and by to hold
her neck, as it were stiff and immovable: and then in speaking, her tongue
would be taken after that manner, that she would repeat the same word very
often, yea sometimes twenty times at least: when the Convulsive motions
tormented her strongly in her outward members, she was free for a little while
from that throtling, and noisie distemper, and this space of intermission she
called her time of ease; tho in the mean time, her head, and members were
carried violently here and there, with Convulsive Motions: if at any time she
lay on her left side, presently a contraction of her right hypochondrium
inwards, with a sobbing or throtling, vexed her. Within a few days, her
strength being very much lost, by the assiduity of the passions, she contracted
so great an imbecility in her Loins, and joints of her legs, that she could
not stand, nor lean on her feet: Her Stomach, distemperd either with weakness,
or the Convulsion, returned back whatever was put into it, by vomit.

In this Case, as in the former, it appears, clearly, that the Animal spirits,
The nature and cause of the discribed case.
not only those implanted in this or that part or region, had contracted an
heterogeneous Copula to be shaken off by some turns, but also the spirits
influencing some nerves, being imbued with explosive particles, had brought in
the perpetual, and wandering Convulsive Motions. And when at first it happened,
that the spirits so afflicted, did assolt, not all the nerves together, nor any
indifferently, but for the most part, only those belonging to the Diaphragma,
and the Appendixes of the spinal marrow, so that within those spaces, the fury
of the spirits, perpetually explosing, was limited, for this reason it happened,
that the convulsive affections being restrained, in any one of those parts, did
break forth more furiously strait in another; and when by their proper
instinct, their motive force was employed in one Region, the same was in the
mean time, wont to be remitted in another. Moreover in this sick person, the
morbific matter, consisting both of narcotick and convulsive particles, caused
together the paralytick, and convulsive distemper.

Coming to her on the 4th day, I gave her an Emetick potion, by which she
vomited 7 times, abundance of ropy phlegm, with yellow choler, yet without any
ease: on the next day, I took six ounces of blood, from her left Arm, presently
from thence, the blood being more impetuously carried, toward the head, she
complained mightily of an headache, and giddiness; But within 3 days she being
let blood in the foot, found her self better: she afterward took Remedies for
the distempers of the nerves, to wit, spirits of Hartshorn, and of blood,
Bezoartick and shelly powders, Julaps, and Electuaries, antispasmodical: by the
use of these, the Symptoms seemed to be something remitted, but yet they
remained somewhat after the manner but now described: After a fortnight, by the
prescription of a certain Country-Woman, she took in a draught of beer, 6
spoonfulls of blood, taken from the ear of an Ass, by which she seemed on a
sudden to be cured: for forthwith all the Convulsive motions did leave, and she
remained free from them 24 hours; but yet the disease returning the next day,
with its wonted fierceness, would not give place, neither to that Remedy, nor
indeed easily to any others: she therefore for the future, took medicines
methodically prescribed: Once within 6 days, she was gently purged, besides she
took the powder composed of Bezoar, pearls, and Corrall, with the roots and
seeds of Paeony, also an Electuary, prescribed by Horstius for these kind of
admirable Convulsions; also Julap, and decoctions, proper in convulsive
Distempters: Clysters were often used, frictious, ointments, and vesicatories
were administered with success: within another week, the sobbing affection
wholly ceased, and likewise the other convulsive motions, being grown more
gentle by degrees, very much remitted: Growing well of these distempers, a
Catharr falling down in her throat, she was so much troubled, that she almost
continually spit forth a sharp, and as it were Corrosive spittle, as if she had
had a salivation by taking Mercury: which kind of Remedy indeed, has been
found to have been the last event in this case: but I wholly abstained from
administering it, because both the sick, and her friends, would not give me
leave.

After this plentiful, and troublesome spitting had continued for many days,
the disease seemed almost to be wholly Cured: so that this noble Gentlewoman,
being free of her Convulsive motions, went abroad, and was well, both in
strength and stomach. Only she complained, that oftentimes in a day, she was
suddenly afflicted, for about a minute of an hour, with a shivering of her
whole body; which kind of Distemper coming upon her sometimes in the night,
broke her sleep: within the space of a month, this Symptom also, and likewise
her Catarrh wholly ceased: But from thence, she was sometimes afflicted with an
extreme Soureness, in her ventricle, and the passage of the Oesophagus, and
sometimes also in her mouth, and palate, that it was feared lest the inward
skin being fretted, those parts should Contract an ulcerous disposition;
besides she was wont to be tormented often in her sleep, sometimes also being
awake, with the nightmare or Incubus. For this I prescribed, Spring and fall,
a gentle purge to be administered, with the use of antiscorbutick Remedies, and
sometimes Chalibiates, or medicines of prepared steel, which kind of method
she observed so much to her benefit, that she was well in health for many
years, and is as yet well.

Among the many Remedies, which were taken against that Sourness, and as it
were ulcerous disposition of the pallat, and Oesophagus, I prescribed, that she
should drink every morning, her own urine fresh made; this, whilst it was very
Saltish, was wont to give her great ease; but at sometimes, her urine flowed
from her thin and plentifully, which being nothing salt, but like to sour
vinegar, from the drinking of that she received little or no benefit.

The Reason of the Case but now described, seems not much unlike the former,
unless that in this sick Gentlewoman, the explosive particles had entered into
more passages of the nerves, to wit, besides the appendixes of the spinall
marrow, into those dedicated for the office of breathing, and also by fits,
into those designed for the motion of the Tongue, and almost perpetually
tormented the Spirits abounding in them, with Rage or fury.

But that the Cure of this Disease hapen'd, by the falling down of the sharp
humor, into the emunctories of the mouth, and throat, we may from thence
gather, that the material Cause of this, was the heterogeneous particles, and
as it were nitrous, begotten in the blood; which, when from thence, being
passed through from the brain, they were carried into the nervous stock, caused
the aforesaid Distempers: But as soon as by the help of Remedies, the more
plentiful provision of that matter was hinderd, and the morbifick particles
already produced, both from the blood, and the Brain, and nervous stock, were
derived into those emunctories of the head, the Convulsive Distemper presently
ceased, and within a short time, such a Crisis or secretion still remaining,
the perfect Cure of the Disease followed.

Forasmuch as the urine, being of it self very salt, and as it were lixivial,
became at some times sourish, which did not give any help, as the former, to
the sourness of the throat: it may hence be gathered, that the salt particles
of the blood, and humors, coming away by the urine, had a twofold state or
condition, to wit, of fixedness, and fluedness; wherefore the serum, imbued by
them, became now of this, now of that nature: for it seems, that the Saline
particles, being degenerate within the mass of the blood, remained fixed, and
rendered the urine for the most part Lixiviall: but those which flowed without
the blood, in the nervous juce, or were laid up about the solid parts, did
degenerate into a flux or acetousness: and therefore from these, being derived
into the emunctuaries of the mouth, that noted sourness of the mouth, and
Oesophagus proceeded: moreover, when these kind of particles, being gathered
to a fullness in the nervous juce, and solid parts, did swell up, and arising
to a fluxion, boiled up into the blood: presently these being sent away from
thence, in heaps, through the Reins, rendered the urine, increased in quantity,
sourish. But forasmuch, as the Saline particles, being of a diverse Condition,
and that those of the same kind could not be mingled together, they mutually
moved against one another, and break their forces, therefore the salt urine,
and not the sour healed the sourness of the throat. It appears by a vulgar
experiment, that the most sharp Spirit of Vitriol, by the mixture of the Salt
of Tartar, or any other lixivial, grows very mild: yea, and yet from thence
appears, that the acid humor, sweating out into the parts of the mouth and
throat of this Gentlewoman, came near the nature of sharp Vitriol; because the
fume of Tobacco, being taken at the mouth of the sick person, was wonderfully
sweet, as it happens to such, who have beforehand tasted Vitriol.

Because we treat here of admirable Convulsions, which do not ordinarily
happen, and whose nature, and causes ly deeply hid; for the better illustration
of these kind of Distempers, we will yet show one or two more Cases, no less
wonderful than the former.

About ten years since, I visited the daughter of a certain Nobleman, troubled
viscera, in the Tragedy of the distemper, did mutually relieve themseives,
returning as it were in a round.

Coming the 5th. day after this Lady had been sick, The Curatory Method.
I gave her a vomit of the fusion of Crocus Mettallorum, wine of squills, and
salt of Vitriol, by which she vomited 7 times, cancker'd oil or choler, in a
great plenty, with the mixture of a sharp, and as it were vitriolic humor: The
next day ten ounces of blood was taken from the Saphana vein; besides, she took
twice in a day, antidotes of the powders of precious Stones, of humane skull,
and the root of the male paeony. By the use of these, within a week, she seemed
to be cured, she continued for many days afterward free from the aforesaid
distempers: But after two weeks at the time of the full Moon she fell into a
relapse of the same disease more cruel than before, for besides those
wonderful leapings, and vehement Conversions and roulings about of her head
and members, she was forced besides, to fetch often a most rapid course round
about the Chamber: she began at this time, from the praescripts of others, to
take anti-hysterical Remedies, and purges at certain set intervalls, but
without any help: At last, I being sent for, because she seemed endued with a
strong habit of body, and with a notable fierceness of spirits, I gave her a
stronger Emetick, by which she vomited forth ten times, greenish Choler, like
to rust, with phlegm, sharp like stygian water, and she was suddenly eased:
After this, I gave her every morning, a draught of white wind, dilated with the
water of black Cherries, with sows or hog-lice bruised and infused therein, and
strongly pressed forth. By the Use of these, she seemed presently to be cured,
and was well above a Month: And when afterward, the distempers being about to
return, she felt at any time some forerunners, presently by the use of a vomit,
and the expression of the Millepedes or Cheslogs, she averted the approach of
the Disease: within three months, she so far recovered her former health, that
she has now lived for many years; free from those kind of Convulsive
distempers: But from the time the convulsive passions wholly ceased, she was
sometimes troubled, about the parts of her mouth, and throat, with a defluxion,
of a most sour humor, like the vitriolick Stagma; besides sometimes she was
obnoxious to the Pica or longing of women, and at sometimes also to the Cough,
with a discolored spittle, threatening a Consumption, notwithstanding which, by
remedies used in these kind of Cases, she was easily cured.

The reasons of aforesaid case.
As to the Aetiologie, or Rational account of the aforesaid Case, there is no
reason that we should fear to refer both the Causes, and Symptoms of this
disease, to the explosive particles (the brain being passed through without
hurt) sent as a supply, Continually from the blood, into the nervous stock;
which, forasmuch as they being poured forth in great plenty, were not
restrained within private mines, to be struck off only by turns, cleaving every
where, both to the implanted, and inflowing Spirits, forced them, as it were
inspired with a madness, to be perpetually exploded, and to grow raging here
and there, by bands: so that indeed, they were not able at all to be ruled;
within the containing parts, but there was need to overthrow, and to tame them,
impetuously tumultuating, and apt to be carried here and there, like a
whirlwinde, by some very violent and strong exercise. In truth in was in this
sick person, as it is in musical Organs, which if filled above measure, by too
great a blast of wind, unless presently the passages of more Pipes be opened,
the whole frame of the Organ is quickly shaken, and in danger to be broken to
pieces: In like manner in this Lady, when the animal Spirits, actuating the
pipes, and the depending fibers, of some of the nerves, were moved beyond their
due tenor, there was a necessity, that their force should be bestowed on many
vehement local motions together, whilst they inslated above measure the nervous
bodies: wherefore, when their madness was hindered in on part, by and by like
wind pent up, creeping somewhere else, it broke forth more violently, in some
other part.

In this sick person, the use of one or two Vomits, brought help once or twice,
because that by it, what was lodged in the gallie-vessell, yea the glandula's
and emunctuories, and also about the viscera of concoction, being by this means
emptied, the purging of the blood, and nervous juce, were more Copiously drawn
into the same place; therefore indeed, that the animal Spirits, flowing within
the Pipes of the distemperd nerves, might be less infected by them: By this
reason also, the juice of the Sows or hog-lice was benefici^l, forasmuch as it
derived the morbifick matter, from the nervous kind, to the urinary passages:
Besides these Remedies, the Root and in a great part the branches of the
morbific matter being cut off, and when others, as it were antidotes, hindering
every where its vegitation, were carefully administered, whatsoever was left of
it, Nature at length becoming superior (as she is wont in these critical
Cases) sent away, to the sinks of the mouth and Throat.

deliquium or sinking down of her Spirits, and insensibility, that she seemed
just a dying: hardly struggling with so great an evil, afterward she had every
day Convulsive fits, though at first at uncertain hours, and returning after a
manifold Kind: But within a short time, its comings being made regular, twice
in a day, to wit, they constantly returned at eleven of the clock, and before
five in the afternoon, that no intermitting feavour, kept more exactly its
periods; yea, also, the same accidents of the fit daily chanced after the same
manner.

When she had thus been sick for three weeks, one day I was sent for, that I
might take notice of all the Symptoms, and the whole figure of the disease: she
being up about ten in the morning, was well, in her Countenance, going, and
speech, she behaved her self exceeding well, so that none would ever suspect
her to be sick: at eleven of the clock, she began to complain of a fullness of
her head, and numbness of Spirits, with a light swimning; by and by she felt a
great pulsation, and as it were the leaping of some live animal, in her left
hypochondrium: putting my hand on her side I plainly perceived this motion;
then a stretching and belching followed, which done, she was presently put to
bed, and a maid siting upon a pillow held her down; who during the fit, most
strictly graspt the sick person, holding her to her bosom, with her arms
foulded about her wast: besides servants were ready, and her relations standing
by, who now pressed down her belly, and hypochondria rising up, and swelling to
a great bulk, now held her hands and arms. The chief Symptoms of the Disease,
which being excited by turns, almost divided the whole fit, were these two,
viz. one while Cruel Convulsions of the Bowels did infest her, so that the
abdomen, rising up into a mighty bulk, strove against the hands of the
bystanders, held upon it, that it could not be pressed down; and at the same
time, her Praecordia, being contracted upwards, the motions of her blood and
heart, were almost stopped: in which space of time, this virgin, her head
falling down, with a small pulse, and almost without voice, lay nigh senseless;
after two or three minutes of an hour, these Convulsions ceased: and then the
sick person, setting her self upright, looked about cheerfully, and for a
while, the force of the disease changed into talking and singing, both of which
she without ceasing performed, most pleasantly and most elegantly, beyond her
proper capacity: with these kind of speeches, and pleasant jeasts, she fell
upon all the standers by, that nothing in a Comedy could be more pleasant; then
she utterd most sweet tunes of music, and more pleasant, than any other could,
or her self at another time: After she had past six or seven minutes of an
hour, thus jesting and singing, the Convulsions of her Bowels and Praecordia,
and the want of speech, came upon her as before: and these soon remitting, the
force of the Spirits leaping back, from the inferior nerves on the brain, it
was lastly employed in the pleasantness of speech and Songs; as often, when she
talked to the bystanders, as any of them replied any thing bitterly or
reproachfully, she fell into those most grievous, and longer continuing,
Convulsions of the Viscera: After this manner, she was wont to be molested,
with an alternate distemper of the Bowels, and brain, about the space of an
hour: Then toward the end of the Viscera, the fit declining, more light
Convulsions being made, they repeated three or four times without any
intermission, then these wholly ceasing, the force of the disease brake forth
into her outward members, from whence it quickly vanished: for her Arms and
Legs, for a minute of an hour, suffered leapings forth, and Contractions;
presently after, the sick person being taken up, left ber bed, free from all
Convulsion, till a new fit returned; yea, indifferently well in strength, she
walked about the house, and during the interval of her distemper, she
cheerfully performed the accustomed Offices of Life, excepting that her stomach
languishings all day she loathed food, in the evening, after the second fit,
she supped moderatly.

This was the present state of the Disease, in whose fits, the more clear use
of some faculties, seemed in a manner to Compensate the irregularity of others:
But about the beginning of her sickness, it was somewhat otherways: for the
Convulsions of her bowels, were far more grievous, and an insensibility was
joined to them: besides, in their intervall, talking idly, an incongruous
singing, yea both laughter and weeping, without any known reason, breaking
forth, were wont to follow one another: but now, the animal Spirits being
forced into longer explosions, performed them so regularly, now this, now that,
as a more Commodious way was made, that they seemed after a manner, to be done
by the Command of the will, and of Reason.

That we may therefore, according to our hypothesis, frame an Aetiology or
rational account of this Distemper; In the first place, it seems, The reasons
of the aforesaid Distemper.
that a vehement fear, did drive the Spirits inhabiting the brain and
Praecordia, into great disorders: so that, they being disturbed out of their
ranks, both the kind of madness or foolishness, and the frequent swooning
succeeded: Further, it may be suspected, that from the same impression, the
hurt was carried to the brain it self, so that its conformation being somewhat
vitiated, the heterogeneous and morbific particles, were admitted together with
the nervous juice: Then, although the spirits at the beginning, being confused
and troubled, after their short inordinations, at last recovered themselves,
and performed the wonted offices both of the animal and vital function; yet by
reason of the taint, impressed on the brain, the heterogeneous particles being
constantly admitted, cleaving to those Spirits, induced explosive endeavors, as
soon as the spirits were filled to a plentitude, with the extraneous Copula,
they being irritated, entered into Convulsive explosions for the shaking or
striking it off.

About the beginning of the Disease, when both the Disposition of the Brain,
and the Spirits inhabiting it, was more perverse, and vicious, from the fresh
received hurt, a fullness of the heterogeneous Copula sooner happened, and so
its explosion following more often, and more inordinately, was dispatched with
greater tumult; But afterward, when the hurt of the animal regiment abating,
the supplements of that Copula, even as thc nervous Liquor, were daily brought
in with an equal dimention, the explosions of the Spirits being made regular,
and more mild, observed their just periods or set times.

That she felt, upon the approach of the fit, a fullness and as it were an
inflation in her head, with an heaviness, and dullness of the spirits, the
Reason is, because at this time, the spirits inhabiting the brain, being now
prepared for explosions, were wont first of all to be moved, and as it were to
swell up; then that pulsation in her left hypochondria succeeded; for that the
Spirits inhabiting the nervous foldings, and fibers, thickly planted about the
Spleen, began to be exploded: afterward, when the Spirits flowing both within
the mesenteric, and Cardiac enfoldings, were exploded rogether, those
elevations, and as it were leapings up of the Abdomen, and Thorax, were
induced: and when in this distemper, the motions of the blood and heart were
almost wholly stopped, therefore there was a small and almost no pulse, and she
became Speechless, and in a manner senseless.

The Convulsion of the Viseera and Praecordia remitting, a prattling and singing
succeeded, because a falling down or removal of the Spirits as yet exploded,
being made from the nervous stock, into the brain, it changed the Convulsions
into an exaltation of the fancy, and more ready exercise of the phantasms, or
Representation of the Imagination: So long as the Spirits, within the middle of
the brain, are regularly and orderly exploded, they bring forth the Acts of the
habits and faculties so much more noble, and as it were above the strength, and
tenor of Nature, as in this sick Gentlewoman: but on the contrary, when the
explosions of the Spirits in that Region, happen to be inordinate, they cause
for the most part foolishness, or at least the exercise of their powers, are
incongruous and absurd.

The Convulsions of the Bowels, and the phantastic actions, releiv'd one
another mutually, and by turns, because plenty of Spirits, being disposed to be
struck off, made their tendency, as it were with a direct and reflected waving
or undulation, now on this part, now on that by turns: then lastly, when they
were almost all exploded, the more often Convulsions of the Viscera were stirred
up; and when a small handful only remained to be exploded, that being at last
excluded, both from the head and bowels, it ran forth into the spinal marrow,
and employed the last assolt of the disease, in the Convulsions af the Arms and
Legs.

There yet remains one great difficulty in this Case, why the fits of this
disease, were always repeated exactly at set hours, and yet had so unequal
periods, to wit, that the Coming of the first, was only but six hours before
the second, and then the return of the next, did not hapen but in 18 hours
space. For the solving of this, it is to be supposed, that these fits did
depend upon the nervous juice being stuffed to a plenitude, with heterogenious
particles: which particles were altogether conveyed thither from the bloody
mass, and the blood did drink up the same, from the nourishing juice, sent as a
supply from the Bowels: These being thus supposed, we must consider, in what
space of time, the bloody mass is filled with those morbific particles, and
then, in what measure, it pours them forth into the nervous Liquor. As to
these, that it may the better appear after what manner it was done, in the case
of this sick person, you must know, that she took in 24. hours space, only at
one time, a full meal: to wit, after the second fit was ended she supped
moderately about 7 of the Clock; the rest of the day wanting an Appetite, she
hardly took any food, therefore it is probable, that the morbific matter, was
poured forth together with the nutritious provision, into the bloody mass,
chiefly in the night time; and that more plentifully, than that all could
presently be derived, into the nervous Liquor: The heterogeneous particles,
which are first conveyed from the blood, newly satisfied, into the nervous
Liquor, being heaped up to the fullness, did excite the first fit, the coming of
which therefore was longer delayed, because both one space is required wherein
the blood, and then another wherein the brain and nerves, are to be filled:
after this fit was over, because the blood yet full, containing in it self more
particles, of the same kind, pours them suddenly on the nervous juice,
therefore the other fit is induced, within thrice the space of the former: but
this being ended, because both the bloody mass, and the nervous juice, are
wholly freed from their burden, the sick person finding her self better, than
at any other time, took her food greedily enough; but after that, when to the
next following fit, first the bloody mass, and then the nervous juice, ought to
be filled with the morbific matter, therefore 10. hours are required for this
double task: but forasmuch, as there is only need, for the second fit, that the
other particles should be derived from the bloody mass, yet full, into the
nervous juice, therefore for this effect, a much less space does suffice, viz.
of 6 hours.

After I had seen this Lady, who had labored for many weeks with these kind
of periodicall fits, I ordered, that three hours before the second fit, The
Curatory Method.
ten ounces of blood, should be taken out of the vein on the foot; which being
done, the coming of the fit, in the evening being expected, quite left her,
neither did it return at all afterward; but the other fit, observing its
former time, daily returned, till the Patient being let blood, a little before
its coming, remained that day free from the disease, which however returning
the day after, according to the same manner, exercised her for many months: In
the mean time, because the cold of the winter was very great, she forbore for
some time the use of remedies: but the spring coming on, this honorable Lady
being brought to Oxford, was Cured by the following method.

First I gave her this Cathartick, and I took care, that it was repeated every
6th. or 7th. day. Take of the Sulphur of Antimony, grains 6, of Mercurius
dulcis 1. scruple, of the Resine of Julap gr. iv. of ginger gr. vi. let them be
beaten together in a mortar, then add of the Conserves of Violets i. dram,
make a bolus: It was wont to provoke two or three vomits, and three or four
stools. The flux of her Terms came constantly in great abundance, at the set
times: wherefore, when the blood seemed very plentiful, and hot, I ordered
phlebotomy twice or thrice in the midst betwixt the times of her Terms:
Besides, every day that she did not purge, she took twice in a day, 4 pills of
the following mass, drinking after them, a little draught of the Julap below
prescribed. Take of the Roots of the male-Paeony, ss. of Virginian snakeweed,
Contrayerva, Cretic Dittany, each i^i. of humane skull, prepared, i ss. of an
Elks claw i. of red Corral prepared, of the powder of Pearls, each i. of the
salt of Wormwood, ii. of the salt of Corrall i. with what will suffice of the
syrrop of the flowers of the male-paeony make a mass.

Take of the water of the flowers of the male-paeony, of black Cherries, and of
Wallnuts, each iiii. of the antiepileptic of Langius, ii. of the syrrop of the
flowers of Paeony, i ss. of Castor tied in a knot, and hung in the glass, i.
mix them, and make a Julap.

When she began to loath the Pills, they being omitted, she took twice a day,
to wit, in the Morning, and the Evening. about one scruple of the following
powder, in a spoonful of Julap, drinking after it 4. or 5. spoonfulls of the
same. Take of Bezar-stone, of either white Amber, of Pearls prepared, of red
Corrall, each i. of humane skull ii. of the root of Virginian snakeweed, and
the seeds of Rue, each ss. mingle them, and make a powder, let her take i.
Morning and Evening, with a dose of the above-prescribed Julap.

Then, when also this medicine began to be tedious to her, she used the pills,
or the Elixir proprietatis, and also sometimes for many days the Spirits of
Hartshorn: At last, she began to be helped, by that powder, being daily taken,
for some space.

In the mean time, whilst this method of healing was ordained; her hair being
shaven from her head, it was covered only with a thin covering: She wore upon
her Belly, an Hysterical plaster mixed with Galbanum: for her ordinary drink,
she took a Bochet of Sarsa, and China, the roots of the male-Paeony, and other
proper things, infused in Spring Water and boiled. Within a month, the Fits
were something remitted: then, being by degrees made gentler and lesser, at
length they almost quite ceased: unless that at the time of her Terms, one or
two fits of the disease was wont to trouble her: Further she labored with an
almost constant giddiness, and queasiness of Stomach; in the middle of the
Summer, she drunk Astrop-waters, for a fortnight, and was perfectly well.

But as for the means in general, to be shown for the Cure, of these admirable
Convulsions it will not be easy to assign, either fit remedies for this
herculean disease, or a certain method of Cure, approved by often experience:
for besides, that these like cases are seldom met with, it is likewise
observed, that the same Medicines which at this time were helpful to this sick
person, being given to another, or to the same, helped nothing at another time:
The reason of which seems to be, because the cause of the Disease consists in
the discrasie, or evil disposition of the nervous juice, which Liquor, is not
always perverted, after one and the same manner: But by the manifold
combination of the salts and Sulphures, it gets a morbid nature of a various
manner and kind, and oftentimes changes it: wherefore, in the most grievious
distempers of this kind, not the vulgar medicines, taken from the shops or
dispensatory, are to be prescribed, but magistralls, as cause arises, according
to the appearances of the admirable Symptoms. A gentle vomit, Purge,
blood-letting, ought in the first place to be ordained, and to be repeated, as
often as shall seem fit. As to specisick medicines also, and appropriate in
these cases, when the chief Indication shall be, to mend the temper of the
Nervous juice, you may try many, and by their effect judge of their virtues:
Therefore it may be lawful, to try, what the Remedies endued with a volatile
or ammoniac salt, may effect. For this end, the spirits and salts, of
Hartshorn, Blood, soot, and the flowers and spirits of Sal-armoniac, are
taken: These helping nothing, you must come to Chalybiats or Steel medicines;
the tinctures and solutions of Coral and Antimony are given: which kind of
medicines are exhibited, in such a dose, and form, and so often, that some
alteration may be made by them, on the whole blood or nervous juce: Further, If
success shall fail in such like, you must then proceed to Alexipharmaca, which
help against poisons, and the malignancy impressed on the humors: to wit, to
institute from these, decoctions, and distilled waters of vegitables, powders,
Conserves, and other preparations; and to compound variously some with others,
and to administer them diversely. It is likely, that those kind of medicines,
which are wont to be helpful to such, as are bitten by a viper, or a mad Dog,
or that have taken woulfs-bane, or poison, may be useful also in the aforesaid
Convulsions. It may be lawful here, according to the example of Gregory
Horstius, in his tract of the malignant Convulsive disease, and also of
wonderful Convulsions, to prescribe magisterial Remedies, in the form of a
purging Electuary, and also of a powder, and Convulsive Antidote, and to
compound them variously, partly of simple Alexipharmacks, or poison resisters,
and partly of Antiepilepticks, or things good against the falling Evil.

CHAPTER. X. Of the Passions Commonly called Hystericall.
THE hysterical passion is of so ill fame, among the Diseases belonging to
women, that like one half damned, it bears the faults of many other Distempers:
For when at any time, a sicknbss happens in a woman's body, of an unusual
manner, or more occult original, so that its Cause lies hid, and the Curatory
Indication is altogether uncertain, presently we accuse the evil influence of
the womb, (which for the most part is innocent) and in every unusual Symptom,
we declare it to be something hysterical, and so to this Scope, which
oftentimes is only the subterfuge of Ignorance, the medical Intentions, and use
of Remedies are directed.

A description of the hysterical passion.
The Passions, which are wont to be referred to this cense or order, are found
to be various and manifold; which rarely happen in diverse women, or which come
wholly after the same manner: The most Common, and which commonly are said to
constitute the formal Reason of the hysterical distemper, are these, viz. A
motion in the bottom of the belly, and an ascension of the same, as it were a
certain round thing, then a belching, or a striving to vomit, a distention, and
murmur of the hypoehondria, with a breaking forth of blasts of wind; an
unequal breathing, and very much hindered, a choking in the throat, a vertigo,
an inversion, or rolling about of the eyes, oftentimes laughing, or weeping,
absurd talking, sometimes want of speech, and motionless, with an obscure or no
pulse, and deadish aspect, sometimes Convulsive motions, in the face and Limbs,
and sometimes in the whole body, are excited: But universal Convulsions rarely
happen, and not unless this disease be in the very worst state: Because, for
the most part, the Tragedy of the Fit is acted without Contraction of the
members, only in the inferior belly, Thorax, and head, to wit, in some of them,
or successively in all: women of every age, and Condition, are obnoxious to
these kind of Distempers, to wit, Rich and poor, Virgins, wives, and widows:
I have observed those Symptoms in maids before ripe age, also in old women
after their flowers have left them; yea, sometimes the same kind of Passions
infest men, as plainly appeared by the example already showed.

As to the causes of those symptoms, most ancient, The causes of the Symptoms
inquired into.
and indeed Modern Physicians, refer them to the ascent of the womb, and
vapors elevated from it: The former opinion, although it plead antiquity,
seems the less probable, for that the body of the womb is of so small bulk, in
virgins, and widows, and is so strictly tied by the neighboring parts round
about, that it cannot of it self be moved, or asccnd from its place, nor could
its motion be felt, if there were any: as to that vulgar opinion, or Reason
taken from the vapors, we have often rejected it as wholly vain, and light,
for just reasons elsewhere: But we judge, the passions but now described, do
neither always, nor at all proceed from the ascent, or the vapors of the womb:
and that indeed, other very famous Physicians, have already determined: For in
times past. Charles Piso, and of late the most learned Highmore, have
vindicated the womb from all fault; and the passions, which are commonly called
hystericall, are thought by this latter to arise from the blood, most
impetuously rushing on the Lungs; and by the other, from a serous colluives
heaped together near the origin of the Nerves. How probable this latter opinion
does seem, shall appear from what follows: But as to the opinion delivered by
Doctor Highmore, concerning this thing, tho it be far from our Custom to
contradict any ones opinion, and that it is almost unlawful for me, to diffent
from this famous man; yet, because our Pathologie standing on a contrary basis,
(viz. the cause of the hystericall distemper being imputed more immediately to
the nervous stock, than to the blood) will seem to be only asserted, unless we
show the Reasons, which combat against that hypothesis, and forours, therefore
taking leave, here we will try more exactly either opinion, put as it were in a
balance.

In the fit therefore commonly called hysterical, this famous man supposes,
Doctor Highmores Opinion Examined.
the blood, for that it is thin, flatulent, and with a certain effervescency,
to rush too much in heaps, into the pneumonick vessels, and the vessels of
the heart, and in them to broyl up impetuously, and so to stuff up the lungs,
and very much to aggravate them, that neither they can exercise their motion,
nor that the blood can be drained from the bosom of the heart: Hence, from the
blood stagnating in the Praeoordia, a great oppression, difficult breathing,
and often none, with a melting of the vital Spirits were wont to be inferred:
then the diaphragma, that it might give place to the Lungs more and more
distended, and that breathing at least might be some way made, is carried
downward, with a mighty and long continued Diastole, and so by pressing down
the Intestines, it lifts up the ahdomen, and hypochondria, and feins a motion
as it were the arising of a globe: But afterward, the vital function laboring
after this manner, the animal faculty arises in its aid, wherefore, a
necessity of motions, in various parts urging the animal Spirits, being driven
impetuously into the beginnings of the nerves, produce diverse manners of
Convulsions, running here and there. The Author endeavors to confirm this
Opinion, by the great help in this disease had, by the taking away the bloody
excretion, both from things helpful, and things hurtful, in this paffion.

But though I cannot but praise this Doctrine of the suffocation of the womb,
as very ingenious, and cunningly wrought, yet that I do not consent to it in
all things, some reasons of great moment clearly hinder me. Truly I confess,
that I do not understand, how in some hysterical persons, to wit, who are of a
more frigid temperament, and are often troubled with the Pica, and longing
disease; the blood should so immoderatly boil up in the Lungs, without any
conspicuous notes of its growing hot, in some other place. I have known young
maids, by reason of the green sickness, as it were without blood, to wit, whose
blood indeed being without life, did remain without any exercise in the heart,
and was from thence diffic^ltly enough drawn forth, into the Lungs, who yet
were grievously obnoxious to the passions called hysterical: Certainly it is
not probable, that the blood of these persons growing immoderatly hot, should
rush impetuously into the Pneumonick vessels, and should stuff up their pores
and passages very thickly, when in the mean time, such become short-breathed,
by reason of the absence of the blood from the Lungs, or its difficult
admission to them: Besides, by what means comes it to pass, that this violent
course of the blood into the Lungs, which is supposed to be made in this Fit,
brings forth no Inflammation in them? for that the blood, being too much
heaped, or rapidly put into any part, is easily extravasated, and is wont to
excite an Inflammation hardly to be shaken off. From whence it is therefore, in
the hysterical distemper, the blood entering violently into the Lungs, and
distending them, does not cause a peripneumonie or impostume of the Lungs? Or
wherefore the distempers as it were hysterical, come not on an Inflammation of
the Lungs, otherwise caused? wherefore it seems improbable, that the blood
swelling up, with its proper anger or heat, should rush into the Lungs, and by
stuffing them, renders them too immovable, and so secondarily and consequently
induce Convulsions of the Diaphragma, and other parts: but it may rather seem,
that by reason of the Diaphragma, and other organs of breathing, being first
affected with a Convulsion, the blood should be forced to stagnate in the
praecordia: Besides, it may be observed, that the Lungs are not always
afflicted before other parts; for oftentimes the convulsive Symptoms begin
elsewhere, and not rarely bear the region of the breast wholly untouched:
Because in some, the vertigo, and Corruscations or sparklings of the eyes,
begin the fit, to which succeed either weeping, or laughing, or convulsive
motions of the Limbs, without any straitness of the breath, or oppression of
the heart: in others, before respiration troubles them, any way, a swelling in
the bottom of the belly, with a vomiting, and rumbling of the belly, begins and
often ends the fit; so that the difficulty of breathing, oftentimes follows
these Symptoms at a great distance, and is wont to be prevented, by the tying
strictly of swathing-bands, about the hypochondria. Moveover, it seems, that
this ascent as it were of a certain round thing, from the Hypogastrium or lower
part of the belly, can never proceed from the depression of the Diaphragma;
because in the hysterical fit, this part is not always pressed down toward the
lower parts, but oftentimes drawn up to the higher parts, and drives the Lungs
upwards, so that the spirit or breath being almost shut forth, threatens the
danger of Choking. By these, and other reasons, The hystericall distemper
chiefly belongs to the Brain and nervous stock.
we are at length persuaded to that opinion, that the distemper named from the
womb, is chiefly and primarily convulsive, and chiefly depends on the brain and
the nervous stock being affected, and whatever inordination, or irregularity
from thence happens, about the motion of the blood, is only secondary, and is
made dependingly, by the Convulsions of the Bowels.

But that this does consist within the bounds of the head, both the comparing
of the symptoms, which happen in the living, and the anatomical observations of
the dead, clearly show; because we may observe, that this distemper often takes
its rise, from a sudden fear, great sadness, or anger, or other violent
passion, in which the spirits inhabiting the brain are chiefly affected
besides, to some an ill manner of diet, and various accidents whereby the
humors being vitiated, are heaped more plentifully within the head, at first
brings this evil. Yea, the manner of the fits clearly evinces the same,
forasmuch, as a fullness of the head, a vertigo, a sparkling of the eyes, a
ringing noise of the ears, begin in many the hysterical fit, and often conclude
it: Besides I have opened some women, dead of other diseases, tho while they
were sick, very obnoxious to hysterical passions, in whom the womb being very
well, I have found in the hinder part of the head, the beginnings of the
nerves, moistened and wholly drowned with a sharp serum, as shall be more
largely declared anon.

Having weighed these, and other Reasons, we doubt not to assert, the Passions
commonly called Hysterical, to arise most often, for that the animal spirits,
possessing the beginning of the Nerves within the head, are infected with some
taint; to wit, they being either acted or brought into Confusion, or being
tincted with vicious humors, get to themselves an heterogeneous and explosive
Copula, The cause of the disease, most often begins, about the beginnings of
the nerves.
which they carry far away with themselves, into the Channells of the nerves:
and when the same spirits are filled to a plenitude, with that Copula, through
all their series or orders, either of their own accord, or being occasionally
moved, they enter into explosions, and so stir up Convulsive motions: But that
such a Copula adhering to the spirits, is chiefly derived together with them,
into the interior nerves, the reason is, because in this passage toward the
praecordia, and viscera, the animal spirits, by reason of the distemper of the
mind, are very much disturbed; wherefore, they more easily admit any evils
brought from another place, and more readily conceive irregularities. For the
animal spirits, chiefly for this occasion, contract a convulsive disposition:
forasmuch as they, from a violent impression, are perverted out of their
Courses, and their wonted manner of Influence, and acting; hence they not only
repeat their inordinations, but also receive the heterogenious particles into
their embraces, and more easily combine with them: Wherefore, forasmuch as the
animal spirits, running through the nerves of the wandering pair, and
Intercostals, are continually entangled with all perturbations both of the
Concupiscable, and irascible Appetite, it is no wonder, if they acquire a
convulsive disposition, before the rest.

It being supposed (which indeed ought to be supposed) that the animal spirits
have contracted an heterogenious and explosive Copula, The same cause
afterward disposed, through the whole passage of the Nerves.
now the nervous origines, and carried it together with it self into the
interior nerves, and spread it through all their passages, it will not be hard
to assign the Reasons of the hystericall fit, and of all its Symptoms. For
first of all, the disease being ready to fall upon one, oftentimes the Vertigo,
a rolling about of the eyes, and a certain inflation of the brain, as it were
praevious skirmishings, are stirred up, because the whole band of the Spirits,
being in readiness for explosions, the more light companies of them, leaping
back toward the brain, are first struck off; then Presently a perturbation
succeeds, in the bottom of the belly, or hypochondria, for that the Spirits
within the enfoldings here and there, are next disturbed: For we have elsewhere
shown, if at any time the animal Spirits are exploded, in a certain whole
Series, those which abode in the extreme parts, first of all enter into that
assertion: Wherefore the beginnings of this Disease, are found to be or the
most Part, in the head and Bowels: but that the Convulsions are first
perceived, now in the bottom of the belly, now in the hypochondria, the reason
is, because the morbific matter, is sometimes carried by the passage of the
intercostal nerve, into the utmost mesenteric enfoldings; but sometimes the
same, being slid down, not beyond the ends of the wandering pair, subsists much
nearer, to wit, about the enfoldings of the spleen, or stomach.

When therefore the animal Spirits (as has been shown) within the nervs of the
wandering pair, and intercostals, are imbued from their origin, The reason of
the hysterical symptoms unfolded.
even to their utmost ends, with an heterogeneous and explosive Copula; they at
length, either from mere fullness, or by an irritation somewhere made, are
stirred up to explosions; in which affection, if any Spirits leap forth toward
the middle of the brain, they induce the Vertigo, the inflation and other
praevious accidents of the head: but the Spirits inhabiting the other extremity
of the nervous Trunk, viz. the mesenteric enfoldings begin chiefly to be
exploded, which presently by their letting off, compel the lower Parts of the
hypogastrum to be lifted up, and contracted upwards, and so induce the
ascension of a certain bulk, as it were of the womb: then, when the upper parts
of the enfoldings of the mesentory, are by degrees entangled with the same
distemper, and the bowels annexed to the same are elevated, and drawn
forceably toward the upper parts, the violent swelling of the Abdomen, as it
were with a certain leaping forth succeeds: Further, the Ventricle is not only
elevated, by changing its place, all its fibers, to wit, the direct, oblique,
and transverse, being affected at once, with the Convulsion, is often distended
like a blown bladder: hence very often vomiting, or at least a rumbling, and
murmur of the hypochondria, are excited: but as soon as the Spirits being
exploded, with a certain series, it comes to the Region of the Thorax, the
diaphragma being drawn together, with an huge diastole is sometimes depressed,
and so meeting with the ascension of the viscera, causes an Inflation, and high
intumescency or swelling up, with a mighty struggling; so that the laces of
those in this distemper, must be forthwith loosned, or else they are in danger
of falling into a trance: In the mean time, the Diaphragma being so depressed,
and its diastole continued, the blood remains almost immovable in the
praecordia: and so by its stagnation, causes a great oppression, and very often
a fa^ling of the vital function: Further, the Convulsion of the Diaphragma,
happens sometimes toward the upper parts, and so, that driving the Lungs
upwards induces a violent Systole, and protracted longer than it should be; and
when by this means, the blood is driven forward, into the pneumonic vessels,
and is not at last received from the bosom of the heart, it stagnates there,
and besides in the whole Body; from whence the oppression of the heart, and
oftentimes a swooning, yea sometimes a want of speech, and motion, now with a
blewness of the face, and now with a dead aspect follow: After these things are
acted in the lower, and middle Region, at length the distemper reaches to the
head, by the passage of the nerves, as it were a fiery inkindling, and the
spirits being there exploded leaping now toward the middle of the brain,
produce a swimming in the head. and often symptoms very like the Epilepsy;
sometimes the spirits there exploded, rush into the beginnings of the other
Nerves, and there stir up the like explosions; wherefore, hysterical people,
toward the end of the fit, often Laugh, or weep, or talk Idly; sometimes the
parts of the face, and mouth, yea, sometimes the arms, and other members, are
troubled with convulsive motions, and so, when at length all the spirits, which
had contracted an heterogeneous Copula, are exploded, the fit ends; but
presently after, matter for another fit, begins to be gathered together.

From whence the diversity of the symptoms happens.
It sometimes happens, that the convusive disposition is not drawn out so long,
and largely, for besides that oftentimes the nerves only of the wandering pair,
and the intercostalls are troubled with it, that neither the brain, nor the
outward members, are at all molested; yea sometime, neither the interior nerves
themselves, are possessed with the morbific cause, through their whole
processes: for the convulsive Disposition (as we but now intimated) oftentimes
arrives not beyond the enfoldings of the spleen, or stomach, and then the fit
beginning from the inflation of the ventricle, or left hypochondrium, is
thought to arise, not from the fault of the womb, but of the spleen: which
kind of distemper, by and by being brought to the Thorax, and there involving
the Diaphragma, and Lungs, with a Convulsion, stops respiration, and the motion
of the heart, or in some manner perverts it: but then from thence, the fit
passes over; now with, and now without a great perturbation of the Head. These
things happen indeed after a various manner, according as it happens, that the
morbific matter, or explosive Copula, descending from the head, is gathered
together, as it were heaps of gunpowder, more or less, now in this, now in
that part! But concerning which matter, by what means, the same being brought
forth in the head, first affects the beginnings of the nerves, and so
constitutes the procatartick, or more remote Cause of the passion called
Hysterical, now remains next to be inquired into.

The more remote Cause of the disea^e su^, either neph^ beg^ings of the Nerves.
As to the morbific matter or explosive Copula, which cleaving to the spirits,
flowing within the head, and with them derived into the nervous passages, is
often the cause of the distempers, commonly termed of the Womb; we say, that
this, as in other kinds of Convulsions, is the heterogeneous particles, poured
forth from the blood, which yet are wont to be affixed to the spirits, flowing
into the beginnings of the nerves, chiefly for two causes: to wit, either by
the fault of the spirits themselves, or by the force of the matter it self,
instances of either kind, are ordinarily met with. It sometimes happens, that
the animal spirits, planted within the brain, and in the passage leading from
it, to the praecordia, are very much disturbed, by a sudden passion, as of
fear, anger, sadness, etc. And forced into disorders; and that by that means,
they being driven out of their orders, do acquire to themselves heterogeneous
particles, wherever met with; and combine with these, that by and by, for that
reason, they acquire an explosive disposition, as we have already declared.
Further in the second place, sometimes the morbific matter it self, being made
more fierce and strong, in spite of the succor of the animal Aeconomie or
rule, is poured forth into the brain, and its appendix, from the bloody mass,
which cleaving fast to the spirits, presently disposes them into explosions:
This is ordinarily discerned in the evil crises of feavours, also in some
malignant distempers, also in Scorbutic and other Chronical diseases ill cured.
An ill, or weak constitution of the brain, or nervous stock, whether it be
hereditarie, or acquired by reason of an ill manner of living, very much
cherishes these causes. For in bodies so disposed, both the animal spirits,
from every light occasion, are moved in Confusion; and the passages of the
brain, and nervous System, more easily lie open, for the running in of the
heterogeneous, and explosive matter. In truth, for this reason, women are more
obnoxious to convulsive distempers, than men, and some women then others, as we
will show more largely hereafter.

But although these kind of passions of women, called hysterical, most often
proceed from the fault of the head, or from the morbific cause, arising within
the Encephalon; yet sometimes, such distempers are stirred up, Or near the
womb, or other Inwards.
by reason of a Cause beginning somewhere else, viz. Now in the womb, now in
the other Bowels; and of this Convulsive Pathologie, there are chiefly two
heads, viz.

1st. Sometimes it happens, that a Tumor, or an ulcer, This last happens after
a twofold manner.
or a congestion of sharp humors, arises in the membranous parts, about the
womb, or planted about the other Viscera, and often irritates the parts so
distempered, by reason of the breaking of the union, into painful Convulsions:
then forasmuch as the animal spirits, placed round about, and those inflowing,
Either by reason of the dissolution of the union.
are moved into frequent disorders, they at length, getting to themseves
heterogeneous particles, sent either from the distempered part, or from some
other place, are disposed to convulsive assaults, and when first of all, the
convulsive motions happen only in the neighborhood of the affected place, to
wit, that the bulk ascending in the lower part of the belly, or its swelling up
be only perceived; afterward they are propagated by the passage of the nervous
bodies, and by the consent of the convulsion there begun, leasurely into the
other viscera, of the lower belly, then to the praecordia, and lastly into the
head it self; and the distemper, being thus by little and little delated to the
spirits inhabiting the brain, they moreover having gotten in their proper
Sphere, an heterogeneous Copula, retort the same back to the viscera, and so
the morbific cause, being made reciprocal, is begun at either end of the
nervous Trunk. Some time past I have seen a noble virgin, in whom a small
Tumor arising, with most cruel pain, below the Os pubis, did stir up huge
Convulsions; first in the lower belly, and afterward ascending to the
Praecordia, and head, were at length stretched to the outward members: for once
or twice in a day, after that great pains did torment her in the affected part,
the abdomen, and by and by the hypochondria, were wont to be lifted up: then
difficulty of breathing, on an Insensibility succeeded, and presently the
distemper being brought outwardly, most horrid Convulsions, and Contractions of
the members, and Limbs followed. Sometimes it also happens, that convulsive
symptoms are induced in Childbearing women, by reason of some hurt or evil
brought to the womb: Harvie Relates, that wonderful convulsions were caused by
the injection of some sharp thing into the womb: So sometimes, tho rarely, it
happens, that a morbific matter or explosive Copula is fixed to the spirits
dwelling about the extremities of the nerves and near the womb, immediately
from the place there affected and without fault of the brain.

There yet remains another case, or manner of affecting, 2. Or by reason of an
obstruction of the Nervous juice.
by which the convulsive disposition is produced from the fault or the parts,
lodged at a great distance from the brain (tho in the mean time, the taint,
which is the cause of this distemper, is often mediately communicated to the
brain it self) to wit, when at any time, the nervous juice is hindered
somewhere, in its motion or circulation, from thence stagnating in the nervous
parts, and loading them, does often bring in a convulsive disposition: So, when
some usual Evacuation, whereby the superfluities of the nervous Liquor, were
wont to be sifted forth, is stopped, as from Issues suddenly shut up, or old
ulcers dried up without a purge, many fall into convulsive distempers: Yea, it
may obtain here some place, what is wont commonly to be noted for a cause, of
the hysterical passions, in maids and widows, to wit, the untimely restraint
of the seminall humor, which ought to be bestowed about the pleasure of Venus;
at least, if they receive help from the state of a conjugal Life, it therefore
happens, because the restagnations of the nervous humor, which often fix a
taint to the brain and nervous stock, by this means are prevented: Moreover,
the nervous juice flows back toward its beginning, because its passage is
somewhere shut up, by a swelling or cancrous Tumor. Lastly in this City, a
notable instance of this kind of distemper happened, viz. A certain maid of 12.
years of age, had contracted an hernia or burstness, hence by the order of her
Mother, she wore a truss ill fitted, for a fortnight, not without great pain
and torment, a little hard knot much pressing upon the glandulas of the Groin:
within this space (when before she was perfectly well) she began to complain of
a giddiness and heavy dullness of her head; and so a little after, she felt
convulsive, and as it were hysterical distempers, frequently salling upon her;
rogether with it great swellings arose behind her ears, and in her neck of the
same side, to which she was never before obnoxious in all her life. It is not
to be doubted in this case, but that from those Glandulas, which are the
Emunctuaries, or sinks of the nervous Liquor, being too much pressed together,
the superfluities of that humor, wont to be sent away from thence, by the
Lymphatic vessels, restagnating in the head, brought forth those evils:
because the arising of the aforesaid symptoms, so suddenly and manifestly
followed, upon the wearing of that Truss upon the Groin, that even her Mother
laid the cause of the Disease, upon that occasion. Besides also I have observed
in others, the recrements of the nervous humor, being somewhere stopped in
their Course, restagnating toward the head, have not only brought in
convulsive symptoms, but from thence the Kings Evil.

Objections against the aforesaid hypothesis answered.
So much for the formal Reason, of the different original of the distemper,
called hysterical; as also of the genuine Causes, of its symptoms: Out of
which, it seems to appear plainly, that those passions, do not depend always on
the womb, but much more often, on the fault of the brain, and of other parts of
the nervous stock: But many things are objected against these, which according
to the old opinion, cast all the blame on the womb: To wit, it seems so to be
done because the assault of this disease invades almost only women; yea and
women that are not well about their womb, viz. Childbearing women, or such who
have their courses stopped, are chiefly obnoxious to it: Besides it may be argued
from things helpful for it, because a plaster worn upon the lower part of the
belly, also a strict girding of the belly, and hypochondria, by which the
ascent of the womb may be hindered, do not seldom drive away the fit, just
falling on them; this also shows it, that sweet things held to the nose brings
on the fit, and stinking things drive the same away, it is said to happen quite
contrary, if the same things be laid to the belly, or privy member.

That we may wipe off these objections, we say first, that the symptoms, which
seem hysterical, do not only happen to women: for we have shown already, by the
history brought by us, that a certain man has been obnoxious to those kind of
fits, with the ascension of a bulk in the bottom of the belly: but that women
are much more often troubled with those convulsive diseases than men, two
reasons may be shown, viz. First, for that their animal constitution is much
weaker: to wit, they have the brain and nerves softer, and of a less firm
texture, that they are not able to suffer any thing strongly, or to resist
every injury; also the animal spirits in them, being more prone to flight and
distraction, more easily admit an heterogeneous and explosive Copula: from
hence Women, from any sudden terror or great sadness, fall into mighty disorder
of spirits, when men from the same occasion, are scarcely disturbed at all.
Secondly, women more readily receive the convulsive disposition, because they
gather a more plentiful heap of the morbific matter: for that, whilst they
lead for the most part a sedentary Life, the blood, for want of ventilation,
becomes more impure; besides in this sex it originally abounds with
heterogeneous and fermentative particles; wherefore it is convenient for it, to
be more often purged, by the flux of their Courses; by which notwithstanding,
not always what is extraneous, and incongruous, is wholly cast forth, from the
bloody Mass, but that there remains, that which being poured on the brain, and
its appendix, as occasion is given, becomes the cause of the convulsive
distemper: Moreover, when the menstrual flux, being stopped, a convulsive
disposition is occasioned, it is not therefore to be thought, that such a
distemper is raised up from the womb, but that the bloody mass, being more than
usually imbued, with heterogeneous particles, carries them, together with the
nervous juice, to the head: yea, chiefly for this reason also, childbearing
women, are found obnoxious to the passions, as it were hysterical, for besides
that the membranes of the womb being hurt, a convulsion there begun, by reason
of the felt trouble, creeps upwards and is at last communicated to the head; it
most often happens, that the blood being infected, by the terms being
retained, grows hot with a feavourish burning, and then instead of a crisis,
the malignant infection, is carried to the brain, from whence convulsive, and
not seldom soporiferous, or sleepy distempers, are excited.

But that it is argued, that this disease seems to be hysterical, because
Remedies applied about the abdomen, often bring help; it will be easy to show,
that the morbific cause planted in the mesentery, oftener than in the womb, is
sometimes either taken away by that means, or restrained from its Influence:
besides, the same kind of applications, about the hypogastrium, are no less
profitable, although the original of the distemper, be derived from the head it
self: for we have shown before, that when the heterogeneous, and explosive
matter, descending from the head, brings a convulsive disposition, to the
spirits disposed within the whole processes of the interior nerves; the
convulsive motions therefore excited, begin from the extremities of the nerves,
and so creep upwards toward their beginnings; so that first of all the viscera
of the lower belly, then the praecordia, and lastly the brain it self are
affected; but if the outmost spirits, viz. those dwelling in the enfoldings of
the mesentery, be restrained from entering into explosions, all the rest, in the
remaining nervous passage, continue in their orders: and this, plasters worn
upon the navel, do often effect: for they repress, and compel into order, with
their odor, the spirits from leaping forth; yea also, not seldom, they shake
off and drive away; the Copula cleaving to them: wherefore, when the explosions
there about to be made, are restrained, the convulsive fit is wholly prevented:
which yet is more apparent, for that, if the Convulsion begun in the lower
belly, and from thence ascending like a Globe, be presently suppressed, and by
a strong binding together of those parts, it be hindered that it creep not
upwards, oftentimes the convulsive passion is broken off, the praecordia, and
the brain being untouched: wherefore it is a common custom, for sick women, to
bind strictly the Epigastrium, with swaths or rolers, and so to stop the
progress of the symptoms, toward the upper parts: For when the animal spirits,
enter into Convulsions successively, as it were a fiery enkindling, wherever
the tinder, or cherishing matter is cut off, or intercepted, the distemper is
there restrained.

As to the various effects of odors, to wit, that sweet things bring on the
fit, but stinking things drive the same away, it may be said, that the former
do loosen the animal spirits, by pleasing them, and too much release them from
their wonted tasks of Influence, and so provoke them ready to be exploded, in
such disorders, yea and as a flame put to them, do somewhat inkindle them: but
on the contrary, stinking things repress the spirits, drive them back from
excursions, and exorbitances, and compel them into order, yea like sulphur,
mixed with aurum fulminans, take away from them their explosive force.

What we have hitherto said, of the passions called from the womb hysterical,
will yet more clearly appear, if for the Confirmation of our Hypothesis, we
shall add arguments taken from anatomical observations; I will therefore lay
before you a notable Case, by which the former reason, and Causes of the
convulsive distempers, may be very much illustrated.

A very noble Lady of a most curious shape, Observations.
and highly endued with a virtuous disposition, of mind and manners, of late
lived near to this place, who being for many years obnoxious to convulsive
distempers, for that she had originally, or hereditarily contracted this sickly
disposition, and had experienced the fruits of this morbid seed, almost every
luster of her age, but chiefly as often as she was with child, (for she very
frequently miscarried) was wont to be tormented above measure, with convulsive
passions, as it were hysterical; because, presently after the restraint of her
monthly flowers, the heterogeneous particles being translated to the brain and
nervous stock, caused fits of this most cruel distemper.

After she had newly conceived, in the first months, according to her old
custom, she was presently molested with convulsive distempers; about the nineth
week of her big belly, from taking cold, she fell into a dangerous feavour, in
which very acute pains tormenting her, in her loins and bottom of her belly,
for many days, seemed to threaten an abortion: but these pains, as the event
showed, rather to be termed Colical, proceeded from a sharp humor, falling
down into those parts, from the brain, by the pipes of the nerves; for toward
the declining of the feavour, this matter being somewhere else translated, a
great looseness or Diarrhaea, pains of the feet, and as it were an ulcerous
disposition succeeded.

As soon as this Lady became well from her feavour, and those pains, the
convulsive distempers returned, for every morning, wakeing from sleep, she was
wont to suffer Convulsions, and cruel contractions, about the parts of her face
and mouth, as also in her arms and thighs; which symptoms, without doubt, did
arise from a serous heap or gathering, laid up in the head, about the
beginnings of the nerves; and by them imbibed, together with the nervous juice,
more deeply in sleep; and when afterward the same matter, was carried by the
pipe of the interior nerves, into the foldings of the Mesentery, and loins,
most cruel pains of those parts, and also fits as it were hysterical, did most
grievously infect her.

But these convulsive motions of her face and members, after a little time
ceased, but yet she still remained weak, and without strength, with a pale
countenance, an infirm and trembling gate, and desirous only of congruous food,
and hot Liquors: about the end of the third month, at which time she was wont
continually to miscarry, her menstrua broke forth, which coming away for two or
three days together, with little pieces of broken membranes, she expected to
miscarry: But that flux ceasing, pains as it were of one in labor, in her
abdomen and loins, as before arose, and for the space of a week, tormented her
day and night; at length, having used a bath of Emollient herbs, and afterward
put to bed to sweat, she brought forth the burden of her womb: the conception
so coming away with mighty pain, was about the bigness, and like the figure of
a Turkey egg: the exterior coat of it was torn and broken, the interior
remaining whole, contained about half a pint of clear water and nothing else
besides; there appeared no shape of a child, or any rudiments that it would
ever be one: Afterward for 4. or 5. days, her flowers flowed forth, with some
pieces of broken membrances: in the mean time, pains with their wonted
fierceness tormented her, and when the space of a week being elapsed, they left
not off of themselves, remedies at length were sought to allay them.

To this end, first Liniments, Fomentations, Baths, and Clysters, were often
administered; also medicines purging the filth of the womb, on which the cause
of all the evil was cast, were taken inwardly: Short intermissions of her
tortures, followed upon the use of the former; but then the distemper returned,
with great trouble; yea the disease much increasing, in three weeks time, got
many other horrid symptoms: for besides the pains in her belly and loins, which
became more cruel every day, also she was shortly after tormented in her back,
neck, shoulders, as also in her arms and thighs, with most cruel pain; and
that more bitterly, as soon as she was warm in her bed; besides, she was
afflicted with a frequent giddiness, vomiting, and nauseousness, and often in a
day, with most grievous convulsive fits, viz. First a bulk was seen to ascend
in the bottom of her belly, and presently it lifted up her whole belly
forceably, by and by respiration being restrained, an Insensibility, with a
dead countenance succeeded: after that, she had thus lain as one dead, for
three or four minutes of an hour, she was wont suddenly to leap up, that she
could hardly be held down, or kept by those standing by; then followed cruel
contractions, and distortions in all the parts of the mouth, and face, as also
in all the members of the body: These symptoms were indeed judged to be
hysterical, because this noble Lady so lately had miscarried.

But weighing every one of these, I was at last of this opinion, that the cause
of either fit, viz. Both the dolorifick, and the convulsive, did depend wholly
on the evil affection of the brain, and nervous stock, and that without any
fault of the womb; for that a sharp humor, being heaped up within the head,
did from thence descend through the passages of the Nerves, into parts at a
great distance; which lodging upon the membranes and fibers, and fermenting
with the humor, flowing in from the bloody mass, did irritate them very much,
and so stirred up most cruel pains: Then afterward, when the heterogeneous and
explosive particles, being admitted with what humor within the head, and
entering into the nervous passages, did cleave to the spirits; therefore the
convulsive disposition, then breaking forth into grievous fits, was induced, as
shall be by and by more largely laid open.

Instituting Curatory Intentions, according to this kind of Aetiology, I
ordered to have blood taken from this sick Lady, at what time she most
grievously labored, out of the Saphena vein, and within two days, to be given
her a gentle Cathartick, and that to be reiterated, once or twice in a week:
Also on other days, Morning and Evening, I gave her spirits of Hartshorn, and
at other hours, twice or thrice in a day, of the powder of Pearls and
Crab's-eyes, with a dose of the following Julap. Take of the water of Snails,
and of worms magisterial each iii. of Saxifrage, and black cherries each iiii.
of hysterical water ii. of the syrrop of Corralls i ss. of the tincture of
Costor i. mingle them: The bath of sweet herbs was frequently used, when
necessity urged, she took Opiats always with good success: Vesicatories were
applied to the inward part of either thigh, also to the hinder part of her
neck; also Fomentations, Ointments, Clysters, Cuping-glasses, Sneezing-powders,
with many other manner of administrations were prescribed, according to the
exigences of the symptoms.

By this method observed for about 14. days, the noble Lady having received
very much ease, was wholly rid of her convulsive fits. Yea, the torments of her
Bowels and members, and the other symptoms being very much lessened, she hoped
quickly to recover her health: But after this, partly by reason of an ill order
of diet, which the sick Lady always indulged her self in, or taking little, but
chiefly, by reason of a sudden passion of fear and sadness, which an unluckie
accident happening within her own house, had caused, she fell into a relaps, by
and by the disease growing into a much worse Condition, for both the
Convulsions, and pains, did infest her more bitterly; yea and her stomach being
almost tired out, with continual vomiting, would not admit either of food or
medicines. She took Asses milk for some days, with some success; which
notwithstanding, for as much as breeding Choler in her stomach, she found it
troublesome, she shortly omitted: at length in spite of all Remedies,
prescribed carefully by the Consultation of many Physicians, my noble patient
from day to day grew worse, and by degrees death approached: Two days before
her death, the torments of her belly and loins very much abated, and she became
more than usually cheerful, and conceived some hope of Recovery; But in the
mean time she complained of a pain and great heavyness in her head; and about
the beginning of the night she selpt foundly, but being awakened she fell into
a very horrid convulsive fit, which presently passed into a quick deadly
Apoplexy, for being made insensible, and speechless, she left this life within
twelve hours.

When various judgments had passed, about the cause of the sickness, The
rational account of the disease taken from anatomical Observations.
of which this illustrious Lady dyed, most flinging all the evils on the
distemper of the womb, others on an Ulcer or Imposthum, which they suspected
lay hid, somewhere about the viscera of the abdomen; it pleased her friends,
that her dead Carcass, kept long opened for the Funeral, should be dilligently
inspected, and so the genuine Causes of the disease, and her death, might be
investigated; which task being left to my care, I executed with all the
diligence I was able.

Therefore in the first place, it was worth observation, about the habit of the
body, that the members and lower parts, nigh and beyond the seats of the pains,
were very much wasted; as her thighs, quite worn away, appeared like a
Skelliton: In the mean time, her face, neck, and arms, remained full, and plump
enough: from whence it appears, that the nervous Liquor, does help no less to
the business of nourishment, than to the exercise of the animal faculty:
wherefore, when that Liquor, being much hindered in its passage, the loins and
belly, taken up with the continual Convulsions, did not descend, with a due
influx, to the inferior parts, they for that reason, became presently both
without strength, and lean, and wasted. This kind of Atrophie, differs in
this, from other hectical wasting, which happens from the vice of the blood,
because in this latter, an hippocratick or wanish face, is the chief sign of
the Disease, in that first mentioned, the countenance, and aspect, show little
or nothing of evil.

The dead body of this noble Lady, tho very lean, and that her bowels were all
the emptied, yet quickly putrified, for within 40. hours all the skin was
discolored, and appeared in this part livid, in that green, and in others
blackish; and her Corpse so suddenly putryfying, yielded a most horrid smell,
the reason of which without doubt was, that by reason the muscles were
exercised with perpetual Convulsions, the principles of their mixture, were so
much loosned, that they being in a readiness for dissolution, quickly after
death, fell asunder one from another, after the like manner, as we may observe
of the flesh of wild beasts, which being tired with a long course, or beaten
to death with Clubs, for this much sooner putrifies, then the flesh of those,
which are killed quickly, and peaceably.

Her belly being opened, the Intestines, and ventricle appeared whole enough,
viz. Entire and well colored, but they were empty, and as it were blown up,
for as much as they were troubled, almost with perpetual evacuations, viz.
Those placed above or below: in all this Cavity, no foot steps of an Ulcer, or
Imposthum were perceived. Whilst we were searching the cause of the disease,
and rolling the Inwards here and there, there was something met within the
mesentery, worthy notice, to wit, about its middle, where it is fixed to the
back, and contained the greater folds of the nerves, a substance somewhat
loose, and inflated, as it were with many little bladders, equalling an hands
breadth, was seen, after that manner, as when in a shoulder of Veal, the
inter-space of the muscles, are blown up, by the Butchers, that those parts
might swell up, and seem fuller, and fatter: In this place of the mesentery,
because it was more tumid and softer, we thought some humor, the cause of the
pain, to lodge there, but opening it, I found only the membranes to have been
loosned one from another, and to conclude nothing but wind, within its
inter-spaces: which separation of the membranes, and devulsion one from another
was without doubt induced, by the frequent Convulsions or explosions of the
spirits, which within the enfoldings, and nervous fibers, there thickly
planted, were almost continually provoked; and those Convulsions happened, by
reason of the heterogeneous, and explosive particles being derived thither,
from the head, by the pipe of the Nerves.

But as to those torments of the belly, and as it were an ascent of a bulk or
substance in the convulsive distempers, and the inflation of the Abdomen, it is
not to be doubted, but that the seat of the morbific cause, did lie hid in that
part of the mesentery: but because so much suspicion was had of the womb, being
chiefly affected, we did next inquire how much this Inward deserved it:
Therefore having dilligently searched the tunnell, placed within the Os pubis,
I found the womb in its due place, and as to all parts sound, and well
furnished: its body was drawn to its just proportion, although it was but 5. weeks
since she had miscarried, viz. It was like a small pear in figure and
magnitude; the Glandulas on either side of the bottom of it, which are called
the testicles, appeared very small and flaggy, without any superfluous or
virulent humor contained in them: the body of the womb, wherever it was
dissected, equaled a thumbs breadth in thickness, its inward Cavity was no
bigger than what would hold a bean: within this hollowness, as use to be in the
Caverns of other Inwards, was included a mucous or dreggy matter, in a very
small quantity: but in truth, about the womb, or its appendix, there was
nothing, to which might be imputed as a morbific cause, of the symptoms but now
described: from whence therefore it may be demonstratively concluded, as I at
first thought, that the passions termed from the womb hysterical, are most
often excited, from some other cause, than the fault of the womb.

The Intestines being removed, we found also the reins sound enough, but one of
them was of an unusual figure, viz. It was cleft into many lobes, like the
Kidney of a Calf.

The Milt, Pancreas, and Caul without fault: the ventricle was much blown up,
and its inward Coat was plain without folds, or wrincles, which certainly
happened, by reason of its frequent Vomiting, this Inward being almost
continually troubled with Convulsions: Besides, for this reason, the tone of
the stomach being broken, it did neither rightly desire, or concoct the food,
or aliment.

The Liver very much differed from a sound constitution, for it was tumid, and
somewhat hard, of a pail color, like rotten wood, wholly dry and without
blood, and this without doubt, the frequent use of Cordial, and highly hot
liquors had effected.

The Lungs were of a bluish color, and every where obstructed, and stuffed
with a stinking and frothy matter: Certainly this Inward and the Liver had been
vitiated of a long time, wherefore as the blood being degenerate, and very much
depraved of a long time, from its right temper, had yielded the first seeds of
this sickness, so also it afforded a constant cherishment of it.

But indeed, we sought, and that not in vain, for the chief and as it were
original cause of the disease, in the head; therefore the skull being taken
off, the vessels of the Meningae, and those creeping about the brain, appeared
full, and distended with blood, when in the rest of the body, scarce any blood
had flowed forth, in the cutting of it: the thicker meninge being removed,
through the other thin and pellucid one, was discerned a clear water, filling
the enfoldings and crevices of the brain, and as it were overflowing its whole
substance: In truth the serous heap of waters, had filled full all the
Cavities, and inward places of the brain: the enfoldings of the choroides, or
net-like membranes of the brain, being a long while immersed in water, and as
it were boiled, were become discolored and half rotten: nigh to the beginning
of the Splanchnick nerves, or belonging to the Spleen, the water insinuating it
self very much, had separated the pia matter from the trunk of the oblong marrow
or pith, for two fingers breadth: without doubt, the morbific matter descending
from the head, by the passage of these nerves, into the enfolding of the
mesentery, was the cause of the pains and Convulsions: Further, the same matter
also, afflicting the heads of other nerves, and paffing through their pipes,
produced afterward, these most cruel distempers in other parts, to wit, almost
every where, of the whole body.

As to the Cure, or means of healing, used in the passions commonly called
Hysterical: forasmuch as the symptoms of this disease are very much convulsive,
The Method of Curlng the hysterical distempers.
therefore it is fit, that anti-spasmodic or anti-convulsive Remedies, such as
were before described, should be chiefly indicated; but when these distempers
most often happen to the female sex, in whom for the most part, the menstrual
flux, and other accidents of the womb do challenge a part in the morbific
cause; therefore medicines respecting the various dispositions of the womb, are
to be added to the former, and many ways to be compounded with them. The
Therapeutic or Curatory Indications, are either Curatory, to be administered in
the fit; or preservatory which are instituted out of the fit, that take away
the cause of the disease, and prevent its comings or accessions.

1. As to the first, if the fit is wont to be light, and without other
perturbation of the spirits, it may be permitted to pass away of it self;
Curatory.
but if it being more heavily troublesome, there will be need to bring some
help to nature much oppressed, this only thing is to be done, that the spirits
being freed from the Embraces of an heterogeneous Copula, they may remit their
inordinations and explosions: for this purpose, it is grown into use, to put to
the nose stinking, and ill smelling things, the scents of which compel, and
repress the too fierce spirits, ready to leap forth, into their orders, and
also shake off from them, the heterogeneous Copula, and often drive it quite
away: Asafaetida, Castor, Galbanum, being put into fine Linen and applied to
the nostrills are convenient; also burning of Partridg feathers, old skins, and
sulphur. Besides the spirits and oil of sut, or of Hartshorn do not seldom
help: yet I have known these kind of fumigations, being very troublesome to
some women, to increase the fit; it is probable that the same sometimes may too
much irritate the spirits, and drive them into greater disorders; and as
stinking things put to the nose, so the like poured into the mouth, do often
bring help: wherefore we give often with good success, to hysterical people,
Tinctures of Castor, Solutions of Assafaetida, and Galbanum, spirits of
Hartshorn, and Sut, with proper waters. Take of the spirits of Hartshorn,
from 12. to 15. and 20. drops, let them be taken in a little draught of the
following Julap. Take of the waters of penny Royal, and mugwort, each iii. of
the water of Briony compound ii. of Castor tied in a knot and hung in the glass
ss. of the whitest sugar i. mix them. Take of the Tincture of Castor i. to ss.
let it be taken ia a little draught of small beer. Take of Assafaetida, and
Galbanum ii. let it be dissolved in spirit of wine to the extraction of a red
tincture. The dose i. in two or three spoonfulls of featherfew water. Riverius
very much cries up that of Solenander. Take of musk, and of dragons-blood, each
i. take more or less of it in water of Lillies of the Valley, iii. or iiii.
John Anglicus commends parsnip-seeds, or the seeds of Pennyroyal in wine, or
other proper Liquor, as a most certain Remedy. If the fit persisting a long
time, should cause want of speech, or motion, the more sharp Clysters, as of
bryony-Roots, and Carminatives boiled in water, are to be administered, and
frictions of the thighs, and feet are to be ordered; and if they shall yet grow
stronger, Cupping-glasses are to be applied to the belly and groin, yea also,
let them be often provoked to sneezing: it is convenient to give some, in the
middle of the fit, a draught of simple cold water, or in which Champhir had
been dissolved.

Preservatory.
2. The preservatory Indication comprehends these three Intentions, viz. In the
first place to take away, or to derive to some other place the impurities of
the blood, apt to be poured forth on the brain, and nervous stock. Secondly, to
fortify the brain, and so to strengthen the indwelling spirits, that they may
either not at all receive, or may easily shake off the heterogeneous Copula.
Thirdly, to amend whatsoever is enormous in the womb, and contributes to the
convulsive disposition.

1. The first Intention is performed by purging, and phlebotomy, and other
common ways of purifying, and purging the blood and humors. If there be
opportunity for an emetic, I judge it best allways to begin with it, especially
in Cacochymicks, or bodies full of evil humors, in the longing disease, and
Pica, and in such whose great load of viscous phlegm, stuffed within the folds
and coats of the ventricle, hinders the virtues of other medicines: The next
day after the Vomit, unless any thing bids the contrary, let blood be taken, in
women of a hotter temper, presently from the Arm, and afterward if need be,
from the foot, or from the sedal veins with Leeches; but in bodies troubled
with obstructions, and less hot, let blood be taken more sparingly, and more
rarely, and only in places situate below the womb: After these Evacuations (if
they are to be ordered) rightly performed, once within six or seven days, a
purge is to be prescribed according to the following forms. Take of pill-fetida
major, i ss. of the resine of Julap xii. grains of Tartar Vitriolat, and
Castor, each i. of ammoniac dissolved in hysterical water, what will suffice to
make xii. pills, for iii. doses. Or take of the resine of Jalap gr. xviii. of
Calomelaus i. of Castor i. make a powder, let it be divided into iii. parts for
iii. doses, let it be given in the pap of a roasted apple, or in Conserves of
Borage: so those induced with a more hot temperament, a dose of extract, or our
solutive syrrop may conveniently be administered: for the revulsion of the
morbific matter from the head, Issues made in the calf of the leg, or thigh,
and sometimes vesicatories, legatures, and painful rubbings, are wont to be
administered: But not only a purging of the blood, and a revulsion of its
recrements from the head, but an alteration of its Liquor, and reduction of it
to its due temperament have here a place: Wherefore in some hysterical people,
steel Medicines help, in others the use of Spaw-waters, or whay, in others the
baths are wont to be signally profitable.

The second Intention, to wit, the rectification of the brain, and animal
spirits, is performed with Cephalic, and properly anti-convulsive medicines:
which indeed ate to be diligently exhibited, almost every day, when they do not
purge or bleed: since there are various species of such like Remedies, and
several manners of administrations, we will here add some of the more choice
forms.

Take of the Lees of bryony, Assa fetida; Castor, each i. of the Salt of Coral,
Amber, Tin, each ss. of Galbanum dissolved in hysterical water, what will
suffice to make a Mass: dose, half a scruple, to i. morning and evening,
drinking after it a dose of proper liquors.

Or, Take of the seeds of Wilde-parsnips, of nettles each ii. of vitriol of
Steel i. of the extract of Gentium, featherfew, each i ss. with what will
suffice of the syrrop of Mugwort, make a mass, let half a dram be taken after
the same manner.

If the form of a powder pleases better; Take of the Roots of Virginian
snakeweed, and Contrayerva; each i ss. of Coral prepared, of Pearls; of

3. As to the third Intention, which inhibiting the disorders of the womb, does
promote the cure of the passion called hysterical; I say, first of all what in
times past was believed, concerning the Cause and scope of curing the disease,
that the womb did ascend, therefore that it ought to be reduced into its right
place; is altogether fictitious, as we have elsewhere shown: The falling down
of the womb, or its coming forth, oftentimes happens; but rarely, or never
produces the hysterical Distempers: Besides, the dislocation of the womb in
childbearing Women, sometimes happens, presently after their bringing forth, to
wit, when the body of the womb being made Capacious, and newly emptied, does
not sink down or fall within the Tunnel, in its right place, but upwards
inclines now to the right side, now to the left, and there being drawn together
like a purse, is folded into a great bulk, which kind of bulk, remaining long,
nigh the side of the groin, is wont to give a suspicion of another child, or
the secondine or afterbirth to be left behind, or also of some hard swelling
tumor there increasing; but afterward, when the menstruum coming plentifully
away, the womb is reduced to its due magnitude, that tumor by degrees vanishes:
but while it there remains unless for that reason, the Lochia or menstrua
were stopped, it does not produce the hysterical passions. For the reducing of
this part the sooner into its due position, fomentations, Liniments, and
Plasters, are convenient. But most times that Symptom, passes over, of it
self, without any further harm. To what other distempers the womb is obnoxious,
in childbearing, and by what method to be helped, we have fully shown in
another place. As to the other vices of that part, which happen to some women,
not bearing children, we declare, that they chiefly are either a disease of the
womb, made by the breaking of the unity, viz. which is either some ulcer, or
Tumor; or an inhibition of some wonted excretion, or putting forth, to wit, a
suppression either of the menstruous blood, or the whites, or the seminal
humor: Moreover because of the menstrua being retained, the heterogeneous
particles being often poured forth into the head, bring in the Convulsive
passions: in like manner, when the whites are stopped, the excrementitious
matter, being supped up by the blood, is delivered to the brain and nervous
stock: yea, when an usual evacuation of the seed is hindered, the superfluities
of the nervous humor, flow back upon the brain, and infect its indwelling
Spirits, with an explosive and morbific tincture: There is no need here, to
discourse more largely or particularly, of those Peculiar distempers of the
womb, but to compound medicines, and intricate administrations, proper for
women's diseases, with anticonvulsive Remedies.

CHAPTER. XI. Of the Distempers commonly called Hypochondriack, which is shown
to be, for the most part Convulsive: briefly also of Chalybeats or
Steel-Medicines.
IN the foregoing Chapters, we have clearly shown, that the Passions called
hysterical, do not allways proceed from the womb, yea, more often from the head
being distempered; next we shall inquire concerning the hypochondriacal
Distempers, of what original and nature they are, and upon the fault of what
parts they chiefly depend. The vulgar opinion is, that the symptoms wont to
accompany this disease, are wholly produced from the spleen; wherefore, they
are ascribed very much to vapors, arising from this inward, and variously
running up and down, here and there; when in truth, these sicknesses for the
most part are convulsions, and contractions, of the nervous parts: but that it
might appear, by what causes they are wont to be excited, we ought to consider
first, the Symptoms themselves, and to place them into some order or rank.

A description of the hypoch^ndriaca Affections.
As to the Distempers therefore, which are vulgarly termed hypochondriac, it is
observable, that they happen chiefly to men of a melancholy temperament, with
a dark aspect, and more lean habit of body: it is rarely, that this disease
troubles fair people, with a fresh Countenance, or also those endued with a too
Phlegmatic complexion: It betrays it self in manifest fignes, about the hight
or midest of their Age; men are found to be more frequently obnoxious to this,
than women, being made habitual in either, it is very hardly, or not at all to
be cured, in women, by reason of their weaker Constitution, it is accompanied,
with a great many more Convulsive Distmpers, wherefore, Commonly it is said in
this Sex, the hysterical, to be joined with the hypochondriacal Passion.

The Symptoms which are imputed to this Disease, are commonly very manifold,
and are of a diverse nature, neither do they observe in all, the like beginning,
or the same mutual dependency, among themselves: for they seem in these, most
to affect the Inwards of the lower belly, in those the Praecordia, in others
the Confines of the Brain: and in most, though not in all, the ventricle
labors much; concerning the appetite it is often too much, but presently
burdened with what it has taken in; and when the food, staying longer in it,
by reason of slowness of Concoction, their Saline particles being carried forth
into a flux, pervert the whole mass of the Chyle, into a pulse or pottage, now
Sour, or austere, now salt or sharp: from hence pains of the heart, great
breakings forth of blasts, rumbling of wind, and often vomiting succeed; and
because of a pneumatick defect, or of Spirits, the Chyme or juice, is not
wholly made volatile, and carried forth of doors, but that the ballast of the
Viscous or Slimy matter, sticking to the coats of the ventricle, is left
behind; an almost continual Spitting infests them; a distention in the
hypochondrium, and often there, and under the ventricle, a cruel pulsation is
felt: also there pains ordinarily arise, which run about here and there, and
for many hours miserably torment with a certain lancing: In the mean time, from
the Contractures of the Membranes, and from the fluctuation of winds, stirred
up by that means, rumbling and murmurs are produced: Also in the Thorax,
oftentimes there is a great constriction and straitness, that the respiration
becomes difficult and troublesome, upon any motion: also, most grievous
asthmatical fits fall upon some: moreover, the sick are wont to complain of a
trembling, and palpitation of the heart, with a noted oppression of the same:
also a sinking down or melting away of the Spirits, and frequent fear of a
trance, comes upon them, that the sick think Death is always seizing them: In
this Region, about the membranes, and chiefly the mediastinum, or that divides
the middle of the belly, an accute pain, which is now Circumscribed to one
part, now extended to the shoulders, is a familiar Symptom of this Disease. But
indeed in the head, an Iliad of evils does for the most part disturb
hypochondriacal people, to wit, most cruel pains returning at set times, do
arise, also the swimming of the head, and frequent Vertigoes, long watchings, a
Sea, and most troublesome fluctuation of thoughts, an uncertainty of mind, a
disturbed fancy, a fear and suspicion of every thing, an imaginary possession
of diseases, from which they are free; also very many other distractions of
Spirits, yea sometimes Melancholy, and madness accompany this sickness:
besides these interior Regions of the Body beseiged by this Disease, wandering
pains, also Convulsions, and numbness, with a sense of pricking, invade almost
all the outward parts; nightly Sweats, flushings of the Blood in the face, and
the palms of the hands, eratick feavours, and many other Symptoms, of an
uncertain original, do every where arise; concerning which; forasmuch as the
genuine Causes, and the manner of their coming to pass, could not be readily
determined, presently all the fault is cast upon the Spleen, and Physicians
accuse that, as if it were the chief author of every irregular Distemper; but
by what right or authority, by and by shall be sought into: In the mean time,
it is to be observed, The hypochondriacal distempers belong to the nervous
kind.
that the chief Symptoms of this sickness, are Convulsive, and depend
immediately upon the irregularities of the animal Spirits, and the nervous
juice, rather than on the evil disposition of the Viscera, serving for
Concoction. But indeed, from whence the first rise of this most complicated
Disease proceeds, and by what means it brings forth the diverse manners of
distempers, in so many places, will not be so easy to determine.

It would be a tedious thing, to show here, The causes of the hypochondriac
passion is inquired into.
what the ancient and modern Physicians thought of the hypochondriack Passion,
and of its essence, and Causes; we will only take notice, that most of them do
ascribe this sickly Disposition, to the only fault of the Spleen; In the mean
time some contend that the whole confines of this Inward, partaking of part of
the fault, the blood flowing every where in the Splenetick, and Epigastric
Vessels (or those belonging to the Spleen and belly) for that it being guilty
of an hot and dry intemperature, and so obnoxious to too much fermentation,
brings forth the original, or gives a beginning to this manifold evil: But the
famous Highmore, affording relief, as well to the Spleen, as the Womb, has
cast the chief Cause of this Disease, wholly on the vicious Constitution of the
ventricle; and from thence, he would have the reasons of the aforesaid
Symptoms, to be originally sought, But indeed, that he might frame a fit
hypothesis, for the solving the Phenomenon of this sickness, he first supposes,
the tone of the stomach to become too loose, and weak, that for that reason, it
hardly, and very imperfectly Concocts the aliments: so that the thin, and more
Spirituous part of the Chyle, being sent from thence, sooner than it ought, to
the blood, perverts its disposition, to a hot and sour temper; then the residue
of the food, by a longer stay, within the Ventricle, degenerates into a
ponderous, and viscous or clammy Phlegm; which also, by its Stagnation (even
as it is observable in things to be eaten, being longer kept) becomes very
sour, or sharp: But from hence, that learned Man argues, that from the blood
made too serous and thin, its effervescencies quickly passing through it, are
induced: and from the stomach, loaded with ballast of ropy or viscous matter,
the wind and distentions of the Ventricle, and hypochondria, as also the
belching, and troublesome Spitting, do arise: whereby indeed, he wholly exempts
the Spleen, from this fault, he contends, that it does neither draw to it self
the melancholy dregs of the blood, nor serves for any office whatsoever, about
the Sanguification or the making of blood; but that its use almost only
consists in this, that this Inward swelling up, or growing turgid with very hot
blood, it administers heat to the adjacent Ventricle, and cherishes it with
gentle warmth.

Although I may so far assent to this famous Author, concerning this opinion, The
Hypothesis of Dr. Highmore sifted.
that I yield, the ventricle does often grievously labor in this Distemper,
forasmuch as the tone of which, being made lax, and its strength broken, by
reason of the indigestion of the aliment, a load of viscous Phlegm, or
Petuitous matter, is begotten even in its bosom, to which, by reason of the
Saline particles, being brought into a flux, by their long stay, oftentimes a
notable soarness, and austereness happen; then because the fault in the first
Concoction is not mended, the dyscrasies and disorders of the blood, receive
that want of digestion in the second: But yet he cannot draw me into that
opinion, that the ventricle is always chiefly in the fault, or that the other
Symptoms, of the hypochondriacal Disease, depend only on its vicious
Constitution: For I have known many, cruelly afflicted with this sickness, who
have been well enough in their stomach: although they have very much complained
of the pulsation in the left hypochondrium, of the straitness of the breast,
and a wandering pain excited in it, also of the trembling, and oppression of the
heart, with a continual fear, and disturbed Imagination; in the mean time, they
were wont to desire food greatly, and to digest whatsoever was eaten, without
any trouble of the ventricle, or heaviness, and also without any spitting or
acid belching: yea, I have observed others, great drinkers, and using an evil
manner of living, to have contracted a looseness of the stomach, with an ill
digestion, windiness, and frequent vomiting, who sound enough about their
praecordia, and animal faculties, were not at all accounted for hypochondriacs:
Besides, in this Distemper, the ventricle is often rather sick from the
vitiousness of other parts, or of the Blood, than from its own default;
because, it is usual for those sort of sick people, to be well in their
stomach, so long as they may lie abed, and breath it forth; but when they are
raised up, the pores being shut up, and the dregginess of the bloody mass
stagnating within, presently to be afflicted with the pain of the heart, an
aggestion of wind, and frequent endeavors to vomit.

For these, and other Considerable Reasons, I judge the original of the
hypochondriacal Disease, to be derived from some other fountain, than the
weakness of the Ventricle: but forasmuch, as among the parts here primarily
suspected, to be affected, great complaints are made against the Spleen; it
will be worth our while, to enquire, what office this Inward does discharge,
then, as often as it fails in it, whether it contributes to this Disease.

The use of the Spleen is inquired into.
Tho I may grant with Doctor Highmore, that the Spleen does cherish the
Ventricle with its warmth, and so perhaps in some measure help Concoction: yet
I do not conclude, this part to be framed chiefly for that end, but for some
more noble uses; because, there seems to be need, for the digesting of the food
in the stomach, not so much of heat, as of an active ferment: For fishes being
actually cold, devour their food whole, and without the help of heat, easily
concoct the same, being resolved as it were by a certain menstrum: besides, it
is observed of the spleen, that though in man, its whole substance lies near to
the ventricle, in most other creatures, who are endued with a longish form, as
to the greatest part of it, it is removed far from the Ventricle: Further, if
the Spleen be the only Chimny, in which the blood warming the Ventricle is
contained, what is the reason, that it, rather than the Liver or Lungs, becomes
of a livid or bluish color, and is stuffed with a black blood, and that less
hot?

See his discourse of fermentation. Chap. 5th.
When I consider these things, which sometime since I have observed; concerning
the use of the Spleen; it seems far more probable, that a certain dreggy
portion, viz. a matter, consisting of an earthly, and fixed salt, is laid up in
this Inward, by the blood carried to it, by the arteries, which being exalted
there as it were by digestion, and into the nature of a ferment, is lastly
committed to the blood, flowing from it by the veins, which inspires or
quickens it, with a certain leven or fermentation, and performs the same thing
about its Spirit, or making it Spirituous, as our ferment commonly called
Leven, does, being put into a batch of bread or dough; for as a certain portion
of the unbak'd bread or dough, being kept to a sourness, preserves the same
nature, that it does ferment or leaven other bread or dough, and stirs up in it
the otherwise sluggish particles into motion; so it seems, that the blood being
laid up in the milt or Spleen, and there getting a sourness, as it were by
stagnation, puts on the nature of a ferment, whereby indeed the rest of the
mass of blood, and perhaps the other humors, are actuated, and as it were
Spiritualised, into a more lively motion. What has been ingeniously wrote, by
a late author, viz. the most learned Velthusius, concerning the use of the
Spleen, may have relation to this: for he has determined as highly probable, a
ferment to be contained in this Inward, whereby the sluggish particles of the
blood, are brought into a state of activity: Because, taking notice, that in
children, and others endued with a sanguine temperament, and more fat or dull
habit of body, even as their manners, and disposition of mind were inclined to
idleness, softness, and dullness, so their Spleen was ever of a reddish color,
and full of florid blood, like the Liver: from hence he concludes, that the
spleen does but little perform its office in these, as the gential parts before
ripe age, or in those of weak loins; but on the contrary, forasmuch as men of a
middle age, and chiefly in those, who are of a severe Countenance, and of a
lean body, as in them appear marks of cunning, Sagacity, fortitude, and
constancy, so their spleen is found to be of a livid or bluish color, and
imbued with blood, as it were muddy: further he argues from hence, that the
blood, being kept long in the spleen, as in a Conduit or receptacle, turns
plainly into ferment, by which its remaining mass, being from thence inspired,
is made more subtle, and begets more acute Spirits, both in the vital, and in
the Animal Kingdom or Government: For he supposes, our bodies naturally to
abound, with too much humidity, by which indeed the function of the parts, and
many of the viscera, are very much dulled: but that the spleen, does
communicate to the mass of blood, solid, firm, and constant parts, and not
easily to be dissipated; and that those do wipe away that moistness, and with
it carry away in some measure, that softness, from the blood and Spirits, which
is predominate in tender age: almost after the same manner, as the north-winde,
or the eastern gales, fanning and intimately penetrating the air, with the
dryness and strength of their parts, breathe health or strength to the air, and
to our Bodies.

But since I have in another place, declared what I have formerly thought,
concerning the Spleen, there will be no need to repeat it in this: yet I shall
further note, that in bodies of living creatures, compacted out of a quinarie
of elements, as the spirits ought to be more strong then the rest: so indeed
they being entangled with a viscous humidity of Sulphur, and water, are so
hindered, that oftentimes they are not able to exercise their strength or powers
lively enough; hence saline particles, for that they are very much fermenting,
are required for this, that the spirituous little bodies, almost overwhelmed by
the embrace of the others, and stupifyed, might lie awakened, and set at
liberty, and into motion. Wherefore we experience in our selves, when the
spirits are dulled, by the blood being too much exhaled, that notable help is
brought, by sharp liquors, as chiefly small wines, and Cider: for these kind
of Remedies sharpen the Spirits, and shake off all heaviness. Such a kind of
fermenting virtue, we easily believe to be continually exercised, by the Spleen
being in right order, toward the blood and nervous Liquor.

For as this Inward is formed with a threefold sort of vessels, viz. with
arteries, and veins, and besides with great enfoldings of the nerves, and a
most thick Contexture of nervous fibers; we think the use of each of them, to
be set apart for this end: to wit, by the Arteries, the blood is carried to the
Spleen, hence it lays up its dreggs, composed of a fixed Salt, and an earthly
matter, in its passages and porosities, and these there laid up, as it were by
a certain digestion, are brought into a juice very fermentive: A portion also
of which, being carried back to the blood, by the veins, is continually mixed
with it: and so its whole mass, is inspired with those kind of fermentive
particles, from the Spleen; by which, a certain austerity and sharpness, with
vigor of motion, is given unto it; so that, for that reason, the blood it self
is carried more lively in the vessels; also from thence, the nervous juice,
procreated from the blood, being more active supplies the animal regiment: But
truly, the Spleen does not only by this means mediatly, and by the intervention
of the blood, inspire the brain and nervous stock, with a fermentive virtue;
but it may be lawfully believed, that this is done somewhat more immediately,
by the passage of the nerves, dispersed in the spleen: for, because in this
part, anatomy discovers a great company of Nerves, and nervous enfoldings, and
of fibers springing from them, it may well be doubted, for what use they should
serve: Concerning this, it is first to be observed, that the ventricle, and the
Spleen, have a most intimate Commerce with the brain; insomuch, that Helmont
did place the seat of the Soul, in those Inwards, but this is possible to be
done, by no more commodious way, than by the aforesaid nerves: Wherefore, we
may here disservedly suspect, that not only the animal Spirits, are the
messengers between the one part, and the other, but also, that the nervous
Liquour, which is both the food, and the ventricle of these spirits, does
descend now from the brain toward these Inwards, and now being received from
these Viscera's by the nerves, does creep through toward the head: which kind
of spleeny Juice, being dilated to the brain, sharpens the animal Spirits, and
raises them up being slothful, and irritates them into quick motions: from
whence it is commonly said, the sharpness and sagacity of the mind, does
proceed from the Spleen, and Splenetick people, are accounted Ingenious: But it
is probable, that the rage, and force of the passions, being begun by the
Spirits inhabiting the brain, are carried to the spleen, by the passage of the
nerves; and so the spirits there dwelling, are pathetically troubled, and the
blood flowing thither, is moved into a multitude of perturbations: for from
hence it in some measure falls out, that in anger, sadness, and other
distempers of the mind, according as the ferment if the Spleen, being more or
less moved, is inspired to the blood, its liquor diversely boyls up: Further,
for this reason it happens, that great inflations and Commotions, of the left
hypocondrium, come upon splenitic people, from every violent passion.

The reasons of the hypochondriacal Symptoms laid open.
These things being thus premised, concerning the use of the spleen, it will be
easy, according to our hypothesis, to lay open very many of the symptoms,
belonging to the hypochondriac Distemper; and to give reasons for each of them:
For when the Spleen is wanting in its office, that is, when it does not strain
forth the melancholy recrements of the blood, nor cook them into a
fermentative matter, as we but now observed in children, and others of a
sanguine Complexion, or too phlegmatic, to happen often; the disposition of
the mind, is made duller, the body grows fat with idleness, yea, and the blood
being more sluggish than it ought to be, is apt to stand still within its
vessels, or at least to be less lively circulated: But on the Contrary where
the fermenting power of the spleen, is too much axalted or perverted, the blood
by that means being more sharp than usual, or made more sour, it runs about
rapidly here and there, and conceives irregular motions; yea, and the nervous
juice, falling away from its right temper, imbues the animal Spirits, with an
heterogenious and an explosive Copula, and so irritates them, as it were with
goads, into frequent Convulsions: as that not wholly undeservedly, many kinds
of diseases, may be imputed to the Spleen being out of order: But the ways or
means of affecting, whereby the Spleen being evilly disposed, does produce the
symptoms of the hypochondriack passion, or at least contributes to the rise of
them, are chiefly these following.

The Influences of the Spleen in producing the symptoms unfolded.
First, it sometimes happens, that the spongie substance of the spleen, from the
faeces of the blood, being too much impacted, in its pores, and stagnating, is
very much stuffed, and obstructed: that from thence, it does not sufficently
receive, the recrements of the bloody mass: but the same being carried thither,
but not received do flow back into the neighboring branches of the Caeliack
Artery, from whence they are presently carried, into the membranes of the
ventricle, the Caul, the mesenterie, and other nigh parts, and are wont to be
affixed to them; hence the tone of those viscera, are so much spoiled, that
they do not rightly perform their due offices, about the concoction of the
Chyle, and the membranes planted every way about, being much imbued with
heterogeneous and irritative particles, for that they are almost continually
pulled by convulsions here and there stirred up, they are grievously obnoxious
to wandering pains, contractions, distentions, and the increase of Winds; by
reason of this kind of regurgitation of the blood, from the Spleen, being
obstructed, it is likely, that the pulsation, which is felt by hypochondriacks,
under the Ventricle, is excited.

2. When the faeculencies of the blood, are excluded from the Spleens being
obstructed, being fixed (as was said) to its neighboring parts, they bring
forth the sickly distemper of the left hypochondrium: but though indeed, that
Inward sufficently receives the melancholy or atrabilious juice, carried to it
from the blood, by the Arteries, yet oftentimes it does not rightly Cook it,
but the Salt being too much excited, it changes it into a too sharp, or acid,
austeer, or sour; or some other kind of vicious humor: whereby, when as the
whole mass of blood, and the nourishable Juice, contained in its bosom, are
almost wholly infected, the fruits of the hypochondriack seeds, bud forth
through the whole body; the blood grows unduely hot, is in some places
impetuously moved, and again in others is apt to stagnate or stand still: from
hence, it is familiar with Spleenetick people, presently after eating, to grow
red in the face, to have the palms of their hands hot, their hypochondria to
swell, oppressions of the heart, and noted variations of the pulse, to succeed,
But these fermentative particles being translated, from the blood, every where
into the solid parts, wandering pains, runng up and down here and there, and a
sense of pricking, are stirred up in many members of the Body: moreover, from
this Infection of the blood, for that its mass is changed, from a benign and
balsamic temper, into a salt and tartareous, a lean habit of body, with a
black and dark Countenance, is induced.

3. From the blood being so depraved, by the fault of the Spleen, oftentimes
the taint is carried to the animal government; for heterogeneous and Convulsive
Particles, are poured frequently into the brain, and from thence, into the
nervous stock; so that the animal Spirits, dwelling in either province,
conceive various irtegularities: by reason of the evil being impressed on the
head, hypochondriacks use to be troubled with various phantasms, with an heap,
and fluctuations of thoughts: besides, to them happen frequent Vertigoes,
Scotomies, headaches, and often parlytical Distempers: then, forasmuch as the
morbific matter, flides down from the head, into the nervous stock, Convulsive
Diseases are excited, in very many parts of the body, but chiefly about the
Praecordia, and Viscera of the lower belly: for when the Spirits flowing within
the nerves, which respect those parts, are greatly disturbed, by reason of the
distemper of the mind, the Convulsive particles, the more readily enter into
those pipes, and more easily impress on those Spirits, a Convulsive
Disposition: Therefore, partly by reason of the infection mediatly transmitted
to the Brain, and partly by reason of the hurt, (as has been shown) immediately
Communicated from the Spleen, the Palpitation of the heart, trembling, and
frequent swooning, Constrictions of the Breast, impediments of breathing, Pains
of the stomach, belching, Vomiting, and many other accidents in those Inwards,
happen to hypochondriacks.

4. Besides these inordinations, which are wont to be derived by the passage of
the blood, from the Spleen; into the humors and sollid parts, and to the brain
it self, and nervous stock; there are other farther evils, which seem to arise
from this Inward, also by the passage of the nerves: Because, as we have shown,
their extreme branches, and the nervous fibers themselves, interwoven in the
Viscera, do drink in with their outward most little mouths, a certain humor,
and convey it sometimes upwards, it is highly probable, that the nervous
fibers, distributed to the Spleen, (of which as we but now hinted, there is a
mighty Guard) do receive its most sharp juice, which Creeping higher, through
the nervous pipes, becomes a Cause of Convulsive motions: In truth, that there
may be those intimate Commerces, between the brain, and the Spleen, to wit, far
sooner, than what can be made, by the compassing about of the blood, it may be
lawful to believe, that the nerves of the wandering pair, and the intercostal,
to be the nearest means of the passage, whereby these parts Communicate one
with the other, and mutually affect themselves. For it seems, that when the
black bile or melanchollic tumor in the Spleen, grows turgid or swells up of
its own accord, or is moved by some evident cause, its particles enter the
nervous fibers, thickly distributed to the same, which disturb the animal
Spirits flowing in them, into explosions, or at least into some disorder: then
the Spirits being so distrubed, infect those next to them, and they others,
till by their continued series, the passion begun within the Spleen, is
propagated even to the brain, and there produces inordinate Phantasms, such as
happen to hypochondriacks, also on the other side, when a grievous distemper of
the mind, occasionally excited, within the brain, does disturb the Spirits
inhabiting it, the impression being carried to the Fantasy, by the series of
the Spirits, planted within the nerves of the wandering pair, and the
Intercostals, and successive affection, it is brought even to the Spleen; hence
its ferment being put more into commotion, stirs up Convulsions, both in that
Inward, and in the whole neighborhood of fibers and membranes; and besides,
forces the blood into ebbings and flowings, and into various aestuations or
vehement motions; yea and reflects the perturbations of the Spirits, upon the
brain. From this kind of reciprocal affection of the brain and Spleen, it
comes to pass, that hypochondriacks are so unquiet, unstable, and fluctuating,
at every thing that's proposed, as if, according to the Poet, Ten minds strove
in them at once.

A certain noble Gentleman, of a melanchollic temper, and always accounted
trembling of the heart, of an assiduous vertigo, too much waking, and a
disturbed fancy: About the 35th. year of his age, the disease growing worse,
he began hardly to sleep, and yet more rarely to get it at night, and to be
molested in the day time, with a world of fluctuating thoughts, to have in
suspicion all things and persons, and greatly to be afraid of every object: his
Praecordia seemed to be very much bound, and straitened, and to sink down to
the bottom, as if the heart it self were depressed even into the belly; which
Symptom, troubling him, he became very sad, and dejected in mind: yet
afterward, those distempers of the mind remitting, he felt with it his heart
to be a little lifted up and also his Praecordia to be loosened, and stretched
forth; besides, he very often sustained pains and Contractions variously
excited, about the muscles of the Viscera, and Members, and running up and down
here and there.

As to the nature of the disease, it is plain, that it is this kind of
Distemper, which is commonly called hypochondriacall: but as to what respects
the Causes of these to be admired Symptoms, we may suppose, the mass of blood
being degenerate, and stuffed with melanchollic or atrabilarie faeculencies, to
administer or continually to suggest its adust recrements to the head; from
whence, the Liquor watering the brain and nerves, being made sharp, and
improportionate to the Spirits, did stir up the containing Bodies, into
painful Corrugations, or wrinklings, and Contractures: Further, when this
Infection is chiefly derived from the head, into the Nerves of the wandering
pair, and the intercostall, the brain and the Praecordia, are very much
punished, by the malady from thence raised up. But that the Blood is depraved
by that means, it seems to be imputed to the vice of the Spleen, forasmuch as
this Inward, being amiss, it did not rightly strain forth the atrabilarie
dreggs from the blood, but rather did more pervert whatsoever recrements it
received from it, and the same being exalted into an hurtful ferment, sent it
back to the blood, and so very much infected its mass, and imbued it with a
plainly acetous, and vitriolick evil Disposition.

It is plain to be understood, that those symptoms troubling the Head, viz. too
much waking, the vertigo, a disturbed fantasy, with many others, did proceed
from the heterogeneous particles poured forth from the Blood, into the brain:
As to that straitness of the Breast, and falling down of the heart, with great
fear and sadness, it may be thought, that the nervous fibers, inserted to the
heart, and chiefly to the Pericordium, being moved into Convulsions, and
wrinklings, do bind hard those parts, and pull them downwards; wherefore,
there is perceived in the whole breast, as it were a certain constriction, and
the heart it self seems to be depressed: Further, forasmuch the Praecordia
being so streitened and depressed, the blood within the bosom of the heart is
stopped, and compelled, as it were to stagnate, both the vital and the sensitive
Soul, is much hindered, from its wonted expansion and irradiation, and for that
Cause, being lessened and shortened in its constitution, those Cruel
distempers of fear and sadness arise, but when the Convulsions remitting, that
constriction of the heart and its appendix, is released, the Soul also, as a
flame more expansed or enlarged, endeavors by little and little to shake off
the Chains of those Passions. For the Cure of these Distempers, he had for a
long time tried very many remedies, and medical Administrations, but without
much benifit, at last he was somewhat eased by the use of Spaw-waters, and from
thence by degrees finding himself better he became free from those grievous
Symptoms, however, he still lived obnoxious to the hypochondriac Distemper.

hypochondrium, with a most heavy Pain. After he had labored with this sort of
Distemper, about half a year, he began to complain of a frequent giddiness, a
blindness of his eyes, an unquietness of his mind, and of disturbed sleeps:
Which Symptoms were then plainly imputed to vapors arising from the Spleen:
but after that followed, a trembling of the heart, with a frequent deliquium of
the Spirits, a pulsation of the hypochondrium, and at length pains, and
Contractions in the outward members, with a frequent stupor, and a sense of
pricking running up and down here and there: and last of all, being broken with
a world of evils, contrary to his genius, and native Disposition, he became
greatly hypochondriacall.

That I may dispatch the Pathologie of this Case in a word, it appears here
plain enough, that the Spleen was first of all in fault; by whose fault, when
the bloody mass was depraved, the taint creeping from thence, into the humor
watring the brain and nervous stock, and infecting it, did induce the aforesaid
Convulsive Symptoms.

The Curatory Method to be used against the hypochondriacal Distempers requires
chiefly these four general Indications. viz. In the first place, The Method of
Curing the Hypochondriac Distempers.
that the Impediments of the Cure may be taken away, the Intention of which
chiefly respects the purging, and preserving the first passages. Secondly, it
must be endeavored that the obstructions of the Spleen, may be Corrected.
Thirdly, that both the recrements of the bloody mass may be purged forth, and
that its due disposition may be restored. Fourthly, and lastly, that the
enormities of the brain and nervous stock, and also of the watering humor, and
the inhabiting Spirits, contracted by the fault of the blood, and Spleen, may
be amended, or taken away: when any of these Intentions, or all of them
together, shall be endeavored at, fit times should be chosen, in which each
being singly proposed, may be performed, without any neglect or hindrance of
the rest.

8. As to the first Indication, when a great load of crude or adust matter, is
wont to be laid up in the first passages, and when the tone of the Ventricle
used to be spoiled, and its ferment variously perverted, against every one of
these kinds of evils, you must bring timely help, with fit remedies;
therefore, gentle and moderate evacuations, both by Vomit if it prospers well,
and by Stool, ought to be administered: For such, whose stomach easily casts
forth its contents upwards, I persuade, that once in a month Vomiting should be
several times provoked by taking Liquor of Squills, or Salt of Vitriol, or by
drinking plentifully small beer posset drink, or warm water; in the time
between, a gentle purge, and only a little moving is to be orderd often: For
this end, The pills Tartareous, of Bontius, or Stomach-pills with Gums, or our
solutive extract, may be of use. Take of the best Senna i, of Rhubarb vi, of
Epithim iii, of yellow-Sanders ii, of the Salt of wormwood ii, of Celtic Spike
i, being cut and bruised, let them be digested in x ounces of White wine, and as
much of fumitory water, for 48 hours, let the clear straining be evaporated,
with the heat of a gentle bath, to the consistency of an extract, adding
toward the end, of the powders of Senna, of Rhubarb, and cream of Tartar each
ii, let them be bruised together in a glass mortar, and reduced to the
consistency of Pills. The Dose ss, ii, or i, the Remedies respecting the tone,
and ferment of the ventricle, as they are manifold and diverse, out of them the
most fit or commodious for the Disposition of the Ventricle, are to be chosen;
for to this bitter things, to that Saltish, to another sharp and perhaps biting
things, are desirable. Among the number of these kinds of medicines, (which are
commonly called Digestives) are Elixir Proprietatis, Tinctura Sacra, powder of
Aron Compound, Salt of Wormwood, Cream of Tartar, Tartar vitriolat,, Vitriol of
Steel, with many others. Besides these inward Remedies, also external
applications do often bring help: Because the Stomach being ill affected, a
fomentation of white wind, with wormwood, century, and other bitter plants
boiled therein, also ointments, or plasters, often bring help: Concerning
which, there will be no need here to discourse particularly; and to prescribe
forms of the Medicines themselves.

2. The second Indication, for the mending the vices of the Spleen, (to wit, if
there shall be in the same any obstruction, Tumor, or pain, or simple
dyscrasie or Intemperament,) is wont to be performed, or at least attempted, by
Remedies both internal, and exrernal: Those which are of the former Sort, fall
in with those indicated in the 3d place, (to wit, with such, as for the
purifying the Blood is intended) because, when chiefly, or almost all, that
which is carried, or born to the Spleen, is done by the passage of the blood,
the irrigularities of the Latex of this, as well as of that Inward, by a Social
labor, ought to be cured, with the joint strength of Medicines; by what means
is shown by and by. In the mean time, some external Applications, under the
form of a plaster, or an ointment, or a fomentation, more nearly and
immediately respect the body of the Spleen, and often bring notable help,
forasmuch as they discuss tumors, and allay the Convulsive Distempers, and
quiet them. Great plenty of these kind of outward medicines, are every where
extant among Authors, the choice of which ought to be made, according to the
various passions of the Spleen, or the diverse Constitutions of the Patient, so
that there will be no need here, to show their particular forms.

3. The Remedies indicated in the 3d place, to wit, which take away the
dyscrasies or evil temper of the blood, contracted from the vice of the
Spleen, and also clear the primary fault of the Spleen, are of a manifold, and
diverse kind, and manner, the choice of which ought to be administered,
according to the various infection of this, or that: of these, some are
compounded, and prepared according to the prescription of Physicians, as
Electuaries, Powders, Apozems, Tinstures, Infusions, and the like; others more
simple, as whey, asses milk, Spaw-waters, and Bathes.

There are two chief Cases of sick people, in which magisterial Remedies ought
to be all accommodated, according to their strength and quallities: to wit,
either the blood is thick, coldish, and earthy, with the Spleen being
obstructed, which requires more hot, fermenting, and chiefly Chalybiate
medicines; or the blood being clearly adust, and hot, ferments too much, and
together greatly troubles the hypochondria, and in them, the blood and humors
boil up; in which state, Remedies only temperate, and allaying the fermenting,
and immoderate boiling of the humors, are to be chosen, where chalibiats are
wholly to be avoided.

When therefore to a cold ventricle, cold discrasies or evil temperaments, of
the blood and Spleen also happen, I am wont to prescribe, according to the
following forms.

Take of the Troches of Rhubarb, of the Powder of the root of Aron, of winteran
Bark, each ii, of the root of virginian Snakeweed, Centrayerva, Diatrion
Santulon, of Crabs eyes, each i, of the extract of Gentian, of Century, each
iss, of ammoniae, dissolved in the water of Earthworms, what will suffice to
make a mass of Pills: let them take 4 pills in the morning, and at 4 a clock in
the afternoon, drinking after them a little draught, of wormwood-wine, or
chalibiate wine, with moderate exercise.

Take of the Conserves of the yellow of Oranges, and of Lemons, each iii, of
preserved mirabolans, n. ii, of the Species of aromaticum Rosatum, of winteran
Bark, each ii, of the Salt of wormwood ii, of the vitriol of Steel i, (or Steel
prepared iii.) with what will suffice of the Syrrop of Citron rines, make an
Electuary, To be taken twice a day, drinking after it a draught of
wormwood-wine, or of the Infusion of the herb or flowers of Tamarisk.

For those who are not pleased, but with medicines in an elegant form, and in a
very little quantity, the tinctures of Antimony, and of Corrall, also of Steel,
with the Spirit of wine, (the body being first dissolved by a proper menstrum,
and reduced to a Calx) are convenient: as aso the Spirits of Sut, of blood, or
of hartshorn, to be taken twice a day, with a proper liquor, to 12. drops,
more or less, are of known benefit, above any other medicine that I know of:
moreover the often drinking of Coffee, also that made of the Infusion of the
leaves of Thea, gives ease to some.

If that the fervor of the blood, and too fermenting, with the trouble of the
Spleen, and unquietness of the mind, be joined to the hypochondriac Distemper.

Take of the Conserves of hyps or Conaradine, vi. (or of the flowers of
Tamarisk, and the leaves of Wood Sorrel, each iii.) of the Species of Diarrodon
Abbatis, of the confection of Alkermis, each i, of the powder ofi Ivory iss, of
Pearls ss. of the Salt of Tamarisk, and wormwood, each i. with what will
suffice of the Syrrop of green Citrons,, or Clove-Gilliflowers, make an Opiate,
to be taken twice in a day, the quantity of a nutmeg.

Take of the powder of Ivory, ii. of the Powder of Pearls, i. of the Species of
diarrhodon Abbatis, of Diamagarit frigida, each iss. make a fine powder, add of
white Sugar, dissolved in Baume-water, and boiled to the consistency of Tablets
vi. make thereof according to Art, Lozenges, or little cakes: take iss or ii
twice a day. To these, and other medicines of this nature, may be joined the
use of Spaw-waters, which indeed, in either, yea, in all cases, of
hypochondriac Melancholy, are almost always taken with good success: For want
of those waters, our artificial Spaw-waters, may be conveniently ordered, yea,
and whey, and if any notable atrophie be, let Asses milk be daily taken.

Besides, these inward Remedies, and other outward Applications,
before-recited, Phlebotomie, or the taking away of blood with Leeches, from the
sedal veins, may be of use frequently: yea, sometimes it may be convenient, to
open the Salvatella Vein, according to the prescript of the Ancients: Besides
Cauteries, or Issues, which may continually carry forth the adust recrements of
the blood, and by degrees excern them, are wont to be benificiall almost to all.

4. The fourth Indication, respecting the affections of the brain, and nervous
stock, or the Convulsive Symptoms having relation to or coming upon the former,
is rarely in use of it self, and apart from the others, but that Remedies
destinated to this end, are complicated with those abovesaid. Liquors endued
with a volatile Salt, or an ammoniac, as Spirits of Hartshorn, and Sut, are
highly necessary for this Intention, as also the rest but now recitied;
wherefore such Remedies, unless any thing shall show the contrary, may be daily
given at fit hours. Further, when Spaw-waters are drunk, let tablets or pills,
such as are above-prescribed, for the Convulsive distempers, be taken at least
twice in a day. In the frequent turning, and giddiness, also in the passions of
the heart, the sinking down of the Spirits, with dread, and as it were a fear
of Death, just seizing on one, I have known very often, great help to be had,
by the use of Chalibeat, or steel Medicines.

Since we have made mention so often, of Chalibiat or steel-medicins, The
preparations and effects of Steel Medicines unfolded.
it will be worth our while, to inquire into their various preparations, and
for that reason their diverse manners of effects, which they are wont to produce
in the humane body, that it may from hence appear, by what means, and for what
respects, these or those preparations of Iron, are greatly profitable to some
hypochondriacks, and to others as much hurtful.

The virtue and operation of Chalybeat, or steeled mecicines, depends upon the
porticles of the concerts, being after a various manner dissolved, unfolded,
and brought forth into act: For steel, or Iron, consists chiefly of a Salt
Sulphur, and Earth: and but slenderly endued with Spirits and water: But the
particles of the former Elements, chiefly the Sulphurous, and saline, being in
their mixture combined together, with the Earth, remain altogether fixed, and
sluggish, but being soluted, and pulled one from another, they come to be of a
very efficacious Energy.

The aforesaid particles are dissolved in a twofold manner, and set into the
Liberty of acting: viz. either by Art, whilst medicines are prepared, or by
Nature after they are taken inwardly; for the metallic Body, is wont to be
dissolved, and eaten, by the ferment of the ventricle, just like a Chemical
menstrum: we will consider the several Species of either, and their manner of
being made, that it may appear, what alteration is impressed, on the steeled
medicine, in the preparation; and what effects every preparation of it, does
impresse on man's Body.

The most simple way of preparing Iron, is a division of its body, into little
integral parts, with a file, which resemble the nature of the whole mixture,
and contain both little sulpureous bodies, and saline, combined among
themselves, and with other terrestrial. The filings of Iron being inwardly
taken, is dissolved by the ferment of the ventricle, as it were by an acid
menstrum; the signs of which are, both a sulphurous and unsavorie belching,
as from the eating of hard eggs, also the blackness of the ordure, from steel
being dissolved within the Viscera of Concoction, active particles, both
Sulphurous and Saline, Plentifully sally forth, and being involved with the
nutritious juice, are carried into the blood; which as they excel in a diverse
virtue, do often conspire, as it were with the joint forces of either, to bring
benefit to the sick. The Sulphurous little bodies being brought to the blood,
add to it a new, and more plentiful Provision of Sulphur, wherefore its mass,
if before it was poor and liveless, does nimbly ferment within its vessels,
and being inkindled farther in the heart, acquires a more intense heat, yea,
and a deeper color; for it is so observed, in many affected with the dropsy,
arising from white phlegm, the Pica or evil longings, or green sickness, to
have a pale countenance, cold blood, and waterish; but by the use of steel, the
countenance soon to be more florid, and the blood to be imbued with a more
intense tincture, and heat: moreover, from the filing of iron, dissolved in the
ventricle, also Saline particles are brought forth, and often they bestow a
more plentiful fruit or increase, both on the solid parts, and on the humors;
for since their natures are vitriolick, and stiptic or binding, they bind
together, and strengthen the too lax, and weakened fibers of the Viscera, and so
restore the broken tone: Besides these Saline particles, inhibit the force of
the blood; repress it from too much heat, and boiling up, and froth, and retain
it in an equal circulation: Besides (which is their chief virtue) they
contract and straiten the too loose, open, and gaping little mouths of the
Arteries; that, for that reason, neither the Serum, nor the bloody latex, may
sweat out, or be broke off, from the file of its circuit: Wherefore in the
Dropsy, and great bleedings, Remedies, imbued with the Saline particles of
Iron, are of famous and efficacious use, for very many Diseases proceed from
this cause, forasmuch as the little mouths of the Arteries, being too open, and
the interspaces of the vessels above measure loosned, the serum or bloody
latex breaks forth; which kind of Affections, the Vitriollic Particles of
Steel, do often help, by binding and corroborating, the sanguiferous Vessels,
and nervous fibers.

After this manner, the filings of Steel, being taken inwardly, seems at once
to add to the blood, both spurs, and a bridle. But forasmuch, as from this
medicine, an incitation, much more than a restriction, does arise, therefore it
ought to be given only to them, whose blood is very thick, and cold, as country
people and strong persons; in very hot, and spirituous blood, and in hot
inwards, it is no ways convenient: moreover, in delicate persons, and men of a
more tender constitution, it is dangerous, lest the little portions of the
steel, when they cannot be sufficiently dissolved, should like fragments of
glass, be driven into the membranes of the Viscera, and there pertinaciously
sticking, produce some ulcer, or deadly torments, which indeed I have known
sometimes to happen.

2. After the filing of Iron, the next way of preparing it, is calcining it
with Sulphur, to wit, let thin pieces of steel, being strongly fired, be laid
upon a roler of Sulphur, that the mettle may melt into little round balls,
which are to be calcined to the consumption of the Sulphur, and pounded in a
mortar, are to be reduced into a subtle powder, which is of choice use. In this
preparation of Iron, some sulphurous particles are exhaled, the sign of which
is, that this powder, an acid liquor being poured upon it, much less boyls up,
or grows hot than the limature or filing of Iron: but being taken by the same
mouth, it excites a Sulphurous savor. In the mean time, in this preparation,
the saline particles, seem to be somewhat augmented, by new ones sticking to
them, from the metal burning with Sulphur, so that active particles of either
kind, to wit, Sulphurous and Saline, come almost to an Aequilibrium: and when
by this means, this medicine, the substance of the mettle being loosned, may be
finely poudered, it becomes of far more excellent use, than the filings of
Iron: In most Cases, where steel ought to be given in substance, as in a
Cachexie or a fullness of evil humors, the longings of maids or the
green-gckness, and such like, this medicine is convenient to be used.

3. In the third place, follows the preparation of steel with vinegar: to wit,
the filings of the whole steel, is moysten'd with vinegar, and dried, till it
may be reduced into an impalpable powder: in this preparation, the Sulphurous
particles are yet much more, yea, as to the greatest part evaporated, only a
few being left, in the mean time, the Saline, by reason of others sticking to
them, from the vinegar, are much increased, which are mingled with the terrene
particles: This chalibiated powder, very little or nothing froths, or boyles
up, a sharp liquor being sprinkled upon it, also being taken at the mouth, has
with it scarce any sulphurous Savor: wherefore, it conduces less, to the
taking away of the obstructions of the Bowels, or to the restoring the ferment
of the blood: nevertheless, in a more hot Constitution, in hemorrhages or
fluxes of Blood, and the hypochondriac Distemper, it is wont to be administered
with greater success, then the former preparations.

4ly. Follows the rust of Iron, which being an extract of the metallic body,
seems to be as it were a fifth Essence: because, in this excrescency, some
particles of every kind, to wit, sulphurous, saline, and terrene, being
loosned from the whole substance, are combined among themselves; and constitute
as it were a new mixture, more subtle, and defaecated or clearer from dreggs:
For that in this concrete, there remains less particles of sulphur, therefore
it does not so potently ferment the blood, or take away the obstructions of the
Viscera, as steel prepared with sulphur; but in more hot distempers of the
parts, or humors, it egregiously performs the requisite Intentions, of a
steeled Medicine.

To this Class may be referred by right, our preparation of steel, to wit, in
which all the particles of the metal, being loosned from the bond of mixture,
are contained together: which notwithstanding, (the concrete being first
reduced into powder) and immediately dissolved, in any water or Menstruum. This
powder being inwardly taken has the like virtue as steel prepared with
sulphur; but to the liquor or menstruum, in which it is dissolved, it imparts
almost only saline, or chiefly vitriolic particles, the sulphurous flying
away, and the terene sinking to the bottom. I am wont to give in great
quantity, and not seldom with excellent success, common water impregnated with
the dissolution of this, instead of the natural acidulous or spawish waters:
moreover, I make thereof medicated wine, beer, cider, whey, or other Liquors,
this powder being dissolved in them; and prescribe them to be taken, for
several intricate Intentions: So much for the preparations of Iron, in which
the elementary particles of every kind, are comprehended in a various
proportion: There remain others, in which the particles almost only of one
kind, to wit, the saline, or earthie, are left, the rest, as to the greatest
part, being driven forth: of which sort, are chiefly vitriol, or the Salt of
steel.

5. For the making the vitriol of steel, first, the metal is wont to be eaten
through, with a very sharp and corrosive Liquor, and to be dissolved into
elementary parts: In the dissolving, the saline particles of the menstruum, are
joined to the other salines of the Iron, and are with them intimately combined;
in the mean time, the remaining sulphurous, and terrene, being laid aside, and
excluded from their company; then common water being poured to this solution,
the salts of either kind being combined, are imbibed by the Liquor, and that
being lastly filtrated, and evaporated, they are reduced into christalls. This
kind of making of salt or salification, succedes, if you do it, either with
the Spirit of vitriol, the oil of sulphur, or stygian water, or any others,
distilled from the stagmas of mineralls: Yea, Sal Ammoniac only, being soluted
by melting, dissolves Iron after the same manner, and causes it to Chrystalize.

Salt of Steel thus prepared, has a sweetish taste, with a certain sharp
stipticity of binding, and participates much of the nature of vitriol, that it
seems not to differ much from Verdigrease. Taken inwardly for a medicine, it
somewhat ferments the humors, and powerfully binds the nervous fibers: for
cold Cachecical, and Phlegmatic people, this medicine is not convenient,
because there are in it no particles of Sulphur: but it is often administered
with success, in hot distempers of the bowels, where there is a predominancy
of adust Sulphur and in wandering effervescencies, in scorbutical, and unequal
heats, both of the blood and nervous stock, by it self, or mixed with other
medicines, as an enforcement: but yet in more tender Constitutions, it is
dangerous, lest the tone and fibers of the ventricle should be hurt, by its
acrimony, and too great constriction or astringency.

6. In the last place, follows the astringent Crocus Martis, or the Crocus of
Steel, prepared by fire, through a long Calcination, viz. The filings, the
off-scourings, or thin plates of Iron, should be so placed in a reverberating
furnace, that they may be continually heated, by a most strong flame: The
filing being thus exposed to the naked fire; first of all it grows reddish, and
runs together into little hard round balls; but after 3. or 4. days, swelling
up suddenly into an higher heap, it becomes extreme light, impalpable, and of a
most curious purple Color: In this preparation, the Sulphurous and saline
particles, whilst by the force of the fire, they begin to come away from the
concreet, do mutually take hold one of another, and so being combined together,
grow into little balls; but afterward, those particles, both Saline and
Sulphurous, being wholly profligated, and fiery particles succeeding in their
place, the whole mass swelling up into a bulk, and made as it were spungie,
becomes most light.

A Medicine thus prepared, in some Cases, is of most excellent use, and second
to none of the Chalybeats: to wit, almost in all extravasations, or too great
eruptions of the Serum and blood, as in outward haemorrhages, or in inward
bleedings, in the Diarrhaea, the Diabatis, and in a vehement Catarrh; also I
have known no remedy better than this, in the Ascitis, or in the beginning of a
Dropsy: and this also, I have heard to be highly approved of lately by a most
famous and expert Physician, of our own Country: Concerning which medicine
notwithstanding, since it is wholly destitute, both of Saline and sulphurous
Particles, and consists almost only of earthly and fiery particles, it is very
ambiguous, by what faculty it operates, and produces so praiseworthy an effect
in man's body: for there seems to be in this, left no more Caput mortuum, or
dead head, or terra damnata, then in vitriol, or in any of the other mettalls,
distilled be a most intense fire. As to this if I may Conjecture, it seems
first, that to this preparation, some Activity is due, whereby it exerts it
self, and unfolds its virtues, either by shutting up obstructions, or by
binding together the Vessels, or nervous fibers of the Viscera, from the fiery
particles, shut up in the most fixed earth, and from them breaking forth within
the body: But the chiefest reason of helping consists in this, that the earthy
particles, the Saline (by which they were strickly held) being wholly gone,
desire greedily to be reunited to them, or such like: Wherefore, this Crocus
martis, being immersed in our Bodies, snatches to it self, whatsoever Salts it
meets with, and intimately binds them, and so, while it sucks up like a sponge,
very many saline particles, it takes away many enormities, arising chiefly from
the flux of the Salts. By this means, Burnt hartshorn, Spodium, and Antimony
Diaphoretic, when they bring help exert or put forth their virtues.

CHAPTER. XII. Of the Convulsive Cough and Asthma.
An example of a Cough merely Convulsive.
THe history before related, does clearly manifest, that sometimes a Cough may
be caused, without any great fault of the Lungs, by reason of the sliding down
of the morbific matter, upon the pneumonick nerves, or those belonging to
respiration: to wit, where it was shown, in the Case of the noble Virgin,
laboring with Convulsive fits, and also with a grievous and continual
giddiness, that, when by the prescript of the Physician, a fomentation of
Cephalic Decoction, was applied to her head, presently the Giddiness ceased,
and in its place followed a great Cough, without any Spitting, but night and
day, almost perpetually troubling her: which without doubt happened, by reason of
the Convulsive matter, being driven from the brain, into the beginnings of the
nerves: This kind of example, of a Cough merely Convulsive, more rarely
happens, in persons of ripe years, as the like distemper I have not often seen:
But in children it is usual, This distemper frequent enough in children.
(also sometimes I have known it in Men) for a cough to arise, from a serous
Colluvies overflowing the Lungs: which, when at first it was Simple, and
moderate, afterward it became vehement, and Convulsive; so that in Coughing
the Diaphragma being drawn upwards, and held in a long Systole, or frequently
repeated, the Lungs being greatly straightened, were much hindered in their motion.
In the mean time, by reason of the breathing being hindered, and the blood being
restrained within the Praecordia, and for that cause stagnating in other
places, the sick were in danger of being choked, and often acquired a livid,
or dead countenance. But in this Case, besides the Convulsions raised up about
the Praecordia, by the force of Coughing, the Ventricle also, being often
brought Into a consent, cast forth by vomit, whatever it contained in its
bosom: yea, and I know in some tender ones, after this manner affected, the
Disease wandering from thence into other parts, did raise up Convulsive motions
in the Face, eyes, and limbs, and at length became deadly. This kind of
Convulsive Cough is very frequent among children, and some years lays hold on
so many, that it seems to be plainly Epidemical; when it roots it self, it is
very difficult to be cured, by Remedies, yea often being long protracted, it is
hardly otherwise to be cured, but by the state of the year being changed.

If the causes of the aforesaid Case be inquired into, it will be so plain, The
reason of it.
to refer the procatartic or more remote cause, to the redundancy of the Serous
humor in the bloody mass, and in some sort in the whole body; a portion of
which matter, dropping forth from the little mouths of the Arteries, on the
Lungs, creates the ordinary Cough; afterward, when the serous Colluvies or
heap of waters yet exuberateing in the Blood, and stuffed with Convulsive
particles, is also heaped up within the head, the same entering the pneumonic
nerves, increases the simple, into a Convulsive Cough: For when those nerves,
being irritated first about their extremities, are exercised above measure, for
that reason they more easily imbibe the Convulsive matter, laid up nigh their
beginnings: and so, when at length, they are driven into irregular motions, in
two places, to wit, in the head, and at the tale, and that for two distinct
causes, viz. from the irritation of the Spirits, and from their explosion; it
is no wonder, if the Cough, at first Common, being afterward brought into this
evil state, becomes so cruel and Convulsive: Moreover, when it sometimes
happens, that the same matter, heaped up in the head, does enter some other
nerve, therefore Convulsive passions of another manner, often come upon the
Convulsive Cough.

Having shown after this manner, that a cough does arise, not only, The
Convulsion Asthma.
nor always by the fault of the Lungs, but sometimes from a solitary Convulsive
cause, but oftener superinduced by this, on a pneumatic Distemper: also we do
not doubt to determine almost the same thing, concerning another certain
Distemper of the Thorax, to wit, the Asthma: For whether this Disease be
continual, or periodical, in either Case, the Symptom chiefly urging, is
difficult Breathing; Sometimes it, depends of the Lungs, together with the
nerves being affected.
which indeed seems to be excited for this reason, because the Lungs being too
much inflated, and distended, extremely fills the Cavity of the Thorax, neither
do they fall down as they should do, by turns: hence the Spirit or breath
remaining within, is not sent forth freely enough, neither indeed can fresh
air be easily induced, by reason the space is before filled: whilst the Lungs
are so longer contained in a continual, or very little remiss Diastole,
oftentimes the Diaphragma, is urged contrary to its manner, into a violent
Systole, and being drawn upwards, is wont more and more to lift up the Lungs,
and to hinder their falling down; whereby it comes to pass, that respiration
becoms yet more difficult, and more laborious.

We easily believe, that this kind of hard breathing Distemper, does sometimes
happen by the fault of the Lungs, because anatomical Inspection has plainly
detected it: For if a great Serous Colluvies, being laid up in the Thorax, very
much stuffs the Lungs, and so much obstructs all their pores and passages, that
the blood being hindered in its Circute, cannot freely pass through the Pneumonic
Vessels, for that reason indeed, such like anhelous Distempers are sometimes
made: Then, as often as the blood growing more hot and rarefied, by exercise or
the heat of the Bed, requires a larger space for its Circulation, within the
Lungs; then presently from such an occasion, a more frequent Respiration, or an
asthmatical fit is stirred up: If beside this morbid Disposition of the Breast,
the Sanguineous mass, also abounding with a serous water, should be apt to
sudden fluxions and effervescencies of the Serum, from hence also, by reason of
the violent course of the Serum growing hot, into the Lungs, being before
obstructed, and greatly filled, very often most grievous assaults of this
Disease, and almost suffocating do happen. Moreover, sometimes, beside, the
roots of the asthma (as it is said) being fixed about the Praecordia, certain
shoots of the same disease, budding forth from the head, meet with the former,
and being complicated with them, produce the more cruel fruits of the Dyspnaea,
or want of Breath. For, because the Lungs being stuffed with Serum, another
quantity of the same, more largely redounding in the blood, being imbued with
Convulsive particles, is poured on the head, the same more readily entering the
pneumonic nerves, than others, causes the Asthma of the Thorax, at first Simple
and modetate, to become periodically vehement, and Convulsive.

Of these kind of Distempers, viz. the Dyspnaea, being excited by the singular
fault of the Lungs, and with a Companion, very many instances, and examples
have fallen under our observation, and do almost daily happen. For there is
nothing more usual, then for those that are sick of an inveterate cough, or any
other evil disposition of the Lungs, at length the Dropsy, or Scurvie happening
to become Asthmatick, to wit, when the Blood being made much more impure, lays
up also its serous dreggs in the head, these more readily, and indeed more
easily enter then others, the pneumonic nerves, as being weaker, and often
irritated near their extremities, and in them do heap up matter, for a
Convulsive Dyspnaea.

An Asthma sometimes merely Convulsive proceeds from the nerves only being
affected.
Further, sometimes I have observed, most grievous fits of an Asthma to have
happened, without any notable fault of the Lungs, so that truly I did think that
this disease was sometimes merely Convulsive, and its fits only excited,
because the serous colluvies or watery heap, being stufft with, explosive
particles, entering into the nerves, performing the Diastole of the Lungs, grows
to the Spirits therein flowing, which being afterward struck off together, and
for a long while, by reason of plentitude or irritation, the Lungs are detained
as it were inflated, and stiff, so that they can perform neither the offices of
drawing in, or of breathing out: But the fit being finished, a free and equal
respiration followed, as before the fit began, and no cough, or signs of a
sickly disposition of the Lungs, did appear. As I have observed this kind of
Dyspnaea or difficult breathing merely Convulsive, to have happened in many, I
will here show you one or two histories of it.

A certain strong and fat Gentleman, having used for some time a more full and
inordinate Diet, without any exercise, began to be ill about the beginning of
the winter: at first he was troubled with a pain and heaviness of his head,
with a grear giddiness, and fear of swoonding, and believing himself just about
to dye, being otherways healthful; within a few days, these Symptoms passed
into an apparent Stupor, or rather Lethargy: he being let blood in his Arm, I
caused carefully to be applied Cupping-glasses, Vesicatories, and sharp
Clysters, with many other Remedies: In the space of 42. hours coming to
himself, he was sensible, and shook off all torpor or drousiness. But although
his brain was cleared, yet he was taken with a great weakness, and numbness in
his members which Distempers however were shortly cured, with antiparyletic and
antiscorbutic Remedies: But after a fortnight, he began again to complain of an
heaviness and giddiness in his head, then the next day after, he fell into a
horrid Asthma: that the Lungs being suddenly inflated, and endeavoring to come
upwards, the Breath, which was very quick and laborious, was hindered, and not
being able to come forth, he was in danger every minute of an hour to be
choked. This fit as it was cruel, so it passed over within 12. hours, without
any spitting, cough, or vomit, and then, within a weeks space, he lost all the
trouble of his breast; but then the like fit of the Dyspnaea or difficult
breathing returning, exercised him somewhat more gently; and afterward, he was
wont to be troubled with such a fit of the Asthma, nigh to the great mutations
of the Air, chiefly in great cold, or the falling of Snow.

Vertigo, then at another time, being free from those Symptoms, he was taken
with a most cruel fit of the Asthma, and he endured these Distempers, now
this, now that, frequently, but especially about the greater tropicks of the
year.

The Reason.
It is not to be doubted, but in the aforesaid Cases, those fits of the Asthma
did wholly depend, on the Convulsive matter, being fallen into the nerves,
serving to the stretching forth of the Lungs, which cleaving to the Spirits,
and being by them struct off, or explosed, by reason of plentitude or
irritation, caused the Praecordia to be lifted uywards, and as it were
inflated, and by that means hindered, from its reciprocal motion.

An Asthma sometimes exciteed by reason of the Bronchia being Convulsively
affected.
Moreover, we suppose, that such a kind of Convulsive Dyspnaea or difficult
breathing, is sometimes excited, by reason of the bronchia of the Trachea (or
the sharp arteries of the Throat) being too much straightened, and often almost
drawn together: we have shown in our discourse of the Nerves, that very many
branches of nervous fibers, and of the nerves, do every where embrace all the
ramifications of the asper Artery, and bind them about, which nerves if it
happen, that they, being possessed by the morbific matter, should be irritated
into frequent Convulsions, for that reason it follows, that the channells or
passages which they compass about, must be greatly bound together, and in some
places wholly shut up.

There was a very choice Virgin, of a tender constitution, and of a flourishing
i e. about 12. years old) that began to be grievously tormented with Asthma
fits; and before she was entrusted to my cure, she had lived obnoxious to them
at least 4. years. sometimes she remained free, from any fit of this disease,
for two or three months: yet oftentimes, by reason of errors in Diet, or the
great mutations of the year, or the air, she fell into most cruel fits of the
Dyspnaea or difficult breathing: So that her Lungs being inflated, and carried
upwards toward her throat, and there held almost in a continual Diastole, she
could hardly, nay, not at all breathe; in the mean time, for that respiration
might be somehow made, the Diaphragma and the muscles of the breast were
exercised with repeated endeavors of motions. This kind of fit by degrees
remitting, within 7 or 8. hours, at length gave over; but then after a week or
two, it was wont to come again, either of it self, or from any the least
occasion; after that the force of the Disease, its matter being bestowed on
very many of these kind of fits, passed away, this excellent virgin was well
enough for many weeks, yea sometimes months after, and breathed freely, without
any fault of the Thorax. For this person, I instituted this following method,
Spring and fall, and now it is more than two years, since she has had any fit
of this Distemper.

Take of our Sulphur of Antimony, gr. vi. of Cream of tartar, vi, grains, mix
them: Let it be given in the pap of a roasted apple, with this medicine she was
wont to vomit 4. or 5. times: four days after, she took this cathartic, which
was wont to be repeated, twice, after 6. or 7. days between: Take Calomelun
xii. grains, of the Resin of Jolop, v. grains, of castor gr. iiii. with what
will suffice of Ammoniac dissolved, make iii. pills: every day besides, she
took morning and evening, of the tincture of Antimony, grains xii. in a
Spoonful of the following Julap, drinking after it 6. or 7. Spoonfulls of the
same. Take of the water of Snailes, vi. of earthworms iiii. of water of
pennyroyal, and rue, each, iii. of hysterical water, iii. of Castor tied in a
knot, and hung in the glass, ss. of white-sugar i. mix them in the glass, and
make a Julap.

About the Autumn of the last year, another noble Virgin, being sick after the
same manner, viz. with a Periodical Asthma, I was sent for to cure her,

In these Cases also, nothing seems to appear more clearly, than that the cause
of the Disease, without any phlegm or viscous humor, being impacted in the
Lungs, as is commonly believed, does subsist within the nervous stock; and that
this kind of Dyspnaea or difficult breathing, merely convulsive, is excited, by
reason of the Pneumonic nervs, being possessed by the Convulsive Distemper. The
verity of this may be yet more clearly evinced, by an anatomical observation,
An Anatical Observation
lately Comunicated to me, by the learned Physician Doctor Walter Needham. That
most famous man told me, that he knew a Butcher of Wallsallen in the County of
Stafford, who when he had been long sick of a periodical Asthma, returning
within 14. or 20 days at farthest, at length he dyed in a fit. The Body being
opened, all his Viscera appeared sound, chiefly his Lungs, neither were there
to be seen any signs, either of excrement gathered together in the Bronchia,
or of the blood restagnating in the veins; this only happened besides nature,
that the bladder of the gall; contained in it many stones. But (added he) the
causes unknown to us, certainly not Conspicuous to our eyes, were to be
attributed to the nervous stock being affected.

Sometime past I was consulted with, about a noble child, Anoiher Anatomical
Observation.
who being about 12. months old, was grieviously afflicted with Convulsion
fits, and as it were Epileptic, of which he quickly dyed. I often observed,
that whilst the Convulsion of the outward parts intermitted, he was taken with
a cruel sobbing, or hooping Cough: from whence I suspected, that the morbific
matter, was no less fixed in the breast, than in the brain. But after its
Death, the body being opened, the Lungs well furnished, appeared clear from any
fault, that it clearly appeared that this cough merely Convulsive, was excited
by reason of the Distemper of the nervous stock.

As to what respects the Remedies, and curatory means, which ought to be used
in the aforesaid cases, when that convulsive Symptoms come upon the Cough, or
difficulty of breathing, first excited from the default of the Lungs, and so by
reason of the taint, communicated to the brain; it must be carefully heeded,
that Convulsive medicines be aptly compounded, with those respecting all the
Intentions of the Thorax. Yea that sometimes these, sometimes those, being
given by themselves, may between whiles fill up the times of curing, it will
not be needful in this place, to bring the bechic, or Pneumonic medicines, and
forms of them, since an immense company of them, are extant every where, among
Physical Authors. It will be sufficient for our purpose, to add a method of
medicine, also some more select Remedies, convenient for the Cough, and Asthma,
merely Convulsive.

The cure of the Convulsive Cough.
As to the former Distemper, which is most familiar to children, the cure is
difficult, and for the most part not to be performed, but of a long time. The
chief Indications, will be to purge forth, both the serous and sharp humors,
from the blood and Viscera, that their inclination and falling down in the
brain, and perhaps also within the breast, may be sometimes prevented; then to
Corroberate those parts that they may not easily admit the superfluities, of
the boiling Serum. For these ends, vomits and more gentle purges, for the most
part are useful, and in some measure ought to be repeated: Vesecatories are
often profitable; yea, if the Disease be contumacious, Issues are to be made in
the nape of the neck, or the arm, or about the Armpits. Drink and liquid
aliments, are to be taken in a lesser quantity, than usual, and in stead of
them, a Bochet is to be used, of Sarsa, China, Sanders, Shavings of Ivory, and
hartshorn, with diuretic, and anticonvulsive Ingredients: In this Case, some
remedies as it were special, are greatly commended, of which sort are pixed
musk, given in powder, or boiled in milk, and so given daily in a frequent
dose: a decoction or Syrrop of Castor, and Saffron; decoctions of the root of
Paony, Misletow of the Oak, also of hyssop, help many; the waters of
black-cherries, of Saxifrage, and of Snailes, distilled with Whey, and
appropriate ingredients, are often taken with success.

The cure of the Convulsive Asthma.
2. By what method, and with what Remedies, I have cured the periodical Asthma
in some young ones, has been already shown, But in most, distempered with this
Disease the most famous Riverius has observed, a vomit is chiefly helpful,
although he has not rightly shown the reason: which indeed seems to consist in
this, to wit, that this medicine, greatly shaking, and irritation the
Emunctories, planted about the first Passages, strongly presses out from them,
and carries forth of doors, the recrements of the blood and nervous juice, apt
to be troublesome, and to restagnate on the brain, and Nervous stock. Zacutus
the Lusitanian, highly extolls, and not without reason, a cautery to be made,
sometimes in the hinder part of the head, sometimes in the nape of the neck, or
about the Armpits: A preparation of milipedes, viz. in form of a dry powder, or
a distilled Liquor, seldom wants success. For by such like Remedies, the
superfluities of the Serum, are deduced from the head, and nervous stock, and
carried away, through the urinary passages: For the same reason, a gentle purge,
evacuating the ill juice, is often used: for this end, the decoction of an old
Cock, with altering medicines, and gently purging, being stowed in its belly, is
praised by many: Besides, the remedies hitherto cited, some others are said to
be appropriate, and as it were Specifical to the Asthma, of which sort are, the
balsom of Sulphur, turpintin'd, also Spirits of Hartshorn, or of Sut,
impregnaeed with the same; Syrop of Tobacco, of Ammoniack, our diasulphur
Lohoch of Garlic, pills of the roots of Enula Campane made up with the milk of
Sulphur; with the flowers of Benzoin, with liquid pitch, or liquid amber, with
many others, which would be too tedious here to enumerate.

And now the chief Species, and manners of Convulsions, together with the
Causes of the Symptoms, and the means of curing, being sufficiently explicated,
it is time to put an end to this our Pathologie of the Brain and nervous stock,
and to our Discourse of Convulsive Diseases.
