An Elegy upon the Earl of ESSEX'S Funeral.
ANd are these all the rites that must be done,
Thrice Noble Essex, Englands Champion:
Some men, some walls, some horses put in black,
With the throng scrambling for sweetmeats and Sack,
A gaudy Herald, and a velvet Hearse,
A tatt'red Anagram with grievous verse,
And a sad Sermon to conclude withal,
Shall this be styled great Essexs Funeral?
Niggardly Nation, be ashamed of th^ods,
Less valor among Heathen made men Gods,
Should such a General have died in Rome,
He must have had an Altar* not a Tomb,
And there instead of youthful Elegies,
Grave Senators had offered sacrifice
To divine Devereux: o for a vote
(Ye Lords and Commons ye are bound to do it)
A vote that who is seen to smile this year,
A vote, that who so brings not in a tear,
Shall be adjudg'd Malignant: It were wise
T'erect an Office in the Peoples eyes
For issuing forth a constant sum of tears;
There Is no way else to pay him his arrears.
And when we have drein'd this Ages eyes quite dry,
Let him be wept the next* in History,
Which if Posterity shall dare to doubt,
Then Glosters whispering walls shall speak him out:
And so his Funeral shall not be done,
Till he return in the Resurrection.
