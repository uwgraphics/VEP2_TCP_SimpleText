The History of Mother Shipton
CHAP. I.
Of Mother Shiptons strange Parentage, and t^^ place of her Birth.

MOTHER SHIPTON (as all Histori^^ agee) was a Yorkshire woman; b^^ the
particular place is very mu^^ disputed, because several Towns have pretended to
the honor of her Birth; But the m^^^ credible and received opinion ascribes it
(...) Nascborough, near the dropping Well, in the Cou^ty aforesaid: concerning
her Pedigree or Pare^tage there is likewise very various Report^^ Some say,
that her Father was a Necromanc^^ and that skill in the Black Art thereby
becam^ entailed upon her by inheritance; but the common Story (which therefore
I shall follow, yet without forcing the Reader to believe it whe^^er he will or
no) is, That she never had any ^^^ther of humane Race, or mortal wight, but
(...) as begot (as the great Welsh Prophet Merlin (...) as of old) by the
Phantasm of Apollo, or some ^^anton Airial Doemon, in manner following.

Her Mother (whom some Records call A^atha, and others Emmatha) being left an
Or^^an about the Age of sixteen, very poor, and ^uch troubled with that
grievous, but com^on disease, called by some Idleness, and by ^^thers Sloth; as
she was once upon a time sit^^ng, bemoning her self on a shady bank by the
^ighway side, this spirit appeared to her in the ^^ape of a very handsome young
man, and smi^^ng on her, Pretty maid, quoth he, why do ^^ou sit so sad? Thou
art not old enough to have ^^y Head pestered with the cares of the World;
^^ithee tell me the business, and doubt not but I ^ill help thee out of all thy
troubles. The Maid ^or Maids there were in those days at her age) ^^sting up
her eyes, and not suspecting a devil ^^d in so comely a countenance, related to
him ^^r wants, and that she knew not how to live; pish! said he, that is
nothing, but be ruled by and thou shall never lack; she hearing him p^^mise so
fairly, told him she would; and the^^ upon to draw her in by degrees to
destructi^^ he first tempted her to Fornication, and p^^vailed so far as to
gain her, but his Touch^^ as she afterward confessed to the Midwi^^ were as
cold as Ice or Snow. From this ti^^ forward she was commonly once a day vi^^ted
by her Hellish Gallant, and never want^^ money, for still as she swept the
House, s^^ should find some odd pieces, as Ninepence^^ Quarters of
thirteen-pence-half-pennys, a^^ the like, sufficient to supply all her occasion.

CHAP. 2.
How Mother Shiptons Mother proved wi^^ child; How she fitted the severe
Justice, a^^ what happened at her delivery.

THe Neighbors observing Agatha without any Employ to live so handsomely,
wo^dred exceedingly how she came by it, but w^^ more surprised shortly
afterward, when th^^ perceived her to be with child, which she co^^ not long
hide, for before her delivery, she was (...) big as if she had gone with half a
dozen ^^ildren at once; whereupon she was carried be^^re a Justice, who chid
and threatened her for her ^^continency, but he was soon silenced, for ^^s Wife
and all his Family being present, A^atha said to him aloud, Mr. Justice,
gravely ^^u talk now, and yet the truth is, your Wor^^ip is not altogether
free, for here stands Two (...) your Servant wenches, that are both at this
^ime with Child by you; pointing to them se^erally with her finger: at which
both himself and the two Girls were so blank, that his wife ^lainly saw what
she said was true, and there^^re fell upon two poor Harlots like a fury, so
^^ll Mr. Justice and the Constable could do was ^ot enough to keep the peace,
and the whole ^amily was in such confusion, that Agatha for ^^at time was
dismissed, and soon after was ^ought to bed in the Month of July, in the 4. ^ear
of the Reign of K. Henry the 7th. which as in the year of our Lord, 1488. Her
Travel as very grievous, and a most terrible Clap of ^hunder happened just as she
was delivered of this strange birth, which afterward was so ^^mous by the name
of Mother Shipton. N^^ could the Tempest affright the women mo^^ than the
prodigious Physiognomy of t^^ Child; the body was long, but very big bone great
gogling eyes, very sharp and fiery, a No^ of unproportionable length, having in
it ma^^ crooks and turnings, adorned with gre^^ pimples, which like vapors of
brimstone ga^^ such a luster in the night, that her Nurse ne^ded no other
Candle to dress her by; and besides this uncouth shape, it was observed, th^^
as soon as the was born, she fell a laughi^^ and grinning after a jeering
manner, and immediately the Tempest ceased.

CHAP. 3.
By what name mother Shipton was christen and how her Mother went into a
Monastery

THE Child being thus brought into (...) World, under such strange circumstanc^
was (though not without some oppositie^, ordered at last by the Abbot of
Beverly to (...) christened, which was performed by the name Vrsula Soothtell:
for the later was her mo^^ers, and consequently her Maiden Surname and as for
Shipton, it was the name of her hus^and, whom she afterward married; as wi^^
^^pear in the sequel of this History: and in this ^articular most of the
Authors I Have Read have ^een foully mistaken. But to proceed, When ^e was about
two years old, her Mother co^ing to be sensible of her evil, in holding a
cor^^spondency with a wicked spirit, applying her If to several Religious men
of great note in ^^ose times, by whose grave advice she grew ^uly penitent, and
(according to the fashion ^f that Ages Devotion) put her self into a
^ighbouring Monastery, having first put out ^^r Child with a piece of Money to
a friend, ^^d so spent the remainder of her days in the ^^mous Covent of the
order of St. Bridget, near ^ottingham, in prayers and tears, and other acts
(...) Penance, to expiate the wickedness of her ^uth; but wonderful it is to
relate the trou^^s that befell the Nurse she was put to, for her ^ther, the foul
Fiend, is reported several times (...) have visited her, particularly one day
the ^^rse having been abroad, when she returned she found her door open,
whereupon fearin^ ^he was Robbed, she called three or four neighbors and their
Wives to go into the house with her, but before they got well into the Entry,
they heard a strange noise, as if ther^ had been a thousand Cats in consort,
which s^ dismayed them, that they all ran toward the door, endeavoring to get
out again, but in vai^ for every one of them had got Yokes on their Necks, that
they could not possibly return, bu^ soon after the Yokes fell off, and then a
Could staff was laid on 2 of the men's shoulders, upon which an old woman
presented her sel^ stark naked, sometimes hanging by the heels sometimes by the
Toes, anon by the middle with diverse other postures, while the women having all
their coats turned over their ears exposed their shame to public view, and s^^
continued till a Friar accidentally came to th^^ house, and then they was
suddenly released but still the child having been taken out of the Cradle,
could not be found, till at last one of the company looking by chance up the
chimny, sa^^ it stark naked, sitting astride upon the Iro^ to which the
Pot-hooks was fastened, whenc^ they took it down without the least hurt, and ^o
far from being frighted, that it seemed by ^ts monstrous smiles to be very well
pleased at ^hese pleasant Exploits.

CHAP. 4.
Several other merry pranks played by Mother Shipton, in Revenge to such as
abused her.

AS our Vrsula grew up to riper years, she was often affronted, by reason of
her deformity, but she never failed to be revenged on those that did it: As one
day all the chief of the Parish being together at a merry meeting, she ^oming
thither occasionally on an Errand, ^ome of them abused her by calling her, The
Devils Bastard, and Hag-face, and the like; whereupon she went away grumbling,
but so ^rdered affairs, that when they was set down (...) Dinner, one of the
principal Yeomen, that ^hought himself spruce and fine, had in an in^^ant his
Ruff (which in those days they wore) ^ull'd off, and the Seat of an House of
Office ^lapt in its place; he that sat next him burst^ng out into a laughter
at the sight hereof, was served little better, for his Hat was invisibly
conveyed away, and the Pan of a Close ^^ool which stood in the next Room, put
on instead thereof. Besides this, a modest young Gentlewoman that sat at the
Table at the same time, looking at these two worthy specta^les of mirth,
endeavored all she could to Re^^rain laughing, but could not, and withal
continued breaking of wind backward for above a quarter of an hour together,
like so many broad-sides in a Sea Fight, which made all the company laugh so
extremely, that the Master of the house (being the chief Inn in the town) was
alarmed below therewith, and desirous to share with his Guests in their mirth,
came running up Stairs as fast as his Legs would ^arry him, but being about to
enter the door, he could not, and no wonder, since the oldest Man living never
saw a larger pair of Horns than he had on his Head: But whilst they were gazing
on one another, as more than half distracted, they were all reduced to the same
condition they were in at first, after which followed a noise, as if more than
a hundred persons were laughing together, but nothing was seen.

CHAP. V.
How Ursula married a young man named To^^ Shipton, and strangely discovered a
Thief.

OUr Vrsula was now arrived at the Fou^ and twentieth year of her age, and th^^
she was none of the prettiest Maids in the Town, as you may remember by her
description, yet she longed for an husband as much a^ the best of them, and at
last obtained her desir^ For whether she used any Love-powder o^ charms to
enamour him, or whether the hop^^ of getting some money, which she was reported
to have, though no body could tell how she should come by it, caused him to court
her, (a^ some men there are that would not only marry the Devils daughter, but
his dam too for money) I cannot certainly inform the Reader^ but a Sweetheart
she had, named Toby Shipton ^y Trade a Carpenter, to whom she was short^^ ^y
after married, and very comfortably they ^^ved together, but never had any
children* It happened about a Month after her marriag^ ^^ne of her Neighbors
leaving her door carelessly open, lost a new Smock and Petticoat, ^^oln away
while she was telling a Gossips ^ale of an hour long at next door, whither she
^ent to fetch Fire; which misfortune much ^^oubling her, she made her moan to
our Mo^her Shipton, who did not go about like our little silly Conjurers, with
their Schemes and ^igures to give a blind description of she knew ^ot whom, but
roundly told her such a Wo^an by name had stolen the things, adding, that she
would make her restore them with a ^^ame to her; and so indeed she did; for the
^^xt Market day before all the people this Woman could not avoid putting on the
^mock over her other clothes, and the Petti^oat in her hand, and so marched
through the ^^oud into the Market-cross, where the other ^as by Mother Shiptons
directions to receive them, dancing all the way, and singing these ^ords:

I stole my Neighbors Smock and Coat,
I am a Thief, and here I show't.
And so when she came to the owner, pulled ^ff the Smock, and gave her her own
with a^^ ^everend courtesy, and so departed.

CHAP. 6.
Her Prophecy against Cardinal Woolsey.

BY these and several the like exploits, Mother Shipton had got a name far and
nea^ for a cunning woman, or a woman of the for^sight, so that her words began
to be counte^ Oracles, nor did she meddle only with privat^ persons, but was
advised with concerned people of the greatest Quality; among which number at
that time was Cardinal Woolsey, whe^^ it was reported, that he intended to live
at York* she publicly said, He should never come thither* which coming to his
ear, and being much offended, he caused three Lords to go to her* who came
disguised to Ring-house near York where leaving their men, they took a Guid^
and came to Mother Shipton's, where knocking at her door, she cried out within,
Come (...) Mr. Beasly (their Guide) and those No^^^ Lords with you. Which much
surprised the^ that she should know them, for when the^^ came in, she called
each of them by their nam^ and treated them with Ale and Cakes, whereupon upon
said one of the Lords, If you knew ou^ Errand you would not make so much of us,
you sai^ the Cardinal should never see York. No, sai^ ^he, I said he might see
York, but never come a^ ^t; Well, says the Lord, when he does com^ ^hou shall
be burnt. Then taking off her Lin^en Kerchief from her head, says she, If thi^
^urn, then I may burn; and immediately flung (...) into the fire before them,
but it would not burn, so that after it had lain* in the flames (...) ^^rter of
an hour, she took it out again not so much as singed. Hereupon one of the Lords
^skt her what she thought of him, My Lord, said she, the time is coming when
your Grace will be as low as I am, and that is a low one in^^^ed. Which proved
true, for shortly after ^he was beheaded.

Nor was her speech of the Cardinal less ve^ified, for he coming to Cawood,
went to the ^^p of the Tower, and asked where York was, which ^eing shown him,
he enquired how far it was ^hither, For (quoth. he) there was a Witch said, I
should never see York. Nay, says one present. ^our Eminence is misinformed, she
said you should ^ee it, but not come at it. Then he vowed to burn^ her when he
came there, which was but eight ^iles distant, but behold, immediately he was
^ent for back by the King, and dyed of a vio^ent Looseness at Leicester.

CHAP. 7.
^ome other Prophecies of Mother Shiptons, relating to these times.

AT diverse other times, when persons of Quality came to visit her, she
delivered the se^eral prophecies following, that is to say,

1 Prophecy.

Before Owse-bridge and Trinity-Church meet, ^hey shall build in the day, and
it shall fall in the night, ^ntil they get the highest stone of Trinity-Church
the ^^swest stone of Owse-bridge.

Explanation.

This came to pass: for Trinity Steeple in York was ^own down with a Tempest,
and Owse-bridge bro^en down with a Flood, and what they did in the ^ay-time in
repairing the Bridge, fell down in the ^ight, till at last they laid the
highest Stone of the ^eeple for the Foundation of the Bridge.

2. Prophecy.

The North shall Rue it wondrous sore,
But the South shall Rue it for evermore.
3 Prophecy.

You shall have a year of pining Hunger, and shall no^ ^now of the Wars
overnight, yet shall you have it i^ the Morning, and when it happens, it shall
last thre^ years, then will come a woman with one Eye, and she shall tread in
many men's blood up to the Knee.

4 Prophecy.

Then may a Man take House or Bower, Land o^ Tower for one and twenty years;
but afterward shall be a white Harvest of Corn gotten in by Women; the^ shall
it be, that one Woman shall say to another, Mother, I have seen a Man to day!

Unhappy he that lives to see these days;
But happy are the dead, Shipton's wife says.
5 Prophecy.

A time shall happen, when a Ship shall come sailing up the Thames, till it
come against London, and the Master of the Ship shall weep, and the Mariners of
the Ship shall ask him why he weeps, since he has mad^ so good a Voyage; and
he shall say, Ah! what: goodly City this was, none in the world comparable to
it, and now there is scarce left an House that can let us have drink for our
money.

Explanation.

These last words were sadly verified afte^ the dreadful Fire of London, 1666.
when ther^ was not an House left all along Thames-side from the Tower to the
Temple; As for the words before, they being darkly delivered, ^re not like to
be understood, till time, that ^oth discovers and absconds all things, shall
^ring the matters signified to light.

CHAP. 8.
Her Prophecies in Verse to the Abbot of Beverly.

THe Abbot of Beverly giving her a Visit one day, told her, That as he had
found ^everal things that she had formerly said to be ^xactly true, so he was
persuaded she was not Ig^orant in those which for the future were to in^ue, and
therefore requested her to impart some of ^er foreknowledge to him, for which
Favor ^tho' more than his deserts could command, yet) ^^all he neither want a
Tongue to acknowledge, nor (...) Heart to endeavor a Requital for so great an
^bligation. Mr. Abbot, says she, leave off com^lementing, I am an old Woman,
who will neither ^^^tter, nor be flattered by any, yet shall answer our Desires
as for as I may. And thereupon ^^d in mystic Verses discover to him the
^reatest Accidents that have happened in England, from that day to this, as in
the following Explanations will appear.

Prophecy.
When the Cow does ride the Bull,
Then Priest beware thy Skull.
Explanation.

By the Cow was meant H. 8. who gave the Cow in his Arms as Earl of Richmond,
and the Bull betoken'd Madam Ann of Bulloigne, no^ only as the first syllable
of her name, but because her Father gave the black Bulls-Head i^ his Crest; and
when the King married her immediately after happened the Dissolution o^
Monasteries, and restraints laid on the Priests.

Prophecy.
For a sweet pious Prince make room,
And in each Kirk prepare a Broom.

This is meant of King Edward the sixth, i^ whose time the Protestant Religion
wa^ established, and the Popish Superstition swept out of the Kirk, an old word
used sti^^ in Scotland for the Church.

Prophecy.
Alecto next assumes the Crown,
And streams of blood shall Smithfield drown*

her Cruelty ^o the Protestants, of whom great numbers ^ere then burnt in
Smithfield.

Explanation.

This relates to King James, who having been many Years King of Scotland, the
Crown of England by Queen Elizabeth's Death fell to him, whereupon he came over
Tweed to take up his Residance here, and so joined the two Kingdoms under one
Government. And as for Janus shutting his Gates, you must know Janus was one of
the Heathen gods, that ha^ a Temple at Rome, the Gates of which were never shut
but in times of Peace, alluding to which, our Prophetess here declares the
peaceful Reign of King James.

Prophecy.
Forth from the North shall mischief blow,
And English Hob shall add thereto;
Mars shall rage as he were wood,
And Earth shall drunken be with blood.
Explanation.

This relates to our Late lamentable Civ^ Wars.

Prophecy.
But tell's what is next* Oh cruel Fate,
A King made Martyr at his Gate.
Meaning the Execrable murder of the most Excellent Prince, Charles the First.

The just King dead, the Woolfe shall then
With blood usurp the Lions Den.
But Death shall hurry him away,
Confusion shall a while bear sway,
Till fate to England shall restore
A King to Reign as heretofore;
Who mercy and justice likewise
Shall in his Empire exercise.
These Prophecies we have seen fulfilled ^y Cromwell's Usurpations, the
Committee ^f Safetys Confusions, and our Gracious So^eraign's Miraculous
Restoration.

Prophecy.
Triumphant Death rides London through,
And men on tops of Houses go.
Explanation.

The first Line points out the great Sick^^ss in London, 1665. And the second
the ^eadful Fire the Year following.

Let this suffice, the night comes on,
You must depart, and I be gone;
Apollo does forbid my Rhimes
For to unvail succeeding times.
Having said this, Mother Shipton arose, and the ^dmiring Abbot (who took all
these Prophecies ^ou must conceive, in writing) giving her many Thanks,
returned home.

CHAP. 9.
Of Mother Shiptons Death, Burial, and Epitaph.

THis famous Prophetess continued several years esteemed, as the Sybil or
Oracle of these Times. At last, being Threescore and Thirteen ^ears of Age, she
found the time in the black Book ^f Destiny approaching, wherein she must give
a ^^nal adieu to the World, which she foretold to a ^ay, to diverse people, and
at the hour predicted, ^aving taken solemn leave of her friends, laid ^er self
down on her Bed, and dyed; on whom (...) Poet of this Age bestowed this

EPITAPH.
Here lies she who never ly'd,
Whose Skill so often has been tried;
Her Prophecies shall still survive,
And ever keep her Name alive.
