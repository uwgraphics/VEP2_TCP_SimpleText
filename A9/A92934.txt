The Serious ATTESTATION of many Thousands, Religious and well disposed People,
living in London, Westminster, Borough of Southwark, and parts adjoining.
WHEREAS it pleased the Lord, some years since, to put a Spirit, and
opportunity into the hearts, and hands, of the peoples Representatives in
Parliament; to assert and vindicate their Birthrights in Civills, and their
Libertyes in matters of a Religious Consideration, which had been well nigh
swallowed up in the Tyrannical, and Arbitrary prosecution of Court Principles,
by persons of corrupt Interest, brought in, and continued upon the necks of the
Freemen of England, (viz.) Monarchy, backed with an House of Lords, Spiritual
and Temporal; by whose conjoined Influence the foundations of the Peoples
Rights were successively from the Conquest more or less subverted, and
destroyed; For the recovery whereof, the said Nations Trustees in Parliament,
engaged themselves, and the good people thereof, in a long, expensive, and
Bloody War; which by the blessing of the Lord of Hosts ended in the total
Subduing of their Adversaryes, and Capacitating them to Execute exemplary
Justice upon the Principal, and his Abettors; to remove from their long
Usurped Authority over the Commons, the Lords Civil and Ecclesiastic: And to
assert by public Declaration The Supreme Authority to Reside originally in
the People, according to the Law of God, light of nature, and right reason; And
did thereupon by a Law Impose an Engagement upon all persons To own and stand
by that Commonwealth Constitution; as then Established without King or House
of Lords. And whereas we are by common fame Informed there is at present an
endeavor to introduce the old demolished fabric of Government in its
essential parts, and attendances; from whence little can be expected (as we
conceive) but the Reviving the Barrons War, by a successive contention betwixt
distinct Families, and Persons, for the Sovereignty, and a total loss of the
good ends of the late Contest, and Conquest, with a precipitating into tyranny,
and oppression, in matters Religious and Civil: And whereas our former and
late silence has been, and is, Interpreted a consent too, and Approbation of
the Transgressions of such who build what formerly they have destroyed, upon
and after their frequent seeking of, and solemn appeals to the most high God in
the case. To the end we may discharge our Consciences toward God, and men, by
freeing our selves (as much as in us lies) from the guilt of all that Blood
shed in the late Wars, for the obtaining of the good things, and removing of
the evil, by us and all good people aimed at; expressed in several Petitions
and Remonstrances to the then Supreme Authority, and prevent (what we may) the
further Blaspheming of the holy name of God, his cause, and people (formerly
associating and going hand in hand in Prayings, Declarations, Engagements, and
Appeals) by his and their Implacable Enemies: We conceive our selves Oblidged
to Testify to the world, That we remain firm and faithful to the good old
cause, that our principles are the same, and our affections, desires, and
prayers run out after, and are importunate with the Father of spirits, for the
obtaining, and accomplishing (in his own way and time) the blessed ends
formerly contended for, (viz.) The Advancing the Gospel and Kingdom of our
Lord Jesus, and of impartial Justice, Judgment, and Righteousness, in the way
of a Commonwealth, in opposition to Monarchy, name and thing, very Rationally
declared against by the long Parliament, March 17. 1648.
as unnceessary burdensome and dangerous to the liberty, safety, and public
Interest of the people, and for the most part made use of to oppress,
impoverish and enslave the good people of the land, the removing and taking
away the several burdens and grivances complained of, Particularly the
exercize of Arbitrary power over the lives, liberties and estates of the
people, The oppression of persons in their consciences, liberties, and estates
for differences of judgment in matter of religion from the way of the State,
The Regulating of the Laws and their Administration, the abuse whereof is
exceeding great, and burdensome, with many other perticulars which might be
mentione^, and are at large expressed in the several Petitions of our selves,
and others well-affected in the Nation. Together with the several Petitions,
Declarations, and Remonstrances of the Army, before and after their going into
Scotland, as also in the agreement of the people presented to the then
Parliament by the Army, and there remaining upon Record, All which together
with this sober Attestation may continue (as so many Pillars) to Testify the
good old Spirit to the present and future Ages.

March 26, 1657.
