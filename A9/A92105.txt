A Speech spoken by Prince RVPERT.
MAy it please your sacred Majesty, my most Royal Uncle, among these grave and
judicious Lords, to present my poor opinion to your Majesty concerning these so
important affairs of the instant war:
For surely, as said the valiant Duke of Brunswicke to my Royal Grandfather of
famous memory King James, though I cannot talk I can fight. Since then
fighting is the business now in discourse, I may by my education in the
military art (having been nursed in the Low Countries, that Seminary of warlike
discipline) claim the privilege in my blunt soldiers phrase, briefly to
deliver my opinion.

And though I cannot like an Orator in excellent English express my
intentions I shall nevertheless endeavor to speak sen^e, that the world and
my maligners (who for the elegance of the style, deny that Declaration to be
mine, which was in my name printed at Oxford) may acknowledge that I can as be
its a down right honest martial man, deliver my meaning, which as in this, so
in all other my following actions shall ever aim at your Majesty's service, as
I am in the duty of a Nephew obliged. I have been by your Royal commands
viewing the state of our garrison at Reading and though the Governor Sergeant
Major Ashton be a soldier of unquestionable experience and performance, and
the men under his command valiant enough and well disciplined, yet surely
according to the models of the Netherlandish fortifications it could not long
hold out, should a strict and hard siege be laid to it by the Parliaments
forces, the outworkes being neither strong, their graffes or ditches being dry,
and their vamures unpallisado'd, to that a resolute enemy without much
difficulty or long assault might mount them: and it is with works of this
manner, as it is with evil customs in men, which when they are once got in
can hardly be driven out again: And in my weak judgment, should these wars
continue, nothing could be so much considerable as the strengthening of Cities
and good Towns, especially those that have benefit of waters and Rivers, and
in all places of advantages and passages, the erecting Sconces and Forts: For
by this art have the States of the united Provinces not only defended that
little plat of ground they first possessed, but also have tired out, and
discouraged all those numerous Forces, which have yearly by the King of
Spaines procurement been sent for the reducing of those parts to his obedience,
these wars only by the strength of the Hollanders Towns, having more exhausted
his Indian treasure, then either his wars against France or the Turk. nay
against as the world, having expended, as it is credibly computed since Duke
d'Alva's time in the Netherlandish wars, a hundred millions of ducats, a
stupendous sum, and more then the whole Lands of the Hollanders Continent
are worth to be sold at twenty years purchase.

Breda's siege, a Town not much better situated then Reading, scarce so well
as this City of Oxford, having cost him daring Spinola's leaguer there in mere
pay to his Army at least a million of Ducats, besides the loss of thirty
thousand brave soldiers, Much more did the siege of Ostend cost the Archduke
Albert, which Town is but an arrant dog-hole compared with diverse I have seen
in England; yet it held out three years to the destruction of almost 80000. of
the Spanyard, men. In which time the Hollander gained that from him which he
could never since revanquish, namely the strong Towns of Sluice, Isendicke, and
other places of importance in Flanders, by which your Majesty and these Lords
may perceive the necessary benefits of strong Towns, should the wars (which
with all my soul I pray may have a speedy end) continue in these your
Majesty's dominions, the want of these excellent fortifications having been
the principal cause of the so much lamented loss of the Palatinate, to my
dear father of sacred memory; and the reason why the Spanyard and Bavarian
have so long held that rich and fruitful Province, has chiefly derived it
self from their erection of new fortresses there, and strengthening the old; a
policy which the now reigning Emperor, terrified with the Swedish conquests,
at my being his prisoner, with all diligence began to put in practice, leaving
no place that might impeach the enemy in his passage to his hereditary Austrian
Countries unfortified,

But perhaps your Majesty and these Lords will allege, that you believe the
wars here will not be of so long continuance as shall require such
fortifications; I pray to heaven they may not, in the mean time it can be no
ill policy to raise such strengths, the suoduing which, shall more impair the
Parliaments forces, and consume them more money then they can possibly any
ways else be forced to expend, nay, render your Majesty diverse considerable
advantages over them. Your Majesty may while their forces are divided against
such strong holds, securely curely set upon them with your horsemen, of which
you have a brave and gallant number; and so by degrees outcome that strength,
which united were dangerous is to encounter, forcing them to fight, as it were
by parties or so some hopes: wherein by all conjecture being the great number,
we ^^^t needs go out victorious; but if this charte (as in all duty I submit
me to your Majesty's censute) either seem too full of cost to your refe, or
terror to your people, who having been unaccustomed to such fortresses, will
perhaps, be ready to imagine they are only built to ensnare and inthrall their
liberties, distaste, which perhaps, your royal goodness is loath to afford
your Subjects, I would advise (in case these wars should continue) that your
Majesty would think upon some speedy mean for the reinforcement of your Army
against the next Spring, which way to provide a competent number of foot
soldiers to join with your large proportion of horse: for unless that be
done there is no hope of keeping the field against the Parliaments forces so
numerously strong in infantry, which in all the ancient wars of this Nation
has always done the best service; as those battles against the French at
Crossie and Poyctiers under the conduct of Edward the third, and his son
Edward the black Prince can testify; but more especially that of Henry the
fifth at Agincourt, where by the virtue and valor of the English foot, being
but a very small number, but well resolved and ordered, he overthrew the whole
flower of the French horse, and achieved as great a victory as is memorable in
any history whatsoever. The readiest way for such leavies of foot, as to draw
as many of the able Contrymen as possibly may be got ^^to your Majesty's
service, who may, while we lie still this Winter, be inured and trained up in
the rudiments of warfare.

But if your Majesty could by your faithful agents there pers^ade the Prince
of Orange and the States, to transfer to your assistance against the next
Spring, the four old Regiments of English soldiers there, with them
Commanders, no happier or more advantageous additions could be in reason
imagined to your Majesty's forces. Those bands of old experienced foot,
continually acquainted with all the dangers and practices of Arms, would be as
so many Masters in the Art of warfare to your young raw soldiers, and every
one man worth ten of the enemies-Peare there is none to be had of their
flinching in time of battle, could they once be drawn into your service,
they would stand to it to the last man, and either dye or conquer, seconding
your brave horse stoopes with their dexterous and home charges; they being
generally reputed in the Low Countries, to be as able firemen as any ure in the
world; and so might your Majesty be Master of the field in despite of the
Parliaments forces. And in my opinion, should the States refuse to send you
over your own Subjects, the Prince of Orange may do it as he is
Generalissimo of the forces, without their consent, there being no doubt but
he who is by so many ties obliged, and so near allied will be ready to serve
and assist your Majesty with all his ability and power. And this is all I have
to say concerning this affair, only this (though some accuse me for a
somenter of these civil dissentions) to beseech your Majesty for Gods and
Religions sake, for your own and your Royal issues sake, for your Kingdom
and peoples sake, in your wisdom, to provide some speedy means for a
reconcilement between your self and your high Court of Parliment, that so
these wars may have a happy period in fair and honorable peace; for
otherwise, how advantagiously soever they are managed, they must needs be
disadvantagious to your Majesty and distructive to your Kingdom and peace.

FINIS.
