Vindiciae Carolinae. Being a true Relation of His Highness the Prince of
Wales, His Voyage at Sea, since he parted from Calais in France, July 20.
until this very day, 1648.
IT Holds not always that the best and most virtuous Princes find faithful
and obedient Subjects; but rather on the contrary, clemency and goodness are
requited with strange unthankfulness, or monstrous Rebellions. The present and
sad experience of His Majesty the King of England, who was borne to the most
unquestioned Right of three Imperial Crowns, sees them all in a raging fit of
a distempered Rebellion, his Queen forced to flee away for refuge and
protection: The Prince (the Heir apparent to the Crown) with other the Royal
Branches enduring a base imprisonment, or a forced absence, and Majesty it
self confinde by the bloody O^dnances of cruel and barbarous Traitors, who
first pretending a Reformation, and at last blaspheming more freely to a
Saint-ship, have violated all the Rules of duty to God and man, squaring all
things acording to the humor of their fancy, and thereby tumbling the world
into another Chaos, and new confusion. The King (for many years past) has
endeavored to correct these bold presumptions, by meeting impudent Rebellion
in the field; but the torrent swelling too high, His Majesty was over borne,
and what he could not complete by a Martial power, he suffers for (though an
unworthy imprisonment) by an Angelical patience, in whose sad afflictions all
Loyal Subjects and good Christians bear a part and share: and now providence
has given some advantage to an Illustrious and hopeful Prince to enter on the
scene, and act a part in this bloody Tragedy, who after two years continuance
in France, with his Royal Mother the Queen, at length takes his leave, making
his first j^urney to Calais, and after a few days continuance there prepares
himself for a passage into Holland, which succeeded with a prosperous Gale;
and being aboard, a States man of war on Monday the 13. of July (stilo veceri)
His Highness arived at Helversluce, the next day following in the afternoon;
but before he put his foot in shoe he had the happy view of a Noble part of
the Royal Navy, where the Duke of York, attended with many Loyal hearts, had
their expectations filled with overflowing joys: Their showting and
acclamations were exceeding high for such an access of happiness; and the
Seamen, and Cannons played their parts, and with their loud voices roared out
their joyful apprehentions, filling the Region of the Air and tryumphing over
the waters, with high expressions of chearfullnes; that the Prince of wales was
now with them. And now the tide of rejoicing past over, His Highness goes on
shore; and having suddenly met with the Duke of York; the two Princes
congratulated their happy meeting, and with love unspeakable embraced each
other: The day following the Prince of O^ange made an early visit to the Prince
of Wales, and the matchless Princess, the Princess Royal made all have to
wait on her Brother, thinking every minute too tedious until she enjoyed His
presence: The Queen of Bohemia and her family made all possible speed to
welcome this Princely Guest; and after a few days or rather hours spent in
salutation, the Prince directs His thoughts for a voyage by Sea, and minding
the business of the Navy, bids farewell to His Royal friends: And on Thursday
after His Highness arived at Helve^sl uce: He went aboard the Admiral, where
after some second expressions of cheerfulness, he was received with great
Testimonies of duty and obedience; and the winds not blowing fair for the
Downs, the command was given to bear Northward toward Yarmouth Rode: And
upon Saturday following about a in the afternoon, the whole Fleet attentending
His Highness cast Anchor in that Rode, where after an hour or two it was
resolved, that a Gentleman should be sent with a Letter of kindness, and with
certain heads of the Princes Declaration the better to invite and animate that
Corporation to their obedience: But some of the enemies Troopers guarding the
Shore, forced the Messenger to return to the Navy (Re infecta,) so by rhat
interuption the Princes good intentions to the Town, and the Townsmen good
affections to the Prince were not understood at that time: The next day being
Sunday, the Navy floting on the Sea, and the people amazed in the Town, both
continued in great admiration of each other; the Fleet wondered at the peoples
strange undutifulnesse toward their Prince, and the People scared into a
timorous, and benumbed neutrality stared toward the Fleet with various
distracted affections: The distempers and discomposures in the Town were very
furious for a fit: at last their fear exceeded their love and Honor to their
Prince, and forgetting what an opportunity they had to welcome their Prince so
grea a stranger: that night was spent in frozen cold expressions, and the night
approaching summoned rest and silence for that season.

In the Morning some petty expressions of du^y dared to appear, and His
Highness had a taste of some loyal Adventures, which by boat came to the
Admiral from persons well affected and deeply touched with the sense of so
great persons neernesse to the Town. And after a while betwixt 6 and 7 of the
clock on monday morning (the Townsmen having summoned their wits together the
day before) it was resolved in a public meeting: That one of the Aldermen of
the Town should come and visit the Prince, and accordingly (a small Boat being
set off from the shore) a trim Townsman neatly dressed up in a great double
Ruff, and in his satin doublet, speedily came to the Admiral, where having
performed his devoir to the Prince, he out with his purse and impu^ently told
His Highness, that the Town was resolved to admit no forces of either side:
But if His Highness pleased to command any refreshments from the Town, His
pleasure should be obeyed. His Highness then considering the staggering humor
of the People, or rather more seriously the casual condition of the Town so
nearly waited on by a malicious enemy, accepted the motion of refreshments; and
having Ordered commands for that purpose, the word was given for the whole Fleet
to weigh Anchor, and the wind being courteous, to hoyse up sails and to
steer toward the Downs: which motion being observed by the Townsmen, they
were free with their Canon at our farewell, and they discharged their O^dnance
round the Town, which was interpreted a testimony of their cheerefulnes, and
loyalty, rather then of their fear or neglect. On the Wednesday following, the
Navy came with a fair quarter wind into the Downs: at whose first approach
the two fair Castles of Deal and Sandowne discharged their Ordnance for joy,
and the severalll ships were mutual and kind in their expressions: and now the
whole fleet having cast anchor in the Downs, fresh occasions were given for
better advantages: Some designs were proposed for enriching and increasing of
the Navy, that the Seamen might prove the more courageous, and the Fleet more
formidable to all opposition. But some more heady and impatient motions started
suddenly on foot: And some of the Officers and Seamen grew fierce and violent
for the Land service, and the relief of the two besieged Castles of Deal and
Sandowne; and the sudden raising of the whole County of Kent, was a fancy that
vainly hurryed away the minds of some, whose precipitate violence has since
recompensed their hasty indiscretion: some less experienced courages thought
to remove mountains as well as ride over waves, and made no doubt of heating
Horse and Foot from before the Castle with their muskets and pikes: But the
mixed body of Soldiers and Seamen (under the conduct of Sir John Boys and Major
General Gibson) being about the number of 600. in the whole, and all Foot,
were after a gallant adventure, mightily overpowred by a numerous Body of Horse
and Foot of the enemy; so that the retreat was forced to Sandowne Castle, and
some few slain (to about the Number of fifteen) and ninety three being taken
prisoners, according to a list of their names, sent from the enemy by a trumpet
the nex morning: The rest of the Soldiers retired to Sandowne Castle for
present shelter. And the skirmish over, they were the same day before night
reimbarked into the several ships of the Navy: But though an importunate
violence (not to be satisfied) occasioned some misfortunes on shore, the
winds and tides brought better success at Sea: And in a short time the Navy
began to swell with new additions of strength and wealth. Each ship was
diligent in their duty to attend the North and South furlongs. And the
Convertine and Blackmore Lady not a little prosperous; all the Fleet carefully
observing that no ship might pass without acknowledgment and duty to the
Admiral now in the Downs the Kings chamber. And a guard being commanded for
obedience, the Fleet did sudainely thrive to greater power: But amidst the
occurrences at Sea, the Prince considers the Affairs at Land: And in order to
his Royal Fathers business, thinks meet to dispatch a Gentleman to the tw^
Houses at Westminster, with a letter of kindness to the House of Lords, and a
Declaration enclosed; thereby manifesting to all the world his Princely
inclinations and desires to the peace and happiness of the Kingdom; but the
Gentleman was in a few days returned, bringing no answer to his Highness that
contained nothing in it but craft and wonted stubburnesse, plainly discovering
that the men of Westminster were resolved rather to sacrifice the hopes of all
men's happiness to their ambition, lust, and avarice, then part with the least
mite of their usurped power; and this occcasioned an utter differment of all
future motions to that purpose; but whilst those on shore are so brutish and
monstrous, the Sea gave good advantages of assistance, And first the Cormant^ne
a new ship (laden for Ginnye in the West Indyes, and now named the Charles by
the Prince himself) was reduced from that employment to serve his Highness,
and proves a bold and gallant Frygot. The Love, another tall and gallant ship
(returning from the Streits out of the Venetian sercice, formerly employed
against the Turks) was received (passing through the Downs) into service, and
made a man of war to attend the Navy; some other ships of great importance and
service were there admitted, and listed for attendance and commands, which
proved cheerful additions of strength and power. And now after some weeks
spent at Anchor in the Downs; notice and alarm was given of the Earl of
Warwicks Preparations, and coming for Sea: After which advertisement, his
Highness advising with his Counsel of war, thought fit to weigh Anchor, and
sail from the Downs toward Lee-Rode, being the mouth of the River Thames to
dare and encounter all opposition which spuriously presumed to affront Royalty,
and to make trial whether the Earl of Warwick durst sail with the Royal
Standard and Flag in his Main Top. The Seamen were extremely forward in the
design; and (though some counsels were clean a verse) yet after the Prince
understood that Warwick was certainly drawn down from Gravesend, his courage
countermaunded all counsels.

And in public Aboard the Admiral His Highness cheerfully declared his
Resolutions for Lee-Rode, which discovery of his forwardness so animated the
hearty Seamen, that they presently seemed as eager and violent as hungry Lions
to search out and pursue the pray; that dared to appear under such a brazen
faced rebellious countenance: And from these motions, the flames of Resolution
grew speedily more fervent over all the Navy; and all things are prepared and
postured for a fight at Sea, if the enemy durst grapple or engage. To this
purpose a new Command was given on Sunday the seven and twenty of August, the
several ships to weigh Anchor, and sail toward the Rebellious Party; whose
more nimble and scouting Frygots were first discerned on the Tuesday following,
which sight so encouraged the hearts of all the Fleet attending the Prince;
that the Officers and Seamen brake forth into new expressions of joy, not
doubting but to reduce the Rebels to submisse obedience, or else resolving to
dye in a Cause so just and honorable. And this resolution was confirmed by an
Oath of fidelity (which the Officers and Seamen voluntarily took in his
Highness Presence, going aboard each ship) to be true and faithful to his
Highness Person and Commands against the Earl of Warwicks power, and all his
Adherents and Confederates. And after these great pledges of fidelity was given
on Wednesday morning; the Fleet made all the sail they could, and pursued the
Frygots (first discovered the night before) which suddenly returning to their
Mock-Admirall, told the news of the Princes Approach with his Fleet, which
made them (being then under sail) to tack about: And they basely fled, and
suffered the pursuit for ten Leagues at least, the Channel growing more
narrow, the Sands numerous on each side, and the night approaching, the
engagements, were somewhat the longer deferrd; for the next morning (after the
misty fog was first dispersed) the Princes whole Navy weighed Anchor again,
resolved to fight with the enemy, whether lying at Anchor or under Sail; all
preparations were hastened in the several ships, the Cabins in an instant
knocked down, and slung into the Sea, the guns primed and leveled, the granads
and fire balls ready, and several gunners with their linstocks ordered in
their several quarters: And all persons diligent to obey commands, resolved to
beat and conquer the enemy, or dye bravely. And yet before the endeavor of
farther attempt; it pleased the Gracious Prince to try if a Message of peace
and pardon could mollify obdurate Traitors, and diverse or prevent the
effusion of English blood; Anciently Acts of grace did engage the people,
obsequio mitigantur imperia: And kind M^ss^ges very prevalent with civ^ll
Heathens. To this purpose the Prince was pleas^d to send a groom of his
Bedchamber to Warwick, with a Letter to prepare his Loyalty and obedience; but
his Committee-M^sters so ordered their Cypher-Admirall, that a base and
unworthy answer was returned, much to this purpose: That his Warwickship was
(forsooth) Lord High Admiral by a Commission from ^he two Houses at
westminster; and that he could not strike the fl^gge in his mainetop to any
Person whomsoever; which Rebellious defyance made all Loyal Resolutions much
more keen, and hastened the Princes Fleet to more speedy revenge; which was on
Thursday attempted with many desperate haz^^ds to engage the enemy; but his
Mock-Admiralship avoides all offers of fighting: And flying as near the shore
as possible, would not endure the breath of a Canon, nor the sight of a broad
side. Amongst other exchanges of the day: The Prince in the Admiral was very
forward, and calling for his Arms, ready to engage, minded more the
preservation of his Honor then his Person; notwithstanding all importunities
of his Counsel, and the Seamen so earnest for his safety: He answered that he
dreaded no hazard in such a Cause, but persisted resolute and undaunted to
encounter with the greatest danger, equally with the meanest Person engaged,
and following the George, wherein Warwick was, made often at him: But Warwick
still looked either to the mouth of Chattam River for the Protection of
Queenburrough Castle, or toward the mouth of the River of Thames, that he
might be secure of the block houses near Graves end. Another handsome piece of
Gallantry, the Vice Admiral of the Princes Fleet did manifest by pursuing
Warwicks Mock-Vice-Admirall so long, and to such a neerenesse, that if she
durst have stayed, or showed any courage, the engagement must sudainely proved
very bloody, or very glorious to one of the two: The Swallow the Reare-Admirall
in the Princes Fleet, was very impatient of Attendance, and in order made a
swift pursuit after Warwicks ship; but he durst not stay to give or take a
broad side from any of the Princes ships; but still crept nearer the shore
toward Queenburrough Castle: And thus the great ships and frygots having plied
too and again to engage the enemy to fight, a violent storm of winds and
tempest sudainly arising, discression forced the Princes whole Fleet to cast
Anchor again; and darkness parted further disputes for that night following:
The n^xt day being F^yday, the winds blew fair to go to Sea, and they seemed
to breath an invitation to either Fleet, where they might have Sea room to
fight and end the quarrel: And betwix^ six and seven of the clock, the
command was given in the Princes Fleet to weigh Anchor, and hoise up sails,
where the Channel being na^^ow, the Sands numerous, and the way dangerous, by
reason of a Passage called the Spits (where many Sea-wracks yet appear) the F^
et sailed very gently lest they should be too soon ou^ of Warwicks sight, and
the motion was ordered the more slow to dare Warwicks company to a more proper
convenience of fighting: And for some nine or ten Leagues Warwick seemed to be
inclined to that purpose, and three Frigots of his mock Vice Admiral, came
near sometimes, and once within distance of Canon shot: and two small Ships of
the Princes fleet loytering in the Rear, were lagging like easy sweet baits
to invite Warwicks Frigots to make greater haste: which (the Rear Admiral the
Swallow being past by) they seemed to gape more greedily hoping ^o seize on the
smaller vessels, though they durst not be engaged by any that were their
equals: But the Princes Reare-Admirall well knowing her duty suddenly tackt
about and turned the Helm a lee, and her Sales halled up, she presently gave
deafince to Warwicks three Frygots, and the mock-Vice Admiral: nay that
Tacking about checked Warwicks whole Fleet, which presently halled up their
Sails, and cast their Anchors: And by this means the lesser vessels, more
deeply laden to recover security near the Princes Admiral: At which sight 16
Colliers ships attending Warwick like stout men of War, speedily parted from
Warwicks Feet, and some of them made for London to the men of Westminster to
bring the news from Lee-Rode of their Apish Admiral, whose Commission they
had created by a broad Seal, and whose Person they have since declared valiant
by a monstrous Ordinance: But the enemy thus cowardly scared from the Princes
Company, contented themselves with a secure riding at Anchor, and hated the
sight of Sea Room; where His Highness was present. And yet all danger was no
utterly avoided, there lay another Trap in the way, yet w^nt o^ p^ovisions in
the Princes Fleet well understood; some of the sh^ps having tasted nothing but
dry bisquet, or salt wa^er for some daye^ before, and a pinching necessity
amongst them all. This condition forced His Highness to command the Fleet to
steare toward Go^y in Holland to refresh and victual the Navy; which course
was held, but by the way the Princes Fleet met with another Sea Monster, A
Parliament Fleet sent from Portsmouth consisting of about 6 great ships besides
Pinks, Frigots, and hoys, which lay at Anchor in the channel and passage to
Gory; But ^hey snudged close, and being cool in courage lay still without
light or Noise. The time was now about nine at night, and it was very dark, but
it happened that the Swallow, the Rear Admiral to the Princely Fleet, sailed in
the very guts and midst of them all, and haled to them, and finding them to
be another sort of a Rebellious supply, presently resolved to give them a^l
some mark and testimony of courage and resolution before she parted, and in a
very trice of time she made ready her guns, and fired three pieces of Ordnance
at them, which caused the Portsmouth Fleet to make a terrible outcry, and s^y
that they would cut their Cables, and follow, but the timorous souls were not
further disputed with, by reason the Princes Fleet held on their course, and
could not return to an engagement, where the wind and tide so mightily opposed.
And this second Fleet thus handsomely tried and avoided, the Princes Fleet
steered on for Holland, and the next day being Friday about three in the
afternoon, His Highness with all His N^^y came safe to Gory, and the Fleet is
now at anchor at Helversl uce in Holland, and Warwick with his Colliers and
Frigots in Gory-rode, thinking to pursue the advantage he conceived before him
(ou^ wants of victual and tackling;) but we are providing our selves, and
shortly hope to pluck his Rebellious plumes of pride, or we will sink by his
sides: Our men (what er'e you hear at London) resent so well the Parliaments
mercy at Colchester are resolved to sell their bloods at dearer rates, then ten
shillings a head to the Summer Islands.

The Princes Highness has his Navy in a very good order, well manned and
victuall'd, and fitted for service. A new treachery discovered against the
Fleet, but happily prevented by the Prudence of the Prince.

FINIS.
