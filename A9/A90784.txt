A PANEGYRIC, Faithfully representing The proceedings of the PARLIAMENT at
Westminster, since their first Sessions to this present: Wherein their
wonderful Acts are truly declared; And what is further by them to be expected.
MOst gracious, Omnipotent,
And everlasting Parliament,
Whose power and Majesty
Is greater then all Kings by odds;
Yea to account you less then Gods,
Must needs be blasphemy.
Moses and Aaron never did do
More wonders then are wrought by you
For Englands Israel:
But through the Red Sea we have past,
If you to Canaan bring's at last,
Is It not a miracle?
In six years space you have done more
Then all our Parliaments before:
You have quite done the work;
The Cavaliers, the King, the Pope,
You have o'rethrowne, and next we hope
You will confound the Turk.
The heads of Strafford, and of Laud,
You did cut off, because by fraud
They would have made us slaves:
But sure you were ten times more just,
Who Carew and the Hotham's trust,
For they were arrant knaves.
By you we have deliverance
From the designs of Spain and France,
Ormond Montrosse, the Danes:
You aided by our Brethren Scots,
Defeated have malignant plots,
And brought their Swords to Canes.
What wholesome Laws have you ordained,
Whereby our propertie's maintained
Against those would us undo?
Yea both our fortunes and our lives,
And what is dearer, even our wives,
Are wholly kept by you.
O what a flourishing Church and State
Have we enjoyed ere since you sat?
What a glorious King, God save him,
Have you now made His Majesty,
Had he the grace but to comply,
And do as you would have him?
When Hell was not enough to fright
And make the Royal Party right,
You wisely did invent
That dreadful Tophet, Goldsmiths-hall,
And Committees worse then Devil and all
For their full punishment.
Your Directory how to pray
By the Spirit shows the perfect way:
In zeal you have abolisht
That Dagon of the Common Prayer*
And next we see you will take care
That Churches be demolisht.
What multitudes in every Trade
Of painful Preachers you have made,
Learned by revelation:
Oxford and Cambridge make poor Preachers,
Each Shop affords better Teachers:
Oh blessed Reformation!
Your godly Wisdoms have found out
The true Religion without doubt:
For sure amongst so many,
(We have five hundred at the least,
Is not the Gospel well increast?)
One must be pure, if any.
Could you have done more piously,
Then sell Church Lands the King to buy,
And stop the Cities plaints?
Paying the Scots Church-Militant,
That the new Gospel help to plant,
God knows they are poor Saints.
Because the Apostles Creed is lame,
The Assembly do a better frame,
Which saves us all with ease:
Provided still we have the grace
To believe the two Houses in the first place,
Let our works be what they please.
It Is strange your power and holiness
Cannot the Irish Devil dispossess,
His kind is very stout:
That though you do so often pray,
And every Month keep Fasting-day
You cannot get him out.
Who will not pay with all his heart
Excise? the fifth, and twentieth part,
Assessements, Taxes, Rates,
It Is easy what both Houses leavy,
Our duties to the King were heavy,
But all we have's the States.
For all your sufferings and your pains,
What in the end shall be your gains,
You never did regard:
Some twenty thousand pounds a man,
An Office too, alas who can
Think that a fit reward?
Wherefore as soon as you're dissolved,
To show our thanks we are resolved,
The King himself engages,
Another Parliament to call,
Which your deserts consider shall,
And surely pay your wages.
FINIS.
