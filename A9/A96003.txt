A VISION, WHICH One Mr. Brain (one of the Ministers of Winchester) had in
September, 1647.
HE thought a man took and put him into the water, and on the other side of the
water stood another man, which gave him a book, and bad him go into France, and
denounce there the heavy judgment of God against the Kingdom, until the
Martyrs massacration in Paris was revenged: and the blood that has been in
England shall be four times doubled in France.

Monarchy shall fall, first in England, then in France, then in Spain; and
after in all Christendom; and when Christ has put down this power, he himself
will begin to reign, and first in England, where the meanest People that are
now despised, shall have first the revelation of truth, and it shall pass from
them to other Nations; after that a Voice spoke these Verses following, (which
he then understood not) The Crown-land sold,
The Scotch Presbytery rold;
The King in the pit,
And a seal upon it.
There will not be much more blood shed in England, though much more contention
and strife.

This was presented by M. Thomas Goodwin, to some Members of the Army.
