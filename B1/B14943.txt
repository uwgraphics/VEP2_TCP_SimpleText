THere is advise out of Spain / that there were in Sivile eight of the Holland
ships sequestered; the like also is done in all the Sea havens of Spain for to
help therewith Marmora.

The letters of the 30. of Iuny give advise / that the mighty army of the Turck
/ was gone from Adrianopolis toward the Moldaw / and that there were daily
more folks sent unto it / both horsemen and footmen: the Bassa Bustain is to
be the Gouvernour in Galata / S'cutary / and in all places unto the black sea:
he has many ships well armed / for to withstand the Cosaques / who do as yet
much harm in that black sea.

The famous Pirate / Samson / has desired of this Seigniory / a free incoming
with all his / and as some thinck: for to inhabit to Pola in Istria: upon
which condition he offers to this Seigniory 36. well armed ships with one
million of gold for a gift against time of need: more-over two millions of gold
/ for ten in the hondert / besides other conditions: the Secretary Ancelay has
already commission to treat with hin of these things.

Out of Breslaw, the 4. of August.
The Marquis of Iagherendorp has burnt more than the half of the town of
Nieudischen in Moravie / 5. duith miles from Olmits / which has / constreined
the horsemen of the Emperor to depart thence for need / which being invironned
by the soldiers of the said Marquis they have killed of them well eight hondert
/ some say a thousand / al of them being choice men: from thence the same
Iagerendorps folks are al gone toward Olmits and burnt the suburbs thereof /
and afterward / as is reported / taken the same per force: many places in
Moravie do yield themselves willingly / for there is much fear / and few
garnisons. It is reported that the Marquis Ledger is now 24. thousand strong:
but because the Magistrates ar here good Imperialists / and the subieces hold
for the King / there is here so much misery for the common people / that it is
wonder. The small town of Brieg is hept with one company of soldiers: the Our is
parted and there is to Neus 2. Enseignes of soldiers: 3 Enseignes also passed
yesterday this way: The soldiers of Saxe have taken in Swems and Grotoclockow.

Enperour soldiers killed in Moravy.

The Knyt Robustely having receyved certain advys / that the King of Spain was
resolved to restore the Land of Deltolin to the inhabitans thereof / has called
them together / and required of them te submit again onder the power of the
Confederate and in case that they would hold him for their head and swear unto
him / he would deffend them against the Confederate: but as some of the
Nobility did dissuade the common people fromit / he is hierupon entered in great
choler / and caused some to be executed: whereupon that people have divided them
selves in two parts the one holding with Robustely / and the other with the
Nobility / so as they kill one another where thy can / so as a great murdering
one of another is to be feared: the fifth of this month ar passed 28. Companyes
of Italians ad Spanisch soldiers torough Deltolin toward Tyrol / and from
thense going toward Hongary: the soldiers also of Leopold / ar said to go the
same way / but these have great need of money / they have in ten wekes not

The pardon given by the Emperor is not yet published here: the Deputyes of
Silesia ar yesterday returned with great contentment from Dienna hier / they
have promised to the Emperor 300. thousend Florins / to be paid in 3. terms:
two days agon is vassed here the high consel of the Empire / for to go to the
Elector of Saxe: it is for to set a day of consultation for the affairs of the
Empire.

From Vienna, the 11. dito.
Yesterday at the Hongres / being about 8000 strong / fallen upon the March /
about a mile from hence / and have burnt many villages / and among other
Lichtensteen / the corn also is wholly burnt / the old folks ar killed / and
the young driven away like cattle / there has bin such a fire that the light
thereof could be seen hier over all the town in the aier: the Emperor himself
is mounted upon an high tower of the Castle for to see it: the Hongres have
parted themselves in 13. companyes / and have the last night roved so far as
Cremnits / where they have / as is reported / burnt 70 Dilladges / no body
withstand them / for there ar no forces / the shutting has bin heard here from
the Closter Neuburg: and as the Duc Carles with Don Marthias would yesterday
morning have gone by s^^pp to the Closter Neuburg / they did escape the Hong^es
very narowly / and there is such a running hier of young and old / that it can
hardly be spoken / so as the suburbs ar full.

At Lumpenbourg and other places in Moravie the Hongres have also spoiled all.
Our folckes ar yet by Presbourg / not being about 6000 strong / they have not
long since take two of Bethlehems great men / whom they would not let live /
which has yet more inflammed Gabor against us / who has also taken many of
our Comtes and Lords / as also Dampiers brother / so as it appears that the
hand of God is upon this Land.

Men do writ out of the Palsland / that leave is granted unto the Soldiers
for to lodge in the Bishopr^ck of Spier / and commanded that they should not

forbidden them / have begone to shut upon the Soldiers / and killed and hurt
some of them / and left them in midst of the streets / but the soldiers have
set in furye upon the clounes and have killed and hurt some of them / and there
upon the soldiers and horsemen have begone to spoil.
