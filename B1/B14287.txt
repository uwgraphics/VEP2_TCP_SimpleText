MART. Quid titulum poscis? Versus duo tresue legantur.
1617.

The Front before the Scene, an Arch-Triumphall, On the top of which, HVMANITIE
placed in figure, sits with her lap full of flowers, scattering them with her
right hand; and holding a golden chain in her left: to show both the freedom,
and the bond of Courtesy. with this inscription. SVPER OMNIA VULTVS.

On the two sides of the Arch CHEEREFVLNES and READINESS
her servants.

CHEEREFVLNES, in a loose flowing garment, filling out wine from an antique
piece of plate: with this word Adsit laetitiae dator.

READINESS, a winged Maid with two flaming bright lights in her hands: and her
word Amor addidit alas.

The Scene discovered, is (on the one side) the head of a boat, and in it
CHARON putting off from the shore, having landed certain imagined ghosts, whom
MERCVRY there receives, and encourages to come on, toward the river LETHE,
who appears lying in the person of an old man. The FATES sitting by him on his
bank. A grove of mirtles behind them, presented, and growing thicker, to the
other side of the Scene.

MERCVRY. NAy, faint not now, so near the fields of rest,
Here no more furies, no more torments dwell,
Then each has felt already in his breast,
Who has been once in love, has proved his hell.
Up then, and follow this my golden rod,
That points you next to aged LETHES shore,
Who powers his waters from his vrne abroad,
Of which but tasting, you shall faint no more.

LETHE. Stay, who, or what phantastique shades are these
That HERMES leads?

MERCVRY. They are the gentle forms,
Of Lovers, tossed upon those frantique seas,
Whence VENUS sprung.

LETHE. And have rid out her storms?

MERCVRY. No.

LETHE: Did they perish?

MERCVRY. Yes.

LETHE. How?

MERCVRY. Drowned by love,
That drew them forth with hopes as smooth as were
Th'vnfaithfull waters he desired 'hem prove.

LETHE. And turned a tempest when he had 'hem there?

MERCVRY. He did, and on the billow would he roll,
And laugh, to see one throw his heart away,
Another sighing, vapor forth his soul,
A third, to melt himself in tears, and say,
O Love, I now to salter water turn
Then that I die in; then, a fourth, to cry
Amid the surges, oh I burn, I burn:
A fifth, laugh out, it is my ghost, not I.
And thus in paires I found 'hem. Only one
There is, that walks, and stops, and shakes his head,
And shuns the rest, as glad to be alone,
And whispers to himself, he is not dead.

FATES. No more are all the rest.

MERCVRY. No?

1. FATE. No.

MERCVRY. But, why
Proceeds this doubtful voice from destiny?

FATES. It is too sure.

MERCVRY. Sure?

2. FATE. I: thinks MERCVRY,
That any things, or names on earth do die,
That are obscured from knowledge of the FATES;
Who keep all rolls?

3. FATE. And know all natures dates?

MERCVRY. They say themselves they are dead.

1. FATE. It not appears.
Or, by our rock.

2. FATE. Our spindle.

3. FATE. Or our sheeres.

FATES. Here all their threads are growing, yet none cut.

MERCVRY. IN gin to doubt, that Love with charms has put
This phant'sie in 'hem; and they only think
That they are ghosts.

FATE. If so, then let 'hem drink
Of LETHES stream.

FATE. 'Twill make 'hem to forget
LOVES name.

FATE. And so, they may recover yet.

MERCVRY. Do, bow unto the reverend lake.
And having touched there; up, and shake
The shadows off, which yet do make
Us you, and you your-selues mistake.

Here they all stoop to the water, and dance forth their antimasque, in
several gestures, as they lived in love: And retyring into the Grove, before
the last person be off the stage, the first couple appear in their posture,
between the trees, ready to come fourth, changed. MERCVRY. See! see! they are
themselves again!

1. FATE. Yes, now they are substances, and men.

2. FATE. LOVE, at the name of LETHE flies.

LETHE. For, in oblivion drowned, he dies.

3. FATE. He must not hope, though other states
He often subdue, he can the FATES.

FATES. 'Twere insolence, to think his powers
Can work on us, and equal ours.

CHORUS. Return, Return,
Like lights to burn
On earth,
For others good:
Your second birth
Will fame old LETHES flood,
And warn a world,
That now are hoorld
About in tempest, how they prove
Shadows for Love.
Leap forth: your light it is the nobler made,
By being struck out of a shade.

Here they dance forth their entry, or first dance: after which CUPID --
appearing, meets them. WHy, now you take me! these are rites
That grace Loves days, and crown his nights!
These are the motions, I would see,
And praise, in them that follow me!
Not sighs, nor tears, nor wounded hearts,
Nor flames, nor ghosts: but ayrie parts
Tried, and refined as yours have bin,
And such they are, I glory in.

MERCVRY. Look, look unto this snakie rod,
And stop your ears against the charming god;
His every word, falls from him, is a snare:
Who have so lately known him, should beware.

Here they dance their main dance, which ended, CUPID. Come, do not call it
CVPIDS crime,
You were thought dead, before your time.
If thus you move to HERMES will
Alone; you will be thought so still.
Go, take the ladies forth, and talk,
And touch, and taste too: Ghosts can walk.
'Twixt eyes, tongues, hands, the mutual strife
Is bred, that tries the truth of life.
They do, indeed, like dead men move,
That think they live, and not in love.

Here they take forth the Ladies, and the Reuells follow: after which, MERCVRY.
Nay, you should never have left off:
But stayed, and heard your general CUPID scoff,
To find you in the line you were.

CUPID. HERMES, your too much wit, breeds too much fear.

MERCVRY. Good Fly, good night.

CUPID. But, will you go?
Can you leave LOVE, and he entreat you so?
Here, take my quiver, and my bow,
My torches too; that you, by all, may know
I mean no danger to your stay:
This night, I will create my holiday,
And be yours, naked, and entire.

MERCVRY. As if that LOVE, dis-arm'd, were less a fire?
Away, away.

They dance their going out: which done, MERCVRY. Yet lest that VENUS wanton
Son
Should, with the world, be quite undone,
For your fair sakes (you brighter stars,
Who have beheld these civil wars)
FATE is content, these Lovers here
Remain still such: so LOVE will swear
Never to force them act to do,
But what he will call HERMES too.

CUPID. I swear: and with like cause thank MERCVRY,
As these have, to thank him, and destiny.

CHORUS. All then take cause of joy: for who has not?
Old LETHE, that their follies are forgot;
We, that their lives unto their fates they fit:
They, that they still shall love, and love with wit.

The end.
