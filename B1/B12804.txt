DIEV ET MON DROIT

By the King. A Proclamation declaring His Majesty's Royal grace, to confirm
to his Subjects their defective Titles or Estates.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, taking notice that there are sundry Manors,
Lands, Tenements, and other Hereditaments in the actual possession of diverse
of His loving Subjects, either by descent from their ancestors, or by their
own purchases, which nevertheless do in truth and right belong unto His
Majesty, as His own proper inheritance, The pretended owners thereof, either
having no Grant at all from the Crown, whereby to derive good tytles to
themselves, or else such grants as have been surreptitiously gotten upon false
suggestions, or by other deceitful courses, or are otherwise defective and
insufficient in Law; So as His Majesty might by His royal prerogative and
right, take advantage thereof, to seize the same Manors and Lands into His
hands, and so leave the said pretended owners without relief: Which might upon
just reason be done, considering that both the late Queen Elizabeth in Her
time, and His Majesty sithence, have by several Commissions of Grace awarded
for confirmation of all such defective tytles, and by former public
proclamations, as by so many solemn warnings, summoned and invited all
persons, whom the same might concern, upon easy and honorable compositions to
prevent their own dangers in this behalf; which hitherto they have contemned,
or neglected to do.

Notwithstanding, His Majesty, out of His Princely clemency and unwillingness
to take any strict courses against His loving Subjects, has been graciously
pleased, once more to renew His said Commission to sundry of His Privy
Council, and others of His Judges and Council learned, authorizing them to
treat and compound with any person or persons on His Majesty's behalf, for
confirming and making good of their defective Titles or Estates, according to
the course heretofore used in like Commissions: But with this expectation,
that as it pleases His Majesty, in his gracious well-wishing to the peace and
quiet of His loving Subjects, thus to incline to them, and forbear to take
notice of their former negligences, So now they will be advised upon this
renewed offer of his Grace to neglect the same no longer; lest after so many
warnings, the same be justly taken from them.

And therefore His Majesty does straightly charge and command all persons whom it
may concern, by this public declaration of His Will and Pleasure, to take
such notice thereof, that voluntarily, or upon letters to them directed from
His Majesty's Commissioners, with a draught of the particular case, whereupon
their Title shall be questioned, they fail not at their perils to attend the
said Commissioners, for such moderate and reasonable compositions, as shall be
found fit and equal for confirmation of their estates, and clearing all doubts
of the same: Letting them all to wit, that in case they shall neglect this
offer of his Princely goodness and favor toward them, in not appearing, or
not compounding for the settling of their lands and possessions in peace; As His
Majesty intends not to make any second or new treaties, with those that shall
show themselves wilful and refractary in this behalf, So they shall have no
just cause to complain of any but themselves, if contrary to His Majesty's
princely inclination, he be enforced to more severe courses, for recovering and
maintaining the Revenues of His Crown, against all intrusions, and unlawful
usurpations and possessions whatsoever.

Given at Whitehall, the thirteenth day of February, in the sixteenth year of
our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the two and
fiftieth.
God save the King.
