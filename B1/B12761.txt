depiction of England's coat of arms in 1608 By the King. A Proclamation
against Transportation of Leather.
WHereas we understand, that diverse of our loving Subjects have made complaint,
that the price of Neates-Leather is lately raised to such a height, as it
proves very grievous to the poorer sort, who have daily use thereof: Such is
and shall be ever our care and resolution to prevent, or reform all things
that may be burdensome to any of our people over whom Almighty God has
committed to Us the universal care, as we have been no less curious to find
and search out the true cause, then to provide for the remedy of the
inconvenience, And therein particularly to be sure to take away all means or
color for any such grieuance, that may (either in truth or apprehension)
arise from any action of our own. For which purpose, although We do daily see
by common experience, that excessive prices grow upon our Subjects by the
practice and greediness of private persons, who either by Forestalling and
Engrossing of Commodities, or by combyning to keep them at high prices, or by
conueying them out of our Realm by stealth, do increase the rates as well of
foreign, as home bred commodities, without any Act of ours: Nevertheless,
because We have observed that some evil affected people, in this, as in diverse
other things, are more inclined to impute the cause of grieuance to some thing
done by us, then to resort to the maine and original grounds of the same; We
have for more surety, caused our Council to take Information what Licenses We
have given, (which happily may have been some pretext for abuse in that kind)
and thereby finding that some small quantity of that commodity has been
Transported by virtue of a License granted at our first coming, at the Suite
of some foreign Princes our Allies, whom We could hardly then refuse,
although it be known to the world, that We did not give License for any
Leather by name, but generally for the Transporting of forbidden Commodities,
and that only to the sum of six Thousand pounds in value, which could be no
occasion of such scarcity: Yet because it is not unlikely but that some
Neates-Leather might be hereafter issued by virtue of that License (as some
has been already) contrary to our meaning, We did not only (so soon as this
came to our ears) give present order to our Treasourer of England to restrain
all use of Licenses (if any there were or be) concerning the Transportation of
such Leather, whereof there is no such plenty within our kingdom, but that
whatsoever is carried away, may be soon felt in the scarcity and dearness
thereof at home, But for the more sure prevention of this grieuance, and that
all our loving Subjects may be witnesses of our care in this behalf, We do
now by these presents revoke and disanull all Licenses and Tolerations
concerning Transportation of Neates-Leather, (if any there be) And do further
expressly prohibit and forbid all manner persons whatsoever, That they attempt
not from henceforth to carry or convey away, or cause or consent to be carried
or conveyed away out of this our Realm, any Neates-Leather, or Neates-Hides
raw before they be perfect Leather.

And likewise We do by these presents straightly charge and Command all our
Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Surueyors, and other our Officers of our
Ports, That they do not only inform our said Treasourer, what
Neates-Leather, or Neates-Hides raw they have known to be Transported at any
time since the beginning of our Reign, at what Ports, and by whom; But also
that they be from henceforth watchful that none pass by any practice,
pretense, or color Whatsoever, as they, and every of them will answer the
contrary at their uttermost perils. Knowing that from henceforth they shall
have no excuse by pretense of Licenses or other Tolerations, inasmuch as we
have revoked and disauowed them (if any such there be) by these presents.
Willing yet further all our Subjects that can learn or understand any abuse in
this behalf, That they also resort to our said Treasourer and inform him
thereof, whereby he may detect the fraud, corruption, and confederacy of our
said Officers, if they shall conceal the same. And such discouerers shall
receive such reward as their service shall deserve.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the one and thirtieth day of March, in the
sixth year of our Reign of great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. Anno Dom. 1608.
