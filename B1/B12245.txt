The Course of the Tare of Cloth in Holland.
BY the Ancient Law of the Romans, called Edictum Aedilitium: (of the AEdiles
that made it) it was free to the Buyer of any slave or other Merchandise that
had any hidden fault, which would not be perceived by ordinary view, to make
further visitation of the thing so bought afterward; and if it proved faulty
then, at his choice either to return the same upon the Seller, or else
retaining it, to have the defect valued by indifferent persons, and then the
value of the faults to be allowed him by the Buyer out of the price. This Law,
among many other Laws of the Romans, is current to this day in Germany, and
the Low Countries, yet so, as it is nevertheless free to sell a Commodity, Per
aversionem; that is, to be taken with all faults, if the buyer will consent
thereunto according to the rule; Quilibet iuri pro se introducto potest
renuntiare?

The Merchants Adventurers, trading in Cloth, with the Merchants of Germany,
and of the Low Countries, and settling the Rendevouse of their trade in each of
these, in one place called their Mart Town, did of ancient time allow
abatement unto the Buyers for such faults of their Clothes, (especially for
narrowness and shortness,) as were found in the opening of the same, after
they came to the Buyers hands, which allowance or abatement was at first made
only in their Mart Town, and before the Cloth was wet; in this manner. The
Merchant Buyer having in opening of his Cloth in the Mart Town, found them to
be too narrow or too short, did forthwith acquaint the Seller, that the Cloth
was found to be faulty, whereupon the parties agreed upon two good men, one of
each Nation, to visit the Cloth, and to value the faults; which valuation is by
the Dutch called Tare: and that being thus made, the Seller was to allow the
Buyer the sum so taxed out of the price of Cloth; which Tare and allowance
being so made, the Seller made Affadauit thereof before the Secretary of the
Fellowship of Merchants Adventurers, residing in the Mart Town, who gave
certificat of the same under the Seal at causes of the Company. By virtue
whereof the English Merchant was enabled to recover the said abatement again
of the Clothier, that sold him the Cloth here in England.

This Tare being thus at first made in the Mart Town, the Dutch Merchants that
dwelt in other Towns, pretending have and want of leisure to visit their Cloth
in the Mart Towns, carried it home to the several Towns where they dwelt,
where finding defects of length and breadth in the Clothe^, they caused the
sworn Measurer of the place to mete them over, and certify the want of length
or size under his hand, which certificat being brought to the English Merchant,
and being at first for no greater matters then were usually found in the Mart
Town, he allowed therefore according to the Rate as the Cloth cost, and made
his Affadavit thereof to the English Secretary, and took his Certificat
accordingly?

After this was dawn thus in Train, and the Dutch Merchants began to feel the
sweetness of these allowances, made greater by the absence of the English
Merchants began to feel the sweetness of these allowances, made greater by
the absence of the English Merchants, they further proceeded to make abatement
for Rimples, Bands, holes, and stopsalles in the Cloth, at their own home.
And for the taxing of the true value of these faults, as also of shortness and
narrowness, they caused (for better color of their proceedings) an office to
be erected in every Town of sworn men to visit English Cloths, and to
estimate and tax the damage thereby sustained by the Buyer, whereof certificat
being brought to the English Merchants in the Mart Town, he was compelled to
allow the same, and to seek the remedy of the Clothier here, by such
certificat from the Secretary of the Company, as is above mentioned. The course
thus settled, the Dutch grew daily to make their Tare more and more
unreasonable, the Visitors or Tare-masters favoring those that brought them
work, and adding to the Tare not only the salary of their labor, but also the
charges of their meeting, which was sometimes a Pot of Wine, two or three,
sometimes a dinner, at last what they would spend under color of that
occasion: So that the Tare-masters, and some of the Dutch Merchants bragged,
that they had built fair houses, by the benefit of the Tare of English Cloth.

The Clothier of England feeling the smart of this Tare, (although he seldom
allowed his Merchant the one half of that the same Merchant had paid to the
Dutch) complained to the Parliament in the 43. year of Queen Elizabeth; and
so prevailed, that it was enacted, that he should not be liable to allow the
Merchant any thing upon any certificat brought from foreign parts, yea
although he should contract with him to do it. Hereupon the English Merchant
fell unto a great and continual loss: the Clothier now making falser Cloth
then ever before, and the Dutch Merchant more Tare; so that loosing often, of his
principal he complained to the Parliament, b:
in the 4. year of his Majesty's Reign that now is, and craved his ancient
remedy by certificat, which was denied him: yet it was enacted, to the end he
should not be without remedy, that he should have power to visit his Cloth here
at home, and to recover of the Clothier, for shortness, narrowness, and want
of weight, according to certain rates by the Statute appointed.

b:
And therefore for a further remedy the Company of Merchants Adventurers
residing at Hamburgh, did in the year 1611, agree and order among themselves,
to sell all their Cloth, with this special part and condition in their
contract of sale; that they would not be liable to allow any Tare, but such
only as should be made in the Mart Town, where they might see how they were
dealt withal in the taxing of the faults, and that on^y in the dry Cloth,
before that was sophisticated in the wetting. And this order the next year
after they established also at Middleburgh, their Mart Town for the
Netherlands, and so brought this Tare business to a good reformation.

But in the year 1614 the new Company for Dying and Dressing being erected,
the Netherlanders soon regained that from them, which the old Company had
gotten before, co:
and procured an Edict of the States general, that it should be lawful for
Tare to be made in any of 28 several Towns in the same Edict mentioned,
notwithstanding any contract to the contrary. Now whereas it was by that Edict
left free, and by the custom of Merchants usual, that the surplusage of
length in any Cloth should be cast in compensation of the defect of dreadth,
this also by a new Instruction of the States, touching the Tare cause published
in Print Anno 1617: was taken away: And in this state the Tare cause remains
to this day, and the Merchants Adventurers allow for Tare at the least ten
thousand pounds a year. And yet further the remedy provided for them by the
Act of Parliament 4. Iacobi, in stead of their old remedy by certificates, is
now by a new Act of this last Parliament taken away: the penalties for defects
of Cloth being all given to the poor and the Searchers; but no recompense left
to the party damnified.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS OF HIS Majesty's most Honorable Privy
Counsel. The humble Petition of the Fellowship of the merchants Adventurers of
England.
MOst humbly showing that upon complaint heretofore made by the Petitioners of
the great wrong and damage sustained by them, and the very Trade of this Land,
as well by the unjust Taring and Abatement made by the Merchants of Holland,
and other the united Provinces, under color of defects of the Cloth sold them
by the Petitioners; as also by the immoderate Impositions levied by the Lords
States general upon English Cloth, yet leaving the Cloth of their own Country
free of the same.

It pleased this Honorable Board by their letters dated in February, Anno
1624. to recommend the cause to the Right Honorable the Lord Carleton, then
Ambassador resident with the said Lords States for his late Majesty of blessed
memory, to be by his Lordship negotiated with the said Lords States in his said
Majesty's name, and due redress demanded; wherein after his Lordship had
accordingly made very good entrance, it pleased his Majesty, that is now to
commit the seconding thereof unto the most honorable the Duke of Buckingham,
when his Grace went Ambassador extraordinary to the said Lords States, with
whom also his Grace dealt effectually herein, as the shortness of the time
would then permit.

But both his Grace and the said Lord Carleton returning before the cause could
be brought to an end, by reason of the delays used by the Dutch party, and his
Majesty having sithence until now had no Ambassador there, the Petitioners
for the Interim by mediation of your Lordships obtained his Majesty's Royal
Letters to the said Lords States to accept of the person of Mr. Misselden,
Deputy Governor of the Company of Merchants Adventurers residing at Delfe in
Holland, for the solicitation of the said cause, wherein he has since
accordingly travailed, but as yet without effect: In the mean time the
grievance of Tare has rather increased then otherwise; the Company at Delfe
having made an exact Inquiry and collection of such sums as have bin abated
the last year in this kind, whereof they find the total to be above ten
thousand pound, from December: 1625, to December. 1626.

Now forasmuch as this grievance of Tare, and the other of Imposition are such
as without redress will utterly disable the Petitioners to continue their
Trade: And for that they understand that his Majesty has resolved shortly to
send over the Right Honorable the Lord Carleton aforesaid, as Ambassador
extraordinary to the said Lords States: The Petitioners humble suite is, that
it will please your good Lordshipps to be a means to his Majesty, that the
said causes of Tare and impositions may be committed and given in charge to the
said Lord Carleton to be now by his Lordship resumed and pursued to an
effectual remedy and conclusion: And the said Mr. Misselden that has
solicited the said causes in the Interim as aforesaid, shall attend his
Lordship with full information, as well of that which has passed in his
Lordships absence; as with whatsoever else shall be requisite on the Merchant
part: And the Petitioners shall daily pray.
