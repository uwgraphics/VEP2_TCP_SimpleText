To the Beneuolent Reader
BEneuolent Rearder, my labor in this lytlt Burk, hes been principally to give
all men to understand, quhat appertenis to the Spirit and word of God, in all
Councels that is conuenit in the Name of God, for to have the interpretat^one
of difficill places of the Scripture, and discretione betuix the rycht
understanding, and the wrang of the same, for the decisione of any
controversy, in matters of Religione: And quhat appertenis to men to do in the
same. Nocht forgetting to schaw the nerrest way, to thaim that is at
controversy, quhow they may cum to reconciliation, gif they will be contentit to
have their opinione, or assertione, be ane infallible Judge, without
partiality or favor bearing, mair to ane part nor ane other, Iudgit and
decydit. To this effect, that another the glory of the godly decretis set forth
in Councels, nor the dignity of presidencie, pertening only to the haly
Spirit, be attribute to men in any Councels. Nor it that men, and specially the
simple and Ignorant be diss^uit heirby. For their is money thingis requirit to
ane godly council: and he quha under this term general, or provincial
Council, vnderstandis thaim all confusitly: Swa that he can put na difference
betuix thaim, nor it betuix their offices, pertening to thaim severally, may be
easylie led be way of argumentatione, to confess sindrie absurditeis:
quharesore sic thingis war necessare to be knawin: be all thaim, quha wald have
ane ready answer, to the Papists Sophistical argumentis, or that wald have
ane reasone aganis thaim, that mantenis their Religione (quhilk I may call
rather Idolatry, or superstitione) be Councels and traditionis of men. And
that thou may easylie perceive my proceadingis, aganis this Tractiue of Master
Quintinis, I have put in writ, First his sayings, and thairefter followis my
Answer, with sum obiectionis, that I make for the declaratione of my awin
sayingis, and confutation of his Sophistical Reasonis. And alswa their is addit
heirto ane Schort Table, quhareby the principal headis of this Tractiue salbe
easylie found. As to the fautis, gif any hes been ouer^ene in the prenting, I
wish the gentle Reader to bear with the same, quhare they may be borne with.
Praying thee use this tractiue to the glory of God and c^nforte of thy self,
and his Kirk. And sw^ fair thou weill in the Lord. At the Paedagog of Blasgw.

SEN the beginning of the Reformatione of the Kirk of Scotland, in the true
Christian Religione, amangis all other thingis that our L. Tauellitan, for the
furthsetting of the Religion of Christ, I hard nocht our L^^mair effectiusly
desire any thing, than that I wald make ane Answer to the little Burk, set forth
be Master Quintine Kennedy Commendatare, Abbote of Crosraguell: (inseriuit ane
Compendius ^ractiue conferme to the Scripturs of Al^ychty God, reasone and
authority, declaring the narrest and only way, to establische the conscience
of ane Christian man, in all matters quhilks ar in debait, concerning Faith and
Religione) Quhareby their hes been money mouit to continue still in their auld
superstitione and Idolatry, throw the reasonis contenit in the same, quha had
imbracit the sincere, and true Religione of Christ, or their davis, and it had
been suppressed in it infancy, quhilk wald have brocht both quietness to money
ane in their conscience, and commone peace, with great amity amangis the
inhabitants of this country. And quhowbeit my inhabilitie dissuadit me fra
taking of sic ane interpryse on hand, it our L. earnestfull and godly desire,
was of sa great weicht, and efficacy in my mind, for the great Acts our L.
tuik on hand, first and last, for the mantenance of thaim that was able to have
been oppressed for the Religione of Christ, but fear of any warldly Creature,
or losing of our warldly gudis. And alswa for the great humanity, that I have
found in our L. at all time, monit me (quhen I saw na other, haistely taking
the confutatione heirof on hand) to schaw my labors heirin, that the people of
God sold not be langer abusit with his captions Sophisticatione, sa^far as be
my simple ingyne, they mycht be supportit, to the auancem^nt of the Kingdom of
God: and that the world mycht manifestly know that it was no^ht of Rashness,
that the nobility of this Realm hasart their lives and lan^ is, for the
Reformatione of Religione (as the Papists alledgit) bot for the suppressing of
they things, quhilk was set up aganis the glory of the eternal God, and
commone weill of this Realm.

And because this Buik of M. Q. contenit sa money absurditeis, quhilk wald have
consumit great time, to have confutit thaim all. It chancit weill, that ane
little space before the beginning of the Reformation of the Religion, he
excerptit forth of this hale Buik, ane Schort tractiue, contening the hale
matter of his Buik, as the Copy bearis that he send me, to present to James
Betoune, Archebischop of Glasgw (quha was my good Master and liberal Friend,
quhowbeit for religione we are now seperatit in ane part, as money Fathers and
sons is, in their our dayis) to quhom I pray God, send the trenth and
knawledge of his word: at, that may unit us in Spirit and mind again
together, that hes seperatit us (as apperis) in our warldly kyndenes. And sen
of lait, that I fand this Tractiue, contening the hale substance of his Buik,

M. Quintine Ken. principal conclusion.
THE Kirk of God quhilk trewly is representit be the General Councels, dewly
conuenit, is the only appointit judge be God, to deterne and interpret the
right understanding of the scriptur fra the wra^g, quhensum ever question or
debait rysis for the understanding of the samyn. Trenth it is, the Kirk is
bound to interpret the Scriptures, and pronounce sentence, conform to the
trial and instruction had be the samyn, as the true, evident, and faithful
witness bearer, to the will and mind of the Lord, to the quhilk God is the
only judge, and ^a private nombre of men, quhom godly, or weill learnit that
ever they be. Because and that thing be brought in disputation, quhilk is done
be the hiare powers, conform to their vocation, at the desire of private men:
then sall the world live in perpetual debait and controversy.

To cum till ane resolute understanding of this conclusion abone rehearsit, we
man understand quhat is the Kirk, quhilk I believe is sufficitiently declared in
the beginning of our buke. Swa that heir prolixitly to rehears war superflouus,
nottheles as salbe necessare, for the present we sall do.

The Kirk sum time is taken generally in the Scriptures, for the universal
Congregation, quhairin ar contenit all Christian men. And after that manner the
general councels ar nocht the hale Kirk, for why? Every man quhilk is of the
Kirk (generally taken) is nocht requirit, nor can be conuenit, to do that thing
quhilk appertenis to the general Councels.

Sum-tyme the Kirk is taken mair specially, for the chief Pastoures of the
universal Congregatione: and after this special manner, the general councels
ar the true Kirk of God, and representis the universal Congregation, having
authority to interpret the Scriptures, as may stand to the weill and quietness
of the hale Congregatione.

M. Ihone Dauidsonis Answer.
To make this matter plainer to the Reader, quhairupon our hale disputation
standis. I thought best, or I reasonit aganis his conclusion: quhilk of it self
is sumpart intricat, and difficil, throw sum wordis of it, that may have dowble
understanding: quhilk he appearis to have said plainly and simply, bot with
ane dowble face (quhilk every man perceauis nocht) that he may induce men the
readiar to his purpose, saying. The Kirk of God is the only appointit Judge be
God, to decerne and interpret the rycht understanding of the Scripture, fra
the wrang: for their worhis (the rycht understanding of the Scriptures and the
wrang) may move sum men to think that the Scripture hes ane wrang understanding
of it awm nature, quhairby they may be mouit the easyar, to believe that God had
appointit the Kirk, or sum other Judge, to decerne the right understanding of
it, fra the wrang: and that the Scripture could nocht be ane Judge to decerne
the samyn, for than it had been ane Judge to it self, in it awin cause. Or be
their wordis (the rycht understanding of the Scripture, and the wrang) he
vnderstandis the rycht understanding of the Scripture, and the wrang, that men
takkis of the Scripture, throw their awin ignorance, other of the ordinary
means (quhairby God geuis the understanding of his Scriptures) or of the
difficill matter, contenit under the words of the Scripture, or of the
interpretation of the Scriptures, out of ane language in ane other, or any
other ways.

And give he vnderstandis in his conclusion, that the Scripture of God hes ane
rycht understanding and ane wrang, be it awin nature, I say, that his
conclusion (quhilk he haldis to be als sure as it war ane decrete of the haly
Spirit) includis in the self; ane manifest falset, quhilk is, that the
Scripture of God hes ane wrang understanding, quhilk it hes nocht, for the
Scripture gives nocht ane wrang understanding, nor ane wrang interpretation of
it self: bot men that is at controversy for matters of Religione, throw
ignorance, or sum other purpose, to establische their action, sum of thaim
interpretis, and vnderstandis the Scripture wrang, and alledgis their
interpretation and understanding to be rycht (be fit ordinary meanis as God
hes geuin to men to prove, or seik the understanding of the Scripture to be
rycht) that they conceive of it. As ar the sciences callit liberal arts, the
knawledge of the three principal languages, conference of Scriptures with
Scripturs, the preceptis of the may Ancient Doctors, and siclyke thingis that
seruis men, to bring thaim to the knawledge of the Scriptures: quhilk
notwithstanding, men often times uses nocht rychtly, throw their awin ignorance.
Swa they tak ane wra^g understanding of the Scriptur, quhilk it geuis nocht to
thaim, because their is na thing wrang in it. As we may understand be Peter, in
the end of his Second Epistle, saying. In the Epistles of Paul, their is sum
thingis hard to be understand, quhilk they that are vnlearnit, and unstable
peruertis, as they do also other Scriptures, unto their awin destruction. e
thairfore belouit (sayis he) seeing e know their thingis before, be war,
inauentures e be also plukit away with the error of the wickit, and fall fra
all our stedfastnes. Mark weill godly Reader, Peter sayis, the Scriptures is
hard to be understand, and thairfore he exhortis the faithful, that they be
nocht led away with the error of the wickit, quhilk cumis nocht of the
Scripture, bot throw Ignorance of the vnlearnit, that peruertis the Scripture:
or of the unstable, men throw their lycht Imaginations. For give God had maid
his Scripture of that nature, that it mycht have had two faces, and
vnderstandingis, as the answers of the Gentile Gods had, men mycht have been
dissauit be the Scriptures of God, as men was be the answers of the Gentile
Gods, quhilk war ungodly to be said. And alswa they men that had fallin in
error, wald have had ane just excusation, that the wrang understanding that
the Scripture gave thaim, was the cause of their fall. Quhairby, now na man
justly can excuse him self, for it hes nocht ane wrang understanding, bot sum
men takis ane wra^g understanding of it, quhilk takis away their excusation,
and layis their error upon their awin ignorance, and unstableness. Quhairfore
(sen the Scripture of God hes nocht ane wrang understanding of it self) it is
manifest that God hes not appointit his Kirk to be Judge, to decerne the rycht
understanding of the Scripture, fea the wrang, that it had of the awin nature,
quhilk give he had done, it war ane great absurdity, for that war als mekle to
say, as God had appointit the Kirk to be Judge, betuix the thing that is, and
is not.

And give he vnderstandis his conclusione on this manner, that the Kirk of God
is the only appointit Judge be God, to decerne and interpret the rycht
understanding of the Scriptures, fea the wrang, that men takis thairof, throw
their awin Ignorance, or any other wayis, to stablishe their part of the
controversy and debait, for matters of Religion, that is rysin betuix thaim,
and any other, as he appearis to understand it, be all his reasons and
groundis, quhairby he intendis to prove his conclusion. I answer, that the Kirk
of God, representit be the general Councels, quhow dewly that ever they be
conuenit, is not the only Judge appointit be God, to decerne the rycht
understanding of the Scriptures, fra the wrang, ^^thensumeuer question or
debait rysis, for the understanding of the same. For in sa far, as M. Q.
interpretis the Kirk, to be the chief Pastors of the universal Congregation.
he sall not ^inne, the hale, nor ane part of thaim appoint it be Go^, (...)
Judge, to decerne the rycht understanding of (...), fra the wrang. For give
they had been appoi^^ o^ God, to be Judges, to decerne the rycht understanding
of the Scripture, fra the wrang: Christ Jesus, or his Ap^^tles had maid sum
mention thairof, in their office, that God hes appointit to thaim in the
Scriptures, that men quhilk had been at controversy for matters of religion,
mycht have had recourse to thaim. Bot their is na mention maid, that they ar
appointit to sit judgment, for Paul speaking in the 4. Chap. to the
Ephesians, of the Apostlis, Prophetis, Euangelistis, Pastors, and teachers,
quhom God hes maid chief Pastors of the universal Congregation, testifeis,
that they ar appointit be God, for the gathering together of the Sainctis, for
the wark of the Ministry, and the edification of the body of Christ. etc.
Siclyke Christ Jesus, at his departing to his Apostles, the chief Pastors of
the universal Congregatione, he gave ane general charge to thaim all, saying,
pas throw the hale world, and preach the Euangell to all Creature. Marck. 16.
alswa in the First Chap. of the Acts of the Apostles, makand na mentione of
sic Judgment, he sayis unto thaim, e sall receive the power of the haly Gaist,
quhen he sall cum on ow, and e sall bear witness unto me, both in Jerusalem,
and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
Siclyke, will we read throw all the Scriptures, the dewetie of ane Bischope, or
ane Elder, quha hes been aye sen the Apostles dayis, haldin chief Pastors of
the universal Congregatione: we sall never find that they ar appointit be
God, as Judges, to decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture, fra the
wrang. Bot the may thing, that they ar requirit with, to do aganis thaim that
takis of the Scripture ane wrang understanding, is, to exhort with halsum
doctrine, and improve thaim that sayis aganis it. Tit. 1.9. and that they sall
flee foulische questiones, and Genealogeis, and contentions, and brawlingis
about the Law. And siclyke, they sold reject him, that is ane heretyke, after
ane or two admonitions. Tit. 3.10. In this, nor na other Scriptures, sayis
Christ Jesus, nor his Apostles, that the chief Pastors salbe Judges, nor
commandis he thaim to Judge any controuerseis, bot that they flee contentions,
and the authors of contentions, as is heretykes. And without authority of
Scripture, it is wrang and ungodly, to affirm any thing to be done be God,
that he hes not done.

And give the kirk be nocht Judge, appointit be God in the Scri^^^res, to
decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture (...) ^he wrang, quhen debait
rysis for the same. I dout not b^ men will desire to know quhome God hes
appointit Judges, or quhom they that is at controversy, for the understanding
of any Scripture, sal make their Judge, for to decerne the rycht understanding
of the Scripture, fra the wrang, that men takis of it quhen any question or
debait rysis for the same: considering it is necessare, that they have ane
Judge that is at debait, for the understanding of the Scripture. I answer, that
God hes appointit na Judge in this matter, for give God had appointit ane Judge,
to have decernit the rycht understanding of the Scripture, fra the wrang, it
wald have been thocht that their had been sum falls, or wrang thing in the
Scripturs: and than quhatsumeuer interpretation had been geuin of any place
thairof, quhidder it had been manifest or obscure, sum men fould have been
troublie in their conscience, quhill they had cum to that Judge appointit be
God, in all matters of religione, quhilk had maid great perturbation in the Kirk.

For than never man wald have credit the plain Text of the Scripture, mait
nor the obscure, quhil they had hard the judge, that God had appointit. And
swa, that Judge soulde have gottin mair credit nor the word of God, quhilk
had been ane great inco^uenient. Bot they that hes had any controversy in
times bygaine, for the decerning of the rycht understanding of the Scripture,
fra the wrang, and for the opinions that men hes taken of the Scripture, hes
chusit their judge as they plesit. And because that Christ Jesus hes left na
thing to his Kirk bot his Scriptures, to bear witness of all thingis that is
requirit for our Saluatione to be knawin of him. Ihon. 5. and his Spirit to
teach us all verity be men (as his mouth) outwartly, and inwartly be him
self, workand in our hartis: quhilk ar the only thingis quhairby we have
knawledge of the verity, and discretione, betuix the verity and the falset,
in matters concerning Religione: sum men thairfore hes referrit the Judgment of
their controversy, to the word and Spirit of God, as their judges,
Arbitraris. For this is the only thingis, that they quha hes been at
controversy for matters of Religione, hes socht to have their action iudgit be:
as we may see to have been done be Christ Jesus, and money weil learnit and
godly men. For Christ Jesus affirming him self to be the Son of God, and the
Iowes affirming the contrary, as is writtin in the.5. Chap. of Ihon, in sa far
as they wald have slain him, he appeillis thaim to the Scriptures, to be
iudgit thairby, saying, search the Scriptures, for in thaim e think to have the
Eternal life: and they ar they quhilk testifeis of me. Their culde nocht be
ane greater controversy, or question, for any matter of Religione, nor this
was, betuix Christ Jesus and the Iowes (quha than in earth was the only Kirk
of God) give he was the Son of God, equale to the Father, or nocht? and he
hes referrit him self, as to his awin godly majesty, manhead, and doctrine, to
be Iudgit be the Scriptures in this controversy and nocht unto thaim quha had
the power in the kirk, and the Iowes sayis na thing aganis the Scriptures in
this place, quhy they may not be judge betuix thaim, And it the Scriptures was
nocht the appointit Judge be God, betuix Christ Jesus and the Iowes.

And give any man will object, that quhatsumeuer thing bearis witness, it can
nocht be ane Judge in the same self cause, bot the Scripture bearis witness of
Christ, betuix him and the Iowes, give he be the Son of God, or nocht:
thairfore they can nocht be Judge, because they bear witness of him. I answer,
that in warldly and mortal thingis, for using of parcialitie, ane thing can
nocht gudlie be both Judge and witness: bot in they thingis that is everlasting
and immortal, quhilk can nocht use parcialitie (as is the word of God) ane
thing may both bear witness and be Judge. Thairfore it is na inconvenient,
that the Scriptures both bear witness and be Judge in any controversy for
matters of Religion, for and their war two that disaggreit upon ane Artickle of
our believe (as for exemple) give ane denyit that Christ Jesus was borne of ane
Virgin, and ane other affirmit that he was borne of ane Virgin, and their two
wald refer thaim both to the judgment of the Scripture. And than their
sayingis of Esaias the Prophet, that is spokin of Christ, war brocht to decyde
the controversy. Behald ane Virgin sall conceive and bear ane Son. This
Scripture of Esaias is witness to him, that his assertione was true, quha said
Christ was borne of ane Virgin, and alswa it judges betuix thaim, that the
assertione of the ane, is true, and the other is false. As ane euin reule, is
ane witness to the thing that is euin, that it is euin. And it is a witness to
the thing that is cruikit, that it is cruikit. And alswa betuix the euin and
the cruikit, it is a judge, quhilk decernis the ane to be cruikit, and the
other to be euin. Siclyke the word of God is, betuix two that is at
controversy for any matter of Religione.

Secondly, because the rycht understanding of the Scripture of God, could never
be decernit fra the wrang understanding, that men takis of it, nor na
controversy in matters concerning religion, could be aggreit, bot be the word
and Spirit of God. Their hes never been ane herityke that hes been of any
learning, quhow wickit that ever he was (give he was content to be iudgit, in
the thing he mantenit) bot he hes been content to refer the judgment of his
controversy and assertion, to the Scripture of God: and that be reasone he
could find na other thing, that could be ane infallible Judge in sic matters,
be the quhilk he micht be assurit to have his controversy iudgit and decydit
trewly, without all suspitione of parcialitie, or favor bearing, mair to ane
part nor to ane other.

Thridly, beside this that we have daily experience of, quhaireuer their is
any controversy betuix two, for the understanding of the Scripture of God,
they have takin thaim to be Iudgit be the Spirit and infallible word of God.
Augustine teachis us to choose the word and Spirit of God to be our Judge,
quhen any controversy for matters of Religione is amangis us. First in the.29.
Sermon of the wordis of the Apostle, saying, quhen betuix us their is sic ane
controversy resyn, that ane sayis to me, let me understand that I may believe.
And I answer to him, ea, rather believe that thou may understand, with this
controversy we cum to the Judge, lat another of us presume to have the sentence
for him, quhat judge ar we able to find? All being soche, I know nocht give we
can find ane better Judge, than ane man be quhom God speakis. Thairfore let us
nocht g^ ^ in this matter, and this controversy, to warldly and humane letters.
The Poet mat ^or judge betuix us, bot the Prophet. And in the last part of the
samyn Sermon (sayis he) lat the Prophet Judge, ea, rather lat God Judge be the
Pro^het, let us both hald our p^a^e, quhat we have said, it is hard. Let me
vnder^^and sayis thou, that I may believe: and I said, believe that thou may
understand: lat the Prophet answer, without e believe, e sall not understand.
Esaias. 7. this sayis Augustine. Now Augustine, heir be the decisione of his
controversy, teachis us in controuerseis, nocht to seik the Kirk to be our
Judge (quhilk as M. Q. allegis, is the only appointit Judge be God) or the
general Councels, or the Scriptures of men (as is the wrytingis of profane
Poetis to be Judges) bot only the Spirit and word of God. For give Augustine
had knawin, that God had appointit his Kirk to be the only Judge, to decerne
the rycht understanding of the Scripture, fra the ^rang: he had said, I know
nocht give God hes appointit ane better judge than his kirk, quhilk he sayis
not, bot I know not sayis he) give we can find ane better Judge, than ane man
be quhome God speakis. Quhairfore it is plain, that Augustine and his
aduersare knew their Judge, not to stand in Gods appointing, bot in their awin
finding and choosing, to Judge their controversy: saying, lat the Prophet
Judge, ea, or rather, lat God Judge be the Prophet. Give the Prophet had been
appointit Judge be God, or give God walde have had the Judgment referrit only
to him self. Augustine had not said, lat the Prophet Judge, or rather God. Be
the quhilk, all men may cleirly see, that he meanis not that he desyrit the
Prophet, be reasone of his manly wit or reasone, to be Judge: or God to descend
out of heaven to be Judge: bot he d^syris the word of God, spokin be man (as
the mouth of God the haly Spirit) to Judge their controversy. And thairfore,
quhair he sayis heirefter, lat the Prophet answer. He meanis nocht that the
Prophet Esaias, quha was departit neirby, ane t^ousand eir or Augustine was
borne, sold tyse again, and be their Judge: bot he desyris the word of God,
quhilk the Prophet left i^ writ to the kirk of God, to be Judge, as may be
plainly perceauit be Augustines wordis.

Siclyke Augustine in the.15. Sermon of the wordis of the Lord, schawis quhow
the rycht understanding is Iudgit fra the wrang, be the word of God, of this
two places of scripture. (...) thy brother faileis aganis the, correct him
betuix the, and him only. Math. 18. And reprove sinnares oppenly, that vthers
may have fear. 1. Timot. 5. Quhat do we (sayis Augustine)? heir we this
controversy, as judges? God forbid. ea, rather being co^stitute under the
judge, let us knok that we may i^petrat to have it oppinit to us, let us flee
under the wyngis of our Lord God, for he hes nocht spokin contrare to his
Apostles, because in him he hes spokin, as he sayis, will e tak experience of
him that speakis in me Christ? 2. Corinthians. 13. Christ in the Euangel, Christ
in the Apostole, tharefore Christ said both the ane, and the other. Ane be his
awin mouth, the other be the mouth of his Herald. And this far Augustine.
Quha of this two Scripturs, because he seis that me^ may tak ane wra^g
understanding of thaim, as give ane oppin Synnare wald say to ane Minister,
because I am our brother, e sulde correct me secretly, and siclyke ane
Minister, give he walde say to ane, quhom he knew to have synnit secretly,
thou man be oppinlie correctit, because Paul biddis correct synnars oppinlie.

Tharefore he will nocht tak on hand to be judge, for to decerne the rycht
understanding fra the wrang of this two Scripturs: bot as ane weill learnit man
(be the oppinning of the Scripturs, that men may see quhow the Scripture iudgis
the rycht understanding of thaim self, fra the wra^g, that is takin of thaim)
he vsis the ordinary meanis on this manner, saying, take tent give thy brother
hes faileit aganis the, correct him betuix him and the only. Quhy? because he
hes synnit aganis the. Quhat is that, he hes synnit aganis the? thou knawis
that he hes sinnit, because it was secret, quhen he Synnit aganis the, seik
ane secreit betuix the and him, quhe^ thou correctis him, that hes faileit
aganis the. For give thou knawis only that he hes sinnit aganis the, and thou
before all men wald reprove him, thou ar nocht ane correctour, bot ane reuelare.

And after this, it followis, bot give he hes done to the injury in the
audience of money, he hes faileit aganis thaim, quhom he hes maid wytnes of his
iniquity: Tharefore they thingis ar to be correctit oppinlie before all me^.
This far Augustine, Quha be their sayings, seikis nocht the Judgment of the
Kirk, to decerne the rycht understanding of their two places fra the wrang, as
may be planelie sein, bot is content to flee under the wyngis of the Lord
(that is his Scripture) and heir the judgment of Gods word, be the quhilk, he
schawis quhow their wordis (aganis the) geuis us lycht to understand, and
conciliat both their places. And as ane faithful judge decernis to us, quhom
we sall correct secretly, and quhom oppinlie, quhilk is the discretione of the
rycht understanding of this Scripturis, fra the wrang: for without their wordis
(aganis the) the kirk nor na man could have iudgit, quhilk man sulde have been
correct secretly, and quhilk oppinlie. As Augustine the Instrument of God
makis manifest heir to the world. Be their two sayings of Augustine all men may
perfytlie see that Augustine, and his aduersoure hes chesit the spirit and
Scripture of God, to be their judge, be the quhilk their debait was fynissit,
making na mentione of the kirk, as ane judge appoyntit to thaim be God.

And because the Scripture of God, on the quhilk the co^trouerseis of Religione
is groundit, ar often times obscure, and sum Scripturs appearis to be repugnant
to vthers. And for diverse causis, their is syndrie sensis collectit of thaim,
far different, their hes been money weill learnit me^ (because they could
nocht he satisfyit in their controversy be the plane text of Scripture) that
hes socht ane little nombre, or ane great multitude, of the may godly and weil
learnit me^ in the Scripturs, having good understanding of the ordinary
meanis, quhareby the spirit of God communicatis the rycht understanding of his
word to his Kirk: quha being conuenit together, hes sumtyme borne the name of
ane general, sumtyme of ane provincial council.

And alswa because the spirit of God speakis to men in controuerseis concerning
Religione, outwarlie, bot be men: they have referrit their controversy to the
judgment of the word and spirit of God: and to men, as concerning the using
and treatyng of the ordinary meanis, quhareby the spirit of God commoundlie
geuis the understanding of the Scripture, and the discretione of the rycht
understanding thareof fra the wrang: that they mycht have the decisione of
their controversy, first be the infallible judgment of the word and spirit
of God, as the solid and true judgment, ground of all judgments concerning
religion: and secondly, be the consenting or approving judgment, of godly and
weil learnit me^ (nocht that the judgment of the word of God, mistars the
consent or approbatione of me^, bot for the weakness, and infirmity of man,
that can credit na thing without teachement, and instructione of vthers)
safarre as they ar mouit to consent with the word of God, be the operatione of
the haly spirit, brynging the Scripturs to their remembrance, that makis for
the decisione, of the controversy: and giving thaim grace of using, and
uttering, of the ordinary meanis, quhilk seruis for the decisione of the
controversy: quhilk I can nocht call properly ane judgment, bot ane consent
and approbatione of men, vtering and approving the thing to the world, be word
or wryt, that is iudgit be the word of God. And this may be prouin manifestly
in the Primitive Kirk, to have been obseruit in the 15. Cap. of the Acts,
quhare the co^tentione being great betuix Paul and Barnabas, and they that
come fra Iowry, and teachit, that the Gentiles could nocht be save, without
they had been circumcisit, because their was money Scripturs, that appearit to
make for both the partis of the questione, and na religione was stablesit in
they dayis, bot be the plane word of God. The kirk of Antiochia that could
nocht be content with the judgment of Scripture, allegit als weill for the ane
side, as for the other, ordanit that Paul, and Barnabas, and certane vthers of
thaim, sulde go up to Jerusalem unto the Apostolis, and Elders (quhom they knew
to be illuminat with the treuth of Gods word) to have the ordinary meanis
vsit (quhareby the spirit of God geuis the understanding of his Scripturs to
men) about this questione. Give it was necessare, that the Gentiles that
beleuit should be circumcisit, or nocht? we read nocht that the Apostles, and
Eldars of the kirk of Jerusalem was appoyntit be God to be judges to this, or
siclyke questionis. Bot that the kirk of Antiochia, ordanit that Paul and
Barnabas, (quha doutit nocht in the matter as salbe said heirefter) and vthers
of thaim should pass to the Apostles and Elders of Jerusalem, as men having the
ordinary meanis, quhareby the spirit of God geuis the understanding of his
word (as be his mouth) to the world, that they mycht have be oppinning of the
Scripturs, the judgment of the word and spirit of God, be thaim, as he had
geuin thaim utterance, and understanding, to satisfy thaim that was at
controversy for this questione. And thairfore this questione being mouit to
the Congregatione, the Apostles and Elders, conuenit, nocht to judge on the
questione be their natural wisdom, or to define their upon be ane lang
consuetude, bot to use the ordinary meanis, quhareby God geuis the
understanding of his scripture, that be thaim, they mycht have the knawledge of
they Scripturs, that concernit the questione that was mouit in the
congregatione: and quhen they had done all they could do, after lang
disputatione submittit thaim self to the judgment of the haly spirit, and
word of God, quhilk he had spokin lang before, be the mouth of the Prophetis,
and at that conuentione of the kirk of Jerusalem, spak the same word again be
the mouth of the Apostole: and because the spirit and word of God, iudgit and
decernit, that circumcisione was nocht necessare, to the Gentiles that beleuit:
the controversy was iudgit, and endit be all their consentis, that was of the
council. And their restit na mair to the kirk of Jerusalem to do, bot to schaw
to the world, that quhilk the word of God iudgit, and the haly spirit dytit to
thaim, and gave thaim utterance, to schaw be word or wryt, as his mouth and
wryttars: quhilk may be clearlie perceauit be the decrete of the haly Spirit
wryttin in the said Cap. It hes pleasit the haly spirit and us. etc. In the
first part of the decreit, they have put the haly spirit their judge, gyde, and
president, to signify to the world that they have iudgit na thing, bot
subscriuit to the judgment of the spirit and word of God: And alswa that they
have put na thing in wryt, bot as he hes dytit unto thaim, quhowbeit they ar
namit i^ the wryttin decrete: nocht that I say this of my fantasy, bot after
the commone manner of the Scripturs speaking: quhilk is accustumit to put the
name of the Ministers after the name of God: nocht that they attrybut thareby
to the M^nisters that appertenes only to God, bot to testify unto the world
that God is treulie with thaim, and that they have attemptit na thing bot that,
of the quhilk God is the author. And to conferme the same with authority of
Scripture, it is wryttin Exodus 14. They beleuit the Lord, and Moses his
seruand. The people of Israel could nocht believe God, and be gydit be his
government without they had beleuit Moses quhome he constitute gouernoure to
thaim: and it suppose this scripture sayis they beleuit Moses, we attribut not
that faith, with the quhilk they beleuit God, to Moses: bot that they beleuit
the doctrine, that he teachit thaim in the name of the Lord. Siclyke in this
decrete, it hes pleasit the haly spirit and us. etc. after the haly spirit, is
namit the Apostles, Elders and brethren, the membris of the kirk under this
word (ws) nocht that they could make any decrete of faith to thaim that was at
controversy, for the kirk can nocht make ane decrete or Article that may bind
man to believe any thing, as this dois. Q tharefore to speak to the treuth, this
decrete is the haly spiritis: and it appertenis no mair to the Apostles and
kirk of Jerusalem, nor the Kingis Proclamatione pertenis to the wryttars and
Heraldis, that wryttis and proclamis it.

And on like manner it hes pleasit the kirk quhen their hes been any
controversy in matters of religione, to co^uene the may godly and weill
learnit men of the kirk, nocht to have their awin judgment, bot be the
ordinary meanis using, to see and understand the judgment of the word of God,
quhilk is nocht else, bot the judgment of the haly spirit. For they have nocht
diverse judgments: quhilk the Scripturs attributis sumtyme to men (as Paul
saying. The spiritual man iudgis all, and is iudgit be nane. 1. Corinthians. 2.
For the union that is betuix the spirit of God and the spirit of man, that
adheris to the Lord God: nocht that the judgment hes respect to me^, quhare
Paul sayis the spiritual man iudgis al, bot to the spirit of God that reuelis
and speakis be men, the judgments contenit in his word, as his mouth and
ministeris, the quhilk after the word, is the outwart, and declaring judge of
the will of God to the rest of the membris of the Kirk: quharefore Paul sayis
nocht, that the man iudgis all, bot the spiritual man: In quho^ their is to be
considerit the natural man, that can do na thing in spiritual effaris, and the
spirit of God quha vsis the man (as his mouth) to declare his will and
judgment to the world, quharefore Paul attributis judgment to spiritual
men. Conform to this sayings, is alswa Augustine aganis Maximinus the Arriane,
saying, another I the council of Nicene, nor thou the council of Ariminence,
sold bring in to preiuge, nor I be the authority of this, nor thou be the
authority of it, sold be bound, bot he the authority of the Scripturs, nocht
to any man proper, bot co^moune wytnes of both, lat ane matter with ane other,
ane reasone with ane reasone, ane cause with ane cause, contend. Heir Augustine
will another grant to him self, nor vtheris sic privilege, that the council of
Nicene, or Ariminence sall preiuge any matter, bot he will have the verity of
the cause iudgit be the Scripture, quhilk he haldis of greatare authority nor
the council. Q tharefore we may see plainly that Augustine siclyke geuis na
authority to men, that is conuenit in the councellis, or vtherwayis, to judge
controuerseis, bot to the Scripturs the Testimoneis of the haly Spirit.

Swa will we consider the matter of judgment, in all controuerseis for religione
perfytlie, we sall find the word, and spirit of God to be the only judges, be
the quhilk all controversy concerning religione is iudgit, endit, and
pacefyit: and nocht the kirk. For in all debait concerning religione, the kirk
man first hear quhat the word of God sayis, spokin be the spirit of God, for
it is the lycht in all doutsum materis of religione, and with that part of the
controversy, that ever the word of God standis, and aggreis, the kirk man
stand and consent with the same. For give the kirk aggreit and consentit, with
ane other part of the controversy, than the word of God consentis, and aggreis
with, the kirk war aganis the Scripture, quhilk war ane great absurdity, and
swa it walde cease in that part to be the Kirk of God. And sen it is swa, that
the Kirk man stand and aggre to the delyuerance, and judgment of the word of
God: the word of God man have first iudgit and endit the controversy, to the
^uhilk the kirk man consent and aggre, or it can aggre thareto For na thing can
aggre, nor consent to the thing it knawis nocht, Tharefore the controversy man
be first endit and iudgit be the word of God, vtherwayis the kirk can nocht
consent mair to ane part, nor to ane other of the controversy. As was done in
the controversy, quhilk was brocht before the Apostles frathe Kirk of
Antiochia, to Jerusalem: quhare the kirk culde Judge na thing, quhill the word
of God was first hard in their assemble, quhat it Iudgit in the matter. And
because the word of God, Iudgit that the Gentiles, quhilk beleuit, mistert
nocht to be circumcisit for their Saluatione. The Apostles, Elders, and
brethren, followit the Judgment of the word of God, quhilk was confirmit be
Miraclis, as Paul and Barnabas testifeis, and giving of the haly Spirit to the
Gentiles, as Peter schawis, swa the Kirk of Jerusalem culde ascribe na
Judgment of the controversy to thaim self, for only it appertenit to thaim,
to utter to the world, the judgment of Gods word, conform to the
discretione, geuin to thaim be the haly Spirit.

Finally, gif the kirk had been appoitit judge be God, to deterne the rycht
understanding of the scripture fra the wra^g, quhensumeuer questione had risen
for the understanding of the same: it had been necessare, that the Latin Kirk,
and the Greik, had been first appointit be God Judges, to have decernit,
quhilk Text of Greik, and Latin, had been faithfully, according to the
original translatit, and quhilk nocht, or they had been appointit Judges, to
decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture, fra the wrang. Bot in na part
of the Scripture, hes God appointit the Kirk as Judge, to decerne, quhilk Text
is trewly translatit, according to the Original, and quhilk nocht. And
thairfore, he hes nocht appointit the Kirk to decerne the rycht understanding
of the Scripture, fra the wrang: for the decerning of the rycht Text, fra the
wrang, man precede the rycht understanding and interpretatione: be reasone
their was never men unto this day, that culde be Judges, to decerne the rycht
understanding of the Scripture, fra the wrang, of ane Text, quhilk they
understood nocht, or that war wrang interpret, as the commune translatione is,
in diverse and sindrie places, and notit be sindrie cunning men, as be
Augustinus Eugubinus, Erasmus Roterodamus, Nicolaus Delyra, and sindrie vthers,
quhair another the Greik, nor the Latin Text aggreis with the original Text of
Hebrew, of the auld Testament, nor it the Latin Text aggreis with the original
Greik Text of the new Testament. And sen the Latin Kirk hes admittit ane Text
to be red, and interpret neirby ane 1166. eris, be their Judgment, that is
notit to be wrang translatit, in sindrie and diverse places (of the quhilk kirk
I believe M. Q speakis) their is na man that can think justly, that God wald
appoint thaim to be judges, to decerne betuix the rycht understanding of the
Text of the Scripture and the wrang, that culd nocht judge perfytlie on the
translatione of the text. For than God had appoyntit us ane blind, and
vncertane judge, to decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture fra the
wrang.

For he that is vncertane in the text, of necessite he man be vncertane to make
ane gloss on the text. And give any man thinkis (because our Forebears is
departit at peace of the Lord God, having na other translatione nor the
commune translatione, that the kirk hes receauit) that it is ane great
arroga^ce, to desire of the Scripture ane new translatione mair perfyte, or
that any other interpretatione soulde be socht, nor hes been vsit before be the
ancient Fatheris, quha was weill exercit in the Scripturs. I answer, that it is
nocht alyke, to be ane interpretour, ane Prophet, or ane Evangelist. For the
Prophet and Evangelist can nocht dissaue, nor be disseauit. Bot give I say,
that ane i^terpretour hes errit fra the mind of the author, throw obscurenes,
or ignorance of the languagis, I do him na wra^g, give the place of the
Scripture be schawin, quharein he hes faileit, quhilk was the mind of Hierome
in the Epistole ad fretelam. And alswa of Augustine. Libr. 2. de doctrina
Christiana: Quhen they desire us to go to the Originale text, quhen any
questione happinnis in the Greik, or Latin text. For it is ane manly office
to interpret, quhilk of ane Prophet, or Evangelist, I dar nocht say. Siclyke
it is nocht wrang to say, that their is ane great difference betuixt the
understanding of the law of God, that is sufficient to be knawin for ane mannis
saluatione, and the understanding of the law of God, that is requirit in ane
prechour, and in thaim, that sulde be membris of generale, or prouinciale
counsels, to quhom it appertenis to have sa perfyte understanding, that they
can give ane count of the leist point of the law. Tharefore it may stand weill
that be the commune translatione men mycht be instructit sufficiently to their
Saluatione. And that they quha hes been estemit chief Pastors of the kirk, and
men able to have been members of General, or Provincial Councels, could
nocht be instructit sufficiently, be the commune translatione in all
controuerseis, that mycht happin, for matters of Religione. And gif it mycht be,
that the Roman kirk hes receauit be it awin Judgment the commune
translatione, quhilk could nocht serve thaim for all controuerseis, concerning
Religione, throw the errors that is found in the translatione, their is na man
that can say than, that they war worthy to be Judges, to decerne the rycht
understanding of the Scripture, fra the wrang: or to interpret the Scriptures
that understood not perfitely the text. For he that is vncertane in the Text,
of necessity he man be vncertane in the exposition. Quhairfore I may weill
conclude, be reasone, Doctors sayingis, and Scripture, that the kirk is na
wayis appointit Judge be God, to decerne the rycht understanding of the
Scripture, fra the wrang: bot the word and Spirit of God, is chosin Judges be
thaim, quha is at controversy for Religion, for the causes before exprimit:
for quhidder they that is at controversy for Religione, referris the Judgment
of their controversy to the word of God, or to ane multitude of men, speaking
be the Spirit of God. Alwayis it is force, that they, and alswa the multitude,
to quhom they refer tha^r controversy, man aye refer the controversy,
quhilk is referrit to thaim, to the Judgment of the word and Spirit of God.
For the kirk, be it awin Judgment, or warldly reasone, can nocht interpret
the Scriptures, nor pronounce sentence, nor deceive the rycht understanding fra
the wrang, of the Scriptures, as Judges: bot as Ministers of Gods word, the
kirk may declare the difficill Scriptures, quhilk is in controversy, as other
places of the Scripture, mair plain geuis the true interpretation of thaime,
and to schaw the warlde, the thing that the word Iuges to be done, and the
sentence quhilk it geuis thaim to pronounce, be the ordinary meanis: and that,
as the Spirit of God, geuis thaim utterance.

As to the cause, quhairfore he wald have the kirk to be the only appointit
Judge be God, to decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture, fra the
wrang, in all debaitis concerning Religione. And the decreitis geuin be the
Judgment of his Roman kirk (as appearis) he wald have unchangeable, and
Eternalle, as they war the Law of God, saying: Because and that thing be brocht
in disputatione again, quhilk is done be the hiare powers, conform to their
vocatione, at the desire of private men, than sall the world live in perpetual
debait and controversy. I answer, that he hes na les nor cause, to desire they
thingis that is Iudgit, and decretit be the Roman Kirk (quhilk I dout not, bot
he callis the hiare powers) to be haldin be the world, unchangeable, for and
the Lawis and Decreits of the Roman Kirk, be br^cht to examinatione, to the
tueche stare the word of God, and thareby examinat, and Iudgit, their salbe
money of thaim found still of superstitione, latting be to speak of their
ungodliness: quhilk give they hade been groundit on the word of God, they wald
never have fearit quhow often they had been examinat and brocht in disputation.
For na examinatione can subvert the verity, bot make it the mair strenthy, and
the mair manifest to the warlde. Bot now, because they know that their
constitutions can nocht bide ane trial, as they decretis may do, quhilk is
groundit on Goddis word: they cry, that and the thing that is done be the
hieare powers be brocht in disputatione again be private men, the warlde sall
leave in perpetual debait. They walde feign stey us with the wind of the word
of perturbatione, as we should ouersee, and neglect the work and will of God,
for fear of any warldlie perturbatione that may cum upon us, or vthers, for
gainstanding of their ungodly decretis: they disseaue both thaim selves and
all vthers, quha lippi^^^s in thaim. For their is na private man, that will
desire their decretis callit to desputatione for his pleasoure: bot because,
the plain word of God mou^s thaim thareto, quhilk is the thing that they
gainstand, and the only cause of the perturbatione of the hale world. And
because they can nocht sufficiently prove their decretis be Scripture to be
godly. Nor it can they deny, bot they have been ane great part of the
perturbatione of the warlde, and now because they ar able al to sal throw
wanting of ane good ground: for the establesing of thaim, they have i^uentit
ane other grondles ground, alledgeing the chief Pastors to be the Kirk, and
without authority of Scripture, this kirk to be the only appoyntit Judge be
God, to Judge all co^trouerseis, concerning Religione, having power of the hale
universal kirk, to make decretis, and gif sentences as they please. And this
decretis they walde have vnexaminable: quhilk in my mind can, never want
suspitione, of sum falset, superstione, Hypocrisy, Idolatry, or singular
commodity, quhilk walde cum to the lycht to their schame, and they tholit ane
trial to be taken of their Decretis, that they hade aneis setsurth. Bot this is
far by the simplicity and consuclude of the Kirk of God, for nocht only hes
it been content, that the Decretis, quhilk is groundit on the word of God, and
dytit be the haly Spirit, and that it hes put in writ, thole judgment, and
trial of the word of God: Bot alswa the Apostles (quha brocht na thing in the
kirk, bot that, quhilk the haly Spirit spak be thaim, as his mouth) was
content, that their doctrine sold be examinat, be the judgment of the
Scripture: as Paul was content, that his doctrine, quhilk he teachit in
Antiochia, sold be tryit be the Judgment of Gods word, before the Apostles,
Elders, and brethren in Jerusalem: as is writtin in the.15. Chap. of the Acts.
Siclyke, the Thessalonians ar commendit in the scripture, because that they
searchit the Scriptures daily, gif Paul's doctrine was true, or nocht. Acto.
17. Mairattoure, this manner of examinatione, appearis to bring na little profet
to the Kirk of God, for the ofter that any decrete or doctrine be tryit be the
Scripturs, the mair sure it is, and they that hes been waik in the Faith, that
they have had be the doctrine of man, or any decrete groundit on the Scripture,
the trial hes geuin thaim occasion to be weill confirmit in their Faith. For
it is no meruall, bot ane man sall believe that thing rather, quhilk hes often
times tholit trial of Scriptures, nor it that hes never tholit. Now gif any man
thinkis heirfore, that I bear disdane at the general Councels, because I wald
have they decretis brocht again in disputatione, quhilk had been aneis
decretit be thaim, quhairin their was, or is, any suspitione of disaggreance,
betuix thaim and the word of God. I answer, that thait is money questions cum
in disputatione their dayis, that hes never been justly and sincerely discussit
be the Councels, quhilk gif they be brocht again, at this time in
controversy, and all utterly abolisit, be the solid, and infallible
testimoneis of the Scripture, their is na godly man, that can be justly
offendit. And quhowbeit, the decretis of sum Council, had been the decretis of
the haly Spirit, and it had pleasit the Kirk to have socht be the Judgment of
the word of God, gif they decretis had been conform to the word of God, or
nocht, it had done na injury to the haly Spirit, for it is nocht the will of
the haly Spirit, that our Faith lean upon the decretis of man, in place of
Gods word. And thairfore, gif any decretis of the Ro^ane Kirk, be the
Judgment of Gods word, had been found, not to have cum of the haly Spirit,
and had been haldin be the world to have been the haly Spirits. The Kirk of
God had do^e good service to God, for the abolysing of thaim. For it is bot
reasone, that the word of God be knawin, fra the dec^etes of me^, quhilk can
nocht be, bot be trial of the word of God. But at this time, I will say na
mair of the councels: bot God willing I sall schaw M. Q. clearly, quhow their
hes been verray few godly councels, sen Siluesters dayis (quhow dewely that
ever they appearit to the warl^, they war co^uenit) conform to the Council of
the Apostles, q^hilk is maid mentione of, in the.15. Chap. of the Acts of the
Apostles: make of their decretis quhat he please: nocht that I bear disdain at
the general, or provincial Councels, for I believe that na godly man is of
that mind, bot he wald have godly and weill learnit men (quhilk with the
Spirit and word of God, makis the true Councels) conuening to reasone, to
conserre and to use all they ordinary meanis, quhairby the Spirit of God
geuis understanding of his Scriptures, and the Scriptures geuis true Judgment
of all controuerseis to the Kirk, that their may be peace, and tranquillity aye
thairin, quhairof presently I will nocht speak: bot leauis M.Q. conclusion with
sic reasons, as my sohre wit could find aganis the same, for the ma^tenance of
the verity, to the Judgment of thayis, quha with brotherly, and godly lufe,
will support my imperfection, quh^ir I have neglectit or ouersene any thing,
pertening to ane sufficient Confutatione of his First conclusione: and passis
to the impugnatione of they reasons, quhairwith he takis to prove and confirm
his foresaid conclusione.

Heir followis M. Q. First Reasone, quhairby he thinkis that he confermis his
foresaid conclusione, without Scripture.
WE prove the foresaidis on this manner. It is sure, that like as Almychty God
hes appointit his Kirk and congregatione, necessarelie to be unite together in
ane Faith be Baptism, having his word and Law. Swa it is necessare, that
prouisione be had, to decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture fra the
wrang, specially, quhensumeuer question or debait rysis for the samyn,
vtherwayis, the having of the Scriptures, without the understanding of the
samyn, war little or na thing profitable to the Congregatione. Bot swa it is,
that all hereseis war suppressed, and the rycht understanding of the Scripture
fra the wrang, was decernit in all aiges, eris and times, (sen the time of the
Apostles) be the general councels. Thairfore it followis weill, that the
general Councels war the special membre of the Congregatione, appointit be
God, representing the hale Kirk to tak ordour in all matters of debait
concerning Religione.

M. Ihone Dauidsonis Answer.
I will nocht stand to give M. Q. the first part of this reasone grantit: bot I
affirm the secund part heirof to be falls quhare he sayis. Bot swa it is, that
all hereseis war suppreste, and the rycht understanding of the Scripture fra
the wrang was decernit in all aigis, eris, and times, (sen the time of the
Apostles) be General councels: and this I prove be diverse reasonis (he taking
the general councels, and the kirk, for the chief Pastors, of the universal
Congregatione as his foresaid interpretion of of the kirk testifyis him to do)
For the hereseis that rays in the kirk of God, sen the time of the Apostles,
was not other wayis suppressed, nor be na other lawful meanis than they war in
the Apostles time. For God hes appoyntit na other manner of way for the
suppressing of thaim in his Scripturs, be command, or exemple. Bot in the
Apostles time, sum was only suppressed be the haly Spirit, and the word of God
properly and trewlye spokin be the Apostlis and Elders (the mouth of the haly
spirit) Actor. 15. as was their heresy, quha teachit that the Gentiles that
beleuit, could nocht be save, without they hade been circu^cisit. For tharefter
that Peter had maid his exhortation, quhilk mycht have been collectit of the
Scripturs for the may part: James cytit Amoz the Prophet to confute the
heresy, quhilk is nocht else, bot ane testimony of the haly Spirit, quha
tharefore is put first as president in the decrete of the council, quhilk was
send fra Jerusalem to Antiochia to conferme the brethren. F^r give they had
wantit the haly Spirit, and the word of God, it had nocht been possible, to
the Apostles to have knawin quhidder they sulde have consentit with Paul and
Barnabas: or with thaim, quha teachit circumcisione to be necessare to the
Gentiles that beleuit. And far mair is it impossible to any general council
that hes been haldin sensyne, to know quhat part they sulde consent to, or fra
quhat part they sall dissent, in co^trouerseis of Religione, without the word
of God, and the haly Spirit. Quharefore sen in this Conuentione of the
Apostles, this heresy was nocht suppressed be thaim that was men of the
council, bot be the haly Spirit and word of God: all hereseis hes nocht been
suppressed be General councels, that is to say, be the chief pastors of the
universal Congregatione. For as na man walde have geuin credence that the
Apostles hade suppressed this heresy, and they had decernit any thing concerning
it, be their awin fantasy and manly Judgment, before the Judgment of the
word of God had been hard, siclyke na mair can we believe, that other General
or particulare councels that hes been sensyne, hes suppressed any heresy, quhilk
hes not hard first the Judgment of the word and Spirit of God, for all men is
lears. Psalm. 115.

And quhowbeit na man can deny (as I believe) bot the haly Spirit is principal
suppressar of al hereseis, it sum man perauenture will think that I have said
over far of the word of God, that it suppressis hereseis with the haly
Spirit: considering the word of God is bot as ane dead Instrument, be the
Judgment of man. Be the quhilk the chief Pastors, the lyuelie membris of the
Kirk suppressis the hereseis. Tharefore money will Judge, that (as I buire
hatred to the councels, and chief pastors of the Kirk) I wranguslie attribute
to the Instrumentis, that thing quhilk appertenis to the lyuelie workare: as be
exemple, commondlie it is spokin of the craftis me^ and their instrumentis,
that the craiftis men is the principal workaris, and their instrumentis, is
the secund causis of their workis, and is bot ane help to thaim, quhareby they
work.

Quharefore it appearis that we sulde say siclyke of the chief Pastors, and
the word of God. That the chief Pastors of the Congregation is the principal
suppressours of the hereseis, and the word of God is the instrument, quhareby
they suppress the hereseis: and swa they will say, that the suppressing of the
hereseis, is to be attribute to the chief Pastors representing the general
councels, as the principal workars, and governors of the council, and not to
the word of God. I answer.

The word of God is nocht to be estemit, as ane dead thing without
operatione, or strenth of it self, as the word of man is, quhilk peresis quhow
sone it is spokin, bot it is to be estemit, as Paul estemis it, Hebreo. 4.
lyuelie, and mychtye in operatione, and scharpar than ane two egged sword,
quhilk the Lord God spekis to the warlde be men, as be his mouth.

Quharefore Pater sayis not in the 15. Cap. of the Acts, that amangs us God
chesit me out, that the Gentiles be me soulde hear the word of the Euangell,
and believe: bot he sayis, be my mouth: as he walde say, the Euangel that I
preach to the Gentiles, is nocht my wordis, bot Gods. Siclyke in the first
Cha. of the Acts, Peter sayis, the Scripture man be fulfyllit, quhilk the haly
Gaist be the mouth of David spak before of Judas. Alswa Christ Jesus, callis
Paul his chosin weschel, Actor. 9. Quhairfore, sen the Apostles confessis
thaim self, and the Prophetis to be bot as instrumentis, the mouth of the haly
Spirit, and ane weschell to bear the Name of Christ, the chief Pastors of
the Congregatione, sen syne in na Council can be comparit properly to the
crafts men, and the word to the instrumentis, bot be the contrare: for the
word of God, is the lively thing, and mychty in operatione, the Saul of all
good Councels, and the Pastors, quhow chief that ever they be, is bot as dead
Creatures (without the word of God, the life of the Saul) as all men ar that
wa^tis it, quhowbeit they live corporally. Quhairfore, Paul speaking of the
preaching of the Euangell, he sayis, we have this treasure in earthen weschels,
that the excellency of that power mycht be of God, and nocht of us. 2. Corinthians. 4. Quhairby we may see, that all men is bot fragile, and unworthy
weschels, to contene sa great treasures, as is the word of God, war nocht it
war Gods pleasure, thairby to schaw his almichty power to the world. And gif
Paul estemit him self, as ane earthen weschell, that contenit bot the word of
God, and nocht as ane Creature, quha be him self, had power to speak the word
of God.

Quhat kind of weschels mycht they have haldin thaim self than, quha hes
estemit thaim felf the chief Pastors of the Congregatione, sen Paul's dayis?
Had they weill weyit their wordis of Paul, I dout not, bot they wald have
grantit thaim selves, nocht suppressors of hereseis bot unworthy instrumentis
to do sic thing, in any Council that ever hes been: latting be to speak, that
they wald be sa bauld, as to prefer thaim self to the word of God, in
suppressing of hereseis, taking to thaim self the excellent power of Gods
word, quhilk Paul attributis only to God. Quhairfore, I infer of this
comparisone of Paul's, quhair that he comparis him self to ane earthen
weschell, that as the Leame Pote, that contenis the Medicine, dois na thing to
the healing of the patient, na mair dois the general Councels, that is to say,
the chief Pastors of the Kirk (that contenis, or sold contene the word of
God, quhowheit money of thaim hes contenit verray little, or na thing of it) to
the suppressing of hereseis: for as the Leame Pot, quhilk can do na thing of it
self, seruis the Medicinars of their Medicine, pouring it out, or receiving it
in, quhen ever they please to use it: Siclyke the faithful Ministers, quha can
do na mair in godly matters be their awin nature, nor the Leame Pot can, they
serve the haly Spirit quhen it pleasis him to speak his word be thaim (as his
mouth) in all Councels, for the suppressing of hereseis. And thairfore the
suppressing of hereseis, can nocht be attribute to the Kirk, that is to say,
the chief Pastors, bot to the haly Spirit, and the word of God. Secondly, the
natural man perceauis nocht the thingis of the Spirit of God; for they ar
foulishnes unto him. As sayis Paul. 1. Corinthians. 2.14. Bot M. Q. Kirk, that is
to say, the chief Pastors of the universal Congregatione, quhilk is
representit be the general Councels, hes nocht been only natural men: bot
alswa sa fleshly, that for the may part, nocht only misknew they the thingis
contenit in the Scriptures: bot alswa their life hes been sa detestable, that
it was nocht lesum to any Christian man to eat with thaim. And their Pastors
(quhome he wald have to be ane general Council) hes been swa, for the may
part (as testifeis sindrie Famous Historiographeurs) sen the time of Siluester,
Bischope of Rome, before quhom, after the Apostles dayis, their was haldin few
godly Councels. Bot sic men hes nocht been, nor it can nocht be participant of
the haly Spirit, without quhom, na heresy can be suppressed. For their is na
society betuix God, an^ the Devil. Quhairfore (suppose they appearit ane
general council to thaim, quha knew nocht quhat ane general Council was)
they being bot natural, and fleshly men, they could suppress na hereseis, nor
it decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture, fra the wrang, quhilk
cumis alswa of the haly Spirit.

Thridly, the same thing that principally gainstandis the Heretykes, in matters
of Religione, suppressis their hereseis: bot principally the Spirit, and word
of God, gainstandis the heretykes: for Augustine sayis, with the plain
testimoneis of the haly Scripture, that thing is to be prouin, that we wald
have beleuit: and aganis the enimeis of the kirk, they ar to be vsit, Contra
Epistol. Pe^sli. Donatist. de vnitate Eccle. Ca. 19. In the quhilk sayingis, he
makis na mentione of the chief Pastors of the kirk, or Council, to be vsit
aganis the Heretykes, enimeis to the kirk of Christ, bot only of the plain
testimoneis of the Scripture, the sword of the Spirit of God. Ephe. 6.
Quhairfore the Spirit of God, and his word only suppressis the hereseis, and
nocht the kirk, representit be the general Councels. Siclyke, Augustine
teaching us, to have the surest manner of interpretatione, of the Scriptures, he
sendis us nocht to the Doctors, nor to the Councels, nor to the Decretis of
the Papis, bot to the Scriptures.

For the best manner of interpretatione of Scripturs (sayis he) is to expone ane
place be ane other of the same, that is mair manifest. Lib: 3. de Doctrina
Christiana. Cap. 26. Quhilk is not else, bot that ane part of the Scripturs
decernis the rycht understanding of ane other Scripture fra the wrang. And sen
the discretion of the rycht understanding of the Scripture and the wrang, is na
other thing, bot the discretione of the rycht interpretatione of the Scripturs
and the wrang: the rycht understanding of the Scripturs fra the wrang, may be
hade be other meanis, than be the general councels: Tharefore the rycht
understanding of the Scripturs fra the wrang, hes nocht been ay decernit be
general councels. And als give the hereseis hes been suppressed only, be the
general councels, Augustine hes nocht had ane rycht Judgment, to schaw quhow
the hereseis sulde be suppressed, and the Scripturs rycht exponit and understand:
bot in his sayings foresaid, he hes been contrarius to God, insafar he sendis
us to the Scriputrs, quhare Christ hes send us, (as M. Q. alledgis) to the
general councels, for to seik the suppressing of hereseis, and rycht
understanding of the Scripturs: quhilk I believe M. Q. will nocht grant, bot
Augustine had ane rycht understanding, both of the suppressing of hereseis,
and of the exponing and interpreting of the Scripturs.

Feardlie betuix the Apostles dayis, and the first council general, callit
Niceane, that was haldin in the eir of our Lord 328. their rang money hereseis,
as testefeis syndrie Hystoriographeurs. Than give M. Q. will sustene that all
hereseis, hes been, be ane general council, or other only suppressed, taking
trial, and instructione be the Scripturs. Than say I, that the haly Spirit be
all the godly Doctors, and wrytars, both before the first general council,
and after, traualit inuaine. And alswa they Doctors tynt their time: To quhom,
is attribute, (because they be argumentatione, and other wayis in their
preaching, or writing schew to the world the Judgment, of the Spirit and word
of God, betuix his treuth and they hereseis,) the thing that appertenit only
to the Spirit and word of God, (nocht after the verity, bot after the commond
manner of speech) as to Dionisius Origenis disciple, the Confutatione of
Sabellius, and Nepos, Chiliastes, to Archelaus, Bischope of Mesopotamia, the
Confutatione of all the arguments of Manicheus, the chief heretyke, and to
Origene, the confutatione of diverse heretykes, before that their was any
general council, other nor the council of the Apostles maid mentione of in
the 15. Cap. of the Acts. And after the council of N^cene, was attribute to
Epiphanius, the confutatione of 80. hereseis. To Augustine and Hierome, the
confutatione of syndrie hereseis: as testifeis Trithemius, Pantaleo in his
Cronicles, and Hierome in the Catologe of the Ecclesiastical wryttars. Quha
tuke nocht trial and instructione only be the Scripturs to confute, convict,
or suppress they hereseis, bot rather be the Scripturs, and the ordinary
meanis (quhareby the Spirit of God geuis the understanding of the Scripture)
they oppinnit the Scripturs, that be the oppinning of thaim, the world mycht
als manifestly and surely see, quhow that the Spirit and word of God
suppressed they hereseis, as any man vnderstandis the nature of the thing that is
oppinnit to him be the essential and may proper definitione of the same. Or
as he seis his awin face in ane Myrrour, give their be any spot on it, or
nocht: Swa that na man for the co^trouerseis of they dayis, that be the
Scripturs was rychtuouslie and sufficie^tlie decydit, mystart the Judgment or
sentence, of other general or provincial councels, mair nor the man that hes
ane fair Myrrour before him, mystaris to bide quhill ane cum fra Rome, or
Jerusalem to tell him, give he be fair or nocht: And alswa they doctors be the
ordinary meanis, and Scripturs soluit the heretykis reasons, that appearit to
make for they hereseis, schawing to the world that they war of na effect. Swa
na man of good reasone can say, that the haly Spirit, and all the weill learnit,
and godly men traualit muame, both in their writing, Preaching, and reasoning
aganes the hereseis of their dayis: bot su^ of thaim did als mekle in using of
the ordinary meanis, (quhareby the world mycht perceive, and understand they
hereseis be the Spirit and word of God suppressed) as any council of thaim all
did, for fardare the councels could do nocht.

Quharefore I conclude, that na hereseis hes been suppressed be general Councels
(as M. Q. allegis) bot be the Spirit and word of God, for give he will
attribute confutatione, suppressing, conuicting of the hereseis to the
councels, he sall find the same things attribute to the Doctors, be diverse
godly wryttars in their bukis, and swa give he attributis sic things to the
councels, lat him attribute the same things to the Doctors, for the
suppressing, conuicting, and confuting is attribute to the councels, bot for
the same self cause, that they ar attribute to the doctors, quhilk is nocht
else, bot for using of the ordinary meanis, to oppin the Scripturs, and for
schawing of the judgment and will of God, contenit tharin to the world, as the
spirit of God geuis thaim understanding, and utterance.

Fyftlie give M. Q. will say, that all hereseis is suppressed only be General
Councels, it is na better to the People, quhen any Hereseis ringes, to be under
ane weill learnit Pastoure, than under ane Ignorant: because ane good and weill
learnit Pastor, can do na mair to quiet the conscience of his people (as to the
hereseis) nor ane ignorant: gif it be true, that hereseis only be general
Councels is suppressed (as M. Q. alleges) for they man both abide the cu^ming
of ane general Council (as all the simple, and thrawart papists dois) quhilk
gif it cummis nocht in their life time, another of thaim can lu^k for quietness
in their conscience, bot with troublit conscience man depart, quhare God
pleasis, quhilk war ane great absurdity.

Sextly, the councels hes often times co^sentit with the heretykes, as the
Council callit Ariminense, haldin in the eir of God, 362 fauorit the Arrians:
quha held ane Council in Antiochia, of Syria, and confirmit their awin error,
sa far as Council could conferme it, in the eir of God. 346. Hystoria Tripar.
2. Ca. 10. The Second Council of Ephesus, fauourit the error of Entites. The
council haldin be Cypriane, and the Bischoppes of Afric, co^cludit the
heretykes to be rebaptsit, in the eir of our Lord 260. And Steuin the Bischope
of Rome, not only decernit he thaim, that they sold not be Rebaptisit, bot
they, quha baptisit thaim, or decernit thaim to be Rebaptisit, he thocht worthy
to be cursed. Augustinus de vnico Baptismo, Contra Petili. Cap. 14. And in the
Council of Nicene, their was seuintent that fauourit Arrius: of the quhilk
aleuin subscriuit efterwart with their handis, and nocht with their heart, to
the Council. And Ser was ban^ist with Arrius, that wald nocht consent to the
Council. Quhairfore, their being sa money erroures ma^tenit be ^ouncel^, and sa
great controversy amangis thaim, that was of the Councels: I may surely
conclude, that all Hereseis hes nocht been suppressed be general Councels: nor
it the rycht understanding of the Scriptures, fra the wrang, hes been decernit
be thaim, bot rather the contrare be money of thaim. And gif M. Q. will say,
that they war provincial Councels, that fell in error, and nocht general. I
answer, that ane general Council may fall in error, or heresy, als weill as
ane provincial Council: for God hes nocht promisit mair to ane general, nor
to ane provincial Council, that it sall nocht fall in error. For it is bot
ane dream deuoitly dreamit, that ever their was ane universal Council, sen
the Apostles dayis, representing the kirk of God. For siclyke Council hes
another exemple, nor command in the word of God, nor it hes it the ^^mes of
God, mair of his assistance, nor ane particulare Council, godly conuenit: for
the Council of the Apostles, sal nocht be easily prouin, to be ane universal
Council. Siclyke, gif the general Councels, had suppressed all hereseis
sufficiently (as M. Q. alleges was done be thaim) than (say I) that they
matters had nocht risen again, that had been aneis suppressed: bot they thingis
quhilk they supp^est for heresy (as was the forbidding of meatis on certane
dayis, and at certane times, forbidding of both the kyndis geuin in the Supper
of the Lord, to the commune people, forbidding of the Ministers Marriages of
the Kirk, and siclyke, other thingis) is now risen again, and godly authorizit
be the Scripture, in the Kirk of God. And be the contrare, they thingis, quhilk
they establishit for the treuth and verity (as was Purgatory,
transubstantiatione, the Sacrifice of the Mass, worschipping of Imagerie, and
siclyke, other thingis) without general, or prouincial council of me^: be the
word of God, they ar sa far suppressed, that they ar never able to rise again.
Quhairfore as we see, that na thing standis sure, concerning Religione, bot it
that is groundit upon Gods word. Siclyke, their is na thing, that suppressis
they thingis, quhilk is aganis the true Religione, bot the Spirit and word of
God.

Quharefore, leaving this part sufficiently prouin, be the reasonis foresaid,
that all hereseis hes nocht been suppressed be general Councels: nor it, that
the rycht understanding of the Scriptures, fra the wrang, hes been decernit be
thaim: I say, be na strenth of argumentatione, inferris he weill his
conclusione, that the general Councels was the special membre of the
Congregatione, appointit be God, representing the hal^ Kirk, to tak ordoure in
matters of debait concerning Faith.

Heir followis M. Q. Second Reasone, quhairby he labors to confirm his
First Conclusione, without Scripture.
GIF their be sum (as I think their be money) quhilkes ar stif neckit, bearing
perpetual disdain aganis the general Councels, specially, sic as wald have
liberty to thraw the Scripture to their appetite, desirous of vain glory,
and to be thocht singular in their awin opinione. I will ask thaim of ane
questione, quhilk is verray easy till answer to, that is, gif ever their was
any Hereseis sen the time of Christ, or nocht? I am sure their is na man sa
schameles, and he war never sa drownit in Heresy, bot he will grant their hes
been money great hereseis. For quhy? their is nocht ane article of our faith,
bot it hes been impugnit, and brocht in dout again be Heretykis, affermand
their hereseis, for the may part all be Scripturs, falsely alledgit, and
interpret. Than will I speir, give their was ane ordour taken to suppress the
hereseis, or nocht? I am sure their is na man will thynk that God neglectit the
Congregatione, that it sulde live in perpetual debait, for the faith, and na
ordour to be taken thairupon.

Than will I inquire, quhat was the ordour (give it was nocht be the general
councels) quhilk was taken? treuly I believe, their will na man schaw ane other
mean, quhareby heresy was suppressed, bot be the general councels, specialie
quhilk rays of the wrang understanding of the Scripture of God, as all hereseis
commonly dois.

Than sen we are assurit that their hes been money abominable hereseis in
contrare our faith, and the ordour, quhilk was taken for the samyn, was euir
only be the General councels dewly conuenit, it may be justly inferrit,
that the general councels was the membre of the congregatione, sterit up be
God, representing the universal kirk of God, having denomination, strenth, and
effect of all the membris of the Congregatione.

I believe their is na man of reasonable Judgment, bot he will thynk that their
two argume^tis above rehearsit sufficiently perswadis, ea, and conuictis the
general councels to be the member of the Congregatione, representing the
universal kirk of God.

M. Ihone Dauidsonis Answer.
I Grant that their hes been money hereseis sen the time of Christ, and that we
have exemple in the Scripturs, quhareby we may understand, that be the word,
and Spirit of God, they war suppressed. Acto. 15. Bot quhare he sayis, treuly I
believe, their will na man schaw ane other mean, quhareby heresy was suppressed,
bot be the general councels, quhilk rays of the wrang understanding of the
Scripture of God, I am not trewly of this believe: bot affermis that na hereseis
sen the Apostles dayis, nor in their dayis, nor before their dayis, hes been
sup^r^st be general councels, quhidder they hereseis hes rysin of the wrang
understanding of the Scripturs, or nocht. Bot all hereseis hes been suppressed be
the haly Spirit, and word of God. For another council nor Kirk, quhow
universal or particulare that euir it was, can say (as he interpretis the kirk
or council) that the greatast heresy that euir was, was heresy: nor it can
it say, that the rytht understanding of any hard and difficile place of the
Scripture, setfurth be the greatast Doctor that euir was, is the rycht
understanding thareof: nor the wrang understanding of the same Scripture,
setfurth be the greatast heretyke that euir was, is the wrang understanding
thareof, without the haly Spirit, and the word of God. For it is only they,
that may assure us in our conscience, of the true understanding of the
Scripturs. For give we mycht say, of two interpretations of ane hard place of
Scripture, that the ane war heresy, and the other nocht: or of any difficile
place, that this war the rycht understanding thareof, and this nocht, at our
pleasour: than we mycht leid men to any faith we pleasit, as we war Lords over
their faith, quhilk war ane arrogant thing.

Tharefore, quhen the Kirk of God, or any private membre thareof, hes ane
doutsum questione, or controversy in any matter of religione, as is all
hereseis, it aperteanis to thaim be sic ordinary meanis, and gracis, as the
haly Spirit hes i^dewit thaim with, to see, quhilk of the partis of their
doutsum questione, aggreis with the Scripture of God, and quhilk nocht, as the
Apostles did. Acto. 15. And that the understanding, quhilk is found of the
difficile scripture, that is socht for any controversy, consent, and aggre
with all other places of the Scripture, preceding and following, and disaggre
with nanc: quhilk is to be socht, as Augustine teachis us saying, be the things
following of the same text, and that quhilk is adioynit thareto, the dout, or
the repugnance, is to be taken away. Libro. 3. de Doctrina Christiana Cap. 2. et
contra Faustum Manicheum, Libro. 9. Cap. 67. He sayis nocht that the dout is to
be taken away be the general council, or be the Doctors, bot be the thingis
following of the same text, and that, quhilk is adioynit thareto. Quhilk being
taken away (nocht be the Kirk, or any membre thairof, bot be the word of God)
it apertenis to the Kirk, and every membre thareof, to consent with that part
of any doutsum questione, in matters of Religione, that the Scripture of God
aggreis with: and disassent fra that part, that the Scripture disaggreis with,
as the Apostles did, in the council of Jerusalem. And after that the heresy be
suppressed, be the Spirit, and word of God: it pertenis to the hale kirk, to
adioyne that authority, quhilk God hes geuin to it, to the part aggreing with
the Scriptures. As for exemple, and this dout, or questione war mouit in the
kirk of God. Is it lesum to any man, to make to him self any grauin Image, to
bow down thareto, in the Temples? Than quhat can the kirk, or Council say
thareto? na thing: quhill they luik quhat the Scripture of God, the testimoneis
of the haly Spirit, hes Iudgit and determinat. And because the kirk, or
Council, in the Scripture findis, that Images is forbiddin, and condamnit be
God, all the godly members of the kirk, and Council consentis to the haly
spirit, and Scriptures spokin be the members of the kirk (as his mouth) and be
the authority that God hes geuin to the kirk, it commandis, that they that
makis Images to thaim self, to bow down to thaim, and worschip thaim, be
haldin as Ethnikis, and Publicanis: or after ane admonitione, or two, that all
men flee fra thaim, and as Idolaters, that na man tak meat with thaim. Siclyke,
their is ane great controversy, betuix the Protestants, and the Papists,
upon the understanding of their wordis, that Christ Jesus said in his Supper.
This is my body, ilk ane thinking thaim self to have the rycht understanding
heirof. Than quhat sall the kirk of God do in this matter? Sall it stand only
to the determinatione of the Councels, without farther trial taking in the
matter? Or to the determinatione of the best learnit men? another. Bot the kirk,
and the best learnit men, that ever was, sold luik first be the ordidarie
meanis, and Scriptures, quhilk is the understanding heirof. And because the
Sacramental speachis of the Scriptures, seruis best to oppin this place of the
Scripture, for the quhilk the controversy is. Tharefore the Protestants,
seeing the Scripture of God, in the Sacramental speachis, to gif the Name of
the thing, that is signifeit be the Sacramental sign, to the sign: as in
the.12. Chap. of Exodus Quhare it is writtin: This is the Pasouer of the Lord:
and quhare sall we prepare to thee, the Pasouer? Math. 26. This is my Covenant,
Gene. 17. Quhilk is als mekle to say, as this is the sign of the Pasouer. This
is the sign of my Covenant. Swa the Protestants seeing, that this is the
understanding of this Sacramental speachis, to the quhilk, this Sacramental
speech (this is my body) is alyke. The Protestants is assurit be the word of
God, to have the rycht understanding of this place, this is my body. For as the
kirk of God, and the members thareof, consentit in all aiges, this to be the
understanding of this Sacramental speech, this is the Pasouer of the Lord,
this is the sign of the Pasouer. Siclyke it sold consent, that of this
Sacramental speech (this is my body) this is the richt understanding thareof,
this is the sign of my body. Not that I mean, their to be only ane baire
sign, bot ane Sacramental sign, with the quhilk. God exhebitis to the
receauer worthily, that thing quhilk is signifeit be the same sign. And not
only sold the Kirk consent thareto, bot alswa, be the authority it hes of
God, it sold command it awin members, to hald all thaim, quha beleuit the
bread and the wine, to be transubsta^ciat, in the body and blude of Christ: or
Christ Jesus body to be inclosit within the forms of bread and wine, as
Ethnikis, and publicanis (as all Papists sold be haldin amangis true
Christianis) and to flee fra their company, as Heretykes, and Idolaters, quha
be the determinatione of their Councels, without Scripture of God, hes
commandit, as Lords over Christian mennis Faith, that all men believe the
bread and wine to be transubstantiat in the body and blude of Christ Jesus, als
lang and braid, as he was borne of the Virgin Marie, and crucifeit on the
Croce, under the forms of bread and wine, quhilk altogether is wickit. For
their is na Council, that can move any man to believe any thing concerning
Religione, be any authority, that ever they may allege thaim self to have,
without Gods word. For Augustine sayis, that it is necessare to be prouin, be
the manifest testimoneis of the haly Scripturs, that we wald war beleuit.
Contra Epist. Petili. Donatist. de vnitate Eccle. Cap. 19. Siclyke he sayis, he
wald nocht have beleuit the Eua^gell, without the authority of the Kirk had
commouit him. Contra Epist. Manichei, quam vocant fundamenti. Mark weill his
word, commouit, and nocht mouit: for be this word commouit, he meanis, that
the authority of the Kirk, or decretis thareof, is nocht sufficient be their
self, to move any man to believe the Euangell, bot with the Spirit and word of
God, to commoue the minds of Gods chosin people to believe. Quharefore, sen
another the scripture of God, nor the Doctoures sayingis, nor it na good
reasone, teaches us to seik the suppressing of Hereseis, or the rycht
understanding of the Scriptures, fra the wrang, bot at the haly Spirit, and
the word of God: I believe M. Q. nor na godly man will attribute to the
general Councels, that thing quhilk appertenis only to the haly Spirit, and
the word of God: as is the suppressing of Hereseis, and the discretione of the
rycht understanding of the Scriptures, fra the wrang, vtherwayis the world wald
live in perpetual debait, and contentione, without the hereseis war suppressed,
be infallible and eternal things (as is the haly spirit, and the word of God)
and nocht be general, or particulare councels, that may both dissaue the
world, and be dissauit.

And give any man wald object, that the Kirk of God hes receauit sum Scripturs,
as Canonical, and hes refusit vthers, as Apocripha: Quharefore it appearis to
be sure, that the kirk hes power only to decerne, and Judge the Scripturs: and
having power to Judge the Scripturs, far mair sulde it have power (as
appearis) to Judge, quhilk is the rycht understanding, and quhilk is the wrang
of the Scripturs, and swa perauenture to sum men, al will appear to be wrang,
that we have said. I answer, that the Kirk receauit the Scripturs, na other
wayis, than they war offerit, and delyuerit be thaim, that wrat thaim to the
Kirk: quha was knawin surely be the rest of the Kirk, to be full of the haly
Spirit: bot they war nocht offerit, nor delyuerit to the Kirk to be Iudgit, or
to be receauit be the Kirkis Judgment. Bot of they Scripturs that was
delyuerit, as Canonical be the Apostles, and the Euangelistis: the Kirk fra
time to time, hes borne faithful wytnes thareof to the Posterity, that they
war Canonical, of the quhlk the Kirk could never take on it to Judge. For the
Apostles and Euangelistis of their awin will chesit not, to bring in the Kirk
any thing, bot that, quhilk they receauit fra Christ, faithfully they schew it
to the Nations, as sayis Tertuliane. For as the Scripturs of the auld
Testament, was not Iudgit be the preistis, nor Ministers, nor be the Synagog to
be Canonical, or Apocrypha: bot was kepit (as sayis Augustine) in the Temple
of the Hebrew people, be the deligence of the succeding preistis Deuteronomy. 31.
Iosue vltimo. Hebr. 9. Swa the Kirk, another receauit, nor refusit, nor it
Iudgit it any Scripture, be it awin authority, bot they buikis, quhilk it
receauit fra the Apostles, and Euangelistis: sen the Apostles, and Euangelistis
dayis, without interruptione of time, hes brocht thaim on to this time. Contra
Faustum Manicheum, Lib. 28. Cap. 2. e. And in the same buke he sayis. Cap. 4.
quhen the Apostle Paul, after the Ascensione of the Lord, was callit of the
Heauin: give he had nocht found the Apostles living, with quhom he mycht have
appearit, to have been of the same fallowschipe be communicatione, and
conferrning of the Eua^gell with thaim, (Galat. 2.) the Kirk on na wayis had
beleuit him. Be this sayngs of Augustine, it may be clearlie seen, that the
Kirk of God, another admittit, nor refusit the Scripturs, he it awin authority.
Bot because the kirk of the Apostles dayis, had co^municatione and conferring
of the Scripturs with the Apostles, and Euangelistis: and they Scripturs that
the primitive kirk receauit of their handis, the kirk succeding, as ane
faithful wytnes, hes brocht they scripturs to be beleuit on to our dayis. And
tharefore another kirk, nor councels had power to Judge the Scripturs, nor to
decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripturs fra the wrang, be their
Judgment and pleasour. For Augustine sayis Lib. 13. confession. Cap. 23. it is
nocht lesum of sa hie authority to Judge, nor it of thy buike: ea, suppose
their be sum thing their nocht manifest, because we submitt to it our
understanding, and we halde it sure, ea, and it that is hid to our sycht,
rychteouslie and trewly to be said. Ane man quhowbeit he be now spiritual, and
renewit in the knawlege of God, according to his Image, quha hes creatit him,
nochtheles, he sulde be ane doar of the law, and nocht ane Judge. Tharefore the
Apostles being in the primitive kirk, quha be the inspiratione of the haly
Spirit, wrat the Scripturs: and delyuerit thaim to the kirk (manifestly
contening all thingis, that conce^nit faith, and good manners) the kirk hes
borne witness of they Scripturs to the world, that they war Canonical. Bot
after that this was done, it was nocht lesum to the kirk succeding, to
interpret they Scripturs at their pleasoure: bot the Spirit of Christ, first
was to be hard: and the mutual consent of all the places of the Scripture, was
diligently to be co^sidderit, of the quhilk, we have this familiare exemple.
As quhen the kingis letters cummis to any City, the Rewlars and governors of
the City, of ane custom may take trial, give they letters be seuzeit or
nocht, that is present it to thaim in the kyngis name. Bot quhen they
understand, they letters not to be seuzeit, nor corruptit, it is nocht lesum,
at their pleasour, to alter, or change thaim, nor to make expositione, or gloss
on thaim, bot obey the kyngis command, as it is setfurth tharein. And na other
wayis can we judge of the Kirk: for quhowbeit it is ane faithful keipar of the
Scripturs, it it is nocht lesum to it, to constitute any other thing of thaim,
vtherwayis than God hes determinat.

Quharefore, sen the councels (as he interpretis thaim, the chief Pastors of
the Universal Congregatione) is men for commounlie blind, affectionat, and
dull of spirit, and takis on thaim to decerne, and determine they thingis that
is proponit in their councels, quhilk appertenis only to the Halye Spirit, and
word of God: I say na man is oblest to subscriue, or consent to the sentence of
they Councels, mair nor to the sentence of ane private man, be reasone of the
Councels. Bot because, they aggre with the word of God (quharein is contenit
the mind and will of the haly Spirit) approving it to be true, be the quhilk
it takis the strenth, efficacy, and denominatione. For gif Peter (quha
appearit to be ane Pillare of the kirk (Gal. 2) and was sa great Apostle) had
errit, and Paul had nocht resistit unto him, quhat sall we say than of the
Congregatione of men, that is led up and down with affectionis, blyndnes, and
error, as hes been money of the Councels, sen the Apostles dayis, in the
quhilk, their hes nocht been sa mekle, as ane schaddow of the haly Spirit.
Tharefore, lat all thingis concerning Religione, be brocht to the Scripturs of
God, the testimoneis of the haly Spirit, the twiche stain, and equale Judge,
that be they things that is certane, and stable, ordoure mat be taken in doutsum
matters. And not to lat doutsu^ matters be Iudgit be vncertane, and mutable
things. For as the spirit, and word of God is solid, and immortal, and full
of verity, swa is their decretis, and sentences eternal, and immortal: and
as men (quhow great nombre that ever they be) is mortal, mutable, and be nature
geuin to lie: Swa their decretis, and sentences, is vncertane, changeable, and
never wanting suspitione of falset.

Bot it I wald not, that any man thocht me of that mind, that I wald have all
things drawin to the trial of the Scripturs: as that I wald have godly, and
weill learnit men, not hard in godly councels, quha hes the ordinary meanis,
quhars by the spirit of God geuis the understanding of his Scripturs: or that I
labor to euacuat the authority of the Kirk, or Councels, and to have the
godly Fathers, and members thareof neglectit. Bot I wald have the Kirk, the
Councels, and Fathers thareof, quhow godly that ever they war, acknawledgeing
the things, that properly appertenit to the haly Spirit, and the word of God
(as is suppressing of Hereseis) nocht to apperteane to thaim: And that they war
bot as instrumentis, mouit and vsit be God, to make manifest unto the world (as
his month) the treuth and verity of all controuerseis: as they ar determinat,
and decretit be his Spirit, and lively word.

And tharefore, quhare he sayis, in the beginning of his argument. Gif their be
sum (as he thinkis their be money) quhilkes ar stifnecki^, bearing perpetual
disdain aganis the general Councels, specially, sic as walde have liberty to
thraw the Scripturs, to their appetite, desirous of vain glory, and to be
thocht singular in their awin opinione. I submit my self to the Iudg^ment of
the R^a^er q^hido^e (...) be ^ort^y to ^e callit stifneckit, and bearers o^
(...) ^^is the ^oun^^^, that wald have the judgment of Counc^ls, and all ^e^,
q^hat sumeuer they war subject, to the Iudg^ment of the Spi^^^, (...) word of
God: or they, quha will nocht subdew their understanding in the service of
Christ, bot will have his word iudgit be the vncertane, and arrogant Judgment
of men. And gif we seik ane liberty, that contenis us within the word of God,
and is content that we, and all our actionis be iudgit thareby, or they, quha
wald have the Scripturs, and their interpretationis, quhow godly that ever they
war, subject to their councels, that is, to their awin Iudgementis, and to have
na greater strenth, nor be their Councels, be their Doctors sayings, ea, and
their Papis decretis they receive. That quhen ane of their seruit thaim nocht to
their liberty, that they mycht loup to ane other, fra the Scripturs to the
Councels, fra the Councels to the Doctors, fra the Doctors to the Papis
decretis, as it war ane Fox, loupynd fra hole to hole, seiking ane stre^th. And
I wald we war iudgit, quhidder we be thrawers of the Scripturs, that desyris
Scripturs, to interpret Scripturs, or they, quha wald have thaim i^terprete be
the Councels, thrawi^g thaim to the Judgment of men. Or quhidder we be
desirous of vain glory, and singular in our awin opinione, that referris the
glory of all good Council, the decretis, the suppressing of Hereseis, and the
rycht understanding of the Scripturs, to God, and his word, or they, quha
attributis the halding of Councels to thaim self, and forth setting their
decretis to the world, as the decretis of men, to be obeyit as the decretis of
God, usurping to thaim self, the suppressing of Hereseis, and understanding of
the Scripturs, quharein they schaw thaim self, mair nor singular in their awin
opinione.

Heir followis M. Q. Thride Argument, groundit upon the Scripture, quhare with
he confermis his Conclusione principal, as he alledgis.
NOchttheles, perchance their is sum sa Religions, and clean Fingerit, that
their will na thing persuade thaim without Testimoneis of the Scripture, we
will schaw good will to satisfy their curiosity sumpart. and on this manner.
it is wryttin be the Prophet Aggee.

Great salbe the glore of this laitter housse, mair nor the first, I will ask
at the, quhat is signifeit be the laitter housse, bot Christis Congregatione,
and Kick unite together in ane faith, be Baptime? Quhat is signifeit be this
first housse, bot the chosin people of God, quhilk war before the law of the
Euangell? have we nocht expreslie in Deuteronomie, that prouisione was had in
the auld Law, quhensumeuir questione or debait rays amangs the chosin people of
God, for the understanding of the Law, recours was hade only to the Preistis
of the Trybe of Leui, and the Judge, to be pacifeit in all their doutis, and
that the people should na way is make questione, under the pain of death. Bot to
receive the Judgment of the Ministers, quhilks war for the time, Art thou nocht
than be the wordis of the Prophet, above rehearsit, compellit to say, that the
Ministers of the new Law, (quha occupyis the place of the Preistis of the Trybe
of Leui, ea, and hieare place) hes the samyn place, ea, and ane greater place,
to stay all doutis, quhilk rysis amangis the rest of the membris of the
Congregatione, for the understanding of the Scripturs, and Law of God. And
vtherwayis, quhow sall the wordis of the Prophet be of verity? saying, that
the glore of this laitter housse sulde be mair nor the first, give their be
nocht als sufficient ordour prouidit be God, to stay all doutis, quhilk rysis
amangs thaim of this laitter house, and give the Ministers of the samyn hes
nocht als great place, to take ordoure in all matters of debait concerning the
faith of thaim, quhilkes ar of the laitter housse, as had the Ministers of the
first house.

Thane we sall (conform to Gods word, and other good reasone) conclude the
general councels dewly co^uenit (quharein ar the Ministers of the new Law) to
represent the Universal Kirk of God, having full power, and authority of God
to take ordour in all matters, quhilk ar in debait (specially to decerne the
rycht understanding of Gods word fra the wrang) as hade the Ministers of the
auld Law, and rather greater.

M. Iohne Dauidsonis Answer.
AS to this third Argument, that he groundis on the Scripturs alleging Aggee.
2. and the 17. Cap. of Deuteronomie, I will lat his interpretatione of the
first and laitter housse gang with him: because it makis little to the purpose.
Bot as to the Second part, in the quhilk, because he is far wanderit by the
rycht way, I man answer: quhare he sayis, have we not expreslie in Deuteronomie
that prouisione was had in the auld Law, quhe^ euir questione, or debait raise
amangs the chosin people of God, for understanding of the Law, recours was had
only to the Preistis of the Trybe of Leui, and the judge, in the quhilk he is
far dissauit, thynking hereby, that God send Thaim to the Preistis, and Judge,
for the understanding of the Law of God, for gif he had luikit to the text, he
sall find, that it speakis of na siclyke thing, bot it sayis give any difficil
and doutsum thing to the (that is Judge of any City) in Judgment rise, betuix
blude and blude, pley and pley, plaig, and plaig, in the matters of controversy
within thy gates. etc. and thou sall cu^ on to the Preistis of the Leuitis, and
on to the Judge (president, or governor) that salbe in they dayis. etc. First
it may be here clerelie seen, quhow that this place seruis na thing to his
purpose, that he walde be at, for the thing, that the Scripture speakis of
first heir in general (as commonly it dois in money other places) it exponis
the same beirefter in special, be membris, in the Chaptours following of the
same buike, as betuix the slaucter of the Innocent, and nocent, betuix
slauchter of set purpose, and be chance, betuix byars, and sellars,
Contractars in Civil actions, and betuix plaig, and nocht plaig, and siclyke
other Civil matters, understand be this three termis. blude, pley, and plaig:
under the quhilk, na mentione is maid of the understanding of the Scripturs:
bot their is comprehendit, the hale Civil co^trouerseis of the auld Law,
quhare in the Leuiticale Judge or president, sulde have schawin to the Inferior
Governors of the Citeis of Israel, the sentence of Judgment, as the
Leuitical Preistis, keipars of the Law, had geuin him counsel, be the law of
God: At quhome their was na Judgment socht for the understanding of the law,
nor it this text makis na mentione of any power they had to judge, bot to schaw
be the Law, to the Inferior Iudgis, quhow they sulde pronunce the sentence and
Judgment of God, contenit in his law, of any difficile thing that happinnit
within the Citeis: quha in this place of Scripture, is nocht properly callit
ane Judge, bot ane president, or Civil Governor (after the significatione of
the Hebrew term) because, he was Executor of Gods Judgment (as God desyrit
Solomon, to be, nocht ane Judge, bot ane Executor of his Iudgeme^tis. 1. Reg.
6.12.) Quha is heir in this Scripture, conioynit together, with the Preistis,
to figure the Kingly Preisthead of Christ Jesus, quha both was Priest and
king. And tharefore this President, that is heir commonly callit ane Judge, he
was not ane Judge, because he Iudgit any thing be his awin warldly reasone, or
wit: bot because he was executoure of Gods Judgment, and pronouncit (as the
mouth of God) betuix God and the inferior Iudgis, the thing that was determinat
be God, and Iudgit be his Law. For quha pleasis to consider the Text, that may
plainly see, the Judgment is referrit to the Law of God, and the schawing of
the sentence of Judgment, the telling, the informing, or teaching, is referrit
to the Preistis, and the hic President, suppose it was only, bot for Civil
actions amangs the people, that he was constitute President be God: Tharefore
in this place of Scripture, it was nocht the mind of God, to teach any ordoure
for the understanding of the Scripturs, bot for the Civil controuerseis,
amangs the people, he schawis quhom at the inferior Judges sold seik the
Judgment, as he hes determinat, and defynit in his Lawis, for doutsum and
difficill matters. For in the auld Law, they Judges followit only the literal
sense of the Scripture, for the quhilk, they had na controversy, bot they
keipit the ordinance of God, as he requirit thaim be his writtin word.
Quharefore his argument of similitude, betuix the Ministers of the new Law, and
the Leuiticall Preistis, and Judges, be the wordis of the Prophet Aggee, that
he alledgis, compellis me, nor na other man to say, that the Ministers of the
new Law, hes the place of the Preistis of the Trybe of Leui, to stay all
doutis, quhilk rysis amangs the rest of the members of the Congregatione, for
the understanding of the Scripture, and Law of God. Bot dissuadis me
allutterly, for be the cumming of Christ Jesus, the Leuiticall Preisthead
endit. And tharefore, it having na mair place, the Ministers of the new Law,
occupyis nocht the same place. Bot Christ Jesus, raise up after ane other
similitude, to wit, the similitude of Melchisedec, and occupyit his place in
the hie Preisthead, and because this Preisthead of Christ, was nocht carnal,
and changeable, as the Leuiticall was, bot spiritual, and Eternal, he hes
maid us all Preistis, both men and women, to offer up, na carnal, nor
fleschly things, bot our selves, ane lively and haly Sacrifice, quhilk standis
in the refusing of our selves: before the quhilk, their is nane of our
Sacrifices (as is our Prayers, our Almons, and all other godly workis, that he
requiris of us in his Law) acceptable unto him. Quharefore, another the
Ministers of the new, nor auld Law, had sit power gra^tit to thaim be God, to
stay any doutis, or to decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture fra she
wrang, bot only the haly Spirit, and the word of God: quhilk may be easily
persauit be the Scriptures, and reasonis foresaid, quhilk war tedeous again to
repete. And this makis na derogatione, to the wordis of the Prophet, to be of
verity, suppose, another the ane, nor the other house, ascribe to thaim the
staying of doutis, in the Scripturs. For the glory of the Second house standis
nocht in the staying of doutis, bot in the excellency of the Spiritual
giftis, that was exhibit to us in the cumming of Christ. For their could na
greater glory be grantit to the Second house, than quhen the majesty of God
the Father apperit, in the presence of his Son Christ, be the quhilk, the
Second house, had all thing that was requirit to ane solid, and perfyte glory.

And granting to M. Q. for Disputationis cause, that the Ministers of the new
Law, occupyit the place of the Ministers of the auld Law, ea, or ane greater
place, as he alledgis, it sall make na thing to his purpose, bot rather contrare
to the same: for we see, that they Preistis, quha succedit linealy to Aaron,
held ane Council in the Apostles dayis, as is writtin. Actor. 4. quhilk was
mair dewely conuenit, nor was the Council of the Apostles (of the quhilk,
mentione is maid in the.15. Chap. of the Acts) gif we will hald the
conuentione of the chief Pastors, and Bischoppis, ane dewely co^uenit
council, of the universal Congregatione: for the Text bearis this words. It
come to pas on the morn, that the Princes, Elders, and Scribes, was gatherit
together at Jerusalem, and Annas the chief Priest, and Caiphas, and Ihon, and
Alexander, and als money, as wat of the Kindred of the hie Priestis. First, heir
we find the Roman Princes, quha had the governance of Jerusalem at that time,
conuenit with thaim, the Elders, and Scribes, quha had the knawledge of the
Law: for na man was admittit to be Priest, or Scribe, without knawledge of the
Scripturs. Siclyke, their is heir namit, specially the hie Preistis that
conuenit, with all their Kindred: quha was institute hie Preistis, as God had
ordanit in his Law, and approuit be the people, as our Preistis hes nocht been
this money hundredth eris bygaine. And they mycht have said, that they succedit
to Aaron, Eleazar, Abiathar, and sic vthers, above ane thousand, five hundredth
eris, gif we will count fra Aaron, to the Apostles dayis.

Now I believe na man can deny, bot this was ane general council dewly conuenit
(taking ane general council for the chief Pastors of the universal
congregatione) ^it, because they wannt the president of all good council, the
haly spirit and ink^^ nocht to the Judgment of Gods word, quhat it Iudgit in
the matter they conuenit for, they could nocht have decernit the rycht
understanding of Gods word fra the wrang, nor it could they suppress one
hereseis, bot they stable it the ground of all hereseis, quhilk was, that the
Apostles sulde nocht preach, in the name of Christ Jesus. And as we have
schawin, this general council of the Ministers of the auld Law, to have done
w^ckedlie, and schamefullie errit, we can conclude na other thing of the
Ministers of the new law, and their councels, quha in their council hearis
nocht first the Judgment of the Spirit, and word of God. Alswa because the
Iowis hes the Scripturs of God of the auld Testament, containing the effect of
the new Testament, and money styfneckit and obstinat papistis hes both the new,
and auld Testaments. And alswa sum of thaim hes the ordinary meanis, quhareby
God vsis commonly to give the understanding of his Scripture. Notwithstanding
they can nocht decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture fra the wrang:
and that only, because they want the haly Spirit. the only Spirit of al solid
and sure discretione. Quharefore the Ministers of the auld or new Law, hes
nocht be their successione, or places occupying, the discretione of the rycht
understanding of the Scripture fra the wrang, bot of the Spirit, and word of
God. And tharefore another conform to Gods word, nor good reasone sall M. Q.
conclude (as he alledgis he dois) that the General Councels (quhow dewlie that
euir they be conuenit) has be any way full power and authority of God, to
decerne the rycht understanding of Gods word fra the wrang, as the Ministers of
the auld Law had, for the Min^sters of the auld Law, had na siclyke power, that
can be schawin be Gods word.

Heir followis M. Q. Confirmatione of his conclusione, groundit (as he
alledgis) on the Fyftene Chapter of the Acts: as after followis. etc.
For fardar confirmatione of our purpose thou sall mark it that is wryttin in
the 15. of the Acres of the Apostles, as after followis.
AND Certane men quhilks come fra Iowrie, and teachit the brethern, except e be
Circumcisit after the manner of Moses, e can nocht be sauit. Nocht ane little
seditione being mouit to Paul and Barnabas, aganis thaim, than they decern^,
that Paul and Barnabas, and certane vthers of thaim sulde pass to Jerusalem
unto the Apostles, and Eldars, about this questione. Quhen they war cumin to
Jerusalem, they war receauit with the Congregatione, and Apostles, and Eldars.

Than raise certane of the Sect of the Phareseis, quhilkes did believe saying,
that it was neidfull to Circumcide thaim, and to command thaim to keip the Law
of Moses: and the Apostles and Eldars, come together to reasone upon this
matter. Quhe^ their was mekle disputatione, Peter raise up and said unto thaim e
men and brethren, e know quhow lang quhyle syne, God chesit amangs us, that the
Gentiles be my mouth, soulde hear the word of the Euangel, and believe. (And
after follows the same Text,) and quhen they held their peace, James answerit
saying, e men and brethren harkin on to me, Simon tauld ow, quhow God at the
beginning viseit the Gentiles, to receive thaim, ane people in his name: to this
aggreis the words of the Prophet, as is wryttin: after this will I return
again, and big the Tabernacle of David, quhilk is fallin down (and after that
James had cytit, and conferrit the Scriptures, it followis in the Text.)
Quharefore I Judge that we trouble nocht thaim, quha fra amangs the Gentiles,
ar turnit to God, bot that we writ to thaim, that they abstene fra fylthines of
Idols, fra Fornicatione, fra it that is wyrreit, and blude.

Beneuolent Reader, give thou diligently will mark and considder the wordis
above rehearsit. Thou sall find and perceive diverse godly and proper Lessons
aggreable for the establesing of our purpose. First thou sall mark and
considder, that albeit Paul, and Barnabas (as the Scripture teachis us) war
two Apostles appoyntit be God to be Prechours, to the Gentiles, and that they
had the Spirit of God, to preach she treuth and verity (as Paul him self
testifeis i^ money places) it wald they nocht be sa bauld, as privately to
decerne vpone the questione mouit in the Congregatione, unto the time they com
to Jerusalem, quhare Peter the chief Apostle, was with the rest of the
Apostles, and Seniors. Be this example of Scripture, we are sufficiently
instructit, na private number (quhow godly or weill learnit that ever they be)
to be sufficient, or ganand to take ordoure in matters concerning Faith, and
Religione.

And als we may perceive, quhow vain and vncertane is the Judgment of money i^
their dayis, that foulishly followis and addicris thaim self to the wickit
opinione, of sum private factious men, towart the interpretatione of the
Ancient general Councels, to quhom it appertenis (be the ordinance of Almichty
God) till interpret Scripturs. etc.

M. Iohne Dauidsonis Answer, to M. Q. First Lessone, that he hes collectit of
the Text foresaid.
OF M. Q. Lessone and exemple, quhilk he inferris of the foresaid Text, I have
learnit two Lessonis, quhilk being schawin, I sall heirefter declare God
willing, that he hes nocht markit, and gatherit sa well of this Text his
lessone, as he beleuis. And my First Lessone, is this, quhare he sayis, that
the Apostles, Paul and Barnabas, appointit be God, having the Spirit of God,
wald nocht tak on thaim to decerne privately upon the questione monit in the
Congregatione, unto the time they come to Jerusalem. I learn than, that the
Papis, quha is na Apostles, bot men wanting the Spirit of God, hes been in the
wrang, this money hundredth eris, taking on thaim to decerne matters of Faith, and
all controuerseis in Religione: quhom I believe M. Q. will hald to be na general
Council. My Second Lessone is, quhare he hes learnit be this example of
Scripture, that na private number, quhow godly and weill learnit that ever they
be, to be sufficient to tak ordour, in matters concerning Religione, and Faith.
I learn gif his Lessone be true, that all the Doctors hes labourit in vain,
quhais labors was principally, to have had the true understanding of the
Scriptures, and Heresies suppressed, quhilk was nocht else, bot to tak ordour in
matters concerning Faith, and Religione. ea, and I am assurit, that their was
never ane Council, that disputit sa quickly, be the ordinary meanis (quhareby
God geuis the understanding of his word) aganis sa money errors and Hereseis,
as ane Doctor Augustine hes done, and other private men. Quharefor, gif M. Q.
will accuse men of foulishnes, for following of private writars, after his
warldly Judgment, I believe their warldly folishnnes, salbe wisdom before God.
And quhare he callis thaim factious men, because they will not subscriue to
Scripturles Councels, as he do is. I wald he conferrit the new writars, with
the auld writars, and Councels: and I don't, not, bot he sall find als quick
declaratione of Scripturs in the new w^tars workis, as in the auld writars, or
their Councels: A^^ for the verity of this matter. I app^ill to his awin
conscience, Read, and confer thaim together, quhen he list. Now (...) he hes
nocht markit well his Lessone, I prove on this man^^^.

Paul writing to the Galathianis. 2. Cap. sayis. After fourtene eir, I went up
to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and tuik with me Titus also. And I went up be
Reuelatione, and conferrit with thaim the Euangeli, quhilk I preach amangis the
Gentiles. Hierome writing on this Text, affirms this Iournay of Paul's to
Jerusalem, to have been, quhen the disputatione, for the abolishing of the
Ceremoneis of the auld Law was had, betuix the beleuers of Antiochia and the
Iowes And swa being as Hierome affirms, quhais saying I believe M. Q. will
nocht put in dout. Than be this foresaid Text, we may cleirly see, that Paul
and Barnabas, went not up to Jerusalem, as doutsum of the thing, quhilk he had
preachit ane lang time, to the Antiochianis that beleuit, quhilk was, that it
was nocht necessare, to thaim to be circumcisit for their Saluatione. Bot
because their was sum of the Brethren in Antiochia, that doutit gif that Paulis
doctrine was true or nocht.

They hearing sum falls brethren, aduersours to Paul, quha under the culloure
and name of the Apostles, that was in Jerusalem, preachit that it was necessare
that the Gentiles that beleuit in Antiochia, sold be circumcisit, and that the
doctrine of Paul, was contrare to the doctrine of the Apostles in Jerusalem,
quhilk mycht have causit men of ane sincere Faith, to have doutit, hearing the
doctrine of the principal Doctors disaggre: he ascendit to Jerusalem. And I
conferrit (sayis Paul) the Euangel with thaim, that I preach to the Gentiles,
quhlk as Hierome notes on this word, is, quhen they things that we know, we
confer with ane friend. And, as in his bosum, we lay it, that they things that
we know, with ane uniform Council may be approuit. Tharefore, be Hieromes
sayings we may understand, that he ascendit nocht, that the rest of the
Apostles sold have teachit him: For it is ane other thing to confer, and ane
other thing to be teachit, for betuix thaim that conferris, their is equality,
and betuix the Teacher, and him that is teachit, their is inequality.

Quharefore he ascendit to rehears, that quhilk he had teachit: to the effect,
that they of Jerusalem mycht subscrine to the treuth with him. Nocht that his
preaching, quhilk was the verity of Gods word, nedit the consent or
witnessing of men, (for he schawis, it already to be confermit be God: in sa
far, as he ascendit be Reuelatione) bot that he mycht have ane testimonial of
the haly Spirit, and Apostles, that was their, to make it manifest to the
world, that it was na other thing that he teachit in Antiochta, bot that the
haly Spirit and the rest of the Apostles, had approuit be their testimonial,
be the quhilk, gif that Paul's aduersours had obiectit efterwart, circumcisione
to have been necessare to the Gentiles that beleuit, be reasone they mycht have
said again, that the Apostles had swa teachit in Jerusalem, that this
testimonial of the Kirk of Jerusalem, quhilk was in sindrie places deuulgate,
mycht have conuictit thaim of falset. And be the same testimonial, that they
quha beleuit, sold have na dout of their Saluatione, suppose they had not been
circumcisit, co^siddering in the Apostles Epistle is contenit, the decrete of
the haly Spirit, in the quhilk is decretit, that the ok of the Law, be nocht
put upon thaim that beleuit in Christ. And tharefore it was send to Antiochia,
be the hand of Judas, callit Barsabas, and Silas, to stanch the disputatione,
betuix the Iowes and the Gentiles: Quhidder gif circumcisione to the Gentiles
that beleuit, was necessare or nocht? Quharefore be the Scripture, and als be
Hieromes sayingis, for the causes foresaid, I may justly conclude aganis M. Q.
First Lessone, that Paul went nocht up to Jerusalem, to decerne upon any
questione, monit in the Congregatione. Nor it to move any questione, as douting
in him self, for he had preachit aganis the false Teathers, that come fra
Jerusalem to Antiochia. That circumcisione was nocht necessare to the Gentiles.
And tharefore the Scripture, of the.15. Chap. of the Acts, makis na thing for
his First Lessone, that he gathers thareon.

Heir follows M. Q. Second Lessone, collectit of the.15. Chap. aof the Acts,
for Confirmatione of his First Conclusione.
SECondly, it is to be markit of this Text, that after that Paul and Barnabas
was receauit be the Congregation. The Apostles and Elders only conuenit to
dispute, and decerne upon the questione mouit in the Co^gregatione, betuix the
Iowis and the Gentiles. Quhareby we are learnit, that it apertenit to the
Apostles and Elders, dewlie conuenit together to dispute, reasone, and pronunce
sentence, of matters broch in debait, concerning the true understanding of the
word of God, as the special membre of the Congregatione, appoyntit be God, to
that office. And their deliberatione in matters concerning faith, and Religione,
and interpretatione of Scripturs, to have the samyn denominatione, strenth and
effect, as the hale rest of the membris of the Congregatione had concurrit
tharewith.

M. Iohne Dauidsons answer to M. Q. secund Lessone.
THIS Text foresaid, bearis record that the Apostles, and Elders, conuenit to
dispute upon the matter: bot it sayis nocht, they only conuenit to disput.
Quharefore this argument is na worth, the text makis mentione of na vthers,
bot of the Apostles, and Elders that conuenit to dispute, tharefore al vthers
fra the disputatione was secludit. For be the same text in two diverse places,
it may be perfytelie prouin, that their was far ma at that disputatione, than
the apostels, and elders. For betuix Peter and James reasoni^g, it is wryttin
that the hale multitude held their peace. And after that James had schawin his
reasone, quhy the Gentiles that beleuit sulde nocht be circumcisit, it is
wryttin, that it pleasit the Apostles, and the Elders, with all the kirk, to
cheis men amangs thaim, and send to Antiochia. Mairattouer he can nocht deny,
bot the brethren ar expressly namit in the Superscriptione of the Apostles
letter, and understand onder this word (ws) in the wryttin decrete of the haly
Spirit. Quharefore it being verray like, that the multitude had been speaking
before, because the Spirit of God sayis, the multitude held their peace, after
Peter's reasoning, and siclyke the brethren is mentionat in the decrete, and is
lyk to have reasonit, he can not infer tharefore, the Apostles and Elders, to
have only dispute. And quhowbeit they had only dispute the matter, as it is
nocht like, that they did, for it can nocht be prouin be the text, it the rest
of his lessone, quhilk he sayis he hes learnit, is on ane boddomles ground. For
the Scripture foresaid of the 15. Cap. of the Acts, makis na mentione, that it
apertenit to the Apostles, and Elders to pronunce sentence, in matters brocht^
debait, concerning the true understanding of the word of God, nor it that
their deliberatione, in matters concerning faith, Religione, and interpretatione
of the Scripturs sold have the same denominatione, strenth, and effect, as the
hale rest of the members of the Congregatione, had concurrit thareto, as salbe
schawin heirefter, in the Confutatione of the Confirmatione of his Thride
Lessone.

Heir followis M. Q. Thride Lessone, collectit of the Text foresaid, for
Confirmatione of his Conclusione.
THridly, it is to be notit, that after Paul and Barnabas, had oppinnit and
declarit to the Apostles, and Elders, the questione and debait, that raze in
the Congregation, betuix the Iowes and the Gentiles: the Iowes being indurit,
persuading circumcisione to be necessare with Baptism, the Gentiles, be the
contrare, disdaning the ok of circumcisione, thinking Baptism only
sufficient. Raze up Peter, and after conferring of Scripturs, declarit Baptism
sufficient without circumcisione. And als James cytit the Scripturs, to bear
witnessing, and approuit the sayingis of Peter, quhilk being done. James in the
Name of the rest of the Apostles (because he was Pastor and Bishop of
Jerusalem, quhare the Apostles conuenit for the time) pronouncit sentence, and
said, I Judge. Mark good Reader, Peter and James, to call to remembrance: the
testimoneis of the Scripture, as witness bearer, of the will and mind of the
Lord. And the Apostles to occupy the place of the Judge, to the questione
mouit in the Congregatione. For quhy? The Apostle, James said nocht, the
Scripture Judges, decernis, nor geuis sentence, bot he takis the place of the
Judge (in the Name of the rest of the Apostles) vpone him self, saying, I Judge.

M. Iohne Dauidsonis Answer to M. Q. Thride Lessone.
QVhare. M. Q. heir sayis, that James in the Name of the rest of the Apostles
(because he was Bischop of Jerusalem, quhare the apostles was conuenit for the
time) pronouncit sentence. I say his sayingis hes na ground, and that I tak to
prove be diverse reasonis. First we may see in the disputatione, that Peter's
reasone is, quhy the Gentiles that beleuit sold nocht be circumcisit: for God
(sayis he) wald have thaim hearing the word of the Euangell, be my mouth, and
believe. And he hes put na difference, betuix us that is Iowes, and thaim that
is Gentiles, in giving thaim the haly Spirit, and be faith hes purifeit their
hartis. Tharefore now, quhy tempt e God, to lay ane ok on the Disciples neckis.
And their last wordis is rehearsit again, in the Decrete of the haly Spirit,
put in writ be the Council, placing this word burdene, for ok, quhilk
signifeis heir both ane thing. James heirefter, to approve Peter's reasone, he
alleges Amoz the Prophet, and up one him he groundis his reasone, quhy the
Gentiles that beleuit sold nocht be circumcisit, making his exhortatione to
the Congregatione on this manner: saying.

Quharefore I think best, that we trouble thaim nocht of the Gentiles, that are
turnit to God, bot that we write to thaim, that they abstene thaim selves fra
filthynes of Idols, and Fornicatione, and that is wirreit, and fra blude: and
of James wordis their is sum put in the decrete Siclyke.

Than I say, gif this had been the sentence that James had geuin in the Name of
the hale Apostles, as M. Q. alledgis, James faileit to Peter, that maid na
mentione of his wordis, of the quhilk, the hale Council in the writtin decrete
makis mentione. And mairattoure, the Council had faileit to James, that wald
nocht write the sentence of the Council, as it was pronouncit be him, gif he
pronouncit the sentence in the Name of the hale Apostles: for in the writtin
decrete of the hale Council, their is mekle left out, that James spak in his
exhortatione, quhilk M. Q. callis James sentence: Bot their was na sic variance
amangs thaim. Quharefore in the decrete of the Council, another Pethers nor
James sayings is followit, bot the effect of both their sayings (as members of
the council, giving their reasonis as vthers did, in the disputatione that was
their) was concludit: saying, it hes pleasit the haly gaist and us. etc. To lay
na other burdene vpone ow, as Peter sayis. Bot that e abstene our selves fra
filthynes of Idols, and Fornicatione, and that is wirreit and, from blude, as
James sayis.

Secondly, that James gave sentence in this Council, it can nocht be prouin be
this word Iudico in Latin, for the Greik term ( (...)) of the original
Text, it signifeis nocht only Iudico, bot arbitror, censeo.

Quharefore Erasmus, and Sanctes Pagninus men, weil seen both in the three
languagis, interpretis the Greik term ( (...)) be the Latin Verb censeo,
quhilk properly is nocht to Judge, or to give sentence, bot to think to be
good, or best. Mairattoure Ireneus in the 12. Chap. of his third buke readis
this place of Scripture on this manner. Propterea ego secu^dum me Iudico. Eiking
to this verb,

Quhilk wordis restrykis the significatione of this verb (...) to ane special
man, forsamekle as he spak at that time, bot for him self. For insafar he
readis, secundum me, he schawis that James was nocht sa arrogant, and Lordly
over his brethren, as that he tuke on him to pronunce sentence in the name of
the rest, or that he walde have al vthers addictit to his sayings in the
council. Bot schawing his Judgment be it self, quhat he thocht best to be
done, according to the Scripturs in the controversy, proponit before thaim: he
leauis place to all vthers that ws their present, quhat they thoct best to be
done in the matter. Nor it is nocht like, that James wald have been sa rasche,
as to have geuin sentence, quhill his reasone first had been hard, and appreuit
be the council, or that he walde have said, I Judge, bot we Judge, give he
gave the sentence in the name of the rest, for they had all, bot ane
commissione of God.

As to the cause, quharefore he alledgis James sulde have taken upon him to
pronunce sentence, in the name of the rest of the Apostles: because he was
Byschope of Jerusalem. This cause soundis verray neir, to the ambitione of the
Papistrie, quhilk I believe na godly man will think to have been amangis the
Apostles. For in lykewayis, Paul mycht have said, that he was, Apostle, and
Byschope constitute be God, to the hale Gentiles, of the hale warlde, and to
they Gentiles, quha had the government of Jerusalem, at that time, that he
sulde have pronuncit sentence, in matters perteyning to thaim, to quhome he was
Apostle. And Peter alswa mycht have said, that he sulde have pronuncit
sentence, because he was chief Apostle (as M. Q. stylis him) quhilk was mair
than to be byschope of ane town, and alswa Peter was Apostle to all the
circumcisit, nocht only in Jerusalem, bot throuthour the hale warlde: quhilk
was ane greater thing to be, than to have been Byschope of ane City of
Jerusalem, upon the quhilk Peter, and Paul was alswa constitute Apostles:
became they war constitute be God, Apostles, both of Iow and Gentile. Gal. 2.
bot James was chosin be the Apostles, Byschope of Jerusalem: as testifeis
Hierome in the Prologe of the Ecclesiastical wryttars: and that, as Egesippus
wryttis tsayis Hierome. Quharefore it hes na appearance, that he, quha was
chosin be the Apostles, walde take on him in their presence, as ane Byschope to
pronunce sent^ce, quhilk is the office of the beast powar. And beside this,
give James was not Byschope of Jerusalem, at the time of this council, bot was
chosin after the Council: the cause quharefore M. Q. alledgis him to pronu^ce
sentence, is false. Mairattoure I say (with perdone of Hierome and Egesippus his
author) it is nocht like, that any of the Apostles, quha was chosin be Christ
to be Preach^^ is to the hale warlde, that they walde addict thaim self (bot
give it war for ane schorte time, to any special Kirk) ^ot follow their Master
Christis command: quha commandit nocht Peter to be Byschope of Rome, nor Paul
Byschope of Antiochia, nor it commandit he, the Apostles to make James Byschope
of Jerusalem; to have authority amangis thaim be reasone of the place that he
occupyit: bot he gave thaim all ane common charge, saying, pas in to the hale
world, and preach the Eua^gel to every Creature. Mark 16. Quharefore it is
nocht weil inferrit that James gave sentence, because he was Byschope of
Jerusalem, suppose he had said as the vulgar translation bearis, I judge.

Thridlye, this cause quharefore M. Q. alledgis, that James sulde have
pronuncit sentence, is of na effect: for it sawris of two ungodly things,
first of Papistrie, for the principal thing, the Paip hes, for his vsurpit
authority of Judgment, and sentence giving over the hale warlde: is, because
he is byschop of ane town callit Rome, and successor unto Peter, noine ienus.
Secundlie, if sauoris of ambitione, give they regardit any of the apostles
amangs thaim self, be reasone of the place they war chosin to, and that
ambitioye was croppin in ama^gs thaim, quhilk I believe na man will say.

Ferdlie, give their wordis of James had been the sentence, geuin in the name of
the test of the council, quhart he sayis, I Judge nocht to trouble the
brether, bot wreit to thaim, to abstene thaim self. etc. this words (bot wreit
to thaim) had been imperime^t to have been put in the myddis of ane sentence.
And give he will say, that the sentence follow is their wordis (bot wreit to
thaim). Than I say, that the sentence (as he callis it) that James gave, and
the decrete that was wryttin in the Council to the Gentiles of Antiochia
aggreis nocht, as any Man may see, quhilk ware ane great Inconvenient.

Quharefore be their reasonis I conclude, that another James (because he was
Bischope of Jerusalem) pronouncit sentence, in the Name of the rest of the
Apostles: nor it inferris he weill of this place, that the Scripturs was nocht
Judge: bot that the Apostles was Judge. As salbe shawin plainly heirefter, in
the Confutatione of his Confirmatione, that James gave sentence (as he
alledgis) quhilk heirefter followis. and.

Heir followis M. Q. Confirmatione, of this Thride Lessone.
AND to the effect, that thou sall mair cleirly perceive the Apostles, till
occupy the place of ane Judge, to the interpretatione of the word of God, and
the Scripture to be as witness berare, of the will and mynede of the Lrde. Quare
by the Apostles tuik instructione. Thou sal mark the sentence put in writ, and
send away with Paul and Barnabas, and sum other of the rest of the
Congregatione, saying their wordis.

It hes pleasit the haly Baist and us, to put na other burdene vpone ow, bot
till abstene fra filthynes of Idols, and blude, it that is wirreit, and
Fornicatione, fra the quhilkes e keiping ow, e do weill: and weill fair e.

Mark good Reader, the wordis of the sentence: saying, it hes pleasit the haly
Gaist and us, as the Scripture wald say, and us, as Judges appointit be God, to
decerne the rycht understanding of Gods word fra the wrang Als it may be
notit, that thae is na testimony of the Scripture put in the sentence; be the
quhilk, it may be perceaiut, the Judgment only referrit to the Apostles, and
the Scripture na wayis to occupy the place of ane Judge, toward the
i^terpretatione of the Scripture.

M. Iohne Dauisonis Answer.
ANE Bairne may Judge on this interpretatione of M. Q. that other he speakis
effectionatly, that grounds his argument sa weakly, to prove the Apostles to be
Judges, or else be hes nocht understand his Text, that he reasonis vpone. For
quhare he sayis, mark good Readers, the wordis of the sentence: saying. It hes
pleasit the haly Gaist and us, as the scripture wald say, and us as Judges
appointit be God, to decerne the rycht understanding of the Scripture, fra the
wrang. This manner of interpretatione, the hale world may see, that it is na
worth: For in it, their is manifest wrang done to the haly Spirit, in sa far as
M. Q. sa slychely ouerseis him (quhom it hes pleasit the Apostles, the Elders,
and Brethren, to put principal, and First, as the only true Judge in the
decrete) and geuis only the dignity of Judgment, and presidencie to the
Apostles, quhilk they wald never have tanc on thaim selves. And mairattour, I
meruell quhow he hes dreamit this interpretatione, and us as Judges:
considdering their is na mentione maid of Judgment, before their wordis, nor
behind. Except that James sayis I think best, quhilk I have sufficiently
schawin before, that their wordis meanit of na Judgment giving.

Secondly, under this word (us) is contenit nocht only the Apostles, bot
alswa the Elders and Brethren, as may be easylie perceauit be the letter
writtin in the Council of the haly Spirit, be the Apostles. For the
Inscriptione of the letter contenis the Apostles, Elders, and Brethren, quhilk
he hes pretermittit in his tractiue, that he mycht interpret this term (us)
as he pleasit, quhilk he could not have done, and he had lukit to the
Superscriptione of the letter. Quhareby we may cleirly see, that it is the
Scripturs, quhilk geuis the rycht understanding of the difficill places of the
Scripture, and the discretione betuix the rycht understanding of thaim, and the
wrang, for the quhilk their is any controversy, for the superscriptione of
this letter of the Council, geuis to thaim that luikis on this matter, the
rycht interpretatione of this word (us.) And alswa discretione betuix the
rycht understanding heirof, and the wrang, without the quhilk, na warldly
Creature could interpret it, nor it could they decerne, quhidder M. Q. hes
interpret it rycht or wrang. And tharefore I have put in writ the Epistle of
the Council, that all men that hes any Judgment, may perfytely see, quhow M.
Q. hes cloikit the matter, gif he hes pretermittit the Superscriptione of the
Apostles Epistle, of set purpose: and gif he hes done it of ignorance, I have
put the same Epistle in writ, that the world may have petie of his ignorance,
and be war in times cumming, that they be not dissauit be his writings. And
alswa that the world may see, quhom this word (us) rehearsis, and to quhom it
hes respect.

The Superscriptione of the Councels Epistle.
The Apostles and the Elders, and the Brethren, to the Brethren of the
Gentiles, of Antiochia, Syria, and Celicia, Greating. etc.

The Narratione of the Councels Epistle.
FOrsamekle as we have hard that certane, quha departit fra us, hes troublit
ow with wordis, and combret our myndis, saying, e man be circumcisit and keip
the law, to quhom we gave na command: It semit to us tharefore good quhen we
com together with ane accord to send chosin men on to ow, with our belouit
Barnabas and Paul, men quha hes Ieoperdit their lives for the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, we have send tharefore Judas and Sylas, quhilk sall also tell
ow, the same thyngis be mouth.

The decrete of this Council, and conclusione of the Epistle.
For it hes pleasit the haly Gaist, and us, to put na other burdene on ow, than
this necessare thingis: that e abstene fra fylthines of Idols, and blude, it
that is wyrreit, and Fornicatione, fra the quhilks e keipyng ow, e do weill:
and weill fair e.

Heir it may be planelie seen, that this word (ws) hes not only respect to
the Apostles, bot alswa to the Elders, and Brethren co^tenit in the
superscriptione of the letter. And tharefore this word (ws) in the decrete, is
als mekle to say, as the Apostles, Elders, and brethren. Quharefore it is evil
interpret, and ws, as Judges: quhilk he referris only before, to the
Apostles. Bot it happinnit weill, that he was not all hale blind that
happinnit on the Apostles, quha is put in the first part of the
Superscriptione, and neglectit nocht the hale membris of the Council. Bot it
is nocht marvel that he ouersaw the Elders, and Brethren, that was understand
under this word (ws) and last in the Superscriptione of the councels letter:
considering he over saw the haly Spirit, for his awin auantage, quha is
president of the Council. Quhilk come (as I think) bot of ane kyndlie
kirkma^nis head, quha walde another have the haly Spirit, quha knawis all, nor
it the Elders, and Brethren, quha knawis part, understanding, that any thing
sulde be done in Councels, bot be the Apostles, to quhom, M. Q. and his chief
Pastors, haldis thaim self successors, that they may ryng over all me^nis
conscience only, as they please. Tharefore all men that consideris the ordoure
of this council, may clerelie see, that he hes ouersene him self, in the
expositione of this term (ws) for under this term (ws) is comprehendit, the
Apostles, Elders, and Brethren. Onder the quhilk namis is comprehendit the hale
Congregatione of Christ Jesus Kirk. For their is na good true Christian man,
bot he is other ane Apostle, or ane Eldere, or ane brother, and nane of this
ordours of men, sulde be secludit fra general, provincial, or synodale
councels, Swas they be qualifeit tharefore, suppose they war nocht admittit in
the papistrie.

Thridlie, quha pleasis lay the Text of this Scripture together, and his gloss,
I believe their salbe found na man, bot he sall hald him war nor blind, and he
see nocht, quhow M. Q. is marualouslie wanderit be the way in this matter: for
quhat affinity hes this text, it hes pleasit that ha^y spirit and ws, to put
na other burdene on ow bot to abstene fra filthiness of Idols, and it that is
wy^reit, and Fornicatione: and this his gloss, it hes pleasit the haly Spirit
and ws, as judges appoyntit be God to decerne the rycht understanding of Gods
word fra the wra^g. This text and gloss, is like the vulgar interrogatione,
and the deif mannis answer, that is commonly rehearsit, quhen two thingis is
alledgit to have aggreance together that hes na ne. Quhow money mile to
Montrois? R. ane poikful of plombes. Siclyke e may se, quhow vncraftelie be
makis be his secunde Notatio^e, the judgment to be referrit only to the
Apostles, and the Scripture na wayis to occupy the place of ane judge. Lat any
man considder that please, this is ane weak manner of reasoning: their is na
testimony of the Scripture, put in the sentence, ergo the judgment is only
referrit to the Apostles. For give he will have the judgment referrit to thaim,
that is put in the sentene (as he callis it) the judgment sall nocht only be
referrit to the Apostles, bot to the haly Spirit, as principal president, and
judge of the Council, and to the Elders and brethren, quha is put als weill in
the sentence, as the Apostles, and contenit under this word (ws) in the
decrete: Quharefore the Judgment is nocht to be referrit to the Apostles, ea, I
will say mair, that the Apostles hes na mair ado to be Judges in this matter,
nor they have to be Judges over the hale Scripture: for this decrete is nocht
to be esteamit, as the decrete of man, bot as the decrete of the haly Spirit,
quha with his word hes Iudgit, that the Gentiles that beleuis, is exemit fra
the Law of Moses, and nocht the Apostles: for quhowbeit the Apostles, Elders,
and Brethren, is namit in the decrete, it the decrete is nocht to be callit
their decrete, bot the haly Spirits: And quhowbeit it be callit the decrete of
the Apostles, it is bot after the Judgment of the world, and after the co^mone
manner of speaking of the Scripture, because the world Judges be the thing that
it seis, and hearis. And tharefore quhen men hearis the Apostles, Elders, and
Brethren, adioynit with the haly Spirit, in the making of this decrete, because
the haly Spirit is nocht corporal, nor visible, that they may see him, and
have communicatione with him visibly: they having their communicatione with the
Apostles, Elders, and Brethren, quha was corporal and visible men, like unto
thaim self, appointit be God to reule and teach his Kirk (as his instrumentis,
quhareby he forth settis his Lawis, decretis, and Iudgementis, to the world:
quhilk mouit Paul to call him self Gods labourare: not that he wrocht sic
things be his awin strenth, or be any vertew of his awin i^ him, mair nor the
dead instrumentis workis with warldly craftis men: bot be his grace and power.
1. Cor. 3.) they call the decretis of the haly Spirit, the decretis of his
Ministers, as Paul callis the Law of God, the law of Moses: and that after
ane familiare manner of speech, vsit in the word of God: quhilk communicatis
and attributis unto men that thing, quhilk appertenis only to God: as Paul
callis him self, Father of the Corinthianis. 1. Cor. 4. be the Euangell.
Quhowbeit God is all our only Father, both of body and Saul: it as he
communicatis the dignity of ane carnal Fatherhead to men, Siclyke, suppose
God be only our spiritual Father, it the Scripturs attributis the spiritual
fatherhead to me^, be quhom the wor^e and Sacrame^tis is distributit to us, be
the quhilk we are regeneratit. And conform to this: Hierome sayis, that their
is money thingis spokin of in the Scripture, conform to the opinione of the
time, that they thingis is done: and nocht according to that, quhilk the
verity contenit. Hierome in Ieremi. 28. et in Math. Cap. 14. as the Virgin
Marie said to her Son Jesus Christ of Joseph, behauld thy Father, and I
murning socht the. Luke 2. Alswa the wonderful Acts that was done in the
primitive Kirk, be the haly Spirit, and the Name of Christ Jesus, they ar
callit the Acts of the Apostles, quhilk was done be God, and be men, as his
instrumentis. Quharefore as they Acts that was done be God, was attribute to
men, siclyke this decrete, is callit the decrete of the Apostles, because it
was put in writ, and maid manifest to the Kirk be the Apostles, quhowbeit it
was only the haly Spirits.

Mairattoure, in sa far as the haly Spirit is put First in this decrete, he
can nocht say, that it was the Apostles decrete, or that they ar namit heirin
as Judges, without he will attribute to thaim, that appertenis only to the
haly Spirit: or else to say that the decretis of the haly Spirit, is the
decretis both of God and man, quha will have na companone with him, in making
of his decretis. And in sa far as, he attributis be the notatione he makis in
the confirmatione of his Third Lessone, and be this sentence or decrete
foresaid (call it as he please) the Judgment only to the Apostles, he dois
great injury to the haly Spirit, for quhatsumeuer thing he attributis to the
Aposteles, he sold attribute the same, and mair to the haly Spirit, because he
is put in the writtin letter, before the Apostles, to quhom he geuis the hale
Judgment, making na mentione of the haly Spirit.

Bot happin sum men will ask perchance, quhow can the haly Spirit be ane judge,
in matters of debait concerning Religione, or quhow can he decerne the rycht
interpretation of the Scripture, fra the wrang, in the earth? I answer, it is
sure, that the haly Spirit was send to the Apostles in the earth, as Chri^te
Jesus promisit. John. 14. To teach thaim, and the Kirk of God, to the end of
the world all verity. And tharefore sen he was, and is ane Doctor of the
verity, send to thaim, and the Kirk in earth: quhateuer they be, that wald tak
the Judgment of his awin doctrine (that is the Scripturs, and the
interpretatione of thaim) fra him, or the Judgment of that thing that is
contrare to his doctrine (as he war ane Creature that understood nocht, gif it
war rycht or wrang he teachit) or gif they wald not, grant that he had the
properteis convenient for ane Doctor, as is Judgment of the matter he teachis,
and that he hes, dytit and delyuerit be his ministers, to the Kirk of God, they
wald have him haldin war nor ane dum Doctor, quhilk war ane blasphemous thing
to be hard.

And gif any man will object, because the haly Spirit hes not ane mouth, as man
to pronounce sentence, to interpret Scripturs, and to have communicatione with
men, as earthly Judges hes, he sulde nocht be properly haldin ane Judge, or
ane interpretoure of the Scripturs.

I answer that the mouth of the haly Spirit was the Apostles, quha spak nocht
the Scripturs, nor decernit na thing of thaim, be thaim self: bot the haly
Spirit spoke and decernit be thaim. Tharefore Christ Jesus said to thaim, it
is nocht e that speakis, bot the Spirit of your Father that speakis in ow. Mat
16. Siclyke quhen Stenin held disputatione aganis the Libertines and Syrenitis
(as it writtin Actor: 6.) Quhilk could not be without cytatione,
interpretatione of the Scripturs, and discretione betuix the rycht
understanding of thaim fra the wra^g: it of this disputatio^e, the scripture
attributis na thing to Steuin, bot to the wisdom and Spirit that spoke in
him, quha was na other Spirit, bot the Spirit of God: quha spoke be his
Prophetis, Apostles, and Ministers (as his mouth) before this time. And siclyke
ay sall speak be his Ministers in the earth (as his mouth) all Godly matters,
and specialie concerning Scripturs to the end of the warlde, according to his
promise.

Mairattoure, the Scripturs schawis planelie, that the Devils spoke on to
Christ saying, give thou castis ws out of this, send ws in the heird of
swyne. Math. 8. Siclyke they cryit saying, thou is the Son of God. Mark. 3.
Now they that will grant the Devil to speak, I way they will nocht deny
speech to the haly Spirit. Quharefore sen the haly Spirit, be the scripturs is
perfytlie knawin to be ane doctor in earth, and hes communicatione with the
warlde, be his Ministers (as be his mouth), and they have na Godly thing, bot
be him:

Nocht only may I collectt, that in this council of the Apostles, the haly
Spirit is the only speaking. Judge, and sentence geuar be his word: and the
Apostles, Eldars, and brethren, is bot men, be the quhilk (as Instruments) God
the haly Spirit speakis his word. And siclyke the secunde part of his
notatione, quhilk he makis on the Text, (as he alledgis) is verray slycht
saying, their is na Testimony of the Scripture put in the sentence. Tharefore
the Scripture na wayis occupyis the place of ane Judge. I answer, the haly
spirit is first put in the wryttin decrete, quha is never seperat fra his
Scripturs, nor Iudgis na other wayis, nor they do, nor the Scripturs Iudgis na
other wayis nor he dois. And tharefore he being in the decrete, quha be the
mouth of James, and Peter pronuncit the Scripturs containing the sentence (as
his mouth) it was nocht neidfull that the Scripturs, his Testimoneis, quhilk
before was rytit be Pater and James, sulde have been repetit again in the
decrete. Mairattour and the decrete had been maid on this manner, it hes pleasit
the haly Spirit, and us: or it hes pleasit the word of God and us, it was
necessare that the warlde hade obeyit the decrete. Tharefore it was sufficient,
that ane of thaim was exprimit in the Decrete, and had another of thaim been
exprimit in the Decrete, it had gottin credit, bot as the Decrete of men.
Quharefore be the authority of the Scripturs, and reasons foresaid, I conclude,
that the Kirk of God, (interpret the Kirk as he pleasis, and giving him for
disputations cause, that is is representit, other be general or particulare
councels, quhow dewlie that ever they have been conuenit) is on na wayis
appoyntit Judge be God to decerne, and interpret the rycht understanding of
the Scripture fra the wrang, quhensumeuer questione or debait rysis for the
understanding of the same, nor it na mortal thing. Bot men that hes been at
controversy for matters of Religione, hes chosin the word, and Spirit of God
to be their Judges, be thaim to have the true interpretatione of the difficile
places of the Scripture, and discretione of the rycht understanding of the same
fra the wrang.

And alswa pronunciatione of the sentence in their controversy, that hes been
at debait for any matter of religione: and they have nocht chosin men, to be
their Judges in controuerseis, Bot give it war, for the using of the ordinary
meanis, quhareby all men, quhilk was of sound Judgment, mycht perfytlie see,
quhen any men was at controversy, quhat was the Judgment, and sentence of the
word and Spirit of God, that God walde have schawin to the warlde for thaim
both. Because and they, quhom M. Q. haldis presently the chief Pastors
(quhilk he callis the Kirk) war appointit Judges be God, to decerne and
interpret the rycht understanding of the Scripturs, fra the wrang, throw their
ambitione, and warldly affectionis, the world sold live in perpetual debait
and controversy.

For not only wald they interpret the Scripture at their pleasure, bot alswa
decerne the rycht vnderstandi^g of the Scripturs to be wrang, and the wrang to
be rycht, and the pronounce sentence without the word of God (as their
antecessours hes done before, in sundry matters of Religione) or they losit ane
ounce ofthare leuingis, or ane grane of their vain honors. And swa lean I my
Conclusione, direct contrare for the may part to M. Q. confirmit be
Scripturs, Reasonis, and Doctors sayingis, trewly alledgit (as he alledgis his
Conclusione to be) to the Judgment of the godly and indifferent Reader.
Praying the Almychty God to communicate to him, and to all thais quha is of his
factione, samekle of his wonderful graces, as he thinkis expedient for thaim,
to acknawledge thaim self, laying all warldly affectionis aside, and to do that
thing, quhilk is rycht in his sycht, quha is blissit for ever.

Master Quintine Kennedeis Epistle, directit to the Brethren Protestants.
DEIRLY belouit Freindis and Nychbours, I am aduertisit that their is sum
learnit men of our sect, and opinione, quhilk hes promisit Schortly ane
confutatione of the hale Tractiue, quhilk I have laitly set forth. In favor of
ow, I will do him (quhatsumeuer he be) sum ease and pleasour. And to that
effect I have drawin, and collectit the hale substance and effect of my buik,
in little boundis. And gif he, and all the rest, quhilk favors his sect and
opinione, will confute any part of this breue rehears of our buik, be
scripture, Reasone, and authority, conform to the doctrine of Ancient
Fathers, sic as Hierome, Augustine, Ambrose, Gregore, Chrysostom, Damascene,
Tertuliane, Cypriane, Theophilact, Origenes, or Ireneus, or any of the rest of
the Ancient Fathers, being trewly alledgit; and applyit in contrare my purpose.
It salbe all alyke as he had confutit all our hale work. And als I obleis my
self, be this my hand writ, to renounce my Religione, and subject my self to
our factione: quhilk I rekin na les, nor to renunce the assurit treuth, and
subject my self to great Confusione and incertitude. etc.

To Master Quintine Kennedy Commendatore Abbote of Crosraguel, M. Iohne
Dauidsone wishit grace, health, and peace, from God the Father, throw Jesus
Christ our Lord. etc.
I dout not, bot our lordschip remembers, e send me ane Schort Tractiue, a
little before the beginning of the Reformatione of the Religione in the Kirk of
this Realm, contening the hale substance, and effect of our little buik, quhilk
is, that the Kirk representit be the general Councels, dewely conuenit, is (as
e allege) the only Judge appoyntit be God, to decerne the rycht understanding
of the Scripture, fra the wrang, quhen questione is for the understanding of
the same, to have been presentit in that troublus time to James Betoune
Archebischope of Glasgo, our good Lord and Master, to have had his Judgment
and mind of our said buik, before that time laitly Prentit: quhilk for that
present time, we approuit both to be good and godly, bot sen syne, I finding
the Scripturs sa weill oppinnit, be the ordinary meanis, quhareby God
communicatis unto men, the understanding of his Scripturs, that I could nocht
be langer of our opinione, without I wald have mantenit, as ane shameless man,
that thing quhilk had another ground of Scripture, good reasone, nor
approbatione of the Ancient Doctors. Quhare fore, for the brotherly luife I
bear to all men in Christ, and for the auld Parisiane kyndnes, that was
betuix us, to bring our L. and the people of this Country, fra the error and
blyndnes that this little buik of ours, hes haldin ow and thaim both in. Be
sindrie Scripturs and reasonis I have trauellit, using me heirin, after the
commone manner of Reasoning, without dispyte, or reproach, and on the may
gentile manner I could, I have schawin ow, quhow e have far ouersene our self in
this buik, of the quhilk, in my heart trewly I am sorry. Praying our L.
heirfore, gif e find the Reasonis I bring in aganis ours, to have euacuat the
reasonis of our buik in any sort: understand my labors not to be, that I
desire our L. (quha excedis me far in understanding, and in all kind of
subtle reasoning) to acknawledge our self to be ouercum be me, bot lat the
verity bear away the victory for us both. And be our acknawledgeing of they
things, e have ouersene in our buik, lat als money people cum to the lycht of
the Euangell, as e have haldin fra it, be the same, for God will require their
blude of our handis, and e perseueir in ane wilful obstinacy, without
knawledge. And gif our conscience dytis ow to fauld, and aggre to our sentence,
as e promise in our Bill, heirbefore writtin, gif any part of our Tractiue be
confutit.

Think nocht that any man of Christis Religione, luikis for the glory of our
cumming, to the true Religione teachit us be Christ, as that e come for
writing, or reasoning of man: For we understand all, that their can cum na man
to Christ Jesus, bot he quhom his Father drawis to him: quha is drawing ow,
and all men daily. And tharefore, as our friend, I wish ow to subdew our
understanding, in the service of Christ, and of our cumming, gif it please
God, that e cum to Christ Jesus Religione, we sall attribute na glore thareof
to our self, bot with ow of all our cumming and calling, we sall give God the
glory and thankis: quha often times suffers ane Pharo or other, to ring amangis
his chosin people, be quhom he may both declare his Name throuchout the earth,
and exercise his people. And because, he will have mercy on quhom he will, and
quhom he will, he will hardene. Roma. 9. of quhais will na man can give ane
reasone. Tharefore tak head to our self, quhat e write, that e be not as ane
Pharo halding the people in Egypt of Idolatry and error, fra the true
worshipping of their God, as he hes appointit in his Law: Bot cry for his mercy
and grace (as I sall do with ow) to illuminat our heart with the true knawledge
of his word, that e may leave our Religion inuentit be man, and embrace that
Religione, quhilk is set forth in the lively word of God: quhareby only e may
cum to the Port of Saluatione. And swa fair e weill, as e luife the Lord
Jesus, and auancement of his Kingdom. At the Paedagoge of Glasgw, the First
of March. 1562.
