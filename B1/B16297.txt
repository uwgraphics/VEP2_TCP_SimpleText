AN EXPLICATION OF THE IVDICIALL LAWS OF MOSES.

Plainly discovering diverse of their ancient Rites and Customs.

As in their Governors, Government, Synedrion, Punishments, Civil Accounts,
Contracts, Marriages, Wars, and Burialls.

Also their Oeconomicks, ( Vizt.) their dwellings, Feasting, Clothing, and
Husbandry.

Together with two Treatises, the one showing the different estate of the godly
and wicked in this life, and in the life to come.

The other, declaring how the wicked may be enlightened by the preaching of the
Gospel, and yet become worse after they be illuminated.

All which are cleared out of the Original Languages, and do serve as a
special help for the true understanding of diverse difficult Texts of
Scriptures.

Scotland, Preacher of Gods Word.

Exchange. 1632.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE COLENE, EARL OF SEAFORT, Lord Mackenzee and Kintaill,
one of his MAJESTY'S most Honorable Privy Council in the Kingdom of Scotland.
Honorable and my very good Lord,
GOD who is the God of order and not of confusion, from whom all good things
descend, has placed here below sundry sorts of people; the Ants are a people
not Prove. 30. 25. 26. 27. 28
strong, yet they prepare their meat in the Summer; the Conies are but a feeble
folk, yet make they their houses in the Rocks; the Locusts have no King, yet
go they forth all of them by bands; the Spider takes hold* with her hands,
and is in Kings palaces* this sort of people differ very much, for some of them
are (...), which provide only for the present day, but lay up nothing against
the morrow; the Grasshopper provideth not against the winter as the Ant does;
there are others of them who live by rapine, as the Caterpillars who devour all
and then fly away; and Nahum compares the Merchants Nahum 3. 16.
of Ninive to these, that carry all the wealth away with them* and there are
some of those people which are insatiable, as the Horsleach, that has two
daughters who cry continually, Give, give; This sort of people are Prove. 30. 15.
governed by instinct only; the Locusts have no King, yet they go out in
bands; the Ant has no guide, overseer, or ruler, yet she provideth Prove. 6. 7.
her meat in the Summer, and gathers her food in the harvest, although they
have no King or ruler to command them, and oversee them, neither a guide to
direct them, yet they are ruled by instinct.

There are a second sort of people that God has placed here below, and they
are men; and there is a greater difference amongst this people, than amongst
the former, for look upon some of them, and ye shall hardly discern whether
they be men or not, and as the Philosophers say, there are some sorts of
creatures that we cannot tell whether they live the sensitive or the vegetative
life only, there is so little life in them, as in the Shel-fish; so it is hard
to discern whether those live the reasonable life, or the brutish only, they
have no laws, they lodge in the caves of the earth, go naked, eat raw flesh,
and although they have the shape of men, yet they have but the heart of beasts
in them, as Nebuchadnezzar had. There are other men who are ruled by reason,
and politic government, for their God has taught them, he may be called
their God in this respect, as the Prophet Esaias calls him the Esaias 28. 26
husband-mans God, because he teaches him how to manure the ground, and so God
comes nearer to them; they are a people here, but yet they are not Gods
people, and it is better to be a dorekeeper in the house of God, than in
highest Psalm. 84. 10.
advancement amongst such.

There is a third sort who live in his Church, and this is the highest society
in this life, and here we shall see policy, justice, frugalitie, and all
virtues, because Gods worship is here, and as the inferior faculties of the
soul are eminenter by way of excellency contained in the superior, so are all
those comprehended in Religion, and as the shadow follows the body, so does
policy and order follow Religion; if a man would learn frugalitie, let him
look to Joseph, who taught the Senators of Psalm. 104. 22.
Egypt; if he would learn policy, let him look to the government of Salomons
Court and his 2 King. 4.
house; if he would learn to be a good warrior, let him see what order the
Lord has placed in the Camp of the Jews; and if he Numb. ^0 10.
would learn justice, he shall see it exactly described in the Law of God.

My Honorable Lord, I have made choice of your Lp: to reco^mend this Treatise
to your Patrocinie, because ye know what it is to be amongst Gods people; many
great men if they get their portion in this life amongst the Psalm. 17.
people of this world, they care not to be Denisions in the society of Gods
people, and they content themselves with the portion of this world, and say,
Bonum est hic esse; but this is a freedom which is bought at a higher rate, it
cost the chief Captain a great sum of Act. 22 28.
money* to be made a freeman in Rome; but to be made a freeman in the Church of
GOD, it cost the price of Christ's blood. Great men desire to be out of this
first society, they desire not to live like beasts; but if they come to the
second society, to live like civil men, that does content them; they give GOD
thanks (perhaps) for this, that they are men and not beasts, and that they
have been bred civilly, but few give God thanks for this, that they live
under the Gospel, where they may learn Christ, not many Noble are called. 1
Cor. 2.
Sometimes they may tremble and fear, as Felix Act. 24. 25.
did, and put off their conversion to another Act 26. 28.
time, and some of them are like Agrippa, who almost are persuaded to be
Christians; but Act. 13. 7.
few like Sergius Paulus, who was converted at Paul's preaching.

My Lord, you have had still the practice of Religion in your house, and one of
the best helps to further you, your worthy and religious Lady, whose name
smells now like Hosea 14 7.
the wine of Lebanon, when she is gone, and now she enjoys the fruit of
that, when neither her Nobility, birth, or worldly honor profited nothing;
and this I write unto your Lp: beseeching you to go on in that Christian
course, that both by your place and example, you may draw others unto the
truth. The Lord promised that he would give the Psalm. 2. 8.
uttermost parts of the earth for a possession to his Son; this is the Motto
of this Island, and the farther North, it is the nearer to the ends of the
earth, study therefore my good Lord, that Jesus Christ may have his possession
enlarged in the North, and this shall be your crown in the latter day, when
all your possessions shall fail you.

Your Honors in all dutiful submission, JOHN VVEEMSE:

AN EXPLICATION OF THE IVDICIALL LAWS OF MOSES; As they are annexed to the
Moral and Ceremonial Laws.
Of the Judicial Laws in general.
SOLOMON the Preacher, Eccles 4. 12. says, that a threefold Cord is not
quickly broken. The LORD gave his people three sorts of Laws, as three Cords
to bind them, and to keep them in obedience. The first God gave his Moral,
Judicial, and Ceremonial Law to his people as a threefold Cord.
was his moral Law, which was properly called his Law Deuteronomy. 6. 1. Secondly, he
gave them his Ceremonial Laws, which are called his Statutes and Decrees,
Exodus 12. 24. And thirdly, his Judgments, which were the Judicial Laws, Mal.
4. 4. Deuteronomy. 24. 17.

These Judicial Laws were Determinations of the The Judicial Law what.
Moral Law.

A Determination is either Iuris divini or Humani; these Determinations in
Moses judicial Laws are divini Determinatio
Iuris divini. Iuris humani.

juris; therefore they had greater force to bind the Jews, than any
municipall Law has to bind the Subjects now, in respect they were given by
God himself, and these Laws of men which draw nearest to them in equity, are
most perfect; although particularly they cannot be fitted to every Nation, no
more than a shoe of one measure can serve for every foot.

The second sort of Determination is Iuris humani, when men determinate, where
there is no express commandment of God, as concerning circumstances, time,
places, persons, and such. God commands in his law, that they should pay
their first fruits, but he determines not how much they should pay of their
first fruits; then the Priests come in with their humane determination, that
the most shall give no more than one of fifty, and the least shall give no
less than one of sixty. When Israelites were traveling in the Wilderness,
they had the Cloud to direct them by day, and the pillar of fire to direct them
by night; yet they desired Iethro to be eyes to them, Number. 10. 31. What need
had they of Iethro to be eyes to them, seeing they had the Cloud by day and the
pillar of fire by night? Iethro was a guide to them, to show them the
particular places and ways in the Wilderness, as the Cloud and the pillar
were their guide to direct them to Canaan. So humane Determinations and Laws,
are but guides in particular circumstances.

Humane Laws they command, they forbid, and A comparison betwixt Humane Laws
and Moses Judicial Laws.
sometimes they permit, and lastly they punish: so ye shall see all these
four in Moses Judicial Law. First, his Judicial Laws do command, but they
command the outward man only, and here Moses speaks to (...) Ignea lex.
them but as a Judge, and they differ from that fiery Law, the moral Law,
that searches and peirceth into the heart, Deuteronomy. 33. 2.

Secondly, Humane Laws do prohibit and forbid; so do these Judicial Laws,
and there are more of them which are Negatiues than Affirmatiues, to show us the
perverse nature of man.

Thirdly, Humane Laws give way and permit something Why Moses Judicial Laws
permit many things.
for the eschewing of greater evil; so does Moses Judicial Law, Levit. 27.
10. When a man offered a Beast unto the Lord which he had vowed, he might not
change a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; this was commanded only for
eschewing of greater evil; for if it had been lawful to change once, a good
in place of a bad one, then they would have come quickly to this, to have
changed a bad for a good: So this Law permitted divorcement for the hardness
of the peoples hearts, and for the eschewing of greater inconvenience, least
hard-hearted men should have killed their wives.

Fourthly, the punishments inflicted by humane laws The punishments of the
Judicial Law alterable.
are alterable: so were the punishments in Moses Judicial Law; therefore the
Jews say of them, ascendunt and descendunt, which they understand, not of the
greatest and highest transgressions, but praecepta media, their middle Precepts
did forbid. Example, Ex. 22. If a man kept a pushing Ox, knowing that he were
wont to push, if he kill a man, then the Law ordains that the man shall die,
or else to redeem himself with a sum of money; here the Law ascended or
descended: but if a man had wilfully killed a man, that was praeceptum grave,
the punishment neither ascended nor descended, but he was to die the death.

The Scripture compares the moral Law to a prison, Gal. 3. 22. the
Ceremonial Law to a second Ward, and these Judicial Laws to a Iailor, to
keep the transgressors in close prison that none of them break out.

CHAPTER 1. That Kingly Government is the best Government.
IVDG. 17. 6. In those days there was no King in Israel, but every man did
that which was good in his own eyes.
IN government there are five things to be considered; first, potestas;
secondly, ordo; thirdly, modus; fourthly, titulus; and fifthly, vsus.

First, there must be a power to exercise government; Five things in Government.
secondly, order, that some command and some obey, some to be superiors and
some to be inferiors; thirdly, the manner, whether the government be
Monarchical by one, or Aristocraticall by more; fourthly, the title whether it
be by Succession, or Election; and last the use, how they exercise this
Authority.

That there should be a power and order in Government, What things essential
and what accidental in Government.
these two are essential in all Governments, no Government can stand without
these two; but the manner, whether it be by one or by more; and the title,
whether it be by Succession or Election; and the use, whether they govern well
or not; these three are but accidental in Government.

Of these two sorts of Government Monarchical is Monarchical the best
Government.
the best.

Levi ben Gerson upon the 1 Samuel 8. holds that Aristocraticall Their reasons
who hold Aristocraticall Government to be the best.
Government is best, and to be preferred to Kingly Government; learn, says
he, what has befallen us under the hand of Kings; David caused the plague to
come upon the people. 2 Samuel 24. 15. Ahab restrained the rain for three
years. 1 King. 17. and Zedekiah caused the Sanctuary to be burnt, 2 Chro. 36.
14. and the Jews apply that saying of Hos^a, I gave them a King in mine anger,
and took him away in my wrath. Hos. 13. 11. That is, I gave them their first
King Saul in mine anger, and I took away their last King Zedekiah in my
indignation. But the Jews distinguish not well here betwixt We must
distinguish betwixt the parts of a Kings person, and the faults of the Office.
the faults of a Kings person, and the calling it self; good Kings did many
excellent things amongst them; for David a man according to Gods own heart,
fought the battles of the Lord, 1 Samuel 25. 28. appointed the order Kings have
been the Instruments of much good.
of the Priests, and Levites, and Singers, 1 Chro. 24. and 25. He made many
Psalms to the praise of God. And Solomon who succeeded him, built the Temple,
wrote many excellent Proverbs and Parables, 1 King. 4. 32. And kept peace in
Israel, that every man might dwell safely under his own Vine-tree, and under
his Figgetree, 1 King. 4. 25.

Now that Monarchical Government is the best government, Reasons prooving
Monarchical government to be the best.
it is proved thus.

Kingly or Monarchical Government resembles Gods government most,

Kingly government is the fittest government to repress Israel, every man did
that which he pleased; Micah set up an Idol. Kingly government fittest to
repress sin.
Judge. 18. and they defiled the Levites Concubine, because there was no King in
Israel. By King, here is not meant any other sort of government, but Kingly
government, as is evident, Judge. 18. 17. There was no Magistrate (...) haeres
interdicti a (...) hereditare, vel possidens regnum, (...) possi^ere (...)
regnum.
then, but in the original it is, there was no heir of restraint then to put
them to shame, Ioresh gnetzer, which may be interpreted either haeres
interdicti, or possidens regnum, there was none to possess the Kingdom, or
there was not an heir of restraint. Here two things are to be observed; first,
that that is the best government which restrains sin most; secondly, that
that government which is by an heir of restraint, is fittest to repress
sin; but the government Monarchical is such, and not Aristocraticall, for
it comes not per haeredem, but only by Election. Observe what GOD himself
says to his people, Deuteronomy. 17. 20. that he may prolong his days in his
Kingdom, he and his children in the midst of Israel. Here the Kingdom goes
by succession, and not by election; here was an heir of restraint to repress
sin.

It is objected, if Government be hereditary, then Cambyses will succeed to
good Cyrus.

So in Kingly government, good Hezekiah succeeded Ahaz, and if we receive good
at the hands of God, why should we not receive evil also, Job 2. 10?

Thirdly, they allege Josephus testimony, Jews dealing with Pompey to change
their Government, Lib. 4. Antiq. 5.
and that they would be no longer under Kings; and so they bring Lactantius
citing Seneca, speaking of the Commonwealth Lactantius lib. 17 c* 15.
of Rome* Pueritiam sub caeteris regibus egisse, ait, a quibus auctam and
disciplinis plurimis institutisque formatam; at vero Tarquinio regnante, cum
jam quasi adulta esse caepisset, servitium non tulisse; and superbo jugo
dominationis rejecto, maluisse legibus obtemperare quam regibus.

When the Jews wished that Pompey The Romans find fault with the person of
their King, and not with his Office.
they wished only, that they might be more gently used; they blamed the
persons, and not the government simply; and so the Romans were weary of
Tarquinius government, but they were not weary of Kingly government, as long as
their Kings ruled them well.

Their Deduction then seems not to have a good ground, who simply do
prefer Aristocracie to Monarchy; first, they say Moses was extraordinarily
called, and Joshua succeeded him; and after that, the government of the
Synedrion or Seventie was settled amongst them, whose government was
Aristocraticall, Nomb. 11. The Judges were set up but for a time over them, and
they were raised up extraordinarily; and then the government was still the
Lords, as we see in the example of Gideon, Judge. 8. and of Iephthe, Judge. 9.
And after, that the Judges had ruled and governed them, then came Saul, whose
government arose from the coffeehouse of the people, but they say it
continued in the house of David especially, because he was a type of Christ;
but simply they say, that God liked Aristocracie best.

But seeing the Lord was minded to give the people of the Jews a King, and
tells them what King he would God was minded to give the Jews a King.
choose, Deuteronomy. 17. How liked he Aristocracie best? and he likes that
government here. Judge. 18. 17. which is by the heir of restraint or the heir
of the Kingdom.

The Conclusion of this is, let us be thankful to God Belial.

CHAPTER II. An Explication of Iothams Apologue.

Similitudes; and in these we must not so much look to the Letter, as to that
which they call (...), or the thing signified by the Apologue.

Iotham brings in here the trees anointing a King, All the trees refuse the
Government.
and they make choice of three most excellent trees; the Olive, the Fig, and
the Vine-tree, and they all refused, and then they make choice of the Bramble.
The The trees described by their properties.
three excellent trees which refuse the government, the Olive, the Fig, and
the Vine-tree, are described by three properties; the Olive for his fatness,
the Fig Tree for its sweetness, and the Vine-tree because it cheared God and
man: The Olive Judge. 9. 9. says, should I lea^e my fatness, wherewith by me
they honor God and man; in the Hebrew it is Hehhadalti, as if it should say,
(...) ex hiphil and hophal compositum, sensus est, vestris^e verbis persuasa
ita missam facere pinguedinem m^am, juxta hiphil, and ^a ipsa quoque priver and
deficiar juxta hophal, nihilque amplius h^b^^m in me commendabile. The trees
serve for a natural, civil, and religious use.
will ye persuade me with your fair words to l^aue my fatness, that I should
be altogether deprived of it, so that I have nothing left in me worthy of
commendation.

And if we will compare these three trees together, we must consider them first
as they serve for natural uses; secondly, as they serve for civil uses; and
thirdly, for religious uses; and then we shall see the excellency of these
trees.

First, in their natural use; consider the wood of the Olive how far it
excels the wood of the Fig Tree, The wood of the Olive tree excels the
rest.
or the Vine-tree; The Cherubims were made of the Olive tree, 1 King. 6. 23.
which was a wood both of indurance fit to be carved or cut, better than the
Algum or Almug trees which Hiram sent to Solomon, 1 King. 10. 11. and it was
better than the Cedar of Lebanon; the wood of the Fig Tree was but a base sort
of wood, but the Vine-tree is the basest of of all, Ezekiel. 15. 2. 3. will a man
take a pin of it to hinge any vessel, it serves for no use if it be not
fruitful; it is like the salt, if it loose the savor, it is good for nothing,
Mat. 5. 13.

Secondly, consider the fruit of these trees; the Vine is Their use in natural
things.
uvifera, the Olive is baccifera, and the Fig Tree is pomifera, and they
serve for most excellent uses in nature; the Wine serves to cheer the heart
of man, Psalm. 104. 15. and Pro. 31. 16. give Wine to him that is of a sad
heart, so the Oil makes the face to shine, Psalm. 104. 15. and it is good for
the anointing of the body. A Roman being asked how it came to pass that he
lived so long? he said intus melle, and foris ol^o: it is fit for the anointing
of the (...) qui ungebat, (...) qui unctus fuit, ab (...) ungo.
body: therefore those who wrestled of old were called Aliptae.

Secondly, they have good use in curing of wounds, the Samaritane powered Wine
and Oil in the man's wounds, Luke 10. 34. and the Fig is good to mature a
boil; the Lord commanded to lay a lump of Figs to Hezekias boil, Esaias. 36.

For civil uses, the Oil excels the Wine and the unguentum
militare. conv^vale. funebre.

Fig, for by me they honor man, Judge. 9. 9. There is Vnguentum militare,
wherewith their Kings were anointed to go out as their Captains before them
to the Battle; so David was anointed amongst the midst of his brethren to be
their Captain and King, 1 Samuel 16. 13. Secondly, there was Vnguentum
convivale, Eccles. 9. 8. Let not Oil be wanting to thy head, and let thy
clothes be white. And thirdly, was Vnguentum funebre, as that box of Ointment
which was powered upon Christ's head, Math. 26. 12.

Now let us consider them in their spiritual uses, as The spiritual use of
these trees.
they served for the worship of God; under the old Testaments the Wine and the
Oil were used in their Sacrifices, the Oil in their Meat Offering and the
Wine in their Drinke-offering; so in anointing their High Priests; but the
Fig had no use in their Ceremonial worship; but in his worship under the
Gospel the Wine goes before the Fig or the Olive, for it is the sign of our
Lords blood in the Sacrament.

The Olive, the Vine, and the Fig tree, fitly represent These trees fitly
represent a good King.
a good King; the Olive for his fatness to cure and heal their wounds, Esa.
3. 7. Non ero Hhobhes, I will not be a healer. The Seventie translateth it,
(...) ligator vulnerum; (...) Ligator vulnerum.
it is the part of a good Prince to power Oil in the wounds of his wounded
Subjects. Secondly, the Fig tree for his sweetness represents a good King.
1 King. 12. 7. If thou will be a servant unto this people, and serve them this
day, then they will serve thee for ever. So David spoke mildly and sweetly to
the people, 1 Chronicles. 28. 2. Hear me my brethren and my people. Thirdly, the
Vine-tree represents a good King; the Wine gladdeth the heart, so the light
of the Kings countenance is life, and his favor is a cloud of the latter
rain, Prove. 16. 15.

When these trees which were excellent for their fruit Three refused the
Government, Debora, Gideon, and Iephthe.
had refused the Government, then they made choice of the Bramble for their
King; the Bramble represented a bad King. First, the Bramble brings forth no
fruit; Secondly, the Bramble has no shadow to shadow the The many evils which
the Bramble brought with it.
rest; thirdly, Rhamnus the Bramble is full of prickles, whatsoever it touches
it holds fast, and it makes blood to follow; it was with this sort of thorn
wherewith Christ was crowned; the Italians call it Spina sancta: Fourthly, the
fire came from the Bramble and did not only burn the shrubs of the field, but
also the Cedars which were tall, which might have seemed to be exempted* from
this tyranny.

The Persians said of Cyrus their King, that he was their Father, and Darius
their King was (...), a Vintner (...).
who sold them, but Cambyses their King was (...) their Lord who hardly ruled
over them.

The conclusion of this is, a good King is much to be who feeds a flock and
eats not of the milk, 1 Cor. 9. 7. Thirdly, he is the husband and his
Subjects are his wife, and therefore she is called a widow when she wants her
King, Lament. 1. 1. What great lamentation does a widow make when she wants her
loving husband Josias, then she poured her liver out upon the ground, her eyes
failed with tears, and her bowels were troubled, Lament. 2. 11. Last, the
Prince is the soul and the Subjects are the body, and the body should do all
things for the good of the soul; he is the breath of our nostrils, Lament. 4.
12. We see how many obligations the Subjects owe to their King.

CHAPTER III. Why was God angry with them for choosing of a King.
1 SAMUEL 8. 7. And the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the
people in all that they say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but
they have rejected me that I should not reign over them.
KIngly Government being the best Government, God was not angry simply with the
Jews for choosing of a King, but because they prevented the time.
why was the LORD then angry with the Jews for choosing of a King?

He was not angry with them simply for desiring and choosing a King, but for
the manner of their choice; for God was minded to have given them a King, but
they would not stay the Lords leisure, but anticipated the time; therefore the
Jews say of them, comederunt immaturam uvam, the grape was not ripe enough as
yet; we may see that God was minded to have given them a King, Deuteronomy. 17.
because he tells them what sort of King they should choose, and what he
should do; and they say, that he gave them three things in commandment Three
things given in commandment to the Jews when they entered into Canaan.
when they entered into Canaan; first, to choose a King; secondly, to root out
the Canaanites; and thirdly, to build a Temple for his worship: God was angry
with them that they sought a King so long as good Samuel ruled over them; he
was angry with them because they would have a King to reign over them after
the manner of the Nations, Deuteronomy. 17. 14. I will set a King over me like all the
Nations round about me, but thou shall set them over thee whom the Lord thy God
will choose: If they had said to Samuel, give one to reign over us after thy
death, because thy children are corrupt, 1 Samuel 8. 3. or give us one who may
govern us in equity; this had been no offense to God: but simply to desire a
King like the Kings of the Nations, this was their sin, and herein they
rejected not Samuel, but God himself, 1 Samuel 8. 7.

How was God rejected when they chose a King, Prove. 8. and the Kings throne is
Gods throne, 1 Chro. 29. 23. and 1 King. 2. 15.

The Lord did reign over them in both these sorts of The Judges had not such
absolute government over the people as the Kings had.
as when the Kings reigned over them; the Judges might make no Laws, nor take
tribute of the people as the Kings might do; therefore the Lords immediate
Government did more appear when the Judges ruled them, Judge. 8. 23. I will not
rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you, the Lord shall rule over
you. And when they rejected Samuel here they said in effect, as the Jews said
when they disclaimed Christ, We will have no King to reign over us but Caesar,
Ioh. 19. 15. When the Judges Gods power did more appear when the Judges ruled,
but his goodness and mercy appeared more when the Kings ruled.
ruled over them then Gods power did more appear helping them by weak means;
but when the Kings reigned over them, then Gods wisdom and his goodness did
more appear in settling a government amongst them, and making their Kings types
of Christ. And as in Gods miracles his power did more appear, but in his
ordinary course working by nature his wisdom and goodness appeared more; so
in these two forms of Government, his power did appear more when the Judges
ruled over them; but in settling the Kingly government amongst them, his
goodness and his wisdom did more appear.

The conclusion of this is, happy is that Kingdom a me, per me, and propter
me: a me when he is sent by the Lord; per me, when he is sustained and upholden
by the Lord; and propter me, when he serves to glorify God in his Kingdom.

CHAPTER IIII. What Samuel means by Mishpat Hammelech. (...)

1 SAMUEL 8. 11. And he said this will be the manner of the King that shall
reign over you, etc.
KIMCHI says whatsoever is set down in this Text, it is lawful for the King
to do it, and therefore he interprets Mishpat Melech 1 Samuel (...) Lex Regis.
8. 8. This shall be the Law of the King, or this is the thing which the King
may do by the Law; the Chaldie Paraphrast paraphraseth it Nimusa, a Law.

Wars; and he says in necessitate omnia pertinent ad jus regis, sed extra
necessitatem non pertinent: But this is not the meaning of the place.

The Lord is describing here to them, that King which Samuel describes a
tyrant, and not what a King may lawfully do.
he is to give to them in his wrath, and not what a lawful King may do; and
Mishpat here signifies not a Law, but the manner and custom of him who should
do such things, as 1 Samuel 2. 13. And the Priests [Mishpat] custom was with
the people to take the flesh of the sacrifice that did not belong to him. Here
it cannot be translated, it was the Priests Law, for it had been sacrilegious
theft in the Priest to have taken any part of the sacrifice, but that which was
due to him. So this should be the [ Mishpat] or custom of this King whom God
sent in his wrath, that he should take any thing which he pleased from them,
although it had not been for necessary uses; but 1 Samuel 10. 25. the word
Mishpat is taken in another (...) Lex Regni.
sense, then Samuel told the people [Mishpat Hammelocha] the law of the
Kingdom, and laid it up before the Arc. Here Mishpat is taken in another
sense, how the King should rule the Country, and this Book Samuel laid up
before the Arc; but this Mishpat was not laid up before the Arc, but was set
down as a punishment for that people.

Now that this King which Samuel describes unto them (whom God sent in his
wrath) might not do Reasons prooving that he was not a lawful King, who is
described here.
these things to his Subjects by lawful authority, the reasons are these.

First, God gave them this King in his anger, and took him away in his wrath,
Hos. 13. 11. Which cannot be said of any King in whom there is but the least
sparkle of goodness.

Secondly, He will take your [ Cerem] not only your (...)

but the good Kings of Israel never did so, they set not the Israelites to any

CHAPTER V. A Difference betwixt the Election of Saul, and the Election of
David.
1 SAMUEL 13. 14. The Lord has sought him a man after his own heart.
FIrst Saul was chosen but out of the tribe of Benjamin, but David out of the
tribe of Judah; and the Kingdom was intailed to him and his posterity, but not
to the posterity of Saul. In Christ's genealogy none is called a King but
David only.

Secondly, Saul was chosen by lot, but David more Saul was chosen by lot, David
immediately.
immediately by God; and even as Matthias when he was chosen by lot, his
calling was not so solemn as Paul's was: so neither was the calling of Saul so
solemn as was the calling of David, Non tam misit Deus Saulum quam permisit
populo.

Thirdly, when he speaks of David, he says 1 Samuel 13. 14. Quaesivi, Bikkesh
est diligenter inquirere, Cant. 3. (...) diligenter inquirere.
Exodus 4. 19. 2 Samuel 22. 33. And he was as glad in finding of him, as the Widow
was when she found her groat, who called in her neighbors to rejoice with her
when she had found it, Luke 16. 9.

Fourthly, Quaesivi mihi, est dativus Commodi. Zach. 9. Mihi est datirus
commodi, id est, in commodum meum.
9. Behold thy King comes unto thee; that is, for thy profit and benefit. So
David was the King that would serve for the Lords glory.

Fifthly, he chose David according to his own heart, this was verbum amoris;
and there was great similitude betwixt David's heart, and Gods own heart. The
Jews observe concerning David, that when he had sinned in numbering of the
people, God said to the Prophet, Go tell David, 2 Samuel 24. 12. 1 Chronicles. 21.
10. Giving him How the Lord calls David his servant.
no other title but David; as Kimchi marketh upon that place; but when he had a
purpose to build a house for the Lord, then he said Go tell my servant David,
2 Samuel 7. 5. 1 Chronicles. 17. 4. Showing what account he makes of such, and how
acceptable men are to him, when they seek his glory, and the good of his
Church. So when the people had committed Idolatry, the Lord calls them Moses
people, Go get thee down, for thy people Why God called the Israelites Moses
people.
which thou broughtst out of Egypt, have corrupted themselves, Exodus 32. 7. He
calls them not my people, because they were blotted with such a blot as was
not to be found in his children, Deuteronomy. 32. 5. Now because David was a King fit
for Gods worship, see how friendly he speaks of him, I have sought to me a
man; that is, an excellent man.

Sixthly, according to my heart; I made not choice of God chose not David for
his stature.
him for his comely stature, as the people made choice of Saul, but I chose him
because he was a man according to mine own heart.

The Conclusion of this is, 1 Samuel 16. 7. a man judges according to his eyes,
but the Lord looks to the heart; the Carntos hab^re oc^los quid.
Lord has not eyes of flesh, Job 10. 4. That is, he looks not to outward
qualities as men do; but his eyes pierce into the heart; and he made choice of
David, because he saw his heart was upright. The heart of the Prince is the
object of the eye of God.

CHAPTER VI. Of the anointing of their Kings, and whether the Kings and Priests
were anointed with the same Oil or not.
PSALM. 89. 27. I have found David my servant, with my holy Oil have I anointed
him.
ALthough the anointing of the Kings and Priests How the anointing of the Kings
and Priests pertains to the Judicial Law.
was a thing ceremonial under the Law, yet thus far it falls under the
Judicial Law: first, what Kings and their sons succeeding them were
anointed; secondly, whether the Priests and the Kings were anointed with the
same Oil or not.

There were three sorts of persons anointed under the Law, Kings, Priests, and
Prophets.

All the Priests were anointed at the first, both the All the Priests at the
first were anointed.
high Priests and the inferior Priests, Levit. 8. but afterward only the high
Priest was anointed and his sons after him, Levit. 6. 21. and 21. 10. and 16.
32. therefore he was called the anointed of the Lord.

The Priest when he was anointed, first, he was anointed How the Priest was
anointed.
with Oil, secondly, sprinkled with blood, and thirdly, with blood and oil,
Levit. 8. The first was upon his head, the second upon his flesh, and the third
upon his garments.

So the King was anointed, but the Kings son was What Kings were anointed.
not anointed, if his father was anointed before him; one anointing served for
both, because the Kingdom is the Kings inheritance for ever, Deuteronomy. 17. 20. But
if there had been a sedition, they did anoint him, to pacify the people, and
settle the sedition, and to make known who was the right King; as Solomon was
anointed, because Maymone in his Treatise of the Implements of the Sanctuary,
cap. 1. sect. 4.
of the sedition of Adonijah, 1 King. 1. and Ioash because of Athalia, 2 King.
11. and Ioahaz because of his brother Iehojakim, 2 King. 23. 30.

Whether were the Kings and Priests anointed with

There were four Kings anointed at the first with common Oil, called the Oil
of Balsom; but not with holy Oil. First, Saul was anointed with this common
Four Kings anointed both with common oil, and with the holy cyle.
Oil when Samuel first anointed him, this was done in Rama, where neither the
Sanctuary nor holy Oil were; secondly, he who was anointed with this common
oil was David by Samuel at Bethlehem; thirdly, Hasael and Iehu by one of the
children of the Prophets, 2 King. 9. 1. And the Jews say, that those who were
anointed by the Prophets, were anointed with common Oil; but those who were
anointed by the high Priest were anointed with holy Oil.

But Saul when he was made King over Israel at Mizpeh, was anointed with the
holy oil by the high Priest, and David was anointed with the holy Oil at
Hebron and at Jerusalem; when they were anointed before by the Prophets, it was
but a preparation to this holy Oil.

The Church of Rome holds that the King and the Becanus de jure regio.
Priest were not anointed with the same Oil, that they may advance the Pope
above Princes: their reason is this;

None that had the holy Oil upon his head might lament for the dead. Levit.
21. 10. But the King might lament for the dead; therefore he was not anointed
with the same Oil wherewith the high Priest was anointed: they prove that the
King might lament for the dead, as David did for Absalom, 2 Samuel 18. 33. so for
Abner, 2 Samuel 3. 21.

Although the King and the Priest were both anointed David's mourning after the
Beer; R: Judah answers, Why the high Priest might not mourn for the dead.
that David did this to purge himself, that he was not guilty of the blood of
Abner: and the Text says, that the people and all Israel understood that day,
that it was not Why David mourned for Absolon and Abner.
of the King to slay Abner the son of Ner, 2 Samuel 3. 27. The ceremony gave
place here to the necessity, he mourned that he might take the suspicion out
of the hearts of the people: and for his mourning for Absalom, his passion
miscarried him.

Now the reasons proving that they were both anointed with the same sort of
Oil are these.

First, the Oil wherewith the Kings were anointed, with mine holy Oil have I
anointed him, Psalm. 89. 27.

Secondly, these are the two Olive branches that stood before the Lord, Zach.
4. 11. The Chaldie Paraphrast paraphraseth it thus; those are Zerubbabel and
Joshua, the Prince of the people, and the high Priest; because they were both
anointed with the same sort of Oil.

But there was none of this sort of Oil in the second Vnctus Iehovae, but vir
multarum vestium; he was distinguished then from the rest of the Priests by the
several Ornaments which he wore, but not by his anointing.

Although there was no material oil in the second Temple, wherewith they
anointed the King and Priest, yet the spiritual anointing was figured here, by
the comparison taken from the anointing in the Temple. So Nehem. 7. 65. there
was neither Vrim nor Thummim in the second Temple, yet by the form in the
first Temple he expresses what Priests shall be in the second Temple.

Thirdly, the King was in dignity above the high Sam. 7. 18. Is it probable
then that he was anointed with an inferior sort of oil to that wherewith the
Priest was anointed?

A comparison betwixt David's anointing and Christ, David thrice anointed, so
was Christ.
David was thrice anointed; first, in Bethlehem secretly by Samuel; secondly,
at Hebron; and thirdly, at Jerusalem: so Jesus Christ was anointed in the womb
of the Virgin; secondly, this anointing manifested it self more when he taught
at Nazaret, Luke 4. 13. 14. see Act. 7. 37. 38. And this anointing was fully
manifested in his resurrection, Psalm. 45.

David was anointed a King, but he was not an anointed Prophet to attend upon
that calling only, as Esaias and Jeremiah; but Christ was anointed both King and
Prophet: Melchizedeck was a King and a Priest, but he was not a King, Priest,
and Prophet, as Christ was. None anointed King, Priest, and Prophet, but Jesus
Christ.
Samuel was a Priest and a Prophet; but he was not a King, Priest, and Prophet,
as Christ was. There was never any anointed King, Priest, and Prophet, but
Christ only, and we are made in him regale sacerdotium, 1 Pet. 1. 9. a royal
Priesthood.

It may be asked seeing all the children of God are Mesichim, or Christ's,
whether is this Christ's proper name, or is it an appellatiue name?

It is but his appellatiue name, and Jesus is his proper Mesichim, but Christ
is Hameshiah, that anointed of the Lord, Luke 2. 26. He is not so much called
the anointed in concreto, as the oil in abstracto, Esaias 10. I will take away
the yoke for the Oils Christ called the oil.
sake, that is, for the anointeds sake Jesus Christ.

The Pope claims to be above Kings in his anointing, exalts himself above
all that are called gods, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 4. that is, above all Princes and Kings.

CHAPTER VII. How the Kings of Judah and Israel, brake this Commandment in
multiplying riches.
DEVT. 17. 17. Neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold,
etc.
ITis lawful for Kings to multiply riches by lawful means; first, of their
own proper inheritance, How the Kings of Judah and Israel might multiply
riches.
1 Chronicles. 29. 3. this the Hebrews call Segulla, I have of my own proper good.
Secondly, the King may multiply his riches by husbandry, as Vzzia did, 2 Chronicles.
26 10. So by tributes and gifts given unto him by other Nations, 2 Chronicles. 17.
5. in token of their homage and subjection. So with things purchased by lawful
war from captives, 2 Samuel 8. 10. and 1 Chro. 18. 22. 2 Chro. 15. 7. So for
the safety of his Country, and for the good of his Subjects, he may require
tributes and taxations from the people, and more than ordinary Subsidies, which
all turns to their good: for as the vapors which are drawn up to the Clouds,
are not reserved there, but are sent down to the earth again to water it, and
to make it fruitful; so the Subsidies which the King exacteth from the people
this ways, come back again to their use, to keep and to defend them.

David had great riches, and he got his riches three How David came by his
riches.
ways: first by his tributes; secondly, by the spoil of his enemies; for he
fought twenty battles, and got all the spoil from the enemies; and thirdly,
he had argentum capitationis, the pole money of all the people; and all this he
laid up for the building of the Temple of the Lord; therefore he says 1 Chro.
22. 14. Now behold [Begnaneij] in my poverty or affliction, I have prepared
for (...) in afflictione mea.
the house of the Lord an hundredth thousand talents of gold, etc. Why calls
he it, his poverty? because he had nothing but that which he had from the
Lord, 1 Chronicles. 29. 16. And therefore he would return it back again for the
building of a house to him: here David multiplied silver, but not contrary to
the law. So Solomon Solomon how he came by his riches.
exceeded all the Princes of the earth in riches, his Dominion was from the
river of Egypt to Euphrates; and from Libanus Northward, to the Mediterran Sea,
all those were tributaries to him; the Queen of Sheba brought out of Arabia
Faelix much spices to him, 1 King. 10. And he had three Navies that came home
every third year with gold and precious stones; and the whole twelve tribes
paid tribute to him: he did not here contrary to the law, that the King should
not multiply riches, but that blessing was then fulfilled in him which was
made to Abraham, that his seed should possess, from the river of Egypt to
Euphrates.

The Law says, Deuteronomy. 17. 17. Non multiplicabit sibi (...)
valde [lo jarbe lo meod,] in 2 Chronicles. 32. 27. it is said of Hezekias that he
had exceeding much riches: [Harbe meod,] the very same words which are in the
interdiction, did Hezekias gather his riches contrary to the law here? Not; the
meaning of the law then is this, that a King should not multiply gold and
silver, to put his confidence in them, or for unnecessary uses; and it seems
that Solomon brake not this law until the Temple was built, the City
enlarged, and the wars ended; then for him in his old age to lay such heavy
tributes and taxations upon the people, was to multiply riches unto a wrong
end: when Solomon gave gold and silver at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, 2
Chro. 1. 15. This was lawful to give to his Subjects, but Eccles. 2. 8. he
says, I gathered me also silver and gold, when he gathered it only to
satisfy his covetous desire, and not for necessary uses, that was the
transgression of the Law.

The next part of the interdiction was this, that he should not multiply
horses to himself.

The end of this interdiction was first, to take away all commerce and dealing
with the Egyptians; for having commerce with the Egyptians, and bringing horses
from thence, they were in danger to be infected with Idolatry. Secondly, he
forbad them to multiply horses, least Why God forbad them to multiply.
they should trust in them, Psalm. 20. 7. Some trust in Chariots, and some in
Horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. He forbad to
multiply horses to trust in them, therefore the Lord commands Joshua 11. 6.
Thou shall hough their horses, [Tegnakker Susehen] subner (...) Subnervahis
equos.
equos, thou shall not kill them, but cut the mast^rsinew, and make them unfit
for any service and war hereafter, that they might do no service against the
people of God afterward: they might take Camels Joshua why commanded to hough
the horses.
and Asses in the Battle, Numb. 31. 11. and such bcasts as were not fit for
the wars, and if at any time they reserved any of the Horses, it was but a
small number: so we see 2 Samuel 8. 4. that David of a thousand Chariots and
seven hundredth horsemen which he took in the wars, reserved only horses
for an hundredth Chariots; but he houghed all the rest of the Chariot horses, he
left them so, that they might serve for other uses, but not for the wars, and
he reserved here but the tenth part of them; Solomon at the first was commended
for the multitude of his horses, because he kept them for the defense of the
Country; but the Law forbids When horses and silver may be multiplied.
to keep them for unnecessary uses, for ostentation, or for trusting in them,
and so Solomon fell afterward to multiply horses and gold exceedingly, but
not for necessary uses; and see how Esaias is a Commentary to this law, cap. 2.
7. 8. and shows us the end of this interdiction, when he says, the land is
full of silver and gold, Multiplying of horses and gold, draw them to Idolatry.
neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of their
horses, neither is there any end of their Chariots; their land is also full of
Idols. Here we see why the Lord forbids them to multiply horses, because
these drew them to make a league with Idolaters, and made them worship Idols.

Thirdly, the King is forbidden to multiply Wives, The heathens multiply Wives.
Pro. 31. 3. Give not thy strength to women, nor thy ways to that which
destroys Kings; the Heathen Kings gave themselves much to have many wives:
Asshuerus commanded, that through all his Provinces which were an hundredth
twenty and seven, that the most beautiful Virgins should be brought to him,
Esth. 2. 3. And Darius had as many wives as there are days in the Iusti^i.
lib. 12.

The number of Salomons Wives and Concubines are The reconciliation of these

reckoned diversely, 1 King. 11. 3. it is said that he had seve^ hundredth wives
Princesses, and three hundredth Concubines: but Cant. 6. 8. there are sixty
Queens and eighty Concubines, and Virgins without number: where he alludeth
to the number of Salomons wives: Genebrard goes about to reconcile the places
this ways, that Solomon at the first had but sixty Queens, and eighty
Concubines; but afterward their number came to seven hundredth wives, and three
hundredth Concubines; but this reconciliation cannot stand; for then it should
follow that Solomon wrote the Canticles before he repented; but the true
reconciliation is this, although he had seven hundredth Queens, yet he had
sixty of them who were Sixty Queens which were in favor with him.
most in favor with him, and honored by the people, and these are set down,
Cant. 6. 8. and they were brought forth that day that Solomon married Pharaohs
daughter, and when they saw her, they praised her beauty and dignity, and
they said, who is she that looks out at the windows as the morning; the
whole number of his Wives and Concubines seems to have been a thousand,
Eccles. 2. 28. Of men I have found one of a thousand, but I have not found a
woman amongst these thousands.

This Law that the King should not multiply wives, The Jews restraint of
multiplying wives.
the Jews restrained it to eighteen wives; they say that David the King had
sixteen wives, 2 Samuel 15. 16. the King left ten women which were Concubines to
keep the house; these Concubines were his wives, and besides it is said, 1
Chro. 3. 6. that he had six wives more, in all he had sixteen. So Rehoboam had
eighteen wives, 2 Chro. 11. 21. And they add farther, that David had six
wives before Nathan came to him, 2 Samuel 3. 13. then the Lord said unto him, 2 Samuel 12. 8. if that had been too little for thee, I would have overmore given
thee such and such things; the word is twice repeated here [ Cahenna ve
cahenna] (...)
quot illae quot illae, twelve more make in all these eightteene wives which
David might have had; and the Targum paraphraseth that place, Deuteronomy. 17. 17. Ne
multiplicet ^xores ultra octodecem, ne depravent cor ejus; and Solomon Iarchi
upon Deuteronomy. 17. he shall not multiply wives above eighteen, because we find
that David the King had but eighteen wives. Ye see upon what a sandy ground
they build this: they say that David and Rehoboam brake not this commandment,
because they contained themselves within the number of eighteen; but Solomon
who exceeded the number, he brake the commandment.

To multiply wives was altogether against the law; Multiplying of wives was
against the Law.
for they two shall be one flesh, binds him as well that sits upon the
throne, as him that draws the water and heweth the wood: but this to multiply
horses and gold, is but secundum quid against the Law; that is, it is not
Multiplying of horses not altogether against the Law.
simply forbidden, but only for unnecessary uses, and to put their trust in
them; but to enable them for the defense of their Country, and benefit of the
Estate; that is not forbidden.

CHAPTER VIII. A comparison betwixt Salomons Kingdom and Christ's.
PSALM. 89. 2. His throne shall be established as the Moon, and shall endure as
the Sun before me.
DAVID prayed for his son Solomon, that the Lord would give his Judgments to
the King, and he compares his Kingdom to the Moon; Solomon Kingdom compared
to the Moon.
for as the Moon borrows her light from the Sun, so he beggeth of the
Lord, that he would give light to Solomon to direct him: and as Astrologians
observe, that when the Moon is joined with a bad Planet, then her influence is
bad; but when she is joined with a good Planet, then her influence is good; so
Solomon in his Government when he was joined to Idolatry, and strange women,
then there was a bad influence upon his Government; but when he took the
direction from the Lord, then his Kingdom flourished. Plinius de Gemmis.
There is a stone in Arabia called Selenites, which grows with the Moon,
Salomons Kingdom, as long as he got light from the Lord it waxed; but when he
turned once from the Lord, it decayed daily. Last, it was like the Moon, the
Moon in twenty eight days finisheth her course, fourteen days to the full,
and fourteen to the wane; so from Abraham Salomons kingdom like the Moon in
waxing and waning.
to Solomon fourteen generations, then the Moon was at the full; then from
the end of Salomons days until Zedekiah were fourteen generations; and then
his Kingdom decayed and waned.

Solomon the King when he judged Israel he sat in a throne, 1 King. 10. 18. and
the King made a great throne of Ivorie, and overlaid it with the best gold; the
throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind, and it stood
in the porch of Judgment where he judged the people, 1 King. 7. 7. and there
were stays in each side in the place of the seat, and two Lions stood behind
the stays, and twelve Lions stood there, six The difference betwixt Salomons
throne of Ivorie and the brazen scaffold.
on the one side and six upon the other upon the six steps, and there was
not the like made in any Kingdom, 2 Chronicles. 9. 17. This throne of Solomon was
called Solium Domini, because he judged the Lords judgment there; and it
differed from that pillar which stood in the Temple, for that was a pulpit in
which they read the Law, 2 Chro. 6. 13. and it was called [ Cijor] but this

There were six Lions upon the one side as he went What the Lions signified on

up to his throne, and six upon the other, a Lion at every step; these Lions
on every side signified that all the twelve tribes were subject to Solomon, and
acknowledged him as their King; and the two Lions which stood before the stays
signified, that the two tribes Judah and Benjamin should not depart from
Solomon, but continue with him, and his posterity, to be stays to uphold his
Kingdom; which was signified by the garment of Ahija the Shilonite, rent in
twelve p^ices, ten were given to Jeroboam, and two only left to Rehoboam

degrees, from justice to have a care of religion; and as the Jews had Psalmos
graduum, Psalms of degrees which they sang when they ascended to the Temple;
so these were admonitiones graduum, that he should not pervert justice, that he
should abstain from Idolatry, that he should not plant a grove, nor erect a
pillar for Idolatrous worship, and that he should not sacrifice to Idols. The

Now let us compare Solomon with Christ; A comparison betwixt Solomon and
Christ.


First, in their name, Solomon was jejidia, beloved of

Secondly, in his anointing, Solomon was only anointed, Ioh. 1. 16. and are
made coheires with him, Romans 8. 17. in his Kingdom; here is a greater than
Solomon.

Thirdly, Solomon was crowned his Father being alive, Leo and catulus Leonis,
the Lion and the Lions whelp; so Christ thought it not robbery to be equal
with the Father, and to reign with him, Phil. 2. 6. here is a greater than
Solomon.

Fourthly, Solomon was obedient to his Parents, so Ioh. 8. 49. I honor my

Parents, Luke 2. 51. Here is a greater than Solomon.

Fifthly, by Salomons marriage, friendship was made up Egypt and Israel; but
Christ marrying his Church, friendship is made up betwixt God and man; here is

Sixthly, in the extent of his Kingdom, Salomons Kingdom Euphrates; but
Christ's Kingdom reaches to the ends of the earth, Psalm. 2. 8. I will give
thee the ends of the earth for a possession; here is a greater than Solomon.

Solomon exceeded all the Princes of the world in riches; in Christ are hid all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, Col. 2. 3. here is a greater than
Solomon.

Altar; Solomon offered an hundredth thousand Bullockes; but Christ offered a
greater Sacrifice, even himself upon the Cross; here is a greater than
Solomon.

The Kings of the earth were subject unto him, but Revel. 17. 14. had written
upon the hemme of his garment, Rex regum, and Dominus dominantium, the lowest
thing which is in Christ, is above all the Princes of the earth; here is a
greater than Solomon.

When Solomon went to the Temple, he had four and twenty thousand to guard
him with their Targets out of Libanus, 1 Chro. 27. 1. and 2 Chro. 11. 12. and
when he went to bed, he had threescore valiant men about him of the valiant of
Israel, Cant. 3. 7. But Christ has ten thousand times ten thousand, and
thousands of thousands of Angels attending him, Revel. 5. 11. here is a greater
than Solomon.

Let us compare them in their wisdom, Solomon Christ and Solomon compared in
wisdom.

the thing was done in the night, there were no witnesses, no probable

Lastly, all the earth shall be blessed in Solomon. When the Jews bless any
man, they pray for him after this manner, Beneficus sit tibi Deus ac liberalis,
ut praestitit se erga servum suum Salomonem, this was but fulfilled in type in
Solomon; but the truth was fulfilled in Christ, Esa. 65. 16. He who blesses
himself on the earth, shall bless himself in the God of truth: and he
concludes this Psalm for Solomon, Amen, Amen, Psalm. 72. 19. Solomon was not

might he have been thought to have been a reprobate or not?

He cannot be thought to be a reprobate; for first,

He was the Penman of the Holy Ghost, and they were Luke 1. 70. As he spoke by
his holy Prophets.

The Lord heard Salomons prayer, and accepted of his King 3. 6. which he never
did in any oblation of the wicked, Esaias 1. 11. 12. 13. so Ioh. 9. 31. We See
Pro. 15. 8.
know that God hears not sinners, that is, Impenitent sinners.

Thirdly, He is set down as an example of Imitation, Chro. 11. 17. Rehoboam in
the first three years of his Reign followed the footsteps of David and
Solomon; hence it follows, that Solomon being set down as an example Solomon
set down as an example of good.
of Imitation for good, that he died a penitent and reconciled to God; and as
the evil beginnings of Manasseh, discommended the evil end of Ammon; so the
good beginnings of Rehoboam, commended the good end of Solomon.

When the Kings of Judah and Israel are set down for Rules to be observed
concerning examples.
examples, these Rules are to be observed.

First, when the wicked father lives in his sins, and King. 15. 9. Zachariah
is said to have done that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his
fathers had done; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of
Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

Secondly, when the wicked King repents him of King. 21. 20. it is said of
Ammon, that he walked in all the ways that his father Manasseh walked in, and
served Idols which his father Manasseh served; This is to be understood only
of Manassehs first days, and not of his last days, when he repented him of
his wickedness.

Thirdly, when a bad King repented him of his wickedness, Chron. 11. 17.
Rehoboam in the first three years of his Reign followed the footsteps of
David and Solomon.

Fourthly, If the beginning of a King be good, and his Asa began well, yet
because he fell away, 2 Chronicles. 10. 10. therefore good Iehosaphat is never said
to walk in his ways. And the Lord gives the reason of this, Ezekiel. 16. 24.
When a righte^us man turns away from his righteousness* and commits
iniquity, his former righteousness shall be no more remembered. And again,
when the wicked turns away from his wickedness, and does that which is
lawful and right, he shall live.

Solomon is censured by the Holy Ghost, not that he had utterly forsaken God,
but that he went not fully after the Lord; or that his heart was not perfect as
was the heart of David his father.

The Conclusion of this is; Salomons Kingdom flourished Iakin or Bognaz to
uphold a Kingdom; otherwise it will stand but upon brickle feet of iron and
clay, as Nebuchadnezzars Image did, Dan. 2. 33.

CHAPTER IX. Whether Rahab was a betrayer of the City of Jericho or not?
JOSH 21. And the Spies came into an Harlots house, named Rahab, and lodged
there, etc.
IT may be said against Rahab, first that she was an Things objected against
Rahab for receiving the Spies.
Harlot, and therefore no marvel that she was so ready to betray the City in
which she was borne, receiving the Spies into her house.

Secondly, when the King sent unto her, she answered him not as a dutiful
Subject ought to have done, but hid the Spies in her house, and let them down
by a Cord through the window, and taught them how to escape, and when the
Searchers came to seek them, she said, she knew not what men they were, or
whither they were gone; whereas in the mean time, she had brought them up to
the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of Flax, which she had
laid upon the roof in order, Josh. 2. 6.

But it may be said in defense of Rahab, that the knowledge

bonds of nature.
rather establishes it, 1 Pet. 2. 5. Fear God and obey the King: a King and
his Subjects are Infidels, some of his Subjects are converted to the faith, as
it fell out in the Apostles days, that the Emperors remaining Infidels, yet
sundry of their Subjects were converted to the Christian faith. Did their
Christianity loose the bond of obedience which they ought to their Emperor?
God forbid; but confirmed it rather, therefore the Apostle wills to make all
sort of supplication for them, 1 Timothy 2. 1.

But Rahab was free from the crime of treason, for Rahab was free of treason.
first God revealed unto her, that the Israelites were to take this City, and
destroy it. Secondly, she knew that whether she had discovered the Spies, or
hid them, yet the City should be destroyed: wherefore it was best for her in
the destruction of the Kingdom which she could not save, to save her self,
and her own household; and here she conformed her will to the will of GOD; and
as he is no traitor, who yields an Hold to the Prince of the Land, although
it be contrary to the will of him, who has commandment over the Hold: so when
Rahab yielded the City to the Lord, contrary to the will of the Inhabitants of
Jericho, she is not be reputed Heber made a covenant with the Canaanites and

God; now there was wars betwixt the Israelites and the Canaanites; Sisera the
Canaanite flies into the tent of Iael the wife of Heber the Kenite; What shall
she do in such a case? If she kill Sisera, then she breaks her covenant with
the Canaanites; and if she let Sisera go f^ee, then she will fight against the
people of God, and destroy them; here her wisdom teaches her what to do,

of Tyrus, 2 Samuel 5. 11. 1 King. 5. 12. of whom it is said, he made this
covenant with them, according to the wisdom which God had given him. So
Christ sought water of the woman of Samaria, and David fled to the King of Gath
for a refuge. Secondly, there were the A^monites and the Moabites, Deuteronomy. 23. 6.
Ye shall not seek their prosperity all your days; that is, ye shall not
enter into covenant of friendship with them, but yet Deuteronomy. 2. 19. they are
forbidden to make war against them. And so the seven Nations they were not to

there were the Amalekites, and these they were utterly to destroy.

one of the seven Nations who were to be destroyed; for that law, that the
seven Nations should be destroyed, should be interpreted by another law, to
wit, they were to be destroyed, unless they had submitted themselves, and
became tributaries unto the people of God, Deuteronomy. 20. 10. When thou come nigh
a City to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it; and it shall be, if
it make the answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be that all the

to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bond service unto this
day. And it was the people of the seven Nations, who hardened their hearts, with
whom Joshua took not peace, Josh. 11. 19. 20.

When the Gibeonites came to Joshua, if they had told him the truth, that they
were a people that dwelt amongst them, and that they came not from a far
Country, but were Canaanites indeed, and came to seek their peace, (which
they did not for fear) then Joshua was bound to have spared their lives upon
their submission: and whereas the men of Israel said then, Peradventure ye
dwell among us, and how shall we make a league with you? Josh. 9. 7. The
meaning is, we cannot make sociale faedus vobiscum, but only deditionis, that
is, Faedus

posterity of Saul would not have been punished for the breach of this oath.
Ambrose says well, Pacem quam dederant non censuerant revocandam, quia firmata

that is, they held that it was not lawful to break the oath that was made,

saved; and they who went out of it, should be killed: so there is no salvation
to those who are without the Church, which is marked with the blood of Christ,
Act. 2. 47. Rahab being the first fruits of the Gentiles, implied that the
Gentiles should be received into the Church, and be saved.

CHAPTER X. Whether the Kingdom of Judah or Israel were the best Government?
IT may seem at the first, that the Kings of Israel did more formally proceed
by way of Justice, than the The Kings of Israel proceeded by way of Justice
formally.
Kings of Judah did; the Kings of Israel did not proceed by way of arbitrary
Justice, neither was there any peremptory execution upon the will of the King.
When Naboth was to be stoned to death, the matter was handled after a judicial
form, which might have given satisfaction to the ignorant people, who knew not
the device and secrecy of the matter.

But the Kings of Judah proceeded by their absolute The Kings of Judah

Solomon, he seems most unjustly to have What things objected to Solomon.

secondly, his father loved him most dearly; thirdly, he never did find^ fault

brother did affect the Kingdom, yet notwithstanding he lovingly embraced him,
and dissuaded him from that course; and Seneca writes of the like in his first
book of Clemency, cap. 9. how Augustus spared Cinna, and made him of a foe a
friend.

But if we shall consider that the Kings of Judah, especially David and Solomon
Prophets.
David and Solomon being directed by the spirit of God immediately, had a
better warrant to proceed by their sole authority, than the Kings of Israel
had, we David in killing the Amalekite sinned not.
shall be of another mind: and where it is objected, that David killed the
Amal^kite only upon his own confession; the confession out of ones own
mouth, if When one may be condemned upon his own confession.
it be the confession of one that is well at himself, and is not weary of his
life, and if he stand constantly at it, then the confession out of his own
mouth is sufficient, Luke 19. 22. Wicked servant, out of thine own mouth will
I judge thee. Secondly, this Amalekite gloried that he had killed Saul, and so
flattered David: and lastly, he was an Amalekite, against whom the Lord had
given out sentence long before, that they should all be killed with the sword,
and the Lord was wroth with Saul for sparing the Amalekites.

The second thing objected to David, is the breaking David brake not his oath
in causing Shimei to be killed.
of his oath in causing Shimei to be killed, when he had sworn that nothing
should befall him; but it was not for his former railing that he was put to
death, but for his new transgression; David says to his son Solomon, Habes
apud te, 2 Samuel 28. that is, confine him, and suffer him not to go abroad; for
he is a mighty man, and is able to gather together a thousand of Benjamin, 2 Samuel 19. 17. therefore Solomon makes him to swear that he should never go
beyond the brook Kedron under the pain of death, and he most willingly
assented unto it, yet he brake his oath and went to seek his fugitive servant,
and for the breach of this oath, David commands to p^t him to death, and
Solomon caused to execute him, and after his first transgression, he is kept in
ward here, and he is like a fish taken upon the hook, but yet

But Solomon lays to his charge that sin which was King. 2. 42. thou know
what thou did to my Father David.

Both David and Solomon pardoned this sin but Shimei had his former fault
pardoned conditionally.
and even as an old Cicatrix being healed, if it get a new blow, is more
dangerous than any other wound; so a fault pardoned, if the man fall into sin
again aggravateth the sin more; he was pardoned conditionally only, that he
should not transgress again.

But it may seem too great a punishment for so small

and he bound himself by an oath, if he did transgress.

As for the killing of Ioab, all the commendations set David sinned not in

Ishbosheth to David again, only for his own advancement: so would Ioab have
Adonijah to have the Kingdom, hoping thereby to get preferment to himself;
therefore he was not to be reckoned amongst the loyal and faithful Subjects
of the King.

And whereas the virtues are reckoned up, we shall find more vices than
virtues in him; first we shall see him delight to see one kill another, which
he thought He delighted to see men kill others.

but would have them, as Christ would have his Disciples, not to seek fire

Now for Salomons killing of Adonijah, we must not Solomon sinned not in

Solomon for Adonijahs second transgression justly caused to execute him, and we
are not to measure his heavenly wisdom by the moral virtues which are found

he sought Abishaig only for that end, that he might get the Kingdom.
Secondly, he says, that the Kingdom belongs still to him; he was not like
good Jonathan, who willingly gave way to Gods ordinance, he knew well that the
Lord had appointed the Kingdom for Solomon, 2 Samuel 7. The son which shall
come out of thy loins, shall build thy house, and succeed in the Kingdom:
this was spoken after all his other sons were borne, and this aggravated all
the rest of his sins, that he affected the Kingdom, his father being yet
alive, and although his father was decrepit, yet he ruled by his Counselors,
and he was not weak in mind now although in body.

Wherefore we may conclude, the Kingdom of Judah to be the best government,
and still to be preferred before the Kingdom of Israel.

CHAPTER XI. Whether the Jews might choose Herod for their King or not?

Those Proselytes who were converted to the faith, and continued in the faith

Herod for their King: First, because he was an Idumean their brother;
secondly, because he was the son of Parents who were Proselytes, Antipar and
Antipas both Proselytes: Thirdly, he himself was a Jew by profession, and
standing in the third generation, therefore he might enter into the
Congregation, and they might choose him for their King. Herodiani certain
wicked Jews took Herod for their Messiah, now if Herod had not been

Sometimes again it is taken more strictly for those Jews who dwelt on the
west side of Jordan, and they were called Iudaei Hierosolymitani, the Jews
that dwelt about Jerusalem, Luke 3. 1. Pilate was governor of Judah, and Herod
of Galilie; Judah here is strictly taken; but sometimes Herod is called King of
the Jews, here it is largely taken, Mat. 2. 1.

So the name [ Gentile] is taken sometime strictly, as The name ( Gentile)

Paul applies it to the converted Gentiles, Galat. 2. 12. but when Christ
said, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, Mat. 10. 5. Here it is taken

But Josephus calls Herod but a private man, Lib. 14 cap. 11. etc. 17
fore it may seem that the Jews never acknowledged Herod for their King, and
the Jews said of Herod, Quod non est rex, neque filius regis.

The reason why he was called a private man was this, Why Herod was called a
private man.
for at that time the posterity of David carried no sway amongst the people,
but only the posterity of the Priests, and whosoever were not Priests, were
called [ Gnim haaretz] (...) Populus terrae.

because Herod's father, and grandfather were not altogether strangers from the
people of God (for they were Edomites and Proselytes) therefore he was not
reckoned as a stranger: but it fell out amongst the Jews, as it did amongst
the Romans and Athenians, that those who were (...), and adscriptitij, were
always hated of those who were natural and inbred Citizens: So the Jews
hated those who were Proselytes, because of the old hatred that was betwixt the
Jews and the Gentiles; and they made a Canon amongst them, Vt caverent sibi in
decimam generationem a Proselytis.

We may conclude this point then, that the Jews Herod for their King now,
being a Jew by profession, and descended of Parents who were Jews by
profession: and the latter Jews distinguished not well betwixt Ger and Goi,
who reckoned Herod ever to be a stranger.

CHAPTER XII. Whether Ishbosheth was a Rebel in affecting the Kingdom or not?
2 Samuel 2. 8. But Abner the son of Ner, Captain of Saul's Host, took
Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim, and he made him

have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall.

Secondly, Ishbosheth had the consent almost of all the people, for eleven
tribes acknowledged him for their King.

Thirdly, he had good success amongst his Subjects; The success that
Ishbosheth had.
first, in Mahanaim; then amongst the Giliadites; thirdly, amongst the
Ashurites; fourthly, in Izreel; fifthly, in Judah and Benjamin; and lastly, over
all Israel, 2 Samuel 2. 9.

Fourthly, he reigned seven years amongst them, and by that it may seem, that
it was a settled Kingdom.

The thing that may be alleged against him is this, Mephibosheth was the son
of the eldest brother, and therefore by right should have succeeded before him.
But Mephibosheth was a lame man, and an impotent creature, and was not fit for
Government, and therefore by right the Kingdom succeeded to Ishbosheth. David
was appointed King by the Lord, we may say, that Ishbosheth knew nothing of
this, and he was in bonafide: and moreover, David calls him a righteous
person, 2 Samuel 4. 9. therefore it may seem that he did not usurp or affect
the Kingdom wrongfully.

Now let us compare Ishbosheths affecting of the Kingdom, Ishbosheth compared
with Jeroboam in affecting the Kingdom.
and Ieroboams affecting of the Kingdom; Jeroboam had the word of the Lord by
Ahija the Prophet that he should be King, and he confirmed it unto him by a
sign, in renting of the Cloak in twelve pieces, thus much he had from the
Lord; but he was a wicked and profane man, and got the hearts of the people
rather by coffeehouse and mutiny than by hearty good will, and herein
Ishbosheth far exceeded him.

Again, Ieroboams affecting of the Kingdom might seem to be a revenge; for
he fled away to Egypt from Solomon as a traitor, and now to be revenged upon
his son, he draws away the ten Tribes from him, and so Ishbosheths entering
to the Kingdom seems to be better than his.

Ishbosheth notwithstanding of all that is said for him Ishbosheth cannot be
excused for affecting the Kingdom.
God to change this form sometimes, as David was chosen King and not his
eldest brother, and so was Solomon chosen and not Adonijah. And if it had come
by succession, then Mephibosheth should have succeeded and been preferred
before him, for although he was lame in his feet, yet he was not lame in his
mind. And where it is said, that he had the consent of all the people, their
consent is nothing without the consent of the superior God himself, by me

reign, but that David should reign, and Jonathan gave way to it, therefore
he could not be ignorant of this, but being blinded by presumption, and misled
by crafty Abner (who thought in effect to be King himself) he affected the
Kingdom. And whereas David calls him a righteous person; we must distinguish
inter justitiam Iustitia
causae. personae.

causae, and justitiam personae, betwixt the righteousness of his cause, and
the righteousness of his person, although he was otherwise a good man, yet he
had not a good cause in hand; and if we shall join his cause and his death
together, we may think that it was a just punishment of his Rebellion; for he
was murdered by Baanah and Rechab upon his bed in his bedchamber, 2 Samuel 4. 7.

The conclusion of this is; He that affects Gods Fear God, honor the King.
1 Pet. 2. 17.

CHAPTER XIII. Whether it was lawful for the Jews to pay tribue to Caesar or
not?
MAT. 22. 17. Tell us therefore, what think thou? Is it lawful to pay
tribute to Caesar?
THe Jews who were a people always subject to The Jews a people prone to
rebellion.
rebellion and mutiny, propounded this question to Christ, Is it lawful for
us to pay tribute to Caesar or not? As if they should say, we have always
been a The speech of the Jews in defense of their liberty.
free people, to whom many Nations have paid tribute; we are a people who are
commanded to pay our tithes and first fruits only to the Lord. The Lord
commanded us to choose a King of our selves and not a stranger, Deuteronomy. 17. How
shall we then pay to Caesar who is but a stranger? Caesar has taken us
violently, and made us captives, and daily his Publicans most unjustly oppress
us; how then shall we pay tribute to him? and shall we give him this penny
which has an Image upon it, contrary to the law of God which forbids
Images? And when we pay this ways head by head this penny to him, it makes
the Romans insult over us, as if we were negligent of the worship of our God,
and worshippers of a false God. Who can abide to see how these Romans have
abused, and do still abuse the Temple of God? And how Pompey and Crassus have
robbed the Temple? And how they exact of us that penny that should be paid
only to the Lord? And if any Nation in the world have a privilege to free
themselves from the slavery and bondage of strangers, most of all have we
Jews, who are Gods* peculiar people; and we would gladly know, Master, what is
thy judgment in this case, and we will stand to thy determination; if thou bid
us give it, we will give it; but if thou forbid us, we will stand to our
liberty, and vindicate our selves, as the Macchabees our Predecessors have
done. The Herodians The Pharisees with the Herodians sought to entrap Christ.
came here with the Pharisees to Christ, waiting what word might fall from him;
If Christ should have answered any thing contrary to the Roman power, then
the Herodians would have fallen upon him; or if he had said at the first, give
this tribute to Caesar, then the Jews would have fallen upon him, as an enemy
to their liberty. So they think to ensnare him what way soever he answered.
But the Lord who catches the crafty in their own craft, does neither answer
affirmatively nor negatiuely, but says, Why tempt ye me? show me a penny, and
he asked them, whose Image and superscription is upon the penny? they say
Caesar; then our Lord infers, that they were bound to pay it unto Caesar.
And Christ reasoned thus; Those which are Caesar's, and belong not unto God,
should be given to Caesar; but this penny is such; therefore it should be given
to Caesar. The Assumption is proved, because tribute belongs to the
Conqueror, and he coyneth the money, and puts his Image upon it, in token
of his Dominion over the Subjects, and they should pay it unto him as a token
of their subjection.

Show me a penny. This was not the penny which was commanded to be paid to the
Lord yearly.

The Jews paid a threefold half shekell to the Lord. The Jews under the Law
paid a threefold half shekell.
The first was called Argentum animarum, Exodus 30. 2. which every one paid for
the redemption of his life. The second was Argentum transeunt is, that is, the
half shekell which they paid to the Lord, when they were numbered head by
head, 2 King. 12. 5. The third was that half shekell which they offered freely
unto the Lord. This half shekell had Aarons rod upon the one side, and the pot
with Manna upon the other; and when they were under the Romans, or captives
under any other foreign Princes, the Masters of their Synagogues used to
gather this half shekell of them yea^ely, and send it to Jerusalem to the high
Priest. This was not the penny which Caesar craved of them, for it had Caesar's
Image This tribu^e which Caesar ^xact^^ wa^ not the h^^^e sh^^el^ which was du^
to the Lord.
and superscription upon it. Neither would the Lord have bidden them give that
to Caesar, which was due to God.

This Didrachma which they paid to Caesar was as much in value, as the half
shekell; and Christ himself although he was free and the Kings son, yet he
paid Christ paid this tribute.
it for himself and for Peter, Mat. 17. 27. And so Mary when Christ was in her
womb went to Bethlehem to pay this tribute to Caesar. Luke 2. 5.

This Image set upon Caesar's money was not contrary to that, thou shall not
make to thy self any graven Image; for it was not made for a religious use,
but for a civil use.

This penny which Caesar exacted of the Jews was but Denarius, (Denarius,
Didrachma, and Numisma, were Denarius what.
all one) this Denarius was the ordinary hire of a workman for a day, Mat. 20.
2. and the daily wages of a Soldier, as Tacitus says. What if the Roman
Emperor had exacted as much of them as Pharaoh did of their Predecessors? What
if he had done to them as Solomon did to their Predecessors in his old age? or
as Rehoboam did to them, whose little finger was heavier than his fathers
loins? What ingratitude was this for them to grudge for paying so little a
tribute to the Emperor C^sar was more mild to the Jews than Pharaoh or
Rehoboam.
who kept them in peace, who kept Legions, and Garrisons of Soldiers, to
defend them from the Arabians and Parthians? he did not make them to work in
brick and clay, as the Egyptians did their predecessors, neither took he
their liberties from them; he permitted them to keep their Sabboths,
Circumcision, and their Synedria, their Synagogues, and (...); and He permitted
them to use their liberties.
Dion testifies of Augustus, that when he gave commandment to take tribute of
the Jews, that it should not be taken from them upon their Sabbath, but they
should delay it till the next day. Now for all these benefits had they not
reason to pay this tribute to Caesar?

Men may defend themselves and stand for their liberty, Men should not repine
after they are become subject.
but when they are once conquered, no place to repine. Agrippa (as Josephus
testifies) in his speech to the Jews, who were called Zelotae for their
preposterous desire that they had to free themselves from subjection to the
Romans, said unto them after this manner, Intempestivum est nunc libertatem
concupiscere, olim ne ea amitteretur, certatim opo^tuit; nam servitutis
periculum facere, derum est; and ne id subeatur, honesta certatio est, at qui
semel subactus, despicit; non libertatis amans d^cendus est, sed servus
contumax; that is, it is out of time now to desire your liberty, ye should
have rather long since striven not to have lost it; for it is a hard thing to
undergo servitude, and it is a lawful strife to withstand it; but when a man
is once overcome and yielded himself, and then rebelleth, he is not said to be
a lover of his liberty, but to be a rebellious subject. And Josephus says, Qui
victi sunt and longo tempore paruerunt, si jugum rejecerint, faciunt quod
desperatorum hominum est, and non quod libertatis amantium est, those who are
once overcome and have served a long time, if they shake off the yoke, they
play the part of desperate men, and not of those who love their liberty.

Now let us conclude this; give unto God that which Caesar that which is
Caesar, Math. 22. Homo est nummus Dei, because he carries Gods Image, Man is
Gods penny stamped with his Image.
give to him that penny which was lost, Luke 16. Light the Candle, sweep the
house, find it out, and give to him: and give unto Caesar that which is
Caesar's. Pro. 24. 21. Fear God and honor the King. Give not divine honor to
the King, as the Herodians did, who cried the voice of God and not of man. Say
not, Divisum Imperium cum Jove Caesar habet, neither under pretext of Religion,
withdraw that from the King which is due unto him, as the Essaeni did, and the
Pharisees would have done, but keep an equal midst betwixt them both, and
remove not the ancient marks, Prove. 23. 10.

CHAPTER XIIII. Whether Naboth might have justly denied to sell his Vineyard to
Ahab, or not?
1 King 21. 3. And Naboth said to Ahab, the Lord forbid it me, that I should
give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
NABOTH justly refused to sell his Vineyard to Ahab, it being his fathers
inheritance; no man in Israel might sell his inheritance, because the
Israelites were but the Lords (...), or Farmers, the inheritance was the Lords,
Levit. 25. 23. the Land shall not The Israelites might not sell their land
simply.
be sold for ever, for the Land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners
with me; therefore it was called Emmanuels Land, Esaias 8. 8. All that the
Israelites might do was this, they might morgage their land, but simply they
might not sell it, because the Inheritance was the Lords.

But it may be said Iere. 32. 9. I bought the field of Hanameel my Uncles son
that was in Anathoth, and I weighed him the money for it, even seventeene
shekels of silver.

By the little price which Jeremiah gave for this field Anathoth (being but
seventeene shekels) it may be gathered that this was not a simple alienatio^ of
the ground, Hanam^el did not sell his land, but morgaged it to Jeremiah.
but only a morgaging of it; wherefore his uncle or his uncles children might
have redeemed this land from Jeremiah, and Jeremiah was bound to have restored
this Land to them again: neither does the public writing of this Instrument
prove the selling of the Land simply, and the full dominion of it, but utile
dominium for the time, as he who has a piece of Land in morgage, may morgage
it again to another, but not simply sell it.

But it may be said, that David bought the inheritance Moriah from Arauna the
Iebusite, therefore the simple right of the ground might be sold.

It was permitted to the Jews to sell a house within What houses or land the
Jews might sell.
unto it; but they might not sell their grounds and Vineyards, neither the
houses nor the villages which have no walls round about them, for they were
reckoned as the fields in the Country. Secondly, this Hill Moria which was
sold, was sold by a Iebusite, and not by an Israelite; and the ceremonial
Laws of the Jews obliged not the Iebusites. Thirdly, this was an
extraordinary case, this ground was sold for the building of the Temple, and
David would not have it without a price.

It may be said, that the chief Priests took the thirty pieces of silver and
bought a Potters field with it to bury strangers in, Mat. 27. 7. therefore they
might sell a field, for they bought this field to bury strangers in it.

First, this field was not a fruitful field, but a place Joseph of Arimathea
being of another tribe than those of Jerusalem (for Arimathea, or Rama was in
the tribe of Ephraim; but a great part of Jerusalem, with Mount Calvarie and
Iesephs Garden, wherein he had his Tomb, was in the tribe of Benjamin) yet he
bought a Garden being near Jerusalem, and the Hill Calvarie, because it was a
thing which belonged to the house within the walled City.

If a man might not sell his inheritance in Israel, how Judah and Israel had
Orchards and Gardens, and places of burial proper to themselves, which was a
part of their peculium, or proper right.

The Kings might have Orchards and Gardens proper Naboth said well, God forbid
it me that I should sell my fathers inheritance: they were but usufructuarij,
but the Lord was Dominus fundi, and he that has no right to himself, cannot
make a right to another.

Why might they sell their houses within a walled City, and not their fields
and grounds in the Country? Levit. 25. 13.

The reason was this, they might not sell their grounds, The reason why they
might sell their houses within the walled Cities.
that their possessions might be kept still distinct; but because many came to
dwell in the walled Cities, and the houses were not so distinguished as the
grounds and Vineyards, therefore they might sell them: this was also done in
favor of the Proselytes, that they might have a dwelling amongst the people of
God*

The conclusion of this is; as the Israelites when they Canaan, yet because the
right is the Lords, it shall return to them in the year of that great Iubile.

CHAPTER XV. Whether the Jews should be tolerated in a Christian Commonwealth
or not?
ROMANS 11. 23. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
graffed in: for God is able to graffe them in again.
THere may be many reasons alleged, why this sort of people should not be
tolerated amongst Christians.

First, if ye respect their profession and Religion, they are to be secluded
from us Christians; and secondly, in respect of their dealing with us in their
civil contracts and bargaining.

As for their Religion. First, they detest us Christians who profess Christ,
for Christ's cause. Secondly, they hold many damnable and blasphemous opinions
concerning Christ; first, for his forerunner John the Baptist; secondly, they
hate Marie the Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ; thirdly, they oppose themselves
against Christ's natures; fourthly, against his Offices, King, Priest, and
Prophet; fifthly, against his death upon the cross; sixthly, against his
resurrection; seventhly, they oppose themselves to his imputed righteousness;
and lastly, to his Gospel, and they expect a glorious Messiah to come.

First, in detestation of Christ, they detest us Christians, they call us [
Goijm] Gentes and Edomites, and when (...) v^stavit.
they would welcome a Christian, they say welcome Shed, that is, Devil,
hinking that the common people The Jews detest Christians.
understand not the word; and they curse us Christians daily, anathema sit
externis in serpente, that is, they wish that we who are without their
society, may be execrable as the Serpent.

But they detest those most of all who are converted from Iudaisme to
Christianity, and they pray three times in the day against them, morning,
midday, and evening, and thus they pray, Ne sit quies Apostatis, neque spes.

Secondly, they expect Elias Tishbites to be the forerunner The Jews expect
Elias to come.
of their Messiah; and when they cannot resolve their hard questions to their
Scholars, they say, Tishbi solvet nodos, that is, when Elias Tishbites shall
come, he (...)
will resolve all doubts, but Elias is come already, and they have done to him
whatsoever they listed, Math. 17. 12.

They hate Marie the Mother of Christ, and they call her [ Mara] bitterness,
and the herb called Herba Mariae, by them is called Herba suspensi, because
Marie bare Christ, who was crucified upon the Cross: so a piece of money
called grossa Mariae, they called it in despite, grossa suspensi.

Then they deny the two natures of Christ, for they The Jews deny the two
natures of Christ.
deny his Godhead, inceptum est nomen Iehova profanari. Targum
Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth it thus, illi caeperunt idola colere, and
fecerunt sibi Deos erroneos, quod cognominabant de sermon domini, he
understands here blasphemously Christ, calling him Deum erroneum, whom the
Scripture call (...). Of old they said Deus sanctus and domus Iudicij ejus
fecerunt hominem, by the house of Judgment they meant the trinity of persons,
for all the inferior house of Judgment consisted of three, and they said Duorum
non est judicium, so the Chaldie paraphrast paraphraseth the trinity of
persons by this paraphrase; but now, the Jews do set themselves against this,
and they deny it flatly.

They set themselves against his offices; he was anointed The Jews set
themselves against the offices of Christ.
King, Priest, and Prophet [ Hameshiah] that excellent Prophet, but in
detestation of Christ, they will not call their Tardigradum, or slow-comming
Christ Messiah, but (...) delibutum, they hate so the name of Christ.

They mock the Kingly office of Christ, Mat. 27. 19. they put a crown of
thorns upon his head for a crown; and they put a reed in his hand for a
Scepter: So they mock his Priestly office, he saved others, let him save
himself, Verse. 40. and his Prophetical office, Prophecy thou O Christ, who
is he that smites thee. Mat. 26. 68.

So they mock his death, and his crucifying upon the Cross, they call Christ's
cross the Woofe and the Warpe, and so mystically when they speak one to
another amongst Christians, they call Christ the Woofe and the Warpe.

They deny the resurrection of Christ, Mat. 28. 15. and it is noysed abroad
amongst them unto this day, that Jesus Christ was stolen away by his Disciples,
and that he did not rise again.

So they oppose his imputed righteousness, and they say, that every fox must
pay his own skin to the flayer, and they say, sit mors mea expiatio cunctarum
transgressionum mearum.

And lastly they oppose themselves against his Gospel, they call (...) [ Aven
gilajon] nuntium vanum. (...)


Secondly, if ye will respect their dealing with us in civil matters: they are
worthy to be secluded from the society of Christians.

They care not to forswear themselves to us Christians, they are most
merciless usurers in exacting from the Christians, and they who profess
Physic amongst them, care not to poison Christians, whom they call [ Goijm,]
Gentiles.

And if we shall add further, that no false Religion should be tolerated, and
the Lord commanded heretics to be put to death, how then should they be
suffered in a Christian Commonwealth?

But we must put a difference betwixt these miscreants What Jews may be
suffered in a Commonwealth, and who not.
who rail against the Lord Jesus Christ, and blaspheme his name; and those
poor wretches who live in blindness yet, but do not rail blasphemously against
Christ; those we should pity: First, we should pity them for The reasons that
should move us to pity the Jews.
their fathers cause the Patriarchs. Secondly, we should pity them, because
Christ is come of them who is blessed for ever; thirdly, the Oracles of God
were committed to them, Romans 3. 2. and the law was the inheritance of Jacob,
Deuteronomy. 33. 4. they were faithful keepers of the same to others, and they were
like a lantern who held out the light to others, although they saw not with it
themselves. Fourthly, when we Gentiles were out of the Covenant they prayed for
us, Cant. 8. 8. We have a little sister, what shall we do for her? So when
they are out of the Covenant; We have an Elder brother, Luke 16. what shall we
do for him? And lastly, because of the hope of their conversion, that they
shall be graffed in again, Romans 11.

Some Christian Commonwealths admit them, but with these Caveats.

First, that they submit themselves to the positive

Secondly, that they rail not against Christ, and be

Thirdly, that they be not suffered to marry with the

Fourthly, that they be not permitted to exhaust Christians

Fifthly, that they be not admitted to any public these Caveats, sundry
Commonwealths have admitted them.

CHAPTER XVI. Of the Synedrion of the Jews.
MAT. 5. 22. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause, shall be in danger of the Judgment, and whosoever shall say
to his brother Raca, shall be in danger of the Council.
THis word, Synedrion, is a greek word, but changed and made a Syriack word,
(...), are sitters in judgment, and Sanhedrin, are the Judges who sat in the
Council, and the place it self was called Synedrion.

In the Syriack, Domus judiciorum, and Domus Iudicum The difference betwixt
Domus judiciorum and Domus Iudicum.
differunt: Domus judiciorum is the house where the Counselors met, and Domus
Iudicum according to the Syriack and Chaldy phrase, signifies the Judges
themselves. (...) Domus Iudicum.
So the Chaldees when they express the Trinity, they call it Domus Iudicij,
because there were three that sat in their lesser Iudicatorie; and when Beth
dina (...) Domus judicij.
signifies the Judges themselves, it has the point above judh, but when it
signifies the place of Judgment, it has the point under judh.

There were two sorts of these Synedria amongst the Jews, the great Council
and the lesser, the great Council was called Sanhedrin Gedolah, and the lesser
was called (...)
Sanhedrin Ketannah.

The great Synedrion sat at Jerusalem only, the lesser Synedria sat in other
places also, and they were called (...), judicia.

The great Synedrion sat in Jerusalem only, and Christ Allusion. Vide Guileli
Schickardum de jure regio, and Ludovie: de Dieu.
alludeth to this, Mat. 23. 37. A Prophet might not die out of Jerusalem. So, O
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the Prophets, Mat. 23. 37. The great
Synedrion judged only of a Prophet.

But Gabinius the Proconsul of Syria, divided this great The great Synedrion
divided into five parts.
Synedrion which sat only at Jerusalem into five parts, whereof he placed one
at Jerusalem, another in Gadara, the third in Amathus toward the red Sea, the
fourth in Jericho, and the fifth he placed in Sephra in Galilie. And Christ
meant of these Councels when he says, they will deliver you up to the
Councels, Mat. 10. 17. At this time the great Synedrion was divided into five
parts.

They shall deliver you up to the Councels, and they will scourge you in their
Synagogues; by their Synagogues he What meant by Synagogues and Councels.
meant their Ecclesiastical Iudicatories, and by the Councels their civil.

The number that sat in this great Iudicatorie were seventie and two, six
chosen out of every tribe; but for making the number round, they are called
Seventie: the Scripture uses sometimes when the number is not Rotundatio
numeri quid?
full, to express the full number, as Judge. 11. 5. Abimelech killed his
brethren which were threescore and ten persons, there were but threescore and
nine of them, for Iotham fled. So Genesis 42. 13. Thy servants are twelve
brethren, the sons of one man; although Joseph was thought to be dead, yet,
to make up the number, because he had once twelve sons, they are called the
twelve sons of Jacob. So Number. 14. 33. And your children shall wander in the
Wilderness forty years, according to the number of the days that the Spies
searched the Land; this was spoken to them two years after they came out of
Egypt; yet the number is made up here, and it is called forty years. So 1
Cor. 15. 5. He was seen of the twelve; there were but eleven of them at this
time, for Judas was dead, and Matthias was not chosen as yet; yet he calls
them twelve, because they were once twelve, to make up the number. Sometimes
again although there be more for making round the number, they take away some,
as Luke 10. 1. the Syriack has it, the seventie two Disciples, yet it is
translated the seventie Disciples. So the Seventie two who translated the
Bible, are called the Seventie.

The Lord charged Moses to gather Seventie of the Elders of Israel, Moses said,
how shall I do this? If I shall choose six out of every Tribe, then there
shall be sixty and two; and if I shall choose but five out of every Tribe, then
there will be ten wanting; and if I shall The uncertain conjecture of Sol:
Iarchi concerning their Election of the Seventie.
choose six out of one Tribe, and but five out of another Tribe, that will
breed but strife amongst them. What does he then? He made choice of six out of
every Tribe, and he brought forth seventie two blanke papers; upon seventie of
the papers, he wrote [ Zaken] (...) Senex.
senex; and upon the two that remained, he wrote [ Hhelek] pars. Now when the
Tribes drew their Lots (...) Pars.
out of the Box, he who drew [ Zaken] senex, Moses said unto him, Antea
sanctificavit te deus benedictus; but he who drew [ Hhelek] pars, he said unto
him, Non cupit te deus. The Hebrews say, that Eldad and Medad, Number. 11. 26.
were of those who were written, but they went not out into the Tabernacle,
because they drew [ Hhelek] pars; but not [ Zaken] senex, they were inter
conscriptos (say they) but not inter electos; and so the number seventie is
made up without them.

There were two Pr^sidents in this Council; the first Two Presidents in the
Council. (...) Princeps.

Synedrion sat but from the morning Sacrifice until the sixth hour, that is,
until our twelve; but the great Synedrion sat from the morning Sacrifice
until the evening Sacrifice, that is, until our three of the clock in the
afternoon.

The matters which they judged in this Iudicatorie, What matters were judged in
the great Synedrion.
were matters of greatest weight; as to judge of a false Prophet, when to make
wars, appointing Magistrates for inferior Cities; so for cutting off of a
Tribe, and punishing the high Priest, and whether an Apostate City should be
raised and cast down or not; and they say, that none might give the bitter
waters to the woman suspected of Adultery but this Iudicatorie, Number. 5. 29. So
they say, when a man was killed, and the killer not known, none might measure
from the place where the man was killed to the next City, Deuteronomy. 21. 7. but the
Elders of the great Synedrion, this case was only tried by them; So the

were tried by the great Synedrion.

alleges Deuteronomy. 17. 12. The man that does presumptuously, and will not hearken
unto the Priest, and to the Judge, even that man shall die. Here he says, the
Magistrate does only execute the sentence of the Priest.

But first, ex decreto judicis, is not in the original, but according to the
sentence of the Law, Deuteronomy. 17. 11. and the word should be read disjunctive, He
that hearkeneth not unto the Priest or unto the Judge, etc. And by the Priest
here is understood, not only the high Priest, but other Priests, Verse. 9. When
the high Priest and the Judges sat together, then he that hearkened not to the
sentence given by the Judge, and interpreted by the Priest, was to die; so he
who hearkened not unto the Judge, although the Priest was not there, was to
die; for these Iudicatories which are conjoined, are sometimes distinguished.

upon the seventie. Moses spirit of judgment was upon them all, but not his
other gifts; as Moses was mighty in words and deed, but not they. Moses was
the meckest man in the world, but not they. One Moses ruling in a Council will
make it famous, but to have seventie like Moses sitting in a Council, (for
they had the same spirit of ruling which Moses had) that made it to excel all
the Councels in the world, even Areopagus in Athens, and the Senate in Rome,
and if we shall mark the unity that was in this Council, then we shall more
admire it.

Whether had the Seventie this gift of Prophecy continually

They prophesied for a day, but no more; therefore Prophetarunt and non
addiderunt, i. e. prophetare; The seventy which Moses chose had not this gift
of Prophecy continually.
and so the phrase is used by the Hebrews, Genesis 8. 12. Non addidit redire, She
returned not again; so 1 Samuel 15. Non addidit Samuel redire ad Saulem, that
is, he saw him no more; so Prophetarunt et non addiderunt, that is, they
prophesied that day and no more.

The conclusion of this is, the Lord did sit here in the

CHAPTER XVII. Whether a Judge is bound to give sentence according to things
prooved and alleged, or according to his own private knowledge?
EXODUS 23 1. Thou shall not receive a report; put not thine hand with the wicked
to be an unrighteous witness.
Sundry do hold, that a Judge must not judge contrary The opinion of some
concerning the proceeding of a Judge secundu^ allegata and probata.
to that which he knows, whatsoever is alleged or proved to the contrary;
for whatsoever is not of faith is sin, Romans 14. 23. that is, if a man do a
thing against his conscience, it is sin; Wherefore, if a Judge know a man to
be innocent, and yet evidences be brought in against him that he is guilty;
then they hold that the Judge should use all means to free the innocent man;
as first, he should deal with the accuser not to proceed in his accusation,
and should signify unto him, that he knows well the innocence of the party.
Secondly, if this cannot help, then he is bound publicly to testify upon the
Bench, the innocence of the party, and he may defer the giving out of
sentence, unless he be charged by a superior; but if the matter have no
success that way, then he may remit him to a superior Judge, or will the
party accused to appeal to a superior Judge; but if he cannot prevail any
of these ways, some do will him rather to quite his place, than to give out
such a sentence against the innocent.

Although the light of nature it self, and the word of God both teach us, that
the life of the innocent is to be maintained; yet when another law of greater
force comes in, then this must give place; for reason it Why a Judge must
proceed according to things proved.
self teaches us, that a Judge is to proceed according to things proved,
otherwise justice could not be preserved, and the good of the whole, is to be
preferred before the good of a private man.

But it may be said, this is both against the law of nature,

To kill an innocent man accidentally, and besides his How a Judge sins in
giving out sentence against an innocent person.
this is not a sin to him; but if he should of purpose kill an innocent man,
that incked were a sin contrary to the law; and even as in just war, when
the victory cannot be had otherwise unless there be innocent men killed, as
well as the guilty, yet they may be safely killed, because the war is just
war, and secondly, because it is not their intention directly to kill the
innocent, but because otherwise the victory could not be obtained: So a Judge
is bound to proceed according to that which is proved, and if he kill the
innocent man, it is beside his intention; for his intention is here to do
justice, and not to kill the innocent, and he is bound to prefer the
universal good, before the particular.

But if he do so, shall he not be guilty, as Pilate was

Pilate was an unjust Judge, because he pronounced How Pilate sinned in giving
sentence against Christ.
might have been known Iuridice, because they were not (...), their
testimonies agreed not, as the Evangelist Mark says, Chap. 14. 59.

If a woman were proved to be the wife of Titius, Titius in his conscience
knows not to be his wife; although the Judge should command Titius to do the
duty of an husband to her, yet Titius should rather suffer any punishment,
than to perform that duty to her, because he knows her not to be his wife.
So etc.

Here we must distinguish betwixt that which is intrinsece malum, evil in the
own nature of it, and that which is but accidentally evil; to commit
whoredom is simply evil, but when the Judge condemns the innocent man whom
he knows to be innocent, he does not give out sentence against the man,
because he is innocent, (for that were simply sin) but because he is bound to
execute judgment; and here the Judge proceeds as a public person; but
Titius is a private person only, and therefore he is bound to do according to
his knowledge.

If a Judge should hear two men disputing, and one and he should conclude for
him that is heretical, yet I am not bound to follow his sentence.

A Judge when he condemns a man according to A Jud^e when he gi^th out
sentence upon (...) person, he (...) not al^^.
proposition is true, when it is false; and in matters ^^vine, he is not a
Judge as he is in the civil Court.

But if a Judge should be urged in his conscience, posed, is this an innocent
man or not?

As a Judge, he must answer that he is not innocent; The sentence of the Judge
is the sentence of public authority.
sentence of a Judge is the sentence of public authority, and when he judges
so, he does not against his conscience; and here we must distinguish betwixt
his speculatiue Scientia speculativa. Scientia practica.
and practick knowledge; although he be innocent according to private and
speculatiue knowledge, yet he is guilty according to the course of the Law and
public authority.

He that is innocent should not be condemned; this

This man is innocent in judicio speculativo, injudicio practico; A man
innocent inspeculatiue judgment and yet guilty in practical judgment.
but turn it this way, he that is guilty injudicio practico should die, but
this man is guilty in judicio practico; therefore he should die.

If a man should produce an Instrument privately to a Judge, a Judge could not
proceed upon this, because he saw such a thing, if it were not publicly
produced in Judgment; this knowledge which he has by the sight of this
Instrument privately, he had it not as a Judge, but as a private man. So etc.

Whether is the Executioner bound to execute the

pronounced by the Judge: but if he should know the sentence to be false which
is given out upon the innocent man, then he should absolutely refuse and say,
It is better to obey God than man, Act. 4. 19. He is bound to obey his
superior in a good cause, and in a doubtful cause; but not in that which he
knows altogether to be false.

But what if a Judge doubt in his conscience, in such a

Here he is not to give out sentence, for that which is not of faith is sin,
Romans 14. 23. That is, whatsoever he does against his conscience.

The conclusion of this is, seeing the sentence of

CHAPTER XVIII. An partus sequitur ventrem?
GENESIS 21. 10. Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the
bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.
GOD who is the God of order, and not of confusion, has debarred the children
from sundry privileges for their fathers sins.

First, if both the Parents were Heathen, the Lord secluded The children of
Heathen Parents were not admitted to the Covenant, until they became
Proselytes.
the children from the Covenant, and they were not circumcised, until they
became Proselytes, and they were not circumcised nomine Parentum, in the name
of their fathers, but when they embraced the faith and were converted.

Secondly, If both the Parents were Jews, and did not beget their children in
wedlock, then the children were secluded from the inheritance, Judge. 11. 2.
Thou shall not inherit with us, because thou art the son of a strange woman.

Thirdly, If an Israelite had married a bondwoman, then the children were
secluded from the inheritance, although their fathers were free; those who were
borne of Handmaids were always reputed servants; and God applied this to
Christ himself as he was man, Esaias 49. 5. I have called my servant from the
womb; so Esaias 42. 1. Behold my servant whom I uphold, my Elect in whom my
soul is well pleased. Marie called her self the Lords Christ as man was a
servant.
handmaide. Luke 1. 28. therefore Christ as man borne of Marie the hand-maide,
was a servant.

But ye will say, that things take their denomination

In Physical mixtures it is so, but it is not so in marriage; In Physical
mixtures, things take their denomination from the better part.
Schools, Conclusio sequitur deteriorem partem, if any of the premises be
particular, so is the conclusion.

The Doctors of the Jews propound this case, if a Heathenish captive woman
were taken in the Wars, she is converted and becomes a Proselyte; whether
should her child be judged to be a free man or not in Israel? And they
answer, that this child borne of this stranger, is not to be counted a free
man, Verum Senatus suo decreto Lustrari eum tantum curat, they cause only to
H. Melahh. 8. 9.
wash him, but they will not circumcise him, until he be able to make
confession of his faith, and become a Proselyte; and here they say, Partus
sequitur ventrem, if the mother had been a free woman, either before, or after
the birth amongst the Romans, the child was reputed to be free; but not so
amongst the people of the Jews. Wherefore the Judges in Israel willed all
true Israelites, not to match themselves unequally in degrees, for the disgrace
which it brought upon their children, making them incapable of freedom, and
unfit to be heirs.

The conclusion of this is: Difference betwixt the Judicial Law and the
Covenant of grace.
of the Covenant of grace above the Judicial Law; for if any of the Parents be
faithful, then the child is holy, 1 Cor. 7. 14. that is, he may be admitted
to the Covenant.

CHAPTER XIX. An error personae irritat contractum?
JOSH. 8. 18. And the children of Israel smote them not, because the Princes of
the Congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel.
IT may seem that Error personae irritat contractum, as if a man married one
woman in stead of another, the marriage is nullified.

I^ ^he error of the person make the contract null, Isaacs blessing, who
blessed Ia(...) in stead of Esau? and yet the blessing was effectual, (...)
what shall we think of Joshua's Covenant made (...)e Gibeonites, whom he took
to be strangers? and yet the Covenant stood firm and sure; and what shall we
say of Jacobs marriage with Leah in stead of Rachel? Here the marriage was not
irritat and made void, although there was an error in the person.

First, for Jacobs marriage with Leah in stead of Rachel, Jacob had not
afterward approved this marriage, Of Jacobs marriage with Leah.
and gone in unto her, and begotten children upon her, the marriage had been
void; but because he went in unto her, and begot children upon her, this error
was taken away.

Secondly, it may be answered for Isaacs blessing, in Of Isaacs blessing Jacob
in stead of Esau.
blessing Jacob in stead of Esau, and Joshua's Covenant made with the
Gibeonites. There were three who concurred here. First God; secondly, the
persons who craftily concurred here to deceive; and thirdly, the persons who
were deceived. In Isaacs blessing we have to consider; first God, who cannot
deceive, nor be deceived; In blessing of Jacob three persons concurred.
then Rebecca and Jacob, who craftily deceived; and thirdly, Isaac, who was
deceived. Now because it was Gods intention to give the blessing to Jacob,
therefore neither Jacobs craft, nor Isaacs error, could hinder the blessing;
Isaac gives the blessing ignorantly, but because it was according to Gods
intention and revealed will, who was the principal giver of the blessing,
therefore the blessing was effectual. So in the Covenant I^shua's Covenant
with the Gibeonites.
with the Gibeonites, the Lord commanded to offer peace to the seven Nations if
they would seek it, now in comes the deceit of the Gibeonites, and error of
Joshua who is deceived, yet because it was Gods chief intention, that those of
the seven Nations who sought peace should be saved; therefore the oath stood
firm, and the error in the person did not make it void; and the matter may
be cleared thus: the Lord forbids a brother to eat with a railer, a
drunkard, or an extortioner. Cor. 5. 11. but if a drunkard, or a railer, or an
ex^ortioner should come to the Table of the Lord, I am not to refuse to eat at
that Table, although the drunkard be there. The reason is, because this is not
my private Table, but the Lords banquet, and I expect the blessing only from
him in it, and the sins of the drunkard cannot hinder me; but if I should bid
such a one to my house to eat with me, then I should be guilty of their
sin. So the Covenant here is the Lords Covenant, and the deceiver is not able
to make it of no effect. But where the principal intention of the contracter
is deceit, and the person with whom the contract is made is deceived, then the
contract is nullified; as if a man When the error of the person makes the
contract of no effect.
should ignorantly buy a free man for a slave, here the free man should be
released, and error personae irritat contractum.

But ye will say, in all contracts God has an hand, error personae.

In the blessing betwixt Isaac and Jacob; and the contract Joshua and the
Gibeonites, God had set down his revealed will, what he was minded to do in
both of these; and therefore neither the error of Isaac, God had revealed his
will in the blessing of Jacob, and the sparing of the Gibeonites.
nor the deceit of Rebecca and Jacob made the blessing of no effect, so neither
in the contract betwixt Joshua and the Gibeonites. But the Lord forbids
fraudulent contracts in his Word, neither is it his intention that such
contracts should be made, therefore they are of no effect.

CHAPTER XX. That a Judge may give out sentence by the information of the false
witnesses, and yet be free.
2 SAMUEL 1. 16. And David said unto him, thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
mouth has testified against thee.
IN Judgment the principal part depends upon The chief part in judgment
depends upon the witnesses.
the witnesses, and if they testify an untruth, they make a wrong sentence to
proceed out of the mouth of a just Judge: David here gives out sentence
against the Amalekit^ it was a just sentence in respect of the Judge, because
he condemned him out of his own mouth, but a wrong sentence in respect of the
Amalekite, because he did not kill Saul, but bragged only that he had killed
him, for the Text says, that Saul killed himself, 1 Samuel 31. 5.

When the Grecians besieged Troy, Palamedes was killed there amongst the rest;
and when the Greeks had Troy, and taken Ship to return to Greece; Nauplius
the father of Palamedes (to be revenged upon the Greeks) took a Boat in a
dark night, and went into the Sea, and set up a Beaken upon a rock, which when
the Greeks did see, they took it to be the Harbor, and directed their Course
toward it, and so they run the most of their Ships upon the rocks, and
were cast away. We cannot say here, that the fault was in the Pilots, because
the Ships were cast away; but the fault was in false Nauplius, who held up a
wrong light unto them. So when a good Judge gives out a wrong sentence, the
fault is not in the Judge, but in the false witnesses, who hold up a false
light unto him, and therefore the Judge should labor to punish these false
witnesses, and to restore the party who is wronged to his right; and as
Telephus was healed by the spear that hurt him, so should they study to cure
the person whom they have wounded by their sentence.

If a Judge call two or three witnesses, that is the first A Judge must not
proceed without witness.
thing required of him in trial of the truth, nam testimonio unius non
proceditur, and one witness does not prove. There are three witnesses in heaven
to certify us of the truth, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost. And
there are three that bear witness to us in the earth of the remission of
sins, the Spirit, the water, and blood, 1 Ioh. 5. 7. 8. So in Indicatories of
the Church three witnesses are required, 2 Cor. 13. 1. This is the third time
that I am coming to you, in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every
word be established. So in the trial of civil causes, every thing was
established by the mouth of two or three witnesses. Deuteronomy. 21. 15.

Secondly, The Judge must call faithful witnesses; A Judge is to make choice
of faithful witnesses.
they are called faithful witnesses when they are reputed so in the common
estimation of men; Esaias 8. 2. And I took unto me faithful witnesses, Vriah
the Priest and Zechariah the son of Ierebechiah, Vriah was not a faithful
man, yet because he was so reputed amongst the people; therefore he is called a
faithful witness.

Thirdly, He must call witnesses who have both They must be eyewitnesses.

seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon etc.

Fourthly, They must be contestes, and their testimonies must be (...),
agreeing in one, Mark. 14. 56. Now if the Judge proceed this way, and the
sentence be false, it is not his fault, for by the mouth of two or three
witnesses every word shall be established, that is shall be holden for truth.

When a Judge demands of the witnesses, he asks them not (...), what
murder is. Secondly, he asks not of them, (...), the effects and consequents
of murder which follow it, as the guilt and punishment. Thirdly, (...), he
asks them whether it were casually or maliciously done. And fourthly, (...),
if they saw him kill such a man; this is the special thing that they require,
and if the Judge give out sentence this ways according to things proved, then
the blame lies not upon him if there be a wrong sentence pronounced.

It may be said, when a man takes a thing to be a

There is a greater uniformity required betwixt the secundum allegata et
probata, according to things alleged and proved.

CHAPTER XXI. Of one who killed in sudden passion.
2 SAMUEL 14. And thy hand maid had two sons, and they two strove together in
the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other and
slew him.
THere is a difference betwixt those things which Difference betwixt things
done in passion, and deliberately.
we do in sudden passion, and those things which are done deliberately:
those things which children, mad men, and beasts do, they are not said to be
done deliberately, they come not from the will, which is principium agendi;
possunt laedere, sed non injuria afficere.

Again, there is a difference betwixt violentum, coactum, Violentum. Coactum.
Non spontanetum. Voluntarium.
non spontaneum, and voluntarium. Violentum is that, which by outward force a
man is constrained to do, and here the will gives no consent at all: as when
they drew the Martyrs before their Idols, and put incense in their hands.
Coactum is that, when there is some external violence used to enforce and
compel a man to do such a thing, against which he stands out and resists
for a time, but yet in the end he yields for fear: as Origin did to
Idolatry. But non spontaneum is this, when it is partly with the will, and
partly against the will; Christ said unto Peter, Ioh. 21. 18. they shall carry
thee whither thou would not, meaning what death he should dye; It was partly
with Peter's will, and partly against his will, that he went to martyrdom.
Voluntarium, is that when the will gives full consent to do a thing.

When a man kills his neighbor in sudden passion he is not violently
drawn to this sin; neither is he compelled to this sin; prima principia
concupiscible et irascibile, sunt interna homini, and cannot be compelled: and
in this sense he who kills in sudden passion, is said to do it willingly;
but if we will respect the will as it is obnubilated with the perturbation of
anger for the time, he did it not willingly, but non sponte, which is a midst
betwixt sponte and invite. Peter said to Christ, Lord I will lay down my life
for thy sake, John 13. 3. no doubt he had an intention to dye with him when he
spoke these words; but they shall carry thee whither thou would not, here
he was not willing to dye; so that he was partly willing, and partly not
willing, he was not altogether willing, nor it was not altogether against his
will, but it was partly with his will, and partly against his will.

We do a thing Sponte, we do a thing invite, and we Sponte. Invite. Non
invite.
do a thing non invite. We do a thing Sponte, when we are altogether willing
to it; we do a thing invite, when it is partly with our will, and partly
against our will; we do a thing non invite, quando procedit ex ignorantia
comitante; as when Mutius Scaevola killed another in Porcenna, and when it was
told him that he had missed the King, and killed another, he was sorry that he
had not killed the King; this action was neither done Sponte, nor invite, but
non invite; but when a man kills in sudden passion, and after that his
passions and perturbations are settled, he is sorry that he has done such a
thing, and is grieved that primus impetus non est in sua potestate, then he
does it invite.

There is a twofold concupiscence, an antecedent Concupiscentia
Antecedens. Consequens.

concupiscence, and a consequent concupiscence; the antecedent concupiscence is
that, when the passion preventeth the will, and moves it; but the consequent
concupiscence is that, when the will willingly works, and stirs up the
passion, that it may execute the sin more readily; when passion preventeth
the will, then it extenuateth the sin, but when the will stirs up the
passion, then it augmenteth the sin.

Again, we must make a difference betwixt these Agere
Ex ira. Iratus.

two, to do a thing ex ira, and to do a thing iratus; when a man does a thing
ex ira, anger is only the cause of it, and it repents him of it afterward
that he has done it; but when he does a thing iratus, it does not proceed
principally from his anger, but from some other bad disposition, and hardly
such a man repents him of his fact.

Lastly, there is a difference betwixt eligere and praeeligere; Eligere.
Praeeligere.
eligere is to follow sense and appetite, but praeeligere is to follow reason:
When a man kills in sudden passion, it is electio non praeelectio: This
sin of Anger follows the complexion of the body.
anger comes commonly of the complexion of the body, nam ex iracundis
nascuntur irati; the Philosopher says, a certain man being challenged for
beating of his father, gave this answer; My father beat his father, and
pointing to his son with his finger, he said, this my son will beat me
also; these hereditary evils are hardly cured.

The woman of Tekoah when one of her sons killed the other, she begged of the
King to remember the law of the Lord, that her other son might be saved in
the City of Refuge, which the King granted unto her willingly, 2 Samuel 14.
because he killed him in sudden passion.

CHAPTER XXII. Whether they might take the sons of the Prophets widow for
debt or not?
2 KING. 4. Now cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
Prophets unto Elisha saying, the Creditour is come to take unto him my two
sons to be bondmen.
IT is a pitiful thing to add grief to those who are in grief already; this
widow she was in grief already, and those who would take her sons from her,
add new grief unto her. The Lord says, Make not sad the heart of the widow.
Iere. 22. 3. Elias 1 King. 17. 20. said unto the Lord, O Lord my God, thou have
brought evil upon this widow with whom I sojourne, by slaying her son: As if
he should say, is it not enough O Lord, that thou have taken away her husband,
but thou will take away her son also? The Lord could not do wrong to this
widow by taking away both her son and her husband; but they who came to take
this poor widows children, did great wrong to her, in adding new grief to
her.

The widow in the Hebrew is called [ Almonah] muta (...) Vidua ab (...) Silere.
(...) Vacua.
ab [Alam] silere, because she has no body to speak for her; and she is
called [ Rikam] empty. Ruth 1. 21. because she wants a husband to defend
her; a widow who lives in pleasure, she is dead while she is living, 1 Timothy
5. 6. but a widow that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusts in God, and she
is civilly dead when she wants the means to help her.

The Lord forbids in his Law to take to pledge the upper or the nether
Millstone, which are the means to maintain the man's life, Deuteronomy. 24. 6. The
widows two sons were (as it were) the nether and the upper Millstone to gain
her living. Secondly, the Lord forbids to take to pledge the cloths in which
the poor man lies in the night, for he says, when he cries unto me I will
hear, for I am gracious, Exodus 22. 27. And when those two sons of the widow
were taken from her, did not the Lord hear her, a poor woman, a poor widow,
the widow of one that feared the Lord, the widow of a Prophet? Yes verily, he
heard her and that quickly; And, he that says, Touch not mine anointed, and
do my Prophets no harm, Psalm. 105. 15. so he says, touch not the Prophets
widow, nor her sonn^s, and do them no harm. Thirdly, the Lord commanded them
when they went to seek the pledge, that they should not go in into the house
to fetch it, but they should stand abroad, and the man should bring it out
himself, Deuteronomy. 24. 10. But they who violently took away the woman's sons
observed not this, but did as the wicked servant in the Gospel, who took his
fellow servants by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owe, Mat. 22. 28.

Ye will say, this was a just debt, and therefore ought

See what Esaias answers, Chap. 58. 6. Is not this the Fast that I required, to
undo the heavy burden, and to let the oppressed go free? This debt was a
heavy burden upon the poor woman's shoulders, and therefore they ought to have
remitted it. Job. 22. 6. Thou have taken a pledge from thy brother: Hhobhel,
signifies both pignus (...)
Pignus. Funis.

and funis a pledge, and a cord, because it binds as strongly as cords do;
and the Greeks call it (...), Quasi obligatio, suppositum, and obnoxios sibi
subijcere, with this cord they would have bound the poor widow.

Job when he describes the oppressor, Chap. 24. 3. he says, he takes away
the widows Ox for a pledge; he takes the Ox, the beast that is so needful
for her, therefore he that took an Ox was bound to restore five Oxen for him,
Exodus 22. 1. Again, to take the widows only Ox, we see how Nathan
exaggerateth the rich man's fault, for taking the poor man's only sheep, 2 Samuel
12. And if it be oppression, and a crying sin to take the poor widows Ox,
what a sin was it to take her sons, who should have relieved her in her
necessity? Ezekiel. 18. 16. it is a note of the child of God, that he with held
not the pledge from the poor. In the Original it is [ Hhabhol lo hhabhal]
Pignorando non pignoravit, (...) Pignorando non Pignoravit.
the repetition of the same word signifies to take away the pledge, and to
keep it.

The widow of Tekoah, when one of her sons had killed the other, and the
revenger of the blood came to kill, she desired that her other son which was
alive, might be saved, because he was her unica pruna, her only sparkle that
was left alive, 2 Samuel 14. Wherefore to take this widows two sons from her,
was to put out her light.

The conclusion of this is. Of all sorts of oppression this father to the
fatherles, and a Judge of the widows, Psalm. 68. 6. therefore men should beware
to wrong or harm them: God will defend their cause, he relieveth the
fatherless and the widow, Psalm. 146. 9. And he that is their Redeemer is
strong.

CHAPTER XXIII. Whether a man may sell his son for debt, or not?
MAT. 20. 25. But for as much as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to
be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be
made.
THere are three sorts of commanding in the family; the first is Herilis
potestas; the second is Maritalis potestas; and the third is Patria potestas;
these three sorts of power differ.

Herilis potestas, is like the government Monarchical, which has more
absolute commandment to dispose of things, so had the Master, Mat. 20. 25.
over his servants, when he commanded the man, his wife and children to be sold.

The second sort of commanding in the family, is the authority which the man
has over his wife, and this is like the Aristocraticall power, for the man in
his necessity, may not sell his wife to set himself at liberty, Et uxor non
est in bonis, she is not a part of his goods.

The third sort of commanding in the house, is Patria potestas; and here the
father has a greater authority over the children, for they are a special
part of their fathers possession, Deuteronomy. 32. 6. Ipse est pater tuus qui possedit
te? Is not he thy father that has bought thee? The Lord permitted a man to
sell his children under the Law, Exodus 21. 7. If a man sell his daughter to be
a hand-maide. So Ezra 2. 5. the Jews being in debt sold their children.

Jacob when he made his latter will, Genesis 42. 22. he says, I gave to thee one
part above thy brethren, which I conquered with my bow and with my sword. Jacob
himself never purchased Sichem, but his sons purchased it when they killed
the Sichemites. Why does he say then, which I have purchased with my Bow? The
reason of this was, because Jacob was Lord over his children, and over all that
they conquered.

A father has such authority over his son, that he might sell him until he
was sui juris, that is, until he was one and twenty years old. First, he
might sell him before he was seven year old; then he might have sold him the
second time, until he was fourteen year old, if his debt had not been
paid: and thirdly, he might have sold him until he was twenty one. So he
might sell his daughter. Exodus 21. 7. It is not understood here, that he might
sell his daughter when she was ready to be married, but simply, he might sell
her at any time. And the Lord alludeth to this form, Esaias Allusion.
50. 1. Which of my Creditours is it, to whom I have sold you? The father might
sell himself, therefore he might sell his son, because his son is but a
part of himself.

But there are sundry things which cannot be sold Quia nullam admittunt
aestimationem, as blood, chastity, liberty, and such like.

This was not properly a sale, but only an enterchange Non est conditio
absoluta, sed quasi sub pacto, tenetur enim emptor filium D. ll. 2. Cap. de
Patribus qui filios distraxerunt.
restituere, si justum pretium offeratur illi; That is, this condition in
selling of his son was not absolute, but the contract was so made, that the
buyer was bound to ^^store his son back again to him, if he had offered him
a sufficient price.

In the natural body, the hand or any other member will cast up it self to
save a stroke from the head; so should the natural son do to relieve his
father. Ruben offered himself in stead of Benjamin, to be a bondservant, Genesis
44. 33. Now if Ruben offered this for his youngest brother, much more should
the son offer to become a bond-servant for his old father.

The conclusion of this is, the children ought not to lay up for the Parents,
but the Parents for the children, 2 Cor. 12. 17. yet to supply their fathers
necessity, they should be content to quite their liberty, and all that they
have for their fathers liberty.

CHAPTER XXIIII. Of their diverse sorts of Rulers and Commanders.
EXODUS 18. 25. And Moses choose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads
over the people, Rulers over thousands, etc.
THe people of the Jews were divided into twelve (...) virg^. (...) Trib^^.
Tribes, those Tribes were called Shibhte* because they had a rod carried
before them.

Before the renting of the ten Tribes from Judah they were called Israelites;
but after the rent of the ten Tribes, the two Tribes and the half were
called Judah, and the ten Tribes were usually called Israel; and sometimes
Joseph, and Izreel, and sometimes Jacob. And in the Captivity they are called
Jews, as Ester 2. 5. Mordecai of Benjamin is called a Jew, so Ester 3. Haman
sought to destroy all the Jews: and they are all called Israel in the
Captivity, and thou shall bear the iniquity of Israel and Judah, Ezekiel. 4. And
once halevj, Mal. 2. 8. (...) cum (...) demonstrativ^.
cum [he] demonstrativo, to signify that levi is not put here for a proper
name.

Those who ruled the twelve Tribes were diverse, I^shua 23. 2. Joshua called for
all Israel, for their Elders, for their heads, for their Judges and for their
officers.

For the Elders, these are called zekenim, and the Seventie (...) Seniores.
translate them (...), id est, majores; zekenim is sometimes taken for the
great Synedrion, and sometimes for the Kings Council, 2 King. 1. 10. And Iehu
sent unto Samaria to the Rulers of Izreel, here the word Elders is taken for
the Kings Council, and not for the Synedrion, for it sat in Jerusalem: and
sometimes in the lesser Cities zekenim are called Senatores.

Secondly; He called for [ roshim] their heads, which the Seventie translate
(...), Principes; This word [ rosh] (...) Capita, Prinpes.
is taken sometimes for the Captains of the Armies, 1 Samuel 11. 11. And Saul
divided his Army into three heads, that is three Companies. Judge. 11. 7. eris
nobis [lerosh] in caput, the Seventie translate it (...). So [ rosh] is taken
for the heads of the families, and they are called [ roshe abhoth] here; Joshua
sent for the Captains of the Army.

Thirdly; He sent for [ Sh^phetim] the Judges, that (...) vel (...) I^dices.
is the Rulers of the Cities, and these also were called [ Omanim] 2 King. 10.

These who ruled the people, were either the heads (...).
of the Tribes, and they were called share hashebhatim, or (...): these
conveined the Tribes, and were Captains in their wars, for the Tribes had
their own proper wars, sometimes one against another; so the Danites made
war against them of Lachis, and they of Ephraim against Iepthe, Judge. 12.

Or else they were Commanders in some part of the Tribe, for the Tribes were
divided into families, and these who were chief in the family were called [
Share (...) Capita Familiarum.
mishpahhim] or Patriarchae, capita familiarum, the Patriarchs or heads of the
families.

These families again were divided into thousands; Example. In Judah there were
five great families, or [ alphe] thousands, and they had five Commanders who
were called (...), Numb. 1. 16. these were the heads of thousands in Israel.
And Micha alludeth to this chap. 5. 2. Bethleem Ephrata although thou be little
amongst the thousands of Judah. Secondly, some were Commanders over hundreds,
and they were called (...). Thirdly, they were Commanders over fifties, Esaias 3.
3. And lastly, Rulers over ten. This division was instituted by Moses by the
Council of Iethro, and approved by Iehosaphat, 2 Chronicles. 19. These Commanders
over thousands, hundreds, and fifties were [ bagnale ribhoth] Lords to take
away strife from the (...)
people, like our Justices of peace; and they differed from the ordinary Judges
called Shophetim. (...)


Lastly, They had their [ shoterim] which word is diversely translated by the
Seventie: first they translate it (...)
(...), because by force they compelled men to obedience, loro et baculo
cogebant: and sometimes they translate them (...), because they carried a rod:
and sometimes (...), Pro. 6 6. Go to the Pismire, who has not [Shoter] over
seer or ruler. So Exodus 5. 15. they translate Shoterim (...), as ye would say,
institutores vel doctores, because they taught the people obedience to the
Magistrates: and Act. 13. 35. (...); Syrus habet, caput vrbis. Iunius
translates it moderatores, and Aquila translateth it (...), facinorum Vindices.
Lastly, they translate shoterim, (...), under-rowers; for as in a Gallie there
are commanders, rowers, and under-rowers; so in this well constituted
Commonwealth of the Jews, there were supreme Commanders, Commanders in the
middle degree, and Commanders in the inferior degree.

CHAPTER XXV. Of their civil counting of their times, and first of their Hour.
THe Greeks derive the hour from (...), terminare, Of their times.
because it measured the times of the year; or from (...) custodire, because
they fained that the hours kept Apolloes gates; but it seems rather to be
derived from the Hebrew word [ Or] lux, and hence the Egyptians call the Sun
(...) Apollo.

The Greeks at the first had no other division of the year but into four
seasons, which they called quatuor horae anni: and the Latins called them
quatuor tempestates anni. The like division they made of the day, and they
said, solis occasus suprema tempestas esto.

Afterward they divided these tempestates into so many hours in the day, those
hours were either called horae minores, and they were measured by the Zodiac,
and planetarie or unequal hours, because of the obliquitie of the Zodiac;
or else they were called horae equinoctiales equal hours, because of the
straightness of the Equinoctial.

The Jews at first learned the division of the day into whole hours from the
Romans, for before this the hours were either halfe-houres, or (...)
occasional hours, as to dine and to suppe; So the hours of dinner and supper
were described of old by drawing of water, as Rebecca came out to draw water,
Genesis 24. 11. This was the evening time when women came out to Septuaginta
dix^r^nt (...). Din^er and Supper de^c^ibed by drawing of water.
draw water. So they noted the dinner time by drawing of water, Ioh. 5. 31.
when the woman of Samaria came out to draw water, then the Disciples brought
meat to Christ and desired him to eat; This was dinner time.

Of the hours upon Ahaz Dial.
THe hours set upon Ahaz Dial were unequal, or planetarie hours, because
this dial was made upon a polar ground.

There are five grounds upon which a dial must be Five sorts of Dials.
made; First upon the elevation of the Equinoctial, whose hours are always
equal. Secondly vertical, and it shows only from six to six
equinoctially. Thirdly meridionall, which shows the hours from the rising of
the Sun unto the midday, upon the East side, and from the midday till the
Sun set upon the West side. Fourthly horizontall, which has no shadow under
the Equinoctial, or near the Equinoctial. And the last is the polar dial,
which follows the Zodiac, and the hours are contracted upon the South side
of the Equinoctial in the Winter, and enlarged upon the North side in the
Summer.

This Dial of Ahaz could not be made upon an equinoctial Upon what ground Ahaz
Dial was made.
ground, because the hours of the Equinoctial dial are equal. Secondly, it
could not be made vertical, because the vertical shows only from six to
six, and not the rising and setting of the Sun. Thirdly, it could not be
made meridionall, because the East side and the West side are divided by the
meridionall, and it wants the twelfth hour. Fourthly, it could not be made
horizontall, because they lay so near the Equinoctial that the style could
cast no shadow. Therefore it behoved to be polar, and the hours behoved to be
unequally divided for Summer and Winter, or else they behoved to have two
Dialls, one for Summer, and another for Winter.

The form of this Dial was Hemispheriall, or an half Circle.

In this Dial we have to consider these points; First, What things are to be
considered in this dial.
that the lines were but half hours upon the dial, and not full hours.
Secondly, that this miracle has been wrought when the Sun was in the height,
for if it had been in the declination, or in the afternoon, then it could
not have gone forward ten degrees; or if it had been soon in the morning, it
could not have gone back ten degrees. Thirdly, this miracle was wrought in the
Summer time, the day being at the longest; it could not be brought back ten
degrees in the winter day, for when the day is shortest, the Sun arises to
them at seven of the clock: neither could this miracle be wrought at the
Equinoctial, for then they could not have discerned the Sun to cast a shadow
upon the dial, because then the shadow is so long; but the Text says, that
the Sun went back so many degrees upon Ahaz dial, 2 King. 20. Therefore it
seems to have been wrought in the Summer time, at the longest day, when it
was drawn back from the eleventh hour to the sixth, which is one hour after
the Sun rising; for in the longest day it arises to them at five of the
clock in the morning.

Whether went the Sun back ten degrees, or did the Sun stand still, and
the shadow go back upon Abulensis upon 2 King. 20. holds, the shadow went
back ten degrees;] or did the Sun go back and the shadow also?

If the shadow had gone back, and not the Sun, the miracle had not been so
great, for when the Sun quoad modum, Three sorts of miracles.
sed non quoad substantiam, and it had been but a miracle in the third degree;
A miracle in the highest degree is, when nature had never a hand in a thing, as
to make the Sun go back so many degrees, or to stand still. A miracle in
the second degree is this, when nature had once a hand in producing of a thing,
but when nature fails once, it cannot restore it to the former ^ase again.
Example. Nature brings forth a man seeing, now when he becomes blind,
nature cannot restore him to his sight, and when he is restored to his sight
again, it is a miracle in the second degree. A miracle in the third degree is
this, when nature in time could do such a thing, but cannot do it upon a
sudden. Example. Peter's Mother in law was sick of a Fever; Nature in time
could cure one of a Fever, but Christ curing her upon a sudden, this is a
miracle in the third degree. Example 2. When a lump of figs was laid to
Hezekias boil, the figs in time would have matured this boil, and broken
it, but when the Lord does it upon a sudden, this is a miracle in the third
degree. So for the shadow to go back when the Sun goes forward, this is
natural to it, but for the shadow to go back upon a sudden, this was a
miracle in the third degree, but when the Sun and the shadow both went back,
this was a miracle in the first degree, and quoad modum and quoad substantiam.

What confirmation of his faith had this been, if the

If it had gone forward ten degrees in an instant, that

If the Sun went back only, and not the shadow, Dionysius Areopagita makes
mention of the Eclipse of the Sun in Christ's Passion.

The heathen in their writings might have made mention Jason there is mention
made of the standing of the Sun and Moon in Joshua's days, and that Book
is perished now; shall we say then, that nothing is written in this Book,
because this Book is not extant?

Whether was this a greater miracle when the Sun Hezekias days, or when the
Sun stood still in Joshua's days?

If ye will respect them to whom this miracle was Joshua's days, it was a
greater miracle; it Whether this miracle or that in I^sh^a's days was greatest?
was wrought for the confirmation of all Israel, and this was wrought but for
the confirmation of Hezekias; Secondly, Joshua's day was longer than Hezekias
day; Hezekias day was but twenty two hours, and Joshua's day was twenty and
four: Ecclus 46. 4. Stetit Sol and ^na dies facta est in duas, Did not the
Sun go back by his means? And was not one day as long as two.

This miracle was wrought at three of the clock in the afternoon, for the
Moon was a quadrant of the Heaven distant from the Sun, and quarter Moon;
for Gibea was Southwest from Megiddo where they did fight, and there the Sun
stood, and Ajalon where the Moon stood was Southeast.

How stood the Sun here at three afternoon Southwest

the Sunne-rising and the Sunne-setting, this is in the midst of the day; but
it is in medio interpositionis, when it is any part of the Heaven betwixt the
two extremes, it was now but in medio interpositionis.

Again, this miracle was wrought twenty days after This miracle was w^ough^
tw(...) days after the Equinoxe.
the Equinoxe; for Joshua instituted the Passover Cap. 5. the fourteenth day
of Nisan, which was at the Equinoxe, and that Moon had but fourteen days to
run to the change, and now the Moon was before the Sun; but when the
miracle fell out, the Moon was behind the Sun, and it was quarter-Moone; so
that the fourteen days of the old Moon, and the eight days of the other
Moon, made up twenty days after the Equinoxe.

Thirdly, Joshua's day was twenty-foure hours, nine Joshua's day was 24.

hours already past, and three hours to the Sunnesetting; then the Sun
stood a whole Equinoctial day, which all being joined together, makes
twenty-foure hours, then it is said Josh. 10. 14. That there was no day like
to it before or after, which must be understood, that there was no day before
or after like unto it for length.

Hezekias day was but twenty-two hours in length, Hezekias day was 22. hours.
which is proved thus; the Sun had run twelve degrees already forward upon
Ahaz Dial, which makes six planetary hours; then it goes back again
ten degrees, which makes five planetary hours, and this made eleven hours.

Might not the Sun have gone back to the Sunnerising,

Not; because the Sun casts no shadow upon the Ahaz an hour after it
rises, and an hour before it set; neither upon any other Dial, for then the
shadows are so long, that they show not the hour, it went back then but to
the hour after that it arose, which was the second planetary hour, then it
had five planetary hours to the midst of the day, which made up sixteen
hours; and six hours to the Sunne-setting, which makes in all twenty-two
hours.

Now to make some application and spiritual use of these Dials.

Christ before his Incarnation was like to the Sun The spiritual use of
these Dials.
shining upon the Equinoctial Dial, where the shadow is very low; secondly,
before Christ came in the flesh, there were many Ceremonies, and a long shadow,
but since Christ came in the flesh, this is like the Sun shining upon the
Polar Dial, the shadow is short and the Sun is nearer.

Thirdly, our estate in this life compared with the life to come, is like to
the meridionall Dial; for the meridionall Dial shows not the twelfth hour;
so in this life, we see not the son of righteousness in his brightness.

Fourthly, our estate in this life, is like the vertical Dial, which shows
neither the rising nor setting of the Sun; so in this life we know neither
our coming into the world, nor the time when we are to go out of it.

Fifthly, our estate in the life to come is like the Horizontall Dial, for as
the Sun shines always upon the Horizontall Dial; so shall the Sun of
righteousness shine always upon us in the life to come.

CHAPTER XXVI. Of their Day.

the whole twenty four hours.

The artificial day began at the Sunne-rising, and ended at the Sunne-setting,

Plejades, etc.

A Prophetical day is taken for a year in the Scriptures; as they had a
prophetical day, so they had prophetical weeks, prophetical months, and
prophetical years.

A week signifies a week of years, as Daniels seventie Prophetical days,
weeks, and years.
weeks, Dan. 9. 25. So the month signifies a month of years, according to
the Greek computation, counting thirty days to a month; so the year
signifies a year of years, Iere. 28. 3. Adhuc duo anni annoru^; So these
places in the Revelation, Forty two months an hundredth and sixty days three
years and an half, so time, times, and half a time, are prophetically to be
understood; A prophetical day, is a year; the week seven years, the month
thirty years, and the prophetical year three hundredth and sixty years,
and this way they counted, to signify the shortness of the time. A day
applied to the estate of grace.


A day is applied in the Scripture first to our estate in grace, Heb. 4. To day
if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts; and all the Comparisons in
the Scriptures are taken from the forenoone, to show the growth of grace;
First, (...), or the morning Star, and the dawning of the day, and the

morning it flourishes, and grows up, but in the evening it is cut down and

decays again; and the hours of the day whereunto our life is compared, are
like planetary hours, long in the Summer, and short in the Winter: Compare our
days with the days of our fathers, they are but few and evil, in respect of
their days, therefore our days are called dies palmares.

cause morning salutations to be given unto him: the History says, that the
world seemed to go backward in this monsters days: this sort of people Seneca
calls them our Antipodes, for when we rise they go to bed and contra.

How they reckoned the days of the Week.
THe Jews reckoned their days thus; Prima Sabbath, secunda sabbath, the first
day of the week, the second day of the week, etc. Secondly, the Latin Church
reckoned from the Passover, Prima feria, secunda feria, etc. Thirdly, they
borrowed afterward another sort of reckoning from the Heathen, who reckoned
their days by the Planets, the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Mars, etc.

What is the reason that they reckoned not the days Saturn stands in the
highest place, then Jupiter, next Mars, and so in order Sol, Mercury, Venus,
and then Luna. Jupiter follows not Saturn in the days of the week, but
Sol; so Mercury follows not Sol but Luna.

The order of the days of the week is Mathematical; bases to the Hemisphere,
whose bases arise from the several corners drawn in the circle, in whose
circumference, the seven Planets are set down according to their own order,
making up one equal triangle in every one of their two sides, as, Sol, Luna,
Mars; Sol is in the right side of the triangle, Luna in the top, and Mars in
the left side of the triangle; and so from Mars to Jupiter by Mercury; and
from Jupiter to Saturn by Venus; and from Saturn to Luna by Sol, and from the
Moon to Mercury by Mars; and from Mercury to Venus by Jupiter, as ye may
see in the figure following.

Planets.

CHAPTER XXVII. Of their month.
EXODUS 12. 2. This shall be the beginning of months to you.
BEfore the people of God came out of Egypt, the months were reckoned
according to the course Reasons proving how many days every month had.
of the Sun, following the custom of the Egyptians and Chaldeans, and their
months were full thirty days, as may be gathered out of the eight of
Genesis, the flood began to wax the seventh day of the second month Iair,
answering to our May; and it began to decrease in the seventh day of the
seventh month Tishri: from the seventh day of the second month, to the
seventh day of the seventh, are one hundred and fifty days, which being
divided by thirty, gives to every month thirty days. After they came out
of Egypt their months were full thirty days, Numb. 11. 19. Ye shall not
eat one day, neither five days, neither ten days but even a whole month.
Hence we may gather that their month was full thirty days; because they

reckoned by five, ten, twenty, thirty. So there were twelve months in the
year, every month consisting of thirty days: 1 King. 4. 7. And Solomon had
twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the King and his
household. Each man in his month through the year made provision: now if there
had been more then twelve months in the year, (as afterward the Jews made
their intercalar year Veadar) then one should have had two months. So 1 Chronicles. 27. 1. and 12. 15. The chief Officers served the King by courses, which
came in and out month by month throughout all the months in the year: here
we may see that there were twelve months in the year, and every month had
thirty days, which made up in the year three hundred and sixty days.

But because there were five full days lacking in the The twelve months come

months to fill up the course of the Sun, which is three hundred sixty and
five days, the Egyptians put to the five days called (...) to the last month
Tishri: The five odd days illustrated by an apologue of Mercury and the
Moon.
and they illustrate the matter by this apologue, they say, that Mercury and
the Moon at a time did play at the dice for the five odd days, and that
Mercury did win them from the Moon, and Mercury followed the course of the
Sun. And in respect the Sun every year runs three hundred sixty five
days and How the leap year or bissextile is made up.
six odd hours, which six odd hours every fourth year makes a day, they
added this day to the fourth year, which year by the Egyptians was called

about to the same point again. So Ioh. 18. 13. (...) is a year, so Luke 3. 2.

to and fro through the whole year, for the space of one hundred and twenty
years. This is called saeculum, Genesis 26. and therefore they inter-laced a
whole month for this desultorius dies, which in What makes an embolimie year.
the space of one hundred and twenty years makes up a month of thirty days:
and because that day which afterward was inter-called in the fourth year
lacked some scruples of a whole day, therefore in the space of The Suns
course comes always back in the months.
one hundred thirty and six years the Sun turned back a day in every
month, when it comes to the Equinoxe or Solstice. The Sun was in the
Equinoxe at Christ's death, in the twenty fifth of March* now it is come to the
tenth of March, and if the world should continue long, it should come to the
tenth of January and so backward. This shows that the Sun keeps The Sun

called i^ (...), as ye would say Jupiters boy, 1 Macch. 9. 50.

It was after the captivity before they learned to inter-call The reason of
the months intercalation after the captivity.
their month, and then they began to inter-call them, that they might make
both the Sun and the Moon come both to one period every second or third
year. And that they might know the time of the change of the Moon, for the
keeping of their feasts the better: and for every second or third year they
doubled the month adar, and called it veadar, and this year was called the
embolimie year. And because the Sun and the Moon met not in one period the
second or third year, therefore they made up the golden number consisting of
nineteen years, wherein the Sun The course of the Sun and Moon agree after
nineteen years are complete, and called the golden number.
and the Moon met both in one period together. The rule for this embolimie
amongst the Hebrews was this; ter ter bis bis ter ter ter, id est, mensis
intercalandus est, anno tertio, sexto, octavo, undecimo, decimo quarto, decimo
septimo, decimo nono; et annus decimus nonus erat intercalandus, consisting of
seven months.

Before the captivity they had no other inter-calling or reducing the Moon to
the Sun, but only dies (...) Egyptiorum: and the Turks at this day
observing only the lunarie year, and never reducing the Moon to the Sun,
therefore the month Rammadon falls sometimes in Summer, and sometimes in
wiuter.

When they inter-called their months, they called the month which they
inter-called, Veadar; and this Veader was their twelfth month, and Adar was
their thirteenth month; this Veadar was but esteemed as momentum temporis
among the Jews, and in their civil computations it had no use, neither judged
they any cause in this month, and the Jews set down this case.

Ruben and Simeon were two twins; Ruben the eldest was borne in the last day of
the intercalar month Veadar, and Simeon his brother was borne in the first day
of the ordinary month adar, so that Simeon was but a day younger then Ruben.
And the case was handled amongst the Judges which of them should enter into the
inheritance first, and they ordained that Simeon should enter a month before
his brother Ruben, because Ruben was borne in that month which was not
reckoned amongst the months, and therefore they counted him a month younger
then his brother Simeon. The Sun exceeds the Moons course eleven days.


This reckoning they kept, that they might reduce the course of the Moon to
the Sun, for the Sun exceeds the Moon eleven days; and also the month

The month exceeds the Moons course six days.

exceeds the Moon in the whole year six days, (when the months are full
thirty days.) And thirdly the Sun exceeds the twelve months, five days
and six hours, which six hours every fourth year makes up a day, and this
year we call leap year^: these eleven odd days are not cast away, they are
insititij dies, or ingrafted days, as a graft is grafted in a tree, and they
are called the Epact, because they are cast to, to the end of the year, for to
reduce the Moons course to the course of the Sun; neither are they left as
dies desultorij, to run at random through all the months of the year.

This time of the Epact with them is counted as no time, and they illustrate
the matter thus. A man had The embolimie epact counted as no time.
thirty sons and thirty daughters, and three which were neither his sons
nor his daughters, but abortives, borne out of time; these thirty sons and
thirty daughters were the days and the nights of the months, and the three
odd days after the third embolimie were reserved as insititij dies, until
the next embolimie, and were no part of the months of the year, until the
seventh embolimie.

The spiritual use which the Scripture makes of the Moon is, first to show
us the instabilitie of the world, therefore Revel. 12. 1. the Church is the
woman clothed with the Sun, having the moon under her fect: to signify
that the Church shall tread under foot the changeable world.

Secondly, as the Moon changes, so does the life of man, Job 14. while my
change come: so Prove. 31. 8. (...) Filii mutationis.
aperi os tuum in causa filierum mutationis, that is, for him that is going to
be put to death; and as we pray when the Moon changes, Lord send us a good
change, so should we pray especially when we are ready to die, that the Lord
would give us a happy change.

CHAPTER XXVIII. Of their Year.
2 CHRO. 24. 23. And it came to pass at the end of the year, (or in the
revolution of the year) that the Host of Assyria came up.
THe Jews had a twofold beginning of the reckoning of their year; the first
was from Tishri, the second was from Nisan.

They began their first reckoning from Tishri, in the month Elul their year
ended, and in this month their new year began; this was called [ Tekuphah]
revolutio (...) Revolutio.
anni. 1 King. 20. 26. it was in this month that the Kings went forth to
battle, 2 Samuel 11. 1. And it came to pass when the year was expired at the
time when Kings went out to battle. They went out to battle at this time of
the year, because then the heat of the year was declining; and the Chaldees
called this month, Mensis (...) Mensis Antiquorum.
Ethanim, id est, veterum, 1 King. 8. 2. In this month they began to reckon
before they came out of Egypt, because the Jews held that the world was
created in this month; this month is called [ Hhoreph] pueritia, for as (...)
chaldaice Pueritia et Hye^s.
Tishri is the beginning of the year, Genesis 8. 22. so the beginning of our age
is our childhood, Job 29. 4.

Their Ecclesiastical reckoning began in Nisan, Exodus Their Ecclesiastical
reckoning began in Nisan.
12. 1 Chronicles. 12. 15. These are they who went over Jordan in the first month,
when Jordan had overflowed all the banks: this was in the month Nisan, for
then the snow melts upon the mountains of Libanus, and the waters overflow
the banks of Jordan. Ioh. 4. 35. Say ye not there are yet four months and
then comes the harvest? that is, the Pascha and the Pentecost; the first was
the beginning of the harvest, and the last was the end of the harvest; the
beginning of the harvest fell in the first month of the year in Nisan; for on
the fourteenth day was the Pascha, and on the fifteenth day they brought in
handfuls of new Corn; and Zach. 7. 1. The word of the Lord came unto Zachariah
in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu, that is, in the ninth
from Nisan. So the feast of the Tabernacles was kept in the seventh month
Tishri, which is the seventh from Nisan.

From Nisan they reckoned their feasts, the reign of What they reckoned from
every month.
their Kings, their contracts, bonds, and Obligations.

From Elul answering to our August; they reckoned the age of their young beasts
which they were to offer to the Lord, none of their beasts were offered before
Elul.

Thirdly, from Tishri answering to our September, they reckoned the seventh
year of the resting of their land, and their Jubilees; and from this time they
reckoned Vide Buxt^r. Synag.
how long their trees were circumcised or uncircumcised.

Fourthly, from Shebat answering to our January, they reckoned all their trees
which paid fruit, they paid tithe only of these trees which began to
flourish at that time.

The conclusion of this is; As the Lord changed the Jews from Tishri to Nisan,
because the Jews then were delivered out of Egypt; so the Lord has changed
our reckoning now from the old Sabbath of the Jews, to the new reckoning of
our Sabbath, because this day our delivery and redemption was finished; 2 Cor.
5. 17. Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.

CHAPTER XXIX. Of their numbering, and manner of counting.
PRO. 3. 6. Wisdom comes with length of days in her right hand.
THey numbered of old three manner of ways; first, by their fingers; secondly,
by letters; and thirdly, by Ciphers.

First, by their fingers, for as their first measure was their hand. Esaias 40.
12. Who has measured the waters with the hollow of his hand, and met out the
heavens with his span? So their first numbering was by their fingers; and
Solomon alludeth to this form, Pro. 3. 6. Wisdom comes with length of
days in her right hand. The Greeks called this (...), because they numbered
upon their five fingers; so Ovidius, Lib. 2. Fast.


Seu quia tot digitis per quos numerare Solemus.
So Iuvenal writing of Nestor;
-- Sua dextra computat annos.
They numbered upon their ten fingers, because no simple number can go beyond
nine, and the tenth number is the complement of all simple numbers.

They numbered, first with their right hand upon the left, because the right
was the most fit hand for action, for the spirits lie in the right side of the
heart, and so make the right hand more fit to do any thing; and the blood
lies more to the left side, and therefore the left hand is not so fit for
action. Solomon says, that the wise man's heart is at his right hand, Eccles.
10. 2. the spirits enableth his hand more to do; and the fools is at his left
hand, because there are not so many spirits in the left side of the heart to
quicken the hand; but when the spirits incline equally to both the sides, then
he is [ Itter jad] ambidexter, that could use the left hand as (...) Ambidexter.
well as the right; such were the men of Benjamin and Ehud; it should not be
translated left handed, Judge. 3. 15. but he who used both the hands.

They numbered upon the left hand from one to ninety nine, and at an hundredth
they began to turn to the Plinius. Lib. 44.
right hand; therefore Ianus was set up at Rome, with the number of the days
in the year upon his hands, having the great number upon his right hand, and
the small number upon his left.

The way how they numbered upon the left hand Be^^a de rati^ne temp^rum.
was this; when they counted one, they laid the point of their little finger in
the midst of their palm; when The manner of their counting from 10. to 100.
they counted 2, they laid the ring finger upon the palm of their hand, when
they counted 3, they laid their middle finger upon the palm of their hand;
when they counted 4, they lifted up their little finger from the palm of their
hand, and they left other two fingers lie still upon the palm of their hand;
when they counted 5, they lifted up the ring-finger from the palm of their
hand; and when 6, they lifted up the middle finger; when 7, they laid the point
of their little finger about the middle of their hand; and when 8, the
ring-finger about the middle of their hand; when 9, the middle finger about the
middle of their hand; when 10, they laid the nail of their forefinger at the
middle of the thumb; when 20, they laid the nail of the forefinger betwixt
the joints of the thumb; when 30 they laid All numbers under an hundred were
counted upon the left hand.
the nail of the forefinger and the nail of the thumb together; when 40,
they laid the thumb upon the forefinger crosse-wayes; when 50, they inclined
the thumb to the plame of the hand; when 60, they laid the top of the
forefinger to the thumb; when 70. they laid the nail of the thumb to the top
of the forefinger; when 80, they laid the nail of the thumb betwixt the
forefinger and middle finger; when 90. they laid the nail of the forefinger at
the root of the thumb. Luke 15. 4. The Parable seems to allude to this
form of counting, he left ninety and nine and sought that one which was lost.

Then they transferred the numbers from their left All numbers from an hundred
to a thousand upon the right hand.
hand to the right hand, and they numbered hundreths upon the right hand, as
they number simple numbers upon the left hand.

When they came to reckon 1000, they laid the palm of their left hand upon
their breast, with their fingers spread; when 2000, they laid the back of
their left hand upon their breast with their fingers spread; when All numbers
from 1000 to 100000. they numbered with their left hand.
they numbered 30000, they laid the palm of their left hand upon their breast
with their fingers upward; when they numbered 40000, they laid the back of
their left hand upon their breast, and their fingers downward; when 50000, they
laid the palm of their left hand upon their navell, with their fingers upward;
when 60000, they laid the back of their hand upon their navell, with their
fingers downward; when 70000, they laid the palm of their left hand upon their
left thigh, with their fingers crossewayes; when 80000, they laid the back of
their left hand upon their left thigh, with their fingers upward; when 90000,
they laid the palm of their left hand upon their left thigh, with their
fingers downward; so that the hand was laid twice up and twice down, backward
and forward upon their breast, navell, and thigh, therefore Plautus says, Ecce
autem avertit nixus laeva, in femore habet manum, dextra digitis rationem
computat feriens femur, that is, he turns his left hand from his left thigh,
and is come with his right to smite upon his right thigh, to signify an
exceeding great number.

When they came to 100000, they counted with After 100000. they counted the
same way with their right hand.
their right hand upon their belly, navell, and thigh, as they did before
until they came to 10000000.

The Hebrews, Greeks, and Latins, counted likewise by the letters of their
Alphabet; the Hebrews and M. Mill. D. Dimidium mill. X. Because it
consists of two VV. V. Because it stands in the fifth place amongst the
Vowels.
Greeks numbered by all the letters of the Alphabet; but the Latins had only
six by which they counted, M. D. C. X. V. I. M. for 1000. D. for 500. C. for
100. X. for 10. and I. for 1.

Afterward they numbered by Ciphers, which were but lately found out: The
Turks learned it from the Arabians; we from the Turks; and it comes from
the Hebrew word [ Saphar] numerare; in the Arabicke, (...) Numerare.
Siphra est privatio, that is, a figure in the number which signifies nothing
by it self.

The Ancients did not only number with their fingers, but also speak with
them; unto which Solomon alludeth, Pro. 6. 13. The wicked man he speaks with
his Allusion. In tarentilla.
fingers; therefore Naevius says, Alij dat annulum, alium invocat, cumque alio
cantat, alijs denique dat digito literas; Loqui digiti^ quid.
He gives a ring to one, he calls upon another, he sings with another, and to
others he gives letters by his fingers, that is, he mixeth his speeches with
others by poynting out Letters with his fingers. Beda in his Book de
indigitatione, Beda libello de indigitatione
sets down the manner how they spoke with their fingers, after he has set
down the manner how they counted with them, for he says, De ipso computo
quaedam manualis loquela figurari potest, qua literis quis sigillatim
expressis, verba quae cisde^ literis contineantur, alteri qui hanc quoque
noverit industriam tametsi long posito legenda and intelligenda contradat:
that is, out of the same numbering there may be drawn out a certain speaking
by the hands, which a man may deliver to another who stands a far off, who
has the same skill both to read and understand, and this is by Letters
expressed severally, and the whole words are contained in these Letters. So
that the same way a man counts with his fingers, that same way does he speak
with his fingers, for the first number upon the hand, poynteth out the first
Letter, the second number the second Letter, and so to the end of the Alphabet,
and the man that had the best dexterity did join the Letters together, and
made up a word or phrase, which only he and the speaker understood.

They reckoned their numbers upon their fingers: Wisdom bids us bind her
precepts to our fingers, Prove. 7. 3. Alluding to their Phylacteries which they
had upon their Arms; so should we put those numbers upon our hands, and
continually make use of them for the shortness of our life.

CHAPTER XXX. Of their civil Contracts, and manner of writing them.
IERE. 32. 7. Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of
redemption is thine to buy it, etc.
IN this contract and bargain between Jeremy and his Uncles son Hanameel,
consider first the manner how the contract was written; and secondly, how this
testimony is cited by Matthew, Cap. 27. 7.

First, for the manner of writing the contract, he who S^ali^^r in Elen^ho.
was to buy the ground wrote two Instruments, the one he sealed with his own
Signe^, the other he showed Two Instruments written at the buying of Land* one
clo^ed and another no^ closed.
unclosed to the witnesses, that they might subscribe and bear witness of
that which was written: this the witnesses did subscribe upon the back of the
enclosed instrument, and these two Instruments were almost alike in all things,
save only that in the sealed Instrument something was concealed from the
witnesses, the things What things were concealed from the witnesses in the
closed Instrument.
concealed were these, the price of the Land, and the time of the redemption,
these they concealed, (for none knew these but the buyer and the seller) in
case that the Goel or the next of the kindred knowing the time of the
redemption, and the price, and the Morgager not being able to redeem it at the
day, it was lawful for the next of the kindred to have redeemed it; these two
being concealed, there was place still for the poor man to redeem his Land
after the day, therefore they set down in the enclosed Instrument, only the
bare disposition without the price or time of redemption. So amongst C^lius
Rodogineus.
the Romans, when they sealed their latter will, they concealed the name of
the heir, lest any wrong should be done unto him.

It may be asked how these words are cited by Matthew, chap. 27. 9. Then was
fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the Prophet saying, and they took
the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued, which they of
the children of Israel did value, and gave them for a p^tters field, as the
Lord appointed me; he alleges Jeremy, but the words are spoken by Zecharie*
chap. 11.

This testimony in Matthew is made up of the saying Jeremy and Zecharie, and
yet Jeremy is only cited The New Testament c^teth two places out of the old
to make up one testimony.
by Matthew: for it is the mann^r of the new Testament to make up one testimony
of two cited out of the old Testament, although written in diverse places in the
old Testament. Example. Peter Acts 1. 20. makes up but one testimony of
diverse places collected out of the Psalm 69. 17. and 109. 8. so 1 Pet. 2. 7.
this testimony is made up of diverse testimonies out of the Psalm 118. 22. and
Esaias 8. 14. So Christ, Math. 21. 5. makes up one testimony out of Esaias 62. 11.
and Zach. 11. 11. So Mat. 21. 14. made up of Esaias 56. 7. and Iere. 7. 11.

Secondly, this is the manner of the New Testament, The New Testament (...)ing
of two Prophets, express him who ^^th the chief part of the testimony.
when testimonies are cited out of two, they leave out the one and express
only the other, and they cite the whole testimony as written by one: example,
Mat. 21. 5. there is a testimony cited out of two Prophets, yet they are cited
but as one testimony, it is cited out of two Prophets, Esaias 62. 11. and Zach.
9. 9. Yet the Evangelist says, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the Prophet; the first words are Esayes, the latter are Zacharies, and yet they
are cited as if they were the words of Zachary. So Mark. 1. 2. As it is written
in the Prophets; this testimony is written both in Esaias and Malachy, Behold I
send my Messenger before thy face, etc. yet Mat. 3. 3. Esaias is only cited and
not Malachy.

Now let us consider here why the Evangelist cites here Jeremy rather than
Zachary, the Evangelist would Why Matthew rather cites Jeremy than Zachary.
give a reason here, not so much why Christ was bought by the Scribes and
Pharisees, as of the field which was bought for such a price; Zachary speaks
nothing of the field that was bought, wherefore it had not been pertinent for
the Evangelist to have brought in the testimony of Zachary here. Jeremy in his
thirtieth second Chapter tells when the Captivity was now approaching, he is
commanded to buy such a field, and in buying such a field there was some secret
mystery; secondly, there was some analogy, for this field bought by Jeremy was
a type of the Potters field, whereof Matthew speaks, and the analogy
consisted especially in this, the field which Matthew makes mention of, was
bought to be a burial for strangers, and this was typed in the field which was
bought by Jeremy, for Jeremy was commanded What time Jeremiah bought this field.
to buy this field at that time when he was taken prisoner, and when there was
little or no hope for him to come out of prison, and when the City was besieged
by the Chaldeans; the buyer might think now that he had but small reason to
buy that land, which was presently to be taken by the Chaldeans; Jeremy might
have said unto the Lord, the City is to be delivered into the hands of the
Chaldeans, and thou bidst me buy the field for so much money, and the Lord
says, I will deliver this City into the hand of the Chaldeans; hence it may
seem that this field was bought rather for strangers than for the buyer
himself, or any that belonged unto him; therefore Lament. 5. 2. Jeremy says,
our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to Aliants.

But how could Anathoth be turned into a burial place?

It is answered, the field which was in Anathoth was Josh. 21. 18. These Cities
which were assigned unto the Levites, they had no feilds which were arable
about them, to bear Corn, but some ground for the feeding of their Cattle;
and it is most probable that they had some Gardens wherein they buried their
dead; as we read of Joseph of Arimathea, who had a Garden near the City in
which Christ was buried: Secondly, this field by Matthew is called the Potters
field, and here we may see some resemblance betwixt this field and the field
spoken of by Jeremy; for after the writs were perfected, Jeremy said to his
Scribe Baruch, take these writs and put them in an earthen pot, that they may
continue there for many days, verse. 14. There must be something typed by this,
that he bids take these writs and put them in an earthen pot, for men use to
put their writs in Chests and boxes and safest places; and as this buying of
the field was set down as an argument to strengthen the Israelites, that they
should return out of the Captivity, and possess their own lands; so it was a
type of that which Matthew speaks; and as this field which Jeremy bought was
turned into the use of strangers, so was the field which Matthew speaks of
made a burial for strangers; and as the writs were hid in the earthen pot in
Ieremies time, so was this field which Matthew speaks of, a Potters field. In
Zachary there is no mention made of the buying of the field with the thirty
pieces of silver, but Matthew speaks of buying of the field, and so does
Jeremy, therefore the Evangelist pertinently cites Jeremy and not Zachary.

From the citing of this testimony we may draw this Ioh. 5. 39.

CHAPTER XXXI. What things the Goel was bound to do to his kinsman, and what
things were done to him by his brethren.
PROVE. 23 10 Remove not the old land-marke, and enter not within the field of
the fatherless, for their Redeemer (or Goel) is mighty, and he will plead
their cause.
HE that was the Goel in Israel, was bound to do The privileges of the
nearest kinsman.
three things for his brethren; first, he was vindex sanguinis, the revenger of
the blood; secondly, he redeemed the morgaged lands of his kinsman: thirdly, he
delivered him out of prison. These three things he was bound to do jure
propinquitatis, because he was his nearest kinsman.

Now let us apply these to Christ our Goel, first our Goel, or vindex
sanguinis, the revenger of our blood, Christ our nearest kinsman has taken all
their privileges upon him for us.
revengeth all our wrongs. When the heart of the revenger of the blood was hot
within him, Deuteronomy. 19. 6. it was a terrible thing for the manslayer to meet him,
he pursued eagerly after him. So Jesus Christ pursues after his enemies, who
shed the blood of his Church.

Secondly, the Goel redeemed the morgaged Land, Ruth 4. 4. and Iere. 32. 7.
Jeremy cousin to Hanameel redeemed his morgaged Land; we have morgaged our
inheritance in heaven, but our Goel Jesus Christ, who is flesh of our flesh and
bone of our bone, will redeem it to us again.

The the third thing which the Goel did to his kinsman, was to relieve him out
of prison. So we being condemned to that everlasting prison, Christ has bailed
us.

Now the privileges which the firstborn who was The privileges of the
nearest kinsman as he was first borne.
the Goel had done to him were two; First he had the double portion of his
Fathers goods; And secondly, his second brother was bound to raise up seed to
him.

Jesus Christ our eldest brother, he is anointed with gifts above his
fellows, Psalm. 45. and from him we receive grace for grace, Ioh. 1.

The second thing which was due to the Goel was What the second brother was
bound to do for the eldest.
this, if he died without children then his second brother was bound to raise
up seed to him: and if he refused to do it, they pulled off his shoe and spit
in his face. The application of this is; Christ our Eldest brother Ministers
are Christ's second brethren.
shall never want a seed in his Church to the worlds end. When Onan refused to
raise up seed to his brother, then Selah was bound to do it, Genesis 38. So there
shall be still some who shall perform this duty to our Eldest brother.

Again the children were not called their children, but the eldest brothers
children The application is, the Preachers are Christ's younger brethren,
therefore they should beget children to Christ, and not seek their own honor.

If they refused to raise up seed to their brother, then The portion of a
sloth^ull Minister.
their shoe was pulled off, and they did spit in their face. Great shall be the
shame of these who refuse to do this duty to their elder brother Christ:
their shoe shall be pulled off, and they shall loose their part of that
heavenly inheritance.

The Church having such a Goel, men should be loath to meddle with her. Prove.
23. 10. Remove not the old marks, and enter not within the field of the
fatherless, for their Goel, or redeemer, is mighty, and he will plead their
cause: here he alludeth to that place, Deuteronomy. 25. 8. The Lord is a Goel to all
his poor and distressed members: he was Joseph's Goel when he was in prison:
The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of
Jacob. Genesis 49. 24.

CHAPTER XXXII. The difference betwixt the brother natural, and the kinsman in
raising up seed to the eldest brother, and what was done to them if they
refused.
LEVIT. 25. 9. Then shall his brothers wife come unto him, etc.
THere was a twofold pulling off of the shoe in Israel, A twofold use of the
pulling off the shoe.
the first was for a religious use, the second for a civil use. First the
religious use we see in Exodus 3. 5. and in Josh. 5. 13. The second use was a
politic use, and this politic or civil use was two fold; Discalceatio.
firmat^ria Ded^^oris.

the first served for the solemnity of their contracts, and it was called
firmatoria discalceatio; the second was for a punishment and disgrace Deuteronomy. 25.
9. And it differed from that which was used in confirmation in sundry points.

First, when their shoe was taken off for a punishment

Secondly, that pulling off the shoe was for the disgrace of the man; but this
which was used in contracts

Thirdly, that pulling off of the shoe was by command but this pulling off the
shoe was by custom. Ruth 4. 7. This was the manner in former times in Israel.

Fourthly, this shoe was pulled off from the natural Psalm. 60. 8. Over Edom I
will cast my shoe, that is, I will take possession of it: this was called [
Hhalizah] (...) Detractio.
detractio.

Fifthly, when the shoe was pulled off for disgrace, it

Sixthly, In the former pulling off of the shoe, there

Seventhly, In the former the shoe was pulled off

Eighthly, The former was only pulled off when

Ninthly, When they pulled off the shoe in disgrace, Seventie translate (...),
and Josephus (...) to smite him in the face: but in this latter there was no
such disgrace offered to the man.

Tenthly, In the former when the shoe was pulled off, so shall it be done to
the man who refuses to build his brothers house, Deuteronomy. 25. 9. but in the
latter there were no such words spoken.

Lastly, he that refuses to raise up seed to his brother his house was called
domus discalceati in Israel; but there followed no such disgrace to the man who
pulled off his shoe in the contract.

They make another difference to be this, that he who The difference betwixt
the natural brother and the kinsman.
was the natural brother, when he raised up seed to his brother, the children
were not called his children, but his brothers children, and the shoe was
pulled off his foot, because he refused to do that honor to his brother; but
when a cousin-german raised up seed to his kinsman, the children were not
called after his kinsman that was dead, but as the father pleased to call them.
Boaz called not his son Machlon, after the first husband of Ruth, but Obed.

But the question is, whether they were bound to Deuteronomy. 25. 6. the words in the
original are these; Primogenitus quem pepererit stabit super nomen fratris
sui, shall succeed in the name of his brother: therefore it may seem they were
called after the elder brothers name.

To succeed in the name is to succeed in the place, and Jonathan paraphraseth
it, exurget in haereditate nomine fratris, to continue his name, but not to be
called after his name.

There were two sorts of brothers amongst the Jews, natural brethren and
legal brethren; the natural brother was bound to raise up seed to his eldest
brother; the elder first, and if he died, then the second, and then the third,
etc. Mat. 22. And if they did not, then they were punished and disgraced; but
those who were legal brethren, or cousin-germanes, as N. was to Machlon, they
were not compelled to marry them, but if they did not, there was some disgrace
put upon them, but not that great disgrace which was put upon the natural
brother. If a cousin-germane, or a legal brother had married his cousines
wife, the children which he begot upon her, were not called his children, but
his cousines children; even as the children which the natural brother begat,
were not his children but his elder brothers, and therefore N. says, Ruth 4.
6. I cannot redeem it, lest I mar my own inheritance; that is, these
children begotten upon Ruth should not be called my children, but my kinsmans,
and so all that I inherit should go to them.

The conclusion of this is; the Holy Ghost here marketh

CHAPTER XXXIII. Of their Marriages.
IVDG. 14. 7. And he went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased
Sampson well, and after a time he returned to take her.
THey had their Sponsalia de futuro, and de praesenti; de futuro, as Lots
sons in law were but affianced to his daughters, they were not as yet
married, (...) accepturi filias cius.
[ Lokehhe benathau] accipientes uxores, should be interpreted, Brevi post
accepturi, for they knew not as yet a man, Verse. 8. So Deuteronomy. 20. 7. What is
there that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her. So Joseph and Marie
were affianced, see Deuteronomy. 22. 24.

Betwixt their affiance and their marriage there intervened a time. Judge. 14.
7. And he went down and talked with the woman. This was for the affiancing;
and Verse. 8. After a time he returned again to take her; that is, to marry
her: the first time that he went down he killed the Lion; and the second time
when he went down to the marriage, he found honey in the Lions belly. After
some days, cannot be understood of a year, that a whole year intervened
betwixt their affiancing and their marriage; when the word Dies, is put When
the word [ Day] signifies a year, and when a month.
in the plural number, and some less number following it, then it signifies
a year, and the less number signifies months; as Genesis 24. 55. Let her abide
with us days or ten; that is, a year of days, or at the least ten months.
So 1 Samuel 27. 7. David abode with the Philistims days and four months; that
is, a year of days and four months; so Ezekiel. 1. 1. in the thirtieth year,
in the fourth, in the fifth of the month; that is, in the fourth Days
absolutely set down in the Scripture signify an infinite time.
month, in the fifth day of the month; but when days are put alone, they
signify an indefinite time, and not an year; so Genesis 40. 4. Fuerunt dies in
custodia, that is, a certain time; so Lev 28. 29. He shall redeem it within
days, that is, within the time that he and the man to whom he had morgaged the
house agreed upon. So Judge. 14. 8. After days he returned to take her, that
is, after a few days, and not after a whole year; the preparation of a whole
year, was enough for a Kings marriage.

Sponsalia de praesenti, were, when he said I take thee to my wife in the
present.

The time of their marriages was in the night, Mat. 25. 6 At midnight the
Virgins came to wait for the bridegroomes returning with their Lamps in their
hands; so Luke 12. 36.

Marriages of old were made three manner of ways, the first was called
Vsucapio, the second, consarreatio, and the third was called coemptio.

Per usum, vel usucapio, when a man married a maid Per usum, vel usucapio.
which had stayed almost a year with him; the example which most resembles
this in the Scripture, was that Per confarreationem.
of David, when he was old he took Abishaig to him, 1 King. 1. 2.

Per confarreationem, when the bridegroom married Brissonius de ritu nuptiarnm.
the bride, the bridegroom took a Cake of bread, and brake it betwixt him and
the bride, or some Corn, and put betwixt their hands; to signify that they
were to break bread, and to live together in mutual society; Hosea alludeth
to this form, Cap. 2. 3. I bought her for Allusion.
an Homer of Barley. So Jesus Christ the husband of his Church, married her per
confarreationem, putting the bread in her hand, and marrying her to himself in
the Sacrament, to signify that he would dwell with her for ever.

The third sort was per coemptionem, for it was the Per coemptionem.
manner of old, that the bridegroom bought the bride for so much, and the
bride gave little or no dowry to the bridegroom; so the sons of Sichem
bought Dina, Genesis 34. 12. Ask me never so much dowry and I will The man gave
the dowry and not the woman.
give it: so David bought Michol, Saul's daughter for so many foreskins of the
Philistims, 1 Samuel 18. 25. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. The bride
brought only Donationes, vel paraphernalia, as chains, bracelets, Genesis 24.
but the dowry which they gave was but a small thing, 1 King. 9. 16. it is said
that Pharaoh took Pharaoh giving Gezar to Solomon, it was a present and not a
dowry.
Gezar from the Philistims, and gave it to Solomon for a present, it should not
be translated for a dowry. Exodus 22. 17. He shall pay money according to the
dowry of Virgins; which is but a little sum, fifty shekels, Deuteronomy. 22. 29.
Thus Christ bought his spouse with his blood, Act. 20. 29. she was a poor
Damsel, and had nothing to give.

As their marriages were made by one of these three Marriages dissolved after
the same manner they were made.
Ceremonies, per usum, confarreationem, and coemptionem; So amongst the
Romans, the marriage was dissolved after Vsurpatio. Diffarreatio. Renuncipatio.
the same manner. The first was dissolved usurpatione, if the woman whom he had
married (being his maid before) had stayed but three nights from her husband,
then by the Roman law he might put her away; the second was dissolved
diffarreatione, they brake bread and so departed; the third was dissolved
renuncipatione, they took their hands asunder and so departed; this the
Greeks called (...), and the Latins, Divortium.

The Ceremonies which they used in their Marriages (...) Postulationes
Sponsaliorum, Sponsalia sacra ob matrimonium.
were these; first, he put a Ring upon her finger; the Hebrews called this
[Tebhignoth Kedushim] and he said, be thou my wife according to the law of
Moses and of Israel, and this he did before witnesses; this was called
Subarrhatio, this Ring was put upon the fourth finger of the left hand, because
a vein comes from the heart to that finger, as the Physicians say.

The day when the bride was married, she took the veil off her face, this
was called (...), and the gifts which were given that day, were called (...);
before she was married, she put a veil upon her face, and this was called
(...), and the gifts which were given to her before the marriage were called
(...).

The solemnities in the marriages were these; first, Diverse solemnities used at
the marriage.
they put a crown upon the head of the bridegroom, and then upon the bride,
and the crown was made of Roses, Myrtle, and Ivy, and the mother of the
bridegroom put this crown upon his head. Cant. 3. 11. Go forth, O ye
daughters of Sion, and behold King Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother
crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his
heart.

This crown wherewith the bride and the bridegroom were crowned, was but a
corruptible crown; but that crown, which we shall get in the life to come,
(...) non pollutus, est and nomen gemmae sic dictae quod in ignem conjectae non
consumatur.
fades not, nor falls not away, 1 Pet. 1. 4. (...) is a precious stone,
which if ye cast it in the fire it never consumes; so (...) flos amoris, a
flower that never fades. (...) immarcessibilis, nunquam marcescens, flos
quidam sic dictus quod non marcescat.


In their marriages they had those who accompanied the bridegroom, and they
were called Socij sponsi, the children of the wedding; and the Greeks (...) or
(...) a (...), circuire. All the time of the wedding they might do nothing but
attend the bridegroom, they might not fast in the time of the marriage nor
mourn, Mat. 9. 15. Can the children of the wedding mourn so long as the
bridegroom is with them?

He who chiefly attended the bridegroom was called Who was the bridegroomes
friend.
(...), such a one was he to whom Sampsons wife was given, who was called his
companion, the Chaldie called him [ Shushebhinah] Pronubus or auspex; this was
(...) Pronubus, Auspex.
not a friendly part in Sampsons companion to take the bride from him, for he
that has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom which
stands and hears him, rejoices greatly, because of the voice of the
bridegroom, Ioh. 3. 29. So in the spiritual marriage the Preachers who are
Auspices or Pronubi, should not seek the bride to themselves, seeking
themselves and their own praise, but let the bridegroom have the bride.

They who were (...), brought the bride into What was the chief office of the
bridegroomes friend.
the tent of the bridegroomes mother, to fignifie now that she should be in
that same place that his mother was in, Genesis 24. 67. They brought her into the
tent of Sara, and so the bride brought the bridegroom into her mothers
chamber, Cant. 3. 4. I held him and would not let him go, until I had brought
him to my fathers house, and to the chambers of her that conceived me; she
brought him into her mothers tent, to signify that she should leave father and
mother and cleave unto her husband.

They did two things after the marriage, first they blessed them, and then they
sang (...), a marriage song, rejoicing for their marriage.

First, they blessed them, Ruth 4. 11. All the people that The manner of
blessing the bridegroom.
were in the gates, and the Elders said, we are all witnesses; and the blessing
was this, the Lord make the woman that is come into thine house, like Rachel
and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel, and do thou worthily
in Ephrata, and be thou famous in Bethlehem: This was the blessing given to the
bride. And again, Verse. 12. Let thy house be like the house of Pharez (whom
Tamar bare unto Judah) of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young
woman: This was the blessing which they gave to the bridegroom.

They prayed, the Lord make thee like Rachel; it was The explanation of the
blessing.
their manner in their blessings to allege the examples of those who had been
happy and prosperous, and so when they cursed any body, they brought forth the
example of the most wretched and miserable creatures, Ierem. 30. 21. The Lord
make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the King of Babylon roasted in the
fire; such was the curse pronounced against the adulterous woman, Number. 5. 2.
The Lord make thee an oath and a curse among thy people.

The Lord make thee like Rachel and Leah: Why like Why Rachel and Lea are
taken for examples in the blessing.
Rachel and Leah? Because these two came out of their Country with their
husbands, and left their Parents, so did Ruth with Naomi to get a husband;
secondly, like Rachel and Leah, because these two sought children of their
husbands modestly, Genesis 30. 1. and verse. 16. So did Ruth of Boaz. Thirdly, why
like Rachel and Leah, and not like Bilhah and Zilpah? Because these two were
but handmaids, and they were not the mothers of many children, as Rachel and
Leah. Fourthly, why first like Rachel and then like Leah? Because Rachel was
more beloved than Leah. Fifthly, why like Rachel and Leah, and not like Sara and
Rebecca? Because there came of them the Ismaelites, who were not of the Church,
as well as the Israelites.

Do thou worthily in Ephrata: in the Hebrew it is fac To do worthily is to
do virtuously.
virtutem; the Hebrews put virtue for the substance gotten by virtuous doing,
Psalm. 49. He shall leave his substance behind him; in the original it is, he
shall leave his virtue behind; and Prove. 31. Fecerunt potentiam, id est,
compararunt opes.

Let thy house be like the house of Pharez; because there were five families in
the Tribe of Judah, and Pharez was the chief of them, Number. 26. 20. They pray
then first that they may have children; secondly, that they may have means to
maintain and bring up their children; and thirdly, that they may live in
credit among their people.

After the marriage they did sing epithalamium, a song What song they sung
after the marriage.
of praise in commendation of the Bridegroom and Brid, Psalm. 45. so Psalm. 77.
your virgins were not praised, that is, they were not married: and the house of
marriage the Jews called it [ beth hillel,] domus laudis.

The morrow after the marriage the Bridegroom came forth out of his
bride-cha^ber in great pomp with his Bride, out under the veil; and these who
heard his (...)
voice rejoiced because then the marriage was consummated: and David alludeth
to this, Psalm. 19. for as the Bridegroom made glad the hearts of his friends
when he came out of his Tent or covering; so the Sun when An anologie betwixt
the Sun rising and the Bridegroomes coming out of his chamber the morrow
after his marriage.
he comes out of his chamber gladdeth the earth: his going out is from the
end of the heaven, and his circuit to the end of it. Luke 1. Christ is called
(...), the Sun rising from the East, that Sun of righteousness coming out
of the bosom of his Father, and out of his bedchamber rising in the East, did
shine upon the Jews in the South, and next upon us Gentiles in the North,
Cant. 7. 9.

The conclusion of this is. We are married to Jesus Conclusion. 1.
Christ per confarreationem, when he gives us the blessed Sacrament, therefore
let us come worthily to it, that we take it not as Judas did the soppe, Ioh.
13. for that will make diffarreationem, or (...), a divorce from him for ever.

Secondly, we are married to him per coemptionem, Conclusion. 2.
what was the Church when he married her? She was black like the Tents of
Kedar: Miriam and Aaron grudged against Moses because of the Ethipian woman
whom he had married Numb. 12. 1. so was his Church Cant. 1. 5. I am black, but
yet if she had been rich, which is a second beauty, it had been something;
but being both black and poor, there was a hard matter for the Lord to marry
her. A certain woman being asked what dowry she gave to her husband, she
answered that she should keep her self chaste unto him only, as a chaste
spouse. So we having nothing to bestow upon him, but he having pity upon us
when we were naked and uncomely, let us study to meet him with hearty
affection again, and not to fall a whoring after other gods, which if we do
he will make us comely as the curtains of Solomon.

Thirdly, they sung praises and rejoiced at the marriage Conclusion. 3.
of the Bridegroom and the Bride. So let us be glad and rejoice, and give
honor unto him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made
her self ready, Revel. 19. 7.

CHAPTER XXXIIII. Whether a brother natural (to keep the Tribes
distinguished) might marry his brothers wife or not in Israel, or is it meant
only of the next kinsman?
DEVT. 25. 5. If brethren dwell together, and one of them have no seed, etc.
THe Law is given first to natural brethren, and not to kinsmen only: for the
Text says, if brethren dwell together, and one of them die and have no child,
now what brethren dwelt together? are they Numerus cardinalis pro ordinali,
vnus pro primo: as the evening and the morning was one day, that is, the first
day. Genesis 1.
not natural brethren: and one of them have no seed, that is, if the eldest of
them have no seed, vnus pro primo.

And that it is meant of natural brethren, see it by the practice of the
people of God, for when Er died Onan was bound to raise up seed to him, Genesis
38. 9. So Ruth 1. when Machlon the elder brother died without children, The
second brother was to marry his eldest brothers wife.
then the inheritance came to Chilion. And when Chilion died without children,
then his Uncle his nearest kinsman was to succeed; and last the brothers
children or cousin-germans, and he who was to succeed in the inheritance, it
was he who was bound to marry his brothers wife: wherefore the Law means
first of the natural brother, and if there were no natural brethren, then the
cousins or next kinsmen were to do this duty.

When the Sadduces propounded the question to Christ, that seven brethren
married one wife; it is meant of seven natural brethren, see Tobit 3. 8. And
where it is said Deuteronomy. 25. 5. the wife of the dead shall not marry with a
stranger, what is that, with a stranger? That is with one who is not of the
family of him who is dead. And first she was bound to marry with the natural
brother, who was not a stranger, and if there had not been a natural brother,
then with the next of the kinsmen, who was not a stranger. Wherefore ijbbam and
(...) are understood first of the natural brother, and then of the next
kinsman.

But it is promised under the Law as a great blessing, Israel. But if the
brother married his brothers wife, then his children were not called his
children, but his eldest brothers children, and so his name was blotted out in
Israel: and so he might have set up a pillar as Absalon did for continuance of
his name, because he had no children of his own.

But to have the name of Jesus Christ continued is a To be the father of Jesus
Christ according to the flesh, a greater blessing to the second brother, then
to have children of his own.
Psalm. 72. 19. coram sole filiabitur nomen ejus per successionem filiorum, we
see what befell Onan because he refused to do this duty, h^e said the seed
should not be his, therefore the Lord slew him, Genesis 38. 9. 10.

But God expressly forbad in his Law, that a man should lie with his wives
sister, and by the same Law it

God indeed forbad in his law that a man should lie God has many exceptions
from his own Law.
but God who gave that law, has given this law also. And as the Jews say, qui
observare jussit Sabbatum, is etiam jussit profanare Sabbatum. So the Lord who
forbad a man to lie with his brothers wife, has reserved this privilege to
himself to make an exception from the law. The Lord commanded in his Law Deuteronomy,
24. 4. If a man put away his wife and she go from him, and become another
man's wife, he may not take her again to wife; yet the Lord took his Church
again Ier. 3. 1. he has reserved sundry privileges to himself and
exceptions from the Law*

Secondly, we must distinguish here betwixt these Morale positivum. Div^^um
positivum.
laws which are moral positive laws, and these which are divine positive
laws. Moral positive laws are such, We must distinguish betwixt the moral
positive part of the Law, and the divine positiu^ part.
which the very light of nature commands. Divine positive laws are these,
which are accessory commandments added to the first. Example. This is a
moral positive law, that a man should not lie with his mother, no^ with his
mother in-law; for this is a fornication that is not named amongst the Gentiles,
1 Cor. 5. 1. And it was for this sort of incest that the Cananites were cast
out of Canaan. So this is primarium jus naturae, or morale positivum, that a
man should not lie with his daughter, nor his daughters daughter, descendendo
descending downward. But this again is divinum positivum, or secundariu^ What
is prim^rium, and what is secundarium ius naturae.
jus naturae* in the collateral line that a man should not lie with his sister
or his brothers wife, no marriage in the collateral line was forbidden at the
first by the law of nature, or moral positive law, but it was forbidden
afterward by the divine positive law, Levit. 18. 16. When Judah lay with his
daughter in-law, this was incest in the highest degree, because it was contrary
to jus natural, or morale positivum. So when the Corinthian lay with his
mother in-law, it was against morale positivum, or jus natural. But when Amram
married Iochabed (...) Amita, it should not be translated Pat^^^lis his
cousin-german but, his fathers sister. See Number. 26. 59.
his fathers sister, Exodus 6. 20. this was not against the moral, positive, or
natural part of the Law, because it was not in the right line, but in the
collateral, although in the nearest degree, it was against the divine positive
law.

And for to replenish his Church with people, God ov^rsaw this sort of marriage
at the first. But God does more here, he commands the brother to raise up
seed to his brother. First this is not contra primarium jus naturae, because it
was not in the right line. Secondly it is an exception from secundarium jus
naturae: for when God willed them to do this, he willed them not to do this
to satisfy lust, for that was contrary to primarium jus naturae, but only
that the elder brother might be a type of Jesus Christ, who should never want
a seed in his Church. If a woman were barren, the Lord could not command
another man to go in unto her and beget children upon her, for that were
contra primarium jus naturae; the Lord will not suffer now that a brother
should marry a sister, as he did in the beginning of the world, neither if a
brother now should marry his eldest brothers wife were it lawful, for now the
eldest brother is not a type of Christ, and it should not be an exception from
the Law, but contra secundarium jus naturae.

The conclusion of this is. God who gives the Law

CHAPTER XXXV. Of their prisons and places of punishment.
GENESIS 39. 20. And Joseph's Master took him, and put him into the prison: a
place where the Kings prisoners were bound.
THey had sundry sorts of Prisons; first, they had Of their place of punishment.
Warding, as Shimei was confined not to come over the brook Kedron; and,
Abiather in Anathoth, and he who killed casually was confined in the Three
sorts of Prisons among the Jews.
City of Refuge; this was a free sort of Prison, at the first Carcer non erat
pars paenae, the Prison was not a part of the punishment.

Secondly, they had another sort of Prison, in which they were more restrained
than in the Ward, they were kept in Prison, but others had access to them, as
when John was in Prison, his Disciples had access to him; so Paul was in
bonds, but yet he begot Onesimus in his bonds, Phil. 1.

Thirdly, they had a more strait Prison called (...), Custodia, a close Prison.

And fourthly, they had a deep or a low pit; the Greeks called it Barathrum
in Athens, and at Rome it was called Tullianum; such was that Prison in which
Jeremy was let down with cords in a Dungeon, where was no water but mire,
Iere. 38. 6. And Zachary alludeth Allusion.
to this, Zach. 9.. 11. As for thee also by the blood of thy Covenant, I have
sent forth thy Prisoners out of the Pit wherein is no water.

There were some Prisons within the City of Jerusalem, See Nehem. 3. 25.
and some without the City; within the City, as the house of Jonathan, which
was near the Kings Palace, Some Prisons within, and some without the walls of
Jerusalem.
Iere. 37. 15. So the Dungeon of Malchior, the son of Hammelech, Iere. 38. 6.
So they had Prisons without the gate, as that Prison wherein Peter was put,
Act. 12. 10. And when they had passed the first and the second Ward, (that is,
the quaternions of Soldiers that kept him) they came unto the iron gate that
leads unto the City: this Prison was without the gate near Mount Calvarie,
and it was the loathsomest and vilest Prison of all, for in it the thieves who
were carried to Calvarie to be executed were kept. And Christ alludeth to this
Prison, Allusion.
Mat. 25. 30. Cast him into utter darkness, where there shall be weeping and
wailing, and gnashing of teeth: which Allusion could not be understood, unless
there had been a dark Prison without the City, where was utter darkness.

Now let us compare Ezechiels Ward, Cap. 4. Ieremies A difference betwixt three
sorts of Prisons.
Prisons, Iere. 37. and 38. and Peter's Prison, Act. 12.

Ezechiel when he was warded in his own house by These things were not done in
vision but really, for when he says a thing was done in vision, he says, in
similitudine only.
the Lord, Cap. 3. 24. First, he was commanded to stay in his own house;
secondly, he was commanded to lie three hundredth and ninety days upon his
left side, Cap. 4. 4. and forty days upon his right side, Verse. 6. Then for
his diet, he is commanded to take wheat, barley, and beans, and lentils, and
millet, and fetches, and to put them all in one vessel, and to make bread of
them, Verse. 9. there was no choice of bread here, and then to cover and bake it
with man's dung, Verse. 12. or at the least with cowes dung, Verse. 15. And for
the quantity, he should eat it by measure, twenty shekels weight every day,
Verse. 10. which was ten ounces; and his drink was by measure the sixth part of
an Hin of water, Verse. 11. which was as much as twelve eggs would hold.

Now let us see how Jeremy was handled in his Prison, Shemajah gave
commandment by a Letter to put him in the stocks, Iere. 29. 26. In the Hebrew
it is [ El-hazinok] navis sugentis, as ye would say, the ship (...)
of the sucker, they closed the Prisoner between two boords, and they gave him
some liquor in the mean time to preserve his life. So Iere. 11. 19. Mittamus
lignum in panem ejus; Chaldeus, proijciamus lignum, that is, if he will, let
him eat the stocks, he shall have no other bread* or, corrumpamus penem ejus,
the english tranlation has it, let us destroy the stalk with his bread; and
Jeremy was in a deep Dungeon where he stood in mire and clay, Iere. 38. 6. So
they used to put them in the stocks; they were at the first called Nervi,
because they were made of the sinews of beasts, and afterward they were made
of iron, Psalm. 105. 18. whose feet they hurt with fetters, he was laid in iron.

Then for Peter's Prison, it was utter darkness, without Peter's Prison a
loathsome Prison.
the City, that the stench and filthiness of these prisoners might not be
offensive to the Citizens, the most loathsome Prison of all, and the darkest
Prison, and therefore a great wonder when the light shined in it, Act. 12. 7.

There are three Prisons; first, our mothers belly, in Three sorts of Prisons.
which we are first Prisoners; and secondly, the grave; and thirdly, the Prison
of the wicked in hell.

This first prison it is a strait prison; it was a great preservation when
Jonas was preserved three days in the Whales belly, the weeds being wrapped
about his head, and the earth with her bars closed him round about, Jonah 2.
5. Yet his life was brought up from corruption; it is as wonderful a
preservation in our mothers belly how we should live, being so wrapped there
and preserved from corruption; he was but kept there three days, but man is
kept nine months.

Our second Prison is the grave, Jonas was kept in the The grave a strong
Prison.
Whales belly with jaws and teeth; Peter was kept in the Prison with four
quaternions of Soldiers; but man is kept within this Prison with a more
terrible guard, when the body is sown in corruption, in dishonor, and in
weakness, 1 Cor. 15. 43. And oftentimes with sin the greatest enemy of
all, Job 10. 11. their sins lie down in the dust with them, that is, in the
grave, this Prison keeps a man sure.

The last Prison is that of the wicked in hell; man Hell a terrible and
fearful Prison.
when he dies is said to return to his own earth. Ps. 146. 4. That is, he
has right to the earth, because he was made of the earth, and he must return
to it again; So the wicked have right to hell, it is their proper inheritance,
Judas went to his own place, Act. 1. 35.

A child when he is in his mothers belly, his first prison, although he be
wrapped up there, and closely kept, yet he has a kind and loving keeper, his
mother; but the grave is a terrible keeper and an enemy, 1 Cor. 15. 26. Yet
this enemy must render up her dead again; and even as the Whale spued out
Jonas, because he could not concoct him; so shall the grave cast up her dead
again, not being able to concoct them; but there is no redemption out of hell
the last prison: In other Prisons, men have found some mitigation and favor,
but never any in this prison. Joseph was put in fetters, the iron entered into
his soul, Psalm. 105. 18. That is, the iron cut his flesh, and came as it were
to the soul; but the Lord was with him, and extended kindness unto him, and
gave him favor in the sight of the Keeper of the Prison, Genesis 39. 21. But in
this prison the Lord is not with them, neither find they any favor in the
eyes of their Keeper; but as the Task-maisters doubled the Task upon the poor
Israelites in Egypt, and were heavy exactors over them, and said daily to
them, Get you to your burdens; so these fiends of hell are rigorous exactors
over the wicked: Jeremy when he was in a deep Prison, yet he had Ebedmelech
to intercede for him, Iere. 38. 7. but none do intercede for the wicked. Peter
was in a dark Prison, yet the light did shine about him, his fetters fell off
from him, and the Angel led him forth, and set him free; But in hell, there is
no light nor no redemption out of it.

The conclusion of this is; as Jeremy prayed unto the Zedechias, that he would
not cause him to return to the house of Jonathan the Scribe (which was the

the Lord, that he would not send us into that eternal Prison to die for ever.

CHAPTER XXXVI. Of their Whipping.
DEVT. 35. 3. Forty stripes may be given him, and not exceed.
THere were sundry sorts of punishments amongst Diverse sorts of punishments.
the Jews; first, damnum, secondly, vincula, thirdly, verbera, fourthly,
talio, fifthly, ignominia, sixthly, servitus, seventhly, mors. But they never
used to banish any, because they would not put them where there was a strange
Religion professed.

When they whipped their malefactors; first they had a respect to the offense
committed; and secondly, to the person who was to be whipped; and thirdly, to the
whip.

First, they had a respect to the offense; in simplici delicto, They had a
respect both to the person and to the offense in whipping.
they might not exceed forty stripes, but they might diminish the number of
the stripes, if the person offending had been of a weak body; Secondly, for a
double offense they might not exceed forty, but they were to give him the full
forty all at once; if a man had committed theft, and with all had added
perjurie, this was a double offense, and for this he got the rigor, full
forty.

If he had a strong body, and committed a double offense* then he got the full
forty all at one time; secondly, if he had a strong body and committed a
simple offense, then he got not the full number; thirdly, if he had had a weak
body and committed a double offense, then he got the full number, but at two
several times; but if he had been of a weak body, and committed a simple
offense, then the number of the stripes was much diminished.

Again, they considered how many stripes the offender might bear, and the
number of the stripes which the whip gave: Example, the offender is able to
bear twenty stripes, and they adjudge him to have twenty stripes; now they
give him but six blows, for if they had given him seven blows, they should
have exceeded the number prescribed, for the whip wherewith they whipped them
had three thongs, and if they perceived that he grew faint and weak, when they
were beating him, they diminished some of the number; if they ordained that he
should have twelve stripes, and observed in the mean time that he fainted not,
yet they exceeded not that number twelve, which they had ordained to give him
at the first.

When they whipped Paul, 2 Cor. 11. 24. and gave him thirtie-nine stripes at
three several times; first, it seems that he has been of a strong body;
secondly, it was for three several offenses (as they thought) that they The
offender was not whipped thrice for one fault.
beat him; for if the offender had thrice committed the self same fault, then
he was no more beaten, but he was shut up within a narrow wall, wherein he
might neither sit nor stand, and there he was fed Pane afflictionis and aqua
pressurae; example, if he had eaten the fat twice, Levit. 3. 17. he was but
beaten twice; but if he had eaten the third time of it, then he was shut up in
a close prison, or such a prison in which Ahab commanded Micheas to be put, 1
King. 22. 27.

The offender was bowed down when he was beaten, Deuteronomy. 25. 2. he neither sat
nor stood, and he who whipped him, stood upon a stone, and he let out or in the
whip, by drawing up or down the knot upon it; for when the knot was drawn up,
then the thongs spread farther and gave a shrewder blow; and when the knot was
drawn down, then the thongs were contracted, and they gave the lesser blow;
when he stood behind him, then he whipped him upon the breast and belly, and he
gave him three blows at a time; and when he stood before him, he lashed him
upon the shoulders, and gave him six blows, three upon every shoulder.

There stood three Judges by when he was whipped, Three Judges stood by when they
were whipped.
the first repeated these words of the Law to him, Deuteronomy. 28. 58. If thou obey
not all these things, then the Lord shall multiply thy plagues: the second
Judge numbered the stripes; and the third Judge said to the whipper, Lay on,

He who was beaten, was not disgraced by this beating, for whipping amongst
them was but as a civil Whipping was not a disgrace amongst the Jews.
mulct, or fine, not a disgrace as it is amongst us, and therefore the Lord
said, Deuteronomy. 25. 3. That thy brother should not seem vile in thine eyes. When
they whipped any of their brethren, they did it not in scorn or derision, but in
compassion, they looked upon him, and received him after the punishment, as
their brother again: and as he who looked upon Cato Vticensis seeing him
drunk, turned away his eyes and seemed to take no notice of it, being ashamed
that such a grave man should be so overtaken; so did they behold their brethren
with pity, and were ready to cover their offense, and would not upbraid them
afterward for it.

CHAPTER XXXVII. Whether an Israelite that had lien with a bondmaide, that was
betrothed, was whipped or not?
LEVIT. 19. 20. And whosoever lies carnally with a woman that is a bond-maide,
betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed nor freedom given her, she
shall be scourged.
THe Jews did hold, if an Israelite had lien with a bondwoman betrothed, and
not redeemed, she was to be beaten, and he was to offer a sacrifice for his
offense; she was to be beaten, because she was not a freewoman, and she had
nothing to offer, and although she had, yet she could not offer it, because she
was a stranger and not converted.

The Seventie translate it (...), from [ Bakar] (...) Vapulatio erit a (...) ^^
Inquirere; but it comes from [ Bakar] Bos, because they were whipped with a
thong of oxe-leather, and some translate it Nervo bovino.

The reason why the Jews held that the woman should only be beaten is this,
because the word [ Tihieh] is in (...) The Jews held that the woman was beaten
and not the man.
the feminine gender, and they read it, she shall be beaten and not the man;
he committed not adultery, he polluted not another man's wife, nor a freewoman,
but a stranger, and a slave, therefore he was not to be beaten, but to offer a
sacrifice; but this word [ Tihieh] may agree as well with [ Bikkoreth] which is
in the feminine gender, and not to read it ipsa erit vapulatio, she shall be
beaten, but there shall be a beating, that is, they shall be both beaten, and
the man so much the rather, because he lay with her who was betrothed to
another; and the words following seem to imply so much, they shall not be put
to death; this whipping shall be a sufficient punishment for them: the Seventie
translate it (...), but Jonathan in his Paraphrase following the rest of the
Hebrews, paraphraseth it thus, Scrutatio erit in judicio ejus; ut vapulet ipsa
rea, and non ipse.

man had lien with a freewoman in Israel, then he was bound to marry her, or
else to pay her dowry; secondly, if a free man lay with a bond-maide that was
betrothed and not redeemed, then they were both whipped; but neither of them put
to death; he died not although the woman was betrothed, because she was not a
freewoman; thirdly, if a free man had lien with a free woman betrothed, then
they were both to die; fourthly, if a free man had lien with a married woman,
then they were both to die, Deuteronomy. 25. Fifthly, if a married man had lien with an
unmarried woman, they were both to die: lastly, if both the persons had been
married, they were both to die; here in cunctis nuditatibus sunt pares, vir and
faemina.

Those who are equal in sin, shall be equal in punishment.

The punishment did not expiate the sin, but the sacrifice.

The whore and the harlot are one flesh, therefore but one sacrifice for both.

CHAPTER XXXVII. De Lege Talionis, Of the Law of Retaliation.
EXODUS 21. 24. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
THe Lawyers when they interpret this Law, they Talio
Analogica. Identitatis.

say, that there is talio analogica and talio jdentitatis; and they say, that
talio identitatis should be observed, if the cause be alike, and the persons,
and the manner of doing. Example; a private man beats out his neighbors eye
in spite and malice, therefore his eye should be pulled out again; but talio
similitudinis is then to be observed: when the fact varieth in many
circumstances, as who did it, to whom he did it, etc. then talio analogica
should be observed, but not identitatis: example; if a son should beat his
father, he should not be beaten again, but he should die the death; here they
observe not medium rei, but medium personae. Example Medium
Rei. Personae.

the second, in that Parable of Nathan to David, when the rich man came and
took the poor man's sheep, 1 Samuel 12. 3. Here medium rei was not to be
observed, but medium personae, because he was a rich man. So in commutatiue
Justice we observe medium rei, but in distributive Justice we observe medium
personae.

Again, they distinguish betwixt Radamantheum jus, The strict sense of the Law
of Retaliation.
the strict sense of the Law, and (...) or (...), or reciproca paena. The
strict sense of the Law is, when literally they will have eye for eye, and
tooth for tooth; the milder sense of the Law, is, when they will have some
other satisfaction for the wrong done: the Jews generally follow this sense of
the Law, if a man did beat out his neighbors eye, or his tooth; they followed
not this Rhadamantheum ius, or the strict sense of The milder sense of the Law
of Retaliation.
the Law, that he should pay one of his own eyes, or one of his own teeth for
it, but that he should satisfy the man whom he had wronged, by paying so much
money to him; for in these cases that were not deadly, they held that they
might make recompense and satisfaction by money: and they give this instance
out of the Law; if an Ox were wont to push with his horn, and it has been
testified to his owner, and he has not kept him in, but that he has killed a
man or a woman, then the Ox shall be stoned to death, and his owner shall be
put to death, or if there be a sum of money laid upon him, then he shall give
for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him, Exodus 21. 30. 31. Here
he might redeem his life with a ransom, because he was not the direct killer,
if he satisfied the parties by giving a sum of money. So they held that they
might satisfy for such transgressions which were not capital, by paying of
money. And the law of the twelve Tables amongst the Romans says, Si unum
perfoderit unius jactura multari, The Roman Law of Retaliation.
si utrumque unius tantum ut sceleris sui notam gestare possit; and quoniam
funesta and impia manus amputari ei debet, pro manu ablata, bessis patrimonij
sui irrogatur, idque in solatium vitae ejus cui oculi sunt effossi, auferto. If
he had put out both the man's eyes, they would take but one of his eyes, and cut
the hand from him for the other eye, and then they mitigated that part of the
punishment, and they made him pay the fourth part of his substance to relieve
the man whose eyes he had put out.

The Heathen say, that Ceres the goddess of Corn, Pelops, Ceres could not set
in a shoulder of flesh and bone again, therefore the gods took the next best
course, and they ordained her to put in a shoulder of Ivorie to Pelops: so he
that had beaten out an eye or a tooth of a man, he could not put it in again;
therefore they thought it good that he should put in a shoulder of Ivorie, that
is, with his goods to maintain him whom he had hurt.

CHAPTER XXXVIII. That theft amongst the Jews, was not capital.
EXODUS 22. 1. If a man shall steal an Ox or a Sheep and kill it or sell it,
he shall restore five Oxen for an Ox, and four Sheep for a Sheep.
THeft by the Law of Moses was punished by restitution, Three sorts of Precepts
amongst the Hebrews.
paying sometimes two for one, or four for one, or at the most five for one,
and not above.

The Hebrews had three sorts of Commandments, (...) Praecepta
(...) Gravia (...) Levia. (...) Media.

Hebrews had three sorts of Commandments, first, they had [ Mitzboth
Hhamuroth] Praecepta gravia, and [ Mitzboth Kalloth] Praecepta levia: those
which they call, Praecepta gravia, here they say the punishment is always
indispensable, as the murderer is always to die the death. Secondly, they had
Praecepta levia, as not to kill the dam sitting upon the eggs; this was one of
the judicial Laws of the lightest sort, for there was no punishment in Israel
for transgression of this Law; so if an Ox had killed a man, his flesh was not
to be eaten, this was one of their judicial Laws; but if a man had eaten the
flesh of such an Ox, he was not to die for it.

Thirdly, they say, they had Praecepta media, where the punishment might be
enlarged or diminished, but not unto death, as in theft.

Affirmative commandments bind not so strictly How affirmative and negative
Precepts bind.
as Negatiues do, this is a Negative, ye shall not suffer a Witch to live,
but this is an Affirmative, that the thief shall pay fourefold or five; this
Law had sundry exceptions and mitigations, it might be extended or mitigated,
he was bound to pay fourefold, but yet the Magistrate might have mitigated
this, and taken but twofold from him; and they might have extended it further,
as Solomon extends it to sevenfold, Proverb. 6. 31. [Ieshallem
Shibhgnathaijm] he shall pay sevenfold: the Hebrews (...)
double the duall number, ten in the duall number, What the doubling of the
duall number among the Hebrews signifies.
is twenty; three is thirty; and four is forty; but when they come to
seven, here they double not. The light of the Moon shall be as the light of
the Sun, and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold; then he adds for
explanation, as the light of seven days, Esa. 30. 26. Here Shibhgnathaijm
doubleth not in the duall number, as in the former numbers, but only stands
for seven, he shall pay Shibhgnathaijm, that is, seven for one; What the
number seven signifies.
some interpret it a definite number for an indefinite, or he shall pay
sevenfold, that is, as much as two for four; but it is not the manner of the
Scriptures to take the number under seven, for seven; or he shall pay
sevenfold, that is, much more then he took; and the words following seem to
approve this interpretation, he shall pay all the substance of his house. And
sometimes this punishment was extended to death, as David's sentence was, that
he should die the death, because he took the poor man's only sheep. Some
answer that it was not for his theft that David gave out sentence of death
upon him, but for his oppression and violent theft, as if a man had come by
night, and had broken into a man's house, and had stolen any thing, then he
might have safely killed him by the Law, and he was not to die for it; but if
he had come after the Sun rose, and had stolen any thing, and the owner of
the goods had killed him, then he was to die for it.

But out of David's answer we may observe this, that The person against whom
the theft is committed aggravateth the sin.
the person against whom the sin is committed, aggravateth the sin, as for
a rich man to steal a poor man's sheep; so the time aggravateth the sin, if
the thief came in the night to steal, then the owner of the goods might
safely kill him, because of his violent theft. But it may be asked, what is
violent theft? If a man steal to satisfy his hunger, that is not violent
theft, but if a man steal who may get his living other ways, and live upon
the sweat of other men's brows, or if he steal from one that has small means
to live on, or if he have means to live upon who steals, this is judged
violent theft, and the Magistrate for this may put him to Tom. 1. 2. Municipall
Laws bind only in the Country where they are made.
death. Thomas observes well, that the Magistrate may add to the judicial
Law of Moses according to the necessity of the time, and greatness of the
offense; and as the Municipall Laws of other Countries oblige not men, but in
the Country where they are made, so does not Moses judicial Law; A Magistrate
in Israel was bound when a malefactor was whipped not to give him above forty
stripes, this Law binds not the Magistrate now, sed crescentibus delictis
exasperantur paenae, but the equity of Moses judicial Laws binds all
people; this is the equity of Moses Law, that for violent theft, a man should
always die, and the Law judged that violent theft, which is not for a man's
necessity to satisfy his life.

What if a poor man had but a little to save his life,

No doubt it were, therefore Christ says, ^hee that has two coats, let him
give his neigbour one, How Christ's words are to be understood in works of
charity.
to wit in his necessity, but not he that has one coat, for then he was not
bound to give it.

It is alleged Prove. 6. 30. that the theife should pay sevenfold,

This place proves nothing, it shows only what Jews, by their judicial
Laws to take seven fold, but it shows not what may be done by the positive
laws of other Countries.

The conclusion of this is; Now under the Gospel theft is a greater sin then
under the Law, and the necessity A difference betwixt that which is done, and
that which should be done.
is greater amongst us generally, then it was amongst them. And thirdly, that
selling of men to make restitution for things taken by theft, is not in use
amongst us, and therefore thieves may be put to death.

CHAPTER XXXIX. Of their proceeding in judgment before they executed the
malefactor.
EZEKIEL. 9. 10. Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the
forehead of those that sigh etc.
THose who were appointed to be saved amongst the people of God, he used to set

them, Exodus 12. When the Egyptians were to be destroyed, the Lord commanded
his people to sprinkle the blood of the Paschall Lamb upon the lintels of
their doors; and from this as Epiphanius marketh, the Lib. 1. cont* har. 18.
Egyptians used at the Equinoxe in the Spring, to take vermilion and to rub
over all their trees and houses with it, saying that, at that time of the year
the fire had almost burnt up all Egypt, and therefore they use this as a sign
in remembrance of their deliverance. So the Lord commanded Ezekiel to set a
mark upon those of Jerusalem that mourned, whom he was minded to save. Ezekiel.
9. 4.

But what was the reason that he set not a mark of

The reason was, God did not mark those who were to be destroyed, because of
their great number.
in respect of the handful that was to be saved, for where there was one to be
saved, there was a hundred to be destroyed; there were but seven thousand who
bowed not their knee to Baall, and of the great multitude that came out of
Egypt, only two entered into the land of Canaan. And Revel. 7. 4. of all the
Tribes of Israel there were but one hundred and forty four thousand sealed in
the forehead. And in Ieremies time it was very hard to find one that executed
judgment in all the streets of Jerusalem, Ier. 5. 1. There were a few good
men at that time, as Jeremy himself, Ebedmelech the Blackmoore, Vriah the
Prophet, and the Rechabites* But the most of the rest were naught, and if
Jerusalem had been searched few had been found in it. And this was a grief to
the Prophet Micah, which made him to complain, that he could not get a
cluster to eat, Mica. 7. 1. meaning that the good men were perished out of the
earth.

The Heathen learned this of the people of God, to mark those who were to be
saved with the letter ^tau, and these that were condemned with the letter ^
theta. It The heathen marked the condemned with theta, and them that were
absolved in judgment with ta^. Ascon. ped:
was the custom of the ancient warriors, when they returned from battle, he
who kept the register of their names, marked the names of those who returned
safe with the letter tau, and the names of those who were wanting with the
letter theta, the Latins learned this from the Grecians, the Grecians from the
Egyptians, and the Egyptians from the people of God. Persius

day, except they The Jews put not two to death in one day, but for the same

were guilty of one crime, and they give this example; If a man had lien with
the Priests daughter, he and she were not put to death both in one day, because
she was guilty of a greater sin then he, therefore she was to be burnt
quick, but he was not to be put to death that day, neither was he burnt quick
as she was.

How came it to pass then that they put Christ and the two thieves to death in
one day, seeing Christ* was

the sword, but because he made insurrection and troubled the common peace,
therefore he was to be crucified. And the Hebrews call these [ perizim]
effractores, and the Rabbis called them listin, from the Greek word (...),
they took arms to trouble the peace of the Commonwealth, and they used to
crucify all these who troubled the Kingdom and made insurrection.

CHAPTER XL. Of their Capital punishments.
JOSH. 7. 25. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire
after they had stoned them with stones.
THere were sundry sorts of punishments inflicted upon malefactors by the house
of judgment among the Jews. Some of them were burnt, some of them were
strangled, some of them were stoned, and some of them were beheaded, and some
of them were drowned.

He that lay with his mother, or daughter in law the wife of his son, or with
a maid that was betrothed, Who were stoned.
Deuteronomy. 22. 24. Or if a woman bowed down to a beast, Levit. 20. 16. so the
blasphemer, Levit. 24. 14. and Idolater, Deuteronomy. 17. 5. So he who offered his
seed to Molech, Levit. 20. 2. He that had the spirit of divination or was a
wizard, Levit. 20. 27. He that profaned the Sabbath, he that cursed his father
or his mother, Levit. 20. 9. so the disobedient son was stoned to death.
Deuteronomy. 21. 21. He that persuaded or enticed others to Idolatry, Deuteronomy. 13. 1. all
these were stoned to death.

First the Priests daughter if she committed adultery. Secondly he who lay
with his own daughter. Thirdly Who were burn.
he who lay with his sons wife. Fourthly he who lay with his daughters
daughter, or with the daughter of his wives daughter. Fifthly he who lay with
his mother in law, or with the mother of his mother in law, or he who lay with
the mother of his father in law, his wife being yet alive; even all these were
burnt. Josh. 7. 15. He that is taken with a cursed thing shall be burnt with
fire, and verse. 25. all Israel stoned him with stones, first he was stoned, and
then burnt.

Those who killed were beheaded, and those who fell Who were beheaded.
away to Idolatry.

The fourth sort of punishment was strangling; which was Who were strangled.
the lightest sort of punishment capital among the Jews. First he who did
strike his father or his mother. Secondly he who stole a man in Israel. Deuteronomy.
24. 7. Thirdly any old man who hearkened not to the voice of the Synedrion.
Fourthly a false Prophet; and he who lay with another man's wife. Fifthly, he who
defiled the Priests daughter; all these were strangled. And the Jews say,
wheresoever this punishment is set down, let his blood be upon his own head,
it is to be understood of stoning; but where the phrase is found, let him die
the death, and the punishment not set down in particular, then it is to be
understood of strangling. But this holds not, it is said Exodus 21. 12. he
that smites a man that he die shall surely be put to death: so it is said,
that the adulterer shall die the death, yet he was not strangled but stoned.
Ezekiel. 16. 40. Ioh. 8. 45.

This strangling the Romans changed into crucifying, (...) crucifigere (...)
Crux. (...) Arbor. (...).
which was called [ zacaph] crucifigere, and the cross was called [ zeceph]
crux, and [ gnetz] arbor, and the Greeks called it (...) lignum geminum.

Lastly drowning, Mat. 18. 6. It were better that a millstone were hanged about
his neck, and that he were drowned (...) dimersio in pelagus, submersio.
in the midst of the Sea; and the Greeks had (...), they were put in a chest
of lead, and sunk in the Sea, as Casaubon shows out of Athenaeus.

What sort of punishment is meant Genesis 17. 14. he that (...) Excisio.
is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people?

The Hebrews expound this sort of punishment diversely, Kimchi says, he shall
be punished by the Lord, but he adds, that he is much mistaken who thinks
that the child not being circumcised is secluded from the life to come. Moses
Cotzensis thinks, that these who were not circumcised the eight day, should
dye without children, alluding to that place Levit. 20. 20. But all of them
agree in this that the punishment is inflicted by the Lord.

Exodus 31. 14. Whosoever does any work on the Sabbath day he shall be cut off
from his people, and be surely put to death, by cutting off here is meant,
cutting off by the Magistrate, why should it not then be so understood in that
place Genesis 17. 14. so Levit. 20. 6. If any go after wizards, I will set my
face against him, and cut him off; by cutting off here is meant, to be cut off
by the Magistrate, why is it not so then to be understood in that place of
Genesis before mentioned?

Maymone answers to these places, distinguishing Levit. 17. 10. and 21. 6. I
Difference betwixt these two phrases, I shall cut off etc. and thou shall cut
off etc.
shall cut off that soul, and thou shall cut off that soul; Exodus 22. 18.
thou shall not suffer a witch to live, but when he says, I will set my self
against that soul which eats blood, and will cut him off from my people,
then it is meant, that by his own hand immediately he will cut him off.

But what sort of cutting off by the hand of God is

It is not meant of any bodily punishment inflicted upon their bodies, or upon
their posterity, as the Jews interpret it, but of excommunication and
secluding them from the Church. So Calvin, Iunius, Deodati expound it.

CHAPTER XLII. Why they gave wine to those who were going to be executed.
PROVE. 31. 6. Give wine unto those that be of an heavy heart.
THey used to do three things to them who were condemned. First, they gave
them wine to drink to comfort them. Amos 2. 8. They drunk the wine of the
condemned in the house of their God; that is, they drank the most excellent
wine, for such wine they gave to the condemned. Secondly, they used to apply
(...), soft wool, which the Chirurgians apply to wounds to mitigate their
pain, because their death was a lingering death. Thirdly, they used to hold
odoriferous canes or reeds to their nose to refresh their brains.

But see what miserable comforters the Jews were to Christ, Luke says* (...),
they derided him, Luke 23. 35. for in stead of wine, they gave him vinegar and
gall to drink, which was a most bitter sort of drink; and the Lord says Ier.
9. 15. I will feed this people even with wormwood, and give them water of gall
to drink. And for (...) they gave him (...), hysope tied about a reed and
dipped in vinegar, and they gave it him not to quench his thirst, but to smell
it in derision.

They gave him wine to drink mingled with myrrh, but he received it not,
Mark. 15. 23. Christ would not drink this cup mingled with myrrh (for it
intoxicated the brain) that he might be sensible of the pain which he was to
suffer for us. It is a great judgment to be beaten and not to feel it, Prove.
23. 35. The Lord who went willingly to death, did willingly drink the cup of
Gods wrath for us; and therefore he was unwilling to drink this cup, which
would have made him senseless of the pain.

They gave him hyssope in stead of wool which should have mitigated his pain,
the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. Prove. 12. 10.

Christ suffered in all his senses, in his taste, they gave him veneger mixed
with gall; in his feeling, whereas they should have applied soft wool, and
bound up his wounds, and mitigated his pain, they applied but hysope so in his
hearing, he heard their bitter mockes and scoffing. And as he felt the grievous
pain of the cross in all his senses, so the wicked shall suffer the pains
and torments of hell in all their senses.

The conclusion of this is, sin is sweet in the beginning, but bitter in the
end; Adam did eat asweet fruit, but the lips of a strange woman drop as an
honey comb, and her mouth is smoother then oil, but her end is bitter as
wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword, Pro. 5. 3.

They give him hysope; hysope was the last purgation and sprinkling when the
leper was brought into the Camp again: and David alludeth to this, Psalm. 51.
wash me with hysope. So Christ's death must purge us from all our sins, and
bring us into the society of the Saints of God, that there we may dwell for
ever.

CHAPTER XLIII. Of their VVarres.
DEVT. 20 10. When thou come near to a City to fight against it, then
proclaim peace unto it, etc.
FIrst let us consider in their wars, the time when they went to battle;
secondly, the manner how they pitched about the Tabernacle; thirdly, the manner
how they marched when the Camp removed; fourthly, the Proclamation made to them
at their removing; fifthly, the conditions of peace offered to the enemy;
sixthly, what they did before they joined battle; and lastly, the song which
they had after the victory.

First, what time they entered to be Soldiers? the The time that thev entered to
be Soldiers.
Levites entered to their Ministry when they were thirty years, Number. 4. 42.
But the Soldiers entered when they were twenty years, and they left off when
they were fifty; none went to the wars but they who paid the half she
kell; the Levites were exempted, because they served the Lord in the
Tabernacle, they neither paid this half shekell, nor yet went to the wars.
Women likewise were exempted, She that tarrieth at home, divides the spoil,
Psalm. 63. 12. So were the weak, sick, and infirm, the young, and the old
under twenty and above fifty; so the captives, and Idolaters, all these were
exempted, none of them paid the half shekell, or went to the wars.

Secondly, when they pitched about the Tabernacle, they pitched their Tents
with their faces toward it, Number. 2. 2. because of the respect that they
carried to it. They pitched round about the Tabernacle when they rested in
their Tents; and David alludeth to this, Psalm. 76. 11. Let all that be about
him, bring presents unto him that ought to be feared; there were three Tribes
upon every quarter; Judah, Issachar, and Zabulon upon the East; Ruben, Simeon,
and Gad upon the South; Ephraim, Manasse, and Benjamin upon the West; Dan,
Asher, and Nephthali upon the North, Number. 23. 10. Who can number the fourth
part of Israel? Here is an allusion to the Camp as it was divided in four
quarters.

There were three Tribes on every quarter, and a space betwixt them and the
Tabernacle, and Moses and Aaron and the Priests upon the East; the Coathites
upon the South; the Gersonites upon the West; and the Merarites upon the North;
these lay betwixt the Tribes and the Tabernacle to watch the holy place; So
betwixt Gods throne and the four and twenty Elders compassing it, were four
living creatures full of eyes, Rev. 6. 10.

In the first place Judah pitched and removed first, The priviled^e. Iud^h.
Judah got the first place, of him the Kings were to come, he marched first, he
sacrificed first, Numb. 7. 12. Judah gave a Lion in his Colors. Themistocles
said, it was better to have a Lion to be a Captain to a company of Hearts, than
to have a company of Lions and a (...) Catulus leo (...) Leo ^ v^^s. (...) Leo
cord t^s.
Heart to be their Captain: The Lion is first [ Gur] Catulus Leonis; then he is
[ Cephir] cum incipit praedari, when he begins to catch the prey, and then
he is [ Labhi] when he grows old. First, Judah was the Lions When Judah was
the Lions whel^^, h^ Lion, and the ^ierce Lion.
whelpe in Ioshuah's time, Josh. 1. when they went out first to Conquer the
Land; then he was Cephir in David's time; and thirdly, he was [ Labhi] Cordatus
Leo in Salomons time.

And in placing of these Tribes, ye shall observe that always wit^ ^he feebler
Tribes there is a warre-like and a courageous Tribe placed, as with Issachar
and Zabulon two feeble Tribes, Judah is placed; Issachar was A warrelike Tribe
placed with the more feeble.
dull like the Ass, and loved to co^tch between two burdens, Genesis 49. 14. So
Judge. 15. 16. Why abodest thou amongst the sheep-folds, to hear the bleating
of the flocks (...) Sibilare.
( or delighting to whistle by the flocks) having no mind to help thy
brethren in the wars. Zabulon had no skill in the wars, he dwelt by the
Seaside, and gave himself only to shipping, therefore Judah was joined to
help these two weak Tribes; so in that vision, Esa. 21. 7. The Ass and the
Camel are joined together; the Camel signifying the Medes, the more generous
people, and the Ass the Persians, the more dull people.

In the second company was Ruben, Simeon, and Gad; Ruben unstable as water,
Genesis 49. 4. So Simeon a weak Tribe divided in Jacob and scattered in Israel,
Genesis 49. 7. now to help these they had the warre-like Tribe of Gad joined with
them, Genesis 49. 19. Gad jedud jegudennu (...) Elegans paranoma^ia.
vehu jagud gnakabh, Gad a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at
the last: the men of Gad, were mighty men of war, and had faces like Lions,
1 Chronicles. 12. 8.

In the third company were Ephraim, Manasse, and Benjamin, and Ephraim the
most warrelike of the three, Ephraim had skill to handle the Bow, Psalm. 78. 9.
but Benjamin was [ Ittorjad] he could sling with both the hands. (...)
Ambidexter.
1 Chronicles. 12. 2.

In the fourth company were Dan, Asser, and Nephthali; and of these three, Dan
was the most valiant: Zabulon and Nephthali were a people that jeoparded their
lives unto the death, Judge. 5. 18. but Dan was their Captain, he came in to
save the tail of the host, and he was called the gathering host; and the
Lord alludeth to this form, Esa. 51. 11. I will go before you and gather you
in: they left none of the weak behind them, Number. 12. 15. and Miriam was shut
out of the Camp seven days for Leprosy, and the people journeyed not, till
Miriam was brought in again: David alludeth to this, Psalm. 27. 10. Though my
father and my mother should forsake me, yet thou will gather me up: Amalek cut
off the tail of the Host, Deuteronomy. 25. 17. these are called the hind most of the
Host, Josh. 10. 19.

Every one of these quarters had their Captain, and Every one of the Quarters
had their Captain
he was the wisest and most courageous, for strength and counsel are for the
wars, Prove. 10. 5. 2 Samuel 23. 8. the Tachmonite, for his wisdom is [
Ioshebeang] he sat in the Council, and for his valor and courage he is called
Hadino the Eznite, that is, who delighted to lift up the spear; young and rash
youths are not fit to be Captains, such as was Alexander the Great, who ran
violently Quando animali additur geniti^us famini^^s pluralis, tu^^
significatur animal illud teuer^^ esse, Genesis 38. 7.
rather through the world, than by skill or wisdom, therefore Dan. 8. 21. he
is called Hircus caprarum, that is, a young Goat.

There were four memorable things to be observed in this Camp; first, their
order; secondly, their cleanliness, thirdly, Salus castrametantium; and
lastly, how the Lord provided meat and cloth for them.

First, the order that was in this Camp; this was Acies The order of this
Camp.
been ordinata, and God who is the God of order and not of confusion set them
in this order. Balaam saw this when he said, Number. 24. 5. How goodly are thy
Tents, O Jacob, and thy Tabernacles O Israel. As the valleys are they spread
forth, as Gardens by the River side, as the trees of Lign-aloes, which the Lord
has planted, and as Cedar trees beside the waters.

Secondly, Mundities, the cleanenesse and nea^nesse of this Camp, for the Lord
commanded them when they were to ease nature to go without the Camp, and to
take a padle with them, and dig in the ground to cover their excrements. Deuteronomy.
23. 12.

Thirdly, Salus castrametantium, there was none feeble in their Tribes, Psalm.
105. 37. and pes tuus non fuit fermentatus, thy foot did not swell these
forty years, Deuteronomy. 8. 4.

Fourthly, the Lord provided well for this Camp, The Lord provided meat and
cloths for this Camp.
both meat and cloths; meat, He rained down Manna from the heavens, and fed
them with the bread of Angels, and for their clothes they waxed not old, Deuteronomy.
8. 4. And it is most probable that their clothes did grow with them as they
grew, and their shoes waxed not old upon their feet, Deuteronomy. 29. 5. Their shoes
did grow with their feet, (...) noninveterarunt.
and it seems that the childrens clothes were made of the clothes of them who
died.

The four Captains pitched their Tents at the four corners of the Camp,
Judah pitched in the Northeast corner; Ruben in the Southeast; Ephraim on the
Southwest; and Dan on the Northwest corner. Number. 2. 2. Every man of the
children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the Ensign of their
fathers house, far off about the Tabernacle of the Congregation shall they
pitch.

Rise up, O Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered, Number. 10. 35. When they
arose to march they spread their Colors, and they said, Vexillabimus in nomine
Dei nostri, in the (...) Ve^illis utamur in nomine Dei nostri.
name of our God we will set up our Banners, Psalm. 20. 5.

They had their Colors, their Ensigns, and their Motto's.

First, their Colors; their Colors were according Their Colors were
answerable to the stones in Aarons brestplate.
to the Colors of the stones in the breastplate of Aaron: Judah gave a green
Color like the Smarag: Ruben a red Color like the Sardius; Ephraim a golden
Color like the Chrysolite; Dan gave party colored of white and red like the
Jasper.

Their Ensigns were; first, Judah gave a Lion; Ruben In their Ensigns they
had the Emblems of Beasts.
the head of a man, because he was the first borne, and the head of the
family; Ephraim gave the head of an Ox, because he was the son of Joseph,
who was called Bos Dei, Deuteronomy. 33. 17. His glory is like the firstling of his
Bullock; and Dan gave an Eagle in his Colors, because the Eagle is an enemy
to Serpents, the Serpent should not be put in his Colors but the Eagle, an
enemy to the Serpent; Dan shall judge his people, Genesis 49. 16. Dan is a Lions
whelpe, he shall leap from Bashan. Here he is commended both for his wisdom
and his strength, the Serpent does not express these two well, but the Eagle
does express them very fitly.

Thirdly, their Motto, Iuda's Motto was this; Judah is Their Motto's in their
Ensi^nes were out of the Testament of Jacob, or of the song of Moses.
a Lions whelpe, Genesis 49. 8. Ruben had this, Unstable like water, Genesis 49. 4.
Ephraims Motto was, his glory is like the firstling of his Bullock, Deuteronomy. 33.
16. Dan had this Motto, he shall be a Serpent by the way, an Adder in the path,
and so every one of the Tribes had their Motto.

The Lord as their General dwelt in the midst of their The Lord was their
General.
Camp, and his Ensigns were the Cloud and the pillar of fire; the Cloud to
direct them by day, and the pillar by night, then he was the guide of their
youth, Iere. 3. 4. The motto which they gave him was this, Mi camocha (...)
ba^lohim Iehova, quis sicut tu Iehova inter Deos; and hence they made the name
of the Macchabees, Mem, Caph, Beth, Iod: and they were called Macbei at the
first, and afterward Macchabaei: and like unto this was that abbreviation,
Agla, attagnebher legnolam adonai, Tu fortis in aeternum Domine.

When they marched, they kept not the same order Their marching was different
from their pitching about the Tabernacle.
as when they pitched about the Tabernacle, for when they marched, Judah,
Issachar, and Zabulon went before; and the Gersonites and the Merarites next
them set forward, bearing the Tabernacle, Number. 10. 17. In the second place came
Ruben, Simeon, and Gad, who lay upon the South; and next them came the
Cohathites with the Arc, Number. 10. 21. After them Ephraim, Benjamin, and
Manasse; and David alludeth to this, Psalm. 80. 2. Before Ephraim and Benjamin
and Manasseh, stir up thy strength, and come and save us; he says, before
Ephraim, for when they carried the Arc Ephraim came behind the Arc, and the
Arc was before him, and when they rested, Ephraim was upon the West side of
the Arc, which Number. 2. 18. is called [ jammah] the Sea-ward, because (...)
the Sea lay toward the West, so that the Arc both when they pitched and when
they marched was ever before Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. In the last place
came Dan, Asser, and Nephthali; Dan was in the Reareward of all their Camps
throughout their Hosts, Number. 10. 25.

When they marched Ascendebant Chamusshim, Exodus The manner of their Marching.
(...)
13. 18. Aquila and Symmachus, (...), qui quintam costam habebant cinctam,

this Prove. 30. 31. speaking of the horse girt in his loins, a warlike beast,
fit for the battle, and contrary to this is discinctus when they lay aside
their armor.

Thirdly, they made a Proclamation in the Camp, In their marching they made a
Proclamation for four sorts of people.
that he who had built a new house, and had not dedicared it, should go back:
Secondly, if he had planted a Vineyard, and had not made it common, he should
go back: thirdly, if he had betrothed a wife, and had not lien with her, he
should go back: and fourthly, they cried that all those who were fearful and
faint hearted should return.

He who built a new house, and had not dedicated it, What new house was meant
in this Proclamation.
he should go back, which they expounded thus, if he had built a new house,
either for his dwelling, or for his Cattle, or his Corn, then he was to go
back to it, but if he had built a new house for pleasure, and let it and taken
hyre for it, then he was not to go back.

Secondly, if he had planted a Vineyard and had not made it common, then he was
to go back; where there is an Allusion to that form set down in the Law,
that the first three years after that a man had planted a Vineyard, he might
not eat of the fruits thereof, then the fourth year they were the Lords, and
in the fifth year they were made common, and then turned to the planters own
use, and it was all one whether he planted the Vineyard, bought the Vineyard,
or had gotten it by inheritance or by gift.

Thirdly, if he had betrothed a wife, and had not lien with her, whether she
had been a maid or a widow, he was to return home: and this Immunitie from
the wars lasted for a whole year to those who were new married; but they
say, if the high Priest had married a widow he was not exempted, so if an
inferior Priest had married a repudiate woman, or a common Israelite if he had
married a bastard, then he was not exempted.

Fourthly, all those who were fearful and faint-hearted, Qui mollis est cord,
Hebraice, he should return, lest he make his brethrens heart faint also, Deuteronomy.
20. So all those who were guilty of any crime were sent away, All that were
known for notorious sinners, were discharged from the wars.
for sin always makes a trembling and a faint heart, but the misery is now
that the most lewd take themselves to this calling, Psalm. 68. 30. Rebuke the
company of the spearemen, Hebraice, rebuke the beasts of the reeds; the Lord
accounts those profane Soldiers for all their spears but like beasts
amongst the reeds, there are few like unto the Centurion, or Cornelius, who
have good Soldiers.

Gideon made a Proclamation, Judge. 6. Whosoever is Gideons Proclamation.
fearful, let him return, and so there remained but ten thousand; and he
tried his Soldiers again, and all that bowed down to drink he sent them
away, and he took with him only those who lapped like dogs, which were but
three hundred.

Whether made he choice of these as the most cowardly,

It is commonly holden that they were the most courageous Israel to brag
here, and to say, Mine own hand has saved me* Judge. 7. 2. The Lord would
only ^aue the whole praise of the Victory. Now whether made it more for the
praise of God, when he overcame with a few c^wards, than if he had overcome
with a number of valiant Soldiers: were not they most cowardly, who durst not
lie down to take leisure to drink? But ran and lapped as the dogs do about
Nilus; the Lord made choice of the most fearful and cowardly for his glory;
But Marcus Crassus amongst the Romans, caused to let blood of the cowards, and
he gives this to be the reason, that that blood which they would not shed in
defense of their Country, should now be shed to their disgrace and shame.

They had two sorts of wars; the first were bella There are two sorts of
wars.
spontanea, and the second was bella praecepti, new married men and those who
planted a vineyard were exempted from the first war, but not from the second
war which was against the Canaanits, the Bridegroom was not exempted from
this neither.

Fourthly, before they joined battle with the enemy to destroy them or to sack
their City, they offered conditions of peace to the enemies that were not to
be destroyed, if they sought peace of them; we have one example, in the
Cherethites, that were David's guard; they were called Curetae by Virgil,
Curetum allabimur oras: So they were called Cretenses, these came of the
Phenicians or Philistines; Creta was a Colonie belonging to them, see Act. 27.
12. Phenice which is a haven of Creet. Deuteronomy. 20. 10. And the conditions were
three especially. First, that they should receive the seven precepts of Noah:
Secondly, that they should be tributaries to them; And thirdly, that they
should be servants to them.

The Moabites and Ammonites were still excepted Deuteronomy. 3. 3. but Deuteronomy. 2. 9.
distress not the Moabites neither contend with them in battle, how then shall
we reconcile these two places, when he bids them not to seek the peace of
the Ammonite.

The reconciliation is this, thou shall not seek the Moabite or Ammonite, but
if they seek it of thee, then thou shall not distress them, nor contend with
them in battle.

If they would not receive the peace offered, then (...) Let him fl^e that will
fl^e.
they cried, dedat se qui vult, fugiat qui vult, pugnet qui vult.

Before they joined battle they comforted the Soldiers (...) he that will
have peace, let him have peace. (...) He that will make war let him make
war.
after this manner, trust in him who is the Savior of Israel in affliction,
Ier. 14. 8. this day thou fightest, pro confessione vnitatis divinae, quod deus
unus est, that thy God is one, therefore, thou may carry thy life in thy
hand securely, Job. 13. 4. and think neither upon thy wife nor thy children,
but put the care of them out of thy heart. And the Apostle allud^th to this, 2 Timothy 2. 4. Lam. 5. 9 in animae nostrae ferimus panem, id est, in perien^^
animae. so Psalm. 119 animae mea in maenu mea.
that he who goes to the wars, entangleth not himself with the cares of
this world. And they exhorted them to cast the care of their houses, wives,
children, and family upon the Lord, who will provide for them: 1 Samuel 25. 28.
29. The Lord will provide a sure house for my Lord the King, because he fights
the battles of the Lord, and his soul shall be bound up in the bundle of life.

When they marched nearer their enemy, they raised What they did when they
were at the shocke of the battle.
the dust with their feet which was the nearest sign of war: and Christ
alludeth to this form Mat. 10. When you come into a house offer your peace,
and if they refuse it, shake off the dust of your feet, and let your peace
return to your self: when the enemies were overcome, they fell down at the
Conquerours feet, and seemed to lick the dust under his feet, Psalm. 18.

And so they used to cast a firebrand within the enemies land, and the Prophet
Obadiah alludeth to this, verse. 18. there shall not one be left alive in the
house of Esau, the Seventie translate it (...), that shall carry a firebrand.
Such were those faeciales amongst the Romans, who threw a spear into the
enemies land in defiance of the enemy.

After the victory they divided the spoil, and then they sung (...), or carmen
triumphale.

It was their manner after the victory to sing a song of When the song of
triumph was sung.
praise, as Moses and Miriam did, Exodus 15. so Barak and Deborah, Judge. 5. so
David after he had conquered all his enemies sang the eighteenth Psalm, so
Revelation 19. when all the enemies of the Church shall be subdued, they shall
sing a song of praise to the Lamb who sits upon the throne.

The women especially did sing this song, and therefore The women did sing the
for^ of victory.
Psalm. 68. 11. it is said, great were the company, [hammebhassheroth,] of those
that published it, in the faeminine gender, of the women that published it.

In this song of victory the King is commended, that he ascended on high, and
led captivity captive, and received gifts or ransomes from the captives, Verse.
18. And the Apostle applies this to Christ's victory over all his enemies, he
ascended on high, and gave gifts to men, Ephe. 4. 8. And in this song of
victory, they sung this Carmen amabaeum, a song by intercourse, I will bring
again from Basan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the Sea,
Verse. 22. They remembered these two deliverances in all their songs of
thankesgiving for deliverance: first, how the Lord delivered them out of the
red Sea; and secondly, that deliverance from Og King of Bashan when he came
against them.

That song of Deborah, Judge. 5. first, contains a praise The subject of
Deborabs song.
to God, who gave the victory. Secondly, it makes mention of the instruments
which he used in this victory, as the stars. Thirdly, it condemns those who
would not come, as Merosh: and fourthly, it commends those who came
willingly. And lastly, a prayer against the enemies of the Church, Verse. 28.

CHAPTER XLIIII. Of their Burials.
GENESIS 49. 29. And he charged them and said unto them, I am to be gathered to my
people, bury me with my Fathers.
IN their burials, first, we are to consider the place The circumstances that
were used in Burial.
where they buried them; secondly, the ceremonies which they used at their
Burials; thirdly, the form of their Tombs; fourthly, the great charges that
they were at in their burials; and lastly, how they comforted the living after
the dead were buried.

First, the place where they buried them, it was commonly The place where they
used to bury.
without the City; In Jerusalem they were buried without the City near the
brook Kedron, Mat. 27. 53. And many arose, and came out of the graves, and
went into the holy City, and appeared there: so the widows son of Naim was
buried without the City, Luke 7. 12. so the possessed men walked amongst the
graves in solitary places, Mark. 4. 37. And Christ was buried in a Garden
without the City.

They buried all of one family together, 1 Samuel 3. 1. With whom they were
buried.
they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan in the burial of their Fathers: so
Genesis 33. 2. therefore they were said to be gathered to their fathers; and David
alludeth to this form when he says, gather me not with the wicked. Psalm. 30.
For all the bodies of the faithful were laid together, so are their souls
gathered together, and this is called, the bundle of life, 1 Samuel 25. The
Greeks called those who were not buried with their Fathers, (...), outburied.

They buried the man and the wife together, as Abraham and Sara in the field of
Ephron, Genesis 25. so Jacob and Th(...)full were buri(...)there.
Leah, Isaac and Rebecca, so Tobias and his wife were buried together, Tob. 4.
4. And hereby they signified the constancy and love which should be betwixt
the man and the wife, and that they died in the same faith, therefore the
Orthodoxe Church when they died they would not be buried besides Heretics;
Sophronius said, Noli me tangere haeretice neque vivum neque mortuum.

They buried strangers in a part by themselves, Act. 1. The strangers
converted, desired ^o be buried with the faithful.
18. this place they called it Kebher galaja, sepulchrum exterorum: when the
strangers were converted to the faith, they desired to be buried with the
faithful; as Ruth said to Naomi, where thou die there will I die and be
buried, Ruth 1. 17.

Secondly, they used many Ceremonies in their burial, The Ceremonies in
burial.
first, they fasted, 1 Samuel 31. 13. 2 Samuel 1. 12. and they mourned and wept and
fasted while even; so 2 Samuel 3. 34. David fasted for Abner till the Sun was
set.

Secondly, they wept, as for Aar^n thirty days, Number. 20. 29. so for Moses,
Deuteronomy. 34. 8. so for Saul and Jonathan, 2 Samuel 1. 12. so for Iosia did all Israel
mourn, 2 Chronicles. 35. 24. Families lamented, the men by themselves and the women
by themselves, Zach. 1^. 12. so Luke 23. and the women followed after weeping.
They mourned and lamented chiefly for their Kings, Iere. 34. 5. and they will
lament thee, saying ah Lord; they lamented for their King as the widow does for
her husband, for the King is the husband of the Commonwealth, and when she
wants him she is a widow, Lament. 1.

Such was the lamentation which David made for Saul and Jonathan, 2 Samuel 1. 18.
it is called there the lamentation How these words are to be understood, he
taught them the use of the Bow.
of the Bow, he commanded to teach the children of Israel the Bow, it is
commonly translated, he taught them the use of the bow, or to shoot with the
bow, but this is impertinently cast in, in the midst of David's lamentations,
that he taught them the use of the bow, but it should be this way translated,
he taught them this lamentation, entitled the Bow, for it was the manner in
old times to give sundry titles to these lamentations, as, Fistula, Scutum,
Ovum, Ala, Securis; so Psalm. 45. Eustatius lib. 4.
to the chief Musician upon Shonannim, as ye would say upon the lillies, the
song of the marriage is entitled the lilly. Christ is, the lilly of the
valleys, and his Church is as the lilly among thorns, therefore this
marriage- Psalm is entitled the lilly; so the title of this lamentation was
Arcus, the Seventie translated it well David edidit threnum hunc, and it is
subjoyned that he made this lamentation, that he might teach it the children of
Israel; and Josephus adds, that the Jews did diligently learn these
Lamentations even unto his time, the rest of this Lamentation is set down in
the Book of the just, verse. 18. and to translate it he taught them to shoot
with the bow, were not pertinent, for they had skill in the use of the bow
already, 1 Par. 12. and it was not for unskillfulness in the use of the Bow
that the Philistims overcame them. When Josias was killed in the battle,
Jeremy made his Lamentations or (...) for him. When Alexander ab Alexandro
lib. 3. Genialium.
they buried their dead they had Minstrels, Mat. 9. 23. who sang the praises of
the dead, this the Greeks called (...), and when the corpse were to be carried
out, they cried Conclamatum est; and they hired Praeficas, mourning women.
Iere. 9. 17. and when these women did sing the doleful song, she that was the
chief mourner sung over carmen (...) at every rest; the like we see in Psalm.
136. for his mercy endures for ever: so Iere. 9. 18. the chief mourner
repeated these words in the Lamentation, that our eyes may run down with
tears, and our eyelids g^sh out with waters: so Ezekiel. 26. 7. how art thou
destroyed that wast inhabited of Seafaring men.

They lamented not for their wicked Kings when they died; Herod fearing that he
should not have this honor done to him when he died, commanded when he was
about to give up the Ghost, that a number of his wisest Counselors should be
gathered together, and that his Josephus: The stratageme that Herod used that
men might lament for his death.
Guard should inviron him about, and put them all to the sword, that there
might be a lamentatio^ at his death, which they were purposed to have done,
unless that Salome the sister of Herod had prevented it, and discovered to
them the plot, and then they kept a feast of joy in remembrance of that
deliverance, as they did at Hamans death.

Thirdly, they used to wash the bodies of the dead, this was called (...), and
so they washed the body of Dorcas and laid i^ in an upper chamber, there was

they were baptized they went down into the water, and were baptized all over

(...) is to prepare all those things which serve for the embalming of the
body, and this was called a burying among the Jews, they used much this
emb^lming of the bodies before they buried them, but now because the doctrine
of the Resurrection is so clear, this ceremony of embalming should not be used.

When they embalmed the bodies of their Kings, They bu^ned sweet O. dours for
them.
they burnt sweet odours for them, as for Asa and for Zedekiah, Iere. 34. 5.
Thou shall die in peace, and with the burnings of thy fathers the former Kings,
so shall they burn Odours for thee: Although Zedekiahs eyes were pulled out of
his head, and carried captive to Babylon; yet he is said to die in peace,
because he had all these solemnities performed to him in his funerals. Those of
Iabesh Gilead took the bodies of Saul and his sons and burnt them, and
buried their bones under a tree, 1 Samuel 31. 13. To burn their bodies here is
not meant, that they burnt them to ashes, and then buried their bones, but they
burnt odours upon their bodies until they were buried; for these speeches are
all one, comburent te, as How these phrases are to be understood, Comburent te
and comburent tibi.
the L^tines say, comburent tibi, as the Hebrews say, (...), as the Greeks
say, et aromatizare, as the Evangelists say, for every one of these phrases
signify the great pomp which was used at their burials. And where it is said,
they buried their bones, it is to be understood by the figure Synecdoche, their
bodies, 2 Samuel 1. Are we not all of his bone: so Genesis 2. She is flesh of my
flesh, and bone of my bone, and this last part here is but an explanation of
the first. Iechonias wanted this honorable burial, and therefore is said, to
be buried with the burial of an Ass, Iere. 22. which was, insepulta sepultura.

The heathen burnt the bodies to ashes before they The Heathen burned them to
ashes.
buried them, because that they thought, that the fire purged the body, but
the greatest abuse of all in burning of the dead, was when the King of Moab
took the King of Ammons son, and burnt him to Lyme, and then, (as the Jews
say) with that incrustarunt muros, they plaisterd their walls.

By this we may understand why the Scripture brings in Og the King of Bashans
b^d, saying, is it not in Rabbath of Ammon unto this day? Deuteronomy. 3. 11. this was
not his sleeping bed, but his funeral bed, for when they were dead, they laid
them upon a rich bed, and burnt odours over them, until their friends carri^d
them to the grave, and then they came home and burnt the bed and things
belonging unto it. Now the reason why this bed of Og burnt not, was because it
was made of iron, so say Rabbi Isaac Abrabaneel, and Arrias Montanus.

They had funeral feasts called (...), therefore Of the feasts at their
Burials.
Ezekiel. 24. 17. when his wife died he was forbidden to eat of that bread, eat
not the bread of men; Enoshim, that is, the bread of mourning men; these feasts
they called afterward, feralia and silicernia, and they used to set the meat
upon the graves of the dead, Job. 4. 17. pour out thy bread upon the burial
of the just: so Eccles. 30. 18 as messes of meat set upon the grave.

The third thing to be considered in their burials, is the form of their
Tombs, the Kings were buried in stately Tombs together in the City of David,
and those Kings who were not buried there, were thought to be basely buried, if
they were not buried in the burial of David, or in the burial of the Kings in
Mount Sion.

The nobler sort some of them had Caves hewed out Their burials were hewed out
of a rock.
of a rock, which had several burials within them, and Christ was buried in
such a burial, Esa. 53. 9. He made his grave with the wicked, and with the
rich, [Bamathau] in (...) Excelsa eiu^.
excelsis, that is, although he was crucified with the wicked, yet he was
buried in the Tomb of Joseph, not in a base burial but an honorable burial,
which was Joseph's own burial, who was an honorable man.

The Prophets were usually buried in stately Tombs, The Prophets were also
buried in stately burials.
Iere. 26. 23. And Iehojakim sent for Vrias the Prophet out of Egypt, and
caused to s^ay him with the sword, and cast his dead body in the graves of the
common people: the Prophets were not usually buried in the burials of the
common people; so Mat. 23. 29. Woe be to you, because ye build the Tombs of
the Prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous.

For the common people they were but laid in the ground, without any Tomb,
Luke 11. 4. Ye are like graves which appear not, and the men that walk over
them are not aware of them.

They had some marks of distinction to discern the Tombs of the better sort;
example we have of this in Joshua 24. 30. it is said there, that they buried
him in Timnath-herah, but Judge. 2. 9. they buried him in Timnathheres; Here Is is
called the City of the Sun, and they (...) Sol.
changed the name of the Town, because Joshua was buried there, whose
sepulcher had the picture of the Sun drawn upon it, as the Jews write, and
the sepulcher of Elisha was known by it self in the fields, 2 King. 13. 21.

Fourthly, they were at great charges in burying of their dead, it was so great
that many times their friends refused to bury them, therefore Gamaliel who was
a man of power and credit amongst them, restrained this. Nicodemus sent for an
hundredth pound weight of Myrrh and Aloes, to embalme Christ, Ioh. 19. 39. and
Christ allows the fact of Marie, Mat. 26. 10. when she poured the box of
precious ointment upon his head, Why trouble ye the woman, for she has wrought
a good work upon me: and Gamaliel ordained that none should be wrapped in
silk, but all in linen, and no gold put upon them. So amongst the Romans they
were glad to diminish Cic^rolib. 2. de ll.
these charges, tria si velit recinia and vincula purpurea, and december tibicines
plus ne adhibeto.

Lastly, after the burial was ended they used to comfort They comforted the
living after the dead were buried.
the living after this manner; first, sit consolatio tua in Caelis; secondly,
quis audet d^o dicere, quid secisti? thirdly, they repeated these words of
Esaias. chap. 25. 8. he will swallow up death in victory, and wipe away all
tears from their faces; and Psalm. 72. 16 they shall flourish and spring again
as the grass on the earth: they b^leeved the resurrection of the body,
therefore they called the Churchyard [ Beth chaijm,] domus viventium, and as
(...) Domus viventium.
our souls lodge but a while in the body as in a tabernacle, 2 Cor. 5. 1. so
our bodies lodge but a while in the grave as in a tabernacle, Act. 2. 26.
(...), my flesh (...).
rests in hope as in a tabernacle, and then they cried, Zacor^ki gnapher
anachnu, remember that we are but dust, (...) Dominus penset jacturam tuam.
and they conclude with this of Job 1. the Lord has given and the Lord has
taken, blessed be the name of the Lord. When their little children died, they
used not many speeches of consolation, but only said, the Lord recompense thy
loss; Job has a notable saying, I came naked out of my mothers womb, and I
shall go naked thither again; How shall I go thither again? it is not taken
for the same place, but for the same condition; hence it is that the inferior
parts of the earth are called both the mothers womb and the grave, Psalm. 139.
15. I was curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth; that is, in my
mothers womb, Ephesians. 4. 9. Christ is said to descend into the lower parts of
the earth, that is, into his mothers womb, and see the affinity betwixt the
belly and the grave, Christ joyneth them together, Mat. 12. As Jonas was three
days and three nights in the belly of the Whale, so shall the son of man be
in the heart of the earth: and Solomon, Prove. 30. joyneth them together, there
are three things that are not satisfied, the grave, and the barren womb, etc.

The conclusion of this is, let us remember, Job 30. domus constitutionis omni
vivo, that is, the house in which we are all appointed to meet, and it is domus
saeculi, the house of our age in which we dwell a long time, therefore we
should often think of it, and not put the evil day far from us, and make a
covenant with death.

Of the JEWS Oeconomicks.
Of the time of their Repast.
THey had but two times of their Repast, Dinner and Supper, they had no
breakfast; Peter had eaten nothing at the sixth hour, Act. 10. 10. and Act. 2.
15. those are not drunk as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of
the day.

But it may seem, that they used to break their fast Job. 21. 4. it is said,
that when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore and said, children
have ye any meat?

The reason of this was, because they had fished all Eccles. 10. 16. Woe to
thee O land, when thy Princes eat in the morning: they did not eat in the
morning, because it was the fittest time for judging and deciding
Controversies; and therefore the Whores of old were called Nonariae, because
Persius Satyr. 1.
they came not out to commit their vill any till after the ninth hour, when
men had ended their businesses; and the Lord bids them execute judgment in
the morning, Iere. 21. 12.

The time of Dinner was the time when they refreshed themselves first. Ioh. 21.
12. Jesus said unto them, come and dine: so Luke 11. 37. And as he spoke a
certain Pharisie besought him to dine with him: and the second refreshment was
at the time of Supper; this was called (...); they spent a longer time at
Supper than at Dinner, and therefore afterward they put (...) for (...), All

had (...), a refreshment betwixt Dinner and Supper, which is called Merenda, a
beaver or afternoons drink; and they called this Caenae (...); thirdly, they
had their Supper, and then they had Banquets after Supper; and this the Greeks
called (...), Latin comessatio, (...), to keep a Banquet with whores; and
Paul alludeth to this word, Romans 13. 13. Let us walk (...) Deus Moabitarum.
honestly as in the day. (...), not in rioting and drunkenness, not in
chambering and wantonness. And because the Jews used to travail so far
before the heat of the day, therefore they called this space which they
travailed diaetam terrae, Genesis 35. 16. This shows their moderate diet.

They were sparing at Dinner, and they fed more freely at Supper; the Lord gave
them bread in the morning, and but Quails at night, Exodus 16. 12.

They went to Supper at the ninth hour, after the Evening They measured the
hours by their shadow.
Sacrifice, and before the setting of the Sun they ended it; this was called
Hesperismus; the ancient Greeks called this (...), that is, the time when a
man's shadow was ten foot in length, for they measured the hours by their
shadow, when the shadow was of such a length, then it was such an hour; when
their shadow was six foot long, then they used to wash themselves, and when it
was ten foot long, then they went to Supper.

The meat upon which they fed at Dinner and Supper was called [ Sagnadah] their
sustentation, and [ Tereph] (...) Fulcrum. a (...) Fulcire. (...) Esc^ (...)
rapere.
victus their food, which comes from the root Taraph, to take by rapine, or
hunt for the prey; because of old they hunted for their meat, Genesis 27. 3. Take
thy weapons, thy Quiver, and thy Bow, and go out to the field, and take [hunt]
me some Venison.

Things set before them upon the Table were Esculenta, What things were set
upon the Table.
poculenta, and condimenta, the first for meat, the second for drink, and the
third for sauce to relish their meat; Meat and drink the Scriptures oftentimes
express by bread and water, 2 King. 6. 22. set bread and water before them,
that they may eat and drink: then it is added in the next verse, he prepared
great provision for them.

Their bread was of Wheat, Barley, Lentils, and Beans, Of their bread.
Wheat was the most excellent bread, Deuteronomy. 32. 14. I fed thee with fat of the
kidneys of Wheat; this bread when it was not fermented, was called the poores
bread, Deuteronomy. 16 3. because the poor had not leisure to ferment it.

The second sort of bread was of Barley, which was Barley a base bread.
abaser sort of bread, used only in time of scarcity, Revel. 6. 6. And for
the baseness of it Gideon is compared to a Barley Cake, Judge. 7. 13. those
were called by the Greeks (...), eaters of Barley; this Barley-bread is a
bread which nourishes little, therefore it was a great blessing of Christ,
when he fed five thousand with five barley loaves, Ioh. 6. 9.

They had a more baser sort of bread made of Len^ils, Millet, and Fitches.
Ezekiel. 4. 9. Daniel and his companions eat of the Lentils, Dan. 1. 12. And the
reason seems to be this why they eat Lentils and refused the Why Daniel eat
Lentiles.
Kings meat, because they used not these Lentils in their Sacrifices to their
Idols. The Romans of old took their name from those, and they were called
Le^ticuli and Fabij.

They used also to eat herbs, Prove. 15. 17. Better is a dinner of herbs where
love is, than a stalled Ox and hatred therewith: and Romans 14. 2. another who
is weak eats herbs: and the reason why they would eat herbs seems to be
this, because men before the Flood eat herbs only.

Their other meats were called Opsonia, and their coursest sort of meat was
Locusts and wild honey, Mat. 3. 4. there were sundry sorts of Locusts, of
which, four sorts were clean, Levit. 11. the rest they might not eat of them.

Their drink was water, Sicera a composed strong Of their drink.
drink, and wine mixed, or (...) not mixed; if they mixed it with water, then
they were said (...), and when it was mixed with spices, it was called [
Mimsach] (...) vinum mixtum a (...) miscuit.
Libamen, mustum.

Their Condimenta, the sauces which made their meats to relish, were Salt and
Vinegar only. Ruth 2. 14. Dip thy morsel in the Vinegar.

By this which has been said, we may perceive what The spare diet of Gods
people.
was the sober diet of the people of God in old times, they used but a spare
diet; this was called by the Latins, Mensa necessaria, and Seneca hanc mensam
produxit ad aquam and panem.

There are three sorts of dyets set down in the Scripture; Three sorts of diet.
John Baptists diet, Christ's diet, and the Epicures diet: John the Baptist came
neither eating nor drinking, Mat. 11. 18. That is, he eat wild honey, and the
coursest things; Our Lord drank Wine, but yet very moderately: the Epicures
diet is, Let us eat, let us drink, for to morrow we shall die, 1 Cor. 15. 32.
John the Baptists diet and Christ's diet are not the two extremes, but they are
both virtues, the two extremes are the Epicures diet, Let us eat, let us
drink; and the diet of the scrupulous man who eats only herbs, Romans 14. 2.
the Epicure takes God to be an indulgent father to him, in giving him the
creatures to eat of them at his pleasure; and the other takes God to be a
niggard, who grants not the liberal use of the creatures to his children.

Of the manner how they sat at Table.
AT the first in the days of the Patriarchs they sat straight up as we do
now, and afterward they sat in beds; and some hold that they learned this
custom from the Persians, but this custom was more ancient than the Persians,
for it was in the days of Samuel, 1 Samuel 9. 22. And he brought them into the
Parlor, and made them sit in the chiefest place. Ezekiel. 23. 41. 2 Samuel 4. 5.

Sometimes they had triclinia, when three sat in a bed, or biclinia, when two
sat in a bed, and they had (...), when they did Luxuriare.

Christ and his Disciples when they eat the Sacrament, they sat in beds,
therefore when the Church of Corinth received the Sacrament together, we must
not think that they sat in beds as Christ and his Apostles did, for then they
should have had too many beds, which had been excessive, and contrary to the
more modest custom of the Greeks.

This kind of sitting was half sitting and half leaning, which the
Evangelist calls (...), yet because it was usual Table Gesture, they call it
sitting. Ezekiel. 23. 41. and the Hebrews call their Chambers Mesubboth, and
their sitters Mesubhim.

If three sat in a bed, then the midst was the chiefest place, and he that lay
in his bosom erat secundus a primo, he was in the second place, and he that
sat next unto him, was in the third place; he that was best beloved leaned in
the bosom of the Master of the feast; To lean in the bosom a token of love.
from this custom is that speech borrowed, to be in Abraham's bosom, to
signify that familiarity and society, which the Saints of God shall have
with the Father of the faithful in the Heaven, and also to signify the unity
of essence in the Father and the Son, he is said to come out of the bosom of
the Father, Ioh. 1. 18.

Of their Feasts.
OF their sundry sorts of feasts, of those who were invited to their feasts, of
the number of those who sat at their feasts, the end wherefore they made
feasts, and more particularly, of their excess and pomp in their feasting
compared with the Greeks.

First, they had feasts before their marriages, in their They had feasts at
their marriage.
marriages, and after their marriages; before their marriage, and these feasts
were called Kedushim, sponsalia; and the Greeks called them (...) and (...).
Secondly, they had a feast at the day of their marriage, Genesis 29. 22. And Laban
gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast; and Ioh. 2. Christ
was present at a marriage feast in Cana of Galile: and Christ alludeth to this
form, Luke 14. 8. When thou art bidden to a wedding, that is, to the feast at
the wedding; so Rev. 19. 9. And so they had a feast after the marriage; and the
Greeks called these (...), and the gifts which were brought to the bride after
she was married were called (...), because the veil was taken off her face
then, and these things which were offered to her after she was unvailed, were
called (...).

Secondly, the Jews had feasts at the weaning of their Feasts at the weaning
of their children.
children, and not at the day of their birth, Genesis 21. 8. but the Heathen had
feasts at the day of their birth, as Pharaoh, Genesis 40. 20. and Herod, Mat. 14.
16. and this was called (...).

Thirdly, they had feasts at the day of their death, Feasts at their death and
burial.
Iere. 16. 7. Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to
comfort them for the dead, neither shall men give them the cup of consolation
to drink for their father, or for their mother; thou shall not also go into
the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink: the Greeks
called th^se (...), and (...) was Epulum sepulchrale: and afterward this
feasting degenerated much, for they used to set meat upon the graves of the
dead; and Syracides alludeth to these delicates poured upon a mouth shut up,
are as messes of meat set upon a grave, Ecclus 30. 18. So afterward in the
primitive Church they had Caenam novendinalem for the souls departed, they
feasted the poor for the space of nine days, and they prayed, that the souls
might have a refreshment in that time; and this was discharged in the Council
of Carthage.

So they had a feast when they made a Covenant, as Feasts at their Covenants.
Jacob and Laban, Genesis 31. 54. so Joshua and the Gibeonites, Josh. 9. 14. And
the Greeks called these feasts (...), from (...) libo. The Scythians in their
Covenants and feasts did drink others blood, these the Greeks called (...),
sanguinipotas, drinkers of blood.

So they made feasts when they departed from others (...), sacrificia ante
expeditionem.
at their farewell, Genesis 31. 27. and these the Greeks called (...).

So they made feasts at the returning of their friends to welcome them home, as
the father of the forlorn son killed the fed Calfe when his son came home;
and these feasts the Greeks called (...); so Joseph made a feast when his
brethren returned to him, Genesis 49. 16.

Those who were invited to their feasts were called Who were invited and who
not?
(...), and they who were not invited were called (...) adscititij, and they
were called (...), umbrae, et muscae advolantes, and (...) qui lingua sua se
nutriunt; and they were said (...), a metaphor borrowed from the dogs who
fan with their tails when men feed them.

The number which they invited were not many; in The number at their feast.
that feast of Jobs children were his seven sons and three daughters; and
Christ and his twelve Disciples, and therefore that is false, septem convivium,
and novem convitium: the Greeks said, incipere debet a Gratiarum numero, and
progredi ad Musarum, that is, they would have no fewer than three at a feast,
and no more than nine.

The persons invited should be the poor especially; when thou make a feast,
bid not the rich but the poor, that What persons were to be invited.
is, the poor rather than the rich, men should not invite to be invited
again. Luke 6. 12. men should not invite (...) or (...), whose God is their
belly. Heliogabalus invited to his feast, eight black, eight blind, eight
lame, eight hoarse; he made no choice of his guests, but he made a mock of it.

The end wherefore they made feasts, was the glory The end of their feasts.
of God, 1 Cor. 10. 31. Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye
do, do all to the glory of God: Asshuerus feast was only to show his
magnificence and pride, but Esthers feast was for the glory of God, and for
the safety of the Church.

The second end of their feasts, was to express their Breaking of bread a
token of love.
hearty love and friendship, for to eat and drink together, was the greatest
token of love and friendship, 2 Samuel 12. 3. He had an Ewe-lambe etc. which did
eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his own bosom:
so Psalm. 41. 9. Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eat
of my bread: and so the communion in the life to come is expressed by eating of
bread, Luke 14. 15. Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God:
and Obadiah 7. these three are joined together, viri faederis, pacis, and
panis, that is, that makes a Covenant together, that has peace, and that eat
together; but Absolon killed Amnon at the feast; so Gedaliah was killed by
Ismael at the feast, Iere. 40. and John the Baptist by Herod, Mat. 14.

Of the place where the Romans used to make their Feast.
THE place where the Romans sat at their meat was called Caenaculum, and where
they lay it was called Cubiculum, and by the Greeks Triclinium.

The ancients at the first sat in the Kitchen, or a place The place where they
feasted.
near to the Kitchen, where they did dine or suppe, and this was called
Atrium, from the blacknes of the smoke, and the Courts afterward kept this
name, and they were called Atria, then they changed from this place and removed
to an upper chamber, and there they used to dine and suppe, the Jews following
the Roman custom who had subdued them, sat also in an upper chamber; Christ
and his Disciples eat the Passover in an upper chamber, according to the
custom of the Romans; these Chambers were called Conclavia, closets, or secret
places; and Christ says, when thou prayest enter into thy Closet, Mat. 6. 6.

The beds which they had were called Discubitorij Lecti, or Toralia, and they
were covered with herbs and straw before they found out Quilts or sowed
Coverings How the beds on which they eat were called.
called stragula, and the Greeks called them (...) and (...), and they
differed from the sleeping beds called (...), a bed wherein one slept, and
sometimes they had three and sometimes four of those beds in a Chamber.

For those three beds, the Ancients made one long bed The form of their bed^.
called (...), after the form of the Greek Letter (...), that it might almost
compass about the round Table, which they called Semirotundum suggestum, an
half round Table, like the Greek (...), and it was thus painted (...)

Martial. Accipe lunata scriptum testudine sigma. Octo capit, veniat, quisquis
amicus erit. And the round Table joined with it, was called Antisigma, because
it made a semicircle upon the other part, it was semirotundus suggestus, and
joining with the bed, it made the full circle; this great bed sometimes
contained seven; Martial: De Stibadio. Lib. 14.


Septem sigma capit, sex sumus, add lupum. Christ and his Disciples sat not in
Stabidio, but in several beds, in biclinijs, or triclinijs.

He who made those beds was called Lectisterniator, and he who kept the chamber
clean after the beds were made, was called Mediastinus, the charge of those
was The decking of their beds and chambers.
to hang the Chamber with Tapestry and Curtains; and Christ means of such a
Chamber when he says, he will show you a large upper room, furnished and
prepared, there make ready for us, Mark. 14. 15.

The Tables which they had, either stood upon one foot, and they were called
(...), or upon two, and they were called bipedes, or upon three, and they were
called tripodes.

At the first, their Tables were not covered with linen, How their Tables were
covered.
but after Supper they took a Brush or Sponge and swept the Table.

Martial: Haec tibi sort datur tergendis spongla mensis. Afterward they used
to cover their Tables Gausapo villoso, with a cloth made of rough Cotton, and
afterward with linen, and they had Napkins with which they wiped their hands
called (...).

They had mensam urnariam a Table upon which their Of their Tables.
vessels stood; by Varro called Cylibantum (...), because it kept the Cups, and
it was called Gartibulum or Gertibulum, a gerendis vasibus; this mensa urnaria
stood but in the Kitchen, but the other stood in triclinijs, in their upper
chambers.

When the Chamber and the Table were thus prepared, Of their washing before
meat.
the guests were washed in baths, and then they were anointed; the servants who
anointed them were called Vnctores or (...), and the place where they were
anointed was called (...), they washed their feet, and the vessel in which
they washed their feet was called Pelluvium, and that in which they washed
their hands was called Malluvium; when they washed before the dinner, it was
called (...), and after dinner (...).

They were curious in anointing of their bodies; for Of their anointing.
every part of the body they had a several ointment; they anointed the feet
with Egyptian ointment, the cheeks and the breast with the Phaenician, but the
arms with the Sisymbrian, the neck and the cheeks with the ointment made of
the herb Serpillum.

Chiefly they anointed their head and their feet with Nardus, and this by
Mark, cap. 14. 3. is called (...), upright Nard, and the box in which it was
kept, was called Alabastris, a box cut out of a precious stone in Egypt.

When they sat at these costly Tables, they had great banquets and feasts; this
was called Caena dubia, caena opipara, caena ebria, by Plautus, caena
triumphalis, by Plinius, caena dapsilis; Opposite to these was caena pura, caena
sine sanguine, and caena terrestris, in which they eat only herbs.

Of their manner of drinking.
THey measured their drink by a cup called Cyathus, and some were said potare
sextantes, quadrantes, trientes; He that drank Sextans was of a weak body;
he that drank Deuux was a drunkard, he that drank triens was one of the
middle sort; they used to drink harmonice, there were three sorts of mixtures
like three harmonies in music, the first was (...), three parts of water and
two of wine; secondly, (...), when they mixed three of water and one of wine;
thirdly, (...), when one part of wine, and two of water were mixed.

They drank sometimes nine cups for the nine Muses, and three for the three
fatal sisters.

Ausonius, Ter bibe, vel toties ternos, sic mystica lex est. Vel tria potandi,
vel ter tria multiplicandi. And sometimes they drank as many cups as there
were letters in their friends name, to whom they drank.

Martial. Nevia sex Cyathis, septem Iustina bibatur. And sometimes amongst the
Romans, they drank as many cups as they wished years to him for whom they
drank, and they used to cool their wine in snow water; so they had a vessel
in quo ^olebant aquam colare, in which they used to strain the water.

Martial. Attenuare nives norunt, and Lintea nostra, Frigidior caelo non salit
unda tua. They had a Master of the feast, called Pater discubitus, and by
Tacitus, Rex convivij, and the Greeks called him (...); and (...), who
assigned to every man his place where he should sit, and (...), who tasted the
wine before others drank.

When they were at Supper, they had all sort of music and perfumes, and when
they departed the Master of the feast gave them (...), gifts; so our Lord in
his great and last feast, had his perfumes, his prayers sweetning the prayers
of the Saints, they had their hymn, and he had (...), he gave them his flesh
and his blood.

Of their Apparel.
THe matter of their Apparel was Wool, Linen, and Silk, and Xylinum, which
was a middle betwixt Woollen and Linen.

Silk was called Meshi, Ezekiel. 16. 10. 13. Aquila translateth (...) Sericum. a
(...) extrahere.
it (...), because it was soft and smooth, and easy to be handled, or it was
called so, from [ Mashah] extrahere, because it was easily drawn out; silk is
not a new invention, as some take it to be, for it was in use amongst the
Hebrews and Greeks, and it was called Serica Medica, because the Medes
brought it upon Camels from Bactria.

Secondly, they had Wool; and thirdly, Byssus, white Linen, which grows in
Egypt and Palestina, l^ke to the leaves of the Poppie; and this is called
Shesh; (...) Xylinum.
shesh is not rightly translated Linen, but it should be translated Xylinum or
Cotton, and the reasons are these, the Lord forbids to make a garment of
linen and woollen, therefore the Curtains could not be made of linen and
woollen, but of [ Shesh] byssus, or Cotton; secondly, Linen does not receive
the scarlet dye, as this Xylinum or Byssus does; their courser clothes were of
Camels hair, such as John the Baptist wore.

The color of their clothes, first white, Eccles. 9. 8. Of the color of their
clothes.
Let thy garments be always white; those the Hebrews called [ Hhorim]
Candidi. They used this white as a sign White clothes a sign of prosperity.
of prosperity, victory, felicity, joy and gladness. Christ himself upon
the Mount appeared clothed in white, so he appeared to John in white, Revel.
1. 13. so the white robes given to the Martyrs in sign of victory, Revel. 7.
14. and white horses, Zach. 6. and Rev. 7. 9. the Saints are brought in
clothed in white, bearing Palms in their hands.

Secondly, they had clothes of scarlet color, this was called (...), which
comes of a worm bred in the stalk of a certain herb, and it has Shani
joined with it, because the cloth was twice dyed in it, and this was called
(...); Matthew says that they put Christ in Coccinea tunica, in a scarlet
coat; the other Evangelists say, in purple, that is, in scarlet tending more to
purple, it was not bright scarlet; and the whore is called the scarlet whore,
because she was dyed with the blood of the Saints, Revel. 17. 4. So there was
hyacinthinus color, a violet or purple color.

Of the diverse names of their stuffes, whereof their clothes were made.
FIrst, the Babylonians caused to weaue in diverse colors and pictures in their
cloth, and this was called vestis babylonica: such was that which Achan stole,
Josh. 7. 21.

The second was the Phrygian cloth, sowed with needle work, and this was
called opus Phrygionicum, the Hebrews call it rokem. The hangings of the
Tabernacle (...)
were such; The Queens vesture was such, Psalm. 45. This the Seventie call
(...), from (...) a needle, and (...) sowed with a needle.

Thirdly, Alexandrinum, the Alexandrian; This was when threeds of diverse
colors were woven together, and this was called (...), multilicium, or
variegatum: such was Joseph's party colored coat, and the Queens daughters
in those days wore a party colored gown. 2 Samuel 13. 18. This was also
called Plumarium, which shined like the Doves neck, Psalm. 68. 13.

The Assyrians and Canaanites made opus barbaricum, woven in both the sides, or
(...), such was the veil of the Tabernacle, both woven on the one side, and on
the other.

So they had opus plectile, as Aarons girdle; opus interrasile, imbossed work;
so they had vestes undulatas, vel scutulatas, water chamlet.

Of their husbandry.
FIrst, they plowed the ground, this was called [ Hharash] (...) aravit. (...)
Novellare.
Then they plowed it the next year, and this was called [ nir] novellare: and
Jeremiah alludeth to this 4. 3. Plow up your fallow ground; then he harroweth
the ground, breaks the clods and makes it smooth, Esaias 28. 24. and prepares
it for the seed: This was called occare.

The Ox when he plowed the ground he eat clean provender, so the ass: and
Esaias alludeth to this Esaias 30. 24. The Oxen likewise and the young asses that
ear the ground, shall eat clean provender, which has bin winnowed with the
shovell, and with the fan. Their other herds they fed them with Sycamores or
wild figs, Amos 7. 14. I was a herd man and a gatherer of Sycamore fruit.

They sowed diverse sorts of grain, Esaias 28. 25. as fitches, cummin, wheat,
barley, and rye.

The barley and the flax were smitten with the thunder, but the wheat and the
rye were not smitten, because they were hid in the dark, Exodus 9. 31. 32.
There was not such difference betwixt the barley and the wheat, that the one
was hid in the ground, when the other was sho^ up; therefore it is not rightly
translated hidden in the dark, but erant serotina, or somewhat latter.

There were three months betwixt their sowing and their first reaping, and
four months to the full harvest, Ioh. 4. 35. Say not ye, there are yet four
months, and then comes harvest? their barley harvest was at the Passover,
and their wheat harvest was at the Pente cost.

Of the manner how they threshed their corn.
THey had sundry forms in threshing of their corn; First, they beat out their
weaker grain with a staff, as their fitches, and cummin, Esaias 28. 27. And
this staff was not unlike to our fails.

Again, some of their grain was trodden out with the feet of Oxen or Horses;
with Oxen Deuteronomy. 25. 4. Thou shall not mussle the mouth of the Ox, that
treads out the corn. And Hosea alludeth to this form, Ephraim is an heifer
that is taught, and loves to tread out the corn, Hos. 10. 11. So with the
feet of horses, Esaias 28. 28. nor bruise it with his horsemen; or else it was
bruised out with an instrument of wood, which was either a plain piece of wood
set with teeth of iron, to cut the straw and bruise out the corn; This was
called hharutz, for (...)
the sharpness of it. Or else they used a wheel to bruise it out, and this
was called gneglah, as the first was called trahea.

A comparison taken from the ripe figs.
HOSEA 9. 10. I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, I saw your fathers
as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time, Cant. 2. 13. the fig
tree puts forth her green figs; the green fig was called grossus, and
the ripe fig was called carica, matura ficus. When it is said, that Christ
came to the fig tree, and found nothing but leaves, for the time of figs
were not as yet, Mark. 11. 13. it is meant of those first ripe figs, these
are called green, or untimely figs, Revel. 6. 13.

The first ripe figs are easily shaken off and fall away. And Nahum alludeth
to this, Nahum 3. 12. All thy strong holds shall be like figge-trees with the
first ripe figs, if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the
eater. And as men long most for the first ripe figs, so did the enemies for
Nineve, and one shaking of the enemy should make them fall like the first ripe
figs into their mouth.

A comparison taken from their shepherds.
THe shepherd in cold weather keeps his cloak close about him, and the Lord
alludeth to this form, Ier. 43. 12. He shall array himself with the Land of
Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment, that is, he shall take away the
spoils of Egypt, and keep them as sure as the shepherd keeps his cloak
about him.

The shepherds in the East went out and in before their sheep, and their
sheep followed them, and Christ sh^weth this, Ioh. 10. 3. The shepherd
calls his sheep by name, and leads them out.

The shepherd has his call, whereby he calls his sheep, and they know his
voice, Ioh. 10. 3. He has his shepherds crook, and his rod; the one to
catch them, the other to drive them: and David alludeth to these, Psalm. 23. 4.
Thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

The shepherd has his whissle, and his pipe wherewith he delights him self
when he feeds his sheep Judge. 5. 16. Why abod'st thou among the sheepfolds
to hear [sharikoth gadarim] it should not be translated, the bleating (...)
Fistula.
of the flocks, but why abodest thou amongst the sheepfolds, delighting to
hear the whissle.

Of the miseries of the Children of GOD in this life, and their happy estate
in the life to come.
LVK. 16. 19. Then there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple
and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day, and there was a certain
beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores, etc.
IN this Parable are brought in to us the condition of a rich Glutton and a
poor beggar; they are described by their life, and by their death; in their
life, the rich man is described by his great wealth, by his daily fare, and by
his apparel; the beggar by his poverty, and by his disease; by his poverty,
that he lay at the rich man's gate, and begged but the crummes which fell from
his Table, and yet could not get them* and thirdly by his companions, the
dogs who licked his sores; then they are described by their death, he was
ca^ried to heaven by the Angels to Abraham's bosom, and the rich man to hell by
the Devils; and the Parable sets down to us the petition of him who was in
hell, and the occasion of it, because he saw Lazarus a far off in Abraham's
bosom; his petition was, that Abraham would send Lazarus with one drop of
water to cool* his tongue, that is refused to him, and the reason set down;
then he puts up a second petition, that Abraham would send Lazarus to his
brethren to testify unto them of the pains and torment which he endured, but
this is also denied, and the reason is subjoyned.

It may be asked first here, whether this be an History How to know a Parable
from a History.
or a Parable? It may seem to be an History and not a Parable; for the
Fathers make this difference betwixt an History and a Parable, they say, that
is an History when the proper names of men are set down, as they say, Job is
not a Parable but a History, because proper names are set down in it; so
Lazarus proper name is set down here, then it may seem not to be a Parable
but an History. But we are to answer, that Lazarus is not a proper name here,
but an appellatiue common to all miserable, wretched, and poor creatures; for
in the Syrian Language which Christ spoke, Lagnazar, (...) Vir cui ferri
oportet adjumentum.
est is qui auxilio destitutus est, he that wants all help; it is not
rightly translated Eleazer, as if it were a proper name, but an appellatiue
Lagnazar, that has no help, therefore that collection of some who think,
that the rich man's name is omitted here for disgrace, is not so material, it
being a Parable and not an History.

He was a rich man, and he is described by his clothing, he was clothed in
purple and fine Linen. He was clothed in purple, this purple was the dye that
was gotten from a shel-fish, and it is not known now in Purple a costly dye.
those parts of the world.

Man has little cause to glory in his apparel, he borrows Man should not
glory in his apparel.
it from the fish and from the Worm; the Jews when they describe a man, they
say, that man is a worm, clothed with the excrements of the worm, the
expectation of the worms, and to be consumed with the worms; the first
clothing that ever God made to man, was of the skins of beasts, and that man
should not be proud of his apparel, see what Christ says, Mat. 6. 29. I say
unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of the
Lillies: this might seem strange at the first, but if we will consider it
rightly, we shall find it to be most true;

First, Solomon in all his glory, his ornaments were How the Lilly exceeded
Salomen in his glory.
but artificial, but the clothing of the Lillies are natural; and look how
far nature exceeds art, (for art is but an imitatrix of nature, and her
perfection is to imitate nature) therefore the Lilly exceeded Solomon in all
his glory.

Secondly, Solomon when he was so gloriously decked, he was beholden to many
creatures, he was beholden to Egypt for his linen, to the earth for his gold,
to the silk-worme for his silk, to the shel-fish for his purple, and had
nothing of his own; so that if every one of those should have claimed their
own, he should have stood up like Aesops Crow stripped of all, when every one of
the fowls craved their own feathers which they had lent her; but look to the
Lilly which is beholden to no other for its beauty, does not the Lilly then
exceed Solomon in all his glory?

Thirdly, when Solomon was clothed thus, it was but Man's clothes a note of his
shame.
a remembrance to him of his fall, and he had as little cause to glory in these
ornaments, as a thief has to glory in a srlken rope in which he is to be
hanged, or if a man should glory in the plaster that covers his wound; but
the beauty of the Lilly is natural, it covers not the shame of it,
therefore the Lilly exceeded Solomon in all his glory.

Fourthly, Solomon in all his glory was but one, and how much ado was there
to get one Solomon so decked and clothed? But all the Lillies of the field are
so clothed, therefore the Lilly exceeded Solomon in all his glory; this
should teach us to make but little reckoning of our apparel, because when we
have done our best, and spent all that we have gotten upon apparel, yet the
silly Gilly-floure or a D^si^, shall exceed us in all our glory; make b^t
small reckoning then of this clothing; labor to put on the Lord Jesus Christ,
that clothing of ne^dle-worke, with which the Church is decked, Psalm. 45. put
on Christ's righteousness, and then thou will exceed all the Lillies of the
field in glory.

And fared sumptuously every day. Because he fared so sumptuously every day,
therefore Why this rich man is called a Glutton.
he is commonly called the rich Glutton, Deuteronomy. 20. 21. the disobedient son is
called a drunkard and glutton; what man is to be esteemed a glutton? the
Hebrews upon this place say, that he who eareth, tartemar carnis, a pound of
flesh is a glutton, and he who drinks logum vini, an English quart of wine is
a drunkard; but we must not restrain it so here, for Judea being a hot
Country, a little flesh served them, but in those cold Countries, where the
cold drives in the heat, men's stomachs digest the meat better, and therefore
a man cannot be accounted a glutton, although he exceed this measure; but he is
called a glutton, who delights in nothing but in eating and drinking. Seneca
says, turpe est mensuram stomachi sui non nosse.

He fared sumptuously every day.] He sacrificed to his The Glutton made a god
of his back and his belly.
back and his belly, to make a god of the belly, what a base god is that? the
belly of the beast was not sacrificed but cast out: Some make a god of their
brain and sacrifice to their own net or yarne, as Habakuk says, cap. 1. 16.
as Ahitophel: Some make a god of their arms and strength, as Goliath; and some
of their feere, as Hasael trusted in his feet; but the most base and filthy god
of all is to make a god of their panch; the Lord calls Idols Deos stercoreos,
gods of dung; to make a god of The belly a base god.
the bel^y, is Deus stercoreus, a god of dung: if the Lord should bring in man,
and let him see the Idolatry of his heart, as he let Ezechiel see what vile
Idolatry the Jews were committing in the Temple, Ezech. 8. he should see more
vile abomination and Idolatry in his heart, than ever Ezechiel saw; some
sacrificing to this beastly lust or that, some making a god of their wealth,
and some making a god of their belly, but God will destroy both the meat and
the belly, 1 Cor. 6. 13. Let us be content then with sober fare, all a man's
travail is for his mouth, Eccles. 6. 7. the mouth is but a little hole, and it
should teach us to be contented with little; but the gluttons appetite M^n
should learn to be content with little.
is such, that he thinks he could swallow up Jordan; nature is content with
little, but grace will b^ content with less. The Israelites when they gave way
unto their appetite, they cried for flesh, for Garlic, Onyons, and for
Pepons, nothing would content them.

Lazarus could not get the crummes that fell from his Table; a man has a

use and a spiritual use, there is a sowing to the flesh, and a sowing to the
spirit. Gal. 6. 8. the natural use is to maintain our selves and our
families, the spiritual use is, to give to the poor; Nabal knew not this use,
1 Samuel 25. 11. Shall I take my bread, and my water, aend my flesh, which I have
killed for my shearers, and give it to men whom I know not whence they be? Here
he knew the natural use how to provide for himself and his family, his
shearers, but he knew not the spiritual ^se, to give to David and his men in
their necessity. So the rich glutton here knew not the spiritual use of his
riches, to feed poor Lazarus with them, it is this which the Lord will lay to
the charge of the wicked at the last day, I was an hungered, and ye gave me no
meat, Mat. 25. 42. The The poor in necessity are Lords o^ the rich men's goods.
poor in their necessity are Lords of the rich men's goods, Prove. 3. 27. and
the rich men are but Stewards and dispensators to them in that case; the
Fathers call the money given to the poor, Trajectitiam pecuniam, for as he
that goes a far journey, takes a bill of exchange with him, and carries
not his money along with him, for fear of robbing; so the children of God,
they lay out their money to the poor, they take Gods bill of exchange for it,
and then it meets them in the world to come; and so their money receives
them into eternal tabernacles, that is, it testifies that they are to be
received into eternal tabernacles.

Let us consider Lazarus his miseries; first, he was The miseries of Lazarus.
poor, then he was sore, he had none in the same case with him, he sees the
rich glutton that Epicure to prosper, and himself in such a hard case: he
might have been here overtaken with David's temptation, Psalm: 73. 13. Verily I
have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed mine hands in innocence, for all
the day I am plagued, and chastened every morning*

Let us compare Job and Lazarus together; Lazarus A comparison betwixt Job and

but Job was in a worse case, for his friends vexed him, and were miserable
comforters to him, Job 16. 2. Job was once rich, and then poor, Lazarus was
ever poor, solatium aliquando nunquam fuisse foelicem.

full of sores, the glutton sound and whole; Lazarus was hungry, he was full
and fared sumptuously every day; Lazarus was clothed in rags, the glutton in
purple and fine linen; Lazarus lay at the gate, but he sat in his Palace;
Lazarus could not get the crumbs that fell from his table, but he had good store
of dainties: Lazarus had no others to attend him, but the dogs only, but he
had many gallant men to wait upon him.

Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores, all the creatures The creatures

are in league with the children of God, but they are enemies to the wicked:
The Ravens that fed Eliah, pull out the eyes of those that are disobedient to
their parents, Prove 30. 17. The Serpents stung the rebellious Israelites in the
wilderness, yet the Viper upon Paul's hand hurt him not, Act. 28. 5. The Lions
that touched not Daniel, devoured his accusers, Dan. 6. 24 And the dogs that
licked Lazarus sores, eat the flesh of Iezabel; And the reason of this is, the
dominion which the Lord gave to man over the creatures at the beginning, and
the image of God in man makes them to acknowledge him as their Lord.

But ye will say, may not a beast hurt a child of God

They may: and the reason is, because this Image of Adam was in his innocence,
he was like unto a Herald that Why the beasts stand in awe of the children of
God.
has his coat of Arms upon him, all stand in fear of him, because he
carries the Kings coat of Arms, but pull this coat off him, no man respects
him; so man when he was clothed with this Image of God, the beasts stood in
awe of him. Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History records, that the
Persecutors took the Christians, and set them naked before the Lions, yet the
Lions durst not touch them, they stood foaming and roaring before them, but
hurt them not, and therefore they were glad to put the skins of wild beasts
upon them, to make the Lions run upon them and tear them; Thou that art a
wicked man, and have no part of this Image of God to defend thee, no marvel
if thy dog bite thee, thy horse brain thee, or thy ox gore thee: Let us
study then for to have this Imag^ repaired in us, if we would be in league
with the beasts of the field.

The dogs came and licked his sores; The beasts many Beasts surpass man in
many duties.
times outstrip man in many duties: The Kine of Bethshemesh went straight
forward with the Arc and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left,
but man many times declineth either to the right hand or to the left, and he
keeps not this midst: The Ox knows his owner, and the Ass his Masters
crib, but Israel does not know, my people do not consider. Esaias 1. 3. and Ier.
8. 7. Yea the storke in the heaven knows her appointed times, and the turtle
and the crane, and the swallow observe the time of their coming, but my people
know not the judgment of the Lord. And the Lord sends man to the Ant to
learn wisdom, Prove. 6. 6. Go to the ant thou sluggard, consider her ways
and be wise. Balaams Ass saw the Angel sooner then Balaam himself; and
therefore is it that the Scripture calls men beasts, and sends them to be
taught by beasts, which shows how far man is degenerated from his first
estate, and what a low form he is in, when the beasts are set to teach him.

It may seem strange why the Lord distributeth Why God gave his children a
small portion in this life
things so, that he gives such plenty and abundance to the rich glutton, and
so little to Lazarus, seeing the earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof,
Psalm. 24. 1. God who does all things in wisdom, does not this without good
reason: The Lord deals with his children in this life, as he did with the
Israelites when he brought them Canaan, Numb. 13. 17. When he brought them to
Canaan, he made them to go Southward into the Mountains, South a barren
Country.
the South was a dry and barren part, Judge. 1. 15. Thou have given me a
South-land, give me also springs of water: so Psalm. 126. 4. Turn again our
captivity O Lord, as the streams in the South, he prays that the Lord
would refresh them now in the midst of bondage as the waters refreshed the dry
and barren South. And Iarchi notes, that the Lord did with his people here, as
Merchants do who show the worst cloth first, so Cana of Galilie, the last
wine was the best, so is it here; the Lord shows his children great
affl^ctions and troubles, the South part as it were at first, but afterward he
brings them to the Land that flows with milk and honey.

Secondly, he bestows these outward and temporary things but sparingly upon
his children, that he may draw their hearts to the consideration of better
things: he gives the wicked their portion in this life, Psalm. 17. 14. Son
remember that thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things, Luke 16. 25.
but he reserveth the good things for his own children, that is the holy Ghost,
the graces of the Spirit, Luke 11. 9.

It is a matter of great consequence to discern what Great skill required in
discerning the gifts of Gods right hand.
are the gifts of Gods favor; many men think because they have wealth and
prosperity, they are the gifts of Gods favor, and they seem to stand under
the Lords right hand, but they are deceived. When Ephraim and Manasseh were
brought before Jacob, Ephraim was set at Jacobs left hand, and Manasseh at his
right hand, but Jacob crossed his hands, and laid his right hand upon Ephraims
head, and his left upon the head of Manasseh, Genesis 48. So many men who seem to
stand at the Lords right hand, shall be set at his left hand, and many who
seem to stand at his left hand, shall be set at his right hand. Lazarus
seems to stand now at his left hand, but stay till you see him die, and the
Angels carry him to glory, and then ye shall see him stand at the Lords right
hand.

It is a point of great wisdom to know the Lords dispensing hand; David
prays Psalm. 17. 7. separa benignitates tuas, as if he should say, give us
something O Lord, that we may be discerned to be thy children from the wicked,
for by these outward favors we shall never be known to be thy children. The
Lord cares not to throw a portion of this world to a wicked man, as if one
should throw a bone to a dog; but he will know well to whom he gives this
rich gift of eternal life.

And it came to pass that the beggar dyed, and the rich Death separateth the
godly from the wicked.
man also dyed. Death makes a full separation betwixt the children of God and
the wicked: the sheep and the goats may feed together for a while, but the
shepherd separateth them; the wheat and the chafe may lie in one floor
together, but the fan separateth them; and the good and the bad fish may be
both in one net, until they be drawn to the land; and the tares and the wheat
may grow in one field for a while, until the time of harvest: so may the godly
and the wicked live together here for a while, but death makes a total and
full separation: Moses said to the Israelites, stand still and see the
salvation of the Lord, which he will show to you to day: for the Egyptians
whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them no more for ever Exodus 14. 13.
the red Sea made a separation betwixt the Israelites and the Egyptians for
ever. So death separateth the children of God from the wicked, that they shall
never meet again. Betwixt us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that
they which would pass from hence to you, cannot; neither can they pass to us,
that would come from thence, Luke 16. 26. This should Gods children should have
little meddling with the world.
teach the children of God to have little meddling with the wicked, why? because
one day there shall be a total and final separation, and this is a great
comfort to his children, oftentimes now they are afraid of the incursions of
the wicked, and of their bloody hands, but then they shall never be afraid of
them: The gates of the new Jerusalem were not shut at all, Revel. 21. 25. to
signify that there shall be no fear of the enemy there.

And he was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom.] Here consider three
things, first, how it comes that the Angels are ministering spirits to man;
secondly, what they minister to man; thirdly, the comfort that we have by their
ministry. First, the ground of their ministry is, because we are reconciled
to God in Christ, when man fell from God, the Angels stood with a flaming sword
to hold him out of Paradise, Genesis 3. 24. When Christ reconciled us to God, he
reconciled us also to the Angels: Jacob saw in a vision a Why the Angels
minister to us.
Ladder reaching from the earth to the heaven, and the Angels ascending up and
down upon it, Genesis 28. 12. Christ is this Ladder, upon which the Angels come
down to minister unto us, Ioh. 1. 51. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the Angels of God ascending and
descending upon the son of man.

Whether do the Angels minister to wicked men

For outward things they may help them, to rise on the evil and on the good,
Mat. 5. 45. Whether the Angels do minister to the wicked?
We have examples of this in the Scriptures, when the Israelites were in the
Wilderness, the Angels brought down Manna to them, therefore David says, He
fed them with the bread of Angels, Psalm. 74. 25. It is called the bread of
Angels, because it was brought down by their ministry; there were many wicked
men amongst the Israelites who did eat Manna, yet the Angels by their ministry
brought it down to them; another example we have, the Angels came down at
certain times and stirred the Poole, Ioh. 5. 4. and whosoever stepped in
first, after that the Poole was stirred, was healed, whether he were bad or
good, the Angels then may minister to wicked men in outward things, but they
do not defend them from spiritual temptations, as they do the children of
God in resisting Satan.

Secondly, when they minister to man; they minister to him in his life time, in
his death, in the grave, and at the resurrection. First, they minister to him
in his life, and they keep him that he dash not his foot against a stone;
Secondly, in his death they wait about his bed to repel Satan, and when the
soul is out of the body, they carry it into Abraham's bosom; and they attend
the bodies of Gods children in the grave, because they are the Temples of the
holy Ghost; and so at the resurrection they shall gather them from the four
corners of the earth, and shall attend them to glory.

Thirdly, we have great comfort by their ministry; first, they are [ Gnirim]
vigilantes, the watchful ones, (...) Vigilantes. (...) Robustissimi.
Dan. 4. 13. Secondly, they are [ Habhirim] strong ones, Psalm. 78. 25. When
Solomon went to bed he had threescore valiant men about it of the valiant of
Israel to defend him, Cant 3. 7. But what comfort is it to the children of God
then to have so many watchful and strong Angels attending them?

He was carried by the Angels. What strange change was this, that he who was
now lying amongst the dogs is carried by Angels; lying amongst dogs, the most
base and unclean creatures, (therefore they are called Impuri canes, obscaeni
canes,) that he should now be carried by Angels the most excellent creatures
that GOD made, and not carried by one Angel, but by many Angels, as if they
were striving every one to carry him? when a great man dies all men strive to
be about the Coffin, one to carry a leg, and another to carry an Lazarus
soul; never man in this world rode in such triumph as Lazarus soul did: the
Romans after their Victories The pomp of the Romans in their Chariots.
in their triumphs they had their Chariots drawn sometimes with Elephants,
sometimes with nimble footed ^ennets, sometimes with pyde horses; and we read
of Amasis King of Egypt, who had his Chariot drawn with four Kings whom he had
conquered; but what is this to Lazarus Chariot, who is carried here by the
Angels of God; he rode here [ Bemirkeb has hashecinah] in curru (...)
majestatis: What shall be done to the man whom the King will honor? Esther 6.
9. he shall not ride upon the Kings best horse, but in the Kings best Chariot.

Into Abraham's bosom.] This is a speech borrowed from the custom of the
Jews, for they that lay in ones bosom were most dear and familiar with him,
as John leaned in Christ's bosom; therefore it is said that Christ came out of
the bosom of the Father, Ioh. 1. 18.

The fathers were partakers of the same salvation that The fathers partakers of
the same salvation that we are of.
we are partakers of, therefore Lazarus is in Abraham's bosom, they shall sit
down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of God, Mat. 8. 11. And they
eat the same spiritual manna with us, 1 Cor. 10. 3 And our Sacraments Our
Sacraments have the same name with the Jews Sacraments.
have the names of their Sacraments, we are circumcised with circumcision not
made with hands, Colos. 2. 11. And Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, 1
Cor. 5. 7. Those then who think that the fathers were but fatted up like
hogs with the temporary promises of this life, are foully deceived: Paradise
is called Abraham's bosom, because the faithful as Abraham's children are
received into that same fellowship with him; what is then become of this Limbus
Patrum?

The rich man also died and was buried;] Many were the solemnities which were
in this funeral, but nothing of the Angels that carried his soul to heaven;
he carried nothing of all that he had with him, but only the prickles of an
evil conscience, now he leaves all his pomp behind him. R. Solomon
observes, that David sometimes is called David the King, and David King of
Israel, but when the Scripture speaks of his death, he is called but David,
the days of David drew nere that he should die, 1 King. 2. 1. so verse. 10.
David slept with his fathers and was buried. All external glory and worldly
pomp leaves a man in his death.

To make use of Parables, we are to consider how the How to make use of
Parables. Arguments drawn from the less to the more.
spirit of God in a Parable draws an argument from the less to the more, as
if the unjust Judge because of the importunity of the widow granted her
request, how much more will God grant the earnest petitions of his children? so
the man instantly seeking bread from his neighbor: the end of these Parables,
is to teach us perseverance only, and no other thing to be gathered out of
them.

Secondly, the unjust Steward is commended for providing for himself, here we
are to follow him in the Parable for his foresight, and not for his deceit, so
we commend the Serpent for his craft, but not for his poison.

Thirdly, nothing is to be gathered in a Parable besides Nothing to be gathered
besides the scope of the Parable.
the scope, and as we look not to every particular color in the picture, but
to the whole picture; so we should not look in a Parable to every particular
circumstance in it, but to the general scope; example, the rich Glutton lift
up his eyes and saw Lazarus in heaven, therefore the damned in hell do see the
glorified in heaven; a false collection, and it is besides the intention False
Collections from this Parable.
of the Parable; so the rich Glutton prayed to Abraham, therefore we may pray
to the Saints departed; or that there is water in heaven to quench the thirst
of the damned; or that the souls departed have fingers or eyes or tongues; or
that the damned desire that their brethren come not to those torments, all
false collections; but if they should gather, that the children of God are in
great joy, and the damned in great pain, that were pertinent; Secondly, that
there is no redemption What may be gathered from this Parable.
out of hell; thirdly, that there is no refreshment to the wicked in hell;
fourthly, that the desired of the wicked shall not be granted to them; fifthly,
that those who will not be instructed by the Word here, will not believe
although one should come from the dead to them; and lastly, that the Word of
God, Moses, and the Prophets, are the only means to beget faith in us here.
Thus far we may stretch the Parable, and then we shall bring a good sense
out of it, but if we stretch it farther, then we shall bring a wrong sense out
of it, the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, Prove. 30. 33.

How the wicked may be enlightened by the Preaching of the Gospel, and yet
become worse after they be illuminated.
MAT 12. 43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through
dry places seeking rest, and finds none, then he faith, I will return unto
mine house, etc.
CHRIST having taught long amongst the Jews, and illuminated their minds by
working sundry miracles amongst them, and casting out Devils; but having
wrought no sanctification amongst them, he brings this Parable The scope of
the Parable.
of a man dispossessed of a Devil, and being cast out, finding the house
empty and trimmed, returns with seven spirits worse than himself.

There is the Parable here, and the application of the The parts of it.
Parable; the Parable is set down at large, and the application in few words,
even so shall it also be with this wicked generation.

The Parable it self has three parts, first, possession; secondly,
dispossession; and thirdly, repossession.

Possession in these words, when the evil spirit is gone out of a man: which
implies, that he must first have possession before he be cast out: secondly,
dispossession, and when he is dispossessed, he wandreth in dry places and
finds no rest until he return; and thirdly, repossession, he goes and
takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they
enter in and dwell there, and the last state of that man is worse than the
first.

When the unclean spirit is cast out.] He is an unclean spirit; first, in the
manner of his apparition; secondly, in the manner of his revelation; and
thirdly, in the manner of his operation.

First, in the manner of his apparition, he appears in Satan unclean in the
manner of his apparition.
the likeness of a Goat, a stinking and a vile creature, therefore the Lord
says, They shall no more offer their sacrifices to Devils, Deuteronomy. 17. 7. In the
Original it is [ Leshegnirim] to the hayrie ones; they are called the (...)
hayrie ones, because they have appeared in the likeness of Satyrs or wild
Goats.

Secondly, the Devil is an unclean spirit in the manner In his revelation.
(...) Pytho.
of his revelation, thou shall not suffer [Obh] a Witch to live, Exodus 22. 18.
Obh is called a Bottle or a Bladder, the Witches are so called, because Satan
gave his answers out of their bellies, and out of the secret passages of
nature, and for this they were called by the Greeks (...).

Thirdly, he is an unclean spirit in the manner of his In his operation.
operation, where ever he lodges he defiles that soul and that body,
therefore the Scriptures call such sometimes dogs and swine, Revel. 22. 15.
and the filthieft beasts that are; but the holy Spirit is most comely in the
manner of his apparition, in his revelation, and operation.

First, in the manner of his apparition, when he appeared it was either in the
likeness of a man or a Dove, or How the Holy Ghost appeared.
in the likeness of fiery tongues; but he never appeared in the likeness of
any filthy beast.

Again, in the manner of his revelation; he revealed himself to his Prophets
in a most comely manner when he spoke in them, he spoke not out of the secret
parts of nature, they did not foame at the mouth as those who were blasted by
the Devil, but the holy Ghost sanctified their tongues, and in great modesty
and comeliness they spoke the truth.

Thirdly, in the manner of his operation he is most holy, for where ever he
lodges, he sanctifies and purifieth that soul and body, therefore he is
compared in the Scriptures to water and to fire, and to the Fullers soap, Psalm.
51. 7. Wash me and I shall be whiter than the snow: in the original it is [
Tecabbeseni] play the Fuller (...)
upon me. We may know then whether we be possessed by Satan or not, if we
delight in filthiness or uncleanness, for uncleanness is the unseparable
effect of the unclean spirit: a man may be overtaken by Satan sometimes, and
Satan may in part pollute him, but he delights not in it; but if he delight
to wallow in that The godly delight not in sin.
sin, and make no resistance to Satan, then he is certainly the habitation of
Satan; when one offered violence to a woman under the Law, Deuteronomy. 22. 27. if
she cried out, she was not to die the death; but if she held her peace, and
consented to that villainy, she was to die the death: So when Satan comes to
pollute the soul and defile the body, if he cry out with Paul, O wretched man
that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? Romans 7. 24. then
we are not to die; but if we hold our peace, and delight in Satan's temptations
which pollute the soul and the body, then we are to die.

Is cast out of a man.] There is no creature in which Satan Satan's delight is
to lodge only in man.
delights to lodge, but only in man; when he entered into other creatures, it
was but only to deceive man, as when he entered into the Serpent, it was for
this end, to deceive Eva; he cared not for the Serpent it self: so when he
entered into the Gergesites swine, it was not for the swine that he cared, but
only that he might draw the hearts of the Gergesites from Christ by drowning
of their swine; and the reason wherefore he delights to dwell in no other
creature but man, is, because there is no visible creature that can commit
sin but man, where there is not a Law, there is no transgression, for sin
is the transgression of the Law, Romans 4. 15. but no Law is given to any visible
creature but only to man. This should be a great motive to humble man, A
motive to humility.
when he sees such a great change, that he who was the Temple of the holy
Ghost, should now become a cage for unclean spirits, and to make the house of
God a den of thieves, Mat. 21. 13. Was not this a great change, when a man's
house in which he dwelt was made a dunghill? Ezra 6. 11. But this is a far
greater change when man who should be the Temple of the holy Ghost, is made a
receptacle for unclean Devils; it was a great change in Naomi, when her
beauty was changed into bitterness; and when the Nazarites that were whiter
than the snow, became black like the cole, Lament. 4. 8. and when
Nebuchadnezzar, who was a mighty King became a beast, Dan. 4. 33. but those
changes were nothing to this change, when man who was the Temple of the holy
Ghost, should become the cage of unclean Devils.

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man. Whether did Satan go out
willingly here, or was

He was cast out by force here, he goes not out willingly Satan goes not out
willingly.
cast him out, Satan does not cast our Satan; but when the Lord casts him out
by his power, then he is cast out by force.

Whether is this gift in the Church now or not, to cast

This extraordinary gift to compel Satan to go out prayer and fasting now,
desiring the Lord to cast him our, Mat. 17. 21. but to charge him to go out,
or to conjure him, the Church has no such power; to use the sign when Not
lawful to use the sign when the thing signified is not.
the thing signified is not, this is a great abuse, if the high Priest under
the Law should have put in two counterfeit stones in the brestplate, when there
was neither Vrim nor Thummim, and promised by them, to have the Lord to answer
him, had not this been a delusion; so for men now to use the words of
authority, to charge Satan to go out, when this power is not in the Church,
this is but a delusion; the Church has power now by excommunication to give
over wicked men into the hands of Satan, but yet they become not (...), really
possessed, as it was in the Primitive Church. So the Church now has power to
pray to God for the delivery of the party, but they have not power with
authority to charge the unclean spirit; the Church in her infancy had some
extraordinary gifts which are now ceased, as to speak tongues, to cure the
sick, to cast out Devils, and to kill, as Peter did Ananias and Saphira, Act.
5. 5. to strike blind, as Paul did Elymas the sorcerer, Act. 13. 11.

Those gifts which are the best gifts God never withdraws God never
withdrawes from his Church gifts which are simply good.
them from his Church altogether; but other gifts which are not simply the best
gifts, he withdraws them; example, to speak diverse Languages was a gift
profitable for the planting of the Church at the first, but yet it was not
simply necessary; Paul said, he had rather speak five words in a known
tongue, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue, 1 Cor. 14. 19. Those
gifts which are most excellent and simply necessary in the Church, he takes
not away, I show unto you a more excellent way, 1 Cor. 12. 31. And the Lord
has turned these gifts into more excellent gifts, Ioh. 14. 12. He that
believes in me, the works that I do, shall he do also, and greater works
than these shall he do.

When Christ was here bodily present with his Disciples, his bodily presence
was not so comfortable to them as his spiritual presence, so when he was
present by miracles, signs, and wonders in the Primitive Church* this was but
a bodily presence in respect of his spiritual presence with us now; when the
LORD wrought these miracles then, it was either to convict the Infidels, or to
strengthen the faith of the weak ones, these miracles were signs, not to them
that believe, but to Why miracles were wrought.
them that believe not. 1 Cor. 14. 22. When Paul healed the father of Publius
the Consul, of a Fever, he healed him by a miracle, and made him presently to
arise, Act. 28. 8. but he healed not Timothy that way, but seems rather to
play the Physician to him, bidding him drink no longer water but wine, 1 Timothy
5. 23. What was the reason of this? Timothy believed, therefore he needed not a
miracle; but the father of Publius believed not, he was an Infidel as yet, and
therefore a miracle was more necessary for him.

He walks through dry places.] That is, he counts all other places but
deserts in respect of his former habitation.

Seeking rest and finds none.] Satan has three places; Three places of Satan.
first, his place of pleasure; secondly, his place of wandering; and thirdly,
his place of torment; his place of pleasure is an unclean soul, in which he
delights to wallow: his place of wandering is, when he goes about compassing
the earth too and fro, seeking whom he may devour; and his place of torment is
hell. Satan is tormented now when he is in his place of pleasure, and in his
place of wandering, but his full torment is not come, Art thou come hither to
torment us before the time, Mat. 8. 29.

So the child of God has three places; his place of The child of God has
three places.
pleasure, as Psalm. 84. 1. How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of Hosts, my
soul longs, yea even faints for the Courts of the Lord: so he has his
place of grief, Woe is me, that I sojourne in Mesech, that I dwell in the
Tents of Kedar, Psalm. 120. 5. and he has his place of joy in the Heavens.

And finds none.] Spirits have their rest, they are not The spirits have
their rest.
like quicksilver which has principium motus in se, sed non quietis, but they
have principium motus and quietis, the soul rests when it is delighted, as
the body rests when it lies or sits. Satan's rest is sin, but this is a
restless rest, the true rest of the soul is God only, therefore David said,
return my soul to thy rest, When the soul rests.
Psalm. 116. 7. When the soul is not set upon God the right object, then it is
extra centrum; and as the Needle of the Compass trembles always until it
stand to soul take thy rest, when he had his Barnes full, Luke 12. 9. But
riches cannot bring rest to the soul, for the more that a covetous man has,
the more he coveteth; an example of this we see in gold-thirstie Babel, Esa.
14. 4. the more they had, the more they coveted: the souls of the wicked are
in a sling, 1 Samuel 25. a stone in a sling is violently tossed about, so are
their souls, and they shall get no rest day nor night, Rev. 14. 11. So David
compares the wicked to a wheel which always turns about, Psalm. 83. 13. and
to a drunken man that lies upon the top of a Mast, Prove. 23. 24. If How to
find true rest.
thou would have true rest to thy soul, disburden it of sin; Look how the
poor ship was tossed, so long as Jonas was in her, but when he was thrown
into the Sea, the storm was calmed: so cast out sin; and then thou may
have rest. When a man entertaineth his sin, he is like a man that is sick on
the Sea, he runs from this place to that place to seek rest, but all in
vain, because he has the sickness within himself. God is called by the
Hebrews [ Makem] (...) v^l s^pius (...) per antiphra sin quasi illocali^,
infinitus, qui nullo loco capitur, sed omnibus rebus locum dat.
locus, because he contains all things, and is contained of none; every thing
is kept in its own place, God is the place for the soul to rest in: the
Philosophers say, Bonum ex integra causa consistit, malum ex quolibet defectu,
Goodness cannot consist without the integrity of all the parts, but evil is
a defect of any of them, that a man be in good health, it is necessary that
every humor keep his just temper and proportion, but to make a man sick, it
is enough that one humor only be distempered: the rest of the soul is GOD,
who is all goodness, but any grief will disquiet the soul; the soul is a
disturbed thing, therefore we must admire his power who can settle it: when
Christ calmed the wind and the Sea, they said, Who is he that both Sea and
winds obey? so we may say, when God calmeth the soul, and puts it to its
rest; who is this Why Satan can have no rest.
that the unsettled soul does obey? Satan being so far from God, who is the
place of rest, he cannot find rest.

Then he says, I will return unto my house from whence I came out. How can
Satan return to that place out of which he has been cast?

Satan is cast out two ways, either partially or totally: A twofold casting
out of Satan.
is wrought sundry ways; first, by civil education, as Nero was very meek
the first five years of his Reign, because he was brought up under Seneca a
good Master, so Julian so long as he was a Reader in the Church, Satan was cast
out of him partially; and sometimes by the constitution of the body, as some
Wicked men how restrained from sin.
abstain from some sins, because of the constitution of their bodies, as
they abstain from drink, because they have a weak brain; and sometimes by
shame; and sometimes by the restraining power of God; but it is easy for Satan
to enter in again when he has but such bars to hold him out; but where
there is a total sanctification, he cannot enter in again there. Now when we
call it a total sanctification, it is meant total here in parts, but not in
degrees, that is, there is no faculty in the soul, but there is grace in it
as well as there is sin, and therefore Satan cannot enter there again.

Unto mine house from whence I came. No place can content him so well as his
former habitation, Satan desires to go back into his ancient habitation.
wherein he has dwelt a long time, and he glories more to repossesse himself
in his former habitations, than to purchase new places. When Satan was
dispossessed out of the people of the Jews in the Wilderness by the doctrine
of Miracles which Moses wrought, he sought to be repossessed again; first, by
Idolatry; secondly, by Whoredom with the daughters of Moah, and by rebellion:
so when he was dispossessed out of the Christian Churches in the East, first,
he sought to be repossessed again by schisms and heresies, but especially by
Arrianisme, then he fully repossessed himself again by Mahomet. If thou How
to keep us free from Satan, that he enter not again.
be free from Satan's possession, look not back again as Lots wife d^d; Satan
is like a Raven, when he is driven from a dead carcass, he flees but a little
from it, and is ready to return to it again; when a man comes that Satan
surprise him not again, For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the
world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are
again entangled, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the
beginning, 2 Pet 2. 20.

And when he is come, he finds it empty, swept, and garnished. This house
was swept and hung, but it was not well furnished within.

Observe that God never comes to the soul with God comes never with an
empty hand.
a privation, but as he takes away sin, so he puts in grace, pull up the
thorns, and then sow the wheat, Iere. 4. 3. Cease to do evil, and then
learn to do good, Esaias 1. The Lord likes not this privatiue Divinity, Curse
ye Meroz, because they came not to the help of the Lord, Judge. 5. 23. So when
I was an hungered, ye gave me no meat at all. Mat. 25. 42. Many men do content
themselves with this, they will do their enemy no harm, they will have no
meddling with him, but this is the sweeping of the house only, but they come
not to the positive part, I will do him good, and therefore Satan may get
entrance again.

Then goes he, and takes seven other spirits with him more wicked than
himselse. Here the question may be moved, whether some Whether some Devils be
worse than others?
Devils be worse than others? It may seem there are, because Beelzebub their
Prince he is worst, go to the hels prepared for the Devil and his Angels,
Mat. 25. 41. And as amongst the good Angels, some are Powers, Dominions, and
some Thrones; so it seems that amongst the wicked Angels, there are some more
wicked than others, they are not then called worse spirits, because they are
more in number only, but they are worse, because they are more malicious; they
are all bad spirits, but some exceed others in malice and wickedness; many men
do mistake Satan and his Angels, they think that some of them are spirits
which do no harm, but they are all sworn enemies to man's salvation,
therefore Satan is called the red Dragon, the red Dragon delights not only
to kill men for hunger, but also for sport to kill them* what can we look for
then of those infernal spirits of destruction?

And the last end of that man is worse than the first. His last end is worse
than his beginning in three respects; The end of the wicked is worse than their
beginning three ways*
first, in respect of God; secondly, in respect of himself; thirdly, in
respect of Satan.

First, in respect of God, who justly punishes him this wise, by giving him up
unto a reprobate sense, because he loved not the truth: secondly, his last end
is worse in respect of himself, because he is dyed over again with sin;
those sins in the Scripture are called Scarlet sins. Scarlet is called
Shani or (...), (...)
because it is twice dyed. So men when they fall back, they are dyed anew
again, and as recidivatio in morbis est periculosa, so is the falling into
sin anew again. So it is worse in respect of himself, because after that a
man is illuminated, he is more ready to become profane, if he be not
sanctified: Take water and heat it, seems to escape from Satan, being
enlightened and in some show sanctified, if he fall back again, he brings
seven worse spirits with him.

The application of the Parable is, Even so shall it be The application of the
Parable.
also unto this wicked Generation. As if Christ should say, when I came amongst
you, ye were in d^rkenesse, but by my ministry ye have been illuminated,
but maliciously now ye impugn this truth, and ye are possessed with seven
worse spirits than before, therefore your end must be worse than your beginning.

FINIS.
An Addition. Page 122. line 11.
TO raise up seed to the brother, that is, to the eldest brother, Deuteronomy. 25. 5.
If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, that is, if the first or
eldest die and have no seed, then his second brother was bound to raise up
seed to him if he were not married; for the Law speaks of brethren dwelling
together, and not married or foris familiate: an example of this we have in Er
and Onan, Genesis 38.

Secondly, if he had no brethren, then his nearest Kinsman was bound to
perform this duty to him, if he had not been married.

But it seems that this duty is required of N. Rut. 4. then I should mar
mine own inheritance.

It is only required of him here to redeem the inheritance, stare super nomen
defuncti, that is, to make his child to be reputed as the child of the dead,
and so the child should not be counted his son, but the son of Chilion;
thus his inheritance should have been marred, and his name rased out, and this
made N to refuse, but if the Cousin were not married, then he was bound to
marry the wife of his Kinsman.
