From Mylan news is come / that 700 thousand Crowns should be paid to the
Governor of Grnua / and his Majesty likewise should handle with the said
Geneveses / that they should furnish the said Governor with 3 millions of
gold. This Governor has commaundemenes strongly to arm. His Majesty has
eke retained the third part of the Marchaunts of the West-Iudische Fleet / but
offered for that unto them the custom of the Selt / which in that Country
imports 260 thousand Crowns.

At Paris is Mansieur Priuli / Ambassador of the Denetians / very stately
brought to the audience to whom concerning Deltlm al required help is promised.

From Vienna, the 27 of December, 1620.
The Lord Charles van Sherin remains yet here / that has denounced unto his
Majesty in the name of the Moravish States / that first they should have a
safe conduct. Secondly / a general pardon and remission. Thirdly / that into
their Country there should not be brought men of war. For this they offer
and have presented to receive his Majesty / whereupon this resolution is
taken: that notwithstanding they first where not worthy / nevertheless it
should be granted unto them / if they should show themselves obedient / those
that have been cause / his Majesty will not pardon / but shall be punished to
an exampel of others. The men of war should be brought into the Country /
but none should suffer damage / but those that should withstand. Whereupon some
of the States and Communs have declared themselves / but others would not trust
to it / and are departed till a sure pardon be given / and therefore the whole
armey is lying in Moravia / to consirayne the rebels to obedience / and march
to Brin / but some say that 15 thousand men of war expect them there.
Likewise at Spalits / Olmits and other places are some thousands / that are
resolved to withstand the Emperor looking yet for many 1000. to do a great
expedition.

From vienna the 28 of December, 1620.
They say yet that Moravia should be delivered to the Majesty / but with
certain conditions but his Majesty will not accept them / but with condition
of grace and disgrace / whereupon they have sent hither Ambassadors to further
proceedings / but they are taken by the way of the Hungarians and some of them
are slain / notwithstanding they showed Patent Letters of the Emperor /
whereupon answer is given unto them / that they where arrant knaves / they have
therefore written hither / that they can not come / and they mean that the
Morabians with this handling seek but to win time / and that Betlem has
assisted them with 5000 men.

The Earl of Bucquoy is yet at Iglou / and the Armey of the Emperor at the
siege of a strong Castle not far from Brin.

His Majesty has revoked again the required Capital censure.

This Land-daye here goes yet forward / and his Majesty has sent a strong
Decretum to the Earl John Sigismund of Altensheym / that within the end of
this month of December he should set af all the Lutherian Officers / and
substitute Catholic in stead of them. The like should be done in the
Salt-ministery / and the Book-kee^ping.

After the Holy days the French Ambassador is minded to take his journey to
Bethlem Gabor / to make with the same an agreement / but his Majesty should
have answered / that he would neither consent to it / nor keep it bakward /
but he might do his pleasure / his Majesty had means to compel the
Hungarians to obedience.

From vienna the 30 hereof.
The enterprise we had again upon Presburg is unluckily proceeded / and with
the loss of some hundred of ours fallen out / for the intelligence we had with
the Captain was discovered be / fore our coming / and the Captain is put in
prison.

From Lints in Austria, the 30 hereof.
Here is advised / that the departed King of Bohemia should march again to
Bohemia and Saxony / with a great number of Hungarians and other Nations /
with some Turks and Tartarians.

The Moravians march strongly against the Emperors Folks / and
notwithstanding that the same have taken Zuaim / they hope to recover it /
because the King with the Hungarians are making them strong.

The news continues / that the Emperors Folk by Tuglau are slain of the
Moravians.

The Duke of Bavaria has sent already here a Politicq Ordinance / which
perhaps in this Countries shall speedly be published / and the matter is in
such state that the Country of the Ens for many years shall be conscribed /
which shall cause a great altration / and as they say the States and Communes
desire of the Emperor to receave the Inauguration / and resolution should be
followed / that the said four States should consent the petition / that the
Duke of Bavaria had requested in ready money. And that the Auguration then
could be furthered / and because that same amounts to a great sum of money /
concerning the pretension of the Duke / and that it is impossible that the
States should furnish so much / therefore against our will we shall be
constrained to remain Bavarish / which is not liked of many Lords.

From Prage, the 29 hereof.
Some few days past the Folk of the Emperor have been at Tabor / purposing to
take it in with an assault / but are driven of with the loss of 500. men. And
therefore has Monsieur Tilly written for more assistannce of men.

The Smarackes or commun people here specially in the new City / have been
some few days past very seditious / because the Garrison did not cease of
saccaging / and they have slain above 100. and did begin themselves to
saccadge / so that the Generals and others had enough to do to pacifye them.

From Presburgh the 28. hereof.
Upon this Land-daye is concluded / in the presence of the Ambassadors of
Denmark / Sweden and Hungaria / and the confederated Princes / to keep in the
fields for the King 16000 men / and to constitute a new general / and to live
and dye in this Confederation / whereupon the King should be in his journey to
Brin with 16000 men / and the Earl of Thurne should behave him very well in
Morabia / and not be arrested as the speech went.

From Heydelbergh, the 5 of Ianuarij, 1621.
The Earl of Thurne was returned with new aid from Hungaria into Moravia with
declaration and resolution that Bethlem Gabor King of Hungaria /
notwithstanding the great loss / would assiste his Majesty of Bohemia with
all his power / and never forsake the Confederation. Yea the Hungarians say
openly / that before they should submit themselves to the House of Austria /
they would rather take help of the Turk.

The Emperor should have manifestly declared / that he has given commission
to the Marquis Spinola / to make himself Master of the whole Palts.

Both by the Emperor and United Princes is great need of money / Spinola
having occupied and taken the principal Customs / requiring upon penalty of
burning so great chardges of money / that the meorporated Lands are not able to
bring them up.

The Coronell Gray is finally with his men arrived in the Over Palts / where he
shall remain unto nearer commandment.

From Coppenhaghen is written / that there was arrived the Son of Duke Hans
from Sonderberch / Kinsman or Cousen German of his Majesty of Dennemarke /
as Ambassador of his Majesty of Bohemia / is lodged upon the Castle / and
should further take his Journey to his Maieestie of Dennemarke at
Frederichbergh / his commission and petition is unknown.

The Nuptial Feast of his Majesty of Sweden / and the Koronation of the Queen
is ended with good succes / it seems that his Majesty of Sweden is resolved
to ondertake some thing against the Poole / and has already at Stockholme
15000 Footmen in readiness.

Letters from Paris declare / that the Marischal Cadinet with a great suite is
departed to his Majesty of great Brittayne.

The Religious matters in France are yet of a strange show / they hope
nevertheless that his Majesty will direct all to the best / giving
contentement to them of the Religion.

The Lord of Bossampiere does not depart to Spain from the Kings part / to
restitution of the Deltolines / before the Helvetians Cantons amongst them /
and they with the Grisons shall be agreed and united.
