AN INSTRVCTION FOR ALL THOSE THAT INTEND to go to the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper.
Question.

ARE you minded to go to the Lords Supper.

Answer.

Yes, Exodus 19.
by Gods grace to renew my Covenant with God.

Q. Why is it called the Lords Supper.

A. Mar. 14. Luke 12. Ioh. 12.
Because Christ, after he had eaten the Paschal Lamb. instituted it at
evening, with his Disciples.

Q. What did the Paschall Lamb signify to the Jews.

A. It was a Type of Christ to come.

Q. But Christ being come, is the Pascall Lamb, and all other Jewish rites
finished.

A. Yes, and the Lord instituted in the place of it, Heb. 12.
his last Supper.

Q. To whom did Christ deliver his blessed Sacrament.

A. To his Disciples.

Q. After what manner did Christ institute, and deliver the Sacrament.

A. Mat. 26.
First, he blessed the bread and wine.

Secondly, he brake the bread, and powered out the wine.

Thirdly, he gave it to his Disciples.

Q. What learn you by Christ's blessing these two elements of bread and wine.

A. First, it teaches all Ministers to follow his example, in administering the
Sacraments.

Secondly, it teaches all beholders to put a difference between these
elements, and common bread and wine.

Thirdly, when the Minister breaks the bread, and powers out the wine, Ioh.
19.
I call to mind, how Christ's body was broken and his blood shed for my sins.

Fourthly, that Christ gave it them, it teaches me, that when the Minister
gives me the bread and wine, I behold God the Father offering me his Son: The
Son giving himself: And the the holy Ghost sanctifying the action.

Q. How do you receive it.

A. As I receive the bread and wine, from the hand of the Minister, I by the
hand of faith, receive the body and blood of Christ, and feed on him in my
heart by believing, to eternal life.

For Examination.
Question.

What ought every Christian to do before he come to the Lords Table. 1 Cor.
11.


A. He must examine himself.

Q. In what manner.

A. First whether he have the knowledge of God, and of his Son Christ. Ioh.
17.


Secondly, whether he has a lively faith, to take hold on Christ and all his
promises.

Thirdly, whether he has a penitent heart, Act. 2.37. 2 Cor. 7.
and a godly sorrow for his sins past, with a purpose never to sin any more.

Fourthly, whether he has love first, to God, secondly to his neighbor, for
the Sacrament is a communion of the mystical body of Christ. Ioh. 15. 1 Cor. 11


Q. What if he wants this charity to his neighbor?

A. He has no part in this communion.

Q. What is then to be done; only Christ's rule.

A. If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, first be reconciled to thy brother,
and then offer thy gift. Mat. 5.25.26.

Q. Who are else excluded.

A. 1. If any man be a blasphemour, and a swarer, he is not to partake of it.

2. If any man be a drunkard, 1 Cor. 11.
come not near this Table of the Lord, for it is not for swine.

3. If a fornicator or adulterer, Ephesians. 5.3.
he defiles the Temple of God.

4. If any be a prophaner of the Lords day, Revel. 1. Fxod. 20.
let him know he tramples Gods eternal Law under his feet.

5. If any be a covetous person, or an oppressor of his neighbor, or a
backbiter, a slanderer, Gal. 5. Romans
or an envious person against any, let them know: That they profane the Lords
Table, yea, they eat and drink their own damnation, because they discern not
the Lords body.

Q. What does this teach the Ministers of Christ.

A. To be careful as much as in them lies, to see that those that be under
their charge, be fitted and prepared before they receive these holy Mysteries.
