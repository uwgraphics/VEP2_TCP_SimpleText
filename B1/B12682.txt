By the King.
WHere in a Proclamation (lately by us published) for considerations therein
expressed, We prescribed a course whereby the complaints of our people might be
taken away, if the same should appear to be justly grounded; Having now since
that time received particular information, that a Grant to certain Patentees
for the sole preemption and transportation of Tin, was very inconvenient and
full of grieuance to our loving Subjects: We, after long debate thereof before
our self and our Privy Council, where objections of either side were made,
and where the inconveniences were laid open, Have resolved not only to
consider how the generality of our Subjects might be relieved in suspension
of this Grant, but how the same might be done without any injustice to any
particular person, who is interessed therein by virtue of Letters Patents under
the great Seal of England, whereof we never intend to seek any course of
reuocation, but by an ordinary course of Justice, in which all our people are
equally interessed. In which respect, having commanded the Lords and others of
our Privy Council to call before them the Patentees, and then to offer them
all such trial for the maintenance of that Patent, as the Justice of this our
Realm affords, The said Patentees have rather yielded in their own duty
and discretions, to surrender the Patent, then to go about to maintain it:
Whereof we thought it fit that all our good Subjects should take notice, as an
Argument of our continual care and desire to do all things, which tend to the
relief of our people in any thing, whereby they receive any manner of
oppression, as long as they shall duetifully and orderly appeal unto us for
the same.

Given at our Manor of Greenwich the 16. day of June, in the first year of
our Reign of England, France, and Jreland, And in the six and thirtieth of
Scotland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most excellent
Majesty. Anno Dom. 1603.
