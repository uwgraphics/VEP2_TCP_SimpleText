By the King.
ALthough we have made it known by public Edict, That at our entrance into
these our Kingdoms of England and Ireland, we stood, as still we do, in good
amity and friendship with all the Princes of Christendom, and therefore are
carefully to provide, as much as in us lies, that none of them or their
Subjects should by any hostile action be endamaged in their Persons,
Territories, or Goods by any of our Subjects either by Land or Sea: Yet we are
not ignorant, that our late dear sister the late Queen of England, had of
long time wars with the King of Spain, and during that time gave Licenses
and Commissions to diverse of her, and our now Subjects, to set out and furnish
to Sea, at their charges, diverse ships warlikly appointed, for the surprising
and taking of the said Kings subjects and goods, and for the enjoying of the
same, being taken and brought home as lawful Prize. By virtue of which
Licenses and Commissions, our said Subjects, in the zeal and affection which
they bare to the good of their Country, in the annoyance and spoil of the
public enemy of this State at that time, and in maintenance and employment of
the Shipping and Mariners of England, otherwise through scant of Traffic at
that time, not sufficiently set on work; Did furnish out to the Seas diverse
Ships warlikly appointed, to their exceeding charge, upon confidence to enjoy
what goods soever they should take during the said Voyage, belonging to the
King of Spain, or to any of his Subjects, according to the tenor of their
several Commissions.

And whereas diverse of them, since our coming by the grace and favor of God
to the Imperial Crown of these our Realms and Dominions, have taken by
color of the said Commissions, diverse Ships and goods belonging to the
Subjects of the King of Spain, not knowing of any alteration or discontinuance
of the former War between Spain and England, and thereby are like to be
extremely hindered, or rather many of them undone (being a great number of our
good and serviceable Subjects) if they may not be suffered to enjoy such Goods
as they have so taken, before any notice given unto them of the discontinuance
of the said late war: We in our Princely condition, having (above all
things) tender care of the good estate of our loving and dutiful Subjects, and
willing to give encouragement to all others hereafter, in time of our Wars,
to show like forwardness in venturing their lives and goods for the weakening
of the public enemy, and benefiting of this their Country: Have thought good
to signify to all men by these presents, that our will and pleasure is, that
all such as have set out, or furnished to the Seas, any Ships of war, by
virtue of any the said Commissions, and not having notice of our entrance into
this Kingdom, have at any time before the four and twentieth day of April
last (which time we limit unto all men of war at Sea as a sufficient space,
within which they might have taken knowledge of the discontinuance of the said
War) thereby taken any Ships, or Goods belonging to any the Subjects of the
King of Spain, and are already returned into any of our Dominions, shall
quietly enjoy the said Ships and goods taken as aforesaid.

And further our will and pleasure is, That whatsoever ships or goods
belonging to any Subject of the said king of Spain, has been or shall be
taken at Sea, or land by any of our Subjects by color of any Commission
whatsoever, after the said four and twentieth day of April last: The same
shall be forth with sequestered from the Takers, to the use of the true
Proprietaries, and restored unto them upon the first claims and proofs of
their property, without any long or chargeable suite of Law.

And we further will and command, That all such our men of war, as be now at
Sea, having no sufficient Commission as aforesaid, and have taken, or shall go
to Sea hereafter, and shall take any the ships, or goods of any subject of any
Princes in league, or amity with us, shall be reputed and taken as Pirates,
and both they and all their accessaries, maintainers, comforters, abbettors,
and partakers shall suffer death as Pirates, and accessaries to piracie, with
confiscation of all their lands, and goods, according to the ancient laws of
this Realm. Commanding all our officers of the Admiralty to see our
commandment severely executed, and commanding al other officers of our
Kingdoms and Dominions whom it may concern, to give their best assistance to
the officers of the Admiralty, for the better execution of our said
commandment, as they and every of them failing therein, will answer to the
contrary at their uttermost perils.

Given at our Manor of Greenwich the 23. day of June, in the first year of
our Reign of England, France, and Jreland, And in the six and thirtieth of
Scotland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most excellent
Majesty. Anno Dom. 1603.
