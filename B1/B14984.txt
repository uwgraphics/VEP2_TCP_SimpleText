With The Proceedings of Count Mansfield, since his last coming into the
Palatinate, and since the Emperors Ambassador came into England, with other
Accidents, both in the Palatinate, and elsewhere.

Sent of purpose by a person of account the eight day of April, and now

Printed. 1622.

A RELATION of the Duke of Brunswickes and Mansfields proceedings against the
enemies Forces in the Palatinate.
Gentle Reader;
BEcause I see, that the general Currantos coming weekly over, have rather
stifled their own credites, then given satisfaction unto the world; and that
yet men throng as fast to hear News, as they beyond the Seas throng over, and
huddle together all manner of things to please the people, both here and
elsewhere; I could not choose but take pity of their longings and desires,
that are truly affectionate to Religion, and the Cause of the Palatinate, and
so expose unto thee, whosoever thou art, this Relation of credit, which came
to my hands the twelfth of April, wherein you shall see a modest declaration
of the affairs of Germany, and the tumultuous proceedings of such Princes, as
either wish well to the King of Bohemia, or suppose themselves wronged by the
Emperors imperiousness, and Bauariaes ambitious hastiness to usurp another
inheritance, and so I fall to the matter, as I find it thus written.

I will not trouble you, my self, nor contrarious humors; yea such poor
Papisticall Newes-mongers, that will have Sluice lost, and Brunswicke slain
before ever they were in danger, with former repetitions of matters already
published, nor once dispute of the motives, causes, effects, alterations, or
any other circumstances of the wars, either in Bohemia, or the Palatinate,
but come roundly to the present business, and tell you what is now a doing,
and what is likely to follow.

Ever since the Duke of Saxony began to repine at Bauariaes intrusion into
the honor of these actions, and the Emperor seemed partially affected to his
service, many Princes misliked the same, and by way of commiseration thought it
too much, that the King of Bohemia should be utterly overthrown; and
therefore, as you have participated out of diverse Discourses, they have
recollected themselves, and thus proceeded toward his relief and supportation:
whereas it has been first generally reported, that Hungaria is reduced to the
Emperors jurisdiction, and that a League of Amity has been contracted
between him, and Bethelem Gabor; there is no such matter, but rather the
contrary. For the Prince of Transiluania calling the King of Bohemia Gossip, by
reason he had christened him a child; has protested never to forsake him, till
he see him one way or another re-established: Indeed I must confess he has
abstained from crowning himself king of Hungary, upon a certain vow, he
would never be invested, till the Spanish garrisons and Emperors forces were
put out of Rub, Camora and other places: yea till Preshurgh it self were taken
and cleared.

Secondly, the Marquess of Ieggendorff keeping the fields and villages of
Morauia for the use of the King of Bohemia clean contrary to the fear and
distress he has been put in by the Emperors forces, has given him several
defeates, and approved himself a faithful friend and seruitor.

Thirdly, the repinings of Prague, and some other towns, which are still under
the King of Bohemiaes protection have been greater against the Emperor and his
forces of late days, then ever before.

Fourthly, the Duke of Wittenberg, scarce named in other Relations, having
mustered some forces for the defense of his Country, and commanded by the
Emperor to unite them to Bauaria, has answered plainly, That as they are
mustered by the advice of his Counsel and Lords, they are likewise to be
disposed by them, who never had occasion of unkindness with the Palatine, and
therefore will not now begin.

Fifthly, the Princes of the Union perceiving what a fearful thing it is to
let an enemy set footing in an others Country, especially to fortify
himself, as the Spaniard has done in the Palatinate, are general repiners at
their own first slackenesse, and so resolve to recover their much distressed
honors by some new and glorious attempts in behalf of their friend and
confederate.

Sixthly, the Marquess of Boden, and Lantsgraue of Hesse, standing hitherto, as
it were, at a stay, though they ever had good hearts, will now draw their friend
together, and be seen in the field.

Seventhly, the Duke of Brunswicke coming but first into the Low countries, to
salute the Queen of Bohemia at the Hage, offered them his service, and was not
only accepted, but supplied with men and money by the Sluices, and so went
directly into Westphalia, and by degrees like a ball of snow waxed bigger and
bigger, and increased his forces, so that he attempted the Dioces of Cullen,
and proceeded in many glorioue actions which you have heard of, and which have
indeed made him renowned over the world.

Last of all, Count Mansfield though some unkindness at the first passed
between the Prince of Anhalt, and him, and all for the love of the King of
Bohemia: has yet prospered so well, that he came round about the countries,
and performed such actions of admirations, that there are few kingdoms of
Europe, which have not bin filled with the relations of his proceedings, and
ever memorable exploites, so that he has reduced diverse Provinces under his
obedience, and now stands like a work impregnable with a mighty army and most
willing heart to set forward the king of Bohemiaes designs.

These things are in the general thus set down to show you the cause, why the
Emperor without controversy is weary of the war, and suspects that his
friends will never be able to withstand so great forces and men exasperated
every where against him, not so much for his own cause, and great spirit in
maintaining his honor and renown, as hearkening to the Sirens songs of the
Jesuits, who in truth care neither for him, nor any Prince whatsoever, nor
for the slaughter of the people, disturbance of their governments, deuastation
of their countries, and utter subversion of their quietness, but for their own
ends and superintendency even over the Pope himself: whereupon he has wisely
foreseen greater mischiefs, and so does politikely go about to prevent the
same by sending an Ambassador into England for pacification (if it may be) of
these troubles; but of this no more, til Time produce a fairer birth, and make
known the success of that Embassy, with all other things depending.

I will now go forward to the business in hand, which depends on the actions
of the Duke of Brunswicke, and Count Mansfield, who have been in present
employment, even since the Emperors Ambassador went into England, and most
wonderfully set forward the King of Bohemiaes affairs, so that as far as men
may be confident of worldly computation, there is great hope of recovery, and
turning of fortunes wheel, that he may be brought at last to the top, which
has so long been kept with his head downward: so that to make the matter
more perspicuous, I must say with the Poet; arma virosqne cuno, and tell you
first, what the Duke of Brunswicke has done, and next, how Count Mansfield
has proceeded.

Concerning Brunswicke he has long since bin in possession of Patter-horne,
Westphalia, and the Bishopric of Cullen, wherein his progresses have had
wonderful success, as by the prevailing in many skirmishes may appear, so
that the Bishop of Cullen being the duke of Bauariaes brother, has diverse
times advertised the Emperor and the rest of his friends, what distress he
has been in, and is likely to endure, if he be not better relieved, whereupon
many by Bauariaes appointment have come to his assistance, namely Monsieur
Iilley, Gonzales; another Prince of Anhalt and the Governor of Gulick, all
which have sundry times skirmished with the Duke of Brunswicke, and as you have
heard in as sundry Relations could never boast of prevailing, no not of
equality in their encounters, but departed still with loss on their side, while
these skirmishes had their several passages; News came unto him of the King
of Bohemiaes departure from the Hage secretly in the company of sir Francis
Nethersoll, and sir Charles Morgane, two English Knights, and eight other: some
told him, that all his tents, armor and provision of the war were shipped
at Enchysen to go to Bream, or some other rendezuous nearer to himself, and
the places he meant to go unto; some discoursed of diverse men of war which
attended him, as though he resolved for Denmark, but others seemed to
understand the truth indeed, and assured him he was gone disguised from Calis
to Sedan, to visit the old duke of Bolloigne, and there to acquaint Count
Mansfield with his intent, and purposes, and receive from him and sir Horatio
Vere, a true Certificate of the estate of the Palatinate, and the army, and so
either to exspect a Conuoy to meet with Count Mansfield, or march with the
whole army into some other country.

When the Duke of Brunswicke heard of this, he forthwith bestirred himself,
and set his actions on their best feet, that he might be ready to attend the
King of Bohemia wheresoever he went; and thus he prevailed in many several
encounters took diverse prisoners, ransackt Patterborne, and Westphalia,
marched as far as Sipstate, sacked 8 or 9 towns, battered diverse castles and
forts, and al over put the Papists in a general fear, especially the
Jesuits, whom of all others he hated, and of whom he was some way revenged:
for they will have him thus to proceed against them in two several places.

First, while he was resident in Munsterland, and had according to the chance
of war, and custom of Soldiers, pillaged the Villages, and spoiled the
Inhabitants, two several Jesuits spared for no inuectiues against him, but
railed in their Sermons, and in every Pulpit where they preached, mis-termed
him worse then a tyrant, bloud-sucker, and traitor, thundering against him
curses and damnation; yea cursing all his partakers and enterprises, whereupon
the Duke of Brunswicke thus exasperated, proiected how to be revenged, and yet
would feign do it without shedding of blood; whereupon he sent a messenger for
them, whom they denied, and added Elias prayers for fire from heaven to consume
the Captains of fifty: then he sent certain troops to surprise them, who took
them in a manner of an Ambuscado, and brought them before him; whereupon he
that was most faulty, kneeled down, and importuned him to pardon his offense,
and save his life: at which Brunswicke smiled and answered; that his life would
do him no good, but he would make some sport with him to cheer his heart: and
thus proving inexorable, he commanded certain officers to strip him naked, and
drop him all over with pitch and tar, keeping him still by a warm fire, that
it might be moist upon him, and then they rolled him among feathers, till he
was all over like some strange foul, or monster of Affricke: then he had a
halter put about his neck, and so was led round about the army: last of all,
he was sent to the Nunnery, where the dainty Lasses had work enough to make him
clean, and pick off his feathers.

Another time after the surprising of a town, in which were two Jesuits more
wealthy, then all the religious Friars in the same; he sent certain Officers
unto them, to inuit them to a Banquet, who though they were unwilling to come,
yet they durst not deny; and when they came, were so extraordinarily well used,
that they began with iollity to commend his entertainment, and thought
themselves secure, because of outward Courtesies: at last the Duke of Brunswicke
drank to them, and told them, that he was certified they had much money lying
by them, which they put to no good uses; therefore he would play the Banker for
them, and put it out both more charitably and piously; and when they began to
deny it, calling our Lady and the Saints to witness, that they were abused and
slandred, he swear a great oathe, adding withal, as he wished the K. of Bohemia
to thrive: he would flea them naked, and torture them with pinsors, if either
they dallied with him, or took not a present course to satisfy him: whereupon
seeing no remedy, they brought his Officers to their Cloisters, and showed
their treasure, which amounted unto 100000. dollers, and this was the end of
that business: but be not deceived in this Relation about precedencie of time,
as though this were newly done.

For it was the beginning of March last, and might have bin ranked with his
other actions, but that I suppose it came not within the reaches of common
fingers, or daily Corantos, and so I proceed to his last business and
encounters, which made way to a false reports of his death. You have many times
heard that Cordua out of Crusmacke, General of the army, which Spinola left in
the Palatinate, and Monsier Tilley from Bauaria, as he could be spared came to
the assistance of the Bishop of Collen Prince Elector, and received certain
overthrows from Christian Duke of Brunswicke, who sent his trophies of his
spoils to the King of Bohemia, as a rembrance of his service unto her,
whereupon ever since they have watched opportunity to be revenged, and the
Bishop has mustered new forces, having supportation from the governors of
Gulicke, Wessell with certain Burgonions and Wallons, who presently united
themselves to his own subjects and people, and so made another strong army
which by the end of March was ready to march under the command of the younger
brother of the house of Anholt, and here surnamed the Prince of Anholt: all
these watched the Duke of Brunswicke, and resolved by some encounter or other
to reintegrate their former credit and losses, and daily followed him in the
fields of Munster, Westphalia, Paterborne, and other of the Bishop of Cullens
Diocese, till at the last they found him near the town of Warebrough, where
they resolved to set upon him: but yet they found him not so unprovided, either
as they conceived, or wished. For by the means of Duke John of Sonderbergh,
uncle to the king of Denmark, a 1000. horse was newly come to him out of
East-Freesland and North-Holland, under the command of Captain John ^honson of
the Hage, with certain other soldiers, who all prepared themselves to fight
with this new commer, the forenamd Prince of Anholt, who greedy of honor, and
willing to rank himself in the Catalogue of famous Captains, came bravely
upon that battle, wherein the Duke of Brunswicke was fronted, nor was this
rashly done, or as I may say in spleen and fury, but upon great advise and
deliberation. For besides the Carbines that charged most violently, the
Battalion was flanked with Musketeers, who powered their shot into Brunswickes
battles, and had the fortune to kill some of his men. For this was done so
bravely, that his troops were driven to recoyle, and upon that staggering many
thought he was slain: for his horse was shot under him, and in that amase the
people rumoured his death.

This was a hard beginning, and put the soldiers in a shrewd fear: For a
whole Cornet of horse was shiuered, and Brunswicke lay for the time under foot,
but it lasted not long: for his youth and courage got the victory of
astonishment, and up he gets, and up he mounts again, first causing the
Captains to to fill up the room with a body of pikes, who kept the enemies
horse from coming too forward: then did he charge them with fresh horse, and
ere they could wheel about to bring their pistols bulleted he put them all to
rowt, and so was quittance with them for their first branery: but taking
another body of pikes, and finding the enemies Battalion somewhat thin of
Musketeers, he set upon them in such a manner, that he powered into them at the
least three shot for one, and just at the same time charged them to their very
faces, and had a brave dispatch, had not the second time his horse been slain
under him, and his second fall, made his own company let fall their pikes,
whereby they were daunted, and detained from further prosecution, whereas
questionless else they had made an end of that battle, and that batttaile
had sure determined this controversy.

But up he gets again, and up he mounts with courage and alacrity, and with
that fury that he ouerpressed his enemies, and gave such example and
encouragement to his Captains, and soldiers, that in all the good Discipline
of a skirmish) I cannot call it a battle, because the main battles never
came to fight) they seconded one another, that the shot killed three hundred, at
three vollies, and the pikes trooped, as it were, to make the more have to
rescue their brave General, who thus animated, set those horse on work that
were nearest and when the enemy began to shake, he pressed them so violently,
that many fell under his sword, and by computation, this skirmish continued
four long hours, and surely had continued longer, if a brave Spanish Captain
newly come out of Gulicke, had not brought up certain Hargubush on horseback,
and unlooked for powered many shots into the pikes, which were ready to mingle
with the Colonenses, and at appoint to end the business, whereat the Duke of
Brunswicke enraged came so audaciously, that a Bullet grazed on his shoulder,
and the wind of many Bullets made him fall once again from his horse, inso
much that a Wallon Captain (as it was reported) stepped unto him, supposing to
take him prisoner, but as he was lame in body, his business succeeded as
lamely: for to prevent the mischief, one Remigius a Dane opposed the lame
Captain, and in the sight of the armies slew him outright, having thereby time
to fetch up Brunswicks horse, and comfort to see him a live, and unhurt.

Thus is he mounted the third time, and perceining the skirmish continue in
some equality though the enemy had had the greater loss he caused certain
field pieces of advantage to be brought up to the side of an hill, and mounted
them so near, that they were effectual to the vnframing of a whole body of
pikes, upon whose dis-vniting some fresh companies came in and so played their
parts, that well breathed horse courageously gave a new assault, and being well
seconded, all was as well ended: for here were slain 5000. and 800. taken
prisoners. Besides, Prince Anholt General of the Bauarian forces, who was also
taken prisoner by the worthy Commander the Duke of Brunswicke: and the Bishop
had notice of a greater slaughter, which made him somewhat sad and afflicted,
till understanding that Brunswicke was shot, and had lost four hundred men,
he was then cheered again, and a noble Prelate and Prince of Germany,
imputed all to the chance of war, and to the decider of controversies:
notwithstanding this seeming show of undaunted courage, he suspected least the
great City of Collen, would animate the Soldiers to spoil, and make their
approaches nearer and nearer, so he retires himself to a strong Castle of his
own, understanding that the Bishop of Spiers had removed to Coplen, and
resolved to secure himself within the strength of the Castle of Thermonsteno,
as for the Bishop of Monts: it was told him he had leave of the Duke of
Loraine, or if you had rather the King of France, to keep his Court in Mets, a
strong fortified Town and frontier City, which in those days held out
against the Emperor, and is still the bulwark and fortress of France, and
odly hold in Loraine to secure the Country.

This is that, which is written of the Duke of Brunswicks proceedings, but
would I had time to write more: For he is a worthy Gentleman, and resolute
Soldier, their lackes but some years to mature his judgment, and bring these
good beginnings to prosperous ends, of which there is no doubt. For commonly
forwards Springs, if to bitter and hard Frosts do not nip the buds, are not
only comforts for the time, but presagers of plentiful Haruests: and thus
much for Brunswicks proceedings; now to the rest, but especially Count
Mansfield.

2 Concerning the Earl of Mansfield and his strong Army, many remarkable
things are written, which as briefly as I can I will succinctly abreuiate into
these heads. 1. First, that understanding, that all the Catholic Bishops were
fled, he garisoned most of Army in their strong holds, and quartred them in
the Villages, whereby as they say in England, they had Ministrels fare, meat,
drink, and money. 2. Secondly, that when he perceived his Army to increase,
and now to be so strong, that the Monarchs of Europe look upon him with
repining eyes, as wondering to what purpose he takes such large steps over the
Catholic Countries, he made a defense or Apology, diuulging it in the French
tongue, and delivered the Post of England, Balam by name, one of them to carry
over with him. 3. Thirdly, that understanding of the Duke of Brunswicks
conflicts, he writ Letters of gratification, and not only applauded his
actions, but requested a certificate from his own hands, who returned answer,
how he had prevailed in many skirmishes: burnt Westerkotton, Erquetts, Amruth,
one of the Gesecks, Ruden, Vberhagen, and the Diosarts house of Werdell come
from Lipstat, wherein he had like to have been betrayed with 25. Cornets of
Horie, 6000. Foot, diverse Pieces of Ordnance, Fireworks, scaling Ladders, and
many Pyoners: upon a design of importance out, he suddenly heard of the
approach of the Bishops forces, and so was compelled to stay and augment his
Army, for a more fiercer encounter: and that he had taken some prisoners, and
some Friars, who were so obstinate, that they cried out upon nothing but
treason and rebellion. 4. Fourthly, that while he was at Germeshem, and
retired to many places with his maine Army, Sir Horace Vere writing for some
supplies, he sent to Mainhem four Regiments of foot, some money, and
munition, besides many suppliments of victual, and other provision, whereof
the Garrison there stood in great need. For in truth thus it was with the
English General at this time, all the forces he had were partly secured in
Mainhem, Franckendale, and Heidelberg, partly Garisoned in the Villages, and
partly running up and down for sorraging, and other provision: so that every
day in one place or other, he was troubled with the Bauarians, and Monsieurs
Tillyes Alarums, whose Soldiers might well be called the Regiment Voluntes: For
they never lay long quiet in a place, but had many employments, as Bauaria
understood of the Enemies proceedings, and Emperors pleasure, whereupon
suspecting what they might do upon advantage, he sent to Count Mansfield, and
was supplied accordingly: For without controversy, he cast up his accounts in
this manner. That my Lord Chichester was long a coming with supply into the
Palatinate, but leave the care of that to the Majesty of England, and that if
the Spaniards and Bauarians should be removed by way of rendition of the
Palatinate, or composition for a peace, yet God knows what might happen ere
the business were fully established, and the peace absolutely concluded upon:
wherefore to strengthen himself, and to be informed of the state of all
affairs, he writ to Count Mansfield as you have heard, and had not only
supply, but Letters of comfort concerning his resolution, to continue constant
to the Prince his Master.

5. Fifthly, that as he had fortified Haggenaw, he would come and besiege
Lodenburg, and so prepare if need be against Oppenheim, all which he meant to
do with the third part of his forces: For he was persuaded if the worst came,
no further supply would enter into the Palatinate, either from the Spaniard or
Emperor, considering it was unfurnished, and that Gonzules lay quiet, as if he
had had a charge to fight no more. Befides wants so increased, that the
Country was not able to sustain an Army on any side. For the English were
hardly driven, and hardly relieved. Gonzales had been put to the trial of
eating his horses: Monsieur Tilley perplexed with hunger and several
employment, so that he had scarce 5000. men left, and they subject to
sickness, and other encombrances. The Bauarians in the same predicarment vexed
with sickness and cold, although the Emperor had hitherto sent many helps,
and renewed their decayed Soldiers: and the Towns, though the rivers brought
in provision, because the Country people were reasonably paid, yet felt the
scarcity: For victuals grew dear in the Market, and the Burgers were glad to
keep good order without riot or excess: yea, in many places Officers were
set, as superuisours, that neither the rich engrossed the Corn, Wine, nor
meat, nor the poor should be starued for want of necessaries. These things
considered, he took the more care in coming forward, and pestring the
Country with his forces to no purpose, but in my conscience made acquainted
with the King of Bohemias retiring, he prepared to speak with him, and so to
attend to bring their business to some perfection, as God shall give way unto
the same.

6. Sixthly, that seeing he had visited Alsatia all this Winter, and was in a
manner Master of Leopaldus his Country, he would sure keep what he had
gotten, and therefore as the Spaniard had taught him, and led the way in the
Palatinate, he would fortify the strongest places, and when all failed, put
the King of Bohemia in many possession of Provinces for his own Palatinate, if
not set the Crown of Prague more firmly on his head, then over it was before.

7. Seventhly, that seeing his endeavors had put him in a manner in possession
of four Imperial Cities, namely, Haggenaw, Spires, Worms, and Ments, and
that he had brought them to the disbursement of what money he listed, he saw
no reason to let slip such opportunity, but either keep them in awe by his
Armies, or make use of their several Countries, to recompense the King of
Bohemiahs losses, until a better time approach of better booty, which no doubt
was now breaking out with the day to show, that the Sun of glory was ready to
come out of his Chamber, to dispell and banish away the contagious vapors of
former trouble and discomforts.

8. Eighthly, that when the Emperor, or Duke of Bauaria, for the Emperor, by
the advice of the Bishop of Collen had sent unto him to know, by what authority
or in whose name he either raised, or kept together such an Army: he answered
plainly and resolutely, in Gods name, and the Kings, meaning the King of
Bohemia: whereupon to express himself accordingly, he contrived this devise
for his Ensign, or colors a radiant Sun in an Azure field, dispelling a
many slender and vaporous clouds into a corner: thus he not only iustifies
his actions, and emboldneth his Soldiers, but pays his Army, and has an
orderly Treasurer for their monthly entertainment, according to the preyes and
spoils they take: yea, to order his business the better, he is now coining
thousands of Rikes dollers with this device, an arm coming out of a cloud,
holding a sword poynant upward, with a Jesuits Cap pierced through: the Motto
round about, Amicus dei omnibus suis inimicis inimicus. 9. Ninthly, that
although many Friars and other Preachers used as many fearful inuectiues
against the War, the causes, the Authors, and effects, showing plainly, it
was a curse of God wheresoever it lighted: yet did he give way unto the Sun, as
if he were willing to confess as much, intimating by many of his speeches,
that the Emperor, though he had wrong done him first by the Proge^ses: yet
took a wrong course to inflict the King of Bohemians children, with the loss
of their inheritance for their Fathers fault: as for their Father, many a
Christian heart did think it revenge sufficient to have Prague surrendered, and
to see the Palatine disappointed of the Kingdom, in which he was crowned and
invested: but still to have his Country deuasted, the territories depopulated,
the Cities terrified with Soldiers: the Vines spoiled, the Woods cut down,
the cattle carried away, and all things subject to the robberies of Soldiers,
was too grievous a revenge, and unmeasurable inflicting: yet this was not all
neither. For besides the bringing in of strange Nations, and a strange Religion
to a religious Country, he had by way of donation, enfeoffed another with the
same, not remembering, what eternal hate might grow hereafter between these
two families, when peradventure all the power of Austria, nor the Empire should
not reconcile them, which things orderly considered with many other dangerous
to be published in a triuiall or common discourse, made his actions the more
justifiable, considering the proceedings were so terrible, and although the
Jesuits aimed at him in their Sermons, as the Author of those fearful
effects, and prodigious calamities, which the best War must procure: yet all
the world knows the Spaniards were possessours of the one side, and Bauaria
was entered in the other, before ever he set footing therein, or took this
course of the Wars diuersion, which by Gods grace and favor, who set him on
work, he would prosecute as long as life lasted, or the King of Bohemias
business hung in suspense.

10. Tenthly, that seeing the Duke of Bauaria has finished the bridge over the
Neckar, and caused diverse Wagons to come that way already with Corn and other
provision, and that Monsieur Tilley quartereth himself near Heidelberg, as
though he meant to besiege the same, or at least tarry the time, till Bauarias
forces be renewed, that joining together, they may perform their work
effectually, whereby it is so given out in England, and many are credulous of
such an impossibility: he is resolved to show them no favor, wheresoever he
come: but as he has visited Laudenburg, and the strong Castle of Magdenburg,
belonging to the Bishopric of Spires, he will also come to Bessing, and the
Marquess of Danstarrats Country, who was ever an Enemy to the Princes of the
Union: for fear whereof the people have already unfurnished their fields of
their Cattle, and carried their goods into the strongest holds, at which Count
Mansfield smiles to think, that poor Castles and Forts should secure them,
when so many Cities and well fortified places have submitted to his mercy, and
made their atonement with him, yea the other day the Catholics about Spiers
and Worms, seeing the good behavior of his Soldiers, that they neither
ravished women, nor murdered men, but only took the pilledge of the
Country, rifled the houses, the common custom, and fairest course of a
conquering Army, condiscended, and by a general consent agreed to allow him
3000. measures of Corn, 200. Fats of Wine, and 60000. Florines, which though
he did not accept of, as a full satisfaction to his demands, yet did he take
in good part for the present, and knew that if necessity should occasion, they
would be drawn to a further composition and disbursement.

Thus for the time he desisted from urging them to more then they were willng
to grant, considering he had formerly drawn great sums of money out of
their Treasuries: whereupon he proceeded to visit other Countries, and therein
only to take an oath of the Inhabitants of loyalty and fidelity to the King of
Bohemia, and service and attendancie to himself, and so he passed to the other
side of the Rhine into the Countries of Didishene and Anoth, where the people
seemed to wish well unto the King of Bohemia, and very willingly took their
Oath: then passed he to the Grave of Louensteins Country, which lies within
the Bishopric of Spires, and taking the same Oath of the inhabitants, he
quietly received such provision and money, as they would willingly spare: here
he received news that Monsieur Tilly had brought his Ordinance, or Artillery
to a place called Huscharen, as if he meant to go to Heidelbergh indeed, but
he let him alone, as resolving, that though he had power to his will, yet he
should not attempt any enterprise of worth and moment, without interception:
but assured, that neither Bauaria could proceed in any such design, nor durst
he lying so near, but let them alone, till he had further directions from him,
who^ he longs to speak withal; so that in my Conscience when that opportunity
shall present her hairy soretop unto him, he will only march through the
Palatinate into Bauaria's own Country, and either make him look to a new
business, or enrich his Army with the spoil, that he may be the better
provided to pass into Bohemia it self.

11. Eleauenthly, though he heard, that Don Cordua in person was risen from the
Town of Crusnach to go to Openhem, and fortify the Bridge with Sconces to
hinder all passengers, but such, whom the Court of Guard shall license: yet
when he saw he slacked the same, he conceived he had some special charge to
proceed no further against the English, till the Emperors Ambassador were
returned, and they knew what to trust unto from England: So that one way he
found the people glad, that there was any glimmering light of Peace toward, and
another way feared it would be a bar unto his Designs, if the King of
Bohemia should by any means be ouer-ruled, or persuaded to easy Condition,
and tractates of Friendship: but resolved not to be disturbed with conceit, or
meditation of such business, which yet hung in suspense, or were Coniecturall,
he presently put himself into Action, and ouerlooked his Fortifications and
places, wherein he had Garrisoned his Soldiers, and set up his rest to attend
the good hour of further prosecutions.

12. Twelthly, it was somewhat unpleasing unto him, that his Forces had layne
so long before the Castle of M^gdenburg, and spent as he thought so much time
to his disgrace, and hindering his other designs, whereupon he went thither in
person and took away all means from them of succor and relief, which when
they perceived, and were now debarred from former supportation, being old
Soldiers and of great experience, they came to capitulate the matter, and
surrendered the place upon Condition to save their lives, and depart with Bag
and baggage, which they did without Colors displayed, or any show of a
Soldier; by which occasion Count Mansfield took possession of the same, and
found therein more wealth, then either he had at Spiers or Worms: Thus did he
prevail in his action, and is now Lord of many Countries and holds, attending
the good hour of the King of Bohemia's coming to him, or sending for him: and
so leave him to the glory and in the fulness of joy, for this last good
success, which has made him more confident and resolute to ouersway nicer
exceptions, and go forward in his pretenses, though as yet he has not fully
expressed the same concerning particulars.

Having thus left Count Mansfield in security, full of wealth, Glory, and
assurance to bring his purposes to a happy period. Let us now come to other
matters, not yet impertinent though not altogether depending upon the former:
You have heard I am sure by many relations published long since, that Duke
Leopoldus Lord of Elsas and Alsatia, was in a manner driven out of his Country
by the Forces of Mansfield: yet prettily salued that wound with this cure, that
he went into the Valtolina, as General for the King of Spain, though in his
heart he repined at such an Usurpation, which was ever belonging to the
Government of another Prince. For of late the House of Austria condiscended,
that Spain should have the prerogative, as he had the Forces and stronger
hand to hold them close to his Mightines and preuayling. Well? here he
mustered Soldiers and took up two Regements to supply other Armies, but in the
midst of this iollity, as he was running away with hopes of recovery or
revenge: the money which was promised him out of Spain failed, and he could
neither go forward in that business, nor durst return into his own Country
for fear of greater forces, or more violent opposition: But some report, that
the Emperor sent him word, that he was willing to a general Peace and for
that purpose had sent Count Siratzenburg into England as his Ambassador, and
therefore there needed no such hastines to give any cause of suspicion, that he
meant not sincerely as he professed: This treaty of Peace set all humors and
dispositions on work, and the Provinces were as it detayned between fear and
gladness, what would be the issue of the same, as for the Grizons and Swisse?
they showed Leopoldus a face of discontent every way, and brought out old
Records, wherein the Kings of France were authentically sworn to be their
Protectors, how ever now they slacked the same, and gave way to another
Greatness, the like might be said of the Palatinate, Cleue, and other bordering
Provinces upon the Empire, and confines of Burgundy: but times are alterers of
men's purposes, and Kingdoms are eaten out with contraries; and taught to know
a lesson of Humiliation, when the Lord of all Kingdoms will admit of other
Stewards, then he first placed: Thus Leopoldus must be content to see another
man in possession of many of his Towns, and other Provinces of the Bishops,
as well as the Palatinate was at the same instant usurped by strangers, and had
indeed too many Masters.

Amongst other hopes and helps, that the King of Bohemia has, the Marquess
of Ieggendorffe is not the least. For he mustreth Soldiers daily both in
Silesia and Morauia, yea has had supply out of Walachia: and at this hour is
doubtful, whether he shall entertain the Tartars or no, who came both to him
and Bethlem Gabor by thousands, and resolve to assist them, if need be against
the Emperor, so that there is a great fear in Preslaw and Gratz, Cities of
Silesia, what shall become of them, if any alteration happen: whereupon the
Lords and States raise up many Forces, fortify their Cities, provide men,
money, and munition, stand at a stay for their submission, and do neither
openly warrant the Emperor their absolute Obedience, nor privately wish ill to
the King of Bohemia's proceedings, with which kind of neutrality the Emperor
is so displeased, that he imputes the fault to the Duke of Saxonies negligence,
as understanding that many Soldiers of Saxony, have bin licensed to depart
home, and the Duke himself is weary of the War; notwithstanding these
proceedings, and that there is a restraint of the Soldiers fury and violent
customs, whereby Prague and other places, reduced under the Emperors
government, do yet hope and look after some order for their Religion, and
profession of a good conscience: yet does the Bishop of Prague proceed most
violently and cruelly against the Protestants, and will not suffer them to
profess publicly either in Churches, or private houses, any thing against
the Church of Rome, so that every where the Inhabitants or discontented, and
pray to God for the diuersion of these mischiefs, that have not only
dilacerated the peace of Europe, but broken the hearts of poor souls to hear
God so profaned, and every man in his own particular terrified. For how ever
it is reported, that in Siletia, Lusatia, and those Countries, there shall be a
present assembly at Easter of the Lords and States of the Provinces, yet has
the Bishop of News followed the example of the great Bishop of Prague, and
locked up the Churches from the Protestants, and will not suffer the Burgers to
make open profession of their consciences; whereupon by way of petition they
have solicited the Duke of Saxony to consider their poor estates, and how
ever, the Emperor must captiuate their bodies and goods; yet to give them
leave to have their souls free to bestow upon the God of all freedom, and
salvation: to which he not only answered very graciously, but gave way under
hand to all their Protestant assemblies, and religious meetings, so that there
is hope and light appearing, that either the Duke of Saxony is and will be
discontented with the Emperor, whereby the vehemency of his proceedings may
be slacked, or that he will suffer the Inhabitants to enjoy their own
freedoms, and peace of conscience, to which purpose they have procured another
Mediator, even Duke Weymar of Saxony his own kinsman, who has not only
professed himself a Protestant, but raised two thousand foot, and five hundred
horse to join with the Duke of Brunswick in his proceedings, not doubting very
shortly to be partakers of his glory, as well as of his spoils, and hardly
gotten conquests.

Thus are the pure and delicate waters of Europes peace troubled and bedirtied
with the wanton flingings of cruel hands: For War you see has thrown
Blood and corrupted Carcasses into the Sun: men have followed one another
with Death and revenge, and so drenched their stinking feet: Women have
bathed their ravished bodies and left their pollution behind them: Soldiers
have washed their corrupted wounds, and all sorts with one filth or other,
have sought to damme up the streams, and make the current (if it were
possible, vnpassible) so that unless the stirring waters get the upper hand,
all will be spoiled, and if it once come to a standing poole, it will stink
and putrify: but the same God, that sent the Angel to quicken the poole of
Shilo, that the diseased might be cured, the lame restored, the dropsy healed,
the leprous cleansed, and all infection purged, will when he sees his time,
perform the like for us, by turning the inundation another way, and making the
Rivers run smoothly within their own even banks, or else he will do, as he
did by the waters of Murah, or by the flood Jordan, which was preferred before
the Springes Damasius to heal Naaman the Sirian.

To which purpose, let all those, who wish the Peace of Syon, and the building
up of the walls of Jerusalem, bring Incense and Sacrifice to the Altar of the
Temple, and there lift up their hands and hearts, that it may be propitious,
and the God of Heaven not only scent a sweet smelling savor: but give us
notice of accepting our Prayers, and requests, by seeing the Angel ascend in
the flame.

FINIS.
