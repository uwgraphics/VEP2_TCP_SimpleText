Wool being the chief Comoditie of this Kingdom, It is thought good for this
Common weal, to advance it to the highest rate that Conveniently it may be.
FIrst by making ample way to disperse it into the hands of al sorts of
manifactors within this land,

When it is converted then to make the way for the vent of Cloth and all stuffs
made of Woll,

It is conceived this may be done.

First by making an act for free trade,

By restoring the power of the Merchants of the Staple,

This will make the Staplers more forward and confident to buy Wool, when they
have power in their own hands to make the best of the Cloth:

And if the State think it fit that all sorts of Merchants, may buy Wool as
free as the Staplers, it may also be thought as fit and as good for the Common
weal, that the Staplers may Shipp all Woollen Commodities as free as other
Merchants.

By dealing with all Companies and Corporations according to that famous
president in 12. Henry 7. where it appears that the Merchants Adventurers
being then newly Incorporate, did appropriate trade to much to themselves,
which made the Common weal complain of them, and the remedy is there set
down (viz)

That any of his Majesty's liege people should be free to trade with them
paying only Ten Marks for their Admittance.

This will prevent Practizes, Combinations, and Limitations of Merchants in
their trades. And it will cut off all private impositions taxed by any one
Company: When it shall be lawful for others freely to Shipp the same
Commodities, and not be subject to the foresaid taxes.
