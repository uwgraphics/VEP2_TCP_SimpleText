An Epitaph upon the death of the worshipful Master Benedict Spinola
Merchaunt of Genoa, and free Denizon of England, who dyed on Tuesday the.12. of
Iulie. 1580.
AMongst the States of Italy
that stand and strive for fame,
There is a City passing brave
that Genoa has to name.
Inhabited with noble race,
Whereas amongst the rest,
There is a House of Spinol^^,
as noble as the best.
Of Ancients come from foreign parts,
as fate did give them leave,
And by their arms it does appear,
they come from the house of Cleave.
From out which stock a budde of birth,
inferior not to any,
Sprang in this Countries soil of ours,
a comfort great to many.
In that most gracious Princes reign
Sixth Edward was he sworn
A Denizen: and ever since
has faith and duty borne.
Unto the Princes of this Realm
still pressed to do them good,
And with them ever since his oath,
in grace and favor stood.
At ready hand, at all assaies,
when Queen or Council would
Command him ought. He naught refusde
to do what thing he could.
What passes above my reach to know
I leave: he lived here
A noble Merchaunt every way,
no stranger was his peer.
His friendly mind to all men like,
his word and deed was one,
And to the honest minded men,
his pursse was shut from none.
Amongst the poor imparted he
the talent God him lent,
On poor, and setting poor on work,
the greatest part he spent.
With money, meat, and Physic too,
the sick he comforts often,
The men decaide that secret wept,
again he set aloft.
The prisoners often he visited
with money meat to buy,
And many did he set at large
that did for little lie.
What was his liberal alms abroad
I need not for to show it,
Nor what his bounty every way,
the poor and rich do know it.
His name inferd a godly life,
for Benedict he hight,
Oh Spinola thy blessed works
are blessed in Gods sight.
And as his life was liked of,
vnblamde of foe or friend,
So God did show his mercies great
to him in latter end.
Good memory to latter gasp,
and knowledge of the Lord,
A mind to prayer wholly bent,
as one that life abhorde.
With hands erected up aloft,
and eyes unto the Skies,
In contrite wise, when speech was gone,
in godly sort he lies.
Lo here his birth: from whence, whose life
it is that I do write,
Whom out (alas) untimely death
has smitten with despite.
Wail may the sick, weep may the poor,
and heavy many a heart,
That from so sure a friend as he
their chance is to depart.
Clay has his right, death has his due,
deserts remain to Fame,
God has his soul: the world his pelf,
and brute, his lasting name.
God grant thy good example may
raise up (...) y ha^ts,
To help the (...) as thou have done
in gra^^ous (...) and smarts.
God is with th^^, ^od be with us,
God send^ us there to dwell
With Christ and thee in Heaven above,
my Spinola thus farewell.
