TO THE NOBLE, VIRTUOUS, AND RELIGIOUS LADY, THE LADY THOROWGOOD, Wife to the
Right Worshipful, Sir John Thorowgood of Kensington, Knight.
Honored Madam:
BE pleased to pardon my boldness in this, and command me in what liberal
Service you please: After many years specuculation, and perusal of many Maps
hereof, I present Your Ladyship with an Epitome, or Compendious Discourse of
the Little World, MAN; not that I presume to inform you in any thing you know
not; I am too sensible of my own defects to conceive such an impossibility; my
own experiences of your Ladyships Judgment herein, testifies the contrary;
but the many Engagements and Obligations, whereby I am bound to your Ladyship
for your manifold and extraordinary favors and courtesies exhibited toward me,
both in sickness and in health, (having no other means to give any recompenee
for them) imboldens me to present this small paper to your Ladyship, which I
earnestly entreat you to accept into your most worthy Patronage, that I may
thereby be securely armed against the envious Critticks, and encouraged
hereafter, if God enable me to prefer some more excellent Work to your
protection; beyond which I have no ambition, but to express my true and sincere
service to your Ladyship, and the right Worshipful, your Husband, whom I
beseech the Almighty to accumulate with all blessings and happiness, present
and future, taking the boldness to subscribe my self,

Your humble Servant, ROBERT TURNER.
London 29. October. 1653.
To the Christian Reader.
Courteous Reader:
IT being the nature of all men to desire and seek after knowledge; I have
therefore given thee a breife character, or epitome of the body of man, the
little world; whereby thou may attain to the most necessary external
knowledge of thy self; which being known, if any causuallty happen, thou
may the more properly apply a remedy, for which there are many excellent and
approved medicines, here in this ensuing Treatise set down: and likewise the
nature and cure of wounds, made by Gunpowder, and Gunshot; but if any one more
curious, in sensuring what is done for a common good, rather then studious to
promote it, should grumble at me for this my pains, I might answer him in his
own kind by way of question, as, Menedemus answered Chremes finding fault with
him, Tantum ne abs re tua est otii tibi, aliena ut cures, eaque nihil quae ad
te attinent? have thou so much leisure as to meddle with that which so little
concerns thee? yet to satisfy thee [gentle Reader] who intendest [I know] to
gather honey with the Be out of this Garden, and not poison with the Spider; I
have implored the aid of Apollo and Hypocrates, to compose thee some Hypnoticon
or Diacodion; not a medicine for one disease alone; but fitting some receipt or
other for all Ages, and all capacities to apply them; and for all Complexions
and Conditions, parts, and places, a medicine Preservative, Curative, and
Restorative; here are Antidotes or dictamum against the Plague and
pestilentiall Airs; many of the receipts I have not Englished, but leaving
them in their proper names which cannot be very well taken from them, neither
was I willing to deprive them of it, knowing that at any Apothecaries you may
readily be furnished with them; others of more easiy composition and most
obvious to the vulgar use, I have written in words at large, they being for the
most part, compounded of common English herbs, wherewith almost every one can
speedily furnish themselves; Take therefore in good part [Reader] the fruits of
this labor, and as Robera parentum liberi referunt, as the growth of the child
argues the strength of the parent; so when I shall attain to riper age, this
first borne may have a second generation; books have an immortality above their
Authors, for when they grew of full age, they can be again retaken into the
womb that bred them and receive with a new life, a greater portion of youth
and glory which is to them another being, and that always may and often does,
bring with them an addition of strength, and loveliness, ushering them to a
more vigorous perfection.

Thus have I laid before thee a little map of thy self or a description of the
microcosmos or little world, Man, equally endeavoring thy content and profit,
Quoniam variant animi variabamus arts, mill mali species, mill salutis
erunt: A modest censure hereof I gladly would entertain; as I am not ambitious
of applause, so not afraid of censure; give me leave to flatter my pains in
these words, Hic interim liber, aut laudatus erit, aut saltem excusatus;

All I desire is but encourragment to some other work, if any thing herein
shall redound to thy profit; let me petition thee to give God the Glory who
has enabled me to perform it, which are the hearty wishes of

Thy assured friend, To: Turner.

IKPOKOSOS, A Description of the little World.
CHAP. I. Showing the Definition of Chyrurgery, the qualifications of a
Chyrurgion, and Anatomy of the simple Members.
CHyrurgery is derived, (...), which is as much as to say a hand working; so
that Chyrurgery is a working of the hand in the body of man, in cutting or
opening those parts that be whole, in healing those parts that be broken or
cut, and in taking away that which is superfluous, as Warts, Wens, Scurfula's,
and the like: To the cure of every disease belongs four things; the first and
principal is God, the second the Chyrurgion, the third the Medicine and fourth
the Patient: Therefore the Chyrurgion ought to be Religious. Ingenious,
Learned, and Expert, both in Theorick and in Practick; he must be skillful in
the Anatonay, else he will be like a blind man to carve an Image; he must be
secret and private, as a Confessor to his Patient, not discouraging any, nor
setting a certain day of his recovery, as Mountebanks do, for that is not in
their power, oportet seipsum non solum, neither let them backbite others nor
vaunt and praise themselves, that will redound more to their shame then credit,
for their own works will get credit enough.

Of the simple members there be 11. and 2. superfluities, viz. Bones,
Cartilages, Nerves, Pannicles, Ligaments, Cords, Arteries, Veins, fatness,
flesh, and skin; the superfluities be hairs and nails; the bones be the
foundation and hardest member of the body; it is a consimile member, simple and
spermatick, cold and dry of complexion, insensible and inflexible, and has
diverse forms in man's body, for the several operations thereof, and diversity
of helpings; the gristle is a member simple and spermatick, next in hardness
to the bone and is of complexion cold and dry, and insensible.

The Ligament is a member consimple, simple, and spermatick, next in hardness
to the gristle, and of complexion cold and dry, flexible and sensible, and
binds the bones together.

The sinew is a consimile member, simple and spermatick, mean between hard and
soft, strong and tough, having his beginning from the brain, or from minuca,
which is the marrow of the back, and from the brain comes seven pair of
Nerves sentative, and from minuca comes seven pair of Nerves motive, and one
that is by himself that springs from the last spondell.

A Cord or Tendon is an official member compounds and spermatick, sinowy,
strong, and tough, meanly between hardness and softness, and sensible and
flexible, cold and dry.

An Artery is a member simple and spermatick, hollow and sinowy, having his
beginning from the heart, and brings from the heart to every member, spirit,
and life, it is of complexion cold and dry; and all these Arteries have two
coats, except one that goes to the lungs, and he has but one coat, that
spreads abroad in the lungs, and brings to the lungs blood and spirit of
life, and sends from thence air to temper the famous heat that is in the
heart: A vein is a simple member, in complexion cold and dry, and spermatick
like to the Artery, having his beginning from the liver, nutritive blood to
nourish every member of the body with; and the Artery is a vessel of blood
spiritual or vital, and a vein a vessel of blood nutrimentall; the flesh is
a simple member not spermatick, engendered of blood, in complexion hot and
moist: There is three kinds of flesh, the one soft and pure, the second
musculus, hard or brawny, the third is grandulus, knotry or kurnelly: Next is
fatness, whereof likewise is three kinds, pinguedo, which is made of a
subtle portion of blood, congealed by cold; it is cold and moist, insensible
and intermedled amongst the parts of the flesh; the second is adeppes, of the
same kind as the other, but is parted from the flesh besides the skin, and is
as an oil healing the skin, and moistning it; the third is au xingia, parted
from the flesh about the kidneys and entrails.

The skin is a member official, partly spermatick, strong and tough, flexible
and sensible, thin and temperate, one covers the outward members, and the
other the inward, which is called a pannicle.

The hairs are superfluities made of the gross fume or smoke passing out of
the viscous matter, and thickened to the form of hair.

The nails likewise are superfluous humors, engendered of earthly fume, waxing
through the natural heat of humors to the extremity of the fingers and toes,
in complexion cold and dry, and is softer then the bone and harder then the
flesh, etc.

CHAP. II. Of the compound members: 1. Of the head.
THe head is the habitation or dwelling place of the reasonable soul of man,
as, homini sublime dedit; it is raised up by God as a watch tower over all the
body; it is composed of hair, skin, flesh, veins, Pannicles, and bones; the
hair defends the brain from too much heat, and too much cold, it beautifieth
and adorneth the head and face, and by it the fumosity of the brain are
purged; the skin of the head is more lazartus and thicker then any other of the
body, defends the brain, and keeps it warm, and binds and keeps the
bones of the head fast together; the flesh is musculus or lazartus lying upon
pericranium without means.

Next follows pericranium, or the covering of the bones of the head, between
the flesh, and which passes a vein and an arteir, that nourishes the utter
part of the head, passes through the skul and nourishes the pannicles of the
brain, and hereof is made dura matter, which is nearer the brain then
pericranium, and under the skull.

Next is the bone or pot of the head, whereof there be seven in number in the
pan or skull; the first is the Coronall Bone, in which is the holes of the
eyes, and reaches from the brows to the midst of the head, where it meets
with a second bone of the hinder part of the head called the noddell of the
head, which two bones be divided by the comissaries in the midst of the head;
the third and fourth bones be called Parietales, and they be divided by the
comissaries from the two former; the fifth and sixth be called Petrosa or
mendosa, on each side of the head one, wherein are the holes of the ears; the
seventh and last is called Paxillary or Bazillary, which bone as a wedge does
fasten the rest together. These are the parts of the head containing, next
follows the parts contained: The first is dura matter, then pia matter, then
the substance of the brain, vermi forms and rete mirabile; the Pannicle dura
matter is made of the vein and artery spoken of before, which passes through
the seames of the head, which dura matter is separated from the bone of the
skull, the better to defend the pia matter; the next is the pannicle called pia
matter, which is tender and soft over the brain and in it are contained a great
number of veins and arteries, giving unto the brain both spirit and life, from
the heart and from the liver nutriment; this pannicle circumvolveth all the
substance, and there the spirit is made animal; these pannicles be cold and
dry, spermatick; next unto this pannicle is the brain it self, which is
divided into three ventricles, the foremost which is most, the middlemost less,
and the hindmost which is least, and from each to other be issues and passages
conveying spirit of life; and every ventricle is divided into two parts: in the
foremost ventricle God has placed the common senses, in the one part thereof is
contained the fancy, in the other part the imaginative virtue, which receives
the form of sensible things, representing them to the memory: in the middle
sell or ventrickle there is placed the contemplative or cogitative virtue; and
in the third or last the virtue memorative, out of whose lower parts springs
Mynuca, or marrow of the Spondels: Further, from the foremost ventrickle there
springs seven pair of sinews, produced to the eyes, ears, the nose, the
tongue, and the stomach, and to diverse other parts of the body: About the
middle ventrickle is the place of vermi formis, with curnelly flesh that
fills, and rete mirabile, that wonderful net or caul under the pannicles of
small arteries only coming from the heart, and there the spirit of feeling
has his first creation, and from thence passes to other members; the brain is
a member cold and moist, thin and meanly viscous and spermatick, continually
moving and ruling all other members of the body, giving them feeling and
moving: And Aristotle says, that it follows the course of the Moon; in the
waxing of the Moon it follows upwards and in the wane of the Moon it discends
downwards, and is less in substance of virtue, and is not so obedient to the
spirit of feeling, as it appears in lunaticks, and such as have the falling
sickness, who are most grieved in the beginning of the new Moon, and in the
wane of the Moon; therefore if the brain be either too dry or too moist, it
cannot work its kind, whereby the spirits of life melt and art solve away, and
then follows sickness and feebleness of the wits and other members, and in
the end death, and thus much of the head.

CHAP. III. Of the face.
THe first part on the face is the forehead, which contains skin and musculus
flesh, the pannicle under it is of pericranium, and the bone Coronall, which
passes from one ear to another with a musckle, which keeps up the eye brows
which are called supercilium, and under them is the eye lids called cilium,
which defend the eyes from annoyances, and are set and adorned with hairs; the
ears are griftly, the organ or instrument of hearing cold and dry, the sinews
whereof spring from the brain, and through them is received the sound, and
conveyed to the common wits: The eyes be next of nature unto the soul wherein
is seen the passions of the soul, as joy gladness, love, wrath, etc. They are
the instruments of sight compounded of seven tunicles o^ roles, and three
humors, and these sinews be hollow as a reed, that thereby the visible things
might pass to the sight; now these sinews go out from the substance of the
brain, passing through pia matter, where he takes a pannickle, and these are
called nervi optici, and are joined in one before they come into the eye, that
if any disease happen in one eye the other should receive the visible spirit,
and that one sinew might stay and help the other: Now the three humors are
placed in the middle of the eyes, the first is the vitriall humor like glass,
liquid and thin, and is innermost next to the brain, and he compasses the
christalline humor, until he meets the humor Albuginus, which is set in
the uppermost part of the eye, and in the midst of these humors is placed the
christaline humor, in which is the principal fight of the eye; and these
humors be involved with the pannicles, between every humor a pannicle, and
thus is the eye made; the next unspoken of in order is the nose; from the
brain comes two sinews to the holes of the brain pan, where does begin the
concavity of the nose, and these two be the organs or instruments of smelling,
they have heads like teats or paps, and receive the smelling conveying it to
the common senses; over these two is colatorium, the nosthrils between the
eyes, and through them passes the spirit of smelling unto the instrument of
smelling, and by them the superfluities of the brain are cleansed, and from his
concavity there passes two holes down into the mouth, whereby air passes too
and free into the lungs, and when these are stopped then one is said to speak
in his nose; it is made of skin and lazartus flesh, and of two bones standing
triangle wise, joined to the coronall bone, and it has two gristles that hold
up the nose, and two muskles to help the working of his office: The cheeks are
the sideling parts of the face, and they contain in them musculous flesh with
veins and arteries; about these parts be many muskles, Guido says seven about
the cheeks and upper lip, and Haly Abbas, that there be twelve that move the
nether jaw in opening and shutting, that pass under the bones of the temples,
they are called temporals, and they be sensitive, and whose hurt is dangerous:
Then there be also other muskles for to grind and to chew, and to all these
muskles comes nerves from the brain, and there comes unto them many arteries
and veins, and chiefly about the temples, the angles or corners of the eyes and
the lips; in the checks is the chief beauty, thereby the complexion is most
known, and (as Avicen says) they show also the affections and passions of the
heart, waxing pale or red at the sudden joy or dread of the heart: of the face
be two bones, two of the nose outwardly two of the upper mandible, one of the
nether, three of the nose within, in all ten. The parts of the mouth are five,
the lips, the teeth, the tongue, the uvula, and pallat of the mouth; and first
the lips are members official of musculous flesh, serving to the mouth as
doors to an house, and helping the pronounciation of the speech; the teeth are
likewise official, the hardest of all members, and are fastened to the cheek
bones, serving to chew the meat and helping the pronountiation of the speech:
They that have the whole number have two and thirty; the tongue is a carnous
member, compound, of many nerves, ligaments, veins and arteries, receives the
taste, and pronounces every speech, the flesh of the tongue is white, and has
in him nine muskles, the root of him is glandulous, wherein are two wels
containing spettle to temper and keep moist the tongue; the uvula is of
spongeous flesh, hanging down from the end of the palate over the gutter of
the throat, and is cold and dry, and oftentimes when there falls rawnesse or
much moistness into it from the head, then it hangs down into the throat,
and lets a man to swallow; it helps the sound of the speech, the prolation
of vomits, and tempereth the air that passes to the lungs, and guides the
supersluities of the brain, which come from the coletures of the nose.

The palate of the month is a carnous pannicle, and the bones that be
underneath it have two divisions, one along the palate, from the division of
the nose, and from the opening of the other mandible, under the neither end of
the palate, lacking half an inch, and there it divides overthwart and the
first division is of the mandible, and the second is of the bone called
Paxillary or Bazillary, that sustains and binds all the other bones of the
head together; the skin of the palate of the mouth is of the inner part of the
stomach, and of Mire and Isofagus, that is the way of the meat unto the
stomach; also in the mouth is ended the uppermost extremity of the Wesand,
which is called Mire or Isofagus; and with him is contained Trachia Arteria,
viz. the passage of the air or breath, whose holes be covered with a lap like
unto a tongue, and is gristly, that the meat and drink might slide over him
into Isofagus, which is reared up when a man speaks and covers the way of
the meat, and when a man swalloweth, then it covers the way of the air, so
that when one is open the other is covered; and thus much shall suffice for the
Anatomy of the head and face, which is under the celestial sign Aries.

CHAP. IV. Of the Neck.
THe neck follows next to be spoken of, which is contained between the head
and the shoulders, and between the chin and the breast; in the neck be seven
spondels, the first joined unto the lower part of the head, and every spondell
in like manner, the last of the seven is joined unto the ridge of the back, and
the ligaments that keep these spondels together are not so hard and tough as
the ligaments of the back, but more feeble and subtle, because of the often
moving of the neck; out of these seven spondels there spring seven pair of
sinews, which be divided into the head, the shoulders and the arms: The
muskles of the neck (as Gallen says) are twenty, moving the head and the neck;
the third part of the neck is called gutter, which is the standing out of the
throat bell, the fourth part gula, and the hinder part cernix so called,
because of the marrow that comes to the ridge bones, and it is (as it were) a
servant to the brain, and receives of the brain the virtue of moving, and
sends it by sinews to all the members of the body: Here also observe, that
the way through which the meat passes, or Isofagus stretches from the mouth
to the stomach, and is fastened to the spondels of the neck until he come to
the first spondell, and extends forward to the breast, and ends at the
mouth of the stomach; this we sand is compound, consisting of two tunicles or
coats, the inner and the outer; the outer tunicle is simple, the inner is
compound of musculous longitudinall will, whereby he draws the meat into the
stomach; also it is to be understood that the great veins which pass by the
sides of the neck, to the upper part of the head, are called vena organices, of
which the incision is dangerous; thus you see the neck is composed of skinny
flesh, ligaments, and bones, and is under the dominion of the sign Taurus.

CHAP. V. Of the Arms and Shoulders.
IN the shoulder there be two bones, the shoulder bone and the cannell bone,
the first is os spatula, or blade bone of the shoulder, whose hinder part
declineth toward the chin, and in that end it is broad and thin, and in the
upper part it is round; wherein in a concavity, called the box or coope of the
shoulder, and which enters the adjutor bones of the arms, and they are bound
together with strong flexible sinews, and are contained fast with clauicula, or
the cannell bone, which bone extends to both the shoulders, one end to one
shoulder, and another to the other, and there they make the composition of the
shoulders; the bones of the arms from the shoulder to the fingers ends be
thirty; the first is the adjutor bone of the arm, the upper end whereof
enters into the box of the shoulder bone, it is hollow and full of marrow,
and extends to the elbow, where it has two knobs in the juncture of the
elbow, entering into a concavity proportioned, in the uppermost ends of the two
fosell bones, the less whereof goes from the elbow to the thumb, by the upper
part of the arm, and the greater neathermost from the elbow to the little
finger; and these bones be joined and bound together with the adjutor bone with
strong ligaments, and likewise with the bones of the hand; the bones of the
hand are eight, four uppermost and four neathermost, and in the palm of the
hand five called ossa patinis, unto them are joined the bones of the fingers
and thumbes, in every finger three bones, and in the thumb two; so that there
is in the fingers and thumb of every hand fourteen bones called ossa
digitorum, in the palm of the hand five called patinis, and between the hand
and the wrist eight, and from the wrist to the shoulder three bones, which in
the whole numbered together are thirty, in each hand and arm, likewise there
comes from Minuca, and the spondels of the neck four sinews, one comes along
the upper part of the arm, another passes under the arm, one in the inner
side, and another in the outer side of the arm, which bring unto the arms
feeling and moving from the brain and minuca; now to speak of the veins and
arteries of the arm, from venakelis springs two branches, one runs to one
arm pit, the other to another, and there the branch is divided into two parts,
or other branches, one goes along the innerside of the arm, until it comes
to the bought of the arm, and there it is called Bazillica or Epatica, and
then goes down the arm, till it come to the wrist, where it turns to the
back of the hand, and goes between the little finger and the next, and there
is called salvatella; the other branch in the arm hole spreads to the utter
side of the shoulder, where he divides in two, the one goes up spreading in
the carnous part of the head and passes through the bone into the vein; the
other branch runs along the outward side of the arm, and there is divided
into two also, the one part ends at the hand, the other part foldeth about
the arm, and in the bouget of the arm is called Sephalica, from thence it
goes to the back of the hand, appears between the thumb and the forefinger,
and is there called Sephaelica occulario; there are in the arm five principal
veins from each of the two branches that I speak of, which be divided in the
hinder part of the shoulders, springs one vein, and those two meet together
in the bought of the arm, and there is called Mediana, or Cordialis, or
Commine, and of vena Sephalica springs vena oculoris, and of vena Bazilita
arises vena Salvatella, and of the two veins that meet there springs vena
mediana; and from these five principal veins there spring innumerable other
small veins, but of them the Chyrurgion has not so great charge; further you
shall understand, that wheresoever there is found a vein, there is an Artery
under him, if it be a great vein, there is a great Artery; and contrariwise, a
little vein a little Artery, for wheresoever there goes a vein to carry
nutrimentall blood, there also goes an Artery, conveying the spirit of life.
Therefore the Arteries lie deeper in the flesh then the veins do, and carry in
them more pure and precious blood, therefore he is further from outward danger
then the vein, and is covered with two coats, the vein only with one: and thus
much for the arms and shoulders, which are governed by the sign Gemini.

CHAP. VI. Of the Breast, Heart, and Back.
THe Breast or Thorax is the Ark or Chest of the spiritual members, where
there are four parts containing, and eight contained; the four containing are
the skin, musculous flesh, the paps, and bones; the parts contained are, the
Heart, the Lungs, Panicles, Ligaments, Nervs, Veins, Arteries, Mire, or
Isophagus. Of the skin and the flesh its spoken of before, but you must observe
that the flesh of the paps differs from the other flesh of the body, for it
is white, glandulus, and spongeous; and there is in them both Nerves, veins,
and Arteries, and by them they have Coligaves with the heart, the liver, and
brain, and the generative members. Also there is in the breast 80 or 90
Muckles, some of them common to the neck, some to the shoulders, some to the
Midriffe; some to the Ribs, some to the Back, and some to the Breast it self;
and in man the paps defend the spirituals from outward annoyance; and by their
thickness they comfort the natural heat; and in women there is the generation
of milk, which comes from the matrix to their breasts through many veins,
that bring into them menstrual blood, which is turned (by the digestive virtue)
from red into white, like the color of the paps, even as the stones turn the
blood into sperme of the same nature and color of themselves so is the chile
coming from the stomach to the Liver turned into the color of the Liver: Now
the bones of the breast are said to be triple or threefold, and they be
numbered, seven in the breast before, and their length is according to the
breadth of the breast, and their ends be gristly, as the ribs be, and at the
upper end of Thorax, is a hole or Concavity in which is set the foot of the
Cannell bone, and at the lower end of Thorax against the mouth of the stomach,
is a gristle called Ensi-forme, which defends the stomach from outward hurt;
and gives place to it in time of fullness when need requires. Now to speak of
the parts of the back behind, there are twelve spondels, through whom passes
minuca, of whom springs 12 pair of Nerves, which bring feeling end moving to
the muskles of the breast, and in each side there be twelve Ribs, seven true,
and five false, which five are shorter then the other seven; and therefore
called false Ribs. Of the parts that be inward, the heart is the principal,
first, and beginner of life, he is the primum vivens, and ultimum moriens, and
he is seated severally by himself, in the midst of the breast as Lord and King
over all the members, and all the members receive their blood of life from the
heart; the substance of the heart is as it were Lazartus flesh, an official
member spermatick, sending forth to every Member spirit of breath and heat, by
his moving and stirring. The heart has the shape and form of a Pineapple,
the broad end thereof is upwards, and the sharp end downwards, depending a
little toward the left side. Also the heort has blood in his substance,
whereas all other members have it but in their veins and Arteries; and the heart
is bound with certain Ligaments to the back part of the breast, but they
touch not the substance of the heart, but in the overpart they spring out of
him, and is fastened as aforesaid; further the heart has two ventricles, or
concavities, and the left is higher then the right, and in this hollownesse he
keeps the blood for his nourishing, and the air to abate and temper the
great heat he is in; likewise here observe, that to the right ventricle of the
heart comes a vein from venakelis that receives all the substance of blood
from the Liver to nourist the heart with, and the residue of it is made subtle
through the virtue of the heart and then it passes through the Concavity of
the heart, and ther^ is made hot and pure, and then it passes into the left
ventricle, and there is engendered in it a spirit that is clear, bright, and
subtle, and a mean between the body and the soul; further it is to b^ noter,
that from the left ventrickle of the hear^ springs two Arteries, the one
having but on^ Coat, and is called Arteria venalis, which Arter^ carries blood
from the heart to the Lungs to giv^ them nutriment, and brings air from the
Lung^ to the heart to refresh him with. The other Arter^ has two Coats and is
called vena Arterialis, an^ of him springs all other Arteries that spread
(...) every member of the body; and the spirit that (...) retained in them is
the Instrument or treasure (...) the soul, and at the brain he receives a
further digestion, and there is made animal, and at the liver nutrimentall,
and at the testicles or stones generative, and this Artery is also called the
pulsative vein, or the beating vein. Also there is in the heart three
pellicks, opening and closing the going in of the heart, blood, and spirit; the
heart has likewise two little ears through whom passes the air from the
Lungs: The heart is also covered with a strong pannicle called Pericordium,
unto which comes nerves, as unto the other members, and this pannicle
springs of the upper pan-pannicle of the midriffe. And from him springs
another pannicle which parts the breast in the middle, and is called
Mediastricum, and keeps the Lungs that they fall not over the heart; there is
also another Pannicle that covers the Ribs inwardly of whom the midriffe has
his beginning. And thus much of the Breast and Heart, which are under the
signs Cancer and Leo.

CHAP. VII. Of the Lungs, Bowels, and Belly.
THe Lungs is a member Spermatick of his first Creation, in his natural
complexion coid and dry, and accidentally cold and moist, lapped in a nervous
pannicle, that it might gather together the softer substance of the Lungs; In
the Lungs is three kinds of substance, one is a vein coming from the Liver,
bringing the crude or raw part of the chile to feed the Lungs; another is
arteria venalis coming from the heart, bringing with him the spirit of life to
nourish him with; the third is, Trachia arteria, that brings in air to the
Lungs.

The Lungs is also divided into five Lobs, or Pellicles, viz. three on the
right side, and two on the left; so that if there fell any hurt to one, the
other might supply his Office; so that the Lungs as a pair of Bellows draw
cold wind and refresh the heart, change alter, and purify the Air, and do
receive from the heart the superfluities which he puts forth by his
breathing. Behind the Lungs passes Isofagus of whom its spoken before, and
there passes also veins and Arteries, and all these with trachia arteria do
make a stoke repleat unto the gullet, with Pannicles, strong Ligaments, and
glandulus flesh to fulfill the void places. And last of all is the Midriffe,
which is an official member made of two Pannicles, and Lazartus flesh, and is
placed in the midst of the body overthwart under the region of the spiritual
members, parting them from the matrix; and it divides the spirituals from the
nutrales, and keeps the malicious fumes from ascending upwards to annoy the
spirituals or vital. Next follows the womb which is the Region of all the
intrailes, and reaches from the midriffe down to the share inwardly, and
outwardly from the reins or kidneyes down to the bone Pecten, about the privy
parts; and this wound is compound made of two things, viz of Syfac and Myrac:
Syfac is a member spermatick, official, sensible, sinnowy, cold and dry, and
has his beginning at the inner Pannicle of the Midriff, and it contains and
binds together all the intrails, defends the musculus, so that he oppress
not the natural members: Myrac is compound, and made of four things, viz of
skin outwardly, of fatness, of a carnous Pannicle and of musculus flesh, and
all the whole from Syfac outward is called Myrac, and in this Myrac, or outer
part of the womb, there is noted eight Muskles, two longitudinals, proceeding
from the shield of the stomach unto os pecten, two Longitudinalls coming from
the backwards to the womb, and four transverse, two whereof spring from the
ribs on the right side, and go to the left side to the bones of the Haunches,
or of pecten; and the other two spring from the ribs on the left, and come over
the womb to the right parts. Here note, that by the musculus longitudinall, is
made perfect the virtue attractive, and by the musculus transverse, the virtue
retentive, and by the musculus latitudinall the virtue expulsive, and by the
virtue attractive is drawn down to the intrailes all the superfluities, both
water, wind, and dirt; by the virtue retentive all things are holden and kept
until nature has wrought his kind; and by the virtue expulsive is put forth
all things when nature provokes any thing to be done. Now to come to the parts
contained within: first that which appears next under the Syfac is omentum or
Zirbus, which is a pannicle covering the stomach and intrails, implanted with
many veins and arteries, and fatness to keep moist the inward parts. This
Zirbus is an official member, and is compound of a vein and an Artery, which
enters and makes a line of the utter tunicle of the stomach, unto which
tunicle hangs the Zirbus and covers all the guts down to the share; next to
Zirbus appears the intrails or guts, which convey the dross of the meat and
drink, and cleanse the body of their superfluities: There be six portions of
one whole gut, which begins at the neither mouth of the stomach, and
continues to the end of the fundament: nevertheless he has diverse shapes and
forms, diverse operations, and diverse names. And as the stomach has two
tunicles, so have all the guts two tunicles; the first portion of the guts is
called Duodenum, he is twelve inches of length, and covers the neither part
of the stomach, and receives all the dross of the stomach: the second is
called Jejunium, for he is evermore empty, for to him lies the chest of the
gall, and beats him sore, and draws all the dross out of him, and
cleanses him: the third is called Yleon, or small gut, and is in length
fifteen or sixteen Cubits; in this gut oftentimes falls a disease called
Yleaca passio: the fourth gut is called Monoculus, or blind gut, and seems to
have but one hole or mouth, one near unto the other, for by the one all things
go in, and by the other they go out again; the first is called Colon, and
receives all the dross coming from all profitablenesse, and there comes
not to him any veins miseraices as to the other: the sixth and last is called
rectum or longam, and ends in the fundament, and has in his nether end four
muscles, to hold, to open, to shut, and to put out, etc. Next to be noted is
Misenterium, which is a texture of innumerable veins miseraices, ramefied of
one vein called Porta Epates, covered and defended of pannicles and ligaments
coming to the intrails, with the back full of Ligaments, and grandulus flesh.

The stomach is compound and spermatick, sinowy and sensible, and therein is
made the first digestion of Chile; for if it fail in his working, all the
members of the body shall corrupt; wherefore Gallen says, that the stomach
should be to all the members of the body as the earth is to all that are
engendered of the earth, viz. that it should desire meat for all the body, and
that it should be as a sack or chest to all the body for meat, and as a Cook
to all the members of the body; it is made of two pannicles, the inner is
nervous, and the outer carnous; this inner pannicle has musculus longitudinals
that stretches along from the stomach to the mouth, whereby he draws meat
and drink to him as it were with hands; and he has transverse will to
withold or make retention; and the outer pannicle has latitudinall will to
expulse and put out, and by his heat helps the digestive virtue of the
stomach, and by other heats given him of his neighbor, as the Liver on the
right side, chasing, and heating him with his lobs or figures, the spleen on
the left side sending to him melancholy to exercise his appetites, and about
him is the heart quickening him with his Arteries; also the brain, sending to
him a branch of nerves, to give him feeling; and he has on the hinder part
descending of the parts of the back many ligaments, with the which he is bound
to the spondels of the back.

The form of the stomach is in likeness of a Gourd, crooked; both holes be in
the upper part of the body of it, because there should be no going out
unadvisedly of those things that be received into it. The stomach is subject to
many passions, and the nether mouth thereof is narrower then the upper for
three causes. 1. Because the upper receives meat great in substance, and there
being sine and subtle, pasieth easier into the nether, 2. By it passes all
the chilosity of the meat from the stomach to the Liver. And 3 through him
passes all the dross of the stomach into the guts. And thus much for the
stomach which is likewise under the sign Cancer, and the Bowels under Virgo.

Next follows the Liver to be spoken of, which is a principal member,
official, spermatick, complete in quantity of blood, of himself insensible,
but sensible by accidents, and in him is made the second concoction; he is
enclosed in a sinnewy pannicle, and cruded, turns the chile, that runs
from the stomach to the Liver, into the color of blood. In the Liver is
engendered all nutrimentall: the seat of the Liver is under the false Ribs in
the right side; the form thereof is bunchy in the backside, and it is somewhat
hollow like the inside of an hand pliable to the stomach as an hand is to an
apple, and does comfort the digestion thereof, heating the stomach as a fire
does a pot or Chauldron that hangs over it: like wise the Liver is bound with
Pellicles and strong Ligaments to Diafragma or the Midriffe; also he has
Colligaves with the stomach, intrails, with the heart, reigns, testicles, and
other members; and in him are sive pellicles like sive fingers: Gallen calls
the Liver Mesasanguinaria and here are the places of the four Humors, viz
Blood, or sanguine in the Liver, Choler in the Gall, Melancholy in the
Spleen, and Phlegm in the Lungs; the watery superfluities to the Reins and these
four humors are thus distributed, from the spermatick matter of the Liver are
engendered two great veins, the greatest is called Porta, of whom springs the
miseraick veins, which are to vena Porta, as the branches of a tree are to the
tree it self, some of them be contained with Duodenum, some with Jejunium,
some with Yleon, some with Monoculus, or Saccus; and from all these guts they
bring to vena porta the succosity of chile, going to the stomach, distributing
it to the substance of the Liver, and in these miseraick, veins are begun the
second concoction, which is ended in the Liver So that this vena porta,
spreading it sefe through the gibbous part of the Liver, meet all in one, and
there makes the second great vein called Concava, or vena Ramosa, and he with
his branches draws all the blood engendered from the Liver, and with his
branches conveys it to all the members of the body, wherein is made perfect the
third concoction. Now to speak of the Chest or Gall, it is an official
member, spermatick and sinowy, as a purse or panniculer vesicke, in the
holownesse of the Liver, about the middle pericle or lob, ordained to receive
the choleric superfluities engendered in the Liver: and in the purse or bag of
the Gall are contained three holes, the first receives the Choleric substance
of the blood, that the blood be not hurt by the choler; the second sends
Choler to the bottom of the stomach to further the digestion; and by the third
neck he sends to the guts choler to cleanse them of their superfluities and
dross; next is the Spleen, or the milt, which is spermatick, and is the
receptacle of the melancholy superfluities engendered in the Liver; he is placed
on the left side transversely linked to the stomach, he is thin of substance,
and purifieth the nutritive blood from the dross of melancholy.

And next it is to be observed, that within the Region of the Nutrites,
backwards, the kidneys are ordained, to cleanse the blood from the watery
superfluities, they have in each of them two passages, by the one is drawn the
water from Venakelis, by two veins, called vena emulgentes, by the other the
same water is conveyed to the bladder, and is called poros urithides. The
substance of the Kidneys is Lazartus, longitudinall, placed behind on each side
of the spondels, they are two in number, the right Kidney lying higher then the
left, and are bound to the back with Ligaments, they are full of hard
concavities, therefore the sores of them are difficult to cure; there comes
also from the Heart to the Kidneys an Artery bringing with him blood, heat,
spirit and life; and a vein from the Liver, bringing blood nutrimentall to
nourish them withal.

The fat of the Kidneys is made or congealed of thin blood of great quantity,
serving to temper the heat of the Kidneys, which they have by the sharpness of
the Urine. And thus much suffices to speak of the Reins and Bowels, the one
being ruled by the sign Libra, the other under the dominion of Virgo.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Buttocks, Haunches, and Secret-Members.
THese are the lower parts of the Womb or Belly, and are adjoining to the
Thighs and Secret Members. Herein is to be noted the parts containing, the
parts contained, and the parts proceeding outward; the pacts containing are
Myrac, Syfac, Zarbus, and Bones; the parts contained are the Vesick or Bladder,
the spermatick vessels, the Matrix, and Vulva in Women; the Longoan, the Yard,
Testicles, or Stones and Cods in men, Nerves, Veins, and Arteries, descending
downwards, the Buttocks and Muscles descending to the Thighs: of which in
order.

First of the parts containing, as Myrac, Syfac, and Zirbus, of which it is
spoken already; but as for the bones of the Haunches, there be of the parts of
the back three spondels of ossasacri, or the Haunches; and three Cartaliginis
spondels of ossa caudt, or the Tail bone: Thus there is in every man thirty
spondels, viz. in the neck seven, in the ridge twelve, in the reins five, in
the Haunches six; and every spondell is hollow in the midst, through which
spondell passes Nuca from the brain, or the marrow of the back, and each of
these spondels are bound fast one with another, so that one of them may not
well be named without another: And all these spondels together contained one by
another, is called the ridge bone, which is the foundation of the shape of the
body. They be joined to the bones of the haunches, and be the upholders of all
the spondels; and these bones be small toward the Tail bone, and broad
toward the Haunches, and before they are joined and make os pectenis, each of
these two bones toward the Liver, has a great round hole, into which is
received the bone called vertebra, or the whirle bone: also besides that place,
there is a great hole or way, through which passes from above musculus veins
and Arteries, and go into the thighs. And thus of this bone Pecten, and of
vertebra, is formed the Juncture of the thigh.

Now concerning the parts contained, the first is the bladder a member
official compound of two nervous pannicles, in complexion cold and dry; the
neck of the bladder is carnons, and has muscles to withold, and to let go,
and in man it is long, contained with the yard, passing through peritonium, but
in women it is shorter, and is contained within the vulva. It is placed in men
between the bone of the share and longoan, and in women between the said bone
and the matrix; and in it are implanted two long vessels coming from the
kidneys, called porri, urickides, bringing with them the urine or water from
the kidneys to the bladder, which privily enters into the holes of the
pannicles of the bladder, by a natural moeing between Tunicle and Tunicle, and
there the urine finds the hole of the nether Tunicle, and there it enters
privily into the holes of the concavity of the bladder, and the more the
bladder is filled with the urine, the straighter the holes thereof be comprised
together: and the holes of the Tunicles be not one even against another,
therefore if the bladder be never so full, there can none go back again: The
form of it is round, in some bigger, and in some less.

There is also two other vessels called Vasa semiuaria, or the spermatick
vessels, and they come from Venakelis, bringing blood to the Testicles, as well
in man as in women, which by the further digestion of the Stones or Testicles
is made Sperm or Nature: In men they be put outward, for their Testicles hang
without, and in women they be inward, for their Testicles stand within. Next
follows the matrix in women, which is an official member, compound and
nervous, cold and dry in complexion, it is the field of man's generation, it is
an instrument susceptive, that is receiving or taking, for as the Adamant
draws or attracteth the Iron, so the matrix draws in the seed of man, and
Aristotle makes mention of a Maid that standing in a Bath where some seed of
man had been spilt, drew it unto her and conceived thereby; her proper place is
between the Bladder and Longoan, the similitude or likeness of it, as it were a
yard reversed or turned inward, having Testicles likewise within as aforesaid,
and is outwardly adorned with hairs, in them that be of ripe age; it has two
concavities or Cells, it also has a long neck like a Urinall, and in every
neck it has a mouth, one within, and another without; the inner in the time of
conception is shut, and the outer open as it was before; it has in the midst a
Lazartus pannicle called Tengito, wherein is two utilities, the first is, by it
goes forth the urine which else would be shed throughout all the vulva. 2. By
it the Air that comes to the matrix is altered and the heat tempered.

Furthermore, in the Concavity of this neck is many involutions and pleats,
joined together in the manner of Rose leaves, before they be fully spread or
blown, and they be shut together like a purse mouth, so that nothing may pass
forth but urine until the time of Childing. Also about the middle of this
purse be certain veins in maidens which in time of deflowring be corrupted and
broken, and these are called the Tokens of Virginity. Furthermore in the sides
of the outer mouth, are two Testicles or stones, and two vessels of sperme,
shorter then man's vessels, and in time of Coyt or copulation, the woman's sperme
is shed down into the bottom of the matrix, also from the Liver there comes
to the matrix many veins, bringing nutriment to the child, when a woman is with
child, and those veins, when the matrix is void, bring thereto superfluities
from certain members of the body, whereof are engendered women's flowers, etc.

Now in the matrix, which is the field of generation, is sown by the tillage
of man, a convenable matter of kindly heat, which seed of generation comes
from all parts of the body, both of man and woman, with the consent of all the
members, and is shed in the place of conceiving, and by the virtue of nature,
is gathered together in the Cells of the matrix, in whom by the working of the
man's seed, and by the suffering of the woman's seed mixed together, is engendered
Embryon. And further it is to be noted, that this sperme that comes both to
man and woman, is made of the most pure drops of blood in all the body, and by
(...)

The Cods is a compound member, and official, and as a purse ordained for the
custody and comfort of the stones, and other spermatick vessels, it is made of
two parts, the inner and the outer, the outer is compound made of skin and
Lazartus, longitudinall and transversall, as the Myrach, the inner part of the
Cods is of the substance as the Syfac, and in similitude as two pockets drawn
together, they differ not from the Syfac; and there be two, if there fall any
hurt to the one, the other should serve; the stones be two, made of glandulus
or carnelly flesh, and through the Didimus comes from the brain to the
stones sinnewes, and from the heart Arteries, and from the Liver veins, which
brings unto them both feeling and stirring life and spirit, and nutrimentall
blood, and the purest blood of all other members of the body, whereof is made
the sperme, by the labor of the Testicles or stones ut supra.

The groyns be the emy Junctures, or purging places unto the Liver, and they
have carnelly flesh in the plying or bowing of the thighs.

The hips have great brawny flesh on them, and from thence descend downwards
Brawns, Cords, and Ligaments, moving and binding together the thighs with the
Buttocks or hanches themselves.

CHAP. IX. Of the Thighs, Legs, and Feet.
THe thigh or Coxa is contained from the joint of the haunch unto the knee; the
leg reaches from the knee to the ankle, and is called Tibia; and the foot from
the ankle unto the end of the toes; the Thigh, Leg, and Foot are compound, made
as the arm and hand, with skin, flesh, veins, arteries, sinnews, brawns,
tendons, and cords, whereof in order.

Of the skin and flesh it is spoken of before; and as of veins and arteries, in
their descending downwards, at the last spondels they be divided into 2 parts,
whereof the one part goes into the right thigh, and the other into the left,
and when they come to the thigh, they be divided into two parts, or branches;
one of them spreads into the inner side of the leg, and the other into the
outer side, and so branching descend down to the Leg, Ankles, and Feet, and be
brought into four veins, which be commonly used in blood letting, as
hereafter follows; one of them is under the under Ankle toward the heel,
called Soffeua; another under the under Ankle, and is called Siarica, and
another under the ham, called Poplitica; the fourth between the little Toe and
the next, called Renalis. The sinnewes spring of the last spondel, and of Os
sacrum, and passes through the hole of the bone of the hip, and descends to
the brawnes, and moves the knee and the ham, and these descend down to the
Ankle, and move the foot, and the brawnes of the foot moove the toes, as is
declared in the bones of the hand; the thigh bone, or Coxa, is without a
fellow, and full of marrow, and round at either end; the roundnesse at upper
end is called Vertebrum, or whirlbone, and boweth inwards, and is received into
the box or hole of the haunch bone, and at the knee he has two rounds, which
he receives into the Concavities of the bones of the leg, at the knee, called
the great fossels.

There is also at the knee a round bone, called the knee pan; then follows
the leg, wherein is two bones called focile major and focile minor, the bigger
of them passes before, and is called the shin bone, and passes down making
the inward ankle; the less passes from the knee backwards, and descends
down to the outer ank'e, and there forms that ankle.

The bones of the foot are six and twenty; first next the ankle bone is one
called Orabalistus; next under that toward the heel, is one called Calcany:
and between them is another bone, called Os neculare; in the second ward there
be four bones called Raccti, as be in the hands: In the third and fourth
wards be fourteen, called Digitori, and five called Pectens, at the extremity
of the Toes, next to the nails: And thus be there in the foot 26 bones, with
the leg from the ankle to the knee; 2 in the knee, and one round and flat bone,
and in the thigh one; in the whole, thigh, leg, and foot, thirty bones: Thus
are we marvelously and curiously wrought in the nethermost parts of the earth.

Choice and select Receipts and Secrets for all manner of Diseases, Gunshot,
and preservatives against the Plague.
What Wounds are.
WOunds are in Latin called Vulnera, and of the Vulgar, Vulner: They are
simple and compound; the simple are those that are only in the flesh; the
compound are those where are cut sinnews, veins, muscles, and bones; and these
are of diverse and sundry kinds, and the difference among them is by the
variety of the place where they are, and the difference of the weapon wherewith
they are hurt; for some go right, some overthwart that offend diverse places of
the body: the simple are of small importance, if they keep them clean and
close shut, nature will heal them without any kind of medicine; but those
where veins are cut require Art, wherewith they must stop the blood, and not
suffer the wound to remain open, but sow it up very close, so that the vein may
heal; and those where sinnews are cut or hurt are of great importance, and
should be healed with great speed, so the sinnews may join with more ease: but
those where bones be hurt are of greatest importance; for if the bone be
separated from the other, it must be taken away before the wound can be healed.
And thus much for what wounds are, and their kinds.

Of the Syncope passion, or swounding through the cause of wounds.
GALEN says, that Syncope is a sudden decay of strength, through immoderate
evacuation, and vehement dolor, continual watching and pain,
intemperatenesse of the principal parts, or vehement perturbations of the
mind; but Syncope which follows in wounds springs of great effusion of
blood, or else of vehement dolor, and pain; the coming of it is perceived by
the weakness, pulse, palenefle of face, cold sweats about the neck and
temples; it is not lightly to be regarded because it comes suddenly, and as
the image of death, therefore the wounded man is to be comforted by all means
possible; if you perceive this accident come, give the Patient a piece of fine
white bread, dipped in the best Wine you can get, into which Wine put
Rose Water and Manus Christi, and Burrage water, and give him of the Wine to
drink, and comfort him with sweet smells, and chafe his temples with Rose Water,
and if he begin to swound, cast cold water on his face, chafe and rub his
temples with your bands, and pull him by the nose, thereby to revive and
quicken his spirits.

Of Luxation, or Dislocation, and their differences.
LUxation is a going out of a joint from a natural or proper place, whereby
the voluntary motion thereof is hindered; there be two differences of luxations,
according to the bigness thereof; for if the bone be quite out of his socket or
place, then it is properly called a Luxation: but if it be only a little
removed, then it is named a wrench. A joint may be four manner of ways
dislocated or wrenched, viz. forwards, backwards, higher, and lower: now to
reduce them to their proper places, there are four intentions to be observed,
the first to bring the joint to his natural pristine place: the second is the
conservation and keeping the joint so put in, that it slip not out again: the
third to defend the member from accidents, as dolor, inflammations, flux of
humors, and the like: the fourth to put away those accidents if any do follow.

How the luxated joint is to be reduced to his natural and proper place.
FIrst extend the member decently, until such time as the place betwixt both
bones is empty and void, then the bone which is out of his place is to be put
and placed in his native seat, that the emptines of the socket may be filled
again with the bone; this extension must be done tenderly, with as little
pain as possible; neither is there one way only of extending and stretching
out the luxated member, for sometime it may be done with the hands only,
sometime with bands, and sometime with Instruments apt and fit for that
purpose, as appears in Hypocrates lib. de luxatis and fractis.

How the member brought to his natural place, may be conserved in the same.
When the member is brought to his natural place, you must with all diligence
labor to confirm the part, and keep the member from slipping out again;
therefore annoint the place with oil of Roses, and apply unto it a fine old
linen cloth wet in oil of Roses, also use clothes wet in the whites of
Eggs, and apply them to the joint; wet your rollers in water and vinegar mixed
together, and roll the member therewith, and if necessity require, use splints
of Leather, or pasted paper, and apply them about the joint; but be careful
the part be not too hard rolled, for fear of inflammation; lay the member in
his natural figure, and unless some great and ill accident happen, open not
the member before the tenth day at the least; use not hot clothes or medicines
for fear of inflammation, but rather some refrigerative cerate: and labor to
defend the member from a flux of humors, by strengthening it with apt and
convenient medicines hereafter mentioned, keeping the Patient to thin and small
diet purging and letting blood if need require.

Of the Cure of broken and fractured bones.
TO the uniting of every fracture is required four things, first the joining
or putting together of the broken bones into their proper place: Secondly, to
keep and conserve them so placed without motion: The third is to conglutinate
and join together the parts of the broken bone by ingendring of Callus:
Fourthly to correct those accidents which follow the fractures of bones: first
to unite the fractured bones, if the member where the bone is fractured does
extend it self and stand upwards, and pricketh, showing an inequality when it
is touched: these be sure signs that the bone broken is out of his natural
place; wherefore the member is decently to be extended, and that part of the
bone that is depressed to be gently lifted up, and that which stands upward
to be put down, until the ends of the fractured bones do meet, and be
united, and brought to their natural proper place; but it is not possible this
can be done without some force and strength; so that if the member be small,
and of no great strength, as the finger or other like member, one man may well
extend it, and stretch it out, by applying one hand on the one part, and the
other hand on the other, until both ends of the bone fractured do meet and
join together: but if the member be great, having strong nerves, and tendons,
then one man is not sufficient, and you must diligently take heed, that the
member be not too immoderately extended or drawn out, for that does bring
vehement pain, and consequently Fevers, Convulsions, Palsy, and such
diseases, and oftentimes by this means the Fiberes and threads in the heads of
the muscles be broken: therefore let one man lay his hands on the member above
the fracture, and the other on the nether part of the member under the
fractured bone, so stretch and extend the member, till both parts of the bone
do meet, then form it together, till you bring it to its natural form and
figure, and when the bone is reposed in his place, then shall the Patient feel
ease of his pain.

To keep the bones that they fall not out again.
THe broken bone being thus reduced, and brought to his proper figure, the next
thing to be observed is to keep in the same that it start not out again;
therefore all means possible are to be used to keep the members without motion,
and to use apt and convenient ligature and rolling: But before you roll the
member, first mix the white of an Egg and oil of Roses together; and wet
therein a soft linen cloth of such bigness as may compass not only the
place where the bone is fractured, but also somewhat of the sound parts above
and below. Then this being applied to the affected part, you shall bind and
roll the member, diligently regarding that you compress not the member, by too
hard rolling, so that nourishment cannot come to it, and also pain thereby may
cause flux of humors and inflammation; neither must you bind it to flack and
loose, for then the broken bones will separate again, and go asunder; but
observe a mean herein, that you bind not the member too straight, nor too
loose, but follow discretion between both, and the feeling of the patient; and
as touching your rollers, you must have 2 made of soft cloth, whose breadth and
latitude must be such, as in rolling there be no looseness, wideness and
plaites. The beginning of the rolling must be upon the Fracture, and so rolled
about three or four times, and then rolling upward until you come to the
sound parts, which must also be somewhat rolled; by this means the bones united
shall more firmly remain together, and the flux of humors be stayed that
they cannot come to the affected part.

The beginning of the second roll must also be upon the fractured place, going
also three or four times about it, and so continuing downwards, until you have
compassed the sound parts: which done, you must with the same roller ascend
upwards again, until you come some what above the first roller, therefore the
second roller must be half as long again as the first, which suffers not
any flux of humors to infest, or annoy the part affected.

These rollers should be wet in water and Wine mixed together before you use
them, and if there be any vehement pain or inflammation, then the member should
be wrapped about with fine wool well carded, or else with stuffes well in
exicratum; And the ligature or binding must not be hard, but such as may keep
the united bones together; furthermore there must be used both to defend the
member from accidents, to keep it together, and to confirm and consolidate the
same certain plasters or cerats, which must be put upon the two rollers, and
as it were the third ligature or roll, amongst which is used Ceratum Humidum,
made of Wax melted in oil of Roses, but if there be besides the fractured bone
any solution or hurt in the flesh, then use not either Cerote or oil, for that
will make the ulcer filthy and stinking, but instead thereof use Plumaciols
that be long, dipped in red and st^p^^ck wine.

Now the better to keep the member, placed in his natural place from dolor
and pain, there must be used certain splints, to be put about the ligature at
the first dressing: these splints must be equal, smooth, even; not crooked, or
rugged, and in the midst thicker then in the other parts, the better to
strengthen the member where the bone is fractured: the way of applying these
splints is thus, there must be clothes three or four fold dipped in Rose Water,
and lavd upon the roller according as the member requires, then the splint
involved and wound about with wool, cotton must be placed round about the
member, a fingers breadth asunder, and bind them moderately and gently, that
you compresse not the member, and take heed that none of the splints touch any
joint, if any be near the fractured bone, for that will make ulceration, and
inflammation in the the same joint. Therefore if the fracture be near to any
joint, you must in that place make your splints shorter, smaller, and lighter,
and if no dolor, inflammation, itching, nor ulceration comes to the
fractured part, then you may let the splints remain on till the 12 or 15 day
or until the 20 day, but if any of these happen, then you must unrole the
member the third day, and foment it with luke warm water, whereby the pain is
ceased and the itching put away.

To Conglutinate and Join together the fractured bones.
THe fractured bones being thus put in their natural places, out of the bone
must grow the nourishment to Conglutinate and cause them to grow together; and
this is called Callus which like glue does Cement them together: wherefore
ought to be made grow, by all means possible. This Callus is engendered of
Gross and Earthly parts, for such is the nourishment of the bones. After the
mind of diverse it begins to grow about the tenth or fourteenth day, when it
be inneth to grow you shall perceive by these signs. The dolor and pain is
aslwaged; the inflammation cease: and the tumor vanishes, and the member
comes again to it is natural color. Now the principal way to engender
Callus is apt and convenient diet, at the beginning of the Fracture Hippcerates
counsels to use thin and slender diet, to obstaine from flesh and Wine the
space of ten days. But when ye come to engender Callus, you must license the
patient to use a more large diet, and meats that make good juice, and that
gross and somewhat viscous. Therefore Frumenty is much commended; also the
heads and feet of beasts, which nourish and be of viscous Juice. Also give him
to drink good red wine when he goes to meat, but that must be taken
moderately: the bigness of Callus must not be either bigger or lesser then is
requisite, for being bigger it brings pain to the muskels, and if it be
lesser it is unable to defend the fractured bones. How to keep it that it be
not too big not too little follows.

To remove the accidents which may happen to fractured bones.
THe accidents hindering the cure of the Fractured member, for the most part are
extreme pain, inflammation, itching in a wound, immoderate drynes or moisture,
Gangrena, hardness, and the quantity of Callus too much, or little. These be
the chief enemies that hinder natures work Therefore if these accidents do
infest and beseige the Fractured member, after it be bound, rolled and dressed,
you must with speed loose the Ligature and take away the roller, and then the
member being bare and naked, foment it with the Oil of Roses, vinegar, and
other medicines mentioned before, and do not use again either ligature or
splints before the pain be assuaged and the inflammation ceased, but only to
strengthen and keep the member together; but these accidents being expelled,
then use splints and roling, as before, and if this itching happens, then
foment the place with water temperately hot, and apply to it Vnguentum Album or
Vnguentum Populeon, and bind the member as aforesaid. Further if there happen
to the member any wound either at the breaking of the bone; or else made by the
Chyrurgeon to take out the shivers of the bone molesting the muskels: or if
there be any flux of blood you must labor to staunch it with convenient
remedies, as are herein set forth, if any inflammation follow, it must be
repelled if the flesh be broken and contused, then sacrifie the parts for fear
least Gangrena should follow, which if it should or any putrefaction, you must
endeavor to cure it as is set out in the ensuing medicines; and if none of
these happen, then use the like medicine to the cure of the wound as you do to
fresh and green wounds. Further if the wound be immoderately dry whereby the
growing of Callus is hindered, shall be convenient the third or fourth day to
foment the place with water: and when as the flesh does rise in a tumor, then
cease the fomentation unless it be to evaporate and digest the multitude of
matter, then cease not till the tumor goes away; and if moistness follow in
the fractured member and hinder the ingendring of Callus you shall put it away
by convenient ligature and roling and moderate exsiccation, now that the Callus
may be engendered of convenient substance, neither too big nor too small; you
must take heed to the diet, fomentation, and plasters; if you would increase
it, use plasters which do moderately heal, but if it be too big then use
medicines astringent, and a compressing ligature and plate of lead also
fomentations made with oil saltpeter, and salt water made hot. But if the
Callus be not grown at the accustomed time which appears if the member
affected be leaner, smaller and slenderer then it was naturally; then you must
apply unto the member hott atractive medecinet let the Patients diet be more
large, and cause him to embrace mirth, and bamsh heavynesse, and such passions
of the mind as may bring the body into a melar cholick disposition. And thus
much touching broken or fractured bones, luxations and dislocated joints.

A secret powder to stay the flux of blood in a wound.
Aluminis Succarini, Thuris, Arsenici, ana j. Calcis vini vj.

Make them (...) in fine powder, and put unto them one pint of strong vinegar,
and boil them on the fire, stirring it, till the vinegar be consumed, then set
it in an oven, or in the Sun, till it be perfectly dry, then make it in powder,
and when you will use it, take of this powder three ounces, Bolear moniack
half an ounce, Pulvis Alcamisticus one ounce; mix all these together, and make
them into very fine powder: and thus you have the powder prepared and sublimed
to restrain any flux of blood, when you use it, take 4 ounces of this powder,
and incorporate it with whites of Eggs; then make a boulster or stuff of Tow as
large as the end of the member you take off, or place where the wound is; dip
the Tow first in vinegar, and press it out again, then spread your medicine
on the Tow, and after strew a little of this dry powder upon it, and so make
many little bolsters of Tow, to lay upon this, as need does require for to
restrain blood.

Of Wounds made with Gunshot.
1. That the usual Gunpowder is not venomous.
COncerning the nature of Gunpowder, many have affirmed it to be venomous, and
so consequently the wounds made with powder must have the cure of venomous
wounds; I do not deny but there may be Gunpowder venomous, but the usual
powder is not, and that I shall show, for it is made of Zulphur, Saltpeter, and
Coal, neither of which are venomous; so that if the simples be not venomous in
themselves, neither can the compound be so: Dioscorides writing of Zulphur,
says that Zulphur does heat, dissolve, and concoct speedily; it is good
against the cough and short breath, taken in an Egg, or using the fume of it;
it takes away leprosy and scabs, being tempered with vinegar, and heals the
itching of the body; these be the words of Dioscorides touching Zulphur: Of
Nitre he says (which is Saltpeter) it has the strength and ustion of Salt; it
helps the Colic, if it be taken with Commine in hydromell, or new wine
boiled, or any thing that does break wind, as Rue or Dill; it is mixed with
Emplaisters, which do extract and dissolve; it does extenuate and put away the
Leprosy, used with warm water or Wine, it opens fellons mixed with ozen, or
Turpentine. Galen says, all kinds of Zulphur are hot, and do resist the
venom of poisonous Beasts, being used with old Oil, Honey, and Turpentine. Or
Nitre, or Saltpeter he says, it is a mean between Aphronitum and Salt, it
does dry and digest, and being taken inwardly, it does cut and extenuate gross
and slimy humors more then Salt: Aphronitrum (unless great necessity does
enforce it) is not to be taken inwardly, because it hurts the stomach, and
does extenuate more then Nitrum, therefore both Dioscorides and Galen found
Zulphure and Nitre so far from any venomous quality, as they used them as
approved and excellent medicines against venom. So that unless any will be so
ridiculous as to affirm the Cole to be venomous, the simples entering into the
composition cannot make the powder venomous.

And many times, Gunpowder instead of other medicines has been used in wounds
to dry and exsiccate, to the great comfort of the Patient; and therefore it is
not in mixture or composition venomous but medicinable, and has in him the
virtues obstersive and desiccative, neither in those that are shot with this
powder do there follow any of those Accidents which are inseparable in
venomous shot; and the cure of these wounds agreath with those that be contused
or broken, without the Addition of any medecin or Alexipharmacon against
venom, and are to be numbered amongst green wounds, such as are carled
bruised, Contused, or Crushed wounds. And now to the General cure of wounds
made with Gunshot.

Of healing wounds made with Gunshot.
TO the cure of such wounds properly belong two things; the one is to deliver
and cleanse the wound of all such things as are not agreeable to nature, which
are not only shot, iron splints or shivers of wood, cloth, dust, oil, or such
like, but also the clods of blood, matter, bruised flesh, and such like, which
you shall endeavor to take out with instruments for that purpose, or if the
wound be so narrow that it cannot be taken out with an instrument, then you
must labor to enlarge the wound either with tents, as the root of Gantian
pith of elder, or a piece of sponge, or if otherwise then to make incision with
a pair of Cassers or sheeres made for that purpose; there are also diverse
instruments when the wound is enlarged to take out such things, as Tongs,
Nippers, Terrebils, Crowbills, which a Chyrurgeon must always be furnished
with. Then to endeavor to cute the wound as you would a bruised, crushed, or
contused wound, and to take away the bruised as much expedition as possible with
convenience, without sharp and biting medecines, therefore you shall lay to
the contused place, or wound of Mercury precipitaete drachme 1. or as much as
you shall see cause, and mix it with simple oil, oil of Roses, butter, or
fresh Barrowes grease, and drop into the wound one drop of this oil
following.

. Refinae abjectinae v. Olei rosarei ij. sena: Hypericouis v. drachms, sem.
Momoraicae, iii. drachms.

The seeds must be bruised and put in a double vessel with the oils, and let
them boil half an hour, then strain them and keep them to thy use. This
oil does concoct and digest and preserves the sound flesh from corruption and
putrefaction.

A plaster good to extract such things as are fixed in wounds.
. Apostolicon descript. Nicholai 4 ounces, Magnetis orientaelis 2 ounces.
Pelipodij. Dictamialbi
ana half an ounce. Pinguedinis leporinae 2 ounces. Olei canabis 1 ounce.
Terebinthinae half an ounce.


Of these make an Emplaister which is marvelous drawing our rotten bones,
thorns, or the like.

But in poisoned shots, the medicines before rehearsed, are not sufficient,
butyon must give the Patient some Antidote or Alexipharmacon against venom or
poison both inwardly and outwardly: inwardly you shall give him every day this
potion.

. Vini cretiei, Sublimatae rutae ana 4 Tormentillaei Dictami
ana 2. drachms. Theriacae opt. 1. drachme,
let them be boiled till a 3. part be consumed, so reserve them for use.

Outwardly, into the wound you shall put oil of violets warm, which oil must
be made of Linseede oil; you may also wet your tent in that oil, and mix it
with your other medecines that you apply to the wound.

To cure a simple wound in the head made with gunshot.
First consider whether the wound be simple or compound, if the wound be
simple, the cure is easier and without danger if the patie^t have not a body
repleat with evil juice or have tasted of that co^tagion called morbus
gallicus, if the wounded patient be so affected, though the wound be small and
simple, yet trifling wounds in such bodies are not cured without much
diligence; wherefore in such bodies you must labor to cleanse the body thereof
by blood letting, purging, by sweating, and good diet, so that the body being
rectified, the cure of the wounds shall be the more speedy and easy.

Now to the cure of simple wounds in the head.

First let the hair be shaven round about, and apply this unguent following.

. Precipitati optimi 2. drachms Butiri salis experti, Oleiresarum
ana drach. 1. ss. Croci 2. grains.


Mix these and make an unguent, which you shall lay on soft linen cloth and
apply to the wound, lay on the wound also Bolus armenius, tempered with oil of
Roses and the white of an egg like an unguent to defend the parts from
accidents.

And this shall suffice for the first day: you may also at the beginning use in
stead of the second unguent this comfortable cataplasme following;

. Olei myrtillorum Rosarum
ana. ij Banlastiaum Rosarum rub: Boli armeni.
ana 1 Sanguis draeconis 1. dram. Mirrhe half a drachme.


Make of all this a Cataplasme according to Art and apply it the second day you
shall use such medicines that does digest and moderately dry the wound, of
which sort this is one.

. Terebinthinae lotae 1. ounce, Mellis rosarum 2 ounces. Butiri salis experti 3
drachms. Farinae hordei, Aristolochiae rotundae Radicis ireos
ana 1. drachme. Aloes half a drachme


Mix these and make them in an unguent and use it until such time as there
appear signs of concoction in the wound; then use no more butter in the wound
but this powder following.

. Sarcocollae 1. drachme Cocticum radicis papaver is half a drachme Farrinae
orobi Mirrhe
ana drachme 1 ss


Make this in powder and temper it with the other unguent, and use this until
the wound be perfectly cured; and this is the cure of a simple wound in the
head.

Of wounds compound in the head through shot.
IN the cure of compound wounds of the head you must first use insition; with
some instrument sharp and flat raise the skin and flesh from cranium, and if
you see any short or piece of bone, which may easily be taken out, you may do
it with some convenient instrument; but if it will not be without dificulty,
then wett your stuffs in astringent wine, and vinegar mixed with Bole armonicke
and Sanguis araconis, and lay it to the wound; then the next day following use
this receipt for 3. or four days, for fear of inflammation to follow.

. Boli armeni 2. ounces. Albumem ovorum 2. ounces Olei Resacei omphacitis 3
ounces Croci 3 grains misce.


Then you may use this digestive following, until the thing fixed will easily
be taken out.

. Terebinthinae lotae in vixo 3. ounces, Ovorum vitella 2. Olei rosati ij
Alloes 2 scruples ij Croci 4 grains misce s: A.


IN other things it differs not from the cure of simple wounds, But if any
vein under Cranium be broken, and makes effusion of blood, or if dur a
matter, or Pia matter be rent or torn, if Cranium be bruised, and thereby the
brain suffer, you must with all expedition set a trapan on Cranium and give
the wound vent, and take out the blood and matter or what else does depresse
the brain, and when you are constrained hereunto, make tents of cotton or
lint, and put into the Patients ears, and command a man to compress with his
hands the patients ears, least the noise make him too much afraid and faint
hearted and dippe your tents in stipticke wine or oil of Roses. And wet stuffs
in oil of Roses and lay them on the place, and lay upon the same cloth bole
Armonick mixed with the white of an egg and apply it to the wound to prevent
inflammation; and if there follows any corruption to any part of the brain
then use Vnguentum Egiptiasum which is most excellent in this case.

Of wounds in the breast with gunshot.
ALthough the wounds in all parts of the body are all one in effect yet they
differ in the cure according to the place wounded. Therefore if a wound be in
the breast and pearse not through, you may cure it like other wounds and the
first two days Vnguentum ex precipate, or some other of the like effect, also
use some medicines which will gently exicate and mundifie as mell rosarum
simplex, And after the fourth or fifth day use abstersive medicines make after
this manner.

R. Mellis rosarum 1. ounce Terebinthinae Butirirecentis
ana 2 drachmes. Farine berdei' Aristolochiae rotundae
ana 1 drachme


Mix these together and dip your tents in them, but on the wound lay this
medicine following.

. Album vnius ovi Olei rosati 1 Ounce. Boli Armeni 1 ounce. and half misce.


The rest of the cure of these wounds do not differ from other wounds.

Of wounds with gunshot in the belly.
WOunds in the belly or flank that pierce not through and hurt not the spine of
the back, are cured as simpie wounds in the flesh, but if the shot have peirced
through the belly and wounded either the stomach, Liver, spleen, kidneys,
intestines, bladder, or any of the great veins or arteries, then there is no
hope of life to be looked for; but if the shot have pierced the belly, and yet
wounded none of the forenamed members; then the shot being taken out there is
some hopes of recovery.

Therefore you must labor to take out the shot with a probe fit for that use,
but if you cannot without much labor do it, it is better that it remain
within, then to provoke mortal accidents, by laboring to take it out; for the
wound may be very well cured, and the bullet remain within: And if blood
bruised or matter be in the belly, use wine warmed and make injections, and use
this incarnative following.

. Thuris Alloes Farinae hordei
ana 1 drachme Terebinthinae Millis. Succi myriophili
ana 2 drachms.


Mix the flower with the juice, and dissolve and melt the honey and the
turpentine at the fire; then put altogether, and make an unguent: with this
spread your plasters and dip your tents in; and when the flesh does grow and
the wounds fill, apply such medicines as be astringent, and that do dry: and
if need be open a vein in the arm, and always keep the belly folluble.

Of wounds in the legs and arms made with gunshot.
THe cure is after the method set out before, first with your probe search out
the shot, and with your crowbill take it out; but if the shot cannot easily be
found, then proceed on to the cure of the wound and let it remain within;
instill and power into the wound the unguent made with butter, precipitate and
Egyptiacum, and let it pierce into the wound, then make tents and dip them in
the same, and put them into the Orifices of the wound, and when the wound is
well mundified, use some incarnative, as this following.

R Terebinthine, 2. ouces Mellis 1. ounce. Alloes Thuris Farinae hordei
ana 1. drachme, Aristolochiae, half a drachme.


And you must have a care that you make your tents daily shorter and lesser, as
the wound healleth; but if through the violence of the shot, any bones be
fractured and broke, then you must use a double cure: First, you must labor to
take out the shot, next to remove the contused and broken flesh, and to procure
the generation of new, and then you must come to the unition of the fractured
bones, and keep the same without motion, as is set out before in the cure of
fractured bones and dislocations, saving that you shall not use such ligatures
and splints in this kind of wounds, but use an instrument to lay the fractured
arm or lege in, and cover the member with soft clothes to defend it from the
injury of the air.

Of burnings with gunpowder.
THe cure is all one with other burnings of fire, but because those that are
much used to shoot in guns are subject to the flame of powder, I have placed it
here, if the skin be not ulcerate, you may apply oil of bitter Almonds, oil
of Olives, or juice of Onyons, but if there be ulcerations, use this Unguent
following.

. Olei olivarum, 2. pound. Secundae Corticis sambuci. 4. ounces.
Boil these on the fire, then strain them out strongly, after add to them
Cerussae half an ounce. Plumbi usti Lithargyri
ana 3. drachmes.


Mix them, and make thereof a liniment, and apply it: Thus much of gunshot.

To cure Corns in the feet, and the cause of them.
THe matter whereof Corns are engendered is a certain hot humor, whereof
nature striveth to be disburthened and discharged, and is properly rearmed a
Callowes matter, and this humor nature endeavoring to expel, forces it out
unto the lower parts of the body, even unto the very extremity of the toes,
where it cannot pass any further by reason of the hardness of the skin,
whereby it often ingendreth a hard tumor in the skin, which many times does
increase, and grow in hardness, causing such pain, that it does not only hinder
their going that are troubled therewith, but also many times breaks their
sleep in the night: This kind of tumor is commonly called Callo, or Corns,
and infinite number of people are troubled with this Malady; and many have
pretended much for the cure of them, but very few have perfectly arrived at it;
they may be very well eased, but the perfect cure of them is seldom, if at all
completed; the best way is therefore to pare them with a sharp knife unto the
bottom, where you shall find a certain matter; but if you find none, pare them
until the flesh be tender, and then dress it with the oil of Sulphur, or
artificial Balsome, and it will much help it; likewise the leaden plaster
formerly mentioned in this book is very profitable for easing Corns, being
plaster wise applied thereto; the juice of House-leeke if it can be
conveniently applied has been approved very effectual for this purpose.

little at once; and when it is boiled enough, which you shall perceive by the
hardness or softness thereof; if you drop a drop of it on the bottom of a
clean pewter dish, if it be hard, take it off from the fire, and when it is
near cold make it up in roles, and keep them in Parchment for your use.

A marvelous remedy to cure the Pestilence, Carbuncles, and such like.
TAke the seed or berries of Ivy, that grows on trees or walls, and gather the
said berries very ripe, dry them in the shadow, and keep them in a box of wood

said berries, and beat them to powder, and give the Patient of the said powder
as much as will lie upon a groat in a glass of white wine, then cover him very
hot in his bed, and let him sweat very well, then let him change his shirt and
the sheets if you can conveniently; some have taken of this powder over night
and been perfectly well in the morning.

How a man may preserve himself in time of Pestilence against infectious Airs.
BEcause the evil humors that be in man's body, make it more apt and easy to
receive the corruption and infection of the Air; it is good to keep the
stomach and the head clean purged, not to overcharge it by eating and drinking,
but abstain from all excess thereof, and also from all gross meats, and to
purge himself often gently with some easy purgation, as of Cassia, Rhabarb,
Mastick pills, Aloes, or the like: It is also good to eat in your pottage
things that purge the blood, as Burrage, Bugglas, Succory, Lettice, and such
like; and above all, not to keep your stomach overcharged, nor too empty, and
in the morning betimes to take some of these preservative medicines as Rue,
Figs, and Walnuts, which is very good against all infections, or else take some
Confect, as the pill of Citron Confect, and after meals to use the seeds of
Citron Confect in Sugar, which is very good against all manner of venom and
poison: And likewise at your meals to eat the white and inside of a Citron
with a little Sugar, and to eat it with meat as men eat Lemmons in the
morning, at noon, and night. It is also very good to bath and wash your hands,
your temples, your pulses, and your nose with vinegar roser, or with other
vinegar, whereunto you may add a little Camphire, Rose water, Lignum Aloes,
Xilebalsamum, if you can get it, if not, use a little Cynomon instead thereof:
It is always very good to keep such kind of vinegar by you in some viol, for
to use it when time shall require, for it is a very good preservative; and if
you cannot have the vinegar compound as is prescribed, then you may use vinegar
of compound wine; also it is very good to carry about you some good perfume,
either in your Gloves, or Handkercheife, or to hang it about your neck; your
house ought to be kept as clean as possible, not savouring of piss, or such
unsavory smells; keep it shut, and often washed, and beware ye keep no foul
and stinking clothes in your house. you may also often burn in your house the
wood and leaves of a Bay Tree, of Rosemary, Juniper, and Cyprus, use it often,
likewise Pitch, Rosin, and Olibanum, burning it in the midst of the house or
chamber, principally at night and in the morning: Likewise Orange and Lemmon
pills, Storax calamita, and Labdanum, be very good for this purpose. As
concerning the disposition of the mind, ye must consider, that Sorrow, Anger,
Sadness, or Melancholy, do corrupt the blood and other humors, weaken the heart
and spirits, deprave and hurt nature, therefore every man ought to avoid them
as much as is possible; also if a man be over much merry, or given to pleasure,
it dilateth and enlarges the pores and passages of the seed of man and the
heart, so that he is thereby the more inclined, and more apt to receive the
evil air and venom, penetrating into his body, also a man must beware of
drinking much wine; thsrefore it is good to use temperance and moderation in
all things, and above all things let a man always have a sure hope and
confidence in God, ever be ready and disposed to dye when he shall please to
call us, not so much esteeming this mundane or worldly life, or fearing so much
death, which is no other thing then an issue or departing out of this
troublesome life full of miseries and calamities, and an entrance into an ever
blessed and eternal life, replenished with all joy, solace, and pleasure,
which God has prepared for all them that love him through Jesus Christ.

back and womb, she is less then the earth according to Tycho six times, and
finisheth her course in a year.

Mercury is a Plannet, mutable and wavering, whose quallity for the most part,
is in drying, and equally moistning, for he dries when he applies to Mars or
Sol, and moistneth applying to Venus or Luna, and for that cause is said to be
of a changable uncertain nature, good with the good, and ill with the ill,

IF a man's urine be white at morning, and red before meat, and white after
meat, he is in health; if it be very thick and fat, it signifies pain in the
head.

Urine that is fat, white, and moist, betokens the Fever quartaine.

Urine that is bloody and fleshy, denotes some hurt and rotten Ulcer in the
bladder and reins, who pisseth blood without sickness, has some vein broken
in his Reins.

Women's urine that is clear and shining, if she cast often, and have no desire

Women's Urine that is strong white, and stinking, signifies infirmities in the

Urine of the color of water, having a dark sky, it betokens death.

Urine that has dregs in the bottom mingled with blood signifies death.

Urine black and thick, if the sick loath when he goes to the stool, it
signifies death.

These are the most certain and general Judgments of Urine; many more there
are, but I omit them as the most falacious study that appertains to Physic;
and if men trust to the urine, it will most usually deceive the learned
Doctor that is: I knew a Gentleman that was taken with a violent Fever, he
continued three days, the disease increasing the patient weakening; the third
day a Doctor saw his water (who I forbear to name, because he is since dead,)
his Judgment was that the patient was in perfect health, and had no distemper
on him; but that morning the small Pox began to appear on his body, and he had
them as full, and as tedious a disease of it as any man ever had: another
Doctor gave the same Judgment on a sick persons water, who died within half
an hour following.

Of Bathes
BAthes are natural and Artificial, the natural Baths of England are those
of the City of Bath in Somersetshire, in the West Country: The chiefest
matter, strength, and virtue of these Baths is Brimstone, and the chief ruler
in them; these Boths of brimstone do soften the sinnews, and do heat; they are
therefore good for the Palsy, for all such place, or joints that are pulled in
too much, or extended too far forth, they assuage the desire of often going to
the stool, and doing little or nothing; they scowre and cleanse the skin, are
good for the white Morphew and black, for Leprosy, and for all scabs, and
scurfs, for old sores, for the falling of humors into the joints, for shaking
or trembling of any member, they aswage ache, or the swelling of any member,
they are good for the gout, in the hands or feet, for the sciatica, they aswage
all pains of the liver and milt, and assuage the hardness thereof, they scowre
away freckles, and cure all kind of itches: Therefore whosoever is afflicted
with any of these diseases, may (by Gods help) be perfectly cured; but it is
necessary they observe these Rules following.

The Counsel of the learned Physicians is, that they should not at any time
go into any Bath to seek remedy for any sickness, unless it be such that
almost the Physicians despair of the healing of it, then let no man enter into
any Bath, unless his body be first very well purged, cleansed, and prepared,
for he that enters into the Bath with his body unpurged, may perhaps never
return home again, or if he do, he most commonly carries away worse
diseases then he brought to the Bath with him. Neither may you enter into the
Bath the same day that ye come thither, but rest and ease your body a day or
two. For the time of the year for Bathing, the most fit and proper seasons,
are the month of May and September, but the spring is the best, and likewise
for to take any manner of physic, the best time of the morning, after the Sun
be an hour high at least; and before any patient go into the Bath, if his
disease will suffer him, let him walk an hour or at the least half an hour,
before he enter into the Bath.

But you must at no time enter into the Bath, except you have been at stool
either by nature or art; ye may take a suppository or glister, and in great
necessity pills, but he that is so purged must not enter into the Bath, for the
space of fourteen hours afterward.

If any be counseled to go into the Bath twice on a day, he must not enter
into it, till six or seven hours after dinner, and tarry not, so long in the
Bath in the afternoon as you did in the mornings the common time of tarrying
in the Bath, is most commonly allowed to be an hour or more or less, wherein
respect must be had to the strength and nature of the Bath, as also to the
complexion, disease and strength of the patient.

Let no man continue so long in the Bath until he faint, but let him come out
before that, if he suspect any such weakness.

Ye must always go into the Bath, with an empty stomach, and as long as you
are in it, and as long as you continue in it you must neither eat nor drink
unless great necessity require it, so that you soon in the Bath, or be in
danger of sooning: as says Gallen, fourteen de methodo medendi, that no man
should eat nor drink until he has flept after Bathing.

When you come out of the Bath, cover your self well that you take no cold,
and dry off the water from your body, with warm cloths, and go presently into
a warm bed and sweat there if you can: wipe off the sweat diligently, and
afterward sleep, but ye must not drink any thing until dinner time, unless
ye be very faint.

And after that ye have sweat, and slept, and be sufficiently delivered, and
cleared from the heat, that you had in the Bath, and afterward in the bed,
then may you walk a little before you go to dinner, for by measurable and
moderate walking, the vapors and windeness that is contracted in the Bath is
driven away.

If the patient cannot walk, then let his body be gently rubbed, if his
disease can suffer it, after this ye may go to dinner, wherein you may use
moderation in your diet, always arising from the table with an appetite;
beware especially that you drink not any cold drink, and abstain from all
things that are cold, when ye first begin to eat, or drink, but let your meat
and drink be temperately warm, least when your body is inwardly hot with
Bathing and sweating, the cold strike suddenly into some principal member, and
hurt it.

They that are of a hot complexion and open body, ought not to tarry so long in
the Bathe as they that are of a colder and faster complexion.

It is most requisite for such patients as have any disease in the head, as
Catharr or Rheum, Palsies, or such like diseases, that the water be powered
strongly upon the mould of the head, and upon the nape of the neck.

The clay or grounds of the Bathe is good for the dropsy, and likewise for
shrunken, swelled, and hard places; which cannot be well healed with other
medicines: the manner of using it is, to lay the grounds upon the place and
hold the same against the fire, until it be somewhat hard, and then to wash
it away with the water of the Bath: likewise, those that cannot tarry long at
the Bath, may carry some of the water, and grounds home with them, and use it
there in the like manner.

If you be rid of your disease, by the Bathing, give God the Glory, go thy
way, sin no more, least a worse thing come unto thee: but if you be not healed
the first time, patiently wait upon God by prayer, and holy life, until the
next opportunity of using the means, and then if it conduce to Gods glory, and
thy good, thou shall assuredly be healed, by the Grace of God, of whom comes
all health of soul and body. But some, and two many, if the medicine or
direction of the physician do not forthwith answer their expectation, will
most impatient, and wickedly, exclaim against and abuse the Physician, and the
medicine both, as if they were to appoint God a time when they shall be healed,
and limit the holy one of Israel, but nolens voleus, they must stay the Lords
leisure; and let such as have been at the Bath, observe the same diet they did
when they were there, for the space of a month, at least, abstayning from
Carnal use of women, and if God please they shall have their desire; for, Is
solus est qui dat salutem etc. To him give the praise, to whom be ascribed, all
Praise and Glory, for evermore, in seculae seculorum. Amen.
