By the King.
A Proclamation for abolishing of abuses, by Bills of Conformity.
WHereas diverse Bills of complaint, commonly called, Bills of Conformity,
have of late years been exhibited into his Majesty's Court of Chancerie, and
other His Courts of equity, by sundry persons against their Creditors, of
purpose to enforce them, either to accept less then their just debts, and
damages, or to give longer days or times of payment and forbearance, then the
said Creditors were willing to do, pretending inhability and non soluencie,
sometimes by reason of sudden and accidental loss and damage, sometimes by
suertiship, sometimes by evil debtors, and sundry other suggestions and
pretenses, tending to no other end or purpose, but to defeat or delay their
just and honest Creditors of their due debts and damages: which Bills have
been exhibited, sometimes by the debtors alone, and sometimes by the debtors
and some of their Creditors by consent, or conniuencie between them: And upon
such bills diverse Decrees, Orders, and proceedings have passed, to the great
damage of the Common wealth, for that thereby has ensued as well the
imboldening of Debtors not to pay their debts in due time, whereby many men
have been disappointed, and not able to keep their credit with others, to
their extreme detriment, as also the encouraging of wilful Bankerupts, and
deceitful persons, and the scarcity of money (being the measure of all
bargains and contractes between man and man) together with a general
hinderance of trade, and traffic, and many other inconveniences, which by
reason of this late and dangerous invention of Bills and suites of conformity
have happened, as by due and just examination (for the reformation of so great
an evil, and for his Majesty's honor) has been found out, and resolved by
the house of Commons in this present Parliament: all which inconveniences by
the said Bills and suits of conformity have increased more and more, sithence
his Majesty (out of his Princely providence) has taken a more exact and
careful course touching Protections, then had been formerly accustomed;
whereby many and great delays of payment of debts, and duties, and of other
just causes of suites have been avoided, which in former times had been
occasioned by some kinds of Protections.

His Majesty (of his blessed disposition for the Weal of His Subjects) being
careful to stop the current of this growing evil, until upon mature
deliberation, an exact and full remedy may be provided by Parliament in that
behalf, Does hereby signify and declare his most gracious Will and pleasure,
and does expressly charge and command, That all and every Judge and Judges in
the said Courts of Equity, where such Bills of conformity do depend, for so
much of the matter in those several Bills contained as concerns such
conformity as aforesaid, and for and concerning all such persons, parties to
those Suits, which have not consented thereunto, shall forthwith, absolutely
dismiss the same, and that the said Defendants in such suits be not bound or
pressed to any further attendance in that behalf. And that all Orders,
Sentences, Decrees, Injunctions and other restraints or Process whatsoever
grounded upon any such Bill or Suite to the prejudice, hurt or hindrance of any
Creditor or Creditors (not having consented as aforesaid) and the execution of
the same, be from henceforth fully and wholly suspended, and not to be put in
execution until order and provision by some Act of Parliament, for a
perpetual reformation thereof be had and taken in that behalf. And that no
Bill or Suite of the effect or nature aforesaid be hereafter received, accepted
or allowed in the said Court of Chancery or other Court of Equity, until some
such order as aforesaid be taken in Parliament. And that all and every person
and persons now being in prison, or restrained of liberty, or standing upon
Bond, Bail or Mainprise, by or by reason of any such Order, Sentence, Decree,
Iniunction or other restraint, (and for no other cause) upon any Bill or Suit
of the effect or nature aforesaid in any of the said Courts of Equity
whatsoever, or by reason of any proceeding thereupon, be forthwith by the said
Judge and Judges of the said Courts of Equity, set at liberty and freed from
his and their imprisonment or restraint, and be discharged of his and their
Bonds, Recognizances, Bail or Mainprise for appearance, without molestation,
vexation or trouble for or by reason of any such Order, Sentence, Decree,
Iniunction, Restraint, Bond, Recognizance, Bail or Mainprise until such
further order be taken in Parliament as aforesaid. And therefore His Majesty
does authorize and require as well the Lord Chauncellor of England, as all other
His Majesty's Judges and Justices, and other persons whatsoever, having any
place of Judicature, and all and every His Officers, Ministers and Subjects
that now be or hereafter shall be, to see and cause this His Majesty's pleasure
duly with all convenient expedition to be put in execution.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the one and thirtieth day of March, in the
nineteenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
