A Proclamation for suppressing of light Gold.
WHereas by Our Proclamation dated the one and thirtieth day of July last, We
did express Our princely care and earnest desire to reduce Our Gold Coin to
one equal price and value, and to forbear the stamping of any more of those
unequal Coins, which were found not to be so useful for Our Subjects; with
this provision nevertheless, That such as then were already coined should
continue of the same value they then were, allowing certain remedies and
abatements upon every piece greater or lesser respectively, which Remedies, if
any piece of the said Gold Coins then already coined, should be found to
exceed, We gave free liberty to all and every Our loving Subjects, to refuse
the same in payment at their will and pleasure, thereby to take away (as much
as possible might be) all opportunity and encouragement from offenders, to
Clip, Wash, and diminish the said Coins, which then were, and now are
generally much fallen by such unlawful and wicked practices from their first
true value and goodness: All which Our Royal care and provision
notwithstanding, tending so much to the weal of Our people, We find the same
to be so greatly neglected, as in stead of making use of that liberty, which
was then given them of refusing such light Gold moneys aforementioned, as were
without the Remedies allowed by Our said Proclamation, they do now for the
most part accept in payments indifferently and promiscuously all such Coins
whatsoever, tendered unto them, without weighing or examining the true value and
goodness thereof, as were fit, and as they ought to do: Which strange
negligence we in Our princely wisdom and providence considering, and
observing that neither the regard of their own manifest loss and detriment,
which they sustain by such impaired and diminished Coins, nor Our earnest
desire to have them more careful, (not obscurely intimated also in Our said
Proclamation) can any thing prevail to have so foul an abuse redressed, as
with care and diligence it might easily be. We therefore not yet giving over the
care and welfare of Our loving Subjects, even in their particular interests,
but withal, entering into a more serious consideration how far this great abuse
may concern the state of Our Realm in general, by the continual waste and
consumption of all the Current Money within our Realm, if some stricter course
be not taken to prevent the mischief, are now constrained in regard of Our
Subjects long negligence of their own commodity, in lieu of that which Our
former Proclamation left in a manner to liberty and choice, to lay upon Our
Subjects a Charge and Commandment, to accept and refuse payment of the said
light Coins in certain cases, and upon certain conditions, but with that
moderation and respect, as shall by a very small present damage prevent all
mischiefs that can hereafter fall upon them in this case: And therefore do
hereby straightly charge and forbid upon pain of contempt and incurring of Our
high displeasure, That no manner of person or persons within this Our Realm of
England, from and after Midsomer next coming in any County of Our Realm do
presume to take or receive, or deliver in payment any piece of Our gold Coin
current within this Realm, and formerly by Us advanced at the rates aforesaid,
being clipped, washed or by any other means unlawfully diminished, or lacking
of the just weight thereof, otherwise then according to the Rates hereafter
severally expressed, and with the allowance of the remedies set down in Our
former Proclamation, That is to say,

In every piece of gold current for 33. shillings, 22. shillings, 16.
shillings 6 pence, 11. shillings, 5. shillings 6 pence, 2. shillings 9 pence,
The remedy shall not exceed 4. grains and a half. 3. grains. 2. grains
and a half. 2. grains. 1. grain. Half a grain.


All which remedies shall be allowed in every piece accordingly, and no
deduction or abatement to be made for the same, but to pass as if it were of
full weight and just value. But if any such piece of Coyue, lacking of his true
weight above the said remedies before expressed, shall from and after Midsomer
next coming be offered in payment by any person or persons within this Our
Realm, Our Will and pleasure then is, that for so many graynes more or less,
as the piece shall be lighter then the remedy, so as aforesaid allowed, every
person or persons, that so offers the same in payment, shall also at the same
time pay and allow, after the rate of two pence the grain to him that
receives it, for every grain wanting above the remedies respectively; And
every person or persons, to whom the same is offered to be paid with those
allowances, shall accept the same in payment as if the same were full and just
weight, any thing contained in Our former Proclamation to the contrary
notwithstanding. Provided always, that if any such piece of Gold, so offered
in payment after the time aforesaid, shall want above the number of so many
more grains then are allowed for the remedies respectively, as if the piece of
twenty and two shillings shall want more then three grains above the remedy
allowed, or the piece of eleven shillings more then two grains above the
remedy, and so of all the rest respectively; Then Our Royal will and pleasure
is, that in all payments between party and party, the same shall not only
be refused without all redemption, but that every person and persons to whom
such tender of payments shall be made, shall brand the same, by striking a hole,
at his and their pleasure, in every of the said pieces so offered in payment,
as likewise of any other piece that shall be found sowdered or unlawfully
imbased: rendering those pieces so stricken through, then presently afterward to
the Owners thereof again according as was ordered by a Proclamation made by Our
Dear Sister the late Queen Elizabeth in the nine and twentieth year of her
reign upon the like occasion. Provided also and We do hereby declare Our
intention and express pleasure to be, that if any of Our loving Subjects
shall hereafter bring any Gold to be coined at Our Mint, he and they shall
have a just and full return thereof, without diminution, by weight, or by
number, at the election of him, that shall receive the same according to our
former Proclamation, dated the one and thirtieth day of July last, deducting
for the Coynage; Assuring Our Self, that since We have hereby given so large
and sufficient a time for Our good Subjects to disabuse themselves by ridding
their hands of those light pieces of Gold which deceive and endammage the whole
Kingdom, they will betwixt the Date of this Proclamation and Midsomer so
provide, by timely sending in of that Coin into Our Mint, as may best stand
with their indemnitie, lest that the glut of making all that light Coin to be
Bullion after the said time, may not only prove hurtful, but in a manner
impossible unto them, since We are resolved (for the tender care We have of
our Subjects good) that this Our Proclamation shall be put to a real and full
execution.

And whereas by Our said former Proclamation, we were pleased to notify unto
all Our loving Subjects how careful We were (after the example likewise of Our
said dear Sister, the late Queen in the said nine and twentyeth year of her
Reign) to give order to the Master of Our Mint, for preparing a sufficient
number of just waights and balances, with true and upright grains and half
grains, for the remedies and abatements aforesaid, to have them in a
readiness before the first of September last past, to be delivered at
reasonable prices, to be rated by Our Commissioners for Our Treasury, or
Treasurer of England, for the time being, to all such Our Subjects as should
require the same, with express commandment, that the chief Officers in all
Our Cities, Boroughes, and Towns Corporate of this Our Realm of England, and
Principality of Wales, should before the last day of September last past,
provide to have one pair of the said Waights sufficient, at the hands of the
said Master of our Mint, within every such City, Borough, and Town corporate,
well and safely to be kept, for trial of the weight of the said Coins, as
occasion shall be: Which nevertheless, We understand is neglected, and though
the said Master of Our Mint, has performed that which belonged to his duty
and office, in making preparation according as We enjoined him, and that the
said waights and balances are reasonably rated by our Commissioners for the
Treasury, Yet has not any or very few, repaired unto him for such balances
and waights; By means whereof, all Our endeavor and Princely care for the good
and weal of our Subjects in this particular, is likely to be frustrated and
of little effect. We do therefore hereby once again, lay our express charge
and commandment upon all the said chief Officers of Our Cities, Boroughes,
and Towns corporate of this Our Realm of England, and Principality of Wales,
that before the four and twentieth day of June next, they do without fail
provide themselves of such waights and balances with upright grains and half
grains, which We have caused to be marked and stricken with an I. Crowned, at
the hands of the Master of Our Mint, to be safely kept within every such City,
Borough, and Town corporate, according as in Our former Proclamation it is
ordered: And We straightly forbid all Our Subjects and others whatsoever, to
have, or use any other waights then as aforesaid for the said Coins of Gold,
remedies, or abatements, or any of them, as they will answer the contrary at
their uttermost peril.

Given at Newmarket, the seventh day of February, in the seventeenth year of
Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save the King.
