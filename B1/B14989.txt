of money from Spain is remitted / to what purpose or intent the King will
employe / shall be known / as then mean / at the arriual of the Prince of

From Mylan news is come / that 700 thousand Crowns should be paid to the
Governor of Genua / and his Majesty likewise should handle with the said
Geneveses / that they should furnish the said Governor with 3 millions of
gold. This Governor has commaundemen^s strongly to arm. His Majesty has
the retained the third part of the Marchaunts of the West-Indische Fleet / but
offered for that unto them the custom of the Selt / which in that Country
imports 260 thousand Crowns.

At Paris is Mansieur Prinli / Ambassador of the Denetians very stately
brought to the audience to whom concerning Deltlin al required help is
promised.

From Vienna, the 27 of December, 1620.
The Lord Charles van Sherin remains yet here / that has denounced unto his
Majesty in the name of the Moravish States / that first then should have a
safe conduct. Secondly / a general pardon and remission. Thirdly / that into
their Country there should not be brought men of war. For this they offer
and have presented to receive his Majesty / whereupon this resolution is
taken: that notwithstanding they first where not worthy / nevertheless it
should be granted unto them / if they should show themselves obedient / those
that have been cause / his Majesty will not pardon / but shall be punished to
an exampel of others. The men of war should be brought into the Country /
but none should suffer damage / but those that should withstand. Whereupon some
of the States and Communs have declared themselves / but others would not trust
to it / and are departed till a sure pardon be given / and therefore the whole
armey is lying in Moravia / to cons^rayne the rebels to obedience / and march
to Brin / but some say that 15 thousand men of war expeet them there. Like
wise at Spalits / Olmits and other places are some thousands / that are
resolved to withstand the Emperor looking yet for many 1000. to do a great
expedition.

From vienna the 28 of December, 1620.
They say yet that Moravia should be delivered to the Majesty / but with
certain conditions but his Majesty will not accept them / but with condition
of grace and disgrace / whereupon they have sent hither Ambassadors to further
proceedings / but they are taken by the way of the Hungarians and some of them
are stain / notwithstanding they showed Patent Letters of the ^mperour /
whereupon answer is given unto them / that they where arrant knaves / they have
therefore written hither / that they can not come / and they mean that the
Moravians with this handling seek but to win time / and that Betlem has
assisted them with 5000 men.

The Earl of Buequoy is yet at Iglou / and the Armey of the Emperor at the
siege of a strong Castle not far from Brin.

His Majesty has revoked again the required Capital censure.

This Land-daye here goes yet forward / and his Majesty has sent a strong
Decretum to the Earl John Sigismund of Altensheym / that within the end of
this month of December he should set af all the Lutherian Officers / and
substitute Catholic in stead of them. The like should be done in the
Salt-ministery / and the Book-kee^ping.

After the Holy days the French Ambassador is minded to take his journey to
Bethlem Gabor / to make with the same an agreement / but his Majesty should
have answered / that he would neither consent to it / nor keep it bakward /
but he might do his pleasure / his Majesty had means to compel the
Hungarians to obedience.

From vienna the 30 hereof.
The enterprise we had again upon Presburg is unluckily proceeded and with

On Saterdaye last a certain Post of the Duke of Saxony is past through this
City / to declare (as they say) to his Majesty / that the agreement with
Silesia is succeeded.

There are sundry Patents of the King of Polen / to have Horsmenne and
Footmenne / because the Turk with great forces prepares himself against the
said King.

Notwithstanding that it was thought / that the high Officer of the Earl of
Mansvelt was dispatched to the Prince of Lichtensteyn to conclude finally the
old agreement / nevertheless all is gone backward because his commission was
not sufficient / whereupon here is resolved not to accept any treatise / but
to collecte all the men and Ordinance / to be conveyed to Pilsen and
Ellebogen / and to oppress them places with force / in manner as all
preparation is made already / and yesterdaye many Wagons with Artillery and
Munition of all sort is conveyed thither. As they say / the Earl of Mansvelt
is yet with the Dukes and Princes of the Union / and that the Cheef Captain
Frencke is at Pilsen.

This day certain Compagnies of Footmenne are sent out again against the
Presidium of Mansvelt / to undertake some special matter / the succes of it
shall be heard.

From Breslau the 1 hereof.
Here is an Ambassador of Betlehem Gabor who related that there is no hope of
Peace / betwixt the^ Emperor and the Hungarians / admonishinge and exhortinge
the Princes and States to Constancy of the Confederation / or else / that they
dooinge contrarily shall have in short time the Laund full of Turks and
Tartarians / and as they say / the Emperors Soldiers should do in Moravia
great damage, they will extermine the Calvinists and Piccards: the Lutherians I
grant / shall be in the same number / seeinge that at Olmits and Brin the
Curches and Preachers are taken from them.

From Ausburg the 13. hereof.
This day the Ambassadors of Ments / Colen / and Trier are gone from hence /
and to morrow the other shall follow / their treatise and commission has
only been of Contributions and Subsidies / and all Spirituals must now
Contribute and give ten of the hundred yearly / and that men of war shall
be conscribed again / and that the Duke of Bavaria himself shall prosecute
the wars again. The Cheef Captain Fngger has already some Soldiers in his
service / and gives much money at hand / and at Munchen likewise a great many
men are conscribed / because the Catholic Liga will keep for the Emperor an
Army of 40 thousand Men.

From Worms the 16. hereof.
Some few days past the Ship-bridge over the Rhyn is made much stronger and
prepared better as before / and over the Rhijn in the Forts a strong watch is
kept.

Some few days since is the Earl Frederick van Solms with some Horsmenne
dispatched to the Emperor / what his commission may be is not known.

In this Quarters with in 8. days from all places of the Palts are come 700
Wagons with all provision and munition.

In this City warninge is given openly with the Drum and published / that
who is desirous to serve / shall have presently money at hand.

From Franckfort the 18. hereof.
Letters from the Laund of Hessen declare that within the time of 14. days
many men are past thorough / so English / Scots / Flemings and other Nations
partly for the Electour the Palts and partly for the Unions and their
Neighbors and Princes / and some of them will take their journey to Bohemia /
and some to this City. And there should follow yet a great many people / of
sundry places / from the Land of Bruynswyck / Anze-citties and other quarters /
and such a great number of men are conscribed as never has been. The young
Princes of Weymere^ arm themselves likewise. The Soldiers of the Lantgrave
Maurits of Hessen are in the upper-Quarters / they keep them yet quiet / but
if the same Land should be assaulted of the Marquis Spinola / they will do
their best / to resist him / within 3 or 4 weeks strange news might well be
heard.

The Congregation at Zee-burg is finished after many and long deliverations /
and is finally agreed and concluded that his Majesty the King of Denmarcke
shall keep in the feeld 12000 men: the Duke of Brunswyck shall have likewise
an army of 6000 men / and the Duke of Lunenburgh of 4000 men. Of which
resolution they have sent a express Courier to the Emperor / with petition
that it would please his Majesty to conveye the Foreign Soldiers out of the
Empire / and restitute Frederike King of Bohemia in his hereditary Possession /
to come also to a wished peace.
