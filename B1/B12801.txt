A Proclamation prohibiting the exchange of Moneys for profit, the making of
Plate of any his Majesty's Coins, and the excessive use of Gold and Silver
Foliate.
WHereas his Majesty, by His Proclamation, bearing date the fourteenth day of
May, in the tenth year of his Reign; For the better staying of Treasure
within this Realm, and also for the procuring and inuiting of the same to be
brought, as well into His Kingdom, as to His Mint, did set the prizes of
foreign Gold and Silver, in their several Species, as by the said
Proclamation more at large appears.

His Majesty finding the same Proclamation not so duly obeyed and observed as
it ought to be, does hereby require and command, that the said Proclamation,
being still in Force, be for the time to come more straightly put in execution:
Not intending nevertheless hereby to revoke or discharge any Liberty which
the East India Company (being a Company that deserves so well to be vpheld
and encouraged) has, or ought to have by the lawful use and practice of their
Charter.

And for that the drawing of Moneys into the Goldsmiths hand, by turning Silver
into Gold, upon profit of Exchange, does make it the more ready to be
engrossed into the Merchants hand for transportation to Mynts abroad; And for
that such profit to be taken upon change of Moneys, is prohibited by Law:

His Majesty does further straightly charge and command, that no person or
persons whatsoever, shall from henceforth give, receive or take any manner of
gain, profit or advantage for the exchange of any Gold or Silver moneys, of
any his Highness Realms, or current within the same, above the Rates at which
the same are now current within the said Realm, upon pain of the forfeiture
of the same Moneys so exchanged, and the parties so offending, to suffer such
further Penalties and punishments, as by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm,
or by his Majesty's Prerogative Royal, may be inflicted in that behalf.

And furthermore, the better to keep the Gold and Silver of this Kingdom, not
only within the Realm, from being exported, but that it may also be
continued in Moneys and Coin, for the use and commerce of his Majesty and his
loving Subjects, and not turned into any dead Mass of Plate, nor exhausted and
consumed in vanities by Building, and the promiscuous use of Gold and Silver
Foliate, which have been in the Reigns of diverse Kings of this Realm
severally provided for, and prohibited:

His Majesty does likewise charge and command, That no Goldsmith or other
person whatsoever, shall from henceforth Melt, or make into any kind of Vessel
or Plate, or into any other Manufacture, any the Moneys or Coins of his
Majesty's Realms or Dominions, or current within the same; but shall only
Melt and make the same Plate, Vessel, or other Manufactures, out of old Plate,
foreign Bullion or Coin, or of Silver burnt out of Lace, and the like: upon
pain of the forfeiture of the Double value of the said Coin so converted or
made into Plate, and of such other penalties, as by the Laws, or by his
Majesty's prerogative Royal may be inflicted upon them.

And the better to prevent the unnecessary and excessive waste of Gold and
Silver Foliate within this Realm; His Majesty does likewise hereby prohibit
and forbid, That no Gold or Silver Foliate shall be from henceforth wrought,
used, or employed in any Building, Seeling, Wainscot, Bedsteds, Chayres,
Stools, Coaches, or any other Ornaments whatsoever, Except it be Armor, or
Weapons, or in Arms and Ensigns of honor, at Funerals, or Monuments of the
dead: And therefore wills and commands, That no Artificer, Tradesman, or
other, shall at any time after Six Months from the Date of his Majesty's
Proclamation, presume to Work, Use, or Employ in or about any Building,
Seeling, Wainescot, Bedsteds, Chayres, Stools, Coaches, or any other Ornaments
whatsoever, (Except Armor or Weapons, Arms and Ensigns of honor, or
Monuments of the dead as aforesaid) any Gold or Silver Foliate, upon pain of
his Majesty's high displeasure, and the Forfeiture of the same Materials or
Works so Siluered or Gilt, and to be further punished as contemners of his
Majesty's Royal Commandment.

Given at White Hall, the fourth day of February, in the Sixteenth year of Our
Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the two and Fiftieth.
God save the King.
