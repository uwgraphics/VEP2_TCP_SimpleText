The defense of a certain poor Christen man: Who else should have been
condemned by the Popes law.

Written in the hye Allmaynes tongue by a right excellent and noble Prince / and
translated into English by Miles Couerdale.

Love constrayneth me me (Right virtuous Judges) to take upon me the defense of
this Christen man / whom I se here accused to have deserved death. Nether do I
suppose it can displease you which be Christen / that one Christen man does
show a Christen work unto another. For allthough it might be esteemed a
strange and un wont thing / that I take upon me to defend a man / who nether
in name ner visure has been known unto me till this present day / nether I
also being of his kynne: Yet must the band of Christen love be considered /
which knytteth and coupleth unto us / not only our friends and such as do us
good / but even our enemies also and them that do us evil.

Inso much that by the commandment of our Savior / we are bound with body
/ goods and counsel to help all men without excepcion / what need so ever
they be in. How much less do ye suppose / that a Christen brother is to be
forsaken / which stondeth in danger of his life / and that for Christ's
doctrine sake / for the which no man (except he were far out of the right
way) dylieuer refuse to ioperde his nec.

Nevertheless (Right dear Judges) in this company that stondeth hereby round
about us / might doutlesse many be found / which could handle this matter
with more apt words / with more grauite / conninge and eloquence / then I. To
whom I was also purposed right gladly with all my heart to give place.
Notwithstonding as ye do se / among this great multitude of people / there is
yet none found / that in such a virtuous / fre / honest / profitable and
needful matter / would lay to his hands. Where as we se yet daily not a
small no^bre / that willingly / and earnestly / and with great diligence does
maynteyne open felonye / wicked periurye / shameful aduoutrie slanderous and
venymous matters / horrible robbynge / manslaughter / murthure / and other
beastly vices: and that either for vain favor sake / or else (which is yet
more shameful) for a filthy reward or lucre. Only this innocent Christen
man / which for the pure doctrine of Christ sake stondeth in parell of his life
/ has not one / I will not say to manynteyne him / but so much as ones to
comfort him. Is not this a pitiful case? O what a wicked time is this? But
alas / even as the ungodly and wicked are full of malicyous envye / so are the
simple both fear full and soon persuaded.

As for me / my lords / I have not feared to take this matter in hand upon
confidence in your wisdom and worship / specially for as much as I considre
it is not needful for me to use many painted words of glorious eloquence or
vain appearaunce / which nothinh to this matter apperteyneth: for as much as it
consists not in persuasion / but in the truth it self. It is a fre open
matter / and ought also freely and openly to be handled. Here must be no
disceate / no color / no cauillacion / but only the truth / which unto us
in this matter shall be abundaunt and sufficient. Only I beseech you right
worshipful Judges / that ye will louyngly / diligently and pacie^ly give
audience. Not that I have any suspicion / as though ye were unrighteously
minded against this innocent man. For by certain manifest tokens aneuydent
signs. I have parceaued all / ready / that there is not one of you all: which
is not minded to discharge him. Not withstonding I suppose it ought by all
means to be avoided / that men do not think / ye have quytte him more thoroww
favor / then by virtue of the law.

For our adversary in his co^playnte has used such cauillacion / yea even
for the nones and of set purpose / and has myxte there in so many and diverse
vain and feigned matters: Which among simple people might easily have an
appearaunce of the veryte /

That equity requires / and necessite constrayneth me / to confute all such
with the truth and substanciall reasons: To the intent that no dubte should
remain by any man. Nevertheless I am not therefore so careful to deliver this
ma^s life / who^ I hear defend: Yea he himself for the honor of Christ /
if need require / does not refuse to lose it. The only doctrine of Christ is
it / which I would feign declare to be without blemishe and undefiled. The same
only / the same (I say) have I taken upon me to maynteyne. For it am I minded
to do my best.

But now dear judges a fore I come to the head articles / I am aduysed to
talk a little with our adversary.

And now I speak unto the / in the lo^gh gown / I mean even the thou accuser
/ which / as I hear say / art called an inquisitour of heresy. And first of
all I demand of the / what moved the / to take that un happy officie upon
the? What worship or profit thoughtest thou to obtain thereby. Me thinks
(to say playnlie) thou have sought nothing in this matter / save only either
filthy lucre / vain pride / or wicked tyranny: Or happlie thou art so idle
from thine own busynes / that thou can handle strange matters / and such as
are no point of thy charge: Or else thou art so pure and clear from thine own
vices / that thou enquyrest after other men's offenses / with such curiosite /
as well besemeth such an holy Scrybe and ernest defendoure of the church of
Rome. A wonder full holiness verily / if it be so. And the same only thing (I
suppose) is yet lackyng unto thy perfect hiolynes / which have destroyed
certain innocent Christen me^ already. O how sweet a doctoure of diuynite is
this? Is not this a virtuous defendoure of the church.

But let us put the case (neuerteles without prejudice of truth) that this man
whom thou accusest / be an heretic / and utterly no Christen. Is it thy mind
/ that he shall therefore in all the haist be ha^led unto the hangman / and put
to death? dyddest thou ever read / that Christ and his disciples commaundes to
slaye such as received the faith: or that after they had received it / fell
away from it again? I suppose not. Nevertheless thou might weel have red /
that the unbelievers ought ge^tly to be instruct and taught like as they that
are fallen / ought after a brotherly fashion to behelped up again and
exhorted: and that they which of an obstinate mind will hear no exhortacion /
ouhht to be eschued and avoided / but not in all the haist put to death. Thou
with thy bitter accusacion / think to bring this Christen man in to danger
of his life. But how far the same thy complaynte is from the wholesome
doctrine of Christ and his disciples / may thou considere thy self.

Yff thou had been minded to make inquisicion for heresy / whereby thou
nughtest help thy brother which is fallen and bring him from his errower unto
the right way / then were thy diligence to be commended. But now for as much as
thy desire is to murder him like a beast / thy cruelty must be reproved.
Nether can I discern for what intent thou should by right condemn him unto
death except it be for some other offense then lack of faith. For either he
has never been a Christen man (which were teme^arious to affirm / for asmoch
as he was baptized in Christ / and has openly confessed Christ / were of noma^
doubts) Or else is he fallen away from Christ / which thou shall never be
able to prove. Now though thou could verify one of these two acording to
thy mind / yet shall it be found / that thou have wrongfully accused him to
have deserved death.

If one should accuse a Jew at the law that he were worthy to dye / because
he holds nothing of Christ / would not every one say / that he were a mad
man? Not that I will excuse the wicked infidelite of a Jew. But because that in
this case / the judgment appreteyneth not unto man / but must be referred unto
god. There dwell Jews now also in many parts of Christendom / not only in
safegarde / but occupy also / and that openly.

As for the Turks which of a very insatiable gredynes toward tyranny / vex
us horribly and all that we have / yea spare no manner of age ner kind / No man
judges it wrong to destroy them in battayll. But to murthur their wifes and
children because they believe not in Christ / do I take for a very beestly
thing: And specially out of war in the time of peace / wha^ the Turks them
selves / in matters concerning the faith / are nothing cruel against us.

It is not mete / to make a deuorce of marriage / for only vnbeleues sake: so
long as the unbelieving husband refuses not to dwell with the beleuynge wife /
nether as long as the unbelieving wife resuseth not to dwell with te beleuynge
husband. A Christen servant is bound to render to his unbelieving master his
due obedience / and that not to the eye sight / but from the heart / eue^ as if
he served Christ himself: Much less than shall he take a pon him to have power
to hurt him. And thou think that a man ought to be slain / to whose charge
thou can lay no thing save only enfidelite. Madd and indiscreet art thou /
If thou so beleuest: Yea desperate and ungodly / If thou beleuest no such
thing / and yet will thou persuade other men / to bring this innocent in
ioperdye of his life. Notwithstondyng I know already / what thou will say
thereto.

I accuse no Jew (will thou say) no Turk / no heithen: What have we to do
with the^ that are with out as. S Paul says. I do accuse a rennagate and
Apostata: who though he be baptized in Christ / and louyngly received in to the
womb of our mother the holy church / yet through the counsel of the deuel /
has he not been ashamed to fall from the right faifh and to cleue unto
certain men's heresies / against the cammaundement of the church: Another was he
therewith satisfied / but through his false persuasio^ has he gone about to
bring many moo / even in to such like errous. Such one / as I suppose / ough
to be hewn off from the body / as a corrupt membre: to the intent that the
sore frett no farther.

Have I understand thy mind? Thou have nodded with thy head. I perceive that
I have not gessed amysse. Now well tha^ / thou grauntest that he is baptized in
Christ and louyngly received in to the womb of our mother the holy church I
desire no more. Thou art gone from the first step that tow stodest upon.
Whereby I hope / that upon the other step whereon thou now stondest / thou will
not long continue.

With few / but with true reasons now have I declared unto the already / that
one which was never no Christen / ought not to be slain for only vnbeleues
sake / without other offenses. But now will I brefely show the what I suppose
ought to be done with such as are Christened / and yet through heresy and
errors concerning faith / or through other sin and vice / are fallen from
Christ. For Christ is two manner of ways denied / not only with word / but
also with deed / while there be many / that are ever ready to praise Christ
with their words and yet in their deeds are so openly against him / that
thereby it may be easily perceived / that / except the vain bare words /
they have no Christian point in them. If thou now have taken upon the / at the
Judgment seat of thelawe to accuse all such as vnchriste^ / as verily they be
in deed / when shall thy accusacion then and complynte have an end? If thou
meanest / that they ought immendialy to be slain as soon as they fall / what
place then shall repentance have? Who shall have leisure than to do penance /
or to amend?

Will thou also be so shameless / as to deny forgyuenesse of sins unto the^
that truly amend? Or can thou be so cruel / that thou will look for no
conversion / But immediately destroy the man boeth body and soul? Hou can
thou know (thou unreasonable man) wha^ / how / or by what mean / god as a
merciful father / will call sinners again unto true faith and repentance /
who upon Peter's question / command him to forgive his neighbor seven and
seventy times? Beleuest thou him to be so unmerciful / that what he
commands a man to do / he will deny the same / to such as pray unto him?
Away / away I say with this thy vnco^uenie^t and blasphemous opynion. God
says: I will not the death ofsymer / but rather that he co^uerte / and live.
Thou cryest: An heretic ought to be brent. And why so I pray the? lest he
should convert / and so live. With this voice discouerest thou thy self
already / that thou art achilde of the deuel / which is amurthurer from the
bekynnyng. I preceaue thou have changed thy color for very anger. I have
touched thy holiness to sore. Perdon me if I have done amysse I would have
dealth more friendly with the / if thou with this thy indiscreet and
unreasonable accusation / had not be wrayed thy self.

But lest thou should think that I favor such as deny Christ in word or
deed / or such as blaspheme god / being often exhorted / well and truly taught /
yea conuycte with substanciall reasons out of the scripture / and yet will
never leave their vnco^uenie^t and false opynio^: lest thou should think (I
say) that I favored any such / I will declare mine opynion / and that not out
of mine own brain / but such an opynion as is past all dowte / certain and
sure / yea even spoken by the holy mouth of Christ him self.

If hewill not hear the church (says Christ) than count him as an heithen
and open sinner. Has not Christ with these words declared / that scuh as are
dishobedie^t unto his church and congregation / ought to be excluded from the
felashippe of the good? Why lachest thou so heartily / as though it were but a
trifle a man to be excluded from the felasshippe of saints? Me thyinkeh thou
wotest not well what matter it makes / wha^ by the auctorite of the keys /
one is separated out of the church. Verily I say unto you (says the lord)
what soever ye bind upon earth / shall also be bound in heaven. ^oo / there have
thou no vain opynion / but an assured iudge^mt out of the mouth of our
Savior himself.

The Apostel Paul commands to eschew an heretic / after that he is
sufficiently warned. And the man which kept his stepmother / delyuereth he
unto the deuell that the sprete may be saved at the latterdaye. Did he
therefore conde^ him unto death / because he wrythet to deliver him unto Satan /
to the destruction of the flesh. That be far from the ecxellent love of Paul
/ that he would not rather help up a brother that were fallen / the^ utterly
to cast him a awye? The co^clusio^ also of the matter / which followed thereof /
declares it self / that he meant not to have him slain / but to have him
pourged out as an old leue^ to the intent that he should not sour the whole
lo^pe of dow / and that at the last he might amend / as he did in deed. For in
the second Epistole to the Corinthians he commands / that for as much as the
same man came to knowledge and repentance / they should vith all loving
kyndnesse take him up again / forgive him his offense / and comfort him in
his heaviness / lest he should be swalowed on (or fall in despair) through over
much sorrow. All which things could not have come to pas / if the man in all
the haist had before been prevented with death. O the right godly patience and
long suffringe of our Savior / who as a god shepherde leaving the nine and
nyentie sheep in the wildernisse / seeks it that is lost: not to cast it unto
the wolffe to be dedeuoured / but louyngly to bring it again in to his sheep
fold.

Now vnderstondest thou / that mine opinion (yea the opynion of Christ) is
confirmed with scriptures / with examples and by Paul him self. Nether can it
help the / though thou obiectest unto me the parable of the gospel / where in
the householder commands his steward to hew down the vnfrutef^ull tree / if
it bring no more fruit. For such knowledge of time must only be refered unto
god / as unto him that only knows the hertes of all men. Else had noc Christ
forbidden to pluck up the wedes before the harvest.

Yet must I declare unto the / what bodily hinderaunce must grow and follow
out of this sentence of excomunicacion / to him that is condemned there in: lest
thou should think my mind were to judge no forther / but with bare words
only to have him excluded from the co^munyon of the Christian.

Thou have heard the fearful thonder bolt of our Savior: what so ever ye
bind upon earth / shall also be bound in heaven. Thus is he then already put
out of the book of life / and lyuinge dead. Believe me / it is an heuye
punishment. I wot not where to find a sorer. But they that in their hearts
are more moved with wordly matters / let them hear this that follows.

All honest virtuous persons shall eschew him. Howbeit such a one as has so
denied Christ / that he has also cast from him all sham fastness and honesty
/ might peradventure not greatly care therefore. From all worshipe (if he were
in any) and worshipful offices shall he be deposed. All Christian shall abhor
him / and ernestly hate his infidelite / and yet love his parsone / as it
becomes the disciples of Christ: to the intent it may appear / that such
punishment is laid upon him / not of malice or evil will / but done all to
the intent / that he through such temporal correction / might convert / and be
reserved unto Christ the lord for ever.

Have I said enough now to thy cruelite with this my declaracion? Or is not
this sufficient? Take heed / I advise the / that in judging other men to
sore-thou condemn not thy self. For I trust I will shortly bring to pas /
that it shall be manifest and open unto every man / hou that thou thy self art
even te same heretic / to who^ the forsayde punishment by right and reason
belongs.

Now turn I me again unto you (Right prudent judges) having no small
confidence in your syngular worshipe and grauyte / forasmuch as I know that
ye will give no sentence / but such as accords with equity / and serves to
the honor of Christ: yea right glad I am to se / that the same lies now in
your auctorite.

And because I purpose not to hold you up long with vain words / I will now
come to the matter / which I suppose concerns not only him that here
stondeth upon life and death / but every one of us also that seek the honor
of Christ. I will bring in no new thing / or that hitherto has not been heard.
For in this matter / where we have now continually gone about more then twenty
years / what can be spakon that has not been offt spoken before? What can be
me^cioned / that has not affore been preached openly / and (as they say) upon
the house tops? I suppose it not needful to teach you in this matter / but
only to put you in remembrance and to exhort you? Wherefore I beseech you /
ye will but even patiently hear me / acording as ye have hitherto done
already.

I perceive (right dear judges) that our adversary hat grounded his whole
accusacio^ her upon / that he will say: how that this Christian man is fallen
from the holy Christen church. Wherefore I se well / I must first e^deuoure my
self to declare unto you the true description of the church. Which if it be
well known and understood / I perceive that all the rest may lightly be
discussed / and preadue^ture the sooner brought to an end.

As touching this: we believe an holy Chatolike or general church / which is
the feloshhippe of saynctes. Here ye se (righ dear judges) with how few words
the true description of the church is set forth before our eyes.

Whereby we may evidently percaue / that the holy Catholic church is nothing
else but a feloshippe of saynctes. And the same is also the bryde of Christ
without spot or wrynckle / purified through the blood of the brydgrome
himself: even the heavenly jerusalem / in to the which / no unclean person
comes: the most holy temple / where into is entered our bishope Jesus Christ /
who is a pressed for ever after the order of Melchisedech. This I say / is the
church builded upon the roke / against the which nether the winds / ner the
waves of waters / no ner the gates of hell / ca^ prevail: the head and
fundacio wheoff is Christ himself.

To this church pertayne all they / that syns the beginning of the world have
been saved / and that shall be saved unto the end thereof. For they are the
lyuinge stones of this heavenly jerusalem and of this most holy temple.

Know ye not (says. S. Paul) that ye are the tempel of God / and that the
sprete of god dwelleeh in you? If any man defyle this temple / him shall god
destroy: for the temple of god is holy / the same temple are ye.

Even this church / does this Christian brother of ours believe steadfastly ^ yea
and in this church also believes he forgyuenesse of sins / and after the
resurrection of the flesh an everlasting life. Why say thou than / that he
is falelen away from the church? To the speak I now / thou unreasonable
accuser: What have thou yet more to lay to his charge? He believes in god the
father almighty maker of heaven and arth / and in Jesus Christ his only
begotten son our lord / which was conceived of the holy ghost / borne of
Marye the virgyn / suffered under Po^tius Pilate / was crucified / dead and
buried / descended unto hell / on the third day rose again from death /
ascended unto heaven / sits at the right hand of god the father allmightye /
from thence shall he come to judge the quycke an dead. He believes also in the
holy ghost / and all the rest that we mentioned before of the church. He believes
likiwise all that is written by the prophets and other old fathers of the
old testament. In like manner believes he all that in the gospels is written of
the acts and doctrine of Christ. He confesses also that the doctrine of the
Apostles and disciples of Christ is not to be dowted upon. Moreover he believes
that whatsoever the holy fathers of the new testament have written / is true /
so far as it is not contrary to the doctrine of Christ and of his Apostles.

With this true and fre confession of faith / I suppose thou art so satisfied /
that now thou will not stick with all expedicion to quyte this Christen man /
and faithfully to commytte him unto the judges as a right membre of the church:
and for as much as thou have unadvisedly accused him as an heretic and as a
rennegate from the church / and have done him wrong / I hope thou will therefore
ask him forgiveness. But I se well / thou shakest thy head / bytest thy
tethe one upon another / and art be come (as me thinks) nothing the mylder.
Wherefore behold I beseech you / how shameless this man is / if I may call such
one a man / which so vnma^ly deals / that I suppose he has forgotten / that
he himself is a man. I doubt not right dear Judges / but the same fre
confession of this Christen man is sufficient enough to quyte him / and that in
your judgment he neadeth no farther clearyng of himself. Notwithsto^ding lest
our adversary should report / that I have said nothing to the ordely
rehearsal of his accusacio^ / but wittingly passed over it: or how that I am
so short of memory / that I have forgotten what he has laid for him self:
therefore will I rehearce it all again: to the intent that wha^ I have repeted
his dishonest complaynt / and confuted it / every man may understand / that he
is smytten with his own swerd. Ye have perceived / I suppose / that his whole
accusacion consisted in eight principal articles / which I will now repete in
order / that if any thing there in have been forgetten / it may be called unto
rema^braunce again.

This heretic (says our adversary) does affirm.

First / that the bishope of Rome is not the head of the church ner the true
vycar of Christ.

Secondly: that the mass is no sacrice ner ought to be used for other.

Thirdly: that the supper of the lordt ought to be mynistred in fourmes both of
bread and wine / and that also unto the lay people.

Fourthly: that there is no purgatory / and that suffragies for the deed are in
vain / and supersticious.

Fyfthly: that it is not necessary to call upon saynctes.

Sixthly: that auricular confession was nether commanded ner institute of
Christ and his disciples.

Seventhly: that on the days prohibited and forbidden by the church of Rome /
it is no sin to eat flesh.

Eightely / and finally / he says planely / that prestes may mary.

These (ye dear Judges) are the foul misdedes: these are the horrible vices:
these are the detestable blasphemies: her off comes the great vproure and
horrible noise of heaven and earth / where through it is to be feared / that the
four elements will come together / and that the world will return in to his ol
darcknes and confusion again.

And why do not we all rent our clothes / and stop our ears after the
manner of the Jews / and cry ewith loud voice? He has blasphemed: Crucify /
Crucify. Such a matter might happly be laughed at / if it were showed in the
way of ieasting / and to make the people a pastyme with all. But for as much as
the matter is now handled in Judgment / and brought so farreforth / that this
Christen man is like to suffer death therefore / Me thinks every faithful
Christen man ought from the ground of his heart to bewail it.

But now let us examen the first article / and pondre well / what is to be
holden of the bishoope of Romes power. All Christian men do confess / that the
holy Catholic (or universal) church / is the feloshippe of saynctes.

And this is the one only church / wherein is but one lord / one faith / one
baptyme / one god and father of all things. But for as much as we say: I
believe an holy universal church / we do confess / that the same is not
visible ner corporal. Notwithsto^ding in the scripture / there is named yet
another church which is both visible and corporal.

Whereunto the keys of the kingdom of heaven are committed / which the lord
also means when he says: Tell it unto the church. In the which church all
they are comprehended / that are named Christen / good and evil / wherein also
the tares grows with the wheat until the time of the harvest.

Nevertheless this is not an one only church / but distributed in to many
parts: for it were impossible to have / in one place an one only co^gregacio^
of all Christen together / seeing they dwell so far one from another / and be
of so sondrie lanhages and manners. Therefore the Apostles as we do read / have
in all parts ordyned as many churches / as they thought necessary acording to
the nature of the countrees: And gave unto every church their peculiar bishop
/ to keep the lords flock: whom the also called pressed or elder: geuyng them a
title of reputacion / either because of their age / or by reason of their
excellent grauyte and virtuous conversation. To such men was committed the care
of Christ's flock and the mynistracion of gods word / to rule the people / and
to feed the flock of Christ with all.

As for hye bishope / under Christ they knew none. They had al like auctorite.
Every one had the oversight of the flock that was committed unto him. But wha^
any doubt arose / they used not to show it unto one alone as to the head / or
to the^ all (which was impossible) but unto certain: who when they had called
upon the name of the lord / knew in the holy ghost / what was to be done / as
we may openly se in the Acts of the Apostles. Wherefore me thinks it a great
wonder that ever the church of Rome came in such reputation / that it has
hither to been taken of many for the head of all churches / yea for the one
only Catholic or universal church: considering that in holy scripture it
has no testimonye that may truly be alleged to any such purpose. For we have
declared now already / that there is not one only visible church: which thing
appears evidently out of the words of Christ / when he says tell it unto
the church. Should he now run from jerusalem unto Rome / to tell his
brothers fault? Therefore be there many churches or co^gregacions / wherein the
children of god in this veil of misery are myxte among children of the deuel /
which inco^uenie^ce also they daily compain of

But let us se with what reasons or rater cauillacions / our adversary goes
about to maynteyne this his Romshe church / and his grau^dsyre pope or
bishop of Rome. We read in the gospel / that Christ asked his disciples:
who say ye that I am? Peter ansuered and said: thou art the son of the
lyuinge god.

Whereupon Jesus said unto him. Blessed art thou Simon Jonas son / for flesh
and blood has not opened that unto the / but my father which is in heaven.
And I say unto the: Thou art Petrus (that is / apperteyning to the stonye
rock) and upon this rock will I build my church / and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it. And I will give the the keys of the king ome of
heaven: and what soever thou byndest upon earth / shall also be bound in
heaven: And what soever thou loosest upon earth / shall be loosed also in heaven.

This promise of Christ / which we also believe steadfastly to be fulfilled /
takes our adversary upon him to wraist unto his opynion. How now (says he)
did not Christ playnlie say: Thou art Petrus / and upon this rock will I build
my church: and I will give the the keys of the kingdom of heaven?

Who I pray the / denies that the church is builded upon a strong rock? who
will not grant / that the keys were committed unto Peter? Nevertheless we will
seek the true vndersto^ding of this promise. When Peter had consessed Christ to
be the son of the lyuinge god / the lordt said unto him: blessed art thou
Simon the son of Jonas / for flesh and blood has not opened that unto the
but my father which is in heaven. Whereby Christ ^s the gift of god / and
comes of the father of heaven. Now follows the promise for the faithers sake:
and I say unto the / that thou art Petrus / here gives he him another name /
not Simon Jonas son / but Petrus / as one that cleueth or belongs unto the
rock.

And upon this rock (says he) will I build my church: as though he should
say: blessed art thou / for as much as through gods reuelacion / thou co^fessest
/ that I am the son of the living god. And therefore art thou Petrus / that
is / thou belongest unto the rock. And upon this rock whereunto thou eleuest
now by thy confession / will I build my church. For where as the church of god
was norished first in hope of the redempcio^ for to come / and after that the
law came as a scoolmaster / stood much in outward ceremonies and
commandments of the law: now that the perfect time is come / I will build
my church upon my self / as on the strong rock that whosoever believes in me /
shall not perish / but have everlasting life. If he had said Super Petrum / it
might happlie have been understand of Peter: but seeing he says Super have
petram / we will search the scripture / whether this rock may signify any
thing else save only Christ himself.

It is written: behold / I lay in Sion a stombling stone / and a rock that
me^ shall be offended at. And whosoever believes on him / shall not be confounded:
which scripture Paul and Peter also declare in manner with the same words. And
in another place says Paul? they drank al of the spiritual rock that
followed them / which rock was Christ. And in the Acts of the Apostles: this
is the stone that was refused of you buylders / and is become the head cover
stone / / nether is there salvation in any other. Loo / here is a true and
sufficient interpretacion of this rock.

For as the Apostel Paul says: no man can lay another fundacion then that is
laid all ready / namely Christ Jesus. This much have I said touching the
fundacion of the church.

Now will we come to the keys.

And I (says the lord) will give the the keys of the kingdom of heaven. The
story now of the gospel declares / that this auctorite of the keys / was
not given only unto Peter / but unto all the Apostles alyke. And when he had
so spokon (says the Evangelist) brethed he upon them / and said* receive ye
the holy ghost. Whose sins ye forgive / to them are they forgeuen: and whose
sins ye reteyne / to them are they retained. These are other words / then
the lord spoke before unto Peter alone / and yet is it all one meaning. For
what this bynding else save only reteyning of sins?

And what eles is loosyng / save only remytting of sins? Wherefore not only
Peter / but al disciples also yea al such as have the holy ghost / have fre
autorite to use the keys.

Yet has our adversary one reeso^ / where by he thi^keth to prove that Christ
gave the superiorite unto Peter / na^lye because that in the end of. S. Ihons
gospel / the lord Jesus said unto him.

Simon Ioannes / love thou me more then these? Peter ansuered him: yea lord
thou know that I love the.

Jesus said unto him: feed my sheep / and that same spoke he three times. Out of
this will our adversary conclude / that the whole flock of Christ was
committed unto Peter to be fed: and because the lord said I have prayed for
the that thy faith fail not / he will that we shall thereby understand the
church of Rome. If he now will have that understand of the church of Rome / as
of Peter's habitacion to come / then out of Christ's commaundment which follows
immediately after / let him learn / that unto the church of Rome there was given
no preemynence more then to other churches / but that there is equalite. And
thou (says Christ) when thou art converted / strength thy brethren: he says
not / strength thy sheep / as the chief shepherde: nether thy childern / as the
most holy father) but strength thy brethren. And as often as there arose any
contencion among the disciples for the superiorite / Christ allwaye rebuked
them / and said / that they were brethren. Therefore says- S. Paul also: unto
every one of us is given grace acording unto the measure of the gift of
Christ. And immediately after it follows: and he himself made some Apostles /
some prophets / some Evangelists / some shepherdes and teachers / to the
edifie^g of the saints / to the work and ministracion. etc.

In this rehearsal of ministracions / where names he one of them to be head
among the Apostles? What is become of the name of the chief shepherde? It
follows also: let us follow the truth in love / and in all things grow in
him which is the head / even Christ. Here se we that all saints are members of
one body / whose head is Christ himself. Nether is here mention made of any
other head. And in another place says Paul: they which samed to be some what
and great / added nothing unto me. But contrariwise when they saw / that the
gospel over the vncircuncision was committed unto Peter (for he that was
mighty in Peter in the Apostelshippe one the circuncision / the same was
mighty in me among the heithen) when the grace that was given unto me / then
James / Cephas and Ihon / which sewed to be pylours / gave unto me and Bernabas
the right hands of that feloshippe? that we should be Apostles among the
heithe^ / and they in the circuncisoo^.

What can be found more plain? S. Paul says / that he had commission of the
Apostelshippe among the heithe^ / as Peter had among the circumcision. Thus
after our adversaries doctrine / we must have two heads / ard two chief
shepherdes: the one among the Jews / the other omong the heithe^. And why do
not the Romans boast the^ selves of. S. Paul / whom every man reputeth an
Apostel of the heithe^ / of who^ they come? But let them hear the rest of the
text / where it says that James Cephas and Ihon seemed to be pylours. Why
calls he Cephas or Peter a pyloure like the other? Wherefore does not he call
him the foundacio^ of the church? Why names he him not the chief among the
Apostles? They gave me (says he) and Barnaba the right hand of that
feloshippe. Here he affirms / that they were received of them as co^panyons.
All which things declare no superiorite / but a brotherly equalite among the
Apostles.

But let us grant / that Peter was the chief among the Apostles / the
chefeshepherde of the lords flock / and the true vycare of Christ upon earth
(though we need none such / for as much as Christ has promised us to be with us
unto the end of the world / nether is his kingdom of this world) but put the
case that it so is / why will the bisshoppes of Rome yet use any such title?
What excellent thing soever was in Peter / that same received he at the grace
of god through his faith and love. The same grace lacked not Paul and the other
Apostles: for though Peter's shadow did heal many / yet helped Paul's napkyn not
a fen through like working of the lord / which confirmed his word with such
tokens. But what is that to the bisshopes of Rome? Does the same prove / that
Peter and Paul preached at Rome: As for Peter it is not very certain that ever
he came there. But let us grant that he was at Rome / and bisshope there also.
Shall therefore all the bisshoppes of Rome coming aster / inheret likewise the
grace that Peter had? O how blessed an estate has the bisshope of Rome / if
even the same grace of god that was in Peter / be adjoined to his office? If he
might inheret the faith and love of Peter / doutles he should also opteyne like
grace. But every man knows / that these things were gistes of grace in Peter
and in the other Apostles / consideringe that virtues or vices come not to
inheritance: But every soul that synneth / the same shall dye: virtue also
does seldom take place in the successors.

Why do the Romish than boast the^ selves so sore? Do they it only because
that Prter was at Rome? That were even as if a shoemaker dwelling in a house
(wherein a great learned man dwelt sometime) wolt boast himself to have opteyned
some sciences of his predecessoure by reason of that dwelling place. Yea it
were even as if a poor fellow entering in to an office / wherein had been a rich
man before (to whom great dettes were owinge / not concerning the office) wol
require of dewtie the same his predecessors dettes / because he succedeth him
in the office Eue^ like arguments in a manner does our adversary use / whereby
he goes about to make the bisshope of Rome like unto Peter in auctorite.
Peter / says he was ordened chief shepherde of Christ's flock: to him were
committed the keys of the kingdom of heaven: And the same Peter was sometime
bisshope of Rome / therefore all bisshopes of Rome / are the chief shepherdes
and have the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Though this be but a small
argument / yet has god permitted that through the craffte of the deuel / it is
so suncke in to many men's minds / that who so ever undertakes but with a
word to do ought there against / must stand in danger of his life. Now is it
manifest that for the mayntenaunce of his opynion / he (namely our adversary
has nothing / except we grant him / that Peter was bishope of Rome. If that
now alone be sufficient for the establishing of such exceadinge great
auctorite / I refer it to the discretion of you that be Judges. Now will we
speak of the mass.

This name Mass / was doutlesse in the Apostles time nether used ner heardof.
Nether can there any certain occasion be showed whence this name should come.
But certain it is / that all the preparacion about it / was institute and
ordened to the intent / that the supper and death of the lord might be had in
remembrance: which may easily be perceived by the vestimentes and other
things perteyning to the mass. Now in the prymityue church was not the supper
of the lord kept before none / as now the use is / but in the euenyng after
supper as Christ himsefe kept it. Nevertheless through the misbehaueouae of
certain filthy persons / which with their dronkennes dishonored this holy
supper / arose great slander and offense / which. S. Paul to the Corinthians
does ernestly rebuke. And therefore thought the holy fathers it should not be
against the ordinance of the lord. If men kept this holy supper afo^^ ^oone
/ fasting: whereby such inordi^^^e people might somewhat be withdrawe^ from their
inconvenience. Which the co^sidred / they might well do / for as much as they
altered nothing of the principal matter.

And at the first / was no more added thereunto / save only the Pater noster /
the prayer of the lord. But afterward in process of time by addyng more and
more it grew tho the point that it is now at. And besides that with such
additions they thought to garnishe the supper of the lord (peradventure of a
good intent) they have almost utterly lost the principal points of the
remembrance of the supper. So that now the right name of it is altered / and no
more called the lords supper / but is called Mess / which name is both
strange and unknown in the scripture: yea and that worse is / it is named a
sacrifice / that may be done for other folks. Whereof then spronge the
slanderous market of byeng and sellyng of masses in churches: here of was
renewed the dangerous ydolatrie / that we ran unto the mass as to a
special worck / thinkyng there to fetch all salvation / which we should have
looked for only at Christ's hand.

But let us look / wherefore they call it a sacrifice. Even because (say they)
that in the mass / Christ the son is offered up unto god his father. O what a
great blasphemy is this / yea to be abhorred of al virtuous men. Who would
think it possible / that men mortal and sinful / could ever have been so in
a lapert or rather mad / as to presume with their unclean hands / to offer
Christ the lord unto his father yet ones again? Christ (says. S. Paul) is
entered in to the very heaven / for to appear now in the sight of god for us:
not to offer himself offten / as the hye pressed enters in to the holy place
every year with strange blood: for then must he have offt suffered sens the
world began. And afterward it follows: thus was Christ offered up ones for
all to take away the sins of many: but they will say: Christ is not so
sacrificed in the mass / that he dies again upon the cross / but it is for
the remembrance of the same sacrifice that ones was made. Whi do they than
call it a sacrifice / seeing it is but a remembrance of a sacrifice? And why
say they that it may be done for other seeing that of it self it is no such
work / but only a remembrance of the supper and passion of our lordt Jesus
Christ? Which says: take and eat / this is my body. And of the cup he
says: drink ye all therout. And as afft as ye this do / then do it to the
remembrance of me. He says not offer my body and my blood. Wherefore let the
rihht and true remembrance of the lords Supper remain in the congregacions /
and let us show the lords death until he come.

Now if we be disposed to offer / let us offer our own bodies / a quycke /
holy and acceptable sacrifice unto god / which is even the reasonable way to
serve him. We read in the scripture / that no vice was ponished so sore / as
the abuse of gods service. Wherefore me thinks all virtuous me^ should heartily
pray / that the abuse of the mass were put down in the churches. For if we
wilfully sin after the knowledge of the truth / there remains no more
sacrifice for sins. etc.? But I willet the mass go / and treat of both the
kinds in the lords holy Supper / which should also be given unto the lay
people.

It is past all doubt by every man / that Christ in the holy Supper gave his
disciples both the kinds. Therefore it is manifest / that their opynion is not
evil / which would have the chalice distributed unto every man. And me
thinks the other do err sore / that hold the contrary / and specially
because they put such difference between prestes and lay people / not
considering the prestly office that is committed unto all faithful beleuers.
For in the law of Moses / the office of prestes was to offer and pray for the
pople. But now for as much as Christ being ones offered up for us / has abrogate
all other sacrices / and not only permitted but also commanded all men to
pray: I can not sewhat difference can be between prestes and lay people /
except the governance of the church and minystracion of gods word. For. S.
Peter in his Epistel says: and ye also as living stones / are made a
spiritual house / an holy presthode / to offer up spiritual sacrifices /
acceptable to god through Jesus Christ. And even there also says. S. Peter:
but ye are the chosen generation / the royal presthode / the holy nation. etc.
Here writes. S. Peter not only unto bishops and prestes / but to the
strangers that were dispersed and scatred abroad in Ponto / Galatia etc. And
calls them altogether an holy and royal presthode.

S. Paul also writing of this holy supper of the lord to the commen
congregacions at Corinthum / makes mention not only of the bred / but also of
the cupen. If the cup then at that time / was commen unto all Christen men /
why is it now withdrawn from the lay people?

The holy fathers (says our adversary have with good conscience brought the
supper to this ordenyng that it now is in: and that mihht they well do / as we
read that in the Apostles time certain things were ordyned / where of no
mencio^ is in the gospel. Among which this is one in the Acts of the Apostles
/ where they commanded to absteyne from things offered unto Idolles / and from
blood and from strangled: which commandment the Apostles esteemed necessary.
Whereunto I answer brefely / that the Apostles gave no such commandment for
that intent that it should allwaye so co^tynue / seeing they them selves
afterward kept it not. Nevertheless they having respect unto the time /
thought to avoyde the offendyng of the weak. But when the gospel was more
clearlye come to light / they ceased from such commaundmentes as things not
necessary the verite being known. Eue^ out of this occasion did Paul
circumcyse Timothy / where as nevertheless afterward when the Jews would needs
have had him to circumcyse Titus also / he would not give place unto them one
hour. Even so me thenketh should it he now likewise: For though the cup of
the lord be witholden from the lay people for certain causes which be but
trifles / yet now for as much as it is euydent (to all such as will know it)
that the memorial of Christ's holy supper was institute by himself under both
the fourmes of bred and wine / let us forsake our own foolish intentes / and
turn again to the infallyble ordinance of Christ? yea let us aknowlege /
that Christ / who is wyser then all angels or men / did not fornaught or
without cause ordeyne this remembrance under both fourmes of bred and wine:
and that if there were any danger for the lay people to have the use of the
chalyce (as our adversaries make a bablyng there of) he could have known it
before well enough: howbeit in the outward use of the sacrament without faith /
consists but small salvation / as it well has apeared in the traitor Judas.
For as soon as he had received this sacrament with the other disciples at the
hand of Christ immediately went he forth / xecuted his treason / dispayred /
and hanged him self. For if the outward use of the bred and wine were
necessary to salvation / it should not go well with the^ that may not away
with wine. Therefore the right and wholesome remembrance of the supper of the
lord / is it that is done in faith: namely / wha^ we believe that the body of
Christ was given for us and that his blood was shed for us But for as much as
Christ would have the same remembrance kept with outward vsyng of bred an
wine / therefore must so great a sacrament in nowise belest vnmynistred / but
still observed / acording as Christ himself has ordyned it / wothout all men's
inuencions. But now will we speak of Purgatory.

The opynion of Purgatory / I suppose / is taken out of the books and wrytinges
of the Heythen / for as much as in the holy scripture of the old and new
Testament we have no manner of record for the confirmacion of any such thing.
Christ and his Apostles have taught much and evidently of the eternal
salvation of the faithful / and damnacion of the unfaithful: but nothing of
purgatory. Wherefore I think it not needful to invoke sore against it /
considering it is a thing that has no ground / and must needs fayl of it
self. Our adversary nevertheless had certain arguments / but so feeble / and
so wide from the purpose / that I am allmoss ashamed to repete them. We rerde
in the book of the Machabeus sent to Jerusalem twelve thousand pieces of silver
/ to offer for the sins of the deed / because he had a good and devout mind
concerning the resurrection. Now I pray the what does that to purgatory? Who
says / that it is not a good and devout thing to remember the resurrection?
And where as the Author of the book adds these words: therefore is it an holy
and wholso-some cogitacion to pray for the deed / that they might be delivered
from sins: the same words do not I so esteem / that they ought to be taken
for a certain / for as much as the author of the same book is unknown / and
the book it self not approuide with any testimony of holy scripture.

Furthermore / in the gospel / where as Christ counseyleth us to agree with
our adversary while we are in the way with him / before we come to the judge /
left the judge deliver us to the officer / and the officer cast us in preso^ /
whence thou shall not come forth (says Christ) till thou have prayed the
vttemost farthing. With these words will Christ declare / that a gentle
agreement is profitable / though it be done with some loss. For if we will not
agree with our adversary by the way / but fear a little loss / it is to be
feared / that the judge will cast us in person / and put us to sharper payment
yea and more intolerable / then perauenture the other was / wherewith our
adversary would have been satisfied. But the person does our adversary call
here purgatory / and that which is spoken concerning the busynesses of this
world does he take upon him to wrest unto the world to come / as though a man
might feyne out of the words of Christ what he list.

In like mane ralledgeth he the testimonye of. S. Paul. i. Corintr. iij. Where
he says / that the fire shall prove every man's work what it is. And if any
man's work burn / he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved /
nevertheless as through the fire. Here expounds he fire to be purgatory / where
as. S. Paul by a symilitude does say / that our works shall be tried like as
gold / silver / and other metal is tried in the fire.

But who can suffer such iuglyng? Let him show us the leest lettre in the
scripture / that playnlie proves purgatory. If we must pourge our sins
through purgatory / I pray the then for what intent dyed Christ? Wherefore shed
he is blood? If god be with us / who will be against us? Who spared not his
own only son / but gave him for us all / and how should he not give us all
things with him: Who will accuse the elect of god? It is god that makes them
righteous / who will condemn them: Now sewe that the faithful are made
aighteous / and shall not be condemned. And who is so ungodly as to think /
that the righteous god does after this world punish one uncondemned.

Let this little / but true / be sufficent / to overthrow the vain inuencion of
purgatory. And what need was it / with this weak fear of pain / to witdrawe
simple people from the holloue of Christ / who nevertheless in this world has
promised trouble even unto his faithful / to make them feel some what of the
punishment of mouch sin: but after death an whole / frey parfite joy and
salvation / which we undoubtedly look for in the blessed hope have thrust us
down / and therefore feyned they this horrible bogg of purgatory: to the intent
that we dispayring in the assured and infinite mercy of god which comes
through Jesus Christ / might run to their churches (yea to their chistes) to
be fre from our sins with unreasonable money / whose iudginent tarieth not
behind. Let noman therefore be moved by those disceatfull spretes / which (as
they say) do apeare unto men and desire their help / prayeng / that masses /
pilgremages and other like supersticious ceremonies ma^ye be done for them /
for even the same night bogges / like as they in old time were among the
heithe^ / so are they now also among the turks. Nether is it wonder if the
deuel ca^ disguyse him in the form of a dead man / seeing he can transfigure
himself in to an aungel of light. But to the intent that the unprofitable
purgatory do us no harm in our heads / we will go forth farther.

The inuocacion of saints has even such a foundation as purgatory has /
namely none at all. But a wonderful thing is it to express / how the
ymaginacions of me^ have ever been enclyned to ydolatrie: and therefore is it
not for naught that the first precepte among ten / was so well beaten in to the
Jews / that they should honor but one god / and have no strange gods. Now
to have a strange god / what is it else / save to put hope and trust in a
creature / and not in god the maker only? Christ says: come to me all ye
that labor and are ouercharged / and I will refreshe you. And what soever ye
ask the father in my name / he will give it you. Is that true? I suppose no man
will deny it. If it be true the^ / why do not we believe it? Wherefore call we
not upon god the father / through his only be gotten sone Jesus Christ / seeing
we are sure that he denies us no petycio^. But we will se the arguments of
our aduersarye / wherbye he goes oboute to prove the invocation of saynctes.
We believe (says he) the promise of Christ: but because we trust not to our
own strength / therefore seek we advocates to pray unto god for us: like as it
is in great princes courts / where matters are dispatched by the counselours
who^ the prince loves. O what a gross likeness is that? has a prince
mortal any thing in this point that may be rese^bled unto god? Two special
causes there be / wherefore one must have to do with lords vpo^n earth through
mediators and advocates / namely ignorance of the lords / and mutabilite of
their minds. For they ca^ not know what one desires / except some body tell
the^. It is also uncertain / whether they will grant that one desires of
them or no. But so is it not with god. Christ says your father knows where
of ye have need / before ye pray unto him. And what so ever ye pray unto the
father in my name / he will give it you. Here is it euyde^t / that nether
ignorance ner chaunheablenesse of mind has place with god. This symilitude
also concerning the great princes of the world / is false / like as it is false
that they say they believe the promise of Christ. For if they constauntly
believed that they should be heard through Christ / they would seek no help of
other. But seeing they confess that they trust not their own error / in that
they understood not / that this promise was made not through our deseruyng / but
through the deseruyng of Christ. And where they will keep them selves from being
to bold of god / they fall to their own hurt in to the head sin of
desperacio^ or infidelite. And if they continue therein / they need not look to
opteyne any thing of god / as. S. James testifies / who exhorts us to pray
in faith / and not to dowte. For who so dowteth (says he) is like unto the
wawes of the sea / that are tossed and blown of the wynd. Let not such a man
think / that he shall receive any thing of the lord.

In matters of the world / it is not accounted no god wit for a man to leave a
thing certain for a thing uncertain / and as the dog did in Esopes fables /
to let the flesh fall / and to follow the shadow there of. And how much more
indiscreet a thing may it be esteemed / when in such a great matter concerning
everlasting salvation / one forsakes it that without contradiction is true /
and follows another thing / where it may be dowted whether it be true or no.
That we are heard through Christ / we be certain / while we are so taught of
the verite it self. But how ca^ we be sure that our prayer is heard for any
saints sake / seeing that of the inuocacion of saynctes there is no mention
made in the scripture / but the contrary is euydentlie declared in many places.
Christ answers the deuell after this manner: thou shall worship the lord
thy god / and him only shall thou honor. And what need we many probacions?
Let him show us one place in the scripture / where one saint called upon
another. If the inuocacion of saints were profitable / why did not Moses call
upon Abraham Isaac and Jacob / seeing he heard god him self say. I am the god
of Abraham / Isaac and of Jacob? Why did not David and the other prophets call
upon Moses / as the chief prophet of god? And where / fore did not the Jews
that came after call upon David / who had such good record of god himself /
that he said / I have found a man after mine own heart / which shall
accomplish all my will.

And after the coming of Christ why did not the Apostles call upon Ihon the
baptist / concerning whom they had heard these words of our Savior: among
such as are borne of women arose none greater then Ihon the baptist.

It is not lickelye ye dear Judges / that these holy men of whom I now have
made mention / were so negligent / or so unkind of stomach toward us / that if
they had known and been persuaded that the inuocacion of saints were for our
salvation or acceptable to god / they would not let us know thereof. Therefore
do I esteem it a dangerous thing / without scripture yea against the open
scripture / to set up the invocation of saints / as a service acceptable to
god. Nether can I allow the objection of those / that go about to me^teyne
such opynions by old and long custom / or by miracles. For as touching
custom / if all were to be commended that has been long and of old time used
/ then the blasphemous use of the heithen with their ydols must be set up
again / which with one consent of so many nations endured many years before
the coming of Christ.

Thus might advowtrie al so and other vices be manteyned / seeing they be
committed so often and in so many places. But what is less commendable / than to
go about through an evil custom to set up / a thing that is openly against
the law of god / yea men in their laws will suffer no such evil customs we
to take upon us to be judges over gods word

Concerning miracles which god so greatly works in his saints / who would
not higlye wonder at such / as at a syngular gift of god? Not withstonding it
is manifest also / that to do miracles add wonders / is not allwaye a sure
probacion of holiness / seeing we read not ever that Abraham / Isaac / Jacob /
David and Ihon the baptist did miracles. Must they therefore not be holy / and
should we therefore despise them? Or why call we not Judas the traitor / as a
saint / that did miracles with the Apostles and healed many people / as we may
perceive out of the history of the gospel? But let us hear the sentence of
Christ: many (says he) shall say unto me in that day: lord / lord / have
not we profecied in thy name? Have not we cast out deuels in thy name? Have we
not done great virtues in thy name? Then will I confess unto them / I never
knew you. Depart from all ye euel doers. What can our aduersarys boast now
of saints miracles / seeing we read that ungodly and damned persons have done
many great acts in the name of Christ? And. S. Paul also prophecieth to the
Thessalonians / saying that the wiked shall come / namely the child of
perdicion / whose coming is after the workyng of the deuell / with all manner
lyeng powers / tokens and wonders. Wherefore let us not believe every sprete /
but prove them whether they be of god / or no. And let us not be so unadvised
as to ascrybe unto saints and to their merits / the honor that only
apperteyneth unto god.

When Peter and Ihon at the gate of the temple / had made the lame man whole /
and the people ran to them wonderyng / Peter said unto them: ye men of Israel
/ why wonder ye at this thing / or why look ye so upon us / as though we through
our power or virtue had made this man go. And afterward it follows: throw the
faith in his name (namely Christ's) has he upon this man whom ye se and know /
confirmed his name. And faith through him has given this man healt before your
eyes. Where are now the miracles which they say are done through the merits of
saints? Peter and Ihon pilorus of the church confess playnlie / that this
lame man was not made whole through their power or virtue / but in the faith
through Christ. O eternal god / in what an horrible deep pit of Idolatry are
we fallen? How far have we erred from the true faith of Christ? We shall not
lightly find any time where in the heithe^ have honored their gods with so
great supersticiousnesse / as some Christian honor their saints. Every
occupacion has his advowrie / every land their own defendoure / and every
sickness a peculiar phisician. There be some saints also whom they do not
honor to have profit by them but because they should do them no harm. To
certain peculiar saints commit they their matters of war / their
marchau^dise / and their causes of marriage. The husband men also have their
own helpers: one increaceth the sede / another keeps the vynyardes / the
sheep / the kyne / the geyse: yea the filthye swyne have likewise their own
propre herd. To him offer the foolish people allmaner of things / but for
the most part wax so that here in they are almost become like unto the
Egiptians / who worshipped such bestes themselves for their gods.

These saints now are all honored / they are all called upon: only merciful
Christ is not regarded. And though they sometime name him with bare words / yet
is all their trust in the saints. Nether are they satisfied in such strange
honoring of saints / but make also a wonderful difference of holy places.
Here of comes it that they think Mary the mother of Christ to be more
gracious in one place / the^ in another. Now pilgremages also mynishe so^ that
the reputacio^ of the old. They ru^ne to Compostell in Spain to visit. S.
James: to Iho^ in douchland to salute our lady / and in many othrr places to
saints graves (as the kytes fly to the cario^) and honor many deed bodies
upon earth whose souls are in hell. I pass over the foolish supersticion that
they use with deed saynctes raiment / as cotes hosen shues / and regard little
the poor saints / that live with us as brethren in Christ upon earth / and
have great need of such apparel. Yet would I esteem it a less error / if
they worshipped not also the images that have no understanding and are made
with men's hands / of gold / silver / stone and wodde: yea very little it
fails that they worship not with all / eue^ the worms the worms that gnaw
the bodies of such blessed saynctes of wodd. To such images ascrybe they
wo^dere and miracles. Of some one they say / that it had spoken. Of another
they say / that by his own virtue he is gone from one place to another. They
day should be to long for me / if I would say all that might be spoken of
this unreasonable matter. Su^ma they leave nothing be hynde that belongs to
full ydolatry

We may well say / that the Indianes had much more right to worshipe the.
Son / such a dear / profitable / wonderful and excellent creature / then
these mad folks have to worship such a rotten worm ate^ ydoll. Now though
we disalowe such ydoatrie / such perverse honoring and wrong and inuocacion of
saints / let no man think / that we therefore will withdraw from the^ any
thing of their true worshipe and reputacio^. Saints have nothing that they
have not received Paul says: what is Paul? What is Apollo? Even ministres
they are / by who^ ye are to the believe / and that according as the lord has
given unto every man. And afterward it follows: therefore let no man rejoice in
me^ / for all is yours / whether it be Paul or Apollo or Cephas or the world:
whether it be life or death / whether it be things present or for to come: all
is yours but ye are Christ's / and Christ is gods. Wherefore all grace which
comes through Chriin the holy ghost / ascrybe we unto god as unto him that
only gives it. And heartily we beseke him that unto us poor sinners also he
will grau^ this infynite mercy / to the intent that we may forsake our
sins / and be holy before him through Jesus Christ his only begotten sone /
who upon the cross has delivered us not with a small price / but with his
own blood. Reason it is / that saints have their due honor / but faith and
inuocacion belonget only unto god. Let us go therefore with confidence unto the
seat of grace / that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in the
time of need. For we have not an hye pressed which can not have compassidn on
our infirmities / but was in all points tempted as we are but without sin /
being ever able also to save them that come unto god through him / and lives
ever to make intercession for us. Nether is there under heaven given unto men
any other name / wherein we must be saved. For there is but one god / and one
mediatoure be twene god and man / namely the man Jesus Christ / which gave
himself a redemption for all. To him be honor and praise for ever.

My purpose was (Right dear Judges) to have defended this Christen man cause
with few words. Nevertheless the sotyl co^playnt of our adversary has hyndred
me (as ye se) fro making of mine answer. Wherefore the fault of so lang
communicacion ought reasonably to be imputed not unto us / but to the
unrighteous accuser.

And now will I take in hand the sexte article / namely auricular confession:
which I suppose was first ordyned for this purpose / that the simple unlearned
people should go to the prestes to seek counsel / if they had any grievous
thing in their mind either cocernyng any dowte in the believe / or concerning
sin which vexes a man's conscience: To the intent that the prestes as they
that be learned and have experience in the scripture / might strenght such as be
weak in faith / warn the unruly and misnurtoured / comfort such as be sorry
and penitent for their sins: summa / as true phisicians to give due medycines
for every sickness. Which ordinance if it were right kept / and as I now
have said / I suppose no man could reprove it. But now forasmuch as they
command / that every person shall ones in the yare confess all his sins to
his own pressed not only such as he has committed in deed / but also what
soever is come in to his thought / yea and to declare the state / place / time
and circumstaunce of the persons / considering likewise that they proclaim the
same out as a commaundment of god under pain of eternal dammacion / I may
say that it is no wholesome confession of sins / but rather a shamelfull
tormenting of men's consciences. Nether can I believe either / but that it was
brought in by the special craft and sotiltie of the deuel / to tangle poor
men with a new snare / and vttarlye to bring them from the wholesome and
necessary confession of sins. It is written in the psalm: I said / I will
even against my self / confess mine offense unto the lord / and thou for
gave me the ungodliness of my sin. For the same shall all saynctes pray
unto the in due season. Without such confession of sin shall noman be saved.
For they that desire to be partakers of the grace of Christ / must before al
things know and confess / that they are sinners and worthy of eternal
punishment. Such a confession if it come from the heart / is wholesome and
fruitful. Afterward verily follows a broken heart / which god will not despise.

Our adversary would prove out of the gospel / that this confession to the
pressed / is commanded of Christ / because that when he cleansed the lepars / he
bad them go show them selves to the prestes. Here does our adversary make a
cold interpretacion. Show your selves / says he / is as much to say / as
confess your sins. But the words that follow after in the gospel / will
not suffer such a slender exposicio^. And offer the gift (says Christ) that
Moses commanded / for a witness unto them. This was the very cause why they
were commanded to go unto the prestes: namely / that of the^ / as of those to
who^ the knowledge of leprosy was committed / they might be judged clean: to
the intent it might be known / that Christ had truly cleansed the^. There frre
for a witness against such as resisted him / bad he the lepers offer the gift
that Moses had commanded in the law.

Out of. S. James epistle takes our adversary these words: knowledge your
sins one to another / and pray one for another / that ye may be saved. Here
does he as he did before / and will have this word one to anoher / to be as much
to say as to a pressed.

Nevertheless the words be so plain / that they need no long interpretacion.
For. S. James wills / that every one shall knowledge himself as a sinner toward
his neggboure / and so one to pray for another / that they may fulfill
brotherley love and be saved. I abhor (most prudent Judges) to express /
what great harm the strait confession has brought to pass among the simple
people. For seeing they think that they can not be saved / exerpte they
confess every thing as narowly as the sameshrist tradicion byndeth / and yet
leave it undone sometime for shame / and sometime through forgetfulness / no
doubt they fall in to despair / and are ever (yea aslong as they live) far
from holy hope. It is manifest also how unreasonably certain prestes behave
themselves in hearing of confessions / to the great destruction of souls.
Some / for all yght occasion / will not absolve a penitent / no though he be
very sorry for his sins. Some ask questions of young people concerning wanton
and filthy mattters / nothing regarding their innocent minds. And where as
they should ernestly desire to help with some wholsowe medycine / they make
deedly wounds in weak consciences.

But what shall I say? Have they not often and wilfully through their constrained
confession / abused the chaist symplicite of honest weme^ and virgyns / to
their own vnchastite and wantonness? Some of them openly told abroad / the
thing that has been committed to their fidelite in confession: and thereby have
they brought much malice to pass / yea and sometime murthur also. Such are the
sweet fruits of this feigned confession: yea and that as evil is / they preach
the same to be a work / for whose sake god forgeueth sins and thereby have
they robbed Christ of his honor / like blasphemous men as they be. Wherefore
considering this tree was not planted by the father of heaven / but by the
children of the deuel / to search out craftily the priuyties of men's hertes /
me thinks it should be pluckte up by the roots / and men brought again to
the right and wholesome confession of their sins.

The rest is / that I make answer touching the difference of meats / and
concerning the marriage of prestes: Which two points I purpose not to sonder /
far as much as Paul joins the^ together in his first epistle to Timothy /
where these be his words: the sprete speaheth evidently / that in the later
times some shall depart from the faith / and shall give head unto spretes of
error and deuelishe doctrynes of them which speak false through ypocrisie and
have their conscience marked with an hot iron / forbydding to mary / and
commanding to obsteyne from the meats which god has created to be received
with thankesgeuyng of the^ which believe and know the truth. For every creature
of god is good / and nothing to be refused / that is received with geuynge of
thanks: for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer (I suppose dear
judges) that as touching these matters / Paul has with these words
sufficienthly answered for us / seeing he says evidently / that they which
forbid to mary / and command to absteyne fro meats / are departed from the
faith and follow the deuels doctrine.

Paul also him self wrythet thus to the Corinthians: what so ever is sold in
the flesh market / that eat / and ask no question for conscience sake. For
the earth is the lords / and all that is therein. And to the Colossians he
writes: let no man therefore trouble your consciences about meat or drink /
or for a piece of an holy day / or new Moon / or of the Saboath days / which
are the shadow of things that were for to come / but the body it self is in
Christ.

And afterward it follows: if ye be deed then with Christ from the ordinances
of the world why are ye holde^ with such tradicions / as thoug ye lived after
the world? As when they say / Touch not this / taist not that / handle not
that: All which thisges do hurt unto men because of their obuse / which
comes only of the commaundmentes and doctrynes of men. etc. All this does
Christ confirm / when he says: what soever enters in at the mouth /
defyleth not the man. And what can be more clearly spoken? But so false and
unrighteous is the judgment of such unreasonable me^ / that if a Christen man
do taist but a little flesh upon a day prohibited by the^ / Immediately without
any farther advisement / they proclaim him to be an heretic / and cast in his
tethe such a tradicion of fasting / as though a man's salvation depended upon
the difference of meats: and yet the ypocrites them selves / though they eat
no flesh / are nevertheless so full of flesllye desires / that they can
understand nothing but fleshlye / and sometime are not ashamed to utter their
fleshely lusts with excess.

Even as great wrong do they through their damnynge of prestes marriage. But to
the intent that men should judge them to be excellent manteyners of chastity /
they praise virginite out of measure / which in very deed is a singu gift of
god / but keuen unto few. Nevertheless that they go about to ma^teyne / not
virginite / but a state to live unmarried / it appears playnlie by this / that
when a pressed takes a wife / they will not only have him deposed from his
mynistracion / but judge him worthy to be put to death also. But if he against
all honesty / take an harlot / or keep another man's wife / he is suffered / as
a profitable membre of the church (of Rome I mean). O what an horrible
wickendesse is this? Yet was there never a people so wild or unnatural / but
they had an ordinance concerning marriage / and keeping of co^cubynes. Only
Romish prestes may in this matter do as they lust themselves.

They take harlottes at their pleasure / when they will / and where / and ask
no question for conscience sake / so that they pay the bishope the whore toll.

And even with like audacyte put they them away from the^ again / and shame
never a whitt. Yet are they not satisfied with such unmeasurable liberty / but
haunt other men's wifes / and defloure virgynite. No thing ca^ be safe from
them: with their filthy wantonness defyle they every thing / the angelical
defenders of chastity: all which is so manifest / that it can not be hydd.

But lest I be reputed more to be an accuser of Romish prestes / then a
defender of this Christen man / I will pass over many things that might be
spoken concerning this matter / and content me with the judgment of Pa^ul / who
says: if they ca^ not absteyne / let them mary / for it is better eo mary
the^ to burn. Wherefore let this judgment remain / let troubled consciences be
helped / and the mynistres of the church restored again to an honest
conversation: lest if we continue in this sin / we fall in to that horrible
judgment / wherewith god will judge fornicatours and aduoutres.

Now / thou unreasonable accuser / have thou a sufficient answer to all the
points of thy complaynte? and I would hope that thy madness should therbye be
mitigate / if I feared not that the light of thy body were darkened for very
malice. Now if the light that is in the be darkness / how grerte will the
darkness it self be / even thou thy self / I say know well / that all
that I have said / is true. And why resisted thou than the open truth. Thou
unhappy man / art thou so far unadvised / that thou can not po^dre / how
weak a ground thou have in this ungodly matter / and again how mighty and
invyncyble an adversary thou have / namely Christ Jesus the only begotten
dear sone of god. Thy furye has now raged enough against this innocent
Christen man, Cease now at the last from perverting the right way of the
lord. Alas man / how often have thou in this thy enuyous complaynte / denied the
faith openly / in that thou have diverse times said / that only faith makes
not righteous before god? I pray the / art thou not ashamed of so detestable a
lie? Does not the scripture teach evidently / that fait only justifies in the
fight of god: Who ever denied this / if he were not mad / and such one as thou
art? Thou bostest of great works / where of thou thy self have not touched one
with thy little fyngre. And who knows not / that faith and charity can not be
separated. If charity then hang upon faith / and can not be idle / but allwaye
occupied / how should not the works of charity and love follow afterward of
them selves? Yea the same works are now not ours (lest any man boast
himself) but Christ's / who works in us through faith / as in his own
members.

Thou take to record the Epistle of. S. James / whose words are these:
faith without works is deed. Here thou reioycest as though thou had gotten
the vittory / and tryumphest as though thou werest over the hedge all ready. S.
James says / that faith without works is no faith / for faith love or
charity ca^ not be sondred. Think thou that one can love another / to whom
he gives no credence Or that one ca^ put all his hope and trust in him whom he
loves not S. Paul says: if I had all faith / so that I could remove hills
/ and had not love / I were nothing. The same puts he for a thing
impossible / and declares therbye / that faith can not be without love or
charity. Therefore will we discern these three things (faith hope and charity)
one from another / but so / that they remain vnseparated. Faith only
iutifieth before god: love or charity works toward her neighbor: hope does
pacie^tly wait for the promise of god / and shall not be confounded. Thou say
we lack good works / (not such as come of love / or that Christ shall require
of us at the day of judgment) but to go a pilgremage / to set up ca^dils
before images / to nombre up what we pray / to tell over a pair of beedes / to
put deffence in clothing / in meats / in prayers / in titels or names / where
one had rather be called a charter house monck or a barfote friar / then a
Christen man. These and such like sklender and childishe works requyrest thou
of us: which though one had done them altogether / it were even as much as
though he in the mean season had rydden upon a stick with boys in the street.

But declare thou us thy faith out of such works / as belong to a Christian man
/ and we will show the our works put of faith. Seist thou how this Christian
mam (whom thou accusest) stondeth here so weak and fleble through the stynck
and tedyousnesse of the preson / that he can scace stond upon his legs. And
why: I pray the. Has he committed any evil deed? No. For if he have done
ouhht that deserves death / or so the Judges have the law / they have the
sword / let the^ execute it / I will make no request against it. Wherefore is it
than? I will tell the. Even because he has freely preached the gospel of Christ
and the grace that is given us through him (for he believed / therefore has he
spoken) and has taught that what soever is against the gospel ought to be put
dawne / to the intent that the kingdom of god might come unto us / and that
his name might be santified: thus of a fervent love has he endeavored himself
to instruct all me^ and to bring them to the true knowledge of god / and of his
sone Jesus Christ Summa / his mind was so set to serve his negboure / that he
has not abhorred the darck dongeon and preson / to be desolate and alone / in
honger and thirst / yea and in danger of death.

Such are the works of a Christian man / which must not be ascrybed unto us /
but unto the lord that works them in us. Such true fasting is accepted of
the lord such true obedience belongs to his saints.

Now forasmuch as I have sufficiently declared that our adversaries complaynte
is clean against equity / there is no more to be required save only that ye /
Right dear Judges (whose mind is to do every man right) quyte this Christen
man acording to your beneuole^ce.

A short recapittulacio^ unto the Reader.
Here haste thou hard (most Ie^tle Reader) how beninge / how lovinge / how
myndfull owre most merciful father is / and ever hatthe ben / over his elect
and chosyn children / namely eue^ now. And for an ensample have we this poor
and simple creture set before owre iees / to call us to remembrance that he
is ny unto all them that / in time of tribulacio^ or persecucion will call / a
pon him in treweth and verite. Se we not here how mercifully. He stirechith
owte his hand / he spredith a broude his wings to hyde and cover this his
tender bird from the gleyde or bosarde. And in conclusion he mollifieth and
movith the heart of this verteouse prince and by him as by an enstrume^t of his
one / does he not only defend this poor man's cause / or rather the trewthyt
self: but also delyueryth him from the cruel hands of all his emnies / no
otherwise / the^ evin as it were from death to life soche is his godly nature
/ soche is his properte an a customed manner / that in the mydist of aduersytes
tribulacion and persecucion / where men thinck him most furthist of / there is
he most nyest and present / with soche co^solacion and comforth as can not
be expressid with / tongue. What more Joy ca^ne there come to them which be
afflicted persecuted and under the sweet cross of Jesus Christ / then to call
to there remembrance the confortable stories of the scripture acording to the
saying of sent Paul. What so ever thing is written / it is wrytton for owre
doctrine and lernyng / that throwgh patience and the consolacio^ of gods word
/ we may have sewre hope and trust.

Hou lycke a loving lord / saved he / Isaac / from the mortal and deadly
strock of the sword / with how petiful aneye lokyd he on Noe the precher of
righteousness / restoryng him from the rough ragyng wawes of the unmerciful
see / he deliuerid Loath at an enstant from the conversation and company of
they ungodly Sodomytes and Gomorrians / keppt he not Jonas save and sownde /
after he was devoured and swaloed up of that houge and monstruus fish: Sydrach
/ Misach / and Abdenago / preserved he from the flaming furnace of burning
fyrd Daniel be deliueryd from the devouryng mowthes / of the hongry lio^s.
Moises among the reeds and flages hid and hangyd by the water side in a
baskyd / whas restored again to his natural mother to be norsed of her. Paul
was left down in a baskyt / and so escaped the hands of his persecuters /
Susanna / whas preserved and defended pure and undefiled / from the lecherus
lusts of the false prestes and Judges / Judith / with much Joy and victory
whas delyueryd from the feyrce violence / and mighty power of all they emnies
of god. These / and many mo godly ensamples be lefftt in the holy scripture to
the great comforth and consolation of them that suffer persecucio^ for Christ's
sake / acording to the saying of Christ him self. Blessed are all they which
suffer persecucion for ryghteousnes sake: for their is the kingdom of heaven.
Again / as many as will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution /
it is the blessyng of god and the sweet rod of correction / where with all
the feathe of the feathfull must there with betryed. For evyn as owre lord and
god / does all ways and at all times preserve / keep / and defend his poor
persecuted and afflicte in all extremites: so does he cast down / and never
raise up again / all soche that so obstinatly and wilfully resistyth his
eternal testament and word / oppressyng his prechers / and persecutyng Christ
/ the only sone of god in his members. Seyeng now that soche trowble and
persecucion chansith all ways upon the simple and pore afflicte / specially
now / in these dangerus and perelus seyson: let not therefore the words of Paul
be owte of they remembrance of the^ that be at liberte / where he says
Remember them that are in bands / evyn as though ye were in bands which the^:
and be myndfull off them which are in aduersite: Let this short an bresse
lesson / be suffycient at this time to put the / (most Christen reader) in
remembrance of some paerte of thy dewty: and to render thanckes unto the lord
for the great strength and power he gave unto this Christian prince to confess
his lord and god / before all men him shall the lord confess again before
the father of heven / the lord send us many soche princes that will with so
ready a mind defend the lively word of god / deliver the innocent / confute
the false accuser / and to conclude to be pressed and ready to give his lyffe for
his pore brother. To the great discomforth of that hongry horse leche / and
blood thyrsti Romanyst the generation (of women) is never satisfied till yt
has blood. God defend all the^ that believe in his word from there cruelite
/ and ylluminate they hertes of all princes that they may onest spy and
perceive what kind of people they be that cause this great dissencion discord
and wars / now in this trowbelous time / and thou I put no dowte but that
kingdom of antichriste / which now hangyth by a twyne threde / shall shortly
take a fall / and the kingdom of Christ magnyfied among all nacyons to the
great honor and lawde of god: to the consolacion and confort of the wolle
Christen congregation of Jesus Christ / to whom be praise both now and ever.
AMEN.
