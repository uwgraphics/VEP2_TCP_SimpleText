A PROCLAMACION DEVISED BY the kings hygnes, with the advise of his counsel,
that his subjects be warned to avoid (in some c^^^s) the danger and penalty
of the statute of Provision and Praemunire.
FOr as much as the unlawful matrimony between the kings hyghnes and the
lady Katherine princes dowager, late wife to prince Arthure, by just ways and
means is laufully dissolved, and a divorce and separation had and done between
his said hyghnes and the said lady Katherine, by the most reverend father in
god the archbishop of Canturbury, legate and primate of al England, and
Metropolitan of the same: And thereupon the kings magestie has laufully
married and taken to his wife, after the laws of the church the right high and
excellent princes lady Anne now queen of England, and she solempnely crowned
and anointed, as appertains, to the laud, praise, and honor of almyghtie
god, the surety of the kings succession and posterite, and to the great Joy,
comfort, and contentation of all the subjects of this realm. All which
premises have groundely proceeded and taken their effects, as well by the
common assent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and the co^mens of this
realm, by auctorite of parlyament, as also by the assent and determinations of
the hole clergy in their several conuocations, holden and kept in both
provinces of this realm. And for perfayte and sure establysshement thereof, it
is enacted among other things that what so ever person or persons, of what
estate, degree or condition they be of do attempt or procure any manner process,
or do or move any act or acts to the let or derogation of any such
procedynges, sentences, and determynations, as is and have been done and had
as well in and about the said divorce, as in the solempnisation of the lauful
matrimony had and concluded between the kings highness and the said queen
Anne: shall incur and rounne in the peynes and penalties comprised in the
statute of provision and praemunire made in the.xvi. year of the late king
RICHARD the second, which is no less pain than the offenders to be out of
the kings protection, and their goods and lands to be forfayted, and their
bodies imprisoned at the kings will, as by the said act more at large is
expressed. By reason whereof and for as much as the said divorce and
separation is now had and done, and the kings highness lawfully married, as is
before rehearsed. IT IS therefore evident and manifest, that the said lady
Katherine should not from hens forth have or use the name, style, title, or
dignity of Queen of this realm, nor be in any wise reputed, taken, accepted,
or written by the name of Queen of this realm, but by the name, style, title,
and dignity of princes dowager, which name she ought to have because she was
laufully and perfectly married and accoupled with the said prince Arthure And
what so ever officers, ministers, bayliffes, receuours, fermours, serua^tis,
kepers of parkes or chaces of the said princes dowager, or any other person or
persons of what astate degree or condition they be of, contrary to the
premissis do name, repute, accept, and write or in any wise obey the said lady
Katheryn by virtue of any manner of warrant or writing to them directed by the
name of queen, or attempt do or move any other act or acts, thing or
things, to the le^te or derogation of such doings and procedynges, as is
determined and accomplysshed as well for the dissolution of the said unlawful
marriage as for the solempnisation and confirmation of the said laufull
matrimony justly finysshed and concluded, as is above rehearsed, shall and
does plainly and manifestly incur and run in the said great dangers and
peynes comprised and specified in the said act. In consideration whereof all
be it that the king our most dradde soueraygne lord nothing mystrusteth his
loving subjects for any attempt act or acts, or any thing to be done moved
or spoken by them contrary to the true meaning of the said act, and the due
execution and procedynges in the premises: yet nevertheless to thentent that
his said humble and loving subjects shall have plain, open, and manifest
notice of the greatte perils, dangers and penalities comprised and specifyed
in the said act, whereby they may eschew the dangers thereof: his majesty
therefore of his most gracious and benign goodness, more couaytynge and
desirynge the good obediences and conformities of his said subiectis, than to
be auaunced and enryched by their offenses or contemptes, by the advise of his
said counsel has caused this proclamation to be made for a plain ouerture
and publication of the premysses. Whereby as well all and every his loving
subjects / as others may (if they will) avoid and eschew the said great
peynes, dangers, and penalties above especified. Whereunto his gracis pleasure
and high commandment is, that every person from hens forth take good head
and respect / at their perils.

AND yet never the less the kings most gracious pleasure is, that the said
lady Katheryne shall be well used obeyed and intreted, according to her honor
and noble parentage, by the name title state and style of princes dowager, as
well by all her officers servants and ministers as also by others his humble and
loving subjects in all her lauful busynesses and affairs: So it extend not
in any wise contrary to this proclamation.

GOD SAVE THE KING.
