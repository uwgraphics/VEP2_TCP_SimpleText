By the King.
A Proclamation for the surveying and marking of Iron, and survey of Woods to
be used in the making thereof.
WHereas Our most noble Progenitors, and Predecessors, Kings and Queens of this
Realm, duly considering the necessary and important use of the Woods and
Timber of this Kingdom, have taken into their constant care to preserve the
same from wast and destruction; And to that end, diverse good and wholesome
Laws and Statutes have been made, and diverse other Provisions have been
published in that behalf: Nevertheless, by a common neglect of the said
Laws, and by an unlawful liberty, which many of Our Subjects have taken to
themselves, there has been, and yet continues, such a spoil of Timber and
Woods in this Our Kingdom, by converting the same into Coals for the making
of Iron, as that it may be feared that within few years, (unless by a speedy
course it be prevented) there will follow such want of Wood and Timber, as
cannot be supplied by any future providence; Which, together with the frequent
transportation of Iron and Iron metal, unlawfully without License in that
behalf, has already produced a great scarcity of Timber, Wood, and Iron,
being two of the principal Commodities and Materials for the strength of this
Our Kingdom: For remedy of which said mischiefs of so high a consequence,
tending to the public damage of Our Kingdom and People, and for restraint of
transportation of Iron, and the reformation of sundry secret deceipts and
abuses now used and practiced in the making of Iron, and in the vent and sale
thereof in Bars, by intermingling the worser sort with the better, and so
selling them promiscuously and deceiptfully together, whereby many times the
brittle and worser sort of Iron comes to be employed for shipping, and other
uses for which it is unserviceable; We by Our Letters Patents under Our great
Seal of England, bearing date the foureteenth day of October last, Did erect
an Office to be for ever continued, and did thereby appoint Our welbeloved
John Cupper, and Grimbald Pauncefoote gent. Surveyour or Surveyours of all
Iron-workes, Furnaces, and Forges within Our Realm of England and Dominion of
Wales, and of all Woods to be used or employed thereat, and for the surveying
and marking of Iron with diverse Stamps or Marks, distinguishing the several
kinds thereof, and for prevention of the transportation thereof without
License, and to prosecute Offenders in the premises: For the doing whereof, and
their labor, care, and charges to be taken and expended in the execution of
the said Office, for the public good of Our Kingdom and People, We by the
same Letters Patents have assigned unto them a moderate Fee, to be paid by the
Owners of the said Iron, at the time of the surveying and marking thereof.

And whereas since the granting of the said Office, upon Petition and
Allegations made against it, upon a full and deliberate hearing thereof before
Us and Our Privy Counsel, It appeared that the said Office, with the
Provisions in the said Letters Patents mentioned, was necessary and fit to be
put in execution; And for that also the reformation of the said abuses, in the
well ordering of the Mine and Oar, and the making of Iron, and the surveying,
marking, and distinguishing thereof, (besides the preservation of Woods and
Timber) will be of much benefit to the Commonwealth; We being minded to
establish the said Office and execution thereof, Do therefore hereby straightly
charge and Command, that no person or persons whatsoever, shall use, or employ
any Woods to be converted into Coal for the making of Iron, or shall
transport any Iron, or Iron-metall, contrary unto the Laws and Statutes of
this Our Realm, and other Provisions heretofore made and published; And that
no Iron-master, Maker of Iron, Owner, or Farmour of Iron-workes, Furnaces, or
Forges, their Clerks, Servants, or Agents whatsoever, shall from henceforth
sell, or put to sale, any sorts of Iron; nor any Merchant, Trader, or dealer in
Iron, nor any others, shall buy, or remove the same from the Iron-workes,
Furnaces, or Forges, where the same is or shall be made and wrought, before
the same Iron shall be first surveyed and marked by Our said Officer or
Officers, their Deputies or Assigns, with the Stamps or Marks appointed in
that behalf, according to Our will and pleasure in the said Letters Patents
declared, (so as the said Officers, their Deputy or Deputies, or Assigns, upon
payment of the said Fee or Fees, by the said Letters Patents allowed unto them
for their pains, to be had and made at the time of the surveying and marking
thereof, be ready once in every eight days at the said Iron-works, to survey
and mark the same Iron) Upon pain, not only of the forfeiture of the said
Iron, but also upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such punishment as may
be inflicted upon them for their contempts in that behalf.

And We do also appoint and authorize Our said Officer or Officers, their
Deputies or Assigns, as occasion shall require, to use some other Marks to be
cast or stamped upon the said several Sowes or Pigs and Bars of Iron,
whereby the several Iron works and Owners thereof, and the Counties where the
same was made and wrought, may be certainly known: All, or any of which said
Stamps or Marks, We require and Command, that no other person or persons do
presume to counterfeit or falsify, nor to stamp or mark any Iron therewith.

And We do straightly charge and Command all and singular Iron-Masters, Owners,
and Farmours of Iron-works, Furnaces, and Forges whatsoever, within Our Realm
of England and Dominion of Wales, now, and for the time being, and their and
every of their Clerks, Servants, and Agents, that they and every of them
respectively, do permit and suffer the said Officer or Officers, their Deputies
or Assigns, at meet and convenient times, to enter into all and every the said
Iron-works, Furnaces, and Forges, and all Warehouses, Storehouses, Edifices,
and Buildings thereunto belonging, there to survey, view, and mark, as well all
the Iron from time to time made and wrought, as to survey, view, and try the
Mine Oar and Metal, and the working thereof into Sowes, or Pigs, and Bars
of Iron, as aforesaid, and to peruse, see, and take Notes, of all and every the
Books and Scores, by them or any of them made and kept, of, and concerning such
quantities of Iron, as from time to time shall be by them made or sold: And
that the said Iron-Masters, Owners, and Farmours of Iron-works, Furnaces, and
Forges, and their Clerks, Agents, Servants, or Workmen, be from henceforth
aiding and assisting unto the said Officer or Officers, their Deputy or
Deputies, or Assigns, from time to time, in the due execution of the
premises, and of every matter and thing thereunto belonging, as they tender
Our Royal Will and Commandment herein declared, and will answer for their
contempt or neglect thereof, at their uttermost perils.

And We do hereby declare Our Royal pleasure to be, that the said Officer or
Officers, their Deputy, or Deputies, or Assigns, shall, or may, with the
assistance of some Constable, or other lawful and known Officer, enter into
any House, Cellar, Vault, Warehouse, Shop, Ship, or Vessel, or other place
whatsoever, as well within Liberties as without; And there to view, search, and
find out all such Iron, as has been, or shall be bought, sold, or removed
from the Works or places where the same was made and wrought, before the same
be first surveyed, viewed, and marked, as aforesaid: And what Iron, or
Iron-Metall shall be shipped, or attempted to be Transported without Our
License in that behalf: And in case they shall find or discover any Iron
(except as in the said Letters Patents is excepted) so bought, sold, or
removed, before the same shall be Marked, or any Iron or Iron-Metall so
shipped, to be Transported without Our License; Then Our pleasure and express
Commandment is, That the said Officer or Officers, and every of them, or his,
or their Deputies, or Assigns, do seize, detain, and take the same, as
forfeited to Us, Our Heirs, and Successors.

And We do further hereby declare Our Royal Will and pleasure to be, That the
said Officers, their Deputies, or Assigns, may lawfully and at convenient
times, enter into any Woods or Wood-grounds of any Our Subjects, wherein any
Woods are or shall be Felled, Cut, or Coarded, to be converted into Coals for
the making of Iron, or Iron-Metall, and there to survey and view the same,
whereby it may appear of what nature and condition the Woods are that shall be
converted or employed that way, and that the Transgressors therein may be
proceeded against, and duly punished according to Our Laws: And to these Our
Royal Commands We shall expect and require a due conformity and obedience of
all Our Subjects whom it shall concern, under the pain of Our high
displeasure, and such punishments as by the Laws and Statutes of the Realm,
or otherwise, may be inflicted on them for their contempts or neglects herein.

And lastly, We do hereby Will and require all Justices of Peace, Majors,
Sheriffs, Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other Our Officers and
Ministers whatsoever whom it shall concern, to be aiding and assisting to Our
said Officers, their Deputies or Assigns, in the due execution of the
premises, as they tender Our service, and will answer for the contrary at
their perils.

Given at Our Court at Oatlands, the nine and twentieth day of July, in the
thirteenth year of Our Reign. God save the King.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1637.
