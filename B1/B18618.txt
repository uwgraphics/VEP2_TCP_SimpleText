The CASE OF Sir FRANCIS FANE The Younger.
FIRST, The Bill sets forth, that upon his Marriage be settled the Manor of
Firbeck, and Lands thereunto belonging, lying in the County of York, upon
several Trustees, to the use of himself for Life; the Remainder to Hannah his
Wife for her Jointure; the Remainder to the Heirs Males of the Body of the said
Sir Francis Fane on the Body of the said Hannah his Wife, the Remainder to the
Right Heirs of Sir Francis Fane in Fee; so there is no other Remainder limited
in the said conveyance, which might be cut off, if Sir Francis and his Wife,
and the Trustees had joined, they might have made a good Estate, without an Act
of Parliament.

But there being a Lease for ninety nine years, of the same Manor, and Lands
to other Trustees, for a Provision for Daughters Portions begotten by Sir
Francis on the Body of his said Wife, in case there were no Heirs Males: If the
said Trustees had suffered a Recovery of this Estate, and the effect of the
first Conveyance ceasing, would have come in upon them, and vested in Interest;
so that this Lease without an Act of Parliament cannot be unsettled; nor can
any good Estate be made, to a Purchaser. The Act further sets forth, that there
being some encumbrances upon the said Manor of Firbeck, undischarged before
the said settlement: and that he the said Sir Francis has contracted some
Debts since, is desirous that the said Debts might be paid, and Encumbrances
discharged: But having no other Lands which he can expose to sale, which will
be sold at so ^ood a rate, as the said Manor of Firbeck, The said Sir Francis
has prevailed with John Rushworth Father of the said Hannah, and with the
Trustees to consent to the sale thereof; provided always, that the said Sir
Francis do settle an Estate equivalent, to the value of the said Manor and
Premises.

And it is particularly expressed in the said Act, what Estate the said Sir
Francis does settle, in lieu of the said Manor, as a Provision for a Jointure
for his said Wife, for the good of the Heirs Males, and for Daughters Portions
in case of no Heirs Males; and has (by Deed in Writing under his Hand and
Seal) settled that Estate accordingly in case it please the Parliament to pass
this Act; wherein the consent of all parties does concur accordingly.
