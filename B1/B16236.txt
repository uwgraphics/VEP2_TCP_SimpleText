PRO CONSILIO SVO VIRGINIAE

By his Majesty's Commissioners FOR VIRGINIA.
WHereas the Kings most excellent Majesty, out of his especial Grace and care
of the good of the Plantation of Virginia, has granted a Commission under the
Great Seal of England, dated the 15. day of this present month of July,
directed to the right Honorable the Lord Viscount Mandeuile Lord President of
his Council, and others of his Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council, and
to diverse others, for the present ordering of the affairs of the Colony and
Plantation of Virginia, until his Majesty shall make a full and absolute
settlement thereof, according to his Royal intention:

These are therefore to give notice to all Masters of ships, and all others,
Planters, or Adventurers in or unto Virginia, who have any intention to go or
send thither; That the Commissioners do weekly and every Thursday in the
afternoon, sit about the execution of that Commission, at the house of Sir
Thomas Smith, in Philpot Lane; whither all parties whom it shall concern, may
repair, to receive such directions as shall be requisite, both for their own
better warrant and surety who shall go thither, and for the better
encouragement, and assuring of the Plantation already settled there.
