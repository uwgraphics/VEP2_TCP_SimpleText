THE SUCCESS of THE Two English Travelers Newly arrived in London.
To a New Irish Tune.
AS we was a Ranging
upon the Salt Seas,
For France and for Spain,
our humors to please;
But when we came there,
the first News we did hear,
Was, you Rebels of England
what do you do here.
When we was a walking
along in the street,
Both Men, Wives and Children,
and all we did meet,
They gathered up stones,
and at us did fling,
Cried Rebels of England,
you murdered your King.
All this being odious
unto our own hearts,
Then from the French
we were forced to depart;
The French did deride us,
with scornful disdain,
We hoised up Top-sail
and sailed for Spain.
But when we came there,
we'd not set foot on Land,
But strait they perceived
that we were English Men,
With their hands on their Rapiers
their Cloaks off did fling,
Crying Rebels of England,
you murdered your King.
All this being odious
unto our conceits,
We hoised and hastened
up into the Straits;
Next Port unto Venice,
intending to go,
Not fearing nor dreading
they did of it know.
But when we came there,
our Ships they did scan,
They saw by our Colors,
we were English Men,
O they laughed in their Lingo,
and at us did fleer;
You Rebels of England
what do you do here?
Thus twenty years wandering
from Seaport to Town,
In all parts abused,
resolved to turn home:
We steered up for London,
but when we came there,
The Court all in Mourning,
put us in despair.
Then great Charles of England,
we found was interred,
And some known Offenders
in Mourning appeared;
Who for some years together,
had designed and swore,
To serve him as they did
his Father before.
Great James of his Birthright,
they sought to depose,
But now for ten Guinneys
you will find none of those,
King James is Established
safe in his Throne,
And none shall invade
the just Rights of the Crown:
And now we are resolved
in England to stay,
And wait for to serve,
and our King to obey,
And his Royal Consort,
Queen Mary's blessed Name:
And we will drive both the French,
and the Dutch over the Main.
