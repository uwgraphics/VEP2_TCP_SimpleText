A Proclamation touching Fishing.
JAMES by the grace of God, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,
Defender of the faith, etc. To all and singular persons, to whom it may
appertain, Greeting. Although we do sufficiently know by our experience in
the Office of Regal dignity (in which by the favor of Almighty God, we have
been placed and exercised these many years) as also by the observation which
we have made of other Christian Princes exemplary actions, how far the
absoluteness of Sovereign power extends it self, And that in regard
thereof we need not yield account to any person under God, for any action of
ours, which is lawfully grounded upon that just Prerogative: Yet such has ever
been, and shall be our care and desire to give satisfaction to our neighbor
Princes, and friends, in any action which may have the least relation to their
Subjects and Estates, as we have thought good (by way of friendly premonition)
to declare unto them all, and to whom soever it may appertain, as follows.

Whereas we have been contented since our coming to the Crown, to tolerate an
indifferent and promiscuous kind of liberty to all our friends whatsoever,
to fish within our Streams, and upon any of our Coasts of Great Britain,
Ireland, and other adjacent Islands, so far forth as the permission or use
thereof might not redound to the empeachment of our Prerogative Royal, nor to
the hurt and damage of our loving Subjects, whose preservation and flourishing
estate we hold our self principally bound to advance before all worldly
respects: So finding that our conniuence therein, has not only given occasion
of over great encrochments upon our Regalities, or rather questioning of our
Right, but has been a means of much daily wrongs to our own people that
exercise the trade of Fishing, as (either by the multitude of strangers, which
do preoccupy those places, or by the injuries which they receive most commonly
at their hands) our Subjects are constrained to abandon their Fishing, or at
the least are become so discouraged in the same, as they hold it better for
them, to betake themselves to some other course of living, whereby not only
diverse of our Coast-Townes are much decayed, but the number of Mariners daily
diminished, which is a matter of great consequence to our Estate, considering
how much the strength thereof consists in the power of Shipping, and use of
Navigations: We have thought it now both just and necessary (in respect that
we are now by Gods favor liueally and lawfully possessed, as well of the
Island of Great Britain, as of Ireland, and the rest of the Isles adjacent) to
bethink our selves of good and lawful means to prevent those inconveniences,
and many others depending upon the same. In the consideration whereof, as we
are desirous that the world may take notice, that we have no intention to deny
our Neighbors and Allies, those fruits and benefits of Peace and friendship,
which may be justly expected at our hands in honor and reason, or are
affoorded by other Princes mutually in the point of Commerce, and exchange of
those things which may not prove prejudicial to them: So because some such
convenient order may be taken in this matter, as may sufficiently provide for
all these important considerations which do depend thereupon; We have
resolved first to give notice to all the world, That our express pleasure is,
that from the beginning of the Month of August next coming, no person of what
Nation or quality soever, being not our natural borne Subject, be permitted
to fish upon any of our Coasts and Seas of Great Britain, Ireland, and the
rest of the Isles adjacent, where most usually heretofore any Fishing has
been, until they have orderly demanded and obtained Licenses from us, or such
our Commissioners, as we have authorized in that behalf, Viz. at London for
our Realms of England and Ireland, and at Edenborough for our Realm of
Scotland; Which Licenses, our intention is, shall be yearly demanded, for so
many Vessels and Ships, and the Tonnage thereof, as shall intend to Fish for
that whole year, or any part thereof, upon any of our Coasts and Seas as
aforesaid, upon pain of such chastisement, as shall be fit to be in flicted
upon such wilful offenders.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the sixth day of May, in the seventh year
of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Jreland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. ANNO DOM. 1609.
