By the King. A Proclamation signifying his Majesty's pleasure, That all men
being in Office of government, at the decease of his most dear, and most
royal Father King James, shall so continue, till his Majesty's further
direction.
FOrasmuch as it has pleased Almighty God, lately to call unto his infinite
mercy, the most High and Mighty Prince, King James, of most blessed memory, the
Kings Majesty's most dear and entirely beloved Father, by whose decease, the
authority and power of the most part of the offices and places of Jurisdiction,
and government within this Realm, and in the Realm of Ireland, did cease and
fail, the Sovereign person failing, from whom the same were derived; And
thereupon, through doubtfulnesse, or want of authority, in such persons, as
were invested in the said offices and places, the settled and ordinary course of
Justice, and of the affairs of State, (if remedy be not provided) might
receive disturbance, and prejudice, by discontinuance, and interruption; The
Kings most excellent Majesty, in his Princely wisdom, and care of the State,
(reserving to his own judgment hereafter, the reformation and redress of
any abuses in misgouernment, upon due knowledge and examination thereof,) is
pleased, and has so expressly signified, that all persons that at the time of
the decease of the late King, his dearly beloved Father, were duly and
lawfully possessed of, or invested in any office, or place of authority, or
government, either Civil, or Martial, within this Realm of England, or in
the Realm of Ireland, or in any other his Majesty's Dominions belonging
thereunto; And namely, all Presidents, Lieuetenants, Vicepresidents, Judges,
Justices, Sheriffs, deputy Lieutenants, Commissioners of Musters, Justices of
peace, and all others in place of government, either meaner, or superior, as
aforesaid; And all other officers and ministers, whose interests and estates in
their offices are determined, or ceased by the means before mentioned, shall
be, and shall hold themselves continued in the said places and offices, as
formerly they held and enjoyed the same, until his Majesty's pleasure be
further known.

And that in the mean while, for the preservation of the peace, and necessary
proceedings in matters of justice, and for the safety and service of the State,
all the said persons, of whatsoever degree or condition, may not fail, every
one severally, according to his place, office, or charge, to proceed in the
performance and execution of all duties thereunto belonging, as formerly
appertained unto them, and every of them, while the late Kings Majesty was
living.

And further, His Majesty does hereby will and command all and singular His
Highness Subjects, of what estate, dignity or degree, they, or any of them
be, to be ayding, helping, assisting, and at the commandment of the said
officers and ministers, in the performance, and execution of the said offices
and places, as they, and every of them, tender His Majesty's pleasure, and will
answer for the contrary, at their uttermost perils.

And further, His Majesty's will, and pleasure, and express commandment is,
That all orders and directions made, or given by the Lords of the Privy
Council of the late King, in his life time, shall be obeyed, and performed by
all, and every person and persons, and all, and every thing, and things to be
done thereupon, shall proceed as fully and amply, as the same should have been
obeyed or done, in the life of the said late King, His Majesty's most dear,
and entirely beloved father.

Given at the Court at S. James, the eight and twentieth day of March, in the
first year of His Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
