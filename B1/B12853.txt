By the King.
A Proclamation for the due making and sizing of Brick.
THE Kings most Excellent Majesty, shortly after His first happy entrance into
this kingdom, taking into His Royal consideration the great decay and
consumption of Timber, and the necessity of preservation thereof, for most
necessary uses, and especially for the shipping and Navy of this Realm (an
especial part of the defense and safety of the same) and that in the very City
of London (being the principal City of this kingdom, and His Majesty's Royal
Chamber, whereunto, not only the Noblemen and Gentry of this Realm, but also
the States, Ambassadors, and others of foreign Nations do continually resort)
for want of sufficient Timber, they were daily driven to build with Beech, and
other like kind of Timber of small continuance (which in time, if the same
were not prevented, would turn to the peril and decay of the same City) did
propose unto himself, and resolve of a course of building with Brick, in, and
near the said City of London, foreseeing the good event that would ensue
thereupon. And to that purpose sithence, has published diverse Proclamations,
and granted diverse Commissions to some of the Lords of His Privy Counsel and
others (by time and experience found necessary) for the better ordering and
effecting that so worthy a work; whose care and endeavor in the execution of
those Proclamations and Commissions, His Majesty does graciously accept, and
highly commend. And whereas His Majesty, from time to time remaining constant
to his former resolution, has now found apparent and manifest, what himself
preiudged, that the materials of Brick are of far better use then those of
Timber, for such of His Subjects as have occasion to build, in, or near the
said City of London, and tends not only to the preservation of the said
City, and places adjoining, from diverse inconveniences and mischiefs, which
might happen by reason of building the walls and forefronts of houses there
with Timber, but also to the beautifying and adorning the same City and places
adjacent, to the honor, beauty, and luster thereof, which for this small time
of proceeding with Brick, is greatly applauded and approved, as well by
Ambassadors of foreign Nations, as others: His Majesty does therefore hereby
encourage his said Commissioners, and require them, as they have begun with
care and endeavor, so to continue their vigilance over this so good a work,
and from time to time, to put in execution His Majesty's gracious and Princely
commandments therein, and to chastise and reform all those that are, or shall
be contemptuous or disobedient to the same.

And now His Majesty finding, that the goodness of the work it self has
overcome all opposition, all men of quality and worth most readily and
willingly proceeding therein; His Majesty to comfort and encourage them in such
their conformity, is most desirous to provide that His Subjects, which shall
have cause to build, be not by any sinister practice, or for any private
respect wronged, or ^^^iudiced, either by making of the said material of
Brick insufficient, or by enhansing, or raising of the prices thereof, being
of necessity to be used; the said materials of Brickes having been of late
years (by the undue courses of the Brickmakers) very slightly, insufficiently,
and ill made, the earth being neither dug, nor cast up in seasonable times,
nor well wrought, neither the Brickes molded, dried, and burned as they ought
to be. For prevention whereof His Majesty, having (upon deliberate
consideration and advice, of men of judgment, experience, and worth, for the
general good of His Subjects that shall be occasioned to build with Brick)
caused these ensuing Instructions and Directions to be devised, as rules to be
observed, in the true making and sale of Brickes, Has thought it necessary to
publish the same to His loving Subjects, and does hereby straightly charge and
command, that no person or persons after the last day of this present month of
November, do make or cause to be made within five miles of any the gates of
the said City of London, or bring or convey, or cause to be brought or
conveyed, either by water or by land, unto the said City of London, or any
place or places within five miles of the gates of the same City, or utter,
sell, or put to sale, within the said City, or in any place or places within
five miles thereof, as aforesaid, to any person or persons whatsoever, at any
time or times hereafter, any Brickes, made contrary to the true meaning of
these His Majesty's Directions, or at any higher price or rate then is heerin
after mentioned, upon pain of His Majesty's indignation, and displeasure, and
the seuerest censure of his Court of Star chamber, and such further pains
and punishments, as by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, may be inflicted
upon them for their offenses and contempt.

First, that the earth whereof the Brickes shall be made, be good and fit for
that purpose; The first digging thereof to be between the feasts of S. Michael
the Arch-angell, and S. Thomas the Apostle; And the second digging, turning, or
casting up of the said earth to be, at, or before the last day of February
ensuing; And that no person whatsoever do presume to dig, or make any Brick
in any place within one mile of the Gates of the said City of London, from and
after the last day of this present month of November.

Item, that the said earth be sufficiently and well wrought and tempered
before it be molded.

Item, that the Brickemakers mould, or cause to be molded, no earth for
Brick, but only between the feast of the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin
Mary, and the last day of August yearly, and at no other time or season.

Item, that in the moulding of the said Brickes, the mouldes be thoroughly and
well filled, and not set in the moulds, in the laying down, and that they be
sufficiently and well dried before they be burned, and then carefully and
thoroughly burned.

Item, that for the Assize, every Brick being burned contain in length, nine
inches, in breadth, four inches one quarter and half a quarter of an inch,
and in thickness, two inches and one quarter of an inch.

Item, that for the price, they sell not their Brickes above the rate of eight
shillings the thousand, at the Kill, being made and wrought in goodness and
manner as aforesaid.

And to the end his Majesty's care of this so useful and necessary a material
should take effect; His Highness will and pleasure is, and His Majesty does
hereby command, That the Commissioners for buildings do appoint either the
Master and Wardens of the Company of Bricklayers of the said City of London,
for the time being, or such other trusty persons of skill and experience, as
shall be by the said Commissioners thought fit, from time to time to make
search and enquiry in all places within the City of London, and all other
places within five miles of the Gates of the said City, as well of the due
observation of the Articles aforesaid, as of the prices hereby limited; And
that where they shall find any breach of any of these his Majesty's
Directions, That they from time to time make known the same to his Majesty's
Commissioners for building, for the time being, with the names of the parties
offending, whom We also hereby require and authorize thereupon, to take due
examination, as well of any neglect or contempt which shall be used by the said
Bricklayers, by conniuency or otherwise, as of the offenses and contempts to be
committed by the Brickemakers or others, making, carrying, bringing, or
uttering any Brickes, contrary to the true intent of the Directions aforesaid,
and the same, together with the names of the offenders, from time to time, to
certify to His Majesty's Attorney General, for the time being, to be
proceeded against in the said high Court of Star Chamber, as wilful
contemners of this his Majesty's pleasure and commandment.

And where any neglect or contempt of this His Majesty's commandment shall be
found in places more remote, His Majesty does hereby authorize and require
His Justices of Peace, within their several limits and divisions, and every of
them to take due examination and notice of any offenses and offenders,
contrary to the true meaning of these His Majesty's Directions, as aforesaid
and to make known the same to His Majesty's said Commissioners for Buildings,
and they to make further certificate unto His Majesty's said Attorney General,
to be prosecuted in manner aforesaid; whom We hereby command to sue, and
prosecute such offenders accordingly.

Given at Our Court at Theobalds, the seventh day of November, in the year of
Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, the twentieth, and of Scotland the
six and fiftieth. God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXII.
