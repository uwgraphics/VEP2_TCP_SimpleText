CERTAIN ARTICLES concerning the Statute lately made for the relief of the
poor, to be executed in London by the Churchwardens and Overseers of every
parish, according to the effect of the same Statute.
INprimis, the said Churchwardens and Overseers or ye greater part of them
shall take order from time to time by consent of two or more of the Justices of
peace, for setting to work of the children of all such persons within the same
parish whose parents shall not be thought by them able to keep and maintain
their children. Wherein it is thought fit that children of eight years old or
upwards be set on work, and such as be twelve years old or upward, if they
be not before that time bounden apprentises, be at those years bounden
apprentises by the said Churchwardens and Overseers, according to the intent of
the said Statute.

Also all such persons married or unmarried, as having no means to maintain
themselves, use no ordinary trade of life to get their living by, are to be
set on work by the said Churchwardens and Overseers: Wherein it is thought
meet that such as willingly submit themselves to the law to work within the
parish, may be set to work within their parish in these trades following, viz:

Or in any other trade, for which the said persons shall be found more meet,
having supply of stock as the law appoints: and that such as will not
orderly work within their parish, shall be sent to Bridewell or to other
places for that purpose to be appointed there to work, for which purpose the
Justices of peace are ready to give their warrantes upon certificate or
complaint of the Churchwardens and Overseers, they having authority by the
statute so to do.

The Churchwardens and Overseers with consent of the two Justices of peace,
must make a taxation of every inhabitant within the parish, be they free or not
free of the City, for a convenient stock of flax, hemp wool, thread, Iron,
and other necessary stuff, to set the poor on work within the said parish,
and for a weekly allowance toward the necessary relief of the lame,
impotent, old, blind, and such other amongst them being poor and not able to
work, and for putting poor children apprentises: Wherein it is thought meet
that they having due consideration of the necessity of each person and of
their abilities to work, and of their charge do make allowance to every one
ratablie according to their wantes, and that the said Churchwardens and
Overseers do collect and distribute the said taxations monthly, and dispose
of the stock according to the intent of the Statute.

And touching such ouercharge as in some parishes shall happen by occasion of
the great multitude of the poor there to be relieved, more then the weekly
allowance of such parishes will supply, the Justices of peace are to tax,
rate, and assesse any of any other parishes to pay such sum and sums of
money to the churchwardens and Overseers of ye said poor parish for the
purposes aforesaid, as they shall think fit. Which taxation so made by the
Justices of peace, the Churchwardens, and overseers in every parish are from
time to time to receive and collect as the other tax, and to pay the same
over, monthly, to the hands of the Treasurer appointed by the City for that
purpose for the year, to be by him distributed, according to the direction of
the Justices of the peace, and true intent of the said Statute: wherein it is
wished, for that some Churchwardens be many times very poor, that care be had
that such of the Overseers or Churchwardens as be of good ability may receive
and keep the money collected until it be paid over as above.

The Churchwardens and the Overseers appointed must meet together at the least
once every month in the Church of the said parish, upon the Sunday in the
after noone, after divine service, to consider of some good course to be taken,
and some meet orders to be set down by them in the premises, upon pain to
forfaite twenty shillinges for every default, without lawful cause.

The Churchwardens and the Overseers must within four days after the end of
their year (which began when the said Overseers were appointed) and after
new Overseers nominated as aforesaid, make and yield up to such two Justices of
peace a true and perfect account of all sums of money by them received, or
rated and cessed and not received, and of such stock as shall be in their
hands, or in the hands of the poor to work, and of all other things
concerning their said office, and such sum or sums of money as shall be in
their hands, shall pay and deliver over to the said Churchwardens and
Overseers newly nominated as aforesaid, upon pain to forfaite for every
default in being negligent in their office, or in the execution of the orders
aforesaid being made by, and with the assent of the said Justices of peace,
twenty shillings.

The Churchwardens and Overseers, or any of them are by warrant from any two
such Justices of the peace, to leuy as well the said sums of money of every one
that shall refuse to contribute according as they shall be assessed by
distress and sale of the offenders goods, as the sums of money or stock
which shall be behind upon any account to be made as aforesaid, rendering to
the party the overplus, and in default of such distress, it is also lawful
for two Justices of the peace to commit to prison such as refuse to contribute:
there to remain without bail or mainprise, till payment be made of the said
sum or stock.

And it is lawful for any two such Justices of peace to commit to prison every
one of the said Churchwardens and Overseers, which shall refuse to account,
there to remain without bail or mainprise, till he has made a true account
and satisfied and paid so much as upon the said account shall be remaining in
his hands.

It is also enacted, that such persons as shall go wandering abroad and beg in
any place wheresoever by license or without, unless it be poor people, who
shall ask relief of victuals only in the same parish where they shall dwell,
according to the direction of the Churchwardens and Overseers, shall be
accounted as Rogues and so punished. Provided always nevertheless, that every
soldier being discharged of his service, or otherwise lawfully licensed to
pass into his country, and not having wherewith to relieve himself in his
travels homewards, and every seafaring man landing from sea, not having
wherewith to relieve himself in his travels homewardes, having a Testimonial
under the hand of some one Justice of the peace, of or near the place where he
landed or was discharged setting down therein the place and time, where and
when he landed, or was discharged, and the place of the parties dwelling or
birth, unto which he is to pass, and a convenient time therein to be limited
for his passage, shall and may without incurring the danger or penalty of this
Act, in the usual ways directly to the place unto which he is directed to
pass, and within the time in such his Testimonial limited for his passage,
ask and receive such relief as shall be necessary in and for his passage, the
said act or any thing therein contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

And for that notwithstanding the liberal contribution of the parishioners,
and the great travel and care of the Churchwardens and Overseers in every
parish, to provide for their own poor be well effected: yet the negligence of
the Constables in many places in suffering Rogues to wander and beg in the
streets, and the frowardnes of some stubborn beggars who will not be
reformed, does breed a great scandal to the city, and in time will discourage
the better sort to continue any liberal contribution for the poor, unless due
reformation be had for the said Rogues, and wandering beggars: it is therefore
thought mere and so declared that every Constable and other officer, who shall
be found negligent, or remiss in the execution of the statute lately made for
punishment of Rogues and vagabondes, shall be censured and punished so far as
the law and authority of the chief Magistrate in that place will allow, and
that diligent inquiry of their defaults shall be made from time to time, as shall
be needful.

FINIS.
