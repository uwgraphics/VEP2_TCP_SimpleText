By the King.
A Proclamation concerning Tynne.
WHereas for the well ordering of the Tynne of this Our Realm of England,
diverse and sundry good Customs, Laws, and Ordinances have been heretofore
used, made, and established, by the wisdom of former times, amongst which
there has been ever special care and provision, that all the said Tynne
should be duly brought to certain places of Coynage, and there tried and
assayed and peyzed at certain Balances, and by weight used for that purpose,
and by a Stamp or Mark ordained for that purpose, sealed and allowed before
the same be put to sale within the Land, or offered to be Shipped for
Foreign vent. And to that end also Our noble Progenitors have been at charge
to erect and maintain certain Coynage houses in several Towns within Our
Counties of Deuon and Cornwall, lying most commodious for the said Coynage,
with Balances and Weights there, and Officers and Ministers attending that
service. At which places at certain days of Coynage and post-Coynage
appointed, special Officers of the Stannaries do, and have been wont duly
to attend, to receive, try, assay, peyze, coin, seal and allow the said
Tynne, by setting a Mark, Seal, or Stamp upon the same.

By which means both We and Our Progenitors were secured of the emption or
preemption and Coynage duties of the said Tynne, being ancient and undoubted
hereditarie Revenues annexed to Our Crown in right of Our Duchy of Cornwall,
and also the Tynne had his just and true assay, according to the goodness and
richness of it, that neither Our own Subjects nor others might be defrauded
in the buying of the same, nor yet the Subject hindered by any unnecessary
delay in the lawful Trading and Merchandising thereof.

And whereas out of a Princely care to cherish and maintain the Trade and
Working of such a worthy and Staple Commodity, of so much honor and profit
to this Commonwealth, Our dear Father (of blessed memory) did not long since
take order to allow a greater price for the working and making thereof then
ever was given before, which We have hither-vnto continued.

And Our said late Father in His life time by sad advice, did settle the Tynne
business in a more orderly and better course then ever before it was, as well
for the benefit of Us, being then Prince, as for the contentment and
satisfaction of Our loving Subjects, the Merchants and Pewterers of London and
other places.

Yet nevertheless We are informed, That by the secret practice and combination
of sundry ill minded and covetous owners and workmen of the said Tynne and
Tynne works, a great part of the said Tynne has been heretofore, and daily
is bought and sold, received, delivered, and carried away uncoined, as well in
Ships and other Vessels, which under color of coming to buy Cornish Slate
and Stone and such like occasions, upon the coast of Cornwall, do imbezill
much uncoined Tynne in Blocks, as also by Mariners and Seafaring men, who buy
up the Tynne in Bars, commonly called, Pocket Tynne, of Blowers and Melters
of Tynne and others, contrary to the ancient Ordinances of Our Stannaries
aforesaid, to Our prejudice and wrong in Our said Revenue, and the disgracing
of Our said Commodity and abuse of Our Subjects buying the same untried and
not assayed.

In respect whereof, as We might most justly extend the rigor of Our Laws
against sundry offenders notoriously faulty in this behalf, both against the
Law and Custom of the Realm and of the Stannaries, and against Our late dear
Fathers Proclamation, which in Our natural inclination to mercy We have
forborne; So We cannot in Our Princely care of the Commonwealth and Our own
right, but provide for redress and reformation of these great disorders for
the time to come; And finding that the Proclamation made by Our dear deceased
Father, has not wrought that good effect that was expected; We therefore do
by these presents straitely charge and command, as well all and singular Our
loving Subjects, as all other person and persons whatsoever, that none of them
presume, upon any color, shift, or pretense whatsoever, at any time or times
hereafter, to utter, sell, deliver, or put to sale, or to receive, ship,
carry, land, or contract for any Black Tynne vnblowne, but such as cause the
same to be cast, melted down, and blown and brought to the place of Coynage,
before it be sold for use, nor to sell, give, barter, or utter any White Tynne,
or Cast Tynne before it be first Coined and Stamped with Our Seal or Mark
appointed for that purpose, as aforesaid, upon pain of forfeiture as well of
the said Tynne, and other condign punishment in case of land carriage, as also
of confiscation of the Ships, Hoyes, Barques, Lighters, and other Vessels
wherein any such prohibited Tynne shall be shipped or laden for transportation
contrary to the intendment of this Our Proclamation, and also upon pain of Our
high displeasure, and of such further penalties, forfeitures, and punishments
in both cases, as by the Statutes and Ordinances of Our said Stannaries, or any
other Law or Statute whatsoever, or by the censure of Our high Court of
Star Chamber, for disobeying this Our Royal Commandment and Iniunction, or
otherwise may be inflicted upon the offenders in this behalf.

Giving all Our loving Subjects to know, that any toleration or forbearance for
the time past shall be so far from justifying or warranting the like abuses
to be continued in time to come, as contrary wise it shall aggrauate the fault
thereof in respect of Our former clemency.

And whereas We are given to understand, that there are certain wandering
Pettie-Chapmen, and Tinkers and others haunting much about the Tynne works and
places of melting of Tynne, who do make it a usual Trade to buy and barter
Black Tynne by the Bowl, and White Tynne uncoined by the pound weight, or
other small quantity, and so do carry the same from the said places, to
certain private places of receipt, till having gotten by this unlawful means
some store together, they vent or spend the said Black Tynne before it be
blown, and sell the said White Tynne before it be Coined, by sea or by land
where they find best Chapmen, to the prejudice of Us and Our loving Subjects
as aforesaid:

Our will and pleasure is, and We straitely charge and command all and
singular Our Justices of Peace, and all the Officers and Ministers of the
Stannaries, and others whom it shall or may concern, before whom any such
Tinker, Pettie-Chapman, or other person offending shall be brought, diligently
to examine and find out, where, and of whom he had the said prohibited Tynne
White or Black found with him, and where and to whom he meant or intended to
sell the same, or has heretofore sold any other of like sort: And as well the
said Tinkers and Pettie-Chapmen, as all other persons who shall be found
privy to the buying or selling, receiving, delivering, or bartering of the
said Tynne Black or White, as aforesaid, to commit to Our Jail of the
Stannarie of that County where they shall be taken, and otherwise to punish
them according to the Laws, Customs, and Ordinances of Our Stannaries, as the
quality and nature of the offense shall by the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm deserve, and for contempt of Our Royal Commandment and Proclamation in
this behalf.

And where We have lately granted to some of Our loving Subjects the emption
or preemption of Tynne, during a term vnexpired, and for relief of poor
Pewterers of the City of London have provided, That if the said Lessees or
Farmors shall be minded to transport any Tynne in Bars, they shall employ the
said Pewterers of London, or some of them that Our said Farmors shall nominate
for the casting of Tynne out of Blocks into Bars, at such places as We
shall appoint, and in default of such appointment, at such places as Our said
Farmors shall appoint: Sithence which time many have presumed to cast Tynne
into Bars, both in the Counties of Cornwall and Deuon and elsewhere, which is
a means that a great part thereof is the more easily conveyed from place to
place and vented before the Coynage thereof, and others then Our Farmers have
opportunity to transporte the same, contrary to Our agreements made with them:
We do straitely inhibite all persons that none of them, other then such of
the Pewterers of Our City of London as shall be nominated by the Farmors of
the emption or preemption of Tynne, for the time being, do presume to cast any
Tynne into Bars, and that none of them cast any Tynne into Bars but in the
City of London, And that in the same City none be so cast but in such houses
and places of melting as shall be designed or allowed of by Our said Farmors,
upon the pains to be inflicted upon contemners of Our Commands in Our Court
of Star Chamber and otherwise.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall this two and twentieth day of January, in the
ninth year of Our Reign of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, FRANCE, and IRELAND. God save
the King.

Majesty: and by the Assigns of John Bill. 1633.
