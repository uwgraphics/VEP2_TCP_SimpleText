TO THE MUSICIONERS, THE Harpers, the Minstrels, the Singers, the Dancers, the
Persecutors;

From one who loved Dancing and Music as his life, which being parted with,
and the LIGHT being come, which was before these things, in which they are all
seen, and from it is declared,

The Ground, Foundation, Beginning, and Father, and Children, and Compass, and
End, and the Effects of all the Harpers, Mucisioners, Singers and Dancers:

Who may read what I have learned, who have tried their ways, and also
searched into the things of God, and declare this according to Scripture, and
have found the joy which man cannot take away, in which I rejoice for ever,
because the Marriage of the Lamb is come.

London, Printed in the 11th month, 1658.

IUBAL was the father of all such as handle the Harp and Organ, and so the
father of all such Musicioners, being himself of the seed of Lamech, who slew a
man, and so the son of a manslayer was the father of all such as handle the
Harp and Organ; and the man Christ, the Light, is the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world: and Jubal was of the generation of Cain, who first
slew a man, and then built a City; he slew his brother, one that was near unto
him: and the light of the Lamb slain is near unto every one, even that which
comes from the man of sorrows is in the heart, Cains seed slays the man of
sorrows, the Musicioners were of Cains seed, and that which slays the man of
sorrows, invents, set up and delights in the instruments of music; and the
father of all such was Jubal, the seed of Cain, who built a City, and so was a
rich man, and his seed delighted in music, and so his seed, who are begotten
from the Lord, are building Cities, strong holds, high and large houses, with
painted Parlours, and then set up the instruments of Music, in the cieled
houses without, and within themselves full of rottenness, or as a Cage of
unclean spirits, whereby the just is murdered, and the house lie waste and
desolate, as to the life of God, which should be the Temple of the holy Ghost;
and the father of all these was Jubal, the seed of Lamech a manslayer, who
also had another son Tubal-Cain (the seed of Cain) an instructor of every
artificer in brass and iron; and he that has attained to never so much, if not
come to that which fulfils the perfect Law, is as a sounding brass, 1 Cor. 13.
and there is many also of the seed of this instructor, whose instructions
brings people to be but as sounding brass: and this first instructor, and
Jubal, were the offspring of Cain, the vagabond driven from God, against whom
the blood of the righteous does cry, yet so rich in the earth, that he built a
City, being separated from God, (who confounds man's wisdom) then comes that
which makes merry over the Witness, Genesis 4.

And they who danced in the wilderness, and sung and made a great noise, and
were in the mirth and vain delights, were a stiff-necked people and such as
sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play, like the same generation now,
who are stiff necked and bow not to him who is the Light, low in the heart to
whom every knee shall bow, but eat and drink, and rise up to vain delights,
having music at their feasts, feeding themselves without fear, Jude 12. like
Jezabel, (at whose table the false Prophets feed) who made a feast, when she
intended to murder the righteous, to gain his possession, (read within) and
that which murders the just, and such who forgets God, delights in these
things, for they that sung and danced in the wilderness, forgot the mighty
power of the Lord which brought them out of bondage, therefore they got into
the carnal liberty, like many others at this day, before they come to the true
rest, and these were in the false worship, who worship that which the carnal
eye might perceive, and these had lost the true guide, and when they were in
their singing and dancing, they knew not what was become of him, who was the
Minsster of the Law that discovers sin: but though they who danced saw him not
for a time, and began to despise him, yet in a time unexpected, he came upon
them in the fierceness of his anger, who executed the judgments of the Lord
upon those vain dancers, with whom he was grieved, who was in the Church in the
wilderness, and is the holy One in the midst, who with a sudden slaughter
destroyed these dancers, whose voice of singing was not because of mastery,
neither was their voise the voice of the cry of the oppressed, and these were
Idolaters, whose hearts were uncircumcised, and knew not the ways of God, who
therefore condemned them with an utter overthrow, that they perished in the
wilderness where they thus sinned, after they had seen the deliverances of the
Lord, as many of the Rulers and people of England have done, who have forgotten
their Leader, to whom these are left for an ensample, of whom there were about
thirty thousand slain, for their singing, dancing, and false worship, Exodus 32.
1 Cor. 9.

And Herod had dancing before him, and she that danced, and he that was pleased
with the dancing, caused his head to be taken off that directed to him that is
the Light, and preached the Lamb, that takes away the sin, and their carnal
nature, and so this murders that, which is to prepare the way of the Lord; and
they took off his head, and murdered him, who was a burning and a shining
Light, and slew him that preached Repentance, and so the dancers, and the
Rulers of the earth, who were pleased with dancing and music, murders that in
them, which calls to repentance, and are ready to murder such as preach
repentance to them: and whilst there is a delighting in dancing and music,
that which calls to repentance is in bondage, for John was in prison, when
Herod was pleased with the dancing; and there is not a greater Prophet, than
he that preaches repentance, and he that proclaims the way of the Lord was in
prison, and she that danced desired his death, and he that caused him to be
beheaded was a King, a great one in the earth, who was pleased with
dancing, and was a svvearer out of Christ's doctrine, for he promised with an
oath, whatsoever she would ask, who danced before him; then nothing would
satisfy the dancer, but the death of him who preached repentance, and he was
an observer of days, and kept the day of his birth with dancing: it was his
birth day, the day of his birte, in which he was brought forth, who was a
svvearer, (the svvearers delight in dancing) that caused his head to be taken
off, who warned them that had the Oracles of God, to fly from the wrath to
come, and said they were a generation of Vipers, who had the Scriptures, and
came also to his baptism, and brought not forth fruits meet for repentance,
(these are the Vipers) and so that which is to lead unto Christ does suffer in
bondage, and is murdered, and the head or first appearance of it taken off,
upon that day which the birth of that is brought forth, which is pleased with
the dancing; not like Job and Jeremy, and delights in the music, and that
which exercises the mind of the creature in the dancing, desires the death
and murdering of that in prison, which is to call to repentance, above all
other things; yea there is nothing then so much desired, as the killing and
overcoming of that which is cast into prison, by him that delights in the
music, Matthew, 14.

And when them in Israel who had Harps (the Musicioners) them who delighted
in music, were carried captive into Babylon, the land of Confusion, in which
land Nimrod the mighty one in the earth went hunting before the Lord, and by
the River of Babylon they sat down and wept, who were before the
Musitioners with their Harps; these went into captivity because of the sin,
and hanged their Harps upon the Willovves, and sat down mourning by the River
of confusion, and that which delighted in the Music caused the seed to be
captivated, and leads into bondage that which should come to liberty, whereby
sorrovv, weeping and mourning comes in the end; for the songs of the temple is
to be turned into howling and their delight in the music was turned into
weeping, and they led captive from Zion, who were come to the land of promise,
and there took liberty in these fleshly delights, Psalm 137. the mind that has
wisdom may read this.

And it was the King of Babylon, (who said is not this great Babylon that I
have built by the might of my power, for the honor of my Majesty) that set up
the golden image to be worshipped at the heaering of all kind of Music, and he
also was a great man in the earth, a great King, the King of Babylon, a mighty
one in confusion, who commanded the Magicians, the Astrologers, and Sorcerers,
and Caldeans, and ruled over them, and all them that dwelt in the earth; and he
sent greetings of peace to all people, nations and languages that dwell in all
the earth, but he that is the light comes not to send peace on the earth; and
the Angel cried woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth, but he that was
King over nations in the earth had many instruments of Music, even all kinds
of Music, and he that delighted in the music set up the golden image, and by
his command, they that heard the music were presently to fall down and worship
the great golden image, like the children of Israel who set up the golden Calf,
and these were Idolaters, and in the false worship, and that which delighted in
all kinds of Music was in the enmity to the righteous seed and sought to
murder them who denied the Music and false worship, and therein such appears
to be of Cain the Murderer, and of Lamech the manslayer, and these great ones
in the earth, who had all kinds of music were in Babylon and these were the
persecutors, (and such persecute now) whose rage was exceeding great against
the servants of the living God, who to him were faithful though in Babylon, and
regarded not their music neither feared their great threatening words nor yet
obey their strict commands, neither would they keep their decrees, nor take
much care to answer them tn that matter, nor bow before their image though made
with gold, nor worship any other God then he that dvvels in his people,
though they were in the land of captivity, among them in the land of
confusion, who at last were brought to confess unto, and fear and tremble
before the living God (who is light) that reveals secrets in the hearts.

But that which delights in the Music, seeks to murder the just, and unto
that which seeks to murder, and persecute all them who are yet great in the
earth, are joined (being not out of the earth redeemed) and the Rulers of the
earth take counsel together, against the anointed, which need not man to
teach, which seed is preserved and anointed, amongst the flames of their
burning enmity) for the Princes, the Governors, the Captains, the Judges, the
Rulers, the Counselors, the Sheriffs, and all the Rulers of the Provinces, who
were of Babylon, that delighted in the music, stood before the image, and were
in the false worship and joined together in the persecution, (as such do now)
against the seed of God, and to confirm the Decree made by the King of
Babylon, which Decree was made with such fierce Tyranny, and height of pride
and envy, that nothing less but presently to cast into the burning fiery
furnace, would satisfy that nature, which ruled in these great Rulers in the
earth, that loved the Music, whose fire of enmity burned within them, and they
caused their Decree to be Proclaimed with a loud voice, that at the hearing of
their music, all men should worship their Image, or presently be cast into
the fire without, because of their fire of enmity within, the which Decree
being not obeyed, nor their Image worshipped, nor their enmity within, nor
furnance without regarded by the servants of the living God, presently the King
of Babylon was so full of fury, as the furnace was full of fire, so that the
form of his visage was changed, and rose up in that power of enmity against
the righteous seed, like Cain the murderer; who rose up against his brother,
whose countenance also was changed, whereby it appears he and the rest were of
Cains seed, and the Musitioners of their father Jubal the seed of Lamech who
slew a man, read Dan. 3. When the Harp and the music go they must worship
the Image in the worlds figure.

And the persecuting Rulers of England, need not to put this far from them,
being rich and mighty in the earth, and envious like Cain, and delighting in
the music, like the rest of his seed, for the great Whore, and mother of
Harlots, and abominations of the earth, Mystery Babylon, have made all the
Kings of the earth drunk with the wine of her fornication, and the great men,
the rich men of the Earth, and all nations have committed fornication with her,
who have corrupted the earth, and all Nations wonders after the Beast, and in
all nations the seed, and children of Mystery Babylon, and of Cain and Lamech
are sprung up, and even in this nation, and other adjacent Kingdoms, the
Princes, the Governors, and Captains, the Judges the Treasurers, the
Counselors, the Shriefs, and the Rulers of the Provinces, delights in the
instruments of Music, and are envious against the righteous seed, who cannot
bow to any image, nor worship, any golden glorious image, or likeness
whatsoever, but the living God who is able to deliver them, and is a Spirit
dwelling in his people, and in spirit is worshipped by them who cannot bow
unto, or worship any image, or likeness without, set up by the will of man.

And therefore it is this day that the Governors, and Captains, the Judges,
the Treasurers, the Counselors, the Shriefs, the Justices, and all the Rulers
in the earth, who are of Babels stock, and of their Fathers, Cain, Lamech, and
Jubal, are joining together to pe^secute them that worship God in spirit, who
commanded not to bow down or worship any Image, or likeness, and so their
likenesses are denied, the substance being come, and Christ revealed within,
who is a man of Sorrows, who said the world should rejoice, John 16. 20. But
their joy should be turned into sorrow, and his light in the conscience is it
which judges those vain delights in carnal music, which is to perish with
the using.

For when the Spirit was departed from Saul, he sought for one to play upon a
Harp before him, and for a time he was satisfied with that, and when he heard
the music, he would be well, but afterward his delight in the music, could
not overcome that murdering spirit in him, but at the very time that Saul
heard the music, he sought to slay him that was to be King, and such as Saul,
who rejects the Counsel of God, slayes him that is the light* and would not
that he should Reign, who is a man of sorrows, and he that loved the music,
had an evil spirit, or something that troubled him, and that which moved in
him, while he heard the music, to murder that which was to Reign, (the Lords
Anointed) the same thing lead him to the Witch, and so first he left the
Spirit of God, then sought ease by music, then sought counsel from the Witch,
and he was shortly after destroyed, they follow witchcraft, who obey not the
Truth which makes free, and he that is the Light is the Truth, and the Lamb
slain, by that which takes delight in that, which is out of the Truth, invented
by the generation of Cain, a fugitive in the earth, of whom his deceived mother
said, I have gotten a man from the Lord, whose seed loves that which keeps from
the Lord, and leads into the Witchcraft (like Saul) not obeying the Lord, nor
the Truth of his Son* who is the Light, and Saul being required made use of the
Harp, to quiet him for a time, from whom the spirit of the Lord was departed,
and afterward the seed of the evil doers, even the chief of the Nations, did
chaunt to the sound of the vial, and invent unto themselves instruments of
music, (like David) putting far away the evil day, lying upon beds of Jvory
drinking wine in bowls, but not grieved for the afliction of the Righteous
seed, and these were them that were at ease in Sion, who were to go into
captivity with the first that go into captivity, whom the woe is to as may be
read, Amos. 6.

And Solomon's wives mensingers, women singers, and instruments of music,
drawed away his heart from the Lord, and after he cried against the vanity of
these things, for it leads out from the Spirit (and fear) of the God of order
within into the many confused things, without and such as follow that are of
Babel, the mother of Harlots, who have made all nations drunk, in whom the time
is come, that the voice of Harpers and Musitioners shall be heard no more at
all, for the foundation and Skirts of that great whore, and her Craftsmen, are
discovered with the Light, which judges these things.

Concerning Poets, Jesters, Rhimers, and all that wanton crew.
ALL ye Poets, Jesters, Rhimers, makers of Verses and Ballads, who bend your
wits to please novelties, light minds, who delights injests and toys, more
then in the simple naked truth which you should be united to, you are for the
undoing of many poor souls, it is your work to tickle up the ears of people
with your jests and toys; this proceeds from a wrong heart where dwells the
lust, and feeds the wrong heart and mind and wits, which brings them to the
grave and dust, and there buries the minds and clogs the nature, which is a
shame to all that be in the modesty and pure sincerity and truth and cleaness
of mind, therefore all you young wits learn not to make verses, for it is the
Ballad-makers trade and fiddlers road, and the scholars of Oxford and Cambridges
gain and learning, and lay aside all your learning of Logistical Arts, for
that brings you into and keeps you in the dark, but come to the naked
simplicity of truth that with that you may rule that a pure understanding you
may have, you think your selves witty when verses you can make and rhimes, and
this you learn in your Schools, like unto Ballad-makers, and when you have
gotten on your garment and coat of Lodgick, you think to deceive the hearts of
the people, but that is out of the path of Christ and his road and way that he
walked in, as you may read in the Scriptures of truth, you Jesters, and
Rhimers, and Logic inventers, which you deceive vain and light peoples minds
withal amongst whom you are called witty. But I shall tell you the Scholars of
Oxford and Cambridge, in your rhimes and in your jests in your verses and in
your Lodgick, it would be more pleasing to God for you to get a spade on your
backs, and a great old glove; and a bill in your hand, and stop gaps and make
up old hedges, and thresh out corn, and go amongst the day laboring men for 3.
d. a day, and this is more wholesome and this is a sweet savor, and burn all
your Logic books and verse books, ye scholars of Oxford and Cambridge, and
you Ballad-makers and Fiddlers, and Players and Mountebancks, who poisons the
world and poor people, but now are you discovered, and throw away your
inventions, for the rod of God and the power of truth is gone over you, and
stands a top of your heads, and with the wisdom of God you are comprehended,
and the wrath of God is come upon you all, and your swimming seen, and what you
swim in, with all your verses and your Logic, and your Ballads, and Rhimes,
both Ballad-makers and Mountebancks, and Scholars and Fiddlers, the ground of
your Scholistical Phrases and Verses, Rhymes and Jests, Verse makers,
Scholars, Fiddlers, Players and Mountebancks, are all from the witness of God
in you, and the Lord has a controversy with you, who will answer the witness
of God in you, by his power, by his sword, by his hand for all your inventions
and actions; Rhymes, Verses, Lodgick, is from the plain innocent witness of God
in you, which if ever it stir and be awakned in you, it will judge you for
your actions, for the terrible God is come to reign, and you have no place to
hide your selves, when every hailestone shall fall upon you the weight of a
Talent, this is in love to your souls.
