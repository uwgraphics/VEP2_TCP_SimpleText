SEASONABLE THOUGHTS IN PASSION-WEEK.

1. Cor. 9.22. I am made all things to all men, that I may save some.

Dr. Jam. Gardener.
Whoever a true Worshipper would be,
Was taught his Duty first by Poesy.

A Verse may find him, who a Sermon flies,
And turn Delight into a Sacrifice.

THE ARGUMENT.
Joh. 12.23.27. 1 Pet. 1.20. Matt. 26.45. Joh. 17.1. Acts. 4.28. Luke 22.22.
The Hour is come in which God long Designed
His only Son should die to save Mankind;
The Hour in which Heave'n Genesis 3.15.
openly Decreed
( On Adam's Grego.
happy Fall) the Woman's Seed
Should bruise the Serpents Head; that wondrous Hour
Both of the' Joh. 10.18.
Almighty's and the Luke 22 53.
Devil's Power,
Is come: Matt. 4. to 11. Luke 22.3.
the Devil assault's, then vanquished lies;
Isa. 53.7. Matt. 26.52, 53.54. Phil. 2.7, 8.
God-man Submit's awhile and silent dies;
Rom: 6.9, 10 Revel: 1.18.
But then does an Eternal Conque'rour rise.
SEASONABLE THOUGHTS IN PASSION-WEEK.
I.
It Is strange Chief Priests and Scribes such Fools should be
To Luke 22 2.
dread Man more than the Divinity!
Luk 19.47, 48 Mar: 11:18.
With some Pretense they Plot to kill the Heir;
Because they did the' admiring People fear;
Although their bloody close Hypocrisy
Heb. 4.13.
Lay naked unto God's All-seeing Eye.
So we, while worldly Int'erest does dissuade
From sin, unwillingly are honest made:
A Child does more our loosest Thoughts control
Than God, Genesis 1.26, 27
who made and can Mat. 10:28.
destroy the Soul.
II.
Mat. 26:15.
What will ye give? Judas, what Question's this?
Matt. 16:26.
What should man take for everlasting Bliss?
For Toys the Indi'ans give their common Gold;
But Thou, for Thirty Pieces, God have Sold:
Pagans, in such a fond Exchange, may be
Judged to act wisely, when compared with Thee.
With Cov'etous Hearts what cannot Silver do?
Christ it buys from them, and gets Heaven too.
III.
When the worlds Savi'our freely condescend's
Luk 22.14.
To make mean Fishermen his choicest Friends,
How can we without Joy and Wonder see
Such kind Compliance of Humility!
It cannot disgrace men in the Highest State,
The Son of God himself to Joh. 12.26, 13: 15. Matr. 11: 29
imitate:
Yet Mortals, as they rich and higher grow,
With Psalm. 73.6. Pro. 13: 23. Jam. 2.3.
Scornful Eyes look down on all below:
Luke 16.21, 22.
Dogs feed within, but Christi'ans at their Door;
As if we 'had better be Vn-man'd than Poor.
Pro. 14 20, 19 4.
We value men for what they do possess,
Act 20.35. Pro. 12.26.
But God esteems them most for Holiness.
IV.
Matt. 26.47.
A Murd'ering Band, O Judas! can thou Head,
And without trembling, Matt. 26.20.26.
take the Sacred Bread?
Life's Food, to thee, is into Poison cursed;
Eat it thou may; Mat. 27.3.
drink too; Repent and Act. 1.18. Mat. 27.5.
Burst;
And then in everlasting Burnings Thirst:
Luke 16.24.
To Abraham, in vain, for ever pray
For one cool Drop, thy Torments to allay.
Conscience, (awake at last) will make Thee own
Matt. 27.4.
'Twas I betrayed the Lord, 'twas I alone.
Damned Hypocrite! who did thy Wit employ
Job. 1 29. 1. Pet 1.19.
The Spetless Lawb of Ged for to destroy.
How did thou act two Parts to gain that end,
A real Traitor and a seeming Friend!
Yet be Apostle still; and teach us all
How to prevent our own by thy sad Fall;
Lest when we are raised to any higher Place,
Our Fall should be exposed to-more disgrace.
Teach us Luke 14.16, 17. 1 Cor. 5.8.
when Christ invite's us to his Feasts,
All way to come, and come 1 Cor. 11. 27, 28, 29.
prepared Guests;
With Souls from Cove'tous Thoughts and Malice free,
Still to receive the Holy Mystery.
From Thee we learn, when Sin gain's any Part,
Satan takes Courage to assault the Heart:
As when the outward Walls are beaten down
A Conqu'erour enters and destroy's the Town.
V.
Genesis 22.1.
Almighty God, when he resolved to prove
And signalize the Gal. 3.9.
Faithful Abra'ham's Love,
Obliged him (after all that he had done,)
To Genesis 22.2.
offer his beloved his only Son;
A Son, the sorrow at whose Death might be
Great as the Genesis 21.6, 7, 8.
Joy of his Nativity.
Genesis 22. from 3. to 10.
Yet Abra'ham God's, and Isa'ac Abra'ham's, will
In that severe Injunction, did fulfill:
And when a Savi'our, God from Heaven sent,
He proved his Love by his own Genesis 22.12.
Argument.
Heb. 11.17.
Abra'ham's Intent'ion was his Sacrifice;
But Christ's cannot be received unless he dies:
Yet he thus pay's the duty of a Son,
Luke 22.42.
O Father, not my will, but thine be done.
True Love does with the hardest Terms comply;
Making us pleased to live, and free to die:
Christ's Love bore all, until It overcame
A Isa. 53.3, 4.
Life of sorrow and a Heb. 12.2.
Death of Shame.
VI.
One Place (at diff'erent times) the Scene may be
Of great Unhappiness and Felicity:
Genesis 3.
Man, in the Garden, Heaven forfeited;
Ioh. 18.1. Mart. 26.36.
There, to regain it, L^k. 22.44. Act 20.28
God his Blood did shed:
Mut. 26 37.
There, first his Soul with sorrow was oppressed;
Ioh. 19.41, 42.
There, from his Toils, he in the Grave did rest.
In flowery Walks then we should meditate
On Adam's Sin, and on our Savio'ur's Fate:
In them (though we, 2 Kin. 21.15.
with Joseph, cannot have
Our Tomb) we may think daily on our Grave.
VII.
If deep Concern, to overloaded Eyes,
(Life's great Restorer) balmy sleep denies,
Sure Isa. 63.3.5.
God ordained none should Christ's Burden bear,
(That none the Glory of his Death might share)
Since all your Grief had not suffici'ent Powe'r,
To Matt. 26.38.40, 45.
keep your Eyes a wake for him one Hour.
The Hour is come; his Soul'^, with Grief oppressed;
Sleep on Disciples now, and take your Rest.
VIII.
To servent Pray'er how great an Enemy
Are Crowds of Busi'ness and of Company!
Well, therefore, are we' instructed what to do
By our Lord's Matt. 6 6.
Doctrine and his Luke 22.42.
Practice too:
When thou wou'd'st Pray, from all the world be gone,
And in thy Closet meet thy God alone;
Who number's Psalm. 56.8. Isa. 38.5.
every Tear and every secret Psalm. 38.9.102.20.
Groan.
IX.
See, how the Lord of Life Prepare's to die;
Luke 22.44.
Earnestly Praying in an Agony:
When sufferings approach by slow degrees,
It Is the best way to meet them on our Knees.
Sinners cannot show too deep Humility,
Psalm. 95.6.
Entreating, for Assistance, the most High:
In greatest Troubles God might be obeyed;
And they bear well that Humbly beg his Aid.
But sad's their State under God's heavy Hand
Who are too proud to Fall, too weak to Stand:
His angry Storms, their Stubborn Hearts confound;
But nobly spare what lie's upon the Ground.
X.
Mat. 26 47. Joh. 18.3.
In vain, O Judas! does thy Treason bring
Souldi'ers to lead thy Lord to Suffering:
Luke 2.15.
That heave'nly Host which did attend his Birth
Mat. 26.53.
He might command, for his Lifeguard on Earth:
Mat. 16.21.
But He will suffer; and have no Defense
More hurtful to thee than his Mat. 27.4.
Innocence:
Weaker than Jud. 15 14.
Samson's all thy Cords would prove,
Were He not held by stronger Hos. 11.4.
Bands of Love.
XI.
Cowardly Wretch! 'midst all thy Mat. 26 47.
Staves and Swords,
How do thou Joh. 18.6.
tremble at thy Master's Words!
A guilty Soul, like Adam's, make's thee fear,
When thou, Genesis 3.8, 9, 10.
God's Voice, do in the Garden hear.
XII.
Osten does Satan (by a wicked Heart)
To the worst use, the best of things pervert:
Mat. 26.48. Mar. 14 44.
That same is He, take him whom I shall kiss;
No sign Apostate! coud'st thou choose but This?
Doubly at once, thy Soul does guilty prove;
Traitor to God, and Traitor unto Love.
Did thou resolve to make all sure, by This
Most sacred Pledge of Mankind's chastest Bliss?
The less suspici'on it does still create,
With signs of Love, to ruin those we hate:
The wit of Woman Agrippina proved,
In pois'oning Claudius with the Meat he loved:
And, Henry the 7th Emperor.
next to Judas. Rome her Monk may boast,
Who Murdered Henry with the very Host.
XIII.
Mat. 26.36, 56.
Is this the boasted kindness to your Friend!
Is this remaining faithful to the End!
Pro. 17.17.
Love is most helpful in Adversity; Sam. 16.17.

They should not name it that forsake and fly.
Must we believe then such Professors ran?
Jer. 17.9.
What more deceitful than the Heart of Man!
False World! on thee no more will I depend;
No more expect in thee a constant Friend:
Trusting to thee is leaning on a Reed,
That let us us sink down in our greatest need.
XIV.
Dear Lord! one need not any Matt. 26.68
Prophet be
To tell the Man that Smote and wounded Thee;
Isa. 53.4, 5.
Thy Soul was grieved thy Body bruised by me.
For me did Thou put on Mortality,
And, for ungrateful me, did Bleed and Rom: 5.8.
die.
XV.
What braver Resolution could He make
Luk: 22 33.
Than, for his God, the world for to forsake?
Lord, may we always thus prepared be
To go to Prison and to Death with Thee;
It Is Glorious dying in such Company;
Rom: 8 17. 2 Timothy: 2.12.
For if we Suffer we shall Reign with Thee.
XVI.
A Woman may be Satan's Instrument;
But Man is weakest when he gives Consent.
When we behold Mat: 26.69. Luk: 22.54, 55, 56, 57.
Peter's inglori'ous Fall,
(Urged by a Damsel in the High-Priest's Hall,)
We see how vainly Man presum's to stand,
When Heaven deny's him a supporting Hand;
But when this does impow'r the smallest Stone,
1 Samuel: 17.45, 49.
A bold Goliath is, by It, ore'thrown.
Ephesians: 6.11, 12, 18.
It Is Prayer, not 1 Samuel: 17.8, 9, 10.
Boasting, that must arm the Soul,
And bravely Satan's fierce Assaults control.
Thoughts of our selves too great, of others small,
Are often forerunners of a dismal Fall.
Big things we talk when Danger's not in view;
But, as it shows it sell, our Fears renew.
How stoutly some take Castles in the Air,
Who poorly, at one real Siege, despair.
But when, Presumpti'on meets an overthrow,
By Peter's Fall his Courage was improved;
Who more denied his Lord? and who more Joh: 21.15. 16, 17, 18, 19.
loved?
XVII.
We often promise to our selves great Joy
Matt: 27, 3, 4, 5.
In things that most our inward Peace destroy:
Some seeming Pleasure Judas might obtain;
1 Timothy: 6.9.
But see the Bloody end of Bloody Gain!
Soon is his Money grown so troublesome,
He cast's it down; and does at once become
A witness, Judge, and Executioner;
And a base Death to' uneasy Life prefer.
So Judas closed his Treache'rous Villainy;
And so all Traitors do deserve to die.
On this unhappy wretch think all such Men,
As, for this World, would sell their Lord again:
The lightest ill-got Riches will appear
A Load to heavy for their Souls to bear.
XVIII.
Mat: 4. to 11. 2 Cor: 2.11.
By what delightful way's does Satan win
Our full consent to any damning Sin!
But when the Heb: 11.25. Joh 20.5.
short-lived Joys of Sin are past,
To Rom: 6.21. Dan. 12.2.
shame he leaves our guilty Souls at last.
We vainly throw the fault on Gen: 3.13,
Him and Gen: 3.12.
Men;
Mat: 7.4. Jam. 1.14.
Both rightly charge it on our selves again.
Lam: 3.29. Eze: 14.10.
And since we'are wicked by our own Consent
It Is just that we should bear the Punishment.
XIX.
No wonder that Chief-Priests and Scribes are bent
Luk: 23 10
So vehemently against the Innocent.
Joh. 8.44.
Like Children they their Father imitate,
Gen: 3. to 7.
Who ruined Man in his most perfect state.
The Devil most endeavors to destroy,
Matt: 3.16, 17. Matt. 4.1.
When we, Gods choicest Blessings, do enjoy.
Matt. 27.18.
Envy's that Canker-worm which still devour's
The ripest Fruit and feed's on fairest Flowers.
XX.
How powerful are the Charms of wordly Gain!
Joh. 19.13, 16.
I^ reconcile's Men unto every Reign:
A Monarch's Favor make's them Sentence give
Against the Just, and let the Guilty live.
They freely vio'late the most sacred Thing.
Condemn eve'n God, rather than 2 King: 5.1, 18.
lose the King.
If only such base methods recommend,
No honest Christian can be Caesar's Friend.
XXI.
Pilate, what Folly is it to Matt. 27.24.
wash, and then
-- 26.
Deliver up thy Lord to bloody Men?
1 John: 1.7.
Thy Soul might have been cleansed by his Blood,
Mat. 27.11.
Had thou cleared him, when he before thee stood:
Joh: 19.12, 13, 16.
But timorous Judge! now thou do wash in vain,
Seas cannot wipe off thy Soul, so deep a Stain.
XXII.
Mat. 27.25.
His Blood on Us, and on our Children rest;
What Tongue has a more heavy Curse expressed?
No Blood of Man was e're so loud before;
Luke 19.43, 44. Rom: 11.20, 21, 22.
Plagues it has called, and still it calls for more.
Unhappy Men! beyond Redress undone!
Without Col. 1.14. Heb. 9.12, 22.
Christ's Blood there is no Remission.
For you, Salvation what can now procure,
Who have done all to make Damnati'on sure,
Turning to Poison Heaven's only Cure?
XXIII.
How cheerful, Simon, should thy Looks appear
Luke 23.26.
When, with thy Savi'our, thou the Cross do bear?
Afflicti'ons surely cannot too heavy be
When God himself does share the Load with Thee;
Sufferings are lightened by good Company.
XXIV.
Complain not Simon, of a Load so light;
Our Lord Luke 22.44.
Sweat Blood under a greater weight:
To Joh. 19.17. Matt. 27.32.
carry on the Cross, but Part of the way
Is all the Burden Soldiers on thee lay;
But till our Lord through Life's last Scene has gone,
Our heavi'er Sins God makes him Isa. 53.4.
bear Isa. 63.3, 5.
alone.
XXV.
2 Samuel 1.24.
If Isra'els Daughter's mourned their mighty Saul,
1 Samuel 31.3, 4. 2 Cor. 5.14, 15.
(Who by Himself more than his Foes did fall)
How should we weep for him who Di'd for All.
Jer. 9.1. Psalm. 38.18.
O let our Eyes with pen'itent Tears or'eflow,
For all those Sins which brought him down so low;
From Heaven to E^rth, then to the Grave and Hell;
Matt. 26.38.
Filling his Soul with Grief unspeakable.
Tit. 1.16.
Since e'vry Sinner does his Lord deny,
Luke 22.62.
With peter too let all weep bitterly.
Such as neglect the present 2 Cor. 6.2.
Graci'ous State,
Shall be condemned to foolish Heb: 12.17.
Esau's Fate,
Seeking the Blessing when it was too late.
Matt. 5.4. Jam 4.9.
What Lents of Mourning then should Sinners keep,
Luke 13.28.
That they in Hell, in vain, may never weep.
XXVI.
Luk 23.33. Joh. 19.17.
See, how the Cross ascend's Mount Calvary;
In this All great Ones of the Earth may see
That, in their Height, secure they should not grow;
Since Troubles reach the High as well as low.
XXVII.
How long, O Lord, have I neglected Thee!
How long slipped every opportunity!
Yet now at last incline me to embrace
The tender offers of thy saving Grace:
And when I must lay down Mortality,
In thy great Mercy Luke 23.32, 40, 42, 43.
Lord remember me:
In that sad moment comfortably say,
Thy Soul shall be in Paradise to day,
But oh! how can I hope for to One
Of that bright Throng, which shall surround thy Throne,
When thou, dread Judge, have that great sentence given,
Which shall divide mankind 'twixt Hell and Heav'en?
What share in Bliss can one expect to have,
Who has not joined with Heaven himself to save?
I see my Sins in srightful Order set,
As they shall stand when all the world are met.
When awaked Consci'ence open's wide the Book,
I (covered all with shame) at every Look,
Behold (as well as Tears will let me see,)
In each full Page, my own Iniquity.
I see fair written with a Faithful Pen,
Sins against God, my self and other Men;
And then my Tears more strongly stream again.
Good God! how Mise'rable will be my Fate
Unless thy Mercy, as my Sins, be great?
Beyond all sad Examples is my Fall;
Thou have my Soul in Sin out done them all;
Yet think upon the pardoned Prodigal:
When he on bended knees confessed his Sin,
With Joy and Feasting he was taken in:
May I then ease my labou'ring Heart once more
With this soft Thought, that Mercy may restore
A thing so lost and so undone as I;
So, every way, involved in Misery:
Mercy! the Antidote against despair:
Mercy! the peni'tent Sinner's constant Prayer:
Mercy! the grateful Song of all the Blessed,
Who now, thr'o Mercy, are of Heaven possessed.
XXVIII.
How strangely, Lord, do thy great Suffe'rings make
Inani'mate Met. 27.51.
Rocks 'to rend and Earth to quake!
Yet it is more strange the Jews should not repent;
Their Eze. 11.19.36, 26.
Hearts of harder stone will not relent.
XXIX.
Has the 1 These 4.16. 1 Cor. 15.52.
Arch-Angel's Trump called up the Dead,
That many Saints forsake their quiet Bed?
It Is sure too soon; but, when their Savi'our dies,
As if they would make way for Him, Mat. 27.52,
they rise.
Graves Open, as if every one would have
Their Lord choose It, for his embalmed Grave:
And by their Bodies rising now in Haste,
1 These. 4.13 14.15, 16. Joh. 6.20.
They show what He will do for all at last.
XXX.
Is the World still a place of Grief and Pain,
To which the Saints do thus come back again?
It seems It is; they make so short a stay;
Just Mat. 27.53.
see their Friends and hasten then away:
(As if they came only to let us know
Rom: 8.10. Rev. 6.9, 10, 11.
Souls live above, whilst Bodies 1 These. 4.14.15.
sleep below:)
So rising Waves advance unto the Shore,
Salute, run back, and then are seen no more.
XXXI.
When, (from Luke 1.48.
A Blessed Mother's -- 1.35.
hallowed Womb,)
The infant Savi'our of the World was come,
Heaven, with a -- 2.9.
Glori'ous new created Ray,
Made Night more fair and cheerful than the day:
But, when he di'd, the -- 23.44, 45.
Sun withdrew his Light,
And day became more dismal than the Night.
XXXII.
Let no Man wonder at the Mourning Sun,
(As if the work of Nature were undone,)
When Its great God, Matt. 27.46.
the Brightness of his Face,
Vail's from his dearest Son in his disgrace.
Never before has he forsaken been;
Fclipse so full of wonder never was seen.
Kind Savio'ur! that would bear so strange a Night,
That we might live in an Joh. 8.12. Col 1.12.
eternal Light;
Enjoying still the 1 Cor: 13.14. Rev. 21.23, 24. Mat: 5.8.
Beatific Sight.
XXXIII.
Joh. 19.25. Luke 23 27, 49.
With flowing Eyes well might the Mother see
Her guiltless Son hang on the Deuteronomy. 21.22, 23. Gal. 3.13.
Cursed Tree;
From Her alone he took Mortality.
Had her too watchful Eyes but lost their sight,
When Mar. 15.33.
the whole Earth was overspread with Night,
The burden of her Grief had been more light.
If David when he saw his Absalem
2 Samuel 18.9, 10.14.15, 33. 2 Samuel 19.4.
To the sad close of a Rebellion come,
Did all his Joys and Royal Robes lay by,
And freely vent his Grief in Secrecy;
What Tongue of Man can speak? what Pen can write
This Mothers Luk 2.35.
great concern at such a sight?
Yet Grief may guess how by Joh. 19.25.
the Cross she stood,
Shedding her Tears as fast as Christ shed Blood:
Lamenting thus, art thou for ever gone?
O sweetest Jesus! O my Son, my Son!
Against the Jews she could not but complain,
Are all his Wonders, all his Cares in vain?
Did he in Love, Luke 19.41, 42.
weep for your suture state,
And does your Malice still fresh Grief create?
Will thou, unfortunate Jerusalem!
So kind a Lord to greater Pains condemn?
But unto you his Grief in vain I tell;
The very Mat. 27.52, 53.
dead are grown more sensible.
Yet cease at last; surely the worst is done:
O my dear Savio'ur! O my Son, my Son!
XXXIV.
See from the Cross how she attends his Hearse!
At every step new Grief her Heart does pierce.
And yet no weak distrust in her appears;
The Christi'an's Hope ore'come's the Mother's Fears.
Mar. 16.10. Luk: 23.55.
She weep's; look's on him lying dead like men;
She look's upon him, and she weep's again.
Yet she believ's a Joyful Morn will come,
When rising like a God, he shall deceive the Tomb:
So drooping Flow'ers, set in the ground in Rain,
With greater Glory soon spring up again.
XXXV.
Joh. 19.39, 40.
It Is kind, though needless, to embalm God's Son,
Act. 13.35, 37.
Whose Body cannot see Corrupti'on.
Death, cannot destroy One who, from death, can save;
And being Buried, He perfume's the Grave.
Yet to our Savio'ur such Offici'ous Love,
Sweeter than all your Spice, shall ever prove.
XXXVI.
Spend not, ye Jealous Priests! Matt: 27. from 62^0 End
your care in vain,
Mar. 8.31, 10, 34.
After three days, the Christ shall rise again.
Your wit cannot find, nor can your Malice have
Bonds more secure, or stronger than the Grave:
Death Act 2 24.
cannot hold him, and can Man's powe'r defer
One moment's rising from the Sepulcher?

Shall he do more for them than for his Own?
Cease then your vain Attempt; 'twill only prove

His Love that brought him from a Glori'ous State,
To Joh. 10.17.18.

In vain Mat: 17.64.

great the change of Grace;
A defiled Soul it makes an holy Place:
Our Magdalen, since God her Heart had turned,
With most refined flames has ever burned:
Luke 7.37.
Idols on Earth enjoyed too long her Love;
From that blessed Hour 'twas set on things above.
All Luke 8.7.
Devi'ls dislodged, as a more worthy Guest,
The Luke 7.44. 44, 45, 46, 47.
Lord she gladly took into her Breast.
Luke 7.38.
She wept and washed his Feet with joyful Tears,
Bowing her Head to wipe them with her Hairs;
Then, having kissed She did anoint his Feet;
With such kind Gratitude did his free Pardon meet!
Luke 8.1, 2, 3.

And entertained her waking Thoughts at Night.
Nor, with his Life, could her Affecti'on end,

Though night and Labor summon all to Sleep,
Love does her melting Eyelids waking keep:
Her Body no refreshing Slumber know's,
As if she too did watch her Lord's Repose.
To her how tedi'ous is the Mournful Night!
No colder Reg'ion long's so much for Light,
As her benighted Soul for dawning Day:
And though the Sun be early on his way,
It seems too long for his Approach to stay.

We see by This, and wonder when we see,
How generous and bold true Love can be.
Could David enter on Life's Stage again,
He 2 Samuel: 1.26. 1 Samuel 18.1.
would not praise so much the Love of Men;
His Jonathan's out done by Magdalen.
And since love come's with Mar: 16.1, 2.
Spices and with Speed,
Though her raised Lord can no embalming need,
He rate's her Will as highly as the Deed.
Luk: 7.13.
Her preci'ous Spikenard he did once receive;
Now it is enough she did design to give.
Lovers, like Gen: 29, 20, 30.
Jacob, purchase their delights
with many toilsome days and restless nights;
Yet think it great Reward for all they 've past,
To' enjoy the Object of their Love at last:
But Pro: 13, 14.
disappointment of their Hopes and care,
Sink's Sorrow down into a damned Despair.
How pleased had our great female Convert been,
Could she her Lord, though in the Tomb, have seen:
But Joh: 20.12.13.
Grief or'ewhelm's her at an empty Grave;
Missing that Lord who all her sins Luk: 7.4.
forgave.
In vain she asks Joh: 20.25.
where her dear Lord was Laid;
More by her Looks than all her words she said.
Her Tears with most persuasive Rheto'rick show
The'im pat'ient longing of her heart, to know
Where she the Joh: 20, 15.
pious Present might bestow.
But Joh: 20, 16.
hearing Christ, it cannot be expressed,
What mighty Passi'ons strove within her Breast,
Tokens of great Respect they Both conser;
Joh: 20.16.
She wellcome's Him to Life; He honor's Her.
Matt. 28.9. Joh: 20.17. 2 Kings 4.17.
His Feet with hasty Eagerness She kissed;
Matt. 28.10. Joh: 20.17. Mark 16.9.
And He makes her the first Evangelist.
Joh: 20.18.
This Office she performed and with her Love
Still followed him unto the Seats above.
When (Conqu'erour like,) Ephesians: 4 8.
He' Ascended up on high
And Captive bravely led Captivity,
The Best, though last, half of her days was giv'en
To him; on Earth she still conversed with Heav'en.
It Is Gratitude unto that To: 14.8.
God to live,
Who does our many Isa. 1.18.
scarlet Sins forgive.

How wonderfully did our Savi'our come,
From Luk: 23 53.
Death's and from Matt. 1.23, 25.
a Woman's sealed Womb!
Of Mary He was born to Psalm. 22.6, 7, 8. Isa: 53, 3. Heb: 12 1. Phil: 2 8, 9.
Grief and Scorn;
But, from the Dead, to Joy and Honor born.
1 Cor. 15.20. Col. 1.18.
Firstborn He was too for our Happiness,
Rom: 11.16. Lev. 23.10.
As the First Fruits succeeding Crops did bless.
'Twas fit so great a Person should obtain,
To Virgin-Places, Joh. 19.41.42.
where no Man had lain.
XXXX.
Of Angels, as of Men, sure Christ is Lord;
Such constant service they to him afford:
Luke 2.14.
Glory to God on high, and Peace on Earth,
Was their sweet Anthem at his wondrous Birth.
1 Pet. 4.11. 1 Cor. 10.31. Heb. 12.14.
(The same great ends may all our Acti'ons have,
Until our borrowed Dust Ecl. 12.7.
return's to the Grave.)
No sooner was his Glori'ous Combat past,
But, from above, Mat. 4.11.
they to his Aid did haste.
( Heb. 1.14. Psalm. 91.13.
Such powe'rful Guards his members still desend,
While with the Prince of Darkness they contend.)
When with an heavy load of Sin and Grief,
Luke 22 43.
He sunk, one swiftly flew to his Relief.
And when our Lord (after his Mat. 12.40.
three days sleep,
No longer his cold Bed of death would keep,
But) was resolved Mat. 28.1, 2, 3, 4.
to rise at the dawn of Day,
Another came and rolled the Stone away:
Like lightning bright his Countenance did grow;
And all his Raiment was as white as snow:
At his descending well might Souldi'ers shake,
When the Earth It self, on which they stood, did Quake.
So pale they grew, one might have thought them then,
Not the Grave's Keepers, but Its Guests, dead Men:
And when he saw the mighty work was done,
He sat in Triumph on the Conquered Stone.
