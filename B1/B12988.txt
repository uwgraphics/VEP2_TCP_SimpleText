DIEV ET MON DROIT

By the King. A Proclamation prohibiting the transportation of any Corn,
Grain, Victuals, Ordinance, Arms, or Munition for War, into the Kingdom
of France.
WHereas the differences between Us, and Our Brother the French King, have
been of later times, and at this present are so notorious, that neither Our
own Subjects, nor any our Allies and Confederates, can in any probability
pretend ignorance of them; And whereas Our said Brother of France, did publish
two several Declarations, the first of the fourteenth day of May, one thousand
six hundred twenty seven, the second of the twefth of August, one thousand
six hundred twenty seven, full of acrimony, wherein, amongst other things, all
Traffic and Commerce with Our Realm of England is prohibited, not only to
His own Subjects, but to all others of whatsoever quality, condition, or
Nation they be, under severe penalties, which not withstanding, yet We have
proceeded with such moderation, that hitherto We have not only forborne any
such publication, but have in a sort dispensed with such as have carried to Our
said Brother, and his Subjects, even Warlike provisions, and other the most
forbidden Commodities, hoping that this Our milden esse and facility, would
have produced better effects: But now, taking into Our Princely consideration
the manifold inconveniences which upon this liberty have ensued, and daily may
be multiplied, to the damage of Us and Our people, if the same should not be
prevented with a speedy restraint; And well knowing how agreeable it is to
reason, and the practice of all Princes and States, to hinder and divert the
transportation of all manner of Victuals, and Munitions of War, provided for
the aid and support of those, who at present are not in amity with Us, and
therefore are likely to employ them against Us and Our Kingdoms; We are
resolved to publish and notify, and by these presents, by the advice of Our
Privy Counsel, do publish and notify, that We will not henceforth permit
any person whatsoever, to send, or carry into the Realm of France, or any the
Countries and Dominions of the French King, any manner of Grain, or other
Victuals, or any manner of provisions, to serve to build, furnish, or arm any
Ships of War, or any kind of Munition for the War, or Materials for the
same, being not of the nature of mere Merchandise: And therefore, if any
person, either of Our own Subjects, or of Our Allies and Confederates, shall
after twenty days from the publication of these presents, by any of Our own
Ships, or the Ships of any Our Subjects, authorized under the great Seal of
the Admiraltie to that effect, be taken sailing toward the places aforesaid,
having on board any Ordinance, Arms of any sort, Powder, Shot, Match,
Brimstone, Copper, Iron, Cordage of any kinds, Hemp, Sail, Cables, Anchors,
Masts, Rafters, Boat-oares, Capraues, Clapboard, Pipestaues, Vessels, Pitch,
Tar, Rosin. Okam, Corn, Grain, or Victuals of any sort, or any provisions
for shipping, or Munitions for War, or returning thence in the same Voyage
with the proceed of the said prohibited goods; We shall hold the said Ships
and Goods so taken for lawful Prize, and cause them to be ordered as Ships
and Goods duly forfeited for the benefit of Our selves, where Our own Ships
shall arrest the same, and to the benefit of such others as being not in Our
wages, but otherwise authorized under the great Seal of Our Admiraltie, as is
aforesaid, by Letters of Marque, have stayed and arrested the same.

Given at Our Court at White Hall the fifteenth day of October, in the fourth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXVIII.
