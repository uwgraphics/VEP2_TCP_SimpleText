Courant News out of Italy, Germany, Bohemia, Poland, etc.
From Room the 5. of Iunij, 1621.
THe Prince of Conde has sent in the Church of Santa Loreta / a Forteresse of
Silver broad four hands / wherewithal he has fulfilled his vows done in the
Bastilles.

Thurs^aye last the Pope has solemnly knighted the Lords Iustiane / Anthony
Girmany and Reynir Zino Ambassadors of Venize / and granted to every one a
chain of Gold / whereupon they departed.

The Pope during the Germane wars should mainetayne for the Emperors
Majesty 3000. Footmenne and 1000. Horsmenne / and besides give a contribution
of 50. thausand Crowns monthly.

From Venize the 11. hereof.
They of the City of Berne have saccaged a abbey / in the Land of the
Grab^nders or Grizons / and have killed many of the Catholics / whereupon
Leopolds men being 6000. did fall in / and those of Be^^ne were driven backwart
to the City of Chur. Because of this sedition the Gover^o^r of Milan have
sent 2000. Soldiors in the Forteress o^ Veltolin / but the Vene^ians have
hi^dered unto them the Pass / but afterward passed by force / whereupon many
were slain / and the deliueringe of Deltoline is also hindered / because the
Pope is very angry for the Said Saccaginge. In mean time the Archiducke
Leopoldus near to Deltkerckan and Lindaw the Bounds of Helvetia caused to be
made two skonses.

From Constantinople is signifyet the Great Turk journey with many Basses and
other Lords toward Adrianopoli / where the Turks make assembly of two Armeys
/ the one of 150. thausand men the Great Turk should conveye thoroug the
Valachie into Poland / the other of 100. thausand men should take his way
toward the Moldaw / and the remanninge part should defend the Pounds of
Hungaria against the force of the Christians. In mean time the King of Poland
(well provided and armed) should have slain the Tartarians / and the Cosackes
likewise saccaged the City of Travisuntium / and threathned with 300. She^s
to go for Constantinople / but many ships well armed with pieces of Ordinance
are sent against them.

In Vienna the 10. hereof.
Notwithstanding that Stensel Thurso has been in treatise with the Count of
Bucquoy / the Hungarians never thelesse in Neuheusel would by no means yealde
or consent / but have threathned rather to deface the said Thurso / then to
deliver themselves / and therefore this week many pieces of Ordinance and
munition is conveyed thither / to constrain it with Shoting: Likewise are
thither sent 600000. Florines / and 200000. Florines in Jewels / to pay to
our Soldiers 3. months of wages. In mean time the Hungarians are continually
in skirmigges with ours / and Betlem Gabor should fortifye himself at Cassau
to succor and deliver Neuheusel / but the Lord Setschi should hinder unto him
the Passage.

On this part the Earl Colaldo has taken the goods of Budany out of the
invincible Castle of gissingen / and has gotten a great quantity of corn and
wine and he proceeds now forward to Papa and the Cauish Bounds.

In Moravia some notable Lords and Citizens are again emprizoned / with whom
the Execution / as likewise with them of Prague / should be advaunced this
week / and Erasmus and Geordge of Landaw schould be as Prisoners with the
first conveyed to this City.

From Prage the 10. hereof.
The 7. of this month / the old Martin Fauwijn / one of the prisoned
Directors / leaped from the higest of the white tower into the Moatt and dyed
presently / his body is yesterdaye quartered / and brought upon the high ways
/ but ^is Head and right hand is fastened upon the gallows in the New town /
they say the Execution of the other Prisoners should be done upon Mourdaye or
Tuesdaye next.

Because the men of war are dismissed into Slesia / therefore from hence
some Captains are sent thither with money for the states of Bohemia to have
yet a whole Regiment for the Emp. Maj. But they say that the Marckgrave of
Iagerendorp likewise conscribeth of the same men / with whom are joined the
iounger Earl of Thurne / the Superior Scheretin Stabenbol and others. The
City of Tabor keeps yet / skirmishing daily with their ennemies / keeping no
quarter on both sides / but al Soldi^rs that are taken were presently hangde.
The Superior Frenck is hier also.

The Emperors journey hither / should be upon the 5. of July and the
Electorial day at Regenspurgh the 1 of September.

The Peasants of Bokemia / that have joined them (whereof is rehearsed in
former time) increase daily more and more.

The Colonnel of Wallensteen / was well sent against them to slaye them / but
findinge himself to weak / is returned home without any effect.

The Earls of Mansvelt has conscribed so many of the demissed men of the
Unions Princes / that he has now a Armey of fifteen thausand men / what he
schall effectuate with the same / shall appear hereafter.

From Vienna the 12. of Iuny.
The Emperors Majesty has given a Bancquet these oad days in the Court unto
the Ambassadors of the King of Denmarcke / and entertained them through the
Superior the Earl of Vorstenbergh

The Earl Colaldo is with his men near Loment / and his matters do not
proceed well / because the Budian fortifyth himself more and more / and
expected yet 3000. men / and undertaketh like wise to diverte some Spanschaps
of the Emperor / and because the Earl is weak of Horsmenne / Bucqu^y has
sent unto him some more / and the like should be done from Stiria. At Crems
have a congregation of the 7. free Berghtownes / and sent their Ambassadors to
the Earl of Bucquoy and the Palatino / and delivered theyrselves in the
protection of the Emperial Majesty / as likewise has delivered them
Coninckgrade and other limits or Bounds. And at Brin and Olmits 20. Lords of
Moravia are arrested again.

From Opper-Palts the 15. of Iuny.
The men of the Duke of Weymaren are already arrived in the Army of the Earl
of Mansfelt. The Horsmenne with some Company of Footmenne are near the Bohemian
Bounds or limits / near unto Tachau and Drouwenberg / and the Horsmenne of the
Marcgrave Sigismundus are daily expected / so that the Earl of Man's felt
increases in great strength / and conscribed yet 2. Regiments of Footmenne /
we expecte whither it shall be directed.

And there is a strong mutual Bond and Confederation betwixt the King of
Bohemia / Dennemarcke / Sweden / Lowsaxonie and the Low Confederated lands
erected and confirmed / so that it appears that the war shall rise on al
parts. The Duke of Bavari^ formed his men of war at 5. Monsterplaces / and
taking in hand the Execution against these lands / he shall find perhaps
resistaunce enough.

From Franckfoort the 20 of Iuny.
Concerning the matter of wars in the Palts / prolongation is taken until
the 30. of this month. The Spaniars under the commandment of Don Consaluo de
Cordua beginue to run away apace / and many pass daily throug Heydelbergh /
where Letters of passage are granted unto them / to pass thoroug the Country
without any disturbaunce or hinderaunce / many likewise dye for hunger and want
/ so that the Spanish host mightly deceaseth and affoyblisched in number.

From the Grizons 1621.
Monsieur Montalon / has desired and required in his Proposition / that the
Grisons should never make any more correspondence / freendship / consederation
or leagues with any Princes / and specially not with the Republike of Venetia.

Has required likewise of the 5. places / and of the City of Zurich that
they should call bakward their men of war / which the 5. places have
consented and yealded / and a great part of them come homward.

Zurich has answered / that when the Archiducke Leopoldus should take his
men of war from the limits / and the King of Spain should delivered
again unto the Grizons the Veltoline / that then they are ready to further
bakward their Regiment.

In the Palts the 17. of Iuny.
The General Veer / traveleth up and down in the Palts to Visit the troops /
and caused likewise the Rhyn-bridge at Manheym to be demolished / but as it is
refered / with no other consideration but that the Sulpenlio Armorum should
inviolably be keept / will not permit nevertheless that the Spaniards
should exact and require any coutribution of the subjects / because they could
not maintain it when Spinola was with them. It seems that the Spaniards have
no great mind to remain any longer / because it is al wasted and consumed in
their quarters / and no Prices are more to be had.

Of the departinge nevertheless of the Spaniards is no news yet / in mean
time the country men are miserably vexed / a nd upon the Limits they
begin to offend one a other which perhaps shall cause greater troubles.

It is signified hier that the Marquis Spinola should proceed in the Field the
25 of this month / h auinge warned and conscribed against that time al his
Commanders / Superiors and force of men.

From Culen the 17. dito.
The Fortification of Wesel is advaunced more and more / a nd the Earl Henry
vanden Berg is expected there with the horsmenne: they have undertaken likewise
to fortifye the City of Rhijnberck.

The Spanish Garrison in the land of Gulick has received as yet no money / but
they hope shortly to get it.

At Herentals and some other places the Garrisons began to murmr / but it is
^anifested / and many are apprehended / who are in great danger and trouble /
many likewise arunfled.

The Duke of Nieuburgh is at this time at Dusseldorp.
