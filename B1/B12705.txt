By the King.
Orders for through Posts, and Curriers, riding in Post in our affairs.
THe Lords of the privy Counsel endeavoring heretofore the like furtherance
of the service of the State, as well in horsing such as ride on their Princes
affairs, as the speedy dispatch of Packets in all places, where Posts were
erected and ordained, considering, that for the service of the one, a daily fee
is allowed, and for the other no certain wages at all, but the hire of the
Horses let out, and that often ill paid, whereby they stand not so bound to the
one, as to attend the other: And that the Towns and Countries besides became
many ways vexed and perplexed, by the over great liberty of Riders in Post,
specially by such as pretend public service by special Commission, contrary
to the Kings meaning or their Lordships orders: Who minding nothing more, then
the particular good of his Servants and Subjects: for the benefit of the one,
relief of the other, and more regard to the good usage of all Owners of
Horses, and the beasts themselves, did think it expedient, to digest and set
down sundry necessary Orders indifferent for all parties to observe and
follow. Which Orders being by us reuiewed and considered, are now according to
the necessity of the times, thought meet to be eftsoon allowed and
published. The execution whereof we seriously recommending to the Master and
Controller of all our Posts, for the better warranting and directing of Posts,
so far as this service may concern them, We do hereby straightly charge and
command, all and every Lieutenants of Shires, deputy Lieutenants. Justices of
all Assizes and Peace, Sherifes, Majors, Bailifes, Constables, Headborowes, and
all other his Officers, Ministers, and loving Subjects, to be ayding and
assisting to the same, with their utmost help, authority and countenance
where need shall require, as they tender the furtherance of the service of the
State, and our displeasure.

1 First it is ordered, That in all places where Posts are laid for the
Packet, they also as persons most fit, shall have the benefit and pre-eminence
of letting, furnishing and appointing of Horses to all riding in Post, (that
is to say) with Horn and Guide by Commission or otherwise, And to that end
shall keep, and entertain of their own, or have in a readiness under their
direction, such and so many able and sufficient Post horses, with convenient
furniture, as their own abilities will bear, or that the contributarie
provision of the Towns and Countries shall enable them unto, or afford. And if
it fall out that Curriers or Through Posts, riding in our affairs by special
Commission come so thick, or in such numbers, that their ordinary provision
will not suffice, then the Constables of the places where they dwell, with the
assistance of the chief Magistrates there, and of the Countries adjoining,
(being required in our name) shall take up, bring in, and supply the Posts with
Horses where they may be had or hired.

2 And like as in the Orders for the carrying of the Packets, the furtherance
of our service and the State, is only aimed at, so in this it is intended,
that none be holden to ride on public affairs, but with special Commission,
and the same signed either by one of our principal Secretaries of State, or
six at the least of our privy Counsel, or the Master and Comptrowler
general of the Posts, for all iourneys outward, and from the Court only. And
to the Court, the Lords of the privy Counsel of Scotland, any Lieutenant,
Deputy or Governors in Ireland, the Presidents of Counsels, or Vicepresidents
established in the North, or in the Marches of Wales, the Governor of
Barwicke, Any Ambassador, Governors of Towns, or Agents beyond the Seas, The
Warden of the Cinque Ports, or his Lieutenant of Dover, specially sending to
the Court, to the body of the Counsel, or Secretaries of State, or any Packet
so directed, that it may appear, the party dispatched therewith, rides in
our special affairs, (the Ambassadors of foreign Princes within this our
Realm, and the ordinary Posts for France and Flanders allowed, and by their
badges sufficiently commissionated, excepted) and of all such so riding in
public affairs, it shall be lawful for the Posts, or the Owners of the
Horses to demand for the hire of each Horse after the rate of two pence
halfepeny the mile, (besides the Guides groats.) But of all others riding post
with Horn and Guide, about their private businesses, the hire and prices are
left to the parties discretions to agree and compound within themselves.

3 It shall not be lawful for any person whatsoever riding in post by Commission
or otherwise, to take and ride away the Horse or Horses of any man, Post or
other, not having first and aforehand fully paid and satisfied for the price
and hire unto the Owners or the Post for them, nor ride them further then the
next immediate Stage without changing, without the knowledge and consent of the
Post of the Stage, by whom he rides in post, nor charge any horse so taken to
ride in post with any Male, or burden, (besides his Rider) that exceeds the
weight of thirty pounds: Neither shall any man so riding in post, offer to
ride any man's Horse above seven miles the hour in Summer viz. From the first
of April, till the last of September, nor above six in Winter, which shall be
accounted the rest of the year: And if any shall wilfully disobey herein or in
any point hereof to the manifest hurt or hinderance of the Horse or his Owner,
The Officers and Magistrates of the place upon complaint made, shall stay the
parties offending until they have given present satisfaction, or sufficient
security to repay the damage.

4 Finally, as it is only intended that our service in this kind, be at all
hands furthered, and the Posts to that end, in all their wants and wrongs to
right themselves by the help and authority of the Magistrates, Towns and
Countries as abouesayd: So if the service shall seem unto any Post a burden
over great for his private state to bear and undertake, and the Towns and
Countries (notwithstanding the ease and quiet they reap thereby) no way
willing to countenance, encourage or enable him thereto: or otherwise in regard
of years or indisposition, shall not see reason to underly the charge, and
trouble of the service, as being a hinderance to his special duty in the
service of the Packet: The Post in such case attending his peculiar charge, the
Constables, and Magistrates of the places shall take order from time to time,
that Horses be provided for all riding in post by Commission, or specially
sent in our affairs as beforesaid, in such sort as they were subject to do
before there were any Posts there, and as in places where are yet no standing
Posts at all. Unto whom also our pleasure is, that these Orders shall be in
force, and available (being delivered them from the Master and Comptroller of
the Posts) so far as they, and any branch of them may concern the
furtherance of public service, or their own relief.

God save the King.

Majesty. Anno 1603.
