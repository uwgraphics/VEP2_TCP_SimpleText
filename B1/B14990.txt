Courant out of Italy, Germany, etc.
From Room the 6. of March, 1621.
ON Sunday last / the Pope is gone to Vaticano in the Chapels / being
accompanied with all the Ambassadors / Prelates and other Nobles there present.

It is understood from Naples that there are 3000 men taken on / to be used
upon the Catholic Army.

From Venize the 12. hereof.
News from Thurino mentions that in Piemont are put 2000 horsemen and 6000
foot men / whereby it is thought that the Duke of Savoy has some special
matters in hand / it is also understood from Schweits / that the French
Ambassador is very ill content concerning the Capitulatie / which the Liga
Grisa had made with the Governor of Milan / to the great hindrance of his King
and the Graubaunderen.

Advise from Constantinopel mentions that the setting forwards of the Great
Turk was published / and that in the end of Februarij last past the whole
Armey of three hundred thousand men should come together at Adrianopel: And
that the Cosackes gathered together with a very great Power to march against
the Turks.

From Vienna the 17. of Martij.
The Ambassador of Polen would leuy 20. thousand me^ in Germany / whereunto
the Emperor has consented / but they will be hardly raised / never the less
the Earl of Altheim has given many Comissions out already. The Cosackes last
mentioned / which could not get through to go homewards / because of the
Hungarians / have lost above 1000. horses by Scalihits and all there booty is
taken from them / so that the rest of them retired this ways again.

The handeling of Peace at Haimburg continues yet / and there is another
Prolongation made until the 25. of this month. The Budiani and other Hungarian
Lords do seek for mercy at the Emperors hands / and wear gladly set free
from Betlem Gabor / and they long much to see the Emperors Armey to fall into
Hungary / whereby they might the more conveniently put themselves under the
Emperor.

The 12 hereof has Betlem beset the City of Presburg and the Castle with
6000 Hungarians / likewise planted many Turks and Tartarians on the other side
of the Donaw. The said Betlem has done an attempt upon Theben / but to no
effect / he has in like manner given order to fortify the Hungarian Altenburg
and Presburg.

Although Bethlem Gabors Chaunsellor is gone to Thyrna with secret resolutions
to have them ratifyed / yet it seems that Bethlem Gabor does fear that his
Chanssellor might go in any danger to Haimburg / so long as the French
Ambassador does not assure that he shall com to Presburg again without danger.

At Haimburg is a Spy from Savoy / and he is taken and imprisoned / who killed
himself there / the next day a Hungarian was taken / who was determined to do
great matters against the Emperor the City of Vienna and the Earl of
Bucquoy / it seems the Emperor is minded to go from hence to Graets / where
he means to Create / and, make the old Prince Governor there.

From Prage the 16. hereof.
The last Friday some certain pieces of Ordenaunce wear carried from hence
into the Saltzer ^raits / toward Ellenbogen / which shall be employed against
the Earl of Mansvelt / who mustere 2. Regiments by Nieustattel and there
resorted to him daily many Folk / there with he has some special Enterprise
in hand.

On Sunday last arrived here the Deputies or Lords Commissioners from Vienna /
and they first take in hand the cause / concerning the arrested persons / so
that it is to be feared that it will cost some there heads here and at Vienna.

Yesterday is brought hither the Lord of Harranck / the which has been the
Chamber President of the Bohemians in those rumors / and put in strong
imprisonment.

From Breslaw the 11. of March.
Our Commissioners are arived here yesterday from Dresden with good
contentment / namely that the Duke Elector of Saxens dealing with the Emper.
Maj. and these Lands stood upon a good peace / and that at this present it
stands but upon the ratification of both sides / though Betlem Gabor threatens
/ that if they do fall from the Conferation / he will plague them with fire
and sword / never the less it is hooped that the Soldiers shall be casseerd
of both sides / by reason the Poole is to be feared / who is much threatened of
the Turk / like as advise comes / that the Turks have roved with in 6.
leagues of Cracou / pilladging and burning all away / and taken many thousand
people prisoners.

It stands also very badly with Moravia / for here is com certain news /
that Betlem Gabor has sent 20 thousand Hungarians / Turks and Tarters over the
Wittenberg / and many thousands follow / who spare no man with stealing and
burning all away.

From Lemburg in Silesia the 18. hereof.
Here it is said that the Marcgrave of Iagersdorp is marched with 7000. men to
the news: where the Moravish? Camp under the Earl of Turn shall meet him / so
is likewise said that the Earl of Mansvelt has slain upon the Fronters of
Bohemiae 1000. of the Duke of Saxens Folk.

From Lints the 18. hereof.
It is now wholly decreed / that the States of this Land shall pay every month
those that lay in Garrisson 34000. Florins of the which every hearth place in
the Country shall pay 24 Creyrser / and in the Towns 29 Creytser every month.

From the Palati: the 19. hereof.
The Marckgrave of. Ansbach and Duke of Wirtenberg are in hand with the
Landgrave of Darmstadt / like as they 2. days since we are all together at
Wicheym / and for this present at Heydelverg / God give that some good may be
effected.

This dan has Spinola laid his Shipbridge again over the Rijne at Oppenheym.

The Letters of Dansick mention / that the Turkish Emperor has sent this
fearful letter hear following:

A disdaynfull Letter, written by the Turkish Emperor to the King of Polen.
We Mahomet Suldan / Illustruous and Unconquerable Emperor and Angel of God /
Turkish Emperor / Macedonian and Babilonian King / in great and small Egypt /
Ruler of whole Christendom and Europe / King in Alexandrja and Judah / in like
manner of Portugal / and over all the Potentates upon the Earth / also a Lord
of Lords over all Lords / keeper of the Heathens Parradijs / and the Holy
Graves / as well of the great Prophet Mahomet at Mecha / as the worthy Prophet
at Jerusalem / King of all Kings / Lord of all Lords / Prince of all Princes
/ Lord of all Gods upon the Earth / Lord of the Trce of lyff / of all Towns
and Castles / Lord of the great and small Sea / Lord of all Havens and Ryvers /
Lord of all Streams on the whole World / the great Governor above all
Governors of Towns.

Do send unto thee King of Poland our Emperourlike greetinge / for that thou
with thy little King in thy secret Council for thy own partilar profit do
take in hand / to stryve against our Illustrius person / and most powrefull
King / and we do wonder that thou do not fear our great might / and thy
own death with thy little King / considdering that thou in former time did
seek peace with us / and there upon sent thy Ambassadors often / whom did
assure us thy desire of quyetnes / and that thou would not have any ill
thought to do any thing to the contrary / and yet thou have taken upon thee
not only in our Government / but also in Mnscou to fall upon our Vassalls /
and determined with thy self utterly to spoil the^: Like as many places are
destroyed / taken in / and spoiled. So that thou shall know / do what thou
can / we will be revenged one thee and thy little Kings with whom thou have
conquered the same / and meanest to set them in Government / And not only be
revendged / but pursew thee to the uttermost / to blot out the remembrance of
thy name / and because thou shall know what more revenge thou have urged us to
/ is only by reason / that thou have broken the Leagne betwixt us / disdayned
and abused the same / and therefore assure thy self with thy little Kings to be
brought before us / and thou shall see with what power from all the places of
the World that shall come to me / how I will overrun thee / and use thee with
thy prisoners so cruelly as may be / therefore henceforwardes thou need not
to hope of any mercy at our hands / and that we are not a frayd of thy strong
places / or for thy strong Walls at Cracou / for we will not only fall upon
that town and likewise thy court / but also thy Camp and whole Land / and so
spoyleand ruinate them / that not one stoue shall remain upod another / also
root out the remembrance of thee and thy Kingdom.

In witness or taken hereof we send thee hear with our blodye Sable / for that
it shall speedly be followed by as / and then we will so cover thy Land with
horse troops / foot Companies and Cammels / that like in many years has not
been seen. Only that Gods wrach through us / may be laid upon thee / for God is
an upholder of the good / and a punisher of evell and peacebrekers / and like
as we are unto the a God upon Earth / so we do shake out our rod and anger
against thee / only to punish thy false breaking of Truce.

Let now thy Gods come to help thee / if they will / nevertheless it shall not
help thee / thy Holyons we will assuredly put to the Plough / and so make
them to plough the void Lands of Bulgaria and Judea / where they shallbe so
planted / that none shall return back again / and therefore conteut thy self
hear with our meaning as aforesaid.

All this we have thought good to let thee know our displeasure / from
Constantinople / in the year of our Rain / etc.

His Majesty of Denmark causes many Soldiers daily to be raised. In like
manner does the King of Sweden.
