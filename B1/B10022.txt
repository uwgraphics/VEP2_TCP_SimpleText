St. George for England, And St. Dennis for France,
O honey soite qui maly pance,
To an excellent new tune,
St George, on horseback, slays a dragon

What need we brag or bost at a^l,
of Arthur or his Knights,
Knowing how many valiant men,
they have subdued in fights.
For bold Sir Lancelot-Du-Lake,
was of the Table round,
And fighting for a Ladies sake,
his sword with faim was Crowned,
For Tarquin that great Giant,
his vassale did remain.

O honey soite qui maly pance.
We read of Alexander,
the Conqueror of all.
Who did subdue this mighty world;
Incompassing the ball,
He was both King of Sea and Land,
and did all honor keep,
But hearing of no other world,
it made him for to weep.
He conquered Turks and infidels,
the Pagan, Jewe and Dane.
But St. George, etc,
^en^des great Julius Ceaser,
did reign a potent Lord,
By conquering Crowns and Kingdoms,
he put them to the sword:
His name in ancient Chronicles:
declares his enterprise,
And how he won the glory still,
from all his enemies.
Where Troops of horse and Armed men,
his Captains did remain,
But St. George, etc.
You have heard of mighty Tamberlain,
who with his fatal blows,
D^d over top great Princes,
and made foot-balls of three Crowns,
For being thus exalted,
upon a Kingly Throne,
He bore the Scepter of the world,
and none but he alone.
For Kings did draw his Chariot,
who did his slaves remain.
But St, George, etc.
Great Ajax, and stout Hector,
did combat by the day.
And rushing in the Armies still,
their bloody swords made way.
The Greeks and Trojans went to wrack
by their courageous force,
For Hector in the heat of blood.

When Hector took his last good night,
then Troy was quickly taken,

two knights in armor fight with swords

AChillis for a Ladies sake,
went to the wars of Troy,
But there by Paris he was slain,
King Priams lovely boy.
For with a fierce and fiery dart,
composed all of steel,
Young Paris killed Achillis there,
by darting through his heel.
The Greecians for their General,
did very much complain.
But St. George, St. George,
the Dragon he has slain,
St. George he was for England,
St. Dennis was for France,
O honey soite qui maly pance,
Twelve labors was by Hercules,
performed with courage stout
Who traveled round about the world,
to find his Mistress out,
He made grim Pluto tremble,
and Cerberus quake for fear;
And to great Atlas King of Wi^s,
he did the Standerd bear,
Yet Hercules by his own Muse,
did suffer mortal pain,
But St. George. etc.
The Noble Earl of Warwick,
great Giants did subdu
In honor of his Phillis sake,
his King and Country to.
A Savage Bore by him was killed
whom he left void of breath.
Besides the brutish Dun Cow,
the Devil of Dunsmoore Heath,
And Beevis of South hamhton,
put Dragons to much pair,
But St. George, etc.
Make Anthony I Will warrant you,

Sir Eaglemore that valiant Knight,
the like was never seen.
grim Gorgous might was known in fight
and Orson most men frighted,
The Mermadons and Prestor John,
deserbed to be knighted,
Brave Spaniola, (took in Breda,
the general of Spain,
But St. George, meet the Dragon,
and turned him over and over again.
St David for great honor,
in Foreign Lands did seek,
Which makes the Welsh for memory,
to wear a famous Leeke.
St Patrick too in Ireland,
all venum did expel,
For which a red Rose they did wear,
as stories true does tell,
St. Andrew for cold Scotland,
a Champion did remain,
But St. George, etc.
Next Anthony for Italy,
a Captain stout and bold,
With James of Spain did venture,
to find the Indian gold,
They overthrew the Pagans Gods.

And for the fame of Christendom,
most stoutly they did stand,
St Dennis was as brave a soul,
as any of the train.
But St, George, St. George,
the Dragon he has slain.
