The two Lester-sheire Lovers.
To the tune of, and yet my thinks I love thee.




VValking In a meadow green,
for recreation sake,
To drive away some sad thoughts
which sorrofull did me make,
I spyed two lonely lovers,
did bear each others woe.
To point a place of meeting,
upon the meddow bro.
Saying come my lovely sweeting,
com at thee down by me.
It is a merry meeting
if we two can agree.
If we two can agree,
to this I thee do woe,
That thou should only meet me:
upon the meddow browe.
My Father is a gentleman,
my Mother loves me dear:
She has given me a newetie,
of twenty pound a year,
And I have spent it all.
nay more I will spend toe
So thou will grant to meet me,
upon the meddow broe.
My Master has forwarnd me,
out of thy company,
And oftentimes has chid me:
for staying so long with thee,
For staying so long with thee,
but I will stay the more:
So thou will grant to meet me,
upon the meddow broe.
Sweet heart quoth she I cannot,
for opertunitie:
A thing I cannot accomplish,
our meetng does deny
Else shoulds thou me commend:
to ride to run or go:
Were it not so I Would meet thee,
upon the meddow bro.
Sweet heart quoth he who fear you,
or who dares do thee wrong,
Do fear thy masters Heavy hand:
or mistress nimble tongue,
Do fear the tell tale servants
but let such matters go.
And prithe sweeting meet me,
upon the meddow bro.
Quoth she you do mistake sir,
it is no such thing I fear,
Therefore to urge it farther:
I do entreat forbear,
I do not greatly care,
for ought that they can do.
Annother thing does hinder me,
to meet on meddow bro.
What should the occasion then be,
O thou should be so presise,
^r what is it should cause thee:
in love to be unwise.
Most thou my love despise,
or would thou love forgo,
I pray thee sweeting meet me,
upon the meddow bro.
The Second Part.




I Tell thee gentle sweeting,
Queen Venus never run:
So swift after Adonis.
as I to thee would come,
Queen Dina in her shower of gould;
did not so willing do,
As I would be to meet thee.
upon the meddow bro,
Qouth he as did Dame Venus*
would thou of me make trial,
I would not like Adonis,
so fondly give denial.
No for thy sake my sweeting,
all ill I under go.
So thou would grant to met me,
upon the meddow bro.
Sir since I see you are loving,
i will tell to you the cause,
You know both maids and young men
live under countries laws.
And should we be but spied,
we should have men enough:
Where we should be derided,
upon the meddow brow.
If this be all you fear sweet,
leave this alone to me,
I Will point a time convenient,
non shall our meeting see.
Where we will merry be,
and talk of what is to do
Where a kiss or twain i will give thee,
upon the meddow brooe,
I when you have me there Sir,
you then may do your pleasure:
But I will have you swear sir,
style for to do in measure.
We might repent at leisure.
should we out of measure do:
I am half affraide to meet you,
upon the meddow brooe.
Sweet heart I hear protest and swear
to use you there most kind,
Keep promise in your meeting,
and love me as you find,
I will not cross your mind,
what so ever I do do,
So you would grant to meet me:
upon the meddow brooe.
Then here is my hand i will meet thee,
appoint both place and time
Quoth he upon the meddow brooe
to morrow morn betime.
I Will meet (quoth she) bout five a clock
and that's the most i will do:
So gentle heart a kiss and part,
and meet on meddow brow.
Away then went these loving, twain
but when that they did meet:
Let such as know the use out,
judge how these two did greet:
But might I spend my judgment,
as an other man may do.
I doubt they played the wantons,
upon the meddow brooe,
What ere they did might I but know
my tongue should prove no ranger,
But did they well or did they ill,
let them oppose the danger.
Yet this shall be my wish for all,
that about such business go.
Heaven send all merry meeting,
upon the meddow broe.
