To the Most honorable Assembly of the house of Commons of the High Court of
Parliament.
The humble Petition of Thousands of Carpenters, Bricklayers, Smithes,
Plaisterers, Glasiers, Painters, and other Handicrafts men in and about the
City of London and Westminster with the Suburbs.
IN most humble wise shows. That whereas your poor Petitioners exhibited
their humble Petition unto this honorable Assembly the last Session, for a
Confirmed authority to repair Houses, and for a reformation of Building, as
far forth as might be requisite for the present use of the Inhabiters, as
also for restraint of fire; Arguments and reasons were forthwith exhibited to
that effect, and thereupon was an Order granted for a day of hearing which
order is extant, howbeit by reason of many other great and weighty occasions
and the Session so suddenly prorogued, nothing was done for the Confirmation of
the said premises: In tender Consideration whereof, it would please this
honorable Assembly forth of your Noble and grave disposition, to grant us a
day of hearing of our cause whereby such order and course may be taken for
repairing of Houses and reformation of Building, so far forth as may be with
conueniency for the present use and benefit of the Inhabiters, and also for
safety and restraint of fire for a general good.

And your poor Petitioners (shall as duty binds them) pray unto God not
only for a prosperous proceeding in this your great and weighty employments,
to the glory of God, the good of the Church, and the benefit of the Common
wealth: but also for your healths, peace and tranquillity, long to continue.
