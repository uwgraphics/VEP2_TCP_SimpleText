By the King.
A Proclamation for Jurors.
AS it is a principal part of our Kingly Office, to administer Justice to our
people, by which our Crown and Scepter is also established and confirmed: So
we conceive, that we may truly and justly thus far reap the fruit of a
good conscience, as to be witness to our self, and likewise to report our
selves, not only to our Privy Counsel, (which are acquainted with our more
secret cares and cogitations) and our Judges and Counsel at Law (with whom we
have had more frequent conference, then Princes formerly have used) but
generally also to all other our loving Subjects, in regard of some our Public
actions, Whether in these few years of our Reign (notwithstanding we could
not be at our first entrance so well informed, as now we are, in the Laws
and Customs of this our Realm) we have not exercised and employed our
Princely care, power and means, for the furtherance and advancement of Justice
duly and speedily to be administered to all our loving Subjects. For it
appears, that we have to that end been at charge to increase the number of
our Judges in our principal Benches, have endeavored to moderate some
differences and contentions amongst our Courts in point of Jurisdiction, to
avoid double vexation of Suits, and have from time to time, in person given
more strait charge and admonition to our Judges before their Circuits and
visitations, and received again from them more strait accounts and reports at
their returns, then has been heretofore accustomed. And as we have been thus
careful concerning our Courts, and Judges of the Law: So may we in no wise
omit to extend our Princely care to persons of another condition, on whom
(though they be not to be termed Judges) there lies a principal part of
Judicature: which are those, who by the custom of the Realm are called
Jurors, which serve to try and decide the issues and points of fact in all
controversies and causes. A matter no less important to the sum of Justice,
then the true and judicious exposition of the Laws themselves. For even that
Judgment which was given by a King in Person, and is so much commended in the
Scriptures, was not any learned exposition of the Law, but a wise sifting and
examination of the fact, where testimony was obscure, and failed. To which
sort of persons also the Law of this our Realm does ascribe such trust and
confidence, as it does not so absolutely tie them to the evidences and proofs
produced, but that it leaves both supply of Testimony, and the discerning and
credit of Testimony to the Iuries consciences and understanding.

But herewithall we consider with our selves, That this proceeding by Jury
(which is one of the ancient Laws and Customs of this our Island of Great
Britain, and almost proper and singular unto it, in regard of other Nations)
as it is an excellent institution in it self, so nevertheless it is then
laudable and good, when those persons, which serve upon the said Iuries, are
men of such quality, credit and understanding, as are worthy to be trusted
with so great a charge, as to try men's lives, good names, lands and goods, and
whatsoever they hold dear in this world. Wherein we cannot but observe, and
highly commend the wisdom of the Laws of this our Realm (taking them in
their own nature, before abuses crept in) which have in this point so well
provided. For as in the trial of any Peer of this Realm, the Law does not
admit any to pass upon him but Peers: So in the trial of any of the Commons
(which the Law beholds but as one body) there is no person whatsoever of that
body by rule of Law exempted, in respect of his quality and degree only, from
the service upon Iuries: whereas on the contrary part the Law has limited,
that none serve, except he have a certain proportion of Freehold. And yet
notwithstanding, Time and abuse have so embased the estimation of this service,
and altered the use thereof, as Sheriffs, Vndersheriffes, Bailiffes, and other
inferior Ministers, do not only spare Gentlemen of quality, in a kind of
awe, and unwillingness to offend them, but do likewise for lucre, gain and
reward, forbear to return many of the ablest and fittest persons; So that the
service oftentimes rests upon such as are either simple and ignorant, and
almost at a gaze in any cause of difficulty, or else upon those that are so
accustomed and inured to pass and serve upon Iuries, as they have almost lost
that tenderness of Conscience, which in such cases is to be wished, and make
the service, as it were an occupation and practice.

Upon these grounds therefore, and upon advise taken with our privy Council,
and conference with our Judges and Council at Law, We have resolved to give
some remedy to those abuses, and to restore the form of trials in this our
Realm of England, to the ancient integrity and credit, as much as in us lies.
And therefore we do hereby publish and declare to all our loving Subjects,
that they take light from us of the greatness of this service, and that the
Gentlemen of best quality do put away that vain and untrue conceit, that
they are any ways disgraced, or disesteemed, if they be called upon or used in
this part of Justice, to be tryers of the fact, Knowing that all Judgment is
Gods principally, and by him committed unto us within the Precinct of our
Kingdoms, as his Minister upon Earth, to whom likewise they are subordinate.
And we do likewise charge and command all our Judges, Justices, Sheriffs,
Vndersheriffes, Bayliffes and others to whom it may appertain, To take
knowledge that this is our express Will and pleasure, That all persons which
have Freehold, according to the Law, shall be returned to serve upon Iuries, as
occasion shall require. Foreseeing also that they use a respect, that the same
persons be not too often returned and troubled, but that the service may rest
more equally and indifferently upon the whole body of sufficient Freeholders in
every County, the one to ease and relieve the other, and that there be a
discretion used, as well in returning the most principal Persons upon the
greatest causes, as in sorting men of quality with their equals, as near as
may be.

And now that we have thus declared our earnest care and zeal for the
furtherance of Justice in this kind, seeing it has been usual for Sheriffs
and other Ministers (to whom it appertains) to forbear the returning of
diverse persons, in respect that they were sons of Peers of our Realm, or
men of extraordinary place and calling, which we have no way misliked, and do
well allow: Intending likewise that such, and so convenient respect be used
particularly to our Justices of peace, in regard of the place they hold, and
their continual employments, as they may be no oftener used in services of that
nature, then shall be necessary: And forasmuch as We do well consider that it
may so fall out many times, that diverse persons besides those above named, and
such other as the Law for natural impotencie dispenses withal in an
ordinary course, may likewise be found meet to be forborne in these services:
We do hereby declare, that We are also resolved by virtue of our Prerogative
(and according to the ancient presidents of our Progenitors) to grant special
exemption by our Letters Patents to some such persons, and upon such special
causes as We shall think just and reasonable, not meaning from henceforth to
leave it in the power of any other, but in the special cases aforesaid, to do
that which is only proper to our self. In which course (as in all the rest of
our proceedings) although it appears unto us by a Certificate lately made
from the Sheriffs, of the state of the Freeholders in this Kingdom, that the
multitude of them is great, and are otherwise as certainly informed, that the
one half is not certified: and although We have been and are daily importuned
for some particular exemptions by diverse persons, as well Knights and
Gentlemen, as other Freeholders of good ability: Nevertheless, because it may
appear that We do and ever will prefer the precious care of Justice before
all other second considerations, We resolve there shall be so good a
moderation in the number, as well as in the choice of the persons, as no
prejudice shall arise thereby in the ordinary course of Justice, Although our
meaning be, that all such Grants so to be made by Us, shall extend as well to
all causes concerning our Self, our Heirs and Successors, as our subjects.
All which We have thought fit to notify by this our Proclamation.

Given at our Honor of Hampton Court the fifth day of October, in the fifth
year of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. ANNO DOM. 1607.
