INTERLO QVVNTVR.
Auctor. Anima separata. Corpus exanime. Daemones.
AVCTOR. NOctis sub silentio,
tempore brumali
Deditus quodammodo
somno spiritali:
Corpus carens video
spiritu vitali.
De quo mihi visto
fit sub forma tali.
2.
Cum dormirem paululum
vigilando fessus
Ecce quidam spiritus
nouiter egressus
De praedicto corpore,
vitijs oppressus,
Corporis, cum gemitu
plangebat excessus.
3.
Iuxta corpus anima
stetit and plorauit,
Et eam cum gemitu
sic interrogauit:
O caro miserrima!
quis te sic prostrauit?
Quam munus tam prospere
pridie ditauit.
4.
Nonne mundus pridie
tibi subdebatur?
Nonne te prouincia
tota verebatur?
Vbi nunc familia
quae te sequebatur?
Cauda illa florida
iam nunc amputatur.
5.
Non es nunc in turribus
de petris quadratis,
Sed nec in Palatiis
magnae largitatis,
Nunc delata feretro
Paruae quantitatis,
Iaces nunc in tumulo
Breuiore satis.
6.
Quid tibi Palatia,
prosunt vel quid aedes?
Vix nunc tuus tumulus
been capit pedes,
Que^quam falso iudicans
a modo non lades,
Per te data nobis est
in inferno seeds.
7.
Ego inquam anima
nobilis creata,
Ad similitudinem
Domini formata.
Donis and virtutibus
multis decorata,
At ab illa Anima
quantum (heu) mutata.
8.
O caro miserrima,
mecum es damnata
Si scires supplicia
nobis praeparata
Vere, velis dicere
heu quid fui nata,
Vtinam ad tumulum
de ventre translata.
9.
Nec est mirum fateor,
quia dum vixisti,
Quicquam benefacere
me non permisisti;
Sed semper ad scelera
pessima traxisti,
Vnde semper crimus
in dolor tristi.
10.
In poenis acerrimis
sum and semper ero,
Nulla lingua seculi
dicerent pro vero,
Vnam poenam misera^^
quam infoelix fero,
Sed quod magis dole^
veniam non sper^.
11.
Vbi nunc sunt praedia
qua tu congregasti,
Vel celsa palatia
turres quas fundasti,
Et nummorum copia
quam tu plus amasti,
Gemmae per quas annulis,
digitos ornasti.
12.
Vbi lecti strati sunt
tam miri decoris:
Vestis mutatoria
varii coloris.
Species aromatum
placidi saporis,
Vasa, mensa, gausapa
niuei candoris.
13.
Vbi modo volucres
vel caro ferina,
Vel murenanobiles,
vel electa vina?
Non vitulis nec
redolent coquina.
Talis peccatoribus
imminet ruina.
14.
Tua domus qualiter
tibi modo placet
Eius nonne summitas
super nasum iacet?
Iam clauduntur oculi
lingua tua tacet:
Nihil tibi superest
quod iam lucro vacet.
15.
Quicqua^ dudum misero
congregasti me,
Dolo, fraud, foenore,
metu, vel rigore:
Longeua per tempora
magno cum labor,
A te totum rapiunt
mors, humus, humore,
16.
Non modo circumdaris
amicorum choris,
Cum per mortem cecidit
flos tui decoris:
Rapiter cuiuslibet
vinculum amoris.
Tuae iam tristitia
cessauit vxoris.
17.
In tuis parentibus
Amodo non speres,
Quia sibi remanent
Terrae, Bacchus, Ceres,
Et thesauri copia
pro qua poenas feres:
Mortem tuam breuiter
plangit tuus Haeres.
18.
Non credo quod Mulier
tua, sieve nati
Darent quinque iugera
Terrae sieve prati.
Vt nos qui de medio
sumus iam sublati,
A poenis redimerent,
quas debemus pati.
19.
Iam scis caro misera,
quam sit male tuta,
Mundi nequum gloria,
fallax and versuta:
Repleta doloribus,
vitijs polluta,
Et veneno daemonum
nequetur imbuta:
20.
Pretiosis vestibus
non es nunc induta,
Tuum valet pallium,
vix duo minuta,
Paruo linteamine
iaces inuoluta,
Tibi modo pauperes
non ferent tributa.
21.
Et licet non sentias
nunc tormenta dura,
Scias quod supplicijs
non es caritura,
Nam testantur omnia,
Scriptur arum iura,
Quod tormenta post-modum
mecum es passura.
22.
Te qui pater pauperum
non eras sed proedo,
Iam rodunt in tumulo
vermes and putredo:
Sed vltra tecum nequeo
stare, iam recedo:
Nescis ad opposita
respondere credo.

Respondet Corpus. 23.
TAndem postquam Anima,
talia dixisset,
Sese corpus erigens
quasi reuixisset,
Postquam vero gemitus
multos emisisset
Quaerit quisnam talia
loquutus fuisset.
24.
Es tu, inquit, spiritus
meus qui sic faris?
Non sunt vera penitus
cuncta quae causaris:
Iam probabo before,
argumentis claris,
Quod si quaedam vera sint,
in multis nugaris.
25,
Fecite (confiteor)
in multis errare,
Et a bonis actibus
Sepe declinare.
Sed si caro faciat
animam errare,
Plus est culpa spiritus,
audi tamen quare.
26
Mundus and daemonium
foedus pepigere,
Et carnem miserrimam
secum coniunxere,
Quam si rigor animi
cessit coercere,
In peccati foueam
cadunt ambo vere.
27
Sed vt mihi dixeras
Deus te creauit,
Et bonum and nobilem,
sensu te ditauit,
Et ad suam speciem
pariter formauit,
Vt ancilla fierem
tibi me donauit.
28
Ergo si tu domina
creata fuisti,
Et dabatur ratio
per quam debuisti
Nos in mundo regere:
cur mihi fauisti
In rebus illicitis
and non restitisti?
29
Number carnem vt anima^
iustum est culpari,
Quaese, cum sit domina,
sinit ancillari?
Nam caro per spiritum
debet edomari,
Fame, siti, verbere,
si vult dominari.
30
Caro sine spiritu
nihil operatur:
Eius adminiculo
viuens vegetatur.
Caro quae per spiritum
non suppeditatur,
Per mundi blanditias
mox infatuatur.
31
Caro quae corrumpitur,
perse malum nescit,
Carni sine spiritu
nihil innotescit.
Si quod iubes exequor
culpa tibi crescit.
Caro sine spiritu,
mortua quiescit.
32
Si voluntas spiritus
in opus ducatur,
Per carnem pedissequam
caro quid culpatur?
Culpa tangit animam,
per quam imperatur,
Id quod caro fragilis
viuens operatur.
33
Carne quidem grauius
tu peccasti creed,
Carnis sequens libitum,
fragilis and foedae.
Sed rodunt mea viscera
vermes in hac ade
Iam non loquor amplius
anima cecede.

Replicat Anima. 34.
AD haec dixit Anima,
tecum volo stare,
Et tua si potero
dicta refroenare
Vt quid mihi loqueris
corpus tam amare.
Volens mihi penitus
culpam imputare.
35
O caro miserrimae,
qua vineus fuisti
Stulta, vana, friuola,
a quo didicisti
Verba tam asperrima,
qua iam protulisti?
Licet in aliquibus
recte respondisti.
36
Istud enim consonum
scio veritati,
Restitisse debui
tuae voluntati:
Sed tua fragilitas
prona voluptati,
Nugis mundi dedita,
noluit hoc pati.
37
Quando to volebam,
o caro, castigare,
Verbere, vigiliis,
vel fame domare,
Mox te mundi vanitas
coepit effraenare,
Et illius friuolis
coegit vacare.
38
Et ita dominium
de me suscepisti,
Perditrix domestica
de mo sic fuisti.
Per mundi blanditias
me post te traxisti,
In peccati puteum
tandem me misisti.
39
Scio me culpabilem,
nam in hoc erraui,
Quod cum essem domina
non te refranaui.
Sed tu me deceperas
fraud tam suaui,
Quare tu deliqueras
culpa magis graui.
40
Si mundi delitias
dolos machinantis
Despexisses fatui
sed and incantantis,
Daemonis astutias,
e coelo tonantis
Adhaesisses monitis,
essemus cum sanctis.
41.
Sed tamen tripudijs
mundi fraus arrifit
Ac vitam diutinam
firmiter promisit:
Quod mori non putabas,
sed mors haec emisit
Quando de palatio
ad tumbam to misit.
42.
Hominum fallacium
mundus habet morem,
Quod magis amplectitur,
quibus dat honorem,
Illos fallit citius
per necis rigorem,
Et dat post diuitias
vermes and foetorem.
43.
Qui tibi, dum vixeras,
amici fuere,
Iacentem in tumulo
^olunt te videre.
Corpus hoc intelligens
coepit quasi flere,
Et verbis humilibus
ita respondere.

Respondet Corpus. 44.
QVi vinendo potui
multis imperare,
Aurum, gemmas, praedia,
nummos congregare,
Castella construere,
Gentes iudicare,
Putasne quod credidi
tumulum hunc intrare?
45
Optime nunc video,
and est mihi clarum,
Quod nec auri Dominus,
nec diuitiarum:
Honor, vis, scientia,
virtus nec herbarum.
Mortis possunt fugere
stimulum amarum.
46
Ambo quidem possumus*
a Christo culpari.
Et culpamur, fateor,
sed non culpa pari,
Tibi culpa grauior
debet imputari:
Multis rationibus
potest hoc probari:
47.
A sensato quolibet
hoc non ignoratur,
Iura clamant, ratio
pariter testatur,
Vt cui plus prae cateris,
virtutum donatur,
Ab eoplus vitque
tandem exigatur.
48.
Vitam and memoriam
sed and intellectum,
Tibi dedit Dominus,
sensumque perfectum,
Quibus tu compescere
debebas affectum
Pranum, and diligere
id quod erat rectum.
49.
Postquam tot virtutibus
ornata fuisti,
Et tu mihi fatua
pronam te dedisti,
Meisque blanditijs
minus restitisti,
Satis liquet omnibus,
quod plus deliquisti.
50
Addo: licet refero,
cord cum amaro,
Quod mihi iam patens est
argumento claro
Exeunte spiritu,
agitue quid caro?
Mouet ne se postea
vel cito, vel raro?
51
Videt ne, vel loquitur,
hoc est ergo clarum:
Spiritus vinificat,
caro prodest parum.
Si haberet Anima
Deum suum charum,
Nunquam caro vinceret
vires animarum.
52
Si Deum dum vixeras,
amasses perfect,
Et si causas pauperum
indicasses recte,
Nec prauorum hominum
adhaefisses secta,
Nec me mundi vanitas
concepisset, nec te.
53.
Qua viuebam spendide
sericis amicta,
Ecce quae de omnibus
sunt mihi relicta,
Putredo cum vermibus,
and haec domus stricta,
Quibus post delitias
mundi sum amicta.
54.
Et scio praeterea
quod sum surrectura,
In die nouissimo,
tecumque passura
Poenas mortis perpetes:
heu morsilla dura
Mors interminabilis,
fine caritura.

Anima fatetur. 55.
AD haec clamat anima,
voce cum obscura,
Heu si nunquam fuissem
in rerum natura,
Cur permisit Dominus,
vt sim creatura,
Cum praescita fuerim
esse peritura?
56
O foelix conditio
peccorum brutorum,
Cadunt cum corporibus
spiritus eorum
Nec post mortem subeunt
loca tormentorum.
Talis esset vtinam
finis impiorum.

Interrogat Corpus. 57.
COrpus post haec loquitur
Animae tam tristi:
Si tu apud inferos
Anima fuisti,
Dic mihi, te deprecor,
quid ibi vidisti?
Si qua spes sit miseris
de dulcore Christi.
58
Quid ibi nobilibus
paratur personis,
Qui prius, dum vixerant
sedebant in thronis?
Si sit illis aliqua
spes redemptionis,
Pro nummis, pro praediis,
caterisque donis,

Anima respondet. 59.
COrpus, tua quaestio
caret ratione,
Cum infernum subeunt
damnatae personae,
Non est spes vlterius
de redemptione,
Nec pro eleemosynis,
vel oratione.
60
Si tota fidelium
pietas oraret,
Si totam pecuniam
mundus suam daret,
Si tota religio
ieiunijs vacaret,
In inferno positum
nunquam liberaret.
61
Non daret diabolus
ferus and effraenis,
Vnam vinctam animam
in suis catenis
Pro centenis millibus
praedijs terrenis,
Nec quandoque fineret
vt careret poenis.
62
Ad hoc quod interrogat
quid ibi paratur
Personis nobilibus:
hoc pro lege datur,
Quanto quis in seculo
magis exaltatur,
Tanto cadit grauius
si transgrediatur.
63
Dines ergo moriens
si impius, damnatur:
Grauibus prae caeteris
poenis implicatur:
Nam quanto delicijs
plus delectabatur,
Tanto poena grauior
sibi deputatur.

Auctor in visione. 64
POstquam tales Anima
prompserat moerores,
Ecce duo daemones
pice nigriores,
Quos penna describere
non possunt scriptores,
Nec mundi depingere,
totius pictores.
65
Ferreos in manibus
stimulos gestantes,
Ignemque sulphureum
per os emittentes,
Similes ligonibus
sunt eorum dentes.
Visi sunt ex naribus
prodire serpents.
66
Aures erant patulae
sanie fluentes,
Et erant in frontibus
cornua gerentes.
Per extrema cornuum
venenum fundentes,
Digitorum vngulae
vt aprorum dentes.
67
Isti cum funiculis
animam coeperunt,
Quam secum ad inferos
gementem traxerunt.
Mox maligni spiritus
passim occurrerunt,
Qui vice tripudij
dentibus striderunt.
68
Et ei cum talibus
votis applauserunt,
Quidam cum corrigis
ipsam perstrinxerunt,
Quidam vncis ferreis
ipsam disruperunt:
Quidam plumbum feruidu^
in eam fuderunt.

Daemones. 69.
ADhaec dicunt daemones
quasi fatigati,
Ii qui nobis seruiunt,
sic sunt honorati.
Possis modo dicere
sicut bufo crati,
Sed debes in centuplum
duriora pati.

Anima exclamat. 70
POst haec tandem anima
gemens suspirauit,
Et voce qua poterat,
parum murmurauit:
Quando vero baratri
limen subintrauit,
Iiulans sonauit
IESV fili David.

Daemones respondent. 71.
COnclamantes daemones
responderunt ei:
Tarde nimis inuocas
nomen tui Dei.
Parum prodest amodo
miserere mei.
Non est vltra veniae
spes non requiei.
72
Non lumen de caetero
videbis dici,
Decor iam mutabitur
tuae faciei.
Nostrae sociaberis
dehinc aciei.
Erit apud inferos
hoc solamen ei.

Auctor concludit. 73
TAlia dum videram
dormiens expaui,
Et extra me positus
statim vigilaui,
Mox expansis manibus
ad Deum clamaui,
Orans vt me protegat
a poenatam graui.
74
Et mundu^ cum friuolis
suis condemnaui.
Aurum, gemmas, pradia,
nihil reputaui.
Rebus transitorijs
abrenunciaui,
Et me Christi manibus
totum commendaui.
75
Ecce mundus moritur,
vitio sepultus,
Ordo rerum vertitur
sapiens fit stultus,
Exulat iustitia,
cessat Christicultus.
Et in mundo iugiter
labor and tumultus.
76
Mundus ad interitum
pergit his diebus.
Dij facti sunt iterum
Jupiter and Phoebus.
Nam qui mundum possidet
and abundat rebus,
Hic vt Deus collitur
sceptris, aciebus.
77
Et quae theologicae
virtutes vocantur,
Fides, spes, and charitas,
fere suffocantur.
Fraus, and auaritia,
and quae deriuantur
Ex his, iam in seculo
toto dominantur.
78
Si sis ortu nobilis,
si vultu serenus,
Si benignus, humilis,
moribusque plenus,
Haec nil tibi proderunt,
si tu sis egenus.
Sola nam pecunia
formam dat and genus.
79
Du^modo sim splendidis
vestibus ornatus,
Et multa familia
sim circumuallatus,
Prudens sim and sapiens,
and morigeratus,
Ego tuus nepos sum,
tu meus cognatus.
80
Ista cum defic^rint
statim euanescit:
Nostra consanguinitas
morte refrigescit,
Cessatque notitia,
ita quod me nescit
Qui dum dives fueram
surgens mihi cessit.
81
O miranda vanitas!
o diuitiarum
Amor lamentabilis!
o virus amarum!
Cur tot viros inficis
faciendo carum
Hoc quod tranfit cit^^^
quam flamma stuparum?
82
Si mundus diuitibus
tria posset dare:
Iuuentutem floridam
and mortem vitare,
Pulchram and durabilem
prolem procreare,
Been possent diuites
nummos congregare.
83.
Homo miser cogita,
mors ista compescit.
Quis est ab initio
qui morti non cessit?
Hic si viuit hodie,
cras forte putrescit.
Cuique prorsus hominum
parcere iam nescit.
84.
Quando genus hominum
morti deputatur:
Quo post mortem transeat
quisquam, ignoratur.
Vnde quidem sapiens
ita de se fatur:
Contremisco iugiter,
dum men's meditatur,
Quid sum, and quo propero,
quid mihi paratur.
85
De morte dum cogito,
contristor and ploro,
Vnum est, quod moriar,
and tempus ignoro:
Tertium, quod nescio
quorum iungar choro.
Sed, vt suis valeam
iungi Deum oro.

FINIS.
THE COMPLAINT OR DIALOGVE, BETWIXT The Soul and the Body of a damned man.

Each laying the fault upon the other.

Supposed to be written by S. BERNARD from a nightly vision of his; and now
published out of an ancient Manuscript Copy.

By WILLIAM CRASHAW.

LONDON, Printed by G. E. for Leonard Becket, and are to be sold at his shop in
the Temple near the Church. 1622.

To the Worshipful, my worthy beloved friends, Hugh Hare, Richard Brownlow,
George Crok, and John Walter Esquires, Benchers of the honorable society of
the inner TEMPLE.
Mercy, Grace, and Peace.
THe end, and highest happiness of a Christian man, is to honor God in this
life, and to dye well: the way to die well is to live well; and no better
provocation to good life, nor preparatiue to a good death, then a continual
and serious meditation of the mortality of this life, the certainty of our end,
the uncertainty when and how, the terriblenesse of the last judgment, and the
account that each one must make then, who have not made it here before, and
crossed the debt-book of their sins by the Lamb of God. This made an ancient
Father cry out: When I think of that day, I fear and tremble, for whether I
eat or drink, or what ever I do, I think I hear that terrible Trumpet
sounding in mine ears: Arise ye dead and come to judgment. And to this end,
the holy men of elder times willingly entertained all occasions that might
help them in these holy cogitations.

One evidence thereof is this short and sweet Dialogue, which (as a forerunner
of others that may follow) being diuulged, and desired by many to be
englished, I am therefore induced to make it common: This being an age that
needs all helps to holiness, and inticements to devotion: And this the rather
in as much, as though it was made in the mist of Popery, even not long after
the Devil was let loose; yet is it not tainted with Popish corruption, nor
scarce smells of any superstition, whereas it is stuffed with godly truths, and
wholesome instructions. My thoughts intended and dedicated it to your selves,
and that worthy, virtuous, and religious Gentleman, now with God, (the brother
to one of you in nature, and to you all in faithful Christian love.) But
seeing he needs it not, God having provided better things for him and his soul
now feeding on finer food in Gods glorious presence, and blessed vision of the
Deity: take you it therefore, and that part of profit that might hereby have
fallen to him and that part of my love which herein I showed, him divide among
you: and as he has left behind him to this Society, and all that knew him,
the sweet smell of a good name, for his many religious and moral virtues: so
let me leave behind me this little Monument of the much love my heart owes
you, and shall be willing to testify by my best service, as to this whole and
honorable Society in general, so to your selves in particular. To whom
(without wrong to any other, I speak it) I have been peculiarly beholden, and
by whom my studies have been much advanced.

Now the God of Grace and Mercy, so guide you in the ways of holiness and
good works, that at your ends your body may not blame your soul, nor the
soul the body; but both soul and body may have cause to glorify God their
Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier, in whose love I leave you, and rest yours in
all Christian duty.

THE SPEAKERS.
1. The Author. 2. A Soul departed. 3. A dead Carcass. 4. The Devils.
THE AVTHOR. IN silence of
a Winters night,
A sleeping, yet
a waking spirit:
A liuelesse body
to my sight
Me thought appeared
thus addight.
2.
In that my sleep
I did descry,
A Soul departed
but lately
From that foul body
which lay by,
Wailing with sighs
and loud did cry.
3.
Fast by the body
thus she mones,
And questions it
with sighs and groans.
O wretched flesh,
thus low who makes thee lie?
Whom yesterday
the world had seen so high?
4.
Wast not but yesterday
the world was thine?
And all the Country
stood at thy devotion?
Thy train that followed thee
when thy Sun did shine
Have now forsaken thee:
(O doleful alteration!)
5.
Those Turrets gay
of costly Masonry,
And larger Palaces
are not now thy room,
But in a Coffin
of small quantity,
Thou lie interred
in a little tomb.
6.
Thy Palaces, what help
they thee, or buildings?
Thy grave vneth's
of largeness for thy feet:
Henceforth thou can
hurt none with thy false iudgings,
For thy misdeeds
in hell we both must meet.
7.
I, I poor soul
oh I, a noble creature,
Formed and made
in likeness of my God,
Adorned with graces
of most comely feature
Am now so changed
as fouler then a Toad.
8.
O wretched flesh
with me that art forlorn,
If thou could know
how sharp our punishment?
How justly might
thou wish not to be borne,
Or from the womb
to tomb to have been hent.
9.
This I confess
no wonder, for in life
To one good deed
thou never would agree;
But to each greatest sin
did run with strife,
For which, for ever
we must damned be.
10.
I am, and ay must be.
in bitter pain,
No tongue of living man
has power to tell
One of the smallest
torments I sustain,
Where (which is worst)
I must for ever dwell.
11.
Where be those Lord-ships
thou have laid together?
Thy lofty Palaces,
thy Castles strong?
Thy heaps of gold
which were thy chiefest treasure,
Thy Rings and Jewels
which about thee hung?
12.
Where thy rich beds,
thy sumptuous Tapestry,
Thy change of raiment,
many colored vesture?
Thy dainty Spices
(baits of luxury)
Plate, Tables, Carpets,
and rich furniture?
13.
Where now thy wild Foul,
and thy Venison,
Thy dainty fishes,
and thy chosen wine?
In thy now Kitchen
meat is dressed none
Such plagues for sinners
God does still assign.
14.
How like thou now poor fool,
thy latter lodging,
The roof whereof
lies even with thy nose?
Thy eyes are shut,
thy tongue cannot be iogging,
Nothing of profit
rests at thy dispose.
15.
What erst thou have
most wretchedly been scraping,
By usury, deceit,
rage and oppression,
In all thy life, with toil
and greedy gaping,
Are hid by death
in earth and putrefaction.
16.
Thou art not now
begirt with troops of friends,
The flower of all thy beauty
lies in dust:
The bands of every love
do here take end,
Yea, thine own wife
now thinks all tears unjust.
17.
In thy left kindred
henceforth trust no more,
For, for thy Vine-yards,
fields of grass and corn:
And (which thy plagues increase)
thy treasured store:
Few days (know fool)
thy after Heirs will mourn.
18.
I do not think
thy Wife or Children left
Would lose one penny,
or one patch of lands:
For us which are from her
and them bereft,
Though it might quite us,
from these horrid bands.
19.
Now wretched flesh thou see
how naught reputed
Is the worlds glory,
false, deceitful, fell,
With anguish fraught,
with sin and vice polluted,
And clothed in the
noisome bane of hell.
20.
Thy garments wretched fool,
are far from rich,
Thy upper garment,
hardly worth a Scute:
A little linen
shrouds thee in thy d^tch,
No rents nor gifts men bring,
nor make their suite.
21.
Think not, though yet
no torments thou endure,
Thou never shall
but sleep for ever free:
For all Gods Scriptures
which are true and sure,
Witness, at last,
thou shall be plagued with me.
22.
Thee which the poor
did rob, and not defend,
Worms gnaw in earth
and rottenness thy bone:
But longer stay I must not:
here I end,
To this, I trow,
answer thou know none.

The Body answers. 23.
THus said the Soul: at last
the ghastly Coarse
Strains up it self
as being new revived:
And with deep groans
as if it had been hoarse,
Asked, who such witless
reasons had contrived?
24
Art thou, quoth it, my Soul
which thus do feign?
All that thou say
is neither true nor stable:
For I will prove
with arguments most plain,
If some be true
in many thou do fable.
I (as thou say)
have led thee often astray,
And from well-doing
have enforst thy love:
But if the flesh
can lead the Soul away
The fault's more thine then mine,
which thus I prove.
26
The world and power of hell
did both conspire,
And did the flesh
to them associate;
Which if the constant
soul cause not retire,
Both needs must enter
at sins wretched gate.
27
But as thou say,
our God did thee create,
Good, noble, understanding,
he thee made;
And like himself,
he fashioned thy state,
And made me servant
to what ere thou said.
28
Therefore, if thou
my Mistress ought to be,
And reason had,
by which thy office was
Us both to gonerne:
why did thou suffer me
Without restraint
in wicked race to pass?
29.
Is It just to charge
the Body, as the Spirit?
Which being rightful
Mistress, yet will serve;
To tame the flesh,
the spirit ought of right
With abstinence, and
stripes, if she will not swerue.
30.
The bodies works
be from the soul derived,
By means thereof
in life it floruisheth:
That flesh which by
the soul is not assisted;
By easy baits
the world soon vanquisheth.
31.
The body of it self
none ill has known,
All that it knows
proceeds from thy head:
If I do what thou bidst
the fault's thine own,
For without thee
the body rests dead.
32
Why should poor handmaid
(flesh) be charged with blame,
In working only
as thy instrument?
The soul commands all,
hers be the shame
Of all my frailties,
since I want judgment.
33
Therefore I ween
thy guilt exceeds mine,
In following my lust
so frail, and foul:
But oh the worms do
tear me in my shrine,
I therefore say no more,
farewell poor soul.

The Soul Replies. 34
NAy (said the Soul)
I Will stay by thee a while,
And if I can,
thine arguments confute:
Why rail'st thou on me
in this bitter style,
Striving to me
thy whole guilt to impute?
35.
Most wretched flesh
which in thy time of life
Wast foolish, idle,
vain, why do thou wreake
Thy wrath in railing words
to make new strife?
Though for the substance
it is true that thou do speak.
36.
For truth it is,
and stands with reason plain,
I should have bridled thee
and ruled thy will,
But thou through love
of pleasure foul and vain,
And sensual appetites
me resisted still.
37.
When I would thee
O body have controlled,
And have subdued,
with watching, fast, and pain,
Straights the worlds vanity
did thee withold,
And to his vanie delights
drew thee again.
38
So thou of me
did get the upper hand,
And of my mildness
made so bad construction,
That thralling me
in wordly pleasures band
Eternally have drowned
me in destruction.
39
I know my guilt,
and this my trespass was,
That being chief
I did not thee restrain:
But thou deceiuedst me
with so fair a glass,
That thy offense
the greater ought remain.
40
The vain worlds practices,
baits and delights,
If thou had left
with steadfast constancy,
And so with-stood
Satan's enchanting sleights,
Heaven had been ours,
with Saints and Deity.
41.
But flattering fancies
of the world did please,
And made thee hope
a lasting life to have;
Thou never thoughtst
to dye, till death did ceaze:
And haled thee from
thy Court to dirty grave.
42.
The world, and subtle
men, have both one guise,
Where most it smiles,
and most bestows honor,
There soonest it
deceiues, soonest death cries,
And changes wealth
to worms, to stinch and horror.
43.
He which in life
did fawn and was thy friend,
Will not now cast
a look upon thy grave.
Then began the body weep
weighing this end,
And lowly, in his style,
such answer gave.

The body answers. 44
I In my life,
which had so great command,
In jewels, riches,
lands did so abound:
Built Palaces,
and judged many a land.
Think thou I thought
of Tomb in this base ground?
45
Oh, now I see,
and find it to my grief,
That neither gold;
nor wealth, nor larger rent,
Honor, strength, knowledge,
nor sovereign herbs relief,
Can cure deaths bitter
sting, nor it prevent.
46
Before our God
we guilty both do stand,
And both in fault,
but not both equally,
The greatest burden
lies on thy hand:
And this to prove
full many reasons lie.
47
No wit so mean,
but this for truth it knows:
Justice it self
and reason both agree,
That where most gifts
of virtue God bestows,
There most is due,
and ought repayed be.
48
Life, Memory,
and powerful understanding
God gave to thee,
and with it sense of might,
Wherewith thou should
have curbed at thy commanding
Concupiscence,
and followed that was right.
49
Then since thy dower
of virtue stretched so far,
And foolishly thou
gave thy self to me,
And my entisements
never would debar,
That thy fault greatest is
all men may see.
50
Further I add
(with anguish of my heart)
Which mine own case
does plainly demonstrate:
The flesh can nothing
do, if soul depar:,
It neither moves,
nor stirs, early or late.
51
It neither sees,
nor speaks: then is this proved,
The Soul gives life,
no power in flesh does rest:
If then the Soul
rightly her God had loved,
The flesh had never
her great power suppressed.
52
If Gods love, living,
thou had holden dear,
And poor men's causes
rightly had de find,
And unto wicked
counsels given no ear,
Nor me nor thee
worlds vanity had twinde.
53
I that lived gay,
and gorgeous in attire,
Lo, what of all
now unto me remains;
Worms, rottenness,
and narrow lodge of mire.
These after all
delights, are left my gains.
54
And (oh) I know,
that at the later hour
I shall arise
and as I did offend
With thee shall find
a second death most sour,
An everlasting
death, death without end!

The soul confesses. 55
With hollow fearful voice
then howles the soul:
Oh, had I not
amongst the creatures been,
Why with his creatures,
did God me enroule?
Whom he foreknew
should perish thus for sin?
56
Happy are you
bruit beasts, happy your state,
You wholly dye
at once, and only rot:
Once dead, all torments
cease, such is your fate.
Oh! were such end
for sinners, such their lot.

The Body asks the Soul a Question. 57
THen, quoth the Body
to his pensive Ghost,
If thou have been
among the fiends in hell,
Tell me, I pray
what saw thou in that Coast?
Is no help left
from thence with Christ to dwell?
58
For Kings and great men
what is their provision,
Which living,
Lorded it in high degree.
For them is any
hope left of redemption,
For money,
lands, bequests, or other fee?

The Soul gives answer. 59
THe question, senseless body,
wants reason:
For when to hell
the wicked damned be,
Redemption then is hopeless,
out of season:
Bootlesse are almsdeeds,
prayers and charity.
60
If all the piety
of men should pray,
If all the world
in price were offered,
If all good men should
fast both night and day,
For this not one
should be delivered.
61
The roaring devil,
cruel and full of rage,
For infinite of worlds,
or any gain,
Would not forgo
one soul, shut in his cage,
Nor ease his torments,
nor make less his pain.
62
And to thy question,
what is there prepared
For Lords and great ones,
Gods Law is express:
The more that here
one is advanced or feared,
More fearful is his fall,
if he transgress.
63
A rich man therefore
dying in his sin,
No man shall sharper
torments feel then he.
How much more pleasures
that he lived in,
So much more grievous
shall his torment be.

The Author in vision. 64.
AFter the Soul had said
these mournful words,
Behold, two fiends
more black then pitch or night,
Whose shapes with pen to write
no wit affords,
Nor any hand
of painter pourtray right.
65
Sharp steely pricks
they did in each hand bear,
Sulphur and fire
flaming they breathed out,
Tusked their teeth
like crooked mattocks were,
And from their nostrils
snakes crawled round about.
66
Their ears with running
sores, hung flapping low,
Foul filthy horns, in their
black brows they wore,
Full of thick poison
which from them did flow,
Their nails were like
the tushes of a Bore.
67
These finds in chains
fast bound this wretched soul,
And with them haled her,
howling into hell.
To whom, on flocks,
ran other devils more,
And gnashing with their teeth,
to dancing fell.
68
They welcomed her
with greetings full of woe,
Some wrested her with cords,
senseless of dread,
Some snatched and tore with hooks,
drawn to and fro;
Some for her welcome
powered on scalding lead.

Devils. 69
SVch horror we
do on our servants load,
Then (as half wearied)
the devils cried,
Now art thou worse
then was the crawling Toade,
Yet thousandfold
worse torments thee abide.

The Soul cries out. 70
AFter all this, the groaning
Soul deep sighed,
And with what voice
it could, low murmured:
But when within
the gates of hell she entered,
She howled out
Jesus the Son of David.

The Devils answer. 71.
THen all the devils
together loud did cry,
Too late, too late,
thou call on thy God;
Here is no room
for Miserere mei:
o hope of easement
from this bitter rod.
72
Never hence forth shall thou
the light behold,
Thou must be altered
to another hue:
Thou art a Soldier
of our Camp enrol'd;
Such is the comfort
that in hell is due.

The Author concludes. 73.
THen I awaked
full of fear,
And much amazed
my self did rear:
To God I said
with folded hands
O shield me from
such grievous bands.
74
I left the world
and it forsook:
Of goods and lands
no care I took:
I did renounce
each worldly thing,
And gave my self
to Christ my King.
75
The world is drowned
in sin and vice,
All order changed,
not one man wise:
Both Justice, and
Religion lost,
And all the world
in turmoile tossed.
76
The world to ruin
runs amain,
False gods are now
set up again:
Unto the rich
their hands men hold,
He is the God,
that has the gold.
77
The virtues of
Divinity,
Are chok't,
faith, hope, and charity.
The brood of
couerise and craft,
Bear all the sway,
and sit aloft.
78
Be thou noble,
wise and fair,
Courteous,
lowly, debonaire,
And poor, thou may
do what thou can:
But only money,
makes the man.
79
If I be clad in rich array,
and well attended every day,
Both wise and good I shall be thought;
my kindred also shall be sought.
I am (say men,
the case is clear)
Your cousin sir
a kinsman near.
80
But if the world
do change and frown,
Our kindred is
no longer known:
Nor I remembered
any more,
By them that honored
me before.
81
O vanity,
vile love of mucke!
Foul poison,
wherefore have thou struck
Thy self so deep,
to raise so high,
Things vanishing
so suddenly?
82
For if the world
could three things give,
Lusty youth,
and long to live,
Children strong,
and fair of feature,
Riches then were
a good treasure.
83.
But know (poor fool)
these end with death,
From first till now,
all lose their breath:
Living to day,
to morrow gone,
All flesh must die,
death spares none.
84.
And as it is certain all must die,
So whither they go,
none can descry,
Which made a wiseman
thus to say;
I quake and tremble night and day,
First thinking of my present case,
Then of that strange and fearful place
To which I must: but specially
Of that which there is prepared for me.
85
Thinking of death I sigh and weep,
For three things which
in heart I keep:
That dye I must,
but know not when,
Nor who shall be my fellow then.
Therefore to thee (my God) I pray
That I may live with thee for aye.

De Deo Patre, pia, and orthodoxa Confessio.
ALpha and Omega Deus,
Hely, Hely, Deus meus.
Cuius virtus, totum posse:
Cuius sensus, totum nosse.
Cuius esse, summum bonum:
Cuius opus, quicquid bonum.
Super cuncta, subter cuncta:
Extra cuncta, intra cuncta.
Super cuncta, nec elatus,

Extra cuncta, nec exclusus,
Intra cuncta, nec inclusus,
Super totus praesidendo,
Subter totus sustinendo.
Extra totus complectendo,
Intra totus es implendo.
Super nullo sustentaris,
Subter nullo fatigaris.
Extra nusquam dilataris,
Intra nunquam coarctaris.
Mundum mouens, non moueris,
Locum tenens non teneris.
Tempus mutans non mutaris,
Vaga firmans, non vagaris.
Vis externa vel necesse,
Non alternat tuum esse.
Heri nostrum cras and pridem,
Semper tibi nunc and idem.
Tuum decus hodiernum,
Indiuisum sempiternum.
Tu hoc totum prouidisti,
Totum sinu perf^^isti.
Ad exemplar sum mentis,
Formam prabens elementis.
De Jesus Christo Deo and homine Confessio Orthodoxa.
NAte Patri coaequalis,
Patri consubstantialis:
Patris splendour and figura,
Factor factus creatura.
Carnem nostram induisti,
Causam nostram suscepisti:
Sempiternus temporalis,
Moriturus immortalis.
Verus homo, verus Deus,
Impermixius homo Deus.
Patri compar Deitate,
Minor carnis veritate.
Hic assumptus est in Deum;
Nec consumptus propter Deum:
Non conuersus hic in carnem,
Nec minutus propter carnem.
Deus Pater, tantum Dei,
Virgo matter sed and Dei.
In tam noua ligaturae,
Sic vtraque stat natura.
Vt conseruet quicquid erat,
Facta quiddam, quod non erat.
Noster iste Mediator,
Iste noster Cogislator.
Circumcisus, Baptizatus,
Crucisixus, tumulatus:
Obdormiuit and descendit,
Resurrexit and ascendit.
Sic ad coelos eleuatus,
Iudicabit iudicatus.
De codem.
QVem nobis voluit
diuina potentia Natum,
Quem natum sua fecerunt
miracula Notum,
Quem notum plebeia Cruci
vult concio Fixum,
Quemque crucifixum,
voluit pia turoa Sepultum:
Hunc Natum, Notum, fixum,
terraque sepultum,
Sustulit in summum,
Diuina potentia Coelum.
De fancto Spiritu Confessio Orthodoxa.
PAracletus increatus,
Neque factus, neque natus.
Patri compar filioque
Sic procedit ab vtroque
Ne sit minor potestate,
Vel discretus qualitate,
Quanti illi, tantus iste,
Quales illi, talis iste.
Ex qui illi, ex tune iste,
Quantum illi, tantum iste.
Pater alter sed gignendo,
Natus alter sed nascendo.
Flamen ab his procedendo,
Tres sunt vnum subsistendo,
Quisque trium plenus Deus,
Non tres tamen Dij sed vnus.
In hoc Deo, Deo vero,
Tres and vnum asseuero.
Dans OVSTA vnitatem,
Et personis trinitatem.
In personis nulla prior,
Nulla mayor, nulla minor.
Vnaque semper ipsa,
Sic est constans atque fixa.
Vt nec in se varietur,
Nec in vllam transmutetur.
Conclusio cum deuotissima Precatione.
HAec est fides Orthodoxa,
Non hic error sieve noxa.
Sicut dico, sic and credc,
Nec in prauam partem cedo.
Inde veni bone Deus,
Ne desperem quamuis reus.
Reus mortis non despero,
Sed in morte vitam quaero.
Quo te placeam non pretendo,
Nisi fidem quam defendo.
Fidem vides hac imploro,
Leua fascem quo laboro.
Per hoc sacrum cataplasma,
Conualescat agrum plasma.
Extra portem iam delatum,
Iamiam faetens, tumulatum.
Vittaligat, lapis vrget,
Sed si iubes, hic resurget:
Iube, lapis reuoluetur,
Iube, vitta disrumpetur.
Exiturus nescit moras,
Si tu clamas, exiforas.
In hoc Salo, mea Ratis
Infestatur a Pyratis.
Hinc assultus, inde fluctus,
Hinc and inde mors and luctus.
Sed tu bone Nauta veni,
Post me ventos mare leni.
Fac abscendant hipyratae,
Duc ad portum salua Rate.
Infoecunda mea ficus,
Cuius ramus, ramus siccus,
Incidetur, incindetur,
Si promulgas quod meretur.
Sed hoc anno dimittatur,
Stercoretur sodiatur.
Quod si nec dum respondebit,
Flens haec dico tunc ardebit.
Vetus hostis in me furit,
Aquis mersat flammis vrit.
Inde languens and afflictus,
Tibi soli sum relictus.
Vt hic hostis euanescat,
Vt infirmus conualescat.
Tu virtutem ieiunandi,
Des infirmo, des orandi.
Per haec duo (Christo test)
Liberabor ab hoc peste.
Ab hoc peste solue mentem,
Fac deuotum poenitentem.
Da timorem quo proiecto,
De salute nil coniecto.
Da spem, fidem, charitatem,
Da discretam pietatem.
Da contemptum terrenorum,
Appetitum supernorum.
Totum Deus in te spero,
Deus es, te totum quaero.
Tu laus m^a, meum bonum,
Mea cuncta tuum donum.
Tu solamen in labor,
Medicamen in languore.
Tu in luctu mea lyra,
Tu lenimen es in ira.
Tu in arcto liberator,
Tu in lapsu releuator.
Mecum perstas in labor,
Spem conseruas in dolor,
Si quis laedit tu rependis,
Si minatur tu defendis.
Quod est anceps tu dissoluis,
Quod tegendum tu inuoluis.
Tu intrare me non sinas,
Infernales officinas.
Vbi moeror, vbi metus,
Vbifaetor, vbi fletus.
Vbi probra deteguntur,
Vbi rei confunduntur:
Vbi tortor semper caedens:
Vbi vermis semper edens.
Vbi totum hoc perenne,
Procul sit haec mors gehennae.
Me receptet Sion illa,
Sion David vrbs tranquilla.
Cuius faber Auctor lucis,
Cuius portae, lignum Crucis:
Cuius claues lingua Jesus,
Cuius ciues sine metu:
Cuius muri lapis vinus,
Cuius custos rex festinus:
In hac vrbe lux solemnis:
Ver aeternum, pax perennis:
In hac odor impleni Coelos,
In hac semper dulce melos.
Non est ibi corruptela,
Non defectus, non quaerela:
Non minuti, non deformes,
Omnes Christo sunt conformes.
Vrbs coelestis, vrbs beata,
Supra petram collocata:
Vrbs in portu satis tuto,
De longinquo te saluto:
Te saluto, te suspiro,
Te affecto, te requiro.
Quantum tui gratulentur?
Quam festiue conuiuentur?
Quis affectus eos stringat?
Aut quae gemma muros pingat?
Quis Chalcedon, quis Iacincthus,
Norunt illi qui sunt intus?
In plateis huius vrbis,
Sociatus pijs turbis.
Cum Job, Mosedech, and Elia,
Pium cantem Alleluiah.
Amen.
Meditatio piissima, de hominis miseria, and Dei misericordia, vna cum deuota

VTiucundas
Ceruus vndas,
Estuans defiderat:
Sic ad Deum,
Fontem verum,
Men's fidelis properat.
Sicut riui

Prabent refrigerium.
Ita menti

Quantis bonis,
super bonis,
Seruos tuos Domine:
Lesel aedit,
Qui recedit
A superno lumine.
Vitam laetam

Qui te quaerit reperit:
Sed laborem
and dolorem,
Metit qui te deserit.
Sipacem donas,
and coronas,
His qui tecum militant:
Cuncta lata

His qui tecum habitant.
Heu quam vana

Lusione falleris?
Cum te curis,
Nocituris,
Imprudenter ingeris.
Cur non caves
Lapsus graves,
Quos persuadit proditor?
Noc affectas
Vias rectas,
Quas ostendit Conditor.
Resipiscas
Atque discas
Cuius sis originis:
Vbi degis,
Cuius legis,
Cuius sis and ordinis:
Ne te spernes,
Sed discernes
Homo gemma regia:
Te perpende,
Et attend
Qua sis factus gratia,
Recordare,
Quis, and quare
Sis a Deo conditus:
Cuius haeres,
Nunc maneres,
Si fuisses subditus.
O mortalis,
Quantis malis
Meruisti affici,
Cum Auctori,
Et doctori
Noluisti subijci!
Sed maiores
Sunt dolores
Infernalis carceris,
Quo mittendus
Et torquendus,
Es, si male vixeris.
Cui mundus,
Est iucundus,
Suam perdit animam:
Pro re leui,
Atque breui,
Vitam perdit optimam.
Ergo cave,
Ne tam suaue
Iugum spernens Domini:
Et abiecta
Lege recta,
Seruias libidini.
Si sint plagae,
Curam age,
Vt curentur citius:
Ne si crescant
Et putrescant,
Pergas in deterius.
Ne desperes,
Nam cohaeres
Christi esse poteris:
Si carnales,
Quantum vales,
Affectus excluseris.
Si formidas,
Ne diffidas,
Sed medelam postula:
Noxam plange,

Dilue piacula.
Si viuorum,
Et functorum,

Debes scire,
Quod perire,
Non vult suum supplicem.
Preces funde,

Flendo cor humilia:
Poenitenti,
Et gementi,
Non negatur venia.
Exorando.
Et laudando,
Iesum Christum memora:
Nam delere
Potest vere,
Quaecunque facinora.
Et si quando,
Te temptando
Durus serpens laeserit:
Suspiranti,
Et oranti,
Jesus Christus aderit.
Quod si forte

Tu vicinum senseris,
Creed tamen,
Quod inuamen,

Hunc require
Qui lenire
Solet corda tristium:
Certus esto
Quod est presto,

Ipse multos
Iam sepultos

Hic auersos,
Et subuersos
Potest Deo iungere.
Ipsum ama,
Ad hunc clama,
Mentem tuam eleua:
Vt sustentet,
Et praesentet
Te ad coeli gaudia,
Ipsum cole,
Vt de mole
Criminum te liberet:
Hunc appella,
Ne processa,
Vitiorum superet.
Ipsum posco,
Quem cognosco,
Posse prorsus omnia:
Vt euellat,
Et repellat,
Cu^cta qua sunt noxia.
Ipse donet,
Vt quod monet
Eius verbum faciam:
Vt finita,
Carnis vita
Latus hunc aspiciam.
Pater Deus,
Fili Deus,
Deus alma charitas,
Per aeterna
Nos guberna,
Secla Deus Trinitas.
Amen.

OR A HANDFVLL: OR Rather a heartfull of holy meditations and prayers.

GATHERED Out of certain ancient Manuscripts, written 300. years ago, or
more.

By WILLIAM CRASHAW.

LONDON, Printed by G. E. for Leonard Becket, and are to be sold at his shop in
the Temple near the Church. 1622.

The Contents.
1. A Holy and orthodoxall confession of the Trinity: The Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost. 2. A godly confession of sins, and prayer for pardon, and
for eternal life. 3. A godly meditation of man's misery, and Gods mercy,
together with a devout prayer. 4. The manner of preparing sick persons to

An Orthodoxall Confession of God the Father.
FIrst and last, one God divine,
All men's God as well as mine.
In thy virtue all things framing,
In thy knowledge all containing.
In thine essence chiefest good,
Working all that is of good.
All supporting, all excelling,
Without all, yet in all dwelling.
All supporting, vndeiected,
All excelling, unaffected.
Without all, yet not excluded,
In all, never yet included.
Over all in Domination,
Under all in sustentation.
Comprehending all without thee,
Filling all things round about thee.
Nothing under thee can raise thee,
Naught above thee can debase thee.
Naught without gives thee dimension,
Noght within gives thee extension.
Moving all, thy self abiding,
Placed without circumscribing.
Changing time, thy self most stable,
Varying all, inuariable.
Force, necessity, nor art,
Alter thee in any part.
Time past, present, and to come,
Are one with thee, both all and some.
All the glory now thou have,
Vndiminisht aye must last.
Only thou art all fore: seeing,
Only giving all their being.
As thy wisdom did foreshow,
Thou fram'dst the elements below
A holy and orthodoxall Confession of God the Son, Jesus Christ the Savior
of Mankind.
Son, thy Fathers peer in all,
With him consubstantiall.
His figure and his splendour pure,
Creator, made a creature.
Thou our humane flesh putst on,
Thou our cause have undergone.
Temporal, yet time defying,
Ever living, yet once dying.
God and Man without illusion,
Both in one without confusion.
Thy Father like in Deity,
But not in fleshly verity.
God humanity assuming,
The same preserving, not consuming.
The Godhead in this union, yet
Of his Godhead lost no whit.
God to God and not toth'other,
Was Father, but Mary to both was Mother.
Thus both natures kept their statio^
In this wondrous Combination.
Preserving in the essence true
What was, and thence producing new.
This our Mediator is,
Our leader to the Land of bliss.
Circumciz'd, baptized by John,
Suffered, buried, and upon
The third day: whence he had descended,
He rose, and so to heaven ascended.
Whence he shall come, when time does call,
(Tho iudgd himself) to judge us al.
Of Christ again.
HE who^ Gods power for mankind,
would have borne,
Whom borne, his miracles
proclaimed have,
Who thus proclaimed, upon a
Cross was torn,
To whom thus torn, the godly
burial gave:
This borne, proclaimed, torn,
entombed King,
Gods power again, to heavenly
bliss did bring.
A True and Orthodoxall Confession of the Holy Ghost.
SPirit uncreated ever,
Never made, begotten never.
From the Persons two proceeding,
Full their equal, not exceeding.
Not preferring them in Deity,
Nor several from them in quality.
In quantity all three combine,
In quality alike Divine.
With the Father and the Son,
Never ending nor begun.
One is Father; for he begot,
The Son one borne, all men wot.
From these the spirit proceeds alone,
Thus one is three, and three are one.
Each of these is God truly,
Yet still but one, and not Gods three.
But in this Deity, I asseuer,
A Trinity united ever.
In the substance is full unity,
In the Persons perfect Trinity:
But in these that I have reckoned,
None in power is first or second.
But all as one we must adore,
Fixed and firm for evermore.
Nor in self for ever changed,
Nor from it self at all estranged.
The Conclusion, with a devout and holy Prayer.
THis is Christian faith unfeigned,
Orthodoxall, true, unstained.
As I teach all understand,
Yielding unto neither hand.
And in this my souls defense,
Reject me not for mine offense.
Though deaths slave, yet desperation
I fly in death to seek salvation.
I have no mean, thy love to gain,
But this faith, which I maintain.
This thou seeft, nor will I cease,
By this to beg for a release.
Let this sacred Salve be bound
Upon my sores, to make the^ sound.
Though man be carried forth, and lying.
In his grave and putrefying,
Bound and hid from mortal eyes,
Yet if thou bid, he must arise:
At thy will the grave will open,
At thy will his bounds are broken.
And forth he comes without delay,
If thou but once bid, Come away.
In this sea of dread and doubt,
My poor Bark is tossed about,
With storms and Pirates, far and wide,
Death and woes on every side.
Come thou Steeres-man ever blessed,
Calm these winds, that me molest.
Chase these ruthlesse Pirates hence,
And show me some safe residence.
My tree is fruitless, dry and dead,
All the boughs are withered.
Down it must, and to the fire,
If desert have his due hire.
But spare it (Lord) another year,
With manuring it may bear.
If it then be dead and dry,
Burn it, alas, what remedy?
Mine old foe assaults me sore,
With fire and water more and more.
Poor I, of all my strength bereft,
Only unto thee am left.
That my foe may hence be chased,
And I from ruins claws released.
Lord vouchsafe me every day,
Strength to fast, and faith to pray.
These 2. means thy self have taught
To bring temptations force to noght.
Lord free my soul from sins infection,
By repentances direction.
Be thy fear in me abiding,
My soul to true salvation guiding.
Grant me faith (Lord) hope and love,
Zeal of heaven and things above.
Teach me prize the world at noght,
On thy bliss be all my thought.
All my hopes on thee I found,
In whom all good things abound.
Thou art all my dignity,
All I have, I have from thee.
Thou art my comfort in distress,
Thou art my cure in heaviness:
Thou art my music in my sadness,
Thou art my medicine in my madness.
Thou my freedom from my thral,
Thou my raiser from my fall.
In my labor thou relieues me,
Thou reformes what ever grieves me.
Al my wrongs thy hand reuengeth,
And from hurt my soul defends.
Thou my deepest doubts reuealest,
Thou my secret faults concealest.
O do thou stay my feet from treading
In paths to hell and horror leading:
Where eternal torment dwells,
With fears, and tears and loathsome smells.
Where man's deepest shame is sounded
And the guilty still confounded.
Where the scourge for ever beats,
And the worm that always eats.
Where all those endless do remain,
Lord preserve us from this pain.
In Sion lodge me (Lord) for pity,
Sion David's Kingly City.
Built by him that is only good,
Whose gates are of the crosses wood.
Whose keys are Christ's undoubted word.
Whose dwellers fear none but the Lord.
Whose walls are stone, strong, quick and bright,
Whose keeper is the Lord of light.
Here the light does never cease,
Endless spring, and endless peace.
Here is music, heaven filling,
Sweetness evermore distilling.
Here is neither spot nor taint,
No defect, nor no complaint.
No man crooked, great nor small,
But to Christ conformed all.
Blessed Town, divinely graced,
On a Rock so strongly placed.
Seated sure from fear of war:
I salute thy walls from far.
Thee I see, and thee I long for,
Thee I seek, and thee I groan for.
O what joy thy dwellers taste,
All in pleasures first and last?
What full enjoying bliss Divine,
What Jewels on thy walls do shine?
Ruby, Iacinth, Chalcedon,
Known to them within alone.
In this glorious Company
In the streets of Syon; I
With Job, Moses, and Eliah,
Will sing the heavenly Alleluiah.
Amen.
A holy Meditation of man's misery, and Gods mercy, together with a devout
Prayer.
With longing cheer,
The thirsty Dear,
do seek the Brook:
In such a kind,
The faithful mind,
for God does look:
And as the Springs,
Refreshment brings,
In drought and sweat:
So God does cool,
The thirsty Soul
in all her heat.
O Lord what floods
Of glorious goods,
do thou bestow,
On those that be
Thine? blessed is he
that well does know.
Eternal bliss,
His guerdon is
that Jesus makes
His rest: but he
Reapes misery
that him forsakes.
Thou make them glorious
And victorious,
who serve thee well:
In endless joy
From all annoy
with thee they dwell.
But oh humanity,
With how great vanity,
art thou betost?
To dote in care,
On things that are
so quickly lost?
Why do thou yield,
And leave the field,
to sins invasions?
Not well respecting,
But ill rejecting,
thy Gods persuasions.
Open thine eyes,
And well advise,
of whence thou art:
Thy life, thy birth,
Thy state, thy worth,
observe each part.
From carelessness,
Thy self still bless,
O man, Gods Jewel:
How he placed thee,
And graced thee,
observe and view well.
To what intent,
Has God thee sent,
observe with care:
To whom (but Pride
Drew thee aside)
thou had been heir.
O mortal son,
Affliction
is thy due hire:
That broke the band
Of Gods command,
through vain desire.
But oh take heed,
Those pains exceed,
that rule in hell:
Whose fire so cruel,
Has those for fuel,
that live not well.
The man that joys
In worldly toys,
his soul orethrowes:
Respecting naught,
What Christ has bought
full dear God knows.
Then never grudge,
If God thee judge,
his yoke to bear:
Let not lust draw
Thee from his law,
but hold it dear.
And soon apply
His remedy,
unto thy sore:
Lest it increase,
To worse disease,
and plague thee more.
Do not despair,
Thou may be heir,
with Christ in joy:
By casting out
Corruptions root,
thy souls annoy.
Still fear thou must,
But not distrust,
and beg thy cure:
For errors weep,
Thy body keep
lowly and pure.
If to thy fear,
Thy Judge appear
with angry face:
Know he will lose
Not one of those,
that beg his grace.
Pray without rest,
And knock thy breast,
humble thy mind:
All that bewail
Their errors frail,
have pardon fign'd,
And do not spare,
In hymn and prayer,
Jesus to praise:
For mercy still,
Is at his will,
at all assayes.
And when the Devil,
The prince of evil,
attempteth thee:
Then if thou pray,
Christ will not stay
to set thee free.
Albe thou were,
To death most near,
yet still be sure:
And understand
That his high hand,
contains thy cure.
Be he thy quest,
That gives all rest,
from restless woes:
Who so adore,
And him implore,
shall come to those.
For many a one,
Dead long agone,
has he revived:
And saved more
That were before
of grace deprived.
Be all thy love,
On God above,
lift up thy spirit:
That thou may taste
The Saints repast,
through his sole merit.
And honor him,
That he from sin,
may thee deliver,
That sins increase
In thee may cease,
in prayer persevere.
On him I call,
That all in all
has in his power:
Against all harm,
Be he mine arm,
my shield, my tower.
And this lives length
Vouchsafe us strength
to keep his hest:
That at our end
We may ascend
to endless rest.
Amen.
HEre follows the means and manner how our forefathers in the time of Popery
prepared themselves and others to die, consisting first of the confession of
their faith; and secondly, of the Prayers which were made by them, and for them
in their last sickness, by which it may appear that though they were misled
by the crafty Romish Clergy, in diverse errors and superstitions; yet in the
great point of the means of salvation, they were of our religion, and were
saved by it.

Truly and verbatim englished out of the Latin, being an ancient Copy, and by
any of that side unquestioned, and heretofore in that kind published:

By W. CRASH.
Questions to be expounded to sick persons, whilst they have the use of
reason, and power to speak, to the end that if any be not so well disposed to
dye, he may be better informed and prepared: and the questions be these,
according to Anselme the Reverend Bishop.
1. Let him be asked thus:

BRother, do thou rejoice that thou shall die in the faith of Christ?

A. I do.

Q. Do thou sorrow and grieve, for that thou have not lived so well as thou
ought?

A. I do.

Q. Have thou a hearty purpose to live better, if God give thee time to live?

A. I have.

Q. Do thou believe that thou can not be saved, but by the death of Christ?

A. I do.

Q. Do thou believe that Jesus Christ the Son of God dyed for thee?

A. I do.

Q. Do thou give thanks to God therefore from thy whole heart?

A. I do.

Well then, good Brother, whilst thy soul is in thy body, give him hearty
thanks, and settle all thy assurance upon his death alone: have no confidence
in any thing else: trust thy self wholly to his passion, cover thy self
wholly with it, fasten thy whole life on his Cross, cast thy whole self into
this Sea: and if the Lord God say he will judge thee; answer thou, Lord, I
object the death of my Lord Jesus Christ, betwixt me and thy judgment:
otherwise I will not contend with thee.

And if GOD say to thee, Thou art a sinner; answer, Lord, it is so, but I set
the death of my Lord Jesus betwixt thee and my sins. If he say thou have
deserved damnation; answer, It is true, Lord, but I place the death and merits
of my Lord Jesus Christ betwixt thee and my ill deseruings, and I offer up him
and the most worthy merits of his passion, for the merits which I should have
had, but alas, have not.

If the Lord say further, that he is angry with thee, answer: Lord, thou have
cause, but I set the death and sufferings of my Lord Jesus Christ betwixt thy
wrath and my soul, Then let him say thrice, Lord, into thy hands I commit my
spirit: and if he be so weak he cannot, let the company that stand by say,
Lord, into thy hands we commend his soul. And he that does this, is safe and
sure that he shall never taste of eternal death.

Also in another old Book I find this written.
THese be the six signs upon which a man may rest confident of his Salvation.

1. If he believe the Articles of Christian faith, as many as are determined
by the Church.

2. If he rejoice to dye in the faith of Christ.

3. If he know that he have grievously offended God.

4. If he be heartily sorry for it.

5. If he resolve to forsake his sins, if God give him leave.

6 If he hope and believe to come to eternal salvation, not by his own
merits, but by the merits of Jesus Christ.

And Anselme says, that these six questions are to be asked of every one at
the time of his death, and says further thus:

Then say to the sick person, if Satan object any thing against thee, oppose
thou the merits of Christ betwixt thee and him: and thus without all doubt he
shall be saved.

This consolation of the sick, and preparation to their death, is in ancient
Copies ascribed to Anselme, who lived more then 500. years ago, even when
Popery was almost grown to perfect age.

Now if any man make question, how our fathers were saved in these later and
worse times, when Popery prevailed in a great measure; I answer, that even
almost the same preparation, and same questions were used long after Anselme,
even in the deepest darkness of Popery: for in the most evil time, about the
Council of Constance, some two hundred years ago, thus I find it written in
an ancient Book, and it is ascribed to Gerson.

Every Christian, whether secular or regular, is thus to be examined and
informed in his sickness, touching his salvation.
1 Do thou believe all the principal Articles of faith, and all that is
contained in the whole body of holy Scripture, according to the exposition of
the Catholic and Orthodoxall Doctors of the holy Church? and do thou detest
all heresies and errors, and superstitions condemned or reproved by the Church?
and art thou glad that thou die in the faith of Christ, and unity and
obedience of thy mother the Church?

2 Do thou know and confess, that thou have many ways and grievously
offended thy God and thy Creator?

3 Do thou sorrow from thy whole heart, for all thy sins committed against
Gods Majesty, his love and mercy? art thou truly sorrowful for the evils that
thou have committed, and the good that thou have omitted, and the grace that
thou have neglected? and art thou agrieued not so much for fear of death or
any punishment, as for that love that thou ought to bear toward God?

4 Do thou beg pardon for all these thy sins, of Jesus Christ, desiring
that by him thy heart may be enlightened truly to see and know thy sins,
that so thou may particularly, and more seriously repent of them?

5 Do thou propound, and resolve truly to amend thy life, if so be thou
live, and never hereafter to sin so again, but rather to lose any thing how
dear soever unto thee, yea, even life it self, then to offend thy God again?

6 Do thou also desire of God grace to continue in this purpose, that thou
may not fall again?

7 Do thou forgive from thy whole heart any that have done thee any wrong in
word or deed, for the love of Christ Jesus our Lord and Savior, and as thou
hopest for pardon from him? and do thou heartily desire to be forgiven of
all men whom thou have any way offended?

8 Will thou that there be full restitution made according to thy power, yea,
though it should extend to thy whole estate, if otherwise there cannot be
satisfaction made?

9 Do thou believe that Christ dyed for thee, and that thou can be saved
no otherwise but by the merits of Jesus Christ? and do thou give God thanks
for this from thy whole heart, as much as thou art able?

And whosoever can give true answer to these questions affirmatively, out of a
good conscience, and faith not fained: It is an evident and sufficient
testimony of salvation, and let him not doubt but if he so depart, he is one
of them that shall be saved.

Behold here (good Reader) our Religion practiced in the most misty times of
Popery: behold here the true holy Catholic and ancient way to heaven: Namely,
by Christ and his merits alone. Here is no trusting on man's merits, either our
own or others: Here is no mention of Agnus dei, or wooden Crucifixes. He is
not bid to trust in the prayers, suffrages, requiems, dirges, Masses,
Trentalls, or other obsequies that shall be said for him after his departure.
He is sent to no Angel, no nor to the Virgin Mary, for matter of Salvation:
Nay all are excluded, and Christ's death alone, even it alone is made the means
of his Salvation: And the makers hereof were so resolute, and zealous in this
point, that they used such variety of words, as though they could not
sufficiently express the excellency and the necessity of cleaving to Christ
alone in the matter of Salvation.

And if any man suspect that this is but devised by us, and falsely fathered
upon Antiquity, let him know, that not only we have the ancient Copies, whose
age will speak for themselves, but Gasper Vle^bergius in lib. de Causis. Causa
14 page: 462. editionis Colon. 1589.
even the better sort of Papists, that be learned, do know this well enough.

A learned Papist of this age writes, that in a Church in Colaine this very
book is extant (Manuscript) and that he has seen it, and that this manner of
comforting the sick, was used in former ages, and confesses that it contains
the very treasure and kernel of Christian religion. And says further, that
this manner was used not in Germany only, but over all the Christian world.
Indeed to the Jesuits I confess, this is held a ridiculous manner of
comforting the sick, (such a spirit possesses them:) Thus does Gretzer their
Champion flout us Lutherans (as he calls us) for thus doing.

The Lutherans (says he) do Iac. Gretz. in resut. Leyseri. de hist. Ord.
Jesuit.
thus comfort their sick, Relickes, Crucifixes, Agnus deis, and such matters,
are but dead things, and nothing worth, the Scripture has not a word of them:
it is therefore very ungodly to trust in them; but God is our hope, and God is
our strength: trust in him, etc. On this wise fashion do these godly
comforters comfort their sick persons.

Thus in the Jesuits judgment it is but a silly course to trust in Gods
mercy, and Christ's merits in point of salvation: hereby it may be discerned of
what spirit they are. But let them mock us, as long as with us they mock the
Scriptures, Antiquity, and the better sort of their own side: for we appeal
to this that has been said, whether this manner of comforting the sick, were
not in use long before Luther was borne.

Now if any object, that in the same books there is mention of the Crucifixe,
and that it is appointed to be in the presence of the sick person: I answer,
it is true, but not that he should worship it, (as now the Jesuits teach, and
Greg. de Valent. Gretzer Vasquez Chrysostom. a visit. etc.
all the approved Romish writers) but that it may put him in mind of Christ,
which though it be a needless superstition, yet it is not that impiety and
Idolatry, which now at this day is practiced and maintained in the Romish
Church: and my purpose is not to discharge those times, nor our forefathers in
those times of errors and superstitions, but of the idolatry, impiety, and
blasphemy of the present Church of Rome. And the same answer is also to be
given to another objection, That in the same book there are prayers to the
Saints and Angels. It is so, and from that error those ages cannot be cleared:
but withal let us still observe, that those prayers are not to help them in
matters of salvation, (as are many blasphemous prayers now usual in Popery,)
and that sin in those misty times (being a sin of ignorance) no doubt was
pardoned unto them in the mercy of God, seeing that for their reconciliation
with God, and eternal salvation, they believed to attain it only by the
merits and passion of Jesus Christ. But let not us feed on their infirmities,
but lovingly pass by them, and let this content and comfort us, that their
means of salvation, which they used and trusted unto, is the same with ours at
this day. For better testimony whereof, let us set down some of their prayers,
being such as the best Christians may use at this day with much comfort.

Certain Prayers used by our forefathers in the darkest times of Popery: in
the time of a man's sickness, some to be made for the sick, and some by the
sick person: gathered out of the same Ancient Books.
When the sick person feels his strength to fail, then let him commend his
soul to God in this prayer.
O Most high and Sovereign GOD, whose goodness and mercy is infinite. O most
glorious Trinity, which art love, and mercy, and goodness it self, have
mercy upon me most miserable sinner, for unto thee and unto thy hands I
commend my spirit: O Lord my most loving God and Father of mercies, show thy
mercy on me thy poor creature, and forsake me not in my last need: but stand
with me, and help my succourlesse soul, save my poor and desolate soul,
that it be not devoured of the infernal dogs.

O most loving Lord and sweet Savior Jesus Christ, the Son of the living
God, I beseech thee for thy honor, and by the virtue of thy most blessed
passion, command that I may be received into the number of thy Saints, and
servants, O my Savior and my Redeemer, I here yield up my self wholly unto
thee: O grant me thy grace and thy glory, vouchsafe me pardon of my sin,
and give me a portion of thy glory. But o my dear Lord, I challenge not a
place in heaven for any worthiness of mine own merits, for I am but dust and
ashes, and a most wretched sinner; but for the virtue of thy most blessed
passion, by which thou did vouchsafe to redeem me miserable man, and to
purchase heaven for me, even with the price of thy precious blood: I beseech
thee therefore by the most blessed and bitter passion which thou sustainedst on
the Cross for me, especially in that hour when thy blessed soul did leave
thy body, that thou would have mercy on my poor soul at the time of my
departure.

Then let him lift up his heart with joy and thanksgiving, and say, Lord, thou
have broken my bonds, therefore I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise.

After, if his weakness grow so, that he lose the use of his speech, let some
of the bystanders say these Prayers following, over him, or more if he l^ue so
long.
Merciful God and Father, we beseech thee for the multitude of thy mercies,
look favorably upon this thy servant (our dear brother) who with true and
hearty confession, seeks pardon for all his sins at the hand of thy mercies:
O Lord, hear us for him, and we beseech thee for him, most holy Father, to
renew in his heart whatsoever is corrupted by the frailty of his flesh, and
restore that grace, which the wily and malicious enemy the Devil has stolen
out of his soul: O Lord, recall him to the unity of thy Church, ingraft him
into the body of thy Son: O Lord, take pity of the sighs and sobs of his
soul, and groans of his heart: O Lord, look upon his tears, gather them into
thy bottle, and be good to him, who has no hope, comfort, nor confidence, but
in ^hy mercy, seal up the assu^ance of his reco^ciliation with ^hee. O most
holy father, we humbly commend the soul of this thy servant and our brother
into the hands of thy unmeasurable mercies, humbly beseeching thee, according
to the greatness of that love in which the blessed soul of thy Son did
commend it self into thy hands, that for the worthiness of that infinite love
of thine, in which thou did receive that holy soul unto thy self, thou
would vouchsafe in this our brothers last hour, to receive his poor soul
also, and make it partaker of the same love.

And thou most sweet Savior and most merciful Lord Jesus, thou that dying on
the Cross, wast so pressed with anguish and torments for us, as made thee
sound out that pitiful voice unto thy Father* My God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me? we beseech thee estrange not thy self, and turn not away thy
face from thy servant our brother, now in the hour of his souls affliction,
when his strength fails, and his spirits are so spent, that he cannot call
upon thee: hear us, o Lord, hear us for him, and for that thy glorious
victory, in which thou did triumph on the Cross, and for thy precious
passion and bitter death think of him the thoughts of mercy and not of justice:
shed thy mercies in his soul, and speak comfortably to his conscience, deliver
his soul out of all spiritual diseases, save him from the torments due unto
his deseruings, and bring him for thine own merits sake, to eternal rest. O
Lord Jesus Christ, which did redeem us with thy precious blood, write with
thine own blood in the soul, and ingraue thy wounds in the heart of this thy
servant, that in them he may see and read thy doleful sufferings, and thy
sweet love: thy sufferings, that they may be effectual to ransom him from
those sorrows, and torments, which he has merited by his sin; thy love, that
it may unite his heart to thee, in indivisible and inseparable bonds, so as he
may never be separated from thee, nor thy Saints, for ever and ever.

And Lord Jesus Christ, we beseech thee make his soul partaker of all the
merits of thy most sacred incarnation, passion, resurrection and ascension,
make him partaker of the virtue of thy most blessed Sacraments, and all thy
holy mysteries: make him partaker of all the prayers and good deeds done in thy
whole Church; make him partaker of all thy blessings, graces, and comforts of
all thy elect; and grant that with them all he may live in thy presence for
evermore: O Lord, which powredst out thy prayers for us on the Mount Oliver,
and sweatst water and blood: we beseech thee, let that precious blood of
thine, which thou did so abundantly power out for our salvation, let it be
presented and offered to thy Father, to stand against the multitude of the
sins of this thy servant, our brother: Lord be with him at his last hour,
and then deliver him from the anguish and torments which for his sins he may
justly fear. Graciously receive his soul in the hour of his departure, open
the gate of heaven unto him, and give him a portion with thy Saints in glory
for thy own most glorious merit, O Lord Jesus Christ, who with God the Father
and the holy Ghost, live, and raignest one God for evermore.

Amen.
And when the sick man's strength begins to fail, and the soul is ready to
depart, then let the soul be commended to God by one of the by standers, on
this manner.
The commendation of the Soul, to be said at a man's death.
I Here commend thee to Almighty God, most dear Brother; and I do commit thee
to him whose creature thou art: go forth therefore O Christian soul; get thee
gone out of this filthy world, go forth in the name of the Almighty Father,
who created thee: In the name of Jesus Christ, who dyed for thee: In the name
of the holy Ghost who has been powered out upon thee. And when thou, happy
soul, art delivered out of the prison of the body, the glorious Quire of
heavenly Angels meet thee, and the company of all holy Saints entertain thee,
the loving countenance and cheerful grace of Jesus Christ shine upon thee: a
merciful Judge be he unto thee, that thou may have sentence to sit for ever
amongst his Saints, on his right hand: thy dwelling be in peace, and thy
habitation in the heavenly Jerusalem for evermore: far be it from thee ever
to feel or know, how horrible the darkness, how terrible the flame, and how
intolerable the torments of hell are. Satan and all his hellish guard, be
they confounded at thy presence: and if he dare set upon thee, victory and
triumph be on thy side; shame and trembling fall upon him: from the presence of
Gods Angels be he banished, into the black mists, and confused Chaos of
eternal darkness. But let the Lord arise, and let his enemies be scattered;
as the smoke vanishes, so let them fly away. But let the just be exalted and
rejoice in the presence of the Lord: let the infernal legions not dare to
touch thee, nor presume to hinder thee, and he who disdained not to dye for
thee, be he thy Savior and deliverer from all spiritual vexation. Be the
gates of Paradise open unto thee, and thy Christ give thee thy place and
mansion in the same. And he that is the true Pastor and great Shepherd of the
sheep, acknowledge thee for one of his true sheep, and receive thee into his
fold. JESUS Christ absolve thee from all thy sins, and place thee on his
right hand amongst his elect, that there thou may see thy Redeemer face to
face, and in the society of blessed souls may enjoy the comforts of
heavenly contemplation, and the blessed vision of God for ever and ever.

Amen.
A Meditation of Saint Bernard, sweet and comfortable to forerun a happy end.

DVlcissime Jesus Christ, sit vltimum verbum tuum in cruce, vltimum verbum meum
in hac luce, and amplius fari non possum, exaudi finale cordis desyderium.

In English.
Sweet Jesus Christ, let thy last words upon thy Cross, be my last upon my
Couch, and when I can speak no more, Lord, hear the utmost desire of my heart.

To the Reader.
SEe, Christian brother, how in the worst times they were prepared to die, and
commended to God: if the Ancient Books did not proclaim this truth, some would
not believe but that they had been made in this latter time. But seeing the
truth cannot be denied. I desire thee with me to observe these few collections,
arising out of due consideration of the premises.

1 Here is answer to that great question, how our forefathers were saved, even
by the same faith as we are at this day.

2 How truly Christ performed his promise: namely, that the gates of hell
should not prevail against the true faith, for so we see that in the vilest
times this faith has been preserved.

3 Observe how here is no touch, nor once mention of Purgatory, nor of any
thing to be done for their good after this life.

4 Here is no relation to any pardons or indulgences from the Pope.

5 Here is no necessity laid down of sending for a Priest to bring his host,
and his Pix, and his Holy Water, and his Taper: These matters, it seems, are
rather commanded and pressed upon the people, by the Romish Clergy, then much
regarded by the wiser and god her sort of our forefathers: neither are they
commanded to stay till the Priest come, but (says the book) let these prayers
be said, and the commendation of his soul, by one of the bystanders.

Lastly, let it be observed, that in all these prayers, and commendations, and
questions (and these says the book are all that be of necessity to be said)
here is not one smack of Popish Idolatry or superstition.

In these respects I have thought it no needless labor to communicate these
to thee (dear brother,) I know there be store of godly Prayers and meditations
already extant. But these are of a special use more then others, and are
venerable for their antiquity, and are to be the more welcome, because God
preserved them in the hands of our very enemies. And though they were mingled
with other things not so good; yet let us know as S. Hierome tells us, that it
is no small point of wisdom, to seek out gold out of mire and clay. Make use
of these, and help me with thy prayers, and thou shall shortly, if God
permit, be partaker of more.

Hereafter follows an addition of some new and late forms, and models of
Prayer for sundry occasions, and purposes.
At thy vprising, thus, or in like manner commend thy self to God, saying.
GRant, O good Father, that of thy mercy have brought me to the beginning of
this day, that in this same I may rise, and so walk in my calling, that thy
name may be glorified, my conscience discharged, thy servant comforted, and all
good men encouraged by my example, for thy dear Sons sake, Amen.

Before thy going out, thus meditate.
Morning Meditation.
1 THat many have gone out of their houses abl^ and well, that have never
returned back alive, as for ought thou know may befall thee.

2 Remember that thy conscience shall be the quiet^^ in the night, when thou
sh^^ call to mind thou have beg^^ in the Lord, and so careful^ discharged thy
duty in t^^ day.

3 That to go forth in ^ the world, is to encounter with many troubles, to
pass some dangers, and to perform many duties, and therefore rush not forth
into such an undertaking, before thou have thus, or in like manner prayed to
God to assist thee, without whose blessings and favor toward thee, thou
undertake in vain, for thy labor will not prosper.

That done, thou may thus further call upon God in thy Morning Prayer.
MOst gracious God, and merciful Father, we render unto thee most humble and
hearty thanks for all thy benefits thou have from time to time bestowed upon
us, as for the quiet rest and repose thou have this night given us, to the
refreshing and strengthening of our wearied bodies, and minds; so we beseech
thee likewise being thus renewed, and taken up from that image of death, that
laid us in our beds, the representation of our graves, to consider the waste of
time, our own lives, and decay of all sublunarie things, how with their easy
lengths, their spannes and fadomes, since the commandment was first given, Let
there be day, and night, and times, and seasons: they have brought age and
maturity, the sithes and sickles that have reaped down whole haruests of
flesh, and laid generations in the dust. Teach us, O Lord, with this
remembrance to weigh our mortality, and so to frame our lives and actions
thereafter, that whenever thy good will and pleasure is to bind up our bones
in peace and rest, we may yield up our souls and bodies into thy hands with
full confidence and assurance that our sins are washed away in the blood of
that pure and immaculate Lamb, Christ Jesus, and shall not condemn us. And to
that end prosper us we pray thee, in all our actions, and give good success
to our true endeavors, and then we shall not attempt in vain: and grant that
this day, and all the days of our life hereafter, may be so accomplished by
thy counsel, favor, and direction, that we may so bear our selves throughout
this vale of misery, that at the last we may reign with thee in glory.

Amen.
Evening Meditations before thy going to bed.
1 REmember that many go to bed, and never rise again, till they be awaked
by the sound of the last Trumpet; and therefore presume not to close thine
eyes, till thou have committed thy self into the hands of God by Prayer.

2 At the putting off of thy clothes, think that the day is coming, when
thou must be as barely vnstript of al thou have, as thou do now thy self of
thy clothes.

3 Fixing thine eyes upon thy bed, let it put thee in mind of thy grave; thy
bed-clothes, of the mold of the earth, that must cover thee; the sheets, of
thy winding sheet; thy sleep thy death; thy waking, thy resurrection.

Then at thy lying down, thou may thus address thy self up to God, saying:
Into thy hands, most merciful Father, I commend my soul and body this night
and evermore: be merciful, gracious and good unto me, bless^ me, save me,
preserve and keep me for thy dear mercy sake.

Amen.
Or thus further with David thou may pray.
I Will lay me down and rest in peace in thy mercy for it is thou Lord only
that make me dwell in safety.

Evening Prayer to be said either before or after thy going into bed.
O Eternal God, and omnipotent Father, which art the Lord of heaven and earth,
of Angels and men, principalities, and powers, light and darkness, day and
night, in whose hands i^ contained that ouerflow o^ goodness, that fills al^
the empty and indigent creatures in the world, who ordainest times and seasons*
successions and descents, old age and childhood, a beginning and an ending, a
rest and labor, a perpetual motion and change over all things in the world:
the lively witness whereof is this day, which not many hours since broke out
of darkness, and cleared the world with her light, and the Sun arose as a
Bridegroom out of his Chamber, and rejoicing as a Giant to run his course,
whose beams are now steeped in darkness, the true resemblance of all earthly
glory, and transitory pleasures and delights, which have their increase, their
height and sudden decrease again, being no continuance in any thing under the
Sun: and by this motion and change, the time is now come that thou have
appointed for rest, which, O Lord, so give unto us, we pray thee, that thereby
we may be enabled to walk more carefully in those duties and callings thou
have appointed us. And further we beseech thee, that as the night darkneth and
shadoweth al things, that they are unseen: so for thy dear Christ's sake, thou will hide all our sins from thy sight, that they never be brought to
judgment with us; ever so remembering us, that we never forget that fearful
and final account that must be rendered unto thee, at the day of thy
appearing: that as our bodies having the rest of sleep this night, so our
minds, through thy mercy in Jesus Christ, may enjoy the rest of a quiet
conscience for ever: and to that end let thy mercy and providence, so watch
over us, that as our actions in the day, so our thoughts, nor our imaginations,
neither watching, nor sleeping this night, may be such as may displease thee;
but that all may tend to the good of our souls and bodies, and the honor and
glory of thy great name, and that for Christ Jesus sake, Amen. In whose most
blessed name we conclude this our imperfect Prayer, in that absolute form of
Prayer that thy blessed Son has taught us to honor thee, saying: Our Father,
etc.

A godly Prayer to be said at all times.
O Lord my God, what may I render unto thee as an acceptable sacrifice, for all
the benefits thou have bestowed upon me? for my Election, Redemption,
Sanctification, and Preservation from my youth unto this present day, and
hour; that thou have endued me with health, strength, knowledge, continency,
when so many more worthy then I, in mine own eyes, are denied of these thy
good favors: for all which I can give no reason for, but thy good pleasure*
and if thou should take all back again, I have nothing to say, but that
thou art just: yet* O Lord, to these many I entreat thee add this more, that
I may keep a heart that may truly acknowledge them, and a tongue that may
thankfully praise thee for them all the days of my life: and to that end I
beseech thee, protect me from all evil that may hurt me, from all sin that
may offend thee: be thou assistant to all my good in deuors, purposes, and
intentions, and let thy good Spirit so rule my heart, that all that I shall
do, think or speak, may be to thy glory, and the good of all men: give me, O
Lord, a charitable heart to relieve thee in thy members, a compassionate heart,
to make other men's infirmities mine own; a believing heart, that thy promises
are yea, and Amen. And so blind me not, O Lord, with the carnal man, that
though I believe thou will one day raise my body from the bed of darkness,
when thou shall say to the sea, Give; and to the earth, Restore my sons and
daughters; when no creature shall be able to keep back one bone that it has
received, that I should despair in thee for a crust of bread in temporal
maintenance, and endeavor. Be near, O Lord, unto all such as faithfully call
upon: thy name, comfort all such as be sick, or comfortless, and by daily and
hourly presidents of death, and mortality before mine eyes; teach me to be
mindful of mine own end, and to make my preparation by faith, and repentance
thereafter; that whether I live, or die, I may rest with thee in thy eternal
glory, through Jesus Christ, my only Savior and Redeemer.

Amen.
Agurs prayer for content.
O Lord, give me neither ^^^erty, nor riches; feed me with food convenient,
lest I be too full, and deny thee; and say, who is the Lord? or lest I be poor
and steal, and so take the name of my God in vain; and if I ask any thing
which is evil, deny my ignorance; if I ask any thing which is good, remember
thy promise.

S. Augustines Prayer.
Miserere mei Domine, indigna facientis, and digna patientis.

English.
BE merciful unto me, O God, doing unworthily unto thee; and yet receiving
that from thee, that more worthy then I are denied at thy hands; O Lord
continue this mercy, and let not my illness weary out thy goodness, for thy
tender patient mercies sake.

Amen.
A Thanksgiving unto God the Father.
LEt all true Christians say, and acknowledge with one heart, and mouth: say
also with them, O my soul, say in this mortal body, without this mortal
body, Glory, honor and praise be unto thee, most merciful God, throughout
all ages and generations of the world, which have not spared thine only
Son, but offered him up a bleeding sacrifice, for the sins of thy people,
given him to death, even to the death of the Cross, for most wretched
mankind, to that end that through him, we might be saved, and delivered from
destruction, and brought into the liberty of everlasting life: grant unto us,
by thy Spirit that we may perfect, and continue in this thy grace and favor,
for ever and ever. Amen.

Another short eiaculatory prayer English and Latin.
ODeus omnium miserationum, Pater, te praecor vt abissus misericordiae tuae
absorbeat abissum peccatoru^ meorum.

O Father of goodness and mercy, I humbly entreat thee, that the depth of thy
mercy may swallow up the depth of my sins.

Martin Luthers Prayer.
Confirm in us, O God, that which thou have wrought, and finish the work thou
have begun in us, to the glory of thy name, and the saving of our souls at the
dreadful day of thy visitation, for thy dear mercies sake. Amen.

A few short remembrances, or most material rules of good life, for the
practice of every true Christian, here inserted.
1. Fear God: for not to fear him, is to fear every thing.

2. Love thy brother: for if thou love not him whom thou have seen, how shall
thou love him whom thou have not seen?

3. Be charitable to the poor, which is to relieve Christ in his members, and
be not greatly curious, so thou know them no notorious ill livers; for if
Lot, had been so in the entertainment of his strangers, he had not received
Angels in stead of men: and withal, because it is better to give many
counterfeits, then that one truly needy should depart vnreliued.

4. Swear not, but what thou truly know: as to manifest a doubtful truth,
and that upon urgent occasion; for by an oath may God be greatly honored, or
dishonored. Honored, as when we shall bring him to testify a truth, which is
himself the God of truth: dishonor, when we bring him to witness a falsehood,
which whosoever does, the Lord will not hold him guiltless. And to avoid this,
make conscience of thy word, and it shall be to thee as a oath: for it is the
man that gives credit to the oath, more then the oath to the man.

5 Persuade thy self, rather then thy friend, to keep thy counsel: and
whatsoever discord shall arise betwixt thee and him; as thou tenderest the
reputation of an honest heart, never let malice in hatred make thee to reveal,
that which love and friendship before bound thee to conceal.

6 Hate no man, no not thy enemy, lest God love him; for to hate where he
loves, is a fearful opposition.

7 Whatsoever is dear unto thy body, forbear it, being any way prejudicial
to thy soul.

8 Desire in any thing, rather to be in substance without show, then in show
without substance.

9 Desire to live godly: though poorly in this world, for he that ungodly
dies rich, shall have many mourners to his grave, but few comforters at his
judgment.

10 Think of God with wonder, speak to God with reverence, serve him in love,
obey him in fear, and do nothing, but as in his presence and sight, and thou
shall live the life of the godly, and go the way of the blessed, live in his
fear, and die in his favor.

In laudem operis and Authoris.
What attribute's worth
thy deserving pain,
(Dear friend)
since thy endeavor blesses us,
Whose serious hours,
spent only to reclaim
The stubborn, st^ffe-
neckt, and idolatrous?
For what their fathers
gathered with much care,
For holy penitential legacies,
Children pervert the deads
will, and prepare,
Hardness of heart
for their Apostasies.
Go boldly forwards,
though they judge like Dan,
Our people with the
gall of bitterness:
Yet unto them be a Samaritan,
Power oil into their wounds
with cheerfulness:
And blessed be thy endeavor,
and each thought,
Till to the promised Land
thy spirit be brought.
W. Lort.

A conclusion to the Author and his Book.
TRadition and antiquity the ground,
Whereon that erring
Church does so rely,
Breaks out to light,
from darkness to confound
The novel doctrine
of their heresy,
Which plainaby these
most sensible degrees,
Does point the ways
it has digrest to fall;
Where each observing
judgment plainly sees,
From good to bad,
from bad, to worst of all
It is arrived:
so that it can aspire,
Obscure, deface, suppress, do what it may,
To blind this truth
to no step any higher,
By any policy
it can essay.
These holy Hymns
stuffed with religious zeal,
And meditations
of most pious use,
Able their whole to wound,
our wounded heal:
Free from impiety,
or least abuse,
Blot out all merit,
in our selves we have,
And only, solely,
do on Christ rely.
Offer not prayers
for those are in the grave;
Nor unto Saints that hear not,
do not cry.
Then in a word,
since God has these preserved
From the Inquisitors
most cruel rage,
Though in their worth
they else might have deseru'^
To pass among the good
things of this age:
Yet are in this respect
of more regard,
Since God would have them
to these times appear,
So many having perished,
and be heard
With more true zeal,
that God has kept so dear.
By all which I conclude:
from thine own heart,
Thou wicked servant,
that might know and would no^
He has discharg*d himself
in all and part;
That would have cured
your Babel, but he could (...)
