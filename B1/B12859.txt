By the King.
A Proclamation declaring His Majesty's grace to His Subjects for their
relief against public Grieuances.
THE Kings most Excellent Majesty, calling to His remembrance the many
complaints in the late conuention of Parliament, as well by sundry of the House
of Commons, as by others His subjects of several parts of this Realm, not
only against Monopolies and other like Patents, but also concerning many other
grieuances, some touching the administration of Justice, and excessive fees
taken in His Majesty's Courts, others concerning trade and commerce, and many
others of several natures and qualities; And His Majesty (desiring above all
things, to yield ease and comfort to His people) by memorable examples of
Justice, and also by sundry Proclamations, Commissions, and other Acts, and
Orders made by himself, and His Privy Council, not only sitting the
Parliament, and in the times of the adiournement thereof, but also since the
dissoluing and breaking up of the same, Has fully declared His earnest
affection and constant resolution to provide fitting remedies for all those
evils, which may tend to the hurt of His people. And more especially calling to
mind, That by His Royal Proclamation, dated the tenth day of July, in the
nineteenth year of His Reign, He did publish and declare, That both His own,
and the ears of His Privy Council should be open to the modest and just
complaints of His people, as well concerning Monopolies, and other Patents of
evil nature and consequence, as concerning other grieuances against the
public; His Majesty continuing the same His Gracious and Princely
disposition, which is not confined unto Times and Meetings in Parliament, but
at all seasons, and upon all occasions watches over the public weal of His
Kingdoms, has (for the remoouing of all ambiguities and doubts, which might
discourage and deter His people from taking hold of that His Princely offer,
as though in His Majesty's intention it were limited or restrained to any
certain times, or to particular grieuances) thought fit hereby again to
inuit His subjects to embrace His gracious and Princely favor, for the
releeuing of them in whatsoever their just grieuances, and that in a more easy
and ready way then has been propounded at any time heretofore; not doubting
but His loving subjects (well weighing His abundant goodness and care toward
them) will apply themselves unto His Majesty for their relief, in such a
modest and temperate course, as may tend to the glory of His government, their
own weal and tranquillity, and the utter abolishing of all those private
whisperings and causeless rumors, proceeding from particular humor, which,
without giving to his Majesty any opportunity of reformation by particular
knowledge of any fault, serve to no other purpose but to occasion and blow
abroad coffeehouse. And therefore His Majesty does hereby publish and
declare, That He has appointed George, Marquess of Buckingham, Lord High
Admiral of England, Thomas, Earl of Arundell and Surrey, Earl Marshall of
England, William, Earl of Pembroke, Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's
household, Lancelot, Bishop of Winchester, and William, Bishop of S. David,
select and principal persons, authorizing and requiring them, or any two or
more of them, to sit once a week, at least, at His Majesty's Palace of
Whitehall, to receive the petitions and complaints of His loving subjects
concerning their just grieuances, and to certify the same to himself, or His
Privy Counsel, as shall be fittest for due redress: Wherein His Majesty does
declare, That as it is not His intent, that matters of ordinary nature or
consequence should be drawn thither, but left to the proper Courts of Justice,
which have conusance thereof: So His Majesty does not restrain their
complaints to any particular sort of grieuances, but is well pleased that His
subjects may freely resort thither, for any notable oppression, exaction,
bribery, or other grieuance, where the quality of the offense, or eminency of
the person, or office of the offendour may require an extraordinary proceeding.
Nevertheless, his Majesty does admonish, that under color thereof, no man
presume to present there any causeless clamours, which if they shall do, they
must expect to be punished with the same severity, which their complaints aimed
and endeavored unjustly to draw on others.

Given at the Court at Theobaldes, the foureteenth day of February, in the
twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

most Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXII
