By the King.
A Proclamation concerning Starch.
IT is not unknown to most of our loving Subjects, That in the time of the
late Queen of famous memory, the making of Starch within this Realm of
England, being a thing newly taken up, and grown in few years very frequent,
and to be much used, the inconvenience thereof was found to be so great, by
the wasting and consuming of Corn fit for peoples food, That many
Proclamations were then made from time to time, for the repressing and utter
abolishing of the same. Howbeit, afterward some particular persons, having
procured a special License, as well for the making of Starchwithin the Realm,
as also for bringing in the same from Foreign parts, the liberty of the
Subject was so prejudiced, by reducing of that into few men's power, which in
the Common liberty of the Subject was free to all, That much offense did arise
thereby, Insomuch as the said Grant, being afterward by her, in favor to the
Subjects, taken away upon the Complaints of the grieuance arising thereby, and
the making of that stuff within this Realm being then left to the liberty of
all men to use it at their pleasure, the same has ever sithence been continued
in many places of this Realm. In which small time of continuance, it falls
out by experience, that the Toleration thereof to be made here, is accompanied
with so much offense to our people, as we perceive by the Information which
thereof we have received, That her intent and purpose to repress the making
thereof, and to take away the inconvenience of the same, was not without good
cause and just ground. For it appears by collection gathered, That the waste
of Corn spent and consumed in the making of this Stuff in most places of this
our Realm, is so excessive, as it is not fit to be spared from peoples Food,
to serve in so vain and slender an use; For that it cannot be, but the
spending thereof in Starch (especially in times wherein the plenty of Corn
shall not be very abundant) must needs increase both the scarcity, and the
prices thereof, above that which is fit to be suffered. And further it
appears by the Complaints and Certificats, to Us and our Council sent from
diverse Justices of the Peace of several parts, (especially about our City of
London, and the Counties near adjoining) That the making thereof is not
without exceeding annoyance to the people dwelling near the places where it is
made, by reason of the noisome stench, and unsavory smells arising of and by
the same: which breeding infectious aires, cannot but increase most contagious
Sicknesses and diseases, especially in these times of common Infection: A
danger fit to be prevented, in that providence which we owe to the welfare of
our people, as in every part of the Realm generally, so especially in our City
of London, being our Chamber, the ordinary place of our abode for the best part
of the year, and of the resort of all sorts of our Subjects for their
necessary affairs.

Which incommodities, having been by Us, with the advice of our Council,
thoroughly considered, We had a determination for the redress thereof, and for
the policy of our Realm, utterly to take away the making of Starch within it,
of what Stuff, or under what pretense soever. Nevertheless, upon the humble
suit of a great number of our loving Subjects lately made unto Us, it being
apparent, that the utter abolishing and taking away thereof, would be a great
hinderance to them in their trades, and bereave many of them of the means of
their necessary living and maintenance; And being likewise informed, that there
may well be spared, both in our City of London, Westminster, and other the
great Cities and Towns of the Realm, great quantities of Branne, and other
such courser Stuffes, of which the best and finest Starch is usually made; We,
tendering the good and benefit of our said Subjects, and being well pleased, in
our Princely care and desire of the Public good, to yield unto them the
liberty and free use of their needful Trades, and of all due and convenient
means of their necessary maintenance, And yet holding it as fit and needful
to provide for the redress of all abuses and inconveniences, growing both by
the needless wasting of the store of Corn within our Realm, and also by the
public annoyance and offense given unto our Subjects, by the noisome making of
Starch in most places of our Kingdom as aforesaid, Have therefore, with the
advice of our Council, thought it good to give authority unto certain
persons of good quality and credit, by Commission under our great Seal of
England, from time to time to view and survey, and allow all places and houses
within any part (...) ^^r Kingdom, where any Starch is or shall be made, and
with the assistance of the Mayor, or chief Magistrate of that place which
shall be next adjoining to any such place of Starch-making, to see that none be
from henceforth made of Wheat, but only of clean Branne, and such like
courser stuff; And that none shall be made in any such place, as may be to the
just annoyance and offense of our loving Subjects, but only in such places,
and in such order, as by the discretion and appointment of our said
Commissioners, and such Magistrates next adjoining, shall be thought fit.

And to the end all men may thereof take knowledge, and may conform themselves
thereunto accordingly, we have thought it meet to publish our pleasure herein
by Proclamation, willing and commanding all manner of persons whatsoever, that
now do or shall hereafter use the making of Starch within any place of this our
Kingdom wheresoever, presently from henceforth to forbear to make any more
starch of wheat, either whole, bruised, or gross grounden, or of meal,
Rubbles, or any such like stuff. And we do also will and command all persons
whatsoever, to forbear and surcease the making of any starch in any place or
places of this our Realm of England whatsoever, except only in such places as
by the view, allowance, and appointment of our said Commissioners thereunto by
us to be ordained, with the assistance of the Magistrates as aforesaid, shall be
thought fit and convenient, upon pain not only of the forfeiture of all such
Starch so made contrary to our express will and pleasure hereby signified, of
which the one half shall be to the party seizing the same, and the other
half to Us, our Heirs and Successors, but also to incur such further
punishment as for their contempt in a matter tending so much to the good and
benefit of our people, shall be thought fit to be inflicted upon them.

And We do also require all Justices of peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes,
Headboroughes, and all other our Officers, Ministers, and loving Subjects
whatsoever, that they be from time to time ayding and assisting to our said
Commissioners, or such person or persons as shall be by them deputed and
appointed to see this our Ordinance executed, and that they be careful every
one within his charge to cause this our pleasure to be obeyed, and to
interrupt and suppress all persons who shall attempt to make any Starch
otherwise, or in any other places then such as shall be so allowed and
appointed as aforesaid, after the publishing of this our pleasure to the
contrary. And also to seize their stuff, or to dispose and destroy the same
as things noisome and offensive to all our people. And for the doing thereof,
these shall be to you and every of you a sufficient Warrant.

And furthermore for Us, our Heirs and Successors we will and command, That
all persons now using to make Starch in any part of this our Realm of England,
having a desire to continue the same, of Branne and Pollard only, upon the
publishing of this our Proclamation, if they dwell within forty miles of our
City of London, upon the last day of September next ensuing, and if their
dwelling be further off, then upon the last day of October now next following
shall make their repair, or cause their names to be given and sent up in
writing unto our said Commissioners, at the Fownders Hall in London, together
with a Certificate from some Justice of peace, or from the Mayor, or chief
Magistrate of the City, Town, or place in or near where their dwelling is,
signifying thereby their desire and intent to continue the making of Starch as
aforesaid, to the intent our said Commissioners may take order for the same
according to our pleasure hereby signified and expressed. And if any person or
persons now using to make Starch shall neglect, or refuse to make their
repair, or to give up his or their names with such Certificate in writing, so
signifying his or their desire, and intent to continue the making of Starch as
aforesaid, Our will and pleasure is, that all and every such person and
persons shall for ever after be deprived of the liberty to make any Starch of
any stuff whatsoever.

Given at Salisbury the 23. day of August, in the fifth year of our Reign of
Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save the King.

Majesty. ANNO DOM. 1607.
