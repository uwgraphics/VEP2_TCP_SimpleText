JAMES, By the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc. To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops,
Archdeacons, Deanes, and their Officials, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all
spiritual persons: And also to all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs,
Bayliffes, Constables, Churchwardens and Headboroughs: And to all Officers of
Cities, Boroughes, and Towns corporate: And to all other our Officers,
Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever they be, as well within Liberties, as
without, to whom these presents shall come, greeting.

WHEREAS we are credibly given to understand by a Certificate under the hands
of our Right trusty and well-beloved Robert Lord Willoughby, sir Peregrine
Bartie, sir William Armyne, and sir John Hatchet Knights, Henry Hale, and
Thomas Butler Esquiors, Justices of the Peace within our County of Lincoln:
That our poor Subject Henry Thomson of Edenham in our said County Minister,
has always been a man of honest life and conversation, and very diligent and
watchful in the place whereunto it pleased God to call him, who for the space
of Twenty years and upwards very zealously and industriously preached the word
of God unto the people, and proved a careful Pastor over the Flock committed
to his charge, freely feeding them with that Spiritual food wherewith God had
endued him, to their good, and his great comfort, but he is now fallen into
great want and poverty by reason of many crosses, and losses, wherewith it has
pleased God to visit him, as with sickness, suertiship, and such like: but
especially by reason of a lamentable and fearful Fire, happening on the Eight
and Twentieth day of December, in the year of our Lord God 1610, which consumed
and burnt in the night time his Barn (being twenty yards long, and one and
twenty foot wide,) full of Corn, together also with a Stable thereunto
adjoining, and many other necessaries, which Barn will not be repaired for a
Hundred Pounds, besides the loss of all his Corn and other goods, to the
utter undoing of our said poor Subject, who has consumed that small
remainder of his estate, in the time of his sickness, which has continued
ever since this lamentable accident, whereby he was not able to seek for any
relief until this present, And now being destitute of all Spiritual
promotion, is no way able to sustain his poor Wife, and Children, who live in
great want, and hereafter are like to perish for want of things necessary,
unless the charitable benevolence of our loving and well disposed Subjects be
somewhat bountifully extended toward them in this their great extreamitie.

KNOW ye therefore, that we (tendering the lamentable and distressed estate of
our said poor Subject) Of our especial Grace and Princely compassion, have
given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents do give and grant unto
our said poor Subject Henry Thomson, and to his Deputy or deputies the bearer
or bearers hereof, full ^ower, license, and authority to ask, gather, receive,
and take the Alms and charitable benevolence of all our loving subjects
whatsoever inhabiting within our Counties of Lincoln, Leicester, and
Northampton, with our Cities ^f Lincoln and Peterborough: And in all other
Cities, Towns corporate, privileged places, Parishes, Vil^ages, and in all
other places whatsoever within our said Counties, and not elsewhere, for and
toward the new ^lding of his said Barn, the recovery of his losses, and the
relief and maintenance of himself, his poor Wife, ^d Children.

WHEREFORE we will and command you and every of you, that at such time and
times as the said Henry Thomson, or his Deputy or Deputies ye bearer or bearers
hereof, shall come and repair to any your Churches, ^happels, or other places
to ask, and receive the gratuities and charitable benevolence of our said
Subjects, ^etly to permit and suffer them so to do, without any manner your
lets or contradictions. And you the said Parsons, ^ars, and Curats, for the
better stirring up of a charitable devotion, deliberatly to publish and declare
the Tenor of ^se our Letters Patents unto our said subjects, Exhorting and
persuading them to extend their liberal contri^tions in so good and charitable
a deed. Any Statute, Law, Ordinance, or provision heretofore made to the
con^ry in any wise notwithstanding.

IN witness whereof we have caused these our Letters to be made Patents for
the space of One whole year next ^er the date hereof to endure. Witness our
self at Westminster the Eleventh day of February, in the Tenth ^e of our
Reign of England, France, and Ireland; and of Scotland the Six and Fortieth.

Steward,

God save the King.
