Corrant out of Italy, Germany, etc.
From Room the 5. of December.
BY Civita Vechia / are passed by some certain Captames / who have convoyed the
Duke of Offuna in to Spain / the foresaid Captames shall serve in the
Catholic Armado against the Spring / which shall com to gither at Messina.

The Cardinal Borgina / is earnest at Napels / to receive the usua^ gift /
which the sam Kingdom does present every 2. years unto the King of Spain / he
has also caused the Beutylitie to com together about the same.

The Prince of Daudemont who is here present / does view all things / has
been the last Monday in the Castle S. Angelo / and gave the Soldiers 200
Crowns.

From Lions in France, the 6 hereof.
The extraordinary Venetians Ambassador has had Audience by the King of
France / and seeing his Comm^ssion does concern the Businesses in Veltan /
and that the Crown of France depends much upon the same / therefore it is
thought that the said Ambassadoure shall have A speedy Answer.

Because the Speech goes that the King will Admit those of the Religion at
Rochell and else where in his dominions no assembl^s / therefore those Cities
of the Religion strengthen them selves daily / in the mean while they have
sent their Deputies to his Maj. at Court.

From Venice, the 11. hereof.
The last Monday arrived here 11 Ships laded with woll and other Marchandises
/ from Alicanten.

The King of Spain has desired of all the Princes of Italy / that they should
have in A readiness those Soldiers which they are indebted / to assu^ him with
and against the soring should com to gither 7000 horse and footmen under the
command of the Millanes.

Advise out of Switserland that the Cantons have begone another Meeting day at
Vessel and received the French Ambassador very Lordly / there proposition / is
that they will shake of friendship with Spain / and eleave only to France /
they hope through such means to get Veltolin again / and likewise to bringhe
other Matters in quietness / because the King of Spain with the Nobility
seek only but a free pas to Tyrol.

From VVeenen, the 12 hereof.
Bethlem Gabor Requires 500. Musquettiers for his guard / and many Hungarians
gather togother and do intend to go in to Moravia to help them / the General
Breyner lies at Bruck / And there are 300 Soldiers frosen dead again in the
snoe / and likewise so many slain / besides those that are taken Prisoners and
sent to Presburgh.

It is confirmed out of Poland / that the same Camp is wholly overthrown of
the Turks / and the Tarters do great harms through burning and roving.
Therefore A Meeting day at Marschow is kept. In like manner Bethlem Gabor does
threaten these Lands / if they make not peace.

The Lord of Seratin / is as a Moravish Ambassador arived here uppo^ certain
condition it is hoped that he comes to make peace / the Earl of Buequoy lies
at the Fronters of Moravia / what he will bring to pass / time will reveal.

The Emperors Journey is prorogued fom few days / because it is understood
that the Duk of Beyeren / and the Duke of Nieuburghe are expected here with
the first / it seems they shall be made Gouvernours in Bohemia.

From Prage, the 14 hereof.
The Mintmaster is some few days since fetched out of the quoyning house by the
Gouverneur of the City and with soldiers / and carried in to the Counsel
House / there to be kept in hold.

Seeing the Emperors Strangs Soldiers have done great hurt here this 5.
weeks with roving and spoiling therefore the Duke of Lichtensteen ha^h caused
proclamations to be set A broad / and for bidden the foresaid roving upon
great punishment / also published that those that will com together to buy and
sell / and Trafficque may travail in safty. And has published citations /
that all the Bohemish States that are gone away must upon forfet of their
honor and goods appear upon the appointed time.

Here is arrived a Post from weenen / with Letters from the Emperor to the
Duke off Lichteusteen / and the speech goes that the Emperor will shortly com
hither / to keep a meeting day in Bohemia / and to set the whole Kingdom in
the former state and rest / there after should also be A Parliament.

From Pilsen, the 15 hereof.
After that the States of Bohemia had sat in Counsel concerning our payment /
and the Earl of Mansvelt besides other artikels unto the said States / he
desired 12. hundred thousand Florijns / but there is profferd them 800 thousand
Florijns / of Don Mertin / and the City there upon to be give^ over to the
Emperor / and because the tresuror of the Emperor is arived here two days
Agon / but has not brought the foresaid promised payment with him / therefore
the Earl of Mansvelt has commanded all the Captains / to make timber ready
to fortify the City / so thar the accord is wholly broken again.

This City is strongly fortyfied / and is daily made stronger / and hier
stand 13 very fair pieces of ordnaunce / and here is as yet noe want of
provision / in the mean while these Soldiers run daily out / bring in great
store of cattle / so that a Cow is soulde for half a floryne / and an Sheep
for 12 Krijtsers.

The Earl of Mantsvelt should go to Savoy / and does cause his Bagadge to be
sent to Amberghe alreddy / and seeing that certain encouradgements are com
from Amberge hither / that the Earl Sigmont of Brandenburg is exspected daily
to com hither / with 500 thousand Florijns for the Earl of Mantsvelt and for
payment of the Soldiers.

Who begin to be encouradged thereby: after the arrivement of the foresaid /
the Earl of Mantsvelt shall go forward on his journey and the said Earl of
Bra^denburg besides the Earl of Leeuwensteen shall be made General. And seeing
our King has 36000 men together in Moravia / and that Betlem Gabor shall com
to him with 40000 men / and that the Moravians and Sylesians have gathered A
great some of money / so shall not this City be given over / and if so be the
united do hold them by our King^ then there is good hope / that there cause
shall have a good end.

From Francfott the 23 hereof.
A few days agon are 1000 horsemen / and 500 Musquettiers of Marquis Spinola
folk set over the Rijne with 4 pieces of ordnaunce / they give to understand
that they will visit some villadges that ly in Wetteraw be longing to the
Palsgrave / as also the Graveship Hannaw.

This night they have been at Wassenheym belonging to the Lantgrave Mauritius
of Hessen / also at Niewe^haen and there abouts / which is the Palsgraves /
they do great hurt / and in the mean while are those Towns wherein ly
Spannish Garrishon very highly taxed / Oppenheym must give 5000 Dallers / and
other Towns and jurisdictions pro rato.

From VVeenen, the 16. December.
The Duke of Saxen is arriveded here yesterday about noone / he says that
Iglou have given themselves over unto the Emper: and those 700 Soldiers which
lay there in / have sworn to the Emperor.

Also the Emperors Armey have parted them selves in to two Companies / the on
being under the Duke Marimilian of Lichtesteen merched to Zuaim in Moravia /
and the other under the General Diepenbach is Marched against.

Brin also in Moravia / what they will bring to pass / time will re veale / for
the Moravians ly in the said Cities very strong.

At Tirna / there is question fallen betwixt Betlem Gabor and the Nobles of
Hungaria / about the caring away of the Crown from Presburge / which the said
Betlem has promised to bringh thither again / he reports also amongst other
things that he will remain on the King of Bohemias side.

From Prage, 16 hereof.
The old Earl of Turn is at this present with in Tabor / for fear that the
same City should give themselves over to the Emperor / and that then it
should go with them as with those of Prage / he has nine thousand men with
in Tabor / the which he has paid 4. months wages / and is resolved to defend
himself to the uttermost toe / the speech goes that the Moravians have taken
in Cremys.

From Keulen the 26 hereof.
We understand that the Marquis Spinola has command from the Emperor / to
Procla^me all those Cities for enemies / that have given themselves in to the
Union / he has ceased upon some certain waggens loaded with Merchandises going
to toward Straufburghe / and sent them to Oppenheym / he does purpose to do
the like against those of Vlm Worms / Nurenderghe and other the like places.
The said Marquis has taken in the Castle and town Bilsteen / and found there
in much grame and wine as also the Town and Castle Meysenheym / be longing to
the Duke of Twe-Bruggen lying not far from Keysers Lauteren.

We understand from Prage that the Sickness and dearth increases there very
much which causes the Citizens and inhabitants to fly away daily more and
more / and forsaeke house and land / and give much money for A free paspot.

The King of Bohemia was pet at Breslaw / but the Queen was gone to
Brandenburg there ly in Childebed / and is certain that those of Sytesia and
Moravia have promised to live and die with the King / here is writing also out
of Moravia / that his Armey is more then thirty thousand strong they exspect
daily more assistaunce from Hungaria / which Bethlem Gabor has promised hence
forth to pay / who makes great preparation for war against Austria.
