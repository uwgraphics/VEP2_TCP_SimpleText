By the King.
WHereas to moderate and qualify the Fines, forfeitures and losses, which we
in our wisdom did foresee might prove heavy unto very many of our subjects,
that had made Alienations of their lands holden in Chief without License, by
private Conueyances without Record: We did of our Gracious inclination and
Royal regard of the quiet, ease, and benefit of all such of our said Subjects
(whose Lands or estates were by such Alienations without License, made subject
to answer unto us any Arrerages, Issues or mean profits) by our Proclamation
bearing date the first day of October last past before the date hereof,
publish, propound, and offer certain favors, remedies and means of
reasonable and easy Compositions for such Alienations, So as they did come in
and take the benefit of our said Princely offers, and favors, before the end of
Hillary Term then next ensuing the date of our said Proclamation, although
such persons making those secret Conueyances, of purpose to defraud us of our
due, deserved no favor: Forasmuch as we do understand that diverse of our
subjects whom it concerns, having sithence the publishing of our said
Proclamation advised and considered with their learned Counsel as well of the
losses, forfeitures and damages, which they have incurred by reason of such
Alienations, as also of the great favor and benefit offered unto them by our
said Proclamation, have and daily do humbly compound with our Officers of our
said Alienations, thereby very thankfully and duetifully accepting of our grace
and favor in that behalf:

And being further given to understand, that the knowledge of our said
Proclamation did so lately come into diverse parts of our Realm, and to the
understanding of many our Subjects, as they could not (through the shortness
of the time prescribed by our said Proclamation) consider and resolve of their
several Cases; We have therefore thought good, according to our Princely and
gracious disposition and purpose in this behalf, not to bind, or confine our
favors to such straitness of time, as that our loving Subjects should not be
able therein to make use of the same. And therefore considering the
waightinesse of the cause, and well allowing that our subjects should have
convenient time to take counsel and advise for the performance of their said
Composition; And to the end that they may have no just excuse, if they shall be
put to answer us our due, according to the Law, when they shall have wilfully
refused our favor: We do by this our Proclamation, publish, signify and
declare, That all such of our Subjects as shall before the Feast of All Saints
next ensuing, offer Composition to our said Officers of the said Alienations,
according to the Articles contained in our said former Proclamation, shall be
admitted to make their Compositions accordingly, and shall have and enjoy all
such benefit, profit and favor, as they might or should have had, if they had
compounded within the time limited by our said former Proclamation, Any thing
in our said former Proclamation contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

Provided that such as shall not take benefit of this extent of our favor, are
not to expect afterward any further enlargement of time, nor other dispensation
whatsoever in that behalf.

Given at our Court at Royston the xviij. day of February, in the sixth year of
our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty. Anno 1608.
