THE DOCTRINE OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY.
JOHN 8. 36. If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free
indeed.
THese words are a conclusion. Sect. 1. The context.
of the verses going before. For whereas our Savior CHRIST having promised
some of the hearers, who, Verse. 30.
whiles he was yet speaking of his person and office, began to believe in him,
that if they did approve themselves to be his Verse. 31.
true disciples, by their perseverance and constant abiding in his word, they
Verse. 32.
should know the truth, (that is, he would more fully manifest himself unto
them, as he speaks Ioh. 14. 21.) and this truth, (which is himself, Ioh. 14.
6.) should make them free; the captious John 14. 6. 22.
Jews (pretending that they understood him as speaking of a corporal or
civil liberty) Verse. 33.
cauilled at this promise, which indeed did not belong unto them, as if he had
offered them great indignity, by promising them liberty, to presuppose their
servitude; alleging that they were already free, and therefore scorned his
promised liberty, which they needed not, being neither servants by nature or
birth, for they were Abraham's seed, nor yet by their fortune or personal
condition, for they never served any. Our Savior therefore, both to refute
their cavil, and also to justify his promise, proves these four things unto
them: 1. That they were servants. 2. That they had great need to be made free.
3. That this freedom must come by him. 4. That being freed by him, they should
be free indeed.

The first he proves thus: Verse. 34.
whosoever commits sin, that is, in whomsoever sin reigns, he is the
servant of sin; but such he insinuates they were, yea such are all men Tit.
3. 3.
by nature, until they be ingrafted into Christ by faith, and renewed by the
holy Ghost; and therefore he would have them to conclude, that, for all their
bragges, they were the miserable servants of sin, and consequently the
slaves of Satan 1. Joh. 3. 8.
, subject to the curse of the law, and to eternal damnation.

2. That they had great need to be made free, he shows both by the
inconvenience of their servitude; (for being Verse. 35.
servants, and not sons, howsoever now they had a place in the house of God, as
Ismael Genesis 22. 10.
had; yet the time should come, that they should be cast out;) and also by the
benefit which should accompany their freedom, that being made the sons of
God, they should as heirs of eternal life, abide, not only to the end of
their days in the Church militant (which is the house of God 1. Tim. 3. 15.
upon earth) but also for ever in the Church triumphant, which is Gods Ioh. 14.
2.
house in heaven.

3. That the faithful attain to this freedom by adoption in Christ. For, to
so Ioh. 1. 12. Gal. 3. 26.
many as receive him by faith, he has given this liberty or power to be the
sons of God. And, Romans 8. 17. Gal. 4. 7.
if sons, then also heirs. This assertion is presupposed in this place, as
being the hypothesis whereupon this inference is grounded. Those that be the
sons of God, abide in the house of God for ever; therefore if the Son shall
make you free, etc. presupposing that men attain to the freedom of Gods
sons, by the benefit of Christ, the only begotten Son of God.

Whereupon, as I said, is inferred the fourth thing, which is my text; If the
Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.

As if he had said: you have no cause to cavil at the promise of liberty,
which I make to all them which truly believe in me. For I tell you upon my
word, which is Amen (that is, true and infallible) that both you, and all men
by nature, though the seed of Abraham (as you are), though living (as you do)
in the visible Church of God, are the very servants of sin; that being
servants and not sons, they must not look to inherit Galath. 4. 28.
with the sons of the promise, or to abide in the house for ever; but when the
time of separation comes, they shall as Matthew. 3. 12. 13. 30. 25. 33.
chafe, be severed from the wheat; as tares, from the corn; as goats, from
the sheep; as Genesis ^. 10. Galath. 4. 30.
Hagar and Ismael, from Isaak the son of the promise. Therefore, though your
pride will not suffer you to see and acknowledge thus much: yet certainly great
need have you to be made free; that of the servants of sin, you may become
the sons of God. But you, who are (as all Ephesians. 2. 3.
men by nature are) the children of wrath, cannot possibly be the sons of God,
except you believe in me, who am the only begotten Son of God; that I may by
the grace of adoption communicate that unto you, which I my self am by nature
and eternal generation. So shall you, of the servants of sin, sons of Satan,
and heirs of hell and damnation, be made the sons of God, heirs of eternal
life, citizens and free denizens of the kingdom of heaven. Whereas now
therefore you are miserable servants, notwithstanding your corporal and
carnal liberty, whereof you vaunt, which is not a true liberty, but a
voluntary service of sin: if you shall believe in me, and approve your selves
to be my true disciples, by abiding in my words; I, who am the truth, will make
you free, not with a counterfeit or imaginary freedom, such as is your
liberty, but with a true and spiritual freedom, which is the gracious, and
the glorious liberty of the sons of God.

Thus have you heard the context, or coherence of these words with the former,
(whereunto we are referred by this word of inference, therefore) wherein diverse
things might profitablie be observed, but that the text calls me unto it, as
containing matter of greatest importance.

For Christian liberty, which is the argument of. Sect. 2. The text. The
argument whereof is Christian liberty.
my text, is, as the Apostle says, Romans 14. 16.
(...), the very good of Christians; which Christ our Savior, taking upon him
the form of a servant, has purchased with his own most precious 1. Pet. 1. 18.
blood; which is the benefit of the Messiah, whereunto we are called Gal. 5. 13.
Galath. 5. 13. which he has promised as a reward to his true disciples John
8. 32.
, verse. 32. which as himself came to preach Luke 4. 18
, Luke 4 18. so does he send us his Ambassadors to the same end, viz. to
preach the Gospel, which is the James 1. 25. 2. 12.
law of liberty, and the doctrine of redemption and freedom by him: that by
our Ministry Act. 26. 18.
men may be brought out of spiritual bondage, unto the liberty of Gods
children. The consideration whereof, as it binds me with all reverent care
and intention of mind, to entreat of this argument; so ought it to move you to
hear the same with great diligence and attention. And the rather, not only
because among us, who profess the Gospel, many do not know the Christian
liberty, and more do abuse it to their own perdition; but also because the
Papists are both enemies of the liberty it self, endeavoring by their
Antichristian doctrine, to bereave us of the chief parts thereof, and also
malicious slanderers of the most Christian and comfortable doctrine of our
Churches concerning the same.

But to come to the words of my text, the sum The explication of the text
and effect whereof is this: that Christ the Son of God, is the author of
true liberty, to all those that truly believe in him. For the explication
whereof, we are first to speak of this liberty in general, and afterward to
descend unto the particulars. In the general The general doctrine of
Christian liberty.
doctrine we are to consider these four things. 1. What it is, and wherein
generally it does consist. 2. Who is the author of this liberty, which in the
text is expressed to be the only begotten Son of God. 3. The subject or the
parties on whom this liberty is conferred, which is plainly gathered out of
the context or inference of these words upon the former, to be all the sons
of God by adoption. 4. The general property of this liberty, that it is not a
counterfeit or imaginary, but a true liberty. Of all which points, I will
speak very briefly.

As touching the first: for as much as Logicians. Sect. 3. The definition of
Christian liberty.
teach, Arist. Poster. 1. 14.
that the definition of the special, is to be fetched from the distribution of
the general; for which cause, the Plato in Sophista.
divine Philosopher calls a distribution (...), as being the ready, and as it
were the Kings way to a definition: we will therefore take a survey of the
diverse sorts of liberty. For there is an outward or external liberty, and
there is an inward or internal liberty. The former, is the liberty of the
outward man from external or bodily servitude; which may be called the
corporal or civil liberty. Of this our Savior speaks not, though the Jews
would seem so to understand him; but of the internal, which may well stand
with the outward or civil bondage. For as our Savior Christ noted them, John
8. 33, 34
though outwardly free, to be in spiritual bondage: so contrariwise, those who
in respect of the inner man are free, may notwithstanding be subject to the
external or civil servitude; which nothing impeacheth or impaireth the
liberty of the soul and conscience before God. In which regard the Apostle
says; 1. Cor. 7. 21.
He that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lords freeman. So that
the liberty whereof we speak, is a liberty of the soul, or inner man. Wicked
therefore is the doctrine of the Anabaptists, who thereby exempt themselves
from all subjection to the civil Magistrate, under pretense of Christian
liberty. I call their doctrine wicked, because the Apostle Peter 1. Pet. 2. 16.
says; that they who under pretense of Christian liberty deny obedience to the
Magistrate in lawful things, do use their liberty for a cloak to cover their
wickedness.

Again, the inward liberty is either a carnal, or spiritual liberty. The
carnal liberty is that, whereby the soul of man is free from righteousness:
which indeed is a voluntary service of sin. For when men be free from
righteousness, they are servants of sin, and contrariwise; as the Apostle
Romans 6. 20.
shows. But our Savior speaks of a liberty, which, as it freeth men from
the servitude of sin, and all the spiritual yokes of bondage, which accompany
the same; so it makes them the servants of righteousness. For when we are
Romans 6. 18.
made free from sin, we are made the servants of righteousness. Wherefore, as
in respect of the former, we say with the Apostle; He that is called, being a
servant, is the freeman of Christ: so in respect of this latter, 1. Cor. 7. 22.
he that is called being free, is the servant of Christ. Devilish therefore is
the Doctrine of the Libertines, who under pretense of Christian liberty,
discharge Christians from all obedience to the law of God, setting them free to
do whatsoever themselves think good. And such is the slander of the Papists,
laying that doctrine to our charge, who notwithstanding are further from it
then themselves. For by the Popes indulgences and pardons, and the Priests
absolutions, setting men free from sin for small, and often times for
ridiculous penances, what do they else but teach men to make but a sport of
sin? Of such Libertines the Apostle Peter 2. Pet. 2. 19.
speaks, that whilst they promise liberty to others, themselves are the
servants of corruption.

It remains therefore, that Christian liberty is a spiritual liberty,
freeing the true Christian from the servitude of sin, and from all other
yokes of spiritual bondage, wherewith sin had entangled us.

Neither is Christian liberty only privative, as being a freedom and immunity
from bondage; as though this were all, that by it we are not servants: but as
appears by this Scripture, it is also positive, as being a liberty, power,
right, and interest to the privileges of Gods children, who are also heirs of
God, and coheires with Christ. For when he had said that servants abide not in
the house for ever, but that such as be sons, abide in the house of God for
ever; he infers, If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be
free indeed. Giving us to understand, that those whom he freeth, he does not
only make them not servants, viz. of sin, but also sons and heirs of God,
and citizens of heaven. Even as they who are made freemen of London, or any
other terrestrial City, are not only exempted from being servants or
apprentises; but also are endowed with the liberties and privileges of free
Burgesses and Citizens. So says the Apostle, Gal 4. 5. 6. 7.
Gal. 4. 5. that Christ has redeemed those who were under the law, that we
might receive the adoption of sons, etc.

Christian liberty therefore is a spiritual liberty, which as the Galath. 2.
4. (...). The partition.
Apostle speaks, the faithful have in Christ Jesus. That is the definition.

The essential parts whereof generally it consists, are two. For partly it
is privative, as being an immunity from all spiritual bondage; in which
respect it is called in the Scriptures Heb. 9. 12. Luk 2. 38.
(...) and Romans 3. 24. Colos. 1. 14.
(...), that is redemption, and is sometimes expressed by the verbes Heb. 2. 15.
(...) and Col. 1. 13. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 10.
(...), signifying deliverance: and partly it is positive, as being a right,
title, and interest to the privileges and prerogatives of Gods adopted
children in Christ, the citizens of the Celestial Jerusalem: and in this
respect it is called (...), as Ioh. 1. 12. to those that receive Christ by
faith, he has given (...), liberty, right or power to be the sons of God, 1.
Cor. 8. 9. Take heed, lest (...), your liberty, right or 1. Cor 8. 9.
power, be not an offense to the weak. Thus you see what this liberty is,
and wherein generally it does consist.

The author of this liberty is Christ the Son of The efficient or author of
this liberty.
God, as it is here said: If the Son therefore shall make you free, etc. so
the Apostle calls it Galath. 2. 4.
the liberty which we have in and by Christ: and again, Galath. 5. 1.
the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free. For he is (...), Romans 11. 26.
that Deliverer which should come out of Sion, who delivers us 1 Thessalonians. 1.
10.
from the wrath of God, from the tyranny of Satan, 1. John 3. 8.
dissoluing the works of the devil, Mat. 12. 29.
binding the strong man and casting him out, Colos. 2. 15.
spoiling principalities and powers, and (...). 4. 8.
leading captivity captive; from the bondage of sin, for he is the John 1.
29.
Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world, whose blood does 1 John
1. 7. Heb. 9. 14.
cleanse us both from the guilt of sin, and also from the corruption: for
therefore he Pet. 1. 18. Tit. 2, 14.
gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might
purge us to be a peculiar people to himself, zealous of good works. And he
is that perfect Savior, out of whose side issue both Ioh. 19. 34. 35. 1. Ioh.
5. 6.
blood and water; the blood of redemption, to free us from the guilt of sin;
and the water of ablution, to cleanse us from the corruption. From the law Gal.
4. 4.
for therefore was he borne of a woman, and made under the law, that he might
redeem them that were under the law. From death and damnation; for therefore he
became a Gal. 3. 13.
curse, that we might be freed from the curse; therefore he died, that
through Heb. 2. 14. 15
death he might vanquish him, who had the power of death, that is, the devil;
and that he might deliver them, who through fear of death, were all their life
time subject to bondage.

But this needs no proof, for in that we profess him to be our redeemer, by
whom we have Ephesians. 1. 7. 1. Cor. 1. 30.
redemption, we all acknowledge him to be the author of our liberty. Let us
rather consider, how he procures this liberty unto us. This he does two
ways; both meritoriously, and effectually. By his merit, in 1. Tim. 2. 6.
giving himself to be a price of ransom for us. For, as Peter 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19
says, we are redeemed not with any corruptible things, as silver and gold,
but with the precious blood of Christ, by Heb 9. 12.
which blood he is entered once into the holy place, having procured an eternal
redemption for us. Secondly, by the efficacy of his spirit, for we are not to
imagine, that Christ has only merited and purchased this liberty for us; but
that also he does confer, apply, and bestow it upon us: which he does by
giving unto us his Romans 8. 9. 15. Gal. 4. 6.
Spirit. For, as in the natural body, the animal spirit, which causes sense
and motion, is from the head sent into all the members of the body; so in the
mystical body of Christ, the Spirit of Psalm. 51. 14.
liberty is communicated to all his members; by which spirit he dwells in
us, and effectually works this liberty, in the degrees of our salvation,
viz. vocation, justification, sanctification, glorification, (as you shall
hear anon, and by the means of our salvation. The principal whereof is the
preaching of the Gospel, which is the Law Iam. 1. 25.
, or doctrine of liberty, the ministry whereof was ordained to this end, to
Act. 26. 18.
open men's eyes, to turn them from darkness unto light, and from the power of
Satan unto God, that by faith in Christ, they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and inheritance with them that be sanctified.

This teaches us, that in our selves we are servants, The use of this doctrine
concerning the author of our liberty.
(for else we needed not a redeemer) and of our selves not able to free us out
of bondage, that there was no means to set us at liberty, but the most
precious ransom, which Christ our blessed Savior paid for us. That we should
acknowledge the infinite love of God Ioh. 3. 16. 1. Ioh. 4. 10.
the Father, who gave his Son, and of the Son Ioh. 15. 13.
who gave himself to be a ransom for us. That we may acknowledge our selves
bound to be thankful Psalm. 107. 2. Col. 1. 12. 13. 14 Romans 7. 25. 1. Cor. 15.
57.
unto him, for let them give thanks whom the Lord has redeemed. That we may
highly esteem of this liberty, which cost so dear a price: that with all
diligence we use the means to obtain it, and never be at rest until we be
made partakers of it: when we have obtained it, to Galath. 5. 1.
stand fast in it; not to abuse it to licentiousnes, but to use it to the
glory of our Redeemer, who has freed us from the spiritual bondage of sin
and Satan, not that we might sin freely, but that we might Luke 1. 74.
serve God without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days
of our life. We must remember, that being 1. Cor. 6. 19. 20
bought with a price, we are not our own, but his that bought us: and
therefore should not seek our selves, or serve our own lusts, but should
glorify him both in our souls and bodies, which are not ours, but his that
has bought us, etc. And so much of the author of this liberty.

Now follows the subject or parties to whom. 5. The subject of this liberty,
or parties on who^ it is conferred.
this liberty belongs, which by the context appears to be those, who by
the grace of adoption and regeneration, are made the sons of God in Christ.
For naturally we are all servants, serving a most servile and slavish servitude
under sin and Satan; which must seriously be acknowledged of us, before we will
either truly desire to be made partakers of this liberty, (for none need to be
freed, but those that are in bondage) or will profit by this doctrine, as
appertaining unto us. Our Savior therefore, according to the Esaias 61. 1.
prophecy of Esaias, says, Luke 4. 18.
that he was sent to preach liberty and deliverance to the captives, and to
set at liberty the broken hearted. He came to seek and to save Mat. 18. 11.
that which was lost: neither came he to Matthew. 9. 13.
call the righteous (in their own conceits) but sinners unto repentance: to
fill the Matthew. 5. 3. 6.
poor and the hungry Luke 1. 53.
with good things, whilst the rich are sent empty away.

Neither must we deceive our selves with this conceit, that because we profess
our selves to be redeemed, and do live in the house of God which is his visible
Church, therefore we have all attained this liberty already. For in the house
of God, there be as well 2. Tim. 2. 20.
vessels of dishonor, as vessels of honor; in the Matthew. 3. 12.
floor of God, as well chafe as wheat; in the Matthew. 13. 47
net of God, as well bad fish as that which is good; in the Matthew. 13. 24
field of God, as well tares as corn; in the family or house of God, as well
Ioh. 8. 34. 35.
servants as sons; in the flock of God, as well Matthew. 25. 32. 33.
goats as sheep. Unless therefore you be the sons of God by faith, truly
called, engrafted into Christ as his members, regenerated by the Spirit of God,
this liberty as yet does not belong unto you. For it is a liberty, as the
Apostle says, Galath. 2. 4.
which we have in Christ, that is, which we being in Christ have by him, as
after we shall hear: (which also) is conferred upon us, in and by our
vocation, justification and sanctification; and therefore none enjoy it, as
actually made free, but such as are sanctified, justified and called.

But here some will object: Are not we the Church of God, and is not the
Church a company of men called? have we not been baptized, and by baptism
regenerated, made the members of Christ, and children of God? How the^ do you
say, we are not free? Beloved, as this objection is not unlike the cavil of
the captious Jews in this place; so must it receive the like answer. Verily,
verily I say unto you, says our Savior, he that commits sin is the servant
of sin, and the servant shall not abide in the house, etc. I know that you
are the Church of God, as these Jews were; and that you have been baptized, as
they had been circumcised. But you must distinguish, first, of the Church; that
there is a Church visible, and a Church invisible, which is the mystical body
of Christ. And you are to know, that there be many in the Church visible,
which are not 1. Ioh. 2. 19.
of the Church invisible; many in the house of God, which be servants and not
sons. Secondly, of calling; that there is an outward calling by the Word,
which is common to all in the Church, of which it is said, Matthew. 20. 16 and
22. 14.
many called, and few chosen. And there is an inward and effectual calling,
according to Gods purpose, of which it is said, Romans 8. 28. 30
whom he elected, he called. Thirdly, of Baptism; there is an outward
Baptism, which is the sprinkling of the 1. Pet. 3. 21.
flesh with water, and an inward Baptism, wherein the souse is Heb. 12. 24. 1.
Pet. 1. 2.
sprinkled with the blood of Christ, and with the water of the holy Ghost,
whereof the outward is a sign. Fourthly, of union with Christ, for there is a
sacramental union in Baptism, and a spiritual by the 1. Cor. 12. 13.
holy Ghost and by faith. Lastly, of Christians, members of Christ, sons of
God. For as the Apostle distinguishes the Romans 2. 28. 29
Jews, that they were either outwardly Jews and in show, or inwardly and in
truth; and our Sauionr in the next Ioh. 8. 37. etc.
words, the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, and according to the
promise. For as Paul also says, they Gal. 3. 7.
which be of faith, are the sons of Abraham: so men are called Christians,
members of Christ, sons of God, not only who are such indeed and in truth;
but also such as are Christians only in profession, members of Christ in
appearance, Ezech. 16. 20. 21. Matthew. 8. 12.
sons of God in respect of the outward covenant. Wherefore though you live in
the visible Church, though you be called, though you have been baptized, and by
baptism sacramentally united to the body of Christ, which is his Church;
though in your own profession, and in the reputation of others, who conceive
of you (as they ought) according to the judgment of charity, you are
Christians, members of Christ, and sons of the kingdom: notwithstanding, if
you do not truly believe in Christ and unfeignedly repent of your sins, you
are servants and not sons. Yea, so far shall these outward privileges be
from exempting you from damnation, that they shall greatly aggrauate your
judgment. For has God called, us and we are not called? has he invited us to
turn unto him, and we are not converted? has he by his Ministers 2. Cor. 5.
20.
entreated us, that we would be reconciled unto him, and we will not be
reconciled? has he offered us infinite mercy in the mystery of our salvation
by Christ, and we have despised the same, not caring to apprehend the mercies
of God and merits of Christ, but suffering his precious blood to be spilt as it
were on the ground in vain? has he often sought Matthew. 23. 37
to gather us unto him, as the Hen gathers the Chickens under her wings, and
we would not? Then have the means of salvation been the means of obduration
unto us; and the Word, which to the faithful is the 2. Cor. 2. 16.
savor of life unto life, unto us is become a savor of death unto death. Yea,
for this contempt of the Gospel, if we persist in it, our estate in the day of
judgment shall be more Matthew. 10. 15.
intolerable, then theirs of Sodom and Gomorah. And unto us belongs that
fearful woe denounced by our Savior Christ, Matthew. 11. 21. 23.
Woe to thee Chorazin, woe to thee Bethsaida, woe to thee Capernaum: for if the
means which you have had, had been vouchsafed to them of Tyrus and Sidon, yea
to them of Sodom, they would have turned unto God, but I say unto you, it shall
be easier for them in the day of judgment, then for you. Again, has the Lord
sent his Son to redeem us, given us means to apply Christ unto us, has he
entreated us to believe and repent, and put to his seal in Baptism, thereby
assuring us, that if we believe and repent, our souls are washed with the
blood of Christ, that we are ingrafted into him, and in him are made the sons
of God, and heirs of eternal life? Shall not we therefore most worthily
perish in our sins, if notwithstanding we will not believe and repent;
especially having in our Baptism by a solemn vow bound our selves thereto. The
consideration whereof must force men, who are not yet regenerated, unfeignedly to
turn unto God, and to lay hold upon Christ by faith. For it is most certain,
though they live in the house of God, which is his Church, yet until they
truly believe and repent, they are servants and not sons: and such servants
as are held under the most miserable and basest slavery of fin and Satan:
being not only bound hand and foot, yea in heart and mind, so that they can
neither do nor think that which is spiritually good; but are also carried away
2. Tim. 2. 26. Titus 3. 3.
captive, to perform the will of Satan, and the lusts of the flesh; whereby it
comes to pass, that as they can do no good, so can they do nothing but sin.

The next thing to be considered, is the quality of this liberty, viz. that it
is a ture liberty. For neither. 6. The quality or property of this liberty.
is it an imaginary liberty, as in the paradox of the Stoics, who held that
wise men of the world were only free, when they also, being not freed by
Christ, were and are no better but servants; or in the secure imaginations of
carnal men, who with these Jews, though being in bondage, think themselves
free. Neither is it a loose liberty or licentiousnes, such as Libertines assume
to themselves, but a true and a holy liberty, whereby we being freed from sin,
become servants of righteousness, and being delivered from the hands of our
spiritual enemies, are enabled to worship God with willing minds, and
cheerful hearts: for that is the only true liberty: and such is the liberty
of the Saints in heaven, and of the blessed Angels, who count it not only their
liberty, but also their happiness, willingly and cheerfully to serve the Lord.
For if the Son, who is the truth, shall make you free, then shall you be free
(...), indeed, and in truth.

This therefore, as it serves for the comfort of the godly; so also for the
terror of the wicked. For, from this speech of our Savior, we may conclude
both ways. 1. Whosoever are made free by Christ, they are free indeed: but all
the faithful are made free by Christ; therefore (whatsoever the devil or
their own corruption can object to the contrary) they are free indeed.

Again, If the Son make you free, says Christ, then are you free indeed; but
you (say I to unbelievers and impenitent sinners,) are not free indeed: For he
that commits sin, is the servant of sin; therefore, howsoever you profess
your selves redeemed by Christ, and howsoever also it be most true, that Christ
has paid a ransom sufficient for the redemption of all; yet are you not
actually redeemed, nor the benefit of redemption applied unto you, until you
be ingrafted into Christ by faith, and renewed by the holy Ghost. And the same
may be confirmed by the oath of the Lord, (wherein Hebr. 6. 18.
it is impossible that he should lie,) the oath which he swear to our father
Abraham, that he would give us, both that we should be delivered from the hand,
that is, the power and dominion of our spiritual enemies; and Luke 1. 73. 74.
being delivered, should also have grace to worship God without fear, in
holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. If therefore we
do not endeavor to worship God in holiness and righteousness, with willing
minds and upright hearts; it is as sure as the oath of the Lord is true, that
as yet we are not actually freed and redeemed by Christ. For if the Son make
you free, you shall be free indeed.

And thus much of the general doctrine of Christian liberty: wherein I have
been the shorter, because all these points, whereof I have thus generally and
briefly spoken, viz. that Christian liberty is a spiritual liberty, which
the faithful have in and by Christ Jesus; that it consists on two parts, an
immunitie and freedom from all spiritual bondage, and an (...), and right to
the privileges and liberties of Gods children: that Christ our redeemer is the
author of this liberty, both in respect of his merit and efficacy: that it is
bestowed only upon the faithful, who are the sons of God and members of
Christ: and lastly, that this liberty of Christians is a true liberty; all
these points, I say, will more plainly and fully appear in the particulars,
whereunto we are now to descend.

Christian liberty therefore, is either libertas Viae, of this life, such as
is incident. 7. The special doctrine of Christian liberty.
unto us whiles we are in the way, whereof Luke 12. 58.
some not unfitly understand our Savior to speak. Luke 12. 58. Give diligence

understanding by the Governor, God; by the Judge, Christ; by the adversary,
the devil, sin, a guilty conscience, the sentence of the law; by the way,
this life; by the officer the Angels, by prison, hell, etc. Patriae, of the
life to come, which we shall enjoy, when being come to the end of our way, we
shall have the 1. Pet. 1. 9.
end of our faith; which is the salvation of our souls.


The former is freedom from the bondage of sin, the other from the Romans 8.
21.
bondage of corruption. The former is simply called (...), Ephesians. 1. 7. 14.
redemption, the latter (...), the redemption of possession: for by the former
we are heirs, spe, in hope and expectation; by the latter, re, in deed and
possession; the one is begun and in part, the other perfect and complete: the
one, the liberty of grace, the other, as the Apostle speaks Romans 8. 21.
(...), the liberty of glory.

Of these in order: And first of the liberty of The liberty of grace.
grace, which even in this life the faithful do enjoy in and by Christ. And it
is either common to all the faithful, as well of the old Testament as of the
new; or peculiar to the faithful under the Gospel. The faithful under both
Testaments were and are sons; who as they have the same Titus 1. 4.
common faith; so have they the same Jud. 3.
common salvation, and therefore the same liberty and right, in respect of the
inheritance it self, and all the degrees thereof. Notwithstanding, there is
difference between sons under age, and in their minority, in respect of
discipline and government, and those who are come to years: the former being
nurtured by schoolemasters, and governed by tutors, as the Apostle says Gal.
4. 2. 3. and 3. 24.
of the faithful before the incarnation of Christ; the latter set at liberty
from such discipline and government. Otherwise, as they had the same faith, and
the same justification (for all the faithful both before Christ and after,
were and are justified by faith, as Abraham Romans 4. 23. 24
was, Romans 4. and by such Iam. 2. 20. 21.
a faith, Iam. 2.) so have they the same liberty which is obtained by faith,
and in some chief points thereof is, as Jnstit. lib. 3. cap. 19.. 1.
Calvin says, an appendix of justification.

The common liberty of grace, which may fitly The liberty of saving grace.
be called the liberty of saving grace, contains many particulars; which,
for your easiest remembrance, may be reduced to these three heads.

For it is a liberty which we have in and by our Vocation. Justification.
Sanctification.


For, although these three concur in time, because a man is no sooner
effectually called, but he is also justified before God, and no sooner
justified, but he begins also to be sanctified (which is duly to be
observed of those, who presuming, and that perhaps for a long time, that they
be called and justified, do still remain unsanctified) notwithstanding in
order of nature Romans 8. 30.
vocation goes before justification, and justification before sanctification.
And let this also by the way be observed for the comfort of the godly. For
whosoever, professing the true faith, has a true purpose and unfeigned desire
to walk before God in the obedience of his will, making conscience of all his
ways: that man, howsoever besides his general purpose he may fail ( Jam. 3.
2.
as we all do) in many particulars; yet he is sanctified, and from his
sanctification may certainly conclude, that he is justified, that he is
called, that he is elected, that he shall be saved. For the fruit could not
be good, unless the tree or the branch that bears it were good, and the
branch cannot be good, unless it be ingrafted into Christ, Ioh. 15. 1. 5.
the only true vine: that is to say, a man's conversation is never acceptable
unto God, before his person be accepted; and his person is not accepted, until
he be united unto Christ. For the better understanding of this point, we
must remember, that Christ at a dear price has long since purchased this
liberty for us, and has meritoriously wrought our freedom. But none are
actually and effectually set at liberty, but those alone, who have actual
union and communion with Christ. Now in our effectual vocation, we have union
with Christ; and in our justification and sanctification, communion with him.
In the former, in respect of his merits apprehended by faith, and communicated
unto us by imputation; in the other, in respect of his graces, which being in
him without measure, are by his spirit from John 1. 16.
him derived, and in some measure communicated unto us by infusion.

But let us speak of them severally. And first, as. 8. The liberty of
Vocation.
touching our vocation, I say with the Apostle, Gal. 5. 13.
Gal. 5. Brethren, you are called unto liberty: which words we are thus to
understand, that by our calling we are not only invited unto Christian liberty
in general, as a maine benefit of our Christian profession; but also by it are
enfranchised, being thereby put into possession of a good part of it, and
entitled to the rest. For whereas naturally we are wholly, and not only in
part (for that may be verified of the faithful, Romans 7. 14.) carnal, sold
under sin; by our calling we are first made spiritual, being in some measure
endued with the spirit of Christ. Now the spirit of Christ, being the spirit of
liberty, as David speaks, Psalm. 51. 14.
Psalm. 51. we may resolve with the Apostle, 2. Cor. 3. 17.
that where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.

But the liberty which we have by our calling stands on these degrees. First,
as it is an immunitie; our minds are therein freed from the servitude of
blindness and incredulity, our hearts and wills from the bondage of that,
which the Apostle calls Romans 11. 32.
(...), (under which all men naturally are concluded) that is, disobedience and
infidelity; our selves, from the servitude of Satan, being called and as it
were culled out of the world, whereby is meant the company of worldly men,
which is the kingdom of the devil, (who is the John 12. 31.
Prince, yea the God 2. Cor 4. 4.
of the world, working effectually (...), Ephesians. 2. 2.
in the children of infidelity and disobedience, blinding their
understandings, and 2. Tim. 2. 26.
captiuating their wills:) and lastly translated from the most slavish estate
of damnation, being Apoc. 14. 4.
redeemed from among men, and delivered out of the Gal. ^. 4.
world, which because it wholly, as Saint John 1. John 5. 19. For he is (...),
of whom he had spoken, verse 18.
says, (...), lies under the subjection of the devil, (who has the Hebr. 2.
15.
power of death) is also subject to death and damnation.

As it is (...), that is, a power and interest; we are in our calling endued,
as I said, with the spirit of liberty, which freeth our souls by enlightening
our minds, persuading our judgments, and softening our hearts, enspiring
thereinto godly desires and gracious resolutions; whereby he beginning the
grace of faith in us, does regenerate us and unite us unto Christ. So that by
our effectual calling, in regard that therein the spirit of liberty is
communicated unto us, and the saving grace of faith is therein begotten in us,
we are made the sons of God and members of Christ, and are not only
entitled to all the rights and privileges of the children of God, and members
of Christ; but also are presently John 5. 24.
translated, as it were from death to life, and from the state of damnation,
unto the state of grace and salvation.

But these things do need some further explanation. First, therefore in the
ministry of the Gospel, which is the ministry 2. Cor. 3. 8. 1. Pet. 1. 23.
of the spirit, the Romans 10. 8.
word of faith, the seed of regeneration, the Jam. 1. 18. 25.
law or doctrine of liberty, and the ordinary means of our 2. These. 2. 14.
vocation, the Lord, preventing us with his grace, sends the spirit of his
son into our hearts; which being, as I said, the spirit of liberty; first,
freeth our minds from the bondage of ignorance, incredulity and vanity,
wherein until then we were held captive, not once able of our selves to
entertain a 2. Cor. 3. 5.
good thought, the whole frame of our thoughts being Genesis 6. 5. and 8. 21.
only evil continually; the wisdom of our flesh, Romans 8. 7.
or that which our flesh minds, being emnitie against God; our selves, not
only not perceiving, but being 1. Cor. 2. 14.
not able to perceive the things which are of the spirit of God, and much less
able to give assent unto them (for no man can say that 1. Cor. 12. 3.
Jesus is Christ but by the holy Ghost) and much less to assent effectually,
or by a lively faith. The spirit of God therefore by the ministry of the word
(which is a Psalm. 119. 105
light unto our feet) as the means, and by the Ministers of the Gospel as
his instruments (who are therefore called the Matthew. 5. 14.
light of the world, and are sent by Christ to Act. 26. 18.
open our eyes, and to give light to them that sit in Luke 1. 79.
darkness, and in the shadow of death) enlighteneth our minds to understand,
and opens our hearts as he did the heart of Lydia, persuading our souls Act.
16. 14.
(...), that is, not only to attend, but, as the word also signifies, to
assent to those things which are spoken by the Ministers; and thereby makes us
unfeignedly to acknowledge and seriously to consider, both our miserable
servitude and damnable estate in our selves, and also the gracious liberty and
saving grace of God offered in Christ. And this is the first degree of the
liberty which we have in our calling, that therein we are called out of 1.
Pet. 2. 9.
darkness into light. Of this liberty the Apostle speaks, 2. Cor. 3. 2. Cor.
3. 15. 16. 17.
that whereas there is naturally a veil over men's hearts, that they cannot
understand the Word; this veil is taken away by the spirit of God, when they
turn unto the Lord. Now the Lord (says he) is the spirit, and where the
spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. In this regard the spirit is compared
to an Apoc. 3. 18.
eye-salue, and is called that 1. Joh. 2. 27.
anointing, which, being received from Christ, teaches us all things.

Having thus revealed unto us both our own miserable estate in our selves, and
the infinite mercies of God in Christ, and moved us truly to assent thereto;
in the next place he touches our hearts with a sense of our misery, and with
a hatred of sin, which has brought us into that miserable estate, and by the
ministry of the Word, which is his Romans 1. 16.
power to our salvation, and his Esai. 53. 1.
arm to draw us unto him, he turns our will and affections from darkness
(which naturally Ioh. 3. 19 Act. 16. 18.
we love) unto light, not only working in us hearty desires, to come out of
that damnable estate, and to be made partakers of Christ (which desires also he
being the Zac. 12. 10. Romans 8. 26.
Spirit of supplication, helps us to express in hearty prayer;) but also
inspiring into us a settled resolution, that for as much as liberty and
salvation is promised to all that receive Christ by faith; we will therefore
resolve undoubtedly to acknowledge him to be our only Savior, and to rest upon
him alone for salvation. Thus by working, 1. In our minds an effectual assent
to the promise of the Gospel. 2. In our hearts an earnest desire to be made
partakers of Christ's merits, and 3. In our will a settled resolution, to
acknowledge him to be the Messiah, and to rely upon the mercies of God and
merits of Christ, for justification and salvation, (by which three we do John
1. 12.
receive Christ), the Spirit of God begets the grace of justifying faith in
us. In the begetting whereof, he does not only Act. 26. 18.
turn men from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; but
also regenerateth them, and unites them unto Christ, making them of the
children of wrath, the sons of God; of the impes of the old Adam, members of
Christ; and of the subjects of Satan in the kingdom of Colos. 1. 13.
darkness, fellow Ephesians. 2. 19.
citizens with the Saints in the kingdom of God. And this is the liberty which
we have by our calling. As for the teachers of free will, and the magnifiers of
our pure naturals; they neither acknowledge the woeful bondage wherein we are by
nature, nor the happy liberty, whereunto we are, not borne, but called. For
this is a liberty, ad quam non nati, sed renati sumus; which we have not by
generation, but by regeneration. Neither is it a common liberty of al, but a
liberty peculiar to the people of God, who are a people 1. Pet. 3. 9.
set at liberty, peculiar to the sons of God, and members of Christ. But it
will be said, if there be no freedom in our wills before we be called, then
belike we are called and saved against our wills, and we must look with the
Enthusiasts for violent raptures. I answer, that there is in our wills a
freedom of nature, whereby it is free from compulsion. For, that the will
should be forced, it implies a contradiction: for then it should both will and
nill the same thing at one time. Notwithstanding this freedom of the will,
until it be freed by grace, is a voluntary service of sin; voluntarily and
with greediness, willing that which is evil, although it can will nothing
else. But the preventing grace of God, whereby we are called, is perswasiue, and
that ordinarily by the Word; drawing us indeed, and so of unwilling making us
willing, but this is by persuasion, and not by compulsion. For although our
wills in the first act of our conversion be merely passive, and none can come
to Christ unless the Joh. 6. 44.
Father draw him: yet we can no sooner conceive a man to be effectually called,
then that he is made willing. For in the very act of our calling, of unwilling
we are made willing; and no sooner are we effectually drawn, but we willingly
come: in whch sense true is that saying of Chrysostom, (...), God indeed
draws, but he draws him that is willing. Wherefore though our wills do
not concur, ad vocationem, unto our calling; yet they concur, in vocatione,
in our calling, being therein made free.

Now we are to entreat of the liberty which we. 9. Justification and
sanctification not to be confounded.
have both in our justification, and also in our fanctification. For howsoever
these graces do always so concur, as that whosoever has the one, has the
other; and whosoever has not both, has neither; yet are we carefully to
distinguish them. For the Papists in not distinguishing them, confound the Law
and the Gospel, abolish the maine benefit of Christ, which in the Scriptures
goes under the name of justification, and with it the liberty which we have
by it; and lastly, by their Antichristian doctrine teach men to place the
matter of their justification, and the merit of salvation in themselves. For
they do teach, that a man is justified, when he is made righteous by
righteousness inherent in himself, and performed by himself, and accordingly
make two degrees of justification: The one, which they call the first
justification, when a man of a sinner is made just, by the infusion of faith,
hope, and charity; the other, which they call the second justification, when a
man of a just man is made more just by bringing forth good works. So that
according to their doctrine, the righteousness of the first justification, is
habitual and inherent in themselves; of the second, actual, and performed by
themselves. And whereas justification stands on two parts, viz. remission of
sin, and the making, or, as the Romans 5. 19.
Apostle speaks, constituting of us righteous; as they teach, that we are
made righteous; not by imputation, but by infusion of righteousness: so they
teach, that remission of sin is the deletion of sin, and that sins are
then pardoned, when by infusion of the contrary graces they are expelled. Even
as water is then said to be warmed, when by the accession of heat the cold is
expelled. Again, where the Scripture says, that we are justified by grace,
that is, by Romans 3. 24.
the mere favor of God in Christ, by faith without works, by the
righteousness of God, which without the law is manifested in the Gospel; they
by grace understand the graces of God in us, which they say concur with faith
unto justification; by righteousness, not the righteousness of Christ
apprehended by faith, but a righteousness from Christ infused into us, etc.
Which doctrines, being understood of sanctification, are for the most part
true. For we do not deny, but that the matter of our sanctification is inherent
in us, and performed by us; and that it is partly habitual, and partly
actual; that it consists in our dying unto sin, which is called
mortification, and living unto righteousness, which is called vivification: that
there be degrees thereof, according to the measure of grace received: that we
are sanctified by the grace, or rather graces of God in us; and that thereunto
not faith alone, but hope and charity, and other both inward graces and
outward obedience do concur, etc.

But if the justification which the Papists teach, be nothing else but
sanctification; what then is become of that, which in the Scriptures goes
under the name of justification, and is the maine benefit of the Messiah,
whereby we are not only freed from the guilt of sin, which bound us over to
death and damnation; but also are in Christ accepted as righteous, and made
heirs of eternal life; by which we are freed from the fear of damnation, and
are entitled unto the kingdom of heaven? Surely by the Popish doctrine it is
in a manner abolished, and with it the liberty which we have by it, which is
no less then our deliverance from hell, and our title to the kingdom of
heaven, which if we have not by Christ, we have no salvation by him. For it is
certain, that whereby we are justified, thereby we are saved.

This most pernicious and Antichristian error they seek to justify by the
like notation of the Latin words. For, as to be sanctified, is to be made
holy, by holiness wrought in us; so to be justified, in their conceit, is to be
made just, by righteousness wrought in us.

Whereunto I answer, that if the Latin notation were to be respected, it
would not hinder our cause. For, we do freely confess, that whom the Lord
justifies, he makes just. But then the question is, whether by imputation, or
by infusion. By imputation, we say, as he justifies; by infusion, not as he
justifies, but as he sanctifies. But the Latin word is no further to be
urged, then as it is the translation of the Hebrew word in the old Testament,
and of the Greek in the new, which signifies to justify. Now it is plain,
that both the Hebrew (...), and the greek (...), is verbum forense, a
judicial word ascribed unto God, as the Judge; to teach us, when we think of
justification, to summon our selves before the judgment seat of God. And in
this sense it is opposed to condemning, as in the Deuteronomy. 25. 1. Prou. 17. 15.
judgments of men, Deuteronomy. 25. 1. Prou. 17. 15. so in the Mat. 12. 37. 1. King.
8. 32. Romans 5. 16. 18. Romans 8. 33.
judgment of God, Matthew. 12. 37. By thy words thou shall be justified, and by
thy words thou shall be condemned; 1. King. 8. 32. Romans 5. 16. 18. and Romans 8.
33. Hereby then appears, both what justification is, and wherein it differs
from sanctification. For the contrary to sanctifying, is polluting; but the
contrary to justifying, is condemning. Wherefore, as sanctifying being the
contrary to polluting, does signify making holy; so justifying being the
contrary to co^demning, does signify absoluing, acquitting, pronouncing just.
And in this sense evermore, in the question of justification, it is used when
it is ascribed unto God. Neither are the Papists able to produce any one
testimony, where justification being ascribed to God, (as Romans 3. 26. and 8.
33.
It is God that does justify) does signify making righteous by infusion. This
then is the first note of difference, whereunto others may be added. communion
with Christ in respect of his graces, which being in him without measure, are
by his spirit derived to us in measure, and communicated by infusion, to free
us from the corruption and dominion of sin, and to prepare and fit us for the
kingdom of heaven.

Ephesians. 1. 7. Colos. 1. 14.
remission of sins, or justification; but we are redeemed only by the merits
and righteousness of Christ, and not by our own; and therefore we are
justified by the righteousness of Christ, and not by that which is inherent in
us, or performed by us: but our sanctification consists in the graces of Gods
spirit inherent in us, and the new obedience performed by us.

2. Cor. 5. 21.
righteous before God in him: Christ was made a sinner for us, by imputation of
our sins to him: therefore we are made righteous before God in him, by
imputation of his righteousness unto us. Again, as we were made sinners, that
is, guilty of the first Adams transgression; Romans 5. 18. 19
so are we justified by the obedience of the second Adam. But we are guilty of
the first Adams transgression by imputation. For how should that being an
action, and therefore transient, be communicated unto us? Let Bellarmine
answer: It is communicated to us, says he, Adae peccatu^ no bis communicatur
per generationem eo modo, quo communicari potest id quod transit, nimirum per
imputationem. Omnibus enim imputatur, qui ex Adamo nascuntur, quoniam omnes in
lumbis Adami existentes, in eo et per eum peccauimus, cum ipse peccauit.
Bellarm. tit. 3. de amiss. great. and stat. pec. lib. 5. cap. 17.
as transient things use to be communicated, that is to say, by imputation.
Therefore we are justified by imputation of the obedience of the second Adam.
For the obedience of Christ which he performed on earth, being transient, how
could it be communicated unto us, but as Bellarmine says, all transient things
are communicated, viz. by imputation? The reason of which imputation is this.
For as all men being in Adam as the root of mankind, originally, are guilty
of his sin, it being imputed unto them, because in him and by him, by reason of
their union with him, all sinned: so the faithful being in Christ as their
head or root, are justified by his obedience, it being imputed to them, because
in him, and by him, by reason of our union with him, we fulfilled the Law, and
in him, and by him we satisfied the justice of God. But we are sanctified by
the infusion of grace wrought in us by the holy Ghost.

saved, and the fitting and preparing of us to that kingdom, whereinto no
unclean thing shall enter.





These things thus premised, let us consider what. 10. The liberty of
justification.
that liberty is, which we have both in our justification, and also in our
sanctification. In both (as our freedom is an immunitie) we are freed from
sin, and from the Law, which is the strength of sin, though in different
respects, which will be so many more differences betwixt justification and
sanctification. In sin there are two things, the guilt thereof, and the
corruption. In justification we are freed wholly from the guilt of sin: for
to be justified, is to have remission of sin Romans 4. 6. 7. Freedom from guilt
of sin.
, Romans 4. 6. 7. or, which is all one, to be freed, or absolved from the guilt
of it. And so certain it is, that in justification we have this freedom, that
to be justified, is to be freed, according to the Scriptures phrase Romans 6. 7.
, Romans 6. 7. He that is dead, is freed from sin: the Greek is (...). See Act.
13. 38. 39.
Act. 13. 38. 39. Be it known unto you, that through Christ is preached unto
you forgiveness of sins. And from all things, from which you could not be
justified by the law of Moses, by him every one that believes is justified.
Where, to be justified, is to have pardon of sin, or freedom from the guilt
of it.

The guilt of sin is the obligation or binding over of the sinner unto
punishment: and this bond is partly in the Law, As the (...), or preposition.
which is the handwriting or obligation that is against us, binding over the
transgressor of it, to the punishment threatened in it; and partly in the (...),
or assumption.
conscience, applying the Law, moral or natural, to the sinner, and from
thence (...), or conclusion.
pronouncing him subject to punishment. From this obligation or guilt we are
freed before God, and as it were in the court of heaven, so soon as we
believe: and we are freed from the same in the court of conscience, when we
know that we believe, and are assured of our justification. For, Act. 26. 18.
by faith we have remission of sin: and whosoever Act. 13. 38 39
believes in Christ, he is justified from the guilt thereof.

This our freedom contains in it happiness, for as their estate is
miserable, whose sins are not forgiven, because by their sins they are
debtors unto God, owing in respect thereof eternal death and damnation (though
they only feel this burden, whose conscience is thoroughly touched, of whom it
is said, Prou. 18. 14.
A wounded spirit who is able to bear?) so their estate is happy, who are
freed from the guilt of sin. David, though a King, flourishing in great
honor, wealth, and delights; notwithstanding he reposeth his felicity in the
forgiveness of sin, Psalm. 32. 1. 2. Romans 3. 6.
Psalm. 32. Blessed is the man whose wickedness is forgiven, and whose sin is
covered, blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes not iniquity. Which
should move us above all things to labor for the forgiveness of sin, and for
the assurance thereof. If thou believe in Christ, and withal confess thy sin
1. Joh. 1. 9.
and forsake Prou. 28. 13.
it, thou may be sure that it is pardoned.

Secondly, in our justification we are freed from the. 11.
the Gal. 4. 4. 5. Freedom from the Law.
law, and that in two respects. First, from the malediction or condemnation of
it: secondly, from the laws exaction of inherent and that perfect righteousness
unto justification. Under which double yoke of bondage all men are, that are
not justified by faith in Christ: that is, all men in themselves are subject to
the curse Gal. 3. 10.
who in the least degree do at any time in their whole life transgress any
part of the law, as all men oftentimes do; and again, no man who is not in
Christ, can be exempted from the curse, and attain to justification, unless
he continue in all the things which are written in the book of the law to do
them; which no man is able to do, the law by reason of the flesh being Romans
8. 3.
impossible unto us. Let natural or unconverted men apply this to themselves.
Can thou not by the sentence of the law be exempted from the curse, unless
thou do not only not commit the things forbidden, but also do the duties
commanded; unless thou do all, and unless thou continuest in doing all,
never failing in any one particular; and finally, unless thou continuest in
doing all, and every thing commanded in that perfect manner and measure which
the law prescribes? Alas then, how will thou escape the dreadful curse, who
in stead of doing the duties commanded, have done the vices forbidden; who in
stead of keeping all the commandments, have broken them all; and in stead of
continuing in a total perpetual and perfect obedience of the law, have
continued in the disobedience thereof? Hence we may conclude with the Apostle,
that all men in themselves, even those Gal. 3. 10.
who seek to be justified by the law, be concluded under sin, and
consequently under the curse: and therefore have extreme need to seek unto
Christ, that by him they may be set free from this twofold bondage; which is,
to be under the curse of the law if we break it, when we can do nothing else
but break it; and to be excluded from justification, if we do not continue in
the perfect performance of the law, when we are not able so much as to 2. Cor.
3. 5. Freedom from the curse of the Law.
think a good thought, or once to will that which is spiritually good. But by
Christ we are freed from both. First from the curse, as the Apostle in express
terms teaches: Gal. 3. 13.
Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, when he was made a curse
for us. He has freed us from the punishment of sin, by undergoing the
punishment for us, he has acquitted us from our debts by discharging them for
us. For as Esaias Esa. 53. 3.
says, He was wounded for our transgressions, he was broken for our
iniquities, the chastisement of our peace (that is, which was to procure us
peace and reconciliation with God) was laid upon him, and by his stripes we
are healed. And again, Verse. 6.
The Lord has laid upon him the iniquity of us all, that is, the punishment
of all our sins. And, Verse. 11.
My righteous servant by his knowledge, that is, by the knowledge of him or
faith in him, shall justify many, for he shall bear their iniquities.

Now, by the curse of the law from which Christ does free us, we are to
understand all evil Psalm. 91. 10.
of punishment, as well temporal as eternal: for it is absurd to imagine with
the Papists, that Christ having freed us from the eternal punishment, has not
freed us from the temporal. By temporal, we mean the evils both of this
life, whether corporal or spiritual (which are innumerable) and also in the
end of this life, viz. an evil death. Against both these it will be objected,
and first against the former; that notwithstanding their justification, the
faithful are as subject to afflictions and calamities of this life as others,
and therefore to punishments. But I deny that consequence, if you speak of
punishments properly, which be the curses of the law inflicted upon men by way
of vengeance, to satisfy the justice of God. For the Lord has imposed the
punishment of all our sins upon Christ; who has fully satisfied the justice
of his Father for them. And therefore as there is no condemnation, so no
punishment (properly understood) to them that are in Christ Jesus. Neither can
it stand with the justice of God (who is not only merciful, but also Romans 3.
25. 26. 1. John 1. 9.
just in justifying of us) to exact a punishment of the faithful for the
satisfying of his justice, for whom Christ has already fully satisfied his
justice by bearing the punishment: this were to punish the same sins twice,
once in Christ, and again in us. Indeed the faithful are subject to crosses
and afflictions: but all the afflictions of the godly are either trials for
their good, or such judgments as are either simply fatherly chastisements
proceeding from love, and merely respecting the good of the party chastised,
whereof the Apostle speaks, 1. Cor. 11. 32. 1. Cor. 11. 32.
When we are judged we are chastised of the Lord, that we should not be
condemned with the world, or else they be also (...), (according to the Of
(...) honor, and (...) care.
etymology of the word which by some is given) when God besides the
chastisement of the party, has also care or respect to his own honor, which
would be impeached, if he should seem to wink at the scandalous offenses of
his children, as though he would maintain them in their sins. In which regard
judgment, as Peter 1. Pet. 4. 17.
says, begins at the house of God. For the Lord many times corrects those
sins in the godly, both for his own honor, and their good, which he seems to
pass by in the wicked. Of this kind we have an example in David, to whom the
Lord upon his submission forgave his grievous sins of murder and adultery,
notwithstanding both for David's chastisement, and for the example of others,
but chiefly for the maintenance of his own glory (which by the scandalous
offenses of Gods children, is by the wicked blasphemed, as though such sins
were the fruits of the religion and service of God), he would not suffer the
child begotten in adultery to live. Why? because by that sin David had 2. Sam.
12. 14.
caused the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme. The use which we are to make
hereof, is, not with the Papists, to teach men to make satisfaction to God for
their sins, as though Christ had not fully satisfied for them already: but to
teach men, both to beware that they do not commit sin, especially scandalous
sins; because thereby they displease and dishonor God their merciful Father,
provoking him to power his judgments upon them, for their amendment, that they
be not condemned with the world, and for the maintenance of his own honor: and
also that having sinned, we do Amos 4. 12.
meet the Lord in his judgments, by humbling our selves before him,
confessing our fault, and craving pardon, that 1. Cor. 11. 31.
iudgeing our selves, we may not be judged of the Lord.

Against the second it is also objected, that notwithstanding their
justification, the godly die as well as the wicked. I answer, that as of all
afflictions, so also of death, the nature is changed in respect of the
faithful; to whom death it self, though brought in by the malice of the devil,
is not a curse or punishment properly. I do not deny, but that many times, in
respect of the time and manner of death, the godly are judged and chastised,
the Lord in mercy killing their bodies, that he may 1. Cor. 11. 30. 32.
save their souls; but from the evil of death they are wholly freed: for to
them it is the end of sin, and is therefore inflicted upon us, that sin
might die with us, as Methodius Apud Epiphan. haeres. 64.
says, and being the end of sin unto us, it is also the end of misery, the
haven of rest, a happy passage out of this vale of misery unto the kingdom
of glory; and so not only no curse, but also a blessing, no loss, but an
advantage, as after we shall show. For yet we speak but of the immunities of
justification, the principal whereof yet remains to be spoken of; that is,
freedom from subjection to damnation, to everlasting death, to the eternal
wrath of God, which is the most miserable bondage and subjection of al those,
who are not justified by faith in Christ. But from this curse also Christ has
freed the faithful. For this is the immunitie which we have by him; that John
3. 16.
whosoever believes in him shall not perish, that there is Romans 8. 1.
no condemnation to them that be in Christ Jesus; that by his death Hebr. 2. 15.
he has destroyed him that had the power of death, that he might deliver them
all, which for fear of death, were all their life time subject to bondage;
that Jesus our Savior delivers us from the 1. These. 1. 10.
wrath to come.

And thus we have heard of two immunities, which we have in our
justification: that we are freed from the guilt of sin, and from the curse
of the Law, whereto our sin had made us subject. And from hence arises
unspeakable peace and liberty to the distressed conscience, terrified with
the guilt of sin, the curse of the Law, and fear of damnation; when it
receiving Christ by faith, has immunitie and freedom from them all.

Now follows the other immunitie from the. 12. Freedom from the laws
exaction of inherent righteousness, to justification.
law, in respect of the exaction of perfect righteousness to be inherent in us,
and perfect obedience to be performed by us, unto our justification and
salvation: unto which yoke of bondage, as I said, all men by nature are
subject. For it is sure and certain, that without righteousness, and such a
righteousness as is fully answerable to the perfect law of God, no man can be
justified.

Now, this righteousness must either be inherent in our selves, which is the
righteousness that the Law requires unto justification; or being performed by
another, (which is Christ) for us, must be imputed unto us: and that is the
righteousness which the Gospel propounds unto justification.

A third righteousness, whereby we should be justified, cannot be named. If
therefore we be not partakers of Christ's righteousness apprehended by faith, we
must stand to the sentence of the Law; which is, either to perform perfect and
perpetual obedience, or not to be justified. But if Christ's righteousness be
imputed unto us (as it is to all that apprehend it by faith) then are we
justified, notwithstanding the sentence of the Law, by Romans 3. 28. Galath. 2.
16.
faith, (that is, by the righteousness of Christ apprehended by faith) without
the works of the Law, that is, without any respect of obedience performed by
our selves. And in this liberty from the Law, stands the chief comfort and
stay of a Christian, when he summoning himself, as it were in the court of
his conscience before the judgment seat of God, to be justified, or
condemned, shall consider that by Christ he is freed, both from the
condemnation of the Law, and from the exaction of inherent righteousness to
justification: so that he shall not need to stand to the sentence of the Law,
or to trust to any obedience performed by himself, as it were to a broken
staff, wherein there can be no comfort, (for if God should enter into Psalm.
143. 2.
judgment with us according thereto, no man living could be justified) but may
safely and freely, without respect, either of his own obedience, or of the
sentence of the law, rely upon the mercies of God, and merits of Christ; that
for as much as the Lord has given him grace to believe, and by that faith has
Hos. 2. 10.
espoused him to Christ, and united him unto him as his member; he has also
communion in Christ's merits, whereby without regard to any righteousness of
his own, he is justified before God.

Against this part of Christian liberty, which is most comfortable, the Church
of Rome (as it well becomes the synagogue of Antichrist) does by might and
maine oppose it self: contending, not only that we are justified by
righteousness inherent; but also that the same obedience, which the Law
prescribes, is in greater perfection required in the Gospel unto
justification. By which doctrine of theirs, they confound the Law and the
Gospel, and in so doing abolish the covenant of grace, annihilate the maine
promise of the Gospel, which is the charter of our liberty, the ground of our
faith, the foundation of all our assurance for justification and salvation. For
if the Gospel promise and propound justification and salvation, upon the
condition of our own obedience, and that in more perfection then the law it
self required: then is it not only a covenant of works, as well as the law,
but also imposes a heauieryoke upon men's consciences, then the Law did. But it
is manifest that the Gospel is the covenant of grace made with Abraham Galath.
3. 8. 16. 17.
, concerning justification by faith in Christ; whereas the Law contrariwise is
the covenant of works, which 430. years after was delivered by Moses, and did
not disanull the former promise, concerning justification by faith. The
condition whereon the Gospel promises justification, is faith in Christ; the
condition of the Law, our own perfect and perpetual obedience. For the Gospel
Romans 10. 5. etc.
says; If thou believe in Christ, thou art justified and shall be saved: the
Law, If thou do these things, thou shall live thereby. The righteousness
exacted in the law to justification, is a righteousness both habitual inherent
in our selves, and actual performed by our selves. The righteousness Romans 3.
21. 22
which without the Law is revealed in the Gospel, is the righteousness of God,
that is, of Christ who is God, (for he is Jerem. 23. 6.
Iehoua, our righteousness, and was given unto us of God 1. Cor. 1. 30.
to be our righteousness) by the faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all
that believe, that is, the righteousness of Christ, who is God (though not the
righteousness of the Deity, as Osiander thought, but the righteousness both
inherent in him, as he was man, as his innocence and holiness, and also
performed by him, as his passive and active obedience) being apprehended by
faith, is according to the doctrine of the Gospel, imputed to every believer
unto justification.

That Christ is our righteousness, and the Romans 10. 4.
end of the Law unto righteousness to all that believe, that whosoever John 3.
16. Mark. 16. 16.
believes in Christ shall be saved, it is the maine doctrine of the Gospel,
the chief article of our religion, the charter of our inheritance, the
assurance which we have of salvation: which we are so to hold, as that if an
Galath. 1. 8. 9.
Angel from heaven should teach us another Gospel, or propound unto us
another way of justification, (as namely, by inherent righteousness, and our
own obedience) we ought to hold him accursed, and our selves also, if we yield
to him. For whosoever look to be justified by the obedience which the Law
prescribes, they Galath. 5. 4.
are separated from Christ, and fallen from grace.

We do not deny, but that the Gospel teaches repentance as well as faith;
and commends the duties of sanctification, as well as it promises
justification. Yea, as it promises the grace of justification to those that
believe; so to them that are justified and redeemed, it promises the Luke 1.
74. Jer. 31. 33. 34.
grace of sanctification by the spirit, whereby they are enabled in some
measure to worship God in holiness and righteousness. We do also confess,
that a greater measure of knowledge and obedience is required of the faithful
under the Gospel, then was under the Law; because to whom more is given, of
them more is required, and the greater benefit requires the greater duties of
thankfulness. But when the question is of the matter of our justification,
and merit of our salvation, whereby we being sinners and lost in our selves,
should be justified before God, and entitled unto the kingdom of heaven;
what that is, whereby we are absolved from our sins, and accepted as
righteous, and as heirs of eternal life; what that is, which will stand in
judgment before God, and which we may trust unto, when we appear before the
judgment seat of God, why the sentence of condemnation should not be
pronounced against us; what that is, whereby we are redeemed from death, and
reconciled unto God, or, as the scripture utters the same thing in other
terms, 2. Cor. 5. 19. Ephesians. 1. 7.
whereby we have remission of sins: it is most plain, that the doctrine of
the Gospel places the whole matter of justification, and merit of salvation
in the righteousness and obedience of Christ alone; by whose blood, as the
Apostle Romans 5. 9. 18. 19.
speaks, and by whose obedience, we are justified. As for that righteousness
which is in herent in our selves, though infused of God, and that obedience
which is performed by our selves, though proceeding from grace; the Gospel
teaches us, in the question of justification, Philip. 3. 8. 9.
to esteem it as dross and dung, yea as loss, that we may gain Christ, and
may be found in him, not having our own righteousness, which is prescribed in
the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
which is of God through faith.

This therefore is the liberty which we have by the grace of justification,
that we are freed from that miserable bondage of the law, which exacteth an
obedience and righteousness inherent unto justification, which no man is able
to perform, and therefore holds men in subjection to damnation, engendring
with Agar, Galath. 4. 24. etc.
as the Apostle speaks, none but servants, which shall not inherit with the
children of the free woman, that is, who are begotten by the Gospel, to be the
heirs of that righteousness which is by faith.

And thus much of the liberty of justification as. 13. The liberty of
justification as it is a right, with the privileges thereof.
it is an immunitie. For as it is (...), or right, it also contains many
notable privileges.

First, that we are not only freed from the guilt of sin, but also are
accepted and pronounced just, and by imputation of Christ's, both Romans 5. 9. 19.
passive and active obedience made righteous, which Romans 4. 6. 7. 2. Cor. 5. 21.
immediately follows upon the former, so that by our justification we are not
only made not guilty, but also stand righteous before God, and that, by the
righteousness of Christ.

Secondly, that we are not only freed from the curse of the law, but also are
made partakers of the Galath. 3. 13. 14. 16.
blessedness promised to Abraham, viz. that in his Genes. 22. 18.
seed, which is Christ, the faithful of all nations should be blessed. But
this will best appear in the particulars: for the faithful are not only
freed from the evils of this life, whether corporal or spiritual, as they be
curses; but they are all turned into blessings unto them. For this is the
privilege of the faithful, that the Lord causes all things, whether good or
bad, Romans 8. 28.
To work together for the good of those that do love him. In which sense
David says, Psalm. 1. 3.
that all things succeed well with the righteous man. As for afflictions, he
both professes in particular of himself, Psalm. 119. 71.
that it was good for him that he had been afflicted; and also in general,
pronounces the man psalm. 94. 12. 13.
blessed, whom the Lord does chastise and teach in his law.

Again, corporal death is not only no loss to the faithful, but also an
advantage; because in it they change a sinful and mortal life, for a life
blessed and immortal. It is not only no curse, but also a blessing: for it is
not only the end of sin and misery, but the beginning of perfect and
everlasting happiness: whereupon the holy Ghost Apoc. 14. 13.
pronounces them all blessed that die in the Lord.

Neither are the faithful only freed from fear of damnation, but also are
put in assurance of everlasting life, being Romans 8. 24.
saved in hope, which is the chief happiness that can be enjoyed in this life.

Thirdly, we are not only freed from the sentence of the law, exacting of us
perfect obedience unto justification, but we have also liberty to plead the
righteousness propounded in the covenant of grace; and to appeal from the
sentence of the law, to the promise of the Gospel; from the tribunal of
justice, to the throne of grace; and in the question of justification not at
all to regard our own obedience, but wholly to rest upon the mercies of God
and merits of Christ our savior.

Upon this liberty of justification follow other privileges. For first,
whereas by nature we are the children of wrath; now, Romans 5. 1.
being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus
Christ, who has Colos. 1. 20. 21
reconciled us to his Father.

2 Whereas sin makes a Esaias 59. 2.
separation between God and us, so that naturally we shun the presence of
God, as of a severe Judge; being justified by the righteousness of Christ, we
also have free Romans 5. 2. Ephesians. 3. 12. 1. John 5. 14.
access unto God by faith, and have liberty with boldness and assurance that
we shall be heard, to make our requests to God in the name of Christ.

3 Upon our justification by faith, we are endued with the Romans 5. 5. Ephesians. 1.
13. Romans 8. 15. 16. Galath. 4. 6. Ephesians. 4. 30.
spirit of adoption, which assures us of Gods fatherly love toward us,
teaching us to cry in our hearts, Abba Father; by which, being the earnest of
our inheritance, we are sealed up unto the day of our full redemption.

4 With the hope of salvation, which is Romans 8. 23. Tit. 2. 13.
a companion of justifying faith, and a consequent of justification, whereby we
live in expectation of everlasting happiness.

5 With joy Romans 5. 2. 3. 1. Pet. 1. 8.
in the holy Ghost, which Peter calls joy unspeakable and glorious. For the
Apostle denying that the liberty of Christians does chiefly stand in Romans 14.
17.
meat and drink, and in the free use of outward things; shows also wherein it
principally does consist. For the kingdom of God (says he) is not meat and
drink, but righteousness, which is the privilege of justification it self,
and peace and joy in the holy Ghost, which are consequents of the former.

Lastly, with perseverance. For John 8. 35.
the Son abides in the house for ever, being 1. Pet. 1. 5. (...).
safely kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation. For if Romans 8.
17.
sons, then heirs, heirs of God, and coheires with Christ, etc.

Now I come to the liberty which we have in. 14. The liberty of
sanctification. 1. From the deminion of sin.
our sanctification, and so far forth as we are sanctified. Now our
sanctification in this life being but in part, so is this liberty: which, as
it is an immunitie, is also a freedom from the bondage of sin, and of the Law;
though in other respects, then those that have been mentioned in the liberty
of justification.

For, in justification we are freed from the guilt of sin; in sanctification,
from the corruption of sin. But here we are to consider, how far forth we
are set free therefrom. For the hypocritical Papists teach, that when a man is
regenerated, or as they also speak, justified, original sin is so abolished,
as that it does not only not reign, but not so much as remain or live in the
party sanctified. By which doctrine they teach men to be desperate
hypocrites, either fearing their conscience, that they may have no sense of
sin, and may please themselves with this conceit, that they have no sin; in
which respect the saying of Peter 2. Pet. 2. 19.
is verified of them, That whiles they promise liberty to themselves and
others, they are indeed servants of corruption: or if they have any sense of
sin dwelling in them, they must persuade themselves they are not sanctified,
nor justified, and therefore not to be saved: such miserable comforters they
are of poor sinners, as to persuade them that they have not remission of sin,
vtill sin be quite abolished in them. But this doctrine they teach contrary to
the evident testimonies of Scripture, contrary to the perpetual experience of
the faithful, contrary to the light of their own conscience; that they might
thereby uphold their Antichristian doctrine of justification by inherent
righteousness, and of the merit of good works, which otherwise would fall to
the ground. For, if in respect of original sin, remaining and dwelling in us,
we be in our selves sinners; how can we be justified by inherent
righteousness? If our best actions be stained with the flesh, and our
righteousnesses Esaias 64. 6.
be like polluted clouts; how should they merit eternal life?

We are therefore to hold, that in regeneration we are freed from the
corruption of sin; not wholly, and at once, but in part, and by degrees; that
sin (though mortified in part, and we freed from the tyra^nie of it, that it
reign no more with full swinge and authority in us) still remains and
dwells in us, hindering us from good, provoking us unto evil, defiling and
contaminating our best actions, never suffering us with the full consent of
Galath. 5. 17.
will, to perform or desire that which is good. As the Apostle plainly
shows by his own example, Romans 7. Romans 7. 14. etc.
where the concupiscence remaining in him, is not only plainly called a sin,
but described as a sin, and as an (...), or a repugnancie to the law of God:
the sense whereof (though the Papists have no sense of it) made the holy
Apostle cry out, Romans 7. 24.
Miserable man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death?
Accursed therefore was the Counsel of Trent Sess. 5.
, which confessing that the Apostle calls it a sin; notwithstanding
pronounces them accursed, that shall say it is a sin. But if we say we have
no sin, we deceive our selves, says S. John 1. John 1. 8.
, and there is no truth in us.

The freedom therefore which we have in our sanctification, which as Augustine
says, is but begun in this life, is not from the being of sin in us altogether
and at once, though we be freed from it, in part and by degrees, but from the
dominion of it, that we should no more be feruants of sin, but being freed from
sin, might become feruants of righteousness, Romans 6. 6. 18. which Augustine Jn
Ioh. tract. 41.
did well observe out of the words of the Apostle, dehorting us that sin should
not remain in our mortal bodies. He does not say, let it not be; but, let it
not reign: for whiles thou live, it cannot be avoided, but that sin will be in
thy members; nevertheless let dominion be taken from it, etc. Of this liberty
the Apostle speaks, Romans 8. Romans 8. 1.
the law of the spirit of life which is in Christ, has made me free from the
law of sin and of death. That is, the power of the quickening Spirit, which
being in Christ our head, and from him communicated unto us, does rule in us as
a law, does free us from the power of sin which works death, that it no more
have dominion (as it were a law) in us. And Romans 6. Romans 6. 2. etc. ad 12.
having proved, that sin neither does, nor can any more reign in the
faithful: because after the similitude of Christ's death and resurrection, they
are dead to sin and risen again; and therefore, as death can no more have
dominion over Christ, being risen from death, no more can sin have dominion
over the faithful being once risen from the grave of sin: afterward, verse.
14. he assures the faithful, that sin shall Romans 6. 14.
not have dominion over them, because they be not under the Law, but under
grace. Likewise Saint John 1. John 3. 9. John 8. 34.
says, He that is borne of God, does not commit sin, namely, as a servant of
sin: yea, he adds, that he cannot sin, namely, with full swinge and consent
of will, as those which be servants of sin; because the seed of God remains
in him, whereby he is partly spirit, and not only flesh. And therefore as he
cannot perfectly will that which is good, because of the reluctation of the
flesh; so can he not will with full consent, that which is evil, because of
the reluctation of the spirit.

Secondly, we are in our sanctification freed. 15. 2. Freedom from the
dominion of the law.
from the Law. But we are here also to consider, quatenus, how far forth. For
the Bellarm. de iustif. lib. 4. cap. 5. etc. 1.
Papists charge us, that we place Christian liberty in this, that we are
subject to no law in our conscience, and before God; and that we are free from
all necessity of doing good works: which is a most devilish slander. For
although they absurdly confound justification and sanctification; yet they know
we do not: neither are they ignorant, but that we put a great difference
between them in this respect. For though we teach that the obedience of the
Law is not required in us to justification, but that we are freed from the
exaction of the Law in that behalf: yet we deny not, but that unto
sanctification the obedience of the Law is required, and we by necessity of
duty, bound to the observation thereof. We confess that to be free from
obedience, is to be the servants of sin, and the willing and cheerful worship
of God, in Luk 1. 74.
holiness and righteousness without fear, to be true liberty. We acknowledge
that the moral law of God is perpetual and immutable; and that this is an
everlasting truth, that the creature is bound to worship and obey his Creator,
and so much the more bound, as he has received greater benefits. Indeed we say
with Luther De libert. Christ.
that in our justification we are restored to a state of justice, from which
Adam fell; but yet, as we teach that we are no more bound to obedience, that
thereby we might be justified, then Adam who was already just; so we profess,
that in allegiance and thankfulness, we are more bound to obey then he, yea, we
profess that God does therefore free us from the curse, and the bondage of the
law, that we might be enabled with freedom of spirit to obey it; and that
being freed from sin Romans 6. 18.
, we are made the servants of righteousness. We teach, that God having sworn
Luke 1. 73. 74.
, that to those whom he justifies, he will give grace to worship him in
holiness and righteousness; no man can be assured of his justification without
obedience: that sanctification being the end of our Ephesians. 1. 4. 1 Thessalonians. 4.
7. Titus 2. 14. Ephesians. 2. 10.
election, calling, redemption and regeneration, it is a necessary consequent
of saving grace. We teach and profess, that howsoever good works do not
concur with faith, unto the act of justification, as a cause thereof; yet
they concur in the party justified, as necessary fruits of faith, and
testimonies of justification. And as we teach with Paul Romans 3. 28. Galath. 2.
16.
that faith alone does justify; so with James Jam. 2. 14. etc.
, that the faith which is alone does not justify. We teach, that the blood of
Christ, as it acquitteth us from the guilt of sin; so does it also purge Hebr.
9. 14.
our consciences from dead works, to serve the living God; that he bare 1.
Pet. 2. 24.
in his body upon the cross our sins, that we being delivered from sin,
should live in righteousness: that whom Christ does justify by faith, them he
does sanctify by his Spirit; that whosoever 2. Cor. 5. 17.
is in Christ, he is a new creature, Gal. 5. 24.
crucifying the flesh with the lusts thereof, and Romans 8. 1.
walking not after the flesh, but after the spirit. We profess that good
works are necessary to salvation, though not necessitate efficientiae, as
causing it, as the Papists teach; yet necessitate praesentiae, as nenessarie
fruits of our faith, whereby we are to glorify God, and to testify our
thankfulness, to do good to our brethren, and to make sure 2. Pet. 1. 10.
our election, calling and justification unto our selves; as necessary
foreru^ners of salvation, being the undoubted badges of them that shall be
saved, being the way wherein we are to Ephesians. 2. 10.
walk to everlasting life, being the evidence according to which God will
judge us at the last day. And lastly, that as by justification God does entitle
us unto his kingdom; so by sanctification he does fit and prepare us thereto.

We do not therefore by the doctrine of justification through faith, abolish
the Law, but rather as the Apostle says Romans 3. 31.
, stablish it. For the more a man is assured of his free justification, the
better he is enabled, and the more he is bound to obey it.

But although we be bound to obey the Law, as the subjects of God, and servants
of righteousness; and although the Law has singular use in those that are
justified, (as being a rule of direction for our obedience, in the performance
of the duties of piety toward God, of justice toward our neighbor, of
sobriety toward our selves; and a glass of detection, to manifest the
imperfections of our obedience, to keep us from Pharisaisme: and lastly, a
rod of correction, in respect of the flesh or the old man, yet remaining in
us, that by precepts, by exhortations and comminations, it more and more may
be mortified in us, and we kept from the spirit of slumber and security:) yet
notwithstanding we are not under the law, as the Apostle Romans 6. 14.
says, but under grace. We are therefore in our sanctification freed, though
not from the obedience, yet from the servitude and bondage of the law, and that
in three respects:

First, in respect of the irritation of it. In which 16. Freedom from the
irritation of the Law.
regard especially the law is called the 1 Cor. 15. 56.
strength of sin: not that the law causes or provoke sin properly, for
the Romans 7. 12.
law is holy, just and good; but only by accident, and occasionally. For such
is the corruption of our untamed Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata.
Gens humana ruit in vetitum nefas.
nature, until we be renewed by the spirit of God; that when the law, which is
holy and good, forbids sin, seeking to stop the course of our
concupiscences, and to bridle our sinful affections; thereby our untamed
corruption rebelleth so much the Quod non licet, acrius vrit.
more; and that it might appear Romans 7. 13. 8.
(...), exceedingly sinful, by occasion of the law works in us all manner
of concupiscence. Even, as a deep river, when nothing hinders his course,
has a still, and as it were, a dead motion; but if you seek to restrain or
stop his course, he will swell and ouerflowe all, now disdaining, as it were,
a bridge: so our corruption, when it freely takes his own course, seems to
be quiet, and as it were dead: but when the commandment comes, Romans 7. 9.
says the Apostle, as it were to damme it up, sin reuiueth and rises
against it, swelling and ouerflowing, as it were, his wonted banks. In this
respect, the law (says the Master of the Lib. 3. did. 40. ^.
Sentences) is called a killing letter, because forbidding sin, it increases
concupiscence, and adds transgression until grace do free us. But when we
are regenerated by the spirit of sanctification, and by the bond of the same
spirit coupled unto Christ; we are freed from this bondage, even as the wife is
freed from the dominion of her husband by his death. For even as whilst we
were in the flesh altogether unregenerate, the law, as it were our husband,
occasionally and by accident begot in our souls, wholly corrupted with sin,
evil motions and concupiscences, as the fruits and issue of our flesh tending
unto death: so we being regenerated, and after a sort dead unto this
corruption, and consequently being mortified to the law in respect of the
irritation thereof, and the law in that regard dead unto us, the spirit of
Christ, who has united us unto him as our second husband, begets good
motions in us as the fruits of the spirit, acceptable unto God. This is that
which the Apostle teaches, Romans 7. 1. etc.
Romans 7. for having said chap. 6. 14. that sin shall not have dominion over
us, because we are not under the law but under grace, after he had answered an
objection, and prevented the abuse of this doctrine, which carnal men would
make thereof, as though they might sin freely, because they are not under the
law: in the beginning of the seventh chapter he proves, that we are not under
the Law, but under grace, by that similitude which even now I mentioned:
because being regenerated and dead unto sin, we are mortified to the Law, and
the Law to us in respect of the irritation thereof, caused by our corruption;
and consequently are delivered from the power of it, as a wife is freed from
the dominion of her husband, when he is dead.

Secondly, in our sanctification we are freed Freedom from the terror or
coaction of the Law.
from the coaction and terror of the Law, breeding servile fear in me^
unregenerate; whereby, as bondserua^ts or gally-slaues by ye whip, they are
enforced to the performance of some outward duties, which otherwise they are
unwilling to do. For those who are under the Law, as all men are by nature, are
like bond-slaues; who for avoiding of punishment, are by terror drawn to do
some forced service, which is so much the more unwilling, because they look
for no reward. This in the Scriptures is called sometimes (...), Romans 8. 15.
the spirit of bondage, and sometimes (...), 2. Tim. 1. 7.
the spirit of fear, from which we are delivered, when we receive the spirit
of adoption and sanctification; whereby we are enabled to worship God in
holiness and righteousness, (...), without servile fear, according to the
covenant of grace made with Abraham, Luke 1. Luke 1. 74.
And in this sense it is said, that the Law 1. Tim. 1. 9.
is not imposed on the just; to whom, being as it were a law unto themselves,
and willingly performing that which is right, the terror and coaction of the
Law, so far forth as they are regenerate, is needless.

Thirdly, as we are freed from the coaction and Freedom from the rigor or
exaction of the Law.
terror of the Law, so also from the exaction and rigor of the Law, which they
call (...): which though it be a liberty of sanctification, and appertaining
to our new obedience; yet it depends on the liberty of justification. For as
there we were freed from the Laws exaction of inherent righteousness, to the
acceptance of our persons: so here we are freed from the Laws exaction of
perfect obedience, to the acceptance of our actions. So that whereas the law
condemns every the least imperfection or defect, not agreeing with that
perfection of justice, which it prescribes, as a sin, or (...), and
pronounces the party in whom that defect or imperfection is, accursed:
notwithstanding the new obedience of Gods children, wrought in them by the
Spirit of God, and performed according to the measure of grace received; though
defective in it self, and stained with the flesh, is accepted of God; who
covers their imperfections with the perfect obedience of Christ, and not so
much respects the perfection of the outward act, which he does not expect
from such weakness, as the integrity of the heart, the uprightness of the
will and desire, the sincerity of the endeavor; which, if it be not wanting, the
Lord 2. Cor. 8. 12.
accepts the will for the deed, and true endeavor striving Phil. 3. 14. 15
toward perfection, for the perfect performance. In which respect, the Lord,
according to his gracious promise, Malac. 3. 17. Psalm. 103. 13.
uses clemency toward us, as a tender father uses clemency toward his
son, taking in good part the childish endeavor of his children, proceeding
from an unfeigned desire to please him.

But our liberty in sanctification is not only an. 17. The liberty of
sanctification as it is a right, with the privileges thereof.
immunitie, but also an (...), or right, consisting of great privileges. For,
first we are not only freed in part from the corruption of sin, which we
call mortification; but are also positiuely made righteous, being, as the
Apostle Peter speaks, made partakers 2. Pet. 1. 4.
of the divine nature, in that flying from the corruption which is in the world
by lust, we are renewed according to the Ephesians. 4. 24.
image of God, in holiness and righteousness. For as the sacred oil being
powered on the head of Psalm. 133.
Aaron, (who was a type of Christ) distilled unto his lower parts: so the Psalm.
45 8.
oil of grace wherewith Christ our head was anointed John 3. 34.
without measure, is derived even to his inferior members here on earth, who
are also therewith 2. Cor. 1. 21.
anointed, Ioh. 2. 20. 27. John 1. 16.
receiving of his fullness, even grace for grace. Neither are we only freed
from the servitude of sin, Satan, and the world, but in Christ our King, who
has overcome John 16. 33. Coloss. 2. 15.
the world, and triumphed over sin and Satan, we are also made Kings Apocal. 1.
6. Rom 16. 20. 2. Cor. 2. 14. Romans 8. 37.
, with assurance to be conquerers of all the enemies of our salvation.

And as touching the Law, we are not only freed from the irritation thereof,
whereunto our own corruption did make us subject, as unto a husband, who begot
foul issue of us tending to death, and so left at large: but we are also
joined to another husband which is Christ, by his Spirit, whereby Romans 7. 4.
he produces in us the fruits of the spirit, to the glory of God. Neither
does the law only cease to provoke us unto sin; but, when we are once
sanctified, it becomes, as David Psalm. 119. 24.
speaks, a counselor unto us, and a directour unto good things.

Neither are we freed only from the spirit of bondage and fear, but are also
endued with the spirit of liberty and grace, the spirit Romans 8. 15.
of adoption, the spirit of 2. Tim. 1. 7.
power, and of love, and of sobriety: which spirit having shed Romans 5. 5.
abroad the love of God in our hearts, testifying unto us our adoption, and as
an Ephesians. 1. 14.
earnest assuring us of our inheritance, and enflaming our hearts with a
reciprocal love of God, and of our neighbor for his sake: we begin to delight
Romans 7. 22. Psalm. 1. 2. 119. 24
in the law of God, as concerning the inner man, neither are the Commandemens
of God 1. John 5. 3.
grievous unto us, and we begin to serve the Lord not only without fear, but
also with 1. Chron. 28. 9
willing minds and upright hearts. For those who are redeemed and sanctified by
Christ, are (...), Psalm. 110. 3.
a people of willingness, a Titus 2. 14.
a people peculiar to himself, zealous of good works.

And lastly, concerning the rigor of the Law; we have not only this immunitie,
that the imperfections of our sincere obedience are not imputed unto us; but
also this privilege, that our imperfect obedience, which in it self is
worthy to be rejected, notwithstanding is both accepted of God, and rewarded.
For Christ having washed us with his blood, and sanctified us by his Spirit,
has made us both kings, as I said before, and also Apocal. 1. 6.
Priests, or as Peter speaks, 1. Pet. 2. 5. 9.
a royal and holy Priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
by Jesus Christ: the sacrifice of obedience whereby we offer our selves Romans
12. 1.
as a lively, holy and acceptable sacrifice unto God, which is our reasonable
service: the sacrifice of alms, whereby we offer our goods, with which Hebr.
13. 16.
sacrifices God is well pleased: the sacrifice of a broken and contrite heart
Psalm. 51. 19.
which is to God in stead of all sacrifices: the sacrifice of prayer, which is
accepted Psalm. 141. 2.
as incense, and as the evening sacrifice: the sacrifice of praise, that is,
the Hebr. 13. 15.
fruit, or as Hosea Hos. 14. 3.
speaks, the calves of our lips, which the Lord prefers Psalm. 50. 13. 14.
23.
before the sacrifices of goats and bulls: all which, though in themselves
defective and imperfect, are notwithstanding acceptable unto God, through the
mediation of Christ; who, making intercession for us, perfumeth Apoc. 8. 3. 4.
al these sacrifices of ours, with the odours of his own sacrifice, that so
they may be acceptable, and sweet smelling savors unto God.

Neither are they only accepted, but also rewarded. For our Prou. 11. 18. Psalm.
19. 11.
obedience, our Hebr. 10. 35. James 1. 12.
confidence, our patience, our Mat. 6. 4. 6. 18.
prayer, fasting, alms, and Luke 6. 35.
charitable deeds have their rewards, in so much that Mat. 10. 42.
a cup of cold water given in charity, shall not lose his reward. In respect
whereof, we may well say with David Psalm. 62. 13.
unto thee Lord, mercy: for thou rewardest a man according to his work. Which
plainly proves, that the reward of our obedience is not to be ascribed to the
merit of our works, (which in themselves cannot stand in judgment) but to the
mercies of God in Christ. For there is great mercy in not imputing unto us the
imperfections of our works; greater, in accepting of them as if they were
perfect; but greatest of all in rewarding them. The consideration whereof, ought
to animate and stir us up with willing and cheerful minds, to obey God, to
serve him, to call upon him, and to perform such duties as he requires of us;
because we are to be assured, that he does not impute unto us our wants, but
accept our imperfect obedience, and not only favorably accept it, but also
graciously reward it.

Hitherto we have spoken of the common liberty of Christians: which being (as
we have heard). 18. The special liberty of Christians, or that which is
peculiar to the faithful under the Gospel.
conferred upon us in our vocation, justification, and sanctification; we are
to be exhorted to give all diligence, both that we may be called, justified,
and sanctified, and also that our calling, justification, and sanctification
may be made sure unto us, by leading a godly life. For if we be not sanctified,
nor justified, nor called, then are we (whatsoever we are, rich or poor,
noble or base, learned or unlearned) the most miserable bondslaues of sin and
Satan; and being servants, howsoever for a time we retain a place in the
house of God, yet we shall not abide for ever, but when the time of separation
comes, we shall be cast out: whereas contrariwise being made free by our
calling, justification and sanctification, as the sons of God, we shall have
the privilege of sons, which is, John 8. 35.
to abide in the house of God for ever.

Now follows the Christian liberty, which is peculiar to the faithful under
the Gospel. For the faithful under the old Testament, though they were sons
and heirs, and therefore enjoyed the former liberties by Christ, in whom they
believed: notwithstanding until the fullness of time came, which was the full
age of the Church, they were under years; and therefore as sons, during their
minority, were subject to Gal. 4. 1. etc. and 3. 24.
schoolemasters and Tutors, whereby are meant the pedagogie and government of
the typical Church of the Jews, contained in the ceremonial and judicial
laws of Moses; in which regard, they, though sons, seemed little to differ
from servants. Both these laws were appendices of the law moral: the
ceremonial, of the first table, determining the particulars of that peculiar
worship which he prescribed to the typical Church, until the coming of
Christ. The judicial, of the second, determining the particulars of that
peculiar policy which he prescribed to the Commonwealth of the Jews. So that
the ceremonial, were the Ecclesiastical laws of that Church; the judicial,
the civil laws of that Commonwealth. Both were yokes of bondage, as the
Apostle speaks Galath. 5. 1.
in respect of the Jews, on whose consciences these laws were imposed,
binding them to the strict observation thereof; in regard whereof, they are
called an Act. 15. 10.
unsupportable yoke, under which notwithstanding, the faithful were (...),
Galath. 4. 3.
held in bondage. And as touching the Gentiles, they were as a Ephesians. 2. 14.
wall of separation between them and the Jews, and as the door of Noah's
Arc, excluding all from salvation that were not of that Church, either as
borne Jews, or as proselytes. For the rest were Ephesians. 2. 12.
without Christ, aliants from the Commonwealth of Israel, strangers from the
couena^ts of promise, having no hope, living without God in the world. This wall
of partitio^ Ephesians. 2. 14. etc.
our Savior Christ by his death has dissolved, taking away all difference

between Jews and Gentiles, freeing and exempting, both the one and the
other, from the obedience both of the judicial and ceremonial law, which were
given to put a difference between the Jews and the Gentiles, until the
fullness of time, Galath. 4. 4.
Gal. 4. 4. the time Hebr. 9. 10.
of reformation, that is, until the coming of the Messiah, by whose death
they were to be 2. Cor. 3. 11. 13.
abrogated. For howsoever the faithful, before the Church came to full age,
were in bondage under the ceremonial, and judicial law, as under scholemasters
and Tutors; yet, when Gal. 4. 3. 4. 5.
the fullness of time came, God sent his Son borne of a woman, and borne
under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the law: meaning that
we are redeemed, not only from the moral law, in the respects before named;
but also from the ceremonial and judicial, even in respect of obedience.

For as touching the ceremonial law, as it was an Coloss. 2. 14. (...). Ephesians.
2. 15.
handwriting of ordinances which was (though underhand) against us; Christ
has cancelled it, and nailed it to his cross. As it was a Hebr. 10. 1.
Coloss. 2. 17. John 1. 17.
shadow and figure of things to come, Christ has abolished it, by performing
that indeed, which it did but shadow and prefigure: for the law was given by
Moses, but grace and truth by Christ. For as grace is opposed to the curse, so
truth to figures: the ceremonies therefore of the law gave place as shadows to
the body, and as figures to the truth.

The civil or judicial law, being the positive laws of that people, Christ
abrogated, when according to the prophecy of Daniel Dan. 9. 26. 27
, he destroying the Commonwealth of the Jews, their city and temple, did
withal abolish their policy and laws. For the very city, temple, and whole
state of the Jews, being types and shadows of Christ and his Church, were,
when Christ was exhibited, and his universal Church by preaching the Gospel
to all nations, planted Matthew. 24. 14
, to give place; and with them, their laws, which were to hold but till the
fullness of time. For as the Apostle says, the Priesthood (namely of Aaron)
being translated, Hebr. 7. 12.
the law (namely of Moses) is also translated.

Howbeit there is some difference between the abrogating of the Ceremonial,
and of the Judicial law: the ceremonial rites, because they were principally
ordained to prefigure Christ, are so abolished, that it is not lawful for
Christians to observe them, for that were to deny that Christ is come. Ea no^
obseruant Christiani (says Contra Faustum Manich. lib. 19. cap. 18.
Augustine) per quae Christus promittebatur; nec adhuc promittuntur, quia iam
impleta sunt: Christians do not observe those things, by which Christ was
promised; neither are they still promised, because they are already fulfilled.
The judicial ordinances, because they principally tended to the observation of
justice and equity, may be used, so they be not imposed or observed by virtue
of the judicial law: for that were, though indirectly, to deny that the
Messiah is already come. Both laws were dead with Christ, though they were
not buried, but as it were kept above ground, even by Christians among the
Jews, until the dissolution of the temple and city of Jerusalem. After which
time, the ceremonial precepts were not only dead, as Tho. 1a. 2a, quaest. 104.
3. cap.
one says, but also deadly to the obseruers of them; but the judicials not so.

Now, this Christian liberty, as it is an immunitie, is a freedom from all
bond of conscience, in. 19. Peculiar Christian liberty, as it is an immunitie.
respect of outward things, which are neither commanded nor forbidden in the
eternal law of God. Of which there are two sorts, the ordinances of men
concerning things indifferent, and the creatures of God.

For as touching the former, seeing there is no law that binds the conscience
properly, but only the law of God, in which sense he is called James 4. 12.
our only Lawgiver, and seeing we are freed from those laws of God, which
determined those particulars, which are neither commanded nor forbidden in the
moral law of God: it is plain therefore, that our conscience is free in respect
of these things. As for the laws of men, whether they be ecclesiastical or
civil, they do not properly bind the conscience; because neither is simple
obedience due unto them, neither can they make any particular, which in respect
of the moral law, is indifferent, as being neither commanded nor forbidden, to
be simply necessary. The conscience of a Christian is exempted from humane
power, and cannot be bound, but where God does bind it. And therefore the
Apostle, as he charge the Corinthians, that, seeing they were 1. Cor. 7. 23.
bought with a price, they should not be the servants of me^, (which is not to
be understood of external servitude, but of the bondage of the conscience) and
likewise the Colossians, Coloss. 2. 16.
that no man should condemn them, (that is, take upon him to bind the
conscience with guilt of sin) in respect of meat and drink, or holy days: so
he reproves the Coloss. 2. 20. 21. 22.
Colossians, for observing the traditions of men, with opinion of necessity,
as if the conscience were bound by them, or religion were to be placed in them.

Herein therefore the Church of Rome is also an enemy to Christian liberty, not
only in burdening Christians with an heap of innumerable traditions and
ceremonies; but chiefly, in imposing them upon the conscience: teaching, that
the traditions of the Church are with like Conc. Trid. Sess. 4.
reverence, and equal affection of piety to be received, as the written word
of God; and that the commandments of the Church, even concerning outward
things, do bind the conscience. And although many of their ceremonies be
wicked; more, ridiculous; most of them, superfluous; yet so absurd they are, as
to impose them to be observed, not only with opinion of necessity, as binding
the conscience, but also of worship, of perfection, of merit, of spiritual
efficacy.

Secondly, by this liberty we are freed from scrupulositie of conscience, in
respect of the creatures, which are ordained for our use; the difference of
clean and unclean (which was made by the ceremonial law) being taken away.
Nothing, says our Savior Christ, Mat. 15. 11.
that goes into the mouth, defiles a man. And Paul, Romans 14. 14.
I know, says he, and am persuaded by the Lord lesus, that there is nothing
common or unclean of it self.

But this liberty is not only an immunitie, but also an (...), or power, both
in respect of the ordinances. 20. Peculiar Christian liberty, as it is a right.
of men, and also of the creatures of God. For, being freed from the
ceremonial, and judicial laws of God, and therefore not tied to any
particular or certain laws, which should determine the particulars not
mentioned in the word of God: hereupon arises a liberty, both to Law-giuers,
and those who are subject to laws. The Law-giuers are not restrained to any
particulars, but have liberty to ordain such wholesome, either constitutions
Ecclesiastical, or laws civil, as are not repugnant to the word of God.
Laws there must be, to determine the particulars not mentioned in the general
law of God: for they are the very bond of humane societies, necessary for the
execution of the laws of God, and for the maintenance of peace and order among
men. Neither can it be denied, but that as the judicial law being abolished,
it is lawful for Law-giuers to ordain civil laws; so likewise the
ceremonial law being abrogated, to establish laws Ecclesiastical. Only the
question is, who must be these Law-giuers. Surely, not the Presbyteries of
every parish, which never were in use in the Primitive Church, but Synodes; as
appears by the perpetual practice of the Church, both in the Apostles times,
and ever since. Synodes, I say, either provincial, or national; and those
assembled, either out of some one nation, or out of some more then one, which
some call Concilia media, or lastly general. The authority of Synodes
provincial and national has always been of great regard, though there
wanted a Christian Magistrate to second and confirm them, being both assembled
and moderated by the authority of Metropolitanes and Archbishops: but when
both national Synodes are assembled, and the Synodall constitutions ratified
by the authority of the Sovereign, and that according to the positive laws
of the land, authorizing him so to do; I see not, why men should not as well
think themselves bound to observe laws Ecclesiastical, as Civil. For though
some make a difference between them in this behalf, because civil laws
determining particulars belonging to the second table, cannot be violated
without breaking the second table, whereas ecclesiastical laws determining
particulars appertaining to the first table, may be broken without
transgressing of the first table; yet, who sees not the weakness of this
distinction? Seeing the second table is broken by disobeying the lawful
authority of superiors (which we ought to obey for conscience sake) as well
by transgressing the one, as the other. Superiors in the Church are to be
honored and obeyed by the fifth Commandment, and other Scriptures Heb. 13. 17.
, as well as superiors, in the commonwealth. And if their constitutions, when
they wanted the concurrence of a Christian Magistrate, were of force in ye
Primitive Church; then much greater is their validity, being confirmed by the
authority of the Sovereign, and the Sovereign authorized thereunto by law.

The freedom of the subject is, that being freed from the yoke of the
judicial and ceremonial law, he may with a free conscience obey any other
laws whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, which, being not dissonant from the
word of God, are or shall be imposed upon him. Which, though it be a plain and
evident truth, yet by some men it is not observed.

And as touching the use of the creatures, and of al things indifferent, we are
to know, that the right and dominion we had over the creatures, which was lost
in Adam, is restored in Christ, (for all are yours, says the Apostle 1. Cor.
3. 22.
, and you are Christ's) and that not only for Christians under the Gospel, but
also for all the faithful from the beginning. For we read, Genesis 9. Genesis 9. 2.
3.
, that to Noah, who was the heir Heb. 11. 7.
of the righteousness, which is by faith, the grant was renewed, and free use
of the creatures permitted. Howbeit this freedom was by the ceremonial law
restrained, not only after the giving of the law by Moses; but also before, a
difference being put Genesis 7. 2. 9. 4.
between things clean and unclean: which difference by Christ is taken away.
For, no Romans 14. 14.
creature is unclean of it self, but every 1. Tim. 4. 4.
creature is good, and nothing to be refused, but may be received with
thanksgiving. Yea of all outward things, not forbidden of God, which commonly
are called things in different, the Apostle affirms in general, that 1. Cor.
6. 12.
all things are lawful, and Tit. 1. 15.
to the pure all things are pure. By this liberty therefore the faithful are
privileged, with freedom of conscience, to use or forbear any of the
creatures of God created for our use, or things in different, without opinion
of necessity to be brought 1. Cor. 6. 12.
under the power thereof, or placing religion therein. In which respect, Basil
fitly calls things indifferent, (...), things in our power, or left to our
liberty.

But here, for avoiding of error, three things are. 21. Application of the
general doctrine to this particular.
from the general doctrine to be repeated. First, that this also is a liberty
of the sons of God: secondly, that it is spiritual: and thirdly, that it is
a true liberty. For as touching the first; though all 1. That this also is a
liberty of the sons of God.
things be pure to the pure; yet Tit. 1. 15.
to them that are unclean and unbelieving, nothing is clean. Though to 1.
Cor. 6. 12. 1. Tim. 4. 3.
the faithful all these outward things are lawful; yet to the wicked and
unbelievers nothing is lawful, yea, those actions, which are materially good,
as being commanded of God, as they proceed from them, are turned into sin.
Which is spoken, not to this end, to drive men into desperate courses; but to
force them, without further delays, to break off the course of their sins by
speedy and unfeigned repentance, and to sue unto God for mercy and pardon in
Christ; because this is the only thing which they may lawfully do and without
sin, and which until they do, they do nothing else but sin, and by sin
hoord up wrath against the day of wrath, etc.

Secondly, though this liberty concern outward 2. That this also is a
spiritual liberty.
things; yet it self is inward and spiritual, as being a liberty of the
conscience. Now the conscience respects God, as our outward actions and the
external fruits of our conscience respect men; men; who may moderate or
restrain the external actions, wherein the outward use of our liberty
consists; the inward liberty notwithstanding of the conscience before God,
remaining entire. They greatly err, says Calvin, who think that their
Jnstit. lib. 3. cap. 19.. 10.
Christian liberty is nothing, unless they use it before men. But they ought
to think, that by their liberty they obtain no new thing in the sight of
men, but before God; and that their liberty consists as well in abstaining,
as using. If they know, that it is a thing indifferent before God, whether they
eat flesh or eggs, put on red or black apparel: it is enough, and more then
enough. The conscience is now loose, whereto the benefit of this liberty does
appertain: therefore, though hereafter they abstain from flesh all their
life, and always wear one color; they are never the less free. Yea
therefore because they are free, they do with a free conscience abstain.

Thirdly, as this liberty is spiritual, so also a true 3. That this also is a
true liberty.
liberty. Now all true and lawful liberty of creatures, is limited and
bounded: the liberty of the Creator alone, being uncircumcised. Wherefore if
any arrogate to themselves an unbounded liberty, it is a licentiousness, and
not a true liberty. As first, in regard of laws and commandments of men;
there are bounds set, first to the lawgiuers, in respect both of the things
commanded, and also of the manner of commanding. For, lawgiuers may not assume
unto them a liberty to command what they list, but only such things as they
know, not to be repugnant to the law of God. For they must know, that al their
laws are limited by the law of God, and themselves a upon pain of damnation,
restrained from commanding that which God forbids, and from forbidding that
which God commands. For by wicked laws, they make themselves like Jeroboam,
who caused all Israel to sin. Moreover, they must be careful, not only to
command that which is lawful; but also in civil laws, those things which be
expedient, and profitable for the weal public; and in laws Ecclesiastical,
such things as tend 1. Cor. 14. 26. 40.
to decency, to order, and edification. Otherwise, though the subject may
lawfully obey, in such cases; yet the Lawgiuer offends in abusing his
authority, which was given him for the good of the inferiors.

Again, in respect of the manner, superiors must keep them within their
bounds, and not take upon them the authority of our James 4. 12.
one only Lawgiuer, who has power to save, and to destroy; which is, to bind
the consciences of men, as, by imposing that upon the conscience as simply
necessary, which God by his law has left indifferent; or by teaching Mat. 15.
2. 9.
men to place religion in the observation of their traditions. For this is the
practice of the Antichrist of Rome; who, usurping the authority of God, and
challenging to himself a boundless power, sits in the consciences of men,
as God.

Likewise to the subject; for as he may not think, that he has liberty to
obey any laws of men, though unlawful, and much less to place religion or
perfection in the observation of them, as the Papists do: so on the other side,
he may not think, that he has liberty to break the laws of men, though
not unlawful, and much less to place religion or perfection therein; as they
seem to do, who use to be opposite to the Papists in the contrary extreme.
For, I beseech you, do not many among us, think themselves the more religious,
for refusing obedience and conformity to the laws, and censure others as
formalists and time-seruers? But beloved, as we are not to judge Romans 14. 1. 3.
etc.
those, who out of weakness refuse conformity; so those which be refractarie,
should not think, either the better of themselves for not conforming, or the
worse of others for conforming. The kingdom Romans 14. 17.
of God does not stand in these things. And certainly, if Galath. 5. 6. and 6.
15.
neither circumcision, nor uncircumcision avail any thing; then much less the
use or forbearance of those ceremonies, which are in controversy among us.
Does not the Apostle plainly tell us, 1. Cor. 8. 8.
that these outward things do not commend us unto God, and that neither the
use or forbearance of them in it self does make us either better, or worse
before God? But when they be used or forborne with disobedience to lawful
authority, without due regard of avoiding scandal, with uncharitable
censuring and judging one of another, with alienation of the affection of one
brother from another; doubtless there is fault committed. And who sees not,
that while contentions grow hot about these things, both charity and piety
waxes cold?

Secondly, in respect of the creatures and things indifferent, though we have
free liberty to use or forbear them; yet it is not a boundless liberty. For
the law of God has set it four bounds, viz. piety, loyalty, charity, and
sobriety. Piety, respecting Gods glory and worship: Loyalty, having
reference to superiors; Charity, to all men; Sobriety, to our selves. Can
thou not use thy liberty in some particular, without Gods dishonor, or neglect
of his service? Remember, that whether 1. Cor. 10. 31.
you eat or drink, or whatsoever you do, you must do all to the glory of
God. Cannot thy liberty be used, without contempt of the Magistrates lawful
authority? Remember, that God has commanded thee to obey thy superiors in all
lawful things, as 1. Cor. 6. 12.
all things (not forbidden by God) are lawful; that all authority is Romans 13.
1. 2. 5.
from God, and that, he which resists lawful authority, resists God;
that they which resist, shall receive to themselves judgment; and that thou
must obey not only for fear, but also for conscience sake. Remember what S.
Peter says, 1 Pet. 2. 13. 16.
Be subject to all humane ordinance, whether the sovereign, or subordinate
governors. But how? As free, and not as having the liberty for a cloak of
naughtines, but as the servants of God. Can it not be used without the offense
of thy weak brother? Take heed, says the Apostle, 1. Cor. 8. 9. 10. 24. Romans
14. 15. 16.
lest thy liberty be an offense to the weak. For he that scandalizeth his
brother, sins against Christ. Wherefore if meat offend my brother, I will
not eat flesh whiles the world stands, rather then I will offend him. Lastly,
can it not be used in some particular, unless thou shall pass the bounds of
sobriety, temperance, humility, modesty, frugalitie, etc? Remember, what the
Apostle says, Galath. 5. 13.
Brethren you are called to liberty, only use not your liberty as an occasion
to the flesh.

But here arises a doubtful question, the explication. 22. Decision of a
doubtful question, what is to be done, when we seem to be in a strait
between disobedience to the Magistrate, and offense to the weak.
whereof is needful for these times. For sometimes there seems to be a
conflict between the law of loyalty, and the law of charity; as when that
which the Magistrate commands, cannot (as we think) be observed without the
offense or scandal of the weak. In which case of Antiomie (which some say is
our case) diverse know not which way to turn them, and others erroneouslie
choose to disobey the Magistrate, rather then seem to offend their weak
brethren.

Consider therefore uprightly what I shall say, and the Lord give you
understanding minds, and tractable hearts, to see and embrace the truth.

First therefore understand, that we are never cast into such an exigent
between two sins not yet committed; but there is an issue from them both
without a third. Suppose therefore, that in this case there were an Antinomie,
or such an oppositio^ between the two laws of loyalty and charity, as that
the one could not be observed, without the neglect of the other. In such cases
of Antinomie, we are to know, that if we obey the superior law, unto which we
are more bound, as having higher and more principal ends; the inferior Matthew.
12. 7. Jerem. 7. 22. Luke 14. 26.
(which gives place unto it) is not broken. Now, the supreme end is the glory
of God; then, the common salvation of the Church; then, every man's own
salvation; then, the salvation of his neighbor; then, the common outward good
of the Church, or Commonwealth; then, our own; then, our neighbors. So that
public and common goods are to be preferred before private, and spiritual
before corporal, and the glory of God before all. Well then, thou say thou
may not yield to the ceremonies, as namely, the Surplice, the Cross, and
kneeling at Communion; because these things cannot be done without scandalizing
of thy brother. Suppose it were so, and remember that I do but suppose it. But
on the other side, thou refusing the use of indifferent things, whereunto thy
Christian liberty extends, being enjoined by lawful authority, with such
conditions as these are enjoined; I say unto thee without supposition, that
besides thy disobeying the lawful authority of a Christian Church, and of a
Christian Magistrate, whom thou ought to obey even for conscience sake; thou
do scandalize, first, thy weak brethren being affected as thy self, who by
thine example, for which thou perhaps think thou have good ground, are
animated, or, as the Apostle 1. Cor. 8. 10.
speaks, edified, without ground, to contemn In this scandal they are
deepest, who are of greatest note.
the authority of the Magistrate, and of the Church; and from that contempt do
many of them proceed to mislike of the State; and from mislike, either to
separation, or to some degree of disloyal coffeehouse. Besides those of
thine own disposition, thou do offend them who are more loyally affected;
who, if they be not the better grounded in our Jud. 20.
most holy faith, do stumble at your practice, and begin to stagger in the
profession and practice of religion, when they see me seeming most zealous in
our religion, and professing, (as they pretend) the cause of sincerity, upon
no just cause to abandon their ministry, to oppose themselves against
authority, to maintain a faction in the Church, and wilfully (for any thing
that they can see) to persist in a bad course. And hereupon many take occasion
to rest in outward civility, without grace, and to mislike all forwardnes in
religion for your sakes, etc.

Now here seems to be (...), a scandal falling two ways; indeed a single
supposed offense, opposed to a double scandal, joined with disobedience. If no
more could be said, who would doubt on which side rather to incline? But to
these Iadde other respects, that ought to be regarded more the^ a supposed
scandal. The question is not, as many would seem to understand it, whether,
it being a thing arbitrarie, and merely left unto our own choice, either to
use these ceremonies, or to forbear them, (as it was in the Apostles question
of eating flesh) whether (I say) we ought to abstain, if we understood that a
brother would be offended at the use of them, or not: for then there were no
question, but that for avoiding of scandal, we ought to abstain. But these
things are not arbitrarie, or in our choice; but imposed by lawful authority,
and that with such conditions, as that the observation of these things being
indifferent in themselves, becomes respectively necessary. First in respect
of authority, which not only for fear, but also for conscience Romans 13. 5.
sake, we are bound to obey in all lawful things. This one necessity of
obedience is sufficient to excuse me from scandal, especially if I do my
endeavor to prevent it, as after shall be showed. Secondly, in respect of the
conditions wherewith they are imposed; as, not to receive the Communion unless
we kneel; not to go on in our ministry, unless we conform. For, care of
avoiding scandal respects arbitrarie matters, and not necessary duties
appertaining to Gods glory, and our salvation: which we must perform, though
all the world would be offended thereat. The care of thine own salvation must
be preferred to the supposed danger of another man's fall: the care of the
Churches salvation, much more: the glory of God, most of all. Well then,
may thou not receive the Communion, being a duty appertaining to thine own
salvation, to the edification of the Church, and communion of Saints, to the
glory of God, unless thou will receive it upon thy knees? (it being a gesture
not only lawful, but most convenient to be used in such a part of Gods
worship, as is performed with invocation J mean not only prayer, but also
thanksgiving, in regard whereof it is called the Eucharist.
on the name of God; especially seeing the gesture used at meals is not to be
urged, unless the Sacrament were with our meals, as at the first institution
with Christ's last supper, and in the primitive Church with their love feasts,
received; for the cause of the gesture being worthily taken away, the So the
cause of standing at the Passover ceassing, the gesture it self was altered
by the Church, and that alteration confirmed by the practice of Christ, (who
not withstanding perfectly fuifilled the Law.) Luke 22. 14.
reason of retaining it ceasseth; for which cause the Council of Laodicea,
cap. 28. Et Council. Constantinop. in Trullo. c. 74.
as it forbad loue-feasts in the Church: so also accubitus, the gesture used at
feasts.) I say unto thee confidently, if thou may not receive it, unless
thou do kneel; thou ought to receive it kneeling, though another would
be offended thereat.

May thou not preach the Word (to omit other parts of the ministerial
function, the necessity whereof should prevail with us more then a supposed
scandal, for it shall soffice to insist in this one particular) may thou
not, I say, preach the Gospel of Christ, being a duty whereof necessity is
imposed upon thee, and 1. Cor. 9. 16.
Woe be unto thee if thou preach not the Gospel; a duty whereby thou art
bound in especial manner to edify the Church, and to glorify God; unless
thou yield to the use of such things, as are neither in themselves unlawful (I
mean the Surplice and the Cross, whereof the one in the judgment of the
Church serves for decency, and the other rightly understood tends to
edification), neither as they are used in our Church, being neither imposed nor
observed with superstition, or opinion of necessity in themselves, or of
worship, as though we placed religion in them, and much less with the other
popish conceits of merit, with which they observe all their traditions, or
efficacy, which they ascribe especially to the Cross? Thou ought to
prefer the glory of God in the salvation of his people by thy ministry,
before the supposed, and perhaps but pretended scandal of others.

Object. Yea but Romans 3. 8.
we may not do evil, that good may come of it.

Answ. The question is of things indifferent. For though we may and must obey
Magistrates, though they be evil; yet we must obey neither good nor bad unto
evil. For we must obey, only, in the Ephesians. 5. 25.
Lord.

Object. But though the things be indifferent in themselves, yet their use may
be unlawful.

Answ. That is, when they be imposed either with opinion of necessity in
themselves, of religion to be placed in them, of perfection or merit to be
attained by them, (all which conceits our Church detesteth, as is manifest by
the doctrine, whereby ceremonies are to be weighed:) or with scandal (I do not
say taken, but) given to others

Object. Yea but it is evil to offend my weak brother, that evil I may not
do, that good may come of it.

I answer, in not yielding to conformity, thou both disobeyest the
Magistrate, and offendest thy weak brother too. So that when thou seem
loath to do that which is lawful and good, for fear of an imagined evil;
thou addest evil to evil, that is, to disobedience, scandal; and besides, to
the most necessary duties of Gods worship, preferrest the avoiding of a
supposed scandal.

For all this while I speak but by supposition. For here is a supposall of
Antinomie or opposition of the two laws of loyalty and charity, as though
the one could not be observed without the breach of the other; which is not so.
For where the Magistrate enioyneth the use of an indifferent thing, whereat it
is feared some will take offense; his duty is, for preventing the scandal, to
give some time of information; that the weak may be instructed, as touching
the indifferency of the thing, and the sufficiency of his authority to
command it, and of their duty in submitting themselves to the observation
thereof. It is also the duty of the Minister, to endeavor to prevent the
scandal, by informing his hearers, that those things which God has neither
commanded nor forbidden, are things indifferent; that no such thing is unclean
in it self; that all such things are lawful, and such as whereunto Christian
liberty does extend; that in all lawful things the Magistrate is to be
obeyed; and therefore that these things being enjoined, they not only may, in
respect of their Christian liberty, with free conscience use them; but also
must, in respect of Gods Commandment requiring obedience, yield to the
observation of them. Which course having been taken (as it has among us) if
any will still be offended, it is peeuishnes and obstinacy, rather then
weakness; and an offense taken, but not given: in which case, the law of
charity it self does not bind us: and that, in two respects, not yet
mentioned. The one, in respect of God; the other, in respect of his truth. For,
I may not offend God, not to offend my brother. And it is Gods truth, that
Christian liberty priuiledgeth both Christian Lawgiuers (with such cautions as
before have bin mentioned) to ordain such laws concerning outward things, as
they shall judge expedient: and also the subjects, without scrupulositie of
conscience to observe them. Now, it is a principle, Satius est nasci scandalum
quam deseri verum: It is better a scandal should arise, then the truth to be
forsaken or betrayed. Is our Christian liberty in this point called into
question, whether Magistrates may command such things, and whether subjects may
obey? we must maintain our liberty, though others would be offended thereat.
The Apostles, though for a time they yielded much to the weakness of the
Jews, doing and forbearing many things, to avoid their offense; yet when their
liberty Galath. 2. 3. 4
was called into question, they resolutely maintained it, not regarding their
offense. And when as by Peter's withdrawing himself from the Gentiles, for
fear of offending the Jews, the liberty of Christians was called into
question; Galath. 2. 11. 12. 13. 14.
Paul withstood him to his face, and reproved him before them all, as halting
in the profession of the Gospel. And so must they be content to be used, who
follow Peter's example in this behalf. Thus much by the way to persuade the
people to obedience and loyalty, and the Ministers to conformity; which I
beseech God to effect for his Christ's sake.

These things thus premised concerning the nature. 23. Objections concerning
Christian liberty in outward things answered.
and quality of this peculiar liberty of Christians; it will not be hard to
answer the objections of those, who run into contrary extremes concerning
the same.

Object. 1. For first, on the one side, it is objected; that seeing Christ has
set us free concerning things indifferent, no man ought to restrain us; and
therefore the laws commanding or forbidding the use of indifferent things, are
against Christian liberty.

Whereunto I answer, first: that Christian liberty is wholly spiritual,
being a liberty of the conscience and inner man, which may stand with the
outward servitude of 2. Cor. 7. 22.
bondslaues, much more with the subjection and obedience of free subjects. For
though the outward use of the liberty be moderated by the Magistrate, and
confined; yet the inward liberty of the conscience is not impaired, so long as
the subject may obey with free conscience before God; that is, so long as the
Magistrate seeks not to bind the conscience, and to impose things not
commanded of God as necessary in themselves, and as matters of religion before
God, etc.

Secondly, that the liberty of Christians is a true, and therefore not an
unbounded liberty. Now, one of the bounds and limits which God has set it,
is, as you have heard, the law of loyalty, requiring obedience to superiors.
Wherefore a Christian man, though in respect of the inward man he be free, as
being the son of God by adoption in Christ; yet in respect of the outward
man, he ought to be a servant, not only to his 1. Pet. 2. 13. 16
superiors, in loyalty and obedience; but also to Galath. 5. 13. 1. Cor. 9.
19. etc.
all, in benevolence and charity.

Object. 2 On the other side, it is objected. 1. That for conscience Romans 13. 5.
sake we are to obey the Magistrate; that is, that we are bound in conscience
so to do; therefore the laws and commandments of the Magistrate do bind the
conscience.

Answ. It follows not, for although we are bound in conscience, to obey the
lawful commandments and laws of superiors; yet that bond is not in the
particular laws of men, but in the general commandment of God.

Object. 3. Again: A thing indifferent enjoined by the Magistrate, becomes
necessary, Romans 13. 5.
for Paul says, (...), it is necessary that you be subject: therefore the
commandment of the Magistrate does bind the conscience.

Answ. Neither does this follow. For it becomes necessary, not by the
particular commandment of man, but by the general commandment of God. For,
notwithstanding the commandment of the Magistrate, the thing commanded
remains indifferent in it self, and before God; and so to be used with free
conscience, without placing any religion therein; howsoever it becomes
necessary so far forth as by the general commandment of God, I am bound
thereto. And this is that which Peter 1. Pet. 2. 16.
says, that we must obey Magistrates, as free, and yet as the servants of God.
Free, in respect of our consciences exempted from humane power; and yet as
servants of God, bound in conscience to obey him in obeying them, so far
forth as he does command us to obey them.

The truth of these answers shall not only be demonstrated as it were before
your eyes by a fyllogisme, wherein is concluded the bond of conscience, and
necessity of duty in obeying the commandments of men, but also by other
reasons proved.

The Syllogism:
All lawful commandments of Magistrates thou art bound in conscience by the
law of God to obey, so far forth as he requires such commandments to be
obeyed: This or that particular is a lawful commandment of the Magistrate:
Therefore this or that particular thou art bound in conscience by the law of
God to obey, so far forth as God requires such commandments to be obeyed.
By which argumentation we may conceive, that the distinction of necessity
used in schools, viz. that there is necessitas consequentis, which is simple
or absolute, and necessitas consequentiae, which is not simple, but upon
condition of other things presupposed, may not unfitly be applied to the
necessity of duty imposed by the laws, either of God, or man. For Gods
commandment imposes the necessity as it were of the consequent, (without
presupposing other things) requiring simple and absolute obedience. The law of
man does not impose the necessity of the consequent, or require simple
obedience; but it imposes only a necessity of the consequence, that is, such
a necessity and no other, as may soundly be concluded from the law of God,
and so far forth as it may be concluded thence. Or to speak more plainly:
in a simple sentence without interposing any condition, or presupposing any
antecedent whereupon it is to be inferred, I may say, either particularly this
commandment of God is necessarily, or by necessity of duty to be obeyed; or
generally, all Gods commandments are necessarily to be observed. And this
speech is of necessary truth. But concerning men's commandments, if I shall
say in the general, All the commandments of men are necessarily to be
observed, the speech will be false and absurd: if in particular, this
commandment of the Magistrate is necessarily to be observed: this speech
cannot be necessary simply, or by the necessity of the consequent, or (to
speak more plainly for the explicating of that phrase) by the necessity of a
simple sentence, wherein the consequent (or predicat) is both simply and
necessarily affirmed of the antecedent or subject; it cannot, I say, be simply
necessary, because (as you heard) the general is false. Notwithstanding if
you presuppose these two things: first, that all lawful commandments of
Magistrates are by the commandment of God necessarily to be observed, so
far forth as he commands them to be observed: secondly, that this
particular is a lawful commandment of the Magistrate; upon these premises
you may prove that speech to be true by necessity of consequence, viz. that
this particular commandment of the Magistrate is necessarily to be observed,
etc.

But some sophister will object, that I might as well conclude thus;

Propos. All lawful commandments of the Magistrate must necessarily be
obeyed:

Ass. This or that particular is a lawful commandment of the Magistrate:

Concl. Therefore necessarily to be obeyed.

I answer, that the proposition of this syllogism needs proof, as not
being manifest of it self. You will say, it may thus be proved.

Propos. What is commanded of God, must necessarily be performed.

Ass. Obedience to all lawful commandments of Magistrates is commanded of
God.

Concl. Therefore obedience to all lawful commandments of Magistrates, is
necessarily to be performed.

But I say again the assumption of this syllogism needs some explanation.
For the Lord would have difference put between his own commandments and the
laws of men; and therefore we may not think, that he commands all laws of
men simply to be obeyed: not simply, you must say then, but so far forth as
he requires them to be obeyed.

By which short discourse we learn, that those additions by which I explaned
the proposition of the syllogism, were necessary; and that the bond of
conscience is not the law of man, but of God: that we are bound to obey man's
laws not simply, but so far forth as God requires. And lastly that this
speech, (All lawful commandments of Magistrates are necessarily to be
obeyed) is true, not by the necessity of the consequent, as an axiom or
principle which is manifest of it self; but by the necessity of consequence,
as a conclusion manifested by discourse.

Now that the laws of men do not bind the conscience, it may further appear
by these reasons. First, because our freedom from the laws judicial and
ceremonial, which in the Scriptures is extolled for so great a benefit, would
be a burden rather then a benefit, if we should in like manner be bound to
the ecclesiastical and civil laws of men. Again, if they did bind the
conscience, there would be no difference between Gods laws and man's laws (in
respect of outward actions) and the one sort would require simple obedience as
well as the other, yea unlawful commandments would also bind the
conscience. But it is plain, that simple obedience is to be performed only
to the laws of God. To the laws of men we are bound, not simply, but so far
forth as in obeying them, we also obey God, and no further; that is, as I said,
so far as God commands us to obey them. Now, how far forth God
commands us to obey the laws of men, will easily appear by this
distinction; for either they command such things as God forbids, and forbid
such things as he commands, (which kind of commandments are so far from
binding our consciences, as that we are bound by the law of God to obey him in
disobeying them:) or they command such things as God commands, and forbid
such things as he forbids, that by their authority the laws of God may the
better be observed, (to which kind of commandments we are simply bound,
because as in obeying them we obey God, so in breaking them we transgress the
law of God:) or lastly, they command such things as God has not forbidden,
and forbid such things as God has not commanded: to the particular
commandments of this kind we are not simply bound, but so far forth as God
has commanded us to obey them; that is, as 1. Pet. 2. 16.
free (being not simply bound to those particulars, as necessary in
themselves, but using them with free conscience, as being indifferent, and
therefore such, as whereunto our Christian liberty extends,) and yet as
servants of God, thinking our selves so far bound to observe them, as in
necessary for avoiding of Scandal and contempt, which God by his law has
forbidden. Contempt: for it is necessary, says the Apostle, Romans 13. 5. 1.
Pet. 2. 13. 16.
that we should submit our selves to lawful authority, not only for fear of
punishment, but for conscience sake. For although we be free, as concerning
the inner man; yet in respect of the outward man, we must, as the servants of
God, submit our selves to such superiors, as God has set over us, and not
have our liberty, as a cloak of naughtiness. Scandal also is to be avoided.
First, in respect of the superior, that by our disobedience we do not
scandalize or offend him. Wherein our Savior has given us a notable example,
who, although he were (as he Matthew. 17. 25. 26. 27.
says) free; yet was content to pay tribute money, for avoiding of offense.
Secondly, in respect of the subject; that he stumble not at the example of our
disobedience, being animated thereby to do the like. For whereas some think,
that we are not to obey the Magistrates commandment concerning a thing
indifferent, if we imagine that some weak brother will be offended thereat;
they greatly mistake the rule of Divines, who say these commandments are to
be obeyed for avoiding scandal, and not, that they are to be disobeyed for
avoiding of scandal. For if this were a sufficient reason to excuse our
disobedience, we should not need to obey almost any commandment of this kind,
there being scarce any commandment concerning things indifferent, wherewith
we may not imagine some weak and scrupulous conscience will be offended. But
we must think our selves more bound, for avoiding of contempt and scandal,
to obey a lawful commandment, then to disobey, for avoiding a supposed
offense. That which we are to do in this case, is this: If we fear any will
take offense, we must labor to prevent it, by informing the party, as before
has been said. And having so done, we must do our own duty (whether he will
be offended or not) in obeying the lawful commandment of the Magistrate, so
far as it shall be necessary for avoiding of scandal and contempt.

Hitherto I have entreated of the liberty of. 24. The liberty of Glory.
grace, both that which is common to the faithful in all ages; and also that
which is peculiar to Christians under the Gospel. There remains (in a word
to be spoken of) the liberty of glory; which is not only a perfect
deliverance from sin, misery, and al imperfectio^s, (whereunto because we are
subject Romans 7. 24.
in this life, for here is as, Augustine says, inchoata, non perfect a
libertas, we ought to aspire toward this perfection) but also a fruition of
happiness and all the privileges of the citizens of heaven.

This liberty is either of the soul alone, as at our death; when we may
freely and with comfort resign our souls into the hands of God, that he may
commit the same to the Luke 16. 22.

the world, comfortablie to expect our full redemption. Or it is of the body

are but Eccles. 1. 2.
vanities) be allured and ensnared, or by the terrors thereof, (which are not

worthy the glory that shall be revealed), drawn into bondage.

Thus have you heard the doctrine of Christian liberty. Now hear the use.

For seeing this liberty is a benefit of so great excellency. 25. The
application or use.
in it self, and of such profit and necessity to us: Our first duty is, to
try and examine our selves by that which has been said, whether we have as
yet obtained this liberty, or not. If not, (as John 8. 34.
he which commits sin, is the servant of sin) we must labor to
acknowledge and feel that miserable servitude, wherein we are, under sin and
Satan (for he that is not free, and yet feels not his bondage, is drowned in
sin, even as he that is over head and ears in the water, feels no weight
thereof) that in the sense of our misery, we may not only truly and
earnestly desire; but also carefully use all means to attain this liberty,
and never be at rest, until we have obtained it. It is strange to see what
hard services men will undergo, and what great sums they will forgo, to get
an earthly freedom; whiles this spiritual freedom, which is worth many
worlds, will scarcely be accepted, when men are called and invited unto it.
Which shows, that men naturally, are not only servants, but willingly and
wilfully continue in servitude. But you will say, what means are we to use? I
answer, 1. Diligently and conscionablie to hear the Word, as being the
means, which God has ordained to call you to liberty. 2. To ask, seek,
knock by earnest and hearty prayer unto God the author of this liberty, that
he would give you the spirit of liberty. 3. To turn unto God unfeignedly,
laying hold upon Christ by faith, and repenting of your sins. Eris liber, says
Augustine August. in Joan. tract. 41.
, si fueris seruus, liber peccati, seruus iustitiae: You shall be free from sin,
if you will become the servants of righteousness. If God has already called us
unto this liberty, our duty is twofold, both which the Apostle mentions,
Galath. 5. the one, Galath. 5. 1.
that we stand fast in this liberty, wherewith Christ Jesus has made us free,
and not suffer our selves to be entangled again with the yoke of bondage. And
the rather we must be careful to stand fast in this liberty, because it is
mightily assaulted by all the enemies of our salvation, the flesh, the world,
the devil. Now, we are to stand steadfast, both in the doctrine of Christian
liberty, which is the doctrine of the Gospel, and not suffer our selves to
be allured, or intoxicated, either with the golden Apoc. 17. 4. 18. 3.
cup of the Babylonian strumpet, the church of Rome, which does not only
bereave men of Christian liberty, but also draw them into Antichristian
bondage: or with the Cyrcean cup of the Libertines, which transformeth
Christianisme into Epicurisme, and the liberty of the spirit into the liberty
of the flesh. And we are also to be steadfast and resolute in the practice of
Christian liberty: as of vocation, not to be entangled again with the
servitude of sin and Satan, (for, if having professed our selves freed thereof,
we be again entangled therein, our latter end, as S. Peter says 2. Pet. 2.
20. 21.
, will be worse then our beginning). Of justification, as not to subject our
selves to the laws exaction of inherent and perfect righteousness to
justification, (for they which are Galath. 3. 10.
of the works of the law, are under the curse) but without regard of our own
righteousness, to rely wholly for our justification on the mercies of God,
and merits of Christ apprehended by faith; and to hold him Galath. 1. 8.
accursed, though he were an Angel from heaven, that should teach otherwise.
Of sanctification, as not to subject our selves to the dominion Romans 6. 12.
of sin, or to the terror or rigor of the law; but without servile fear,
willingly and cheerfully to serve our heavenly Father, being well assured that
he will cover our wants, and accept of our imperfect endeavors. Of Christian
liberty in respect of outward things; as not to suffer our consciences to be
bound by the authority of any creature, inioyning them as necessary in
themselves, and much less to bind our own consciences, as scrupulously and
superstitiously putting religion either in the use or forbearance of them. Of
the glorious liberty, as not to suffer our selves by all the machinatio^s of
ye world, the flesh, and the devil, to be withdrawn from the hope and
expectation of it; but comfortablie to live as men Romans 8. 24.
saved in hope.

The other duty, is that which the Apostle mentions, Galath. 5. 13.
Brethren, says he, Galath. 5. 13.
you are called to liberty: only use not your liberty as an occasion to the
flesh, but by charity serve one another. That is, that we should be careful,
both to avoid the abuse The abuse of Christiam liberty.
of Christian liberty, and also to use it aright. The abuse is manifold. As
first, of the saving grace of God; when men do turn Jud. 4.
it into wantonness, their freedom from sin, into a freedom to sin, as
though they were so freed from the law, as that they need not to obey it; as
though good works, because they are not exacted to justification, were in no
respect needful to salvation. We are not free, says Luther De libert. Christ.
, by faith in Christ from works, but from the opinion of works, that is, from
the foolish presumption of justification sought by works. Secondly, of
Christian liberty, in respect of the creatures of God, and the use of things
indifferent; when we do use them without regard of our duty, to God, our
neighbor, or our selves.

The duty which we owe to God, is piety; to our neighbor in general,
charity; and in particular to our superior, obedience and loyalty; to our
selves, sobriety. For these, as I said, are the bounds of our liberty, which
if we pass in the use thereof, we abuse it. The use of our liberty is
contrary to piety. First, when we our selves are impious, and irreligious.
For though the things in themselves be clean, yet the use of them is unclean
to them that are impure. For as Titus 1. 15.
to the pure, all things are pure, so to the unclean nothing is clean.
Secondly, when the use of them is not sanctified unto us, 1. Tim. 4. 5.
either by the Word, as when we make more indifferent things, then God in his
word has made, as drunkenness, fornication, usury, etc. or when we do not
use them in faith and sound persuasion out of the word of God, which is the
charter of our liberty, that we may lawfully and with a good conscience use
them (for though nothing in it self be unclean, yet to him Romans 14. 14. 23
that thinks or doubts that it is unclean, it is so to him; for as the
Apostle, speaking of this particular, says, Whatsoever is not of faith, is
sin:) or by the duties of invocation. As the use of meat and drink, without
either prayer to God for his blessing in the use, or thanksgiving for the same.
Thirdly, we abuse our liberty irreligiously, when we use it to the dishonor of
God, or to the hinderance of his worship and service, as in the immoderate and
unseasonable use of recreations, etc. whereby men show themselves to be (...).
2. Tim. 3. 4.
lovers of pleasures more then of God.

Likewise our use of the creatures, and of things indifferent, is against
charity, when we use them without due regard of avoiding scandal and
offense. Against loyalty, when using our liberty with contempt of lawful
authority, we make it a cloak to cover some naughtiness. And lastly,
against sobriety, when under pretense of Christian liberty, the creatures of
God, and other things indifferent, are used, either as instruments to serve, or
as ensigns to display, our pride or intemperate lusts, as in the excess of
meat and drink, recreations, the use of the marriage bed, apparel, buildings
and such like.

But let us come to the right use of our Christian. 26. The right use of
Christian liberty.
liberty; which is twofold, either the sanctification of our lives, or the
pacification of our consciences. As touching the former: the right use of the
liberty of saving grace is, when it is used to the free, voluntary, and
cheerful worship and service of God, in holiness and righteousness, for
Luke 1. 74. 75.
that is the end of our liberty and redemption. The right use of Christian
liberty in outward things, is, when it is used to a free and cheerful
serving, both one of Galath. 5. 13.
another in charity, and of the superior in obedience and loyalty; that
being free 1. Cor. 9. 19.
from all, we make our selves servants unto al, for their good. For as Luther
says, De libert. Christ.
A Christian in respect of the inner man, is free, but in respect of the
outward man he is (through charity) the servant of all. And herein we are to
imitate the example of Christ; who, Philip. 2. 5. 6.
though he were God, took upon him the form of a servant, to make us free;
and though he were the Lord of all, Mat. 20. 28.
came not to be ministered unto, but to minister. And likewise of the blessed
Angels; who, though they be glorious spirits, notwithstanding take no scorn to
be sent forth into the Hebr. 1. 14.
ministry and service for our good.

The right use of the doctrine concerning the liberty of glory, is, truly to
believe it, and to live as in expectation of it; knowing, that he which has
this 1. John. 3. 3.
hope, that he shall be like unto Christ at his appearance, will purify
himself, as he is pure; that as he hopes to be like him, in respect of the
liberty of glory, so he may in some measure resemble his gratiousnes, by the
liberty of grace.

But the chief use of this doctrine, is, to pacify men's consciences; without
which (unless they sleep in carnal security) they are so wonderfully
perplexed, that neither can they live in peace, nor attempt any thing almost
with quiet minds. For whereas there be four things which trouble perplexed
consciences, this doctrine is a sovereign remedy to clear and to appease the
conscience, in respect of them all. The first, is the guilt of sin, and fear
of damnation. For when they conscience is summoned before the judgment seat of
God, or terrified with the apprehension of his wrath, as in time of temptation,
or affliction, or in the hour of death; when thou do consider the severity
of Gods justice, who will not suffer sin to go unpunished, the rigor of the
law, denouncing the curse of God against every even the least transgression,
the testimony of thine own conscience, which is in stead of a thousand
witnesses, accusing and condemning thee of innumerable transgressions; how
can thou think of appearing before God, who is greater then thy conscience,
to be justified or condemned, without horror of conscience, and confusion of
mind? But blessed be God, who has granted us this liberty of grace, that in
the question of justification, whereby in this life we are freed from of
damnation, and entitled unto the kingdom of heaven, we need not look into
our own obedience, or to the sentence of the law; but may be assured, if we
believe in Christ, that God does justify us, being sinners in our selves,
without respect of our works; that he has freed us from the laws exaction of
inherent righteousness, to the acceptance of our persons; that he imputing the
righteousness of Christ to the believer, accepts of him as righteous in
Christ; that the faithful man has liberty to appeal from the tribunal of
justice, to the throne of grace, from the sentence of the law, to the promise
of the Gospel, and renouncing his own righteousness, yea esteeming it as dung
in the question of justification, to rest alone in the mercies of God, and
merits of Christ.

But because the world is so apt to abuse this most comfortable doctrine, and
to turn this gracious liberty into carnal licentiousnes; it shall be
needful to add this caution: That howsoever we are by our justification in
this life, entitled unto the kingdom of heaven; and although by the
righteousness and merits of Christ alone apprehended by faith, we are both
justified and also saved: yet for as much as many deceive themselves with an
idle conceit of faith, and with a vain presumption that they are justified,
when notwithstanding Prou. 30. 12.
they remain in their sins; therefore we must think it most necessary,
being once justified by faith, and entitled unto the kingdom of heaven, to
demo^strate our faith, and our justification by a godly life; walking in that
way of good works, which God has Ephesians. 2. 10.
prepared for us to walk in toward our country in heaven. For though we are
justified and saved by the merits of Christ alone apprehended by faith;
notwithstanding sanctification is the Act. 20. 32.
cognizance of them that are saved, and good works are the evidence, according
Romans 2. 6.
unto which God will pronounce the sentence of salvation. For as the Luke 6. 44.
tree is known by his fruit; so he that 1. John 3. 7.
works righteousness, is righteous, and in like manner by sanctification our
justification is manifested. For true faith Galath. 5. 6.
works by love, and good works are as the breathing of a lively faith. And
therefore though faith alone does justify, as Paul Galath. 2. 16. Romans 3. 28.
teaches, because it alone does apprehend the righteousness of Christ unto
justification; yet as S. James Jam. 2. 14. etc.
teaches, that faith which is alone feuered from obedience does not justify,
neither alone, nor at all, because it is not a true faith. For even as the
body without breathing is known to be dead: Jam. 2. 26.
so faith without works is dead. We are therefore justified in this life, and
entitled unto the kingdom of heaven, as to our inheritance, by faith without
Romans 4. 6.
works; but none are actually saved, nor inherit that kingdom in the life to
come, but such as first are sanctified. For as our Savior says, we have
indeed not only remission of sins by faith, but also by faith we have our
inheritance; but yet, as he says, Act. 26. 18.
among them that are sanctified.

The second is the conscience of our manifold wants and imperfections, in those
duties which we do perform. For how can a man be persuaded, that God, to Job
15. 14. 15. 16.
whom no creature being compared is pure, will allow of his imperfect and
stained obedience. And if he be not persuaded, that his service is acceptable
unto God; with what heart can he perform it? The doctrine therefore of
Christian liberty assures our consciences, that we are freed from the laws
exaction of perfect obedience, to the acceptance of our actions: that God
covering our imperfections, as an indulgent Father, with the perfect
righteousness and obedience of Christ, imputes not our wants unto us, but
accepts of the truth of our will and desire for the deed, and our sincere
endeavor for the perfect performance. And therefore a Christian may, in respect
of this liberty, with comfort and cheerefulnes perform obedience, according
to the measure of grace received, being assured that our defective and stained
obedience, will be accepted of God through the mediation and intercession of
Jesus Christ.

The third is the scruple of conscience, concerning the use of outward things,
how far forth they may be used or forborne. For if a man be not rightly
informed herein, there will be no end Vide Calu. Instit. lib. 3. cap. 19.. 7.
of scrupulositie and superstition. From this scruple also, the doctrine of
Christian liberty does free us: assuring us, that to all these things our
liberty does extend, either to use them freely, or freely to forbear the^;
and that nothing is unclean in it self, nor yet unto us, if we be so
persuaded; and that to the clean, all things are clean. Provided always,
that the use of this liberty be kept within the bounds before mentioned, of
piety, charity, loyalty, and sobriety.

The fourth and last is the horror of conscience in the hour of death. For how
can a man with comfort give up his soul to be severed from the body, when he
knows not, either what will become of his soul after the separation thereof
from the body, or how, and in what case his body shall rise again? But this
doctrine does assure us, that Christ has purchased, not only a liberty of
grace in this life, but also of glory for our souls against the end of our
life, and for our bodies also, against the day of judgment. So that we Heb.
10. 19. 20
have liberty or boldness, to enter into the holy places by the blood of Jesus,
by the new and living way, which he has prepared for us through the veil,
that is to say, his flesh; being assured, that by reason of our union with
Christ, we are risen Ephesians. 2. 6.
again with Christ, and with him set in the heavenly places, whither he is
ascended John 14. 2. 3. and 17. 24. Philip. 3. 20. 21
to prepare a place for us: and from whence he will come again to bring us
thither, that where he is, there we may be also. Wherefore in respect of this
liberty, the faithful may with comfort, both surrender our souls into the
hands of God our merciful Father, and also bequeath our bodies to the earth,
in full assurance that our souls shall by the Angels be translated into
heaven, and that our bodies shall at the day of judgment, be freed from the
servitude of corruption, and rise again to glory: this mortal having put on
immortality, and this corruptible incorruption, that it being again reunited
to the soul, we may for ever and ever, enjoy both in body and soul, the
glorious liberty of the citizens of heaven. Unto which liberty of glory he
bring us, who has so dearly purchased it for us, even Christ Jesus the
righteous; to whom with the Father and the holy Ghost, be eternal praise and
glory, Amen.
