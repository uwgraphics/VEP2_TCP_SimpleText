From Prague the 26. hereof.
The Nobles of Silesia have paid all there Soldiers and casshierd them / but
most of them are entertained again of the Marckgrave of Iagersoory / who has
invaded Neus / and other Bisshoply towns / as also the Earleship Glats / and
presently after he marched into Bohemia with 10000. Men / unto whom 4000
Countrymen have joined them selves in the Shire Coningreyts / and at this
present are in the Dominions of the Smirsisky / they have surprised some
certain little towns already / as Reysenberghe / Costelits and others /
wherefore the Governor van Sassen has Commission to meet the said Marckgrave
/ with his 7. Companies of Horsemen / and the Soldiers of Walsteyne / to
encounter with him. Whose Folk do pilladge every where / and flaye al they
can lay hands on / wherefore here is great fear that Mansvelt will join him
with the said Iagersdorp.

The Governor Frenck is let into Tabor / because he has highly bound himself
to stand it out to the last man. Don Balthazar brings little to pass / but he
has lost 400. of his Men before Tabor.

Here is great sadness by many / conterning the Execution last / and 6. of the
Executed Men's Wife are disceased for grief of the loss of their Husbands.

narrowly eschapped from being taken prisoners of the Hungarians / for 18.
Chief persons were taken pr^foners / and those af Nieuheusel do ours great
hurt.

From the Hague the 5 of July.
In the Hague is arrived a Gentleman from the Kings Camp before St. Iean
d'Angely in France / he has obtained audience the 4. hereof with the
ordinary French Ambassador in the Hague / by the High and Mighty States /
and as it is for certain reported he has sought for 4000. Soldiers and
certain Ships of war to go against the Protestants in France / which did
seem very strange to the States General / it is thought that he will not
obtain any thing.

The third hereof the said States have given the Polish Ambassador his full
expedition / and it is thought he has obtained nothing, upon al his
propositions.

We hear from Brabant / that Spinola makes him ready to mnster his soldiers /
and to march into the Fields / the said Spinola has received 3. Millions of
Gold and Jewels brought upon Asses from Spain / to pay his Folk with all /
wherefore the Spaniards have received two Months wages / and the other as
yet have nothing. It seems Don Louys de Valasco, is set of from his
Generallship over Chavillrie, and the Earl Hendrick vanden Berghe is set in
his place / whereupon he is gone to Spain. It is thought that Spinola has
wronght him this deed.
