Corrant out of Italy, Germany, etc.
From Venice, the 27. of November, 1620.
LEtters from Room are not yet com / because of great storms and high waters.

At Genua are exspected 2000 soldiers / the which should be sent to the River
Ponente: because it is understoode that the Duke of Savoy does Arm himself
again / by the which are 3000 Frenche-men com from Daulphine.

We here from Milanen / that there is lodging made for many 1000. soldiers:
And the two Rivers Bormio and Canaro were risen up so high / that they have
not only carried away the Lands and Trees / but also many 100 houses / People /
Cattle / with other goods / and done great harms.

From Lublin in Polen, the 26 of November.
This day is a Post arived here from the Lomberg / brings certain news /
that the Polish Camp is overthrowen / and dispearced and the great Chancellor
/ with many Chief Officers / and other People are taken prisoners / and the
Lord Farcns-Beck / and others / are slain in the Battle. The Carters are com
under Lomberg in 4 Companies / set on fire / and spoil all with in a mile
round about: begin to pich a Camp 3. Miles from the Lombarg / those 60.
Waggens with Women and Children (there under were Chief persons of the
Gentelitie) which would have took their flight this ways are taken prisoners
/ and carried away. A Chief Tarter / which is taken prisoner / has revealed
that they had comision of the Turk / to pitch a Ca^p by Lo^barg / and there to
exspect the coming of the Turk / which has concluded to take his way toward
Crakow / and there to hold his Winter-Camp. In the mean while resort together
again about 20000 Cosacks / and many Gentlemen here about / but they will not
go forwards except that the King of Polen in his own person does go with
them.

From Leypsich, the 30. of November.
The Duke Elector of Saxens Soldiers have taken in again 2. places in
Nether-Lausnits / and gotten great spoil / the which those of Bohemia had
brought thither / to fly away / it is said / that they will also set upon the
City Gorlits.

At Prage has the Duke of Beyeren / before his departure / taken an inventarie
of all things / also Copied the Letters in the Secretary / sealed them to /
and sent them the Emperor to Weenen / had also given command / that the
Citizens should not be ronged: In the mean while dorst no man in Prage give
advise.

Letters out of Breslaw mention / that the King and Queen / with 2. Dukes of
Weymar / Earl of Slick / Hollac / Solms / and other Lords / were arived there
/ with 300 Waggens with bagage / also there followed him 18. Cornets of
Horsemen / and very many footmen / so that the speech goes that the cause
should be taken in hand again. In the mean while run the Posts toe and fro
/ to take advise of other Kings and Potentates.

From Elboghen in Bohemia, the 1. of December.
Although Treachery / ill Gouvernment of the Soldiers / also that the
Bohemians have not assisted the King of Bohemia with on accord / and more other
matters / are judged to be the movall causes of the loss of Praghe / with the
appendixes: yet is the chief causuall cause accounted to be an Indignation of
God over the pertickuler rulers thereof / for sin / for now those Lords and
Gentility / which formerly in high degree did use great Tyranny over their
subjects the same are now despised of them / for in the Cities they are not
suffered / neither dare they com by their Subjects / of whom they are slain.

And in the Satser Craits are gathered together some certain 1000. of Contrymen
more / they think to defend themselves by force / if they had but a Gouvernour:
and that the King / who having the chief Priveledges and Iuwels with him /
gathering his forces again very strongly / has advertised them that hence
forth they should be free: therefore will they assemble many 1000. unto them.

And although some Counties in Bohemia have given themselves under the Emperors
Comisioner van Walsteen / some being constrained there unto by force / others
through thretenning: as some few days agone are arived here the Emperors
Comisioners / and have propounded / that this City and County should com to
the City Laun / and give themselves under subjection / if not / they would
persecute us with fire and sword: but they have gotten but a slight answer. We
hope to defend our selves better then the other Bohemish Counties have done.

In the mean while is Taus / Mies / Tacha / and other Cities / strongly beset
with the Emperors or Beyers Garisson. The said Comisioners have enterprised to
establish Mas-priests in certain places / thereupon the Subjects are very
disquieted / and grieved / therefore the Garissons are in great danger. The
Governor of Taus has persuaded the Lord of Illa (who is Evangelist) from such
a Reformation / exorting him not to Reform the foresaid Comision of the
Emperor / but to punnish the disobediente calling to mind the issue of the
like former Compulsions. The wars will first rightly begin against the
Spring: And there might arise a general tumult / for there has been an uproer
in the oulde City of Prage against the Sedition of the Soldiers / what the
issue will be / time can reveal.

From VVeenen, the 28. of November.
Concerning the victorious houlding of the field by Praghe / and the obtaining
of the same (as is confirmed by Sundry Posts) is held a stately Profession /
by the which the Emperor himself was present: the Cardinale of Diederichsten
made a Sermon of thankes-giving / after the which all the ornance upon the
Walls weere shot af 3 several times / in like manner discharged all the
Muskets.

The Moravians which weere guarnished in these Lands / do fly from the same
/ and do daily more / and more / retire toward their own Country with
speed / having burnt the Fortress called Diricks-Church / leaving afterward
Wolckers dorf / and Greytsen-townes / both Cities and Castle: except one
Moravish Guarnisson which lie in the Castle of Greytsenstone / the which are
well provided with Wine Meal / and other provision / but our men have environed
the same / intending to scale the same.

The Earl of Thurne is in Moravia / assembleth many men / and it seems that
he will take his course toward Bohemia / with many thou sands of Turks / with
the which (and other more as it is thought) he will take in hand some
enterprise. Bethlem Gabor is removed from Presburgh / to Thirna / taking with
him a great sum of Money.

The Emperors guarde / and the like appertayning unto him / are commanded to
keep themselves in a readiness / it is deemed that the Emperor will in short
time remove from hence / but is unknowe whether: Some think toward Lints /
or Passow / other mean toward Prage / unto which place the Elector of Saxen
/ and the Duke of Beyeren would repair / what their intent is / is as yet
unknown.

The speech is / that Bethlem Gabor would come hitherwarde to Weenen with a
great Army / to which end the Emperor has sent for the Earl of Buequoy /
and most of his forces: in the mean time / the Moravians assemble their forces
together: also have the Gentry of Sleasia cited man / for man / to be in a
readiness.

From Heydelberg, the 6. of December.
The King of Bohemia is yet at Breslaw / where his Majesty / with the Princes
and Stands have sitten in Counsel many days: So that there will be a great
Army gathered again.

Also there are many thousand Hungarians assembled in Moravia / unto which
place the Disperced forces of Bohemia do repair very strongly / and many
pieces of Ornance are brought from Vlinits Zuam and Brin unto them. The speech
is / that the King will prepare two Armies: Employing the one in Bohemia / and
the other in high Austria and Beyer-land: in low Austria is great fear /
because the Moravians make great spoil / therefore they call op their people
man for man.

It is expected that there will be Treves made in this quarter / by means of
the Lord Electour of Ments / and the Land-grave / or Earl of Darmstadt.

The Bishop of Spiers does fortify the town Idenheym very strongly / so that
he has brou^ the same into a resonnable defense: and has ca^sed 17. pieces of
Ornance to be brought upon the new made work.

From Worms the 8. hereof.
Our Army is divided unto the places o^ their Winter abode: the Marquis
Spinola hat^ take the Castle of Cruytsnach for his abode / having by him the
most part of the Footmen: his Horsemen have their place at Hontsruck: Altze^
is inguarnished with 2000 foot / and some fe^ Horsemen: in which place / as also
at Oppenheyn^ his Men dye very sore.

The Marquis Spinola has advertised the Rulers of the Villadges round about /
that the^ should remember their duties / and help (as others do) to bear the
charge of War: if not / he would visit them by force: His Soldiers
imboulden themselves to go upon frie-bute eve^ unto Worms / take the Carriers
their Horses out of the carts: It is also thought that Spinola^ should have had
an assault upon Franckendale / and Deutesheym / the which perhaps might fail.

Last Saturday have the United Princes houlden Counsel at Manheym: unto which
place diverse Carpendors are assembled / waiting for their employment / which
as yet is unknown: In the mean time there is great harm done in the
Bergstraten / 50. Spanish Horsemen plondered a Village by Darmestat / and
carried some of the Vnited-Princes-men captive unto Oppenheym: the which the
Horsemen of the Marcgrave do seek to revenge / who are ridden out very
strongly.

From Ceulen the 12 December.
Letters from Praghe mention / that the Citizens there are commanded to bring
their Weapons upon the Towne-house / and there to give op their names: The
houses of some that are fled and others / are confiscated / and made prise of.
In thee mean time dearth does increase / the while there is no Provision at
hand / and through the great danger can none be brought unto them: so that the
Citizens are in a very sober case.

It is said that the Earl of Mansvelt has not (as yet) given op the City
Pilsen: but that they are in parle with him about the same.

Tidings is / that Prince Henry Frerick of Nassaw is retiring homewards unto
the low Countries / having (with his Horsemen) passed the Land of Hessen / and
the Bishopdom of Paterborn: being at present in the Stift of Munster.

Imprinted at Amsterdam by George Veseler, Ao. 1620. The 23 of December.

And are to be soulde by Petrus Keerius, dwelling in the Calverstreete, in the
uncertain time.
