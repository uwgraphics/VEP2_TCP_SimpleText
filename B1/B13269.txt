AN ACT OF THE RELIEF GRAVNTED TO THE KINGS MAJESTY by the Lords and
commons.
WHylest we the kings majesty's faithful loving and obedient subjects, the
lords and commons assembled in this present parliament do consider the present
state of the world, what great troubles be in all places, what enemies both
his majesty and this his realm has and is like to have, and that their
malice and hatred is bent, partly to dyminishe his graces majesty and the
honor of this his Realm, partly to spoil the same of the just, true, and
ancient enheritaunce, right, and title, that his highness and his most noble
progenitors kings of this Realm of England have always had to the Realm of
Scotland, being a member and part of his kingdom and dominion: and chieflye
for that we of late having abandoned the authority of the Bishop of Rome and
his wicked doctrine, have and do adhere to Christ and his most holy word, as
becomes all christians to do, that mean to be no less in deed, then they
profess in name: Whylest we also consider, that his grace, and we his faithful
and obedient subjects be but one body politic, his highness the head and we
the members, and that no good or felicity can come to the one, but the other
shall be partaker thereof, and that no hurt or aduersytie can happen to the one
where with ye other shall not also be grevid: Whylest also we consider the
practyses and policies of other princes and potentates, what great
preparations, they make both of men and also of other furniture for the wars,
and what great treasure they of late have levied and gathered of their
subjects: we perceiving that all the kings majesty's procedings holy tend to
the advancement of the true glory of God, the maintenance of the majesty of
the Imperial crown of this Realm, and the defense and sauitee of us and this
his realm, fully minded to cleave and stick to God and his most holy word,
utterly determined to mainteyne his graces honor and all such rightes and
titles as be annexed to his Imperial croune, pressed and ready, to defend our
selfs and this his realm and our country: and finally content to leave
father, mother, brethren, systren, wyfes, children, lands, goods, yea, and
this mortal life also, rather then we would deny Christ and forsake his word,
which is the lyuelye food of ma^s soul, rather then we would suffer his
royal majesty, to be in any part diminished, rather then we would consent,
that the Imperial crown of this realm should be deprived of any honor,
title, right or interest thereunto belo^gyng: and finally rather then any forien
power, should do us or our country any hurt or iniurye, have thought it good
to prepare and make not only our persons ready for the wars, having a full
affyaunce and parfyt co^fydence in God, that as he always has lent victory
to such as professed him and put their hole trust in him: albeit they were but
very few and that very feeble in man's sight, in respect of ye multitude and
force of their enemies: so he now will have special regard and eye to this
little realm, and us his poor servants and little flock, taking to his
charge and defense our little shephard, till years and strength make him better
able to vicket with his enemies, and that therefore he with us and for us will
devise to withstand, resist, and subdue the force and puissau^ce of our stout
foes, no more ours then his, at the least, ours for his cause: but also to make
among us a mass of money, to relief and maintain the great and mestymable
charges that our most graciouse sovereign lord has and daily does sustain,
a thing much unable to serve any piece of his present necessities, if his grace
did mean to spare any part of his own treasure, beseching his grace, not to
cast his eyes, upon the smalnes of this our simple present, but to lay by it
our good wylles, which we make the chiefest part of our relief, it faithfully
promysyng, all the rest to be ready, when peril or enemy shall declare this not
to suffyce. First we his graces said subjects do by the authority of this
present parliament freely and frankly give and grant unto his most royal
