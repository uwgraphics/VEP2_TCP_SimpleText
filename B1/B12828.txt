By the King.
A Proclamation for repeal of certain Letters Patents, Commissions, and
Proclamations, concerning Innes, Alehouses, and the Manufacture of Gold and
Silver Thread.
WHereas the Kings most Excellent Majesty, by sundry Letters Pattents,
Commissions, and Proclamations heretofore made and published, gave several
directions, as well touching the Licensing of Innes and Hosteries, as touching
the ordering of Alehouse-keepers, and leuying the forfeitures of their
Recognizances, and likewise touching the settling of a Manufacture of Gold and
Silver Thread within this Kingdom; In all which, his Majesty's intentions were
no other but the increase of profitable Arts and Inventions, the repressing of
vice and disorder, and reformation of sundry enormities and abuses: yet by the
fraud and abuse of some persons, who with much confidence and assurance
undertook to his Majesty, to manage and execute the said Patents,
Proclamations, and Commissions, for his Majesty's honor, and the good of the
public; the same have been perverted, to the disturbance of the Justice of
the Realm, affront to Justices of Assise, and Justices of the Peace, and to
the great damage, hurt, and oppression of many of his Majesty's Subjects; which
abuses were altogether unknown to his most Excellent Majesty, until they
were discovered by the complaint of the Commons in this present Parliament,
which (had they sooner come to his Majesty's knowledge) he would have punished
with all severity. His Majesty out of his tender zeal and affection which he
bears to all his loving Subjects, being well pleased with that exemplarie
course of Justice, which to His singular contentment, has been already begun
in His high Court of Parliament, against some of the principal offenders; and
to the end that all His loving Subjects, might see how much His care and zeal
is to give remedy to any thing that is found hurtful to the Commonweal of
His people; Has been pleased of His abundant goodness, to put His own
Royal hand and Princely care, to the speedy and utter abolishing of all that
evil, which might hereafter spring from those roots.

And therefore does hereby declare and publish, that it is his express will
and pleasure, That all the said Letters Patents, Commissions, and Proclamations
beforementioned, be forthwith revoked. And does further hereby straightly
charge and command, That no person or persons, do hereafter presume to put in
execution the foresaid Letters Patents, Proclamations or Commissions, or any of
them, or any Article or thing in them or any of them contained. And his further
pleasure is, That all Innes, Hosteries and Alehouses, and the several
Inne-keepers and Alehouse-keepers thereof shall be governed, ordered and used in
all points as they should have been, if the said Letters Patents, Commissions
and Proclamations had not been made. And that all Recognizances of
Alehouse-keepers shall be proceeded with, in the same plight, manner and form,
and none other, then as they should have been if the said Letters Patents and
Proclamations concerning the same, had not been made. And whereas sundry
Alehouse-keepers, being by order of the Justices of Assise, and Justices of
Peace, put down and suppressed from keeping Victualling houses, did after by
color of the said Letters Patents, and Commissions for Licensing of Innes and
Hosteries, obtain Licenses from or by means of the said Patentees, to keep
Innes or Hosteries, His Majesty's further pleasure and commandment is, that
all such Innes so abusiuely erected, and all other Innes lycensed and set up by
force or color of the foresaid Letters Patents in unfit places, or by persons
of evil fame, be forthwith suppressed. And his Majesty does hereby require,
command, and authorize his Justices of Assise, and Justices of Peace within the
several Counties and places of this Kingdom, to take order for the
suppressing thereof accordingly, and to take further order, that the several
Lycences so unduly granted, be delivered to the Clerk of Assise, or Clerk of
the Peace in open Assizes or Sessions, there to remain until further order
may be taken for the absolute cancellation and avoiding of the same. And His
Highness further pleasure is, in regard of the said abuses, That no rent, or
sum of money due or pretended to be due for, or in respect of any such
License, for setting up of any Inn or Hostery, be at any time hereafter
levied, received or demanded; But that all assurances for payment thereof be
discharged.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the thirtieth day of March, in the
nineteenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

most Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXI.
