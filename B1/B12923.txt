By the King. A Proclamation for the better Confining of Popish Recusants,
Convict according to the Law.
WHereas by Our Laws, all Popish Recusants Convict ought to remain Confined
to their dwellings, or places of abode, or within five miles thereof, unless
in cases necessary, upon special Licenses obtained, according to the same
Laws; And where Our loving Subjects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament did,
amongst other things, humbly petition Us, That for the better securing of Our
State against the ill affections of Iesuited Papists, these Laws might be put
in due execution:

We, conceiving that these Laws will be executed with better success, if We
shall publish Our resolution herein, and by some fitting Cautions prevent those
euasions, which have been heretofore practiced for the deluding of those Laws,
and propound Rewards to those, who shall discover the offenders, Have thought
fit by this Our Royal Proclamation to declare, and do hereby declare Our will
and pleasure concerning the premises, in manner following.

First therefore, We do hereby publish Our full resolution to be, and do
hereby straightly charge and command, that those Laws, concerning the confining
of Popish Recusants, be from henceforth duly observed, and that the
offenders against the same shall incur and receive those penalties and
punishments which their high contempts deserve, and which by Our Laws ought to
be inflicted upon them.

And further, We do hereby straightly charge and command all persons
whatsoever, which by the said Laws have power to grant Licenses, in cases
necessary, to dispense with the Confinement of Popish Recusants convict, for a
time, that they take special care, that they grant no Licenses, but in such
cases where they shall find good probability of truth in the suggestions made
for the obtaining thereof, and then but for such time only, as in their
judgments is convenient for the dispatch of those occasions and businesses
which are suggested to move the granting of those Licenses.

And We do further straightly charge and command, That no Popish Recusant
convict do presume to make any feigned or untrue suggestion, for the obtaining
of such License; or if he, or she shall have cause to travail from the place
of their Confinement, that they do not suggest their businesses to be of other
nature, then in truth they be, or to require longer time of dispatch then is
requisite, that so they may return again to their places of Confinement,
without any unnecessary delay; and that during the time permitted unto them by
their Licenses, they take heed that they abuse not the Liberty granted unto
them for other purposes, then were truly intended unto them. And if any shall
adventure to offend herein, We do hereby give them knowledge, that they must
expect that punishment, which by Our Laws, or by Our Prerogative Royal, can
justly be inflicted upon the offenders for so high a contempt.

And lastly, lest the hope of impunitie may give encouragement to any to
offend, We do hereby promise, which We will constantly perform, That
whosoever shall discover any offenses, or offenders against Our said Laws, or
against this Our Royal Proclamation, unto Our Attorney General, for the time
being, whom We have commanded to take knowledge of all such Informations, and
to proceed against the offenders according to the due course of Our Laws, that
such persons who shall make such discovery, and prove the same, whereby any
offenders may receive their deserved punishment, shall be rewarded with a full
fourth part of the Forfeitures, which shall, or may come or accrue unto Us upon
the Conviction of the offenders, or other Judgment or Sentence legally had
against them, to entitle Us thereunto, as of Our free Gift.

Given at White Hall, the eleventh day of January, in the first year of Our
Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
