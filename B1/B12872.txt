A Proclamation charging all Jesuits, Seminaries, etc. to depart the Land.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, taking knowledge, as well by the humble
Petition and Advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons now
assembled in Parliament, as otherwise, of the manifold Inconveniences and
dangers, occasioned by the multitude of Jesuits, Seminary Priests, and
others, that have taken Orders by authority derived from the Sea of Rome, now
harbored within this Realm, and by their Boldness and Insolency, in
Seducing and withdrawing His Majesty's Subjects, not only from the Religion
here established, but also from their Obedience and Allegiance to His Majesty,
has thought good (for abolishing of this growing evil, and prevention of the
like in time to come) hereby to publish His Royal pleasure; And does by this
his Proclamation strictly charge and command all Jesuits, Seminary Priests,
and all others that have taken Orders by any authority derived from the Sea of
Rome, now resident, or being within this His Majesty's Realm of England, or
the Dominion of Wales, That they, and every of them, do before the fourteenth
day of June next ensuing the date hereof, make their repair to some of His
Majesty's Ports within the said Realm or Dominion, and from thence to
Transport themselves out of the same, with the first opportunity of Wind and
Weather, into some foreign parts beyond the Sea, and never after to return
into this Realm; And that all other Jesuits, Seminary Priests, and others,
having taken Orders by authority derived from the Sea of Rome, do wholly
forbear, at any time hereafter to come within this His Majesty's Realm of
England, or Dominion of Wales, upon pain, that all such as shall be found
within this Realm, or Dominion of Wales, after the said fourteenth day of
June, shall undergo the uttermost severity and punishment, which by the Laws,
in that behalf made, can be inflicted upon them: And also, that no person, or
persons whatsoever, within this His Majesty's Realm, or the Dominion of Wales,
do, after the said foureteenth day of June next, harbor, entertain, receive,
relieve, or cherish any such Jesuit, Seminary Priest, or other person, having
taken Orders by authority derived from the said Sea of Rome, upon pain, that
every person offending therein, contrary to this His Majesty's Proclamation,
shall undergo the uttermost severity of the Laws provided for such offenses.

And for the better execution of these His Majesty's directions, and Royal
pleasure signified hereby, His Majesty does Will, Require and Command, all
and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Lord Lieutenants, Judges, Justices of
Assise, deputy Lieutenants, Justices of Peace, and all other His Officers, and
Ministers whatsoever, to be vigilant and careful to do their duties and
diligence in discovering and apprehending of all the said Jesuits, Seminary
Priests, and all others offending in any the Premises, after the said
foureteenth day of June, and to cause all the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm, now in force against them, or any of them, without favor, to be put
in due and exact execution against them, as they tender His Majesty's pleasure,
and will answer the contrary.

Given at the Court at Greenewich, the sixth day of May, in the two and
twentieth year of His MAJESTY'S Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
