The Tories Resolution: Or, The Loyal VVelcome to His Royal Highness.
Tune of, Hold fast thy Crown and Scepter CHARLES.
^ SInce mighty York is come again, the Brother of our King, let all true
Tories still be glad, and every Steeplering; we will drink his Health (in spite
of Whigs, and for his welfare pray; and will his lawful rights maintain, in
spiright of K -- and G --

(2)
Here Is a Health to James the mighty D.
of York and Albany;
Confusion to his Factious Foes,
in every degree;
May Heaven still protect and keep
him from the murdering hand
Of Presbyterians, who'd exclude,
and banish him the Land.
(3)
But let them all contrive and Plot
against his matchless Fame;
And with the Association,
strive to confound his Name:
Great York shall still to loyal Hearts
their only Darling be;
Who will maintain and take their parts,
and fight his Enemy.
(4)
We Will to our King be true and just,
his Precepts we will Obey,
And fight for his Prerogative,
against Ignoramus Sway.
We Will still pray for the Royal Line,
(but in its just descent)
And will stand by our lawful Prince,
against those that would prevent.
(5)
What though the VVhigs did Vote
Great York a Papist was?
Yet we will his birthright maintain
in spite of all his Foes;
We Will make 'um all to dread his name,
and of him stand in fear;
For he has still a Lawful claim,
and will prove only Heir.
(6)
The VVhigs (perhaps) will envy us,
and say we Papists are,
But let them know we are not afraid
of what they say or swear.
Let them Associate themselves
against us loyal Hearts;
They sure shall know we have good friends
who still will take our parts.
(7)
If Covenanters should agree
once more for to Rebel,
We bravely then will show that we
can their presumptions quell.
Ou^ ^g is still as dear to us
(...) Appl^(...) Eye;
A^ (...) his Enem^^^ we will kill,
(...) ^se we will brave^^ dye.
(8)
And now, our honest Contrymen,
do you with us agree,
To Welcome home the mighty Duke
of York and Albany.
Let perjured Rogues against him swear,
yet we will always sing
Long live the Royal Duke of York,
and so God save the King.
FINIS.
