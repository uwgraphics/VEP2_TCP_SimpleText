By the King.
WHere amongst other Persons discovered to be Confederates in the late
horrible Treason, for the destruction of Our person and the whole Estates of
the Realm, one Robert Winter Esquire, is known to be a principal, who is
fled for the same, and being not found among the Company taken and defeated by
the Sheriff of our County of Worcester, does lurk in some places of our
Realm: Although We doubt not by that experience, which in this cause We have
had of the diligence of our Ministers in the apprehending of all Persons, whom
they shall have cause to suspect; Yet because the said Winter is unknown to
many, We have thought it convenient to publish a description of him, to the
end he may the sooner be found by those who shall lay wait for him, And to
will and Command all our Officers, Ministers and loving Subjects whatsoever, to
make all diligent Search for the said Winter, and him to apprehend by all
possible means, especially to do their best to keep him alive, to receive
condign punishment for his detestable crime. The like diligence We do also
will and require them to use in the apprehending of Stephen Litleton Gentleman,
whose description is also hereunder written.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the xviij. day of November, in the third
year of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

made, somewhat stouping, near forty years of age, his hair and beard
brown, his beard not much, and his hair short.

hair, no beard or little, about thirty years of age.
