By the King.
A Proclamation for the establishing of the Peace and Quiet of the Church of
England.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, in His most religious care, and Princely
consideration, of the Peace of this Church and Common wealth of England, and
other his Dominions, whereof God of his goodness has, under his Son Christ
Jesus, made him the supreme Governor, observing, that in all ages great
disturbances, both to Church and State, have ensued out of small beginnings,
when the seeds of Contention were not timely prevented; and finding* that of
late some Questions and Opinions seem to have been broched or raised in
matters of Doctrine, and the Tenants of our Religion, which at first only
being meant against the Papists, but afterward by the sharp and indiscreete
handling and maintaining of some of either parts, have given much offense to
the sober and well grounded Readers, and Hearers of these late written Books
on both sides, which may justly be feared, will raise some hopes in the
professed enemies of our Religion, the Romish Catholics, that by degrees, the
professors of our Religion may be drawn first to Schism and after to plain
Popery.

His Majesty therefore, in the integrity of His own heart, and singular
providence of the peaceable government of that people, which God has committed
to His charge, has thought fit, by the advice of His reverend Bishops, to
declare and publish, not only to His own people, but also to the whole world,
His utter dislike to all those, who to show the subtilty of their wits, or to
please their own humors, or vent their own passions, do, or shall adventure
to stir or move any new Opinions, not only contrary, but differing from the
sound and Orthodoxall grounds of the true Religion, sincerely professed, and
happily established in the Church of England; And also to declare His full and
constant resolution, that neither in matter of Doctrine, or Discipline of the
Church, nor in the government of the State, he will admit of the least
innovation, but by Gods assistance will so guide the Scepter of these His
Kingdoms and Dominions, by the Divine providence put into his hand, as shall
be for the comfort and assurance of His sober, religious and well affected
Subjects, and for the repressing and severe punishing of the insolences of
such, as out of any sinister respects, or disaffection to his Person or
Government, shall dare either in Church or State, to disturb or disquiet the
peace thereof.

And therefore his most excellent Majesty, does hereby admonish, and also
straightly charge and command all his subjects of this Realm, and of his Realm
of Ireland, of whatsoever degree, quality, or condition they be of, especially
those who are Churchmen, and by their Profession and places, ought to be
Lights and Guides to others, that from henceforth they carry themselves so
wisely, warily, and conscionably, that neither by Writing, Preaching, Printing,
Conferences, or otherwise, they raise any doubts, or publish, or maintain any
new inventions, or opinions concerning Religion, then such as are clearly
grounded, and warranted by the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of
England, heretofore published, and happily established by authority. And if
any person, of what degree soever, shall at any time hereafter, adventure to
break this Rule of sobriety, and due obedience to his Majesty, and his
Laws, and to this religious duty to the Church of God; His Majesty does
hereby straightly charge, and command all his reverend Archbishops and Bishops in
their several Diocesses, speedily to reclaim and repress all such spirits,
as shall in the least degree attempt to violate this bond of peace. And his
Majesty does also charge and command all his Counselors of State, Judges,
Justices and ministers of Justice whatsoever, that they in their several
places take especial care, to observe and execute his Majesty's pious and
Royal pleasure herein expressed.

And lastly, his Majesty does hereby give assurance to all whom it may
concern, that such as shall take the boldness wilfully to neglect this his
Majesty's gracious admonition, and for the satisfying of their unquiet and
restless spirits, or to express their rash or undutiful insolences, shall
wilfully break that circle of Order, which without apparent danger to Church
and State, may not be broken; That his Majesty shall and will proceed against
all such offenders, and wilful contemners of his gracious and Religious
government, with that severity, as upon due consideration had of the quality
of their offenses and contempts they shall deserve, that so by the exemplary
punishment of some few, who by lenity and mercy cannot be won, all others
may be warned, and take heed, how they fall into the just indignation of their
Sovereign; and that all his Majesty's good and loving subjects, who are
studious of the peace and prosperity of this Church and Common wealth, may
bless God, for his Majesty's pious, religious, wise, just, and gracious
government.

Given at Our Palace of White Hall, the 14. of June, in the second year of Our
Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXVI.
