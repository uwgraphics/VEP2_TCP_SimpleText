royal coat of arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE
By the King. A Proclamation inhibiting the Importation of Whale Finnes into
his Majesty's Dominions by any, but the Muscouy Company.
WHereas We by Our Proclamation given at Wansted, the eleventh day of
September in the twelfth year of Our reign of Great Britain, France, and
Ireland, for the reasons therein expressed, and for the encouragement of Our
well-beloved Subjects, the company of Merchants trading for Muscouia, Greeneland
and the parts adjoining, commonly called the Muscouia Company, did straightly and
expressly forbid and prohibit all Aliens and Strangers whatsoever, and also all
Our own Subjects (others then the said Muscouia Merchants, and that in their
joint stock) to bring into any Our Kingdoms, and Dominions any Whale Finnes
upon pain of confiscation of the same, and of Our high indignation and
displeasure, and of such further punishment as should be meet to be inflicted
upon the Offenders for their contempt in that behalf.

Now forasmuch as We are given to understand, That Our said Proclamation took
not that good effect, nor found that due obedience and conformity which We
expected: We have therefore in further manifestation of our former intentions
and gracious favor toward the said Company, thought good eftsoons to publish
Our Royal pleasure herein, and to revive and quicken Our said former
Proclamation, which We cannot but take in ill part, has been so much
neglected: And therefore We do by these presents straightly charge, prohibit,
and forbid, as well all Alliens and Strangers whatsoever, as also Our natural
born Subjects and Denizens, That they nor any of them (other then the said
Muscouia Merchants, and that in their joint stock only) shall from
henceforth directly or indirectly import, or bring into Our Kingdoms and
Dominions, or any of them, any Whale Finnes, upon pain of forfeiture, and
confiscation of the same, whether they be found on board of any Ship, Hoy,
Boat, or Bottom, or laid on land in any warehouse, storehouse, shop, cellar,
or any other place whatsoever, and upon pain of Our high Indignation and
displeasure, and such other punishment, as by Our Court of Star chamber
shall be thought meet to be inflicted upon them, or any of them, as contemners of
Our Royal will and commandment in this behalf.

And We do likewise straightly charge, prohibit and forbid, as well all Aliens
and Strangers, as Our natural borne Subjects and Denizens (other then the said
Muscouia Merchants) that they nor any of them do presume to buie, utter, sell,
barter or contract for, any Whale finnes, knowing the same to be imported into
any of our Realms or Dominions contrary to Our will and pleasure herein
declared, upon pain of Our high indignation and displeasure, and such further
punishment as by Our said Court of Star chamber shall be thought meet to be
inflicted upon such offenders, as contemners also of Our Royal commandment.
And to the end this Our pleasure may take the better effect, We do hereby
charge, and command all Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, Farmors,
and Collectors of Our Customs, and other our Officers and Ministers, carefully
to attend every one in his several place, the execution hereof, and in no
wise to permit or suffer any Whale finnes directly or indirectly, openly or
privately to be brought, or imported into any Our Kingdoms or Dominions,
contrary to Our Royal pleasure herein expressed, or being so imported, that
they do not permit, or suffer the same to be colourably customed for other
goods and Merchandise, but that forthwith they or some of them do seize and
take to Our use all such Whalefinnes as shall be so imported, and immediately
upon such seizure made, to give notice thereof in writing to Our Register for
forfeitures in Our Custom house in the Port of London, upon pain to undergo
such punishment, as shall be thought meet by the Lords of Our Privy Council.

Nevertheless Our intent and meaning is, That the said Muscouie Company, and
none other, shall or may buy, and sell, barter, or contract for, any such
Whalefinnes, as being imported contrary to this Our Proclamation shall be
confiscate and seized, and the same, being sold by the said Company, may be
afterward bought, contracted for, and used by any other Our Subjects at their
will and pleasure. Any thing herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

Given at Our Manor of Greenwich, the eighteenth day of May, in the
seventeenth year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of
Scotland the two and fiftieth.

excellent Majesty. Anno. M.DC.XIX.
