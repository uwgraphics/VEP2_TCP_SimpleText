The proud wives Pater noster that would go gaye, and vndyd her husbonde and
went her way.



Anno Domini. M. D. L. X.

ON hye feast days when wives go gaye
To church with great devotion
Their prayers devoutly for to say
Their thinking is on this lesson
Or they go forth them self to trym
Both heed and breast on foot and hand
I swear to you by sweet saint sym
The^ self they think angels well to understand
Their beautous be hauyour and co^tenau^ce demure
They think full pleasant for to behold
But for to go gay ye may be sure
They muse full often and many fold
And how they might best to pass bring
Each as gorgyous as other to go
In their aparell gyrdell and ring
And other trym knackes many mo.
To church they be come this is no lie
Unto their pewe there for to knele
Reverence doing to the otherby
with countenance meke and becomes the^ well
Than sit they down each gossep other by
Beholdynge their aparell of either side
if the one be gaier than the other that does epsy
Than she thinks her fellow set all full of pride
Yet to her devotion she does her set
And Pater noster she does begin
But to gay gere her heart does fret
And thinks how she may such gay gere wyn*
Saying to her self what fortune have I
That my fellow so gorgyous is in her gere
And I syte here so poorly her by
But it shall be amended by god I swear
Qui es in celis, and that within short while
Or else my husband full sore it shall repent
For I can naught get of him by fete nor wyle
But all shall be mine now that I in hand ca^ hent
From him always whatsoever betyde
Till I be arayde as other women be
I would not have ought for no manner pride
But only because it is a good sight to se
Sanctificetur nomen tuum
Lord hallowed be thy name
if to such gere I may come
Than shall I bear both port and fame
As other women in every where
Do always where as they do wend
Go feet and fresshe and trymme in their gere
In the best manner as them does to pretend
Adueniat regnu^ tuu^, thy kingdom come to us
After this life when we hens shall wend
But while we be here now sweet Jesus
As other woman have such grace in me send
That I may have lord my heed into wrap
After the guyse kercheses that be fine
And thereon to set some lusty trymme cap
with smockes well wrought soude with sylke^ twyne
Fiat voluntas tua, thy will fulfilled be
Lord god always as this time does require
And as my gossep that sytteth here by me
So let me be trymmed naught else I desire
Therefore if it may be in any wise
For thou have power thereof to do thy will
To make me go gay after the best guyse
For reason it is with right good shyll
Sicut in celo et in terra, in heaven as in earth
It is always seen, go we never so far
That women above all the beauty bears
And without gay gere our beauty we mar
Therefore good lord let this be a mended
And gay gere to were that I may have
Or else my life will have an end
For very pure thought, naught can me save
Panem nostrum cotidianum
Our daily bread lord will also do well
But of diverse corns I have many a come
At home in my barn for to sell
But there with lord I dare not mell
For fear of my husband that keeps me so hard
A busshell thereof I dare not sell
For if he wyste the game ware marde
Da nobis hodye, give us this day
And specially me my lord that am heavy at heart
Till I have my will lord a part I say
Of my desire lord, or else I must live in smarte
With that full maruayloussy can she sight
And in a swone half began she fall
Her fellow beholdynge that woeful wight
And wondered full sore than here with all
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, now
Mercy good lord and forgyuenes what is this
I was never this a frayde I make god a vow
Good lord said she than what means this
And her little finger than wrong she fast
Her to reuyue and gave her sweet spyce
So she up sterte than at the last
Like a trym gossyp that feign would be nyce
Sicut et nos dimittimus debytoribus nostris
As we do forgive lord so let us be forgyuen
And than to her she did say without mys
ye had a shrode fyt by sweet saint steven
Gossyp mine, how is it with you now
what is your grefe, now I you pray
if I can ease you by god anowe
I will be ready both night and day
Et ne nos in ducas in temptacionem
Let us fall into no temptacyon now
with that, the other reuyued then
Right sore dysmayde ye me trow
And to each other they began say
Why be ye thus sad my gossep dear
Tell me the cause, now I you pray
For if it lay in me now I will amend your chere
Sed lybera nos a malo, deliver us from all ill
Raggis and iaggis this wife began to rehearse
if I may not go gay I shall my self spyll
I pray you gossep dear, understand well this verse
My husbonde is hard to me both day and night
And does me not regard but let me go eue^ thus
Not as other do but as a wretched wight
But yet it shall be me^ded I hope by sweet Jesus
Amen, said the other I pray god it be so
For ye have good ynought this I do know well
Of good marchaundise so mote I the
As any is here in this country to sell
For his degree but he is a frayde
That he should pass his state or look on hawt
Than behind your backs it should be said
if he fore amys, that it were all your fawt
But co^petenly take the third penny of his gain
And bye therewith both kyrtell and gown
Than yet shall ye leave him always twain
So do we most part throughout the towe
Or else we should never have half our gayes
That we have ywys ye may be sure
But properly thus we find the ways
with ringes and beedes to go full demure
Rybandes of sylke that be full long and large
with tryangles trymly made point deuyse
For some folk it were full great charge
Therefore all thing by mesure by mine advise
But as for you ye may be bold
To do some what more than other may
yet it would make your husbondes heart full cold
If he so hard be and wretched as ye say
That he may not se you go as other do
And have it so well as he has in store
I would have my syne hoose and eke my trym sho
with other knackes many a score
if I were as you be, I faith I swear
Somewhat should be sold y^ he should not know
ye have to sell so diverse gere
He can not know all by god I trow
Yet may I rejoice always ywys
For my husbonde is glad when I go trym
He would think I did full sore a mys
if I went not fresshe by sweet saint sym
He does rejoice in my gay gere
when he do se me put it on
And would I should it often were
For I shall have new when mine is done
O good lord, happy be ye
That have so good a husbonde by god in throne
Among a hundredth ye shall not find three
Of all our neighbors that has such a one
if god would that mine were as your is
I would be as merry as bird on brere
But his heart is so set on couetyse ywys
That he can never be of good chere
And than causes me often for to weep
when I think on his unkindness so great
I can not ete nor drink nor stepe
For great heaviness my heart does beat
But throught your counsel my gossep dear
I hoppe the better for to speed
And for to go gayer another year
with mirth and joy my life to lead
That I may be accepted with every man
Which me beholds both far and nere
Without your helps no read I can
But by your good counsel amend is my chere
This hole in you my hope I sete
And without you I am but deed
Lusty fresshe gere how I may get
And to go trym in lusty were
Well gossep than do after me
And ye shall never repent ywys
I swear to you by Mary so fre
All shall be well; that now is amys
beware of one thing, your tongue go not to large
And forbere your husbonde when he is grame
Speak never to him of such charge
with evil mode, for that were shame
If ye of him will such thing have
As ye desire for to go gay
with loving countenance ye must it crave
And with fair words to him say
My husbonde dear I you require
Take no displeasure with my word
What soever of you I do desire
But this must be done in bed or at board
My lovely husbonde my spouse most dear
To you I must needs talk my moan
As reason requires ye he my fere
And no body else but you alone
Thus I must desire you with all my heart
Take no dyspleasure what ever I say
For if ye do, it will me smarte
And for thought I shall dye this is no nay
When he this hereh than he will muse
And meruell what your request will be
If he be gentle he will not refuse
No reasonable thing I hope perde
ye shall than say, ye lack that or this
And begin with that thing yt ye have most need
I dare say than withouten mys
The sooner of him than ye shall speed
With small tryfels ye must begin
Of him to get gay gere in store
Or else of him ye shall naught wym
And thus may ye daily increase more and more
Of gorgyous gere great plence to have
And all with his good will for that is best
if ye it so get so god me save
Than may ye were it with peace and rest
If he do not give you than good comfort
Speak ye no more but than be still
But straight to his wares resort
And thereof take ye what ye will
if he play the chorle play ye the same
And let him not know no more of your mind
God give all chorles mekyll shame
That to their wives be unkind.
if he be gentle take noughe him fro
Ly tell nor much whatsoever betyde
For if ye do it will turn you to woe
Than folk will say that it comes of pride
Se what debate this folk have now
And all because the wife would go gay
I swear to you by god auowe
ye were better bide still in your old aray^
Therefore beware be not ratshe
To do or say that should him dysplease
But if he be churlysshe give him a dasshe
Though ever after it should him disease
Among his wares spare not at all
For half is yours as well as his
Therefore as now counseyll I shall
Give unto you by heuyns bliss
To do even so and be not a frayde
For lefe nor loche why chulde ye not
The fault will all to him be laid
Of any one that hereth that
That he so chorlyshe to you is ay
And will not be friendly as other be
Great shame of him than will they say
So to be served well worthy is he
And worse be god withouten fable
if worse may be by any mean
Consydrynge that he is not unable
It ought on you for to be seen
Somewhat better for very pure shame
Than it is now by reason and right
For he is worthy to have the blame
if he will be such a wretched wight
He can not have to much displeasure
That has a young wife and will not her trym
I wysshe them care and sorrow out of measure
And specially them that be like unto him
Myrrours of myschefe we may them call
That keep their wives so bare and poor
To many one it does befall
Through such menes to make a good wife a hoar
An hoar? ye may it swear by god above
They may be wretches that so do
Which causes their wives to chose new love
Thought it should turn them to great woe
So vylaynus they be in every where
Unto their wives in every hour and tide
if their wives do go, ought trym in they, gere
They say they do it than for great pride
And all this is but ialousy god wot
That this does cause I know it well
Hangs be such husbondes by the throat
Or else the devil carry thew away to hell
That ialous be either erly or late
Upon their good wives that be so meke
God se^de the^ strife and ever debate
And a bengeau^ce upon them both day and weke
As for my husbonde I need not to crave
But fystes and staves if I will obtain
enough of them I may soon have
Thus dare I not speak for fear of pain
For no such things but I know another
I shall from him stele both day and night
I swear to you by gods dear mother
His bags I hope to make full light
if he may not se me than go gay
I think not long to tarry here
But pryuele togather what I may
And chose me than another fere
For I can not live this in wretchedness
I will leave him bare y now
It is to me great heaviness
To lead this life I make god auowe
With that all service in the church was done
These wives homewarde did take the way
For sast it drew than toward none
And so they departed and adewe began say
when she came home this sorry wife
Her husbonde full merry there did she find
She could no longer abide for her life
But needs unto him she must break her mind
To prove whether he would be to her kind
She began him flatter after the new guyse
And soon her heart she began unbind
Saying to him that in this wise
My spouse most worthy, my husbonde dear
I pray you take it for no grefe
whatsoever of you I do desire
But give my heart now some relefe
As I hope ye will, and thereto be glad
And say me not nay whatsoever befall
And than for ever I must be sad
Thus in your hand it does lay all
My trust is hole in you set
So many wives in this parysshe de
That go full lustly and trym set
A pleasure for their husdondes it is to se
And now me think ye be well moved
wherefore the bolder I to you speak
As to mine heart most best beloved
Or else a sonder mine heart would break
Desiring you with mind and will
To give me now some goodly gay gere
Some susty news my back to hill
with gyrdelles and ring for your love to were
As other women do for their husbondes love
So let me do for yours I pray
Than will ye bind me my self to move
Great good of you always to faye
I am not able to perform your will
In gyuynge to you that I not have
It is neither reason nor yet good skyll
Such things of me now for to crave
ye se your self that I do spare
And with simple clothes that I do go
Honesty would ye should help me care
And like in parell that we should go
Let us live as we have done ere
And pass not our bow^^s in no degree
To put our self in great daungere
For your small pleasure it were great pite
How tometh now such things in your mind
That ye desire me to do such cost
ye spend your labor and wind
And all your words be but lost
A lack good wife were this your will
For to go gay above your estate
And would be glad to fulfill
All your desire if it were not to late
But I am far behind the hand
As now dear wife more than I say
An hundred pound ye shall understand
with in this month I must needs pay
Toward the same wife I ne have
Twenty pound in silver nor gold
which does make so god me save
when I thereon think mine heart full cold
Therefore good wife take thereof no grefe
For I am not able as the time require
Except I should thereof be a thief
And that I think ye will not desire
For that were a shame I tell you plain
As well for you as it for me
With shame for my trespass I shode be slain
And hanged full hye upon a tree
Than men would say there hangs a thief
Which would than full sore grieve your heart
It is no need for to a^.
A shamfull name that would us cause to smarte
Thus answer she had this good wife
That her heart son into her hose
And weary she was right sore of her life
But with her busbonde she did no more gloss
Suddenly she set her hands on her side
And said than caytyfe god give the woe
I tell the plain it is for no pride
But only with other wyfes for to go
That was mynentent and nothing else
But seeing it will no otherwise be
I shall make the a hode and set it full of belles
which shall be marked in all this country
Though every man knew it I set not a fly
And what I do, now I ne care
Within short while thou shalt well spy
That I shall make thy bags full bare
With that from the board this wife began go
And bad him beware of her evil will
She said for ever she would be his fo
And do her best him for to spyll
Thereto she would labor both day and night
With all the help that she could make
And that she could get with main and might
Another should spend it for his sake
The man was wroth here with ywys
And wandered full sore what his wife ayled
He took up his hand and him did blys
wenynge to him that her wits had failed
But it was not so on myschefe she was set
The devil him self could not her turn
Though he with staves her should have bet
which made full sore his heart to mourn
Than was he bewailed all in woe
Right pyteously he did complain
Thinking always what his wife might do
Him thought for sorrow his heart was slain
Because his wife was set on rage
what best was to do he him be thought
Her furyous anger to a swage
Her mind he perceived was set to naught
Feign he would her let, this good honest man
And hepe her in goodness as he had done ere
Alas he said no read I can
Of mine undoing I stand in fear
That she will me rob by day and night
Than fare well my joy and my solas
Many a man has wrong and much unright
Through their false wives, alas, alas
And so am I like me does think
For such one is able a man to mar
For thought I can neither ete nor drink
So sore is my heart set now in care
Yet will I not my self cast away
Thought she will be lewd and also bad
With costly garments I will not ray
For my destruction to make her glad
I think she has found some vilaine knawe
That will help her to carry away my store
Yet I trust that god will me save
And preserve me from her danger for ever more
For a cursed wife is worse than a fend
If I me bless he can me not dear
But this cursed wife where ever I wend
Puts me in doubt and great fere
Wherefore I dare not go out of the door
Lest she me begyle and go her way
with some lewd knave to play the hoar
And me unto for ever and aye
Yet to my curate I will hye
And show him of my grefe what I do ayle
To know if he remedy
Me of my woe or ought me avail
In this mean while his wife was gone
Unto her gossep to show her grefe
The good man found him self alone
Withouten comfort or relefe
Than straight to the church he began him dress
Unto the curate which he there found
All ready reuest going to mess
And toward the altar he was bound
This man abode till mass was done
For to take counsel of his curate dear
When he him met right soon anon
He made his moan with heavy chere
After all gretynges to him thus he said
Sir I you require of counsel now
My wife does make me so sore dysmayde
That I am like to dye I make god auowe
With short conclusyon his matter he told
How it began and how it befell
Twene him and his wife yt made his heart cold
But ever the priest bad him do well
And god should help him ever at his need
if he did trust unto his grace
Always the better should he speed
And heaven at the last he should purchase
If she will be naught and not amend
And thou entende ever well to do
Good grace god shall unto the send
when she shall live in care and woe
Go thy way home and take no thought
But ever take heed what so befall
For such one as does set her to naught
To undo a man she cares not at all
This man did after the curates read
And home full soon he did him have
But when he came there his heart did blede
He spyed that his labor was all in wast
And that his wife had been there before
And spoiled all that she might carry
Of short ends and money that he had in store
No legger with him that she would vary
Thus was the good man undone for ever
God give all such wives care
For after that day he saw her never
But of his wealth she made him bare
Now Jesus that is heaven king
Grant all good wives that feign would do well
The joys of heaven at their ending
And to be preserved fro the pains of hell
Such Pater noster some wives do say
Another were better for their soul health
As here does fellow so should ye pray
And than ye should ever live in wealth
Here after follows the golden Pater noster of devotion.
THe father of heaven omnipotent
Of naught all this world did create
In paradyse he made Adam a pure innocent
And for his comfort Eve to him was assacyate
The serpent by fraud made them obstynate
Whereby they lost their mansyon joy and bliss
Till by thy mercy they were regenerate
Pater noster quies in celis
O blessed lord of thy great bou^tye and goodness
That sent thine own son to be incarnate
The orygynall sin of Adam to redress
By virtue of death of Christ immaculate
Which is our brother by prove cartyfycate
And thou our-father throughout chrystendome
wherefore let us merely without debate
Sing, Sanctificetur nomen tuum
Christ Jesus our king and his mother dear
Be in our need our socour and comfort
Our souls from sin to preserve clear
That the flame of charity in us report
To whom that we may resort
with blysful armony both all and sum
Sweet Jesus for us exhort
That unto us, Adueniat regnum tuum
Infuse us with grace lord in contynaunce
In every malady, poverty and tribulacyon
Perfect pacyence to keep thy perseueraunce
For any wrongful trouble or vexacyon
That we without grudge or exclamacyon
Say and pray, Fiat voluntas tuas
High and low thy might operacyon
So be it, sicut in celo et in terra
Upon shere thursday thy dyscyples thou fed
In form of bread with thine own deite
By virtue of the words of thy godhed
Bade them thine own body accipite
And eat, which for you berrayed shall be
A preseruat if against death most wholesome
Our peticyon good lord, da nobis hodye
That same, panem nostrum cotidianum
When mortal sin had us devoured
And have forgoten thy holy conuersacyon
yet let us not utterly be confounded
whom thou demyd by thy byter passion
But wasshe us with penance by full contrycyo^
Thou one and three trinitas sancta
when we require the by proclamacyon
Et dimitte nobis debita nostra.
if any creature has us offended
And trespasset forgive we all those
That their offense may be amended
Our mercy and pity to them dysclose
That when to god our passage purpose
That of his mercy habounde yt we may not mys
Forgive us good lord, sicut et nos
Dimittimus debitoribus nostris
Another peticion we ask our father
That we be not overcome by temptacion
But we to Christ our own brother
Call for aid and obtain remissyon
And of our sins clean to have absolucyon
By merit of the brygpt sterre of Betheleem
To whom we pray with humble devotion
Et ne nos inducas in temptacionem
The father, the son, and the holy ghost
Three persons vndeuyded, and one in essence
Make in us trynyte by thy power most
Thy body, thy soul, thy godhed in presence
So conserve us here in thy absence
To use well five and observe ten
That deedly sin combre not our conscience
Sed libera nos a malo. Amen
Finis.
