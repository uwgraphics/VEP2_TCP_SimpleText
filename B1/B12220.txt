ESSAYS Or rather, ENCOMIONS, Praises of SADNESS: AND OF THE EMPEROVR IVLIAN
the Apostata.

To the READER.
IF those precepts that advise the preventing of the infirmities of the mind,
have bin ever more safe and sweet, the^ theirs that like laws hold their peace
until they have them in their power, and then pluck them up by the roots: is
he that prescribes temperance be the best Physicion: he the best Pilot that
foresees a storm: he the best Statesman, that understands the dangers of his
Country in their bud and greenness: and in a word they the happiest
Counselors, that seek to keep us out of the contingency of peril: it is not
impossible (Reader) but I may be of some use to thee: But I praise Sadness, so
does the Physicion his medicine, which howsoever thy taste abhorres, thy reason
desires, and being once down, thou art content to forget the lothsomnesse, and
regard the operation. I will commend my prescription to thee no further, then
that it cannot hurt; what good it may do, let thy experience resolve thee;
which the warranty of the safety may inuit thee to: If it wants those graces
and embellishments that he has need of, that adventures on an innovation; let
a plain true tale be accepted better then a filed falsehood; especially since
through the cloud of mine Ignorance truth shows thee light enough, to direct
thy way, though not to delight thee in thy journey: I seek not honor from
thee, nor am I the subject of thine opinion; thy censure shall only concern
thy self: for me, though I should hold my cloak the faster for the wind;
yet shall I never yield it to the Sun; he that feels not their present
power, needs not fear the future, and I am armed against both, either with a
knowledge or a dullness of proof: And so I leave thee to thine own judgment
if thou have one; or if thou have not, to live like the Moale by hearing:
Farewell.

THE PRAISE OF SADNESS.
THey that have blessed their time with drawing into their own bosoms the
consideration of the world and her mutabilities; and kept them there, to
strengthen their reason against the vanity and waywardness of their affections
and passions, know already, I may offend opinion, but not truth, undertaking as
impertinent a work, as he that intended to praise Hercules: to these I
address not my self, unless they will please to perfect me, since I cannot
them. But to those I am directed, that either the smyles of Fortune have
deprived of the true knowledge of the condition of man, or youth has not yet
ripened; or such vulgar and earthly creatures, whose judgment dazeled with
beholding the outward splendour of Fortunes Minions (the miserablest of all)
cannot or will not see with what terrible cares and discontentments, the purple
robe is lined.

I know, but fear not, the danger of cherishing and defending so unwelcome a
guest as sadness; so shunned, so abhorred: For since I am well assured, they
have condemned rather her countenance, then her self: and that both her Judge,
Jury, and hangman, has bin that acrie monster Opinion; that takes all upon
trust, and answers nothing with reason; I was the rather inclyned to be her
friend, because opinion was her enemy; the first proof of her goodness, The
first proof of her goodness.
since she is hated, by so false and obstinate an enemy to wisdom and
Judgment.

First then, because our humane weakness, and chiefly those that I desire to
instruct, understand best by contraryes; as health is best known by sickness,
plenty by want, it is fit I show them what mirth is made of: and over what a
troop she commands; that beholding her, and her band disrobed and anatomized,
weary and ashamed of the sight, they may by putting off their preiudicat
obstinacies, be made first hearers, and consequently obeyors, of a worthier
conductor.

What Mirth is.
That mirth is a natural quality of man's, I deny not, but withal, I think it
one of those that he has little cause to boast of; it is true that he makes
mirth and sadness the balance of his affections and passions, and is wayed by
them: thus he accounts his winnings and losings, and the same is expressed in
sadness or mirth: but whether most of these supposed winners, are not rather
betrayed, then supported; loosened, disordered, and corrupted; then
strengthened, grounded, and instructed, I think there is no man that has well
observed himself, and his passages considerately, but will affirm. Who can
doubt of this, that knows the slightnes of her composition? children make her
of babies, and hobby-horses: young men of sports, hawks, horses, dogs, or
worse: old men of riches, Statesmen of adorers, honor, and advancement; Women
of gay clothes, many lovers, and flattering glasses: it is one God they adore,
though worshipped in several shapes: and though the difference amongst them
makes them despisers of one another choice; yet to the vninteressed beholder,
they play al at one game, though not all for one sum. Et que veneraris et
quae despicis, vnus exae quabit cinis.

We have touched the aim, and end: Let us now see the pursuers and adorers of
mirth; and they that make her the goddess of their actions, a people either so
light and imperciptible, as nothing can come beyond their senses: or so
opinionatiue and obstinate, or rather so drunk with pleasure, as they will not
know, what they may and must: or a third sort, that clap mirth between them
and their consciences, for fear of corrasiues, that keep her up like a ball,
and run after her, to be the further off from themselves, who might know,
though Vinum, cantus, somnus, commot iunculas illas primas, non raro sanarunt
irae doloris, amoris at nunquam aegritudinem, quae radices egit et fixit pedem,
to caracterize these further then in generality, were needless: for what shall
the picture need, where the original is so common? with what other are
brothell-houses, and Tauerns stuffed? Voluptas, humile, servile, imbecillem,
caducum; cuius Statio et formices et popinae sunt, what are the inhabitants of
theaters, meetings, feasts, tryumphes, but such as either acknowledge no God so
willingly as Mirth and Pleasure; or such as dare not come home into themselves,
for fear of their errors and miscarriage?

In the mean time, O poor reason, at how base a price art thou sold? Or art
thou but a name without an essence? Or a broken Reed that the will of man dares
not stay it self upon, for fear of falling? Or else what a blue-eyed choice is
theirs, that for the most idle, momentary, and sick effects of mirth, and
pleasure, impawne not only their time, (which is vnredeemeable) but
themselves, which they think too well sold to repurchase.

But now it is fit I hasten to them, who seek not mirth, but are sought of
her: for such is the lust of Fortunes benefits, as whilst the body feels her
self able to purchase her desires, and to gorge her senses, she abandons
herself to all sensualities, and rejoices in her own fullness: to you then,
upon whom none but fair winds have ever blown in this careire of your
supposed happiness: can you see for all your high and ouertopping places, your
end and resting place? Or are you not rather the arrows of the Omnipotent
arm, that are yet flying, not at yours, but at his mark: and are no more
owners of your own purposed ends, then you were guilty of your own
beginnings? In the mean time effeminated with your prosperity, and as it were
still sucking upon the breast of Fortune, if she turns her back and retires,
how miserable does she leave you? Still bleating after the teat, and like
those nice creatures, that become tame with taking their bread from others
hands, unable to administer to your selves the least help or comfort.

We do see that Nature and all her productions support them and her self by
incessant changes, and reuolutions; generation and corruption being to the
earth like rivers to the sea, in a restless current, and perpetual progress:
do we see the flourishing and falling, not only of Kings and Princes; but of
Kingdoms and Commonwealths, Cities, Trophies, and whatsoever the vain
imagination of man has contrived for the ouercomming of time? and can we upon
some small remnant of Fortunes bounty, think to establish a perpetuity of
mirth and pleasure? No, no, he that takes not this time to provide for a world,
and in the midst of his pleasures does not think how frail and transitory
they are, will pay dearly for his iollity; when surprised by death, or some
disaster, they leave him in an instant, so much more miserable then others; as
he has depended upon such uncertainties: without which, his life is most
loathsome unto him, and with which, death most fearful and abhorred.

But to what end is all this tendered to the adorers and lovers of mirth? Their
heads and hearts are all ready filled with their own delights: which must be
consumed by affliction, before the precious balm of Sadness can either enter
or work. Fabius said, he feared more Minutius victories the^ ouerthrows: which
may be rightly applied to the general disposition of man, his successes
infecting him with an ignorant confidence, intoxicating his reason with
presumption and ostentation, which are such daily effects of worldly
prosperities, as they that think themselves Lords, are often the unworthiest
sort of slaves: and their opinionatiue happiness, the most wretched misery:
not unlike the mad Athenian, that imagined himself possessed of al, when
indeed he was true honor but of his own distemper and lunacy.

To young men there belongs more pity, as well because nature has her hand in
this their thirst of pleasure: they being yet by the heat of blood, and the
quickness of their spirits, and the strength of their senses, jolly and
gamesome: as also that it must be time, and the wounds and skars, gotten by
their wretched carelessness, that must make them capable of advice: since (as
Plutarch says) their heady passions and pleasures set over them, more cruel
and tyrannous Governors, then those that had the charge of their minorities:
now who is it that leads this distracted dance, of youth, but mirth? for
whose sake and pleasures they are inseparable companions: what is irregular,
indiscreet, unlawful, dishonest; nay, what laws, either of man's natures, or
Gods, are in these apprehensions, strong enough to contain them within their
bounds? Galba in his adoption of Piso, amongst his other praises says; you
whose youth has needed no excuse: a commendation so rare and glorious, as
there needed no more to illustrate his name and fame to all posterity; for who
else, unless fettered and chained with nature or fortune, but in their first
wearing the fresh garment of youth, have not soyled and spotted it; as their
whole life after (though painefully and industriously directed) has not bin
able to wipe out their faults, and refresh the gloss of their reputation? hence
it is, that Delicta inuentutis meae and ignorantias meas ne memineris Domine,
is taught by all, and used by all; so inevitable a disease is youth: of which
we need no witness, since every man's conscience does justify it; the
generality and antiquity, having made it venial: and by consent, we bind none
from these slips and stumbles, but old men and and women: the rest pass the
musters so far from checking, as they produce many of their follies as the
marks of spirit, and generosity: and by their will would make of an old vice,
a young virtue: who can hope now to deliver this flourishing season of youth,
from these Caterpillars? since mirth and pleasure allures; opinion animates;
and community hides them from the sight of themselves and actions: this it is
that makes nothing more currannt, then to pay one another with our faults, and
no man trusts so much to his own virtue, as to his neighbors or Companions
vices; we repose our selves in the defect of others, and no man strives
further, then to be comparatively good: we advance our selves upon ruins, and
think our selves well, because another is worse: O lame shift! O drunken
remedy! I will then say but this, to those young men that will hear me, Since
you know not the way to true happiness and contentment; ask not of them that
are yet in the race; but of them that have passed it: propose unto your selves
some pattern to imitate, (nisi ad regulam prauam non corrigas) and to
strengthen your judgments, behold those that have already acted their parts:
take one of these admirers of mirth and pleasure; and an other that has ever
made his reason the taster of all his actions: and compare these together, and
then choose which of them you would be: there cannot thus far off be so
corrupted a judgment, as not to know the best; the difference is then a little
time, and hoc quod senectus vocatur, pauci sunt circuitus amoru^: Behold then
the match, for a few years to boot, this vicious hateful person is taken,
that devoured his own honor and reputation: and with his pleasure swallowed
even his very soul, and that lives now but in his infamy: rather then that
well ordered spirit, that has left a true and perfect circle of a discreet
governed life and death, and left the world heir of many rich and worthy
examples: who in this consideration, but must cry out with the Psalmist, O
what is man, that thou art so mindful of him, etc? or why having taken our
judgments thus halting, should we reply upon it? carrying us through the
world; that in our entrance has thus stumbled and fallen: he has then the
first sign of recovery, that in this his beginning mistrusts his own ways;
and dares offer his wounds to the Surgeon: it is an incurable ignorance, that
dares not put it self to mending. Plato would have offenders repair to the
Judge and Magistrate, as to the Physicions of the soul, and submit themselves
to punishment, as to the medicine of recovery, but this was too high an
imagination for practice; yet thus far we may go, and upon the ground; and
not in the air: having, upon a due examination, found it fit to mistrust our
selves, it follows even in common reason, not to throw our selves rashly into
any action: but to assist our weakness with gaining consideration time: this
disarms our passions of their violence, for their motion being out of heat, and
never going but running, being once stayed, and overtaken by reason, they after
willingly submit themselves unto her* and are easily managed: It is an axiom
in Philosophy, that our first motions are not in our own power: which is true
no longer then we list: for he that will not imbarke himself, without a pause
and deliberation, dissolues the Acrimony of his affections; and makes them of
the cruellest Tyrants the most profitable servants. It is true, our ignorance
and sloth make every thing terrible unto us: and we will not because we dare
not, and dare not because we will not: this makes us submit our selves to any
thing that does either flatter or threaten us: and like some sottish weaklings,
that give the reins of their government, into the hands of their wives or
servants; thinking then they buy their peace, when they sell it: thus do they
grow upon us, and by composition, not force, become masters of the place; being
just so strong as we are weak. The scouts of Antigonus relating unto him the
multitude of his enemies, and aduising by way of information the danger of a
conflict, that should be undertaken with so great an vnequality: he replied,
And at how many do you value me? In this civil wars of our selves the first
disorder and consequently our overthrow proceeds from a false valuation of our
own strength: we are content to embrace our own true natural worth, so we
may have leave to yield our selves to some furious passion or soothing
affection: but would we now take a true knowledge of our own value, we might
easily redeem our selves: God and nature have not dealt so tyrannically with
man, as to give him charge of that he cannot hold: if we lose the game it must
be by play: wherefore since we are likely to be besieged by the world, and her
allurements; lest famine or treason surprise, let us turn out of the walls,
all unprofitable pleasures; and know betimes that mirth becomes neither the
fortune, nor condition of man: so is he environed with dangers, and so subject
to intrappings, omnis vita supplicium est, there is no day, hour, or moment,
that brings a certain cessation of arms: but to the contrary, our life is a
continual war-fare, representing unto us incessant dangers and perils:
wherefore we must always stand upon our guard, and keep a straight watch upon
our selves; not only examining the humors that go in and out, their arrants,
and pretenses: but even every motion and thought; for of so many different
pieces is the little world of man compounded: so stirring, so infatigable, so
full of changes and counter-changes, so suddenly elevated, as soon dejected:
and in a word, such a composition of contrarieties; as he that does not
continually observe himself, and steddily fix his eyes upon all his actions;
shall suddenly grow a stranger to himself, and be utterly ignorant of his
own proceedings: if this then be a time for mirth, we may easily imagine; who
does not alone call all the parts and faculties of man from their duties and
charge, to feast and glut themselves with sensualities; but returns them so
corrupt and debaunched, as like Hannibals army, after their wintering in
Campania, they cannot be known for the same men; so have they melted their
courages with delicacie, and with riot made themselves impatient, and almost
incapable of discipline. To conclude, such is the weakness of man, and so
strong are his bodily inclinations, as if he does not divert or break the
force of his affections, reason alone is not able to resist them: wherefore as
Plato allowed old men, mirth and wine, to revive nature almost tired in her
long journey, and to refresh their spirits benumbed with the coldness of their
dwelling: by the same reason, it is forbidden youth, whose blood being now at
the hottest, by the least addition, or increase, falls into the diseases of
excess, the most violent and irresistable extremes: we see then it is
prescribed but for a medicine, and by the difference of the constitutions of
young men and old, it can be no more wholesome for the one, then dangerous for
the other: howsoever since it is prescribed medicinably, the too frequent use,
must either destroy the operation, or leave only the malignant quality alive
and uncorrected, unto those whom the outside of Fortune dazels and allures,
there is nothing to be said by way of advice; being such, as neither nature,
nor education has favored, but are left to act the base and illiberal parts
upon this stage of the world: this is the multitude, the vulgar, the people
that are bought and sold, and reckoned by the hundred and the thousand, and
bear no price single and alone; a madness it were then, to think to move and
convert them together, when our Savior that fed 5000. of them, and as many
heard him, could neither with the admirablenesse of his miracles, nor the
excellency of his doctrine prevail with them all, and return them all
believers: this were sufficient to deter me even from but touching upon this
quick-sand, were they not the harbor of opinion, where she is still rescued
from the lovers of truth: neither is it impossible that some, yet of her and
their party, upon a truer information may forsake and be ashamed of their
station, or to be a piece of the body of this great Beast.

There is nothing can enter into consideration more strange and improbable,
then to see even the most active and understanding spirits, to refer themselves
and their proceedings to the multitude, to esteem themselves at their price,
exceeds their memories and powers of satisfaction. The young man that thought
to escape the being seen in a Tavern, with retiring further into it, was
justly reprehended for going further in: but such is the nature of vice, it
has an alluring look, and a detayning tail, our desires first allure us to
things unlawful, and when we are there, our fear bars us in; but if every man
knew how much more right he might have from his own tribunal, if he will
freely and sincerely give his reason her own power, and how justly an vnabused
conscience will proceed, and how sweetly and securely he sleeps, that has
received from them his quietus est, he would for ever disclaim the censure of
opinion; and with Phocion mistrust himself, because the people praised him:
erubuit quasi peccasset quod placuerit: and as the Prince of morality advises,
Non respuit quid homines turpe iudicent aut miserum, not it, qua populus; sed
vt scidera contrarium mundo iter intendunt, ita hic aduersus opinionem omnium
radit: but thus far had I gone out of the way, had I not pursued opinion.

To come now near our purpose, in examinations, circumstances are not
neglected, if they any way conduce to the end of our inquiry: thus Judges and
Magistrates make their uses and advantages of names, and countenances, though
it be impossible to make either so much as accessory: first then we find, that
Sadness has ever been received as a witness of truth; as In Sadness
amongst honest men, is taken for an infallible asseueration: whereas mirth has
so little credit, as when rashness or falsenesse has made an escape, by the
tongue, the refuge is to lay it to mirths charge: who as a licensed Buffone,
has often leave to pass the bounds of modesty and truth: again, mirth is so
like drunkenness, that they are at this day, but as two names of one thing,
and merry, means drunk, and drunk merry: whereas sober expresses a discreet
temper, to raise and deiect themselves at the pleasure of their breathes, to
take warrant from their countenances: and in a word, to live and dye at their
appointments: when single, they scorn and despise them, and think even their
best thoughts scarce worthy of their footboy, yet the pattern and piece
differs not; and any one as far as sufficiency expresses the whole, as
Physicions say of the diseases of the body that are, and the same may come from
different causes: so this of the mind, which proceeds either from the laying
their ambitious hopes upon popularity, or such as guilty of their own
intentions, dare not put themselves upon the trial of their consciences.

A third sort there are, that feed, and cloth, and talk, and walk, and have
delivered themselves and their behavior to be brought up by Opinion; these
since they cannot be separated from the multitude, neither can be, nor are
worth the singling: for those that Ambition has persuaded to this popular
folly, they are worthy to be deceived: and were it not, that in all inordinate
desires reason is first vanquished, they could not but know; this beast is tame
but in fair weather; they love that part of you which they understand, which
is your fortune, love and friendship begins in the soul, and ends in the
body: and theirs begin in the body and ends in the fortune: the two lignaments
that tie the men to a justness and decorum in all their actions, are wit and
honesty; which they being defective in, can no more love truly; then he can
speak that is borne dumb. Wherefore further then commiseration, and the
common duties of humanity, it is a madness to be popular: for as they say, the
chief strength of the Lion lies in his tail, so theirs in their mouths;
which as it deuoures all you give, so they go no further to pay for all they
take. It is true, Vbicunque homo est, ibi beneficio locus ect: thus far
charity commands, and further is ridiculous, or dangerous, or both: in Princes
unto whom they belong as a charge, and who has power to make them fear, if
they will not love, popularity is no vice, but a part of use, and as dangerous
for them to neglect, as for a private man and a subject to follow and affect.

We have nothing more common and in practice amongst decayed beauties,
banquerouted by time or accidents, then to hide it from others eyes with art,
and from their own with false glasses: no otherwise is it with them, that from
the reflection of opinion behold the state and condition of their minds; surely
he is afraid to hear truth, that dares not inquire of himself: it is against
our wills, if we transport to foreign eyes, or ears, any wares that are not
substantial, or at least formal: they are in the dark, and visible but to
our selves, that are fit for reformation: and as we know best their begettings
and births, so are they the natural subjects for our own consciences to work
upon: it is long since received, that in one, and the self same man, there may
be a good man, and an ill Citizen; men and laws take knowledge of vice, no
farther then their own interest: diseases that threaten but one, are opposed
but by one, they are contagious and infectious, that are resisted by
generality. They then that go to opinion, to know the temper and disposition
of their minds, go to the market, rather to sell then to buy: and love better
to paint the walls and outsides of themselves, then to rectify and repair
their inward errors and defects: but far worse it is with them that dare not
come to trial, where their facts and actions are known, which is at home: is
not this like children, which shunning the reprehension and chastisements of
one fault, multiply it to many? Or like the careless debtor, that suffers the
interest to outgrow the principal? How truly does this prove the cowardice of
vice, or rather the sottishness, since he considers not, that as fast as he
runs from fear, the same haste he makes to desperation, where they ineuitably
end, that never reckon with themselves, till the sum vnimpeached by drink or
any other excess?

For the continuance, what men carry more mistrust before them, then those,
that have worn out the sobriety of an honest look, with a continual girning
or laughing? a mark of natures, so seldom failing, as it is in every
observation held, for an irrecouerable defect either of wit or honesty: of
such stuff are commonly flatterers, time-pleasers, and faunguists made: people
so obnoxious to virtue and worth, as were it not that they breed and live only
upon the lust of Fortune, it were impossible to keep them from a general
extirpation. For it is they that have bereaved greatness and riches of
innocence, and made it of a dead and indifferent instrument in the power of the
disposer, to have hatched more monsters then all the brood of vices besides:
and in a word have been the visablest and chiefest procurers of the heavy
sentence of our Savior against rich men; that it is easier for a Camel to
pass through a needles eye, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
heaven.

In the contemplating Sadness, and mirth, me thinks, I see the true forms of
the two Ladies that offered themselves to Hercules, at his entrance into the
way of the world, Virtue, and Pleasure, the first with a settled composed
countenance (not unlike the South sea) full of peace, certainty, and truth: no
ouerruling passion disordering or raising the least billow, or moving the
smallest breath of perturbation: the other like a shop that sets out the best
wares to the view, and offers many pleasing morsels to the senses, and at the
first seems to resemble bounty it self in freeness and sweetness; but alas,
she is too soon won to be constant, she brings not in your reckoning, til
you have consumed what she set before you, and then you shall know they are too
dear, when it is too late to refuse them: her smiles and allurements, are like
the sunshine days of winter, storm-breeders: her cleerenesse, warmth, and
calmness, produce ever clouds and tempests; repentance, griefs and
anxieties of the soul; and as Phisicians hold, a continual requiring stomach
an infallible Symptomie of a corrupt and diseased body: so may be said of the
lovers of Mirth, that pass from one pleasure to another, and dare not let
their brains settle, lest they should see their own deformities, their
corrupted manners and the leprosy of their minds.

Hitherto Sadness has gotten but a preeminence, and has but proved her
self better then a worse; not approved her own goodness: it is now time, to
display her in her own excellency, not such a one as reuerts all things upon
it self, and regards no quality that returns not laden with profit; but such
a communatiue goodness, as grows not poor by imparting; but redoubles it
own strength, riches, and splendour, with lending, assisting and dividing it
influence on others: but before I offer her, and her qualities to the view, it
is necessary I decipher her: Philopamen, for want of an interpretor, was set to
cleave wood by his hostess, for his own entertainment: the eye is a nice,
busy and undertaking sense, if reason or judgment prepare not her way.

I mean not then, under the name of Sadness, to defend effeminate bewailings
and lamentations; let them a gods-name, that subject themselves to this weakest
impatience, be also subject to the Lycian law; that bound these kind of
lamentors to be arraied like women; nor am I an approuer, of a ridgid, sour,
morose austerity, since it is seldom other then the visard of envy, or
vainglory: such were Nero his Philosophers, nec deerant qui voce vultuque
tristi inter oblectamenta Regia spectari cuperent: neither is it a small motive
to their condemnation, that the nouice and inquirer after virtue is deterred,
to see her disciples so ouer-clowded and drowned in heaviness: rather like the
followers of a Funeral, then her minions and beloved, whose power and bounty
does not alone extend it self unto all deseruers, but makes all lives,
fortunes, and accidents, not alone tolerable and to be endured; but sweet,
wholesome, easy and often times glorious, and exemplare: neither will I praise a
sorrow, that as Pythagoras says, eats his own heart; that abandons the
rudder in a storm, and dares not live for fear of dying.

Wise men know, it is the condition of humanity to be tossed with contrary
winds, and those are the seasons of distinction between wise men and fools:
every man looks gayly in a holiday fortune, but to be basely set by, and to
shine through an obscure fortune, illustrates the riches and pretiousnesse of
the mind: man has not the throwing of the dice, but the playing of the cast:
he is Lord over his intentions, the other part reaches up to heaven: where
successes and effects are delivered back, not according to the appetite of
man, but the inscrutable wisdom of God, and upon that we ought to rest our
selves, not only with patience, but with comfort; that the only fountain of
knowledge has taken it into his own hands, of whose better disposing, it were
the greatest impiety and infidelity to make the least doubt or question: but it
is sadness that prepares us for the acting of this and the rest of our life
truly; and as we ought: who must not be understood to be of the descent of
Niobe, still laboring in tears and exclamations: nor a vainglorious or
envious Philosopher, that big with his own profession, labors to proclaim
it in his looks: nor a silent fretting sorrow, that will needs marry his
afflictions: A true description of Sadness.
but Sadness whose portrature I would present from the general state and
nature of man, has drawn her self into an habit or posture; in some places
fit to resist the incursions of her enemies: in others to divert them, and
sometimes like a wise Conqueror; making them of the cruellest foes, assured
friends or loving subjects: her outside is sober, calm, constant, modest, and
for the most part silent; her inside full of peace, industry and resolution.

To reduce these into a shorter and sounder way, what knowledge, art, or
science is there, more necessary and important, then that which is wholly
devoted to the ordering of our life? this does Sadness most aptly and
effectually: first instructing, then adorning, and lastly, governing the life
of man, with so much tranquillity, certainty, and happiness, as if we will
trust either reason or example, we shall find no lives to carry so continual a
contentment as these: nor none so often, and so continually miscarry as the
contrary.

Since then in these are comprehended the whole course of man's life, we will
draw the picture of Sadness within this compass: so shall I not praise her
more then profit my Reader: or if I fail, an unskillful Painter may spoil a
picture, but not a face; which a worthier undertaking, may purchase glory, by
the spoils of my imperfections: since it is not then with man, as with other
creatures, that are endowed with the greatest part of their understanding, at
the very entrance into the World, which being bounded and limited within a
self preservation, extends no further then to a present consideration of them
and theirs: as it is a natural property infused rather into their being, then
into them; and rather to the profit of nature, and her conservation, then for
their particular benefit: as at the first it is straight, and narrow, so time
ripens it not, nor dilates it: far otherwise it is with man, whose reason
grows with him, and whose judgment (as not compatible with his youth) is
delivered unto him when he comes to age: at least his minority is but the
seed-time: in his Autumn comes his harvest, that is the time of his
instruction; this of use.

Women enemies to true Sadness.
Now, whether it be from the pride of man, that loves not to look so low as his
infancy, or the contempt he has to impart his time to a poor lump of flesh,
or that since Nature has forced him upon women, he thinks to turn the
imperfections of time upon the imperfections of Nature, and that they are
fittest to breed and hatch their puling wayward weaknesses: whether from one,
or from all, or from some more hidden cause: certain it is, that to the most
men in particular, and to the commonwealth in general, there arises great
loss, by sacrificing these their first years, unto their tuitions: from hence
it comes, that when Poets would set up a mark for imitation, they durst never
trust a woman, so much as with their nursing; but borrowed of their
imagination, either a Goddess or a Nymph, or rather then fail, a meaner
creature. Some Philosophers would allow them, no more interest in our
conception, then to receive cherish, foster, and re-deliuer us: but alas, the
large portion of the imperfections that we inherit from them, assures us the
contrary: but since it is so much; as time, reason, instruction, and whatsoever
the wit of man can apply, can never utterly expel; hardly correct, or temper:
what a stupid carelessness, reigns over the world, to increase our defects, by
enlarging their time of government.

But neither to offend them, nor stay further from my subject; their
dispositions will not take the rich color of Sadness, which ever yeeldes that
tranquillity and settlednesse of mind, that can propose the end, and prosecute
the way, without diuersion, or error: at least, without those that disioyne our
intentions; and overthrow our purposes: whereas (the very springs of passions
and affections) take and change their forms, at the pleasure of every
representation, not upon a deliberated judgment; but according to the
consultation and conclusions of their senses.

Thus when we may see the power of Sadness, for instruction; since they that
want it, are not to be trusted with education, yet not to leave enemies behind
us, though I wish we might observe their order, that set wild birds eggs,
under those that are domesticke and tame, to alter their wild condition into
their foster-mothers more mild and familiar: and so could wish our dry nurses
were men, and such as could teach them words made of reason, as well as wind;
and though there be many severe, (if not malicious) censures given us, by our
forefathers, against them in all ages, and by all countries, and by all
professions; of which infinite co^currence of censures, I will give but one
instance, nelle cose di consiglio in vna d^nna, e capace di poterlo dare ne
meno di pigliarlo per se e tanto p^ggio da teneclo secreto mat; yet doubt I
not, but they are owners of such perfections, as bounded, and kept in their
own circumference, are of much use and pleasure: and they are to be honored
by us, no less then our mother earth, from whom we no sooner come, but we
strive to return again: to conclude, since we cannot be without them, it is
great reason, they should be entertained with a due respect: which is rather
sweetly, then seriously: let them have their own interest religiously
answered; and for more, since it but corrupts them, and shackles us; whatsoever
old men and mad men do, or have done; wise men for their sakes, will attend
their charge, with more circumspection.

If then we desire to frame a man that shall deserve his being, and to be
master of himself and time: let us begin betimes, to set such Governors over
him, as may both by their examples, and instructions, daily reflect upon him,
and infuse into him the grace, and most instructiue influence of Sadness, for
by this means he lives fortified against the grand corrupter of youth
Pleasure: and the violent enemy of Age, Grief. Surely the beam that keeps the
cogitatio^s of man even, is none other then Sadness: for he that thinks to
buy his peace with accumulating riches, or to be too strong for fortune, with
making himself powerful, does but apply an outward medicine for an inward
disease: which though it may sometimes ease, seldom cures: but Sadness, that
keeps us at home, daily shows us the brittle frailty of all exterior things
(which makes us like an Army pestered with too much carriage, neither fit to
fly nor fight) unites our inward powers, defends our reason, from the vapors
and mists of our affections; and standing between the extremes of mirth and
sorrow, is the only perfect moderator of our humane actions. Cato, though he
had many learned slaves, would not commit the education of his son to them, but
himself became his instructor: which I attribute to no other consideration,
then that he rather chose, to frame him to a well composed Sadness, then to be
excellent in any Art or Profession: vt modestior, non vt lepidior fiat, a
perfection fitter for a mechanicke earner, then a true owner of himself: since
it is the forming of the mind, not the tongue or hand, that can prefer us to
true felicity.

Now that we may touch as it were with our finger how much Sadness conferres,
toward a perfect instruction; what is more proper and peculiar to the forming
and framing of the mind to wisdom and goodness, then first to keep out
vice, and then so to work, prepare, and temper the mind, as it shall be
always fit to receive and contain the wholesome documents of virtue and
honesty? Which does Sadness, so naturally and effectually, as all other
things, that offer themselves for this use, are in comparison, left handed, and
stepmothers to education.

First then, as one says pretily in his imagined wife, that he would have her,
of a denying behavior; as if a fort accessiuely situated, could not be
impregnable, since assaultable: and as he says therefore, he comes too near,
that comes to be denied, and as Ovid, that great trader into those parts,
could never find armor of proof for Chastity, but not to be proved, casta est
quam nemo rogauit, she is chaste, whom no tongue yet did taste: so doubtless,
he shall pass the narrow way of Virtue, with fewer impediments, that his owner
of this sober preuentiue behavior, then those alluring countenances, which
keep open house for all comers: one Philosopher would have bolsters made, to
stop the ears of young men, from contagious noisome sounds; but he that has
made Sadness his Porter, shall not need them, since his very presence deters
and checks their loose imaginations, and they dare not confess themselves to
him, that has their condemnation written in his face: hoc secum certe
tulisset, neminem coram Catonem peccare. Pedlers open their wares willingest to
women and children: in a word, as they say the Amatist preuents drunkenness,
so is Sadness the preservative against the entrance of a number of vices.

Will we then frame a man fit to command and obey? to govern others and
direct himself? a man so squared by the vnfaileable rules of wisdom and
judgment, as to know how to become all places, and to use all fortunes? Bind
his tender youth to a disposition tempered with Sadness: for this man can
neither seduce his minority with ill examples, nor mar his waxen age, with a
false impression, too common a condition of these dissolute times: where our
children with their milk, and their very first words, suck in obscene
speeches, and dissolute behavior: and imitation, and custom, has given them
the very habit of vice, before they have either loved, or chosen them.

But this falls not out to the pupils that are governed by men of this
carriage: for since it is resolved, that this Sadness is not an accident of
their complexions, but a guard hammered out of their discourse and the issue of
a happy matched discretion and experience: they do already so well know, that
all the allurements of vice offer themselves, but like players and iugglers, to
show you sport, and to gain by you: and this word recreation, is but the
outside of times wastfull and wilful consumption: and that not only the
hours so spent, are utterly lost; but which is far worse, this continual
excitation of the bestiall part of man, prouokes his lusts and sensualities
unto an unquenchable dropsy.

Doubtless, as complexions are apter to the infection of bodily diseases, one
then the other; so behauiours to the contagion of the mind: mirth is made of
pleasure, and with pleasure all vices are baited; whereas this Sadness is the
complexion of a mind that knows this, and therefore hates and disdaines
Mirth: I know experience is the chiefest evidence, that age can produce to
prove their right to wisdom; but that which makes their judgments strong
enough, to make their experience of more use, then a bare tale, is a decay of
their senses, grown too weak to trade for themselves, and the fitter to be
set to our reason to make up a true harmony of all the parts, to the good and
preservation of the whole: the same effect has Sadness with young men, that
this decay of nature has with old; for when the consenting part, or will of
man, is so rectified with a sad consideration of the true value of all that the
senses present unto her; well may they long to please themselves, with their
several objects: but when that desire has no other advocate but it self; it
soon languisheth and forsakes it suite: Eschines advice to an inquirer after
the best course of life, was, to go to the Church willingly, to the Wars
upon necessity, but to Feasts upon no terms: what was this, but to praise the
conservation of Sadness, which in these assemblies, is for the most part
betrayed: and in the heat of Wine, meat, and company, melted, into the customs
of dissolute mirth? which made the wise Roman complain, that he never came
amongst men, but returned less man, then when he went out.

This made the Philosopher that fell a sleep at a feast, hold his tongue with
one hand, and with the other, the part that they say women love best, but not
to speak of: as the two taps, at which Mirth and Pleasure are drawn out.

But may I not seem to go too much of one hand, when proposing instructions, I
incline rather to preuentions then additions: surely if the nature of man were
so pure and simple, as it had no participation nor co^mixture with
contrarieties and repugnances, there were no way but one; and that one direct:
but as he is first in his mass, or corporial substance, the issue or
production of the 4 grand Heterogimical bodies, and after by the several and
most differing powers of his reason and will, as unlike in their likeness and
natures, as light and darkness: there being as much to shun, as to follow: I
hope I shall not err in my way, if the situation of the end proposed, draws
me sometimes about, since I undertake to conduct, not the eye, but the
understanding.

Neither will my Reader (I hope) hold himself deceived, if Sadness alone, and
by it self, only brings not in all the materials necessary to the composing
of a perfect man, and the framing a happiness to the full extent of our earthly
condition: for such an extract is not to be drawn, from a knowledge so
ouer-clowded as mine, let it suffice then and it will: (my indifferent Judge)
that it is of so much use and importance, as though with it only you cannot
make this purchase, yet without it, if it be not impossible, yet at least most
difficult, and withal, that though the soul in her reuoluings and travels,
may meet those solid considerations, that are most like her self, wherein as
in a glass she beholds her own beauties: yet are they transitory, and but the
flashes of her agitation: the habitual possession of the graces of the mind,
being to be fixed upon no body, that Sadness has not first prepared. This
made so many of the Ancients, and of those most memorable, for the excellencies
of the mind: some to throw away their wealth, others to refuse riches, the
graces of Princes, and the favor of the people: others pull out their own
eyes, and some to abandon the society of man; and even he that might truliest
be entitled, Deliciae humani generis, he that had the attribute, Socrates.
to fetch virtue from Heaven, and to place her in Cities; to bring her from the
paradise of the gods, and transplant her in the breasts of men: no doubt
embraced a wilful poverty; nay even life it self, which he was offered at the
easiest rate, he would not yet accept of, as too delicate and nice a thing, for
a worthy and heroicke spirit, to make account of. If now we enter into the
consideration of the motive that made these men shun what all the world so
earnestly pursue: what could it be but to keep these wants afoot, continually
to admonish them, of their condition, and to cut off all ways, by which mirth
or pleasure might make their approches or come to the assault.

Alexander in the excess of abundance, killed Clytus, Fabritius in his
poverty, refused the golden bribes of the Samnites; upon abundance waits mirth
and pleasure, and upon them all, the leprosies and deformities of our minds.

There is not so incorrigible a creature as man in prosperity, nor so modest
and reformed as they that Fortune has not rockt but wak't, the consequence of
which being Mirth and Sadness: behold them in their operations, and we must
reject the one, as a most dangerous poison, and embrace the other, for the most
precious preservative.

If yet I have not proved Sadness, instruction it self: yet I hope she does
not look with so disfigured a countenance, as when Opinion paints her: and
though I cannot say, she is the end of knowledge, yet I may well maintain her
the beginning: since it is Sadness only that prepares the understanding, and
makes every man, Idoneus auditor, fit to philosophize, and to be disciples in
the school of Virtue.

If now it be determined and truly, that the graces and beauties of the soul,
ought to have the place and honor, above those of the body: and the sweetness,
beauty and lovely proportion of the body, to be preferred before the effeminate
deckings, that the body does rather carry then enjoy: since it often happens,
that a foul and deformed carkase has a fair and rich wardrop: and if all
these in their original estimations, were first valued, not for their own
sakes, but as the Ambassadors of those inward qualities and excellencies, that
such complections, shapes, and proportions, inseparably fore-shew: Sadness, I
doubt not, both for her outward loveliness, and inward virtue and use, will be
allowed for an adornement, Sadness adorneth.
that does not alone please the eye, but the more judicial and intellectual
parts.

First then, though I am not ignorant, these merry companions are the most
acceptable to the most: yet not always to the best, and if they be at times
welcome to the understanding sort, Mirth not always acceptable to the best.
they are received to their tables, not counsels: and used rather for sauce
for their meat, then seasoning for their judgments: and are, as was said of
Athens, places that though many desired to be entertained in, yet few to
inhabit: from whence comes this, but that as they are adorers of mirth, they
are haters of all sad and serious considerations (...) to keep life in
laughter, the whole stream^^ (...) their wits is spent, upon the motion of
their tongues: In a word, they sacrifice their earnest to ^est, their friends
to their humor, and to present satisfactions, all the duties of humanity,
honesty, and discretion: and if so; where shall we lay hold of them, or to what
use would they serve, but to such a one, as all honest natures cannot but
scorn and disdain? whereas the sad and sober behavior makes it one way to
allowances, and if it gets not acquaintances so fast, it winnes friends faster;
and though perhaps it be not always so readily entertained, yet it is
evermore respected: and reason, since the one with his incessant motion wears
out it self, loades the ear, and loathes the eye; whereas the other, in his
reservedness, maintains his understanding, in his united vigor: and not
troubling his brain with his tongue, falls not into the disaduantages of many
words: but still holding more in his breast then upon his shoulders, is strong
enough for any assault, and prepared to make the best use of company and
conference. Surely, if behavior be of such estimation, as beauty without it is
deformed; and deformity with it is lovely, and agreeable to al eyes: if
behavior be the soul of the form, Sadness is the soul of the soul: for
such a composed settled smoothness, as distastes not to day; pleases to
morrow, and gets by continuance: no fashion wins so universally and
continually, as that which has received the true tincture of Sadness, for it
suppresseth the inconstancy, and busy turbulency of the passions and
affections: it receives nothing upon trust, or at the first sight; and
therefore is always one: neither being troubled with the floods and ebbes of
fortune: the vanity of the world, the ill employed power of greatness, nor the
fluctuary motions of the humerous multitude; or at least, if he be sensible of
their irregularities and confusions, yet his thoughts are not written in his
face: his countenance is not significant: whereas the face and disposition of
mirth ever resembles his last thoughts; and upon every touch, or taste of that
which is displeasant, and follows not the stream of his appetite, it deformes
it self, and like the Moon, is in as many changes, as his fortune: now if the
wrangling of children be troublesome, the waywardness of men must, to a
stranger, be ridiculous; and to the acquaintance odious: and consequently
Sadness a goodly ornament, that neither displeases others, deformes it self,
nor at any time passes the bounds of judgment and discretion; and though he
must, as he is man, have many thoughts to repent, yet few actions. Primum
argumentum compositae mentis existimo, posse consistere and secum morari, as it
is commonly taken for a sign of a strong estate, and a settled disposition, to
keep a certain house, and to love home: and that such men are the best, both
comforters and counselors, of their mean and needy neighbors: so is it, with
those minds that retire into their own meditations, and scatter not themselves
upon the irresolute and inconstant inuitations of opinion; being most
profitable in their examples; and most sound, in their counsels; outwardly
goodly marks of direction, for them that are ignorant in their course: and
within, most happy and safe harbors and havens for them, that either by
weather, or weakness, or any other, either suspicion or knowledge of
impediment, dare not put out into the vaste and profound mutabilities and
dangers of this Ocean of the World: if now a mole on the cheek be an ornament
to beauty; Sadness is the same to wit; and if wit, like quicksiluer, be too
nimble for it own conservation, Sadness does more then contain it: for it
refines, and fixes it: Jewels and rich apparel adorn the Possessor, and exact
from strange eyes a reverence and respect: Sadness, the grave and ever
becoming robe of judgment, represents to all understandings the venerable
account of all so adorned: if the all concealing apparel of women, that
measured by their modesty, leaves nothing for the incursions, of greedy wanton
eyes to make spoil of, and does not only proclaim their souls fairer then
their bodies, but their bodies fairer then they are: with leaving the face, eye
and hand, as a broken sentence to be perfected by imagination: Sadness does
the same; for the interior parts doubling and redoubling the perfections of
the mind, in such sort, that even fools that Nature has even hidden under
this behavior, have often escaped censure; and under title of a hidden fellow
has hidden a most empty and senseless: for who can tell the contents of a
clasped book, or inuentory, or a locked Wardrop? Now as it conceales the fool,
it illustrates the wise man. For as the Sun breaking through a cloud, lets
fall the golden tresses of his beams upon the gloomy ayery morning, after his
absence, with a much more resplendent majesty, then when continually unmasked,
he prostitutes his beauties unto every eye, and makes not only the Shepherd,
but his flock weary of his company, and seek shade and shelter to hide
themselves from his too fast fixed sight: even so the well wayed motions of the
sad behavior commands attention, and the stayednes of his carriage prepares a
consent before hearing, as due to him that lets nothing pass without due
consideration.

To conclude, if one of the greatest Philosophers determined silence, a more
excellent quality then eloquence: I have the aid of his authority, since
Sadness is the seat of silence, where she only resides in safety, and where
without all noise, trouble or tumult, she enioyes the intelligence and
contemplations of the soul: which the children of mirth cannot hear; for
their own noise: nor taste, their mouths are so furd with bodily pleasures.

And now I will appeal to the eye, if these ligniaments and features of
Sadness, be not more goodly and becoming then those of mirth: surely if they
be not more delightful, they are more contenting: the difference of which, I
refer to the Judicial, and to those that value things by their neerenesse, and
resemblance of those of Heaven.

Lastly, for government, though the world be not made of Attomes, yet the body
of man's reputation, is the concurrence of his speeches, actions and passions:
which ought to advise all men, not to neglect the least motion, either of mind
or body: lest it fastens a deformity upon all: shall we expect this from mirth?
it were in vain, and to prescribe it, were lost labor; it is composed wholly
of contrarieties: for take a quantity of idle breath, sublimated into a jest, a
proportion of laughter, some mimicke tricks, either of the face or the body,
and boil them so thoroughly in wine, that you cannot know one from another, and
you have the most received receipt of mirth: but who will undertake to give
assurance, that this inspired crew, shall not violate the dignity of men: and
so govern themselves, that shame and derision shall not have more right to
them, then they to themselves?

Ulysses drank of Circes cup, and was not transformed: the moral is, a wise
man may wash his mouth, but not quench his thirst, with pleasure: for, he that
aims only at mirth and pleasure, hits sorrow and repentance; as well because
it makes him rash and inconsiderate in his courses, when to buy mirth, he sells
all the respects and duties that he owes to inestimable virtue, and his own
preservation: as that it being to the mind, as a stoaue to the body, that so
opens the pores, as the least air gives a blow to the health, so the least
adversity or frown of fortune, deiects their minds, and lays them open,
either to a ravening fury, or a base bewayling: wherefore he that will not seal
the worst of sorrow, let him beware of deuoting himself to mirth, for they
only feel the water intolerable cold, that go into it extraordinary hot. The
Philosophers that imposed silence upon their Scholars for their first
instruction, could intend nothing else, but the settling and composing the
mind: from whence arises that habit of Sadness, that gave them power of
themselves; and withal of all things that came within the bounds of their
knowledge: if not to gain by, yet not to lose.

To what end should I produce the witness of many famous ancients, from whom
scarce a smile was ever drawn, and yet were such, as never lost oppurtunity;
that presented it self, to do others good, or themselves right: nor ever lost
that power, force, and tranquillity of their own minds, in any of Fortunes
transmutations, that is wont so to overcome the reason of men, as like
transformed creatures, there can be nothing more different then them to
themselves? Neither will I authorize my opinion, by the example of our blessed
Savior, who was never seen to laugh: nor Salomons sacred counsel, that it
was better to go to the house of mourning, then mirth, lest the worldly man,
that makes provision only for the building of his Babel, cast me off as an
unseasonable and impertinent counselor: though it shall then (gentle Reader)
insensibly, and without thy trouble prepare thee for the best work of thy
life, which is the life eternal: yet whilst thou will be attentive to thy
temporal employments, it is also of most effectual importance.

Desire thou to be reputed wise? It is her visiblest form; not to be
importuned with vain and idle company? they fear Sadness too much to follow
thee.

To be the safe Cabinet of thy own and thy friends secrets? Sadness is the
parent of silence, silence of secrecy.

To be temperate? where Sadness is Porter, few vain desires are admitted.

Not to be precipitate in thy actions? Where Sadness keeps the lists of
consideration, always clear and free, from the intrusions of passion, the
soul cannot but govern all things by the regular and judicial power of
reason, as she that knows time call to consultations, shuts out repentance.

In a word, if there be any way to be troad in by our feet of clay, we are out
of the reach of Fortune, out of the power of our passions, and in the full
possession of our selves, we may live in a continual calm: where from the
height of a clear and impregnable judgment, we may safely and insensibly
behold the world, by this time so far under us, as all such vain desires, as
had wont to make us suitors and followers to her, have lost sight of their
inamored objects, it is by the way of Sadness: who does not alone enrich us by
that it brings, but preserues us so by keeping out all inordinate appetites,
distempered affections, and those humors of blood and opinion, who where they
are favored, do usually destroy and expel, not only all honest and virtuous
actions, but even the very thoughts that do but seem to be well affected.

Thus have I (good Reader) presented to thy acquaintance the sweetest, and best
conditioned companion of the life of man, which if you will but believe upon
trial, I desire no more: be not seduced by opinion, and thou may be as
happy as this world can make thee: for though the outward power makes men
great, yet is the inward, that makes men virtuous, and virtue only that
produces a happiness, that can endure the test of all times and changes.

Neither must I omit to answer them that would hide their base choice in the
confusion of words, and so will have their mirth to be joy; but he is worse
then blind that knows them not a sunder, mirth being rather an apish
unquietness, then a solid contentment: besides, it lives not of it self, it
depends upon fortune, upon time, health, and many outward accidents; and lives
but upon borrowing, whereas joy being as the shadow of virtue, or the effect of
the inward and inseparable cause of a good life, is never from home, never in a
cloud, never subject to alteration, always one, and therefore not only
always happy, but therefore happiness it self: and yet to make the
difference more apparent, behold their pictures drawn by two excellent
Masters, res seuera est verum gaudium, which if Sadness resembles not more
lively then mirth, let your judgment determine, and now for mirth, I am sure
this was made, it is so like her, risu inepto, res ineptior nulla est; if you
define mirth without laughing, you speak of somewhat else, and leave your
errand behind you, but it has been so often determined, that they are so far
from all one, as they are not so much as alike: as further to labor in so
manifest a truth, will rather obscure, then inlighten it.

I will then include this question in this definitive sentence, falso de
laetitia opinantur siquidem ab vtrisque gaudio scilicet and natura, diuersa
est, it has not only lost the challenge to joy, but to nature; he then that
drew man within the compass of animal risibile, was rather a confessor to good
companions, then a wise survey or of the little world of man.

And now to conclude, if thou have but Melancholy enough to suspend thy
opinion, whatsoever thou art, thou have me in the power of thy censure: I doubt
not but you shall be beholding to your judgment, to free me from the heresy
of Paradoxes.

If some other think, that I have restrained the liberty of man, in commending
Sadness unto him: let him know, I have not determined it the end, but the way
only; an entry or passage, that of the other side, has a world much more
spacious and pleasant, then that of this side, comprehended by mirth: which is
little, poor and transitory: if yet there be some that will bring this
evidence for their liberty, Laetitia tuuenem, fraus decet tristis senem, it is
but like a license to eat flesh in Lent, for them that are weak and sickly;
or like a law that prohibited all persons to wear gay clothes, and Jewels,
but players and curtisans: which was then taken for a mark of scorn, not for
a privilege of grace and advantage: which if they shall please to take so too,
they shall have the less to answer for, and I shall neither have lost my
labor, nor their favor: if not, I must yet challenge the allowance of the
wisest, which are the oldest, who if they should yield to an extreme, would
rather ratify that Philosopher that ever wept, then this that took no more
pity of himself, and of the madness of mankind, then to spend his life in
laughter.

FINIS.
THE PRAISE OF the Emperor Julian the APOSTATA: His Princely virtues, and
final Apostacy.
I Dare not affirm him temperate, that shuns surfets; nor him grave, that
despises lightness; nor him valiant, that loves to converse with danger: It
is no precious thing, my opinion, and yet I am afraid to spend it: let
Physicians, a Gods name, be thought trim fellows for determining of the lives
of men, as if they had come yesterday from the Fates; for my part, except I may
have leave to pass through the inside of them, I can say nothing: for all
these are no more a kin to Virtue, then baseness may challenge of Nobility,
because their names sound alike: it being not Temperance, not gravity, not
Fortitude; except the cause that moves these effects, be virtues. The World
affoords not a more apt example then this Emperor, the History of whose life
is full of so many excellent things, as hardly he that is a votary against the
world, and has nothing to think of, but keeping his vow, may equal him in
all these outward apparances, that favorable judgments call the way to
heaven; but in the depth of impiety; again, not the most reprobate, His
tempera^ce.
comparable: yet was he so temperate, as he never surfeted nor vometed oftener,
then he was made Caesar, and that of cheese: in the prouocations of the flesh
none chaster, His chastity and thrift.
no unthrift of his treasure, and time, in public sports, a common disease of
greatness: Not given to pleasure.
no lascivious pleasure did rust and consume his time, so covetous was he of
it, as the very nights he divided into upholding his body, the bettering his
mind, the serving his country; he needed not Alexanders ball of metal to
awake him, for the thinness of his diet required not much sleep, His moderate
diet.
whereas the other was a good fellow, and gave his hot constitution leave to
lead him to banquets and quaffings. His valor.
For his valor, ask all the Histories of his time, and you shall find they
make so great a noise about no body: but all these help him not, so
irreligious a heart possessed them, proceeding most of them out of his education,
some from his nature, none from virtue: how justly then may we suspect our
opinions of men that carry the form of the exactest lives? Me thinks it were
well, if they were let alone until the next world: for it is to be doubted,
whether praises be not like rain that increases weeds, as well as nourishes
the corn: for it begets Hypocrites, and for the truly virtuous, they neither
care for it, nor need it: if all men were of my mind, they that are good, and
they that never came nearer then a desire to be thought so; should shortly be
discerned one from another: for his soft pacing, his grave attire, and constant
countenance, shall not work a whit upon me, no, not a speech well read, with
the head and the fingers finely placed; no, not the naming vice in choler, and
putting off his Hatt when virtue is called; no, not the defying the World, nor
challenging the combat of concupiscence: these are but words of course, but
promises, but nothing: Promittas facito, quid enim promittere laedit?
pollicitis dives, quilibetiesse potest: But this it is to write without the
hope of gaining by a Mecaenas, or the ambition of method; my matter, my style,
hang disiointed, and vnsemented, neither of them keeps their place, but
gallops, and trots and ambles; the reason, I never gave Tully an hour for any
of his Rethorike: I send not my words awooing, I care not, so they can get to
their iournies end, though they cannot caper, nor dance: there is a grace in
the sound of words, but it is not mine, I give my thoughts clothes suddenly,
and so fit, that they may be understood; but whether they be in fashion and well
shaped, is not my care: I am of too rude a nature to be so nice, and mine ears
are so harsh, that I could never yet understand the sweetness of the sound of
opinion; but to that I take in hand.

First, let me not be condemned for my Subject: he was an ill man, that was his
loss, but this ill was only ill at the iourneyes end; for most of his actions
were good here, and had been good for ever, if they had not served an ill
master: but at the worst, Virtue is not so proud as not to extract what may be
made good, out of ill for there is a spirit in vice, that being cunningly
drawn out, will serve even the best: so full it is of a quick and peircing
vigor: he has a poor Library to behold, that reads only the good; let him
turn over all, that desires to be profound; let him earne Virtue with digging
it out of vice, and he will keep it the better: let him fetch it out of the
entrals of ill, that will glory of his conquest; from those soft ministers of
the mind, the Arts which make the soul read to the body, and make practice but
a slight, through the minds foreknowledge.

This Prince came to the managing Arms, not with such a people whose
weakness was fit to nourish a nouice, but with those fierce and warlike; yet
was he victorious, and made those that were wont to be feared, fear: Qui alijs
terrore esse consueuerat, ipsum sibi timere coegit: who allows not of such an
excellent beginning? When I hear of any great Soldier, I ask his age, when
if old, it takes away mine admiration; for upon a wise minority I look with
greatest affection: But here comes a privy token to know intents by, Sed haec
laus etiam miserrima ambitionis labe contaminata est, cum se Augustum salutari
voluit: so greedy are those minds that intend only to serve their own turn;
no sooner have they attained to an atchieuement commendable, but they enforce
praises out of the mouths of men; they will swagger for titles and respect;
yea, it becomes Lord, even of themselves; for reason of more weight, that in
another man's case should have prevailed, with the eyes of ambition seems
dwarfish, weak, and little. That wise and warlike servant to the kingdom of
Spain, The Duke of Alua.
the Duke of Alua, has much of his glory dusked, by an Historian, that relates
the Don Antonio Prior of Crato, commonly called the King of Portugal.
Prior of Crato would have come to a good composition: but he would not hear
of it, because it could not have bin then said, he conquered Portugal with the
sword: of such a value were a few idle words, as his masters profit and his own
truth were thought things meet to give place to this wind, to this nothing:
But behold how Fortune sometimes plays the same part that wisdom does, and
brings a succesfull end to false beginnings: Vnde bellum civil atrocissimum
esset consecutum, nisi mors pene repentina constantium ante sustulisset: thus
does that blind guide make arguments to overthrow judgment: thus upon the
death of Alexander de medicis, Cosimo was inthroned, being scarce out of the
down of his childhood, without much pain or study, that had cost his
predecessors much trouble, much care: so does it please the divine wisdom, to
demonstrate to mortal eyes their impotency; for it is he, there is no
fortune, it is he that makes those things that seem to have idle beginnings,
prove profitable at the end. Both these examples, though in some things
different, yet agree in the demonstrating: those things that we understand
not, and therefore call chances, have often as fair an end as things proposed;
which is the will of heaven to teach us earthlings, that our purposes cannot go
whither they are commanded, without his pleasure. At his Coronation, His
Coronation.
and after, he seemed modestly to mislike his greatness, the common trick of
ambition, who still desires to seem careless of what he chiefly thirsts
after; if it be not so, it is as with us all, that like those things that are
farthest off: he used often to protest, Nihil se amplius assecutum, quam vt
occupatior interiret: a speech that, me thinks, draws the nature of his place
lively, and withal, the happiness of his place; for there cannot be a more
noble state, then that which perforce bids us to be industrious and busy; a
more worthy business can there not be, then the employment of a Prince: he
feels not death that dies thus, he has other business, then to breed
thoughts of terror; and for them that find greatness, and yet make death
terrible, it comes from the abuse of their authority: for they truly using it,
are insensible of smart, and fear not death, nor his worst countenance.

After his possession of the Empire, he invaded Persia, drawn the more
willingly, by a persuasion, that his body had gotten Alexander his soul, and
should have his success. Good Lord, into what uncertain and ridiculous
imaginations are they led, that have not the anchor-hold of Religion! Went it
no further, then this, it were most precious, for it keeps our thoughts in
good order, which otherwise would make us all as wild as madmen: for we bred
Monsters and misshapen things in our brain, which did not the conscience
reduce into fashion (which conscience is the child of Divinity) we should not
touch one another for fear of breaking: but sometime such a persuasion
carries higher and handsomer then ever meant, enforcing imitation. I knew once
a fellow, mean enough, and as meanly qualited, being said to be like a great
man, began to engender stirring thoughts, of spirit, of well doing, and, at the
last, arrived at the pitch of an indifferent worthy fellow; but within a while
this must be cast off. It is not amiss at the first to give children plummes
for learning their lesson, but afterward they must love learning for
knowledges sake, these for virtues. Of the happiness of his perfections, and
then of his imperfections: his temperance His temperance.
carried with it a number of commodities; for besides health, it maintained the
strength and viuacitie of his spirit, which the abundance of eating and
drinking is wont to quench; at least kill: his sleeps were thereby less (the
drowner of the spirits) being the image of death, the maker of the
understanding dull, His moderate sleep.
and senseless: but the best quality is the cooling of lust, which banqueting
and excess is wont to kindle in the body, and the body to fire the mind; but
this abstinence brings the other under, and curbes lust, which usually melts
away, and so becomes the maintainer of the life of man. His example is not of
the least consequence, the life of the Prince being the book of the subject,
The Princes example, the subjects book.

nor in truth is it sufficient, for I think they were lent him to do others
good with, not himself hurt: provident in spending his treasure, parcimonious
of his time, both strengtheners of himself, for by the first, he comes not to
need others, by the last not to complain of time, for they live the shortest
(though most years) that mispend it: a lamentable thing, even worse then
mortality, for this death is worse then that: a great means of this, was the
custom of delighting the people, His delighting the people.
and of honoring their gods with sundry public sports; and what might be the
reason besides ignorance, in the Roman State upholding these, I can but guess;
it might be with their Co^minalty, as with our little children, who if not
feed with sports will grow wayward and cry, so ticklish are popular States,
where it is but a step from the best to the worst, that if they be not kept
busy, they will mutiny and grow into mislikes; to do well they must be
appointed their very thoughts, with feeding them with light stuff, far from
the matter. Wherefore, if in no other respect, Monarchike government best.
the Monarchy is to be honored as the Prince of government, and especially
those of succession, where the ambitious and rebellious nature has not so much
to work upon, the people being ever most affectionate to the blood Royal, and
God having expressly prohibited the using violence to his Anointed: the secret
meaning of these sports was best known to the Romans, but of the diseases of
them I have noted. 2. Diseases in the Roman sports. The first disease.
2. In the time of Nero, and both of them me thinks likely to follow: The one
of them was, when the Procurators, Proconsulls, or other Magistrates, had
abused the authority of their places, with pilling and taxing the subjects of
the Empire, they came to Rome and made their peace, with giving the people the
sight of sword-plaiers, or some such things. Here is the Prohibition: Edixit
Caesar ne quis Magistratus, aut Procurator, qui Prouinciam obtinert spectaculum
gladietorum, aut ferarum, aut quod aliud ludicrum aederet; this is the
medicine, the disease follows: Nam ante non minus tali largitione, quam
corripiendis pecunijs subiectos affligebant, dum quae libidine deliquerant,
ambitu propugnant: It is a circumspection most behouefull for the Magistrate,
to take away the means of getting these keys to open the peoples heart with,
which is to be certainliest performed, with stopping all springs, that would
feed them, but the fountain of chief authority; for otherwise, they will like
tame birds, readily come to the call of him that gives them meat. The other
was, The second disease.
how apt the celebrations were to nourish a lascivious Prince, showing and
directing the way to softness, and excess: which is well approved by this
Empire of liberty and festiualls, and the ancient Laconian strictness, where
there was never riotous Prince; in the other, every second or third Emperor a
Monster: Power in a wanton hand ruinates his charge.
there is not a more dangerous thing then power in a wanto^ hand, which every
way ruinates his charge; for if it live to grow old, it becomes tyranny, in
the mean time corrupts himself and Commonwealth: the natural man loving
bodily pleasures, when cherished by the life of a lascivious Prince, the nature
of it is doubled. Est vulgus cupiens voluptatum, and si eo Princeps trahat
laetum: They are well contented with such a Governor, alas, their countenances
are unfit guides for a Statesman; me thinks they are like the sense of taste,
that never considers the operation, but taste: fair otherwise was this
Prince, which he lays to his education, though I think Nature had made him of
too rough a mould to be carried with such lightness; yet might it be his
familiarity with letters, which carries the mind so high, as most other things
appear base and contemptible; this speech is the child of such a mind, turpe
esse sapienti, cum habeat animam, captare lauds ex corpore: it is a speech
worthy of the worthiest mouth, and proclaims to the ambitious where to buy

when age begins to decline a body, it is time to leave it: he has spent his

the game that the devil plays at fast and loose with man, but the abuse of
knowledge, the disease of the finest metals, deserves more pity; of all the
great troops that go this way, I find few arrived at an indifferent
commendation; I cannot tell, they are cut off either by pride, vanity, or
contempt; this is the cousenage of partiality; do you think there is such an
excellency in having slubbered an Aristotle? Fie, no. If you understood
Aristotle, you might be bettered; there is not such a virtue in genus and

This disease is to be known by separating his customs from the world, by an
eye full of disdain, by a countenance borrowed from the picture of some old

IVLIANS Dialogue of the Caesar's.
His Dialogue of the Caesar's.
I Desire to have the picture of famous men by mine ear not mine eye, I
prefer the Historian, before the Painter, I get nothing by the fashion of his
face, but by the knowledge of his life: the pen is the best pensell, which
draws the mind, the other, that tells you the stature and proportion of the
body may delight, not profit; give me therefore their works; if writers; if not,
their lives written by others: thus think I of books (the issue of our minds)
all which are not without some profit, for there is no soul altogether barren,
but especially those that are able, and do write in earnest, those bind the
whole world to them, for they dissolve their spirits, to make theirs more
precious, and by the help of time have made that excellent cordial, that the
soul disgesting may recover, and be preserved against our natural disease
ignorance. I sucked not long enough of my Schoolmasters to prove a Commentor,
The Authors digression of himself.
I cannot fetch words from their swaddling bands, nor make them interpret the
quality of the things known by them, I tract them not, nor set a brand of them
when I meet them, nor compare the words of one Author with another: if I can
make joining work of the matter, I go contented, for I work not for words:
and thus nature has framed me, and I will not go to surgery for an
alteration; for me thinks it becomes a gentle spirit well, to leave the dross
and fly to the matter, he writes not under the hard restraint of fear or
gain, but gallantly gives the World the travels of his mind, and it is
gallantly, for a Mercinary liberallist is in little better state then a
Renegado: let him then that courts his censurers with sweet titles for fear of
bitterness, or him that sends his book of a voyage in hope of gain, tend
this cutting up words and such stuff: but he that writes so purely as to want
these, let him run into things of worth, and fetch secrets out of the entrals
of actions: I have read History, but they seldom do any more then make the
times confess; some upon History, most simple, some better, others dangerous;
but this Dialogue has of the virtue of both, and little of their idleness, full
of excellent observation, and withal quick: so well did the stomak of mine
understanding like it, that she boiled longer then ordinary, and here is the
digestion.

It is not my manner to be busy about the manner of the feast, the place, nor
other circumstances, let it suffice the Author makes Romulus inuit his
successors to a feast, at whose entrance Sylenus, Jupiters buffone hits them
where they were left unarmed by Virtue.

I promise neither method nor antiquity; but after my fashion thus: Julius
Caesar's entrance.
First Julius Caesar enters, of whom Sylenus bids Jupiter beware, lest he plots
his deposing; for he is (says he) great and fair; thus dangerous is the
neighborhood of Ambition: Caesar's ambition.
for all other affections that are wont to maintain amity are not here; for
Ambition loves nothing but it self, nor pitties, nor regards: so both
commending his reason and passion to be slaves to this humor is good only
for that, to all other dangerous. Besides the humor, he had two instruments
belonging to it, he was great and fair; alas, what account should we make of
our reason? since she suffers the vainest occasions to beget the seriousest
purposes. Is it not pitiful that Valor should be beholding to the Drum and
Trumpet, and flying of the colors and the glittering of Armor? Yet is it, and
I think few spirits, but amongst the rest have found these the inflamer of
courage: no less absurd is the election of a Magistrate by his beauty; Not
good to elect a Magistrate for his beauty.
yet is it common for that Whorish affection to prevail, the which ranked with
this greatness ouercomming sufficiency, when men whose evidence lies in their
titles; shall possess places where wisdom is behoueful, and patrias lauds
sentiat esse suas. Of al which there is to be noted the baseness of our
choice, the sluggishnesse of our reason, for not forbidding the banes. And
lastly, how they throw themselves into the hands of Fortune, with managing
these high things so basely. In the description of Octauius entrance, Octauius
entrance.
I note Poetries power, he makes him appear in diverse colors, which, me
thinks, His Poetry, and Policy.
does here more handsomely then the plain truth: for it had not bin so fit to
have said, Policy suits his form like the occasion, and alters as it alters:
of him, Sylenus, Papae, quam varium hoc animal, such must be policy, for his
trade is with the diverse dispositions of man, and according to them must be
diverse.

Then Tiberius with a grave and cruel countenance, Tiberius entrance.
who, he after paints full of scarres and scabbes, as testimonies of his
tyranny and intemperance, to whom Sylenus, Long alius mihi nunc, quam ante
videres: His tyranny and intemperance.
But, me thinks, his Verse is not rightly applied, for Tyrants are ever
deformed, mary, fear in their lives makes it inward, after their deaths
apparent; thus pretily does time mock mortality, first tying one party, and
suffering the other to beat them, then the losed, tied, and the tied losed:
thus tyranny and subjection: tyranny as long as it lasts buffets his
underlings, but death at last gives the loser a time of revenge, when he
wounds their memories, without fear or danger.

After Silenus assaults his abominable life in the Island Caprea, in no life do
the blemishes of life appear so visibly as in Princes, whose height and power,
as it may do much, so is it most observed. I wonder he lets him escape for
Seianus, his doting upon whom, was much more impardonable then the simple
Claudius, because the former professed craft, the other always governed by
smocks and slaves.

At Claudius entrance Claudius entrance.
he repeats a Comedy, and after complains of Romulus, for suffering him to

Palantus, and his wife Messalina: thus it happens with them that bear the
names of great places, and lay their execution upon others: thus with them that
are so tender hearted as to be led by others: thus have I often observed
servile conditions to undermine their masters, there being great loss in
granting to the will of intercessors, for the gift is theirs, the thanks
another; wherefore it is the duty of discretion to reserve to themselves the
occasion of importance, and he that gives, to be unknown himself to him that
he gives. Now comes Nero and his harp: Neroes entrance delighting with playing
on the harp.
nothing is so fast tied to us as our faults, we are never mentioned without
them, they hackney our names to death, and never leave spurring them till they
have killed them. This man, says Silenus imitates Apollo, in the mean time
behold his misshapen course, that destinated to an Empire, pursues the faculty
of a Musician: I never see any that profess skill in many things: in these hie
matters much less; one being enough for one: There follows a troop together,
though Vindex shows the suppression of tyranny, is behouefull to the
commonwealth, Galba.

fortune, being thought fit for an Empire whilst private, when an Emperor,
unworthy, and ended his slaves slave.

Otho.
Otho might have been examined about the government of Lucitania, whether he
possessed not that, to be dispossessed of Popaea. Vitellius.
For Vitellius let Jupiter look his cheer be good, or else his palate will
purse his host: Galba shows the difference between opinion and trial, and
withal that there is no greater enemy to praise then expectation: Otho, that
it is not impossible to possess great places for vilde causes: Vitellius that
there is nothing that discouers a lascivious mind so clearly, as power and
authority. Vespasian Vespasian.
follows a Prince that Sylenus could find no fault with, but it seems, he
had not read Dion, who relates the time of his whores death: Given to women.
here is the odds of being near an Emperor, for a thousand better
deserving women died in those times without mention: he says he delighted much
in her, neither becoming his age, office, nor wisdom, but I find none
without some ayle or other.

It had been a good time for Sylenus, to have asked this, what it was he
repented him of, whether it were his loving his brothers wife to wed, or not,
hating his brother enough, or else his fearing the people, more then loving
Berenice. Domitian Domitian. His cruelty.

Sylenus gives Jupiter warning to look to Ganimedes: he might also have
bidden him be careful of his Nectar; for he loved his lector as well as boys.
The grave fellow following must be in Aurelius, Aurelius.
according to my guess a fellow meeter to have made a private man then a

one of his commendations was his sufferance: a good pretty praise for a
subject, but nothing fit for a Prince, he was also pitiful, a procurer of
love: but what of that, love thus obtained, is too familiar a Virtue for an
Emperor. Pertinax bought his regalitie at a dear rate, his greatest fault was
his ill husbandry, for as trees in their first growth are defended by briars,
which afterward uncut up, overthrow the flourishing of the tree; so an
unlawful elected Prince, seldom escapes pluling down, by those that set him
up; for covetousness being the cause of their combination, nothing can serve
their insatiable desires, nor be thought a sufficient recompense: ask Laetus
else by the fortune of Plautianus. Here comes Seuerus Seuerus.

Comparison between Alexander and Caesar.
NOw to the comparison between Alexander and Caesar: Caesar loved a wench, as
well as Alexander wine, both faults, but which most dangerous disputable, they
both impair the understanding, the one with laying too much upon the head, the
other with taking too much from the head: wine drownes reason, lust prefers his
wench before the World: in wine Alexander killed Clytus, Caesar proclaims love
letters in the Senate: both breaches likely to waste authority, but which of
them most dangerous, I leave to the censurers, both of them doubtless full of
danger, for they are the privy gates, whereat Conspirators get entrance. More
early did Alexander begin to busy fame, but that was his fortune. Caesar more
worthily, if not at last unworthily; for, he overthrew the hinderance of a
mean state, and made way through the obscurity of his birth, which he
confesses difficult. Difficilius se principem ciuitatis a primo ordine in
secundum, quam a secundo in nouissimum detrudi; how he did this deserves note:
I find all his actions, even his youngest, to be carried with great majesty,
and an intent to lay the foundation of a reverend opinion of him in the hearts
of men; his behavior amongst the Pirates was one, the refusing the friendship
of Lepidus another, he being the author of restoring the Tribunes office: these
for example, upon which time will not suffer me to work my will, the wise
obseruer may for me, and gain by it. Alexander was not idle in his child's age,
his managing Bucephalus, argued courage; his use of Ambassadors, wisdom; the
denying to run without Kings, majesty: but these were beautified with being
the actions of a Prince, for they would not become Caesar half so well,
because a private man; that Caesar wept at the sight of Alexanders picture, is
no advantage, for he had the ods of him by birth: then both were happy, in not
having the first growth of their endeavors, ouer-driped by men already great;
Greece at this time, not having any great Soldier. Caesar in his first
Consulship, being matched with a heavy fellow, that not able to keep way with
his swiftness, and strength of his spirit, gave him leave to manage all
matters alone, whereupon his two names served for the names of both the
Consuls, Nonnulli vrbanoru^ cum quid per iocum testandi gratia signarent, non
Caesare and Bibulo, sed Iulio and Caesare Consule actum scriberent: they tried
how the world would like their authorities, by two different means. Alexander
an absolute Prince invaded Greece, by which he made them understand that his
youth deserved not contempt, and brought them to be assistants in the wars
against Persia. Caesar lower, but no less politikely, he took the occasion of
his daughters death, and in an office of affection presented the people with
pleasures and novelties: munus populo aepulumque pronuntiauit in filiae
memoriam, quod ante eum nemo fecit; this was a taste of their likings, a love
letter of an Amorist, which if taken, more will be taken: Caesar seems in the
difficulty of their conquests the worthier, no nation of Alexanders being
comparable, either to the Gauls or Heluetians, but in the vpshot alike, both
the Persian and Pompey being greater in reputation then truth: they did well,
as long as they went with the tide: it was the generation long before spent,
that made the Persian diadem shine with Imperial title, the vigor of
necessity, that is wont to move magnanimity, was taken away, and now left an
ouerflowing of fortune, which makes men degenerate and become slothful. Pompey
became great by the travels of Lucullus and others; neither his managing the
civil wars was as it should be, nor his adversity rightly managed; so that, me
thinks, beholding him, I behold nothing but a bubble of fortunes: for their
particular valors, they were both valiant, in their military discipline, they
differed, which might be by the difference of their adversaries, nature and
country: in the special point of Arms they agreed, to encounter the hearts of
men, as well as bodies. Therefore did Alexander deny Parmenio the inuading his
enemies by night, answering the conquests of their hearts generally, not of a
particular army was the way: the Empire of Persia being abundant in men, could
never have bin overcome, if their discourse could have laid the Macedonian
co^quests upon any accident, but then vanquished, when fear should make them
superstitiously add, to the valor of their enemies, and think basely of their
own strengths: not thus, but to the same purpose, Caesar never misliked the
multitude of his enemies, difficulty being ever a spur to his actions. That
humor that Caesar possessed his Soldiers with, at the scorning life at the hands
of Caesar's enemies, I find not in Alexanders, yet had he one of the chief
instigators, the being still a Conqueror; for had Caesar sometimes lost, they
would have grown weary. This branch came first from the root of success,
seconded by some gallant spirits of Caesar's side, emulated by their followers,
rewarded by Caesar; both held the hearts of the soldiers by liberality, the
only means to make them apt for great matters, and his means that attempts
great matters, that which we call the common good, this is a chief limb of,
the engrossing which alienates the hearts of subjects more then any thing, and
with those natures that must feel the effects of virtue, with their hand: no
doubt liberality makes them daring, the contrary, Cowards: Alexander maintained
this honestest, thanks to his Patrimony: for a spirit that aims at so great
matters, cannot determine those things dishonest that are any thing available.
Suetonius says of Caesar, Vrbes diruit saepius ob praedam quam delictum, an
impardonable fault, for though fury, smart, or rapine may carry the common
Soldier past the bounds of reason; yet should the Generals mind be still one,
and behold nothing with so much love as justice, but this was the violence of
Ambition, who dares displease right, then her assistants. Caesar, after his
victories, used to give his soldiers an accustomed liberty, a president for
all the success dangerous, for of all rewards and encouragements, liberty is
the most dangerous to the giver. Contrariwise, Alexander then curbed his
Soldiers, doubting insolency, the destinate disease of success, which he did
by giving education to the Persian youth, and after employing them, a design
full of wisdom, for his conquests having laid all things at her feet, they
had no need of his direction, but he of their loyalties, which had they found,
and found before his possession of other strengths, doubtless they would have
made him their slave, that counted himself Monarch of the World: but this I
find it disco^modious, to rely upon one assistant, for two are not so likely to
fail as one; and to say truth, both will be the more true, because they are
two. Equally did they subject their bodies to raise their reputations, they
knew the force of example, and restrained appetite for honors sake. Alexander
would not add to the thirst of his companions, with the quenching of his own.
Caesar in a straight lodging gave his friends the house, and lay himself in the
air; I cannot say in the cold, for he that is wrapped in the fiery thoughts of
ambition, cannot feel heat nor cold, nor any of these distemperatures: it is
idleness that betraies us to the opinion of aches and infirmities; for he that
imploies his mind, carries his body about without feeling the burden: the
use of these is an excellent remedy against envy, mean fortunes thinking
greatness, loves greatness to nourish delicacy; but this is disproued by
partaking with their extremities. Both entertained a sweetness of nature in
bewayling the misery or death of their enemies, which, whether it came from the
grounds of clemency, or otherwise to wrap some other purpose in, is hardly to
be discerned, for there is no such counterfaiter to the life, as an aspiring
disposition: Thus Caesar sat up the statues of Silla and Pompey; thus
Alexander kindly and honestly entertained the wife and mother of Darius: Caesar
took to mercy the relikes of Pompeys overthrown Army: Alexander suffered the
mother of Darius to solemnize the burials of his slain enemies, which
compassion is the only balm to heal up the wound of revenge. Lastly, Caesar
wept at the sight of Pompeys head: and Alexander sharply executed the murderer
of Darius; In the first, I see how pretily dissimulation can apply her self
sometimes; for surely Caesar felt no remorse in the hardness of his labors,
such thoughts attend decayed estates, not the summer of fortune. In the other,
one death serves two turns, for death rewarded him, and death mitigated the
rancor, likely to spring out of the ashes of Darius. About conspiracies,
Alexander spoke as Caesar thought, Satius est, alieno me mori scelere, quam
metu meo, they might have lived longer, if they had been of another mind; yet
I think they chose well, for they chose the easiest: for fear runs division
upon death, every thought being an instrument of torment, at the end they meet
in the last course of greatness: Alexander was a King, and would needs be a
god: Caesar, because not a King, a King; thus do the baits of fortune coozen
us, and stuff us with monstrous and unnatural thoughts; they dyed both violent
deaths, the end of violent ambition: for who mislikes not that one should
possess so much of honor, fame and dominion as would serve many?

Octauius comes again, whose beginning to speak, resembles his life, busy in
the separating envy and greatness, which he did by giving every state a taste
of his government: by turns they felt it all, even the meanest and youngest,
the surest strengthener of authority: only this Prince gave occasion leave to
choose, which was to be entertained of peace or wars: an excellent temper, the
which many of his Predecessors and Successors had lost by, whiles they regarded
not which was most fit for their Countries, but which was most fitting their
natures: it were too long to touch all the particulars of his life; let it
suffice, they all tended to settle the troubled estate of his time, the
testimonies of dishonor that the Romans suffered under Crassus and Anthony,
by the hands of the Parthians, he solued, as much as the restoring the military
ornaments, arested by the Victors might, which witnesses wisdom is a more
prevailing assister then strength; he enforced all the Knights of Rome, to
yield an account of their lives, an ordinance, look on which side you will,
full of health, for idleness brings barrenness; his Epistle to his adopted
son illustrates another l^mbe of his wisdom: Noli in hac re nimium
indignari, quenquam esse qui de me male loquatur, etc. These ill speakers are
rather troublesome then dangerous, an humor arising rather out of some light
passion or wanton gadding of the tongue, then from malice; who is more silent,
more full of poison; over those care, but over the other, neglect is the best
medicine: he refused the name of Dictator, though his authority far exceeded
it, the only course to make greatness stand firmly; for by the common eye,
names are more plainly seen, then executions, which silently enjoy a more
ample and safe rule, then those that make their titles march before their
power. Our Dialoguist omits some, and I some.

Traiane speaks next, a Prince full of merits; especially in his warlike
actions, but me thinks it was to the same end, that he made war upon a
Country: sed reuera id bellum suscepit adductus gloriae cupiditate; it often
falls out thus, and as often that our dispositions without any great pains
give us pretty graces: therefore say I, a young man not covetous, and an old
man no lecher, deserves neither thanks nor marvel, but their exchange does
well, come they from what cause they will, they are well; he was an excellent
Prince, and that title his subjects gave him, optimus cognominatus est, he
deserved it for he abstained as much from depriving his subjects from their
goods, as from unlawful slaughters, both the one and the other, the maine
virtues of a Prince, for to pill them, is no less horrible, then the tutor of
an Infant to betray his charge, the other is bloody, which though their
ielosies think the way of freedom, they are deceived; for an unjust death
raises ten enemies out of one: Non ei vnquam accidit (quod ^uenire in
huiusmodi solet) vt millites feroces se and insolentes praebuerint, as great a
praise as memory can give a Commander; for nothing is so sure an evidence of a
wise man, as to bring his soldiers to fetch all their determinations from him,
and not to let them entertain insolency, when victors; nor baseness, when
vanquished; but still to read his will, and to hold that will a law: he
carefully visited the wounded, honorably buried the dead, marched on foot
with them, suffered part of their extremities. I like this better then the
saluting them commilitones: suffer with them, give them, care for them; but no
fellows, nor companions; these words kill all the actions of greatness, of
commiseration, of pity, with contempt; for never can one man play two parts
well, you cannot be their Judge and companion; for this equality takes away
the regard of your sentence: love them, but do not play with them.

Marcus enters, a slow wise fellow, whose opinion was; non decere Imperatorem,
propere quicquam agere: I like consideration well, but not to stick fast upon
a design; sure he was naturally a dull flegmaticke fellow; and so was honest
whether he would or no, he says little in this Dialogue, and little is said to
him; but only he was a wise man, because he knew when to speak, and when to
hold his peace, which is wisdom, but the lowest form of wisdom: for the
highest is, when to do and not to do. Post hunc Constantium vt diceret,
admonuerunt; under this Prince things of note were done; but not by him: thus
search the divine natures into men's actions, the strength of whose sight, is
neither to be deceived, nor corrupted; he rooted out two Tyrants, not he but
himself the first, being weak and slothful, two diseases that make the thus
diseased, incapable of great matters; the other, being the impediment of
fortune, had the impediment of age, a heavy clogge and the opposite to
expedition: both of them had both the mislike of God and men, and would have
ruined themselves without help: he was subject to delicacy and luxury, which
being vices vncounteruailed with virtue, made him rejected of the gods, and
banished into the orb of the Moon: the Author thinks he enforced not enough
how behouefull these wars were to the world, rooting out Tyrants, (the curse
of mankind) where Caesar and others made their ambition destroy their
Countrymen, and subvert their Commonwealths; the rest, or at least many of
them, picking quarrels with their neighbors to feed their own insatiable
appetite: Si quis sinus obditus vltra, si qua foret tellus quae fuluum mittere
aurum, hostis erat; but others faults mend not his, and perhaps it was his
enemies that made his quarrel good, for be they never so worthy, ambitious
Princes will find causes to be troublesome.
