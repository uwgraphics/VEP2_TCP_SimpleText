O Lord our God, most gracious and most glorious, which after long patience of
the former times of ignorance, in these last days by the hand of thy
faithful servants, the Magistrates and Ministers in diverse Countries, have
removed the vineyarde of thy Church out of that spiritual Egypt, the kingdom
of Antechrist, and have planted it with most precious Vines, even with sundry
great and famous Churches in the Gospel of thy Son, which thou have caused
to take root and to fill the earth, to spread their boughs at length, and
their branches a far off. Thou O Lord know, how since the very first
beginning of this thy great work, the wild Boares of Rome, with other like
mighty beasts of that field, have by all means endeavored to break through
the bounds, and to pull up the fences which with thine own right hand thou
had made for them: not only to lay open their grapes, for all men's
plucking, but also by destroying the Keepers, utterly to root and turn up thy
whole vineyard. Specially at this time thou seeest O Lord, how greatly thy
enemies do stir, and how those that hate thee and thy Church, do bear
their heads aloft. For the Pope, and popish states of Italy, with Phillip of
Spain, the Duke of Parma, Sauoy, and Loraine, and the traiterous Leagors of
France, have all bended and confederate themselves against thy people,
plotting and counsayling together against thy secret ones, how either by power
or by treachery they may destroy them, that there be no more a Church: and that
from henceforth, the name of Protestants be not spoken of upon earth. But thou
O Lord God of our salvation, which sauest all those that retire themselves
under thy right hand, from such as rise up against them: even thou O God, our
strength for thy promises, for thy truth, and thy son Christ Jesus sake, who
by his blood has stablished a holy and everlasting league betweeene thee and
thy people, as always hitherto, so now much rather, help we beseech thee the
whole body of thy Church generally, and every more special society or member
thereof: most specially by name, embrace we pray thee with thy principal
defense, thy most noble Churches, this of England and the other of France and
in them thy two beloved servant, chief heads and Governors of the same,
Elizabeth our gracious Queen, and Henry the most Christian King. As for their
enemies, O Lord, and the enemies of thy elect people, fill their faces with
shame, dishonor, and rebuke, doing unto them as thou did of old time to
the adversaries of thy people Israel, even to Pharao, Iabin, Sisera and
Senacherib: and of late to the Duke of Guise and Maine in France, and the
Spanish inuaders of our Land in the great deep. So cast out all their
counsels O God, and cause them to perrish and be overthrown: but let those
that love thee, be as the Sun in the increase of his strength, to the utter
abashment and astonishment of the wicked, to their occasionable inquiry after
thy truth, to the public acknowledgement of thy justice and power in the
earth. And lastly to the stablishment of the thankfulness of the just and the
enlargement of thy praise in the mouths of all thy Saints, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. To whom with thee the Father and the holy Ghost, one true
eternal and ever living God, be all honor, praise, power and dominion, now
and for ever. Amen.
