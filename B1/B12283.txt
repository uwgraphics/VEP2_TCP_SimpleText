A pleasant new song that plainly does show,
that al are Beggars, both high and low,
A mean estate let none despise:
for it is not Money that makes a man wise.
To the tune of Cuckolds all a row.


COme cease your songs of Cuckolds row
for now it is something stale,
And let us sing of Beggars now,
For that's in general,
In City and in Country,
men from high to low,
In each degree or quality,
Are Beggars all a row.
How many men are there that live,
and do no good at all?
And such had rather spend, then give
to them that live in thrall,
Los^ a hundred at a cast,
as much at the next throw,
But what comes of them at the last,
Beggars all a row.
Some country Lads that backward thriues,
left with a large estate,
Weary of those country lives,
they have enough of that:
The country then the City courts,
a country life's too low,
For here are many tricks and sports,
makes Beggars all a row.
First for a Coach and horses,
there is one reuersion flies,
^^ond^ (...) new Fashions,
(...) ^nities,
(...) Maid and Man,
(...) ^e grows low,
(...) ^ch for a Sedan,

I saw a handsome proper youth,
and he was wondrous fine,
But when I understood the truth,
his case was worse then mine,
On wine and Drabs, he did all spend,
which wrought his overthrow,
So fortune placed him in the end,
with Beggars all a row,
I have a Mistress of mine own,
that bears a lofty spirit,
Though gold and silver she has none
nor any good demerit,
Yet will she brave it with the best,
where ever she does go,
And be at every Gossips feast,
with Beggars all a row.
But of all Beggars he is the worst,
that does complain he is poor:
And evermore shall be accursed,
that starues in midst of store,
Let Usurers therefore take heed,
least to the Devil they go,
That do complain before they need,
with Beggars all a row
Gilbert loves the Ale-^ouse well,
Dick will not be beh^nd,
Jane and Tib, and bonny Nell,
are to each other kind,
For two full pots, come let us ioyn^
although our states be low,
My money ^^^ll shall go with thin^
Begge^^ (...) ^ow.
The second part,
To the same tune.


IN faith my Landlord is not paid,
and what care I for that,
My Grannam she has often said,
that care will kill a Cat,
Come fill us the other Pot good Boy,
and then in troth we will go,
Come neighbor why are you so coy,
we are Beggars all a row.
Ione has paund her band of Lawne,
and Tom his fudling Cap,
Ralph has laid his Cloak to pawn,
for to maintain the Tap,
The Alehouse thriueth best I see,
this all the world does know,
So here good follow here is to thee,
Beggars all a row.
I have another Teaster yet,
and cannot be content,
I cannot rest nor quiet sit,
till all my money be spent,
Too much money makes men mad,
the proverb plain does show,
And want of money makes men sad,
and Beggars all a row.
The bloody fight moves me to wrath,
betwene^ (...) Dutch and Spain,
I gladl^ (...) ^ould know the truth,
who (...) fight did gain,
The D^ ^^tempted as its known,
the S^^^^^^rd's overthrow,
Now b^^^ ^f them may make their moan,
w'ar^ ^^ggers all a row.
A Country man did sell his Nagge,
three Heafers, and a Bull,
And brought to town a Canuas bag,
with writings filled full,
But all the money that he had
the Lawyer pulled it too,
Alas poor man thy cause is bad,
Beggars all a row.
Two men did pass their words of late
for a Knave as I did hear,
They paid the debt, and broke their state
for he would not appear,
Let others take example then,
lest they themselves overthrow,
To day they may be gentlemen,
then Beggars all a row.
I that made this song of late,
have well observed the time,
I Would rather live in mean estate,
then higher seek to climb,
My money is my lackie-boy,
I send him too and fro,
Sweet content I do enjoy,
with Beggars all a row.
He that begges an alms of heaven,
cannot complain he is poor,
His daily Bread, is daily given,
what can he wish for more?
Thus all are Beggars every day,
all both high and low,
In this we may conclude and say,
w^are Beggars all a row.
