The life of prestes.
This present treatise concerning thestate and life of Chanons / prestes /
clerks / and minystres of the church / was first co^pyled in Latyne by the
reverend and devout father Dyonisius / sometime one of the Charter House in
Ruremond / and taken and exemplifyed with great diligence out of an original
copy / ye which he wrote with his own hand / and now again being
diligently corrected / is translated into the English tongue / unto the honor
of god / and for the vtilite and soul health of Clerks / and other students
of the same.

Preface of the Author.
CVrsyd is that man which does the work of god necglygently. This is written
in the.xlviii. chapter of the prophet Hieremye. God whose majesty is
incomparable / despises him that is undevout in his service / he abhorryth
the sluggard / he defyeth the wicked and the necgligent / moreover if the
princes of this world look for to be served with due reverence and attendau^ce
/ how much more then does the lord of all things (whose majesty surely is
infynite) will / command / and require / that we shall serve him with most
principal diligence. The Apostle therefore gives us monicio^ saying in this
wise. Let us serve god with fear and diligence. And in another place he
exhortyth us in this wise. Labor for your salvation with fear / awe / and
dread / for surely those three things do cause dilygence / they induce us unto
spiritual circumspection and distroy all necglygence according unto the
saying of scripture: which is this. Let us always walk circu^spectly before
god evermore fearyng. lest we in any wise do offend the presence of the
almighty which beholdyth all things. And like as fear of body mouyth man's
mind for to eschew peril / even so the fear of god causyth us to be
circu^spect in eschewyng sin. Therefore as it is written in the book of
Ecclesiasticus / he that is without fear may not be iustefyed. And Solomon
says. The fear of god is a well of life / for to avoid the ruin of death /
which also says in another place / he that fea^yth god is neglygent in
nothing. Undoubtedly this detestable negligence which deseruyth malediction and
everlasting dampnacion / is most repugnau^t and contrary unto wholesome
solicitude / and vertuos diligence. Seeing therefore that the fear of god
ingendryth diligence / it must nedys follow that a man fearyng god shall in
nothing be neglygent / it is not without cause therefore that David the maker of
psalmys said / fear ye god all that be his saynctes / for they that fear him
shall want nothing which text is to be understood of no bond or seruyle
fear / but of such fear as a child has of his father. Seeing therefore that
the fear of god is so much necessary and wholesome / we are well warnyd in all the
holy scripture / for to do all our works having before our eyes the fear of
god / in so much that our lauds whereby we praise him / and our glory whereby
we reioysed in him / ought to be joined and have a sent of this godly fear /
whereupon the holy prophet says Serve ye the lord with fear / and rejoice in
him with dread. And certainly to serve god after this fashyon is a special
gift of his grace / according unto the saying of Job / from the north comyth
gold / and from god comyth the tymorous or fearful praysyng / for syns that all
our ryghtuousnes (as the prophet than witnesses) is in the syghte of god /
but a ragge of a woman vnpurified / and syns that in all our other acts and
doings there happen many distraccions and defautes / ought we not then to be
always circumspecte / ware / diligent / and fearful / lest even in doing our
good works / we offend our lord / and be reproved of that ryghtuos and
dreadful judge / for like as ye holy abbot Agathon said. If god should lay
against our many sold necgligence and defautes / that we happen to incur
whylest we are prayeng / vndoubtidly we could not be saved. wherefore let us
endeavor our selves with our hole power for to eschew this detestable
necgligence in all our divine service / whereupon friar Thomas in the.liii.
question of his work affirms that necgligence is the leuynge of due and
convenient busynes / and is directely repugnaunt and contrary unto spiritual
and vertuos diligence. And likewise as diligence is a special point of wysedom
/ even so is necgligence the chief point of folyshenes / for as saynct Isodore
says. Negligens.i. non elige^s And so is he yt takes none head what is good
nor what is evil / therefore like as the taking head and chusynge of those
things that are mete and necessary for a good purpose / is an aid of a wise
man / so the leuynge of and refusing of such things is very necglige^ce /
which is an act of a fool / and comyth for lack of good aduysement and
discrecion / for if a man would inwardlye considre the authorite and worthynes
of gods high commandment and his most dreadful and ryghtuos judgment /
and there with all his reward and joy of them that obey him / and the
torments and pains of them that dysobey him / he should forthewith begin to
tremble / to abhor negligence / and finally to do the work of god with all
dylige^ce. Notwithstanding S. Gregory writes that Securite is the mother of
negligence. But yet there is a good Securite which proceeds from a good and a
pure conscience whereof Solomon beryth witness in the.xv. chapter of his
prouerbys Prouer. 15.
saying. An assured mind is as it were a continual feste. There is another
manner of Securite that is peryllous and comyth by reason of error and lack of
aduyseme^t or consideracio^. And that is where a man takyth no head of himself
when he is in ieoperdy / nc remembryth how he walks i^ the mids of the
deuylles calthrop and snares nor that he offendyth god greuosly many ways /
nor caryth not whyther he deserve love or hate / whyther he be predestinate and
reproved / whyther he shall be sauyd or euerlastyngly condemnyd / of the which
most dampnable and dangerous Securite it is mentioned in the vii. chapitre of
Ecclesiastes esia. 7.
in this wise There be of the wicked sort that be as presumptuos as if they
had wroughte justly. So that this presumpcion and also negligence grow and
spring out of one rote / and so it makyth no great mattier though one sin
have his beginning of diverse. Let us therefore be verily wise / diligent /
careful / and circumspecte / as creatures having eyes on every side. And let
us set our hearts upon our journey like as the prophet Aggeus monysheth us /
that we turn not into the way of sin / lest we sone after fall into the
torme^tys of hell. And let us powder and and fulfill the saying of the
scripture which is this: Blyssed is that man that is always farefull / for I
have fearyd god like as I would wauys of the sea ragynge upon me. Whereupon holy
Job says these words. When I remember god I am stryken with fear And also I
was tymorous in all my works lord / for I know that thou wylt spare / when I
offend / for a wise man castyth the worst in all thing / because he is
uncertain and in doubt whyther his acts do proceed of charity / and whither he
please god or not And for as much as it is a dreadful thing to fall into the
hands of the living god / the which is terrible in his judgments upon the
sons of men whereof also we are uncertain and ignorant what he has
determined of us in the secrets of his prescience or knowledge / and finally
what shall become of us: let us then (all necgligence laid a part) study to
serve him always with fear and reverence / and so doing we may be sure to
trust on the best / but if we do our work neglygently / we shall peryshe with
those of whom the prophet speaks. They that swerve from thy commandments
shall peryshe. These things I have touched bresly of the fear of god / and
eschewynge neclygence because in this work following I do intend specially to
entreat of certain mattiers concerning the good co^uersacion and living of
religious persons or regulars / that is to wit of such as are bounde^ to any
rule or order certain / the state of who^ (alas the more pity) is fallen to
great ruin and decay / ye and in manner unto extreme misordre / nevertheless
among them there are many good men that with the dread of god are mouyd unto
perfyte living. Among whom also there are many that I love tendrely / the
which have oftentimes disclosyd unto me the charity of their hearts / for
whose sakys I have written this book / wherefore (by the grace and help of god)
I shall touch this mattier as groundly and as substancially as I can possible.

Thus endyth the Table.
Of the original institution and first beginning of religious / and reguler
persons. The first article.
THe holy evangelist Luke in the foruth chaytre of the Acts of the Apostles
declaryth / how in the first beginning of the church (the holy ghost being
sent from above) the universal congregation of faithful people in Iherusalem
did live in comen / having no properte in any thing. In those days substance
was divided to every man according to their necessyte the which life endured
among them so long as the blyssed Apostles were there and ruled them as
faithful people / yet truly when the Apostles with that devout James the
less (at that time being president of the church) were from them departed /
yet notwithstanding that most devout and fervent living in comen for a
certain space endured. But after what beleuers in Christ's faith began to
increase thoroughe out all Jury / Galylee / and Samarie / and many thousands
began to be regenerate in Christ / than could not that life in common be well
observed of all men. The great fervor also of their first devotion began to
vanyshe away. And the hotenes of the blood of our savior Christ began in
process of time to wax cold in the hearts of the more part of men. In so
much that the most part of such faithful people that were conuertyd of the
Jews as of the paynymys to obteygne a properte in goods to be contentyd to be
obedient unto their rulers. But for all that many calling to their
remembrance their first devotion and conversation / being inflamyd by the
inspyrate operation of the holy ghost above / with a great hot and fervent
love of perfection and pouerte / took upon them again that indifferent life in
comen. And ferther they did renew the institucyons of the Apostles / in the
which to the entente they might the more freely and spedyely proceed / they
seueryd themself from the other faithful people of god / and began to
inhabit in suburbs and other secreate and solitary places / living not only
in comen with their substance / but also absteynynge from marriage corporally
forsakynge their parents and kynsfolk / ledyng their lyuys under holy
obedience according to the gostly counsel of our savior Christ. After which
fasshyon the religious life had his first beginning / as Cassianus out of the
words of a certain Abbot / called Piamon in the secound volume of collatio^s
shewyth at large. And as the same man wytnessyth in the secounde book of the
rulys of holy fathers how in Alexandria certain weldisposyd regular persons
were institute and ordained by the holy euangelyst Mark / which did not only
live after the institucyons of the Apostles in common / but they addyd thereunto
much more and hyer devotion as abstine^ce with other cold hard and peynfull
life evermore given to prayer and contemplacyon. In so much that as well the
Jews as paynymys did marvel thereat. They were also so incessauntly given
both night and day to redynge and also to hand labor that scantly the
secound or third day the appetyte of meat came in their remembrance.
Furthermore that thing that holy Jerome in the book of noble men swewyth and
agreyth with the same saying thus. The euangelyst Mark the first preacher of
the faith of Christ unto the people of Alexandria / did institute and ordeyne a
church there where so great lernyng and chastity of life was / to the intent
that he might provoke the universal folowers of Christ to his example. And
further he said yt Philo the most eloquent of the Jews which occupied
himself in the praise and laud of our faithful people as it apperyth in the
book that he wrote of the first church of the euangelyst Mark at the cite of
Alexandria / he affyrmyd also that such christen beleuers were not only there
/ but also in many other prouynces / calling their houses and mansion places /
monasteries / whereby it apperyth that such was the church of ye first beleuers
in Christ / which we call now monks. And such as the holy euangeliste Luke
does reherce that were first beleuers in Jerusalem. Also the same Philo made a
certain book of the life contemplatyue / wherein he says / that the first
disciples of the euangeliste Mark were ever given to contemplacion and prayer.
Furthermore of the treuth of this matter / ye shall have more certain. ^owlege
of the instruccio^ of holy Dionisius in his book de Ecclesiastica hierarchia /
For there the same holy man descrybeth how the manner and approuyd custom of
consecration of monks in the time of the Apostles / and first foundation of
the church was very devout. Moreover such as seueryd themself from the
company of faithful people that obtained properte of goods ben divided into
two kinds. For some took upon them the profession of religyouse and solitary
life. And some truly contynuyd among secular men / and did humble service unto
to the congregation in the church / living under the governance of holy
byshopes. For why the devout bishops that were at that time called and joined
unto them devout faithful and lernyd people that were their household
servants or such well dysposed persons / as were dwelling night to their
houses / and such as ladde that holy life in common / according to the
institucions of the Apostles before rehearsed with many devout addicions and
obseruaunce / which to them were showed by holy bishops / whose clerks they
were. And applied themself to the lauds of god as byshopes did / rysynge at
mydnyght or sone after duly to celebrate their divine service / that ought to
be done in the night and eke in the morning. Notwithstanding they did not
make that solemn vows which be requisite to every religious as monks do now
adays. For why they seem to be / but the sprynges and begynners of the life
and calling of regulars which when it chau^syd that they could not all inhabit
with holy bishops / they were distributed into other devout places that be
called colleges being under the governance of bishops / and having a mean
ruler called a deane / which places also were named monasteryes / and had in
them one fraytour / and one dortour. They were at that time dilygently given to
divine obseruaunce and obedience / utterly avoiding all points of uncleanness
and incontinencie. Whereupon Pope Clement in his fourth Epistle wrote unto his
well beloved brethren and unto his scholyfelowys of Jerusalem dwelling to
gether with his welbelouyd brother and bishop after thi^ manner following.
Clement the bishop sendyth you gretynge. etc. A life in common to all men / and
especyally to clerks is very necessary. And principally to them that desire to
be militau^t in the church of god without rebuke or shame. And such as do
coueyte to follow the life of the Apostles and their disciples. And for this
cause we command you to follow and obey their doctrine and example.
Furthermore for this purpose saint Jerome said unto one Nepotian / as hereafter
folowyth. A clerk he says ought so to behave himself / that god may both
possess him. And that he may possess god. And in so much that it is written.
God is my part / he ought to possess nothing but god only. Wherefore if he
possess any thing besides god he shall not have his part with god as for
exaumple. If a man possess gold silver / possessions / or other householde
stuff / it behouyth not yt our lord should be comparyd to such parts. Of this
matter in like manner in the.xii. chapitre of the decrees more evidently it
apperyth / whereupon thereof writes saint Jerome again / saying thus. There be
two kinds and manners of Christen people / whereof one is that manner of people
that be only set and applied to divine service and given to contemplacion and
prayer and such as think it most convenient to refrain from the trobylous
encomberau^ce of temporal and wordly things / as clerks and other devout
and dedicate people to god which being contentyd with a pore and simple living
/ both of sustyna^ce and also clothyng having no properte of goods among
them / but vsyng all thing in comen.

Hereafter folowyth the confirmacion of the foresaid life in comen out of
sayenges of holy fathers and why they be called clerks. And wherefore they have
stypendes given to them to find them. And whether they may lawfully have
properties of goods or no. The secound article.
THe holy doctor and prelate Isidorus in the seventh book of his Ethymologyes
dyscussyth this word clerk in this manner of wise. I suppose that it is called
clergy / and that they be called clerkys / because S. Mathie (which was first
ordained by the Apostles) came and was elected unto his dignite by castyng of
lottys / syns which time persons within holy ordres have by called Clerici /
in Englysh Clerkys (and who says) men called unto spiritual dignite by the
lotte of gods will / for this word Cleros is asmoch to say in English as a
lot of heritage. And therefore they are called clerici or clerkys / because they
are of the lot and inheritance of god / or else because they have god to their
lot and inheritance or because god has his lot and i^heritau^ce in them. But
generally all such are called clerkys that ministre and do service in the
church of Christ / whose names and degrees be such. Benet / colet / subdecane /
decane / priest and bishop. And furthermore as Gratianus wytnessyth the degrees
of the hyer and lower sort of prestes in the new testament took his beginning
immediately from Christ / which first ordained the.xii. Apostles as chyefe and
hyeghest prestes. And the threscore and xii. disciples as lower prestes. But he
chose the blessed Peter to be his princicipall and head priest. In so much as he
delyueryd unto him the kays of the kingdom of heuyn for all them and before all
them. And Christ of himself being called Petra (which is a very stone or
rock) gave unto him the name of Peter. The Apostles following the same fashyon
/ ^n every cite ordained both prestes and byshopes. Also we read and find
that the decanes were ordained by the Apostles. But other inferior ordres as
benet / colet / subdecane and other / in process of time were institute by ye
church whereupon (as Raymundus / Ioannes / Vlricus / and other do testify)
temporal goods and possessions were therefore by the lay people given unto the
church / and that forbycause that secular men have no leyser to continue and
evermore apply them self to prayer and divine service / they being minystres
and clerks of the church / should supply ye rhmes of the lay people in prayeng
/ minystring / and satisfyeng for them by whose almesdede and reward they be
found and vpholden / but now in co^clusyon as it did appear / not only in the
time of the first beginning of ye church but also many years afterward / that
prestes and regulars might in no wise have properte of goods / but vsyd
themself to one fraytour and one dortour / which afterward by dispensacio^ or
otherwise was chau^gyd after / such time as the church fell to ley most
lamentable greatly bewaylyng ruin and decay both in the head and also in the
members of the church. The which we have great need to pray to almighty god /
that he of his goods would wouchesaufe to restore unto the old most laudable
order and manner. For why / how many manner of abhomynable vices do and daily
will rise and spryng by the reason of the lack of living in comen / in one
fraytour / and one dortour / it is more evidently showed by experience / than
any tongue can express.

For what cause regulars are bound to live very vertuosly full of good example
chaste and meke. The third article.
LIke as the law of the gospel was to us delyueryd by the only begote^ son
of god / the law of charity and virtue / the law also of all perfection /
techynge us to despise and contempne all fleshely and worldly things and only
to be affeccyonate and evermore desirous of spiritual / godly / and heavenly
things / incessantly given to the everlasting and immutable god with a pure
and fervent heart and mind. Even so all christian people especially about all
other nations in the world ought to be charitable / merciful / ghostly / holy
/ full of good example / pacient / meke / chaste / sobre and perfect / and
otherwise they are not worthy to be called the christen people of Christ. It is
not suffici^^t for the^ to follow Christ by faith only / but it is very
necessary to the health and wholesome calling of a christen man to follow his
lord god Jesus Christ / by the due obseruaunce of his commandments by
exercise of virtue / and by such manner of life as shall please god. As our
lord and savior himself knowledgyth / saying thus. Wherefore say ye unto me
lord / lord / doing not that thing that I command you / whereby it may be
perceived that who so ever transgressyth the precepts of god / vaynly and
unworthily namyth him lord. For the same purpose thus he says again. Every
man that says unto me lord / lord / shall not enter into the kingdom of
heaven / but he that does the will of my father that is in heaven. Also he
says again in this manner. They that be the people of Christ that is to say
perteygnyng to Christ as his true servants and minystres have mortifyed and
ponyshed their flesh with abstinence from vice and concupiscence. Therefore
christen men are bound to live af^^^ the fashyon of Christ / that is to wit /
to imitate and follow christ in all charity / humylite / paciency / sobrenes /
and chastity / or else they be called christen men the more to their damnacion.
And for that cause the Apostle Johan says in this wise. Who so says that he
will remain in Christ / him behouyth to walk as Christ walked. Besides this /
how utterly holely and purely a man ought to obey and serve god / it is
clearly expressyd in the saying of the Apostle James showing thus / who so ever
has fulfyllyd and performyd all the law / offendyng but in one point he is
judged gyltye in the hole. Behold therefore how narow the way of health is / wha^
for one word we suffer eternal damnacion. And as the truth wytnessyth / he
that callyth his brother foul / shall be gyltye of the pains of hell. In
likewise he that s^laundryth one of these innoce^tes receyuyth the horrible
torments of hell / the same lords opinion. And also he that offendyth one of
the little ones that beleuen in men / it is requisyte that a mylstone be hanged
obout his neck / and so to be drownyd in the bottom of the sea. Moreover the
maker of our law commaundyd all men that beleuen in him to do as he says
hereafter following. Love your enemies / do good unto them that hate you / and
pray for the^ that do persequute and sklander you. Those hard things truly
and with many other like belonge^ to every faithful christian man. Furthermore
the hyer in estate and degree that a man be / the more and greater rewards
that his chance is to have so much the more is he bound to a vertuose life for
this. The more to any man is given: the more of him is asked again. Therefore
who so be a regular / he is not only bound to the precepts of the law in
the gospel before touched: but also to those things that are especially to
regulars enjoined. And verily such as be not only regulars / but constitute in
any manner of holy order / are bound besides the things before reherced / unto
such things as is commanded to all them that be constitute in the same order
/ wherefore if he be a prelate or a pastoure / that is to say a feder of
christian people with ghostly fode / or that he has taken upon him the cure and
charge of souls / tha^ he is surely bound to many more hyer things tha^
before expressyd.

Now seeing therefore it is said that the ministres of the church and regulars
be therefore called clerks / for because they be especially the lot / part /
or heritage of god / as men only dedicate and deputed to divine service than
it is open unto us / that they are bound to live so excellently yt their
inuisyble adversaries may not obtain any right / or dominion in them / of the
godly honor / but that all times with a substanciall and pure fidelite they
may perteygne to god And again it is said that temporal re^tes were assygned by
the lay people unto the clerks and regulars / to the intent that they should
not only minystre unto almighty god for their own welthe and preseruacion /
but also in the place and stead of the lay people: there they should pray and
ministre / and also pacifye and reconsyle that ryghtwyse judge not only to
themself / but also to them by whose stypendes they live. They are bound to
reconsyle themself and again to come i^ the favor of god / if sometime they
fortune ^o lose it. And also of right they ought to aply. And inte^ty fly give
themself to the land of god in their prayer and service / both for them
self and also for their foundars and benefactours. Whereby it apperyth how
purely and virtuously they are bound to live / that by the reason of the
fulness of their virtue and the abundaunce of their meryt they may help and
succor their friends and neighbors as well on life as ded. Therefore such
regular and ordinary hours with other prayers / lauds / and psalmodyes /
whereto they are bound ought of them to be done and performed with great
diligence. And no dought but they ought to behave them self as worthy
minystres / and men contentyd to do the service of god / pronou^cyng it
distinctly solitarily and deuoutely. Otherwise they have no right in any goods
or substance of the churches / another in the heritage of Christ / nor yet in
the stypendes or rewards of the souldiars of god. As the profunde lernyd
doctor Guilhelmus Parisiensis wytnessyth in many places. Vlricus also in his
book named summa. Raymundus / Durandus / Ioannes / and other be of the same
opinion.

Of such things as are specially enjoined to regulars. The.iiii. ar.
LIke as Isidorus says that clerks be named by this greek word cler^s /
which is in English a lot for because they be especially of the lot of god /
and god is their heritage. Right so these regulars be called of these greek
word / canon / in Latyne / regula / in Englysh a rule. And as Gratiaunce says
it called a rule / for that that it ledyth directly: nor at any time waueryth
aside or as some men sayen / it is called a rule for that that it rulyth or
gouernyth. And shewyth the very fashion of living directely: or else for because
it ordryth and correctyth that thing that is evil disposyd or out of the way.
Clerks therefore be named regulars for because they be bound to lead there life
dyrectly and in good rule / auoydyng all inclinacion to vice. And clerly
passing by paths of virtue / unto blyssydnes / according unto the
institucions of holy fathers to them before ordained. But although of (...)
^ener^ll counsel / by high bysshopes / doctors / and noble prelates. A
Jerome / Augustine / Gregory / and Isidore many things were institute to be
observed of the regulars which in the decree thereof made be towchyd and
expressyd / yet notwithstanding these precepts (as many as be sufficient for
our purpose) are compe^diously gathered together in the beginning of the
third book of decretalles / wherein among other it is this said and
commaundyd. Clerks that bear wepyn and be vsura^s / let them be excommunicate.
If any of the clerks do use to set their busshes or here / let them be
accursed. If any of the clerks do presumptuously haunt the monasteryes of
nonnes without a manifest and reasonable occasion / first he shall be correctyd
by the bishop / and if he will not cease / he shall clerly be dyscharged of
his office in the church. Ferther Innocentius the third in a general
counsel said that. To the intent that both the acts and condicio^s of clerks
may be better reformyd. And that they all may live contynently and chastely /
especyally such as ben constitute in holy ordres utterly eschew ynge vice and
voluptuousnes / so that they may mynistre and serve in the syghte of god with a
pure heart and chaste body. And to the entente that hope of pardon shall not
encorage them to offend / we ordeyne / that who some ever hereafter be founden
or taken corrupted with the vice of incontinencie (as he has offendyd more or
less) so shall he be ponysshed according to the holy regular ordres / which we
command more effectuosly and streythly to be kept that such as the fear of
god can not revoke from sin. At the least wise they may be compelled to
forsake it by temporal ponysshement / that is to suspende them from their
offices / and also to take from the^ their benefytes of the church. Furthermore
all clerks should diligently absteyne from surfettes and dronkenes. Wherefore
they should moderatly use wine And no man should be provoked to drink for
dronkenes banyshyth a man from his wit and discresion. And also encorageth a
man to the pleasure of the body. Therefore we have decreed that such abusion
must utterly be forsaken / and that in all parts they should be bound to
drink after a moderate fashyon. And if any of them in these foresaid things
be found culpable (except he being of his superior admonyshed wylbe
reconsyled) he shall be from his office and benefyce suspendyd. And clerks shall
not excercyse worldly offices / nor use marchau^dyse / especially such as be
dishonest They shall not give audience to mynstrelles / Iesters / and dyssardes.
Let them chefely avoid tauerns / except it be in case of necessyte / as a man
purposyd in a journey. They may not play at cards / nor at dyce / nor use no
such manner of gamys. Their crowns must be shaven accordyngly. And also they
must dilygently excercyse themself in all offices of the church with all
other good and virtuous studyes. Their upper garments ought to be close / and
not to long or to short. They ought also in nowyse to were any read clothe /
or grieve weltyd sleuys / or shewys / brydles / or sadels gylt no laces / nor
lachettes garnyshed with silver or gold / nor yet any rings / except it be
such as be allowyd by dignite of their office. Also it is commanded / that no
press keep any women by whom he may be suspected. For if any priest / deane or
subdeane being suspectyd of fornication with any woman / be after the secounde
or third warning / found with her in communicacion / or conuersaunt with her
in any manner of wise: immediately after let him be excommunicate / for women be
not permyttyd to dwell with clerks / except they be such manner of persons /
in whom the law of nature will not suffer any defaulte to be suspected.
Clerks may use no plays toys / nor gamynges in the church. The goods of
clerks should be forth in common / they should eat in one house / and sleep
under one covering. Mark therefore / how here it is manifest i^ what good
order / devotion / and example the life of regulars sometime has been. And how of
right it ought now to be. Therefore let them be fearful / and let them give no
confidence to any unreasonable dispensacion / which is the very destruction of
all virtuous living. And let them take no regard unto customed lybertye /
for that is but a mean to corrupt a perfyte life / and truly very necessyte
/ or apparaunt profit is the mother or original beginning of dispensations /
by whom their vicious conversation is excu^y^ / an high and holy bysshopes /
^^^o / and ^elasius with many other princypall doc^ours do a^terme / but now
consequently / some of these things shall be more especially declared.

Why clerks or regulars ought to bear no manner of weapon / nor to fight / nor
use to set their here / nor yet to be usurers. The.v. article.
IT is convenient (as it apperyth) that all mynystres / clerks / or regulars
of the church should themself apply to the service of god / that is to say /
they should be given to prayer and contemplacio^. And to the land and praise of
their maker. And to desire god to be merciful / as well to them / as to other
their frendys and neighbors / by whose exhibicion and stypendes they are
vpholden and sustained. And seeing that the excercyse of war (wherein the
inquietnes and trouble of ma^s heart do especially remain) should be a great
impediment against these good acts to be done / therefore war is forbidden
them as well as marchaundyse / for that cause they ought not to bear wepon / lest
they should be prouokyd to fight / and least they should show themself as men
ready to fight and lest they should quarrel with other men. But for all that if
they journey by any dangerous places / than may they were necessary weapons to
fere their enemies / and themself moderatly to defend with harmeles defense /
moreover where as regulars are deputed to serve the altar / wherein the passion
of Christ is represented in the sacrament / there is good cause why they are
prohibyted to shed blood / but rather are bound to shed their own blood for
the love of Christ and ryghtwysnes. Therefore this sayng of the Apostle / of
them is to be obseruyd Strive ye not with words / for it is to no purpose
profitable / but to the subversion of the herars. Also further he says thus.
If any man be supposed full of debate / we and the church of god will have no
such company. And therefore scripture says. That man is to be co^me^dyd /
that conuayeth himself from debate and strife. And furthermore they ought to
be armyd with spiritual defense / to prevail and resyst against the e^^myes
of their health. And to such defense they ought to induce the lay people by
their example. Of this matter ye holy father saint Ambrose / in his book called
de officus / and also in other places wrote many things. In the decre also /
many things were induced to this purpose. For certainly it was institute at a
general counsel / that what clerk so ever had dyed in fyghtyng skoldyng / or
other games of the gentyles / should be prayed for / another in oblation / another
in any oryson / or prayer / but should fall into the hands of the judge / yet
notwithstanding he should be buried. Also it was ordained in the counsel of
Tolytan / that clerks beryng weapon ryotously should lose the degree of their
order / and be banyshed for ever in to monasteryes / likewise it is red in the
acts of the counsel of Melde. That none of the clergy should take upon them
weapons of defense / not her i^ any wise should go armyd / but the name of their
profession they should perform both with religyouse manners / and also with
religious habyte. The which thing if they despised / they should be grievously
correctyd / as first to lose their propre degrees / and further to be taken as
extreme despysers of the holy canons / and also cursyd corrupters of the
auctorite of the church for they can not serve both god and the world.
Furthermore they ought utterly to avoid all wordly glory / and generallye all
thing that prouokyth a man to incline to the pleasure of the body / with all
other vain curiosytes. Certain precepts aggreable with the same be especially
enjoined by the Apostle / sayng thus. In no wise be ye conformable to this
world / but be you reformyd with the spirit of discresion whereby he meanyth
that they ought to abhor and avoid the setting of their bushes the
comlynes of their locks the trymmyng of their here. And chefely the roughnes of
their berdes / in so much that it is prohibyte that women should be attyryd in
here / and as Albertus wrote upon Job / saying thus: Such things do provoke
concupyscence / for clerks are commanded to be garnyshed both inwardly and
outwardly with a vestiment of virtue / and also they should be inwardly
resplendent and shynynge in good manners / so that they might proceed honestly /
being gouernyd in all their sight and sensys / Besides this usury is most
straightly prohiby^^ not only to them / but also to the universal kind of
faithful people / in so much that as the philosophour grauntyth. Usury is a
thing most principal against nature. And as the prophet Dauyd describes a
just man / thus he says: He lent not his money to usury. And as Clymatus
shewyth. A nygard is a mokker of the gospel / much more an usurer / and
especially a clerk whom it behouyth to be more spiritual and virtuous than a
lay man / for as S. Jerome satyh / it is the most vehement destruction of the
church / when lay men be better disposed then clerks. And usury truly with
symonye be two the most myscheuous branches of auaryce / whereupon S. Isidore
wrytyh i^ this manner of wise It is contained i^ the law of holy fathers that
prestes / clerks / or regulars should sever the^self from al vulgar and
secular life / absteynyng always from the voluptuous desires of the world and
eke of the flesh / they may in no wise give the^self to usury / they must
hate and abhor the occasion of all such foul lucre and fraud / ye they
must avoid and eshewe the affeccio^ of money as though it were a kendlyng of
all other vices.

For what cause regulars are bound especially to follow chastyte of body and
clennes of mind / and therefore they ought not to haunt the cloystres of no^nes
/ nor to enter into their houses. The.vi. article.
THis thing has been by many holy and high bishops / many general counsayles
/ and many prouincyall constitucyons most especially / most strongly / and
most oftentimes / enjoined and commanded unto ministres of the church / to
all regulars and men constitute and appointed to holy ordres that they should
absteyne from all uncleanness / incontinence / and detestable fornicacio^. For in
the sin of the flesh is the most great and manifest turpitude bestlynes /
dishonestie / and fylthynes. And also such manner of vices in the clergy / be
most vehemently rebukyd of the people / many great vices be to them annexed
and ensuynge of them. ^or first they acquyre the hate and dysdayne of god /
than they procure the ignorance of all spiritual things / they engendre also
a peynfull sufferaunce of virtuous excercyse / they blind a man's mind / and
in conclusion they pluck a man clean away from the love and contemplacion
both of godly and heavenly things. Therefore (in so much that the holy misterye
of the altar is most pure / and the sacraments of the church be most clean
and ghostly (especially the sacrament of the blessed body of our lord) it is
most vicyous and inconuenie^t that the minysters of the church and altar /
should so precious sacraments defyle and corrupt / with that most foul
filthy and abominable sin of the flesh and bestly concupiscence / ye and to
presume to serve. And to receive so deep a fountain of purite and clennes /
with so foul and corrupt a mouth. And furthermore syns the time of the blessed
Apostles / this most vile and abominable vices have been prohybyte unto
clerks and minystres of the church upon most strayte and grievous pains. The
which thing (to the intent it may be the better known) I will somewhat
thereof declare. And although that strayte and so litary life is now (the more
pity greatly decayed) yet nevertheless I will touch a lytyl of the statutes and
rulys of them that it may appear how vehemently holy fathers (in whom the
inspiracion of the holy ghost / the zele of justice / and the love of virtue /
did excellently preu^yle) did prohibit the uncleanness of clerks regulars and
prestes. According verily to the rulys of the Apostles / every man constitute
in holy ordres / especyally a priest / falling into the sin of uncleanness /
should be for ever more deposyd / which long time after was observed for the
sin of aduoutrie / as concerning ponyshement / whereof it is contained in the
seventh synod holden at Aureliaunce. That if a clerk has been conuycted of
aduoutrye / or had confessed it / he should have been deposyd from his office /
and so to have been commyttyd unto a monastery during his life. And also the
holy father Pope Clement (as it is red) made institucyons after the same manner
of perpetual deposynge and ponyshement of prestes doing fornicacio^. But after
that / in the time of pope Siluester / that extreme correction was somewhat
mitygate / as touching prestes / that were penitent and co^tryte of their own
propre and free will / and such as ceased their sinful living for in the
counsel of Gangara and also in the decree / the.xxviii. distinction it is read
/ that if a priest has committed fornicacion / although he ought by the rulys
of the Apostles / to be deposyd yet by the auctorite of that blessed pope
Siluester / if he did not continue in vice / but refusyd it and rose again of
his own frewyll / that then he should take repentance in this world for the
space of ten years. And being removed from the other brethren by the space of
three months / he should be vsyd with bred and water / from euenyng to euenyng
/ but in sondayes and other principal feasts / he should be fedd with a little
drink / fyshe or rise / without flesh or blood / without eggs / orels chese
/ lyenge on the ground night and day desyryng the mercy of god. Than when three
months were determined / he should come forth / but not abroad in to open
places / for fear least / the multitude of good people might be offendyd by
his evil example. And it is in no wise lawful for a priest to be enjoined as
a lay man to any open penance / but after that he has perusyd the space of a
year and an half living with bred and water / except in sondayes and other
principal feasts / in whom he might use wine / flesh / blood / eggs / and
chese / according unto their regular m^^^ure / but the first year and an half
being fynyshed / he might have the sacrament minystred to him to that intent
that he should not despair in god / and that he should come to peace / that is
to say / he should be reconsylyd unto his brethren / and sing psalms in the
quere among them again / yet should he not come to the end of the alter /
but according to the saying of blessed Clement / he should ministre inferior
offices. Than unto the end of the seuenthe year / at all times / except ye
three Ester holy days / he should fast bread and water three certain days in
every weke. But the space of seven years being fulfyllyd / if the brethren
among whom he repentyd / do comende his penance as worthy and acceptable in
the sight of god / than the bishop according to the auctorite of blessed pope
Calyxt / may him revoke unto his pristine and former honor. And surely it is
to be known / that by singing one psalter / in the secou^d ferye / or gyueng
one penny to pore folk (if need be) he may be redemyd after seven years ended.
Than unto the end of the tenth year there is no redemption / but the syxth
ferye must needs be observed with bread and water. But for all this in process
of time this foresaid correction vanyshed. And was / but meanly obseruyd / as
in the third book of Decretalles is notifyed / where among all other it is
reportyd that pope Alexander the third wrote unto a certain bishop in manner
following. you ought straytly by interdiction and suspension to correct clerks
co^stitute in holy ordres / that keep concubynes / that they may remove such
manner of women out of their company / because no sinystre and froward suspicion
may be had of them. And if any of them resort to such women / or presume to
receive them / that then they may be accursyd with perpetual sentence of
exco^municacion that other may refrain from like offenses by example of them.
Also the same pope wrote unto an archbishop of Canterbury on this fashyon
ensuyng. We command you dilygently to exhort the clerks of your
jurisdictions that keep any harlottes within their subdeanryes / that they do
them remove and in nowyse to use them again. And if they refuse to forsake them
/ than to be suspe^dyd from all benefyces ^he church unto the time that they
make convenient satisfaction. And if they being suspendyd / will presume to
keep and retain such manner of women / then look that you remove them from all
manner of benefyces of the church for evermore. He speaks again in another
decretall on this wise. For because that clerks can not inte^d both to their
pleasure and carnal desires / and also to the divine service of the church /
therefore for their uncleanness they ought to be discharged of all the benefytes of
the church. Of this matter in many decretalles of popes as of Gregorius /
Siricius / Lucius Innocentius / and other it is evidently declared. Where also
this is addyd. Prelates that presume to suffer such manner of clerks /
especially being intreatyd with money and other temporal commodite / shall
incur the same penaltye. Here of an ordinance in the decree the fourscore
and third distinction / is rade on this fashion. If any bishop consent to the
fornicacion of prestes / deanes / or clerks in his diocyse: other for
affection / prayer / or reward / or else if he will not ponyshe and correct
offenders by the auctorite of his office: he shall be from his office suspendyd.
Of the which saying it is also concludyd that a bishop that correctyth not
the transgressions of such men: is more worthy to be called a sawltye dog
than a byshope. I pray you: what meanyth this word: consent: Gratianus
expoundyth it in this manner of wise. He that withstandyth not vice and error:
consentyth thereto. Innocentius the pope to the same says. Error that is not
resystyd is alowyd: and trewthe that is not defendyd is oppressyd: and that man
is worthy to be suspectyd of secret mayntenaunce: that will not withstand open
sin. All which thing may be principally supposed of prelates that are bound
to resyst vice: by very duetye of their of fyce. But now seeing it standyth in
such mysordre / how greatly ought we to bewail the abhominacion of the world
that now is. How much is this miserable and deformyd estate of the church to
be lamented: in whom other no ponysshement at all: or else the ponyshement of
the purse is extendyd upon wanton prestes clerks and regulars: which daily
are permytted to walowe in their myscheuous living to ^^^^icious occasion and
evil example of the lay people. The regular visitacio^ of clerks is to none
effect / for many of them do so rejoice that they be so exemptyd / that they
may not be correctyd another of the deane / nor yet of the bishop / the which
is even a like matter as though a monk should be exemptyd from the correction
of his abbot or priour. O what manner of thing is such exemption / wha^ against
an exemption (much less unreasonable then this) the most holy and illuminate
father saint Bernard in his book de Consideracionibus wrote sharply and
discretely to pope Eugenius and the same exemption many manner of wise did
reprove. And for the same exemption he greatly rebukyd and controllyd the
foresaid pope Eugenius sayng thus. woe be to fylthy and wrechyd sinners
vnponyshyd / which had lever to be reseruyd unto the most strayt and terrible
judgment of god / and also to fall into power of god everlasting / than in
this present life to be duly correctyd of their prelates / and to obey the
rulys and decrees of holy fathers / do not such men seem to be of the nombre of
them that shall be reprouyd / and most far from eternal blys. Seem they not
also to be the children of infernal torment / whom god sufferyth to live
according to the desire of their hearts / and trust in their own fantazyes.
Furthermore for because regulars and all other constitute in holy ordres / be
consecrate to divine service / me thinks that their fornicacion is sacrylege.
And it is called sacrylege / for that it corruptyth holy order / by unworthy
handelynge and myscheuous abusing that thing that to god is consecrate.
Therefore they are especyally prohibyte to haunte the cloystres of nonnes / and
that under the pain of exco^municacio^ they come not within their houses to
the intent that all evil occasion of sacrilege and vicious meddelynge with
them should be avoided / the which being committed should be double sacrylege /
and also a certain abominable and enorme aduoutrye / both with persons that
have offeryd themself unto the heavenly spouse being professyd and consecrate /
and also to enduce the^ unto the transgression of so solemn a vow of chastyte
which they have promised unto almighty god to be continently obseruyd and kept.

Of sobrenes to be obseruyd b^ regulars and of all surfeit riot and dronkenes to
be of them avoided. The.vii. article.
IT is even as our lord spoke / by the prophet Ozeas. Wine / dronkenes / and
women / that is to say / fornicacion takes away the heart of men / that is to
wit / it blyndyth their mind and makes dark the judgment of man's reason.
And seeing it is the best part of man / to live according to the judgment of
reason / than it apperyth that surfeit and riot may engendre in man many
incomodytees. For it hurtyth nature / it shortenyth life / it blyndyth
understanding / it procuryth many syknes infirmites and tediousnes / it
enge^dryth the hatered of god / it encreasyth envy / it makyth a man ready to
do iniurye to other men / it inducyth slogardyse and necglygence / it
prouokyth a man to unmeasurable tryfulles and bablyng / it disclosyth also
utterly al secretenes of heart compunction and fere. Therefore it is not only
prohybyte unto al regulars and spiritual persons / but universally to all
faithful christen people / and Christ himself sayng thus. Take ye head that
your hearts be not oppressyd with surfeit and dronkenes / nor with any other
regard of this world. For in conclusion like as glotony does corrupt ye mind
so it makyth the body to be dyfformyd monstrous / and depryueth a man from
natural comlynes / and also from a convenient quantite of body / and that vile
voluptuousnes of taste is bought right dear. Thereupon saint Bernarde says /
that the pleasure of the throat that nowadays is so much made of / conteyneth
scantly the bredeth of two fyngers / and yet for the delectacion of so little a
part how dilygently / how costly / and with how great labor do we prepare /
but at length to our great pain. By this means the backs and sholders of men
are spredde / and made broad like monstres / herby the great belyes are not
only fatted / but also puffed up like women with child. And while the bondys
be not able to bear the flesh / many diverse dyseases must needs engendre.

O with how great labor and exp^^^es is such dear and delicyous pleasure
prepared. Glotony and lechery do obey the pleasure of the flesh. Surfeit and
dronkenes is the deuylles chaleys / for when a man has both replenyshyd his
mind and stomach Christ in such a riotous person can find no place. And
like as fire and water can not be me^gled both together / Right so spiritual
and corporal pleasures can not be suffered in one place. For where Christ
perceyuyth surfeit of a riottous person in his drynkyng he will not vouchsafe to
reward him with his wynes that are more sweet than sugar or honey / And surely
when yt curious and delycate dyuersyte of metes and drynkes has fully fed
the stomachs of men / there is no void pure nor clean place for heuynly fode.
Why love ye voluptuosnes / forsakyng virtue and health. Truly for a foul and
brefe swetnes and delectacion / ye do procure everlasting pain and bytternes /
so that at the last ye will desire / as the rych glotton did / one drop of
water to quench the hete of the fire of hell / and yet ye shall not obtain
it. For again whom does the fervent hete of the infernal hungre and
deuyllyshe thyrst and other most extreme ponyshement / fume more than against
glottones / which do convert the necessary sustentacion of pore people into
their own pleasures. And plainly as S. Bernard wytnessyth. The fautes of the
flesh / the pleasure of the body / the fulness of the womb will other leave a
man before death / or else forsake him at the point of death. Than this flesh
of yours shortly afterward shall be deputed to worms / the soul shall be
commyttyd to infernal ponysheme^t / where such be compaygnyons in pain as
were together compaignyons in vice. O thou delicate man that swymmyste in
pleasure and riches / yet in them being wrapped thou lokyst ever for thyn own
confusion / death / and damnacion. Note what the Apostle says. The kingdom of
heuyn / is another mete nor drink / another sylke / nor purple / for the rych
man habundaunt of these / shall strayte descend into hell. O ye delycate and
voluptuose persons / whose god is the belly / which noryshe your hearts and
body with riot and lechery / what say you to this? you do here that mete is
ordained for the belly and the belly for mete / yet god will destroy the one with
the other / and yet god shall destroy them both. Therefore let regulars that
be almost utterly decayed for lack of obedyence unto holy rulys take heed and
fear god which ye right wise judge says as here follows. Woe be to you that
be satisfied with fode / for ye shall be a hungered. Woe be to you rich men whose
only comfort is in your riches. Woe be to you that lawghe for ye shall weep and
morn / did not Judas the Apostle write of these things / vomytyng their own
confusyons / to whom an infernal storm of darkness is conseruyd and kept.
Why says the holy Apostle in this manner. They be not only corruptyd and
spottyd in their feasts / but also they be spots and corrupcion / for that
that in their fedyng / many fold sins fallen among them. And like as the
Apostle wrote to certain of the Gentyles that were conuertyd sayng thus. Some
time ye were darkness / for in eating or feadyng they do not only excede in
qualite or quantite of meats or drynkes / but also in vain superfluous and
evil words / I will not say in sklaunderous knanyshe and wanton / in toys /
tryfulles / plays / mockes / mowes / dissolucions / loss of time / and much
more heelnes. The prophet Iohell cries unto such manner of people / saying:
Awake ye dronkardes / and weep / and all you that drink wine for plesaunce and
swetnes / morn ye / for it shall peryshe out of your mouths / furthermore of
glotonye that vycyous mother / folowyth foul lechery a armore vycyous
daughter. Now be not all faithful christen people bound to live straytly in
penytent conversation and ferefully in respect of god above. And the hyer that
regulars be constitute in degree and spiritual estate / so be the more virtuous
/ sobre / and fearful than the lay people. Let no man disceyue himself for god
requires of every man that he shall live according to the degree that he is
called unto. Besides this the longer that an evil custom is vsyd / the more
unjust and incurable it is. And therefore from the first foundation of the
church / holy and blessed fathers have most straytly and vehemently prohibyte
the sin of the fl^^he glotony / dronkennes / and wantones to the minystres of
the church / as of the same / in the decre many things are declared. It is
red also in the rulys of the Apostles / that a bishop / priest / or deane /
given to riot or dronkenes / must other forsake it / or else be condemned and
deposed. A subdeane reder or synger in the church doing the same / must other
cease or be expulsyd from the communion. The same purpose it is brought in /
in the.xxxv. distinction / that especyally dronkenes should be avoided of
clerks / for of all other vices it is the norice and and cherysher. Also in
the counsel of Agathon it was ordained / that a clerk being drunk should be
seueryd from the communion / for the space of.xxx. days / or else corporally to
be ponyshed. And the Apostle in like manner writes to all faithful people and
enioyneth them in this wise. That they live not in glotony and dro^kenes. etc.
And also regard that they use not the desires of the flesh. And again / we be
dettours unto the flesh / not to that intent that we should live after the
flesh / for if we live after the flesh / we should dye.

Another thing there is whereof the most holy Peter the Apostle does us
aduertyse / saying thus: Welbelouyd friends / I beseech you absteyne from
carnal desire / which makyth battle against the soul. Further S Paul sayet
(It behouyth a bishop to be sobre / chaste / and not dronken) perteyneth also
to all men co^stitute in holy ordres / as the holy fathers Ambrosy and
Augustine do witness bysydes all this / it appears by the words of S. Jerome
/ how hard and difficyle it is for him that kepyth not sobrenes / to keep his
chastyte. The princes and minystres of the church / which do walowe in
delicyous pleasure faynynge at feasts that they keep chastyte / be (by the
words of the prophet) worthy to be cast out from fair houses and delycate
bankettes / into exterior darkness / which Jerome says further. The glotony
of the belly prouokyth lechery / and puttyth a part every good wroke and a belly
boylynge with wine sone fallyth to pleasure of the body. For why the belly of
man and the preuy members be very nere one to an other / so that by the
nerenes of those me^bres ye may perceive the more ready inclinacion of vice.
Furthermore as it is mentioned (Leuitici primo) Our lord commaundyd the
prestes of the old law / whose presthode or profession was but carnal and
figuratyue that they should drink no wine nor any thing that might make them
drunk / whose words are these / wine and all that may make you drunk / ye
shall not drink what time ye enter in the tabernacle of the testament lest ye
dye so that ye may have knowledge to dyscerne between the holy and unholy /
How much more this carnalite / dronkenes / glotony / and voluptuousnes / to
be avoided of prestes and ministres of the church / whose presthode is all
together spiritual / and therefore should continually be occupied in divine
service. Therefore louyngly he enbraceth sobrenes / which is the very secreat
keeper of mind / sensys / body / and also members / the defense of chastity /
the governor of shamefastnes the very preseruor both of peace and frendshyppe.
For truly dronkenes in a priest or regular is as heinous as sacrilege / and
also in any other man it is a great vice sobrenes prolongyth the natural life
of man / it noryshyth the life of grace / it deseruyth the life of joy / it
causyth the body of man to be well proporcyoned / and valiant / it makyth a
quiet heart / it makyth redye a man's mind to proceed in wisdom and virtue /
it makyth a man apt to apply divine service / to laud god in hymns and
psalms. And to be only given to holy medytacion. Therefore regulars that are
commaundyd to serve almighty god / and to be contynually given to the
obseruaunce of him must evermore observe this virtue of sobrenes. And as the
most high bishop has straytly commaundyd / that if wives be strong they
must be temperyd unto them / nor in any wise that one provoke another to
drynkyng / but especyally let them beware of such manner of drynkyng / as men
call brynkshyng / pleggynge / and quaffyng / which verily be bestly / and
fowlyshe / for that that may agree with the complexion of the one / may
fortune not to agree with the complexion of the other. And in conclusion to
know how vicyous and out of order it is to excede in the vices foresaid / it
apperyth by that / that the pope commaundyd all such offenders to be suspendyd
from their offices and benefyces / except by warnyng they be r^ce^sylyd. For if
a principal ruler or governor of regulars / will not correer such evil
doers / other if he hymself^ do personally offend (which god forbid) in any
vice before touchyd. O how great and horrible damnacion hangyth over his head /
and also over the hedes o^ such sinful regulars as do offend in the some /
not wyllyng to receive any wholesome disciplyne or lernyng in this present life.

How it is prohibyte to all clerks and ministres of the church to occupye
any marchaundyse: or to excer^yse any temporal offices or cheuysaunce.
The.viii. article.
ACordyng unto the effect of the end / all mean things must be ordryd /
for the end causyth things of necessyte to be done: which be ordained for
the end. And seeing thestate of regulars was institute provided and grauntyd
(as is before expressyd) to the intent that they should apply to the service
of their maker / with a free / pure / and quiet mind / and seeing also that by
their merytes and prayers they should be reconsyled and desire god to be
merciful b^th^ to themself and also to them: by whose alms / charity / and
stypendys they are sustained: for that cause they are forbidden to use any
worldly acts or occupations which should be a vehement let both unto ye
foresaid quyetnes of mind unto their pure profession of god / and also unto
their inward lybertye to dyuyne matters: whereby they should be dyscharged of
all secular and wordly busynes / And these be the same worldly busynes that be
ordained for worldly lucre: that is to wit: worldly marchaundyse and secular
offices by whom the heart of man is greatly dysposyd to outward things is
greatly wrappyd in worldly things. And also with drawn from spiritual and
ghostly things. To the contrary whereof the Apostle says in this wise. None
that seruyth god ought to entangle himself in worldly busynes. Whereof the
bishop Nicasius spoke in the acts of the counsel of Cartage on this
fashyon. I suppose that my suggestion does right well please your holiness: and
partly displease ye: which is / that such as serve god / and annexed to the
clergy / should not meddle in worldly busynes / offices / or stuardshypes of
houses. The holy bishop Gratianus says that this sentence before reherced was
institute of the Apostles / that is to say that / no man mynistryng in the
service of god may fold himself in wordly busynes. And therefore clerks may
be no purchasers of houses and no purchasers of houses may occupye the offices
of clerks. And further to prove these things / it evidently apperyth in
the.xiiii. question. As this / it was establyshed in the statutes of rulys at
the counsel of Tarraco^ / that who so ever would be one of the clergy / he
must not use the study of byenge good chepe and selling dear / and if he did /
he should be correctyd by the clergy. For that purpose also it was institute in
the holy synod of Niceo / that for because many clerks following the foul
lucre of auaryce / do forget the precepts and commandments of god /
therefore that holy counsel did ordeyne this / that is to wit. If any man from
hensforthe were found taking any usury / either following any foul lucre by
any such manner busynes / or puttyng forth any manner of corn for advantage
or going about any such matter of marchaun^^se / for the only lucre and
gaynes thereof / he should then be expulsyd from the clergy: and another of the
church degree to be had in his place. Thereof pope Gelasius speakyth in like
manner saying thus. Clerks know right well: that they ought to absteyne from
such unworthy gaynes: and also to refrain from all craft and covetousness of
any manner of marchaudyse. And of what degree so ever they be that will not
cease to use such lucre: immediately they must be compellyd to forsake their
offices in the church. In the counsel also of pope Martyn it was co^mau^dyd in
this wise If any of them forgetynge the fear of god had done vsurye upon trust
to win but the hundredth part thereof or lokyd for gaymes by any manner of
marchaundyse: or has taken increase: by byeng or sellyng any wine: corn: or
other thing: he should be cast down from his degree and another of the clergy
should have supplied his stead and place. The saying of pope Melchiades
herewith agreyth. The holy general counsel has decreyd: that hereafter no
clerk shall hyre any possessions or intermedel with any worldly busynes:
except it be for the charge and mayntenau^ce of infantes / orphleyns / and
wydowes / or except he were commaundyd by his bishop to take the charges of
any goods longyng unto the church: for the offices spiritual and temporal
are extercyse. But furthermore it apperyth about the end of the third book of
Decretalles in the Lateran counsel: what busynes is prohibit unto clerks.
And thus it is there said. There be many secular busynes of the which we shall
touch part / because unto them all carnal concupiscence apperteyneth. And
what so ever a man that couetyth more tha^ is right: it is called foul lucre /
it is forbidden unto the^ iniustly to take or receive any rewards: to hyre any
man for any worldly gain or pray / to love any contention debate or skoldyng
to plede or dispute in secular plees / except it be for the defense of
orphelyns / or wydowes. They ought to be no doctoures or proctoures of secular
matters: to love no seculer games / or gifts of fylthy acts or communication
/ to delight in dyse / to desire inconvenient apparayle for their estate: to
live in delycyousnes: to walowe in glotony and dronkenes: to haunt: or to
hawk: or to be conuersau^t in any vain or superfluous busynes. Behold how
utterly we prohybyte these things with all other like / unto regulars and
mynysters of the altar of god. In the rulys of the apostles it is ferther of
this matter mentioned after this facion. A bishop / pressed / or decane ought in
nowyse to take upon the^ any secular cure or charge. Pope alexander the third
did also forbid both regulars / and other clerks upon pain of cursynge that
they should make no marchau^dyse for any worldly lucre. Saint Jerome also says
in this manner. Flee and avoid from the company of a clerk being a merchaunt.
Avoid from pouerte to riches / from a mean man to a noble man / as though it
were from a plage of ye Pestilence. Therefore prestes / and clerks be forbidden
/ to be brokers of any secular busynes. All this is confyrmed by pope Nicolas
in the.xxii. chapter of the decree in the third questyo^ saying this. It came
to knowledge at a general counsel that certain of the clergy had taken upon
them secular matters / for the ^^^^le lucre of great possessions (...) by that
holy counsel it was (...) from thensforth no pressed / (...) ^lar should hyre
any poss^^ (...) ^medle with any secular matters or procuratio^s except such as
be called by the law theronto for the defense of such as be within age
orphellynes / or the great necessytes of wydowes / or else if the Bishop has
co^myttyd the governance of the church goods unto them. And therefore /
oftentimes it is touched in the decree that some manner of busynes be unlawful
to be don of all men and that be such as can not be done without time as
vsurye and symonye. And there be some that seldom or very hardly may be done
without sin as the marchaundyse before rehersyd. But now to know wherefore
clerks and other minystres of ye church ought to absteyne from all such
worldly busynes / saint Thomas in the lxxvii. question of his book
co^pendiously touchyth saying thus. Clerks ought not only to abstain from
such things that be evil of them self / but also from such things as have
a savor or color of evil as marchau^dyse has / forby cause it is ordained
for worldly lucre / which clerks utterly ought to despise and contemn.
Seco^daryly for the great hau^t of sin among merchauntes. Thyrdly because
that by marchau^dyse the mind of man is wrappid with warldly carkes and
utterly withdrawn / from godly things To this the holy Martyr and Bishop
Ciprianus notyng the occasyon thereof addyth his mind saying. Such as be
honorid with holy presthode or co^stistute in the service of clerks ought them
self to apply to nothing / but to the altar and sacryfyce of god with holy
and devout prayers / and leccyons. Behold therefore to how virtuous / quiet and
spiritual life and good example regulars be bound which be co^maundyd to
absteyne not only from evil and vice it self / but also from all spyce of
evil and occasyon of sin / in like manner from all sensual affection / from
the plesures of this world / from all pomp and worldly garnyshynge / mekely
also and lowly from all vain and superfluous acts plays tryfulles / or
games. And furthermore they be commaundyd in no wise to give audyence to
mynystrelles / gestours / or dysardes / to play at dyse / or cards / or to be
present at such games as shore plainly in the Article following is declared.

For what cause Clerks / Regulars / and other co^stitute in holy ordres ought
to refrain fro mynstrelles Iesters and dysardes / tauernes / and eke the play
of Cards an Dyse. The.ix. Article.
IT is convenient for mynystres of the church (whom it behouith to dyfferre
from the life and manners of secular me^) to be ripe in good manners and
dysposicyon / to give dylygence unto contricyon and to the fere of god / in
like manner to apply them self unto prayer / psalmodyes with other actis of
penance in the sight of almighty god / to the intent that lhey may please and
satisfy god / as well for their own excess and sin / as for the offenses of
their fou^dars and benefactours. Therefore they are co^maundyd to beware of
such things as will them dysceuer from contrition remorse of conscience and
deuotyon / and such as will enduce imperfect living and engendre worldly
condicyons / as these be / that is to say / famylyarite / excercyse / games /
and dissportes of mynstrelles / Iesters / and dyssardys / hau^tynge of tauerns
feasts and bankettes / play nge at dyse and cardys / whereunto many enorme
vices be annexed / and so it proceeds of the love and desire of money and
concernyth auarcyte. But furdermor that it may be more depely plai^ly an surely
notyfied / after what facyon it is lawful for regulars and mynystres of the
church some time to play / and what manner of disport is comely for them / that
is to be notyd that saint Thomas wrytyth in his secounde destinctions. Dura^dus
also in his book called summa. Johan in his book called summa co^fessoru^ / and
other are of the same opinion saying thus. Like as a man nedyth corporal
refresshyng / rest / and sleep / forbycause he is not able to labor
contynually / right so the soul has need of recreacyon and comfort / which
must be done by some words or actis where nothing is intendyd or required but
only spiritual delectacion and pleasure. And these be called wordys or acts
of pastyme / and dysport concerning whom / three things are princypally to be
observed. The first is this. That no such delectacyo^ be required / by words
or actis inhonest fylthy or hurtefull to any man. The secunde is that the
grauyte and devotion of har^^ may in nowyse be resoluyd by any such game The
third is that ye game may agree both with the person / time / and place and
also yt the^ game be garnysshed with other circumstaunces of virtue. And truly
that virtue wherewith a man may so conuenie^tly behave himself / in games or
plays / is (after the mind of the philosophour in the fourth book of Ethykes)
called. Furdermore if there be any foul or fylthy wanton hurtefull / or
sklaunderous words / or acts exersysed in such games / or plays. It is a
great sin and oftentimes a sin mortal / although perauenture the play of
it self / be but a sin venyall. Now here we may perceue / with whom / what
time / and after what facyon it is lawful for Regulars and other mynystres of
the church to play. Such may play after the manner and facyon forseyd / as do
co^syst in good exersyse both of spiritual and temporal things / so that
therewith they do not them self ouermych defatigate and make weary. But the same
liberty is not given unto them that be full of babbling and Idelnes / which
contynually do move lawghter and wyldnes which also do haunte bankettes / and
in them excede both in communicacion mockes gestis outragyousnes and
intemperancye and also in all other immoderate co^ceites. Therefore the
mynystres of the church do greatly offend / and deserve intolerable
punysshement / especyally regulars and such as are constitute in holy ordres /
which should be every day very ready to do such things as perteigne to the
service of god / and spedely perform their hours and times of prayer /
hastily putting them self forward in dyuyne service. But in the stead thereof
they do dylygently fulfill such things as may please the carnal carcas /
fedynge it gorgeously and delycately delytynge in many praty several toys. And
furthermore when their belyes be full or at other vacaunt times / they apply
the^ self other to gestes and tryfulles or else to that / that is more enorme
and out of the way / as to play at cardis and dyse / or being in presens where
such games be used comonyng / talking / and being in great favor or
famylyarite with the players / beryng many times half part whith the^ / in
there wynnyng or losing.

Certainly these men have no reasonable cause to play but rather in such t^m^
as they do play they ought to bewa^^ their sin / and the time that they have
spent in all such vain recreations / idelnes / tales / fables / laugh^^rs /
vnfruytfully / ye and to say the treuth vycyously / and also to morn and make
amends accordyngly / for all their necglygens and defautes which they have
commyttyd in not performynge their dyuyne service. But these manner of persons
are only given to their games and dysportes / and as for their devotion and
perfytnes of heart (if peraue^ture they had any before) it is altogyther seueryd
and corruptyd.

O god lord how perilous is the life of such men / ye how wicked and damnable
which (being bound after dinner and supper done / to return to their chambres)
or to go in to their studyes or libraries / there to be given (as Cipriane
says) to holy redynge to wholesome doctrine and devout meditation) will utterly
show the^ self unto vtward things / and stobburnly dyspose them self to
carnal and wordly pleasure / diverse manner of wise lesynge and in spending
that precyouse time / that god has grauntyd unto them / nothing regardyng that
thing that they are ^alled unto / another dysclosyng their conscyens before god
/ nor yet at any time dewly and effectually ponderynge / how great and manyfold
things they are bound unto. Of such persons saint Bernard the elect servant
of god spekyth thus. The neclige^t slacknes of clerkys troblyth and molestyth
the church of god throughout all the world / surely they are enryched by other
menes labor / they ete the fruits of the earth without money or charge and
devour ye labors of ye poor a man's mind accustomed with delycyousnes / and
barreigne of learning must needs enge^dre many vices. How many (I pray you)
shall we se the which do not serve nor obey Christ as their lord and god but
their wombes as their lord and god / and verily fornycacio^ rayneth in many of
them / which mynistryng unto the maker and encreaser of all clennes and
chastyte / with a fylthy mouth and an unclean heart / do not fere the angel of
god sta^dynge nere unto them / which may destroy and cute the^ atwo in the
myddyll. Furdermore as Duradus in his book called summa procidith saying.
Every manner of play yt is applied unto chance or fortune (as the play at dyse
is) may not be used for money / except six things be aggreabble with the same.
The first is / couenyence of person / for it is not lawful for clerks to
play at dyse / wherefore let a common dyser / or vsurar be put back from
obtaynyng spiritual dygnite / notwithstanding there be a custom to the
contracy as apperith in the title Extra de excess.i. Inter dilectos. yet never
the les the benefyce being obteigned / the bishop may owe him favor / if
he will be corrected / otherwise of right be ought to be deposyd / for
otherwise / he ought by the law to be deposyd as aperith in the.xiiii. question
in the title. Siquis and caritas. The secunde is conuenyence of martyer or
substance for some manner of wise they may play for meat / or drink /
supposing their game always to be commendable as is before expressyd / so yt it
be not inte^dyd but as reasonable solace and no lucre. The third is the
co^clusyon thereof / that is to say / that it be not exercysed for couertyse or
avarice but for recreacyon. The fourth is / measure / for no man may play above
a shyllynge / although the player be very rych as it appears in the
beginning of the title / de religiosis. The fyftyth is time co^uenie^e so yt
the play be not done in time of morning penance or counsel. The.vi. is ye
conuenience of the facyon and manner so that your play be without dys^eyte / and
no man do any thing against the law of the game / nor one provoke another to
play. Clerks falling in to so great blyndnes wyckednes / and fra^sye may
well note this / that notwithstanding their holy rulys and decrees / they be
bold and presumptuous to dyse openly / and for that foul desire of lucre /
they play at cards and dyse like as it were secular ga^sters / where yet not
withstanding they are bound to make restitucyon of their wynnyng or else to
co^uerte it into some other charitable use otherwise they may not be sauyd nor
yet absoluid by sacraments There be also so many and so heinous offenses
co^sistyng in such manner of play / which raymu^dus hostiensis Johan and other
does reherce / and paue^ture within this book somewhat towchid / let the^
therefore repent the^ like wrechyd creaturis / let the^ po^der their dredful
judgment and also ye torments of hell intolerable: which sone afterward they
will incure without remedy / except they do not only forsake their abhominacion
/ but also do suffer co^digne penance.

An introduction of diverse wholesome considerations whereby we may perceue that
all feythfull Christen people / especyally mynystres of the church are bound to
despise all vanyte and superfluite of plays dysportes and other vain
delectations. The.x. Article.
LIKE as the holy Apostle Saint Petre wyttnessythe. Our savior Christ
suffered for us / leuynge example to follow his steps. Therefore who so says
that he dwellyth in Christ he must walk as Christ walked. For members ought
to be conformable unto their head. And forsothe it is radde that Christ in this
present world / did syghe morn weep and was trowblyd in spirit but he never
played lawghyd nor made dysport. For that cause we are bound (as much as the
fragylyte of humane nature will permyt and suffer us) to follow his perfytnes
grauyte and dylygence as by his own co^maundment apperyth in this wise. He
that will be my servant let hem follow me. And fordermore.

The first introduction to despise voluptuosnes vanite as slacknes is the
co^sideratcyon of the life and conversation of Christ / which said unto his
dysciples in this manner. I gave you example / that as I did / you should do /
holy saint Hierome affyrmyth the same saying thus / it is impossible to rejoice
of this world / and after to reign with Christ. To ye same Solomon said in
this wise. I reputed lawghyng as an error / and say unto Joy / why art thou
deceoyd in vain.

The secounde introduction is the consideration of the place of this present
life For we be in this world as though we were in a great exyle / in a vale of
lamentacyon in a cotage of calamyte / in a religion of the shadow of death in a
feygned Kingdom in a pilgrimage in a worn way and in a prison.

Therefore me think it against all wisdom in such a place to desire to swyme
in delycyousnes / to be let slyppe among vanytees / to be refresshid with
lawghter and dysportes / ye and he that in this would couetythe to be
prosperous in riches pleasure and honor shewyth him self in so doing to be no
Pilgrim / nothe^ the lover of the heavenly country / but a ^ys^syne and / sone
of babylon / a servant of imquite / a man in the way of perdycyo^.

Thereof spekyth the Prophet Jeremy saying thus. O thou wandrynge and wicked
daughter / unto the time that thou be losyd and dissoluyd from delycyousnes /
my soul refusyth all comfort. And also this of the prophet David woe is me that
my dwelling place is prolongyd.

And the Apostle wytnessyth of the holy Prophets of the old testament and of
ye law of nature in this manner / that they confessyd to be Pylgrymmes and
estraungers upon the Earth. Therefore from this present exile we should oftentimes
very fervently syghe unto that most glorious country of blessed men / and
these worldly joys we should abhore / as though they were the very carppis of
everlasting death / that we might say as the apostle said. God forbid that I
should rejoice in any thing except in the cross of my lord Jesus Christ by
whom the world of me is persercuted / and I of the world.

The third is the consideration of daungere i^ whom we be put at large. For we
do walk and be always co^uersaunt in the myddys of gynnys / and i^ a fylde
every where fully compassed with a multitde of innumerable inuisib^e most cruel
and crafty enemies of this world whose power and furor very few do escape. And
truly we be vncerteigne whether our conversation do please god or no / or
whether finally we shall be damned / or whether our ofte^ces shall be forgyuen.
And also we know that grievously and many manner of wise we dysplease our most
strait and fereful judge and that daily we offend being also very prove and
ready to vice. Al such things if we deuly consydre / it shall please us better
to morn and lament than to make dysportes and plays. And also we shall say as
Solomon said. Better it is to go to the house of lame^tacyon tha^ to the house
of pleasure and solace. In the one house that is to say in the house of morning
/ the end of all mortal men is notyd / and a man living should ponder what
is to come.

The fourth is the co^sideracyon of all evil and myschyef as well of offense
as of pain and ponyshement that every day is done in the world (that is to
say) because so many great and myscheuous acts be contynually done in the
world / by cause our maker a mighty of his creaturs at all time is had in
small honor and reverence / because contynually so many souls do eternally
perysshe / because so many and great tribulac^^^^ calamytes / penury discomfort
/ oppressions / do incessauntly chance our friends / neighbors / and membris of
Christ of whom (if we love them) we must have compassyon / as we would that thy
should have compassyon of us being in like case / surely who so does this
dewly ponder / he will say as Ieremye said.

Who will give to my head / water / and to mine eyes a fountain of teres / and I
will weep evermore. And seeing Samuel so long time and so sorrowful bewailed
Saull / and Ieoronne the destruccyon of Jerusalem. Paul also some of the
Corinthis / how much more is our forsets myschiefe to be bewaylyd. Therefore
let us have co^passyon of our neighbors being in great danger and dyscomfort.

The.v. is the multitude and greatness of harm and dyspleasure / that such
delectacions bryngyth unto man. For they spoil a man from all grace / which
delectacyons also brought Solomon in to great folly. And attempted Eve to the
tra^sgressyon of gods co^maundment / they do vehemently blind the mind of man
and harden and maynteyne him in myschief ye they procure everlasting
damnation. For that thing wherein a man delytyth is but of short time his
vexacyon and troble therefore is perdurable.

What man for the pleasure of one night / will be glad ever after to lie i^ a
bre^nyng furnace. O wherefore presume we to commyt mortal sin where for one
sin mortal we must be ponyssed with the fervent infernal pains that
evermore do endure. The syxth is vylenes fylthynes and bestly pleasure of the
flesh / for the which / man is most despised of god and made unlike to
angels / and conformable to bestes / wheruppon the saying of the Prophet
Iohel concerning carnal desire is expoundyd on this facyon. The herdes of
bestys did rotte and consume in their own fylthynes and dunge.

And as the Prophet David says in like manner. A man that perceuyth not wha^ he
is in honor / may be compared unto brute and rude bestes / furdermore much
bytternes is mengled with the pleasure of the world and the flesh / such
pleasure also is oftentimes acquisyte / and gotten both with great expensys and
dau^gere / prepared with sore labor / and yet they repent at lenght. Therefore
Solomon says youth and voluptuousnes be but vany^c^s. And forther ^his he
said. I will go and swyme in delight and walow in riches / and yet I perceuyd
that all was but vany^e. Therefore in this present life grant to us to take
repentance / let us endeuer our self unto the ac^es of penance / let us also
ever absteigne from wildnes of heart vanyte / and obstynate lyberte.

Of co^uenyent apparayle of mynystres of the church / espcyally of regulars /
and of their manyfold excess in garments and of the desire thereof to be
avoided. The.xi. Article.
THE more virtuous yt the mynystres of the church are bound to be in respect
of ye lay people / the more simple meke and full of good example they ought to
be in their apparayle.

They ought in like manner to observe ye thing that is red in the book of
Ecclesiasticus that is to say. Thou shall not rejoice at any time in thine
apparayle especially in such manner of apparayle as may give evil occasyon or
pleasau^tly intyse or move the eyes or hearts of women that behold it (that is
to say) they be always bound to beware of curiouse arayment and ^ompous
apparayle. And where also holy fathers as Jerome and Chrysostom and other do
not only testyfye this of the^ but also of every faithful creature saying
thus. A man or a woman garnysshynge themself / and by their deckyng and
trymmi^g prouokyng the eyes of other upon them although thereof no myschyef does
ensue yet he or she so doyeng shall suffer eternal ponyssheme^t / because they
did put forth poison / if there had be any man yt would have drunk it that is
to say they did shewforth temptacyon if any man would have be attempted. If this
abhomynacyon be so detestable among the lay people / it is much more mischeuous
among the ministres of the church / which princypally be bound to edify
other creatures in virtue. Therefore (seeing they go so gorgeously) deckid as
though it were a bride we may say as saint Bernard said behold how they go
garnyshyd like to a bryd yt were coming forth of her wedding chamber /
insomych that if ye se any such far from you / ye would rather judge it to be
the bryde than the pressed that should her marye. Surely according to the
doctrine of holy fathers then be as well commaundyd to be contentyd with simple
apparayle / as with simple fare. Thereof the holy Apostle says thus. Be ye in
no wise conformable unto this world / but be ye renewed in ye spirit of your
mind Therefore a regular or a pressed ought to beware of al curyosyte / pomp /
superfluyte vanyte / and wantones of al worldly garments / as the holy
Doctors and Prelates / Basilius / Isidorus and other / have us informed. But
now concerning this matter / the rulys and estatutes which sprange by the
divine inspiracyon should be consyderyd. For why it is red in the seventh synod
/ and also in the.xxi. decre as here folowyth. All braggyng / ruffli^g and
garnysshynge is the thing that is most far from holy order / and it
behouyth such Bysshopes and Clerks which dress them self in bright glorious
and plesau^t apparayle / to amend it / for if they remayn in weryng thereof
they shall be put to penance. In semblable wise al such manner of men that use
oynteme^tes such cursyd people also which have the^ in derysyon that be
clothed in pore and relygyous ornaments / shall be correctyd by emprisonment. In
the old time verily a holy man (that is to say) a man constytute in holy
ordres did led his life being coueryd with a very vile and mean garment.
And truly every garment that is not taken for necessyte / but for co^lynes (as
Basilius says) has a spyce of pride: moreover Pope zacharye did instytute
this that folowyth. Bishops Prestes and Decanes may were no secular apparayle
/ but garments conuenyent for their order. They may not presume to walk in
any cite comyne way or street without their cowlys or couerynges except it be
in some long iornay / for like as a woman prayeng in the church bareheded /
according unto the saying of thapostle does dishonest her own head even so
prestes or regulars wandrynge abrod without their cowles or other upper
garments dyshonest their Presthod and relygyon / wherefore it is ordained yt if
any of them do stobbornly presume to transgress the said institutes / that he
should be expulsyd from the relygyous congregation / unto the time that he had
fulfillyd such things that were ordeigned by the same estatutes for the same
purpose. Innocentius the second aggreeth with the same saying thus we command
that as well bysshope / as prestes and clerks shall the^ self endeuer to
pacifye god and man / both in their spiritual estate and also in their corporal
behauour / and not in superfluyte cuttyng gardyng or color of garments /
another they shall offend or hurt by their shauyng the aspecte of the beholders
whose rule and example they ought to be / but rather they should observe holiness
which would much better be come them. Here also says saint Bernard. That it is
the sin of sacryledge / where as the goods of pore people be not dystrybute
/ unto them. For the ecclesyastical goods be the patrymonye and heritage of
the poor people. And what someuer the mynystres of the church do take besydys
their simple and necessary fode and apparayle it is vyolently stolen from the
poor people as cruel sacryledge And god ordained not that such as mynystre the
gospel / should thereby desire riches or apparaile / but that they should be
contentyd to live with necessary fode and apparaile / and not to seek
prouocatio^ unto pleasure of the body / not to receive such apparayle wherewith
they might be tri^myd / but such wherewith they might be coueryd. But now when
a man may be contentyd with such a necessary lyui^g what creature in this
world would enter in to relygyon to the intent that he would gather together keep
and dyspend the srypendes of the clergy in to uses of pleasure curyosyte and
vanyte. Hereof again spekyth that blessed saint Bernard saying thus. The
nakyd and hung^y do cry and complayn on this facyon.

What auaylyth unto us miserably vexid with hungre and cold / the great chaung
of garments that lie in pressys and are eten of Mothis. It is ours that ye
consume and wast / it is cruelly stolen from us / that ye vnprofytably and
wyckidly dyspend. O ye curyous and delectable persons ye have wherewith we
might be refressyd / and we pore people can not find wherewith we should be
susteigned. And furdermore god most ryghtwyse and sapyent made al wordly
goods co^myn to every man having need / and that every man should
conuenyently use them according to his estate / so that as towchynge / the
use / all temporal goods should be in commune / although that concerning the
right and title of possessynge and dyspensynge of them / some men have
propertye in some goods.

And as saint Thomas affirmyth in his book called Secunda secu^de / in this
manner what soever any man superfluously conuerscyth to his own use / or what
so ever he reseruyth nygardly / or geteth immoderately / he stelyth it away
from the poor people / and incurryth the sin of thief or robbry / ye and the
daungere of other grievous cruelte as Wilhelmus parisiensis and Vlrichus does de
wyttnesse and declare. For this purpose also ye blessed father Ambrose makyth
protestacyon of that thing that is had in the decre in the xxvii. distinction /
in the chapitre beginning sicut hi / i^ this manner of wise whether god be so
just / so inequalle to distribute the subsydyes and sustynaunce of life (that
is to say) that thou shuldyst be rych and abundaunt and other very pore and
nedy? Or did he suffer it to be so / to then sent that thou myghtes have a
proof of his lyberalyte / and to glorify another thorugh the virtue of
patience or sufferaunce / but thou therefore receiuynge the gifts of god / and
bestowyng them to thy nowne use / thynkyst thou do nothing iniustly / if thou
alone do obteygne or reserve the substance of life of many creaturys. O what
creature can find in is heart to be so uncharitable and so covetous to dyspende
the noryshement of so many pore people / not only to his own pryuate use / but
also to his great habundaunce delight and pleasure. And truly it is no less
sin to take away from him that has / than to deny the nedy when a man is
habundaunt and may give.

That thou witholdyst / is the fode and bred of them that be hu^gry. Thine
apparayle that thou putyst up is the clothyng of them that be naked. Thy money
which thou hydyst in the earth / and dyst enclose in thy cofer is the very
redemption of men being in calamyte mysery and captyuyte. Therefore thou may
know how thou walowyst in the goods of other men / and how prosperous thou
art in respect of them / and yet wylt not leave or depart with them / with this
thing especially ye saying of Basilius aggreith. If thou wylt confess that
the temporal riches came to thy hands by the gift of god / shall god therefore
be reputed unjust / for dystrybutynge the goods unto us / not indeffere^tly /
by cause thou have to much and another has to little. Nay but to thente^t
that thou shuldyst obteigne of a just dispensatour and that they neybour should
be rewardyd for his pacyence it is the bread of the hungry that thou
withholdyst the cote of the bare that thou kepest in preuey chamber / the shoe
of the bare fore that rottyth in thy house / the money of the nedy that thou
posse^^^t in the earth and cofers. Therefore thou doste great injury to so many
poor people as thou art able to give or lend unto Let my masters the regulars
and mynystres of the church to whom one benefyce is not competent and
sufficient / mark well this. Let such note and consydre the necessyte of the
poor people / that have so many precious garments and furs lyeng in their
chambers / that make their gold and silver their god / and treasour that
voluptuosly and sumptuosly do aldayes of their life consume and wast it. Let
them look how they can make account thereof unto the high judge of heaven /
whose members they daily suffer to perysshe by hungre / thyrst / nakydnes / and
cold to whom also they give another harborow nor beddynge. Thereof also it is
spoken in the book called. S^mma virtutum et vitioru^ in this wise. Mynystres
of the church do greuou^ly and many manner of ways offend in their apparayle.

First in the excedyng precyousnes there of. Secondaryly in tenderness. Thyrdly
in curyousnes. Fourthly in superfluy^e thereof. For as blessed Johan the Baptyst
says who so has two cofes that is to say / one that he has no need of / let
him give it to one that has none.

Therefore trymmyng / and deckynge / apparayle is to be avoided of regulars and
mynystres of the church / which before is towchid in the fourth chapitre that
they should were close garmetes not over long nor short / and also there it is
prohybyte that in no wise they may were red or grene clothe except in their
orname^tes perteynyng to dyuyne service. Furdermore it is red among the
miracles of gloryouse saint Jerome that a certain cardynal named Andreas being
deed should have been eternaly condemned / except saint Jerome by intercessyon
had obteigned the restoryng again of the body unto the soul / to do penance
and satysfaccyon in this present life / and especyally forbycause he
meruelowsly excedyd in his apparayle yet notwithstanding otherwise he was a
very chaste and clean man and also endyd with many goods and commendable
virtues.

That in no wise women may dwell with regulars or mynystrers of the church
co^stitute in holy ordres except they be very old and nere of kynrede.
The.xii. Article.
EXPERIENCE is the mastres of truth. Therefore what nedyth it manifoldly to
prove that thing that experyence shewith. For evidently it apperyth by good
proof / how many and enorme myschefes how / hurtefull occasyons how great
ruin and dyfformyte (worthy to be lamented) have sprung by the reason of the
cohabytacyon and dwelling of women with prestes and regular persons in so much
that now from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot there is in a
manner no health (that is to say) from the highest unto the lowyst in a manner no
clennes or chastyte. But it is as the prophet Ozeas has prophesyed. That
fornicacyon and aduoutry has swymmyd al about whereby it apperith how
dangerous such cohabytacions is and worthy to avoid / with how great reason
also and discrecyon / holy fathers Popes / bysshopes / and other in many
general cou^celles have the same prohybyted. And truly the more straytly and
vehemently that it is prohybite unto high and noble prelates the more
dysobedyence contempt and necligence is in them if it be not avoided. Therefore
certain decrees of the general councelles of popes / bysshopes and other be
very necessary to be touchyd and spokyn of to declare how sagely / holy and
dyscrete fathers have abhorryd / prohybyte and utterly excludyd this for said
cohabytacyon / or dwelling with women. It is read that concerning this matter
/ it was fully provided at the counsel of Magu^tyne. That no pressed or clerk
should keep or retain any women whereby evil suspicyon might be had between
them / nor yet such manner of women as their rulys wole grant them / that is to
say / that mother / aunte / or sister / for by the the instygacyon of the devil
it has be perceuyd that abhomynable offense has be don with them / or else
with their waytyng maidens. But the straytnes of this decree was afterward
somewhat losyd as touching very old women and nere kynnysfolke upon whom
nature or age will not suffer any synnyster act to be suspectyd. Hereuppon
Innocentius the third writing to a certain bishop says. That ye ought not to
suffer women to inhabit with clerks except such (as before is said) in whom
the law of nature will no evil suspecte. Thereto also the blessed Pope Gregori
says in this wise / we will and forbid that clerks prestes or regulars be not
conversant nor dwelling with women / except with their mother / sister / or
such other. It is red and also dyscussyd in the regystre that blessed Augustyne
did not agree that one should be in house with his own suster saying thus.
Such as be with my sister be not my systers. Therefore that understanding of so
great a lernyd man ought to be an instruccyo^ unto us. Saint Gregori says
again that it is declared in the decree in the.lxxxi. dystynccyon / how it
behouyth that prestes (to whom the people of god be commyttyd) do substa^cyally
atte^d upon their lords flock that it be not deuowryd of deuylls another I
ought to keep silence i^ th^^ thing that I do show unto you with great
lame^tacyon and sadness. For I do perceue prestes inhabityng with women / which
is an abhomy^able thing to be hard or spoken of and contrary to the ^^^tutes of
their holy rulys and ordynaunces For look where such cohabytacyon is / there
lackyth no prouacatyon o^ atte^ptyng of our enymye the devil. Therefore they
ought to be seuerid let the tr^wde of the invisible enemy discrye them ^o that
(according to the words of the Apostle) our service may not be despys^d / for
he says thus. We pres^es ought to be wate of all unlawful acts / that we may
lift up clean hands unto a^myghty god (which says) be you holy for I am holy
And truly if any man presumyth to do contrary / let him be excludyd from the
honor of presthode. Furdermore it is induced in the acts of the general
counsel of Nice in this wise. Above al thing the general council forbyddeth
that it is not lawful to any bishop / pressed / decan or subdecon / nor to any
other in the clergy to have or keep any woman in his house (that is to say) to
inhabyte or dwell with any woman (as Eratianus expoundyth in the Rubrikes)
except with the mother / sister or aunte or with such persons as will avoid
suspycyon. The beray same thing was co^maundyd in the Council of Carthago for
there Scirietus then Pope said. We will suffer no other women to be in the
houses of clerks but such as the holy counsel of Nice has suffered to
inhabyte with them / for certain causes only of necessyte. Moreover holy
fathers did not only prohybyte cohabytacyon with women / but also suspectyous
visitacyon and co^munycacyon with them. This al ^^s conteigned in the syxth
synod or ^^uncell. It is convenient to be obseruyd of al clerks / that they
never common and talk with a woman except at a couenyent time and place / to
the intent that all myscheuous suspycyon may be avoided. Surely no manner of
religyon may permyt and suffer them to come to gether alone. This is also
rehearsed in the syxth council Affrykan. Clerks or chaste men may in no wise
resort to wydowes or virgyns except by the commandment of bysshopes or
prestes / and yet they shall not alone / but they shall go with their clerks or
with other which the bishop or pressed him self may not unto women alone resort
for fere of suspeccyo^. Therefore pope Luttus says. A clerk shall not go alone
without his superiors co^mandme^t unto the house of a woman. And a pressed and a
woman may in no wise talk to gether alone. Nor the Archedecane may under the
color of humylyte or of his office / oftentimes enter into the howses of
women / nor send any thing to the good wife preuely by their scolers / or
howsehold servants. For if that be co^myttyd and known / he shall be deposyd
from his office. And she shall be suspendyd from the graces of the church.
Therefore because prestes are suffered to cohabyte and dwell with women that be
of their kynrede / it is to be supposed that no other prohybytyd women ought to
inhabyte with their kynneswomen.

And for that cause prestes and regulars cohabytyng with their mothers or
kynneswome^ must take heed that no estra^ge women dwell with their kynneswomen
except they be very old and agyd.

Seeing also this cohabytacyon is so straytly prohybyted / that no priest or
clerk although he were chaste in deed ought such cohabytacyon to admyt for any
hope of temporal advantage which thing he will surely fulfill / if he have
any pressed or person relygious under him which he ought to ouersee.

And altough it vere sure / that he should never be prouyd of the part of the
women yet it ought to be serched / lest ye woman be prouyd of his part.

That chastity of body and clennes of heart do pryncypally become prestes and
regulars. The.xiii. Article.
SVRE it is / that no man may please God or obtain bliss / without clennes of
heart insomych / that our savior says. Blessybed they that be clean of heart
for they shall se the face of god. Whereof also Solomon says. He that louyth
clennes of heart shall have a king to his friend. Where of in like manner the
Apostle said / unto the king of worlds immortal and inuisyble on this fasyon.
Every feythfull Christen man is bound to chastyte / other virgynall /
conjugal / or viduall / or to such chastyte that is abstynence from all
unlawful congressyon. Furdermore the mynystres of the church be many ways
bound unto Chastyte.

First because in their first consceration / or promotion to holy ordres /
they have straytly by vow and promise bound themself unto chastyte. And as it
is copyously declared in their decree. No man ought to be promotyd unto
presthode / nor yet to take upon him any holy ordres that be inferyor unto
presthode / except he do promise and vow chastyte / and that chastyte is not
only vtwardly promised / but also inwardly / insomuche that they bynd them
self to observe all the holy rulys and decrees of the same.

For verily a vow does more substauncyally bynd / than an oath / as saint
Thomas in his book called Secu^da secunde. Ioannes Bartholomeus and other / do
wyttnesse / and as Alexander / Bonauentura and other / that do write upon the
fourth book of ye sentence sayen. A vow by relygyous professyon and taking of
holy ordres / is solemnyzed and made very solemn in effect which also
strongly byndyth a man to the performyng thereof and likewise unto spiritual
co^ursacyon in so much that it does not only prohibyt and let them to contracte
matrymony / but also dissolueth and breakyth that matrimony that is already
contracted / for in such a solemn vow a man promyseth not only to do well
and eschew evil / but also he must fulfill his vow in seuerynge himself from
wordly and carnal things and also in applyenge dyuyne and spyrytuall things.
Therefore prestes regulars and other in the taking of holy ordres they give and
offer them self to god / to the intent that they wy^l do him feythful and
dylygent service / and therefore they be consecrate to their maker / and
ordained to be his mynystres. The violent taking and usurping of other men's
goods / is theft / if it happen to be done preuely. And truly robbrye openly
done and also the abusyon of holy things is called sacrylege. Also robbynge or
spoylynge of things consecrate unto god may be very well judged sacrylege.
Therefore prestes and mynystres of the church doing fornycacyon do commit
sacryledge / sacryledge: ye sacryledge and high robbrye / in withdrawynge them
self from the service of god / from the acts of clennes / and shameful
obeyeng and geuyng them felfe to al manner of foul stynkyng and abhomynable
vice and carnal desire. Wherefore if stelyng or robbyng of a chaleys be an
horrible theft and sacryledge much more abhomynable is the spoylynge or
corruptyng of a reasonable creature offeryd / consecrate and given unto god /
as prestes be. Secondaryly chastyte pryncypally belongs unto mynystres of the
church / for this cause. For as holy Dionisius says. The lowest of high
order / and the highest of the lower order owght to be agreeable and like / now
the lowest of the high hyerarchy or order is the company of holy aungeles. And
the highest in the lower order of the church mylytaunt is the order of prestes
and clerks wherefore the prophet Malachie callyth a priest by the name of
angel / for it is said. The lyppys of a priest does keep learning / and the
people: shall look for their law out of his mouth / for he is the aungel of
the lord of hosts. Prestes therefore and Clerks are bound to live purely / and
chastely like aungeles / but they against all ryghtwysnes do mordynatly sin /
ledynge their life in carnal fylthy and bestly desire. Thyrdly because they be
in the place and stead of god / and as the vicars of god. Therefore they are
straytly bound to live godly / and not bestly and fylthylye / or else they do
grievously offend against the charity of god. Fourthly forby cause they be set
in high dygnyte and had in greatter honor for ye love of god / therefore they
ought to be acceptable to god / and to serve him in cle^nes. Fyfthly forby
cause they may please god reconsyle other unto god / and clence the^ that be
unclean / therefore they are bound to please god with chastyte and clennes. And
where saint Bernard says woe be to the children of the devil which not
being reconsyled themself / has take upon them the office to reconsyle other
/ as though it were people that had done ryghtwysnes. And also the apostle
affyrmyth the same saying thus. They that be in flesh (that is to say) they
that live carnally can not please god In the book also of Ecclesiasticus thus
it is said. Of an unclean thing what may be made clean. And in the.xii.
chapter of the prophet Naun. It is written thus. The prestes were clensyd and
than they made clean the people. The syxte forby cause they do take / handell /
and receue holy things / ye that thing that is holy of all holy / which
says himself. I am the living bread that descendyd from heuyn. And
furdermore if it were so straytly prohybyt in Moises law that no unclean person
should ear o^ferre or thouche any fleshly / or bestly sacryfyce / how cursyd
and myscheuous be they before the face of god / which do take handell and put
forth to other / the very body / and blood of our savior Christ and only
begotten son of god / and yet they remayn in their abhominacion living
wyckedly and fylthyly / and geuyng evil occasyon to other / did not god by the
mouth of Moises command that no pressed should presume to mynistre unto god
except he were sanctyfyed. And also that a man being unclean should not
offerre bred unto god. And in a another place a corrupt soul which had eten of
the sacrifice of good creatures should peryishe from among the people. And
ferther i^ the first book of kings in the.xxi. chapter it is red that a
bishop said unto David i^ this wise. I have no vnhalowyd bred / but only holy
bred / and if the children and servants be clean (especyally from women) let
them eat it / ye the prestes of the old law in the time of their office / and
sacryfyce were commaundyd to absteigne from their lawful wives.

Therefore how great myschyefe cursydnes and vnshamfastnes is among prestes and
clerks which (walowyng in their foul and abhomynable fylthynes) do ha^dell
the most worthy and precious sacraments. Does there not (think you) ha^ge over
their heedes an infynyte and more than a paynfull ponyshment? God knowyth. The
seventh is forbycause they be the eyes in the mystycal body of the hole church
and truly a little spot or offense is very hurtefull to the eye. The eyghte
forbycause they be the glass into whom the lay people should dyrecte their
eyes / which glass ought to be very clean and bright. The.ix. is because the
carnalyte of them is so abundau^t / to the great iniurye / and contempt of
almighty god / and geuyth so evil occasyon unto the people and also is more
hurtful than can be supposed unto all such offenders / for it blyndyth and
hardenyth them in vice and in conclusyon damneth them. It makyth also such
vile and cursyd creaturs / to be despised dysdayned and hated both of god and
man. Furthermore after the meaning of Wilhelmus Parisiensis and other doctors
/ such mynystres have no right to the goods of the church which be deputed to
the members and sowdyars of Christ. And what soever they do usurp and spend of
the patrymonye of Christ it is very theft and robbrye. They be also straytly
bound to restytucyon of all such goods as they dyspend among bores or
harlottes or other fylthy persons / behold therefore how sinful and
dangerous the life of wanton and lecherous mynistres is. Therefore let them
refrayn from the snares and gynnes of the dyuell / let the^ also fear the
great hepe of peril and danger that hangyth over them or else we may say to
them as it is said in scripture. The people be without counsel and wisdom /
would to god they would wax wise and understand / that they might prepare to
avoid danger in time o come.

Of the peril and improuydence of prestes and regulars dwelling with women /
gathered out of the sayenges of many holy men. The.xiiii. Article.
THEy do sin mortally (as saint Augustine says) which put forth them self to
strife or debate. And truly that man does clean contrary to wisdom (wheru^to
we be bound as well as to charity and justice) which presumyth to pa^se nyghe a
bridge / from the which scantly one among an hundredth has escaped without
falling in / or drowni^g. In this case what man can say / but he did beray
folysshly and was very barreigne of wisdom / to put hymfelfe in so great
ieoperdy much rather may vnsha^fast prestes or regulares be countyd foles which
contrary to their law will cohabyt and dwell with women from whom sca^tly one
among a thousand shall escape without great peril and daungere. And if
peraue^ture some do fortune to eschew the soul and fylthy act it self very
few can escape unclean imagynacyon evil prouocacion unlawful consent and
sensualyte thereof. Wherefore they ought in nowyse to choabyte / or dwell with
any women (except she be very agyd / or of their nygh kynrede) nor co^tynual
to behold any woman / nor to have any oportunyte of time / or place to comyt
any evil act with her. How be it if he were such a one as were of synguler
goodness / exercized and tried in the fear of god and al manner of virtue above
the common sort of men / it were not possible that he should by any mean excede
/ or be enta^gled with any such carnal desire / or any wise be mouyd from the
purpose of chastyte. Is it not very dangerous for a man not yet excersysed
nor estabylysshed i^ grace and virtue / to inhabyte / or dwell with a woman
that is prohybyte. Let every pressed and clerk therefore take heed that no woman
seldom or never do ons enter into their houses / for who so ever vysytheth the
walks / or steps of women can not inhabyte with god with a clean and hole
heart. For a woman inflamyth the conscience of him with whom she dwellyth.

Thou shall never dispute / or have comunycacyon of the bewtye of women. But if
thou perceue a woman in good conuersacyon / love her with spiritual affection
and not with corporal vysytacyon. Therefore it is co^mau^dyd unto prestes and
clerks i^ the.xxxiiii. distynction that they should avoid overmuch familiarite
with their ki^sfolke inhabityng with the^ furdermore as saint Jerome saeth. The
sharper torments of hell be reseruyd unto prestes and clerks doyeng
fornycacyon / and ferder this Woe be to the being a pressed that have kyst the
daughter of venus with the same mouth with whom a little before thou dydyst
receue the son of the Vyrgyn Mary. O cursyd Judas that with a kiss do
betray the son of man. Therefore also glorious saint Jerome being in the
extremyte of death in the presence of the blessed body if our lord / spoke
unto Christ saying thus. Woe be to them that receue the unworthily / for truly
they do crucyfye the again to their great condemnation and punishment. Alas
good lord what shall I say / forbycause prestes do eat the in the altar / as
it were the flesh of birds or bestes on a table / because also in the night
they use fylthy co^gressyon with women / and erly in the morning in their
celebracion they do receue the / and eat the. Than good lord where art thou
hyd do thou sleep or wake?

Is such service accepted of the? Is that the sacryfyce and oblation which
thou desyryst. Behold the world is full of prestes and yet there is scantly one
among an hou^dreth that is good and weldysposyd. There is in the world none so
cruel a best as an evil and wanton priest is for he dysdaynyth to be
correctyd and in no wise will suffer to here the troth. Therefore in the person
of Christ speaking saint Augustyne in this wise. O thou pressed torment me
no more with thyn offenses / for the wound of thy sin hurtyth me more (that is
to say) dyspleasyth me more / than the wound of my side.

Thou do sin more grievously which offendyst me raynynge in leuyn with thy
fornicacyon / and my body and blod irreverently handelyst / geuyng evil
occasyon and example unto my people / for whose health I did vouchsaffe to be
crucified on a cross / than they which also crucyfyed me walkyng on the earth.
Therefore o thou priest here holy saint Bernard exhortyng and enformynge the /
saying thus. O thou priest thy mouth is daily made the receuer / and as ye would
say the sepulture of the blessed body of Christ. Therefore why does that mouth
ever lie / why does it ever speak lecherously why is that soul and mind of
thine made vytious. Wherefore do thynyes behold vanytees / which every day on
the altar has before them / Christ him self the high and everlasting
truth / why puttyst thou forth thy hands unto things unlawful and unclean /
which do handell most precious and immaculate sacraments / why swymmyst thou
in the dronken stremys of wine / which drynkyst the blod of our savior / and
ever oughtyst to be full of spiritual refresshyng. Is it not a foul and
myscheuous acre for the^ / to handell the shameless bodies of harlotes with such
hands as be given / and dedycate unto god ye consecrate also with holy
anoyntment / and with the same hands to touch the holy body of our lord Jesus
Chrste. O how wicked and presumptuous it is to handell the son of the Virgyne
Mary / ye the only begoten son of god the father / and him to receue with so
fylthy a mouth which excellyth and over cummyth all understanding. What man
would not be abashed to se the most precious treasour in the world to be cast
in to a dounghyll. For truly a Lecherous pressed is more fylthy than any dirt /
or clay / and more stynkynge and corrupt than any synke / or drawght furdermore
as saint Jerome says / and as it is red in the decree / no man ought for to
eat of the easter lamb / or to be receuyd to the communyon at such time as he
knowith his wife.

The cause whereof saint Thomas and other upon the fourth book of sentence /
have notyd saying thus / that althowgh the carnal act in wedlock may be done
without sin / yet by the pleasure and voluptuosnes theru^to annexed / it
plockyth and withdrawith a man's mind from devotion. Therefore if it be not laful
for married folk / which may use the bodyly occupacyon without sin / to
receive thyr maker / where the night before they have carnally known yche
other. How abhomynable do these prestes which co^myttyng fornycacyon in the
night / presume to celebrate in the day. Surely it may be conceuyd by no
understanding nor by any tongue it may be expressed how in ordynatly such do
offend which being polluted with so foul vice / do presume to handel and
recyeue the most pure and heavenly mysteryes of Christ / and to pronounce the
most holy words of the mass and canon thereof with so corrupt a mouth.

Therefore of such things spekyth the high judge Christ himself by the mouth
of the prophet Ozeas saying thus. I will correct the^ at my pleasure / and thus
be hold I will mete the^ as it were a bear and lyones that had lost their
whelps and will destroy the inward part of them and also will consume the^
as it were a lion. Than as the Prophet David this psalms says. He will speak
unto them in his anger / and will vex and troble them in his furor. He will
thrust them in to a furnace of fire in time of his wrath and they shall have
no rest in their mysery.

And as the Prophet Ezechiell spekyth. Behold I have clappyd my hands at
their malice. Can your heart susteigne or your hands prevail in the time of my
punyssheme^t? And thus I will blow you and brenne you in the fire of furor /
and you shall be blown in the myddis o a furnace and than I will cease / of
whom also god by the Prophet Amos god spekyth in this wise. Behold I will
grate upon you / as a wayne will grate that is laden with hey. And now by the
Prophet Malachias the word of god is spoken unto prestes that polute and
corrupt his name in this wise. I will cast upon you the fyltes of your
ceremonies / and it shall take you with it (that is to say) I will impute unto
you / your own fylthy and fleshly works / and you shall fall together with
your myschyef into the deep flod of Acheon in hell. And the more intenty fly ye
were given unto voluptuousnes and carnal desire / the more peynfully ye shall be
bornyd in most hot and wyld fire for evermore / in like manner as I have spoken
in the Apocalypsis / that is to say.

The more they have gloryfyed the^ self in delight and pleasure / give unto them
so much the more pain and torment.

Of the same matter it apperyth in the reuelacyons of saint Kateryne the virgin
of zenis. And also of the holy wydowe saint brygyde. The.xv. Article.
IT is red in the book of the doctrine and reuelacyons of saint Kateryne of
zenis that the everlasting father spoke unto her in a vysyon in this wise. The
soul of wrechyd and carnal prestes / takyth great corruption of vice by their
sensualyte. And further thus I have anointed and consecrate them to the intent
that they should serve me in holiness and justice / and mynystre sacraments unto
beleuers and wottyst thou my welbelouyd daughter how they reward me for my
benefycyall goodness? I will tell the how.

They do daily persecute me with so many myscheuous acts / that it is
impossible for thy tongue to express it. And if thou dydyst here them all
rehearsed / thou woldyst dye for very sorrow / yet I will show the some of them
that thou may have the more compassyon.

For verily they ought to stand at the fable of the most holy cross there
incessauntly being in medytacyon / of the bitter passion of Christ / and there
them self to feed with the food of souls / labourynge contynually for the
health of them / evermore reioysynge in the spyrytuall profet of them. But they
go into tauerns / and there they swear / and stare / telling wanton tales /
serving Glotony / and Dronkenes / forgetynge their dyuyne service / but if
they chance to say it / their hearts notwithstanding be far from me. They be
full of miserable vice / as it were men blyndyd in sin / ye their words and
deeds standyth always of wantones / they be not ashamyd to offend openly /
they be very rybaldes / players / and mockers. But after they have played away
their souls / so that it perteyneth to the body of the dyuell / than they
play away the goods of the church / and to expende the substance (which
they take in the name and virtue of the blod of our savior Christ) in their
own pleasurys so that the pore people be nothing helped therewith.

Another the church has necessary ornaments / for they being the temple of
the dyuell / care not for my temple and such ornaments as they should make in
the church / they make in their own houses / ye and do worse with it then
that / for look how the bryde grome attyryth his bryde / right so these
fleshly dyueles do attire their fleshly concubynes and perramours. And when
these unhappy dyueles (that is to say) wanton prestes do pass unto the altar
/ they be nothing abashed to se their concubynes or harlottes going with
their children to do their oblacyon with other people. O ye dyuelles and worse
then dyuelles / would to god your iniquite were more hyd under foot / for than
i^ should do less hurt unto the lay subyectes But now truly ye be the very
occasyon of abhomynable living. Is this the puryte or clennes that I desire in
a priest.

Is this clennes / wha^ he rysyth with an unchaste mind with a corruept and
stynki^g body with whom all night he lay with his devil or leman. O
tabernacle of Behebub / where is they weldysposed watchynge in the night when
contynually thou shuldyst be devout i^ prayer at which time also thou
shuldyst vertuouslye dyspose they self to celebratyon on the morrow. Therefore
of carnal delight it co^myth / that these sylthy prestes do another seek mine
honor / the health of the^ self nor yet of their neybours. They will not
correct also such as they have cure and charge of / but of their own propre
and pryuate affection wherewith they be enflamyd / they coueyte and desire
worldly riches pleasure of the body with whom yet they must have temporal
honors delycate feasts and bankettys precious superfluous and well trymmyd
garments of these prestes therefore this holy and innocent virgyn saint
Kateryne wrote many other things by the speech and reuelacion of god / wiche
be brought in / in another place.

Moreover there be many things red of ^^ese prestes in the book of the
reuelacyon of the blessed wydowe saint Brygyde where among other Christ in a
visyone spoke unto her on this facyo / was it not said by the prophet David
how they that have eten my b^^^d have magnyfied supplantacyon above m^^yeue^
so now I say to you. Tha^ (...) ^^^cherous prestes which eat my br^e^ (...)
^he (...) / be very traitors unto (...). I (...) ye Jews and paynyms and I
can perceue ^^^^g the^ none worse tha^ such p^e^^es. Th^^fore of the very zele
of justice / I ^urse (...). And cursyd be all thing (...) they ^a^e of the
earth to their profter or ^^^^f^acyo^ / forbycause they be so vnkyn^ to ge^^.

Cursyd be their meat / and drink^ which fedeth their bodies to wor^es meat
and their souls to hell (th^^ is to ^ay) they keep the souls in their bodies
to their damnacyons. Cursyd be the bodies of them / which shall rise and
brenne in hell without end. Cursyd be the years in whom they so viciously have
lyuen. Cursyd be that hour that begynnyth to the^ inhell / and shall never
have end Cursyd be ye eyes of the^ with who^ they have seen the light of the
fyrmament. Cursyd be the ears of the^ that has hard my words / and not
fulfilled them. Cursyd be the taste of them wherewith they have perceuyd my
gifts. Cursyd be the touching of them / that have touchyd me unworthily.
Cursyd be the savor of the^ that have smellyd things for their own delyght /
and despised me / that am most delecrable of all thing. Among these cursyd
prestes there rayneth couetyse auaryce slewth symony / hatred / obstynacy /
carnal pleasure / the love of the world / and yet with worldly things they
are not satysfyed. They preche my word and seem to do many good things / but
all is to their own honor and comodyte. Holy sancte Brigitte reherseth many
mo things like unto these which now for this purpose we have sufficyently
touchyd because in the book of the life and rules of curates they be more
largely declared.

That regulars and all men constitute in holy ordres are bound to be virtuous
and holy gathered out of the saye^g of holy Dionysius. The.xvi. Article.
THe holy and most dyuyne Dionysius / says. That no man ought to presume to be
a leder in any dyuyne office or service / but such as be most like or very
nyghe facyoned unto god i^ virtue (that is to say) so wise and virtuous that of
the ple^tuousnes of the^ other may be cleansed lyghtened and with virtue
replenysshed where upon sai^te Thomas upon the fourth book of sentence in
the.xxiiii. dystynctyon concludyth and Albertus affirmyth the same. That where
every man in holy ordres / is co^stitute a leder i^ other dyuyne matters / if
he presume to take unworthily that order upon him / he synnyth dedly. In like
manner he that is constitute in holy ordres / wether he be pressed / decane / or
subdecane / as oftentyme as he executyth any act of his holy order unworthily
/ so ofte^tymes he sinnyth dedly / as it were a man that had no charity nor yet
grace. The same thing Durandus in his book called summa raymu^dus / Johannes
Bonaue^tura and other agreably do affirm. Therefore holiness of life is as well
required unto the taking of holy order / as to the execution and demynystracion
of the same by cause of the co^maundme^t and not because of the sacrament /
herewith aggreyth the saying of that devout Dionysius in a certain epistle
which he wrote ad demophilu^ saying thus. Any man not weldissposyd nor
virtuous / unworthily executing things that be holy shewyth him to be very
presumptuous / and a man supposing that god is ignorant of that / that he
knowith (that is to say) he thynkyth yt god (whom like a liar he called father)
does dote or mystake his wretchedness or vice I will not say that such a on does
(like a Christen man) show forth prayers / or orysons upon the holy syngnes
that is to say the sacraments. Upon which words the doctors before rehearsed
do conclude / that such a pressed / decane / or subdecane / is taken as a
blasphemour deceuour and traitor unto Christ. Therefore (seeing regulars be in
some holy order) it apperyth how virtuous and clean they ought to be / and
how obedyently they ought to excecute their offices. Whereby also they be
bound to give good example unto the people / and that their neighbors should
be parttakers of the abundaunce of their virtue and grace. etc.

Of the qualyte of regulars gathered out of the sayenges of saint Bernard.
The.xvii. Article.
THe holy and elect saint Bernard / the lover of regular brethren / a favorer
of the publyk well / auoydour and assistour of the church / ofte^tymes in his
books descrybyth and lamentyth the great ruin / and (...) of the church. But
among all other / espe^ (...) waylyeh the lapse and fall of (...) He says
also that Clerks (...) men) do pri^cypally usurp and (...) that thing
wherein is their (...) utterly avoid yt thing that ^hu^de b^ paynfull unto
the^. And no ^ought every kind of people has some la^our / and so^e pleasure
but now adays ye may pererue^ m^ruayle at the ^uysion of Clerks / how by a
new means they can dyscer^e ^he pleasure from the pain / cho^syng and
embracyng all thing for their dely^e / and utterly auoid^ng all thing that is
grievous and peynfull. They compare with soudyars tu^^ers of the ^orlde in p^y^^
/ noble apparaunce / tra^pynge of horses or mules / hu^tynge / hawkyng / dye^ /
^ardes / ye thy begin to coun^er^e^ wa^ne^ in werynge precious furs
hanging done on their necks in sweet odour^ in glorious garments ye in all
ma^er of tenderness. Full craftily they retrayne from weryng of harnes / from
watchynge all night in pauylyons / from sodeygne / skyrmysshes.

The husbandman swetyth the keeper of the vyneard dyggyth / and deluyth And
clerks which sytt sluggysshly in idelnes at the fruteful time of the year / do
command their barnes to be stuffyd their buttryes to be replenysshed before
the husbandme^. They eat fine white bred. They drink pure wine / they frank
the^ with the fattenes of corn / they coueyt the savor of straung and sweet
herbs. Merchants do sail about the sea ingrete labor / both in dau^gere of
body and life gathering riches that by wrack or mysaucnture they may lose
these are sore things. Our rich prestes will beware of them / for they will
sleep in the mean space. I will not say they play ye wantons in their beds /
furdermore other craftesme^ geate their living with sore labor / but idell
clerks wallowe and swymme in riches and pleasure without labor / or pain /
but at the last when al men shall arise every man in his order / where (think
ye) this generation shall be appointed. If they torn to kynyghtes or sowdyars.
They will beat the^ away in like manner husbandmen / merchants / and all
other crafts men will drive them away from their parts / because they have
not labouryd as they have done. But than what remains.

Infayth that such (whom every order does forsake and accuse) must be
appointed unto a place where is no order / But everlasting fere and troble.
Therefore saint Bernard shewyth in his third book called (de consideracione)
that clerks be out of all order / saying thus. What meanyth it that clerks
will be of one facyon / and yet wylbe countyd to be of another / for in their
apparayle they be sowdyars or ruflars in their gaynes or lucre they are very
clerks / but in deed they appear to be another / for they fight not as sowdyars
/ and their techynge and conuersacyon is not like clerks / how may we know
of what order they be / when they will be of both ordres / but truly they
destroy and confund both. The blyssed apostle said thus every man shall arise
in his order. In which (think ye) shall these arise. Whether they that have
offendyd without order shall peryshe without order. Or if it be supposed that
the most true / and ryghtwyse God will forsake (from the highest unto the
lowyste) all them that be out of order. I fear lest they shall be ordered in no
other place but where everlasting horror / fere / and troble does inhabit
Forsooth they be not friendly spouses which fear not to re^ayne things
assigned unto to church to their own private v^e and professet. And such as
ought to prepare tabernacles in heaven both for them self and other / thy
procure herein the erch houses upon houses land upon land / and contrary to
the doctrine of Christ they mucke up money and treasure in this world / where as
nature is co^tentid with a lyetyll. But they do not only seek a necessary
living by the goods of ye church which they may obtain with small peryls /
but also they desire to be honouryd they study to please man and not god / to
be proud and full of pleasure / in every poi^t to be comfortable to this world.
It is not charity / but a covetousness that is strange to god / which inducyth
al me^ to get pryuate honor / or riches in substance / or ordres of ye
church / or else to seek pleasure of ye body (that is to say) such things as be
theyrs / and not such things as be Christ's What mean they to be so fool
hardye.

How chaunsyth it that they be so mad / where is the fear of god / where is
the remembrance of death / where is the fear of the pains of hell / where is
the lokynge for the terryble day of judgment. The spouses cries to the heavenly
spouse in this manner. Take me with the / we will run in to the savor of
thine olimentes. Now every man takyth his own pleasure / and folouyng the
savor of foul lucre / they suppose gains to be goodness / the damnation of
whom is rightwyse.

Of the most strayte and terryble judgment of god upon clerks had out of the
words of glorious saint Bernard.
HOly saint Bernard spekyth of this matter saying thus / woe be to the being a
clerk / death is in thy cup death is in thy delight and pleasure / forbycause
thou eatest and drynkyst the sins of ye people (that is to say) thou eatest /
and drynkest the goods of the church offeryd of the people to purge the^ from
sin. Thou rekenyst to have the rewards of the church for god a mercy. Thou
singyst for them / but better it were for the to beg and labor except by thy
just conuersacyon in all thing / thou do satysfy god for the offenses of thy
foundars and benefactours. Therefore be thou sad and circumspecte to do fruits
of penance to shed co^dygne teres for their offenses as though thou shuldyst
make account for them: or else thou knowyst that the synnys of the people
(which now thou accountyst among thy plesurys / nothing regardyng them as
though they belongyd not unto the) will be laid to thy charge. O the great
depnes of the judgments of god / O how terryble is god in his counsaylys to
the children of men.

O wretchis it wylbe to late for you to say unto the hills. Fall ye upon us and
cover us with downs. For ye shall come before the iudycyall bar of Christ /
and the grievous complaynt of the people shall be hard against you / the sore
accusation of the^ by whose alms and stypendes ye were sustained and have not
washed away the synnys of them to whom ye were very blind leders and
dysceytfull medyatours. O thou fool what pleasure fyndyst thou than in thy
delycyousnes / how do thy riches delight thyn eyes wherewith thou have bought
the so terryble a judgment / so intolerable and eternal ponysshment / and
have bound thy self unto so strayte an account / for why all that thou have
unto the last farthyng shall be taken away from the / but now let regulars mark
what the holy anointed saint Bernard (being taught by the holy ghost) wrote
unto one Falco a weldisposed regular having no more but one benefyce / which
Falco also afterward was made a bishop saying thus. Thou rysyst up at vygylles
/ thou geyst unto masses / thou vsyst the quere both in the houris of the
night and eke of the day. This doyeng thou do well and takyst not the
prebendes of the church for nothing / for it is mete that he that seruyth the
altar do live by the altar. I will he should live by the altar / but I will
not that he should be proud / lecherous / nor rich / nor by the goods of the
clergy of a poor man to be made a rich man / nor of a mean man to be made a
glorious man. Of the goods of the church he may build him no great palayees
no precious manners / or dwelling houses. Curyously kerued / peynted / or
gylted / he may gather no bags of money too gethere / he may not destroy
and expend the goods of the poor people in such vany^^ or sup^erflu (...) /
he may no^ exal^e or promo^e his ne^^wes / or ^ynsfolke with the goods of the
church / and I was about to say / he shu^b not mary his sons, or daughters
therewith / but now let i^ palie. It is gra^^yd unto the (yr thou i^^ue the
al^are) that thou shall be sustained by the altar ^ut to the emen^ tha^ thou
should bye the ^^g ^^den bryl^^^s / painted s^dles / silver (...) soi^ and fy^e
^u^res or chaunge^^ (...) / to be se^uin rych^ appareyl / (...) about their
neckys and upon (...). Than we must conclude (...) soever thou retaynest of
the (...) of the church / except necessary (...) ap^^tayl^ / it is not thine /
but (...) ^t^nb^y and sacryledge. Alas (...) in the beginning o^ the esta^
(...) word have thought that (...) ^old ^a^e tumb^yd down in to so (...)
euyn^. But when a little and a ly^ (...) ^an began more grievously to ostend
(...) bo^^enes had hardened his name ^^ce without shame / ^nsomuch that he
(...) it not / than this desperate / vnhap^es began. For a wicked p^est when
(...) ^^mpth unto the bottom or sin / settyth not a paynt thereby / nor
fearyth to present himself to the face of god / boldly entryng into the church
/ as if it were an howshold servant / than he goyth into the quere / he
knylyth down and kyssyth the altar with a theuysshe mouth / he thynkyth that
he does craftily / but how openly is his iniquyte found to his great hatered in
the sight of god / so than some of them do fall from fornycacyon / to incest and
aduoutrie / but would to god they had not fallen to the affeccyons of ignomynye
/ and abhomynable living. Furthermore of these regulars holy sayncte Bernard
wrote many other things of the ambytyon / and desire of promotyon of clerks /
and how they be asshamed to be contentyd with a suffycyent prebende but
evermore they brethe to higher dygnyte / till at the last / they fall down as
deep as the dyuel / and no marvel that so cursyd conuersatyon is in the
church among them constitute in holy ordres / for they enter not into them by
Christ but by symonye / and many other perverse intencyons / sekyng god in
pleasure and idelnes / living in vanyte and worldly desire / not serving god
in sanctyte and justice / or procedyng to god by a str^y^e or narowe way of
health / having more respect unto things temporal than spiritual /
furdermore as holy saint Bernard says. Every where men run hedlonge in to
holy ordres without any reverence or consideratyon / and yet it is a mystery
worthy to be honorably mynystred of spiritual angeles. But now adays they
make men prestes in whom avarice reygneth / ambytyon gouernyth pride has
domynacyon / but iniquyte and lechery beryth most rule. After this facyon they
coueyle and run to the dygnytees and charges of the church / as though they
ought to live without charge / when they come to their honors and charges.
Truly they do not ponder the bourdone annexyd unto the charge / another they do
behold what judgment they stand in. whom verily (the more negligent they be
in their account / the more at lybertye and pleasure that they live) the more
intolerable shall their da^nacyon approach unto them.

How they ought to pray / sing / and say the service of almighty god.
FOr because it is the chyef exercise of regular^ (or else it ought to be)
continually to be occupied in orysons and praise to god / and in singing their
divine hours. Therefore we shall breuely touch how god ought to be lawdyd and
prayed unto. But in the mean time / I purpose somewhat to declare how
incessantly and fervently we have need to call upon god. First it apperyth of
the part of the place wherein we do dwell. For ye know we inhabyte in this
wyked world as in a great exyle / in a vale of terys and morning in a fylde
fully beseged with most cruel craftye and strong enemies / by whom we be daily
in great peril and daungere / for our invisible adversaries do never sleep /
but evermore they ley awayte and go about to cast us down in great aduersyte
and with them to wrappe us in eternal damnation. And truly we be very brytyl
and weke to resyst them. Therefore as well of the part of the place as of the
part of ye dau^gere and gynnes in whom we be daily set and co^uersaunt and
also of the part of our gostly enemies / we have great need to fle unto God /
with prayer / and most affectuously to desire his help comfort and defense.

Especially and forbycause we do daily and euerywhere bring with us our
domestycall adversary (that is to say) our own body which greuyth our soul
depressyth our understanding / and besydys that inducyth a thousand
impedyme^tes of spiritual profet. Secondaryly it apperyth how fervently it
behouyth to pray god for a great cause the which we have to do with him before
hand. And this is the matter / forbycause we have despised to take eternal
damnation. Therefore of right we ought to serve god / and thereby to obtain
everlasting joy. And ferther if men so affectuously and lamentably de entrete /
for the conservation and defense of this short and present corporal life.

if also people do so mekely and instau^tly desire god for worldly prosperyte /
how much more mekely / and fervently does it become us to beseech the mercy of
god for escapyng perpetual damnatyon / for virtue also to prevail against all
temptatyons / for the obteyni^g of everlasting health / for every gift of grace
necessary to combye and deserve so great and infinyte bliss. Thirdly it
apperith for that: that so oftentimes and so grievously we have offendyd god /
and daily do dishonor him. Therefore Climacus says that by consideration of
them that be gylty of death / ye may learn how ye ought to pray unto god. For if
thieves or murderers being taken by a prince / or great man / have any hope or
trust to escape / they will knele down before him who^ they have offendyd and
with great humylyte and fervent affectyon desire pardon promysyng to amend and
that ever after unto the time of death they will humble them self and be very
dylygent to do that prince or great man very faithful service / much more we
abhomynable wretchis / which times innumerable have deseruyd eternal
damnatyon / ought after the same manner to call upon god everlasting / which
graunty^h hope to them that be penitent and promyseth pardon to them that he
contryte. Further more we may ponder a part by god him self and by his majesty
/ how and after what facyon we ought to pray unto him. For first if we
consider the infynite majesty / dignite / holiness / and honor of god most
blessed and glorious / we ought to desire him of pardon with all reverence
subjection / and humylyte. For if the mynystres of kings and prelates in this
world do so mekely / reverently / and like subjects worship them / much more
we ought to do honor and reverence (and not without great humylyte and
subjection) unto the everlasting / and most incomparable king of heaven /
moreover considering ye most favorable goodness of god beholding us / we ought
to call upon his grace with a dylygent custody of heart / with a very
cyrcunspecte attendaunce to pondre the sense of our words / thynkyng utterly
to refrain from all vnfruythfull dygressyon. Considering also the infinyte
mercy and reward of god / we ought to pray unto him with great hope and
confidence. And ferther in consideracyon of godly justice we ought to pray unto
him with fear and tremblyng / moreover considering our own transgressyon and
offenses / we ought to pray unto him / with inward contrytion mekely
knowledgynge our offenses / to our great proffet. And truly co^sideringe our
own necessyte / infyrmyte / and redynes to vice and myschyef / we ought
evermore with sore sighyng and lamentacyon to desire his grace of mercy for as
our savior himself says. It behouyth for to pray and never cease.

Considering olso our own small deseruyng we ought louyngly and with great
meknes to call upon god puttyng our only feyth hope and trust in his mercy /
even as creatures of very small and weke power. Of these consideracyons for
the most part it apperyth / how atte^tysly / reverently / distinctly /
affectuously / plesau^tly to god / ferefully / mekely / purely / and dyscretly
we ought to lawde and honor god in syngyng. Therefore says saint Bernard in
this wise. Most welbelouyd brethren / always I exhort you / yt boldly ye
appear in your divine service / and that duly / and reverently ye resort unto
it / not slowly heuily or slepi^gly not spari^g your voices wha^ ye should sing
/ not pronou^cing half words and sometime eskyppyng the hole / not sowning
the^ softly as it were a woman that sang thorowgh the nose / but to pronounce
such holy and gostly words with a manly breast and affection / with so good
dysposytion that ye should seem to imagyne or think that thing yt ye sang / but
alas there be many regulares now a days in that point found greatly i^
defaulte / for they sing to rasshely not pawsing in the middis / another
reuere^tly nor ferefully standing like good dyseyples before god / but sone
absenting the^ self from divine service coming tarde into the quyre / but yet
will go out with the first.

And how can they be intentysly given to the sense of such gostly words /
when they pronunce them so hastily and indistyntly / but would god that they
would harken to this that is said of them.

Cursyd is that man / that does the work of god negligently. And also that
which god spoke by the prophet Isaie and which Christ himself rehearsed in
the gospel on this facyon. The people do honor me with their lyppis / but the
heart of them is far from me. What answer will these people make to the high
judge / which dylyge^tly have occupied such things as perteyned to the flesh
and so long time in them have remained / which ryng late to mattens / and
fynyshe it so quikly yeuyn as they do other hours They sit also much longer /
at their dyners / suppers / feasts / ba^kettes / games / plays / and
dysportes than nature necessyte or reason would require. Verily full sone they
dyspatche them self from all thing that is godly / and consernynge the wealth
of souls and at all times led their life peruersly. Therefore let them repent
and slake no more the due time of the dyuyne service of their maker / but such
princypall and gostly wordis / let them more princypally dylygently and tymely
execute. Furdermore there be some regulars that sing nothing at all /
notwithstanding they stand in the quyer / but they command and commit it to
children and other syngers in the quyer.

But that custom semyth to be a corruptyon of religion and no law / and to
proceed of no humylyte or devotion / but rather of pride abusyon or hatered /
where in time past not only the canons of cathedral churches / but also the
prelates themself were wont to sing with the quyer. Therefore let them mark
what the apostle says. He that labouryth not shall not eat. Is not the
benefyce ordeigned for him that does the office / or deutye / for that cause
the rentes of the church is due to none / but to such as do execute their
offices and labor in divine service.

Whether descante may be commendable in the dyuyne service / and of certain
things which ought to be eschewyd in song The.xx. Article.
LIke as it is declared in a certain book named / summa virtutu^ et vitiorum /
it is greatly reprouid in singing the dyuyne service to feign a voice to much
quaueryng or warbelyng either for pride / vainglorye / or pleasure. For as
saint Gregorye says. Whylste they feign warblynge voices / they let slyp all
good devotion / likewise in singing divine service ouermuche lowdenes and
mountynge of the voice is no^ comendable nor likewise the rollyng of it / nor
also to much swyftnes or to dragge ouerlong at the lattere^de / and to skyppe
over the rest or pausinge in the mids. And specially when the song is so
swyft that it is shaken all to naught. Moreover a question may be mouyd whither
desca^t or breking of the voice may lawdably be suffered in gods service /
upon that in ye said notable book of summa it is written thus. Breakyng of the
voice or descante semyth to be nothing commendable in ye divine service /
whereupon it is read in the legend of saint Sebast. that person is to be
estemyd no right christian / which is in a manner weddid unto the harbor /
which tri^meth his bushe / which sekith sweet savors / and breakyth his voice
/ for brekyng of the voice semith to betoken a broken mind / even as the
turnyng i^ of the head is nothing co^endable unto men / nor the great rollys of
playtes in the garments of women ^omore is desca^t unto syngers. And like as
the wind is wont to reyse up great plenty of wauis and surges / even so the
wynd of vanyte is the cause of all this quauers and surges in singyng / these
things ar co^taynid in the foresaid book of summa / whereby it is prouydyd yt
they that use such manner of singyng / do utter it for nothing else but for their
vainglory and wa^tones of mind which.ii. things do co^syst i^ their uyce
singi^g / for if it were excusable or to be co^me^dyd for any cause it should be
only done for excyting and styrryng the people unto devotion / for some folkys
by reason of such melodyes / ar greatly mouyd unto conte^placyo^ and devotion
for which cause also organes ar vsid in the church. Whereupon saint Augustine
says. As often as the song is more delectable unto me / then the dite / so
often I knowledge that I do sin penally / and then had I rather to here no
song at al / furthermor although that desca^t specially prouokith some unto
deuocio^ and heavenly co^templacion / yet for all that it semith greatly to
revoke and let some from ye mind of their own prayours.

For god from whom nothing unlawful don is hydden does not ^oke after the
plesauntnes of the voice / but the puryte of heart.

Against some that would be excusid from the obseruau^ce of such things that
regulars / ar specially bounden to do / saying that the dygnyte of the church
requires none other facyon then has been vsyd in times passyd.
David the maker of Psalmis did not without cause pray this prayer unto god
saying. Let not mine heart inclyne unto the wordis of malignyte / for to
inuente excusis in sin.

Surely this manner or excusing causyth many to be incorrigible and unruly.
Let none therefore excuse himself from the obserua^ce or keeping of the things
before specyfied / saying we can not live now a days / as our predecessors
and elders have lives in times pa^syd (that is to wit. For to be c^^en^yd
with necessary living / syngle array / and one benefyce. But for the honestye
/ and worthynes of the church / we have need of many moo things / and we
must keep hospytalyte / and he clothed and sedde / according to the dygnyte of
our estate / degree / and order / and to maintain good householders unto the
which manner of excusis / and such like cauyllations / and persuasions /
whereby many deceive the^seluis and other to / this answer may be made. How
it is convenient that religious persons / and al other within holy orders /
should have their living / their clothyng / their mayntenau^ce / and keeping
after an honest sort / and according to the degree that they are called unto /
and as it is co^uenye^t for their degree / estate order / and dygnyte. But
would god they would substaunciallye / and euynlye consydre / what belongyth
unto their very honesty / and to their conuenyent apparayll / and furnyshynge.
For whatsoever thing is contrary unto virtue / the same is also contrary unto
the true and commendable honesty. Forasmuch as goodness and honestye (according
to the mind of philosophers and doctors) called so because of their own
nature and property they do allure intyse / and cause men to desire them for
their own sake / and for none other respect / as wysedom / science and virtue
/ like as the philosopher writes in his first book (de anima) herevpo^ says
Isodore / that honesty is as much to say as thestate of honor / because
honor is due unto wysedom and virtue / and also unto dignyte: which ought to
be furnyshed with wysedom and virtue / is to be whatsoever therefore is
contrary unto / wysedom and Virtue / stemyde dishonest / and contrary unto the
perfyrenes of living. Wherefore the honestye of spirytual mynystres standith in
holy and perfyte humylite: great patience: myldenes: obedience: charity: all
chastyre: dyligence / sobreues / and gyuynge good example / true Justice /
mercy / lyberalyte and other like virtues / gifts / and gracys of the holy
ghost / in the despysynge of erthlye things / in the desire and contemplacyon
of heuenlye things / not (...) the excess / and superfluyte / costlynes /
^^^posyte / delycatnes / and pleasure of appareyll / in mete: in drink / and
in sumptuos houses / not in royal housekepyng in multeplyenge of riches / and
haboundaunce of householdestuffe and other like. For in such manner of things
the very dygnyte worship comlynes and honesty of ecclesiastiques does stand as
the Apostle witnessyth writing unto Tymothee / that woman should pray in
conuenyent array: meke: simple: and devout not in costlye: pompous: trymne:
and rich apparel: for the most holy Chieftayne of thapostles says: be ye
not clothyd with rych apparayll / and perlys.

In this point therefore consysteth the very honestye and dygnyte of relygious
persons and prestes that (asmoch as is possible) they shall endeavor for to
use themseluys according to the commandments / decres / rulys / tradycyons
/ and steppys of Christ: thapostles: and holy fathers. And so by gyuynge good
example / Dyligence and / Spiritual conuersacyon they shall edefye the
Vnlernyd people and shall be a good savor unto god / and shall gloryfie god in
perfyte living and seruyng him with all chastity / sobernes / and dilygence in
doing the divine service / in simple and necessary clothing in charity /
devotion / and the other virtues before touchyd. And in so doing they shall
obey / subdue / and conferme them selves unto their prince / their Lord /
their bishop / their master / their teacher and their judge that is Jesus Christ
/ for in every order and degree there is one thing which is chief and superior
/ the which thing is a rule and a measure of things more less and inferior
/ so that the more that they be like and conformable to their head and superyour
/ they are somuche the more perfyte in their proper nature and degree / and the
further that they vary and dyffer from it so much the more imperfect they be.
Seeing therefore that Christ is the first and chief head measure and rule of al
faithful people that be of this congregation or church / so much the more ar
all christen people to be estemyd good vertuos / holy / and honest / in that
they follow Christ their head in whom was all honestye / virtue and goodness.
Therefore the true honesty of spiritual mynystres consysteth in this point /
which is to follow Christ's humylite / charity / justice / good example /
mercy / sobrenes / clennes / according unto the rulys / and decrees of holy
Fathers / not to feed their belyes delycatelye / whereby they are prouokyd unto
bodily lust / not to be arrayed in gorgeous appareyll. But that they should be
so much the more vertuos / holy / sobre / chaste / and good / in respect of the
lay people / as they are set in more high estate and dygnyte. Moreover it is
prouyd by common experience and teachyth that such relygyous persons as ar
vertuos / and chaste in their co^uersacion / of which there is almost (the more
pity) as great ple^te as is of whit crows / ar more set by / more welbelouyd /
much better regardyd among the common people / then ar the other sort. But
how straytlye the superfluyte of goods / inco^tynence of living / and
sumptuosnes of appareyll / is forbidden unto clerkys / is sufficientlye
declared in the.xi. article wherein among other things it is conteynyd thus.
All manner of staring and gorgeous appareyll / should not be vsyd among
spirytuall persons wherefore it is very mete that such byshopes and clerks as
cloth them seluys in trym costlye appareyll should be refourmid. For in time
past such as were of spiritual estate were contentyd with simple and mean
array. Finally the holy Apostles folowyd the same perfyte honesty of their
Master Christ whereof mention is made before / whose example holy Bishopes with
their clerks did alwais follow not only dutynge the persecucion of the church
/ but also long syns both in the time of saint Gregory / and also of saint
Bernard what time holy church was in much higher / and more glorious estate
then it is now / for the blyssed fathers before named did most vehemently
rebuke mynystres of the church for their excess / superfluyte / curoisite /
auaryce / and vicyous living / affyrmyng that they are specially bounden to be
conte^tyd with simple fare / and simple clothyng / and other like virtues as ar
spoken of before. Therefore let them not excuse themselves from the obseruaunce
of such things / but rather apply themselves (as much as is possible) unto
vertuos living which is perfect honesty according to ye rule that is expressyd
in the beginning of the third book of decrees. And further as they are
co^mau^dyd in the canons of holy fathers and hyge bishopes.

Of the danger that is in pluralyte of benefyces.
We have now declared suffyciently / how chaste / how tymorous / and how sobre /
all clerks / relygions / and all that be within holy ordres / ought for to be
and in like manner how they are bounden to eschew all manner of pride / excess
and worldly pomp in their appareayl / their stuff / and their houses / and to
be contentyd with simple fare / and simple clothing. which order if they
would observe / undoubtedly they might live competently with a mean benefyce /
but forbicause they observe not the things before specified but will have
superfluyte of al things / as of riches / of gorgeous appareyll / of sumptuos
fare / and such like prouysyons like unto ruflers / and rich men of the
world / no marvel therefore if they procure to have many benefyces. But how
peryllous it is to have pluralyte of benefyces / the true catholic / and
famous doctors before named that is to wit saint Thomas / Wyllyam of Paris /
Raymundus / and the author of the book called Summa Virtutum and Vitiorum / and
many other have suffycyentlye declared / out of whose workis specially I have
gatherid this little treatise against pluralite of benefices that now a days is
every where vsyd. But theffecte of their minds consists in this point /
that such as have more benefices then one (except it be in certain casys
hereafter to be towchyd) do rob god of his service / do dysmembre the church
in dymynyshynge the just noumbre of her mynystres / do spoil the poor and
the nedy of their alms / the dead souls of their suffrages / and finally
deceive the good entente of their foundours and patrones. Seeing therefore that
contrary to the wholesome counsel and doctrine of so many / and solemn doctors
and holy fathers / they have and coueyte to have pluralite of benefices / they
put themselves in great peril (and to be plain) so doing they committee
deadlye sin. Hereupon Wyllyam of Paris writes in this wise / verily the
having of spiritual possessions is very dangerous / which ought not to be
given / but only to such as deserve them / for the which cause good and holy
men have been dangerous to receive them. And all yt might be sauyd besides
their necessary sustena^ce / they vsyd to distribut unto the poor / to the
intent they should supplye their defautes in prayeng and doing good dedys /
whereupon the holy father saint Bernard says / that a clerk having
suffycient above his necessary chargys / and coueytynge to get more / is a
church robber / and synneth damnably. Moreover the said holy father saint
Bernard writing to a certain regular that had but one benefice how much so
ever (says he) that thou do retain and keep of ye goods of thy church
besides a simple and a competent finding for thy self think it not thine
own / but rather that it is stolen and robbed out of the church What thing can
be spoken more plainly or more terryblye? Ought not he to be estemyd blind and
past all grace that does not regard / ne fear the wordis of these holy
fathers. Now if it be so meant / for the having of one benefice / with how
many Theftys / Robboryes / Bryberyes and Sacrilege / ar they entanglyd / the
which being not content with one benefice or two / will purchase vnyons /
pluralitees / totquotes / ye hole hepes of benefices. Certaynlye if acordynge
to the mattiers before alledgyd / all that be rudedly sin / have no right to
ye goods of the church / nor yet to ye worst benefice that is / then must it
be grauntyd that such as have more benefices then one / ar plain theuys and
churcherobbers. And if they allege the dyspensacion of my lord the Pope / we
know well enough that his fatherhod can not dispe^se with couetyse / ambicion
/ pride / and lecherye / except it be his pleasure to usurp upon the law of
god / for if it should be tried in the court of conscience / or before god. I
dare boldly say that his dyspensacyon might not be allowyd without it were
some urgent cause / that is / if it were don either for very necessyte / or for
manifest vtylyte / which excusyth no man for the keeping of many benefices /
nor may be lawfully admytted / except it be in certain casys hereafter to be
touchyd.

Morouer by the law of god we ought not to possess more themporall goods /
then ar necessary for us / having regard unto spyrytuall gifts of grace and to
our salvation / that is to live well / and to obtain the life everlasting. He
that has one competent benefyce / I would know of him / for what cause / what
purpose and to what intent he would reteyne / orels go about to retain any
more / for either it must be to the intent for to have habu^dance of temporal
goods (which is unlawful when one has a suffyciet living) orels for to live
more spiritually / and to exercise charitable workis and for to grow to
further perfeccion / which can not come that way / for the goods that they
get by having many benefyces causith them to be more unquiet / and troubled in
mind / whereby they have great occasion to live more at pleasure and viciously.
Besides this Wyllyam of Paris / and diverse other great clerks do prove diverse
ways that whosoever has pluralyte of benefices (except it be in certain casys
hereafter to be touchyd) is bounden to say as many payres of mattynes as he
has benefices. And so he does daily incur as many deadly sins / as he
leuyth payers of mattynes vnsayed. The said Doctors also / and many other
affirm / that whosoever is in deadly sin / he synneth deadly as he procurith
to have spiritual goods which are appointed for none other but for such as
deserve them / how be it there are certain casys where it is leful to have
more benefices / or prebendes then one / which after the minds of doctors ar
such as here follow.

The first is / where the benefyce is not suffycient to find one priest his
co^pete^t sustenaunce and clothing. The secound is / where one benefice is
annexyd to another. The third is / where there is defaut and lack of prestes.
The fourth is if the church be appenda^t to a prebe^de / or such like dygnyte.
The fyfte is / if one have a just title to one benefice for a time / and
another in comendam until theffecte of the cause do cease. Also there may be
added the syxte cause / which is / if one be in service for the common
profit of ye church as to be a preachour / or in like office. Wherefore
according to the premysses / it may be estemyd lightly how much is sufficient
for the reasonable living of a clerk / if it be remembryd how they are bounden
to live chastely / sobrely / mekely moderatly: and gyuyng good example. Over
this we may learn by experience yt small revenues ar sufficient / for such as
use the virtues before rehersyd / howbeit we do grant that the greatter that
a clerk is in spiritual estate / the greatter benefyce he ought to have. But
pluralite of benefices (except it be in the cases be fore towchyd) is reprouyd
of all good men / as being most dangerous unto soul health / and therefore
(according to the council of the doctors before alledgyd) it ought to be
eschewyd of al persons that entende the chrystian perfeccion.

How prestes and such as ar of the clergy / ar bounden to keep hospitalyte.
Now again there be many of the clergy / that excuse the having of many
benefyces with this pretense. It behouith us (say they) to maynteyn good
hospitalyte / ye and to make provision for vnbydden gestes. Wherefore to avoid
this colouryd cauyllacyon / I will partly declare / unto you what manner of
hospitalite they are bounden / and that is none other but one of the workys of
mercy whereof Christ says in his gospel that he will put us in remembrance
at the day of judgment / and will speak in this wise. I was a straungier /
and ye would not ^ake me in. The which he speakith in the person of his
members / and creatures / the poor and the nedy / and not in the person of the
rich and the mighty. At this saying of our savior ought all clerkys and
mynystres of the church specyallye to tremble and quake which have not
herboroued nor sed the poor and nedy beggars. What will they answer which
have been so negligent of the poor that scarsely they can find in their hearts
to reward them with the fragmentes of their meat / or to aforde them lodginge
in their barnes. But yet they receive great astates / rych men / and officers /
with much reverence: they intertayne the^ with much solemnite / they refresh
them delicately / and lodge them in soft beddynge. Let them here / and amend
the^ seluys / and endeavor to observe that which Christ co^maundith in the
gospel. When thou makyst a feast (says he) do not call thereunto thy kynsfolke
/ nor rych men / or yt be in authorite lest they recompense the again for it
in this world: but call the poor / and the feeble / the blind and the lame /
and so thou shall be blessed / for they have not to reward the / but thou shall
be rewardyd / at the resurrection of the right wise. Merke well this plain
sentence / an^ most wholesome council. Notwith^^andinge these sayenges are not
so to be ^ndersta^den but that spiritual possessio^ars may lawfully at some
time upon a ^esonable cause may keep conuenyent hospytalyte in making chere
to their kysfolke / and bylyke reason to such as be rich and in authoryte / so
they use it but seldom / and without excess and pomp / and to a goodement.
Lest they do wrong to the poor: and palse measure: furtheemore as it has been
reperyd often here before / the possessions of the church / be the patrimony
of Christ / the alms of the poor / the wages of the servants of god.

Therefore they ought to be conuerryd to such uses and to none ohter. For saint
Hierom says. It is Sacrilege to bestow the goods of the poor upon such as
are not poor. And in another place.

They do sin deadly that bestow their goods upon rich folk / for they make
oblacyon to the devil. And as it said before / for to give the goods of the
poor to such as are not poor / is plain sacri^ege / for the possessions of
the church ar ye patrimony of ye poor / and can not be deteyned from the^ but
by theft / which is when the mynistres of ye church keep any more to them
selves then their bare living. Therefore (as saint Hierom says) that all such
as mysuse the goods of the church / or that belongyth / unto the church
bestowynge it in such things / as make for their own voluptuosnes and
pleasure / be like unto the scrybes and pharysees. They therefore that muccor up
ye goods of the church / and purchase lands therewith for to leave unto their
friends and kyndeswomen (I was about to have said their sons and their
daughters) or that bestow it upon vain and worldly hospitalyte / in their so
doing / comytte deadly sin as to spend it upon rych men or their carnal
companyons / for whom they make sumptuos prouysion / and can never be merry
without such gestys / or if they hap to be called by the^ will come in all the
haste to solace with them. Albeit that such facions ar specyallye forbidden
unto the clergy according unto the saying of Isodore which says thus.
Clerks ought to eschew feastis not only comune but also secret / and ought
to fare meanly in sobrenes / for all such festyng is peryllous to Christian
people for it both quenchyth devotion and distroyeth true co^tricion of heart /
and nourysheth lechery / and drawith unto it / idle words / iestyng / raylyng
/ wyldenes / the forgettyng of good works and much ungracious pastyme. And so
the fear of almighty god neclectyd and set a part / the sinful men regard
slenderly both their soul health. Therefore saint Ioha^ / Chrysostom and such
holy men would never be bydden unto feasts / nor likewise would bid any
other. In consideracion whereof (O ye Christen prestes / and true mynistres of
the church) these great dangerous / often / and delycat feastys. Remember well
/ that a certain prelate that was both rych and devout / incuyd with remorse
of consciense by inspiracyon of God said these words here following. I am made
rich in goods / and am a beggar in soul. I have won worldly honor and have
lost god. I follow the courts of princes / and am of counsel with great
estates / and thereby am bannyshed the court of heaven. What should I speak of
hospitalite / that rather ought to be called hostylite and most of all if it
be don for vaynglorye / and not rather for the love of Christ. For if they hap
to send for men of riches or authorite / they receive them with great honor
and reverence / and spend on them right largely of the patrymonye of the
crucyfixe. This is ye hospitalite of this world whereby rych men ar fed
sumptuoslye to the glory of the dyuell / and Christ which is perfect charity
is afflycted with despisinges / with hungre / with strypes / and with nakedness
in his poor creatures / for lo I little regardyng the terryble iugementes of
god do sit among my ghestes as Balthazar / misp^dyng the goods and the
treasure of the poor in the despyte of Christ. Under the color of such
false hospytalyte they make great feasts to men of authorite / and officers
(I had al most said offenders) and then is all the chere lost / and great
unkindness taken except one sit with them / and keep company in drinking / and
quassynge till some of them be as drunk as beasts. The Judgment of such
things shall be committed unto him / whose Judgment is secret and therefore /
the more terryble inasmuche as the goods that they mysbestowe are not their
own. But ar the alms of the poor. Therefore as saint Hierom says. It is
great shame that the poor should be bannyshed out of the houses of spyrytuall
men / and in the stead of them take r^fiers / and waytyng mynyons like unto
temporal princes.

The oblacyons of good people / for nedy souls. The tithe of the poor / and
of the simple: and the exaccyons and oppressyons of the poor / which rather
ought to get their bread with the swet of their facys / and not to have
myspendyd the Labors of good people in such vicyous plesures / as in
su^fetiynge and dronkenes / to devour that other sweat for. He that beholdith
the depenes / and sytteth above Cherubyn shall determyne the causes of the
Poor / when they shall stand boldly before him / against them that have
wronged them and have consumyd and myspent their goods in evil uses: and have
bestowyd upon the rich men / wherefore they shall have as great mede: as if
they had cast water into the sea. How will they accomplish this saying of
scripture. He has dystrybuted and given to ye poor. But that prelate whom we
alledgyd before understood this perfyghtly: for he said that huspytalyte which
is a deed of charity ought to be showed and don: not for vaynglory / or any
such carnal affeccion: but ought to proceed from a good mind and a vertuos
intent. Wherefore to conclude according to the premysses: not only hospitalite
but also al other charitable dedis and works of mercy as well bodily as ghostely
ought to be exercysed of spiritual persons after their abylite lyberallye /
lovingly: and devoutly / but most of all they ought to govern their houses
dyscretelye / and to edifye their household servants with good example gyuynge
both in word and deed / and should rebuke such as offend sharply and
charitablye / using themselves unto all men vertuoslye / mekely / sobrely and
iustlye.

Whither religious and men of the church that are able to find themselves of
their own patrimony and substance may lawfully convert the goods of the
church unto their own uses.
According to the minds of saint Augustyne and saint Thomas / not only the
wordys of our Master Christ but also of other holy fathers / ar of suffycient
authorite to bind us to the following of them wherefore we may much better /
and more surely give credence unto their sayenges / then the persuasions of
certain schole men that trust their own wits overmuch / wrestyng the
authoritees of holy fathers / unto their own fantasye. And notwithstanding
that some of them: in the questyon before purposyd: allege that it may be
lawfully don. yet I think it more wysedom to follow the authorite of saint
Hierom / sait Bernard and other holy fathers / then them. Also Pope Damasus
says / that a clerk which is founden with the goods of his friends / if he
take any of the church goods / does committee plain sacryledg. And so doing
he eatyth and drynketh his damnacion. But if he nedyth / and then takyth / it
is rather a gift then a taking / but if he have no need and takyth / he
stelyth. Likewise Prosperus speakyth in this wise. I can not well express /
how great an offense they do commytte / which when they are able to have of
their own / do charge ye church with their finding. And he says further that
holy men did possess the goods of the church not as possessioners but as
procuratours / and therefore they percyuyng that the goods of the church were
none other but the gifts of god / oblacyons for sins / and the inheryta^ce
of the poor they did not challenge them as their own / but bestowyd them as
things bequethyd to the poore^. And did not regard the having of them / but
kept the^ not to themseluys / but for other / nor did not procure to have them
with any covetous intent / but upon a good zeal to help other. Lo with how
great reason these holy fathers persuade us / for such as ar able to live of
their own are not accountyd / in the noumbre of the poor and nedy / for whom
the goods of the church were provided. And therefore it is more wysedo^ to
inclyne to the minds of these holy fathers / then to such dreamers that do not
only teach the contrary / but also do live contrary. But if they will obiecte
again / that the goods of the church belong unto the mynistres / and that
they ought to use them as in reward of their service. To this it may be
aunsweryd / that they are the goods of none other / but of such as need them /
for if the mynystres of the church have suffycient of their own / and for all
that will empley them to their own uses / it is damnable and therefore they
should be spent upon the poor / and the nedy for inasmuche as temporal
things ought to be vsyd in charytable and ghostly workys: they should not
bestow temporal goods other wise then spiritually / that is when they be
consumyd superfluosly / where there is no need / like as one that is hole of
body and lusty has no need of a Physicion / but rather such a one as is sick
and evil at ease. Wherefore those clerks that be rich have no wrong / though
they lack the profyttes of their temporalties / for thereby they merit the
heuynly rewards and gifts of grace / which are thousand times more to be
desired then temporal things. And finally it apperyth by the authoritees here
alledgyd in how great peril they are / which having sufficient of their
propre goods will maynteyne themseluys with benefices of the church /
spending all upon their kynsfolke / which after their degree ar able to live
well enough. And contrary wise they are in as great peril that consume both
patrimony and benefices raptously / and in carnal living. And consequentlye
these two articles do agree with the saying of the famous Clerk master Johan
Browt.

No goods of the church (says he) can be spend in feastyng and bankettes to
rich men / but with deadly sin / for they are appointed to the poor and ar
Christ's patrimony / and purchasyd for us by the passion of Christ / to our
inherytaunce / wherefore we can not lawfully give the^ to our own friends and
kynsfolke / onles they be poor and need / and that must be don only for
Christ's sake.

What manner of man a prelate / deane / or any heed ruler of regulars ought to
be.
IT is universally known to be true / as holy Dionisius techyth. That in every
estate / degree and order the chyef or heed / ought to be at ye time of his
calling of so great perfection / that with ye abundau^ce of his spiritual
riches and virtue / he might inflame / clence / and illumynate / such as be
under him and cause to live according to the order and estate that they be
called unto. Therefore it apperyth that a deane / or heed ruler / ought
especyally to be fulfillyd with all manner of virtuous exercise and obedience /
that (as it is said to apperteyne to regulars / to ye intent that he may be an
example / to all his regulars and other co^myttyd to his governance / and that
he may relygiously exhort them / ledyng them the right way to the effect of
their order / both openly and secretly informynge them with virtue / dyscretly
correctyng such as would forsake their order / and also yt he may cause the
service of god to be dewly kept and performyd in the quyre / and that al fables
and wyldnes may be eschewyd as well in the quyre / as through all the church in
the time of divine service. Nether he shall suffer any yt be under his
obedice^ce to play the wantons: or to speak any inco^uenye^t words. He must be
full of good example at all times / ye and at the table (as much as he can)
must forbid the eaters to use any unlawful co^munycacion he must question
with them of such things as will byld them in virtue / abhorryng all words
inordinate / studyeng and precuryng with all his dylygens that their divine
service be holely / dystynctly / deuoutely and reverently performed and ended /
geuyng them example in coming oftentimes before them to their regular hours
or service. Furdermore (to his power) he must exquisytly procure / keep and
increase / the wealth of his church especyally in spiritual things / evermore
fervently prayeng unto almighty god for them that be co^myttyd unto him: to the
intent that such thing as he can not fulfill or obteigne by rebuke or correccio^
he may obteygne by prayer / keeping always an honest mean both in his
apparayle and also in his fare let him gladly prepare himself co^tynually to
mynystre and celebrate But dylygently let him beware that he give no evil
occasion to any man by inco^tinency or sklau^der / or any other manner of wise
not only being chaste and sobre / but also the example of chastity and sobrenes
/ and ferther the greater number that he must account for unto almighty god /
the more meke ferefull and devout he ought to keep himself. And he that has
need of much grace and favor how much necessary is it / that he be full of
mekenes and humylyte: how incessantly ought the to embrace our savior
Christ. And conuenyently to show him self before god and man both in his
words apparaile goyeng living and all his acts / pride / ambytion / vain
glory / and auaryce have vsyd to statue our rulers and prelates of the church
except they were well grou^dyd and establysshed in the fear of god and devout
excercyse.

In like manner where prelates were wont to be meke and gentyl / now adays they
be comunly proud and malicyous. And some of them for fere or favor of man or
for some vice rolyd in them felse will nothing regard to fulfill the correctyo^s
of thyr predecessors whereunto they be bound as well of charity as of dew
justice but they look more for their own honor and priua^e profit / than for
the honor of god or wel^h of ma^s soul where in if they ons wallow / they do
another regard the spiritual felycite of thyr subjects nor yet of them self
but blinded with ambition and couetyse they fall hedlong into the deep dungynne
of vice. Hereof saint Bernard in his ^oke de Consideracione writyth to pope
Eugenius in this wise. Thou being a man shall not desyer to have domynacyon
over another man lest al vnryghtwysnes have dominacyon over the. For no poison
nor yet ponyshement ought to be more feryd of the than the desire or pleasure /
or domynaco^. Whereupon saint Gregory says thus. The mind of man is proud
enough of it self ye although it be incoraged with no power or prehemyne^ce /
than much rather a man will look alofte wha^ preferreme^t is given him. For
truly as oftentimes as any prelate deliteth to be a master and ruler over men
so often he fallyth in to the sin of apostasy. And who so delyteth in this
world to have prehemynence / he sall not delight to behold his judge Christ.
This folysshe pride a prelate might sone overcome / if wisely profundly and
oftentimes he would behold and ponder ye terrible rigor of gods judgment /
especially concerning prelates the extreme sharpnes of infernal ponyshment /
and also the great negligence of their own life. So a prelate shall repute his
dignite as it were a peynfull bourden / and not as it were a pride and honor /
and shall be careful before god if he mark the words of the apostle / which be
these. It is a fereful thing to fall into the hands of god living / remember
therefore how enorme and damnable it is to get any temporal comodyte or
honors by prelateship and not to fulfill their dew offices / nor yet to
behave the^ like worthy vycars of god.

Against their pride in buyldyng
Seeing (as Vlricus declaryth in his book called Summa) that clerks do make
treasour of such substance as remains besides their necessary ^ co^petent
living / other expendyng it in unlawful uses / as in making rych their friends
or kynsfolke / or other fylthy persons wastyng and co^sumynge their money in
gorgeous and delycate fare / getynge the fame of the world by great expensis /
as geuyng liberal rewardis to gestours or mynstreles / byeng in the favor or
frendshyp of rich and noble men encreasynge a superfluous household of
servants which ofte^tymes must be renewid with costly apparaile or frami^g
great curious and sumptuous buyldynges / or else in such other like uses do
prodigally expend the patrimony of Christ: me think in so doing they do not
only offend i^ the sin of prodigalite as every man does that abusyth that
thing to his own use / which is co^myttyd to him with charge / but also they
make their offense more grievous forbycause they do stele away so expendyd from
the^ that be the very owners thereof (that is to say) the poor people.

Saint Hierom callyth this sin a robbry exceeding al cruelty of thefys: or else
a sacrilege or church robbry / furthermor saint Augustine callyth it plainly
manslauther / saying thus. Whosoever immoderately reseruith to his own use
goods by god dedicate unto the poor / is gylty of the slaughter of so many
men / as have been pore and dyed in their houses for hungre. These regulars
therefore are bound to restitucion of al such things. Such also as unworthily
have receuyd any goods of the church are bound to restitucion as hores
harlattes and bawdes and other fylthy persons of evil demeanor. Of these
things spekyth vlricus whose words in the treatise against pluralitees of
benefyces more plainly do appear. Moreover against pride in building certain
things be rehearsed in his book called Summa virtutum et victorum / in this
manner. In buyldyng five things be not to be co^mendyd. The first is the
multitude of houses / and that agrees with the saying of the prophet I say in
the.v. chapitre saying thus. Woe may you be which join to gether house upon
house Offenders be in the same case which follow not Christ saying thus. The
son of man has no place where he may put his head. The second thing not to
be co^mendyd in buldynge is the greatness sumptuousnes and pleasauntnes thereof.
The pleasauntnes truly is dyscernyd in the colors and pictures thereof. Of this
also it is spoken in the.xxii. chapter of the prophet Jeremy. Fordermore
saint Paul the first heremyte being desired of ye holy father Anthony / asa^d
a questyon whether christen men should follow the facyon of the gentyls in their
sumptuous buyldyng or no^ and he hand say that ye Than greatly he beway^yd
that vanyle considering hi^ was the part of a christen man to say on this
facyon. We have no dwelling place in this world but we do look for a place in
time to cum Therefore whatsoever regulars or mynystetes of the church do
immodera^ly expend in such sumptuous buyldynges it is cruel robbry and
sacrilege as before is said and also they are bound to restitucyon which
restitucyon is to be done unto poor people but for all that there be many now
adays which out of all good order and facyon do excede in such sumtuous and
costly buyldynges.

Of certain ancient laws to avoid pluralytees of benefyces upon whom no
dyspensacyon fallyth / as touching to that is in them of the law natural.
By the means of large lyberal and unreasonable dispe^sacions ye church is
brought to great confusion / and surely in time past holy and fereful popes and
bysshopes did innowyse admyt but evermore prohybyte pluralitees of benefyces
which now adays euerywhere be grau^tyd to one partycular person / ye and
oftentimes to him that another by his co^uersacion or lernyng is worthy to have
one Therefore pope vrbane did institute that it should not be lawful to any man
to be inducte in to.ii. churches but every man to be regular and reside^t in
one church only wherein he is inducte. Another institucion also is co^teigned in
the decretales / and that is this. A clerk from this present time shall not be
nombryd in.ii. churches / for that is but a comodyte of marchau^dyse: or foul
lucre / and the thing that is most far from the good order of the church
whereupon the decree of pope Gregori is thus. We co^mau^d that al benefices of
ye church be comyttyd partycularly to particular persons. Furdermore saint
Bernard alleged as saint Thomas did saye^g thus One i^ person is not one / but
many i^ respect of benefices / therefore they shall be many in respect of their
ponysheme^t for their offense is grievous. Moreover thaut^ of ye bo^^ bees say^.
as here folowith. I will that who / so fortune to read this shall know that I
(from the incarnacion of our lord god. 1437.) was at Paris / where the
honorable Wyllia^ bishop there / made a co^uocacion of al ye masters of the
church / where a question was put forth of pluralite of benefices / and by long
and discrete disputacio^ it was approuyd / that.ii. benefices whereof the one
did amount unto the value of.xv. pounds of paryse might not be kept to ye
wealth of man's soul / and that this bishop of whom we speak before with many
other doctors did finally determyne. And this thing is more plai^ly rehearsed
i^ the work made against pluralytees of benefices / as touching this matter
pope Gregori ye.ix. being examyned whether by his power he might dispe^se with
pluralite of benefices or no / he answered and said. I can dyspe^se for nothing
of pluralites but only for the ponyshme^t of such as keep many benefices / and
therefore let no man rejoice yt any man has with him dispensid for it is but in
vain / but both the law of god and the law of nature is / that no man ought
to coueyte or procure any more te^porall goods than is expedient to virtuous
life or has respect to spirytuall comodite or very salvation. All these
things which here I do breuely touch be more at large contained in the book
against pluralyte of benefices. And verily we ought much rather to give
credaunce unto holy ferefull and famous doctors and to good relygious and
weldisposed people (whom before we have named for witnesses) than to such as
have.ii. benefyces or mo / how connyng so ever they seem to be. For in their
own matters they may give an evil judgment / as it apperyth by this proverb.
Love and hatered subuertyth every judgment.

An exhortacyon unto clerks
THe holy and most d^uoute father saint Bernard says as here folowyth. Let
clerks fete set masters and prelates of ye church fere / which behave them
self so wyckedly in lauds of holy fathers wherein they dwell / not being
contentyd with a competent stypend or living that might suffyse them but
cruelly and theuysshly procuring and reteynyng superfluous possessions where
with the pore people should be sustained / and the same expendyng into their
own carnal and vain use / offendyng with double iniquite / for they do both
spoil other men of their goods / and also abuse the holy and spiritual
goods and substance in their fylth and vanyte. Favor I beseech ye / favor
your seluys / ^auour the blood that was shed for your salvation. Beware of the
horrible peril and danger of hell declyne from the everlasting fire that is
preparyd for you. Morn and lament ye in the myddys of Babylon that is to say
in this wretchyd world / and save your souls / flee to the cy^^es of
spiritual refresshi^g yt is / to very religious cloystres that ye may do
penance for your synnys past that ye may obtain grace in this present life.
Be not stacke to knowledge your syn / for where is abundance of iniquite
there has grace need to be aboundau^t. Let not the sharpnes of penance grieve
you / for the penance of this world be not co^dygne or able to cou^teruayle
our offenses before comytted. Therefore in conclusyon S. Bernard says. If
regulers and other constitute i^ holy ordres be not ready to enter in to
relygion / it shall be sufficient for the^ duly to walk and be co^uersau^t
according to the effect whereunto they be called / or else after the form and
order to them publysshed expoundyd and commaundyd in the third book of
Decretalles Let them also consider the vncertente / breuite and subtilte / of
this present life / the detestable fylthines of sin / the favor and mercy of
gods majesty / ye preciousnes of time that god to us has enlarged / and yt
it be not unfruitfully expe^dyd. Let us look also how fereful our judgment is
/ ye and how sharp and intolerable the infernal ponysheme^t is for us / if
(as god forbid that we should so do) we led our life in carnalyte and
neglyge^ce. Therefore every day let them examyne their consciences and remember
the end / that they may go by a narow and strayt way unto salvation: let them
ferefully use the goods of the church / being evermore conuersaunt in
chastity / sobrenes / devotion. And good example unto the time the charity of
this present life be co^sumid / and than by the mercy of god to be brought unto
the most blessed fruitio^ of everlasting felicite and joys of heaven to the
great laud and praise of god omnipotent which is the most high and blyssed
above all things. Amen.
