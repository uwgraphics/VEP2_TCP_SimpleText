The Frontispeece.
THe Sun is glorious still, and makes day,
Where ever shines his Eternal Ray;
Yet when he sets, so clouds may veil the sky,
That men may think him drownded to the eye.
Fair, strong is Man, if one should say, he will dye,
Scarce can he well believe it, before he try;
But seeing death in others, then he says;
Surely Deaths constant stroke will end my days.
Spring's dainty; Summer vigorous and strong;
Autumn has plenty; Winter dies ere long.
The Sun of Glory set, and then was night,
And darkness, in the true believers sight;
The Eclipse did pass, and He was seen, by all,
Ascending, whether he the world does call.
Let man behold his Savior, he will say,
Welcome sweet death, my Jesus led the way.
Infants, and babes, young men, you strong, and old,
Turn to the right hand, and the Sun behold;
For as He conquers darkness, so we shall
Triumph over death, by Him who conquered All.

ILLVSTRISSIMO ET NOBILISSIMO Domino Dno. ROBERTO KARO, Comiti a Summerset, etc.
AEGyptii inter primos Sapientiae patres, sic sibi consuluerunt, ut laetissimis
ipsorum conviviis sceleton interesset; Cum imperio delati sunt mores; and
Philippus qui Graecam monarchiam fundavit, voluit adolescentem se mortalitatis
suae admonere; ipse Augustus Caesar noluit, sine hoc more, orbi^ imperium
amplecti, qui and micam, and grabatum suum habuit.

Tibi (Nobilis^ime Heroes) hoc mortalitatis symbolum offero; atque eo magis,
quod sciam Te vera Nobilitate praeditum, cui ipsius mortis memoria semper erit
gratissima, cujus nomine ipsa philosophia dignata est. Accipe quaeso,
(Nobilissime Heroes) hoc qualecunque est, humanitatis (...), neque enim ab
hujusmodi studiis ipse abhorres, quum mortis meditationi, and futurae vitae
contemplationi, lucernae tuae oleum soleas impendere: accipe inquam (vere
Heroes) hanc, qua solitus es clementia, animi potius integritatem, quam solertem
exquisiti ingenii velitationem. Meum putabam hoc opusculum, quod mortale esset;
Tu Domine, si Tuum duxeris, immortale proculdubio erit; and quod a meo ingenio
sperare minime potuit; hoc Tuo Genio (nobilis ingeniorum and musarum Pater)
libenter debebit. Vive, and Vale, a cujus ore, and favore, ipsarum charitum and
musarum vitaque and valetudo dependet; Illae jam dediscent Apollinem, Iovemque
suum, and Graecorum numerosos deos implorare; Deum unum, verum, bonum,
supplicibus votis adorabunt, ut Te Patronum, ipso Mecaenate benignior^m and
camem magis, hicin terris, omni honor, postea in Coelis, omni felicitate and
beatitudine accumulet. Effata pronunciat

Celsitudini Tuae addictissimus ROBERTUS FARLAEVS.

To the Author.
FAme pluckes a pinion from the wings of Time,
Dips it in nectar, graves thy mighty rhyme
Within her brazen sheets, makes envy stand
(Mauger her heart) and light her duskie brand:
Whilst she in crimson letters writes: These, these,
Shall be the whole worlds Ephemerides.
Did not Urania loose thy fettered mind,
Out* of the clayeie prison, and resigned
Her place to it? did not thy purer lay
Flow from the fountain of the Milkie way?
Did not she dictate to thee, how to skan
These months of woe, this Almanacke of man?
An Almanacke that never shall b' out of date,
But last as long as time, as firm as fate.
She did, (hear, envy, hear and burst) and by
Her staff thou took'st the height of Poetry:
The Arcadian Shepherds shall make thee their star,
And place this next to Tityrus Calendar.
Like to another Phoebus thou do take
Thy twelvemoneths task through life's short Zodiac:
But these are too too narrow bounds for thee,
Eeach month's an age, each age eternity.
The names, not nature's of the months, I see
Described in thy caelestiall poetry.
Fresh May and lusty June triumph alone
In thy warm breast, December there is none.
Envy her self can find no fault but this,
Perfect thy months, thy globe imperfect is.
No parallel is seen in all thy sphere,
Besides too, no Equator does appear.
E. Coleman.

To the Author.
SOme use to flatter worth by too much Praise;
Who rather do detract than give him Bays,
Who merits it: And some again betray
Like some course Prologue to a courser Play)
The Authors Subject; both are bad: but I
Will none of both: rather I will belie
^esert, and say this Poem speaks thee vain:
For to speak truth, I Am angry with thy Strain;
For that it is so short: (though sweet) expect,
^le tax thee always with that small defect.
Yet (out of Policy) perhaps thy Lyre
Thou layd'st aside so soon, least we Expire;
And the chief cause proceed from thence: For it is
Certain, as too much grief is mortal, so of bliss.
All I will say, is, my belief is such
That aftertimes will thank thee for this touch:
And such my Charity, I wish it may
Out live the last, and longest Summers day,
And that this present Age, may please to give
It pleasant smiles; and help its Hope to live.

TO THE COURTEOUS READER.
The Roses.
PRoc^e did fly, and Parti-colour'd Flora
Now felt soft nipping colds breath from Aurora,
And Phoebus, usherd with the cooler day,
Gave warning to prevent his scorching ray;
While I the checkerd gardens walked along,
Seeking refreshment dainty flowers among,
I saw the fragrant herbs bending their tops,
With pearle-like dew hanging in silver drops;
And in the Coleworts cabbines I did see,
The queeres of Nectar dancing joyfully,
I saw the Rose beds in their Pestan weeds,
Wet with the foame of Phoebus neighing steedes;
The tender buds did in their night-geare stand,
Of hoary plush, wrought by dame Natures hand,
Ready to put it off, when they did spy
Days charriter coursing along the sky;
One might have doubt, whether the Heaven did dye
The Roses, or they purple-paint the sky:
The Sun and Rose, were in one liv'ry clad,
For they one Lady Aphrodite had;
Perhaps one smell they had, but that as higher
Evanish'd, this breathed sweetly from the brier*
How many minutes draws forth an hour,
So many habits changed this curious flower;
It sometimes nimph-like, mantled was in grenee,
Wearing a cap much like the Fairy Queen:
Sometimes it woare a comely purple crest,
And had its hair in anticke fashion dressed;
Then by and by her breast unlac'd, to show
What heavenly fragrant Nectar did thence flow;
At last sh'unvail'd herself, and showed her face,
To Phoebus, with a modest blushing grace;
Her dandling tresses wreathed like threads of Gold.
Scarce without envy Titan could behold;
But lo dame Natures darling, which just now
Did flourish naked stands, I know not how;
Of so great glory then, I thought it strange,
To see so sudden and so sad a change,
The Rose to bud, to blossom in her prime,
To fade, to fall, to wither at (...) time;
Then for her mantle green, a murry clout
All torn did hang her ghastly looks about;
The cap* the purple crest and all was gone,
Baldness her wrinckled head did seize upon*
O what a sight it was to see her lie
Upon her mothers lap ready to die!
Small comfort had the earth, to see her brood
Plucked from her milky breasts, and bathed in blood;
Phoebus who rising from the glassie streams
Did court this Virgin with his cheerful beams,
Going to bed he sees the naked thorn,
And cannot love her 'cause she is forlorn.
So long as lasts a day, a Rose may live,
That day does kill the Rose, which life did give:
A Virgin in the morning, and at noone
Which had her prime, becomes decrepit soon.
So pull the Rose, and think, when thou do see
It Is brittle beauty, that it points to Thee.
Farewell.
Pullulo.

I bud.



VER.
Martius sive Natalis.
FAbrica multiplicem quae sic glomeratur in orbem,
Tam variis faecunda bonis, tot daedala formis,
Vnda priusquam pontus erat, Terra arida centrum;
Nutabatque levi vertigine stellifer orbis;
Sordebat deforme chaos, primordia mundi
Parturiens, rerum and discordi semine praegnans:
Talis origo hom^nis, magni compendia mundi
Corporis exigui angusto qui limite claudit,
Empyrei scintilla priusquam vivida Caeli
Vita auget, sensu movet, aut ratione gubernat,
Ante sibi quam Elementa legant dis^ord^a seeds,
Organaque, affectusque animae and parentia membra,
Ante suum referat quam Iovae patris Imag^
Ad Coelos atque astra genus, vultumque supinet;
Putrescit genitura rudis* communia vermi
Semina sortitus, limacisque aemula cunis:
Sed tamen hos artus augustos fingit in artus
Cura^ei, immensum ex nihilo quae excudit olympum.
Quali^ frugiserae concredita semina Terrae
Ceu tumulo defossa, jacent in viscere sulci;
Nasc^ndi virtu^ tamen and genitab^tis arvi
Natura, hyberni defendit frigoris i^ as,
Quadrupedis donec Phryxaei cornua scandit
Phoebus, and illustri radio, foetoque calore
Inque diem, and Coeli vitales elicit auras:
Talis ho^o c^cis uteri jacet embryon antris
Naturae ingeniosae opus, and compago recentis
Lactea ceu massae teneros coalescit in artus.
Semina habent siliquas, tegitur massa inque volucri^
Pelliculae, cognata ipsi quae fascia crevit.
Tum Deus inspirante animam qua vivida surgunt
Omnia, divinae largitur particulam aurae.
Conjugium firmat stabile hic Hymen^us Olympi;
Nubit terra polo, decus immortale caduci
Corporis ingluviem consortem in saecula ducit.
Sic ne ergo (hei miserae) impura cum conjuge vivet
Virgo anima, and castis contagia prendet in ulnis?
Sed been quod furvis coeant, sine luce, tenebris,
Teda suo impuram prodat ne lumine sponsam.
Quid fi animae vox ulla foret? quam triste queratur
Se c^elum mutasse luto, and caligine lucem,
Vel Ionae similem, superis desedibus imum
In ceti cecidisse uterum, noctemque profundam*
Aemula Tartareo domus est habitanda barathro,
Gurgusti piceus carcer, pistrina malorum.
C^rnimus hic quoties jactari, dum impete facto
Rumpere vallatae conatur vincula vulvae;
Saepe etiam ingreditur mox egressura, perosum
Sic antri hospitium, sic diversoria sordent;
Cernere (pro dolor) est foecundae viscera matris
Esse urnam foetus, intestinumque sepulcrum.
Mitte sed infaustos casus, and respice partus
Quos natura volet, praescripta lege, labores;
Tormina, convulsique artus, trepidique dolores,
Et gen^um cordisque tremor, lamenta, duellum
Tale cient inter matrem natumque tumultus
Qualis avernales, vento subeunte, cavernas
Concitat, in tremulos tollens ima antra tumores.
Ergone praenovit venturae incommoda* vitae
Nondum natus Homo, lucemque exterritus odit?
Sic pugnans contra matrem, and molimina partus
Vipereo miseram exanimavit more parentem.
Credideris animam sordentem labe paterna
Nolle subire diem, ne se suus inquinet error,
Ne cum damnatis exclamet forte catervis;
O utinam mihi natalis lux nulla fuisset.
Ast ubi nunc infans uterina repagula rup^^*
Symbola secum adfert vitae manifesta futurae:
Dextram protendens, manuum mercede b^atum
Se fore demonstrat; pede nudo triste capessi^
Vitae iter, and superum adventat p^regrinus ad auras.
Vtcunque ingreditur nudus, lacrymabilis infans
Doctior ad fletum est, rudiorque ad c^tera natus.
Vagitus cudit lacrymas non verba querelae,
Vae been quum nequeat fari, (va) t^istius edit:
Thr^icio sic more, suis natalibus infans*
Sollicitat luctus, etiam sine voce, loquentes.
Omen habet vitae partus; portendit acerbus
Hic dolor and Labor, humanos tristesque labores.
Naturae praescripta manet Lex; usp^^e luctu
Vt nascatur Homo, comiteque hoc pergat ad O^^um*
Natura exponit nudum mors excutit, u^na
Excipit, and nudum Proserpina manibus addit.

Ergo quum partus rudimenta nostri
Inchoet damni, renovato me^tem
Integram (Christ) ut videam parentis
Tecta beata.
Hunc novum partum comites sequuntur
Anxij cordis tremuli timores,
Flumina in largas lacrymas soluta, et
Turba dolorum.
Hunc susurrantis tacitum querelae
Murmur, and tristis fremitus Leonis
Temperat, luctus Pelicani ad instar
Triste querentis
Gaudium and luctus parit ille vitae
Coelitis, verae pietatis ante --
Ambulo in terris, superas Olympi
Ducit ad arces.
Tunc gena moestis lacrymis carente,
Et cohaeredes Domino, beato
Possumus nostri patris intueri
Lumine vultus.
Invicem luctus nova cantilena
Panget aeterni decus Haleluja,
Et novum carmen modulis sonorum
Audiet Ether.
APRIL.
O What a pleasure is it to see
My new-sprung bud, which will be tree!
The glist'ring grass with Phoebus ray
Does make me cheerful look, and gay:
But (ah!) if these my Flowers should die,
Lord what would then become of me.
I Will tell thee, this thy brood will wither,
Do not despare, you will have another.
Aprilis sive Infantia.
QValis odoriserum foecundans imber Aprilem
Flore novo Martis lactentia germina vestit,
Nectare Olympus alit dulci, Phoebusque calore,
Frigora ne exurant, nimius vel torreat aestus*
Sic gremio charae matris dum tollitur infans,
Ne necet importuna fames, and tristis egestas,
Nectareo de font bibit spumantia lacti^
Flumina, quae gemino mammarume tubere manant.
Saepe novercatur Natura, aut turgida fastu
Nectaris hos gaudet genitrix occludere rivos;
Ergo ubi non possunt duram exorare parentem,
Mendicant aliunde, luparumque ubera sugunt;
Saepe eti^m tantum oderunt sua pignora matres,
Sustineant solis ut nata exponere sylvis;
Tunc superant pietate ^erae volucresque parents,
Dant alienigenis quando ubera mutua natis:
Deposuit rabiem lupa, dum lactaret alumnos,
Rom^ tuos, matrem and dominae se ostenderet orbis:
Ast illi cum lacte lupae suxere furorem,
Fraternoque urbem stabilivit sanguine frater.
Exposuit quem dirus avus, jussitque necari,
Ille canis foeta a mamma lactante pependit,
Inde sitis semper tenuit vesana cruoris,
Praedandique fames, humano sanguine donec
Immersum caput, and satiatum caede natavi^.
Degenerem toties patriis est cernere pro^em
Moribus, averso tanquam sit sidere nata,
Nutricis cum lacte bibat quo^ semina morum,
Imbutusque semel fuerit quo parvus odore
Infans, hunc redolet maturis auctior annis.
Vbere jam satur est puer, incunabula somnu^
Poscit, ubi tremulis agitatur nutibus, inter
Motunque and requiem, miserae dans symbola vitae,
Cujus, ceu navis, medijs jactatur in undis
Spe^que metumque inter, nec cessat, lumina donec
Mors claudat Longoque Orci ^et fessasopori,
Ramicibus sed ne turgentibus ilia rumpat,
B^anda soporifero de^ulcet carmine nutrix.
Infantis vel nulla ^tas a crimine ^ura,
Est insons, fraudis non gnara, exp^rsque nocendi,
Innumeris tamen illa malis o^noxia vita,
Ludibriumque recens casus, and sortis iniquae est;
Quod si crudeles Herodes asper^t iras,
Inno^uo infantes maculabunt sanguine ferrum.
Obijce formicas quantumvis Graecia Midae,
Mellificasque Platonis ^pes, facundia linguae
Enthea quei^ portenta, and cornu* copia rerum est;
Tristibus auspi^ijs sed nostra infantia surgit,
Contemplatur aves sc^vas, quas omnia dira
Infaustant, rata quae facit aetas plena dolorum,
Tristitiae, luctus, curae, d^rique laboris.
Hoc solo felix, miserum quod nesciat infans
In medijs sese esse malis, careatque timore*

Cum meae matris niveo liquore
Nectaris, tetrum sceleris reatum
Imbibi, primi patris inquinatus
Labe cruenta.
Addidi vitae proprium nefandae
Crimen, annosque in vitiis peregi,
Meque fatal^ capulo propin quu^
Detinet error.
Christ dacunas pictatis, atque
Grati^ ^tatem teneram, priusquam
Parca peccato gravidae senectae
Finiat annos.
Vagit infans haec anima* o salutis
Author, infirmam satura beato
Lacte, and oeterno saturato divi
Nectare verbi.
Ablue, o sordes uteri, meique
Criminis naevos, placida quiet
Vt tui regni fruar, and piis tur --
-- Malibus addar.
Ne sin^s vani hanc modulo sopiri
Carminis, Siren recinet dolosa
Qua^e; sed Caeli v^giles ocellos
Tendat ad arces.
Neve mergatur rapidis procellae
Fluctibus, prendas Domine in tuumque
Suscipe amplexum; patrias Olymp^
Defer ad arces.
Sic Tuoe, a cunis (Deus) ass^efiet
Grati^, tu sic animam hanc amabis
Et Tibi grates aget hoec perennes
Invicem amato.
NOw are my Flowers with Aurora dight,
And Flora sees her long wisht-for delight*
Each Tree a Quire, each Leaf a Bird does bear,
All singing Harmony to Heavens Sphere;
The Lambkins skipping trip, they dance and play,
This is the glory of the month of May.
Remember Flowers fade, come will the night,
When Nightingale shall sing from Mortals sight.
Maius sive Pueritia.
GErmina quoe genuit Mars, quae lactavit Aprilis
Nunc geminant decus, and Maij pinguntur honor
Vndique Pestano sic splendent cuncta nitore
Vt gnarae Natura rudis contendere dextroe
Artificis possit; Zephyritis gramina pingit,
Gramina Panchaeos supra fragrantia indos.
Plumea genus auras tenui modulamine mulcet,
Aeraque, and sylvas, habitantem and montibus Echo:
Talis Homo puer in teneros quando emicat annos,
Securas fallens inter sua gaudia luces:
Add alas, Coeli credas stellantis alumnum
Pennigerum, tamrara novae stat gratia formae:
Huic cedant pictis albentia Lilia campis,
Aemula Sithonijs invibus, puroque elephanto;
Huic cedant biferi rubicunda rosaria Pesti;
Punicat ingenuos tam pulchra modestia vultus.
Pancheum pueri spirant precordia amomum
Assyriosque balant accensi thuris honores,
Impar queis sordet medicatae copianaris.
Permultos avium seducit ad avia cantus,
Certatubi turdus merulis, ubi Lucari acanthis
Consonat, and noctem sylvoe citbaristria mulcet;
Me juvat ingenui vocem exaudire puelli,
Dum teneros fingit sermones aure magistra,
Aemula syderibus cui adamantina Lumina fulgent,
Qualia in humanos defigit stellio vultus:
Gratia jucundat faciem, simplexque venustas,
Totus amor, Venerisque decus, pignuszue parentum est.
Adspice, sed tempus gaudet quo fallere Ludo,
Ingenium artificis mentitus, and arma, manumque,
Sive equitat mulo Mariano, aut agmina ducit,
Sive molam condit, celsae vel maenia turris,
Cereus ingenio cunctas se fingit ad arts,
Aemulus aetatis maturae, cuncta recenter
Spectat, and est vitae, quam cernit, simius actae,
Ne, nimium miseri tamen exultate parents,
Praecocia haec durus comitetur gaudia moeror:
Cernitis, ut pictae pubes Alahandica Florae
Marcescit, nudamque relinquit saucia spinam:
Nulla nitet tessellati sic gloria veris,
Imbriferi quam non affla^us destruat Austri:
Si semel imbriferitetigit contagio morbi,
Languent membra, fugitque decus mirabile formae:
Pallentes artus, tristique gravedine pressum
Tunc caput, immodicam condemnant jure parentunc
Laetitiam, e geminis oculorum fata fenestris
Prospiciunt, gelidoque meat vix ore mephitis:
Improba vis morbi cogit mutare querelis
Blanditias, tenerosque sales, linguaque lepores:
Maximatum superant majores gaudia luctus,
Mutanturque vices tristi tum funere laetae.
Hic sudum affulsit, Borea impendente procella,
Hic posuit mare tranquillum, sed fluminis iras
Parturiente salo, meditanti and praelia vento.
Ah! quid fata fugit? mortali propria vitae
Res est nulla, dedit quae sors, mors omnia raptat.

Gratiae vires, Deus O, recentis
Suffice, infans haec puerascataetas,
Discat ut certos magis and magis pes
Figere gressus.
Passibus dum Te sequor haud secundis
Christ, praecedas jubar aequitatis,
Te neque aspectu, O animae redemptor,
Subtrahe nestro.
Cerne, quo pacto vagulus vacillat
Gressus, and fract^s animos adauge,
Er^gas, quando titu^o, salutis,
Anchora certoe.
Vt vioelongos tolerem Labores,
Ferto opem lasso, ex^ilara dolentem
Et retrectantem male, gratuitis
Allice donis.
Dum vioe angustas meo per salebr as,
Adjuva, and dextra stabilito plantam;
Quasque largiris pueris, Olympi
Ducito ad arces.
Tunc ero Coeli Empyrei minister
Aliger, diva specie decorus,
Talis and ducam nihili beatos,
Nestoris annos.
Jam messis in Herba.

This will be Wine.



AESTAS.
Iunius, sive Adolescentia.
CVrvati quum Phoebus equos, per brachia Cancri,
Cogit anhelantes, acclivi in vertice coeli,
Fervidiore calet radio tunc florida Tellus,
Et primae faetus adolescunt flore juventae,
Letas promittunt fruges, and signa futuri
Dant fructus, avidumque beat spes prima Colonum:
Humanae tali florescit ephebia vitae,
Cum pia scintillant coelestis semina flammae.
Hoec rudis ingenij moles sed cerea, Lambi
Poscit, and est Ratio studio formanda colendi.
Humani generis pater ex quo tempore lapsus,
Humanae in cineres mersa est s^intillula mentis,
Non nisi inexhausto jam recuperanda Labor,
Gemma velut Stygio Lethes in gurgite mersa
V^inatoris dextra expiscanda profundo est.
Tempus erat quo stabat homo de stirpe deorum,
Dotibus ingenij plusquam mortalibus auctus:
Arbitrij sed frena regentem devius error
Abflulit, and recto aver sum de tramite flexit:
Inde sumus stirpis pravoe vitiosa propago,
Degeneres sancti primeva ab origin Coeli,
Nascimur ignari rerum, virtutis inanes
Omnigenoe, veluti picto^is rasa tabella
Inscribenda notis queis vis, tamen oblita nullis.
Nam veluti distorta recens que pullulat arbor
Corrigitur, quamdiu lactenti cortice mollet,
Solliciti teneros animos sic cura magistri,
Et cultura Scholae tortum, sed molle refingit
Ingenium, studijs and cerea pectora format,
Cortinae quem certa Sophum suffragia primum
Dixerunt, quondam a vultus censore sophista
Damnatus vitij, and tacitoe, insulsoe que ^amilloe.
Talem vitales primum se luminis auras
Hausisse ai^bat, diro sub sidere natum;
Posteased factum Sophiae Coelestis alumnum,
In melius mutasse animum, Ge^iumque malignum;
Quum bonad lapidat genitor, juga dura subire
Compellit natos duri tristisque laboris;
Quam gravis (ab) labor est lapsum reparare parentis,
Et nunquam tamen a^issas attingere dotes!
Naturae nascentis erant elementa loquendi,
Cornea quae pueris nunc abecedaria monstran:
Ac veluti folijs oracula scripta Sibyllae
Pen^lopes opus est, salvo componere sensu,
Literulas sic liter^l^s conjungere oportet
Syllabae ut a^crescant, quarum farragine vcces
Dum fiunt, operam crebro damnamus inaxem.
Nunc fluxa and fragilis, fuerat firmissima quondam
Mneme, depositi custos firmissima, proma --
Conda penus nostri, loculis sensata reponens,
Depromensque eadem, si quando posceret usus;
Fidit sed mnemae qui nunc, in pulvere scribit
Sensa animi, aut fluxoe frustra committit arenae:
Nunc vaga congertes rerum, coecique recessus
Confundunt species, veliniqua obliterat atas.
Obstat saepe ^bi rerum male congrua moles
Fermentata Chao, infausto partuque laborat;
Dumque homo rimat^r cerebrum, quae scrinia pulse^
Nescit, and insano similis stat pharmacopolae,
Omnia scrutatur, nec quod petit, invenit usquam
Cogimur hinc nimium fragili d^ffidere mnemae,
Et chartis mandare alta molimina mentis,
Sic mutis vox viva tacet concredita libris;
Quumque foret quondam patulis mos auribus artem
Haurire, ^ tacitis nunc est discenda magistris,
Atque legenda oculis, variis vox picta siguris.
Singula nce tamen haec prosunt, quo nescio fato,
Saepe latet tantis hominis m^ns pressa tenebris;
Nil salit a laeva; pigri de more caballi
Promovet haud, quamvis virgas calcaribus ^ddas.
Quam gravis (ah) labor est nobis, quae perdidit hor^
In nullos reparare dies, lateremque lavare.
Dicite Adamigenae pomo quid vilius uno?
Et tamen hoc tantos potuit generare Labores.

O qui Mosaici dogmata foederis
Impubis poteras pandere patribus
Iudae, sc^ta tui da mih^ noscere
Patris, morigerum redd^t^ legibus
Coeli. Cimmerijs men's mea caecutit
Caligans tenebris, pandito Lumina.
Non me sic uteri crimina polluunt;
Nec ^orum impietas inquinat unguibus
Me sic a teneris, quin tua gratia
A foed^ uteri sordibus expiet,
Et morum macul^s unica diluat.
Dotes ingenij quas m^nuit pater
Humani generis, gratia sarciet.
Fac me, Coriste, tuae discipulum Schola,
Censura ferulae leniter uteri,
Pendas proque meis verbera viribus.
ARies was strong. Taurus did stronger prove,
Then Gemini did double heat and love:
Cancer who mounted, straight returned again,
That Leo might courageous remain;
Till Virgo with her fruitful, hopeful ears
Do relish well the Farmers greedy fears.
Since Signs for Mortals good can so agree,
To Heaven let every one most thankful be.
Julius, sive Ephebia.
FLavus ubi aestivos Quintilis promovet ortus,
Exhilaran^ blandum radijs ferventibus annum,
Luxurians arbor fructus matural adultos,
Foeta sui, similem tentat producere prolem:
Talis Homo quum floriferos adolescit ad annos,
Parturit, and Genij specimen maturius edit;
Pullulat ingenij foetus quem cura Magistri
Lambit, and ursino deformem more refinxit.
Tunc vitae molitus iter se accingit ad artem
Vivendique modum; nec enim sunt ocia tuta.
Progenies Hybl^ veluti fragrantia rura
Pervolat, ac Fiorae lactentia germina libat,
Parsque rosas carpit, pars sugit amabile nectar
Narcissi, aut stimulis albentia lilia tentat,
Mill legunt florum succos, and mill viarum
Ambages Lustrant, una est sed meta laboris:
Tam varijs fertur studijs fervent^or aetas
Fatorum quum lege trabit sua que^que voluptas:
Aesopi haud major calvis currentibus error,
Sensibus humanis quam stat sententia discors;
Sed tamen ad metam vitae contend^tur unam,
A tegete, and tristiquae defendenda baci^io est.
Quam variae rerum species, quot membra, quot artus
Corporis hum^ni quot sunt molimina mentis,
Deliciae quot sunt sensus, vitijsque laborat
Quam varijs male-sanus homo, bona denique quot sunt
Quot mala; tot prostant arts, queis quoerimus illa,
H^^ vitamus; and est vitae multiplic is Hydra.
Cara fuit, mundo nascente parabile victus
Esse penu, tutoque, ^udi licet, indui amictu;
Ingeniosa adeo mortalia pectora vexit
Luxuries nunc, ut Terras, o^bemque fatiget.
Discendae sunt mill arts, si fingere ad unguem
Ingenium humanum, mores, and tempora poscas;
Luxuries sic forte juvat, quod mill nepoti
Artifices debent tolerandoe commoda vitae.
Esuriunt quando latis animantia campis,
In mundo dat Terra dapes, dant pocula lymphae;
Dira fames hominem quoties ad turpia cogit,
Infandas acuens spes and rodens?
Importuna fames moro sae debita cessit
Paena gulae: justa nemesi sic numina plectunt;
Illicit as gustare dapes homo fortiter ausus,
Saepe nequit licitis jejunia pellere mensis.
Sudandum est igitur, (vendunt dij cuncta labor)
Ante suum misero quam pandat Edulia cornu,
Sollicitae sic dura capessens munia vitae
Degener aquali factus origin, cernit.
Interea arrectas quae vox mihi verberat aures
Ocia tuta beans tranquillaque castra Minervae,
Musarumque leves choreas, placidosque recessus,
Permessi saltus, and flumma grata poetis?
Invidiae vox est laudans diversa sequentes;
Damocles celsa recubet si sede Tyranni,
Nulla laborabit jucundum musa soporem.
Vt venias hedera dignus, tua lumina somnum
Saepe vident nullum? an studio macrescit imago?
Iapetonidae volucres sunt cura, laborque,
Pervigil, and studij sitis implacata profundi.
Horologi fusum veluti, fraenumque, rotasque
Spira regit, secumque suo conamine raptat:
Anxta sic curis quum men's distracta laborat,
Nulla loporiferam sentiscunt membra quietem.
Aasp^ce cognatas cyclon qui circinat arts,
Quam miserae vitae dispendia quanta catenet.
Primigenae quia dedidicit vernacula linguae,
Cogitur ignotas Babylonis discere voces;
Quodque prius dederant cunae, nunc vix capitaetas;
Si numeres linguas, Mithridates occidit infans.
Est homini tantilla fides, sine Rhetoris orte
Nesciat ut sibi concordes inducere sensus,
Quodque nequit ratio fucato suadeat ore,
Verbaque det levibus toties diffundere ventis.
Caligat tantis acies interna tenebris,
Confusaeque latent species, Platonis ut annus
Eruere hanc satagat cariosae sorde librorum,
Qui ratione probant hominem rationis egentem:
Dum numeros nectit numeris, dum millibus auget
Millia, dum paribus distingutt littora micis.
Dum numerat stellas, guttis discriminat aequor,
In levae digito fluxos sibi computat annos.
Dulce melos, tristis quamvis medicina doloris
Dicitur, hoc tamen (ah) lacrymarum sluctus acerbat,
Dum fatum recolens effundit flebile carmen,
Qualicient memores vicinae mortis olores.
Quam dolet! astrif. rum radio dum mensus Olympum,
Hic contemplatur radiantes eminus orbs,
Nec licet ad patrias sursum contendere seeds,
Vnde genus traxit cognata ab origin Divum.
Denique dum variodescribit schemate Terras
Quinque secans zonis, distinguens climate lucem
Maxima quae vertit cyclis solaribus annum,
Convexum paribus mensurans passibus orbem,
Qua jubar auricomum Terris oriensque cadensque,
Punicat equoreas piscosae Tethyos undas
Quaque dies medium q^a nox dispe^cit Olympum,
Respiciens modulum ipse suum; quid metior, inquit,
Hanc molem, Archytas prope littus dona matinum
Pulveris ex^gui poscit, cur mente rotundum
Percurro Coelum moriturus; stamina vitae
Parca mihi simul ac secuit: septempeda corpus
Exanimum, tumuli angusto mihi limite claudet.
Cernere mortalem est plures adolescere ad annos,
Aerumnasque simul, tristique inolere dolori:
Hoc tantum est miseri for san solamen Ephebe,
Praterijsse aliquas lapso cum tempore curas.

Coelestis Genitor, quoe mare coerulum
Quoe Tellus viridans, and liquidi oetheris
Nutrit hoec regio, Te Dominum suum
Agnoscunt, Patulae munera dexterae
Exposcuntque tuae: Tu saturas dape
Quicquid te precibus sollicitat Deum.
Corvus non didicit vertere vomere
Telluris gravidae sa xea viscera,
Optatis epulis non tamen indiget.
Nunquam pensa trahunt candida lilia,
Flora at luxuriant splendida syrmate,
Quali Rex Solymoe non nituit pies.
Curis distraberis men's mea, cur metis
Quassaris, stabilem spem tibicolloca
Inrerum Domino, qui dabit omnia
Quoe vitoe fragili commoda senserit.
Sed ne debilitent ocia languidam
Mentem, luxuria and pectora diffluant,
Hydrae multiplicis ne mala pullulent:
Quo vitam tolerem, munere da frui
Artis, qua senium sustineat meum,
Et victu invalidos sustineat dies.
Me quae so Aethereis dotibus instrue,
Quadratas fabricae dum lego literas,
Coelorum speculans tam varias vias,
Et tot pennigeros aeris incolas,
Et tot pinnigeros Aequoris ordines,
Tot vernantis humi ^aedala germina,
Errantesque greges, silvicolas feras,
Rimatusque mei scrinia pectoris,
Artus, atque animam, donaque coelitus
Augusti tenebris abaita corporis.
Te rerum Dominum, munificum patrem
Agnoscam, Aethereis laudibus efferens
Dones, me aligeris civibus addito,
Aerumnis dederit mors requiem meis.
What Plough and harrow with laborious toil,
Did trust to mother earth, and fruitful soil;
Astraea, justice Scepter who can sway,
To Sickle and the Barn does that repay;
The Husbandman he will now weep no more;
When just Astraea shows him hope of store.
The Gods are just, let men then pious be,
To use their blessings with sobriety.
Augustus sive Iuventus:
PHoebus quum blandis Astraeae amplexibus haeret,
Et cultos maturat agros, tunc germina Terrae
Omnigenos pariunt fructus, pars foeta veneno,
Nectare pars dulci, virtus non omnibus vna est:
Talis Homo aetatis juvenili robore gliscit,
Actae dans specimen vitae, signumque futurae.
Vt cinerae quae immersa latet scintilla, coruscat
Et rapit ardentem crepitanti in fomite flammam:
Sic Natura prius teneris male debilis annis,
Nunc fervore viget venarum and robore nervi.
Vina velut generosa cadis spumantia fervent,
Exertantque novas per caeca foramina vires:
Sic fermentatae Iuvenis fervore juventae
Exerit affectus vires, gaudetque tumultu.
Non citius levibus stipulis Vulcanius ardor
Grassatur, juveni quam men's correpta furore
Flagrat, and insulsae probat enthyememata falsa
Esse Stoae, virtuti animos affectibus addens.
Sic domuit matutinum Pelloe decus orbem,
Et capita Alcides dirae demessuit Hydrae,
Rettulit and vellus Phryxaeum Dorica pubes
Ducens Argivam per inhospita coerula pinum.
Passio virtutis cos est and acuminat ausus,
Saepe etiam exitium languens calcaribus urget.
Persephones male sanus amor sub Tartara misit
Perithoum, Stygiasque domos penetrare coegit.
Praeceps ira truces in mutua vulnera fratres
Compulit, atque odium cinerum post busta superstes.
Materno foedare manus vindicta cruore
Horrendae jussit fitientem caedis Oresten.
Sic dolor Ajacem fregit male sanus, ut ensis
Vim proprii fer^et, fortemque ad vulnera dextram,
Haec ignara modi intensis affectibus aetas
Fertur, and est pra^i penitus studiosa juventus,
Artibus aut intenta bonis, and gnara studendi,
In nimios semper timor est ne exardeat ausus.
Haec aetas juvenes bivii ad divortia ducit,
Constitit Alcides quondam quo incertus eundi.
Altera lat a via est, and multo flore decord
Vndique Pestani veris subridet honor,
Vberibus Cereris crescunt ubi munera sul^is,
Nectareos latices Bacchi carchesia fundunt,
Mollia ^ycnaeis stant pulvinaria plumis,
Vndique Panchaeos spirant and aromata odores,
Aligeriqu^ chori mulcent concentibus auras,
Vernantesque rep^ent tremulo modulamine sylvas.
Hic levibus recubat plumis fucata Voluptas
Floribus in mediis and s^avia cinnama spirat.
Deliciosa jacet, facies ostentat amores,
Lumina fidereo splendent accensa nitore,
Tota lepos (qualis parebat ab aequore Cypris)
Mellitas voces, and verba papavere condit,
Est externa soris species, and gratia vultus;
Pectoris interni at pateat si forte recessus,
Foeda latet scabies picto male discolor ori;
Pigmento quocunque animum cerussat, amaror
Cord latet, dolor exanimans and turpis egestas.
Aemula luminibus Basilisci lumina tollunt
Evita quodcunque vident, ceu noxia Siren
Cantat, Niliaci aut fletu insidiatur alumni;
Sed lacrymis ne creed, scatent quae fraud, metuque;
Pocula Cir^^i^ praebet medicata venenis,
Lethaeam misce^s Loton, virusque rubetae;
Inque sues homines vertit, caprosque salaces,
Rugentesque feras, and mimos cercopithecos,
Saepe scyphis madidos deponit, pectora vino
Accendens, socio mox restinguendo cruore;
Denique tam lautas damnum exitiale corona^
Delicias, mortis miserae praenuncia tabes,
Nervorum vel dira lues, aut hectica febris,
Aut laterum dolor, and stagnans pituita fatigat
Sic miseros, dirae cupiant ut taedia vitae,
Et quamcunque petant, nequeant quum vivere, mortem.
Quod si quis Polemo primos disperdidit annos
Imprudens, castam luxu tentare juventam
Ausus, jamque Sophi monitis resipiscere tandem
Incipit, and Baccho sacras lacerare corollas;
Tal^s erit saecli Phoenix, rarissimus ales,
Q(...) cum piceis cycnus secat era pennis;
Co^^uetudo malitam caeco pectora callo
Ob^urat, nequeant ulla ut molle scerecura,
Sic vi^iat Genij dotes, sic inquinat aurae
Particulam, ut sibi naturae jus vendicet omne,
Pristina nec profit studiosi cura magistri,
Quam penitus dirus peccandi obliterat usus.
Proh dolor! ergo parens genuit Natura bea^um
Indole, quae laetae gest ^at semina frugis?
Ergone lactabat matter, primosque fovebat
Carmine vagitus, omen mentita secundum,
Curaque sollicitis est demandata, magistris;
Scilicet ut pubes primo sub flore periret?
Altera dura via est, acclivi trami^e callem
Augustans, nisi grassanti non pervia dextrae.
Sent scatet multa, nudis stat semita spinis,
Hanc stipant dirae monstrorum hinc inde catervae,
Qualia Tartarei servant penetralia Regis.
Hic sua mordaces posuere cubilia curae,
Hic tremuli genibus stant pallentes^ne timores;
Illic pervigiles acie flammante dracones,
Ignea queis somno^on mulcet lumina Morpheus;
Improbus and vanus lahor hic ad culmina moniis
Sisypheum volvit saxum frustraque revolvit.
I^lic exanguis stat Desperatio f^^ces
Vix laqueo stringens, vitamque exosa fatiscit.
His adversa venit lymphatis passio turmis,
Ordinibusque instructa ferocia ventilat arma;
Ira oculos ardens, torvo succensa furore
Aetheria de sede Iovem turbare minatur,
Hanc comitatur Eris, facibusque incendia mundo
Dira parat, gaudens orbem miscere tumultu;
Hic veco^s odium tacito sub pectore celat
Horrendum scelus, and diras excogitat arts;
Imprudens tensos hic scandit Abulia funes,
Et non sueta prius tentare pericula gaudet;
Ceratis hic vana petit ^p^s Aethera pennis,
Icar^o ardentem visens conamine Solemn.
Haec angusta via horrendis scatet undique monstris,
Et vitae innumeris est interclusa periclis,
Sed tamen incolumes hac virtus ducit alumnos
Extrema ut vitent, ne pes hinc inde vacillet:
Quoque magis per Maea^dri curvamina pergant,
Ipsa Ariadnaeo regit hos Prudentia filo
Mox Arete, fidae comites Constantia and Ardor
Pectoris, infractos animos currentibus addunt;
Spem fove^ hic, monstratque intentas ^min^s arcet
Virtutis, quarum tenet Elpis florida culmen.
Si quan^o offendit gressus, Constantia cursum
Firmans, ad metam laudis c^lcaribus urget*
Proclamat long Spes, hic sunt digna laboris
Praem^a, and excipient mor^aces gaudia curas,
Pax sincera quies nullo temeranda dolor,
Laetit^a hic habitant magnum, sine fine, per aevum.
Sic ubi meandros eme^^ and monstra viarum,
Tandem perti^gunt hil^^es ad culmina montis,
Splend^da quad^atis ubi st^t suffulta col^^nis
Reg^a V^rtut^; porta hinc Crystallina claudi^
Atria Pactoli flavis rutilantia arenis,
Et varijs, quales vix nota dat India, gemmis.
Ante fores livor jacet ater, lumina tanto
Saucius aspectu, dum quam videt, invidet arci:
Hunc simulac pressere duces, per splendida templa
Virtutis, magni subeunt penetralia Honoris.
Gloria mox claris sublimat facta trophaeis,
Famaque Seraphicis insertat nomina turmis.
Hoc bivium est; teritur tamen altera semita, sordet
Altera caeca situ, rara and vestigia monstrat.
Saepe Voluptatem numerosa colonia stipat,
Incomitata solet divina incedere Virtus;
Forte etiam mortale genus, quod nascitur, omne
Errat, and a recto obliquos fert tramite gressus,
Felix ad veram quicunque recurrere metam
Possit, and errori non indulgere nefando.
Transversos ducit caeca ignorantia multos,
Dum carpunt Virtutis iter, mediumque capessunt,
Extremis illabuntur; vix littore solvit
Navis, cum caecis impingit naufraga saxis;
Ast alij meliora vident, cupiuntque, sed obstat
Res angusta, deaeque ira importuna novercae;
Paupertatis onus dirae sic viribus impar
Deprimit, ut longo vix repant intervallo.
Quam pauci juvenum, de tot modo millibus, actu
Extremo functi, scenam cum laud relinquunt!
Parva manus (qualis Gideonis) laud juventae
Clarescit, parvam decimant tamen invida fata.
Incipiunt teneri quum maturescere fructus,
Enecet hos Boreae vis importunae furentis;
Florescens pereat sic tristi funere pubes.
Aequa senum juvenumque simul mors funera densat,
Rugosae quam saepe genae juvenilia busta
Effoetis lacrymis, sicco fletuque rigarunt;
Saepe ilex muscosa recentem turbine fagum
Subversam videt, oppedit tamen ipsa procellae.
Sola homini restat mortalis propria vitae
Conditio, and sortis lex est praescripta caducae.
Vna patet cunctis n^scentis semita vitae,
Mill viae mortis ad fata latentia tendunt.

Non tot multifremum fluctibus Adria
Turget, quum piceis nubibus aequora
Miscet, quot tremulum cor tumet astibus,
Et fervent dubijs pectora motibus.
Irae praecipites, and furor impius
Mesaepe exagitant, exanimant metus,
Tollunt spesque leves, excruciat dolor,
Tranquillum Domine, at da mihi spiritum,
Pelle and cuncta meum quae mala lancinant
Pectus, da placida mente quies^ere.
Aevi primitias sanctifica Deus,
Vtque artus, animam fic mihi robora;
Gressus perque tuam dirige semitam,
Ad Coeli Empyrei quae penetralia
Ducit, C^licolum and stelliferas domos.
Servame incolumem a Tartareo grege,
Sic, metam potero visere ad ultimam.
Tunc Paeana canam pennigeris choris,
Mors c^u^elis ubi jam stimulus tuus;
Inter Christicolos victor ovans greges,
Dicam tunc tumulo gloria ubi est tua.
Mallem per latebras tendere Daedali,
Et vitae o^nigenis ^asibus obijci;
Quam Coeli caream dul^ibus ocijs.
Eu^is praepetibus transvolat ocyor,
Vitae luctificae dira molestia:
Durant astrigeri gaudia sed poli,
N^men dum adnumerat saecula saeculis.
Sementis pervenit ad Messem.

Seed-time is made Harvest.



AVTVMNVS.
September, sive Aetas virilis.
SOL noctes lucesque pa^i quum examine librat,
Et medio Phoebus dispescit tramite mundum,
Naturae tunc grata, suum dant germina semen,
Ipsaque quos habuere, alijs dant foetibus ortus;
Exc^^e ^erra^um rimas, rerumque latebras,
Omnia Naturae species, and semina servant;
Sic v^rio natura jub^t sobo^escere sexu,
In terris quaecunque vigen^, caeloque marique.
Nulla quidem tanto turgescit corpore moles,
Exig^um cujus non dat compendia semen;
Cl^^d^t^r and moles arcto tam limite nulla,
Quae non mult^plici foec^ndet semina prole.
Cum paria Humanam distinguunt tempora vitam
Inque dies retr^, and venturas postea luces:
Tunc sibi cons^rtem vitae, lectique jugalis
Poscit Homo ut speciem servet, sobolemque propag^t.
Quique Homini dixit; vae soli; ad gaud^a vitae,
Huic dedit ^xorem Deus, and sobole scere jussit.
Non pictam Iunonis avem, capramve salacem,
Latracemve canem, vel mimam voce vo^ucrem,
Sed lateris costam conso^tem junxit, ut esset
Ipse sibi, sole sex^s discrimine, conjux.
Hactenus humano generi infestissimus hostis,
Dissimulans Satanas ta^uit, mendacia frauais:
Contigit at p^stquam sequiorem cernere sexum,
Consilij instruxit cuneos, fraudumque phalangas?
Naumachus ut quondam dux, qui versabat Athenas,
Filiolum imperij moderantem induxit habenas:
Optabat quae namque puer, sententia matris
Vna fuit, pueri mox respondere rogatis,
Et mandare viro, regni qui sceptra gerebat,
Sic puero imperium Soritis linea desert:
Haud aliter Satanas, quod vir uxorius esset
Noverat, and faci^em vidit parere maritum,
Agnov^tque ream, divino ex foedere, prolem,
Patraret quaecunque parens and sanguinis author.
Sic ubi mendaci pater, impostorque sophista
Vxorem coeci labyrintho inclusit elenchi,
Blanditiis fuit illa nocens, Sirenis and instar
Allexit miserum, ad fraudem, exitiumque, maritum.
Digna fuit violata fides hoc nomine mulctae,
Credere quum Autori renuit, rerumque parenti,
Conjugium sic tris^e fuit, quod gaudia primu^
Spondebat, jussiq^e vices mutare parents.
O rerum dubios casus! quo vertere sese
Possit nomo? tenet aure lupum, bivioque vacillat.
Coelebs si vivet, moerebit solus and o^bus
Occidet, and veneris n^n dulcia praemia norit;
Audiet ingratus Naturae, habuisse parents,
Nec tamen esse par^ns; ut quondam fama Catonem
Ad Floram venisse res^rt, ut fugerit inde;
Sic coelebs gaudet naturae intrare theatrum,
Exeat ut coelebs; taedas dabit invida parca
Ferales, non dat taedas Cytherea jugales,
Vivit, sed solus vivit, quo? scilicet orbem
Vt videat tantam* vis^mque ut ephemera linquat;
Se capul^ totum tradit, post fata superstes
Nulla part sui est, and vulnere concidit uno;
O^^nia dignus paena, quia semine gentem
Ipse su^m spoliat, crescentique invidet orbi;
Huic humana foret quid si gens amula, Terras
Qui so^erent homines, cole ent quae numina caelos?
Tunc merito Xerxes conscendens culmina monti^
Deploret mortale genus, speciesque caduca^;
Gaudia si qu^ndo contingunt, gaudia sol^
Nescit, and est vita pars di^idiata secunda;
Illi aerumna gravis nimium nec grande levare
Solus possit onus, rebusque est tristibus impar;
Divitias and agros ignotus possidet haeres
Dignior, ipsius fruitur qui mess lahoris:
Quod si forte suam reparet fine semine gentem
Solis avis, renovant sobolem cui incendia thuris,
Phaenicesque hominum quos ardens gloria tollit
Mortalem supra sortem, post funera possint
Et cineres, immortali dare nomina famae;
Pro monstro exemplum est, inter tot millia, quorum
Vita, and fama simul Lethaeis mergitur undis.
Quid faciet, ducet ne? malis obnoxia vita haec
Innumeris, multos dira ad suspendia cogit,
Socraticae haud quemvis tranquilla modestia mentis
Temperat, ut possit Xantippe^ far querelas.
Vita via est, quae nos caelestes ducit ad arces,
Octor est cursus, quum sarcina nulla fatigat;
Mi^itat omnis homo virtutis castrase quutus,
Statque novercantis contra fera spicula sortis.
Quo gravius premit hunc onus, est inidoneus armis
Hoc magis, and vires haerentia pondera frangunt;
Quemque suos Natura jubet sentiscere manes,
Vxoris ducit curas and jurgia conjux,
Curarum quamvis satagat miser ipse suarum,
Alterias manes, proprijs fert manibus impar;
Vxorem si forte virumque examine libres
Aequo, faemineus dependet amaror, amorque
Si formosa juvat, fo^ma est inimica pudori
Non tuto spectata Gygi, nocturnaque regis
Praeda, pudicitiam mulctavit vulnere laesam.
Si dotata, virum mactat, fastuque superbit
Iurgia diraciens, aurataque cornua tollit;
Respuit eloquium morosa Terentia Tulli,
Fulviaque Antoni potuit compescere Suadam;
S^pius uxor, quae debebat nubere, ducit,
Imperitare viro, nonnunquam tollere gaudet
Aut tunica tabo medicata, aut fraud aconiti,
Massagetum de more aliae communia quaerunt
Gaudia, queis lecti reverentia nulla juga^is;
Improba si cessit conjux, est hectica febris,
Mors nisi, nulla tibi tollant medicamina damnum.
Penelope tibi casta placet, mirandaque conjux
Admeti, tuaque o Hieronignara virorum?
Contigit haud cuivis vento petiisse Corinthum?
Nec cunctis cessere, petunt quae gnaviter omnes*
Sort uxor ducenda tibi est, sors candida rara
Exit, nigrarum vomit undam mobilis urna;
Finge probam cecidisse tibi, quae pulchra, pudica,
Et dotata, tamen comis, quae sedula, prudens,
Sobria prole beet, non ull^ and lite fatiget
Aemula Corneliae and claris gravitate Sabinis;
Hanc ubi mors inopina rapit, vel casus iniquus
Destruit, aut fato nati moriuntur acerbo,
Quam gravis (ah) pensat tua pristina gaudia maeror!
Tunc felix esses, nisi felix ante fuisses.
Qualis ab aeria vidu^ gemit arbore turtur,
Et querulo solas funestat murmr sylvas,
Pervolat omne nemus, sociam non invenit ^squam,
Vsque tamen quaetit, solus dum vivere nescit;
Sic tu quem socii fidissima junxit amoris
Copula, tam du^cem nes^is dediscere amorem,
Part carens me liore tui consumere tabo
Ingratus Soli, rapidoque injurius Orco,
Dimidius jam vivis homo; Te insomnia noctis
Forte beant, qu^ties somno obversatur imago
Conjugis, and quondam dulces mentitur amores,
Maerorem sed pulsa quies luctumque recentat,
Planctibus and gemita noctesque diesque fatigas;
Orpheus Eurydice quondam ceu flevit adempta,
Obmutuitque lyra fracta, fidibusque revulsis,
Denuo quum tristes conjux raperetur ad umbras.
O hominis duram sortem, and crudelia fata,
Seu ducas, vivas ceu coelebs, vita dolori
Subjacet, infaust is semper temeranda querelis!
Huccine mortalis pertingunt tempora vitae,
Gaudia nec possunt placidaesentiscere sortis?
Siprimi Autumni tantas dedit hora procellas,
Quas dabit acris hyems, and iniqui ^^deris annus?

Tu magne rerum conditor, imperas
Qui, lege sancta, Patrsbus obsequi,
Honor charos and Parents
Affic^re, ut patria fruamur.
Idem Parents linquere nos finis,
Castos amores conjugis and sequi,
Vt nos propago conjugalis
Exhilarans decoret Parents.
Sed, Christ, qui non omnia deserit,
Nec gaudet orbi qui valedicere
Vt te fruatur, non Jesus
Dignus erit Domino, Deoque.
Sunt queis peractis gaudia n^ptijs;
Et vina dulcis laetitiae fluunt,
Quos non dolores faeculenti,
Non aqueus cruciant amaror.
Mihi si acescunt arida dolia,
Imo manet si pessimum and ultimum,
Mutato Lympharum dolores
Aetherei laticis sapore.
Damihi constans rebus in omnibus
Pectus, secundis ne nimis efferar,
Adversa ne frangant, praemantque
Instabiles maleres timentem.
Quaecunque sors fit conjugii mihi,
Solati^m mentem hoc reficit mea^
Ha^^ posse Christo conjugari
Stelliferi Domino theatri.
Isacidum qui progenuit tribus
Iudae Pater prae Labanidi^ pio
Amore, duram servitutem
Sustinuit vigilis laboris.
Non ego duros pertolerem metus
C^sus iniqui, and cuncta pericula
Amore Christi, qui maritus
Hanc animam faciet heatam.
Qui me redemit faucibus inferi,
Cruore servavit polyporphyro,
Tandemque c^li cum triumpho
Empyreos feret ad penates.
Excubias men's nunc age sedula,
Dum sponsus adventat tuus, instrue
Lucernam oliva, mox Jesus
Ne vocet aetherias choreas,
Quando angelorum millia, millia,
Et celsi Olympi pennigeri greges
Latum Peanem suscit^bunt,
Et tonitru resonabit orbis.
TAke heed when Barnes are full, and wine does flow
Least Scorpius with his sting all overthrow;
Dog-dayes are past, when men were glad to wear
Torn clothes, if you be wise, October fear;
Extremes are dangerous, do not you make bold
From fire, to run out naked in the cold.
In midst of plenty, let us think on want;
If we be healthful let us not therefore vant.
October, sive Aetas media.
CVm jubar incurvis Phoebaeum amplectitur ulnis
Scorpius, and passim flavescit frugibus annus;
Apparent primum tunc tempora grata colonis,
Messis and expectata dies, quam rustica voto
Turba r^d^ divas Cererem petiere palemque.
Falce cadunt fruges, spoliantur foetibus horti,
Oma^ labor pecus fervent, hominesque, bovesque
Solli^itis tonsi ^umant sudoribus agri.
Cum venit blandis sperata parentibus aetas
Et natos videre viros; tunc fervida messis
Humanae vitae est: neque enim condensius agmen
Formicaru^ urget rapidos per rura labores,
Sepedibus quan^o populis frumenta parantur,
Granatim and totisubito minuuntur acervi,
Sedula quam variis studiis ruit unda virorum
Et mund* populantur opes. Quae dissita tellus
Quae regio sub sole jacens, quae Tethyos unda
Quae loca Naturae ^aecis abstrusa tenebris,
Cognita nec Soli, Humani non plena laboris?
H^c queritur quondam dives Gangetica tellus,
Et fluvi^s, posuit Phrygiae quo vota tyrannus
A^rea, Tertessumque fluit quam propter Ibrus,
Et Tagus huic popularis, arenis inclyta quondam
Flumina, nunc vili decurrunt languida musco,
Quasque dab^nt, coguntur opes nunc quaerere ab oris
Non viso quae Sole calent, rapuere Corinthi
Era viri, solam destruxit Mummius urbem,
Heliades siccae lacrymis augere fluenta
Eridani nequeunt, Erythraeo in littore gemmas
Iam frustra scrutatur Arabs, conchylia Sidon
Miratur non ire freto, jam deficit ostrum
Spar^^um, lana frustra celebrantur Amyclae,
Nescit ubi ponat nidos Panchaius ales,
Mascu^a odorif ris quum desint thura Sabaeis;
Synna^a, Sp^rta, Paros Mygdonia nulla columnas
Marmoreas ^actant; citr^as Maurusia mensas
Dedidicit flavis auri circundare lamnis,
Aulae^sque p^^us Babyl^n formosa superbis,
Nulla Sem^ ami^ decoras jam ^ecta tapete,
Daedala nam defecit acus. Tu^^ ersia nullas
Mox jactabis opes; haec ferr^a sit licet aetas,
Ignorant Chalybes ferrum, nec tela ^alonis
Spumiferi flavis extincta gelantur in undis:
Gargara des^ruit messis vix sertilis Enna
Trinacrias nutrit Cer^ali munere Terras,
Non Dodo^ jam glande pluit, non flumina Nili
Lent scatent, gravidisque tumet Methymna racemis,
Rarior est viti^ Ga^ro, ditique Faler^o:
Co^sica non taxos metuit, nec flavus Hymetti
Mella favus sudat; calvescit pinifer Ida:
Non Phoebo Pa^nasse t^o das l^urea serta:
Non taxum Cyrnus, non palmam mittit Idume:
Nec fragrant biferi rubicu^da rosaria Pesti,
Et crocus a Cilicum nunc rarior advenit hortis,
Deseruit ripas Eurotae palladis arbor:
Pontus Castorca, Colchis jam nulla veneno
Clarescit, dudumque gemit quod viderit Argo.
Daedalagens hominum seeds muta^e coegit
Monstra, feras, homines, pisces, variasque volucres.
Bellatoris equi est Epiro gloria nulla,
Euganeas pecudes, Calabr^sque B^itannia vincit
Insula dans niveis spumantia vellera floccis;
Terra Iubae quondam quos pavit vincla leones
Nostra tenent, Dannosque lupos, catulosque Molossos,
Spartanosque canes, and saevos dentibus apros
Marse tuos, and quos frondens dat Maenalus ursos:
Hic afri sua monstra vident* captiva volucrum
Agmina pictarum nostras ducuntur ad oras.
O genus humanum natum indulge^e labori
Audax natu^ae vetitos transcendere fines!
Saeva tridentiferi calcas tu dorsa tyranni
Eluctibus insultans tumidis, Coelique fragores
Vertice sustentans mediis involve^i^ undis,
Vimque offers ventis, and mortis tela fatigas.
Nau fragus (ah) quoties sedisti in cantibus horrens,
Tunc scopuli hospitio felix, cum Pontus and Ether
Nubibus hic saevos, undis daret* ille tumultus,
Aut tabulae insidens fluitasti in gurgite vasto
Ludibrium Coelique, salique, tuosque videres
Circum te nantes post fatum triste sodales,
Incertus number dirafames, an saeva procelloe
Vis d^ret infandi genus (ah) miserabile leti.
Supp^cibus votis tunc Coeli numen adorans
Addebas Lachry^as undis, suspiria ventis;
Optati tamen ut tetigisti Littoris oram,
Neptuno madidas renuis suspendere vestes,
Atque novam meditare ratem sub pondere pictae
Press^s adhuc tabulae; dum vis miser esse libenter
Indocilis tutam cum paupertate quietem
Far domi, ignotis malis confundier undis.
Pars quaerunt Nili fontes, pars ultima Thules
Frigora, and ad gelidam propius quod pertinet axem,
Vna dies totum, nox una ubi dividit annum.
Invenere novas Terras, nec sufficit unus
Orbis, ^o humani generis vesania crevit.
Pars terram fodiunt caecis gens aemula Talpis,
Exosique diem gaudent habitare tenebris
Cimmeriae noctis, Summani Tartara pulsant
Divitiasque a dite petunt; pars ^mula mutis
Gentibus Aequoreas scrutantur saepe latebras
Et scopulos coecos, and arenas gurgitis alti.
O duras hominum sorts! sic vivere parcae
Iusserunt? O crudeles ad numia Parcas!
Naturae placuit pretiosa abscondere rerum
Hum ini pretio tantum acquirenda laboris:
Hyblaeum nectar servant armata juventus
Tauriginae sobolis, nec fit sine vulnere praeda;
Cuspide munitur numerosa gloria Pesti,
Carpuntur Veneris raro sine sanguine Flores;
Discolor in lucem niveo quae vertice surgit
Herba, pici similem radicem in viscera terrae
Mittit, mortalesque beat, sed vellitur aegre.
Et media in sylva fulvo quae virga metallo
Frondescit, tegitur c^cae convallibus umbrae
Ac luco latet omni, aurato vimine ramus;
Qui cupit Hesperidum rutilantia carpere poma,
Custodes domuisse prius sit cura Dracones.
Omnia, quae matter genuit Natura, laborant:
Continua rapitur circum vertigine Caelum
Ignoratque vices oti; Sol surgit ab ortu,
Occiduasque petit ceu cur sor strenuus oras,
Neo minus a capro versus tua brachia Cancer
Scandit, retrogrado repetit vel tramite Caprum:
Ingeminat Phoebe motus, nec cernitur uno
Vultu* Terra vices observat quatuor anni,
Vere novo pictos d^stinguit germine flores,
Hos aestu nutrit, Solisque calore focillat,
Autumno canos foecundat frugibus agros,
Inque hyeme Aeolijs nimborum vapulat austris,
Nulla quies ponto est: subeunt jumenta labores,
Damnatique jugis Tauri; requie fine jussit
Nos etiam Natura dies transire fugaces.
Eia igitur socij per tot mala tadia vitae
Pergite, per duri casus discrimina mill:
Nos alio divina vocat sors; grata sequentur
Ocia; sic olim dura haec meminisse juvabit.

Qua Terra longam circinat orbitam
Solis, polorum qua cadit ambitus
Aut surgit orbi, fraudulenta
Sors homines trahit impotentes.
Quaerunt quod ignis destruat, aut aquae
Aut fur refossis parietibu^ domus
Aut tineae dens vellicantis
Hostis and insidians rapina.
Coelum tenet sed divitias meas
Christum redemptorem pia and agmina
Caelituum qui ter beatas
Hoc duce concelebrant choraeas,
Hic Nectar alto flumine defluit,
Hic stant acervis Ambrosiae poli
Hic gloria and pax, and triumphus
Omnia quae exhilarent ovantes.
Non finient haec gaudia saecula
Non saeculorum saecula, saecula,
Non quotquot erunt and dierum
Quae nebula and tenebris carebunt.
Huc ducito me cuncta per ardua,
Per saxa terrae, per scopulos maris,
Per quicquid Orbi est inquietum
Fulguraper, tonitru, procellas.
Sit modo portus sollicitae viae
Quies Olympi, metaque sit mihi
Seeds coruscans Angelorum,
Et patriae superae penates.
NOw piercing darts descend from heaven above,
We are corslets if your bodies health you love,
For Autumnes latter rain, strikes to the heart,
Oftener than does the flying Parthians dart.
When Sagittarius bends his bow, take heed,
For if you shun't not, he can strike you dead.
O gracious Heaven who can make mortals sad,
And merry; still foretelling good and bad.
November, sive Aetas provectior.
PLeiades Eoo Coeli cum cardine surgunt,
Praecipitemque rapit messem penultimus anni
Imber, and instanti^ praecurrit frigora brumae
Caedua calcatur messis, calet area fruges
Exsiliquat tritura boum; pars munera Bacchi
Temperat, and variis spumantia praela racemis;
Turgida ferventi stant labra undantia musto;
Mella premunt alii, spoliantque examina ceris,
Hyblaeisque favis; stat nectaris amphora plena,
Fervet opus varium, nec messis omnibus una est;
Talis gens humana, quibus non discolor oris
Esse figura potest mage quam sententia mentis;
Diversis diversa placent, studioque trahuntur
Non uno mortale genus, sublimis Olympi
Pars legit amfractus, and Coeli sydera pulsat
Vertice; reptat humi ignavipars maxima vulgi;
Sed pauci virtutis iter, med^umque sequuntur
Gallinae niveae pulli, quos ardor honoris
Accendit very, and rerum prudentia solers.
Ambitio humani generis dirissima pestis
Turget, and Icariis summum petit Aethera pennis
Nobilitat que polum fastu, Terrasque ruina,
Terrigenum Coelos temerans de more Gigantum,
Impiaque in numen Divinum affectat honorem.
Pellaeus juvenis devicto non satur orb,
Nec patre contentus mortali, spurius esse
Maluit illius, nomen qui debet arenis;
Vngula mortalem fecit, Lethesque liquore
Ebrius, angusto tandem sub carcere clausus
Sarcophagi, posuit fastus immensaque vota;
Scilicet attenuat magnos, frangitque superbum
Omne Deus, nullo regnans, rivale secunde.
Commode non clava defendere fata trinodi
Tupoteras, nec te Herculeae sine vulnere tutum
Exuviae dederant, laqueo expirare coactum,
Decollare Deos Poterat, cui castra dederuni
Cognomen caligae, propriumque imponere truncis
Ridiculum caput, ut templi decoretur honor,
O scelus horrendum sale nullo, and thure piandum!
Mortales superi sic regna capessere Coeli,
In victique Iovis componere fulmina sceptris,
Sceptris, quae baculo mutarit casus iniquus,
Et Nemesis divina, Iovis nam dextra Tyrannos
Imperio regit, and graviori regna coercet
Regno; purpuream tribuunt crudelia mortem
Purpureis cur fata viris, nec funera ficca?
Scilicet injusti quia Coeli numina temnunt,
Aemuli and aeolidae mendacia fulmina mitt unt.
Sunt alij fortuna dedit queis provida cunas
Privatas, vetuitque manu contingere sceptrum,
Hos tamen accendit regnandi dira cupido,
Vivere Romulea qui nolunt urbe secundi,
Monstr^ hominum, Terraeque lues, Acherontia proles:
Ergo Deos nequeun^ cum flectere, tota movebunt
Tartara, and infidijs sacrum diadema cruentis,
Fraud, dolisque petent: sed Coeli dextra tuetur
Cognatum imperium, and numen venerabile regis,
Exitij sunt causa sui, inveniuntque ruinam
Quam meruere gravem, and dignas conamine poenas,
Dum scandunt altas Cedros, sub pondere rami,
Franguntur, mittuntque truces ad Tartara fastus:
Turbo velut rapidae erumpens de nube procellae,
Ingeminans motu vires, fervescit eundo,
Crebrius aeriae quatiendo cacumina quercus
Concutitur magis, viresque in robore perdit,
Ambitio vexat sic hos dum dira, feruntur
Impete praecipiti, and perplexo ad culmina rerum,
Mole ^uun^ tandemque sua: conatibus impar
Repperit horendos injusta superbia lapsus.
Quid juvat excelsi conscendere culmen honoris
Invito Jove, percellunt si fulmina montes
Aerios, coeli superant qui vertite nubes?
Tutius est latuisse casae sub cespite vilis,
Aurea quam Regum captare palatia fraud;
Tutius est Clymenes tenues coluisse penates,
Quam phoebi ignitos temere tentare jugales;
Fidere ceratis sum^a estinsania pennis,
Vicino quae Sole fluunt; quid turgida tollis
Vela per horrendas, sinuo figurgitis undas?
Non portus fortuna petit, deprendit in alto
Sed naves, quarum contingunt suppara nubes.
Felix, heu nimium felix fi sort quie scat
Contentum mortale genus, tutissima vita est
Quae didicit servare modum, quae nescia fraudis
Ambitione caret, populi non tollitur aura,
Nec cadit insani levia ad suffragia vulgi,
Non timet haec un^os Sejani and tristia Manli
Funera, qui saxum quo deturbaverat hosts
Caedesua spar sit, dum Romam non capit impar.
Sunt quibus unum opus est loculos distendere, plenas
Condere flavissas, totisque incumbere gazis,
Corradunt quodcunque trahunt torrentibus amnes
Auriseri, quodcunque tenet scrupulosius undae
Littus Erythraeae, qui coeli numina tanquam,
Suspiciunt gazas, quarum quo copia major
Hoc magis ardet opes, and non saturatur egestas,
Semper hiat rimis non auro explebile pectus,
Diti inopes voto sunt, crescit census, habendi
Crescit iniquus amor; quantumque accedit ad aurum,
Sacra fames auri, tantum sub viscere gliscit;
Gentis avaritia humanae dirissima pestis,
Metropolis scelerum, Gento quae dedita Terrae,
Negligis aetherias Divini numinis arces;
Indulges tibi dira lues, ut languor aquosus
A^cendit potando sitim; tu pluribus aucta
Plura petis bona fortunae, quae sordida cura
Acc^mulat, servatque timor, perduntque dolores;
Tefine Coelestem potuissent ducere vitam
Mortales, qualem selicia saecula quondam
Degerunt sub patre Iovi^* quum sors sua quemque
Ditabat sine lege bonum, sine fraud heatum.
Sunt and qui solidas inter convivia luc^s
Consumunt, proceresque gulae Saliaria mensis,
Fercula dant Siculis, capiuntque in viscera sylvas,
Et maria, aeternosque lacus, collesque Falernos,
Invitant Solemn, propinant pocula nocti,
Conti^uantque dapes redivivae ad taedia lucis;
Exercere gulas vallatas gloria summa est:
Dicite quos patinae Aesopi, scutumque Minervae,
Pingue juvat, dubia and cerealis caena saginat,
Dicite, quo sumptus and tot dispendia rerum,
Mollia nervosas ut frangant ocia vires
Et solvat morbi pituita intercutis artus;
Quid de tot dapibus fiet? sentina cloacae
Hoc dicat, totos vertit, quae in ster^ora census.
Ter felix quisquis vitaenephalia servat
Contentus tenui mensa parvoque salillo;
Sobria cui exiguam jucundat calda farinam;
Hic lites nescit, nec magnae est assecla mensae,
Huic satis parca tribuunt quod numina dextra,
Nullo pauper eget, nec enim penuria parvi est;
Hic, sibi far modicum, postquam quae sivit aratro,
Ad fluvium caenat, geneross nectaris instar
Haustus aquae sapit indocto frugique p^lato;
Huic men's sicca, tenax recti, moderata, pudica,
Ipse probus, sceleris purus, sectator honesti,
Integer atque animi fortis, crudusque vigore
Quales pris^a dabat curios casa cesp ie tecta
Pugnaces, tenuique beatos sort Camillos
Fabricios parvo contentos; qualis aratrum
Serranus liquit proprium, fascesque recepit;
Felices animae patriam qui laud bearunt,
Et sibi perpetuum fecere in saecula nomen!
Miles in adversas acies qui fortiter audet
Cernere, and hostilem dextra confundere dextram,
Ense viam sternens and multa caede decorus,
Defendit, qui mart focos and numinis aras;
Sive opus excubiis tenebras defendere noctis,
Metari seu castra, sudum circundare vallo
Agmina, vel duro sylvas succidere serro,
Aut per operta soli medias emergere in urbes,
Aut liquidos remigi fluvios superare natatu,
Proterere haerentem glaciem, calcare paludes,
Arietibus muros, testudine vellere portas;
Pro patria est huic dulce mori, dum vulnera front
Excipit, and primus conscendit maenia, vallum
Perrumpit, cuneo ve animae jam prodigus instat.
Ergo ubi jam victos trahit arcta catena duelles,
Ferratique vi^i currum comitantur, equique,
Bellorum exuviis laeti truncisque trophaeis,
Pugna triumphali legitur quum fortis in arcu,
Instaurantque diem festis convivia pompis;
Cum populi Paeana canunt, and classica diras
Deponunt iras, and Martis gaudia clangunt.
Ipse viro major dux auro insignis and Ostro
Sublimis curru ingreditur, tot millia pascens
Spectantarum* urbis scandit cum laud ruinas;
Supra quo tendat non est; est culmen honoris,
Vnde cadat, graviore ruens in Tartara lapsis,
Sors infida solet laetos foedare triumphos,
Et dubijs nimium volitat victoria pennis:
Lusce tuis turge quantumvis poene trophaeis,
Et Romae terrore trementes concute portas;
Metire in modijs equites, and montis aceto
Frange jugum; simulac fallax fortuna reflarit
Bithynio tunc cogeris servire Tyranno,
Et miseram tacito vitam fixire veneno.
Hectora priamidem cur caesum jactat Achilles
Priamidae Paridis moritur vin lice telo?
Quid juvat incensam vastare Agamemnona Trojam,
Si reduci parat insidias saevissima conjux?
O sors flaxa hominum ma^e pensas magna ruinis
Nec pateris constare diu mortalia; casu
Omnia sed fluxo, and fatorum turbine versas.
Quod si summa rotae teneat fastigia Croesus,
Mox cadit, and radio victor stat Cyrus in alto,
Impatiens donec Tomyris de sede Tyrannum
Excutit, humano gaudens saturare cruore;
Sic ludens noa certa sui fallaxque clienti
Inconstans Fortuna supremis infima mutas.
Felix qui casus sese componit ad omnes,
In duris sperans meltora hic, inque secundis
Deteriora timens, medio sic tramite vitam,
Dirigit, ut nullo noc at Rhamnusia vultu.
Firma velut pelagi rupes im nobilis haeret
Quadrata radice sedens, temnitque procellas
Et concurrentes ad fervida praelia ventos;
Fluctus se illidunt scopulis, fractoque residunt
Impete, and illuso perdunt conamine vires:
Non aliter, quando rerum fremuere tumultus,
Ipse sibi constat sapiens, rideique timores
Insani vulgi, and torquentia fat^ fatigat
Quod si disruptis rueret compagibus orbis
Machina, non trepidum tumularent rudera mundi.

Da Christ vires, da mihi gratiae
Virtute, diras ire per hostium
Turmas, and insanas phalangas
Perfi^iae, invidiae, timoris:
Internus hostis me male sauciat,
Externus hostis vulnere lancinat,
Quocunque me verto, cruentis
Obsideor Satanae catervis.
Tu dux, Deus Tu, Tu Dominus mihi
Arx, salus, rupes, praesidium, decus
Tua sub umbra militabo
Nec metuam rabidos duelles.
Donec fugatis liberor hostibus,
Quum tu potenti numine proteres
Gentes rebels, and superbis
Iniicies manibus catenas.
Quando sonabunt aethere classica
Parebis altis nubibus insidens,
Ad Te vocabis tunc amicos
In patre Coelituum beatos.
Qualis triumphi tunc facies erit
Quando resurget turba fidelium
Stabuntque caetus impiorum
Numinis ad superum tribunal.
Agmen malorum sulphureas domos
Intrabit orci, saecula in omnia
Tormenta passurum Gehennae
Et tenebras Stygii barathri.
Scandent polorum culmina sed pii
Inter coruscas Scraphici gregis
Turmas, and aeterno fruentur
Gloria and imperio, as honor.
Friget.

It Is cold.



HYEMS.
December, sive Senectus.
PRonus ad hirsuti quum Titan cornua capri
Pertigit, australem Coeli relegatus ad aulam;
Incipiunt languere dies, and tristior anni
Apparet vultus, multum mutatus ab illo
Qui primi pictos veris jactabat honores
Lilia purpureis dans intermista roset is;
^lico dimidiae incipiunt decrescere luces
Ducere and exiguos arcus; longissim^ noctis
Tempora dant immortales mortalibus umbras;
Frigoribus venti horrescunt, auraeque pruinis,
Flumina pigritie torpent, and sor^ibus arva,
Nube riget Coelum, lacrymarum gurgite stagnat
Telluris gremium, canescit fluctious aequor
Omniaque inversum contr^stant luctibus annum:
Obrepit sic tarda homini, tristisque senectus
Innumeris comitata malis, obnoxia morbis,
Estque odiosa sibi, nonnunquam digna cicutis,
Et fragiles cani cycnaeis tempora plumis
Cingunt, and nivea crines aspergine tingunt;
S^pe velut Boreae rapidis percuss a procellis
Quercus stat foliis jam despoliata caducis,
Corticeque horrescit scabra, nec frondibus umbr^
Sed trunco reddit: sic nostra malignior aetas
Crine caput spolians, levi ceu pumice calvam
Nudat, and excussis hyemem testuta capillis,
Perdit quos volu^t Proserpina tollere crines.
Nunc eboris quid forma juvat candore coruscans
Purpureoque rosae quondam distincta color,
Lilia ceu rubris fulgent contexta Amaranthis,
Maeotis a^t minio qualis nix certat Hibero,
Nunc abit in rugas macie livente senile^,
Et pallet calido Siri ceu prata vapore
Marcent, solstitij geminat quando hora calores,
Ruganturque genae, dependet pro cute pellis.
Lumina noctivagas quondam superantia stellas
Aemula flammivomis Erythraeo in littore gemmi^,
Oc^ipitis fugiunt caeca, ad penetralia, damni
Sic pudet ipsa sui, tenebrae pro lumine regnant;
Caligant ipsi Soli, senioque fatiscunt.
Spina riget laceri protenso tubere dorsi,
Quaeque humero Pelopis poterant contendere, nutant
Incurvae in pectus scapulae, fitque ossea imago
Corpus, quod p^lchrum sudabat pingue nitorem.
O vecors sine mente Paris! Lacedaemona class
Cur petis, hospitij rupturus foedera sacri?
Cur trahis ad Trojae miseranda incendia Graecas
Non nisi post patriae redituras funera classes?
Scilicet Argivae flagrat tibi pectus amore
Tyndaridis, fragilisque juvat te gloria formae?
Aspice sed rugas Hecubae, ma^ie^que, situmque,
Ossa tumore macro crescentia, sumina lemis;
Aspice and illius formae dispendia, quondam
Quae Priamo dulces juvent dedit una calores:
Tyndaris illa tuae nunc unica gaudia mentis,
Post fatum crudele tuum, post fata parentum,
Cognatasque neces, incendia, furta, rapinas,
Tandem rugosas scalpet ceu simia buc^as,
Dissimilisque sui ad speculi simula^ra dolebit.
Quid vires, roburque juvant, quae effoeta senectus
Frangit, and enerv^ labefactat pondere molis?
Sacra Iovi quercus* postquam duo saecla peregit
Crescens, consistensque aetas, ubi tertia venit
Fatalisque aevi series, radice vacillat
Exesa* nutatque auris bacchantibus impar;
Ipse Atlas, humeris qui coelum and sydera fulsi^,
Annorum spatio confectus supposuit, quem
Noxin se rediens genuit, dum furta ^onantis
Opt^to pulchrae Alemenes satiantur amore;
Qui diduit portare bovem, totique theatro
Ostentare suas populi ad spectacula vires,
Iam s^ni^ gravis, and longaevis debilis annis,
Se minor effoetos vidit pendere l^certos,
Ing^muitque, animo non respondere vietos
Cer^ui* and in terram proni jam corporis artus;
Vt Leo sylvarum quondam formido, senectae
Ignavae fractus morb^, vix languida post se
Membra trabens, impune videt per pascua tauros
Infirm^sque errare greges, fame sa^cius aegra,
Sed se^io tardus flaccenti debilis alce
Vndique quam spectat, nescit deprendere praedam;
Sic miles quercus quondam decoratus honor,
De victo duxit qui s^pius host triumpho^
(Qualis ponte fletit Cocles, qualisque Quirinus
Rettulit Acronem Iovis ad delubra Feretri,
Quique ducem potuere sequi Marcellus, and acer
Cossus, victores, and opimi gloria Martis)
Iam rude donatus suspensis defidet armis;
Classica turmarum rauco quum murmr clangunt,
Tympa^aque ingeminant pulsus, hinnitus equorum
Quum fremit, exurgitque minax ad s^dera clamor,
Hic sedet immotus, nulloque cientur ab ^re
Pectora ^agnanimos quae dididicere calores.
Navita, Pygmaeos legit qui class penates,
Post coeli, Pontique hyemes, in tuta recedit
Ocia, quum laxis tremuli compagibus artus
Insanos nequeunt pelagi tolerare labores,
Neptuno piceas gaudet suspendere vestes;
Dimida ut navis rimis atque imbre dehiscens
In sicco laceras resupinat littore costas
Iam dudum pertaesa maris; sic tardus and aeger
Nauta domi recubat, terrae ut committere possit
Relliquias mari^, ac ingratae taedia vitae.
Dulce fuit quodcunque prius defluxit, in imo,
Vltima sola manet sex, and deterrima fundo.
Poscitis O miseri seros cur Nestoris annos
Alterna numerare manu, contendere cervo
Vivaci, and vet^lae corri is ducere vitam?
Nulla dies moerore vacat, nec luctibus hora
Vlla car^t, trescit cumque anxietatibus aetas.
Longius ia fluctus si quossa carina profundos
Egreditur, diris d^bet ludioria ventis
Hoc magis, and timor est, rep^tat n^n aufraga littus,
Troite tu felix impubes fortiter annos
Finisti, scro cui non temerata dolor est
Imbe^is, tristisque aetas: si fata dedissent
Hanc infelici l'riamo cum conjuge mortem,
Non tot vidisset natorum funera, raptas
Crinibus I^adas laceris, nec Pergama flammis
Diruta, non rivo maculasset sanguinis aras.
Quid non longaevi la be factat temporis aetas?
Pyramides cedunt annis, and Mausolaea,
Destruxit Rhodium curiosa senecta Colossum;
Longa dies minuit vires, fortisque vigorem
Corporis exilem citius perducit ad umbram.
Forma perit; census non aegro in corpore sensus
Instaurat; pereunt Naturae and munera sortis;
Virtus sola manet, studio quam prima juventus
Quaesivit, tristem consolaturque senectam;
Haec praestat miseris jucunda viatica canis,
Vt scin^illantes Titanis lumina stellas
Obscurant; virtus tristes sic mole dolores
Opprimis, insanas non passa exire querelas;
Ipsa sibi merces pulcherrima, dignaque votis
Sola pijs, casu tranquillos reddit in omni.
Dira Syracusias quum flamma incenderet arces,
Marcellique manus densarent undique caedes,
Inter tot fremitus, strepitus, lamenta ruinas,
Inter tot gemitus, planctus, querulosque dolores,
Coeli docte senex animo studiisque vacabas,
Alcyon veluti medijs securus in undis,
Vix hostile tuo sensisti in pectore ferrum.
O animi dulcis requies, o sola voluptas
Virtus! Tu tollis humanae incommoda vitae,
Damna senectutis minu is, mulcesque dolores,
Laetitiam, quamvis miseris, mortalibus adfers.

Horrida cycnaei vallant mihi tempora cani,
Testanturque hyemis tempus adesse nives.
Luxque maligna meas obfuscat nube fenestras,
Attritu dentes consenuere molae.
Corporis and fractae incipiunt nutare columnae,
Ac labat infirma mole caduca domus.
I am tristes adfert morbos curiosa Senectus,
Debilis enervat languida membra stupor.
Quicquid dulce fuit perijt; mihi gaudia vitae
Si qua fuere meae, jam me minisse grave est.
Moestaque pallentes Lethes men's somniat umbras
Occursatque oculis mortis imago meis.
Impia dum recolo lascivae facta juventae,
Concidit ad gemitus moesta senecta graves.
Picta velut nubes juvenilis gloria fugit;
Iris uti, in lacrymas vita soluta fluir.
O clemens ignosce pater, damnumque senectae
Salvifica reparet gratia sancta fide.
Spiritus Aetherios instauret pectore sensus,
Vt solum sapiat men's animusque polum.
Detque mihi noxae tecmeria certa remissae,
Cedas and aeterni f^deris arrha mihi:
Sic ego Coelestis patriae oblectabor amore,
Hoc mihi lenimen dulce doloris erit.
Sic cupiam grata dissolvi morte, parentem
Christ, tuum ut possim cernere, Christ, meum.
Empyreas aeterna tuas ubi pax colit arces,
Gaudiaque in nullos interitura dies.
Spectabitque fides, quae credidit, and potietur
Spes voto, Caeli regna tenebit amor.
I Am Aquarius, now is my turn,
To throw forth balefull floods out of mine urne;
Spring where is thy dress? Summer thy fragrant flowers?
Autumn thy pleasant fruits? lo here is my showers.
What ever pleasure in the world was found,
By this my fatal deluge now is drowned.
When men a Noah so long preaching hear,
Let every one take heed and stand in fear.
Ianuarius sive Mors.
TRistis ubi inve sam profundit aquarius urnam,
Jupiter and gelido de scendit plurimus imbre,
Ac nebulis urget mundum, brumamque flagellat
Stridula tempestas, and Caeli grando sonora;
Omnia tunc refugo in terram stant marcida succo,
Exanimata g^la moriuntur semina vitae,
Si qua manent, imae tumulantur viscere terrae;
Mole gemunt nivium saltus, lacerisque rigescit
Ramis, and rupto macrescit cortice sylva;
Stant and aquae pa^sim glacia^i compede vinctae,
Immenso sque lacus capuli crystallina condit
Arca, natant vivi torpenti i^ flumine pisces;
Terra sepulta jacet nivibus, torpedine tacti
Frigoris, exangues perdunt sua gramina campi:
Aetatis desaevit hyems, quum incurva vacillat
Vixque effoeta levi sustentat membra bacill^.
Se minor est homo majus onus, quum cernuus aegrum
Obstipat caput in silices, capularis ad orcum
Festinat pedibus trinis, sed gressihus impar
Inque potens ruit in praeceps, inopina Charontis
Ad ferrug^eam dum fertur fa^cina cymbam.
Nascendt le^certa, via est mortalibus una
In lucem, sed mill patent ad funera portae.
Parcae molle secant prim^ lanugine stam^n,
Et quod rugosa carry, canisque rigescit;
Persophonae a fugit n^llum, non Proteus ora
Tot poterat mutare, vices variare quot illa;
Saevior in quosdam tormenta excogitat, arma
Carnificis, clavos, uncos, cuneosque trabales;
M^tior est aliis, sensi^nque in corpore vires
Et sibras minuit, frangitque atate cic^das.
Innumeros fati casus, discrimina mi^le
Morhorum, and diras febrium numerare cohortes
Quis valeat? non tot volitant sub sydere claro
Corpora quae fallunt oculos sine lumine Solis,
Quot mala versutae comitantur stamina parcae;
Quilibet unius fruitur qui munere vitae
Mill modis pereat; tot non arteria motus,
Febriculosa ciet, quot mors dare vulnera possit;
Sive placet macie gracilenti corporis artus,
Liqui, cera fluit lentis ceu saucia flammis,
Seu calor exurit, mergit seu nimius humor
Et rumpunt elementa fidem; seu dira synanche
Et tonsillarum vis flammea fauce tumescunt;
Seu capitis dolor affligit, cephalaeaque rumpens
Tempora, quaeque oculos tendit catalepsis hiante^;
Sive veternosi tabes lethargica somni
Enervat, saltusque rotans vertigine corpus,
Et morbus rigidos convellens spasmate nervos;
Sive cutem scabris maculis elephantia pingit,
Seu nitet haec multum distenta intercute lympha;
Seu phagedena nocet, sive orthopnaea meatum
Non facilem pr^bet vitalis follibus aurae,
Seu papulis turgens ^oa: Mors est gnara nocendi
Mill arts docta, and fraudum studiosa novarum*
Sed gravior nullus quam Caeli morbus, and aethrae
Exitiosa lues, populatrix unica mundi;
Flumina Lethaeis quum currunt languida lymphis,
Et gravidae letho n^^es fatale venenum
Diffundunt, patulique meat mors faucibus oris;
Nectareo prorore greges aconita trilinguis
Dira ferae lambunt, stant lurida pabula tabo;
Inque homines saevire solet crudelius (eheu)
Vidimus, and tanti fuimus pars magna doloris;
Quum saepe and subito Angligenas grassata per oras
Noluit haec populum decimare; sed undique totos
Vrbibus exhaustos leto vastare penates.
Londinum quoties Tamisinas fletibus undas
Auxisti, dicant, quos vix dum cymba Charontis
Transmisit, manesque tui, quos vix capit Orcus?
Morte gravi gravior pestis, teterrima lethi
Est facies; pigris sordent languoribus artus,
Lumina stant flammis, exardent ora rubore,
Corporis inque arcem scandit vaporigneus, artus
Pascitur, and crescit flammis torrentibus herpes;
Inde stupore rigent oculi, de naribus at er
Sanguinis it rivus, reson^nt tinaitibus aures,
Ilia singultu tenduntur, surgit ab alto
Spiritus, arcano gemitu, gravis; aspera clausas
Lingua premit fauces, fitis insatiabilis urget,
Amplexuque crebro torpentia sana fatigant,
Et gelidos poscunt fontes, custode remoto;
Liventes papulae dant sparso in corpore naevos,
Et maculae narrant disrumpi stamina vitae.
Huic genus omne mali cedit mortalibus agris
Quod Pandora dedit; vis morbi haud tristior ulla est.
Non tantum nocuit gravis amphisbaena veneno,
Non tantum ammodites flavis agnatus arenis,
Vipera, nec scytale vario quae tergore fallit,
Non salamandra gravis, sitiensque in flumine dipsas,
Non seps tabificus, non tristi Scorpio cauda,
Frigidus aut Bufo, non sulcans arva pareas,
Non aspis, diroque necas qui regule visis.
O supert! procul a nostris haec exulet oris;
Vt liceat patribus natorum claudere ocellos,
Et natis geli^as animas baurire parentum.
Aequora qu^t vasto mergunt in gurgite, Martis
Quot furor exitio dedit, and vesanacupido,
Et malesanus amor, visque implacabilis irae?
O fragilis vita, o incerta, o fluxa, caduca,
Innumeris obsessumalis, impar tamen uni!
Siccine ventorum concurrunt agmina, bullam
Vt frangant Coelique, solique, solique furores
Ergo anima hospitio quum corporis exulat, arces
Empyreas repetit, patriumque invisit Olympum,
Felix post tantos vitaeque viaeque labores,
Optatos Coe^ipoterit quae intrarepenates,
Aeternaque frui requie, clarisque triumphis:
Felixincertae post tot discremina sortis,
Contigit Aetherio cui jam requiescere portu:
Interea corpus varij ludibria casus,
Praeda jacet crudae sylvae, aut sublime putrescent
Dat corvis, coeloque dapes; quot gurgite vasto
Corpora dant avidis inopinam piscibus escum?
Pauca suae matris redeunt in viscera terrae,
Imponuntque rogis cla^atu cadavera, paucos
Praefica deflet anus, lugubris vel naenia pompae,
Queis ante ora patrum, natorum, uxoris, amici,
Contigit oppetere, and capulo mutare pen^tes.
Sic animae postquam discessus solverit artus
In luti deforme Chaos: non frigidiora
Membra jacent, quam friget amor lugentis amici,
Vxorisque novos meditan^is tunc hymenaos.
Sollicitat luctum, pulisque nitoribus haeres
Gaudia personat, dum toto laetior ass
Naturam beat and parcas, quod cana parentis
Funera solentur loculi, solentur and arcae,
Lenius and plena suspiret planctus in a^la.
Sic ubi, quicunque est haeres (haec sunt mea) dixit.
Defunctus proprios jussus mutare penates
Effertur, foribus quia non pedes ocyus exit:
Agmina amicorum stipant ex ordine longo,
Arma viri claris portant spectanda trophaeis,
Moestitiam que tub^ fingu^t, pullatuque turb^^

Sed posiquam ventum est ad tetra palatia mortis,
Ingluviemque Orci, and putres telluris hiatus
Iniiciunt nudum capulum: deque agmine tanto

Discedunt omnes, solus jacet ille sepulchro,

QValis Pestanae pubes Alabandica florae,
Qualis and arboreae gloria prima comae,
Quale de^us florum verno sub tempore ridet,
Quale nitet primo mane serena dies,
Quale jubar rutilans, qualisque evanida nubes,
Qualis Amathidae roscida scena fuit,
Talis homo, cujus fatalia stamina vitae
Net simul, and diro pollice parca secat:
Spina rosae superest, funduntur ab arbore flores
Herba perit, parvo tempore mane f^git,
Occiduum jubar est, nubis praetervolat umbr^,
Scena repent cadit, vita caduca perit.
Qualia stant teneris nascentia gramina campis,
Qualis and in vanum fabula c^pta jocum,
Qualis avis sylvae nullae quae sede moratur,
Qualis and in pratis pendula roris onyx,
Qualis and est horae, spithamae dimensio qualis,
Quale solet carmen fundere tristis olor:
Talis homo, cujus non certo obnoxia fato
Tempora, and I^iacis accumulata malis:
Gramina flaccescunt, properum dat fabula finem,
Avolat hinc volucris, ros and in alta micat,
Hora brevis, spithamae non est dimensio longa,
Vt moriturus olor, sic moriturus homo.
Qualis bulla natat tremuli prurigine rivi,
Qualis and in speculo levi^ ^ago nitet,
Qualis Arachnaeam telam percurrit arundo,
Qualis arenoso littera scripta solo.
Qualis and est nictu^ mentis, vel fictile somni,
Quale fluit murmur desilientis aquae;
Talis homo duri^ de^ens ludibria parcis.
Errat and instabiles itque reditque vices;
Bulla crepat, levis speculi disparet imago,
Torquetur pecten, caeca litura perit,
Excidit ex animo sensus, de lumine somnu^,
Et tanquam rivi murmr vita fluit.
Quales decurrunt fluvij torrentibus undis,
Qualis and a Parthi missa s^gitta manu,
Qualis equi cursus, superat qualis pila metam;
Qualis and e diti sportula missa domo,
Quales non certo cursu stant aequoris ^stus,
Qualis Arachnaei pendula tela laris:
Talis homo vitae medijs jactatus in undis,
Nulla cui mentis gaudia, nulla quies;
Missile abit telum, reduces sunt aequoris aestus,
Null^ mora est curs^^, ruptaque tela cadit,
Emicat ad metam pila, mox est sportula nulla,
Sic repetens manes est modo nullus homo.
Quale coruscanti descendit ab Aethere fulgur,
Angarus ad Dominum quale c^pessit iter
Quales sunt cantus pausae numerique minores,
Aut via per tridui continuata moras,
Liquitur aestivo qualis nix saucia sole,
Quale pyrum praecox, qualia pruna cadunt:
Tali^ and accumulat fatali lege dolores,
Et subit hanc lucem cras moriturus homo;
Vanescit fulgur, festinat nuncius, omnem
Paus^ rapit cantus, and via parva moram,
Et pyraputrescunt, funduntur pruna, liquescit
Nix, tandem quicquid vixit in orb, perit.
Resurrectio.
QValia frugiferis concredita semina sulcis,
Quale a Marthiden ceperat urna putris,
Qualis mortifero Tabitha oppressa sopore,
Qualis, qui ceti viva saburra fuit,
Qualia lucifugae scintillant sydera noctis,
Et condunt vultus adveniente die.
Talis and Humanae condit mors lumina vitae;
Morte tamen victa fit redivivus Homo.
Semina viviscunt, Marthides surgit ab urna,
Fit Tabitha vigil, bellua reddit onus,
Nox fugit, and stellae; subeunt mox gaudia lucis,
Atque Homo post fatum triste superstes ovat.
MEn, beasts and birds, mountains, and castles hye
Like fishes in oblivion drowned lie;
The seas and floods prevail, and all is gone,
Deucalion and Pyrra, are left alone;
The fair, the pleasant, fruitful year is past,
And Consummatum now has com'd at last.
As in the seas, the life, there fishes have,
So shall we take our being from the grave.

SPRING.
March, or Man's birth.
THis Sphere redoubling Fabric wheeling round.
Which big with beings does with shapes abound,
Before the Heavens did move, and Earth was stable,
Before the boundless Waves were Navigable,
It was a Chaos and confused mass,
Wherein the jarring seeds of all things was;
Such is the birth of Man, who does comprise
The greater Fabric in a lesser sise:
Before Heavens sacred spark, whereby he lives
His vegetation, sense and reason gives,
To Elements before places be assigned,
And qualities to Organes are confined,
Before Jove's Image from the starrie light
Does claim his race, and look with face upright,
What is he at first but seed, whereof we see
The basest vermin take their pedigree;
Yet God the great Creator of all things
This vileness to a glorious creature brings.
Like as the Grain does in earths fruitful womb,
As it were dead, it self in dust entombe,
Yet by earths virtue and his seeding power
Preserve it self safe from the winters stoure;
Until like Phryxus, Phoebus ride upon
The Ram, and more conspicuous in his Throne,
With geniall heat, and life-begetting ray
He twist it forth and make it see the day.
So man in womb an Embryon does lie,
Curded like milk, and wrought miraculously,
Clothed like seed with husks, wrapped up in bags,
Which are its native homespun swaddling rags.
Then God Almighty, who life to all things gives,
Breaths in that Divine soul, whereby it lives.
Here is a marriage made; to dust and clay
The Heaven is wedded, still with it to stay;
Here immortality, by Gods command,
Poor frail mortality takes by the hand;
O what a pity, that the Virgin soul
Should have a mate so leprous and so foul!
Its well in darkness they the match do make,
For if it saw, the body it would forsake.
O if it could then speak, what would it say,
That it has come from Heaven, to dwell in clay?
Or that like Jonas, from the Sapphire veil
Its fallen into the belly of a Whale?
The lodging they have got is dark as hell,
But if not there, they know not where to dwell;
So often we see them tumbling to and fro,
They show themselves content, but so and so:
Yea many times the soul so loathes this Inn,
It leaves it, when it scarce has entered in;
And often the bowels do become a grave
For their own brood, to which they lodging gave.
But take the best, and you your self will bliss,
To see in birth what misery there is;
Clamorous convulsions, painful throws, and cries,
Sharp shows strayning the back, weakening the thighs,
Much like an Earthquakes shaking you may see,
Betwixt them such intestine wars there be.
O does the child then know, what is this life,
Who will not enter it without such strife?
Yea often the one so fights against the other,
That Viper like the child does kill the mother.
May you not think, the soul defild with sin
Original, does to regrate begin,
And wish it may not see this life at all,
Least it should add thereto sin actual,
And once perhaps, should with the wicked say,
O if it never had seen light of day.
But mark, when he is borne, how he will give
An Emblem of the life, which he must live;
Telling as't were, when he his hand puts forth,
That he must work for what he shall be worth;
Or thrusting down his naked foot he says,
That he must walk a Pilgrim all his days.
How e're he comes, he naked poor does lie
And can do nothing silly babe but cry;
He cannot speak, but yawle for grief, and so
His rude expression cries (wa) for (woe)
So Thracian-like into this world of fears
He ushereth himself with many tears.
These pains of birth and woeful agony
Foretokneth our ensuing misery;
They clearly do point forth the curse of man,
That he must live in sorrow, as he began:
His nakedness shows he must nothing have
Which with him he may carry to his grave.

Since then my birth is of my bane
The primer, me be get again,
Renew my spirit Lord, so with Thee
I shall thy fathers dwellings see.
His second birth is brought with fears.
A broken heart, and floods of tears,
Roaring, chatt'ring in the night,
Like Pelican from mortals sight.
Heart-consuming sighs and cries,
Soule-quelling fits and agonies,
Thought-killing muttring, when the heart
Knows no ways how to play its part.
But moment-lasting sorrow is
Forerunner to eternal bliss,
If here on earth it does annoy,
Yet leads it us to Heavens joy.
When we shall with tearelesse eyes,
Meet our Savior in the skies,
When we with him coheires shall be
Of glory and immortality.
Then shall our tears be wiped away,
Then shall there be no night, but day;
Then for our mourning we shall sing,
A Halelujah to Heavens King.
Ecce novum gaudium.

Behold new joy.



April, or Man's Infancy.
AS Aprils soft and balmy showers do nourish
The March-bred Buds, until they come to flourish;
Sun with its hear, Heaven with its dew them cherish,
Lest they with nipping cold, or drought should perish*
Even so the infant on his mothers knee,
Lest he should starve for want or penury,
With milky Nectar he his belly fills
Which flows from the two breast-towring hills,
Often times Stepmother nature, Mothers pride
Does stop those sources, which when they are dried,
What they cannot obtain from cruel mothers,
Poor Infants! they are forced to beg from others:
Sometime the parents so unnatural prove,
That they expose, which they sold dearest love;
Then beasts and birds, against their nature, show
More love then parents, who this duty owe:
Did not the Woolfe her fierceness lay aside,
To give what cursed Amulius denied;
Romes twins so nursed with Woolfes unkindly food,
Like ravenous beasts, one shed the others blood.
A Bitch did nurse great Cyrus, when they did
Expose him, cause his surly Grandsire bid,
From that time forth in jarres his life he led,
Seeking for prey, and thirsting blood to shed,
Until by Schythian Tomyris at last,
His head into a bag of blood was cast.
What is the cause, why children often times are
Unkind unto their parents? cause they were
Weaned from others; and it stands with reason,
That they should smell of, what first did them season.
But when the babe has sucked, then must it go
To Cradle, there to cry rockt too and fro.
(A pregnant Emblem of his life that follows,
Where like a bark, he is tossed among the billows
Of hope and fear, nor rests till cruel fates
Do thrust him into Proserpines black gates)
But lest with crying he should be oppressed,
Humming Enchantments lull him to his rest.
If any life be innocent at all,
The filly Infants life such may you call;
Yet to how great and various miseries,
Good God! the harmless Infant subject lies;
Nay, if an Herod show his cruelty,
These guiltless children every one must die.
Greece talks of Midas Wealth* presaging Ants,
Of Platoes Beehiv'd eloquence she vaunts,
And Cradle-luck sent from the God; but I
Can see nothing foremeant in Infancy,
Besides great sorrow, trouble, care, and toil,
And whatsoever can true pleasure spoil.
Yet there is one comfort, children do not know
Their misery, which lessneth much their woe.

With Nurses milk I have drunk in
The deadly guilt of parents sin;
So am I, as my parent was
Infected with Adams trespass.
But (ah) that is the meanest share
Considering what mine actual are;
I have my years in sinning past,
Nor can I leave them now at last.
O make me (Lord) in grace begin
To live before I end in sin;
Thine Infant (Lord) to be I crave,
Let not my gray hairs sin to grave.
My soul does cry* still thou it Lord
With milk of thy eternal Word;
Author of grace, nurse grace in me,
So I at length shall strengthened be.
Cleanse me from first and second guilt*
Only thou can (Lord) if thou will;
Then shall I be a Denninzon
There, where uncleanness comes none.
Let not Hells Siren lull asleep
My soul to drown it in the deep;
Lord make it watch for Heavens joys
Regarding nothing worldly toys.
Behold my soul rock't too and fro,
Does cry for fear and cannot go;
Now least in storm it drowned be,
Take it into the ship with Thee.
So shall Thou think me to be thine,
And I shall think thy kingdom mine;
So shall my soul thy mercies prove
And learn thy mercies how to love.
Florescunt*

They flourish.



May or Man's Childhood.
WHen May, Springs-glory paints the gaudy fields,
And beauty to Aprils sucking infants yields,
The bloomes and blossoms are so strangely died,
That Nature seems her cunning to have tried.
Flora perfumes her brood, which give a smell,
That may the Phoenix nest well parallel,
The plumed minstrels with their Music fills
The smiling heaven, the wood, and ecchoing hills.
Man's Childhood is his May, wherein he plays,
And wantonly beguiles his careless days:
Then looks he like an Angel, had he wings,
He is the prettiest amongst a thousand things.
What Snow-white Lilly, can Flora afford so fair,
Which with his spotless beauty may compare?
Pestans twice-bearing rose-beds, blush to see
His Virgins red-enamelled modesty;
His fragrant breath so from his breast does smell,
As if Arabia's bird did therein dwell;
Nor fancied nosegay, nor composed perfume,
Above his simple nature dare presume.
Many repair to Groves and love to hear
The Nightingale, the Thrush, and plumed quire,
If I should choose, I could take greater joy
To hear the prattling of a lovely boy.
His eyes like glistring Diamonds do shine,
Twinkling like Lizards, while they stare on thine.
But mark what pleasant sport to himself he makes,
All Arts and Trades he boldly undertakes;
He Will raise a Castle, build a sandy Mill,
He Will ride a horse, he will train, he is what you will;
He does what ever unripe Nature can,
He is the pleasant, pretty ape of man:
His wit like wax to every thing can ply,
A strange observer, what he sees he will try.
But hark you Parents, be not over joy'd,
Your pleasure (ah) may quickly be destroyed.
You see the Damask Rose which is the peer
Of flowers, it fades and leaves the naked brier:
No blossom is so glorious and so fair,
But may be nipped with a noisome air,
If an encountering blast of sickness blow,
All feature passes like a minutes show,
He droopes his head, his ghastly looks condemn
The fondness of child-deifying men,
Then through his eyes as windows looks death,
A loathsome earthly smell infects his breath.
His merry tales and chat, is then forgot,
For painful sickness makes him change his note.
Then look how great your joy exc^ll'd before,
Your grief is doubled now, if it be not more.
Here was a Sunshine blinke, before the clouds
Did send the winds to combat with the floods;
Here was a calm above, while as below
The sea was great with storm, winds threatened to blow,
Ah world of woe! what thing can thou call thine,
Poor man, but death can quickly say its mine?
.
Grant strength of grace, O Lord, to me,
And make me grow from infancy
To childhood; teach me how to trace
The footesteps of thy saying grace.
While with unequal paces I,
Do lag, show forth thy Light from high;
O do not go quite out of sight
Lord Souls Redeemer, sole delight.
Look to my wadling pace and if
^ fall, raise me, and comfort give
Lord, when I stagger, set me right,
O Souls eternal anchor plight.
And that I may the way endure,
With thy free graces me allure,
Lord if I faint encourage me;
But pull me if I stubborn be.
Thus suffer me not, Lord* to stray,
But guide me on the narrow way;
And 'cause thy Kingdom does belong
To Children, place me them among:
Then Heavens bright Angel shall I be
Clothed with immortality,
Rather such Childhood to me give,
Then here Methushalems age to live.

I shall go backward.



SVMMER.
June, or Man's young age.
IN June when Phoebus up to Cancer hies,
Driving aloft his Chariot in the skies,
The Earth is cherisht with a warmer ray,
Her Youthful brood lusty appear and gay;
Then promise they some fruit and give essays,
Of what shall be their further-ripening days:
Such is the strip^ing halfe-growne age of man,
When fiery seed of reason sparkle can,
When his rude wit^ but waxen (as the Bear
Fashions her cub) is lickt and framed with care.
Since man's great Sir^ did from his maker fall,
Man's reason's lost, scarce to be found at all;
Much like a gemme in Lethes darkness drowned,
With dangerous painful dyving to be found.
There was a time, when man Gods offspring stood
Endued with gifts greater then mortal good;
But whilst he ruled his reins, his will did stray,
With drawing him out of the righter way:
Thus when corrupt was the stock and tree,
We branches thereof must corrupted be;
Borne void of knowledge, rude and ignorant,
The meanest character of good we want,
Like to a smooth and waxed writing table,
Its void, but write you, to receive its able.
A tree which crooked grows and bends awry,
While it is young, skill can it rectify;
So tender minds the Masters care corrects,
What Nature could not, Discipline effects;
Learning makes straight perverse and crooked wits,
And them like wax to any fashion fits.
He whom Apollo's Oracle did call,
The wisest amongst the Gr^acian Sophies all,
Condemned, by a critic of man's face,
As dull and stupid, void of wit and grace,
Made answer, such himself by birth to be,
But bettered by Divine Philosophy.
A lavish Father, when his state he spoils,
He puts his children to a thousand toils;
Good God! what pains and care it does us cost,
To seek and not to find what Adam lost.
Language was Natures work, we should be borne
Thereto, without fescue, or book of horn.
But as to gather Sibyls leaves dispersed
Is desperate work to find what she rehearsed;
To gather letter by letter, so we are feign
Syllabe by syllabe, word by word in vain.
Our frail and britle memory before
Did safely keep the whole conceptions store;
A faithful Steward, what she kept, she could
Distribute that, when use and season would;
But now who to his memory does trust,
He writes the charter of his mind in dust.
Now wandering, brainesicke thoughts the speces kill,
And what they spare, old age abolish will.
Often so a mass of things is hurld together,
That Chaos-like, one parts not from another;
When men now search their brains, they cannot find
The box, which holds the conceit of their mind:
They fret, much like to dull Apothecaries
Who cannot hit upon their box and wares.
Hence memories distrust makes us to write
Our minds in papers, that they may endite
Again to us, so word of mouth is come
To silence of our writings, which are dumb,
And what was got before b' attentive ear
Dumb books do teach us, 'cause they are oculare.
Nor is this all, often times the Schollar's so
Untoward, without rod he will not go;
Sometimes, cause nothing in his left side sturres,
He Will neither ride with rod, nor yet with spurs
O what ado is here for to supply
That which we lost, but cannot now come by*
Tell sons of Adam, what you think of one
Poor apple, which, has mankind thus undone.

O Lord, who in this age was preaching found,
And teaching those who did the law expound,
Teach me, my Savior, what is thy Fathers will,
And grant me grace that I may it fulfill.
I am by nature, and in grace a moule,
Redeemer touch mine eyes, illighten my Soul.
I am not Lord by Parents sin so spilt,
Nor so desil'd with mine own actual guilt;
But if thou will, thou can by thy free grace,
Cleanse me from all which does my Soul deface;
What ever gifts Adam has lost to me,
Those and far greater, Lord, I find by Thee.
Master, make me thy Scholar; when I shall
Correction crave, use mercy there withal;
Master, thy Scholar humbly begs of thee,
That to my strength thy rod may tempered be.
Concurrunt sidera Coeli.

The Stars agree in one.



July, or Striplings age.
When rypening July brings Hyperion forth,
From Tethys chambers lying toward North,
The fruitful tree, advances more and more
His fruit, desiring still his kind to store:
So Man when his Youths blossoms gin to blow,
Desires some way wits timely fruits to show.
After these wits, which imperfect were wrought,
Are now by licking into fashion brought;
Then every man betakes him to a trade,
For no man e're for idleness was made.
Like as the Bees the meddowes range about,
Tasting of every flower the field throughout;
Some brotch the Primrose nectar some the Lillies,
Some crop the Thyme, and some the Daffodillies;
Each one a sundry way and flower does take,
And yet all to one Hive do honey make:
So men, in Youth, according to their minds,
Do choose their trades, of sundry diverse kinds;
For Esops skuls did not so disagree,
As men in several phansies different be:
Yet though there is amongst men so great division,
All seek one thing, this mortal life's provision.
How many sorts of things, how many joints
Are of the body, how many crotchet points
Are of the mind, or senses fond delights,
How many vices are in wicked wightes;
For goods, for evils, the're equal arts in number,
Which like an Hydra does this life encumber.
Fathers of old time, surely, craved no more,
But clothes for back and for the belly store;
Now pride and ryots humors for to fit,
Whole countries, nations, do employ their wit;
A thousand trades, now, do the best you can,
Are too too little to complete a man;
This accidental good does riot give,
One spendthrift makes many poor men live.
If beasts be hungry in the desert field,
The earth their meat, their drink the rivers yield;
What wicked hopes do mortals entertain
Seeking to shun hungers heart-biting pain:
Untimely fasting, a Nemesis we see
Of man's untimely feasting impiously,
Man eat, when God forbad him to do so,
Therefore when man would eat, often God says no;
Thus man before he is thought worthy of meat,
He must find out some way to toil and sweat:
So when the Youth begins his painful trade,
He sees what he is now, what he was made.
But lo, I hear some say; the Schollar's blessed,
As free from labor, and enjoying rest,
Talking of dancing Nymphs, and shaddowy woods,
Parnassus groves, and pleasant running floods;
It Is envyes voice; who discontented still,
That which shek nowes not, discommend she will.
Put Damocles in Dionysius place,
He Will praise the pleasure, but enjoy no peace:
That thou may wear the Ivy, can thou look
With sleepelesse eyes, and paleface on thy book?
What mean the Vultures which Prometheus tear,
But watchful study, and heart-eating care.
As in a clock, springs motion does make
The barrel, fusie, wheels, and balance shake:
So when the mind does stir with thoughts oppressed,
Think you the bodies spirits are at rest.
But look what does his encyclopedy
Teach him, but lectures of his misery.
Cause Paradises tongue he cannot reach,
Grammar does him Babels confusion teach;
His life time cannot give what cradles could,
Mithridate was a babe, if tongues were told.
So little credit man has, without art
Of Rhetoric, he cannot move the heart;
His smoothed tongue he does more powerful find,
Then reason; yet his words are often but wind.
Dark ignorance so mantles up his wit,
That Platoes year can scarce deliver it,
From rotnesse of the Logic systemes rabble,
Which proving all things, proves man a babble.
He by Arithmeticke can pick the shore
Of all his sands; and add to millions more,
Divide and multiply the stars, and tell
How many drops do make the Ocean swell;
But when he comes his days to calculate,
He finds a figure or two do stand for that.
Though music be a sweet solatious thing,
It teaches him his Lachrimae to sing,
And Swan-like in a doleful Elegy,
A dying to bewail mortality.
A stronomy does make him discontent,
That he should peep up through an instrument,
And take the elevation of that place,
From whence he had his being and his race.
Whiles that Geometry does teach him how
The surface of this earthly globe to view,
To cut it out by zones and climates way,
By hotter, colder, and the longer day,
To pace it forth, in inches, rods, and miles,
From Eastern Seas, unto the Western Isles,
From days Meridian, to the midnight line,
Where night is darkest, day does brightest shine;
When he looks home to himself, he sighs and says*
In measuring earth, why spend I thus my days?
Archytas ghost, near to the Matin shore,
Besides a little dust, does seek no more;
Why should I then survey this globe with eyes,
And sore with thought above the sphered skies?
When destiny shall cut my fatal hair,
Of all this earth, seven foot shall be my share,
Thus may we see, that as in age we grow,
Sorrows along with us in age do go,
A Youth one comfort after all, at last
Receives; some of his toil and sorrows past.

What Heaven above, below, the Sea, and Land
Contain, all stand and fall at thy command.
Father, all things to thee their eyes do bend,
Thou do, to them their food in season send;
What ere thou have created by thy word,
Thou keepst, if they acknowledge Thee their Lord.
Thou with thy blessing feedst the wandering Crow,
Although it cannot either till or low,
The Lillies of the field they cannot twist
Or spinne, yet are they, Lord, so by Thee blessed,
That Solomon in all his rich array,
Was not so glorious as they are gay.
Why art thou Soul cast down with fear and care?
Trust in thy Lord and Maker, He Is thy share
And portion sure, who will unto thee grant,
What useful things for life he knows thee want.
But yet lest idleness should on me cease,
Which is the Hydra of vice, and Souls disease:
Give me some calling Lord, whereby I may,
Sweat truly for my daily bread, this day,
Which may maintain my gray-haires, when I can
Do nothing but bewail the state of man.
What knowledge, Lord, thou giv'st me of the creature,
Make it the on of Thee my great Creator.
When I behold the Cristall Heavens so fair,
So many winged troops piercing the air,
So many finned armies in the strands,
Rowing themselves amongst the rocks and sands;
When I behold the flowers, the fields and fennes,
The grazing flocks, the wild beasts in their dens;
When I rip up my breast, and there do find,
An earthly body, but an heavenly mind;
I see thy greatness Lord, in every thing,
To thee therefore I will here praises sing:
Till I shall come unto thy blessed train,
Then death shall put an end to all my pain.
Haec Pietas.

This is Piety.



August, or Man's Youth.
When Phoebus does with chaste Astrea meet,
Crowning the fruits and fields with influence sweet
Then plants bring forth their fruits, after their kind,
Not all alike, some good some bad we find.
So man in Youth shows by his conversation,
His towardness, and former education.
Like as the fire which long has lurkt in ashes,
When it gets stronger fuel, flames and flashes,
So nature which in weakness long did lurk,
Does now in heat of blood begin to work:
Or like strong wines in caske, when first they vent,
They show themselves in motion vehement,
So man in leavned age, and youthful prime
Gives passions most violent for a time;
Tinder nor flax takes not with Vulcanes ire
More quickly, than youths bloods set on fire,
And often condemns the Stoicke apathie,
As by his passionate ^alour we may see.
So Pellas flower did conquer all the East,
Alcides killed the many-headed beast,
Jason with the noble Youths of Greece,
In spite of dangers won the golden fleece:
This passion as it is a whetting stone
To goodness, so to evil it spurreth on.
Loves passion made Perithous desc^nd
To Plutoes house to attend his lustful end;
Anger made Eteocles kill his brother,
Nor could their funeral smoke agree together;
Revenge did cause Orestes put to death
His mother, who did give him life and breath;
So grief made Ajax turn his wrath from Troy,
And with the fatal sword himself destroy:
This age still in extremes can scarce obey
Reason, cause passion bears so great a sway,
And often, when reason and affection too
Concur, the danger's, not to overdoe.
It leads us unto a forked way,
Where the great Hercules was said to stay,
The one is broad, plumed on every side,
With Damask Roses, and with Flora's pride,
There Ceres gifts in great abundance grow,
And Bacchus cupps with nectar overflow;
There Is downy beds stuffed with swa^sike plumes,
There every thing is sweetened with perfumes;
The winged quiristers with their sweet throats,
Do warble forth their ears bereaving notes;
And painted pleasure lies all along
Upon her downs, the fragrant flowers among;
Her looks are lovely, and her eyes are clear
Much like to Venus, when she did appear
First from the sea; the honey's not so sweet,
As are her words, she is outwardly complete,
But O if one should see her breast within,
Far different would he find it from ^e^ skin.
What ever she pretends she means no less
Than death, destruction, gall, and bitterness;
Her eyes, like Basil^skes, they see and kill,
Her voice like Sirens does entise to ill;
Believe her no ways, when she sheddeth tears,
For like the Crocodiles, they are full of fears;
She gives Circean cups of giddy wine,
Mixed with toades poison, and the Lotish rine,
And turns man into Goat, or mimicke Ape,
Or Wolf, or Lion, which does roar and gape;
Often times she with her cupps so does them drench,
That without blood their thirst they cannot quench;
But which is worst of all behold the end,
To misery and death they are condemned.
A little swinish pleasure dear they buy,
With Gout, Consumption, or the Pleurisy,
And brings upon themselves such misery,
That they can choose, or do nothing, but dye.
Perhaps one Polemo who in her ways,
Has lavished out his young and tender days,
When he a wise Xenocrates does hear,
Will be ashamed, and his garlands tear;
But he is one amongst a thousand, who
Far otherwise, then he has done, will do;
For vicious custom puts them so in ure,
As that it does their hearts and minds obdure;
Their better parts from Heaven it does deface,
And tyran-like usurpeth Natures place,
Then nothing profits careful education,
And hope is gone of healthful reformation.
O what a pitty's this! Nature brought forth,
A towardness, which gave some hopes of worth;
Their mother suffered pains, and gave them suck,
And dandled them with songs of happy luck,
Then were they put to Schools, and learning taught,
And now when it is their prime, all is for naught.
The other is a steep and narrow path,
And, beside which you make, no passage has,
Its straw'd with briers, thorns grow all along,
Through which, who ere so walks, he needs must throng;
On every side are monsters, such as dwell
In Plutos prisons, and the pits of hell:
Here sits gray headed, and heart killing cares,
Here lies palefaced, and joynt-shaking fears;
Here watchful Dragons, whose unsleepy eyes,
The care-relenting Morphews never sees;
There vain and phrenticke labor rowles a stone
Like Sisyphus the craggy rocks upon;
At last Despair drooping and almost dead,
Scarcely can pull the rope over her head.
On the otherside, the furious Passions stand,
Marching with arms along, in traine-like band.
Anger with fiery eyes and frowns does threat
To pull high thundering Jove down from his seat;
Next comes Contention with her cursed brands
Seeking to set on fire both sea and lands;
Then Hatred in her hollow heart does keep
Revenge, and for occasion forth does peep;
There Rashness, on a rope hangs by the toe,
And of her boldness makes a foolish show:
Vain Hope with waxen wings does love to fly
Like I^arus, above the Azure sky.
Fierce monsters do this narrow passage bound,
And deadly dangers it encompasse round.
Yet Virtue does her followers safely guide,
Least they should go astray on either side.
Prudence through the dark windings does them lead,
Safely with Ariadnes clew of thread.
Then Virtues ushers, Courage, Constancy,
Do hearten them on against adversity:
And show them Virtues Castle, how on high.
It stands resplend^nt all with Majesty.
If they do stumble against a block or stone,
Then Constancy says, stay not here, go on;
And Hope proclaims afar: Lo here you shall
Have joy for sorrow, Honey for* your gall.
Here peace and joyful rest, for ever dwell
Which neither cross nor time shall ever quell,
So when they have these hideous monsters past
With joy they reach the mountains top at last.
Where Virtues palace stands on pillars square
The courts of gold, the gates of crystal are,
and all this glorious castle's founded on
^he Chrysolite, Sapphire, and Berill stone.
before the stately gates, black Envy lies,
^ormented with the aspect of her eyes;
^n whom, when once these Champions do trample,
Through Virtues Courts, they enter Honors Temple,
Then Glory does eternal Trophies raise,
And Fame Seraphik-like, their name does blaze.
There but two ways; and yet where one dare venture
On this, a thousand by the other enter:
Virtue, often, all alone does go and dwell;
Pleasure does lead whole colonies to hell.
Nay, I dare say, the most of men do stray
At first, and enter in the broader way;
Happy are they who do return, before
They run too deep in cursed pleasures score,
Dark ignorance does blindfold many so,
That from the mean into the extremes they go.
Their ship scarce from the shore her course does take,
When she on deadly rocks does shipwreck make;
Others have knowledge and the best desire,
But crossed with storms and fortunes spightfull ire,
There strength and means answer not to their mind,
And so poor souls they are forced to lag behind.
Amongst so many thousands of this age
How few with fair applause go off the stage;
And yet those few like Gideons fleece, we see
Tith'd by untimely fates mortality.
When fruits are almost ripe, storm can them shake,
When Youth is almost man, death may him take.
Search you deaths Lime pits, and you will find therein,
As often the Young Steeres as the Oxes skin;
Often time old gray-haird wrinkles swim in tears,
For you these who dyed in their prime of years;
The ancient Pollard Oak ofttimes does see,
The overthrowing of a Young Beech tree,
This only law is propper unto man,
To dye, or soon, or late, do what he can.
One way he comes to life, if Fates dispose
Will once of him, a thousand ways he goes.

The stormy seas do not with waves so fret,
When roaring surges, glowming clouds do threat,
As with contrary tides my breast does swell,
And doubtful thoughts my plunged soul does quell;
Whilst furious anger does me headlong lead,
And shaking fears do strike me almost dead;
While hope does raise and sorrow down me cast;
Lord after storm, show forth thy calm at last.
Chase anger, fear, vain hope and grief away,
That joy and rest of soul, enjoy I may.
The first fruits of my young age sanctify,
With strength of body, strength thy grace in me,
Direct me Lord along thy narrow path,
Which may lead me to Heaven, by saving faith,
Strengthen me with perseverance to the end,
From Satan, and Hels monsters me defend:
So when I shall come to Heavens rest, I Will sing,
O cruel death, where is thy deadly sting:
And when I shall triumph in Heaven with thee,
I Will say, O Grave, where is thy victory,
Before I want this rest, I had rather go
Through thousand Lab'rinths of this mortal woe.
These worldly crosses, last but for a day,
And like the Eastwind, quickly fly away:
But sure I am when earthly sorrow's past,
Heavens thought-surpassing joy shall ever last.
Aequa Die nox est.

Summers Equinoctial.



AVTVMNE.
September, or Man's age.
When Libra in equal scales weighs night and day,
And Phoebus through the midline makes his way:
Then every plant thankful to nature seedeth,
As it was bred, so other plants it breeds,
For view the Universe and you shall find,
That every thing seeks to preserve its kind;
With sex and seed nature bids multiply
Man, beast, the foul and fish, the herb and tree,
None of their volumes ere so great can be,
Which compendiz'd in seed, we do not see,
And none so mean and small but do increase
And multiply the more, because they are less.
Man's age, man's life when it does equal share,
In by past nights, and days which coming are,
Then man in his September seeks a mate,
His speece for to conserve and propagate.
When God into man's nostrils breathed life,
He fittest thought for him to have a wife,
And he who said, woe to him who is alone,
Gave man a consort and companion:
He gave him not a Peacock nor a Goat,
Nor Dog, nor Parret with her mimicke throat,
But of himself his fellow he did make,
And from his side his consort he did take.
But all this while Satan man's mortal foe,
Lurking his craft and malice did not show,
So when he saw the weaker sex of man,
To use his stratagems then he began.
Sometimes Themistocles was wont to say,
That Diophantus Athens state did sway;
The Childs desire was all his mothers will,
Nor would she rest till he did that fulfill;
And Athens was obedient to his call,
So by Sorites Diophant was all;
And wherein Adam did trespass he knew:
His offspring thereof should be guilty too*
So when the devil that lying Sophister.
With cunning captions had seduced her,
She with her Complements to cogge began,
In place of joy becoming woe to man;
And justly so for trusting her relation,
Better then God, and works of the Creation;
Thus marriage which before a blessing was
Became a curse, because of man's trespass.
O doleful, doubtful case! what shall man do?
He knows not here what hand to turn him to,
If ^e live all alone, he childlesse goes
To grave, chaste Venus joys he never knows;
Unthankful to dame Nature he does live,
Who life received, but life to none will give;
Much like as Cato came to Flora's play,
And having entered, straight did run away;
So Natures stage, he entering rather can
Depart, before he act the married man;
Before he will glad marriage torches have,
With funeral Lights he is carried to his grave;
He lives, but to what end? that he may see,
The world, and like Ephemeron quickly die;
All of him dies at once, his overthrow
Is total, death does kill him at one blow;
The curse of Onan he must undergo,
Cause being bid raise seed he did not so;
What if all were like him, where should there be
Saints for the Heaven, for earth posterity;
Great Xerxes then might justly shed his tears,
And say, that all should dye within few years.
In joy he has no true companion,
And knows not how for to rejoice alone;
Woes him in sorrow, he must needs despair,
Who has no fellow, who may with him share;
His riches who shall have, he does not know,
A stranger reapes them, who did never sow.
What if the Assyrian bird lives without mate,
And yet her rarest kind does propagate?
What if some Phenix-like can Virgins live?
To those we honor due and reverence give;
For when they are burned in glory's spycie flame,
They leave eternal offspring of their fame;
But we of mankind talk, where one so dies,
A thousand batchlers in oblivion lies.
What shall he marry? that is a life of care,
Of sorrow, poverty, if not despair.
For every one is not a Socrates
Who can a bold and mad Xantippe please.
Our life's a journey to our heavenly abode,
He walks with ease, who walks without a load;
This life's a warrefare, wherein we must fight
Against Stepmother Fortunes ire and spite,
The greater burdens do a man oppress,
He needs must sincke the more, and fight the less,
What man has not his cross, which he must carry;
He Is subject to another if he marry;
Weigh man and wife, and (as Tiresias said
Of her desire) you will find her cross down weighed.
Does beauty like thee? that a foe does prove
Oftimes to chastity and marriage love,
Not fit for Gyges sight, once made a prey
To lust, for grief, it made it self away.
Great portions please thee; these are cause of pride,
Disdain and brauling jarres on either side,
Terentia queld Tullyes sweet eloquence,
To Antony often Fulvia gave offense;
In marriage who are veiled for modesty,
Once married take to them supremacy;
I will not talk of great Alcides wife
And Claudius shrew, judges of death and life;
Some thinking joys, the more they common are
The greater, will have no peculiare;
A bad wife, a consumption you may call,
For none but death can free thee from her thrall.
You Will praise Penelope and Alcestis care,
And she, who thought all, like ^er huband were;
But every one cannot to Corinth sail,
All wish the best, but all cannot prevail;
Wife's choos'd by Lott'ry, be you never so wise,
You may have forty blanks, and not one prise.
Suppose you have a good one, chaste and fair,
Both rich and modest prudent, full of care,
Teeming with children, never raising strife,
Like to Cornelta or a Sabin wife;
If death shall take her, or fatality,
Undo her, if thy children dear shall dye.
Then for thy former joys, what grief is seen,
Happy were thou, if happy thou had not been.
Like as the widdower turtle all alone,
Makes sad the shaddowy groves with doleful moan,
Searching each wood; no wood his mate does give,
Yet search he will; alone he cannot live:
So is it with thee, whom love tied with his knot,
By thee, that love can never be forgot;
Thou'st lost thy better part, thou pin'st away,
Half man, defrauding grave, and wronging day;
Perhaps thy dreams in sleep do make thee blessed,
While as thou fancies her in midnight rest,
And she belyes thy joy; but once awake,
Then more, and more thou grievest for her sake,
Thou wear'st out nights and days in grief and moan,
Like Orpheus, when Eurydice was gone,
He broke his strings, and Harp away he cast,
When she the second time to hell had past.
O doleful case of man! O cruel fa^e!
Marry, or not, still wr^tched is his state.
Good God! has wretched man come this far on,
And yet can find no joy to build upon,
In Autumn such a tempest if he see*
What think you will his stormy Winter be?

Almighty God, who gave strait command,
To honor parents and our sacred Sires;
That so we may enjoy the promised land,
And brook thy blessings and our hearts desires;
Thou likewise say, men do parents leave
Betaking them to marriage chastity,
That they may to their lawful^ consorts cleave,
And have some comfort of posterity.
But he that will not for thy sake leave all,
Parents, wife, children, and what goods he has,
Unworthy of thee (O Lord) thou do him call,
Who should be saved by thy blessed death
Some after wedding, drink the cheerful wine
Of gladness, while their cup does overflow,
While without dregs of sorrow it does shine,
What want and trouble means they do not know.
If I shall drink the water of affliction,
Because the marriage wine is gone and past,
Turne't into nectar of thy benediction;
So shall the wine be best which comes at last.
^n all estates, Lord grant me constancy,
Least I with good success be overjoyed,
Or yet cast down with great adversity,
Let me not be with crosses much annoyed.
What e're the state of this my marriage is,
I shall one day a better wedding see;
With this one comfort, Lord, my Soul I bliss,
With thee Heavens Lord, my Soul shall married be.
Jacob, great Iuda's sire wrought ear and late,
He thought the time quickly away did slide,
Though worn in night with cold, in day with heat,
All seemed nothing, cause he loved his bride.
Shall not my Soul, for Christ the bridegroomes glory,
Suffer what ever mortal cross shall be,
For all these crosses are but transitory,
His joys shall last to all eternity.
He did poor soul, so much of thee esteem,
Delivering thee from Hels infernal pit,
That with his blood, he did thy life redeem,
That thou may with him in his glory sit.
Watch therefore, Soul, let not thy Lights go out,
Let constant hope, and faith, still persevere,
So when thy blessed Bridegroomes joyful shout,
Shall rise, thou may enter without fear.
Then millions of winged Angels shall,
Unto Heavens glorious firy-courts thee bring,
And there amongst these troops Celestial,
The Seraphines thy marriage song shall sing.
Habet stimulum in cauda.

He has a sting in his tale.



October, or middle age.
When Scorpius in his bending cleyes does gripe
Phoebus, and gray-haird Ceres fruits are ripe,
Then wisht-for times to husbandmen appear,
When rural Gods has blessed the fruitful year;
Then Corn is reapt, and joyfully they mow,
And gather, what in hopes they first did sow;
Then every man and beast, with sweat do toil,
To take the Harvest from the fertile soil,
When Parents do enjoy their wish, and see
Their children come to full maturity,
Then is the Harvest of the life of man,
Then every one endeav'reth what he can.
Like as the Pisemires with their numerous bands,
Six-footed creatures cover fields and lands,
When they do carry home their Winter store,
Great stackes of Corn, they lessen more and more:
So men in companies themselves divide,
And rob the world of riches and her pride.
What Country does beneath the Horizon lie,
What sea, what place, not seen by Phoebus eye,
What depth, what darkness near unto the Center,
Is there, to which man's labor does not venture?
Thus India sometime rich, does now complain,
And Pactol, which with Gold, Midas did stain:
Tagus, and Iber, once did richly flow,
But now their Channels moss does overgrow,
Now seek they, what they gave, from foreign coasts,
In vain now Corinth of her Copper boasts:
The daughters of the Sun do not decore
With Amber tears Eridanus his shore:
In vain the Arabian picks the glistring sands
For Gemmes, Sidon admires her empty strands.
Sparta no scarlet* Amycle no wool
Produces, other coasts are thereof full;
The Phoenix knows not where her nest to build*
Sabea cannot savory spices yield,
Paros exhausted is of Marble stone,
Mauri^ias precious tables are all gone;
And thou fair Babylon, some time ago
What were thy hangings, now thou do not know;
Persia take heed, the Chalybes can give
No iron, though in this iron age they live;
Salon thy darts are gone, which thou was wont,
Amidst thy stream* to temper hard as flint;
Ceres from fertile Gargara has fled,
And Sicily by Enna scarce is fed;
Dodon no Acornes, Egypt Lentiles send,
Nor do we now Methymnas grapes commend;
In Gaurus and Falernas wines are rare,
With Hymet any place dare most compare,
Corsicke no honey yields; Ida has lost
His pines; of groaves Parnassus cannot boast,
Idume sends no palms, nor Cyrnus yewes,
Nor Pestum roses of so many hewes;
Cilicias gardens seldom saffron sees;
Eurotas banck's do bear no olive trees,
Now Pontus bezer, Colchis poison lack,
This long ago does mourn for Argos sake.
Industrious mankind patient of great toil,
Make monsters, men, beasts, fish, fowls change their soil.
The glory of horses, Epire has forsaken,
And Britain has Calabrius glory taken,
Whose sheep do go beyond Euganean flocks,
With snowlike fleeces and their curled locks,
The Lions which kings Iubas land has bred,
We see them in our chains and fetters led;
The Daunian wolves, Spartan, Molossian dogs,
The Marsian Bores* Arcadian bears, and hogs;
The African may here his monsters find,
His painted birds, and fowls of strangest kind.
O mankind borne to bear care and distress,
Who dare Natures furthest bounds trangresse,
Thou plow'st the seas, not fearing doleful wrack,
And tramplest on the Tyran Neptunes back,
Thou do the ruins of the Heaven uphold,
Thou do thy self in foamy waves enfold,
Thou dare the wind, and wearyest threatening fate,
When Heaven and stormy seas, are at debate;
Often times thy lodging is a roaring rock,
Or planke, to storms you are then a mocking stock;
Thou see thy fellows tumble, nor do know,
What first shall give thee deaths last cursed blow.
Then call'st thou Heaven for help, and none can find,
Increasing seas with tears, with sighs the wind;
But when thou come unto the wisht-for shore,
Thou will not vow, that thou shall sail no more,
But while thou shipbroke, beg'st for misery,
Thou think another voyage how to try.
Thou know not how at home to live in rest,
Meanly, and therefore still will be distressed.
Some seek Niles source, the Poles some come so near,
That light and darkness does complete a year;
There newfound Lands, nor can one world suffice,
What man's too curious fancy does devise;
Some dig earths cavernes, not unlike to moles,
Hating the day, they live in pits and holes,
And from Cimmerian darkness of the hell,
They seek their riches from cursed Pluto's cell.
Some like the fishes dive into the strands,
And there do grople amongst the rocks and sands.
O toylesome Lote of men! has so the fates
Ordained their life? O hard commanding fates!
Nature thought good her treasures to conceal,
Which nothing, besides labor, can reveal.
The Ox bred bees with stings defend their hives,
And fight for them, as for their dearest lives:
The Rose is fenc't with prickies round about,
He must be pricked, who seeks to find them out,
The Moly bears a blossom white as snow,
His swarthy root deep in the earth does grow,
It cures maladies of every kind,
But hardly dug up, when men it find:
With all the grove so Proserpine does cover
The bough, with which men Lethes flood pass over,
Who seek from the Hesperides a prize,
Must lull a sleep the Dragons watchful eyes.
What nature has produced work it must,
Heaven by the intelligence about is thrust,
It knows no rest, the sun from East does rise,
And toward West does course along the skies,
Up from the Goat he climes to Cancers seat,
Then to the Goat again he makes retreat.
The Moon her courses multiplyeth so
That still one countenance she never does show;
The earth keeps seasons of the year, in spring
She brings forth the buddes of every thing;
In summer she them heat and moisture yields,
With corn in Autumn she does crown the fields,
But when the Winter storms and winds do blow,
She Is wrapped up with seed in fleece of Snow:
The Sea rests never, beasts must undergo
The yoke of toil, and mankind must live so.
Then you my fellows let us still advance,
Through all these hazards of unluckie chance,
Our lot is elsewhere, joy shall come at last,
Then gladly shall we think of troubles past.

From mornings East, unto the evenings West,
From South, to North, as Poles do rise and fall,
Men framing Fortune still seek for the best,
And often too curious are deceived of all.
They seek what fire and water can destroy,
Or moth consume, or thief can steal away,
Or wherein they do place their greatest joy,
The enemy can take it as a prey.
Heaven has my treasure with my Lord and King,
With companies of glorious Saints in bliss,
Where holy quires do dance triumph and sing,
They follow, and our Savior leader is.
Here Nectar rivers every where do flow,
Joy without sorrow, holy daliance,
Here stands Ambrosias heaps, where ere you go,
And what immortal glory can advance.
If you should multiply ten thousand ages,
They shall not end this joy and glorious light,
Nay though you go beyond ten thousand stages,
Nor all the days which never shall know night.
Hither lead me, O Lord through all distress,
Over mountains of the land, rocks of the seas,
Through whatsoever has no quietness,
Through storms and thunder, if it so Thee please.
So that the Haven of this my voyage be,
Heavens rest, so that the goal be of my race,
The Court of Angels, who attend on Thee,
And in thy Fathers house some dwelling place.
Sagitta in nervo est.

I have bended my bow.



November, or age far spent.
When Pleiades do rise from Eastern hindge,
And now November latter harvest brings
Vshering the Winter; men do Ceres huccen,
Which is unhusked by hard* treading Oxen;
Then from the pressed grapes the wine runs down,
And Must with Nectars foame, the Fats does crown;
From waxen cells, some do the honey strain,
And pots are full, while empty hives complain;
Then every one works what in him can lie
Yet all one and the same work do not ply.
Even suchlike men in full ripe age, we find,
Whose faces differ no more then their mind;
Each one a diverse palate has, nor can
One taste that which likes well another man;
Some soar like Eagles, and will reach the sky,
Others, like vermin, in earths dust do lie;
There few, or none, but whom great Jove does love,
Who keep the mean, who wise and happy prove.
Ambition mortals greatest plague does hye,
Upwards, and with Icarian wings will fly;
While Gyant-like, she will rob Heaven of all,
She catches still the more notorious fall.
Pellas fair flower, who could not be content
With the rich conquest of the Orient,
Nor with a mortal father did proclaim
Himself Jove's bastard, to his Parents shame;
The hoof which Lethes water did contain,
Did prove him mortal, and his hopes but vain,
Whose huge desires, one world could not suffice,
A short and narrow coffin was his prize.
God tyrans flouts, nor can with pride away,
Without a rival, he the world does sway,
Nor could Alcides club or hayrie coat,
Save from a fatal rope Commodus throat.
Caligula most impious amongst men,
Dared to behead his Country Gods, and then
Did cause their shoulders his gold'n head up bear,
That all might worship him with divine fear.
O cursed impiety that can no way
Be expiated! which with Heaven's scepter sway,
And match their Scepters with Jove's thundering hand,
Who does the greatest Monarchies command,
There Scepters are but frail, and fortune strange,
There Scepters with a beggars staff does change;
Why do these purple tyranes often dye
Shedding their purple souls most cruelly?
Because Heavens Deity then do contemn,
And like Salmonius thunder amongst men.
For others Fortune wisely did foresee,
Cradels well fitting with their low degree,
Commanding them no ways to aspire so high
As to usurp sacred supremacy:
Yet some have so ambitious desire,
They will not live second in Romes Empire.
Monsters of men, Earths plagues* Hells cursed brood,
They will be wicked cause the Gods are good,
Seeking to ensnare Earthes Sacred government:
Besides cursed treason they have no intent,
But yet heavens hand can still that power defend,
Which to its blessed anointed it does lend;
They Are authors of their woe, they catch a fall,
And cursed death just Nemesis of all,
Who scale the Cedars find top-boughes too weak,
Which once oppressed easily do break:
Much like a whirle^ wind rushing from above,
Waxing still more, the more that it does move,
While it does wrestle with the aged Oak,
It weak'ns its eager strength at every stroke:
So does ambition vex those, who do fly,
With all their might to supreme dignity;
Which when they cannot reach, they break their strength,
And with their weight, they fall to ground at length,
They seek the honors against the Eternal Will
Of Jove. When thunder strikes the highest hill,
More safely in a cottage you may lurk,
Then in a Palace cursed treason work,
Better with Clymene at home to abide,
Then Phoebus flaming horses to misguide;
What greater madness then to tempt the Sun
With waxen wings, which presently will run?
Sail softly; Fortune passes by the shores,
Catching the ship, which with her streamers soars.
O happy mankind, if men once did know
With mean estate themselves content to show!
That life is safest which does keep a mean,
Free from ambition, and from falsehood clean;
It neither stands nor falls at vulgars breath,
Nor fears ambitious Sejans cursed death;
Nor Manlius fate, who would be Lord of Rome,
And from the Capitol had both praise and doom.
Some men do seek with gold, their bags to fill,
And hoording treasures, thirst for treasures still;
They scrape what ever flows from Hermus sand,
And what the red sea casts forth to land,
They deifie their riches and their store;
The more it is, they seek for more and more;
Their chincky breasts they cannot fill with gold,
Their hearts desire their coffers cannot hold:
They covet more, the greater state they have,
And having purchased more, still more they crave;
Thou cursed Plague of mankind avarice,
Author of woe and Hydra of all vice,
Earths Genious thou only do adore,
Neglecting Heaven which lasts for evermore;
Thou like the dropsy still thy thirst do feed,
The more thou drinkest, greater is thy need,
With care and fear, the more thou do possess,
With grief thou think thy riches less and less,
Were It not for thee, mortals might happy be,
Such as the blessed golden age did see;
Good without fear of Laws, who still did smile
Content with every state, rich without guile.
Some love to feast their bellies all the day,
With Salian cates in idleness and play;
They do devour whole woods and lakes, and Seas,
And Falerne mountains, so their gut to please;
They feast the Sun, carowsing to the night,
And weary out the next ensuing light.
Tell me whose glory is only dainety fare,
Such as Vitellius, Aesops dishes were;
Tell me who Ceres doubtful suppers love,
At last, what does your waste and charges prove?
These soft delights do break your sinewie strength,
And dropsy shakes loose your joints at length;
What comes of all your cates? the jakes can tell,
Which turns your gold into Mephitis smell.
Thrice and more happy is the sober man,
Who on a little live contented can;
Like Heraclitus, who with meal and water
Maintains the peace, and knows not how to flatter;
He think it enough, what God does sparely give,
And in his mean estate does richly live:
He does his bread-corne by the Plough provide,
And loves to sup hard by the river side:
Whose water to his sober palate tastes,
Better then Nectar, which the gluttons wastes;
His mind is constant, chaste, and moderate,
Himself is honest, strong, and temperate;
Like Curij and Camilli, who did dwell
In cottages, whom nothing ere could quell;
Or like Serranus who his plough did leave,
That he Romes powerful ensigns might receive;
O happy Souls, who with eternal praise,
Did bless their Country, and their trophies raise.
The Soldier, who with fiery courage stands,
Against the Martial fierce encountering bands,
Who with his sword makes way, and will not fly,
Maintaining Church, and Countries liberty;
Whether in darkness he ly'th centenall,
Or does entrench his forces with a wall,
Or on a sudden fell down tallest woods,
Or undermine strong Towns, or swim o'refloods,
Or break the ice, search Foordes, assail the Ports,
Or with fierce warlike engines batter Forts;
He for his Countries sake, is glad to dye,
And will with honest wounds his courage try,
While first he scales the wall, and through runs,
The Fortlets, fearing neither swords nor gunnes.
So when he leads his captive foes in chains,
When iron-men, when Horse, and Mars his trains
Do show his spoils, and with his Trophies march,
The fight is read in the triumphall Arch,
With feasts and shows, they do renew the day,
With triumph-songs his glory they display;
Trumpets forgetting ire, sound joy and peace*
He in his chariot rides aloft with grace.
So through the ruin of the wall he goes,
And feeds the eyes of all men with his shows;
Higher he cannot reach, but fall he may,
From top of glory into mire and clay;
Fortune with Triumphs deals unconstantly,
And victory with doubtful wings does fly.
Boast of thy triumphs Hannibal and tell,
How thou the Ports of Rome with fear did quell,
Measure their Knights in bushels, mountains break
With vinegar; when fortune shall forsake
Thy standard, thou must serve a foreign King,
Till thou at length dy'st by thy poisoned ring;
Why boasts Achilles that fierce Hector's gone,
If Paris shall revenge his death anon;
From Troy with triumph Agamemnon goes,
But (ah) at home he finds his fa^all foes.
Inconstant lot of men, which greatest things,
To greater downfall and confusion brings!
If Craesus hold the top of Fortunes wheel,
Cyrus anon will cause him downward reele,
Until incensed Tomyris does thrust
His head in blood, his honor in the dust;
So fortune constant in unconstancy,
And false, thou changest lowest things with high.
Happy is he who sets himself for all
Chances, who hopes a rising, fears a fall,
And so does guide his life in all estates,
That he nor cares for Fortunes smiles nor threats:
Like as a rock which stands with fixed roots,
At winds and whirling tempests scoffs and flouts;
They break themselves while with impetuous chocke
They dash and butte against the unmoved rock;
Even so a wise man, if a tumult rise,
Can vulgar fears and levity despise,
If fates do cross him with an hateful ire,
Before his patience, their despite does tire.
Nay if the world should fall about his ears,
It would not quell his constant heart with fears.

Grant courage Lord, and by thy saving grace,
Through all mine hostile troops me safely lead,
Suffer me not to shrink from rank and place,
But fight against treach'ry, envy, fear and dread.
My inward enemy does my heart assail,
My outward foe with wounds upon me set,
Go where I will, my foemen do prevail,
With Satan's bloody ambush I Am beset.
You Are my Captain, You Are my God and Lord,
My castle, safety, rock, defense, and prize
Thy shadow, safeguard can to me afford,
Against all what ever enemies devise.
Till they be put to rout, and I set free,
Then shall thou Tyrans to subjection bring
Under thy great Man-person'd Deity,
And with their bands, their rebel neck's shall wring.
When from Heavens corners, trumpets loud shall blow,
When thou O Lord the wicked do endite,
Thou in the clouds shall make a glorious show,
And with thy Fathers blessed ones invite.
O what a triumph shall that triumph be,
When godly men shall from their graves arise
Before their Savior; and impiety
Shall stand before their Judges flaming eyes.
The wicked shall pass to Sulphurous fire,
There tortures to endure without all end,
The flame, the worm, the whips that never tire,
And to eternal darkness be condemned.
The godly mount on high with glorious song,
Among Seraphims and Cherubims most bright,
With triumph-pomp, convoying Christ along
To Enjoy all pleasure, glory in Gods sight.
Fruor Par^tis.

I enjoy my fruits.



WINTER.
December, or old age.
When Phoebus makes to Capricorn retreat,
In Southward declination lessoning heat,
Then days do languish and the sa^der year,
Looks gloomy with his cold and doleful cheer;
Not like that year, which Flora's pride did show,
With Roses red, and Lillies white as snow;
The days halfe-shortned more and more decrease,
The nights extended and the Light grows less;
Then mortals in Cimmerian darkness dwell.
The air with hoare-frost, winds with coldness swell;
Rivers are duld with ice, the earth is bound
With cold, and pooles of tears overflow the ground;
The Sea looks gray with waves, and every thing
Does droope, for absence of the pleasant spring:
So sad and slow, old age on man does seize,
Fraughted with evils, an Hydra of cursd disease,
Lothing it self, often so it hates the day,
That joyfully it makes it self away.
Then crasie gray-haires clothes the head with snow,
And swanlike plumes about the temples grow:
Like as an Oak which Boreas bare has made,
Look's bald, only its stock does cast a shade;
So man's malignant age, with dreary fate,
Does rob him of his locks, and peele his pate.
Leafs fall, shows Winter, man is near to dye,
When age the fatal razor does supply.
What now availes the Ivory beauties grace,
Which did with Pestane Roses paint the face,
As Amaranths which grow white Lillies by,
Or Thracian snow, which takes vermillion dye,
Now is it plough'd with wrinckles and looks wan,
And lean, more like a withered weed then man;
Like scorched grass, when Sirius heat does burn,
And into ashes does earths moisture turn:
His cheeks are hollow, his body looks thin
In place of muscles hangs a wrinckled skin:
His gemme-like eyes sometime Dames natures pride
Are dim, and now for shame themselves do hide,
They scarce can see the Sun, they are blind as Moles,
In place of eyes, we see nothing but holes.
His back's a ridged bone, his shoulders bend,
Which sometimes could with Pelops well contend;
All feature's gone, his beauties fair and bright
Is made a sceleton and ugly sight.
Mad Paris; why to Sparta do thou hye,
To break the laws of hospitality?
Why do thou call the Grecian fleet to Troy,
Which before it does return will it destroy?
Is 't cause thy breast with love is set on fire,
And thou nothing but Hellen can desire?
Look to thy mothers wrinckles and her face,
Which age and filthy leanness does disgrace;
Her bleardnesse and her age thou do detest
Yet once it kindled fire in Priams breast:
Helen thy greatest joy and sole delight,
After thy death and Juno's deadly spite,
After friends slaughters, and thy sisters rape,
Shall scratch her wrinckles like a munckie Ape,
And often with tears shall blot the looking glass,
Seeing what she is now, and what she was.
What profits strength, when feeble age does shrink,
The body under his own weight shall sink,
Jove's sacred oak, whose growing standing age,
Two hundred years has stood against Boreas rage,
When the third fatal age is come at last,
It staggers yielding to the meanest blast:
Atlas, who did the starry Heaven uphold,
When worn with space of years ^e waxed old,
He laid his charge Alcides neck upon,
Whom Jove begetting* drove two nights in one:
Milon, who learnd to carry by degrees
A Bull, did weep to see his feeble knees,
When worn with age, his sinews he did find,
And Limbs not answering to his champion mind.
The Lion, at whose noise, the woods did quake,
And every beast, with dreadful fear did shake,
Now broken with years, he scarce his tail can drag,
Behind the silly flocks he is forced to lagge,
He Is hunger bitten, the herds securely play,
He sees, but cannot catch his wonted prey.
Even so the Soldier who did wear a Crown
Of Oak, and often triumphed with renown,
(Such as brave Cocles for his Country stood,
Or Romulus sprinkled with Acrons blood,
Or stout Marcellus, or fierce Cossus which
Did Jupiter Feretrius all enrich)
Now free to Mars he hangs up his arms,
Nor is he sturred up with fierce alarmes;
When Martial trumpets sound, and drums are beaten,
When horses neigh, when noise the stars does threaten,
He sits unmoved, nothing his courage whets,
His wonted heat and spirit he forgets.
The Mariner who saild the Pygmies coast*
After with many storms he has been tossed,
He takes himself to rest, because he can
Not now endure the raging Ocean;
He hangs his pitchie clothes on Neptunes shrine,
The land both him and ship does now confine,
Both weary of Sea; it rots upon the shore,
He lies at home, cause he can sail more;
That which the Sea has left, and storms and toil,
He minds to trust it to his Country soil.
Sweetness is gone, nothing but dregs remain,
The bottom does both least and worst contain.
Why seek you wretched men to reckon your days
With three aged Nestor? as if it were praise,
To live beyond the Stagge, and Crow; no day
Does want his cross, each hour which does delay
Our death, prolongs our misery, our woe
Increases more, the more in age we grow;
The leaking ship, the longer way she makes,
The greater danger still she undertakes;
And if she shall lanch further in the deep,
No skillful Art can her from shipwreck keep.
Thrice happy Troile who did bravely dye,
Before thy gray-haires tasted misery;
If destinies had so with Priame dealt,
He should not have so grievous sorrowe's felt,
His childrens death, rapes, flames and clamorous groans*
Nor with his blood, have drenched the Altar stones.
What does not age consume? The monument
Of Caria's gone, the Pyramids are spent;
Rhodes graet Colossus now is turned to naught,
And strength of body is to weakness brought;
Age lessning vigor turns man to a ghost,
Who lately did of nerves and sinews boast.
Beauty decays, wealth cannot cure disease,
On Natures gifts, consuming age does seize;
Constant and firm, Virtue remains alone,
And comforts age, when strength and all are gone,
Gray-haires provision. Like as Phoebus bright
Darkneth the Planets with his greater light;
So virtues greatness does all sorrowesquell
And suffers not hearts sad complaints to swell.
It does content it self, its own reward
In greatest danger, still the safest guard.
When flames did Syracuses Castles burn,
When Roman forces did them overturne;
Among slaughters, clamours, ruins, deadly noise,
Thou Archimedes only did rejoice;
Alcyon-like in trouble thou had rest,
And scarsely felt the sword thrust in thy breast.
O happy rest of mind, O only pleasure,
Comfort of age, man's blessed and only treasure,
Thou lessnest woe, nothing can thee annoy,
In midst of misery, thou affordest joy.

Gray bayres encompasse now my head, snowes
Tell me that Boreas blows.
A foggy dimmenesse does my eyes assail,
My grinders gin to fail.
My staggering pillars cannot stand at all,
My house is near to fall.
Old age brings with it sickness and disease,
My limbs seek sluggish ease.
All pleasure's gone; it does me sore annoy,
To think of youths delight and former joy.
My mind does dream of Ghostes, before mine eyes
Deaths image still does rise.
When errors of my youth I call to mind,
Old age does sorrow find.
Youths glory like the rainebowes painted spheres,
Does vanish into tears.
O Father pardon and with saving faith,
Repair what loss age has.
Let thy good spirit quicken thy grace in me,
That Heaven my thought, my hearts desire may be.
Grant me assurance of forgivness Lord,
Earnest of sprit and word.
So shall the thought of Heavens eternal rest,
Comfort my soul distressed.
So let me be dissolved, to be with Thee,
Our Father, Lord, to see.
Where blessed peace, eternal joy does dwell,
Which no time e're can quell.
Where faith does sight, and hope does wish obtain,
Where endless love for evermore shall reign.
Cavete.

Take heed.



January, or Death.
When cold Aquarius empties all his paile,
And Jupiter with clouds the world does veil,
When noysing tempest jerks the winter sky,
And crackling hail, alongs the air does fly,
Then to earths bowels Plants do send their juice,
And every thing benumbed stands with ice;
If any seeds of life are to be found,
They lie etombed in the frosty ground;
The groaning woods, their burdens cannot bear,
Which from the stock the boughs and bark do tear,
With icy setters rivers fast are bound.
And in a Crystal coffing Lakes are found,
Live fishes in dead waters swim, and cold,
Cramplike, the earth does with Convulsion hold:
Man's winter is, when he has waxed old,
And with his staff, can scarce himself uphold;
The less he grows, the heavier he him finds,
And stooping down, nothing but grave he minds,
Thither he hastening with three feet, cannot
Make good his pace, and falls in Charons boat.
We know our birth; there is one way to this light,
But more then thousand ways to fatal night;
The destinies do cut the thread new spunne,
As well as that, which wearing has undone.
Death misseth none, and Proteus could not take
More shapes, then she strange kinds of death can make;
To some more cruel torments she invents,
Gibbet and Rack, which natural death prevents;
To some more meek, them softly she outweares,
Substracting life, by multiplying years;
What man can tell the many thousand kinds
Of strange diseases, which for man she finds?
Sun never so many A tomes fly,
As fates have ways for our Mortality;
We have one life, we may a thousand ways
Lose it; each stroke of pulse can end our days.
Whether consumption us extenuate,
As wax with lingering fire is macerate,
Or too much heat or moisture does us quell,
Or squincie inflames the jaws and makes them swell;
Or aches, meegrimes, head-tormenting pain,
And staring catalepsis from the brain;
Or a continual sleep of lethargy,
Or giddy shaking of some Artery;
Or strong Convulsion fits of crampe or gout,
Or leprosy which paints the skin without;
And deadly water which puffes up the skin,
Thirsting the more, the more it swilleth in:
Or running cancer usher us to death,
Or vital bellows scarce afford us breath;
Or pox or measles; cunning death does know
A thousand tricks man's life to overthrow,
But none more grievous than infectious air,
Which lies waste this Fabric every where;
Then fainting brooks with Lethes streams do flow,
Clouds big with death abroad do poison blow;
When men and beasts mortality do breath,
And beasts for dew, from grass do lick their death:
Heaven raines infection, sudden death does fall
Like Manna, meat's made poison, honey gall.
It rages most against men, as we have seen,
Who of this evil partakers late have been;
When raging in this land both night and day,
It did not tithe, but sweep whole towns away;
As thou (alas) fair London well can tell,
How thou Thames river with thy tears did swell;
They could declare, whom sepulchers cannot
Contain, nor yet have past in Charons boat;
The Plague more grievous is then death, no wits
Can ere devise more fearful looks and fits;
A heavy languor does their spirits tire,
Their eyes with flames, their faces burn with fire;
A scorching vapor does their head possess;
The sore bursts forth; their eyes with stupidnesse
Do stare; their nostrils drop with filthy gore;
Their ears do tingle, and their grief is more:
Their bowels like to burst with sighs and mones,
Draw from their inward parts most grievous groans,
Their tongues swell in their throats, and thirst them kills,
They grasp cold stones, when they have their wills:
Black wheales arising give a certain token,
That now their fatal thread of life is broken.
No mortal evil like this Pandora brought,
Nor such disease stepmother Nature wrought:
The double-headed serpent with his sting,
Nor sandy viper, can such venime bring,
Nor Scytale, whose back's like glistring gold,
Nor thirsty Snake, nor Salamander cold,
Nor rotting Horn* worn, nor the Scorpions tail,
Nor Toade, nor wide*mouth'd serpent so prevail,
Nor Africks Aspe nor Basiliske, who sees
A far and kills with poison of his eyes,
Good God, do banish such a curse away,
That friends, their friends in sickness comfort may.
How many in the Oceans bottom lie,
Or else by love, or wars revenge, do dye?
O brittle, frail, uncertain life, undone
By thousand evils, and yet not match to one!
Shall fury of Heaven, of Sea, and Land this blow,
And winds concur a bubble to overthrow.
So when the soul the body does forsake
And can it self to fyrie heaven betake,
Happy that after labors it can go
To Heavens eternal mansions from below,
TO enjoy the pleasures of eternal rest,
With triumphs amongst the Angels to be blessed;
Happy who after so uncertain chance
Can safely to the haven of Heavens advance.
Perhaps the body has become a prey
To beasts, or in the air does rot away,
Or feeds the vultures, or by cruel fate,
To greedy fishes has become a bate:
Few to their mothers belly do return,
And few are laid on sav'ry piles to burn,
For whom old women sing a mourning song;
None besides those, who dye their friends among,
Whose kinsmen dear their dying eyes do shut,
And from their beds them in a coffing put.
So when the soul has parted clean away
And left the body like a lump of clay:
The carcass is not colder then the love
Of wife and friends, who do unconstant prove.
The heir in mourning weeds looks very fine,
He maskes his joy, and thanks the fates divine,
And nature, that his gray-hayr'd father's gone,
And he of all his bags left heir alone:
He joys to see the treasures newly found,
The more he sees, his sighs more softly sound:
The dead is sacrificed on the shrine,
Of Proserpine, the heir says, All is mine:
And 'cause he cannot go, he is carried forth
Accompanied with all his friends of worth:
His trophies fly abroad, and martial arms,
And warlike trumpets whisper sad alarmes.
Hyr'd mourners show his years, the pomp so brave,
Convoy him to his cold and sad like grave:
But when they come to deaths pale habitation
And see the pit which gapes with desolation,
They throw the naked coffing in; of all
His friends, not one for love will with him fall:
All gets them gone, he still alone does lie,
Rottenness, worms bate, tale of mortality.
Resurgent.

All shall arise.



February, or Epitaphs, which may be termed Februa, celebrated for the memory
of certain souls.
Epitaph of Adam the first father of mankind.
I First of mankind, made by power divine,
Immortal once, brought death on me and mine.
Alone I stood, but married, I became
Cursed, as likewise cursed was my dame.
I sinned first, but not alone, my brood
Were one with me, whether I fell or stood.
Salvation first was preached to me, as I
By faith, so may my offspring come thereby.
Of Methusalem the longest liver of mankind.
I Am he, whom all for age do wonder at,
Whose minutes fixed stars scarce calculate:
If of the sea, an hour glass you should make,
Each hour of mine each drop of sea could take;
How many waves in Sea can you devise,
As I have seen Suns from the Sea arise?
Oftener than once the Phoenix I have known,
From spycie cradles freshly to have flowne:
Oaks and their off springs offspring I did see
Decayed with fatal years antiquity:
I thought I could not dye; but death me told,
That dye I must, though I were never so old:
This comforts me, the longer I did live,
The fates the shorter sleep of death shall give.
Of Abraham, the Father of the Faithful.
WHen hope of issue now was all forlorn,
And Sara laughed God of Heaven to scorn,
She straight brought forth, and me a Father made,
Cause I believed what Almighty said;
The child the hope was of posterity,
Which to the stars of Heaven should equal be;
God bid me sacrifice this only Son,
My will h' accepted, as it had been done.
Tell me, was not this constant faith in me,
To look for fruits and yet to burn the tree?
So by one Son, I was made father then
Of Israel, and of all faithful men:
As I, so shall my offspring travlers be
On earth, until their Country Heaven they see.
Of Sampson the strongest judge of Israel.
A Nazarite from the womb, God did me call,
My mother did not taste of wine at all;
The Mighty Judge of Israel, and the fell
Revenge of Philistimes, as well could tell,
My rivales, whom I quickly did confound,
The Corn which fiery foxes burnt on ground,
Those whom I killed with jaw bone of an ass,
Which in my deadly thirst my fountain was:
So Gaza's gates my strength did testify,
The withes, ropes, web, which I broke easily:
Yet all this strength a silly woman could
Undo, seduced with foes-briding gold.
Of David the most holy King of Israel.
I The sweet singer once in Israel
Who loved these songs, which liked Almighty well,
Who danced before the Arc in peoples sight,
Accounted therefore by my Michal light:
I made Harp, Timbrell, Lute, my whole delight,
Heavens harmony, my joy both day and night;
Yet sometimes on my couch these joys did turn,
In floods of tears, and I did sadly mourn:
As in all things, so in the godly heart
Sorrow and joy by course do play their part;
Sometimes the heart is calm and sweetly still,
When God the soul does with his presence fill*
Sometimes in deadly sorrow it is drowned,
And then no gracious presence can be found.
Be not cast down good soul, how e're it go;
If thou be sad, it shall not still be so.
Of Absalom the fairest of Israel.
THou Absalom great Isreal's beauty rare.
What did avail thy shape, and feature fair,
What profit made thy locks and weighty hair,
Thy eyes with which the stars could well compare;
Thy comely cheeks, thy lips vermilion red,
As lillies do decore the roses bed,
Thy ivory shoulders and thy snow-white neck,
Thy youthful grace which did thy body deck;
Thy dainty arms with their embracements sweet,
Thy body without blemish all complete?
If now reproachful vice does brand thy fame,
And lewdness of thy life disgrace thy name.
The virtue of the mind thou should have sought,
For beauty, without that, is painting thought.
Of Solomon the wisest and richest King of Israel.
I Once the Solomon, who did excel
In wit, in riches had no parallel,
Who did from Cedars to the Ivy know,
Whose plenteous silver did like slaitestones go,
Whose glorious fame a Queen brought from the South,
That she a witness might be of the truth.
She came, and saw, and wonderd, and did say,
That those were happy, who did with me stay,
I had alone, which all their own do call,
Riches, and honor, pleasure, I had all:
Yet I did find all under Sun to be
Mortal, frail, brittle, and but vanity.
