Courant News out of Italy, Germany, Bohemia, Poland, etc.
From Room the 12. of Iunij, 1621.
THe Pope has prepared for the Emperors Majesty a Regiment of Footmen and
300 Horses / which Monsieur Aldebrandino shall bring into Germany / which the
Pope will maintain his self. The Ambassadors of Venice are departed from hence
homewardes with good satisfaction and fair gifts.

From Venize the 18. hereof.
At Milanen are more Men taken on / and the Spaniards fortify the place in
Veltlin again very stronglye / which does not give any expectation of
restitution.

The Duke of Savoy has mustered his footmen and Horsemen.

From Constantinople is confirmed / that a very great sort of men go for
Polen and Hungary.

We hear from Milanen / notwithstanding commandment is come from Spain
twyse to restitute Veltlin / yet the Governor does to the contrary / sending
many men thither. The Archduke Leopold does the like / because that a while
agone 14. Companyes of Switsers are fallen into some part / beeinge under the
Commandment of the Duke of Austria / and burnt an Abbye / which does keep
back the restitution yet the Spainyards must give it again at last. They are
very much discontented / because the Duke of Savoy has mustered so many Men
/ wherein they can not tell what his intention is.

We hear from Constantinople / that the Great Turk with his principal
Officers are broken up and gone to Adrianopel / and conducted by a great sort
of Ianitsers and Iagy / his men of War should be (besides the Tartars)
300000. strong / he has taken out of the Tresurye with him 4. Milisns
Soltanini / for to pay his Men he has also given his General of the Sea
400000. Soltanini. Who is gone with 70 ships in the black Sea / for to keep
the Cossacks back / who did threatten to com to Constantinople with their
Gallyes. We hear in other Letters: That the Great Turk will send 150000. Men
in Polen / and 100000. in the Moldou / leavinge the Castles in Hungary well
provided for defense.

With the Fortress Nieuheusel it does stand in former estate / it is wholly
besieged / but they lie yet so far from it / that no piece of Ordnance can
reach it. This day there are sent more Cannons and Munition thither. In the
mean time Bucquoy makes certain thousands of Cannonbaskets for defense / to
shoot at Nieuheusel. The Soldiers of the Emperor show themselves here very
unwilling / because of bad payement. And a certain time agone / are the 4000.
Hungarians / which Betlem Gabor had sent with Monnye and Munition for the
assistance of Nieuheusel / by the Soldiers of the General Filleck / and
Setschi unawares fallen upon / beaten / and taken from them (among other
things) 25000 Dallers / whereupon they of Nieuheuse^ fall daily our / and take
many Horses and people imprisoned. They have also some days past driven the
Lord General of Diepenbach wholly out of his quarter / so that the getting of
this Fortress may cost many a head / here goes also a speech that there
shall be some suspected persons imprisoned.

From Vienna the 17. of Iuny.
In Hungaria on this and other side of the Donau it does stand in former estate
/ and we hope that Papa will give themselves over to the Emperors Majesty /
yet the Budian tarryeth by his former meaning / Berlem has sent some
Horsemenne and Footemenne / with some monny and munition / which the Liutenant
at Filleck Stesfen Heret shin perceiving / has with a Company of men from the
Fronters / and Setschi met them / and by Rimatumbat fallen upon them / fought
against them / and driven them away.

At this present Burquoy shootes at Nieuheusel strongly in two places / and it
continues that they of our side have lost before it (besides the Bagage)
already 900. Men.

Upon the 5. of July should the Emper. Maj. travel to Prague.

From Breslaw, the 18. hereof.
Notwithstanding the Marckgrave of Iagersdorp and his Soldiers have received
their pay of the Lords / Princes / and States / yet he seeks all manner of
shifts for to keep the Soldiers together / and under his Government / he
has some days past besieged that Bisshoply Castle at Neus with his Soldiers
/ and demanded of the Administrators / Chief Counsel and commontye / that they
should swear unto him / he does not suffer any goods / monny / neither any
thing else to be carried our from thence. The young Earl of Thurn is with his
Wife by him / and a speech goes that the General Stubenval will join
himself with his Moravish Soldiers to the Marckgrave.

We hear from Horn: That the Turks are gotten within some twentye miles to
Lublin / and that the Poles have had two overthrowes / whereupon the King has
caused the Crown to be carried from Cracou.

The Polish Lords / which dwell in Colmisschen have carried their best goods
into the Dukeship of Pruissen. And there is great fear in that Land / because
there are no strong places / therefore Warschou shall be fortified.

The Duke Elector of Brandenburgh is celebrated Duke of Pruissen / through the
Kings Commissioners upon the 29 of May / and the whole Land of Pruissen is
commanded to acknowledge him for there Prince.

From Prage the 17. hereof.
Here are again some more pieces of Ordinance caused to be fetched out of the
Magazin / and brought into diverse places of the Castle / the same shall also be
done in the City / the reason is / because they fear for an uprore when the
execution shall be. In like manner the General Sassers Horsemenne are arived
here / being 7. Companies strong / well Armed Men / alone they have no long
gunnes or Carbyners / they are inquartered in the old and new city / it is
said / that the Execution shall be upon Monday or Tuesday next / which being
ended the Emperors Commissioners shall go from hence into Moravia / and there
do the like Execution.

The Spanish Soldiers in Moravia do Tyrannize very much over the Citizens
and Inhabitants.

The Soldiers / which lie here / would yester night have saccaged the Jews
City (or that part of Prague / wherein the Jews dwell) but an Agreement is
made / and the Jews must give the Governor of Walsteyn a great some of Money.

The Governor French goes daily here up and down / without any watch / he
will set our an Apology against Mansvelt.

The speech goes that the Earl of Mansvelt is broken up with his Soldiers
against the Bavarians / whether he will onsett Tabor or no is yet unknow it.

The Marckgrave of I^gersdory is also retired back into Bohemia / and taken in
the Lordship Nachot / as the speech goes.

From Bunten, the 15 hereof.
Although those of Zurich were expecting their Folk again every hour / but
it is happened that the passage is onexpected taken from them / by 900. well
mounted Spaniards / the which arrived at Meyeubelt by 1 or 2 at a time / so
that there is little hope of a peace.

From Lints the 20. hereof.
The Governor of Munchen is arived here again within these few days /
whereupon the 16. of this present the 2. Lords of Sternbergh Brothers / 2 Lords
of Geil / Brothers / and the old Lord Governor Heger / are all set at
liberty from their arestment / but how others shall speed time will reveal.

Fom Egher the 21 of June.
The Bavarian Soldiers / which have layen in Conincksweert / Slackewalt / and
other places are all march to Tachou / the Bavarians and the Earl of
Malnsvelts Soldiers rove daily one against another / like as they did a
quarter of a league from Bleyensteyn upon the 18. of this present / falling the
one upon the other / and a long while Scher^nidged together / where in 300. of
the Baverians were slain and 100 of the Mansvelts Soldiers.

From Newmark the 24. of Iuny.
Here are 700 Horsemen inquartered / which are come from the Onder-Pals / and
arrived at Pleynvelt / Ollinge and other places / where they hold but bad hause
with saccaging and evil doings they should join with the Earl of Mansvelt /
who is broken up and in marching / fell upon 3. Cornets of Bavarish Horsemen /
and slew almost all of them.

From Straesburgh the 21. hereof.
Here pass many Frenchmen daily / through this City to the King of
France / whom the Duke of Bavaria has casshierd.

From the Palts the 25. of Iuny.
The Baron Digby / English Ambassador / has taken his way through Cruytsnach
and Frankendall / and the other night lodged at Spier / he has reasonable good
store of Baggadge with him / wherefore he makes but reasonable have / we hope
that he will effect some good matters at Weenen.

From Ments the 26. dito.
The Spaniards have burnt down to the ground the market-towne Albech by
Altzey / 2. days agone / because the Country men had slain 3. Spaniards.

The speech goes that the Emper. should have given the Electorship to the Duke
of Bavaria / who thereupon caused him to be pictured in his Electoriall Habit:
Wherefore it is thought that the Ambassador of the Kings Majesty of Great
Brittaigne will effectuate little / because his Majesty will never suffer that
/ and therefore for these and other such like matters the wars might begin
again in Germany.

News from France mentions / that the City S. Ieand Angely is yet
besiedged / and that those within had done some outfalles upon the Kings Host
/ and done them great hurt / so that some certain 100. Soldiers were slain /
where under were many persons of great Dignity.

News from Flaunders mentions that some certain mutinierde Soldiers of the
Archduke have burnt two fair Villages.

At Wesel was provision made to bake for a Camp / to have all Bread a forehand
