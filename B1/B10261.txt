An exhortation to his Dearly beloved Countrymen, all the Natives of the
County of Lanenster, inhabiting in and about the City of London; tending to
persuade and stir them up to a yearly contribution, for the erecting of
Lectures, and maintaining of some godly and painful preachers in such places
of that Country as have most need, by reason of ignorance and superstition
there abounding: composed by George Walker Pastor of St. John the Evangelists
in Watlingstreet in LONDON.
MY dear and loving Countrymen, whom God by his gracious providence has
together with my self, transplanted out of our native Country the County of
Lancaster, (which, as it is at this day, so has much more in the days of our
youth and within our memory, been as a rough, untilled barren desert,
overrun with ignorance, superstition and popery) and has planted us by the
waters of comfort in a wealthy and fruitful place, where all blessings
needful for soul and body are extended unto us as a flowing stream: Isai
66.12. Luke 12.48.
you are not ignorant of that saying of our Savior, That to whom much is
given, of them much shall be required: yea I doubt not but ye have all learned
this lesson; that as God after grear deliverance from great evils, dangers and
miseries requires much thankfulness to himself at the hands of the delivered:
so also much compassion toward their brethren, who still remain in the same
miseries and dangers, and a readiness to help and succor them upon every
occasion and opportunity which shall be offered. This our Savior teaches us
by his example and continual practice, in that he is touched with our
infirmities, and by the things which he suffered being tempted, Heb. 4.15. and
2, 18.
is become a merciful high Priest able and ready to succor them that are
tempted: And this he enjoynes us all to put in practice, in that charge which
he gave to his Apostle? when thou are converted strengthen thy brethren. Luke.
22.32. John 13.17.
Now my brethren if ye know these things, happy and blessed shall you be if ye
also do them, as our Savior affirms in the Gospel. And that you may by so
doing obtain more easily this happiness and blessedness: lo here I will show
you a short cut and a ready way, even one only work of piety and charity which
I will commend unto you, in which work alone (if you shall wisely and
conscionably begin it, and therein carefully, cheerfully and constantly proceed
and continue to the end according to that ability which God has given to you)
ye shall at once perform all these works and duties of Christianity; that
is, you shall render and return unto God increase and fruit according to the
talents which he has committed to your trust, and the seed and cost of
planting and tilling which he has on you bestowed; you shall offer up to his
majesty a most acceptable sacrifice of thankfulness for his deliverance of
your souls from dangers of ignorance, superstition and profaneness which
ouer-spread the place of your nativity, and withal you shall show all
Christian compassion, and exerci^e brotherly charity and commiseration rowards
your brethren and Country, and by Gods grace and blessing on your endeavors,
become powerful instruments and effectual means of saving many souls; Acts
28.18.
by turning them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God:
that they may become fellow Saints with your selves, Colloss. 1.12.
and coheires and partakers of the inheritance of glory in light.

This work (to describe and set it forth plainly in that nature as it is here
commended to you) is no more but a free, voluntary, cheerful and charitable
contribution of such yearly sums of money, as every one of you, by means of
that wealth and ability which God has bestowed upon him, may very well without
impouerishing, pinching, or any way ouercharging of himself, or impairing of
his estate, bestow for the maintaining of godly, painful and profitable
preachers of Gods word in those parrs and parishes of our native Country of
Lancashire, in which ^^ere is found to be greatest need, and most grievous want
and scarsity of preaching, and maintenance for preachers; that by their
continual labors, zealous preaching and conscionable pains, ignorance and
superstition may be rooted out, true religion planted, Gods true worship set up
and established, and that by the converting of many souls, and instructing and
consirming the weak, Gods true Church may there increase and flourish, and so
that Country which is now in many places like a barren wilderness, may become
a fruitful garden and pleasant vineyard of the Lord of hosts, well watered
with plentiful showers of Gods heavenly and spiritual graces distilling from
heaven, and with fountains, springs and flowing streams of earthly and
temporal blessings, which follow and accompany the public enterteinment of
the Gospel, and the advancement of Christ's true Church in every land.

This work (if we should seek no further but look upon it, and take a view
of it in it self, as it is here in plain words propounded to us) has in it
motives sufficient of all sorts to draw us, and move us to put it in present
practice.

First, whereas in many other works of bounty and liberality, grace and
nature are sound contrary, and while the one persuades us to do them, the
other disswades us from them; as for example, in the purchasing of great
houses, lands and revenues for our children, while natural affection does
incite us to disburse great sums, and to employ all out wealth and estate;
Grace on the contrary forbids us to spend all on our children and fleshly
kindred, which perhaps may prove wicked prodigalls, and abuse our riches to
sin and mischief, and tells us that we ought rather to honor God with our
wealth, by spending a great part there of in works of piety and charity upon
the poor members of Christ: And while Grace draws us to this, natural
affection does draw and pull us from it, unto the other. Now in this work here
commended to you there is no such opposition between grace and nature, nor any
such cause of distraction, but both together do draw, pull and allure us with
joint forces: Grace tells us that this being a work of pity tending to Gods
glory by the saving of many souls, the increase of his Church, and advancement
of true religion and his holy worship, no good Christian can refuse to put
his hand unto it; but every one ought to be, and will be forward in it. And
because this work is also a work of charity not toward strangers; but
toward our Countrymen and kindred according to the flesh, even toward our own
brethren, and tends to this as one maine end to make our native Country blessed
with all blessings heavenly and earthly; therefore natural affection does
strongly and vehemently pull us and persuade us unto it, and as we all
naturally love our Country and kindred; so we cannot but by the instinct of
nature be forward in this work.

Secondly, this contribution is not like those antique taxes, which heathen
Emperors, tyrants rather, used by their constraining commandments, and with
strong hand to wrest from their euer-awed and impotent vassals; nor like the
rigid penance and grievous penalties, which Popish Priests and confessors do
often times inflict on their penitents as a satisfaction for their sins;
which either are above the strength of their bodies, and tend to the
endangering of their health and life, or surpass their abilities and estates,
and do far ouer-charge and much impouerish them; but this is only of so
much as the spirit of God shall inwardly move and persuade every man to give
freely and cheerfully with all alacrity, and which God has enabled him to
give without impouerishing of himself, or weakening and impairing of his
estate, and which may well be spared from other vain expenses and needless
superfluities: so that here is no coulout of exception against this
contribution, no least cause for any to complain, grudge or murmr against
it, or to count it a burden: here is nothing required of any but what he is
able and willing to do, and that without any wrong, loss or damage to
himself at all.

Thirdly, this work is not one of those almsdeeds and works of charity
which are done in secret, which few see but God; this is a public work like a
candle upon a candle stick which gives light to all the house, besides the
profit and comfort which it may bring to many and several particular souls,
and the gracious acceptance and bountiful reward which it may find with God;
it shall undoubtedly also bring great glory to Gods name, and be a means of
many thanks given by many unto God in his public Church and congregation.
And as the multitude of them who receive the benefit of this contribution,
shall have just cause to laud and praise God continually: so many others, even
all they who see it a far of and hear the fame and report of it, shall be
provoked and stirred up by your example; and hereby you shall cause your lights
to shine before men, that they seeing your good works, may glorify your
father which is in heaven, as our Savior in the Gospel exhorts. And whereas
in other cases a work of piety tending to the public good cannot be done
without great cost and charge, and requires a great sum: here in this
contribution every particular man may for a small oblation offered up with a
free heart obtain the honor, and gain the glory of a public work, and
become an example and pattern of piety to many others, and so bring great
glory to God, and much benefit to the Church of Christ, with small charge to
himself by reason of many hearts and hands conspiring together in this one
work.

Fourthly, in many other works of piety and charity, there are many doubts
and discouragements often times; as for example, when a man must lay out a
great sum, either upon a great hazard and adventure, being uncertain whether
it shall take good effect, and yield any fruit at all to himself or those to
whom he does intend it; as we see in many hospitalls and Colleges much subject
to abuse; the cost bestowed upon which is like bread cast upon the waters,
only in hope of finding it after many days as wise Solomon speaks, Eccles.
11.1. Or when much is given away by men at their death in their last will to
pious uses, of which they themselves being dead, can reap no benefit at all
from the prayers of the poor who enjoy it, as blind Papists would persuade the
world; nor any comfort from the sight of the good fruit which it yields to
posterity. But here in this contribution there is no such cause of doubting,
nor any such scruple to dishearten any man: here is no great sum to be
adventured or put forth upon uncertainties; but a small yearly bencuolence to
be paid quarterly, and continued so long only as it shall manifestly appear, to
be well employed to good purpose and for present profit, which payment also
every man shall have in his power for his own part to cease break off and
discontinue, if he does see no manifest benefit thence presently arising
according to his desire; but if it does take good effect, it shall much advance
Gods glory before men, bring comfort, light and saving health to many souls,
and procure to the contributors many hearty prayers of their Countrymen, who
shall by this means be converted and comforted; which prayers undoubtedly God
will hear and accept, and at their request turn many blessings into their
bosoms here in this life, where only the prayers and thanksgiving of Gods
people, have power to help and profit those for whom they are made and offered
up in the name and mediation of Christ.

Fifthly, whosoever has a desire to put forth his talent of worldly wealth
whatsoever it is more or less to the best advantage, and so to employ it that
it may bring in double and trible gain, surely he cannot find a better way
then this pious work which is here commended unto you. For the first and
immediate end of this contribution is the setting up and maintaining of godly,
painful and profitable preachers of Gods word in those parts of our native
Country, where the word of God is most rare and precious, and there is greatest
need and scarsitie of preaching. We do not mean to feed idle droanes, who
will labor but little, and look for large allowance; nor such as will labor
and take pains but to small profit, for want of the art of prophesying, and
method of profitable preaching; nor men of scandalous and ungodly life, who
will do more hurt by their example, then good by their doctrine: But godly,
painful and profitable preachers, who will preach and teach, and labor out
of conscience to God, with an hungring and thirsting desire, not to get wealth
and maintenance, but to save many souls, and to increase the Church of Christ,
who also for a small stipend will take much pains, and will teach as well by
good example, as by doctrine. Now where such preachers are set up and
maintained, there will follow plentiful preaching and hearing of the word of
God, the word heard will beget faith, and bring many to believe in God and in
Christ; faith will bring forth the the true worship of God, and holy invocation
or calling upon his name; and true, devout and faithful calling upon the name
of the Lord, is the sure way to salvation, as may easily be gathered from the
words of the holy Apostle, Romans 10.13, 14, 15. But especially when such
preachers are sent into barren places, and among a people overrun with
ignorance, superstition and profanesse for want of instruction, as in our
native Country; they do more prevail with their godly labors, and bring more
plentiful fruit, and increase to Gods Church in one year, and work more
strange effects by turning many souls from darkness to light, from profanesse
to piety, from ignorance and superstition, to the saving knowledge and true
worship of God, and from the slavery and power of Satan, unto the glorious
liberty of Gods children, as experience in some parts of our Country has of
late proved; then many others as worthy and well quallified as they, or they
themselves are able to do in these parts where the light of the Gospel has
shined from the days of our forefathers. For as it is with untilled ground,
ouer-growne with briets, weeds and thorns; the first years plowing, sowing
and manuring of it, does work a greater and more visible change from
barrenness to fruitfulness, then all plowing and manuring can do in ground
well tilled before, because that only continues and increases the old, does
not beget new fruitfulness: (...) it is with a people when the word is sent
first among them; If it does prevail with them at all, and if they do not
utterly reject, but cheerfully receive it, they are more visibly changed from
profanesse and superstition, to piety and profession of true religion in the
first year, then in a long time and many years after, so that both the
preachers which labor among them, and the godly contributors who set them up
and maintain them, may behold with joy and gladness of heart abundance of
present fruit and increase arising from small cost and labor, which is a
strong motive and encouragement to all Christians thus to employ their talents
which God has committed to them, and to show and exercise their charity and
piety in this kind. To all these spiritual motives and in couragements arising
from spiritual in crease, profit and benefit, we may add the multitude and
abundance of temporal blessings and benefits which the Gospel brings with it
to the Country and people, among whom it is generally and with public consent
received and embraced; For experience has taught the world in all ages, that
as the heat and light of the Sun accompanied with watering showers of rain
and dew, do make the earth fruitful in corn, wine, oil, and all other
fruits which are required either for the profit and benefit, or for the
pleasure and delight of man: So the light of the Gospel working the heat of
true zeal in the hearts of a people, and drawing from them the tears of true
repentance, and causing many such showers of heavenly moisture to distill from
their eyes; never has failed, but in all ages has brought all store even of
earthly blessings with it, and made Gods Saints and people honorable,
renowned, and of high esteem, for their worldly greatness, wealth and
prosperity in the eyes of the heathen nations among whom they have lived. This
was that which made religious and upright Noah not only the heir of the
righteousness which is by faith, but also brought temporal deliverance, and
bodily safety to him and his family, in the universal deluge and destruction
of the old world, and made him and his sons the repairers of mankind, and the
builders of the new world which followed, as the Apostle has observed Heb.
11.7. This made Melchisedek the Priest and sacrificer of the high God, to live
and reign a King of peace in all plenty and prosperity in the midst of the
wicked Canaanites, while all the bordering Kings and neighbors were overrun
with the calamities of war, and oppressed with the heavy yoke and bondage
under Chedarlaomer, and other foreign tyrants as we may read Genesis 14. This
made Abraham, the father of the faithful, and Isaae his son the heir of
promise, so to prosper and flourish in all prosperity, wealth and riches, that
the heathen nations among whom they sojourned as strangers, did esteem and
style them Princes of God; and potent Kings sought unto them to enter into a
league and oath of amity with them, as appears Genesis 13.2, 6. and 21.22. and 23
6. and 26.28. This made Jacob who fled over Jordan to his uncle Laban with a
staff in his hand, so to grow, increase and prosper, that he returned with
oxen, asses, flocks, man-seruants and women-seruants, wives and children, which
made up two troops or bands as he himself confesses to the glory of God that
gave them: Genesis 32.5.10. This made Joseph to prosper even in all worldly
affairs, and all things whereunto he put his hand, Genesis 39.2.3.23. This
brought all blessings of victory over enemies abroad, and of peace and plenty
at home, with all honor, fame and renown, to David, Hezechiah, Josiah and
other religious Kings of Israel and Judah; who received and believed the word
of God, and obeyed it with all their hearts. And that large promise which God
made to Joshua the first Judge and ruler over Israel after Moses, viz. that of
he would religiously obey his word and law, not turning from it to the right
hand or the left; he should certainly prosper whithersoeuer he did go; and in
all things have good success: Josh. 1.7, 8 that same he actually performed,
verified and made good not only to him, and to all the people of Israel in
his days: but also to all the godly and religious Judges which succeeded him,
and to the whole nation of the children of Israel under their government, as
appears Judge. 2.18. And least any should think that these examples recorded
in Scripture were extraordinary and miraculous; we have also experience of the
like in all ages, and even in this age, and in this land wherein we live. For
notwithstanding all the Popes curses and thunderbolts, and all the open
assaults which he has made, and the secret conspiracy which he has put in
practice against this land, incensing and stirring up all his instruments of
violence and cruelty against it, yet both in the days of King Edward and of
Queen Elizabeth of blessed memory, who reformed religion, and maintained the
true preaching of the Gospel by public authority; this Land and Church has
prospered and flourished, and in all worldly peace, plenty and prosperity
excelled all other nations and Churches of the world. So that we may all upon
good experience with one mouth confess, that true religion and the holy
Gospel of Christ, which we have received and lodged in this land under the
reign of our later Kings have proved most profitable guests unto us; they have
over and above the abundance of heavenly knowledge, and saving graces which
belong to eternal salvation, out of their more then Kingly bounty royally paid
us with all safety, security, peace, prosperity and plenty of all worldly
blessings: yea we have plain promises and testimonies in the sacred
Scriptures, that thus it shall be to all people of all nations, who receive and
embrace the Gospel in syncerity and truth, and profess true religion without
hypocrisy. Our Savior in the Gospel promises, that if any seek first the
kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, they shall have all other
worldly blessings, (which the Gentiles so carefully seek) over and above added
unto them: Matthew. 6.33. And in another place he promises to such as renounce
and forsake the things of this world for his sake and for love to the Gospel,
that they shall receive (be sides life everlasting in the world to come) an
hundr^th-fold more even of these earthly blessings h^re in this life: Mark.
10.30. To which purpose we have a most clear restimonie of the holy Apostle
Saint Paut a Tim. 4.8. where he says, that godliness is profitable unto all
things having promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to
come. Upon these sure and infallible grounds both of holy Scripture and common
experience, I dare be bold to assure you (my dear Countri-men) that if you
heartily and vnseinedly desire to see your native Country and kindred flourish
in all worldly wealth and earthly prosperity, you cannot for the obteining of
your desire in all the world find a more ready way, then this work of piety
which I here commend unto you, which as it tends first to plant the Gospel and
true religion, so it will draw on all other blessings by means of them.

Besides these motives which arise from the consideration of the work it
self, our native Country also, and the nature and disposition of the people
for whose use and benefit this work is intended, do moreover afford and offer
unto us many strong encouragements. For we are not to deal with a stubborn,
brutish ill natured people like the wild Irish, who naturally abhor all
ciuility, and are so deuo^ed to their own old fashions, that things which in
themselves are most reasonable, decent and orderly, they do utterly detest if
they appear to swerue from the corrupt and abominable customs of their
Country, and the traditions of their fathers: The people of our native Country
are generally of another constitution, and of a contrary but far better
natural disposition; although they are most constant in their resolutions,
while they conceive and imagine them to be just, good and godly, and do follow
that course of religion and life, which they have embraced for the best with
strong affection and zeal; yet naturally they are so ingenious, and so
reasonable and tractable, that when good reason is showed to them for the
contrary, they are ready as to conceive and understand it, so to yield unto it
generally and for the most part: (only some desperate reprobates, and
refractarie rebels excepted, whom God for their wilful rejecting of the
truth, has given over to be blinded and bewitched by the delusion and
enchantments of Popish Priests and Jesuits, and to be possessed by their
diabolical spirit.) And (if we may give credit to the learned historiographers
who have narrowly searched, and taken a diligent survey of all the shires of
this Kingdom, and observed and noted in their public records and writings the
manners of the people) as the inhabitants of our Country of Lancashire are in
bodily feature and outward form generally more beautiful and comely, then in
many other Countries; so in respect of the inward disposition of their minds
they are every way answerable, that it is a people of good understanding,
quick of apprehension, well tempered in their wills and affections, and ready
to be ruled by reason: So that if any shall object against this our good
motion, and oppose as a bar or obstacle against it the blind zeal and
headstrong affection, wherewith a great part of our native Country, and many
of our people in diverse parts thereof are carried away from the truth and true
religion, after Popish superstition and Idolatry; and shall from thence
conclude, that in all likeli-hood and probability, our contribution of money,
and the labors of our preachers shall be spent in vain, and for no profit, on a
refractarie and obstinate people, who like deaf adders will stop their ears,
and refuse to hear the voice of the charmers, charm they never so wisely, as
they have done heretofore ever since the first reviving of the Gospel and
reformation of religion in this Kingdom: I will answer, that this which is
objected as a bar or impediment, is indeed none all to such as rightly
understand and consider it; but on the contrary offers to our consideration
special encouragements and motives to further us in this work. For first,
true Christianity teaches us to show mercy and charity to our brethren in
misery and bondage, and the greater we perceive that their danger and misery
is wherein they remain, the more to be^ moved inwardly with pity and
compassion toward them, and rather then we will in dure the ^ight of their
continual extremities, to make a desperate attempt for their deliverance, and
to adventure upon a great hazard even when there is little or no hope of their
recovery in outward appearance. We have many examples of Gods faithful Saints
recorded in the Scripture^ to this purpose: The penitent Israelites captiued in
Babylon, so often and so long as they remembered Zious desolation, and the
deplored estate of their native Country, could joy in nothing, but spent their
time in weeping and in studying the good and prosperity of Jerusalem: Psalm.
137. Queen Hester when her people the Jews were in extreme danger, by reason
of a Commission or warrant sealed for the general massacre and destruction of
them all, did run in a desperate hazard even of her own life, and resolved for
their deliverance to attempt the recalling of the Kings unchangeable decree,
saying, If I perish, I perish: Hest: 4.16. And godly Nehemiah, when he had
received intelligence of the great affliction and reproach of his brethren in
Indea after their return from captivity, and of the City and place of his
fathers sepulcher lying wast and consumed with fire, was so sad and heavy, that
he could not rest nor look cheerfully on the King his Lord, until by earnest
prayer to God and petition to the King, he had prevailed and gotten leave to
go with a large commission for the repairing of Jerusalem: Nehem. 1 and 2.
Saint Paul the more stiff-necked that he found the Jews, and the more zealous
with blind zeal not according to knowledge, the more he pitied them being his
Countrymen, and the more he labored by all means to win them, and sought to
save some of them though it were with the loss of his own life, as appears
Act. 24.17. Romans 9.1, 2. And he who is the example of all examples, and the
pattern whom all Christians are bound to follow, our Lord and Savior Christ,
when we all were in a desperate and woeful condition by means of our sinful
corruption and many sins rebelliously committed against God, from which the
whole world was not able to redeem us, did not cast us off, but undertook a
work for us, and did undergo a burden under which all the Angels of God, and
all creatures would faint, fail and sink down if it were laid upon them. And
therefore as we desire to walk in the ways of Gods Saint, and to conform our
selves to our head Christ: so let the great danger of our native Country and
Countrymen in which they lie, and the slavish superstition and blindness by
which their souls as well as their bodies are held in captivity under the
Pope and the Devil, stir us up to use this and all other means which God
has revealed in his word, and experience of all ages has discourered to be
helpful remedies against all such maladies.

Secondly, If we examine the cause of this headstrong blind zeal which
ouer-spreades our Country, and take true notice of the means which maintain
this Popish superstition and ignorance in our people; they will appear to be
such as may justly more encourage us in this work, then any way dishearten or
discourage us from it. It is true that some places, Cities and Countries for
some notorious pollution are hated and cursed of God, and set apart to be
spectales of his wrathful vengeance, and examples of dreadful I desolation, as
the plain Country and Citries of Sodom and Gomorrha: And some people are
reprobates, whom God in his secret counsel has rejected, and therefore either
does withold from them all means of salvation, esteeming them like swine,
before whom he will not cast the precious pearls of his word and saraments at
all, as we have plain examples Act. 16. where the Spirit sorbad the Apostles,
and would not suffer them to go to preach in some Countries, and to some
people: or else does send his Gospel and the ministers of his word and
sacraments unto them, not for their good to convert them, but as a curse for
their greater condemnation to harden them, as his word and miracles by Moses
were sent to Pharaoh, Exodus 7.3. and to be unto them as the Gospel preached is
to perishing reprobates, even the savor of death unto death: 2 Cor. 2.16. Now
when and where ignorance, superstition and blind z^ale proceed from these
causes and grounds, they are desperate and incurable, and whatsoever cost or
labor is there bestowed proves vain, and is like water spilt on the ground.
But sometimes ignorance, blind zeal, superstition and idolatry are found to
ouer-spread some Countries, and strongly to possess some people through want
of means and good instruction, because God suffers his word and Gospel to be
withheld from them for a time, either through the malice and negligence of
their rulers and overseers, upon whom he has a purpose to execute his just
wrath to the full, by bringing upon them the blood of many poor souls which
through their default do perish; or else for to try, prove and exercise the
charity of their brethren and neighbors, who are called and converted already
before them, and have received grace to be Gods people, whom the Lord has a
purpose to provoke to pity and charity, by setting before them such examples
of miserable blindness, which have great need of their help and
commiseration: In these cases, the greatest ignorance, most blind superstition
and most headstrong zeal, standing for errors and a false religion, are not
desperate, but have great hope of cure by the word of God, and such means
applied to them; yea such headstrong, zealous and superstitious people, when
the true and clear light of the Gospel once shines unto them by means of an
able and powerful ministry, are by experience found to become no less, but
rather more zealous for the truth, and for God and godliness, then before they
have been for falsehood and errors. And that this is the very case and
condition of our native Country, and of our blind, zealous and superstitious
brethren and neighbors inhabiting, it appears plainly by two strong and
infallible arguments.

First, that their ignorance and blind zeal proceed from want of ordinary
means, to wit, the preaching of the word and good instruction, experience
plainly proves, and no man can with any color of reason deny: For although
our Country of Lancashire is one of the largest shires in this Kingdom, yet it
has for the public worship of God only thirty six Parish Churches within the
large circuit of it, as our histories show, and some Parishes forty miles in
compass to my knowledge, whereas some other shires not much larger then one
dinision or hundred of Lancashire, are known and recorded to have two or three
hundred Parish Churches in them, and those far better furnished with means
for maintenance of an able ministry then ours are: for example the hundred of
Fournesse where I was borne, which for spacious compass of ground is not much
less then Bedfordshire or Rutlandshire, it has only eight Parish Churches,
and seven of those eight are impropriate, and the livings in the hands of Lay
men, and in some of those Parishes which be forty miles in compass, there is
no more ordinary and set maintenance allowed for the ministry of the word and
sacraments, but ten pounds or twenty nobles yearly. And therefore though the
people were naturally the most tractable under the Sun, no man could in
reason look for any thing but abundance of ignorance ruling among them, till
it please God to stir up the public state, or the spirits of some godly
private Christians, to provide some maintenance for the constant ministry of
the word, to be set up and continued among them: yea (considering what large
spacious walks, and how many couerts and lurking places there are in those
thick mists and shades of ignorance and darkness for Jesuits and seminary
Priests those sons and ministers of darkness, who commonly find best
intertainment for their flattery and painted hypocrisy among such people, as
being naturally disposed to devotion and religion, are notwithstanding held
captive in ignorance for want of means: and also find most liberty and best
room to bestirre thmselues, and greatest freedom from discovery in those
Parishes, where there are no learned Preachers, nor vigilant Pastors:) let
reason judge how unlikely and almost impossible it is for that people to be
free from blind headstrong zeal, and that Popish superstition and Idolatry
should not generally possess them?

Secondly, as Saint Paul argues for the nation of the natural Israelites Romans
11.1. and proves that they were not utterly cast away of God, because he
himself and diverse others of them were gathered unto Christ by the Gospel,
and an elect remnant was found among them in the days of Christ and his
Apostles, when generally they persecuted the truth, and seemed to be most
opposite and stiffenecked: So we may much more and upon stronger grounds of
reason argue for our blind superstitious Countri-men, that they are not a
reprobate people, whom God has cast away, and given over to desperate
blindness and obstinacy, never to be converted; because not only we our
selves being many have by Gods grace extended plentifully unto us, received the
word, and do believe in Christ, and profess true Christianity; but also many
noble worthies have sprung up and flourished in the Church of God, and shined
as lights through this Kingdom, and the whole Christian world, who being borne
in our barren soil, and in their child-bood muzled up in superstition, so
soon as God brought them to the light of the Gospel in the universities, the
nurseries of learning and true religion, they became famous and renowned
professors of divinity, and most stout and strong maintainers of the truth
against Papists, and all other Heretics. I cannot pass by in silence, but
for example will name and mention with honor and reverence, that mirror of
learning and religion Doctor Whitakers our sometimes worthy professor in
Cambridge, whose name is still dreadful to our adversaries, and his writings
of greatest esteem even in foreign Countries at this day, and his memory
ever blessed: Yea we find by daily experience, that in those parishes and
places of our nature Country, which have heretofore been most grievously
overrun with ignorance and superstition, while they wanted the means of
knowledge the ministry of the word, and where the word at the first preaching
thereof has been strongly opposed; now by means of a constant ministry,
and powerful preaching continued among them, the people do become generally
so zealous for the truth, so fervent in their zeal, so forward in their
profession, so strict in their lives, and in the worship of God, so opposite to
all shadows of superstition, that some think they have more need of the bridle
then else spur; like the Israelites in the wilderness, who offered so
frankly and abundantly to the building of Gods tabernacle, that there was found
much more then enough for the service of the work, and Moses gave commandment,
and caused them by public proclamation to be restrained from bringing any
more, Exodus 36. I my self do know, and can name for instance if need
require, diverse parishes which within my memory, were deeply plunged in
superstition, and even drowned in ignorance, insomuch that the name of a
preacher was as much scorned of many, as the name of a babbler, and of some as
much hated as the name of an heretic; but now of late years I have seen
with mine eyes such a wonderful alteration wrought by Gods grace and blesing
accompanying the labors of some holy and godly preachers sent among them, that
they are ready and willing to run many miles to hear sermons, when they have
them not at home, and lay aside all care of worldly profit, leaving their
labor and work on week days, to frequent public meetings for prophecy and
expounding of Gods word, and hardly can a preacher travel through their
towns, and lodge there on any day in the week, but they will by importunity
obtain a public sermon from him, and in great troops suddenly and upon
short warning assembled, they will gladly and cheerfully hear him with all
reverence and attention. And therefore as St. Paul from his own example, and
the examples of a small remnant of believing Jews, who by so many miracles and
much powerful preaching of Christ himself, and his extraordinary Apostles
and Prophets were called and drawn to believe, did conclude that God had not
rejected and cast away the whole nation as reprobates past hope: So may we much
more strongly conclude, from the example of our selves who are many, and from
the example of those worthy professors and pillars of the Church, whom God has
raised up out of our Country by ordinary means, and most of all from the
great multitudes of godly Christians, who by hundreds and thousands are daily
called and turned by ordinary preaching from the darkness of ignorance, to
the light of true knowledge, and from blind zeal and love of popery and
superstition, to the fervent love of the truth, and zealous profession of the
holy Gospel of Christ: I say from these many examples, we may as upon stronger
grounds of reason conclude, that God has not cast away our people, nor
rejected our native Country, neither in so many places keeps his word from
them, as from a reprobate people never to be converted; but rather does suffer
them to live so long in ignorance and miserable blindness, partly for a
greater judgment on ouer-ruling Church-robbers, that he may bring on them and
their houses and families the blood of many souls, which perish through their
sacrilege and covetousness: and partly to provoke and stir up to pity and
charity, us, whom he has first converted, and to minister unto us matter of
true Christian charity, and to give us occasion to exercise that piety which we
profess, that our faith by lively fruits of good works, may be made to
appear more glorious to the eyes of the world, and may shine in the midst of
the Church, and among all the people of God.

Lastly, (Dear brethren and Countrymen) for our full persuasion and steadfast
assurance, that our native Country (notwithstanding the ignorance and
blindness ouershadowing it, and the blind superstition possessing the people
generally in diverse parts thereof) is a place, which God has chosen to put his
name there, and our brethren the inhabitants thereof are a people chosen of
God, and holy according to the election of grace; let us call to remembrance
and daily set before our eyes, what holy and excellent first fruits it has
brought forth unto God, I mean holy professors and martyrs in the first times
of the pure light of the Gospel beginning to shine forth in this land. Among
all godly martyrs wichin the days of King Edward the sixth, were great
builders of Gods Church by their sound doctrine, painful labors, and holy
lives, and in the bloody reign of Queen Mary, sealed the Gospel with their
blood, who more renowned in the history of martyrs, then Mr. John Bradford a
Lancashire man? whose godly writings and meditations able to make a stony
heart to bleed, remain to the profit and comfort of Gods Church in all
succeeding ages, whose constant profession of the true faith unto death, and in
the midst of the fire was admired of his enemies, and shall ever be remembered
while God has an elect and faithful people in this land, and whose memory
shall be blessed for ever. Among the godly, faithful and learned men, whom
this land brought forth in those first times, and which shined forth as lights
out of darkness, who after many cruel persecutions and banishment which they
endured for the Gospel in Queen Mary's days, did survive her bloody reign,
and in the days of Queen Elizabeth of ever blessed memory, flourished in
this Church, and were notable instruments of God in the restoring and
establishing of religion: who more admired for piety, prudence, learning and
charity, then that most reverend father in Gods Church, Edwin Sands borne in
Fournfells in Lancashire, who at the time of the decease of Edward the sixth,
being Doctor of divinity, and vice Chancellor of the university of
Cambridge, did so wisely and prudently behave himself in the midst of those
troubles and that great confusion, especially in his public sermon which he
was commanded by the Duke of Northumberland, to make against Queen Mary in
that great assembly at Cambridge, where the Duke himself with many nobles and
men of war were assembled to go and apprehend her; that he gave content to
the Duke; and yet the Queen and her party could not from thence take any
advantage against him: who also after many troubles, persecutions and
imprisonment, escaped with great difficulty, and fled beyond the seas, and
from thence returning in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, after his
learned disputations against the Popish Bishops, was in the judgment of that
noble Queen and her wife counsel, esteemed worthy of greatest promotions in
the Church, and was preferred first to be Bishop of Woreester, after Bishop of
London, and lastly Archbishop of York, in all which seas he flourished, and
was famous for his promoting of piety, advancing of learned preachers, and for
public works of charity, among the rest for his erecting and indowing of a
free school at Hauxhead where he was borne, and where I one of the meanest of
his kindred was in my youth trained up in learning; who also dying in a good
old age, left behind him a no ble progeny and race of sons, diverse of whom do
until this day flourish in wealth and honor, and are famous for wisdom,
eloquence and experience in matters of religion and policy obtained by their
trauells in many foreign Countries, and are men noted for other noble virtues
in this state and kingdom. The time would fail me, if I should reckon up by
name all our Countrymen famous in this kind, and should relate their worthy
acts; as Mr. Alexander Nowell Doctor of divinity and Deane of Paul's, whose
taste of persecution and banishment with other troubles and afflictions which he
endured in Queen Mary's days, wrought in him such charity and compassion to
the poor, that he became a pattern as of piety toward God, so of pity to
the poor; and having spent his days and his wealth in continual works of
charity, left also after him worthy monuments of his piety and charity, which
remain in Oxford and other places to the worlds end, for the benefit of young
Scholars borne in Lancashire, and for their education in learning and good
literature. I might also add among all the rest one of mine own name and
near kindred, John Walker Doctor of divinity, and sometimes Archdeacon and
residenciary of St. Paul's Church in London, in whose breast godly zeal began
to burn in his youth and tender years so fervently, that in the days of
He^ri^ the eight when Popery began to decline, and the way was but a preparing
for reformation of religion, he together with the godly Archbishop before
named, out of their detestation and hatred which they bare to Popish
superstition and Idolatry, did like Gideon secretly out, mangle and deface the
Popish Images in the Church of Hauxhead, the place of their nativity and mine;
upon suspicion whereof he was forced to flee out of his Country, and was
secretly nourished and brought up in Cambridge, where he became a man of note
for his great learning, and after persecution and banishment which he suffered
in Queen Mary's time, he was advanced in the happy days of Queen Elizabeth
to the dignities fore named, of which how worthy he was may appear by his
disputation with Campian the Popes Challenger yet extant in print, against whom
he was by the public authority of the state chosen and appointed to dispute
among other chose learned men of the Kingdom. Now these with many others most
godly and zealous professors and holy martyrs, being the first fruits of our
native Country of Lancashire which it brought forth, and offered unto God in
the first day spring of the reviving Gospel, I see no cause why we may not
conclude, and upon this ground assure our selves, that our Country and the
general body or multitude of our people are an holy lump or mass chosen of
God, and holy according to the election of grace; and that in due time they
shall be generally converted and actually called to the knowledge and
profession of the true faith: For thus the holy Apostle Paul does reason and
conclude concerning his Countrymen the Jews Romans 11.16. That if the first
first fruits be holy, the lump also must be holy. Wherefore let no vain
scruples, no uncharitable doubtings, no evil surmises disturb us in this good
work of piety and charity, nor withdraw our hearts, nor cause us to withdraw
our hands from a liberal contribution, which is so necessary and commodious
for the advancement of religion in the place of our nativity, and which has so
much hope of gaining many souls of our brethren to God. Although I have no
warrant in Gods word to persuade you with Popish motives (...) merit, that by
cheerful performance of this pious work, you shall merit great rewards and
blessings at Gods hands; no not if you should sell all that you have, and
bestow on works of this nature; (because all that we have is Gods he ^ath l^nt
it us, and if we give all to him we give him but his own; neither can we by
all we have be profitable to God, for he needs nothing of ours, our well doing
is akogether for our own good and the good of our brethren, and serves to
glorify Gods grace in us, not to add any glory to him in himself, and to
magnify his name and his goodness before men, not to make him any better in
his own nature or person:) yet thus much I assure you, that if out of love to
godliness, and out of humble obedience to Gods majesty, and true charity to
the souls of his people, all proceeding from a lively faith in Christ, you be
stirred up to show your selves cheerful, forward and bountiful in this pious
and charitable work, according to the ability which God has given to every
one of you; this your well-doing shall undoubtedly receive from God great
recompense of reward of his free grace and bounty, and for the merit of Christ;
and the mere good works that you do of this kind, the more evidence and
testimony you shall have of true faith and of the spirit of God dwelling in
you, and making you one body with Christ, and partakers of his merits; which
evidence shall not only confirm you against all temptations, and comfort you
in all afflictions, and make your prosperity sweet unto your souls in this
life: but also shall stand up in judgment for you, and prove you true members
of Christ, that in him and for his merits sake you may receive the eternal
kingdom and inheritance prepared for all the elect and faithful before the
foundation of the world. Now my dear brethren and beloved Countrymen, as I in
this hope have many years studied and desired to set this good work on foot
for the good of my Country, and the salvation of my brethren, and as I have
spent both my labor and some money, and much precious time within the space of
these two years last past in attempting and beginning this work, about the
gathering of your names severally and particularly, and soliciting some of
you, among whom I have found diverse very forward, free and bountiful far
beyond expectation, and as I am ready even to the utmost of my ability to go
before you by my example in this contribution: So I beseech you that for the
same hopes sake, you will be ready to join with me and others who have begun
well, and that you will go on with us, and accompany us to the perfecting of
this worthy work. And for a conclusion of this exhortation, I humbly beseech
the Lord to enlarge your hearts according to the means and ability which he
has given you, that you may extend the bowels of compassion to your brethren
who sit in miserable darkness and in the shadow of death, that they being
called to the fellowshippe of the same grace with us, we may all glorify Gods
name before men in this life, and be glorified of him with endless glory in
the life to come, and may all reign with Christ our head the King of glory for
ever world without end: To whom and to the word of whose grace I commend you
all now and ever. Amen.

Your most affectionate Countryman, fellow-seruant in Christianity, and
brother in all Christian love, GEORGE WALKER Pastor of St. John Enangelists in
Watling-streete in LONDON.

FINIS.
