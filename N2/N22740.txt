GENTLEMEN, BOSTON, DECEMBER 22, 179^.
I am informed that WINTERBOTHAM's "Historical, Geographical, Commercial and
Philosophical View of the United States of America," first published in England
has been reprinted in this country.

It is apparent to every intelligent reader, and in the English Edition it is
acknowledged, that the author "has availed himself of the labors and
abilities" of others; and that "he has often no other merit than what arises
from selection and a few connecting sentences."

Part of my literary property has been in this manner invaded; and I am advised
that the Laws of the United States will give me a sufficient Remedy, against
any Person who shall reprint, import, publish, sell or expose to sale any part
of the above work, which may comprehend any considerable portion of my
publications; the copy rights of which are secured to me by a compliance with
the law.

As it is probable that some copies of the above work may be transmitted to you
for sale, I have thought it friendly and proper to apprize you of my intention,
to apply the provisions of the law upon this subject to my relief, if it should
become necessary.

I am, Gentlemen, your humble servant, JEREMY BELKNAP.
To the BOOKSELLERS of the United States of North America.
