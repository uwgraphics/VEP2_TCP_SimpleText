IN Europe, dedications have their price; and the author oftener looks to the
plenitude of the pockets, than the brains of his patron.

The American author can hope but little pecuniary emolument from even the
sale, and not any from the dedication of his work. To adorn his book with the
name of some gentleman, of acknowledged merit, involves his whole interest, in
a public address.

With this view, will you, Sir, permit a lover of the Muses, and a biographer
of private life, to address to you (a Poet and the Biographer of a Hero) a
detail of those miseries of slavery, from which your public energies have
principally conduced to liberate hundreds of our fellow citizens.

UPDIKE UNDERHILL.
JUNE 20, 1797.
PREFACE.
ONE of the first observations, the author of the following sheets made, upon
his return to his native country, after an absence of seven years, was the
extreme avidity, with which books of mere amusement were purchased and perused
by all ranks of his countrymen. When he left New England, books of Biography,
Travels, Novels, and modern Romances, were confined to our sea ports; or, if
known in the country, were read only in the families of Clergymen, Physicians,
and Lawyers: while certain funeral discourses, the last words and dying
speeches of Bryan Shaheen, and Levi Ames, and some dreary somebody's Day of
Doom, formed the most diverting part of the farmer's library. On his return
from captivity, he found a surprising alteration in the public taste. In our
inland towns of consequence, social libraries had been instituted, composed of
books, designed to amuse rather than to instruct; and country booksellers,
fostering the new born taste of the people, had filled the whole land with
modern Travels, and Novels almost as incredible. The diffusion of a taste, for
any species of writing, through all ranks, in so short a time, would appear
impracticable to a European. The peasant of Europe must first be taught to
read, before he can acquire a taste in letters. In New England, the work is
half completed. In no other country are there so many people, in proportion to
its numbers, who can read and write; and therefore, no sooner was a taste for
amusing literature diffused than all orders of country life, with one accord,
forsook the sober sermons and Practical Pieties of their fathers, for the gay
stories and splendid impieties of the Traveller and the Novelist. The worthy
farmer no longer fatigued himself with Bunyan's Pilgrim up the "hill of
difficulty" or through the "slough of despond;" but quaffed wine with Brydone
in the hermitage of Vesuvius, or sported with Bruce on the fairy land of
Abysinia: while Dolly, the diary maid, and Jonathan, the hired man, threw aside
the ballad of the cruel stepmother, over which they had so often wept in
concert, and now amused themselves into so agreeable a terror, with the
haunted houses and hobgobblins of Mrs. Ratcliffe, that they were both afraid to
sleep alone.

While this love of literature, however frivolous, is pleasing to the man of
letters, there are two things to be deplored. The first is that, while so many
books are vended, they are not of our own manufacture. If our wives and
daughters will wear gauze and ribbands, it is a pity, they are not wrought in
our own looms. The second misfortune is that Novels, being the picture of the
times, the New England reader is insensibly taught to admire the levity, and
often the vices of the parent country. While the fancy is enchanted, the heart
is corrupted. The farmer's daughter, while she pities the misfortune of some
modern heroine, is exposed to the attacks of vice, from which her ignorance
would have formed her surest shield. If the English Novel does not inculcate
vice, it at least impresses on the young mind an erroneous idea of the world,
in which she is to live. It paints the manners, customs, and habits of a
strange country; excites a fondness for false splendor; and renders the
homespun habits of her own country disgusting.

There are two things wanted, said a friend to the author: that we write our
own books of amusement, and that they exhibit our own manners. Why then do you
not write the history of your own life? The first part of it, if not highly
interesting, would at least display a portrait of New England manners, hitherto
unattempted. Your captivity among the Algerines, with some notices of the
manners of that ferocious race, so dreaded by commercial powers, and so little
known in our country, would be interesting; and I see no advantage the Novel
writer can have over you, unless your readers should be of the sentiment of the
young lady, mentioned by Addison in his spectator, who, he informs us, borrowed
Plutarch's lives; and, after reading the first volume, with infinite delight,
supposing it to be a Novel, threw aside the others with disgust, because a man
of letters had inadvertently told her, the work was founded on FACT.

ARGUMENT.
The Author gives an Account of his gallant Ancestor, Captain John Underhill,
his Arrival in Massachusetts, and Persecution by the first Settlers.

I DERIVE my birth from one of the first emigrants to New England, being
lineally descended from Captain John Underhill, who came into the Massachusetts
in the year one thousand six hundred and thirty; of whom honorable mention is
made by that elegant, accurate, and interesting historian, the Reverend Jeremy
Belknap, in his History of New Hampshire.

My honored ancestor had early imbibed an ardent love of liberty, civil and
religious, by his service as a soldier among the Dutch, in their glorious and
successful struggle for freedom, with Philip the second of Spain; when, though
quite a youth, he held a commission in the Earl of Leicester's own troop of
guards, who was then sent to the assistance of that brave people, by the
renowned Queen Elizabeth of England.

The extravagant passion, which that princess was supposed to entertain for
various male favorites, which occasioned the disgrace of one, and the
premature death of another, while it has furnished a darling theme to the
novelist, and has been wept over in the tragic scene, has never yet received
the sober sanction of the historian.

A traditional family anecdote, while it places the affection of the queen for
Leicester beyond doubt, may not be unpleasing to the learned reader, and may
benefit the English historiographer.

It is well known that this crafty queen, though repeatedly solicited, never
efficaciously assisted the Netherlanders, until their affairs were apparently
at the lowest ebb, and they in such desperate circumstances, as to offer the
sovereignty of their country to her general, the Earl of Leicester. Captain
Underhill carried the dispatches to England, and delivered them at the office
of Lord Burleigh. The same evening, the queen sent for the captain, and, with
apparent perturbation, inquired of him, if he was the messenger from Leicester,
and whether he had any private dispatches for her. He replied, that he had
delivered all his letters to the secretary of state. She appeared much
disappointed, and, after musing some time, said, "So Leicester wants to be a
king." Underhill, who was in the general's confidence, replied that the Dutch
had indeed made the offer of the sovereignty of their country to her general --
esteeming it a great honor, as they said, to have a subject of her grace for
their sovereign. No, replied the queen, it is not the Dutch; they hate kings
and their divine right; it is the proud Leicester, who yearns to be independent
of his own sovereign, who moves this insolent proposal. Tell him, from me, that
he must learn to obey, before he is fit to govern. Tell him, added the queen,
softening her voice, that obedience may make him a king indeed. Immediately
after Captain Underhill had taken the public dispatches, the queen sent for him
to her privy closet, recalled her verbal message, delivered him a letter for
Leicester, directed with her own hand, and a purse of one hundred crowns for
himself; charging him to enclose the letter in lead, sink it in case of danger
in his passage by sea, and to deliver it privately. On the receipt of this
letter, Leicester was violently agitated, walked his chamber the whole of the
ensuing night. Soon after, he resigned his command, and returned to England,
animated by the brightest hopes of realizing the lofty suggestions of his
ambition. With him Captain Underhill returned, and upon the decease of the Earl
of Leicester, attached himself to the fortunes of the Earl of Essex, the
unfortunate successor to Leicester in the queen's favor. He accompanied that
gallant nobleman in his successful attack upon Cadiz, and shared his ill
fortune in his fruitless expedition against Tyronne, the rebel chief of the
revolted clans of Ireland; and, returning with the Earl into England, by his
attachment to that imprudent nobleman, sallying into the streets of London in
the petty insurrection, which cost Essex his head, he was obliged to seek
safety in Holland, until the accession of King James, in one thousand six
hundred and three, when he applied for pardon and leave to return to his native
country. But that monarch entertained such an exalted idea of the dignity of
kings, and from policy, affected so great a veneration for the memory of his
predecessor, that no interest of his friends could procure his pardon for an
offense, which, in this day and country, would be considered a simple rout or
riot, and punished with a small sine, in that age of kingly glory was supposed
to combine treason and blasphemy: treason against the queen in her political
capacity, and blasphemy against her as God's representative and vicegerent on
earth.

The Reverend Mr. Robinson, with a number of other pious puritans, having sled,
from the persecuting fury of the English prelates, to Holland, in one thousand
six hundred and three, he dwelt and communed with them a number of years. He
was strongly solicited to go with Governor Carver, Elder Brewster, and the
other worthies, part of Mr. Robinson's church, to the settlement of Plymouth,
and had partly engaged with them, as their chief military officer; but, Captain
Miles Standish, his brave fellow soldier in the low countries, undertaking the
business, he declined.

How he joined Governor Winthrop, does not appear, but he came over to New
England with him, and soon after we find him disciplining the Boston militia,
where he was held in such high estimation that he was chosen to represent that
town in the general court; but, his ideas of religious toleration being more
liberal than those around him, he lost his popularity, and was, on the
twentieth of November, one thousand six hundred and thirty seven, disfranchised
and eventually banished the jurisdiction of Massachusetts.

The writers of those times differ, as to the particular offense for which he
was punished. Some say that it was for holding the antinomian tenets of the
celebrated Ann Hutchinson, others that the charge against him was for saying,
That the government al Boston were as zealous as the scribes and pharisees, and
as Paul before his conversion. The best account, I have been able to collect,
is, that at the time when the zeal of our worthy forefathers burned the hottest
against heretics and sectaries, when good Roger Williams, who settled
Providence, the pious Wheelwright, and others, were banished, he, with about
sixty other imprudent persons, who did not believe in the then popular
arguments of fines, imprisonment, disfranchisement, confiscation, banishments,
and halters for the conversion of infidels, supposed that the christian faith,
which had spread so wonderfully in its infancy, when the sword of civil power
was drawn against it, in that age, surrounded by numerous proselites, needed
not the same sword unsheathed in its favor. These mistaken people signed a
remonstrance against the violent proceedings, which were the order of that day.
William Aspinwall and John Coggeshell, two of the Boston representatives, who
signed the remonstrance, were sent home, and the town ordered to choose others
in their room. Some of the remonstrants recanted, some were fined, some were
disfranchised, and others, among whom was Captain Underhill, were banished.

It is said by some authors, that he was charged with the heinous crime of
adultery, and that he even confessed it. The candid American author, above
named, has fallen into this error. As I am sure it must have given him pain to
speak evil even of the dead, so I am certain he will rectify this mistake in
the next edition of his invaluable history.

That author informs us, page forty three of his first volume, "That he,
Captain Underhill, was privately dealt with, on suspicion of adultery, which he
disregarded, and therefore on the next sabbath was questioned for it before the
church; but the evidence not being sufficient to convict him, the church could
only admonish him." -- Page forty five, "He went to Boston, and in the same
public manner acknowledged his adultery. But his confession was mixed with so
many excuses and extenuations, that it gave no satisfaction."

The unwary reader would perhaps conclude, that actual adultery was intended,
as well as expressed, in these extracts. The Reverend author himself did not
advert to the idea, that the moral law of Boston, in one thousand six hundred
and thirty seven, was not so lax as the moral law of the same place, in one
thousand seven hundred and eighty four, as explained by the practice of its
inhabitants. The rigid discipline of our fathers of that era often construed
actions, expressions, and sometimes thoughts, into crimes; which actions in
this day, even the most precise would consider either innocent, indifferent, or
beneath the dignity of official notice. The fact is, that Captain Underhill, so
far from CONFESSING, was never charged with committing actual statute book
adultery. At a certain lecture in Boston, instead of noting the referred texts
in his bible, according to the profitable custom of the times, this gallant
soldier had fixed his eyes steadfastly, and perhaps inordinately, upon one
Mistress Miriam Wilbore; who it seems was, at that very time, herself in the
breach of the spirit of an existing law, which forbad women to appear in public
with uncovered arms and nocks, by appearing at the same lecture with a pair of
wanton open worked gloves, slit at the thumbs and fingers, for the convenience
of taking snuff; though she was not charged with the latter crime of using
tobacco. It was the ADULTERY OF THE HEART, of which my gallant ancestor was
accused, and founded on that text of scripture, "Whosoever looks on a woman
to lust after her, has committed adultery with her already in his heart."

ARGUMENT.
The Author rescueth from Oblivion a valuable Manuscript Epistle, reflecting
great Light on the Judicial Proceedings, in the first Settlement of
Massachusetts: Apologizeth for the Persecutors of his Ancestor.

I HAVE fortunately discovered, pasted on the back of an old Indian deed, a
manuscript, which reflects great light upon my ancestor's conduct, and on the
transactions of those times; which, according to the beneficial mode of modern
historians, I shall transcribe literally.

It should be premised, that in the year one thousand six hundred and thirty
six, the governor, deputy governor, three assistants, and three ministers,
among whom was Hugh Peter's, afterward hung and quartered in England, for his
adherence to Oliver Cromwell, were entreated, by the Massachusetts' court, to
make a draft of laws, agreeable to the word of God, to report to the next
general court; and, in the interim, the magistrates were directed to determine
causes according to the laws, then established, and where no laws existed, then
as near to the word of God as they could.

(Indorsed) BROTHER UNDERHILL'S EPISTLE. To Master HANSERD KNOLLYS -- these
Greeting.
Worthee and Beloved,
Remembrin my kind love to Mr. Hilton, I now send you some note of my trials
at Boston. -- Oh that I may come out of this, and all the like trials, as goold
sevene times puryfyed in the furnice.

After the rulers at Boston had failed to fastenne what Roger Harlakenden was
pleased to call the damning errors of Anne Hutchinson upon me, I looked to be
sent away in peace; but Governor Winthrop said I must abide the examining of
ye church, accordingly, on the third day of ye week, I was convened before
them. -- Sir Harry Vane, the governor, Dudley, Haines, with masters Cotton,
Shepherd, and Hugh Peter's present, with others. -- They prepounded that I was
to be examined, touching a certain act of adultery I had committed, with one
mistress Miriam Wilbore, wife of Samuel Wilbore, for carnally looking to lust
after her, at the lecture in Boston, when master Shepherd expounded -- This
mistress Miriam has since been dealte with, for coming to that lecture with a
pair of wanton open workt gloves, slit at the thumbs and fingers, for the
purpose of taking snuff; for, as master Cotton observed, for what end should
those vain opennings be, but for the intent of taken filthy snuff; and he
quoted Gregory Nazianzen upon good works. -- Master Peter's said, that these
opennings were Satan's port holes of fiery temptatione. Mistress Miriam offered
in excuse of her vain attire, that she was newle married, and appeared in her
bridal arraye. Master Peter's said, that marriage was the ocasion that the
Devil took to cast his fiery darts, and lay his pit falls of temptation, to
catch frale flesh and blood. She is to be further dealt with for taken snuff.
How the use of the good creature tobaccoe can be an offense I cannot see -- Oh
my beloved, how these proud pharisees labor about the minte and cummine.
Governor Winthrop inquired of me, if I confessed the matter. I said I wished
a copy of there charge. -- Sir Harry Vane said, there was no need of any
coppie, seeing I knew I was guiltee. Charges being made out where there was an
uncertantie whether the accused was guilty or not, and to lighten the accused
into the nature of his crime, here was no need. Master Cotton said, did you not
look upon mistress Wilbore? I confessd that I did. He said then you are verelie
guilty, brother Underhill. I said nay, I did not look at the woman lustfully.
-- Master Peter's said, why did you not look at sister Newell or sister Upham? I
said, verelie they are not desyrable women, as to temporale graces. -- Then
Hugh Peter's and al cried, it is enough, he has confessed, and passed to
excommunication. I said where is the law by which you condemn me. Winthrop
said, there is a committee to draft laws. Brother Peter's are you not on that
committee, I am sure you have maid a law against this cryinge sin. Hugh
Peter's replied that he had such a law in his mind, but had not writtene it
down. Sir Harry Vane said, it is sufficient. Haynes said, ay, law enough for
antinomians. Master Cotton took a bible from his coat and read whosoever looks
on a woman, etc.

William Blaxton When our forefathers first came to Boston, they found this
William Blaxton in the pessession of the site, where the town now stands. The
general court, April 1st, 1633, granted him fifty acres of land, near where his
house stood; supposed to be where the pest house in Boston formerly stood. --
He afterward removed to Rhode Island, and lived near Whipple's bridge in
Cumberland. -- He planted the first orchard in that district, the fruit of
which was eaten of one hundred and forty years afterward, and some of the
trees are now standing. -- He had been a minister of the church of England,
preached often at Providence, and died in a good old age much lamented.
has been with me privelie, he weeps over the cryinge sins of the times, and
expects soon to go out of the jurisdiction. I came from England, sais he,
because I did not like the lords bishops, but I have yet to pray to be
delivered from the lords brotherenne.

Salute brother Fish, and others, who havinge been disappointed of liberty in
this wilderness are earnestly lookinge for a better country.

Your felloe traveller in this vale of tears. JOHN UNDERHILL.
Boston, 28 th 4th month, 1638

It is with great reluctance I am induced to publish this letter, which appears
to reflect upon the justice of the proceedings of our forefathers. I would
rather, like the sons of Noah, go backwards and cast a garment over our
fathers' nakedness; but the impartiality of a historian, and the natural
solicitude to wipe the stains from the memory of my honored ancestor, will
excuse me to the candid. Whoever reflects upon the piety of our forefathers,
the noble unrestrained ardour, with which they resisted oppression in England,
relinquished the delights of their native country, crossed a boisterous ocean,
penetrated a savage wilderness, encountered famine, pestilence, and Indian
warfare, and transmitted to us their sentiments of independence, that love of
liberty, which under God enabled us to obtain our own glorious freedom, will
readily pass over those few dark spots of zeal, which clouded their rising sun.

ARGUMENT.
Captain Underhill seeks Shelter in Dover in New Hampshire: Is chosen Governor
by the Settlers: Driven by the pious Zeal of his persecutors to seek Shelter in
Albany: Reception among the Dutch: Exploits in the Indian Wars: Grant of a
valuable Tract of Land: The Author anticipates his encountering certain Land
Speculators in Hartford: A Taste of the Sentiments of those Gentlemen: Farther
account of his Ancestors.

WHEN the sentence of banishment passed on Captain Underhill, he returned to
Dover in New Hampshire, and was elected governor of the European settlers
there; but, notwithstanding his great service to the people of Massachusetts,
in the Pequod wars, his persecutors in Boston would not allow him to die in
peace. First, by writing injurious letters to those he governed; by threats of
their power; and lastly, by determining that Dover was within the jurisdiction
of Massachusetts, they forced him to flee to Albany, then possessed by the
Dutch, under the name of Amboyna.

The Dutch were highly pleased with the Captain, and after Dutchifying his name
into Captain Hans Van Vanderhill, they gave him a command of one hundred and
twenty men, in their wars with the natives. It is said that he killed one
hundred and fifty Indians on Long Island, and upwards of three hundred on the
Main. The laurels of the famous Colonel Church wither in comparison. The Dutch
granted him fifty thousand acres of land, then in their possession. Although
the English, when they took possession of that country for the Duke of York,
afterward James the second, had promised to quiet the claims of the settlers;
yet Captain Underhill, or his posterity, have never availed themselves of the
grant. -- Mentioning this circumstance, sometime since in Hartford, some
gentlemen immediately offered to raise a company and purchase my right. I
heartily confessed that I was not possessed of the title, and knew not the
particular spot where the land lay, and consequently was unwilling to sell land
without title or boundaries. To my surprise they laughed at my scruples, and
observed that they wanted the land to speculate upon, to sell, and not to
settle. Titles and boundaries, in such cases, I understood, were indifferent
matters mere trifles.

My brave ancestor at an advanced age, died in Albany, leaving two sons; the
youngest of whom removed to the mouth of Hudson, where some of his posterity
flourish respectably to this day. The eldest son, Benoni, from whom I am
descended, some years after his father's decease, after being the subject of
various misfortunes, returned in impoverished circumstances to New Hampshire,
where the family have continued ever since.

ARGUMENT.
The Author's Birth, and a remarkable Dream of his Mother: Observations on
foreboding Dreams: The Author recites a Dream of Sir William Phipps, Governor
of Massachusetts, and refereth small Infidels to Mather's Magnalia.

I WAS born on the sixteenth of July, Anno Domini, one thousand seven hundred
and sixty two. My mother, some months before my birth, dreamed that she was
delivered of me; that I was lying in the cradle, that the house was beset by
Indians, who broke into the next room, and took me into the fields with them;
that, alarmed by their hideous yellings and warhoops, she ran to the window,
and saw a number of young tawny savages, playing at foot ball with my head;
while several sachems and sagamores were looking on unconcerned.

This dream made a deep impression on my mother. I well recollect, when a boy,
her stroking my flaxen locks, repeating her dream, and observing with a sigh to
my father, that she was sure Updike was born to be the sport of fortune, and
that he would one day suffer among savages. Dear woman, she had the native
Indians in her mind, but never apprehended her poor son's suffering, many years
as a slave, among barbarians, more cruel than the monsters of our own woods.

The learned reader will smile contemptuously, perhaps, upon my mentioning
dreams, in this enlightened age. I only relate facts, and leave the reader to
his own comments. My own opinion of dreams I shall conceal, perhaps because I
am ashamed to disclose it. I will venture to observe that, if we inspect the
sacred scriptures, we shall find frequent instances, both of direction to duty,
and forewarning of future events, communicated by Providence, through the
intervention of dreams. Is not the modern christian equally the care of
indulgent Heaven, as the favored Jew, or the beloved patriarch?

Many modern examples, of the foreboding visions of the night, may be adduced.
William Phipps, a poor journeyman ship carpenter, dreamed that he should one
day ride in his coach, and live in a grand house near Boston common. Many years
afterward, when he was knighted by King William the third, and came from
England, governor of Massachusetts Bay, this dream, even as to the situation
of the grand house, was literally and minutely fulfilled. If the insect
infidels of the day doubt this fact, let them consult, for their edification,
the learned Doctor Mather's Magnalia, where the whole story, at large, is
minutely and amply related. -- It was the error of the times of monkish
ignorance, to believe every thing. It may possibly be the error of the present
day, to credit nothing.

ARGUMENT.
The Author is placed at a private School: Parental Motives to a College
Education: Their design frustrated by family Misfortune.

IN my childhood I was sent, as is customary, to a woman's school, in the
summer, and to a man's, in the winter season, and made great progress in such
learning as my preceptors dealt in. About my twelfth year, our minister, who
made it his custom to inspect the schools annually, came to our district. My
master, who looked upon me as his best scholar, directed me to read a lesson in
Dilworth's spelling book, which I recited as loud as I could speak, without
regard to emphasis or stops. This so pleased our minister, who prided himself
on the strength of his own lungs, that, a short time after, coming to my
father's, to dicker, as they styled it, about a swop of cattle, and not finding
my father sharp at the bargain, he changed the discourse upon me; observing how
delighted he was with my performances at school. What a pity it was such a
genius was not encouraged. Mr. Underhill, you must put Updike to learning. My
father pleaded poverty. When I went to Harvard College, replied the minister, I
was poor indeed. I had no father with a good farm to assist me; but, with being
butler's freshman, and ringing the bell the first year, waiter the three last,
and keeping school in the vacations, I rubbed through, and am now what I am;
and who knows, continued he, but when Updike has completed his education, he
may make a minister, and possibly, when my usefulness is over, supply our very
pulpit.

My mother here interfered. She was a little spare woman. My father was a large
bony man; famous, in his youth, for carrying the ring at wrestling; and, in his
latter years, for his perseverance at town meetings. But, notwithstanding my
father's success in carrying points abroad, my mother, some how or other,
contrived always to carry them at home. My father never would acknowledge this;
but, when a coarse neighbor would sometimes slily hint the old adage of the
gray mare being the better horse, he would say to his particular friends that
he always was conqueror in his domestic warfare: but would confess that he
loved quiet, and was of late tired of perpetually getting the victory. My
mother joined the minister; observing that Updike should have learning, though
she worked her hands to the bone to procure it. She did not doubt, when he came
to preach, he would be as much run after as the great Mr. Whitfield. I always
thought, continued she, the child was a genius; and always intended he should
go to college. The boy loves books. He has read Valentine and Orson, and
Robinson Crusoe. I went, the other day, three miles to borrow Pilgrim's
Progress for him. He has read it through every bit; ay, and understands it too.
Why, he stuck a skewer through Apollyon's eye in the picture, to help Christian
beat him. My father could not answer my mother's argument. The dicker about the
oxen was renewed; and it was concluded to swop even, though my father's were
much the likelier cattle, and that I should go that week and study Latin with
the minister, and be fitted for college.

With him I studied four years, laboring incessantly at Greek and Latin: as to
English grammar, my preceptor, knowing nothing of it himself, could communicate
nothing to me. As he was enthusiastically attached to the Greek, and had
delivered an oration in that language, at the commencement at Cambridge, when
he took his first degree, by his direction, I committed to memory above four
hundred of the most sonorous lines in Homer, which I was called to repeat
before a number of clergymen, who visited him at an annual convention, in our
parish. These gentlemen were ever pleased to express astonishing admiration at
my literary acquirements. One of them prognosticated that I should be a
general, from the fire and force, with which I recited Homer's battles of the
Greeks and Trojans. Another augered that I should be a member of congress, and
equal the Adamses in oratory, from my repeating the speeches, at the councils
of the heathen gods, with such attention to the caesura. A third was sure that
I should become a Witherspoon in divinity, from the pathos, with which I
declaimed Jupiter's speech to all the gods. In fine, these gentlemen considered
the classics the source of all valuable knowledge. With them dead languages
were more estimable than living; and nothing more necessary to accomplish a
young man for all, that is profitable and honorable in life, than a profound
knowledge of Homer. One of them gravely observed that he was sure General
Washington read Greek; and that he never would have captured the Hessians at
Trenton, if he had not taken his plan of operation from that of Ulysses and
Diomede seizing the horses of Rhesus, as described in the tenth book of the
Iliad.

Thus slattered by the learned, that I was in the high road to fame, I gulped
down daily portions of Greek, while my preceptor made quarterly visits to my
father's barn yard, for pay for my instruction.

In June, one thousand seven hundred and eighty, my father began seriously to
think of sending me to college. He called upon a neighbor, to whom he had sold
part of his farm, for some cash. His creditor readily paid, the whole sum due,
down in paper money, and my father found, to his surprise, that the value of
three acres paid him the principal and interest of the whole sum, for which he
had sold seventy five acres of land, five years before. This was so severe a
stroke of ill fortune, that it entirely frustrated the design of sending me to
college.

CHAP. VI.
Heteroclita sunto.
LILLY'S GRAMMAR;
ARGUMENT.
This Chapter contains an Eulogy on the Greek Tongue.

WHAT added to the misfortune, mentioned in the last chapter, a worthy divine,
settled in Boston, passing through our town, told my father, in a private
conversation, that all the Greek I had acquired, was of no other service than
fitting me for college. My father was astonished. He was a plain unlettered
man, of strong natural abilities. Pray, Reverend Sir, said my father, do they
not learn this Greek language at college? If so, why do such wise men, as the
governors of colleges, teach boys what is entirely useless? I thought that the
sum of all good education was, to teach youth those things, which they were to
practice in after life. Learning, replied our enlightened visitor, has its
fashions; and, like other fashions of this world, they pass away. When our
forefathers founded the college, at Cambridge, critical knowledge in the mazes
and subtleties of school divinity was all the mode. He that could give a new
turn to an old text, or detect a mistranslation in the version, was more
admired than the man, who invented printing, discovered the magnetic powers, or
contrived an instrument of agriculture, which should abridge the labor of the
husbandman. The books of our faith, with the voluminous commentaries of the
fathers, being originally written, in what are now called, the dead languages,
the knowledge of those languages was then necessary, for the accomplishment of
the fashionable scholar. The moderns, of New England, have ceased to interest
themselves in the disputes, whether a civil oath may be administered to an
unregenerate man; or, whether souls, existing merely in the contemplation of
Deity, are capable of actual transgression. Fashion has given a new direction
to the pursuits of the learned. They no longer soar into the regions of
infinite space; but endeavor, by the aid of natural and moral philosophy, to
amend the manners and better the condition of man: and the college, at
Cambridge, may be assimilated to an old beau, with his pocket holes under his
arm pits, the skirts of his coat to his ancles, and three gross of buttons on
his breeches; looking with contempt on the more easy, useful garb of the
present day, for deviating from what was fashionable in his youth.

But, inquired my father, is there not some valuable knowledge contained in
those Greek books? All that is useful in them, replied our visitor, is already
translated into English; and more of the sense and spirit may be imbibed, from
translations, than most scholars would be able to extract, from the originals,
if they even availed themselves of such an acquaintance with that language, as
is usually acquired, at college.

Well, replied my father, do you call them dead languages. It appears to me
now, that confining a lad of lively genius to the study of them, for five or
six of the most precious years of his youth, is like the ingenious cruelty of
those tyrants, I have heard of, who chained the living and the dead together.
If Updike went to college, I should wish he would learn, not hard words, but
useful things.

You spoke of governors of colleges, continued our visitor. Let me observe, as
an apology, for the concern they may be supposed to have, in this error, that
they are moral, worthy men, who have passed the same dull routine of education,
and whose knowledge is necessarily confined to these defunct languages. They
must teach their pupils what they know, not what they do not know. That
measure, which was measured unto them, they mete out, most liberally, unto
others.

Should not the legislature, as the fathers of the people, interfere, inquired
my father? We will not talk politics, at this time, replied our visitor.

My father was now determined that I should not go to college. He concealed
this conversation from me, and I was left to be proud of my Greek. The little
advantage, this deceased language has since been to me, has often caused me
sorely to regret the mispense of time, in acquiring it. The French make it no
part of their academical studies. Voltaire, D'Alembert, and Diderot, when they
completed their education, were probably ignorant of the cognata tempora of a
Geek verb.

It was resolved that I should labor on my father's farm; but alas! a taste
for Greek had quite eradicated a love for labor. Poring so intensely on Homer
and Virgil had so completely filled my brain with the heathen mythology, that I
imagined a Hamadryade in every sapling, a Naiad in every puddle; and expected
to hear the sobbings of the infant Fauns, as I turned the furrow. I gave Greek
names to all our farming tools; and cheered the cattle with hexameter verse. My
father's hired men, after a tedious day's labor in the woods, inspecting our
stores, for refreshment, instead of the customary bread and cheese and brandy,
found Homer's Iliad, Virgil Delphini and Schrevelius's Lexicon, in the basket.

After I had worked on the farm some months, having killed a fat heifer of my
father's, upon which the family depended for their winter's beef, covered it
with green boughs, and laid it in the shade to putrify, in order to raise a
swarm of bees, after the manner of Virgil; which process, notwithstanding I
followed closely the directions in the georgics, some how or other, failed, my
father consented to my mother's request, that I should renew my career of
learning.

CHAP. VII.
Delightful task! to rear the tender thought,
To teach the young idea how to shoot,
To pour the fresh instruction over the mind,
To breathe the enlivening spirit, and to fix
The generous purpose in the glowing breast.
THOMSON'S SEASONS.
ARGUMENT.
The Author keeps a country School: The Anticipations, Pleasures and Profits
of a Pedagogue.

BY our minister's recommendation, I was engaged to keep a school, in a
neighboring town, so soon as our falls work was over.

How my heart dilated with the prospect, in the tedious interval, previous to
my entering upon my school. How often have I stood suspended over my dung fork,
and anticipated my scholars, seated in awful silence around me, my arm chair
and birchen scepter of authority. There was an echo in my father's sheep
pasture. More than once have I repaired there alone, and exclaimed with a loud
voice, is MASTER Updike Underhill at home? I would speak with MASTER Underhill,
for the pleasure of hearing how my title sounded. Do thou smile, indignant
reader, pause and recollect if these sensations have not been familiar to thee,
at sometime in thy life. If thou answerest disdainfully -- no -- then I aver
thou have never been a corporal in the militia, or a sophimore at college.

At times, I however entertained less pleasing, but more rational
contemplations on my prospects. As I had been once unmercifully whipped, for
detecting my master in a false concord, I resolved to be mild in my government,
to avoid all manual correction, and doubted not by these means to secure the
love and respect of my pupils.

In the interim of school hours, and in those peaceful intervals, when my
pupils were engaged in study, I hoped to indulge myself with my favorite
Greek. I expected to be overwhelmed with the gratitude of their parents, for
pouring the fresh instruction over the minds of their children, and teaching
their young ideas how to shoot. I anticipated independence from my salary,
which was to be equal to four dollars, hard money, per month, and my boarding;
and expected to find amusement and pleasure among the circles of the young, and
to derive information and delight from the classic converse of the minister.

In due time my ambition was gratified, and I placed at the head of a school,
consisting of about sixty scholars. Excepting three or four overgrown boys of
eighteen, the 'generality of them were under the age of seven years. Perhaps a
more ragged, ill bred, ignorant set, never were collected, for the punishment
of a poor pedagogue. To study in school was impossible. Instead of the silence
I anticipated, there was an incessant clamor. Predominant among the jarring
sounds were, Sir, may I read? May I spell? Master, may I go out? Will master
mend my pen? What with the pouting of the small children, sent to school, not
to learn, but to keep them out of "harm's way," and the gruff surly complaints
of the larger ones, I was nearly distracted. Homer's poluphlosboio thalasses,
roaring sea, was a whisper to it. My resolution, to avoid beating of them, made
me invent small punishments, which often have a salutary impression, on
delicate minds; but they were insensible to shame. The putting of a paper
fool's cap on one, and ordering another under my great chair, only excited
mirth in the school; which the very delinquents themselves often increased, by
loud peals of laughter. Going, one frosty morning, into my school, I found one
of the larger boys sitting by the fire in my arm chair. I gently requested him
to remove. He replied that he would, when he had warmed himself; "father finds
wood, and not you." To have my throne usurped, in the face of the whole school,
shook my government to the center. I immediately snatched my two foot rule, and
laid it pretty smartly across his back. He quitted the chair, muttering that he
would tell father. I found his threats of more consequence than I apprehended.
The same afternoon, a tall, raw boned man called me to the door; immediately
collering me with one hand, and holding a cart whip over my head with the
other; with fury in his face, he vowed he would whip the skin from my bones, if
ever I struck Jotham again* ay, he would do it that very moment, if he was not
afraid I would take the law of him. This was the only instance of the
overwhelming gratitude of parents I received. The next day, it was reported all
over town, what a cruel man the master was. "Poor Jotham came into school, half
frozen and near fainting; master had been sitting a whole hour by the warm
fire; he only begged him to let him warm himself a little, when the master rose
in a rage, and cut open his head with the tongs, and his life was despaired of."

Fatigued with the vexations of my school, I one evening repaired to the
tavern, and mixed with some of the young men of the town. Their conversation I
could not relish; mine they could not comprehend. The subject of race horses
being introduced, I ventured to descant upon Xanthus, the immortal courser of
Achilles. They had never heard of 'squire Achilles, or his horse; but they
offered to bet two to one, that Bajazet, the Old Roan, or the deacon's mare,
Pumpkin and Milk, would beat him, and challenged me to appoint time and place.

Nor was I more acceptable among the young women. Being invited to spend an
evening, after a quilting, I thought this a happy opportunity to introduce
Andromache, the wife of the great Hector, at her loom; and Penelope, the
faithful wife of Ulysses, weaving her seven years web. This was received with a
stupid stare, until I mentioned the long time the queen of Ulysses was weaving;
when a smart young woman observed, that she supposed Miss Penelope's yarn was
rotted in whitening, that made her so long: and then told a tedious story of a
piece of cotton and linen she had herself woven, under the same circumstances.
She had no sooner finished, than, to enforce my observations, I recited above
forty lines of Greek, from the Odessey, and then began a dissertation on the
caesura. In the midst of my harrangue, a florid faced young man, at the further
end of the room, with two large prominent foreteeth, remarkably white, began to
sing, "Fire upon the mountains, run boys, run;"
And immediately the whole company rushed forward, to see who should get a
chance in the reel of six.

I was about retiring, fatigued and disgusted, when it was hinted to me, that I
might wait on Miss Mima home; but as I could recollect no word in the Greek,
which would construe into bundling, or any of Homer's heroes, who got the bag,
I declined. In the Latin, it is true, that AEneas and Dido, in the cave, seem
something like a precedent. It was reported all over the town, the next day,
that master was a papish, as he had talked French two hours.

Disappointed of recreation, among the young, my next object was the minister.
Here I expected pleasure and profit. He had spent many years in preaching, for
the edification of private families, and was settled in the town, in a fit of
enthusiasm; when the people drove away a clergyman, respectable for his years
and learning. This he was pleased to call an awakening. He lectured me, at the
first onset, for not attending the conference and night meetings; talked much
of gifts, and decried human learning, as carnal and devilish, and well he
might, he certainly was under no obligations to it; for a new singing master
coming into town, the young people, by their master's advice, were for
introducing Dr. Watts's version of the Psalms. Although I argued with the
minister an hour, he remains firmly convinced, to this day, that the version of
Sternhold and Hopkins is the same in language, letter, and meter, with those
Psalms King David chaunted, in the city of Jerusalem.

As for the independence I had founded, on my wages, it vanished, like the rest
of my scholastic prospects. I had contracted some debts. My request for present
payment, was received with astonishment. I found, I was not to expect it, until
the next autumn, and then not in cash, but produce; to become my own collector,
and pick up my dues, half a peck of corn or rye in a place.

I was almost distracted, and yearned for the expiration of my contract, when
an unexpected period was put to my distress. News was brought, that, by the
carelessness of the boys, the school house was burnt down. The common cry now
was, that I ought, in justice, to pay for it; as to my want of proper
government the carelessness of the boys ought to be imputed. The beating of
Jotham was forgotten, and a thousand stories of my want of proper spirit
circulated. These reports, and even the loss of a valuable Gradus ad Parnossum,
did not damp my joy. I am sometimes led to believe, that my emancipation from
real slavery in Algiers, did not afford me sincerer joy, than I experienced at
that moment.

I returned to my father, who received me with kindness. My mother heard the
story of my discomfitures with transport; as, she said, she had no doubt that
her dream, about my falling into the hands of savages, was now out.

CHAP. VIII.

POPE.
ARGUMENT.
A sure Mode of discovering the Bent of a young Man's Genius.

I ABODE at home the remainder of the winter. It was determined that I should
pursue one of the learned professions. My father, with parental pride and
partiality, conceiving my aversion to labor, my inattention to farming
business, and the tricks I had played him, the preceding season, as the sure
indications of genius. He now told the story of the putrified heifer, with
triumph; as he had read, in the news papers, that playing with paper kites was
the foundation of Doctor Franklin's fame; that John Lock, who dissected the
human mind, and discovered the circulation of the soul had, in the full
exercise of his understanding, played at duck and drake, on the Thames, with
his gold watch, while he gravely returned the pebble stone, which he held in
his other hand, into his fob; and, that the learned Sir Isaac Newton made soap
bladders with the funk of a tobacco pipe, and was, ever after, so enamoured
with his sooty funk, as to make use of the delicate finger of a young lady, he
courted, as a pipe stopper.

I was allowed the choice of my profession, to discover the bent of my genius.
By the advice of a friend, my father put into my hands, what he was told were
some of the prime books, in the several sciences. In divinity, I read ten
funeral, five election, three ordination, and seventeen farewell sermons,
Bunyan's Holy War, the Life of Colonel Gardner, and the Religious Courtship. In
law, the Statutes of New Hampshire and Burn's Justice abridged. In physic,
Buchan's Family Physician, Culpepper's Midwifery, and Turner's Surgery. The
agreeable manner in which this last author relates his own wonderful cures, the
lives of his patients, and his remarkable dexterity, in extracting a pound of
candles, from the arm of a wounded soldier; the spirited horse, the neat little
saddle bags, and tipped bridle, of our own doctor, determined me in favor of
physic. My father did not oppose my choice. He only dryly observed, that he did
not know what pretensions our family had to practice physic, as he could not
learn that we had ever been remarkable for killing any but Indians.

ARGUMENT.
The Author commences the Study of Physic, with a celebrated Physician and
Occulist: A Philosophical Detail of the Operation of couching for the Gutta
Serena, by his Preceptor, upon a young Man, born Blind.

THE next spring, I entered upon my studies, with a physician, not more justly
celebrated for his knowledge of the materia medica, than for his peculiar
dexterity and success, in couching for the gutta serena, and restoring persons,
even born blind, to sight. The account of a cure he performed, after I had been
with him about a year, may not be unacceptable to the lovers of natural
research. The subject was a young man, of twenty two years of age, of a sweet
disposition, amiable manners, and oppulent connexions. He was born stone blind.
His blindness was in some measure compensated, by the attention of his friends;
and the increased power of his other organs of perception. His brothers and
sisters enriched his mind, by reading to him, in succession, two hours every
day, from the best authors. His sense of feeling was astonishingly delicate,
and his hearing, if possible, more acute. His senses of taste and smelling,
were not so remarkable. After the customary salutation, of shaking hands, with
a stranger, he would know a person, by the touch of the same hand, several
years after, though absent in the interim. He could read a book or news paper,
newly printed, tolerably well, by tracing, with the tip of his finger, the
indents of the types. He acquired a knowledge of the letters of the alphabet
early, from the prominent letters on the gingerbread alphabets of the baker. He
was master of music, and had contrived a board, perforated with many gimblet
holes; and, with the assistance of a little bag of wooden pegs, shaped at top,
according to his directions, he could prick almost any tune, upon its being
sung to him. When in a large company, who sat silent, he could distinguish how
many persons were present, by noting, with his ear, their different manner of
breathing. By the rarity or density of the air, not perceivable by those in
company, he could distinguish high ground from low; and by the motion of the
summer's breeze, too small to move the loftiest leaf, he would pronounce,
whether he was in a wood or open country.

He was an unfeigned believer, in the salutary truths of christianity. He had
imbibed its benevolent spirit. When he spoke of religion, his language was love
to God, and good will to man. He was no zealot, but, when he talked of the
wonders of creation, he was animated with a glow of enthusiasm. You observed,
the other day, as we were walking on this plain, my friend, addressing himself
to me, as I was intimate in the family, that you knew a certain person, by his
gait, when at so great a distance, that you could not discern his features.
From this you took occasion to observe, that you saw the master hand of the
great Creator, in the obvious difference that was between man and man: not only
the grosser difference between the Indian, the African, the Esquimeaux, and the
white man; but that which distinguishes and defines accurately, men of the same
nation, and even children of the same parents. You observed, that as all the
children of the great family of the earth, were compounded of similar members,
features, and lineaments, how wonderfully it displayed the skill of the
Almighty Artist, to model such an infinite variety of beings, and distinctly
diversify them, from the same materials. You added, that the incident, you had
noticed, gave fresh instance of admiration; for you was now convinced that, if
even all men had been formed of so near resemblance, as not to be discerned
from each other, when at rest; yet, when in motion, from their gait, air, and
manner, they might readily be distinguished. While you spoke, I could perceive,
that you pitied me, as being blind to a wonderful operation of creative power.
I too, in my turn, could triumph. Blind as I am, I have discovered a still
minuter, but as certain a distinction, between the children of men, which has
escaped the touch of your eyes. Bring me five men, perfect strangers to me;
pair the nails of the same finger, so as to be even with the fingers' ends, let
me touch, with the tip of my finger, the nails thus prepared. Tell me each
person's name, as he passes in contact before me, bring the same persons to me
one month afterward, with their nails paired, in the same manner, and I will
call every one by his right name. For, be assured, my friend, that artist, who
has denied to me that thing called light, has opened the eyes of my mind, to
know that there is not a greater difference between the African and the
European, than what I could discover, between the finger nails of all the men
of this world. This experiment he afterward tried, with uniform success. It
was amusing, in a gayer hour, to hear him argue the superiority of the touch to
the sight. Certainly, the feeling is a nobler sense, than that you call sight.
I infer it from the care nature has taken of the former, and her disregard to
the latter. The eyes are comparatively poor, puny, weak organs. A small blow, a
mote, or a straw may reduce those, who see with them, to a situation as
pitiable as mine; while feeling is diffused over the whole body. Cut off my
arm, and a sense of feeling remains. Completely dismember me, and, while I
live, I possess it. It is coexistent with life itself.

The senses of smelling and taste are but modifications of this noble sense,
distinguished, through the inaccuracy of men, by other names. The flavor of
the most delicious morsel is felt by the tongue; and, when we smell the
aromatic, it is the effluvia of the rose, which comes in contact with the
olfactory nerves. You, that enjoy sight, inadvertently confess its inferiority.
My brother, honing his penknife, the other day, passed it over his thumb nail,
to discover if the edge was smooth. I heard him, and inquired, why he did not
touch it with his eyes, as he did other objects. He confessed that he could not
discover the gaps, by the sight. Here, the superiority of the most inaccurate
seat of the feeling, was manifest. To conclude, he would archly add: in
marriage, the most important concern in life, how many miserable, of both
sexes, are left to deplore, in tears, their dependence on this treacherous
thing, called sight. From this danger, I am happily secured, continued he,
smiling and pressing the hand of his cousin, who sat beside him; a beautiful
blooming young woman, of eighteen, who had been bred with him, from childhood,
and whose affection for him, was such that she was willing, notwithstanding his
blindness, to take him as a partner for life. They expected shortly to be
married. Notwithstanding his accuracy and veracity upon subjects, he could
comprehend; there were many, on which he was miserably confused. He called
sight the touch of the eyes. He had no adequate idea of colors. White, he
supposed, was like the feeling of down; and scarlet he resembled to the sound
of martial music. By passing his hands over the porcelain, earthern, or
plaster of Paris images, he could readily conceive of their being
representations of men or animals. But he could have no idea of pictures. I
presented him a large picture of his grand father, painted with oil colors on
canvass; told him whose resemblance it was. He passed his hand over the smooth
surface and mused. He repeated this; exclaimed it was wonderful; looked
melancholy; but never asked for the picture again.

Upon this young man, my preceptor operated successfully. I was present during
the whole process, though few were admitted. Upon the introduction of the
couching instruments, and the removal of the film from the retina, he appeared
confused. When the operation was completed, and he was permitted to look around
him, he was violently agitated. The irritability of the ophthalmic muscles
faintly expressed the perturbation of his mind. After two and twenty years of
total darkness, to be thus awakened to a new world of sensation and light; to
have such a flood of day poured on his benighted eye ball, overwhelmed him. The
infant sight was too weak, for the shock, and he fainted. The doctor
immediately intercepted the light with the proper bandages, and, by the
application of volatiles, he was revived. The next day, the dressings were
removed. He had fortified his mind, and was more calm. At first, he appeared to
have lost more than he had gained, by being restored to vision. When blind, he
could walk tolerably well, in places familiar to him. From sight, he collected
no ideas of distance. Green was a color peculiarly agreeable to the new born
sight. Being led to the window, he was charmed with a tree in full verdure, and
extended his arms to touch it, though at ten rods distance. To distinguish
objects within reach, he would close his eyes, feel of them with his hands, and
then look earnestly upon them.

According to a preconcerted plan, the third day, his bandages were removed, in
the presence of his parents, brothers, sisters, friends, and of the amiable,
lovely girl, to whom he was shortly to be married. By his request, a profound
silence was to be observed, while he endeavored to discover the person of her,
who was the object of his dearest affection. It was an interesting scene. The
company obeyed his injunction. Not a finger moved, or a breath aspirated. The
bandage was then removed; and, when he had recovered from the confusion of the
instant effusion of light, he passed his eye hastily over the whole group. His
sensations were novel and interesting. It was a moment of importance. For aught
he knew, he might find the bosom partner of his future life, the twin soul of
his affection, in the fat scullion wench, of his father's kitchen; or in the
person of the toothless, palsied, decriped nurse, who held the basin of gruel
at his elbow.

In passing his eye a second time over the circle, his attention was arrested,
by his beloved cousin. The agitations of her lovely features, and the
evanescent blush on her cheek, would have at once betrayed her, to a more
experienced eye. He passed his eye to the next person, and immediately returned
it to her. It was a moment big with expectation. Many a finger was raised to
the lips of the spectators, and many a look, expressive of the silence she
should preserve, was cast toward her. But the conflict was too violent for her
delicate frame. He looked more intensely; she burst into tears, and spoke. At
the well known voice he closed his eyes, rushed toward her, and clasped her in
his arms. I envied them their feelings; but I thought then, and do now, that
the sensations of my preceptor, the skilful humane operator, were more
enviable. The man who could restore life and usefulness, to the darling of his
friends, and scatter light in the paths of an amiable young pair, must have
known a joy never surpassed; except, with reverence be it spoken, by the
satisfaction of our benevolent Savior, when, by his miraculous power, he
opened the eyes of the actually blind, made the dumb to sing, and the lame and
impotent leap for joy.

MENTIONING the subject of the last chapter, to the celebrated Doctor Moyes,
who, though blind, delivered a lecture upon optics, and delineated the
properties of light and shade, to the Bostonians, in the year one thousand
seven hundred and eighty five; he exhibited a more astonishing illustration of
the power of the touch. A highly polished plane of steel was presented to him,
with a stroke of an etching tool, so minutely engraved upon it, that it was
invisible to the naked eye, and only discoverable with a powerful magnifying
glass; with his fingers he discovered the extent, and measured the length of
the line.

This gentleman lost his sight, at three years of age. He informed me, that
being overturned, in a stage coach, one dark rainy evening, in England, when
the carriage, and four horses, were thrown into a ditch, the passengers and
driver, with two eyes a piece, were obliged to apply to him, who had none, for
assistance, in extricating the horses. As for me, said he, after I had
recovered from the astonishment of the fall, and discovered that I had escaped
unhurt, I was quite at home in the dark ditch. The inversion of the order of
things was amusing. I, that was obliged to be led like a child, in the glaring
sun, was now directing eight persons, to pull here, and haul there, with all
the dexterity and activity of a man of war's boatswain.

None are so surely caught, when they are caught,
As Wit turned Fool: Folly, in Wisdom hatched,
Has Wisdom's warrant, and the help of school;
And Wit's own grace, to grace a learned Fool.

ARGUMENT.
The Author spouteth Greek, in a Sea Port: Its Reception among the Polite: He
attempteth an Ode, in the Style of the Ancients.

I PASSED my time very agreeably, with my preceptor; though I could not help
being astonished, that a man of his acknowledged learning, should not,
sometimes, quote Greek. Of my acquirements, in that language, I was still
proud. I attributed the indifference, with which it was received in the town,
where I had kept school, to the rusticity and ignorance of the people. As I now
moved in the circles of polished life, I ventured, sometimes, when the young
ladies had such monstrous colds, as that they could not, by the earnest
persuasions of the company, be prevailed on to sing; when it had been
frequently observed, that it was quaker meeting, to spout a few lines from the
Iliad. It is true, they did not interrupt me with,

"Fire upon the mountains, run boys, run;"
But the most sonorous lines of the divine blind bard were received with cold
approbation of politeness. One young lady, alone, seemed pleased. She would
frequently ask me, to repeat those lines of Wabash poetry. Though once, in the
sublime passage of the hero Ulysses, hanging fifty young maidens, with his own
hands, in the Odyssey, I heard the term, pedant, pronounced with peculiar
emphasis, by a beau, at my back. If I had taken the hint, and passed my Greek
upon my companions, for Indian, they would have heard me with rapture. I have
since known that worthy, indefatigable missionary to the Indians, the Reverend
Mr. K --, and the modern Elliot, entertain the same companies, for whole
evenings, with speeches in the aboriginal of America, as unintelligible to
them, as my insulted Greek.

I was so pleased with the young lady, who approved the Greek heroics, that I
determined to make my first essay, in meter, in an ode, addressed to her, by
name. I accordingly mustered all the high sounding epithets of the immortal
Grecian bard, and scattered them with profusion, through my ode. I praised her
golden locks, and assimilated her to the ox eyed Juno; sent her a correct copy,
and dispersed a number of others, among her friends. I afterward found, that
what I intended as the sublimest panegyric, was received as cutting insult. The
golden tresses, and the ox eyed epithet, the most favorite passages, in my
poem, were very unfortunate; as the young lady was remarkable, for very
prominent eyes, which resembled what, in horses, are called wall eyes. Her hair
was, what is vulgarly called, carroty. Its unfashionable color she
endeavored, in vain, to conceal, by the daily use of a leaden comb.

ARGUMENT.
The Author in imminent Danger of his Life in a Duel.

THE very next morning, after I had presented my ode, and before I had heard of
its reception, a young gentleman, very genteelly dressed, entered our drug
room, where I was compounding a cathartic, with my spatula; and, with a very
stately air, inquired for Mr. Updike Underhill. Upon being informed that I was
the person, with two of the most profound bows, I had ever seen, he advanced
toward me, and with slow and solemn emphasis, said, then sir, I have the
honor to present you with a billet, from my friend, Mr. Jasper T --. Two more
bows, as stately and low as the former. I took the letter, which was as big as
a governmental packet; and, in the midst of a large folio sheet, read the
following letter, from Mr. Jasper T --, a professed admirer of the young lady,
to whom I had addressed my ode, after the manner of the Greeks.

DEAR SIR,
Them there very extraordinary pare of varses, you did yourself the onner to
address to a young lada of my partecling acquaintance calls loudly for
explination. I shall be happy to do myself the onner of wasting a few charges
of powder with you on the morro morning precisely at one half hour before sun
rose at the lower end of (...) wharff.

Dear Sir, I am with grate parsonal esteem your sincere friend, ardent admirer
well wisher and umble servant to command,

JASPER T --.
Please to be punctual to the hour seconds if you incline.


July 24 th, 1782. Thursday A. M. ante merry dying.

Though I was engaged to watch that night, with one of my preceptor's
customers; yet, as Mr. Jasper T --, seemed so friendly and civil, I could not
find it in my heart, to refuse him, and replied that I would, with pleasure,
wait upon the gentleman. Sir, resumed the bearer, you are a man of honor,
every inch of you, and I am your most obedient, most obsequious, and most
humble servant: and then, making two profound bows, in the shop, and one more
at the door, he retired. He was no sooner departed, than I sat down, to
reperuse this elegant and very extraordinary billet. I had no particular
acquaintance with Mr. Jasper T --, and why he should write to me, at all,
puzzled me. The first part of the letter, I doubted not, contained an
approbation of my ode, and a request to be indulged with an explanation of some
of its peculiar beauties. I began to recollect illustrations and parodies, from
some favorite passages in the Iliad. But, what we were to do, in wasting a few
charges of powder, was utterly inexplicable. At one time, indeed, I thought it
an invitation to shoot partridges, and bethought myself of scouring a long
barrelled gun, which had descended as an heir loom in our family; and had,
perhaps, killed Indians, on Long Island, in the hands of my brave ancestor,
Captain John Underhill. Then again, I reflected, that the lower end of a wharf,
in a populous town, was not the most probable place, to spring a covey of
partridges. But what puzzled me most, was his punctual attention to hours, and
even seconds. My doubts were all cleared, by the entrance of a fellow student,
to whom I communicated the letter. He was born in Carolina, and understood the
whole business. It is a challenge, said he. A challenge! exclaimed I. For what?
Why only, repeated he cooly, to fight a duel, with Mr. Jasper T --, with sword
and pistol. Pho! replied I, you banter. Do look at the conclusion of the
letter. Will you make me believe that any man, in his senses, would conclude,
with all these expressions of esteem and friendship, an invitation to give him
an opportunity of cutting my throat, or blowing by brains out? You have been
bred in yankee land, replied my fellow student. Men of honor are above the
common rules of propriety and common sense. This letter, which is a challenge,
bating some little inaccuracies of grammar and spelling, in substance, I assure
you, would not disgrace grace a man of the highest honor; and, if Mr. Jasper T
-- acts as much the man of honor, on the wharf, as he has on paper, he will
preserve the same style of good breeding and politeness there also. While, with
one hand, he, with a deadly long, passes his sword through your lungs, he will
take his hat off, with the other, and bow gracefully to your corpse. Lord
deliver me from such politeness, exclaimed I. It seems to me, by your account
of things, that the principal difference between a man of honor, and a vulgar
murderer, is that the latter will kill you in a rage, while the former will
write you complaisant letters, and smile in your face, and bow gracefully,
while he cuts your throat. Honor, or no honor, I am plaguey sorry I accepted
his invitation. Come, continued my fellow student, you consider this little
affair too seriously. I must indoctrinate you. There is no more danger, in
these town duels, than in pounding our great mortar. Why, I fought three duels
myself in Carolina, before I was seventeen years old; and one was for an
affront offered to the negro wench, who suckled me: and I declare I had rather
fight ten more, than pass once, in a stage wagon, over Horse Neck. I see your
antagonist has offered you to bring a second. I will go with you. When you
arrive on the ground, we seconds shall mark out your position, to stand in, and
to be sure, as in case of blood shed, we shall come into difficulty, we shall
place you at a pretty respectable distance. You will then turn a copper for the
first fire; but I should advise you to grant it to him. This will give him a
vast idea of your firmness, and contempt of danger. Your antagonist, with
banishment from his country, and the gallows staring him in the face, will be
sure not to hit you, on his own account. The ball will pass, at least, ten rods
over your head. You must then discharge your pistol, in the air, and offer him
to fire again; as, in the language of the duellist, you will have given him his
life, so it will be highly inconsistent, in him, to again attempt yours. We
seconds shall immediately interfere, and pronounce you both men of honor. The
matter in controversy will be passed over. You will shake hands, commence warm
friends, and the ladies will adore you. Oh! Updike, you are a lucky fellow. I
cannot think, said I, why Mr. Jasper T --, should have such bloody designs
against me. I never intended to affront the young lady. Lisp not a word of
that, replied my instructor, as you value your reputation on 'change. When he
has fired over your head, you may confess what you please, with honor; but
however inoffensive you may have been, if you make such a confession before,
you are a man of no honor. You will be posted, in the coffee house, for a
coward. Notwithstanding the comfortable address of my friend, the thoughts of a
premature death, or being crippled for life, distressed me. Nor was the fear of
killing my antagonist, and of what my poor parents would suffer, from my being
exposed to infamous punishment, less alarming. I passed some hours of dreadful
anxiety; when I was relieved from my distress, in a way I little apprehended.
My challenger, who had lived some years in town, as a merchant's clerk, viewing
me as a raw lad, from the country, that would never dare accept his challenge,
when this messenger returned, was petrified with astonishment. When assured
that I had accepted his challenge, as a man of courage and honor, his heart
died within him. His friend had no sooner gone to prepare the pistols, than by
communicating the business, as a great secret, to two or three female friends,
the intended duel was noised about town. The justices, selectmen, and grand
jurors, convened. Warrants were issued, and constables dispatched into all
quarters. I was apprehended, in the sick man's chamber, where I was watching,
by the high sheriff, two deputies, three constables, and eleven stout
assistants; carried, in the dead of the night, before the magistrates, where I
met my antagonist, guarded by a platoon of the militia, with a colonel at their
head. We were directed to shake hands, make friends, and pronounce, on our
honors, that we would drop an affair, which we had, neither of us, any heart
to pursue. My acceptance of the challenge, however unintentional, established
my reputation, among the bucks and belles. The former pronounced me a man of
spunk and spirit; and the latter were proud of my arm in an evening rural walk
on the paved street. None dared to call me pedant; and, I verily believe that,
if I had spouted a whole Iliad, in the ball room, no one would have ventured to
interrupt me: for I had proved myself a MAN OF HONOR.

CHAP. XIII.
The flower of learning, and the bloom of wit.
YOUNG.
ARGUMENT.
The Author is happy, in the Acquaintance of a Learned Lady.

IN the circle of my acquaintance, there was a young lady, of not the most
promising person, and, of rather a vinegar aspect, who was just approximating
toward thirty years of age. Though, by avoiding married parties, mingling with
very young company, dressing airily; shivering in lawn and sarcenet, at
meeting, in December; affecting a girlish lisp, blush, and giggle, she was
still endeavoring to ward off that invidious appellation of old maid. Upon
good grounds, I am led to believe, that the charity of the tea table had added
to her years; because, from a long acquaintance with her, I could never induce
her to remember any event, however trivial, which happened before Lexington
battle. The girls, of my age, respected me, as a man of spirit; but I was more
fond of being esteemed, as a man of learning. This young lady loved literature,
and lamented to me her ignorance of the Greek. I gave her a decided preference
to her rivals. She borrowed books of me, and read them with astonishing
rapidity. From my own little library, and from those of my friends, I procured
above sixty volumes for her; among which were Lock on Human Understanding,
Stackhouse's Body of Divinity, and Glass's works, not on cookery, but the
benignant works of John Glass, the father of Sandiman, and the Sandimanians; in
which collection I did not however omit Pope's Homer, and Dryden's Virgil: and,
to my astonishment, though I knew that her afternoons were devoted to the
structure of caps and bonnets, she perused those sixty volumes completely, and
returned them to me, in less than a month. There was one thing peculiarly
pleasing to me, as a man of letters; that she never made dog leaves, or soiled
the books; a slovenly practice, of which even great scholars are some times
guilty. I would, at times, endeavor to draw her into a conversation, upon the
author she had recently perused. She would blush, look down, and say that it
did not become a young girl, like her, to talk upon such subjects, with a
gentleman of my sense. The compliment it contained ever rendered the apology
irresistible. One day, she asked me to lend her a dictionary. I immediately
procured for her the great Doctor Johnson's, in two volumes folio. About three
days afterward, she offered to return them. Knowing that a dictionary was a
work, to which reference was often necessary* and, thinking it might be of some
service to every lady of her learning, I pressed her to keep it longer. When
she replied, with the prettiest lisp imaginable, that they were indeed very
pretty story books; but, since I had lent them to her, she had read them all
through twice; and then inquired, with the same gentle lisp, if I could not
lend her a book, called Rolling Belly Lettres. I was in absolute astonishment.
Virgil's traveller, treading on the snake in the grass, was comparatively in
perfect composure. I took a folio under each arm, and skipped out of the house,
as lightly as if I had had nothing heavier, than a late antifederal election
sermon to carry. This learned young lady was amazingly affronted, at my abrupt
departure; but, when the cause of it was explained to her, some months after,
she endeavored to persuade a journeyman tailor, who courted her niece, to
challenge me to fight a duel, who actually penned a challenge, upon one of his
master's pasteboard patterns; and, I verily believe, would have sent it, by his
second, if he had not been informed, that my character was established, as a
man of honor.

CHAP. XIV.
A Babylonish dialect,

HUDIBRAS.
ARGUMENT.
The Author quitteth the Study of Gallamry, for that of Physic: He eulogiseth
the Greek Tongue, and complimenteth the Professors of Cambridge, Yale, and
Dartmouth; and gives a gentle Hint to careless Readers.

DISGUSTED with the frivolity of the young, and the deceit of the antiquated, I
now applied myself sedulously to my studies. Cullen, Munroe, Boerhaave, and
Hunter, were my constant companions. As I progressed in valuable science, my
admiration of the Greek declined. I now found, that Machaon and Podalirious,
the surgeons of Homer, were mere quacks; ignorant of even the application of
plasters, or the eighteen tailed bandage: and, in botany, inferior to the
Indian Powwows; and that the green ointment, of my learned friend, Doctor
Kitteridge, would have immortalized a bone setter, in the Grecian era, and
translated him, with Esculapius, to a seat among the gods. In justice to that
venerable language, and to the learned professors of Cambridge, Yale, and
Dartmouth, I will heartily confess, that my knowledge of it, was now, in the
first year of my apprenticeship, of some service to me, in now and then finding
the root of the labels cyphered on our gallipots. I shall mention a little
incident, which happened about this time, as it contains a lesson, valuable to
the reader, if he has penetration enough to discover it, and candor enough to
apply it to himself. Though I applied myself clossely to my books; yet, as
hours of relaxation were recommended, by my preceptor, I sometimes indulged in
the dance, and in sleighing rides. The latter being proposed, at a time when I
was without the means of paying my club, I had retired, with discontent, to my
chamber; where I accidentally cast my eyes upon a little old fashioned
duodecimo bible, with silver clasps, in the corner of my trunk, a present from
my mother, at parting; who had recommended the frequent perusal of it, as my
guide in difficulty, and consolation in distress. Young people, in perplexity,
always think of home. The bible reproached me. To remove the uneasy sensation,
and for the want of something more agreeable to do, I took up the neglected
book. No sooner had I unclasped it, than a guinea dropped from the leaves, which
had been deposited there, by the generous care of my affectionate mother; and,
by my inexcusable inattention, had lain there undiscovered, for more than two
years. I hastily snatched the brilliant prize, joined my young companions, and
resolved that, in gratitude, I would read a chapter in the bible, every
remaining day of my life. This resolution I then persevered in, a whole
fortnight. As I am on this subject, I will observe, though no zealot, I have
since, in the hours of misery and poverty, with which the reader shall be
acquainted, in the sequel, drawn treasures of support and consolation, from
that blessed book, more precious than the gems of Golconda, or the gold of Ophir.

The Author panegyrizes his Preceptor.

IN June, one thousand seven hundred and eighty five, I completed my studies.
My enlightened, generous preceptor, presented me with a Dispensatory, Cullen's
First Lines, and an elegant shaped case of pocket surgical instruments. As it
is possible that some friend of his may peruse this work, suffer me to pay him
a little tribute of gratitude. He was an unaffected gentleman, and a man of
liberal science. In him were united, the acute chemist, the accurate botanist,
the skilful operator, and profound physician. He possessed all the essence,
without the parade of learning. In the most simple language, he would trace the
latent disease, to its diagnostic; and, from his lips, subjects the most
abstruse, were rendered familiar to the unlettered man. Excepting when he was
with his pupils, or men of science, I never heard him use a technical term. He
observed once, that the bold truths of Paracelsus delighted him; but, it
partook so much of the speech of our country practitioners, that he was
disgusted with the pomposity of Theophrastus Bombastus. He was both an
instructor and parent to his pupils. An instructor in all the depth of science
he possessed, and a tender parent in directing them, in the paths of virtue and
usefulness. May he long live, to bless his country with the healing art; and,
may he be hereafter blessed himself, in that world, which will open new sources
of intelligence, to his inquiring mind.

ARGUMENT.
Doctor Underhill visits Boston, and makes no Remarks.

HAVING collected some small dues for professional services, rendered certain
merchants and lawyers' clerks, I concluded to make a short tour, to Boston, for
the purpose of purchasing a few medical authors and drugs. I carried letters of
introduction, from my preceptor, to the late Dr. Joseph Gardner, and other
gentlemen of the faculty. The wit and wine of this worthy man still relish on
recollection. The remarks I made upon this hospitable, busy, national, town
born people; my observations upon their manners, habits, local virtues,
customs, and prejudices; the elocution of their principal clergymen; with
anecdotes of public characters, I deal not in private foibles; and a
comparitive view of their manners, at the beginning, and near the close of the
eighteenth century, are pronounced, by the partiality of some friends, to be
original, and to those who know the town, highly interesting. If this homespun
history of private life, shall be approved, these remarks will be published by
themselves in a future edition of this work. I quitted Boston, with great
reluctance, having seventeen invitations to dinner, besides tea parties, on my
hands.

The Author Inspects the Museum at Harvard College: Account of the Wonderful
Curiosities, Natural and Artificial, he saw there.

ON my return, I passed through Cambridge; and, by the peculiar politeness and
urbanity of the then librarian, I inspected the college museum. Here, to my
surprise, I found the curiosities of all countries, but our own. When I
inquired for the natural curiosities of New England, with specimens of the rude
arts, arms, and antiquities of the original possessors of our soil, I was
shown, for the former, an overgrown gourd shell, which held, I do not recollect
how many gallons; some of the shavings of the cannon, cast under the inspection
of Colonel M --; a stuffed wild duck, and the curious fungus of a turnip: and,
for the latter, a miniature birch canoe, containing two or three rag
aboriginals with paddles, cut from a shingle. This last article, I confess,
would not disgrace the baby house of a child, if he was not above seven years
of age. To be more serious, I felt then for the reputation of the first
seminary of our land. Suppose a Raynal or Buffon should visit us; repair to the
museum of the university, eagerly inquiring after the natural productions and
original antiquities of our country, what must be the sensations of the
respectable rulers of the college, to be obliged to produce, to them, these
wretched, bauble specimens.

Asclepiades boasted that he had articled with fortune, not to be a physician.
RABELAIS.
ARGUMENT.
The Author mounteth his Nag, and sets out, full Speed, to seek Practice,
Fame, and Fortune, as a Country Practitioner.

IN the autumn of one thousand seven hundred and eighty five, I returned to my
parents, who received me with rapture. My father had reared, for me, a likely
pie bald mare. Our saddler equipped me with horse furniture, not forgetting the
little saddle bags, which I richly replenished with drugs, purchased at Boston.
With a few books, and my surgeon's instruments, in my portmanteau, and a few
dollars in my pocket, I sat out, with a light heart, to seek practice, fame,
and fortune, as a country practitioner.

My primary object was to obtain a place of settlement. This I imagined an easy
task, from my own acquirements, and the celebrity of my preceptor. My first
stop was at a new township, though tolerably well stocked with a hardy
laborious set of inhabitants. Five physicians of eminence had, within a few
years, attempted a settlement in this place. The first fell a sacrifice to
strong liquor; the second put his trust in horses, and was ruined, by the loss
of a valuable sire; the third quarrelled with the midwife, and was obliged to
remove; the fourth having prescribed, rather unluckily, for a young woman of
his acquaintance, grievously afflicted with a tympany, went to the Ohio; and
the last, being a prudent man, who sold his books and instruments for wild
land, and raised his own crop of medicine, was actually in the way of making a
great fortune; as, in only ten years practice, he left, at his decease, an
estate, both real and personal, which was appraised at one hundred pounds,
lawful money. This account was not likely to engage the attention of a young
man, upon whose education twice the sum had been expended.

In the next town, I was assured I might do well, as a physician, if I would
keep a grog shop, or let myself, as a labourer, in the hay season, and keep a
school in the winter. The first part of the proposition, I heard with patience;
but, at the bare mention of a school, I fled the town abruptly. In the
neighboring town, they did not want a physician, as an experienced itinerant
doctor visited the place, every March, when the people had most leisure to be
sick and take physic. He practiced with great success, especially in slow
consumptions, charged very low, and took his pay in any thing and every thing.
Besides, he carried a mould with him, to run pewter spoons, and was equally
good at mending a kettle and a constitution.

CHAP. XIX.

ARGUMENT.
The Author encountereth Folly, Ignorance, Impudence, Imbecility, and Quacks:
The Characters of a Learned, a Cheap, a Safe, and a Musical Doctor.

AT length, I fixed my residence in a town, where four physicians were already
in full practice, of such contrariety in theory, that I never knew any two of
them agree in any practice, but in abusing me, and decrying my skill. It was
however four months before I had any practice, except the extracting of a
tooth, from a corn fed girl, who spun at my lodgings, who used to look
wistfully at me, and ask, if the doctorer did not think the tooth ache a sign
of love? and say she felt dreadfully all over; and the application of a young
virgin, in the neighborhood, who wished to be favored with a private lecture
upon the virtues of the savin bush. I verily believe I might have remained
there to this day unemployed, if my landlord, a tavern keeper, finding my
payment for board rather tardy, had not, by sometimes sending his boy, in a
violent haste, to call me out of meeting, and always vowing I was cute at the
trade, at length drawn the attention of the people toward me.

I had now some opportunity of increasing my information, by inspecting the
practice of my seniors. The principal physician had been regularly educated. As
I had been likewise, he affected to pay me some attention, on purpose to
mortify those three quacks, who, he said, had picked up their knowledge, as
they did their medicine, by the way side. He was a very formal man, in manners
and practice. He viewed fresh air highly noxious, in all diseases. I once
visited a patient of his, in dog days, whose parched tongue and acrid skin
denoted a violent fever. I was almost suffocated, upon entering the room. The
windows were closed, and the cracks stuffed with tow; the curtains were drawn
close round the patient's bed, which was covered with a rug, and three
comfortable blankets; a large fire was made in the room; the door lifted, and
the key hole stopped; while the Doctor gravely administered irritating
stimulants to allay the fever. He carried a favorite practical author, in his
bags, and after finding the patient's case, in the index, pulled out a pair of
money scales, and, with the utmost nicety, weighed off the prescribed dose, to
the decimal of a dram. He told me, as a great secret, that about thirteen
years and one day past, he had nearly destroyed a patient, by administering
half a dram of pill cochia more than was prescribed in the books. He was
called the learned doctor.

The practice of the second town physician was directly opposite. He prescribed
large doses of the most powerful drugs. If he had been inclined to weigh his
medicine, I believe it would have been with gross weight, rather than troy. He
was an untaught disciple of the English Ratcliffe, careless, daring, and often
successful. He was admirable in nervous cases, rose cancers, and white
swellings. Upon the first symptoms of these stubborn disorders, he would drive
them, and the subjects of them, to a state of quiescence. He was called the
cheap doctor; because he always speedily cured or -- killed.

The third physician dealt altogether in simples. The only compound he ever
gave, or took, was buttered flip, for a cough. It was said, that, if he did no
good, he never did any harm. He was called the safe doctor.

The fourth physician was not celebrated for being learned, safe, or cheap; but
he had more practice than all the other three together, for he was a musical Do
not let guitars and fiddles possess thy brain, gentle reader. Musical, as here
used, is synonymous with entertaining or facetious,
man, and well gifted in prayer.

Sketch of an Hereditary Doctor, and a Literary Quack: Critical Operation in
Surgery.

THERE was another gentleman in town, who had some pretensions to the character
of a physician: even the same pretensions with the crowned heads of Europe, to
their wisdom, power, and greatness. He derived it from his birth; for he was
the seventh son of a seventh son, and his mother was a doctress. He did not
indeed bear the name or rank, but I remember him with the learned; as he was
sometimes called to visit a patient, at that critical, interesting period, when
the other physicians had given him over; but his ordinary practice lay wholly
among sheep, horses, and cattle. He also could boast of astonishing success,
and was as proud and opinionated as the best of them; and, for aught I know, it
was as instructive to hear him talk of his ringbones, wind galls, and spavins,
as to hear our first physician descant upon his paroxysms and peripneumony.

Being sent for, one day, to attend a man whose leg was said to be broken, by a
fall from a frame at a raising, I found, upon my arrival at the patient's, that
a brother of the faculty, from the vicinity, had arrived before me, and
completed the operation. He was celebrated for his skill in desperate cases;
and universally allowed to be a man of learning. He had prescribed a gill of
burnt brandy, with a pepper pod in it, to keep up the patient's spirits, under
the operation, and took another himself, to keep his hand steady. He splintered
the fractured limb, with the bone of two pair of old fashioned stays, he had
caused to be ripped to pieces and bound round the leg, with all the garters in
the neighborhood. He bowed gracefully, as I entered, and regretted extremely
that he had not my assistance in setting the bones; and with a loud voice, and
the most unparalleled assurance, began to lay the case before me, and amplify
the operation he had performed. Sir, said he, when I came to view the patient,
I had little hopes of saving his life. I found the two lesser bones of the leg,
the musa and the tristis shivered into a thousand splinters. While the larger
bone, the ambobus, had happily escaped unhurt. Perceiving I could scarce
refrain from laughing, and was about to speak; sir, said he, winking upon me, I
perceive you are one of us men of science, and I wish you to suspend your
opinion, until a private consultation; left our conversation may alarm the
patient too much, for you know, as the learned Galen observes, Omne quod exit
in Hum, seu Graecum, five Latinum
Esse genus neutrum, sic invariabile nomen.
By the way, mind, these learned languages are apt to make the professors of
them very thirsty. While the toddy was making, he proceeded. When I pondered
this perilous, piteous, pertinacious, pestiferous, petrifying case, I
immediately thought of the directions of the learned doctors Hudibras and
Mc'Fingal, not forgetting, as the wound was on the leg, the great Crookshank's
church history. When we had drunk our liquor, of which he took four fifths, by
his direction a new mug was made a little stronger, and we retired to our
consultation.

I am much obliged to you, said he, for not discovering my ignorance, to these
people; though, it is ten to one, if I had not rather convinced the blockheads
of yours, if you had attempted it. A regular bred physician, sometime since,
attempted this. He declared over the sick man's bed, that I was ignorant, and
presuming. I replied that he was a quack; and offered to leave our pretensions
to knowledge, to the company, which consisted of a midwife, two experienced
nurses, and some others, not so eminent for learning. He quoted Cullen and
Chesselden; and I Tully and Virgil. Until at length, when I had nearly
exhausted my stock of cant phrases, and he was gaining the attention of our
judges, I luckily bethought me of Lilly's Grammar. I began Propria quae
maribus; and before I had got twenty lines, the opinion of the audience was
apparently in my favor. They judged naturally enough, that I was the most
learned man, because the most unintelligible. This raised the doctor's ire so
much that from disputing me, he began to berate them for a parcel of fools,
sots, and old women, to put their lives in the hands of such an ignoramus as
me. This quickly decided the contest in my favor. The old nurses raised their
voices, the midwife her broom stick, and the whole train of mob caped judges,
their skinny fists, and we drove him out of the house in triumph. Our victory
was so complete, that, in the military style, we did not allow him to remain on
the field to bury his dead.

But it is time to tell you who I am. Sir, I drink your health. In brief, sir,
I am the son of a respectable clergyman, received a college education, entered
into merchandise, failed, and, by a train of misfortunes, was obliged to
commence doctor, for sustenance. I settled myself in this back country. At
first I was applied to chiefly, in desperate cases; where no reputation is
lost, if the patient dies, and much gained, if he recovers. I have performed
some surprising cures; but how I cannot tell you, except it was by allowing my
patients small beer, or any thing else they hankered after, which I have heard
was sometimes efficacious, in the crisis of a fever. But talking of drink, sir,
I wish your health. I believe I have never injured any persons, by my
prescriptions. A powdered, burnt crust, chalk, and juice of beets and carrots
are my most powerful medicines. We can be of mutual service to each other;
nurse, another mug. We doctors find this a very difficult case. As I have borne
down these country quacks, by superior effrontery, I can recommend you to full
practice. I will call you to consult with me, in difficult cases; for, as I was
saying, sir, I wish your good health, mine are all difficult cases; and you, in
return, shall lend me books, and give me such instructions as will enable me to
do good, as well as get fame and bread. The proposal was reasonable. I closed
with it. He emptied the third mug, and we returned to our patient. When the
dressings were removed, I discovered that there was not the slightest fracture
of the fibula or tibia; but only a slight contusion on the patula, which would
perhaps not have alarmed any other person, but our patient, who was a rich old
bachelor. I recommended an emollient, which my learned brother acquiesced in,
saying, with his usual air, that it was the very application he intended,
having applied the garters and whalebone, merely to concoct the tristis, the
musa and the ambobus firmly together.

A young girl, at the door, showed him a wound on her elbow, which she had
received in struggling about red ears at a husking; which he gravely pronounced
to be a testula in ano. This gentleman is really a man of abilities; has since
made valuable acquirements in the knowledge of the human machine, and the
materia medica. If he could be led to substitute the aquatic draughts of Doctor
Sangrado, as a succedaneum for the diffusible stimuli of Brown, he would become
useful in the faculty, and yet see happy days.

The doctor kept his word. He read my books, received my instructions, and
recommended me to his patients. But, as I copied my preceptor, in the
simplicity of my language I never attempted to excite the fear of my patients,
to magnify my skill; and could not reduce three fractured bones in a limb,
which contained but two. My advice was little attended to, except when backed
with that of my pupil, accompanied with frequent quotations from Lilly. He
obtained all the credit of our success; and the people generally supposed me a
young man of moderate talents, whom the learned doctor might make something of,
in a course of years.

ARGUMENT.
A Medical Consultation.

A MERRY incident gave a perfect insight into the practice of the several
physicians I have just eulogized. A drunken jockey, having fallen from his
horse, at a public review, was taken up senseless, and extended upon the long
table of the tavern. He soon recovered his breath, and groaned most piteously.
As his head struck the ground first, it was apprehended by some, unacquainted
with its solidity, that he had fractured his skull. The faculty hastened, from
all quarters, to his assistance. The learned, scrupulous physician, after
requesting that the doors and windows might be shut, approached the patient;
and, with a stately air, declined giving his opinion, as he had unfortunately
left at home his Pringle on contusions.

The cheap doctor immediately pronounced the wound a compound fracture,
prescribed half a dose of crude opium, and called for the trepanning
instruments.

The safe doctor proposed brown paper, dipped in rum and cobwebs, to staunch
the blood. The popular physician, the musical doctor, told us a jovial story;
and then suddenly relaxing his features, observed, that he viewed the groaning
wretch as a monument of justice: that he, who spent his days in tormenting
horses, should now, by the agency of the same animal, be brought to death's
door, an event, which he thought ought to be set home upon our minds by prayer.

While my new pupil, pressing through the crowd, begged that he might state the
case to the company; and, with an audible voice, winking upon me, began. The
learned doctor Nominativo Hoc Caput, in his treatise on brains, observes that,
the seat of the soul may be known, from the affections of the man. The
residence of a wife man's soul is in his ears; a glutton's, in his palate; a
gallant's, in his lips; and old maid's, in her tongue; a dancer's, in his toes;
a drunkard's, in his throat. By the way, landlord, give us a button of sling.
When we learned wish to know if a wound endangers life, we consequently inquire
into the affections of the patient, and see if the wound injures the seat of
his soul. If that escapes, however deep and ghastly the wound, we pronounce
life in no danger. A horse jockey's soul -- gentlemen, I wish your healths, is
in his heel, under the left spur. When I was pursuing my studies, in the
hospitals in England, I once saw seventeen horse jockies, some of whom were
noblemen, killed by the fall of a scaffold in Newmarket, and all wounded in the
heel. Twenty others, with their arms, backs, and necks broken, survived. I saw
one noble jockey, with his nominativo caret, which is Greek for a nobleman's
head, split entirely open. His brains ran down his face, like the white of a
broken egg; but, as his heel was unhurt, he survived; and his judgment in
horses is said not to be the least impaired. Come, pull off the patient's boot,
while I drink his better health. Charmed with the harrangue, some of the
spectators were about following his directions, when the other doctors
interfered. They had heard him, with disdainful impatience, and now each raised
his voice, to support his particular opinion, backed by his adherents. Bring
the brown paper -- compound fracture -- cobwebs I say -- hand the trepanning
instruments -- give us some tod, and pull off the boot, echoed from all
quarters. The landlord for bad quarrelling in his house. The whole company
rushed out, to form a ring on the green, for the medical professors; and they
to a consultation of fifty cuffs. The practitioner in sheep, horses, and
cattle, poured a dose of urine and molasses down the patient's throat; who soon
so happily recovered as to pursue his vocation, swop horses three times, play
twenty rubbers of all fours, and get dead drunk again before sunset.

AS my practice increased, my drugs decreased. At the expiration of eighteen

items. To present a doctor's bill, under seven years, or until my patients
died, in which I was not nigh so fortunate as my brother functioners, was
complete ruin to my future practice. To draw upon my father, who had already
done for me beyond his ability, was still worse. I had often heard the southern
states spoken of, as the high road to fortune. I was told that the inhabitants
were immensely opulent, paid high fees with profusion, and were extremely
partial to the characteristic industry of their New England brethren. By the
advice of our attorney, I lodged my account books in his office, with a general
power to collect. He advanced me a sum sufficient to pay my traveling expenses;
and, with my books and surgeon's instruments, I sat out, in the stage, for the
southward; condemning the illiberality and ignorance of our own people, which
prevented the due encouragement of genius, and made them the prey of quacks;
intending, after a few years of successful practice, to return in my own
carriage, and close a life of reputation and independence, in my native state.

Anecdotes of Doctor Benjamin Franklin, whom the Author visits in Philadelphia.

I CARRIED a request to the late Doctor Benjamin Franklin, then president of
the state of Pennsylvania, for certain papers, I was to deliver further
southward. I anticipated much pleasure, from the interview with this truly
great man: To see one, who, from small beginnings, by the sole exertion of
native genius, and indefatigable industry, had raised himself to the pinnacle
of politics and letters. a man, who, from an humble porter's boy, had elevated
himself to be the desirable companion of the great ones of the earth: who, from
trundling a wheelbarrow in bye lanes, had been advanced to pass in splendor,
through the courts of kings; and, from hawking vile ballads, to the contracting
and signing treaties, which gave peace and independence to three millions of
his fellow citizens, was a sight interesting in the extreme.

I found the doctor surrounded by company, most of whom were young people. He
received me with the attention due to a young stranger. He dispatched a person
for the papers I wanted; asked me politely to be seated; inquired after the
family I sprang from; and told me a pleasing anecdote of my brave ancestor,
Captain Underhill. I found, in the doctor, all that simplicity of language,
which is remarkable in the fragment of his life, published since his decease;
and which was conspicuous in my medical preceptor. I have since been in a room
a few hours with Governor Jay, of New York; have heard of the late Governor
Livingston, of New Jersey; and am now confirmed in the opinion, I have
suggested, that men of genuine merit, as they possess the essence, need not the
parade of great knowledge. A rich man is often plain in his attire, and the
man, who has abundant treasures of learning, simple in his manners and style.

The doctor, in early life, was economical from principle; in his latter days,
perhaps from habit. Poor Richard held the purse strings of the president of
Pennsylvania. Permit me to illustrate this observation, by an anecdote. Soon
after I was introduced, an airy, thoughtless relation, from a New England
state, entered the room. It seems he was on a party of pleasure, and had been
so much involved in it, for three weeks, as not to have paid his respects to
his venerable relative. The purpose of his present visit was, to solicit the
loan of a small sum of money, to enable him to pay his bills, and transport
himself home. He preluded his request, with a detail of embarrassments, which
might have befallen the most circumspect. He said that he had loaded a vessel
for B --, and as he did not deal on credit, had purchased beyond his current
cash, and could not readily procure a draft upon home. The doctor, inquiring
how much he wanted, he replied, with some hesitation, fifty dollars. The
benevolent old gentleman went to his escritoir, and counted him out an hundred.
He received them with many promises of punctual payment, and hastily took up
the writing implements, to draught a note of hand, for the cash. The doctor,
who saw into the nature of the borrower's embarrassments, better than he was
aware; and was possessed with the improbability of ever recovering his cash
again, stepped across the room, laying his hand gently upon his cousin's arm,
said, stop cousin, we will save the paper; a quarter of a sheet is not of great
value, but it is worth saving: conveying, at once, a liberal gift and gentle
reprimand for the borrower's prevarication and extravagance. Since I am talking
of Franklin, the reader may be as unwilling to leave him as I was. Allow me to
relate another anecdote. I do not recollect how the conversation was
introduced; but a young person in company, mentioned his surprise, that the
possession of great riches should ever be attended with such anxiety and
solicitude; and instanced Mr. R -- M --, who, he said, though in possession of
unbounded wealth, yet was as busy and more anxious, than the most assiduous
clerk in his counting house. The doctor took an apple from a fruit basket, and
presented it to a little child, who could just totter about the room. The child
could scarce grasp it in his hand. He then gave it another, which occupied the
other hand. Then choosing a third, remarkable for its size and beauty, he
presented that also. The child, after many ineffectual attempts to hold the
three, dropped the last on the carpet, and burst into tears. See there, said
the philosopher; there is a little man, with more riches than he can enjoy.

Religious Exercises in a Southern State.

IN one of the states, southward of Philadelphia, I was invited, on a sunday,
to go to church. I will not say which, as I am loath to offend; and our
fashionable fellow citizens of the south arm of the union may not think divine
service any credit to them. My friend apologized for inviting me to so hum drum
an amusement, by assuring me, that immediately after service, there was to be a
famous match run for a purse of a thousand dollars, besides private bets,
between 'Squire L's imported horse, Slammerkin, and Colonel F's bay mare, Jenny
Driver. When we arrived at the church, we found a brilliant collection of well
dressed people, anxiously waiting the arrival of the parson, who, it seems, had
a small branch of the river M -- to pass; and, we afterward learned, was
detained by the absence of his negro boy, who was to ferry him over. Soon
after, our impatience was relieved, by the arrival of the parson, in his
canonicals: a young man, not of the most mortified countenance, who, with a
switch, called supple jack, in his hand, belabored the back and head of the
faulty slave, all the way from the water to the church door; accompanying every
stroke, with suitable language. He entered the church, and we followed. He
ascended the reading desk, and, with his face glowing with the exercise of his
supple jack, began the service with, I said I will take heed unto my ways, that
I sin not with my tongue. I will keep my tongue as it were with a bridle, when
I am before the wicked. When I mused the fire burned within me, and I spoke
with my tongue, etc. etc. He preached an animated discourse, of eleven minutes,
upon the practical duties of religion, from these words, remember the sabbath
day, to keep it holy; and read the fourth commandment, in the communion. The
whole congregation prayed fervently, that their hearts might be inclined to
keep this holy law. The blessing was pronounced; and parson and people hastened
to the horse race. I found the parson as much respected on the turf, as upon
the hassoc. He was one of the judges of the race; descanted, in the language of
the turf, upon the points of the two rival horses, and the sleeve of his cassoc
was heavy laden, with the principal bets. The confidence of his parishioners
was not ill founded; for they assured me, upon oath and honor, that he was a
gentleman, of as much uprightness as his grace the archbishop of Canterbury.
Ay, they would sport him for a sermon or a song, against any parson in the
union.

The whole of this extraordinary scene was novel to me. Besides, a certain
staple of New England I had with me, called conscience, made my situation, in
even the passive part I bore in it, so awkward and uneasy, that I could not
refrain from observing to my friend my surprise at the parson's conduct, in
chastising his servant immediately before divine service. My friend was so
happily influenced by the habits of these liberal, enlightened people, that he
could not even comprehend the tendency of my remark. He supposed it levelled at
the impropriety, not of the minister, but the man; not at the act, but the
severity of the chastisement; and observed, with warmth, that the parson served
the villain right, and, that if he had been his slave, he would have killed the
black rascal, if he was sure he should have to pay an hundred guineas to the
public treasury for him. I will note here, that the reader is requested,
whenever he meets with quotations of speeches, in the above scenes, excepting
those during divine service, that he will please, that is, if his habits of
life will permit, to interlard those quotations with about as many oaths, as
they contain monosylables. He may rest assured, that it will render the scene
abundantly more natural. It is true, I might have inserted them myself, and
supported thus doing, by illustrations and parodies from grave authors; but I
never swear profanely myself, and I think it almost as bad to oblige my readers
to purchase the imprecations of others. I give this hint of the introduction of
oaths, for the benefit of my readers to the southward of Philadelphia; who,
however they may enjoy a scene, which reflects such honor upon their country,
when seasoned with these palatable expletives, without them perhaps would
esteem it as tasteless and vapid, as a game at cards or billiards, without
bets; or boiled veal or turkey, without ham.

Success of the Doctor's southern Expedition: He is in Distress: Contemplates a
School: Prefers a Surgeon's Birth, on board a Ship, bound to Africa, Via London.

I FOUND the southern states not more engaging, to a young practitioner, than
the northern. In the sea ports of both, the business was engrossed by men of
established practice and eminence. In the interior country, the people could
not distinguish, or encourage merit. The gains were small, and tardily
collected; and, in both wings of the union, and I believe every where else,
fortune and fame are generally to be acquired in the learned professions,
solely, by a patient, undeviating application to local business.

If dissipation could have afforded pleasure, to a mind yearning after
professional fame and independence, I might, so long as my money lasted, have
been happy, at the southward. I was often invited to the turf; and, might have
had the honor of being intoxicated frequently, with the most respectable
characters. An association with the well educated of the other sex was not so
readily attained. There was a haughty reserve, in the manners of the young
ladies. Every attempt at familiarity, in a young stranger, habituated to the
social, but respectful intercourse, customary in the northern states, excited
alarm. With my New England ideas, I could not help viewing, in the anxious
efforts of their parents and relatives, to repel every approach to innocent and
even chastened intercourse, a strong suspicion of that virtue, they were
solicitous to protect.

Depressed by the gloomy view of my prospects; and determined never to face my
parents again, under circumstances, which would be burdensome to them, I
attempted to obtain practice in the town of F --, in Virginia, but in vain. The
very decorum, prudence, and economy, which would have enhanced my character at
home, were here construed into poverty of spirit. To obtain medical practice,
it was expedient, to sport, bet, drink, swear, etc. with my patients. My purse
forbad the former; my habits of life the latter. My cash wasted, and I was near
suffering. I was obliged to dispose of my books, for present subsistence; and,
in that country, books were not the prime articles of commerce. To avoid
starving, I again contemplated keeping a school. In that country, knowledge was
viewed as a handicraft trade. The school masters, before the war, had been
usually collected from unfortunate European youth, of some school learning,
sold for their passage into America. So that to purchase a school master and a
negro was almost synonimous. Mr. J -- n, and some other citizens of the world,
who had been cast among them, had by their writings, influence, and example,
brought the knowledge of letters into some repute, since the revolution; but, I
believe, those excellent men have yet to lament the general inefficacy of their
liberal efforts. This statement, and my own prior experience in school keeping,
would have determined me rather to have prefered laboring, with the slaves on
their plantations, than sustaining the slavery and contempt of a school.

When reduced to my last dollar; and beginning to suffer, from the
embarrassments of debt, I was invited, by a sea captain, who knew my friends,
to accept the birth of surgeon, in his ship. Every new pursuit has its
flattering prospects. I was encouraged by handsome wages, and a privilege in
the ship, to carry an adventure; for the purchase of which, the owners were to
advance me, on account of my pay. I was to be companion to the captain, and
have a fine chance of seeing the world. To quit my home, for all parts of the
union I considered as home; to tempt the perilous ocean, and encounter the
severities of a sea faring life, the diseases of torrid climes, and perhaps a
total separation from my friends and parents, was melancholy; but the desire to
see the world, to acquire practical knowledge, in my profession, to obtain
property, added to the necessity of immediate subsistence, and the horrors of
a jail, determined me to accept his offer. I accordingly entered surgeon, on
board the ship Freedom, Captain Sidney Russell commander, freighted with
tobacco, bound to London, and thence to the coast of Africa. I had little to do
in my passage to London. My destination, as a surgeon, being principally in the
voyage from that city to the African coast, and thence to the West Indies; and,
if I had not suffered from a previous nausea or sea sickness, the novelty of
the scene would have rendered me tolerably happy. In the perturbation of my
thoughts, I had omitted writing to my parents of the places of my destination.
This careless omission afterward, caused them and me much trouble. We arrived
safely in the Downs.

of pensioners and place men, in every comfort, convenience, or even necessary
of life they partake; who are entangled by innumerable penal laws, to the
breach of which, banishment and the gallows are almost universally annexed; a
motley race, in whose mongrel veins runs the blood of all nations, speaking
with pointed contempt of the fat burgo master of Amsterdam, the cheerful French
peasant, the hardy tiller of the Swiss cantons, and the independent farmer of
America; rotting in dungeons, languishing wretched lives in soetid jails, and
boasting of the GLORIOUS FREEDOM OF ENGLISHMEN: hereditary senators, ignorant
and inattentive to the welfare of their country, and unacquainted with the
geography of its foreign possessions; and politicians, in coffee houses,
without one foot of soil, or one guinea in their pockets, vaunting, with
national pride, of our victories, our colonies, our minister, our magna charta,
and our constitution! I could not refrain from adopting the language of Doctor
Young, and exclaiming in parody, How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,
How complicate, how wonderful are Britons!
How passing wonder they who made them such,
Who centered in their make such strange extremes
Of different nations, marvelously mixed,
Connection exquisite of distant climes,
As men, trod worms, as Englishmen, high gods.

The Author passes by the Lions in the Tower, and the other Insignia of
British Royalty, and sees a greater Curiosity, called Thomas Pain, Author of
the Rights of Man: Description of his Person, Habit, and Manners: In this
Chapter due meed is rendered to a great American Historical Painter, and a
prose Palinode over our lack of the Fine Arts.

OMITTING the lions in the tower, the regalia in the jewel office, and the
other insignia of British royalty, of which Englishmen are so justly proud, I
shall content myself, with mentioning the most singular curiosity, I saw in
London. It was the celebrated Thomas Pain, author of Common Sense, the Rights
of Man, and other writings, whose tendency is to overturn ancient opinions of
government and religion.

I met this interesting personage, at the lodgings of the son of a late
patriotic American governor; whose genius, in the fine art of historical
painting, whose forty at Gibralter, whose flowing drapery, faithful and bold
expression, in the portraits of our beloved president, and other leaders, both
military and political, in our glorious revolution; when the love of the fine
arts shall be disseminated in our land, will leave posterity to regret and
admire the imbecility of contemporary patronage.

Thomas Pain resembled the great apostle to the Gentiles, not more in his zeal
and subtlety of argument, than in personal appearance; for, like that fervid
apostle, his bodily presence was both mean and contemptible. When I saw him, he
was dressed in a snuff colored coat, olive velvet vest, drab breeches, coarse
hose. His shoe buckles of the size of half a dollar. A bob tailed wig covered
that head, which worked such mickle woe to courts and kings. If I should
attempt to describe it, it would be in the same style and principle, with which
the veteran soldier bepraiseth an old standard: the more tattered, the more
glorious. It is probable that this was the same identical wig, under the shadow
of whose curls, he wrote Common Sense in America, many years before. He was a
spare man, rather under size; subject to the extreme of low, and highly
exhilirated spirits; often sat reserved in company; seldom mingled in common
chit chat. But when a man of sense and elocution was present, and the company
numerous, he delighted in advancing the most unaccountable, and often the most
whimsical, paradoxes; which he defended in his own plausible manner. If
encouraged by success, or the applause of the company, his countenance was
animated, with an expression of feature, which, on ordinary occasions, one
would look for in vain, in a man so much celebrated for acuteness of thought;
but if interrupted by extraneous observation, by the inattention of his
auditory, or in an irritable moment, even by the accidental fall of the poker,
he would retire into himself, and no persuasions could induce him to proceed
upon the most favorite topic.

ARGUMENT.
Curious Argument, between Thomas Pain and the noted Peter Pindar: Peter
sets a Wit Noose, and catches Thomas, in one of his own Logic Traps.

I HEARD Thomas Pain once assert, in the presence of Mr. Wolcott, better
known, in this country, by the facetious name of Peter Pindar, that the
minority, in all deliberative bodies, ought, in all cases, to govern the
majority. Peter smiled. You must grant me, said Uncommon Sense, that the
proportion of men of sense, to the ignorant among mankind, is at least as
twenty, thirty, or even forty nine, to an hundred. The majority of mankind are
consequently most prone to error; and, if we would atchieve right, the
minority ought, in all cases, to govern. Peter continued to smile archly. If we
look to experience, continued Pain, for there are no conclusions I more prize
than those drawn, not from speculation, but plain matter of fact, we shall find
an examination into the debates of all deliberative bodies, in our favor. To
proceed no farther than your country, Mr. Wolcott, I love to look at home.
Suppose the resolutions of the houses of lords and commons had been determined
by this salutary rule; why, the sensible minority would have governed. George
Washington would have been a private citizen; and the United States of America
mere colonies, dependent on the British crown. As a patriotic Englishman, will
you not confess, that this would have been better than to have these United
States independent, with the illustrious Washington at their head, by their
wisdom confounding the juggling efforts of your ministry to embroil them; and
to have the comfortable prospect before you, that from the extent of their
territory, their maritime resource, their natural increase, the asylum they
offer to emigrants, in the course of two centuries, Scotland and Ireland, if
the United States have not too much real pride to attempt it, may be reduced to
the same dependence upon them, as your West India islands now have upon you:
and even England, haughty England, thrown in as a make weight, in the future
treaty between them and the French nation. Peter, who had listened with great
seeming attention, now mildly replied. I will not say but that your arguments
are cogent, though not entirely convincing. As it is a subject rather out of my
line, I will, for form sake, hold the negative of your proposition, and leave
it to the good company, which is right. Agreed, said Pain, who saw himself
surrounded by his admirers. Well, gentlemen, said Peter, with all the gravity
of a speaker of the house of commons; you, that are of the opinion that the
minority, in all deliberative bodies, ought, in all cases, to govern the
majority, please to rise in the affirmative. Pain immediately stood up
himself, and, as he had foreseen, we all rose in his favor. Then I rise in the
negative, cried Peter. I am the wise minority, who ought, in all cases, to
govern your ignorant majority; and, consequently, upon your own principles, I
carry the vote. Let it be recorded.

This unexpected maneuver raised a hearty laugh. Pain retired from the
presence of triumphant wit, mortified with being foiled at his own weapons.

ARGUMENT.
Reasonable Conjectures upon the Motives, which induced Thomas Pain to write
that little Book, called the Age of Reason.

IN the frequent interviews I had with this celebrated republican apostle, I
never heard him express the least doubt of, or cast the smallest reflection
upon revealed religion. He spoke of the glowing expressions of the Jewish
prophets with fervor; and had quoted liberally from the scriptures, in his
Common Sense. How he came to write that unreasonable little pamphlet, called
the Age of Reason, I am at a loss to conjecture. The probable opinion
attributes it to his passion for paradox; that this small morsel of infidelity
was offered as a sacrifice to save his life from the devouring cruelty of
Roberspierre, that Moloch of the French nation. It probably had its desired
effect; for annihilating revealed religion could not but afford a diabolical
pleasure, to that ferocious wretch and his inhuman associates, who could not
expect a sanction for their cruelties, while the least vestige of any thing
sacred remained among men.

When the reign of the terrorists ceased, an apology was expected; and, even by
the pious, yet catholic American, would have been received. To the offended
religion of his country no propitiatory sacrifice was made. This missionary of
vice has proceeded proselyting. He has added second parts, and made other, and
audacious adjuncts to deism. No might nor greatness escapes him. He has
vilified a great prophet, the savior of the Gentiles; he has railed at
Washington, a savior of his country. A tasteful, though irreligious scholar
might tolerate a chastised skepticism, if exhibited by an acute Hume, or an
eloquent Boling broke. But one cannot repress the irritability of the fiery
Hotspur, when one beholds the pillars of morality shaken by the rude shock of
this modern vandal. The reader should learn, that his paltry system is only an

outrage of wine; and that it is in the ale house, he most vigorously assaults
the authority of the prophets, and laughs most loudly at the gospel, when in

I have perserved an epigram of Peter Pindar's, written, originally, in a blank
leaf of a copy of Paine's Age of Reason, and not inserted in any of his works.

Tommy Pain wrote this book to prove that the bible
Was an old woman's dream of fancies most idle;
That Solomon's proverbs were made by low livers,
That prophets were fellows, who sang semiquavers;
That religion and miracles all were a jest,
And the Devil in torment a tale of the priest.

Yet we all must allow that the DEVIL'S IN PAIN.

THE COMPLAINT.
ARGUMENT.
The Author sails for the Coast of Africa: Manner of purchasing Negro Slaves.

ON the eighteenth of July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty eight, I
received orders, from my captain, to join the ship in the Downs. I accordingly
took passage in a post chaise; and, after a rapid journey of seventy four
miles, arrived, the same afternoon at Deal; and the next morning entered as
surgeon, on board the ship Sympathy, of three hundred tons, and thirty eight
men, Captain Sydney Russell commander; bound to the coast of Africa, thence to
Barbados, and to South Carolina with a cargo of slaves.

We were favored with a clear sky and pleasant gales; and, after a short and
agreeable voyage, we touched at Porto Santo, one of the Madeira isles; where we
watered and supplied ourselves with fresh provisions in abundance, to which the
captain added, at my request, a quantity of Madeira, malmsey, and tent wines,
for the sick. We had a fine run, from the Madeiras to the Canary isles. The
morning after we sailed, I was highly gratified with a full view of the island
and peak of Teneriff; which made its appearance the day before, rising above
the ocean, at one hundred miles distance. We anchored off Fuertuventura one of
the Canaries, in a good bottom. I went on shore, with the mate, to procure
green vegetables; as I ever esteemed them the specific for that dreadful sea
disorder, the scurvy. Before we had reached the Madeiras, though I had stored
our medicine chest with the best antiscorbutics, and we had a plenty of dried
vegetables on board, yet the scurvy had began to infect us. A plentiful
distribution of green vegetables, after our arrival at Porto Santo, soon
expelled it from the crew. At Fuertuventura, I was delighted with the wild
notes of the Canary bird, far surpassing the most excellent of those I had seen
in cages, in the United States.

I was anxious to visit the Cape de Verd islands; but, our course being too far
east, we ran down to the little island of Coree, to which the contentious of
the English and French crowns have annexed its only importance. The French
officers received us with politeness, and were extremely anxious for news, from
their parent country. Soon after, we dropped anchor off Loango city, upon a small
well peopled island, near the coast of Congo or lower Guinea, in possession of
the Portuguese. Our captain carried his papers on shore, and, the next day,
weighed anchor and stood in for the continent. All hands were now employed to
unlade the ship, and the cargo was deposited in a Portuguese factory, at a
place called Cacongo, near the mouth of the river Zaire. The day after our
arrival at Cacongo, several Portuguese and Negro merchants, hardly
distinguishable however, by their manners, employments, or complexions, came to
confer with the captain, about the purchase of our cargo of slaves. They
contracted to deliver him two hundred and fifty head of slaves, in fifteen
days' time. To hear these men converse upon the purchase of human beings, with
the same indifference, and nearly in the same language, as if they were
contracting for so many head of cattle or swine, shocked me exceedingly. But,
when I suffered my imagination to rove to the habitation of these victims to
this infamous, cruel commerce, and fancied that I saw the peaceful husbandman
dragged from his native farm; the fond husband torn from the embraces of his
beloved wife; the mother, from her babes; the tender child, from the arms of
its parent; and all the tender, endearing ties of natural and social affection
rended by the hand of avaricious violence, my heart sunk within me. I execrated
myself, for even the involuntary part I bore in this execrable traffic: I
thought of my native land and blushed. When the captain kindly inquired of me
how many slaves I thought my privilege in the ship entitled me to transport,
for my adventure, I rejected my privilege, with horror; and declared I would
sooner suffer servitude than purchase a slave. This observation was received in
the great cabin with repeated bursts of laughter, and excited many a stroke of
coarse ridicule. Captain Russell observed, that he would not insist upon my
using my privilege, if I had so much of the yankee about me. Here is my clerk,
Ned Randolph, will jump at the chance; though the rogue has been rather unlucky
in the trade. Out of five and twenty negroes he purchased, he never carried but
one alive to port; and that poor devil was broken winded, and he was obliged to
sell him for half price in Antigua.

Punctual to the day of the delivery, the contractors appeared, and brought
with them about one hundred and fifty negroes, men, women, and children. The
men were fastened together, in pairs, by a bar of iron, with a collar to
receive the neck at each extremity; a long pole passing over their shoulder,
and between each two, bound by a staple and ring, through which the pole was
thrust, and thus twenty, and sometimes thirty, were connected together; while
their conductors incessantly applied the scourge to those, who loitered, or
sought to strangle themselves, by lifting their feet from the ground in
despair, which sometimes had been successfully attempted. The women and
children were bound with cords, and driven forward by the whip. When they
arrived at the factory, the men were unloosed from the poles; but still chained
in pairs, and turned into strong cells, built for the purpose. The dumb sorrow
of some, the frenzy of others, the sobbings and tears of the children, and
shrieks of the women, when they were presented to our captain, so affected me
that I was hastening from this scene of barbarity, on board the ship; when I
was called by the mate, and discovered, to my surprise and horror, that, by my
station in the ship, I had a principal and active part of this inhuman
transaction imposed upon me. As surgeon, it was my duty to inspect the bodies
of the slaves, to see, as the captain expressed himself, that our owners were
not shammed off with unsound flesh. In this inspection, I was assisted by
Randolph the clerk, and two stout sailors. It was transacted with all that
unfeeling insolence, which wanton barbarity can inflict upon defenseless
wretchedness. The man, the affrighted child, the modest matron, and the timid
virgin were alike exposed to this severe scrutiny, to humanity and common
decency equally insulting.

I cannot reflect on this transaction yet without shuddering. I have deplored
my conduct with tears of anguish; and, I pray a merciful God, the common parent
of the great family of the universe, who has made of one flesh and one blood
all nations of the earth, that the miseries, the insults, and cruel woundings,
I afterward received, when a slave myself, may expiate for the inhumanity, I
was necessitated to exercise, toward these MY BRETHREN OF THE HUMAN RACE.

ARGUMENT.
Treatment of the Slaves, on board the Ship.

OF one hundred and fifty Africans we rejected seventeen, as not merchantable.
While I was doubting which to lament most, those, who were about being
precipitated into all the miseries of an American slavery, or those, whom we
had rejected, as too wretched for slaves; Captain Russell was congratulating
the slave contractors, upon the immense good luck they had, in not suffering
more by this lot of human creatures. I understood that, what from wounds
received by some of these miserable creatures, at their capture, or in their
violent struggles for liberty, or attempts at suicide; with the fatigue of a
long journey, partly over the burning sands of a sultry climate, it was usual
to estimate the loss, in the passage to the sea shore, at twenty five per cent.

No sooner was the purchase completed, than these wretched Africans were
transported in herds aboard the ship, and immediately precipitated between
decks, where a strong chain, attached to a staple in the lower deck, was
rivetted to the bar, before described; and then the men were chained in pairs,
and also hand cuffed, and two sailors with cutlasses guarded every twenty:
while the women and children were tied together in pairs with ropes, and
obliged to supply the men with provisions, and the flush bucket; or, if the
young women were released, it was only to gratify the brutal lust of the
sailors; for though I cannot say I ever was witness to an actual rape, yet the
frequent shrieks of these forlorn females in the births of the seamen, left me
little charity to doubt of the repeated commission of that degrading crime. The
eve after we had received the slaves on board, all hands were piped on deck,
and ordered to assist in manufacturing and knotting cat o'nine tails, the
application of which, I was informed, was always necessary to bring the slaves
to their appetite. The night after they came on board was spent by these
wretched people, in sobbings, groans, tears, and the most heart rending bursts
of sorrow and despair. The next morning all was still. Surprised by this
unexpected silence, I almost hoped that providence, in pity to these her
miserable children, had permitted some kindly suffocation to put a period to
their anguish. It was neither novel nor unexpected to the ship's crew. It is
only the dumb fit come on, cried every one. We will cure them. After breakfast,
the whole ship's crew went between decks, and carried with them the provisions
for the slaves, which they one and all refused to eat. A more affecting group
of misery was never seen. These injured Africans, prefering death to slavery,
or perhaps buoyed above the fear of dissolution, by their religion, which
taught them to look with an eye of faith to a country beyond the grave; where
they should again meet those friends and relatives, from whose endearments they
had been torn; and where no fiend should torment, or christian thirst for gold,
had, wanting other means, resolved to starve themselves, and every eye lowered
the fixed resolve of this deadly intent. In vain were the men beaten. They
refused to taste one mouthful; and, I believe, would have died under the
operation, if the ingenious cruelty of the clerk, Randolph, had not suggested
the plan of whipping the women and children in sight of the men; assuring the
men they should be tormented until all had eaten. What the torments, exercised
on the bodies of these brave Africans, failed to produce, the feelings of
nature effected. The Negro, who could undauntedly expire under the anguish of
the lash, could not view the agonies of his wife, child, or his mother; and,
though repeatedly encouraged by these female sufferers, unmoved by their
torments, to persevere unto death; yet, though the man dared to die, the father
relented, and in a few hours they all eat their provisions, mingled with their
tears.

Our slave dealers being unable to fulfill their contract, unless we tarried
three weeks longer, our captain concluded to remove to some other market. We
accordingly weighed anchor, and steered for Benin, and anchored in the river
Formosa, where we took in one hundred and fifteen more slaves. The same process
in the purchase was pursued here; and, though I frequently assured the captain,
as a physician, that it was impracticable to stow fifty more persons between
decks, without endangering health and life, the whole hundred and fifteen were
thrust, with the rest, between decks. The stagnant confined air of this
infernal hole, rendered more deleterious by the stench of the faeces, and
violent perspiration of such a crowd, occasioned putrid diseases; and, even
while in the mouth of the Formosa, it was usual to throw one or two Negro
corpses over every day. It was in vain I remonstrated to the captain. In vain I
enforced the necessity of more commodious births, and a more free influx of air
for the slaves. In vain I represented, that these miserable people had been
used to the vegetable diet, and pure air of a country life. That at home they
were remarkable for cleanliness of person, the very rites of their religion
consisting, almost entirely, in frequent ablutions. The captain was, by this
time, prejudiced against me. He observed that he did not doubt my skill, and
would be bound by my advice, as to the health of those on board his ship, when
he found I was actuated by the interest of the owners; but, he feared, that I
was now moved by some yankee nonsense about humanity.

Randolph, the clerk, blamed me in plain terms. He said he had made seven
African voyages, and with as good surgeons as I was; and that it was their
common practice, when an infectious disorder prevailed, among the slaves, to
make critical search for all those, who had the slightest symptoms of it, or
whose habits of body inclined them to it; to tie them up and cast them over the
ship side together, and thus, at one dash, to purify the ship. What signifies,
added he, the lives of the black devils; they love to die. You cannot please
them better, than by chucking them into the water.

When we stood out to sea, the rolling of the vessel brought on the sea
sickness, which increased the filth; the weather being rough, we were obliged
to close some of the ports, which ventilated the space between decks; and death
raged dreadfully among the slaves. Above two thirds were diseased. It was
affecting to observe the ghastly smile on the countenance of the dying African,
as if rejoicing to escape the cruelty of his oppressors. I noticed one man, who
gathered all his strength, and, in one last effort, spoke with great emphasis,
and expired. I understood, by the linguist, that, with his dying breath, he
invited his wife, and a boy and girl to follow him quickly, and slaken their
thirst with him at the cool streams of the fountain of their Great Father,
beyond the reach of the wild white beasts. The captain was now alarmed for the
success of his voyage; and, upon my urging the necessity of landing the slaves,
he ordered the ship about, and we anchored near an uninhabited part of the gold
coast. I conjecture not far from Cape St. Paul.

Tents were erected on the shore, and the sick landed. Under my direction, they
recovered surprisingly. It was affecting to see the effect gentle usage had
upon these hitherto sullen, obstinate people. As I had the sole direction of
the hospital, they looked on me as the source of this sudden transition from
the filth and rigor of the ship, to the cleanliness and kindness of the shore.
Their gratitude was excessive. When they recovered so far as to walk out, happy
was he, who could, by picking a few berries, gathering the wild fruits of the
country, or doing any menial services, manifest his affection for me. Our
linguist has told me, he has often heard them, behind the bushes, praying to
their God for my prosperity, and asking him with earnestness, why he put my
good black soul into a white body. In twelve days all the convalescents were
returned to the ship, except five, who staid with me on shore, and were to be
taken on board the next day.

CHAP. XXXII.

Stripes and a dungeon.
COWPER.
ARGUMENT.
The Author taken Captive by the Algerines.

NEAR the close of the fourteenth of November, one thousand seven hundred and
eighty eight, as the sun was sinking behind the mountains of Fundia, I sat at
the door of my tent, and perceived our ship, which lay at one mile's distance,
getting under way, apparently in great haste. The jolly boat, about ten minutes
before, had made toward the shore; but was recalled by a musket shot from the
ship. Alarmed by this unexpected maneuver, I ran to the top of a small hill,
back of the hospital, and plainly discovered a square rigged vessel in the
offing, endeavoring to lock our ship within the land; but a land breeze
springing up from the north east, which did not extend to the strange vessel,
and our ship putting out all her light sails, being well provided with king
sail, scudding sails, water sails, and driver, I could perceive she out sailed
her. It was soon so dark that I lost sight of both, and I passed a night of
extreme anxiety, which was increased by, what I conjectured to be, the flashes
of guns in the south west; though at too great distance for me to hear the
reports.

The next morning no vessels were to be seen on the coast, and the ensuing day
was spent in a state of dreadful suspense. Although I had provisions enough
with me for some weeks, and was sheltered by our tents, yet to be separated
from my friends and country, perhaps forever, and to fall into the hands of the
barbarous people, which infested this coast, was truly alarming. The five
Africans, who were with me, could not conceal their joy, at the departure of
the ship. By signs they manifested their affection toward me; and, when I
signified to them that the vessel was gone not to return, they clapped their
hands, and pointing inland, signified a desire to convey me to their native
country, where they were sure I should be happy. By their consultation, I could
see that they were totally ignorant of the way. On the third day toward
evening, to my great joy, I saw a sail approaching the shore, at the prospect
of which my African associates, manifested every sign of horror. I immediately
concluded that no great blame would arise, from my not detaining five men, in
the absence of the ship; and I intimated to them that they might conceal
themselves in the brush and escape. Four quitted me; but one, who made me
comprehend, that he had a beloved son among the slaves, refused to go,
prefering the company of his child, and slavery itself, to freedom and the land
of his nativity. I retired to rest, pleased with the imagination of soon
rejoining my friends, and proceeding to my native country. On the morning of
the fourth day, as I was sleeping in my tent with the affectionate negro at my
feet, I was suddenly awakened, by the blowing of conch shells, and the sound of
uncouth voices. I arose to dress myself, when the tent was overset, and I
received a blow from the back of a sabre, which levelled me to the earth; and
was immediately seized and bound by several men of sallow and fierce demeanor,
in strange habits, who spoke a language I could not comprehend. With the negro,
tents, baggage, and provisions, I was carried to the boat, which, being loaded,
was immediately pushed off from the shore, and rowed toward a vessel, which I
now, for the first time, noticed, and had no doubt but it was the same, which
was in pursuit of the Sympathy. She was rigged differently from any I had ever
seen, having two masts, a large square main sail, another of equal size, seized
by the middle of a main yard to her fore mast, and, what the sailors call, a
shoulder of mutton sail abaft; which, with top sails and two banks of oars,
impelled her through the water with amazing velocity: though, from the
clumsiness of her rigging, an American seaman would never have pronounced her a
good sea boat. On her main mast head was a broad black pennant, with a half
moon, or rather crescent, and a drawn sabre, in white and red, emblazoned in
the middle. The sides of the vessel were manned as we approached, and a tackle
being let down, the hook was attached to the cord, which bound me, and I was
hoisted on board in the twinkling of an eye. Then, being unbound, I was carried
upon the quarter deck, where a man, who appeared to be the captain, glittering
in silks, pearl, and gold, set cross legged upon a velvet cushing to receive
me. He was nearly encircled by a band of men, with monstrous tufts of hair on
their upper lips, dressed in habits of the same mode with their leader's, but
of coarser contexture, with drawn scimitars in their hands, and by his side a
man of lighter complexion, who, by the captain's command, inquired of me, in
good English, if I was an Englishman. I replied I was an American, a citizen of
the United States. This was no sooner interpreted to the captain than, at a
disdainful nod of his head, I was again seized, hand cuffed, and thrust into a
dirty hole in the fore castle, where I lay twenty four hours, without straw to
sleep on, or any thing to eat or drink. The treatment we gave the unhappy
Africans, on board the Sympathy, now came full into my mind; and, what was the
more mortifying, I discovered that the negro who was, captured with me, was at
liberty, and fared as well as the sailors on board the vessel. I had not
however been confined more than one half hour, when the interpreter came to
examine me privately respecting the destination of the ship, to which he
suspected I belonged; was anxious to know if she had her full cargo of slaves;
what was her force; whether she had English papers on board; and if she did not
intend to stop at some other African port. From him I learned that I was
captured by an Algerine Rover, Hamed Hali Saad captain; and should be carried
into slavery at Algiers. After I had lain twenty four hours in this loathsome
place, covered with vermin, parched with thirst, and fainting with hunger, I
was startled at a light, let through the hatchway, which opened softly, and a
hand presented me a cloth, dripping with cold water, in which a small quantity
of boiled rice was wrapped. The door closed again softly, and I was left to
enjoy my good fortune in the dark. If Abraham had indeed sent Lazarus to the
rich man, in torment, it appears to me, he could not have received a greater
pleasure, from the cool water on his tongue, than I experienced, in sucking the
moisture from this cloth. The next day, the same kindly hand appeared again,
with the same refreshment. I begged to see my benefactor. The door opened
further, and I saw a countenance in tears. It was the face of the grateful
African, who was taken with me. I was oppressed with gratitude. Is this,
exclaimed I, one of those men, whom we are taught to vilify as beneath the
human species, who brings me sustenance, perhaps at the risk of his life, who
shares his morsel with one of those barbarous men, who had recently torn him
from all he held dear, and whose base companions are now transporting his
darling son to a grievous slavery? Grant me, I ejaculated, once more to taste
the freedom of my native country, and every moment of my life shall be
dedicated to preaching against this detestable commerce. I will fly to our
fellow citizens in the southern states; I will, on my knees, conjure them, in
the name of humanity, to abolish a trafic, which causes it to bleed in every
pore. If they are deaf to the pleadings of nature, I will conjure them, for the
sake of consistency, to cease to deprive their fellow creatures of freedom,
which their writers, their orators, representatives, senators, and even their
constitutions of government, have declared to be the unalienable birth right of
man. My sable friend had no occasion to visit me a third time; for I was taken
from my confinement, and, after being stripped of the few clothes, and the
little property I chanced to have about me, a log was fastened to my leg by a
chain, and I was permitted to walk the fore castle of the vessel, with the
African and several Spanish and Portuguese prisoners. The treatment of the
slaves, who plied the oars, the management of the vessel, the order which was
observed among this ferocious race, and some notices of our voyage, might
afford observations, which would be highly gratifying to my readers, if the
limits of this work would permit. I will just observe however that the
regularity and frequency of their devotion was astonishing to me, who had been
taught to consider this people as the most blasphemous infidels. In ten days
after I was captured, the Rover passed up the straits of Gibralter, and I heard
the garrison evening gun fired from that formidable rock; and the next morning
hove in sight of the city of Algiers.

ARGUMENT.
The Author is carried into Algiers: Is brought before the Dey: Description of
his Person, Court and Guards: Manner of selecting the Tenth Prisoner.

WE saluted the castle with seven guns, which was returned with three, and then
entered within the immense pier, which forms the port. The prisoners, thirty in
number, were conveyed to the castle, where we were received with great parade
by the Dey's troops or cologlies, and guarded to a heavy strong tower of the
castle. The Portuguese prisoners, to which nation the Algerines have the most
violent antipathy, were immediately, with every mark of contempt, spurned into
a dark dungeon beneath the foundations of the tower, though there were several
merchants of eminence, and one young nobleman, in the number. The Spaniards,
whom the Dey's subjects equally detest, and fear more, were confined with me in
a grated room, on the second story. We received, the same evening, rations
similar to what, we understood, were issued to the garrison. The next day, we
were all led to a cleansing house, where we were cleared from vermin, our hair
cut short, and our beards close shaved; thence taken to a bath, and, after
being well bathed, we were clothed in coarse linen drawers, a strait waistcoat
of the same without sleeves, and a kind of tunic or loose coat over the whole,
which, with a pair of leather slippers, and a blue cotton cap, equipped us, as
we were informed, to appear in the presence of the Dey, who was to select the
tenth prisoner from us in person. The next morning, the dragomen or
interpreters, were very busy in impressing upon us the most profound respect
for the Dey's person and power, and teaching us the obeisance necessary to be
made in our approaches to this august potentate. Soon after, we were paraded;
and Captain Hamed presented each of us with a paper, written in a base kind of
Arabic, describing, as I was informed, our persons, names, country, and
conditions in life; so far as our captors could collect from our several
examinations. Upon the back of each paper was a mark or number. The same mark
was painted upon a flat oval piece of wood, somewhat like a painter's palette,
and suspended by a small brass chain to our necks, hanging upon our breasts.
The guards then formed a hollow square. We were blind folded until we passed
the fortifications, and then suffered to view the city, and the immense rabble,
which surrounded us, until we came to the palace of the Dey. Here, after much
military parade, the gates were thrown open, and we entered a spacious court
yard, at the upper end of which the Dey was seated, upon a eminence, covered
with the richest carpeting fringed with gold. A circular canopy of Persian silk
was raised over his head, from which were suspended curtains of the richest
embroidery, drawn into festoons by silk cords and tassels, enriched with
pearls. Over the eminence, upon the right and left, were canopies, which almost
vied in riches with the former, under which stood the Mufti, his numerous
Hadgi's, and his principal officers, civil and military; and on each side about
seven hundred foot guards were drawn up in the form of a half moon.

The present Dey, Vizier Hassen Bashaw, is about forty years of age, five feet
ten inches in height, inclining to corpulency, with a countenance rather comely
than commanding; an eye which betrays sagacity, rather than inspires awe: the
latter is sufficiently inspired by the fierce appearance of his guards, the
splendor of his attendants, the grandeur of his court, and the magnificence of
his attire. He was arrayed in a sumptuous Turkish habit. His feet were shod
with buskins, bound upon his legs with diamond buttons in loops of pearl; round
his waist was a broad sash, glittering with jewels, to which was suspened a
broad scimitar, the hilt of which dazzled the eye with brilliants of the first
water, and the sheath of which was of the finest velvet, studded with gems and
the purest gold. In his scarf was stuck a poignard and pair of pistols of
exquisite workmanship. These pistols and poignard were said to have been a
present from the late unfortunate Louis the sixteenth. The former was of pure
gold, and the value of the work was said to exceed that of the precious mettle
two hundred times. Upon the Dey's head was a turban with the point erect, which
is peculiar to the royal family. A large diamond crescent shone conspicuous in
the front, on the back of which a socket received the quills of two large
ostrich feathers, which waved in graceful majesty over his head. The prisoners
were directed by turns to approach the foot of the eminence. When within thirty
paces, we were made to throw ourselves upon the earth and creep toward the
Dey, licking the dust as a token of reverence and submission. As each captive
approached, he was commanded to rise, pull of his slippers, and stand with his
face bowed to the ground, and his arms crossed over his breast. The chieux or
secretary then took the paper he carried and read the same. To some the Dey put
questions by his drogoman, others were dismissed by a slight nod of his head.
After some consultation among the chief men, an officer came to where the
prisoners were paraded, and called for three by the number, which was marked on
their breasts. The Dey's prerogative gives him the right to select the tenth of
all prisoners; and, as the service or ransom of them constitutes one part of
his revenue, his policy is to choose those, whose friends or wealth would be
most likely to enrich his coffers. At this time, he selected two wealthy
Portuguese merchants, and a young nobleman of the same nation, called Don Juan
Combri. Immediately after this selection, we were carried to a strong house, or
rather prison, in the city, and there guarded by an officer and some of the
crew of the Rover, that had taken us. The remainder of us being considered as
private property, another selection was made by the captain and owners of the
Rover; and all such, as could probably pay their ransom in a short time, were
removed into a place of safety and suffered only a close confinement. The
remnant of my companions being only eleven, consisted of the Negro slave, five
Portuguese, two Spanish sailors, an Italian fiddler, a Dutchman from the Cape
of Good Hope, and his Hottentot servant. As we could proffer no probability of
ransom we were reserved for another fate.

ARGUMENT.
The Slave Market.

ON the next market day, we were stripped of the dress, in which we appeared at
court A napkin was wrapped round our loins, and a coarse cloak thrown over our
shoulders. We were then exposed for sale in the market place, which was a
spacious square, enclosed by ranges of low shops, in different sections of
which were exposed the various articles intended for sale. One section was gay
with flowers; another exposed all the fruits of the season. Grapes, dates,
pomegranates, and oranges lay in tempting baskets. A third was devoted to
sallads and pot herbs; a fourth to milk and cream. Between every section was a
small room, where those, who come to market, might occasionally refresh
themselves with a pipe of tobacco, a cud of opium, a glass of sherbet, or other
cooling liquors. Sherbet is composed of lemons, oranges, sugar, and water. It
is what we, in New England, call beverage. In the center of the market, an
oblong square was railed in, where the dealers in beasts and slaves exposed
their commodities for sale. Here were camels, mules, asses, goats, hares,
dromedaries, women and men, and all other creatures, whether for appetite or
use; and I observed that the purchasers turned from one article to the other,
with equal indifference. The women slaves were concealed in a latticed shop,
but the men were exposed in open view in a stall, situated between those
appropriated to the asses and to the kumrah, a wretched looking, though
serviceable animal in that country, propagated by a jack upon a cow. I now
discovered the reason of the alteration in our dress; for, as the people here,
no more than in New England, love to buy a pig in the poke, our loose coats
were easily thrown open, and the purchaser had an opportunity of examining into
the state of our bodies. It was astonishing to observe, how critically they
examined my muscles, to see if I was naturally strong; moved my limbs in
various directions, to detect any latent lameness or injury in the parts; and
struck suddenly before my eyes, to judge by my winking, if I was clear sighted.
Though I could not understand their language, I doubt not, they spoke of my
activity, strength, age, etc. in the same manner, as we at home talk in the
swop of a horse. One old man was very critical in his examination of me. He
made me walk, run, lie down, and lift a weight of about sixty pounds. He went
out, and soon returned with another man. They conferred together, and the
second was more critical in his examination than the first. He obliged me to
run a few rods, and then laid his hand suddenly to my heart, to see, as I
conjecture, if my wind was good. By the old man I was purchased. What the price
given for me was, I cannot tell. An officer of the market attested the
contract, and I was obliged by the master of the shop, who sold me upon
commissions, for the benefit of the concerned in the Rover, to lie down in the
street, take the foot of my new master, and place it upon my neck; making to
him, what the lawyers call, attornment. I was then seized by two slaves, and
led to the house of my new master.

Perhaps the free citizen of the United States may, in the warmth of his
patriotism, accuse me of a tameness of spirit, in submitting to such gross
disgrace. I will not justify myself. Perhaps I ought to have asserted the
dignity of our nation, in despite of bastinadoes, chains, or even death itself.
Charles the twelfth of Sweden has however been stigmatized by the historian, as
a madman, for opposing the insulting Turk, when a prisoner, though assisted by
nearly two hundred brave men. If any of my dear countrymen censure my want of
due spirit, I have only to wish him in my situation at Algiers, that he may
avail himself of a noble opportunity of suffering gloriously for his country.

True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air,

And, being angered, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew dropping south.
SHAKESPEARE.
ARGUMENT.
The Author Dreameth whilst Awake.

THE higher his rank in society, the further is man removed from nature.
Grandeur draws a circle round the great, and often excludes from them the finer
feelings of the heart. The wretched are all of one family; and ever regard each
other as brethren. Among the slaves of my new master, I was received with pity,
and treated with tenderness, bordering upon fraternal affection. They could not
indeed speak my language, and I was ignorant of theirs; but, by dividing the
scanty meal, composing my couch of straw, and alleviating my more rugged
labors, they spoke that universal language of benevolence, which needs no
linguist to interpret.

It is true, I did not meet, among my fellow slaves, the rich and the noble, as
the dramatist and the novelist had taught me to expect. To betray a weakness I
will confess that, sometime after I was captured, I often suffered fancy to
cheat me of my "weary moments," by portraying those scenes, which had often
amused me in my closet, and delighted me on the stage. Sometimes, I even
contemplated with pleasure the company and converse of my fellow slaves. I
expected to find them men of rank at least, if not of learning. I fancied my
master's cook an English lord; his valet an Italian duke; his groom a knight of
Malta; and even his foot boy some little lively French marquis. I fancied my
future master's head gardener, taking me one side, professing the warmest
friendship, and telling me in confidence that he was a Spanish Don with forty
noble names; that he had fallen in love with my master's fair daughter, whose
mother was a christian slave; that the young lady was equally charmed with him;
that she was to rob her father of a rich casket of jewels, there being no
dishonor in stealing from an infidel; jump into his arms in boy's clothes that
very night, and escape by a vessel, already provided, to his native country. I
saw in imagination all this accomplished. I saw the lady descend the rope
ladder; heard the old man and his servants pursue; saw the lady carried off
breathless in the arms of her knight; arrive safe in Spain; was present at the
lady's baptism into the catholic church, and at her marriage with her noble
deliverer. I was myself almost stifled with the caresses of the noble family,
for the part I had borne in this perilous adventure; and in fine married to
Donna some body, the Don's beautiful sister; returned into my own country,
loaded with beauty and riches; and perhaps was aroused from my reverie by a
poor fellow slave, whose extreme ignorance had almost blunted the sensibility
of his own wretchedness.

Indeed, so sweet were the delusions of my own fancy, I am loath to destroy the
innocent gratification, which the readers of novels and plays enjoy from the
works of a Behn and a Colman; but the sober character of the historian compels
me to assure my readers that, whatever may have happened in the sixteenth
century, I never saw during my captivity, a man of any rank, family, or fortune
among the menial slaves. The Dey, as I have already observed, selecting his
tenth prisoner from those, who would most probably afford the richest ransom,
those concerned in the captures are influenced by the same motive. All, who may
be expected to be ransomed, are deprived of this liberty, it is true; but fed,
clothed, and never put to manual labor, except as a punishment for some actual
crime, or attempting to recover their liberty. The menial slaves are generally
composed of the dregs of those nations, with whom they are at war; but, though
my fellow slaves were grossly illiterate, I must do them the justice to say,
they had learned well the kinder virtues: those virtues, which schools and
colleges often fail to teach, which, as Aristotle well observes, are like a
flame of fire. Light them up in whatever climate you will, they burn and shine
ever the same.

YOUNG'S REVENGE.
ARGUMENT.
Account of my Master Abdel Melic: description of his House, Wife, Country
House, and severe Treatment of his Slaves.

THE name of my master was Abdel Melic. He had been formerly an officer in the
Dey's troops, and, it was said, had rendered the Dey's father some important
service in an insurrection, and was therefore highly respected; though at that
time he had no public employment. He was an austere man; his natural severity
being probably increased by his employment as a military officer. I never saw
the face of any other person in his family, except the male slaves. The houses
of the Algerines are nearly all upon the same model; consisting of a building
toward the street of one or two stories, which is occupied by the master and
male domestics, and which is connected by a gallery upon the ground, if the
house is of one story; if of two, the entrance is above stairs, to a building
of nearly the same size behind, which has no windows or lattices at the side,
but only looking into a garden, which is always surrounded by a high wall. In
these back apartments (...) women are lodged, both wives and slaves. My master
had a wife, the daughter of a principal officer in the Dey's court, and, to my
surprise, had only one. I found it to be a vulgar error, that the Algerines
had generally more. It is true they are allowed four by their law; but they
generally find, as in our country, one lady sufficient for all the comforts of
connubial life; and never take another, except family alliance or barrenness
renders it eligible or necessary. The more I became acquainted with their
customs, the more was I struck with their great resemblance to the
patriarchical manners, described in holy writ. Concubinage is allowed; but few
respectable people practice it, except for the sake of heirs. With the
Algerines the barrenness of a RACHEL is sometimes compensated to the husband,
by the fertility of a BILHAH. After I had lived in this town house about three
weeks, during which time I was clothed after the fashion of the country, my
master moved, with his whole family, to a country house on the river Saffran.
Our journey, which was about twelve miles, was performed in the evening. Two
carriages, resembling our traveling wagons, contained the women. Only the
bodies of them were latticed, and furnished with curtains to cover them in the
day time, which were rolled up in the evening. Two slaves preceded the
carriages. Abdel Melic followed on horseback, and I accompanied a baggage
wagon in the rear. When we arrived at the country house, the garden gates were
thrown open, and the carriages with the women entered. The men were introduced
to the front apartments. I found here several more slaves, equally ignorant and
equally attentive and kind toward me, as those I had seen in the town. The
next day, we were all set to work in digging for the foundation of a new wall,
which was to enlarge our master's gardens. The weather was sultry. The soil
below the surface was almost a quicksand. I, unused to hard labor, found my
strength soon exhausted. My fellow slaves, compassionating my distress, were
anxious, by changing places with me, to render my share of the labor less
toilsome. As we had our stint for the whole party staked out to us every
morning, it was in the power of my kind fellow laborers to favor me much.
Often would they request me, by signs, to repose myself in the shade, while
they encouraged each other to perform my share of the task. After a while, our
master came to inspect the work; and, conceiving that it did not progress as
fast as he wished, he put an overseer over us, who, finding me not so active as
the rest, first threatened and then struck me with his whip. This was the first
disgraceful blow I had ever received. Judge you, my gallant, freeborn fellow
citizens, you, who rejoice daily in our federal strength and independence, what
were my sensations. I threw down my spade with disdain, and retired from my
work, lowering indignation upon my insulting oppressor. Upon his lifting his
whip to strike me again, I flew at him, collared him, and threw him on his
back. Then, setting my foot on his breast, I called upon my fellow slaves to
assist me to bind the wretch, and to make one glorious effort for our freedom.
But I called in vain. They could not comprehend my language; and, if they
could, I spoke to slaves, astonished at my presumption, and dreading the
consequences for me and themselves. After their first astonishment, they ran
and took me gently off from the overseer, and raised him with the greatest
respect. No sooner was he upon his feet than, mad with rage, he took up a
mattoc; and, with a violent blow upon my head, levelled me to the ground. I lay
senseless, and was awakened from my stupor by the severe lashes of his whip,
with which the dastardly wretch continued to beat me, until his strength
failed. I was then left to the care of my fellow slaves, who could only wash my
wounds with their tears. Complaint was immediately made to my master, and I was
sent to work in a stone quarry about two miles from the house. At first, I
rejoiced in escaping the malice of this merciless overseer, but soon found I
had made no advantageous exchange. I was surrounded by the most miserable
objects. My fellow laborers had been put to this place, as a punishment for
domestic crimes, or for their superior strength, and all were obliged to
labor equally hard. To break hard rocks with heavy mauls, to transport large
stones upon our backs up the craggy sides of the quarry, were our common
labors; and to drink water, which would have been delicious, if cold, and to
eat black barley bread and onions, our daily fare; while the few hours,
allotted to rest upon our flinty beds, were disturbed by the tormenting
insects, or on my part by the more tormenting dreams of the dainties of my
father's house. There is a spring under a rock upon my father's farm, which we
called the cold spring, from which we used to supply our family with water, and
prided ourselves in presenting it as a refreshing beverage, in summer, to our
visitors. How often, after working beyond my strength, on a sultry African day,
in that horrid quarry, have I dreamed of dipping my cup in that cold spring,
and fancied the waters eluding my taste as I raised it to my lips. Being
presented with a tumbler filled from this spring, after my return, in a large,
circle of friends, the agonies I had suffered came so forcibly into my
recollection, that I could not drink the water, but had the weakness to melt
into tears.

How naturally did the emaciated prodigal, in the scripture, think upon the
bread in his father's house. Bountiful Father of the Universe, how are common
blessings of thy providence despised. When I ate of the bread of my father's
house, and drank of his refreshing spring, no grateful return was made to him
or thee. It was amidst the parched sands and flinty rocks of Africa that thou
taughtest me, that the bread was indeed pleasant, and the water sweet. Let
those of our fellow citizens, who set at naught the rich blessings of our
federal union, go like me to a land of slavery, and they will then learn how to
appreciate the value of our free government.

ARGUMENT.
The Author is encountered by a Renegado: Struggles between Faith, the World,
the Flesh, and the Devil.

AS I was drooping under my daily task, I saw a young man habited in the
Turkish dress, whose clear skin and florid cheek convinced me he was not a
native of the country; whose mild air and manners betrayed nothing of the
ferocity of the renegado. The style of his turban pronounced him a Mohammedan;
but the look of pity, he cast toward the christian slaves, was entirely
inconsistent with the pious hauteur of the mussulman; for christian dog is
expressed as strongly by the features as the tongue of him, they call a true
believer. He arrested my attention. For a moment I suspended my labor. At the
same moment, an unmerciful lash, from the whip of the slave driver, recalled my
attention to my work, and excited his, who was the cause of my neglect. At his
approach, the slave driver quitted me. The stranger accosted me, and in good
English commisserated my distresses, which, he said, he should deplore the
more, if they were remediless. When a man is degraded to the most abject
slavery, lost to his friends, neglected by his country, and can anticipate no
rest but in the grave, is not his situation remediless, I replied? Renounce the
Christian, and embrace the Mohammedan faith; you are no longer a slave, and the
delights of life await you, retorted he. You see me. I am an Englishman. For
three years after my captivity, like you, I groaned under the lash of the slave
driver; I ate the scanty morsel of bitterness, moistened with my tears. Borne
down by the complicated ills of hunger and severe labor, I was carried to the
infirmary for slaves, to breathe my last, where I was visited by a Mollah or
Mohammedan priest. He pitied the misfortunes of a wretch, who, he said, had
suffered a cruel existence, in this life, and had no rational hopes of
exchanging it for a better, in the world to come. He opened the great truths of
the mussulman faith. By his assistance I recovered my health, and was received
among the faithful. Embraced and protected by the rich and powerful, I have now
a house in the city, a country residence on the Saffran, two beautiful wives, a
train of domestics; and a respectable place in the Dey's customs defrays the
expense. Come, added he, let me send my friend, the Mollah, to you. He will
remove your scruples, and, in a few days, you will be as free and happy as I
am. I looked at him with astonishment. I had ever viewed the character of an
apostate as odious and detestable. I turned from him with abhorrence, and for
once embraced my burden with pleasure. Indeed I pity you, said he. I sorrow
for your distresses, and pity your prejudices. I pity you too, replied I, the
tears standing in my eyes. My body is in slavery, but my mind is free. Your
body is at liberty, but your soul is in the most abject slavery, in the gall of
bitterness and bond of iniquity. You have sold your God for filthy lucre; and
"what shall it profit you, if you gain the whole world and lose your own soul,
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul." I respect your prejudices,
said the stranger, because I have been subject to them myself. I was born in
Birmingham in England, and educated a rigid dissenter. No man is more subject
to prejudice than an Englishman, and no sectary more obstinately attached to
his tenets than the dissenter. But I have conversed with the Mollah, and I am
convinced of the errors of my education. Converse with him likewise. If he
does not convince you, you may glory in the christian faith; as that faith will
be then founded on rational preference, and not merely on your ignorance of any
other religious system. Suggest the least desire to converse with the Mollah,
and an order from the Mufti will come to your master. You will be clothed and
fed at the public expense; be lodged one month in the college of the priest;
and not returned to your labors, until the priest shall declare you
incorrigible. He then left me. The heat increased, and my strength wasted. The
prospect of some alleviation from labor, and perhaps a curiosity to hear what
could be said in favor of so detestably ridiculous a system, as the Mohammedan
imposture, induced me, when I saw the Englishman again, to signify my consent
to converse with the Mollah.

CHAP. VI.
Hear I, or dream I hear that distant strain,
Sweet to the soul and tasting strong of Heaven,

ANON.
ARGUMENT.
The Author is carried to the sacred College of the Mussulman Priest: The
Mortifications and Austerities of the Mohammedan Recluse. The Mussulman mode of
Proselyting.

THE next day, an order came from the Mufti to my master, who received the
order, touched his forehead with the tefta respectfully, and directed me to be
instantly delivered to the Mollah. I was carried to the college, a large gloomy
building, on the outside; but, within the walls, it was an earthly paradise.
The stately rooms, refreshing baths, cooling fountains, luxuriant gardens,
ample larders, rich carpets, downy sofas, and silken mattresses, offered with
profusion all those soft excitements to indolent pleasure, which the most
refined voluptuary could desire. I have often observed that, in all countries,
except New England, those, whose profession it is to decry the luxuries and
vanities of this world, some how or other, contrive to possess the greatest
portion of them.

Immediately upon my entering these sacred walls, I was carried to a warm bath,
into which I was immediately plunged; while my attendants, as if emulous to
cleanse me from all the filth of error, rubbed me so hard with their hands and
flesh brushes, that I verily thought they would have flayed me. While I was
relaxed with the tepid, I was suddenly plunged into a contiguous cold bath. I
confess I apprehended dangerous consequences, from so sudden a check of such
violent perspiration; but I arose from the cold bath highly invigorated. The
Indian of North America surprised the European physician, by a process founded
on similar principles. The patient, in the most violent fever, was confined in
a low hut, built of turf and flat stones, which had been previously heated by
fire. When the profusest perspiration was thus excited, the patient was
carried, and often, with Indian fortitude, ran to the next stream, and plunged
frequently through the ice into the coldest water. This process, which
Boerhaave and Sydenham would have pronounced deletery, ever produced pristine
health and vigor, when prescribed by the Indian physician or Powwow.
I was then anointed in all parts, which had been exposed to the sun with a
preparation of a gum, called the balm of Mecca. This application excited a very
uneasy sensation, similar to the stroke of the water pepper, to which "the
liberal shepherds give a grosser name." In twenty four hours, the sun browned
cuticle peeled off, and left my face, hands, legs, and neck as fair as a
child's of six months old. This balm the Algerine ladies procure at a great
expense, and use it as a cosmetic to heighten their beauty.

After I had been clothed in the drawers, slippers, loose coat, and shirt of
the country, if shirt it could be called, which neck had none; with a decoction
of the herb henna, my hands and feet were tinged yellow: which color, they
said, denoted purity of intention. I was lodged and fed well, and suffered to
amuse myself, and recover my sanity of body and mind. On the eleventh day, as I
was reclining on the margin of a retired fountain, reflecting on my dear native
country, I (...) joined by the Mollah. He was (...) of about thirty years of
age, of (...) pleasing countenance and (...) He was born at Antioch, and
educated a christian of the Greek church. He was designed by his parents for a
preferment in that church, when he was captured by the Algerines, and almost
immediately, conformed to the mussulman faith; and was in high esteem in the
sacred college of the priests. As he spoke latin and some modern languages
fluently, was well versed in the bible and christian doctrines, he was often
employed in proselyting the European slaves, and prided himself in his frequent
success.

He accosted me with the sweetest modulation of voice; kindly inquired after my
welfare; begged to know if my lodging, dress, and fare, were agreeable;
assuring me that, if I wished to alter either, in such a manner as to bring
them nearer to the fare and modes of my native country, and would give my
directions, they should be obeyed. He requested me to appoint a time, when we
might converse upon the great subject of religion. He observed that he wished
me free from bodily indisposition, and that the powers of my mind would recover
their activity. He said, the holy faith, he offered to my embraces, disdained
the use of other powers than rational argument; that he left to the church of
Rome, and its merciless inquisitors, all the honor and profit of conversion by
faggots, dungeons, and racks. He made some further inquiry, as to my usage in
the college, and retired. I had been so long accustomed to the insolence of
domestic tyranny; so often groaned under the whip and burden; so often been
buffetted, spurned and spit upon, that I had steeled my mind against the sorce
and terror, I anticipated from the Mollah; but was totally unprepared for such
apparent candor and gentleness. Though I viewed his conduct as insidious, yet
he no sooner retired than, overcome by his suavity of manners, for the first
time I trembled for my faith, and burst into tears.

The flat, unvaried spirit, that has dared,
On this unworthy scaffold, to bring forth
So great an object.
SHAKESPEARE.
ARGUMENT.
The Author confereth with a Mollah or Mohammedan Priest: Defends the Verity
of the Christian Creed, and resigns his Body to Slavery, to preserve the
Freedom of his Mind.

UPON the margin of a refreshing fountain, shadowed by the fragrant branches of
the orange, date, and pomegranate, for five successive days I maintained the
sacred truths of our holy religion, against the insidious attack of the
mussulman priest. To be more perspicuous, I have condensed our conversation,
and, to avoid useless repetition, have assumed the manner of a dialogue.

Mollah. Born in New England, my friend, you are a christian purified by
Calvin. Born in the Campania of Rome, you had been a papist. Nursed by the
Hindoos, you would have entered the pagoda with reverence, and worshipped the
soul of your ancestor in a duck. Educated on the bank of the Wolga the Delai
Lama had been your god. In China, you would have worshipped Tien, and perfumed
Confucius, as you bowed in adoration before the tablets of your ancestors.
Cradled with the Parsees of Indostan, you had adored fire, and trembled with
pious awe, as you presented your rice and your ghee to the adorable cock and
dog.

A wise man adheres not to his religion, because it was that of his ancestors.
He will examine the creeds of other nations, compare them with his own, and
hold fast that, which is right.


Author. You speak well. I will bring my religion to the test. Compare it with
the -- the --


Mollah. Speak out boldly. No advantage shall be taken. You would say, with the
Mohammedan imposture. To determine which of two revealed religions is best, two
inquiries are alone necessary. First, which of them has the highest proof of
its divine origin, and which inculcates the purest morals: that is, of which
have we the greatest certainty that it came from God, and which is calculated
to do most good to mankind.


Author. True. As to the first point, our bible was written by men divinely
inspired.


Mollah. Our alcoran was written by the finger of the Deity himself. But who
told you, your bible was written by men divinely inspired.


Author. We have received it from our ancestors, and we have as good evidence
for the truths it contains, as we have in profane history for any historical
fact.


Mollah. And so have we for the alcoran. Our sacred and profane writers all
prove the existence of such a prophet as Mahomet, that he received the sacred
volume from the hand of Gabriel, and the traditions of our ancestors confirm
our faith.


Author. We know, the christian religion is true, from its small beginnings and
wonderful increase. None but Deity himself could have enabled a few illiterate
fishermen to spread a religion over the world, and perpetuate it to posterity.


Mollah. Your argument I ^^ow to be forcible, but grant us also the use of it.
Mahomet was an illiterate camel driver. Could he, who could not read nor write,
have published a book, which for its excellence has astonished the world? Would
the learned of Medina and Mecca have become his disciples? Could Omar and
Abubeker, his successors, equally illiterate, have become the admiration of
the world? If you argue from the astonishing spread of your faith, view our
prophet, born five hundred and sixty nine years, and dating the promulgation of
his doctrine six hundred and twenty years after the birth of your prophet. See
the extensive countries of Persia, Arabia, Syria, Egypt, all rejoicing in its
benign influence. See our holy faith pouring its divine rays of light into
Russia, and Tartary. See it received by enlightened Greece, raising its
crescent through the vast Turkish empire, and the African states. See
Palestine, and Jerusalem the birth place of your prophet, filled with the
disciples of ours. See Asia and Africa, and a great part of Europe
acknowledging the unity of God, and the mission of his prophet. In a word, view
the world. See two mahometans of a religion, which arose six hundred and twenty
years after yours, to one christian, computing those of all denominations, and
then give your argument of the miraculous spread of religion its due weight.

My blood boiled to hear this infidel vaunt himself thus triumphantly against
my faith; and, if it had not been for a prudence, which in hours of zeal I have
since had cause to lament, I should have taken vengeance of him upon the spot.
I restrained my anger, and observed, our religion is supported by miracles.


Mollah. So is ours; which is the more remarkable, as our great prophet
declared, he was not sent into the world to work miracles, but to preach the
unity of the first cause, the resurrection of the dead, the bliss of paradise,
and the torments of the damned. Yet his whole life was a miracle. He was no
sooner born than, with a voice, like the thundering of Heronon, he pronounced
the adorable creed to his mother and nurses: I profess that there is only one
God, and that I am his apostle. He was circumcised from all eternity; and, at
the same hour, a voice of four mighty angels was heard proclaiming from the
four corners of the holy house. The first saying, proclaim the truth is risen,
and all lies shall return into hell. The second uttering, now is born an
apostle of your own nation, and the Omnipotent is with him. The words of the
third were, a book full of illustrious light is sent to you from God; and the
fourth voice was heard to say, O Mahomet, we have sent thee to be a prophet,
apostle, and guide to the world.

When the sent of God was about three years old, the blessed child retired into
a cave, at the basis of mount Uriel; when the archangel Gabriel, covering his
face with his wings, in awful respect approached him saying, Bismillahi
Rrahmani Rrhahimi; in the name of the one Almighty, Compassionate, and
Merciful, I am sent to pluck from thy heart the root of evil; for thy prayers
have shaken the pillars of eternal decree. The infant prophet said, the will of
thy Lord and mine be done. The archangel, then opened his bosom with a lancet
of adamant, and, taking out his heart, squeezed from it the black drop of
original sin; and, having restored the heart, sunk gently into the bosom of the
Houri.

Do you wish for more miracles? Hear how the prophet, in the dark night,
passsed the seven heavens upon the sacred mule; of the mighty angel he saw, of
such astonishing magnitude, that it was twelve thousand days journey in the
space between his eye brows; of the years he pent in perusing the book of
destiny; and how he returned, so speedily that, the mattress was not cold, and
he recovered the pitcher at his bed side, which he had overset at his
departure, so that not one drop of water was lost. Contrast these with those of
your prophet. He then vented a volume of reproach horrible to hear, and too
blasphemous to defile my paper.


Author. Our religion was disseminated in peace; yours was promulgated by the
sword.


Mollah. My friend, you surely have not read the writings of your own
historians. The history of the christian church is a detail of bloody massacre:
from the institution of the christian thundering legion, under Constantine the
great, to the expulsion of the Moors out of Spain by the ferocious inquisition,
or the dragooning of the Hugonots from France, under Louis the great. The
mussulmen never yet forced a man to adopt their faith. When Abubeker, the
caliph, took a christian city, he forbore to enter a principal church, as he
should pray in the temple of God; and, where he prayed, the building would be
established as a mosque by the piety of the faithful. The companions and
successors of the apostle conquered cities and kingdoms, like other nations.
They gave civil laws to the conquered, according to the laws of nations; but
they never forced the conscience of any man. It is true, they then and we now,
when a slave pronounces the infallible creed, immediately knock off his fetters
and receive him as a brother; because we read in the book of Zuni that the
souls of true believers are bound up in one fragrant bundle of eternal love. We
leave it to the christians of the West Indies, and christians of your southern
plantations, to baptize the unfortunate African into your faith, and then use
your brother christians as brutes of the desert.

Here I was so abashed for my country, I could not answer him.


Author. But you hold a sensual paradise.


Mollah. So the doctors of your church tell you; but a sensual heaven is no
more imputable to us than to you. When the Most Holy condescends to reveal
himself to man in human language, it must be in terms commensurate with our
conception. The enjoyment of the Houri, those immortal virgins, who will attend
the beatified believer; the splendid pavilions of the heavens, are all but
types and significations of holy joys too sublime for man in flesh to conceive
of. In your bible, I read, your prophet refers to the time, when he should
drink new wine in his father's kingdom. Now would it be candid in me to hastily
brand the heaven of your prophet as sensual, and to represent your faithful in
bliss as a club of wine bibbers?


Author. But you will allow the preeminence of the morality of the sacred
scriptures.


Mollah. Your scriptures contain many excellent rules of life. You are there
taught to be kindly affectionate one toward another; but they recommend the
use of wine, and do not forbid gaming. The alcoran, by forbidding in express
terms the use of either, cuts from its follower the two principal sources of
disquiet and misery. Read then this spotless book. There you will learn to love
those of our faith, and not hate those of any other. You will learn the
necessity of being virtuous here, that you may be happy and not miserable
hereafter. You will learn resignation to the will of the Holy One; because you
will know, that all the events of your life were, in the embryo of time, forged
on the anvils of Divine Wisdom. In a word, you will learn the unity of God,
which, notwithstanding the cavil of your divines, your prophet, like ours, came
into the world to establish, and every man of reason must believe. You need not
renounce your prophet. Him we respect as a great apostle of God; but Mahomet is
the seal of the prophet. Turn then, my friend, from slavery to the delights of
life. Throw off the shackles of education from your soul, and be welcome to the
joys of the true believer. Lift your finger to the immensity of space, and
confess that there is one God, and that Mahomet is his apostle.

I have thus given a few sketches of the manner of this artful priest. After
five days conversation, disgusted with his fables, abashed by his assurance,
and almost confounded by his sophistry, I resumed my slave's attire, and sought
safety in my former servitude.

ARGUMENT.
The Language of the Algerines.

THE very day, I was dismissed from the college of the priests, I was returned
to my master, and the next morning sent again to labor in the quarry. To my
surprise, no harsh reflections were made upon, what these true believers must
have styled, my obstinate prejudice against the true faith; for I am sensible
that my master was so good a mussulman as to have rejoiced in my conversion,
though it might affect his purse. I experienced the extremest contumely and
severity; but I was never branded as a heretic. I had by this time acquired
some knowledge of their language, if language it could be called, which bad
defiance to modes and tenses, appearing to be the shreds and clippings of all
the tongues, dead and living, ever spoken since the creation. It is well known
on the sea coasts of the Mediterranean by the name of LINGUA FRANCA. Probably
it had its rise in the awkward endeavors of the natives to converse with
strangers from all parts of the world, and the vulgar people, calling all
foreigners Franks, supplied its name. I the more readily acquired this jargon,
as it contained many Latin derivatives. If I have conjectured the principle,
upon which the Lingua Franca was originally formed, it is applied through all
stages of its existence: every person having good right to introduce words and
phrases from his vernacular tongue, and which, with some alteration in accent,
are readily adopted. I well recollect, being once at a loss to name a
composition of boiled barley, rice and treacle, I called for the HASTY PUDDING
and MOLASSES. The phrase was immediately adopted, and HASCHI PUDAH MOLASCHI is
now a synonima with the ancient name: and, I doubt not, if a dictionary of the
Lingua Franca shall ever be compiled, the name of the staple cookery of New
England will have a conspicuous place.


This medley of sounds is generally spoken, but the people of the higher rank
pride themselves in speaking pure Arabic. My conference with the Mollah was
effected in Latin, which the priest pronounced very differently from the
learned president and professors of Harvard college, but delivered himself with
fluency and elegance.

CHAP. IX.
With aspect sweet, as heavenly messenger
On deeds of mercy sent, a form appears.
Unfading chaplets bloom upon her brow,
Eternal smiles play over her winning face.
And frequent promise opes her flattering lips.
It Is HOPE, who from the dayless dungeon
Points the desponding wretch to scenes of bliss,
And ever and anon she draws the veil
Of blank futurity, and shows him where,
Far, far beyond the oppressor's cruel grasp,
His malice and his chains, he shares again
The kindred mirth and feast under the roof
Paternal, or beside his social fire
Presses the lovely partner of his heart,
While the dear pledges of their mutual love
Gambol around in sportive innocence.
Anon the illusive phantom mocks his sight,
And leaves the frantic wretch to die
In pristine darkness, fetters and despair!!
AUTHOR'S Manuscript Poems.
ARGUMENT.
The Author plans an Escape.

I FOUND many more slaves at work in the stone quarry, than when I quitted it;
and the labors and hard fare seemed, if possible, to be augmented. The ease
and comfort, with which I lived for some weeks past, had vitiated my appetite,
softened my hands, and relaxed my whole frame, so that my coarse fare and
rugged labors seemed more insupportable. I nauseated our homely food, and the
skin peeled from my hands and shoulders. I made what inquiries I could, as to
the interior geography of the country, and comforted myself with theh open of
escape; conceiving it, under my desperate circumstances, possible to penetrate
unobserved the interior country, by the eastern boundaries of the kingdom of
Morocco, and then pass on south west, until I struck the river Sanaga, and
coursing that to its mouth I knew would bring me to some of the European
settlements near Goree or Cape Verd. Preparatory to my intended escape I had
procured an old goat's skin, which to make into something like a knapsack, I
deprived myself of many hours of necessary sleep; and of many a scanty meal to
fill it with provisions. By the use of my Lingua Franca and a little Arabic, I
hoped to obtain the assistance of the slaves and lower orders of the people,
through whom I might journey. The only insurmountable difficulty in my projects
was to elude the vigilance of our overseers. By a kind of roll call the slaves
were numbered every night and morning, and at meal times: but, very
fortunately, a probable opportunity of escaping unnoticed soon offered. It was
announced to the slaves that in three days time there would be a day of rest, a
holiday, when they would be allowed to recreate themselves in the fields. This
intelligence diffused general joy. I received it with rapture. I doubled my
diligence in my preparations; and, in the afternoon previous to this fortunate
day, I contrived to place my little stock of provisions under a rock at a small
distance from the quarry. At sunset we were all admitted to bathe, and I
retired to my repose with bright hopes of freedom in my heart, which were
succeeded by the most pleasing dreams of my native land. That Beneficent Being,
who brightens the slumbers of the wretched with rays of bliss, can alone
express my raptures, when, in the visions of that night, I stepped lightly over
a father's threshhold; was surrounded by congratulating friends and faithful
domestics; was pressed by the embraces of a father; and with holy joy felt a
mother's tears moisten my cheek.

Early in the dawn of the morning, I was awakened by the congratulations of my
fellows, who immediately collected in small groups, planning out the intended
amusements of the day. Scarce had they portioned the little space alloted to
ease, according their various inclinations, when an express order came from our
master that we should go under the immediate direction of our overseers, to a
plain, about five miles distance, to be present at a public spectacle. This
was a grievous disappointment to them, and more especially to me. I buoyed up
my spirits however with the hopes that, in the hurry and crowd, I might find
means to escape, which, although I knew I could not return for my knapsack, I
was resolved to attempt, having a little millet and two onions in my pocket.

ARGUMENT.
The Author present at a Public Spectacle.

WE were soon paraded and marched to the plain, to be amused with the promised
spectacle, which, notwithstanding it might probably frustrate my attempts for
freedom, I anticipated with a pleasing curiosity. When we arrived at the plain,
we found, surrounding a spot, fenced in with a slight railing, a large
concourse of people, among whom I could discern many groups of men, whose
habits and sorrow indented faces showed them to be of the same miserable order
with us. In the midst of this spot there was a frame erected, somewhat
resembling the stage of our pillories; on the center of which a pole or strong
stake was erected, sharpened at the end and pointed with steel. While I was
perplexing myself with the design of this apparatus, military music was heard
at a distance; and soon after a strong party of guards approached the scaffold,
and soon mounted upon the stage a miserable wretch, with all the agonies of
despair in his countenance, who I learned from his sentence, proclaimed by a
public crier, was to be impailed alive for attempting to escape from bondage.
The consciousness that I had been, one moment before, meditating the same act,
for which this wretch was to suffer so cruelly, added to my feelings for a
fellow creature, excited so strong a sympathy for the devoted wretch, that I
was near fainting.

I will not wound the sensibility of my humane fellow citizens, by a minute
detail of this fiend like punishment. Suffice it to say that, after they had
stripped the sufferer naked, except a cloth around the loins, they inserted the
iron pointed stake into the lower termination of the vertebrae, and thence
forced it up near his back bone, until it appeared between his shoulders; with
devilish ingenuity contriving to avoid the vital parts. The stake was then
raised into the air, and the suffering wretch exposed to the view of the
assembly, writhing in all the contortions of insupportable agony. How long he
lived, I cannot tell, I never gave but one look at him: one was enough to appal
a New England heart. I laid my head on the rails, until we retired. It was now
obvious,* it was designed by our master, that this horrid spectacle should
operate upon us as a terrifying example. It had its full effect on me. I
thought no more of attempting an escape; but, during our return, was miserably
tormented least my knapsack and provisions should be found and adduced against
me, as evidence of my intent to desert. Happily for me, I recovered them the
next day, and no suspicions of my design were entertained

To pay it, by transmitting down entire
Those sacred rights, to which themselves were born.
AKENSIDE.
ARGUMENT.
The Author feels that he is indeed a Slave.

I NOW found that I was indeed a slave. My body had been enthralled, but the
dignity of a free mind remained; and the same insulted pride, which had
impelled me to spurn the villain slave driver, who first struck me a
disgraceful blow, had often excited a surly look of contempt upon my master,
and the vile instruments of his oppression; but the terror of the late
execution, with the unabating fatigue of my body, had so depressed my
fortitude, that I trembled at the look of the overseer, and was meanly anxious
to conciliate his favor, by attempting personal exertions beyond my ability.
The trite story of the insurgent army of the slaves of ancient Rome, being
routed by the mere menaces and whips of their masters, which I ever sceptically
received, I now credit. A slave myself, I have learned to appreciate the
blessings of freedom. May my countrymen ever preserve and transmit to their
posterity that liberty, which they have bled to obtain; and always bear it
deeply engraven upon their memories, that, when men are once reduced to
slavery, they can never resolve, much more achieve, any thing, that is manly,
virtuous, or great.

Depression of spirits, consequent upon my blasted hope of escape, coarse fare,
and constant fatigue reduced me to a mere skeleton: while over exertion brought
on an haemoptysis or expectoration of blood, and menaced an approaching hectic;
and soon after, fainting under my burden, I was taken up and conveyed in a
horse litter to the infirmary for slaves, in the city of Algiers.

ARGUMENT.
The Infirmary.

HERE I was lodged comfortably, and had all the attention paid me, which good
nurses and ignorant physicians could render. The former were men, who had made
a vow of poverty, and whose profession was to attend the couches of the sick;
the latter were more ignorant than those of my own country, who had amused me
in the gayer days of life. They had no theory nor any systematic practice; but
it was immaterial to me. I had cast my last anxious thoughts upon my dear
native land, had blessed my affectionate parents, and was resigned to die.

One day as I was sunk upon my bed, after a violent fit of coughing, I was
awakened from a doze, by a familiar voice, which accosted me in Latin. I opened
my eyes and saw at my side, the Mollah, who attempted to destroy my faith. It
immediately struck me that his purpose was to tempt me to apostatize in my last
moments. The religion of my country was all I had left of the many blessings, I
once enjoyed, in common with my fellow citizens. This rendered it doubly dear
to me. Not that I was insensible of the excellence and verity of my faith; no.
If I had been exposed to severer agonies than I suffered, and had been
flattered with all the riches and honors, these infidels could bestow, I trust
I should never have foregone that faith, which assured me for the miseries, I
sustained in a cruel separation from my parents, friends, and intolerable
slavery, a rich compensation in that future world, where I should rejoin my
beloved friends, and where sorrow, misery, or slavery, should never come. I
judged uncandidly of the priest. He accosted me with the same gentleness, as
when at the college, commiserated my deplorable situation, and, upon my
expressing an aversion to talk upon religion, he assured me that he disdained
taking any advantage of my weakness; nor would attempt to deprive me of the
consolation of my faith, when he feared I had no time left to ground me in a
better. He recommended me to the particular care of the religious, who attended
the sick in the hospital; and, having learned in our former conferences that I
was educated a physician, he influenced his friend the director of the
infirmary to purchase me, if I regained my health, and told him I would be
serviceable, as a minor assistant. If any man could have effected a change of
my religion, it was this priest. I was charmed with the man, though I
abominated his faith. His very smile exhilerated my spirits and infused health;
and, when he repeated his visits, and communicated his plan of alleviating my
distresses, the very idea, of being freed from the oppressions of Abdel Melic,
made an exchange of slavery appear desirable. I was again attached to life, and
requested him to procure a small quantity of the quinquina or jesuits bark.
This excellent specific was unknown in the infirmary; but, as the Algerines are
all fatalists, it is immaterial to the patient, who is his physician, and what
he prescribes. By his kindness the bark was procured, and I made a decoction,
as near to Huxham's, as the ingredients I could procure would admit, which I
infused in wine; no brandy being allowed, even for the sick. In a few weeks,
the diagnostics, were favorable, and I recovered my pristine health; and, soon
after, the director of the hospital purchased me of my late master, and I was
appointed to the care of the medicine room, with permission to go into the city
for fresh supplies.

PATENT ADDRESS.
ARGUMENT.
The Author's Practice as a Surgeon and Physician, in the City of Algiers.

MY circumstances were now so greatly ameliorated that, if I could have been
assured of returning to my native country in a few years, I should have
esteemed them eligible. To observe the customs, habits, and manners of a
people, of whom so much is said and so little known at home; and especially to
notice the medical practice of a nation, whose ancestors have been spoken of
with respect, in the annals of the healing art, was highly interesting.

After a marked and assiduous attention of some months to the duties of my
office, I acquired the confidence of my superiors so far, that I was sometimes
sent abroad in the city to examine a patient, who had applied for admission
into the infirmary; and sometimes the physicians themselves would condescend to
consult me. Though they affected to despise my skill, I had often the
gratification of observing that they administered my prescriptions with success.

In surgery they were arrant bunglers. Indeed, their pretensions to knowledge
in this branch were so small that my superior adroitness scarce occasioned
envy. Applications, vulgarly common in the United States, were there viewed
with admiration. The actual cautery was their only method of staunching an
external hemorrhage. The first amputation, I operated, drew all the principal
physicians around me. Nothing could equal their surprise, at the application of
the spring tourniquet, which I had assisted a workman to make for the occasion,
except the taking up of the arteries. My friend the Mollah came to congratulate
me on my success, and spread my reputation wherever he visited. A poor creature
was brought to the hospital with a depressed fracture upon the os frontis, sunk
into a lethargy, and died. I proposed trepanning, but found those useful
instruments unknown in this country. By the care of the director, I had a set
made under my direction; but, after having performed upon a dead, I never could
persuade the Algerine faculty to permit me to opperate upon a living subject.
What was more amusing, they pretended to improve the aid of philosophy against
me, and talked of the weight of a column of air pressing upon the dura matter,
which, they said, would cause instant death. Of all follies the foppery of
learning is the most insupportable. Professional ignorance and obstinacy were
not all I had to contend with. Religious prejudice was a constant impediment to
my success. The bigotry of the Mohammedan differs essentially from that of the
Roman catholic. The former is a passive, the latter an active principle. The
papist will burn infidels and heretics; the Mussulman never torments the
unbeliever, but is more tenaciously attached to his own creed, makes his faith
a principle in life, and never suffers doubt to disturb, or reason to overthrow
it. I verily believe that, if the alcoran had declared, that the earth was an
immense plain and stood still, while the sun performed its revolution round it,
a whole host of Gallileos, with a Newton at their head, could not have shaken
their opinion, though aided by all the demonstrative powers of experimental
philosophy.

I was invited by one of the faculty to inspect the eyes of a child, which had
lost its sight about three years; I proposed couching, and operated on the
right eye with success. This child was the only son of an opulent Algerine,
who, being informed that an infidel had restored his son to sight, refused to
let me operate on the other, protesting that, if he had known that the operator
was an unbeliever, his son should have remained blind, until he opened his eyes
upon the Houri of paradise. He sent me however a present of money, and offered
to make my fortune, if I would abjure the christian faith and embrace
Ismaelism, which, he said, he believed, I should one day do: as he thought that
God never would have decreed that I should restore his son to sight, if he had
not also decreed that I should be a true believer.

ARGUMENT.
Visits a sick Lady.

MY reputation increased, and I was called the learned slave; and, soon after,
sent for to visit a sick lady. This was very agreeable to me; for, during my
whole captivity, I had never yet seen the face of a woman; even the female
children being carefully concealed, at least from the sight of the vulgar. I
now anticipated much satisfaction from this visit, and hoped that, through the
confidence, with which a tender and successful physician seldom fails to
inspire his patient, I should be able to acquire much useful information upon
subjects of domestic concern, impervious to travelers. Preparatory to this
visit, I had received a new and better suit of clothes than I had worn, as a
present from the father of the young lady. A gilt wagon came to the gate of
the hospital, which I entered with our principal physician, and was drawn by
mules to a country house, about five miles from the city, where I was received
by Hadgi Mulladin, the father of my patient, with great civility. Real
gentlemen are the same in all countries. He treated us with fruit and sherbet;
and, smiling upon me, after he had presented a bowl of sherbet to the principal
physician, he handed me another bowl, which to my surprise I found filled with
an excellent Greek wine, and archly inquired of me how I liked the sherbet.
Hadgi Mulladin had traveled in his youth, and was supposed to have imbibed the
libertine principles of the christian, as it respected wine. This was the only
instance, which came to my knowledge, of any professed Mussulman indulging
himself with wine or any strong liquor; and it was not unnoticed by the
principal physician, who afterward gravely told me that Hadgi Mulladin would
be undoubtedly damned for drinking wine; would be condemned to perpetual thirst
in the next world, while the black spirit would present him with red hot cups
of scalding wine. Exhilirated by the wine and the comparitively free manners of
this Algerine, I was anxious to see my patient. I was soon gratified. Being
introduced into a large room, I was left alone nigh an hour. A side door was
then opened, and two eunuchs came forward with much solemnity and made signs
for me to retire to the farthest part of the room, as if I had been infested
with some malignant disorder. They were, in about ten minutes, followed by four
more of the same sex, bearing a species of couch, close covered with double
curtains of silk, which they set down in the midst of the room; and every one
drew a broad scimitar from his belt, flourishing it in the air, inclined it
over his shoulder, and stood guard at every corner of the couch, While I was
wondering at this parade, the two first eunuchs retired and soon returned; the
one bearing an ewer or basin of water, the other a low marble stand, and some
napkins in a China dish. I was then directed to wash my feet; and, another
basin being produced, it was signified that I must wash my hands, which I did
three times. A large thick muslin veil was then thrown over my head, I was led
toward the couch, and was presented with a pulse glass, being a long glass
tube graduated and terminated below with a hollow bulb, and filled with some
liquid, which rose and fell like spirits in the thermometer. This instrument
was inserted through the curtains, and the bulb applied to the pulse of my
patient, and the other extremity put under my veil. By this I was to form my
opinion of her disorder, and prescribe a remedy; for I was not allowed to ask
any questions or even to speak to, much more see the lady, who was soon
reconveyed to her apartment. The two first eunuchs now marched in the rear, and
closed and fastened the doors carefully after them. After waiting alone two
hours or more, I was called to give my advice; and never was I more puzzled. To
confess ignorance would have ruined my reputation, and reputation was then life
itself. The temptations to quackery were powerful and overcame me. I boldly
pronounced her disease to be an intermittent fever, prescribed venesection, and
exhibited some common febrifuge, with directions to throw in the bark, when the
fever ceased. My prescriptions were attended with admirable success; and, if I
had conformed to their faith, beyond a doubt, I might have acquired immense
riches. But I was a slave, and all my gains were the property of my master. I
must do him the justice to say that, he permitted me to keep any particular
presents, that were made to me. Frequent applications were made to the director
for my advice and assistance to the diseased; and, though he received generally
my fee, yet it was sufficiently gratifiying to me to be permitted to walk
abroad, to amuse myself, and obtain information of this extraordinary people,
as much of which, as the prescribed limits of this little work will admit, I
shall now lay before my readers.

ARGUMENT.
Sketch of the History of the Algerines.

MUCH antiquarian lore might here be displayed, in determining whether the
state of Algiers was part of the ancient Mauritinia Massilia, or within the
boundaries of the republic of Carthage; and pages of fruitless research might
be wasted, in precisely ascertaining the era, when that portion of the sea
coast of Africa, now generally known by the name of the Barbary Bruce, an
Englishman, who traveled to collect fairy tales for the amusement of London
cits, observes that this territory was called Barbaria by the Greeks and Romans
from Beber, signifying a shepherd; and even the accurate compiler of the
American edition of Guthrie's Geography has quoted the observation in a
marginal note. We cannot expect that geographers should be philologists any
more than that every printer should be a Webster. How the Greeks or Romans came
by the word Beber, I leave Mr. Bruce to elucidate. The former had the term
barbaros, a barbarian, which they indiscriminately applied to all foreigners;
and, when Greek literature became fashionable in Roman schools, the latter
adopted the term, and barbarus was applied by the Romans with the same soppish
contempt.
Shore, was subdued by the Romans, or conquered by the Vandals.

The history of nations like the biography of man, only assumes an interesting
importance, when its subject is matured into vigor. To trace the infancy of
the old world, we run into childish prattle and boyish tales. Suffice it then
to say, that the mixed multitudes, which inhabited this country, were reduced
to the subjection of the Greek emperors by the arms of the celebrated
Belisarius, and so continued, until the close of the seventh century, when they
were subdued by the invincible power, and converted to the creed of the ancient
caliphs, the immediate successors of the prophet Mahomet, who parcelled the
country into many subordinate governments, among which was that of Algiers;
which is now bounded, on the north, by the Mediterranean; on the south, by
mount Atlas, so familiar to the classic reader, and the chain of hills, which
extends thence to the north east; on the west, by the kingdom of Morocco; The
common geography compilers add the kingdom of T^filet, I conjecture, upon the
authority of Dr. Shaw, though I could never hear of any such kingdom in Africa.
The face of many a country, which that learned writer describes, differs as
much from the truth, as his own physiognomy from the true line of beauty.
and, on the east, by the state of Tunis. The state of Algiers is about five
hundred miles in length, upon the coast of the Mediterranean, and from fifty to
one hundred and twenty miles in breadth, and boasts about as large an extent of
territory, as is contained in all the United States proper, which lay to the
north of Pennsylvania including the same.

It was nine hundred years after the conquest of the caliphs, and at the
beginning of the tenth century, that the Algerines, by becoming formidable to
the Europeans, acquired the notice of the enlightened historian. About this
time, two enterprizing young men, sons of a potter, of the island of Mytelene
the ancient Lesbos, called Horrie and Hayraddin, collecting a number of
desperadoes, seized upon a brigantine and commenced pirates, making
indiscriminate depredations upon the vessels of all nations. They soon
augmented their force to a fleet of twelve galleys, beside small craft, with
which they infested the sea coast of Spain and Italy, and carried their booty
into the ports of Barbary, styling themselves the lords of the sea, and the
enemies of all those, who sailed upon it. European nations were not then
possessed of such established and formidable navies, as at the present day:
even the English, who seem formed for the command of the sea, had but few ships
of force. Henry the eighth built some vessels, which, from their unmanageable
bulk, were rather suited for home defense than foreign enterprise; and the
fleet of Elizabeth, which, in fifteen hundred and eighty eight, destroyed the
Spanish. Armada, was principally formed of ships, chartered by the merchants,
who were the general resource of all the maratime powers. The fleet of these
adventurers was therefore formidable; and, as Robertson says, soon became
terrible from the straits of the Dardanelles to those of Gibralter. The
prospects of ambition increase, as man ascends its summit. Horrie, the elder
brother, surnamed Barbarossa, as some assert, from the red color of his beard,
aspired to the attainment of sovereign power upon land; and a favorable
opportunity soon offered of gratifying his pride. His frequent intercourse with
the Barbary States induced an acquaintance with Eutimi, then king of Algiers,
who was then at war with Spain, and had made several unsuccessful attacks upon
a small fort, built by that nation on the Oran. In his distress, this king
inconsiderately applied to Barbarossa, for assistance, who readily embraced the
invitation, and conducted himself like more modern allies. He first assisted
this weak king against his enemy, and then sacrificed him to his own ambition;
for, leaving his brother Hayraddin to command the fleet, he entered the city of
Algiers, at the head of five thousand men, was received by the inhabitants, as
their deliverer, assisted them against the Spaniards, and then arrested and
disarmed the principal people, secretly murdered the unsuspecting Eutimi, and
caused himself to be proclaimed king of Algiers. Lavish of his treasures to his
adherents, and cruelly vindictive to those, he distrusted, he not only
established his government, but dethroned the neighboring king of Temecien,
and annexed his dominions to his own. But the brave Marquis de Comeses, the
Spanish governor of Oran, by the direction of the Emperor Charles the fifth,
assisted the dethroned king; and, after defeating Barbarossa in several bloody
battles, besieged him in Temecien, the capital of that kingdom, where this
ferocious adventurer was slain in attempting his escape, but sought his
pursuers with a brutal rage, becoming the ferocity of his life. Upon the death
of Barbarossa, his brother Hayraddin assumed the same name, and the kingdom of
Algiers. This Barbarossa is better known to the European annalist for rendering
his dominions tributary to the Grand Seignior. He enlarged his power with a
body of the Turkish soldiers; and, being promoted to the command of the Turkish
fleet, he spread the fame of the Ottoman power through all Europe: for though
obliged by the superior power of the Emperor Charles fifth to relinquish his
conquest of Tunis, which he had effected by a similar treachery, with which his
brother had possessed himself of Algiers; yet his being the acknowledged rival
of Andrew Doria, the first sea commander of his age, has laurelled his brow
among those, who esteem glory to consist in carnage. This Barbarossa built a
mole for the protection of the harbor of Algiers, in which, it is said, he
employed thirty thousand christian slaves, and died a natural death, and was
succeeded by Hassan Aga, a renegado from Sardinia, elected by the soldiers, but
confirmed by the Grand Seignior, who, taking an advantage of a violent storm,
which wrecked the navy of the Emperor Charles fifth, who had invaded his
territories, drove that proud emperor from the coast, defeated the rear of his
army, and captured so many of his soldiers, that the Algerines, it is reported,
sold many of their prisoners by way of contempt, at the price of an onion per
head. Another Hassan, son to the second Barbarossa, succeeded and defeated the
Spaniards, who invaded his dominions under the command of the Count de
Alcandara, killed that nobleman, and took above twelve thousand prisoners. But
his successor, Mahomet, merited the most of his country, when, by ingratiating
himself with the Turkish soldiers, by incorporating them with his own troops,
he annihilated the contests of these fierce rivals, formed a permanent body of
brave, disciplined troops, and enabled his successor to renounce that
dependence upon the Grand Seignior, to which the second Barbarossa had
submitted.

In sixteen hundred and nine, the Algerines received a vast accession of
strength and numbers from the emigrant Moors, whom the weak policy of Spain had
driven to their dominions. Embittered by christian severity, the Moors flocked
on board the Algerine vessels, and sought a desperate revenge upon all, who
bore the christian name. Their fleet was said to consist, at this period, of
upwards of forty ships, from two to four hundred tons burden. Though the
French with that gallantry, which distinguished them under their monarchs,
undertook to avenge the cause of Europe and christianity; and, in sixteen
hundred and seventeen, sent a fleet of fifty ships of war against them, who
sunk the Algerine admiral and dispersed his fleet; yet this bold people were so
elated, by their accession of numbers and riches, that they committed wanton
and indiscriminate outrage, on the person and property of all nations,
violating the treaties made by the Grand Seignior, seizing the ships of those
powers, with which he was in alliance, even in his own ports; and, after
plundering Scandaroon in Syria, an Ottoman city, they, in sixteen hundred and
twenty three, threw off their dependence on the sublime Port. In sixteen
hundred and thirty seven, the Algerine rovers entered the British channel, and
made so many captures that, it was conjectured, near five thousand English were
made prisoners by them; and, in the same year, they dispatched Hall Pinchinin
with sixteen galleys to rob the rich chapel of our lady of Loretto; which
proving unsuccessful, they ravaged the shores of the Adriatic, and so enraged
the Venetians, that they fitted out a fleet of twenty eight sail, under the
command of Admiral Cappello, who, by a late treaty with the Port, had liberty
to enter any of its harbors, to destroy the Algerine galleys. Cappello was
ordered by the Venetians to sink, burn, and destroy, without mercy, all the
corsairs of the enemy, and he bravely and successfully executed his commission.
He immediately overtook and defeated Pinchinin, disabled five of his galleys;
and, this Algerine retreating to Valona and landing his booty, where he erected
batteries for its defense, the brave Cappello manned his boats and small craft,
and captured his whole fleet. In these actions, about twelve hundred Algerines
were slain; and, what was more pleasing, sixteen hundred christian galley
slaves set at liberty. History affords no instance of a people, so repeatedly
and suddenly recovering their losses, as the Algerines. Within a few years, we
find them fitting out seventy sail of armed vessels, and making such daring and
desperate attacks upon the commerce of nations, that the most haughty maritime
powers of Europe were more anxious, to shelter themselves under a treaty and
pay an humiliating tribute, than to attempt nobly to reduce them to reason and
humanity. But, after many ineffectual attempts had been made to unite the force
of Europe against them, the gallant French, by the command of Louis fourteenth,
again roused themselves to chasten this intractable race. In sixteen hundred
and eighty two, the Marquis du Quesne, with a large fleet and several bomb
ketches, reached Algiers; and, with his sea mortars, bombarded it so violently
that, he laid almost the whole city in ruins. Whether his orders went no
further, or the vice admiral judged he had chastised them sufficiently, or
whether a violent storm drove his fleet from its moorings, does not appear. But
it is certain, that he left the city abruptly; and the Algerines, to revenge
this insult, immediately sent their fleet to the coast of France, and took
signal reparation.

The next year, Du Quesne cast anchor before Algiers with a larger fleet; and,
for forty eight hours, made such deadly discharges with his cannon, and
showered so many bombs over this devoted city, that the Dey sued for peace.

The French admiral with that generosity, which is peculiar to his nation,
insisted, as an indispensable preliminary, that all the christian slaves should
be sent on board his squadron, with Mezemorto the Dey's admiral, as a hostage
for the performance of this preliminary article. The Dey assembled his divan,
or council of great officers, and communicated the French demands. Mezemorto
immediately collected the sailors, who had manned the ramparts, and with whom
he was a favorite; and, accusing the Dey of cowardice, he so inflamed them
that, being joined by the soldiers, they murdered the Dey, and elected
Mezemorto in his stead. This was a signal for renewed hostility, and never was
there a scene of greater carnage. The French seemed to have reserved their fire
for this moment, when they poured such incessant vollies of red hot shot,
bombs, and carcasses into the city, that it was nearly all in flames. The
streets run blood, while the politic and furious Mezemorto, dreading a change
in the public mind, and conscious that another cessation of arms would be
attended with his death or delivery to the French, ran furiously round the
ramparts and exhorted the military to their duty; and, to make his new subjects
desperate, caused all the French slaves to be murdered; and, seizing the French
consul, who had been a prisoner among them, since the first declaration of war,
he ordered him to be tied hand and foot, and placed over a bomb mortar and shot
into the air toward the French fleet. The French were so highly enraged, the
sailors could scarce be prevented from attempting to land, and destroy this
barbarous race. The vice admiral contented himself with levelling their
fortifications, reducing the city to rubbish, and burning their whole fleet. A
fair opportunity now presented of preventing the Algerines from again molesting
commerce. If the European maritime powers had by treaty engaged themselves to
destroy the first armed galley of the Algerines, which appeared upon the seas,
and conjointly forbidden them to repair their fortifications; this people might
ere this have from necessity turned their attention to commerce; the miscreants
and outcasts of other nations would have no longer found refuge among them; and
this people might at this time have been as celebrated for the peaceful arts,
as they are odious for the constant violation of the laws of nations and
humanity. This was surely the common interest of the European powers; but to
talk of their common interest is idle. The narrow politics of Europe seek an
individual not a common good; for no sooner had France humbled the Algerines
than England thought it more for her interest to enter into a treaty with the
new Dey, and, by way of douceur, sent to Algiers a ship load of naval and
military stores, to help them to rebuild their navy and strengthen their
fortresses; while France, jealous lest the affections of the monster Mezemorto,
who barbarously murdered their fellow citizens, should be attached to their
rival the English, immediately patched up a peace with the Algerines upon the
most favorable terms to the latter; and, to conclude the farce, sent them
another ship load of similar materials of superior value to those, presented
by the English. This, my readers, is a small specimen of European policy.

The latest authentic account of any attack upon the Algerines was on the
twenty third of June, one thousand seven hundred and seventy five; when the
Spaniards sent the Count O'Rally with a respectable fleet, twenty four thousand
land forces, and a prodigious train of artillery, to destroy the city. The
count landed about two thirds of his troops, about a league and an half to the
eastward of the city; but, upon marching into the country, they were opposed by
an immense army of natives. The Spaniards say, it consisted of one hundred and
fifty thousand, probably exaggerated by their apprehensions. This is certain,
they had force sufficient, or superior skill to defeat the Spaniards, who
retreated to their ships with the loss of thirteen cannon, some howitzers, and
three thousand killed, besides prisoners; while they destroyed six thousand
Algerines. No sooner had the treaty of Paris, in one thousand seven hundred and
eighty two, completely liberated the United States from their dependence upon
the British nation than that haughty, exasperated power, anxious to show their
late colonists the value of that protection, under which their vessels had
heretofore navigated the Mediterranean, excited the Algerines to capture the
shipping of the United States, who, following from necessity the policy of
European nations, concluded a treaty with this piratical state on the fifth of
September, one thousand seven hundred and ninety five.

Thus I have delineated a sketch of Algerine history from actual information,
obtained upon the spot, and the best European authorities. This dry detail of
facts will probably be passed over by those, who read for mere amusement, but
the intelligent reader will, in this concise memoir, trace the leading
principles of this despotic government; will account for the avarice and
rapacity of a people, who live by plunder; perceive whence it is that they are
thus suffered to injure commerce and outrage humanity; and justify our
executive in concluding, what some uninformed men may esteem, a humiliating,
and too dearly purchased peace with these free booters.

ARGUMENT.
Description of the City of Algiers.

I CANNOT give so particular a description of this city, as I could wish, or my
readers may desire. Perhaps no town contains so many places impervious to
strangers. The interior of the Dey's palace, and the female apartment of every
house are secluded even from the natives. No one approaches them but their
respective masters, while no stranger is permitted to inspect the
fortifications; and the mosques, or churches, are scrupulously guarded from the
polluted steps of the unbeliever. A poor slave, branded as an infidel, would
obtain only general information from a residence in the midst of them.

Algiers is situated in the bay of that name, and built upon the sea shore, an
eminence, which rises above it, and which naturally gave the distinction of the
upper and lower city. Toward the sea, it is strengthened with vast
fortifications, which are continued upon the mole, which secures the port from
storms and assaults. I never perambulated it, but should judge that, a line
drawn from the west arm of the mole, and extended by land, until it terminated
on the east, comprehending the buildings, would measure about two miles. It
contains one hundred and twenty mosques, two hundred and twenty public baths,
and innumerable coffee houses. The mosques are large stone buildings, not lofty
in proportion to their extent on the ground, and have usually erected, upon
their corners, small square towers or minarets, whence the inferior priests
call the people to prayers. The baths are convenient buildings, lighted on the
top, provided with cold and warm waters, which you mingle at your pleasure, in
small marble cisterns, by the assistance of brass cocks. Every bather pays two
rials at his entrance, for which he is accommodated with a dressing room,
contiguous to the bathing cistern, towels, flesh brushes, and other
conveniences, a glass of sherbet, and an assistant, if he chooses. The coffee
houses or rooms are generally piazzas, with an opening over them, projecting
from the front of the houses into the streets. Here the inhabitants delight to
loll, to drink sherbet, sip coffee, and chew opium, or smoke tobacco, steeped
in a decoction of this exhilarating drug.

I have already sketched a description of the houses, and shall only add, that
the roofs are nearly flat with a small declivity to cast the rain water into
spouts. Algiers is tolerably well supplied with spring water, conveyed in pipes
from the back country; but the Algerines, who are immoderately attached to
bathing, prefer rain water, as best adapted to that use, considering it a
luxury in comparison with that, obtained from the springs or sea.

The inhabitants say, Algiers contains twenty thousand houses, one hundred and
forty thousand believers, twenty two thousand Jews, and six thousand christian
slaves. I suspect, Algerine vanity has exaggerated the truth; but I cannot
contradict it. Immediately before the census of the inhabitants of the United
States, I am told, persons, who possessed much better means of calculation,
misrated the population of the principal towns most egregiously.

ARGUMENT.
The Government of the Algerines.

IT has been noticed that Hayraddin Barbarossa, in the beginning of the
sixteenth century, rendered his kingdom tributary to the Grand Seignior; and
that, in the year one thousand six hundred and twenty three, the Algerines
threw off their dependence on the sublime Port. Since that time, the Turkish
court have made several attempts to reduce the Algerines to their subjection;
and, by siding with the numerous pretenders to the regency, so common in this
unstable government, they have, at times, apparently effected their design:
while the Algerines, by assassinating or dethroning those princes, whose
weakness or wants have induced them to submit to extraneous power, have reduced
their dependence on the sublime Port to a mere name. At present, the Grand
Seignior, fearful of losing the very shadow of authority, he has over them,
contents himself with receiving a tribute almost nominal; consisting chiefly of
a present, toward defraying the expenses of the annual canopy, which is sent
to adorn the prophet's tomb at Medina: while, on the other hand, the Algerines,
dreading the Grand Seignior's interference in their popular commotions, allow
the sublime Port to confirm the election of their Dey, and to badge his name,
by affixing and terminating it with those of the principal officers of the
Turkish government. Hence the present Dey, whose real name is Hassan, is styled
Vizier, which is also the appellation of the Grand Seignior's first minister.
As Bashaw, which terminates the Dey's name, is the Turkish title of their
viceroys and principal commanders, he makes war or peace, negotiates treaties,
coins money, and performs every other act of absolute independence.

Nor is the Dey less independent of his own subjects. Though he obtains his
office frequently by the election of a furious soldiery, and wades to the
regency through the blood of his predecessor; yet he is no sooner invested with
the insignia of office, than, an implicit reverence is paid to his commands,
even by his ferocious electors; and, though he often summons his divan or
council of great officers, yet they are merely advisory. He conducts foreign
affairs, at his own good pleasure; and, as to internal, he knows no restraint,
except from certain local customs, opinions, and tenets, which he himself
venerates, in common with his meanest subjects. Justice is administered in his
name. He even determines controversies in his own person, besides being
supposed virtually present in the persons of his cadis or judges. If he
inclines to interfere in the determination of a suit, upon his approach, the
authority of the cadis cease, and is merged in that of the Dey. Some customs
have been intimated, which restrain the Dey's despotism. These relate
principally to religion, property, and females. He will not condemn a priest to
death; and, although upon the decease of a subject, his landed property
immediately escheats to the reigning Dey, yet he never seizes it, in the life
of the possessor; and, when a man is executed for the highest crime, the
females of his family are treated with respect; nay, even in an insurrection of
the soldiery, when they murdered their Dey, neither they nor his successor
violated the female apartments of the slain. A mere love of novelty in the
soldiery, the wish to share the largesses of a new sovereign, the policy of his
courtiers, the ambition or popularity of his officers or children, have not
unfrequently caused the dethroning of the Dey; but the more systematic cause of
his being so frequently dethroned shall be noticed in our next chapter.

ARGUMENT.
Revenue.

THE Dey's revenue is stated by writers at seven hundred thousand dollars per
annum. If the limits of this work would permit, I think I could prove it under
rated, from a view of his expenditures. It arises from a slight tax upon his
subjects, a tribute from some Moors and tribes of Arabs, in the interior
country; a capitation tax upon the Jews; prizes taken at sea; presents from
foreign powers, as the price of peace; annual subsidies from those nations,
with whom he is in alliance; and customary presents made by his courtiers on
his birth day, To these may be added sums, squeezed from his Bashaws in the
government of the interior provinces, and from the Jews, as the price of their
protection. With these supplies he has to support the magnificene of his court,
defray the expense of foreign embassies, pay his army, supply his navy, and
repair his fortifications; and, by frequent gratuities, if he is not very
successful and popular, support his interest among those, who have the power to
dethrone him. His proportion of the prizes, captured at sea, and the
conciliatory presents, made by the commercial powers, are the principal sources
of his revenue. It is obviously the policy of the Dey, by frequently enfringing
his treaties, to augment his finances, by new captures or fresh premiums for
his friendship. A pacific Dey is sure not to reign long; for, beside the
disgust of the formidable body of sailors, who are emulous of employ, when the
reigning Dey has once gone through the routine of seizing the vessels,
receiving the presents, and concluding treaties with the usual foreign powers,
he finds that the annual payments, secured by treaties, are insufficient for
the maintenance of his necessary expenditures; and is therefore constrained
frequently to declare war as a principle of self preservation. I have been
told, the present Dey condescended to explain these principles to an American
agent in Algiers, and grounded his capturing the American shipping upon this
necessity. I must, said the Dey, be at war with some nation, and yours must
have its turn. When the Dey, from a pacific disposition or dread of foreign
power, is at peace with the world, the disgusted sailor and avaricious soldier
join to dethrone him; having established it, as a maxim, that all treaties
expire with the reigning Dey, and must be renewed with his successor. This is
undoubredly the true source whence spring those frequent and dreadful
convulsions, in the regency of Algiers.

ARGUMENT.
The Dey's Forces.

THERE are but few vessels actually belonging to the Dey's navy. He has many
marine officers, who rank in the sea service; but, except on great expeditions,
are permitted to command the galleys of private adventurers; and it is these
picaroons, that make such dreadful depredations on commerce. I can give but a
slender account of his land forces. Those in established pay are said to amount
to about eight thousand foot, and two thousand Moorish horse. To these may be
added four thousand inhabitants of the city, who enrol themselves as soldiers,
for protection in military tumults, receive no pay, but are liable to be called
upon to man the fortifications in emergency, insurrection, or invasion. Perhaps
there are more of this species in the provinces. The horse are cantoned in the
country round the city, and do duty by detachments at the palace. Three
thousand foot are stationed in the fortifications, and marshalled as the Dey's
guards. The residue of the land forces are distributed among the Bashaws to
overawe the provinces. But the principal reliance, in case of invasion, is the
vast bodies of what may be styled militia, which the Bashaws, in case of
emergency, lead from the interior country.

Notices of the Habits, Customs, etc. of the Algerines.

THE men wear next to their bodies a linen shirt, or rather chemise, and
drawers of the same texture. Over their shirt a linen or silk gown, which is
girded about their loins by a sash, in the choice of which they exhibit much
fancy. In this dress their legs and lower extremity of their arms are bare. As
an outer garment, a loose coat of coarser materials is thrown over the whole.
They wear turbans, which are long pieces of muslin or silk curiously folded, so
as to form a cap comfortable and ornamental. Slippers are usually worn, though
the soldiers are provided with a sort of buskin, resembling our half boots. The
dress of the women, I am told, for I never had the pleasure of inspecting it
very critically, resembles that of the men, except that their drawers are
longer, and their out side garment is like our old fashioned riding hoods. When
the ladies walk the streets, they are muffled with bandages or handkerchiefs of
muslin or silk over their faces, which conceals all but their eyes; and, if too
nearly inspected, will let fall a large vail, which conceals them entirely. The
men usually set cross legged upon mattresses, laid upon low seats at the sides
of the room. They loll on cushions at their meals; and, after their repasts,
occasionally indulge with a short slumber. I have such a laudable attachment to
the customs of my own country, that I doubt whether I can judge heartily of
their cookery or mode of eating. The former would be unpalatable and the latter
disgusting to most Americans; for saffron is their common seasoning. They cook
their provisions to rags or pap, and eat it with their fingers, though the
better sort use spoons. Their diversions consist in associating in the coffee
houses, in the city, and, in the country, under groves, where they smoke and
chat, and drink cooling not inebriating liquors. Their more active amusements
are riding and throwing the dart, at both which they are very expert. They
sometimes play at chess and drafts, but never at games of chance or for money;
those being expressly forbidden by the alcoran.

ARGUMENT.
Marriages and Funerals.

IT is the privilege of travelers to exaggerate; but I wish not o avail myself
of this prescriptive right. I had rather disappoint the curiosity of my readers
by conciseness, than disgust them with untruths. I have no ambition to be
ranked among the Bruces and Chastelreux of the age. I shall therefore endeavor
rather to improve the understanding of my reader, with what I really know, than
amuse him with stories, of which my circumscribed situation rendered me
necessarily ignorant. I never was at an Algerine marriage; but obtained some
authentic information on the subject.

That extreme caution, which separates the sexes in elder life, is also
attached to the youth. In Algiers, the young people never collect to dance,
converse, or amuse themselves with the innocent gaities of their age. Here are
no theaters, balls, or concerts; and, even in the public duties of religion,
the sexes never assemble together. An Algerine courtship would be as
disagreeable to the hale youth of New England, as a common bundling would be
disgusting to the Mussulman. No opportunity is afforded to the young suitor to
search for those nameless bewitching qualities and attentions, which attach the
American youth to his mistress, and form the basis of connubial bliss; nor is
the young Algerine permitted, by a thousand tender assiduities, to win the
affections of the future partner of his life. His choice can be only directed
by the rank or respectability of the father of his intended bride. He never
sees her face, until after the nuptial ceremony is performed; and even some
days after she has been brought home to his own house. The old people
frequently make the match, or, if it originates with the youth, he consides his
wishes to his father or some respectable relation, who communicates the
proposal to the lady's father. If he receives it favorably, the young couple
are allowed to exchange some unmeaning messages, by an old nurse of the family.
The bride's father or her next male kin, with the bridegroom, go before the
Cadi and sign a contract of marriage, which is attested by the relatives on
each side. The bridegroom then pays a stipulated sum to the bride' father; the
nuptial ceremony is performed in private, and the bridegroom retires. After
some days, the bride is richly arrayed, accompanied by females, and conveyed in
a covered coach or wagon, gaudy with flowers, to her husband's house. Here she
is immediately immured in the women's apartments, while the bridegroom and his
friends share a convivial feast. After some ceremonies, the nature of which I
could not discover, the bridegroom enters the women's apartment, and for the
first time discovers whether his wife has a nose or eyes. Among the higher
ranks, it is said, the bride, after the expiration of a month, goes to the
public bath for women, is there received with great parade, and loaded with
presents by her female relations, assembled on the occasion. The bridegroom
also receives presents from his friends.

Within a limited time, the husband may break the contract, provided he will
add another item to that already given, return his bride with all her
paraphernalia; and, putting the holy alcoran to his breast, assert that he
never benefited himself of the rights of an husband.

Notwithstanding the apparent restraint, the women are under, they are said to
be attached to their husbands, and enjoy greater liberty than is generally
conceived. I certainly saw many women in the streets, so muffled up, and so
similar from their outward garment, that their nearest relatives could not
distinguish one from another. The vulgar slaves conjecture that the women take
great liberties in this general disguise.

Their funerals are decent but not ostentatious. I saw many. The corpse, carried
upon a bier, is preceded by the priests, chanting passages from the alcoran in
a dolorous tone. Wherever the procession passes, the people join in this dirge.
The relatives follow, with the folds of their turbans loosened. The bodies of
the rich are deposited in vaults, those of the poor, in graves. A pillar of
marble is erected over them, with an unblown rose carved on the top for the
unmarried.

At certain seasons, the women of the family join a procession in close habits,
and proceed to the tomb or grave, and adorn it with garlands of flowers. When
these processions pass, the slaves are obliged to throw themselves on the
ground with their faces in the dust, and all, of whatever rank, cover their
faces.

O prone to grovelling error, thus to quit
The firm foundations of a Savior's love,
And build on stubble.

ARGUMENT.
The Religion of the Algerines: Life of the Prophet Mahomet.

IN describing the religious tenets of the Algerines, the attention is
immediately drawn to Mahomet or Mahomed, the founder of their faith.

This fortunate impostor, like all other great characters in the drama of life,
has been indignantly vilified by his opponents, and as ardently praised by his
adherents. I shall endeavor to steer the middle course of impartiality;
neither influenced by the biggoted aversion of Sales and Prideaux, or the
specious praise of the philosophic Boulanvilliers.

Mahomet was born in the five hundred and sixty ninth year of the christian
era. He was descended from the Coreis, one of the noblest of the Arabian
tribes. His father, Abdalla, was a man of moderate fortune, and bestowed upon
his son such an education as a parent in confined, if not impoverished
circumstances, could confer. The Turks say, he could not write; because they
pride themselves in decrying letters, and because the pious among them suppose
his ignorance of letters a sufficient evidence of the divine original of the
book, he published, as received from and written by the finger of Deity.

But when the Arabian authors record, that he was employed as a factor by his
uncle Abutileb, there can little doubt remain but that he was possessed of all
the literary acquirements, necessary to accomplish him for his business. He has
been stigmatized as a mere camel driver. He had the direction of camels it is
true. The merchandise of Arabia was transported to different regions by
carrivans of these useful animals, of a troop of which he was conductor; but
there was as much difference between his station and employment, and that of a
common camel driver, as between the supercargo of an India ship in our days,
and the seaman before the mast. In his capacity of factor, he traveled into
Syria, Palestine, and Egypt; and acquired the most useful knowledge in each
country. He is represented as a man of a beautiful person, and commanding
presence. By his engaging manners and remarkable attention to business, he
became the factor of a rich Arabian merchant, after whose death he married his
widow, the beautiful Cadija, and came into the lawful possession of immense
wealth, which awakened in him the most unbounded ambition. By the venerable
custom of his nation, his political career was confined to his own tribe; and,
the patriarchal being the prominent feature of the Arabian government, he could
not hope to surmount the claims of elder families, even in his own tribe, the
genealogies of which were accurately preserved. To be the founder and prophet
of a new religion would secure a glorious preeminence, highly gratifying to his
ambition, and not thwarting the pretensions of the tribes.

Mankind are apt to impute the most profound abilities to sounders of religious
systems, and other fortunate adventurers, when perhaps they owe their success
more to a fortunate coincidence of circumstances, and their only merit is the
sagacity to avail themselves of that tide in the affairs of men, which leads to
wealth and honor. Perhaps there never was a conjuncture more favorable for
the introduction of a new religion than that, of which Mahomet availed himself.
He was surrounded by Arian christians, whose darling creed is the unity of the
Deity, and who had been persecuted by the Athenasians into an abhorrence of
almost every other christian tenet: by Jews, who had fled from the vindictive
Emperor Adrian, and who, too wilfully blind to see the accomplishment of
their prophecies in the person of our Savior, in the midst of exile were ready
to contemn those prophecies, which had so long deluded them with a Messiah, who
never came: and by Pagans, whose belief in a plurality of gods made them the
ready proselytes of any novel system; and the more wise of whom were disgusted
with the gross adsurdities of their own mythology. The system of Mahomet is
said to have been calculated to attach all these. To gratify the Arian and the
Jew, he maintained the unity of God; and, to please the Pagans, he adopted many
of their external rites, as fastings, washings, etc;. Certain it is, he spoke
of Moses and the patriarchs, as messengers from heaven, and that he declared
Jesus Christ to be the true Messiah, and the exemplary pattern of a good life,
a sentiment critically expressing the Arian opinion. The stories of Mahomet's
having retired to a cave with a monk and a Jew to compile his book; and falling
into fits of the epilepsy, persuading his disciples that these sits were
trances in order to propagate his system more effectually, so often related by
geography compilers, like the tales of Pope Joan and the nag's head
consecration of the English bishops, are fit only to amuse the vulgar. It is
certain, he secluded himself from company and assumed an austerity of manners,
becoming the reformer of a vicious world. In his retirement, he commenced
writing the alcoran. His first proselytes were of his own family, the next, of
his near relatives. But the tribe of Corei were so familiar with the person and
life of Mahomet that they despised his pretensions; and, fearful lest what they
styled his mad enthusiasm should bring a stigma upon their tribe, they first
attempted to reason him out of his supposed delusion; and, this failing, they
sought to destroy him. But a special messenger of heaven, who, Mahomet says,
measured ten million furlongs at every step, informed him of their design, and
he fled to Medina, the inhabitants of which, being already prepossessed in
favor of his doctrine, received him with great respect. This flight was in the
six hundred and twenty second year of the christian era, when Mahomet was fifty
four years of age. The Mohammedan of all sectaries commence their computation of
time from this period, which they style the begira, or flight.


He soon inspired them with the most implicit confidence in the divinity of his
mission, and confirmed their faith by daily portions of the alcoran, which he
declared was written by the finger of God, and transmitted to him immediately
from heaven by archangels, commissioned for that important purpose. He declared
himself the Sent of God, the sword of his almighty power, commissioned to
enforce the unity of the divine essence, the unchangeableness of his eternal
decrees, the future bliss of true believers, and the torment of the damned,
among the nations. He boldly pronounced all those who died fighting in his
cause, to be entitled to the glory of martyrs in the heavenly paradise; and,
availing himself of some of the ancient seuds among the neighboring tribes,
caused his disciples in Medina to wage war upon their neighbors, and they
invariably conquered, when he headed their troops. The tribe of Corei flattered
by the honors, paid their kinsman, and confounded by the repeated reports of
his victories, were soon proselyted, and become afterward the most
enthusiastic supporters of his power. In six hundred and twenty seven, he was
crowned sovereign at Medina, like the divine Malchisedec uniting in his person
the high titles of prophet and king. He subdued the greater part of Arabia, and
obtained a respectable footing in Syria. He died at Medina in the year six
hundred and thirty three, and in the sixty fourth year of his age. European
writers, who have destroyed almost as many great personages by poison as the
French have with the guillotine, have attributed his death to a dose
administered by a monk. But when we consider his advanced age and public
energies, we need not recur to any but natural means for the cause of his death.

ARGUMENT.
The Sects of Omar and Ali.

UPON the decease of the prophet, his followers were almost confounded. They
could scarce credit their senses. They fancied him only in a swoon, and waited
in respectful silence until he should again arise to lead them to conquest and
glory. His more confidential friends gathered around the corpse; and, being
impressed with the policy of immediately announcing his successor, they held a
fierce debate upon the subject. In the alcoran, they found no direction for the
election, nor any successor to the caliphate pointed out. They agreed to send
for his wives and confidential domestics. The youngest of his wives produced
some writings, containing the precious sayings of the prophet, which, she said,
she had collected for her own edification. To these were afterward added such
observations of the prophet, as his more intimate associates could recollect,
or the policy of those in power invent. These were annexed to the alcoran, and
esteemed of equal authority. This compilation was called the book of the
companions of the apostle. In the writings, produced by his favorite wife, the
prophet had directed his great officers to elect his successor from among
them, and assured them that a portion of his own power would rest upon him.
Abubeker, a friend and relative, and successful leader of the forces of the
Prophet, by the persuasions of those around, immediately entered the public
mosque; and, standing on the steps of the desk, from which the prophet used to
deliver his oracles, he informed the multitude that God had indeed called the
prophet to paradise, and that his kingly authority and apostolic powers rested
upon him. To him succeeded Omar and Osman: while the troops in Syria,
conceiving that Ali, their leader, was better entitled to succeed than either,
elevated him also to the caliphate, though he refused the dignity until he was
called by the voice of the people to succeed Osman. Hence sprang that great
schism, which has divided the Mussulman world; but, though divided, as to the
successor of the prophet, both parties were actuated by his principles and
adhered to his creed. Omar and his successors turned their arms toward
Europe; and, under the name of Saracens or Moors, possessed themselves of the
greater part of Spain and the Mediterranean isles: while the friends of Ali,
establishing themselves as sovereigns, made equal ravages upon Persia, and even
to the great peninsula of India.

The Algerines are of the sect of Omar, which, like many other religious
schisms, differs more in name, than in any fundamental point of creed or
practice from that of Ali. The propriety of the translation of the alcoran into
the Persian language, and the succession of the caliphate seem the great
standards of their respective creeds.

POPE.
ARGUMENT.
The Faith of the Algerines.

THE Algerine doctors assert, that the language of the alcoran is so ineffably
pure, it can never be rendered into any other tongue. To this they heartily
impute the miserable, vitiated translations of the christians, who they charge
with having garbled the sacred book, and degraded its sublime alegories and
metaphors into absurd tales. This is certain, the portions, I have heard
chanted at funerals and quoted in conversation, ever exhibited the purest
morality and the sublimest conceptions of the Deity. The fundamental doctrine
of the alcoran is the unity of God. The evil spirit, says the koran, is subtly
deluding men, into the belief that there are more gods than one, that in the
confusion of deities he may obtain a share of devotion; while the Supreme
Being, pitying the delusions of man, has sent Abraham, Moses, Soliman, breathed
forth the Messiah of the christian in sigh of divine pity, and lastly sent
Mahomet, the seal of the prophets, to reclaim men to this essential truth. The
next fundamental points in the Mussulman creed are a belief in the eternal
decrees of God, in a resurrection and final judgment to bliss or misery. Some
hold with christians that the future punishment will be infinite, while others
suppose that, when the souls of the wicked are purified by fire, they will be
received into the favor of God. They adhere to many other points of practical
duty: such as daily prayers, frequent ablutions, acts of charity and severe
fastings; that of rhammadin, is the principal, which is similar to the catholic
lent, in abstinence, for the penitent abstains only from a particular kind of
food, while he gluts himself with others perhaps more luscious. The alcoran
also forbids games of chance, and the use of strong liquors; inculcates a
tenderness for idiots, and a respect for age. The book of the companions of the
apostle enjoins a pilgrimage to his tomb, to be made by the true believers once
at least in their lives: but though they view the authority, which enjoined
this tedious journey divine, yet they have contrived to evade its rigor by
allowing the believer to perform it by proxy or attorney.

Upon the whole, there does not appear to be any articles in their faith, which
incite them to immorality or can countenance the cruelties, they commit.
Neither their alcoran nor their priests excite them to plunder, inslave or
torment. The former expressly recommends charity, justice, and mercy toward
their fellow men. I would not bring the sacred volume of our faith in any
comparative view with the alcoran of Mahomet; but I cannot help noticing it as
extraordinary, that the Mohammedan should abominate the christian on account of
his faith, and the christian detest the Mussulman for his creed; when the koran
of the former acknowledges the divinity of the christian Messiah, and the bible
of the latter commands us to love our enemies. If each would follow the obvious
dictates of his own scripture, he would cease to hate, abominate, and destroy
the other.

ARGUMENT.
Why do not the Powers in Europe suppress the Algerine Depredations? is a
Question frequently asked in the United States.

I ANSWER, that this must be effected by a union of the European maritime
powers with the Grand Seignior; by a combination among themselves; or by an
individual exertion of some particular state. A union of the European powers
with the Grand Seignior most probably would be attended with success; but this
is not to be expected; as it never can be the interest of the sublime Port to
suppress them, and the common faith of the Mussulman has more influence in
uniting its professors than the creed of the christian, to the disgrace of the
latter: and, as the Grand Seignior's dominion over the Algerines is little more
than nominal, he is anxious to conciliate their favor by affording them his
protection; considering prudently, that though intractable, they are still a
branch of the Mussulman stock. Provoked by their insults, he has sometimes
withdrawn his protection, as was the case, when he by treaty with the Venetians
permitted their fleet to enter the Ottoman ports, for the express purpose of
destroying the Algerine galleys; but, it is obvious, the sublime Port meant
merely to chastise not to ruin them.

In the Grand Seignior's wars with the Europeans, the piratical states have
rendered signal services, and he himself not unfrequently receives valuable
douceurs for exerting his supposed influence over them, in favor of one or
another of the contending powers of Europe. In the siege of Gibraltar by the
Spaniards, during the late American war, that garrison received frequent
supplies of provision from the Barbary Shore; but, by the application of Louis
XVI. to the sublime Port, the Grand Seignior influenced the Barbary states to
prohibit those supplies; and the English consul was dismissed from one of them
with the most pointed marks of contempt. While the Grand Seignior reaps such
solid advantages from them, it is absurd to predicate upon his cooperation
against them; neither can a union of the European powers be more fully
anticipated. Jealousy as often actuates mighty nations, as weak individuals.
Whoever turns the pages of history with profit, will perceive that sordid
passion is the impulse of action to the greatest states. Commercial states are
also actuated by avarice, a passion still more baneful in its effects. These
excite war, and are the grand plenipotentiaries in the adjustment of the
articles of peace. Hence it is, that, while every European power is solicitous
to enrich and aggrandize itself, it can never join in any common project, the
result of which, it is jealous, may advantage its neighbor; and is content to
suffer injury, rather than its rival should share in a common good. Hence it
is, that christian states, instead of uniting to vindicate their insulted
faith, join the cross and the crescent in unholy alliance, and form degrading
treaties with piratical powers; and, as the acme of political folly, present
those very powers, as the purchase of their friendship, weapons to annoy
themselves in the first war, that their avarice or caprice shall wage. But, if
ever a confederacy of the European powers should be formed against the
Algerines, experience affords us but slender hopes of its success; for, I will
venture to assert, that from the confederacy of Ahab and Jehoshaphat, when they
went up to battle to Ramoth Gilead, to the treaty of Philnitz, there never was
a combination of princes or nations, who, by an actual union of their forces,
attained the object of their coalition. If the political finger is pointed to
the war of the allies of Queen Anne, and the conquests of the Duke of
Marlborough, as an exception, I likewise point to the distracting period, when
that conqueror was superceded by the Duke of Ormond, and the treaty of Utrecht
will confirm the opinion I have advanced.

The detail of the history of the Algerines evinces, that the arms of
individual states can be attended with no decisive success. Indeed, the expense
of an efficacious armament would defray the price of the Dey's friendship for
years; and the powers of Europe submit to his insults and injuries from a
principle of economy. An absolute conquest of the Algerine territory cannot be
effected but by invasion from the interior, through the cooperation of the
Grand Seignior or the assistance of the other Barbary states. The former I have
shown cannot be predicated, and the latter, for obvious reasons, is as little
to be expected. A permanent conquest of the city and port of Algiers cannot be
effected, without the subjection of the interior country. Temporary though
spirited attacks, upon that city and port, have never answered any salutary
purpose. They may be compared to the destruction of our seaports, in our
revolutionary war. The port attacked bore so small a proportion to the whole,
that its destruction rather served to irritate, than to weaken or subjugate. It
should be considered, likewise, that the houses of the Algerines are built of
slight and cheap materials; that upon the approach of an enemy the rich effects
of the inhabitants are easily removed inland, while nothing remains but heavy
fortifications to batter, and buildings, which can be readily restored, to
destroy. The following anecdote will show how sensible the Algerines themselves
are of these advantages. When the French vice admiral, the Marquis de Quesne,
made his first attack on Algiers, he sent an officer with a flag on shore, who
magnified the force of his commander, and threatened to lay the city in ashes,
if the demands of the marquis were not immediately complied with. The Dey, who
had, upon the first approach of the enemy, removed the aged, the females and
his richest effects, coolly inquired of the officer how much the levelling his
city to ashes would cost. The officer, thinking to increase the Dey's
admiration of the power of the Grand Monarque, answered, two millions of
livres. Tell your commander, said the Dey, if he will send me half the money I
will burn the city of ashes myself.

ARGUMENT.
An Algerine Law Suit.

AN officer of police parades the city at uncertain hours, and in all
directions, accompanied by an executioner and other attendants. The process of
his court is entirely verbal. He examines into all breaches of the customs, all
frauds, especially in weights and measures, all sudden affrays, disputes
concerning personal property, and compels the performance of contracts. He
determines causes on the spot, and the delinquent is punished in his presence.
The usual punishments, he inflicts, are fines, beating on the soles of the
feet, dismemberment of the right hand; and, it is said, he has a power of
taking life; but, in such case, an appeal lies to the Dey. If complaint is made
to him of the military, the priests or officers of the court navy, or customs,
or against persons attached to the families of the consuls, envoys, or other
representatives of foreign powers, upon suggestion, the cause is immediately
reported to the Dey, who hears the same in person, or deputes some officer of
rank to determine it, either from the civil, military, or religious orders, as
the nature of the cause may require. In fact, this officer of police seldom
judges any cause of great importance. The object of his commission seems to be
the detection and punishment of common cheats, and to suppress broils among the
vulgar; and, as he has the power to adapt the punishment to the enormity of the
offense, he often exercises it capriciously, and, sometimes, ludicrously. I saw
a baker, who, for selling bread under weight, was sentenced to walk the public
market, three times each day, for three days in succession, with a small loaf,
attached by a ring to each of his ears; and to cry aloud at short distances
"bread for the poor." This excited the resentment of the rabble, who followed
him with abundance of coarse ridicule. Besides this itinerant judge, there are
many others, who never meddle with suits, unless they are brought formally
before them, which is done by mere verbal complaint; they send for the parties
and witnesses, and determine almost as summarily as the officer of police. I
confess that, when I left the United States, the golden fee, the lengthy bill
of cost, the law's delay, and the writings of Honestus, had taught me to view
the judicial proceedings of our country with a jaundiced eye; and, when I was
made acquainted with the Algerine mode of distributive justice, I yearned to
see a cause determined in a court, where instant decision relieved the anxiety,
and saved the purses of the parties; and where no long winded attorney was
suffered to perplex the judge with subtle argument or musty precedent. I was
soon delighted with an excellent display of summary justice. Observing a
collection of people upon a piazza, I leaned over the rails, and discovered
that an Algerine cadi or judge had just opened his court. The cadi was seated
cross legged on a cushion with a slave, with a whip and batten on one side; and
another with a drawn scimitar on the other. The plaintiff came forward and told
his story. He charged a man, who was in custody, with having sold him a mule,
which he said was sound, but which proved blind and lame. Several witnesses
were then called, who proved the contract and the defects of the mule. The
defendant was then called upon for his defense. He did not deny the fact, but
pleaded the law of retaliation. He said, he was a good Mussulman, performed all
the rites of their holy religion, had sent a proxy to the prophet's tomb at
Medina, and maintained an idiot; that he never cheated any man before, but was
justified in what he had done, for, ten years before, the plaintiff had cheated
him worse in the sale of a dromedary, which proved broken winded. He proved
this by several witnesses, and the plaintiff could not deny it. The judge
immediately ordered the mule and the money paid for it to be produced. He then
directed his attendants to seize the defendant, and give him fifty blows on the
soles of his feet for this fraud. The plaintiff at every stroke applauded the
cadi's justice to the skies; but, no sooner was the punishment inflicted, than,
by a nod from the judge, the exulting plaintiff was seized and received the
same number of blows with the batten for the old affair of the broken winded
dromedary. The parties were then dismissed, without costs, and the judge
ordered an officer to take the mule, sell it at public outcry, and distribute
the product, with the money deposited, in alms to the poor. The officer
proceeded a few steps with the mule, and, I thought, the court had risen, when
the cadi supposing one of the witnesses had prevaricated in his testimony
called back the officer, who had charge of the mule, ordered the witness to
receive twenty five blows of the batten, and be mounted on the back of the
mule, with his face toward the tail, and be thus carried through the city,
directing the mule to be stopped at every corner, where the culprit should
exclaim; "before the enlightened, excellent, just, and merciful cadi Mir
Karchan, in the trial of Osman Beker and Abu Isoul, I spoke as I ride." The
people around magnified Mir Karchan for this exemplary justice; and I present
it to my fellow citizens. If it is generally pleasing, it may be easily
introduced among us. Some obstinate people may be still attached to our
customary modes of dispensing justice, and think that the advocates we fee, and
the precedents they quote, are but guards and enclosures round our judges, to
prevent them from capriciously invading the rights of the citizens.

A Mohammedan Sermon.

I ONCE had an opportunity of approaching unnoticed the window of one of the
principal mosques. After the customary prayers, the priest pronounced the
following discourse with a dignified elocution. It was received by his audience
with a reverence, better becoming christians than infidels. It undoubtedly
suffers from translation and the fickleness of my memory; but the manner, in
which it was delivered, and the energy of many of the expressions made so
strong an impression, that I think I have not materially varied from the
sentiment. I present it to the candid reader, as a curious specimen of their
pulpit eloquence; and as, perhaps, conveying a more satisfactory idea of their
creed, than I have already attempted, in the account I have given of their
religion. The attributes of Deity were the subject of the priest's discourse;
and, after some exordium, he elevated his voice and exclaimed:

GOD ALONE IS IMMORTAL. Ibraham and Soliman have slept with their fathers,
Cadijah the first born of faith, Ayisha the beloved, Omar the meek, Omri the
benevolent, the companions of the apostle and the Sent of God himself, all
died. But God most high, most holy, lives forever. Infinities are to him, as
the numerals of arithmetic to the sons of Adam; the earth shall vanish before
the decrees of his eternal destiny; but he lives and reigns forever.

GOD ALONE IS OMNISCIENT. Michael, whose wings are full of eyes, is blind
before him, the dark night is unto him as the rays of the morning; for he
noticeth the creeping of the small pismire in the dark night, upon the black
stone, and apprehends the motion of an atom in the open air.

GOD ALONE IS OMNIPRESENT. He touches the immensity of space, as a point. He
moves in the depths of ocean, and mount Atlas is hidden by the sole of his
foot. He breaths fragrant odours to cheer the blessed in paradise, and
enliveneth the pallid flame in the profoundest hell.

GOD ALONE IS OMNIPOTENT. He thought, and worlds were created; he frowneth, and
they dissolve into thin smoke; he smileth, and the torments of the damned are
suspended. The thunderings of Hermon are the whisperings of his voice; the
rustling of his attire causes lightning and an earthquake; and with the shadow
of his garment he blotteth out the sun.

GOD ALONE IS MERCIFUL. When he forged his immutable decrees on the anvil of
eternal wisdom, he tempered the miseries of the race of Ismael in the fountains
of pity. When he laid the foundations of the world he cast a look of
benevolence into the abysses of futurity; and the adamantine pillars of eternal
justice were softened by the beamings of his eyes. He dropped a tear upon the
embryo miseries of unborn man; and that tear, falling through the immeasurable
lapses of time, shall quench the glowing flames of the bottomless pit. He sent
his prophet into the world to enlighten the darkness of the tribes; and has
prepared the pavilions of the Houri for the repose of the true believers.

GOD ALONE IS JUST. He chains the latent cause to the distant event; and binds
them both immutably fast to the fitness of things. He decreed the unbeliever to
wander amidst the whirlwinds of error; and suited his soul to future torment.
He promulgated the ineffable creed, and the germs of countless souls of
believers, which existed in the contemplation of Deity, expanded at the sound.
His justice refreshes the faithful, while the damned spirits confess it in
despair.

GOD ALONE IS ONE. Ibraham the faithful knew it. Moses declared it amidst the
thunderings of Sinai. Jesus pronounced; it and the messenger of God, the sword
of his vengeance, filled the world with immutable truth.

Surely there is one God, IMMORTAL, OMNICIENT, OMNIPRESENT, OMNIPOTENT, most
MERCIFUL, and JUST; and Mahomet is his apostle.

Lift your hands to the eternal, and pronounce the ineffable, adorable creed:
THERE IS ONE GOD, AND MAHOMET IS HIS PROPHET.

Of the Jews.

I HAVE thus given some succinct notices of the history, government, religion,
habits, and manners of this ferocious race. I have interspersed reflections,
which, I hope, will be received by the learned with candor; and shall now
resume the thread of my more appropriate narrative.

By unremitted attention to the duties of my office and some fortunate
operations in surgery, I had now so far ingratiated myself with the director
and physicians of the infirmary, that I was allowed to be absent any hours of
the day, when my business in the hospital permitted, without rendering any
especial reason for my absence. I wandered into all parts of the city, where
strangers were permitted to walk, inspected every object I could, without
giving umbrage. I sometimes strayed into that quarter of the city, principally
inhabited by Jews. This cunning race, since their dispersion by Vespasian and
Titus, have contrived to compensate themselves for the loss of Palestine, "by
engrossing the wealth, and ten the luxuries of every other land; and, wearied
with the expectation of that heavenly king," who shall repossess them of the
holy city, and put their enemies beneath their feet, now solace themselves with
a Messiah, whose glory is enshrined in their coffers. Rigidly attached to their
own customs, intermarrying among themselves, content to be apparently wretched
and despised, that they may wallow in secret wealth; and secluded, in most
countries, from holding landed property, and in almost all from filling offices
of power and profit, they are generally received as meet instruments to do the
mean drudgery of despotic courts. The wealth, which would render a subject too
powerful, the despot can trust with an unambitious Jew; and confide secrets,
which involve his own safety to a miserable Israelite. whom he can annihilate
with a nod. The Jews transact almost all the Dey's private business, besides
that of the negotiations of merchants. Nay, if an envoy from a foreign power
comes to treat with the Dey, he may have the parade of a public audience; but,
if he wishes to accomplish his embassy, he must employ a Jew: and, it is said,
the Dey himself shares with the Jew the very sums paid him for his influence
with this politic despot. The Jews are also the spies of the Dey, upon his
subjects at home, and the channels of intelligence from foreign powers. They
are therefore allowed to assemble in their synagogues; and have frequently an
influence at the court of the Dey, with his great officers, and even before the
civil judge, not to be accounted for from the morality of their conduct.
Popular prejudice is generally against them; and the Dey often avails himself
of it by heavy amercements for his protection. In the year one thousand six
hundred and ninety, he threatened to extirpate the whole race in his dominions,
and was finally appeased by a large contribution they raised and offered as an
expiation of a supposed offense. It was commonly reported, that the Jews in
Algiers, at that time, had procured a christian child, which they privately
purified with much ceremony, fattened and prepared for a sacrifice, at their
feast of the passover, as a substitute for the paschal lamb. This horrid tale,
which should have been despised for its absurdity and inhumanity, the Dey
affected to credit. He appointed several Mohammedan priests to search the
habitations of the Jews, immediately before the feast of the passover, who,
discovering some bitter herbs and other customary preparations for the
festival, affected to have found sufficient evidence against them; and the mob
of Algiers, mad with rage and perhaps inflamed by the usurious exactions of
particular Jews, rushed on furiously to pillage and destroy the wretched
descendants of Jacob. Two houses were demolished, and several Jews assassinated
before the arrival of the Dey's guards, who quickly dispersed this outrageous
rabble. The Dey, who desired nothing less than the destruction of so useful a
people, was soon appeased by a large present, and declared them innocent: and,
such is the power of despotic governments, that the Jews were soon received
into general favor; and the very men, who, the day before, proceeded to
destroy the whole race, now saw, with tame inaction, several of their fellows
executed for the attempt.

ARGUMENT.
The arrival of other American Captives.

RETURNING from a jaunt into the city, I was immediately commanded to retire to
my room, and not to quit it, till further orders, which it was impracticable to
do, as the doors were fastened upon me. The next morning my provisions were
brought me, and the doors again carefully secured. Surprised at this
imprisonment, I passed many restless hours in recurring to my past conduct, and
perplexing myself in searching for some inadvertent offense, or in dreadful
apprehension, lest the present imprisonment should be a prelude to future and
more severe punishment. The stone quarry came to my imagination in all its
horrors, and the frowns of Abdel Melic again pierced my soul. I attempted in
vain to obtain from the slave, who brought me provisions, the cause of my
confinement. He was probably ignorant; my solicitations were uniformly answered
by a melancholy shake of the head. The next day, the director of the hospital
appeared. To him I applied with great earnestness; but all the information he
would give was, that it was by the Dey's order I was confined; and that he,
with the physicians and my friend the Mollah were using all their influence to
obtain my release. He counseled me to amuse myself in preparing and
compounding drugs, and promised to see me again, as soon as he could bring any
good news. About a week after, an officer of the court, with a city judge,
entered my apartment, and informed me of the cause of my imprisonment. From
them I learned, that several American vessels had been captured; and, it was
suspected, I had been conversing with my countrymen; and, from my superior
knowledge of the country, I might advise them how to escape. If a man is
desirous to know how he loves his country, let him go far from home; if to know
how he loves his countrymen, let him be with them in misery in a strange land.
I wish not to make a vain display of my patriotism, but I will say, that my own
misfortunes, upon this intelligence, were so absorbed in those of my
unfortunate fellow citizens, thus delivered over to chains and torment, many of
them perhaps separated from the tenderest domestic connexions and homes of
case, that, I thought, I could again have willingly endured the lashes of the
slave driver, and sink myself beneath the burdens of slavery, to have saved
them from an Algerine captivity. I could readily assure the Dey's officers,
that I had not conversed with my miserable countrymen; but, while I spoke, the
idea of embracing a fellow citizen, a brother christian, perhaps some one, who
came from the same state, or had been in the same town, or seen my dear
parents, passed in rapid succession, and I was determined, betide what would,
to seek them the first opportunity. We were soon joined by the Mollah, who
repeatedly assured my examiners, that, though an infidel, I might be believed.
By his solicitation, I was to be released; but not until I would bind myself by
a solemn oath, administered after the christian manner, that I would never
speak to any of the American slaves. When this oath was proposed, I doubted
whether to take it; but, recollecting that, if I did not, I should be equally
debarred from seeing them, and suffer a grievous confinement, which could do
them no service, I consented and bound myself never directly or indirectly to
attempt to visit or converse with my fellow citizens in slavery. It was, at the
same time, intimated to me, that for the breach of this oath I might expect to
be impaled alive. -- Often, when I have drawn near the places of their
confinement and labors, I have regretted my submitting to this oath, and once
was almost tempted to break it, at seeing Captain O'Brien at some distance.

ARGUMENT.
The Author commences Acquaintance with Adonah Ben Benjamin, a Jew.

AFTER I had taken this oath, the officers departed, and I was liberated. I was
now more cautious in my rambles, avoided the notice of the Mussulmen
inhabitants, and made more frequent visits to that part of the city, inhabited
by Jews and foreigners. Refreshing myself with a glass of sherbet in an
inferior room, I was accosted by an old man, in mean attire, with a pack of
handkerchiefs and some remnants of silk and muslins on his back. He asked me,
if I was not the learned slave, and requested me to visit a sick son. I
immediately resolved to go with him; rejoicing that Providence, in my low
estate, had left me the power to be charitable. We traversed several streets
and stopped at the door of a house, which, in appearance, well suited my
conductor. It had but two windows toward the street, and those were closed up
with rough boards, the cracks of which were stuffed with rags and straw. My
conductor looked very cautiously about, and then, taking a key from his pocket,
opened the door. We passed a dark entry, and, I confess, I shuddered, as the
door closed upon me, reflecting that, perhaps, this man was employed to decoy
me to some secret place, in order to assassinate me, by the direction of my
superiors, who might wish to destroy me in this secret manner. But I had but
little time for these gloomy reflections; for, opening another door, I was
startled with a blaze of light, let into apartments splendidly furnished. My
conductor now assumed an air of importance, requested me to repose myself on a
silken couch, and retired. A young lady, who was veiled, of a graceful person
and pleasing address, soon brought a plate of sweetmeats and a bottle of
excellent wine. The old man soon reappeared; but, so changed in his habit and
appearance, I could scarce recognize him. He was now arrayed in drawers of the
finest linen, an embroidered vest, and loose gown of the richest Persian silk.
He smiled at my surprise, shook me by the hand, and told me that he was a Jew;
assuring me, that he was with his brethren under the protection of the Dey. The
outward appearance of his house, and the meanness of his attire abroad were, he
said, necessary to avoid envy and suspicion. But come, said he, I know all
about you; I can confide in you. Come refresh yourself with a glass of this
wine; -- neither Moses nor your Messiah forbid the use of it. We ate of the
collation, drank our wine liberally; and then he introduced me to his son, whom
I found laboring under a violent ague. I administered some sudorifics, and
left direction for the future treatment of my patient. Upon my departure, the
Jew put a zequin into my hand, and made me promise to visit his son again;
requesting me to seat myself in the place, he had found me, at the same hour,
the next day but one afterward; and, in passing through the dark entry,
conjured me not to mention his domestic style of living. The name of this Jew
was Adonah Ben Benjamin. I visited his son, according to appointment, and found
him nearly restored to health. The father and son both expressed great
gratitude; but the former told me he would not pay me for this visit in silver
or gold, but with something more valuable, by his advice. Come and see me
sometimes; I know this people well, and may render you more service than you
expect. I afterward visited this Jew frequently, and from him obtained much
information. He told me, in much confidence, that soon after I was taken, a Jew
and two Algerines made a tour of the United States, and sent home an accurate
account of the American commerce; and that the Dey was so impressed with the
idea of our wealth, that he would never permit the American slaves to be
ransomed under a large premium, which must be accompanied with the usual
presents, as a purchase of peace, and an annual tribute. Expressing my anxiety
to recover my freedom, he advised me to write to some of the American agents in
Europe. I accordingly addressed a letter to William Carmichael, Esquire charge des
affairs from the United States at the court of Madrid, representing my
deplorable circumstances, and the miserable estate of my fellow prisoners;
praying the interference of our government, stating the probable mode of access
to the Dey, and enclosing a letter to my parents. This my friend, the Jew,
promised to convey; but, as I never received any answer from Mr. Carmichael,
and my letters never found the way to my friends, I conclude, from the known
humanity of that gentleman, my letters miscarried.

Some time after, I heard that the United States had made application, through
Mr. I amb, for the redemption of their citizens, and I had hopes of liberty;
intending, if that gentleman succeeded in his negotiations, to claim my right
to be ransomed, as an American citizen, but his proposals were scouted with
contempt. I have sometimes heard this gentleman censured for failing to
accomplish the object of his mission, but very unjustly; as I well remember
that I, who was much interested in his success, never blamed him at the time;
and, I know, the ransom, he offered the Dey, was ridiculed in the common coffee
houses, as extremely pitiful. The few Algerines, I conversed with, affected to
represent it as insulting. It was reported, that he was empowered to offer only
two hundred dollars per head for each prisoner indiscriminately, when the
common price was four thousand dollars per head for a captain of a vessel, and
one thousand four hundred for a common fore mast sailor. When this unsuccessful
attempt failed, the prisoners were treated with greater severity; doubtless
with a design to affright the Americans into terms, more advantageous to the
Dey.

Finding my hopes of release from the applications of my country to fade, I
consulted the friendly Jew, who advised me to endeavor to pay my own ransom,
which, he said, might be effected with my savings from my practice by the
mediation of a rich Jew, his relation. I accordingly put all my savings into
Adonah Ben Benjamin's hands, which amounted to two hundred and eighty dollars,
and resolved to add to it all I could procure. To this intent I hoarded up all
I could obtain; denying myself the slender refreshments of bathing and cooling
liquors, to which I had been for some time accustomed. The benevolent Hebrew
promising that, when I had attained the sum requisite, within two or three
hundred dollars, he himself would advance the remainder, no miser was ever more
engaged than I to increase my store. After a tedious interval, my prospects
brightened surprisingly. Some fortunate operations, I performed, obtained me
valuable presents; one to the amount of fifty dollars. My stock, in the Jew's
hands, had increased to nine hundred dollars; and, to add to my good fortune,
the Jew told me, in great confidence, that, from the pleasing account of the
United States, which I had given him, for I always spoke of the privileges of
my native land with fervor, he was determined to remove with his family
thither. He said he would make up the deficiency in my ransom, and send me home
by the first European vessel, with letters to a Mr. Lopez, a Jew, who, he said,
lived in Rhode Island or Massachusetts, to whom he had a recommendation from a
relation, who had been in America. To Mr. Lopez he intended to consign his
property. He accordingly procured his friend, whose name I did not then learn,
to agree about my ransom. He concluded the contract at two thousand dollars. My
friends in the hospital expressed sorrow at parting with me; and making me some
pecuniary presents, I immediately added them to my stock, in the hands of the
Jew. In order to lessen the price of my ransom, the contractor had told my
master that he was to advance the money, and take my word to remit it, upon my
return to my friends. This story I confirmed. I went to the Jew's house, who
honestly produced all my savings; we counted them together, and he added the
remainder, tying the money up in two large bags, We spent a happy hour, over a
bottle of his best wine: I, in anticipating the pleasure my parents and
friends, would receive in recovering their son, who was lost, and the Jew in
framing plans of commerce in the United States, and in the enjoyment of his
riches in a country, where no despot should force from him his honest gains;
and, what added to my enjoyment, was the information that a vessel was to sail
for Gibraitar in two days, in which, he assured me, he would procure me a
passage. I returned to the hospital, exulting in my happy prospects. I was
quite beside myself with joy. I capered and danced as merrily, as my youthful
acquaintance at a husking. Sometimes I would be lost in thought, and then burst
suddenly into loud laughter. The next day toward evening, I hasted to the
house of my friend the Jew, to see if he had engaged my passage, and to gratify
myself with conversing upon my native land. Being intimate in the family, I was
entrusted with a key of the front door. I opened it hastily, and passing the
entry, knocked for admittance at the inner door, which was soon opened. But,
instead of the accustomed splendor, all was gloomy; the windows darkened, and
the family in tears. Poor Adonah Ben Benjamin had, that morning, been struck
with an apoplexy, and slept with his fathers. I soon retired as sincere a
mourner as the nearest kindred. I had indeed more reason to mourn than I
conceived; for, upon applying to his son for his assistance in perfecting my
freedom, which his good father had so happily begun, he professed the utmost
ignorance of the whole tranfaction; declared that he did not know the name of
the agent, his father had employed, and gave no credit to my account of the
moneys I had lodged with his father. I described the bags. He cooly answered,
that the God of his father Abraham had blessed his father Adonah with many such
bags. I left him, distracted with my disappointment. Sometimes I determined to
relate the whole story to the director of the hospital, and apply for legal
redress to a cadi; but the specimen I had of an Algerine law suit deterred me.
I had been so inadvertent, as to countenance the story that a Jew was to
advance the whole sum for me. If I had been a Mussulman, I might have attested
to my story; but a slave is never admitted as an evidence in Algiers, the West
Indies, or the Southern States. The disappointment of my hopes were soon known
in the hospital, though the hand Adonah Ben Benjamin had in the contract
remained a secret. The artful Jew, who had contracted for my ransom, fearing he
should have to advance the money himself, spread a report that I was immensely
rich in my own country. This coming to the ears of my master, he raised my
ransom to six thousand dollars, which the wily Israelite declining to pay, the
contract was dissolved. From my master I learned his name, and waited upon him,
hoping to obtain some evidence of Adonah's having received my money, at least
so far as to induce his son to restore it. But the Jew positively declared that
Adonah never told him other, than that he was to advance the cash himself.
Thus, from the brightest hopes of freedom, I was reduced to despair; my money
lost; and my ransom raised. I bless a merciful God that I was preserved from
the desperate folly of suicide. I never attempted my life; but, when I lay
down, I often hoped that I might never awake again, in this world of misery. I
grew dejected and my flesh wasted. The physicians recommended a journey into
the country, which my master approved; for, since the report of my wealth in my
native land, he viewed my life as valuable to him, as he doubted not my friends
would one day ransom me at an exorbitant premium.

ARGUMENT.
The Author, by Permission of his Master, travels to Medina, the burial Place
of the Prophet Mahomet.

THE director soon after proposed, that I should attend some merchants, as a
surgeon in a voyage and journey to Medina, the burial, and Mecca the birth,
place of the prophet Mahomet; assuring me, that I should be treated with
respect, and indeed find some agreeable companions on the tour, as several of
the merchants were infidels, like myself, and that any moneys I might acquire,
by itinerant practice, should be my own. I accepted this proposal with
pleasure, and was soon leased to two Mussulman merchants, who gave a kind of
bond for my safe return to my master. I had cash advanced me to purchase
medicines, and a case of surgeon's instruments, which I was directed to slow in
a large leather wallet. I took a kind leave of my patrons in the hospital, who
bestowed many little presents of sweetmeats, dates, and oranges. I waited upon
the good Mollah, who presented me with fifty dollars. I have charity to believe
that this man, though an apostate, was sincere in his faith in the Mohammedan
creed. He pressed my hand at parting, gave me many salutary cautions, as to my
conduct during the voyage; and said, while the tears started in his eyes, my
friend, you have suffered much misfortune and misery in a short life; let me
conjure you not to add the torments of the future to the miseries of the
present world. But, added he, pausing, who shall alter the decrees of God? I
flatter myself, that the scales of natal prejudice will yet fall from your
eyes, and that your name was numbered among the faithful from all eternity.

Our company consisted of two Algerine merchants, or factors, twenty pilgrims,
nine Jews, among whom was the son of my deceased friend Adonah, and two Greek
traders from Chios, who carried with them several bales of silks and a quantity
of mastic, to vend at Scandaroon, Grand Cairo and Medina. We took passage in a
Xebec; and, coasting the African shore, soon passed the ruins of ancient
Carthage, the Bay of Tunis; and, weathering cape Bona, and steering south
easterly, one morning hove in sight of the Island of Malta, inhabited by the
knights of that name, who are sworn enemies of the Mohammedan faith. I could
perceive, that the sight of this island gave a sensible alarm to the crew and
passengers. But the captain, or rather skipper, who was a blustering, rough
renegado, affected great courage and swore that, if he had but one cannon on
board, he would run down and give a broad side to the infidel dogs. His bravery
was soon put to the test; for, as the sun arose, we could discern plainly an
armed vessel bearing down upon us. She overhauled us fast, and our skipper
conjectured she bore the Maltese colors. All hands were now summoned to get
out some light sails, and several oars were put out, at which the brave skipper
tugged as lustily as the meanest of us. When the wind lulled and we gained of
the vessel, he would run upon the quarters of the Xebec, and hollow; "Come on,
you christian dogs, I am ready for you," I have some doubts, whether the vessel
ever noticed us. If she did, she despised us; for she tacked and stood to the
south west. This was no sooner perceived by our gallant commander, than he
ordered the Xebec to lay too, and swore, that he would pursue the uncircumcised
dogs, and board them; but he first would prudently ask the approbation of the
passengers, who instantly determined one and all that their business was such,
that they must insist upon the captain's making his best way to port. The
captain consented, but not without much grumbling at his misfortune, in losing
so fine a prize; and declared that, when he landed his passengers, he would
directly quit the port and renew the chase. After a smart run, we dropped anchor
in the port of Alexandria, called by the Turks Scandaroon. This is the site of
the ancient Alexandria, founded by Alexander the great; though its present
appearance would not induce an opinion of so magnificent a founder. It lies not
far from the westermost branch of the river Nile, by which, in ancient day, it
was supplied with water. The antiquarian eye may possibly observe, in the
scattered fragments of rocks, the vestiges of the ruins of its ancient
grandeur; but a vulgar traveller, from the appearance of the harbor, choked
with sand, the miserable buildings, and more wretched inhabitants of the town,
would not be led to conclude that this was the port, which rose triumphant on
the ruins of Tire and Carthage. We here hired camels; and, being joined by a
number of pilgrims and traders, collected from various parts of the Levant, we
proceeded toward Grand Cairo, the present capital of Egypt; and, after
traveling three days, or rather three nights, for we generally reposed in the
heat of the day, which is severe from one hour after the sun's rising until it
sets, we came to a pretty town on the west bank of the Nile, called Gize, and
hence passed over on rafts to the city of Grand Cairo, called by the Turks
Almizer; the suburbs of which extend to the river, but the principal town
commences its proper boundaries, at about three miles east of the Nile. I was
now within a comparatively short distance of two magnificent curiosities, I had
ever been desirous of beholding. The city of Jerusalem was only about five
day's journey to the south east, and I had even caught a glimpse of the
pyramids near Gize. I went with my masters and others to see a deep stoned pit,
in the castle, called Joseph's well; and said to have been dug by the direction
of that patriarch. I am not antiquarian enough to know the particular style of
Joseph's well architecture; but the water was sweet and extremely cold. The
Turks say that Potiphar's wife did not cease to persecute Joseph with her love,
after he was released from prison, and advanced to power; but the patriarch,
being warned by a dream to dig this well, and invite her to drink of the water,
which she had no sooner done, but one cup of it so effectually cooled her
desires, that she was ever afterward an eminent example of the most frigid
chastity. In Grand Cairo, we were joined by many pilgrims from Palestine, and
the adjacent countries. The third day, our carivan, which consisted of three
hundred camels and dromedaries, set out for Medina, under the convoy of a troop
of Mamaleuk's guards, a tawny, raw boned, ill clothed people. Some of the
merchants, and even pilgrims made a handsome appearance in person, dress, and
equipage. I was myself well mounted upon a camel, and carried with me only my
leather wallet of drugs, which I dispensed freely among the pilgrims; my
masters receiving the ordinary pay, while I collected many small sums, which
the gratitude of my patients added to the usual fee. We passed near the north
arm of the red sea, and then pursued our journey south, until we struck the
same arm again, near the place where the learned Wortley Montague has concluded
the Israelites, under the conduct of Moses, effected their passage. The breadth
of the sea here is great, and the waters deep and turbulent. The infidel may
sneer, if he chooses; but, for my own part, I am convinced beyond a doubt,
that, if the Israelites passed in this place, it must have been by the
miraculous interposition of a divine power. I could not refrain from reflecting
upon the infatuated temerity, which impelled the Egygtian king to follow them.
Well does the Latin poet exclaim; Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat. We
then traveled east, until we came to a small village, called Tadah. Here we
filled many goat skins with water, and laded our camels with them. In addition
to my wallet, I received two goat skins or bags of water upon my camel. The
weight, this useful animal will carry, is astonishing; and the facility and
promptitude, with which he kneels to receive his rider and burden, surprising.
We now entered the confines of Arabia Petrea, very aptly denominated the rocky
Arabia; for, journeying south east, we passed over many ridges of mountains,
which appeared of solid rocks, while the valleys and plains between them were
almost a quicksand. Not a tree, shrub, or vegetable is to be seen. In these
valleys, the sun poured intolerable day, and its reflections from the land were
insupportable. No refreshing breeze is here felt. The intelligent traveller
often fears the rising of the wind, which blows such sultry gales, that man and
beast often sink beneath them, "never to rise again" or, when agitated into a
tempest drive the sand with such tumultuous violence, as to overwhelm whole
caravans. Such indeed were the stories told me, as I passed these dreary
plains. The only inconvenience, I sustained, arose from the intense heat of the
sun, and the chills of the night, which our thin garments were not calculated
to exclude. On the third day, after we left Tadah, the water, which we
transported on our camels, was nearly expended. These extraordinary animals had
not drank but once, since our departure. Near the middle of the fourth day, I
observed our camels snuff the air, and soon set off in a brisk trot, and just
before night brought us to water. This was contained in only one deep well,
dug, like a reversed pyramid, with steps, to descend on every side, to the
depth of one hundred feet; yet the sagacity of the camel had discovered this
water at perhaps twenty miles distance. So my fellow travelers asserted; but I
have since thought, whether these camels, from frequently passing this desert
country, did not discover their approach to water, rather from the eye, noting
familiar objects, than the actual scenting the water itself. A horse that has
journeyed the whole day, will quicken his step at night, when, upon a familiar
road, within some miles of an accustomed stable. Our escort delighted in the
mavelous. Many a dreadful story did they tell of poisonous winds and
overwhelming sands; and of the fierce wandering Arabs, who captured whole
caravans, and eat their prisoners. Many a bloody battle had they fought with
this cruel banditti, in which, according to their narratives, they always came
off conquerours. Frequently were we alarmed, to be in readiness to combat their
savage free booters; though I never saw but two of the wild Arabs, in the whole
of our journey. They joined us at a little village, east of Islamboul, and
accosted us with great civility. They were dressed in blue frocks, girded round
the waste with parti-colored sashes, in which were stuck a pistol and a long
knife. Their legs were bare, and sheepskin caps covered their heads. Their
complexions were sallow, but their garments and persons were clean. Indeed,
their dress and address evinced them to be of a more civilized race than our
guards, who affected to treat them with lofty hauteur; and, when they departed,
assured us that they were spies, and that an attack from their countrymen might
now be apprehended with certainly; if, said the leader of our escort, they are
not terrified by finding you under our protection.

CHAP. XXXII.
Procul! O procul! este profani.
VIRGIL.
ARGUMENT.
The Author is blessed with the Sight and Touch of a most holy Mohammedan Saint.

WHEN we were within one day's journey of Medina, we halted for a longer time
than usual; occasioned, as I found, by the arrival of a most holy saint. As I
had never seen a saint, being bred, in a land, where even the relics of these
holy men are not preserved, for I believe all New England cannot produce so
much as a saint's rotten tooth or toe nail, I was solicitous to see and
converse with this blessed personage. I soon discovered him, in the midst of
about fifty pilgrims, some of whom were devoutly touching their foreheads with
the hem of his garment, while others, still more devout, prostrated themselves
on the ground, and kissed the prints of his footsteps in the sand. Though I was
assured, that he was filled with divine love, and conferred felicity on all,
who touched him; yet, to outward appearance, he was the most disgusting,
contemptible object, I had ever seen. Figure to yourselves, my readers, a
little decrepit, old man, made shorter by stooping, with a countenance, which
exhibited a vacant stare, his head bald, his finger and toe nails as long as
hawks' claws, his attire squalid, his face, neck, arms, and legs begrimed with
dirt and swarming with vermin, and you will have some faint idea of this
Mussulman saint. As I was too reasonable to expect that holiness existed in a
man's exterior, I waited to hear him speak; anticipating, from his lips, the
profoundest wisdom, delivered in the honied accents of the saints in bliss. At
length he spoke; and his speech betrayed him, a mere idiot. While this
astonished me, it raised the respect of his admirers, who estimated his
sanctity in an inverse ratio to the weakness of his intellects. If they could
have ascertained, that he was born an idiot, I verily believe, they would have
adored him; for the Mahometans are taught by their alcoran, that the souls of
saints are often lodged in the bodies of idiots; and these pious souls, being
so intent on the joys of paradise, is the true reason, that the actions of
their bodies are so little suited to the manners of this world. This saint
however did not aspire to the sanctity of a genuine idiot; though, I fancy, his
modesty injured his preferment, for he certainly had very fair pretensions. It
was resolved, that the holy man should go with us; and, to my great
mortification and disgust, he was mounted behind me on the same camel; my
Mohammedan friends probably conceiving, that he would so far communicate his
sanctity by contact, as that it might affect my conversion to their faith.
Whatever were their motives, in the embraces of this nausseous being, with the
people prostrating themselves in reverence on each side, I made my entry into
the city of Medina.

ARGUMENT.
The Author visits the City of Medina: Description of the Prophet's Tomb, and
principal Mosque.

MEDINA Tadlardh, erroneously called Medina Talmabi, is situated in Arabia
Deserta, about forty five miles east from the borders of the red sea. To this
place, as has been before related, the prophet sled, when driven from Mecca his
birth place; and here he was buried, and his remains still are preserved, in a
silver cussin, ornamented with a golden crescent, enriched with jewels, covered
with cloth of gold, supported upon silver tassels, and shadowed by a canopy,
embroidered with silk and gold thread upon silver tissue. This canopy is
renewed annually, by the bashaw of Egypt; though other bashaws, and great men
among the Turks, often assist in the expense, or augment the value of the
yearly present, by silver lamps and other ornaments. The whole are contained in
a magnificent mosque, in which are suspended innumerable gold and silver lamps,
some of which are kept continually burning, and all are lighted on certain
public occasions; and even upon the approach of some dignified pilgrim. I had
not acquired sufficient holiness, from my blessed companion, to be permitted to
enter this sanctified building. The Arabians are profusely extravagant, in the
titles they bestow on the city of Medina; calling it the most holy, most
renowned, most excellent city; the sanctuary of the blessed fugitive; model of
the refulgent city in the celestial paradise; and some of the great vulgar
suppose, that when the world shall be destroyed, this city, with the prophet's
remains, will be transported by angels, with all its inhabitants, to paradise.
We tarried there but a few hours, as the great object of the devotions of the
pilgrims was Mecca. Pilgrimages are performed to both places; but those to
Medina are not indispensably necessary; being directed by the book of the
companions of the apostles, while those to Mecca are enjoined by the alcoran
itself. The former are supposed meritorious, the latter necessary to salvation.
I had the curiosity to inquire respecting the prophet's cossin being suspended
in the air by a load stone, and was assured that this was a mere christian
obloquy, as no pretensions of any such suspension were ever made.

ARGUMENT.
The Author visits Mecca: Description of the Al Kaaba, or House of God.

BEING freed from my blessed companion, I had an agreeable journey from Medina
to Mecca, which is the most ancient city in all Arabia; situated about two
hundred miles south east of Medina, twenty one degrees and forty five minutes
north latitude, and one hundred and sixteen degrees east longitude, from
Philadelphia, according to late American calculations. I saw the great mosque
in the center of Mecca, which it is said, far surpasses in grandeur that of
Sancta Sophia in Constantinople. It certainly is a very august building, the
roof of which is refulgent; but even the inhabitants smiled at my credulity,
when I observed that I had read it was covered with plated gold. This mosque
contains within its limits the grand object of the Mussulman's pilgrimage; the
Al Kaaba, or house of God, said to have been built by the hands of the
patriarch Abraham; to confirm which the Arabian priests show a black stone,
upon which they say Abraham laid his son Isaac, when he had bound him in
preparation for his intended sacrifice. This stone and building were great
objects of veneration, before the mission of the prophet, and he artfully
availed himself of this popular prejudice, in rendering the highest respect to
the holy house, in his life time, and enjoining upon his followers, without
distinction among males, to visit it once in their lives. The advent of the
prophet was said to be announced from the four corners of the house, which
exhibit the four cardinal points. Few pilgrims are permitted to enter this
sacred, venerable building; but, after traveling, some of them perhaps a
thousand miles, they are content to prostrate themselves in the courts, which
surround it. Few Mahometans perform this pilgrimage in person; those who do are
highly respected. This pilgrimage was enjoined, by the prophet, to be performed
in person; but, when he laid this injunction, it is not probable he anticipated
the extensive spread of his doctrines. So long as his disciples were limited by
the boundaries of Arabia, or had only extended themselves over a part of Syria,
this pious journey was practicable and easy; but, when the crescent rose
triumphant on the sea coast, and most of the interior of Africa, when it shone
with splendor in Persia, Tartary, and Turkey, and even adorned the Moorish
minarit in Spain, actual pilgrimage was deemed impracticable; and the faithful
were allowed to visit the Kaaba by deputy. The ingenuity of more modern times
has alleviated this religious burden still further, by allowing the deputy to
substitute other attorneys under him. Thus for example: the pious Mussulman in
Belgrade will employ a friend at Constantinople, who will empower another
friend at Scandaroon to procure a confidential friend at Grand Cairo to go in
the name of him at Belgrade, and perform his pilgrimage to Mecca. Certificates
of these several substitutions are preserved, and the lazy Mussulman hopes by
this finesse to reap the rewards of the faithful in paradise.

ARGUMENT.
The Author returns to Scandaroon: Finds Adonah's Son sick: His Contrition: Is
restored to Health.

AFTER tarrying sixteen days at Mecca, during which time my masters fasted,
prayed, performed their devotions at the Kaaba, and sold their merchandise, we
retraced the same rout to Scandaroon. Here we found the son of Adonah Ben
Benjamin, who had been detained in this place by sickness, so weakened from a
tedious slow fever that his life was despaired of. He expressed great joy, at
our return, and begged my professional assistance; assuring me, that he
esteemed his present disorder a judicial punishment from the God of his
fathers, for the injury he had done me; heartily confessing, that he knew of
his father's having received my money, which he would restore upon our return
to Algiers, if I would effect his recovery. He prevailed upon my masters that I
should abide in the house with him, during their absence, as they were engaged
upon a trading tour to a place called Ginge, upon the river Nile. I exerted all
my skill, both as a physician and nurse. Perhaps my attention in the latter
capacity, assisted by his youth, was of more service than my prescriptions. Be
that as it may, he recovered rapidly, and in ten days was able to walk the
streets; but I could not help noticing with sorrow, that as his strength
increased, his gratitude and promises to refund my money decreased.

ARGUMENT.
The Gratitude of a Jew.

ONE day, walking on the beach, the Jew looked me steadily in the face; and,
laying his hand upon my shoulder, said I owe you my life, I owe you money,
which you cannot oblige me to pay. You think, a Jew will always deceive in
money matters. You are mistaken. You shall not wait for your pay in Algiers; I
will pay you here in Alexandria. I owe you one thousand dollars on my father's
account. Now, what do you demand for restoring me to health? Nothing replied I,
overjoyed at his probity; restore me my money, and you are welcome to my
services. This must not be, said the son of Adonah, I have done wickedly, but
mean not only to pay you, but satisfy my own conscience. I will allow you in
addition to the one thousand dollars, two thousand more for your assistance, as
a physician; and then will advance three thousand more, which I will take your
word to repay me, when you are able. I was astonished. I seized his hand and
felt his pulse, to discover if he was not delirious. His pulse were regular,
and I knew his ability to perform his promise. We will meet here on the morrow,
and I will pay you. I met him the next day, and he was not ready to make
payment. I now began to doubt his promises, and blame myself for the delusions
of hope. By his appointment I met him the third day, on a retired part of the
beach, westward from the port. We now saw a man approaching us. That man, said
the Jew, will pay you. You well understand, my friend, that your ransom is
fixed at six thousand dollars. Now, whoever gives you your liberty, really pays
you that sum. I have engaged the person, who is approaching, and who is the
master of a small vessel, to transport you to Gibraltar, whence you may find
your way home. The man now joined us and confirmed the words of the Jew, for
whom he professed a great friendship. It was concluded, that I should come to
that spot immediately after dark, where I should find a small boat waiting to
carry me on board the vessel. The master of the vessel declaring, that he run a
great risk, in assisting in my escape; but was willing to do it out of
commiseration for me, and friendship for the Jew; and reminded me, that I had
better pack up all my property, and bring it with me. I hastened home with the
Jew, and collected all the property I could with propriety call my own; which
consisted of a few clothes, and to the amount of three hundred and twenty
dollars in cash. As soon as it was dark, the Jew accompanied me to the beach,
and then took an affectionate leave of me, presenting me with the value of ten
dollars, as a loan, gravely remarking, that now I owed him three thousand and
ten dollars, which he hoped I would transport to him as soon as I arrived in
America. The Jew quitted me, and I soon discovered the approach of the boat,
which I slept into with a light heart, congratulating myself, that I was again
A FREE MAN. The boat soon rowed along side of a vessel, that was laying to for
us. I jumped on board, and was directly seized by two men, who bound me and
hurried me below deck; and, after robbing me of all my property, left me in the
dark to my own reflections. I had been so long the sport of cruel fortune, that
these were not so severe, as my sympathising readers may conjecture. Repeated
misfortunes blunt sensibility. I perceived that I had been played a villainous
trick, and exchanged a tolerable slavery, for one perhaps more insupportable;
but should have been perfectly resigned to my fate, if the dread of being
returned to Algiers and suffering the dreadful punishment, already related, had
not presented itself. In the morning, I requested to see the captain; and, by
his orders, was brought upon deck; to my surprise, it was not the same person
who had decoyed me on board. I was confounded. I intended to have expostulated;
but could I tell a stranger, a man, who appeared a Mussulman by his garb, that
I was a runaway slave? While I was perplexing myself what to say, the man, who
had decoyed me on board, appeared. He was a passenger, and claimed me as his
slave, having purchased me, as he said, for four hundred zequins of a Jew, my
former master, and meant to carry me with him to Tunis. I was now awakened to
all the horrors of my situation. I dared not irritate my new master by
contradictions, and acquiesced in his story in dumb despair. On the eighth day,
after we departed from Scandaroon, the vessel made cape Bona, and expected soon
to anchor in the port of Tunis. My master had a Portuguese slave on board, who
slept in the birth with me. He spoke a little broken English, having been
formerly a sailor on board a vessel of that nation. He gave me the most
alarming apprehensions of the cruelty of our master, but flattered me by saying
that the Tunise in general were more mild with their slaves than the Algerines,
and allowed a freer intercourse with the European merchants; and, by their
interference, we might obtain our liberty. While my fellow slave slept, I lay
agonizing with the dread of entering the port of Tunis. Often did I wish that
some friendly rock or kindly leak would sink me, and my misfortunes, in
perpetual oblivion; and I was nigh being gratified in my desperate wishes; for,
the same night, a tremendous storm arose, and the gale struck us with such
violence, that our sails were instantly flittered into rags. We could not show
a yard of canvass, and were obliged to scud under bare poles. The night was
excessively dark; and, to increase our distress, our ballast shifted and we
were obliged to cut away our masts by the board, to save us from foundering.
The vessel righted, but being strong and light, and the hatchways being well
secured, our captain was only fearful of being driven on some christian coast.
The next night, the wind lulled; and the morning after, the sun arose clear,
and we found ourselves off the coast of Sardinia, and within gun shot of an
armed vessel. She proved to be a Portuguese frigate. To the confusion and
dismay of our captain and passenger, and to the great joy of myself and fellow
slave. The frigate hoisted her colors, manned her boats, and boarded us. No
sooner was his national flag displayed, than the overjoyed Portuguese ran below
and liberated me from my fetters, hugged me in raptures, and hauling me upon
deck, the first man we met was our master, whom he saluted with a kick, and
then spit in his face. I must confess that this reverse of fortune made me feel
for the wretched Mussulman, who stood quivering with apprehensions of instant
death; nor could I refrain from preventing the Portuguese from avenging himself
for the cruelties, he had suffered, under this barbarian. The boats soon
boarded us, and secured the captain and crew, whom they treated with as much
bitter contempt, as my fellow had exercised toward our late master. This poor
fellow soon introduced me to his countrymen, with a brief account of my country
and misfortunes.

ARGUMENT.
Conclusion.

THE Portuguese officers treated me with politeness; and, when they were
rifling the vessel, requested me to select my property from the plunder. I was
then sent on board the frigate. The captain expressed much joy, at being the
means of my deliverance, and told me, that the Portuguese had a sincere regard
for the Americans; and that he had received express orders to protect our
commerce from the Barbary corsairs. The prisoners were brought on board and
confined below; and, after every thing valuable was taken from the prize, the
ship stood for the straits of Gibraltar, leaving a boat to fire the Tunise
vessel. I never received more civility than from the officers of this frigate.
In compliment to them, I was obliged to throw my Mohammedan dress over the
ship's side; for they furnished me with every necessary, and many ornamental
articles of European clothing. The surgeon was particularly attentive. I lent
him some assistance among the sick, his mate being unwell; and, among other
presents, he gave me a handsome pocket case of surgical instruments. After a
pleasant voyage, we anchored in port Logos, in the southern extremity of
Portugal. Here I received the agreeable intelligence, that the United States
were about commencing a treaty with the Dey of Algiers, by the agency of Joseph
Donaldson, jun. Esquire which would liberate my unhappy fellow citizens, and secure
the American commerce from future depredations. Without landing, I had the good
fortune to obtain a passage on board an English merchantman, bound for Bristol,
Captain Joseph, Joceline, commander. We had a prosperous voyage to the land's
end; and, very fortunately for me, just off the little isle of Lundy, spoke
with a brigantine, bound to Chesapeak Bay, Captain John Harris, commander. In
thirty two days, we made Cape Charles, the north chop of the Chesapeak, and I
prevailed upon the captain to set me on shore; and, on the third day of May,
one thousand seven hundred and ninety five, I landed in my native country,
after an absence of seven years and one month; about six years of which I had
been a slave. I purchased a horse, and hastened home to my parents, who
received me as one risen from the dead. I shall not attempt to describe their
emotions, or my own raptures. I had suffered hunger, sickness, fatigue, insult,
stripes, wounds, and every other cruel injury; and was now under the roof of
the kindest and tenderest of parents. I had been degraded to a slave, and was
now advanced to a citizen of the freest country in the universe. I had been
lost to my parents, friends, and country; and now found, in the embraces and
congratulations of the former, and the rights and protection of the latter, a
rich compensation for all past miseries. From some minutes I preserved, I
compiled these memoirs; and, by the solicitations of some respectable friends,
have been induced to submit them to the public. A long disuse of my native
tongue, will apologize to the learned reader for any inaccuracies.

I now mean to unite myself to some amiable woman, to pursue my practice, as a
physician; which, I hope, will be attended with more success than when essayed
with the inexperience and giddiness of youth. To contribute cheerfully to the
support of our excellent government, which I have learnt to adore, in schools
of despotism; and thus secure to myself the enviable character of an useful
physician, a good father and worthy FEDERAL citizen.

My ardent wish is, that my fellow citizens may profit by my misfortunes. If
they peruse these pages with attention they will perceive the necessity of
uniting our federal strength to enforce a due respect among other nations. Let
us, one and all, endeavor to sustain the general government. Let no foreign
emissaries inflame us against one nation, by raking into the ashes of long
extinguished enmity or delude us into the extravagant schemes of another, by
recurring to fancied gratitude. Our first object is union among ourselves. For
to no nation besides the United States can that ancient saying be more
emphatically applied; BY UNITING WE STAND, BY DIVIDING WE FALL.
