THE HAUNTED CAVERN: A CALEDONIAN TALE.

In the most high and pa^my state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets
Stars shone with trains of fire, dews of blood fell,
Disasters veiled the Sun, and the moist star,
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
Was sick almost to Doom's day with eclipse!
By John Palmer, Junior.

DEDICATION.
To Miss FARREN.
Madam,
IN accepting the permission you so kindly gave, of dedicating the following
sheets to you, it may perhaps be said, that, like many other young authors, I
seek to shelter my own imperfections under the sanction of a high name. But to
whom could I dedicate a first attempt with so much propriety, as to a lady,
who, to the splendour of public talents, adds the dignity of private worth, and
whose goodness of heart will I am sure, pardon the errors which a refined taste
must condemn? novels, as well as the drama, are closely allied to fiction; and
the most shining ornament of the latter, cannot but be a competent judge of the
former. That you will find much to blame in the Caledonian Tale, I am certain;
at the same time I cherish a hope, that you will find somewhat to commend: At
all events I feel a conscious pride in thus offering it to you, as a small
token of that respectful esteem with which I am,

Madam, Your much obliged, And very faithful Servant, JOHN PALMER, Jun.

THE HAUNTED CAVERN.
CHAP. I.
There is a Power
Unseen, that rules the illimitable world,
That guides its motion from the brightest star,
To the least dull of this sin tainted mould;
While Man, who madly deems himself the lord
Of all, is naught but weakness and dependence.
This sacred truth, by sure experience taught,
Thou must have learnt, when wandering all alone,
Each bird, each insect, flitting through the sky,
Was more sufficient for itself than thou!
THOMPSON.
IN the wild and barren country of Aberdeenshire, within a league of the
seashore, and on the summit of a lofty hill, stood a gothic castle. The
battered walls that had for ages severely felt the resistless hand of time were
here and there decayed and crumbling into dust; the battlements which seemed
enveloped in the clouds, were all overgrown with ivy, and become the abode of
the ill-favored and ominous feathered race. No vicinity, save a few straggling
cottages, the habitations of the vassals; no sound, but where the ocean in
sullen fury, lashed the sandy beach, and dismal murmurs echoed through the rocks.

This mansion, while the scepter of England was swayed by Henry the VIth, was
the property of Sir James Wallace, a descendant of that illustrious character,
William Wallace, who chose to encounter the perils and the frowns of war,
rather than see his country become the spoil of a rapacious invader. Surely the
eye that peruses thy fate, will not, cannot, refuse the tribute of a tear to
thy remembrance! Peace to thy hallowed shade; and may thy manly virtues meet
with the reward above that was denied them here!

The castle had been bestowed on William as some small recompense for the
services he had done his king and country, and had from that period continued
in his family.

Sir James resembled not his noble ancestor; of a sordid disposition,
deceitful, cruel, and designing, his heart was a stranger to humanity or
compassion. The smiling cherub Charity dared not approach his inhospitable
roof; and the child of necessity, who at his portal craved a scrap of bread,
was not only peremptorily refused, but if instigated by biting want to repeat
the request, was spurned from off the threshold.

The partner of his bed was a being every way opposite to himself: her
susceptible heart never felt greater satisfaction than in relieving the needy,
reclaiming the abandoned, and rewarding the virtuous!

Matilda, so she was called, was daughter to the Lord Glencairn, a man who, but
for one failing, was formed an ornament to society. Ambition was his darling
passion, and the wish of aggrandizing, and enriching his family, wholly
employed his thoughts.

At the castle of this Baron, Sir James first saw lady Wallace, and asked her
of the Earl, who joyfully consented to accept him as his son. Not so Matilda;
the dissimilarity of disposition with which nature had endued herself, and
Wallace, caused her justly to look with horror on the approaching nuptials. Nor
was that the only reason; her gentle heart had long and faithfully been given
to another. Alan Duntrone, of a noble, but unfortunate family, whose chief
boast consisted of an illustrious descent, and an unspotted reputation, was the
object of her affection. He had, sometime before embarked for France, to serve
under the banners of the Gallic Monarch; and had not been long upon the
continent, ere the fatal news arrived that he had fallen covered with wounds
and glory. But the heart of Matilda was too firmly attached ever to be
withdrawn from her first and only love.

Glencairn commanded his daughter on pain of denouncing a curse upon her head,
to become the wife of Wallace. The timid and dutiful victim yielded to the
rigor of her unnatural parent, and at the altar presented her hand, and pledged
those vows which were in the possession of her lost Alan.

Alas! can the gaudy splendour of a court, the noisy riot of a midnight banquet,
or a profusion of useless ore, insure content? Erroneously too often do parents
judge, and while they fondly flatter themselves they are ensuring their
offspring's happiness, plunge them in lasting misery!

A short time subsequent to the marriage of Lady Wallace, her father paid the
great debt to nature, and on his deathbed declared the injustice he had done
his child, implored her pardon, and closed his eyes for ever, in hopes of
meeting more mercy above, than he had shown his daughter here.

The edge of her grief (for spite of the harsh treatment she had experienced,
she tenderly loved her Father) was somewhat blunted by the birth of a female,
whose helpless infancy aroused her from the stupor into which she had sunk, and
for whose sake alone she wished to live.

Fortune whose delight it is to sport and trifle with the feelings of mankind,
fully evinced her blindness, and disregard of merit, in the fate of Matilda.

The barren habitation in the north ill suited with the libertine disposition
of Sir James, and his chief time was spent at Edinburgh, where in the bustle of
the Scottish Court, he forgot his suffering wife; immured in a solitary castle,
without a friend into whose breast she could pour her sorrows, and hope for
consolation. The stillness in which she sat and watched the slumbers of her
little cherub, were uninterrupted, save by the distant roaring of the waves,
and whistling of the wind, which howled discordant through the ancient pile,
and were at intervals accompanied by the voice of the nightly screech owl,
melancholy inhabitant of the lofty battlements.

Yet even this sad consolation she was in a short time deprived of. Her
worthless lord had bestowed his heart on a woman, in whose breast vice reigned
as predominant as did virtue in that of his consort; she was the widow of an
officer about the king's person; her birth was low, and the elevated rank
wherein she had latterly shone, was insufficient to irradicate the selfish
ideas that were ingrafted by nature in her disposition. The thought of such a
man as Wallace at her feet, at once flattered her vanity, and made that
restless ambition, which had been long kindling in her bosom, burn with
insatiate fury. After a time spent in All the arts of wilful woman,
Laboring for her purpose,
she yielded to his desires, with this proviso, that he banished his deserving
lady the castle, and substituted herself as mistress. He, no less a dupe than
villain, consented, and instantly set out for Aberdeen, where on his arrival,
he acquainted Matilda with the reason of his unlooked-for visit; and farther
informed her she must then, it being night, depart, but that her infant should
remain behind.

The feelings of a mind, susceptible as here is, may be better imagined than
described. On one side, her passions were torn by wounded pride, while on the
other the softer senses were roused by maternal affection.

Recovering herself, however, she yielded to necessity, snatched a parting kiss
from her darling babe, moistened its little face with tears, and left the
Castle, attended only by Carrol, a creature of Sir James's, who had orders to
convey her on board a vessel that lay at the shore, from thence to proceed to
Rouen, and lodge her in a convent, the abbess of which by bribes and promises,
he had made his own.

Carrol executed his commission punctually, he delivered his trust, with a
strict charge that a scrutinizing eye should be kept upon her conduct; then
returned, and rendered his master happy, by informing him "his loudest fears
were hushed."

Jane (the daughter of Wallace) was thus, in the age of infancy, left without a
friend who would instruct her inexperienced mind, and train her in the sacred
paths of virtue!

A short time previous to the exilement of Lady Wallace, her brother Archibald,
who had succeeded the late Earl, his father, in the title and estates, suddenly
disappeared; nor were the most accurate enquiries able to penetrate the mystery
in which his fate was involved. Every search proving abortive, Sir James sent
his trusty follower Carrol to the Castle of Glencairn, with orders to bring his
nephew Eldred, son to the aforementioned Archibald, to Edinburgh, as he
designed to take upon himself the guardianship of the young Baron.

On his arrival, he resided with Wallace, who, when he wrote to inform his
infamous paramour of the steps he had taken in the north, requested her
presence, and that of his juvenile charge. She joyfully obeyed the mandate, and
arrived at the castle, where she met with a splendid reception from the lord of
it.

CHAP. II.
How great a t^il to stem the raging flood,
When beauty stirs the mass of youthful blood!
When the sw^^^ veins with circling torrents rise,
And softer passions speak through wishing eyes!
SPENCER.
ELDRED, the young Lord of Glencairn, who was about the age of Jane, was happy
in such a playmate; they let the hours glide by in pleasure, and never did
there appear a tedious one, but that on which they parted for the night.

Thus did they beguile their time till Eldred attained his 18th year, and
though reared by his uncle in a manner more suited to the abject station of a
servile lacquey, than the representative of an illustrious house, he discovered
a disposition replete with valor, and affability. To his inferiors,
condescending as the pliant reed to every puff of wind; but to those who sought
to play upon his generous nature he resembled the stubborn forest oak, that
bids defiance to the jarring elements, and braves the fury of the winter's
storm.

The youthful amusements of Jane, and her cousin, had insensibly created a
sincere and ardent affection, which on their nearer approach to maturity,
gained strength; nothing seemed wanting to complete their happiness. Too
transient is the bliss of mortals, shallow is the cup of joy presented to their
lips, and scarce do they taste the enticing beverage, ere the bitter dregs at
bottom destroy the flavor of the wished for draught!

Such was the case of our young lovers; fortune was about to turn her wheel,
and hurl them from the spoke of felicity to agony intolerable.

Fame had blown the beauty of Jane to the remotest parts of Caledonia's land,
and a powerful and wealthy Highland Chief, named Donald of the Isles, (between
whose father and Sir James had subsisted a strong friendship) was induced by
her voice to quit his paternal fields, and judge whether report had or had not
exaggerated. With a numerous retinue of knights and retainers he arrived at the
mansion of Wallace, and was welcomed there with pomp and affected hospitality.

With impatience did he tarry for the minute that was to introduce him to the
object who had caused his journey. But when he saw her he thought that had he
been kept for ages in suspense, this one interview would have amply repaid him.
All day did he contemplate her charms, and when the hour of darkness warned him
to retire, cursed the tedious night that tore her from his sight. Lost were the
luxuries of the banquet on him, nor could the copious draughts of wine he
swallowed, wash away the passion which had taken root on his heart. He retired
not to rest, but to devise the means by which he should make her his own. At
last he resolved to ask her of Sir James, but not till he had predetermined, in
case he had met with a refusal, force should put him in possession of what was
denied to his entreaties.

To a mind like his nothing appeared impracticable; of strong passions, and
unable to restrain them, it is not a matter of wonder he soon fixed his
resolution, nor could the most imminent danger, or opposition, have put him
from his purpose. Of a bold and martial deportment, he had all that ferocity in
his countenance, which marks the Caledonians: brave to an excess, but artful to
an equal degree, and would have waded through the blood of multitudes to
accomplish his desires: Such was the character of Eldred's rival.

He preferred his courtship with studied smiles, and speeches formed by art and
cunning; she heard him at first with indifference, he persisted and was
requitted with contempt. He then addressed his suit to the Baron, he boasted of
the high renown of his ancestors, and the wide extent of his domain, he
expatiated on the number of his vassals, and set forward the mutual advantages
that would accrue from an alliance. Wallace listened to him with attention,
while he recollected with disgust the attachment he had observed to subsist
between Jane and Eldred. He sought his daughter and commanded her to receive
the addresses of his guest.

In vain the astonished maid lamented, wept, entreated; in vain she prostrated
herself at the feet of her unfeeling father; in vain she tore her disordered
locks, and smote her breast in anguish! Her supplications far from mitigating,
added ^uel to his resentment, and confirmed him in his ungenerous purpose: he
mingled curses, and unkind reproaches, with his persuasions.

"Alas! said Jane, "Can Donald prize the constrained embraces of a heart that
beats for another? Will sighs and groans accord with the caresses of a
bridegroom? To Eldred my faith is given, never, never to be broken!"

"By the Holy-rood! replied Sir James, "This obstinacy irritates me; nor shall
my wishes be fustrated by the idle pretensions of a boy; pay therefore the
regard^ and deference due to my mandate, or woe upon thy head. Meantime,
preparations shall be made for the solemnity. Mark my words, and see thou do
obey them!"

Then, with indignation bursting from his eye, he quitted the chamber, leaving
his daughter in a state of stupefaction, till the entrance of Eldred awoke her
from a trance, who approaching, perceived the tears fast trickling down her
lilly cheek, and with eager affection conjured her to make known the cause;
which, when he knew, rage so shook his frame as to deprive him of articulation.

After a pause, "Can heaven," he exclaimed, "suffer such injustice? O Jane, if
thy affection be ardent, as I flatter myself it is, you cannot refuse the boon
which thus on my knees I crave!"

"Pronounce it," quoth Jane, "you know full well I can deny you naught."

"Enchanting sound!" cried the enraptured lover, "Oh! then, my best beloved,
consent to fly with me beyond the reach of such parental cruelty; in some far
distant private corner of the kingdom, let us obliterate the remembrance of
your father's cruelty, and soothe the ^ant of wealth, by being in possession of
each other.

The bare idea of such a step, at first made the timid soul of Jane recoil; to
quit the Castle clandestinely, and with a man, how must, she thought, her
reputation suffer!

At length, however, these fears and scruples were overruled by the persuasive
eloquence of Eldred, and the conscious purity of her own intentions.

"Yet," said Glencairn, "Can I resolve to immure those beauties in a cottage,
which heaven bestowed to grace a court? Impossible!

"Let not that thought disturb you," returned his mistress, "Contentment is the
source of bliss, the clay-built hovel will when you are present, appear a
gorgeous palace, and the humble pallet, whereon I shall repose me, will yield a
more refreshing slumber, than, robbed of thee, I should find under the richest
canopy.

The young Lord seized her hand, and imprinting a kiss thereon, vowed her
happiness should constitute the future study of his life.

THE next consideration was, how and when they should effect their escape; it
was determined to meet at midnight near a cavern that was situated at no great
distance from the castle, and had formerly, in those times when the English
Edward was wont to invade his neighbors kingdom, been converted by the Scots
into a prison, wherein they cast such of the enemy as became their captives. It
had not been used by the state for near a century, and the key had ever
remained in custody of the Wallaces.

This spot was fixed upon as the least liable to discovery, a vulgar notion
having prevailed among the peasants that it was haunted; nay, they went so far
as to aver they had heard frequent and melancholy noises issue from it. This
superstition Sir James had strenuously endeavored to suppress, swearing whoever
dared to propagate such idle vague reports, should pay for their credulity.

Tediously, to the lovers, did the steeds of Phoebus go their daily course, and
with impatience they watched their descent behind the western hills. The chapel
clock announcing the hour of twelve, Jane hastened to the place of rendezvous,
and Glencairn not being arrived, seated herself upon a fragment of stone,
bitterly lamenting her wayward fate.

"How cruel," she said, "is my destiny; deprived in my earliest infancy of a
mother's fostering care, commanded by a harsh father to give my hand unto a man
whose mind I am utterly unacquainted with. Spirit of my departed and revered
parent, arm my soul with fortitude to bear -- "

"Her care is still for you," exclaimed a voice; while Jane, horror-struck,
threw her eyes around, and perceived a figure suddenly turn an angle of the
cavern; at this instant a dusky cloud enveloping the moon, left her in perfect
darkness, and on returning light in vain she sought for the cause of her
surprise.

Scarce had she recovered from her panick, ere the sound of footsteps rekindled
her fears, which were as quickly dispelled when she saw Glencairn approach. She
informed him of her extraordinary adventure, which he sought to persuade her
was but the coinage of her brain; yet too firmly was it impressed on the mind
of Jane, to be persuaded it was fancy.

After some time, bestowed in mutual vows, sealed by their lips and witnessed
by the chaste Diana, they appointed a meeting early on the ensuing morn at a
cottage in the near valley. The owner was a venerable woman, who had had the
charge of Jane during her infancy, but had been dismissed on Matilda's
expulsion^ Thither it was farther settled Andrew, the servant of Eldred, should
bring horses to accelerate their departure.

They then, with reluctance, bade adieu, and returned by different roads to the
castle.

At daybreak Jane proceeded to the appointed spot, reflecting on the mystery
of a circumstance, which her present visit to the cottage brought fresh to
recollection. It was briefly this: In her several ex^^^^tions thither, to which
she was ^^^^gated by humanity, she had constantly observed a female there, who
on her entering ever retired, yet was there something majestic in her form that
inspired reverence.

In vain had she questioned old Maud concerning her visitor; in vain had she
perplexed herself in conjectures of who it should be; and the predominant
desire of woman, dear curiosity, was left unsatisfied!

At the lowly portal she found Eldred; he conducted her in, where she was
welcomed by the good hostess, who had got the licenced trick of age. Prolixity
in conversation was her marking feature; nor was there a possibility of
bringing her to the end of a tale, till she had made her accustomed
observations.

"My beloved mistress," she cried, "in the name of the Holy Virgin, how come I
honored with your company at so early an hour? Has any mishap befallen you? I
fear there has, for right sure am I that my last night's dream bodes nothing
good; however I will not at present trouble you with that, but return to
something of more consequence. My good Lord, your cousin, informed me that I
might expect you; but useless were my enquiries to what I stood indebted for
your visit."

"My good mother," answered Eldred, "had you permitted, I should ere this have
solved your question."

"There now!" returned the aged owner of the house, "had I permitted! Have I
not already said I entreated you?"

"Maud," said Jane, "am I, from this to conclude you consider my visit as
unseasonable?"

"Unseasonable!" exclaimed the cottager with energy, "Alas, how little you know
my heart! and yet you should know it, none ever had a greater interest in it.
How often have you in early years reclined upon my bosom? Ah! those days for
happiness, I never shall see their parallel. Yet what am I? A creature that few
returning months shall see low laid in the grave. But you, in the meridian of
youth and beauty, Heaven will surely bless you,"

Jane tarried the conclusion of this eloquent harangue, well knowing it would
be fruitless to attempt an interruption, then thanking Maud for her good
wishes, made known her purpose, which she had hardly ended, ^hen Andrew arrived
with the (...).

The figure of this servant was too uncommon to let it pass without mention.

Nature, with whom he seemed no favorite, had given him a pair of small gray
eyes, but in her haste had forgotten the customary ornament of an eyebrow. His
nose was broad, and appeared as if some unlucky accident had spread it across
his cheeks. His mouth was wide, and decorated with two enormous rows of
variegated teeth, in which however black was the predominant color. His bushy
beard, a fiery red, grew on his ^allow chin, like furze upon a ^un parched
heath. His figure was not cast in Apollo's mould, being squat and muscular, and
having one leg a few inches shorter than its fellow, caused his gait to be
rather shambling than majestic.

The character of this servant was also somewhat singular; he was firmly
atttached to his master, and would with pleasure have sacrificed his own life
in his defense. He was, moreover, a great philosopher, and scarce ever answered
a question without the addition of some musty proverb. Yet were the springs of
his heart actuated by virtuous movements, and to his master he was firmly
attached.

He entered, and, warned them to be gone. "Consider," said he, "Dispatch is the
soul of business, and by tarrying here, you may chance to be eased of the
trouble of your journey. For no sooner will you be missed, than the pursuit
will begin; Sir James one way, and that brawny devil, Donald, like the Colossus
of Rhodes, stretching from the (...) of one hill to another. And I must own,
notwithstanding their rank, I should not like to be found in their company at
present. Let us be gone my Lord, Remember, quoth he, The early bird catches
the worm."

The earl thought there was ^ound argument in what his follower said, and
prepared to depart; on which Maud suddenly left the room, but returned in a few
minutes, craving permission to introduce a lady, who although a stranger,
professed herself much interested in behalf of the two fugitives.

They begged Maud to introduce the lady; who entered the room vieled, and Jane,
by her figure, discovered the person she had so frequently seen there, who took
her hand and pressed it with fervor to her lips, inviting heaven to shower its
choicest gifts upon her head, and to avert those calamities which had befallen
her mother. Then presenting the hand she held to Eldred, bade him in broken
sobs, consider the value of the jewel he was about to have in charge; murmured
a blessing on them and precipitately withdrew, leaving her spectators in
amazement!

Jane took leave of her nurse, and after Glencairn had forced a purse upon her,
they mounted their steeds and shaped their course southerly, resolving to
travel as far as Wales, amidst the lofty mountains of that country, to tend
their herds and live in peaceful retirement.

They rode conversing on the strange rencounter at the abode of Maud, which
much engrossed their thoughts; and the more so as Jane affirmed she had heard
the voice before, till the dark gathering of the clouds foretold the impending
storm, and they had just gained shelter in an adjacent grove, when the rain
poured down in torrents, loud whistled the wind amidst the lofty foilage, while
blue and forked lightning, gave a momentary gleam, and the big thunder, in
deep, awful strains, growled over their heads.

"Aye," cried Andrew, (throwing his played over his shoulders) "This reminds me
of an excellent proverb, Though the sun shine, leave not your cloak at home."

While they remained under shelter, they were surprised by the voices of men,
one of whom cried, "They cannot be far off, I have good intelligence this is
the road they took!"

"'It Is well," returned another, "if they are taken, our labor will be well
requitted."

"If!" answered a third voice, "I will pursue them to the end of the world. By
the beard of Holy St. Andrew, our Lord would sacrifice* us as accomplices,
should we return without them."

This conversation ^unk to the very soul of Jane.

"Alas!" she said, "these are our pursuers! What will become of us?

"Fear not, my love," exclaimed Eldred, "I will protect you, while life exists!"

"Then, my Lord," said Andrew, "the most certain way of doing that, will be to
run away; for take my word, you will not long have life, if you remain here."
"Silence," interrupted his master.

By this time a party of armed men appeared, and confirmed his suspicions;
which, however they a^ quickly dispelled, by enquiring whether a company of
horsemen had not passed. Being answered, no! they informed our travelers,
those horsemen had surprised the castle of a neighboring Baron, which they had
plundered, and that they were in pursuit of the robbers* wished Eldred and his
companions a pleasant journey and departed.

After tarrying some time, the sky began to clear; the water which till then
had fallen, strong as a cataract, now scarcely dropped at all, and heaven's
artillery rolled at a distance, till it gradually died away.

CHAP. IV.
A little lowly hermitage it was,
Down in a dale, hard by a forest side,
Far from resort of people that did pass
In travel to and fro: a little wide
There was an holy chapel edified,
Wherein the hermit duly went to say
His holy things each morn and even tide:
Thereby a crystal stream did gently play,
Which from a sacred fountain welled* forth away.
SPENCER.
THEY then continued their progress, and arrived in an extensive valley,
surrounded by a hanging wood. The rays of the God of Day, who was fast retiring
for the night, cast a delightful shade and added to the beauty of the scene.
Through the dale, over a pebbled bed, meandered a bubbling stream, flanked on
each side by mournful willows. Casting their eyes around in wonder, at the door
of a cell they descried a man vested in hermit's garb, who sat apparently in
melancholy reverie. Around the porch were interwoven jasmines and
honey-suckles, the fragrance of which was odoriferous.

The Anchorite, on observing our travelers approached and requested them, in a
style more suited to the polished air of a courtier than the usual address of a
recluse, to enter his dwelling; to which they consented, marvelling what could
have induced a man who seemed designed by Nature for the highest sphere, thus
to seclude himself, particularly as he was not of age to lose all relish for
the pleasures of society. The traces on his features seemed rather the effect
of cruel retrospection than of time; yet had it not destroyed that grace and
affability, which accompanied his every word and gesture. Nor was their wonder
diminished, when they espied a suit of armor suspended from the stoney roof.

"Enter," he cried, "my humble dwelling, and accept a hearty welcome, which
will be your only sauce to the poor fare that I can set before you." "A good
appetite is the best sauce;" said Andrew hurrying out to turn the horses loose,
that he might the sooner be enabled to convince them there was truth in his
assertion.

The hermit then produced some excellent fruit, and water from the rivulet that
flowed before his door; of which Eldred and his fair companion partook
sparingly. In the mean time, Andrew, having dispatched his business, quickly
proved, by the attack he made on the provisions, that abstinence was not in the
list of his philosophic virtues. "Aye," says he "this is as it should be, After
the outside has been so mauled, as that of my unhappy carcass has, it is fit the
inside should be well lined, to support the whole case.

To be sure your beverage is none of the strongest. I have been well buffetted
by this element any time for the last hour: but, thank Heaven, my philosophy
can reconcile any thing; and as you (...) wine, here is my service to you in
water."

Their repast ended, the Anchorite, who called himself Ambrose, was entrusted
with the history of the young fugitives, concealing only their names; on which
he made them the offer of his habitation as a refuge, until the search which
would necessarily be made after them should subside. This friendly proposal
they joyfully accepted; and the daughter of Wallace being provided with a straw
bed, the only one the place afforded, retired; while the Hermit, Glencairn, and
Andrew, drew around a good neat fire for the night.

The subsequent morning, after regaling themselves, Jane and her lover walked
into the surrounding wood, when she, faint for want of that rest which her
perturbed state of mind had denied her during the night, resolved to seek it
under the shadow of some kindly tree; she therefore desired Eldred to leave
her, (...) which he complied, and traversed the grove for some time. But how
can his horror be described, when on his return he saw not Jane. Half frantic,
he loudly called upon her name, but all in vain! At length he bethought
himself, that possibly she might have taken her way to the hermitage; and
hasting thither, met his trusty squire.

"Andrew," cried he, "have thou seen the Lady Jane? I quitted her for a short
time, and on coming to the spot again, my longing eyes to no purpose looked for
her.

"My Lord," replied his attendant, "there is an old adage, and a very true one,
that After joy comes sorrow."

"Have you seen her?" returned the impatient Eldred.

"No my Lord," said he, "but let ^s go in quest of (...); Seek till you find
and you will rarely lose your labor."

Regardless of these observations, Glencairn made for the cell of Ambrose, and
enquired of the holy man, whether his mistress had been there; on being
answered in the negative, with wild despair pictured in his frenzy-rolling eye,
again he darted amidst the impervious shade of the encircling forest, making it
re-echo with his cries; till exhausted nature yielded beneath her burden, and
he sunk supine upon the earth.

Ambrose, who, with Andrew, had been the whole day in search of Eldred, found
him at last in the situation before mentioned; his face wrapped in the played
robe he wore, and his brown locks wet with the evening dew.

Deaf to the entreaties of the Hermit, he remained immovable, till softened by
the persevering and reiterated supplications of Andrew and the good man, he
suffered them to conduct him unto the hermitage. On his arrival, the agitation
his spirits had sustained brought on a raging fever, so desperate, that for
several days his life was despaired of, during which time his host administered
such drugs as the produce of the earth enabled him to prepare. But conscious
that his patient's mind stood most in need of medicine, he took the earliest
opportunity that returning reason offered, on the part of Eldred, to inculcate
the principles of religion, and sooth his tortured soul.

"My son," said he, "reflect that the ways of providence are blind and
intricate! shall poor weak man attempt to reason, and say to Power Almighty,
thou have done amiss? Bow with submission to the will of Heaven, and pour that
precious cordial patience on your heart.

"True," cried Andrew, "Patience is a plaster for all sores."

"Ah, father!" exclaimed Glencairn, "to the insensate feelings of an anchorite,
my grief, I know, appears extravagant. But how can one, secluded from the world
judge of those sensations by which the susceptible passions of frailer mortals
are actuated? Had you, indeed, ever known what it is to love, and have the idol
of your soul thus torn away, you might with justice reason on my case."

"True again," said the philosophic squire, "None know the weight of another's
burden."

At the latter part of Eldred's speech, the scalding drop rolled down the
Hermit's cheek: after a time he thus replied.

"Alas, my son! you know not what you have innocently done; probed a wound,
which though long since received, is not, nor ever will be healed."

"It is ill healing an old sore!" ejaculated Andrew.

"Had I ever loved!" continued Ambrose; "O! did you know my long sad
sufferings, your own, heavy as you think them, placed in the scale against
mine, would strike the beam; and notwithstanding the repetition of them will
rouse a train of gloomy reflections, that for a moment scarce had slumbered,
yet will I recount them, that, by the comparison you may learn to bear with
resignation the ills allotted to you."

"You had better not," cried the squire of Glencairn, "When sorrow is asleep,
awake it not."

Unmindful of Andrew's remarks the recluse commenced his narrative.

CHAP. V.
He had been a soldier in his youth,
And sought in famous battles.
HOME.
"I am the sole surviving branch of a noble house, richer in honor than in
wealth. My father knowing the scanty fortunes he possessed, were insufficient
to support the dignities of his family, resolved that his only son, myself,
should never, if possible to prevent it, feel the want of riches.

"You are, I know," he would say, "above all mercenary thoughts, and far be it
ever from me to endeavor at instilling them into your bosom. But I, from long
experience, can affirm how feeble the struggles of mental worth, unless backed
by that persuasive advocate, gold. Trace the world through; behold the veriest
wretch that treads the surface of the earth, and if bedecked in splendour, you
shall see him take the senior hand of threadbare honesty; which, like the sun
obscured behind a watery cloud at intervals darts forth a pallid ray, to show
the world the beauties that he owns, and which the hand of Envy strives to hide.

"Do not, from this," continued he, "infer you should despise wealth. No
consider it as the best gift of Heaven, provided you have the blessing to
understand the proper use of it, which surely is, that those who most abound,
may have the satisfaction of relieving others, that are undeservedly
necessitous."

"By the mass," interrupted Andrew, "a sensible shrewd remark, and I have a
proverb will confirm the truth of it; Riches are like manure, offensive in a
heap, but spread abroad make the earth fruitful."

"Your observation bears the stamp of reason," replied Ambrose; "but to resume
my tale; for the reason before mentioned, I was bade prepare to fail for
France, where at that time Mars shone in all his splendour. With rapture I
should have obeyed the order, had not a magnet even more attractive than the
love of fame, influenced my stay.

"Near to the castle of my father lived a rich and haughty chief, whose
daughter had charms potent enough to captivate the icy breast of cold
insensibility. No wonder then that I, at an age when the susceptible heart is
prone as wax to take impressions, should be subdued; nor was the lovely
conqueror, as I thought, insensible to what I suffered; nay she has confessed
she loved me, but vowed never to become my bride without the assent of her
parent.

"This I almost despaired to obtain, well knowing his predominant foible was
ambition, to which he would have sacrificed every thing most dear to him.
However to sanguine love nothing appears unattainable, and with the concurrence
of my father, I demanded the hand of the Baron's daughter.

"And who art thou" he cried "who pretendest to it? What feats of heroic
prowess have thou accomplished, or is thy name distinguished amongst the
chieftains of the north? Thy shield is not inscribed with any bold and valorous
achievement, nor are thy deeds rehearsed by the breath of applauding
minstrels. Gain thee a name in arms, and then aspire to my envied alliance.
Moreover I command my daughter to forbear thy presence; thou shall have no
further opportunity to wean her from her duty.

"On this I left the castle, nettled at his ill opinion of myself, and want of
confidence in a child, whose every action implied obedience.

"The time for my departure now drew nigh; and disappointed in my fondest wish,
I counted every hour, impatient for that which was to bear me from my native
country, hoping in battle some friendly sword would deprive me of an existence
now become hateful.

"All attempts to see my mistress proved ineffectual; and the only consolation
I experienced was that of receiving a letter from her.

"Farewell," said she in it, "Heaven knows no youth but you ever had an
interest in my heart. May the angel who regards true and virtuous love, bear a
shield before thee in the field of slaughter, endue thy sword with power
resistless, and bring thee back to my fond arms, encrowned with laurels! speedy
be thy return; and oh, remember me! Gay and courtly dames, skilled in the
artful language of seducement, may strive to allure thee, but their love cannot
equal mine."

In her letter she enclosed me a ring, as token of her unshaken constancy.

"I instantly answered her billet, in which I strove to picture the agonies I
endured; conjuring her by ^he tenderness she acknowledged for me, not to marry
until she heard I was no more; as I was resolved to return with affluence, or
never to return. That should fortune deign to be propitious, I would claim her
hand as the recompense of my toils, and that I was certain her father would not
in that case refuse it; as she well knew to my birth he could make no
exception; want of riches was my sole detriment, and should that cause be
removed, no obstacle would remain.

"Having dispatched a trusty messenger with it, and a bracelet in return for
the pledge she had sent me, with a heavy heart I sat out for Edinburgh; from
thence I embarked for France, and on my landing instantly joined the army of
the gallic king, by whom I was courteously received.

"Various were the different skirmishes, and tedious to relate; It is enough to
say, that for a length of time the genius of the British arms prevailed, till
by the assistance of a maid, named Joan la Pucelle, the scale was turned in our
favor. She put us into possession of Orleans, routed our foes, and restored in
a great degree the glory of France, which the repeated conquests of the Black
Prince, Edward, and his illustrious descendant, Henry the fifth, had
diminished. Her name was honored throughout the kingdom, and the halls of the
gallic barons rung with the fame of this heroic virgin.

"Fortune still continued to befriend us, till fate deprived us of our guardian
angel, Joan impelled by a furious ardor, rushed on the foe, and being separated
from her party, fell into the hands of the Duke of York; who far from revering
her courageous conduct. sentenced her to the stake.

The rumor of her caption spread like wild fire, through our host, and acted
on it as a spell: The soldiers panic struck, fled from the field of battle, and
were pursued with slaughter. I myself escaped with difficulty, and rode till
night, which was so dark, that not a star was to be discovered in the
firmament. My situation was distressing, and both myself and horse had occasion
for refreshment, which I could not perceive the possibility of obtaining, when
I perceived a light at no great distance, and instantly spurred toward it, but
to my mortification lost sight of my beacon; at length again it glimmered, and
on coming near, I found it to issue from a hut surrounded by a clump of lofty
trees.

"I knocked at the door, which was opened by a man stricken in years, whose
contenance was the most disgusting I ever beheld. His person was far above the
common size, and his shoulders so robust, they reminded me of the sinewy Atlas;
his profile was concave, with a nose of so enormous a length, it joined in
contact with a chin that ended in a curved point. His small gray eyes were
nearly obscured by a pair of penthouse brows, that resembled the shaggy
covering of the bear; nor was his voice unlike the roaring of that ill-favored
animal.

"Having recovered from the surprise into which his uncouth appearance had
throw^ me, I informed him, through the darkness of the night I had mistaken my
road, that the same cause rendered it almost impossible for me to recover it
again, and I should be indebted to his hospitality, if he would give me lodging
till break of day. This artifice I conceived myself authorized to practice, as
that part of the country was entirely devoted to the English.

"Endeavoring to smooth his hedious features to a smile of complacency,
"Enter," said he, "and such entertainment as my hovel affords is yours."

"I thanked him, and after leading my steed under an adjacent pent house,
followed the old man into the house.

"On seating myself to supper he entreated me to lay aside my sword, this I
declined, at which he seemed chagrined; however I kept my falchion by my side,
and after having allayed my appetite, begged he would show me to my bed. Taking
a lamp, he conducted me up a ladder to a room, or rather loft, where setting
down the light he left me.

"I threw myself on the pallet in my armor, and wiled away the time in a
retrospection of my past life; when casting an eye in one corner of the room I
perceived the floor much discolored. Curiosity prompted me to a nearer
investigation, and on looking close I found it stained with blood.

"But I perceive the hand of Somnus lies heavy on your brow, refresh yourself
with sleep, and in the morning I will continue my narrative.

They then retired for the night, and on the morrow Father Ambrose pursued his
story.

To speak his horror.
KEATE.
"AN involuntary horror seized me and made my seated heart knock at my ribs, as
though it would have burst its prison. It instantly occurred to me, the house
had been the seat of murder, and that probably I was destined to the same
wretched end."

"I had scarce made my comment on the scene before me, ere my attention was
again roused by the clatter of approaching horses, and I soon heard their
riders tap gently at the portal, which being opened, they asked if any company
was within."

"Aye, replied the hoary villain, "there is a young man above, who, if one may
judge from apperance, will yield something handsome. He has not yet had time to
compose himself to that rest, which he little dreams will be his last."

"Silence Dubois," replied another voice, "we shall depend on you for the
execution of this business, as an affair of moment calls us hence."

"And you may depend on me," said the old man, "it is not the first time. This
good dagger has never yet failed me, and I Will answer it does not now. However,
before you depart, drink one cup of wine to the success of my undertaking; here
is part of a flask that I opened for the credulous fool, who shall pay dearly
for it."

"Having drank, the horsemen mounted and galloped off, leaving me in a state of
mind more easily conceived than described. I had not much time allowed me for
reflection, as I heard my host ascending the ladder. I instantly extinguished
my lamp, and placing myself behind the door, by the pale light that invaded my
chamber window, I saw him enter the room and advance to the bed, whereon he
supposed his intended victim lay. I unsheathed my sword, and straitway plunged
it in his heart.

"Traitor!" I exclaimed, "take from my hand the just reward of thy crimes --
crimes which exceed all bounds. To lure the unwary traveller to his death,
under the plausible mask of hospitality, is sure a species of unparallelled
villainy. But why do I waste my breath upon a wretch whose iron heart
repentance cannot reach? However, if thou have in thy composition one particle
of reverence for the divine Author of thy being, now, while thou have life,
entreat forgiveness.

"I then hurried from the room, and having caparisoned my charger, left the
accursed mansion with all the speed he was master of. It was still so dark I
was compelled to ride at random, without knowing what route I took, and at the
hazard of falling into the enemy's hands. At last, the welcome sound of a
distant bell saluted my ear, and, looking toward the side from whence it
issued, I descried by the rays of the sun, that now began to shoot above the
dusky horizon, the spires of a monastery: cheered by the sight, my exhausted
strength was renovated. Arriving at the gate, I demanded admittance, which was
granted, and I ushered into an apartment, where I found the superior. He
desired me to make known, who, and what I was; the truth I did not think it
politic to entrust him with, therefore, contented myself with saying, I was
about to join the army of the Duke of York."

"Your conduct, interrupted Andrew, "was a proof of your good sense, and
reminds me of an excellent adage. Take heed of an ox before, an ass behind, and
a monk on all sides!"

"Having answered his enquiry," said the hermit, "I was accommodated with a
miserable couch, where, for a few hours, I enjoyed an uninterrupted slumber. On
arising, I was told Father Francis was employed about the person of a wounded
man; nevertheless, I might enter his chamber. I did so, and the first object
that my eyes encountered was Dubois; the wretch whom I had left weltering in
his blood. On my appearance, he utterred a groan, and fell back speechless.
After a pause, he showed signs of returning life, and at length being able to
support himself upon his arm exclaimed, "There stands my murderer!"

"I was instantly surrounded, and, spite of all opposition, disarmed; then
hurried to a melancholy dungeon, where they loaded me with chains. Thus
manacled, these fathers of religion quitted me, guilty of no crime but spilling
the blood of an assassin in my own defense.

Long, very long, did my confinement last. One morning, a member of this
infernal society entered my cell, telling me I must prepare to die, as Dubois
had just breathed his last: regardless of life, I followed him, happy in so
near a prospect of being released from it."

"We came into a large hall, where the inhabitants of the monastery were
already assembled, and which contained their various implements of torture. The
superior addressed me, and after artfully expatiating on the pretended enormity
of my guilt, informed me the Holy-Brotherhood judged it fit I should make
atonement on the rack."

"Thus did they strive to make the murder which they were about to perpetrate
appear an act of justice."

"Empty vessels make the greatest sound," said Andrew, "The scripture says, A
fool's voice is known by multitude of words! Sure it is, none more apt to boast
than those who have least real worth!"

"Silence, cried Eldred, though at the same time he could not forbear admiring
the pertinence of the remark; then apologized for his servant's interruption,
on which Ambrose went on.

"Monster!" I exclaimed to Father Francis, "profane not the sacred name of
religion, by bestowing the appellation of holy on this fraternity of banditti,
and tremble at the power of an incensed Deity. Though for some wi^e and unseen
purpose he may awhile permit your cruelty to flourish, yet be assured a day
will come, when his all righteous judgment shall fall heavy on you!"

"That day is distant, returned he, lead him to instant execution."

"This they proceeded to do, fast binding me to the wheel; I had just finished
a short fervent prayer, when the monks were startled by the sound of loud and
repeated blows at the outer gate of the monastery; on which they armed
themselves, and sa^lied forth to seek the cause of this unexpected clamor!"

CHAP. VII.

SHAKESPEARE.
"PSESENTLY I heard the clash of swords, and the groans of the wounded grated
on my ear; at length the shouts of victory echoed throughout the building, and
the hall was filled with armed Frenchmen, who released me!"

"Next to heaven, my thanks were due to these my preservers, which I gave them
with all the cordiality my full heart inspired; then entreated to know what had
brought them so providentially to my relief."

"They told me an unhappy creature who had miraculously escaped from the
monastery, after a long confinement, by accident passed the French encampment,
and desired permission to see the general, to whom he was admitted. He informed
him he had just effected his emancipation from that place, and enumerated the
several barbarities inflicted by those sanctified impostors. Upon which a
detachment was ordered to attend the stranger, and to carry the place by storm;
this they had just accomplished, and came in time to save me from an
ignominious death."

"From this I learned, what I before suspected, that my persecutors
countenanced the depredations of Dubois and his associates, and that probably
the spoils of those travelers, who, had fallen by his hand, were conveyed to
this holy place."

"We explored the different recesses of the monastary, and delivered a long
train of victims, who, for years had groaned beneath the yoke of monkish
tyranny. Amongst the number, were a father and his son, that particularly
interested me. As we entered their dungeon, we saw, by the light of our
torches, the old man stretched on the damp pavement, and fast locked in sleep,
his head was supported on the knee of the youth, who watched his slumbers,
while the tears of filial affection dropped from his eye, and moistened the
beard of his venerable burden!"

"On observing us, and in habits so unlike what he had been accustomed to while
in confinement, a spark of hope illumined the young man's features, and burst
into a flame, on our telling him they were no longer prisoners. With tender
care he awoke his parent, and imparted to him the change in their favor. Never
in my life did I witness a scene of more ^ervent devotion than now took place;
the old man fell upon his knees, in which he was followed by his son, both in
silent orisons, expressing their obligation to the divinity, while the sluices
of their eyes, which had before been wholly actuated by grief, now flowed in
streams of gratitude!"

"We then departed with those Friars who had escaped the swords of the
soldiery. On our arrival at the camp, I made myself known to the commander, to
whom I repeated my adventures, and was received by him in a manner suitable to
my birth; but, spite of my endeavors to save the lives of my enemies, on the
following morning they were all executed; a dreadful example, that a day of
retribution, however tardy, is certain to arrive!"

"I remained in the army some three years, without the comfort of the least
intelligence from Scotland. At the battle o^ --, it was my fortune to encounter
a man, whose arms and deportment bespoke him above the common stamp. Our strife
was long and hardy, until my tempered steel cleaving his crest in twain, put an
end to the combat, and to the life of my brave adversary."

"Thy genius has prevailed," he faintly articulated, "and well do thou
deserve to conquer; accept this trifle as a testimony of the esteem, which even
a vanquished enemy professes for you." So saying, he presented me with a
casket. "Do justice to my memory," cried he, "and let it not be your least
boast, that by your arm, fell Lord --."

"At that word, death cut short his utterance, and a retreat being sounded on
our part, I unwillingly quitted the body, ignorant of the name of my generous
antagonist."

"I embraced the first opportunity to examine my gift. How did I gul^ my sight
on the precious store presented to it? Not for the love of wealth, but that I
flattered myself, it would put me in possession of her I adored.

"About the same time a truce being concluded between the contending kingdoms,
I embarked for Scotland. During our passage, we one morning observed ^a large
vessel bearing down upon us with all the sail she could crowd, and on her
nearer appearance, found her by the colors to be an Algerine."

"Our situation was perilous, as the size of their bark exceeded ours too much,
for us to entertain a thought of conquering them; and so pusillanimous was our
captain, that he talked of quietly surrendering. This I strenuously opposed,
preferring death to a state of abject bondage. I therefore summoned the crew,
and made them acquainted with my determination, not to yield tamely, conjuring
them, if the slightest ember of courage glowed within them, to follow my
example, and strive to repel the infidels."

"This they vowed to do; and the enemy being come up, grappled with and
attempted to board us: long we sought with an ardor the love of liberty alone
could inspire, till the slaughter which reigned amidst our little band,
rendered all farther opposition fruitless, and our colors were struck.
Petrified at the idea of becoming a slave, at a time I flattered myself secure
of lasting felicity, my reason forsook me, and I singly sought to repel the
foe, but all in vain, a blow from a battle-axe laid me insensate on the deck,
and I became their prisoner.

"On recovering, I must own, the patience and philosophy with which my vocation
now urges me to arm the wretched, was then ill observed by myself. I dashed my
head against the vessel's side; and should have buried my sorrows in a watery
grave, had I not been prevented. Alas! I was destined to experience still
severer (...)*

"The victors stood for their own coast, on gaining which, (...) companions
were all disposed of, Muley Abdallah, the commander, reserving only myself. He
took me with him to a small, but elegant, castle, that stood without the city
gates; where I was destined to the humble employment of a gardener. However, as
I seemed to be the sport of fortune, I hoped the same caprice that had cast me
into slavery, would, ere it was long, release me. Full of these sanguine
thoughts, I became more calm, and comforted myself with the resolution of not
letting slip an opportunity, should any offer, of making my escape.

"I attended my plants, and making a virtue of necessity, tried, by my
assiduity, to gain my master's favor and confidence, that so his vigilance
might relax, and afford me the earlier season of regaining my liberty.

"Sitting one evening, after having completed my daily task, upon a bench
beneath the castle, a billet fell at my feet, I took it up, and withdrew to a
secret part of the garden, where I opened the letter and read these lines:

CHRISTIAN,
You will doubtless be surprised at finding yourself addressed in a place where
you are an entire stranger; but let the Deity who delights in goodly actions
enable you to support your lot with fortitude. Know you have a friend, to whom
Alla has given the power and inclination to befriend you. To your honor I
confide a secret which, if divulged, plunges myself and you in misery. It is in
vain I have endeavored to combat a passion that can never be removed until the
angel of death closes my eyes, and wafts me to the blessed mansion of our holy
Prophet. My father Muley Abdallah, will shortly leave the castle, then will I
effect your liberation and return, to your own country. Think not too lightly
of me for this my candid confession, but rest assured you shall receive your
deliverance from the hand of

Selima.


"This letter was a cordial to my mind. I perused it over and over again,
fearful I was but in a dream; yet when the first sallies of my unbounded joy
abated, and reason resumed her empire, I found my happiness much lessened by
the declaration of love made me by the daughter of Muley Abdallah; my affection
for another, my honor, my religion forbade my making a suitable return."

CHAP. VIII.
Hope of all passions, most befriends us here;

YOUNG.
"A WEEK of alternate hope and anxiety elapsed, when a female slave accosted
me, desiring I would meet her at sunset in the south alcove. So saying, she
suddenly disappeared.

"At the decline of day I repaired to my rendezvous, and was shortly after
joined by the faithful confidant, who bad me follow her. We entered the castle,
and ascended a slight of stairs which led to the apartments of Selima, whom I
found in one of them on a rich (...). On seeing me she rose, and ^^^ing up her
veil, presented the greatest assemblage of charms I ever witnessed; at the ^ame
time requesting I would partake of her ^eat.

"I fear," she said, her face suffused by the blush of modesty, "I fear, to one
accustomed to the strict etiquette of European women, my conduct must appear
inconsistent with the delicacy of my sex; but there was no time to be lost in
ceremonious punctilio. My father is at present abroad, how soon he may return
is uncertain. I have provided for your escape, which must be this night. A
renegado captain, who is under some obligation to me, has undertaken to convey
you to your native land. Even now he tarries for you, lose not a moment, some
mischievous stroke of fortune may prevent you else."

"A sensible lady!" quoth Andrew. "Aye, Many things fall out between the cup
and the lip."

"I endeavored to express my thanks," said the Hermit, "and hoped she would not
accuse me of ingratitude when I owned my sole reason or wishing to return
homeward, was the ^ond hope of again beholding the woman, to whom, before my
departure my vows were pledged.

"I mentioned this abruptly, fearful she should have formed any thought of
accompanying me; but much I wronged her. She replied, with a smile, in which
she attempted to smother her agitation: "Your candor charms me: Farewell! This
eunuch will conduct you to a vessel. May you be happy in the arms of her you
love; and sometimes, in the midst of your felicity, bestow a thought on Selima,
whose constant prayers shall be for your prosperity."

"I pressed her hand to my lips, and departed, strongly impressed with
admiration of her generous conduct. I followed my guide to the beach, and
finding the galley in perfect readiness, I rewarded the slave and embarked.

"Never did I experience a night of more real satisfaction. I sat on the deck,
ruminating on my past misfortunes, and anticipating my future happiness, while
the swelling bosom of the sail was filled by the breath of zephyr, and our prow
cut through the green bosom of the glassy ocean."

"After a pleasant voyage, I landed at Leith; and recompensing the service of
the captain, proceeded to the mansion of my forefathers. By what various
emotions was I actuated as I journeyed thither! I was received at the gate by
the steward, a venerable man, who had spent his youth in our family.

"He started at the sight of me, as though he had seen an apparition. "Do
thou not know me, Charles?" said I.

"My young Lord!" he exclaimed. "Is it possible? Is it you?

"How is my beloved father? I returned.

"Alas!" cried he, "I have a melancholy story to relate; but enter the castle,
and you shall know every circumstance that has occurred since your quitting it."

"You had not been gone twelve months, before a Scots Chief, on a dark night,
claimed shelter here from the inclemency of the elements, which I need not tell
you was granted; for never did traveller pass these walls without refreshment.
In the course of conversation, he said he was just returned from the French
wars. Your father eagerly embraced the opportunity to enquire after his son;
but lightning could not have struck him harder (...) the answer of his guest,
who told him you had perished in battle.

"Never from that time did my Lord receive the smallest comfort, and the burden
of grief laid so heavy on his frame, that the strings of his heart cracked, and
he sunk into the grave.

"Your mistress, who appeared inconsolable at the tidings of your death, some
time after g^ve her hand to another; but a few ye^^s only had she been married,
when (...) rumor that she was no more reached my ear.

"By the decease of your father, and the report of your own demise, the estates
became the king's, to whom I have punctually remitted the rents; but who will
no doubt, with pleasure restore them.

"This is the melancholy greeting I am compelled to give you; and I pray
heaven, who has guarded you through the slaughter of the war, may endue you
with resignation!"

"Horror-struck at these dreadful tidings, disappointed at the death of my
parent, and at the inconstancy and subsequent decease of my mistress, I yielded
myself a prey to black despair, and determined to devote the remnant of my days
in the service of our blessed Redeemer, by enrolling myself under the banner of
the knights of Malta, and combating the enemies of my religion.

"I therefore withdrew privately from the castle, as I well knew if Charles
became acquainted with my design, he would oppose it with every argument he was
master of. I traveled the whole day, taking no nutriment, save what the earth
afforded, and slacking my thirst at some running brook, till the sable mantle
of night was spread over the surface of the earth, and the thick falling dew
warned me to seek some place where I might lay my wretched head; in vain were
my searches, and exhausted nature forced me to repose my wearied body on the
wet grass.

"The beams of the ruddy god no sooner diffused their genial heat, than I
arose, and pursuing my way, arrived in this valley. The sequestered situation,
the willows bending over the purling stream, presented a striking portrait of
my own state, and induced me to exchange my armor for the garb and ^^wl of an
hermit.

"Here have I since remained, and the chearing warmth of twelve genial springs
have chaced the wintry snow from off the neighboring mountains, since my
arrival. Now, from my repeated miseries, draw a lesson that may teach you to
bear your own with patience, and, by comparison, to consider them as light."

How charming is divine philosophy!

MILTON.
ELDRED thanked the Anchorite, and would sain have profited by his advice; but
the loss of his beloved mistress had fixed a barbed arrow in his heart, the
gangrene wound of which the hand of philosophy could not heal.

He remained with Father Ambrose until his bodily health was restored, when
again the remembrance of Jane drove him almost to desperation.

"Good heaven!" he cried, "my sufferings are more than I can endure."

"Remember, my Lord," said Andrew, " Crosses are ladders that do lead to
Heaven."

"Come," exclaimed Glencairn, his eyes burning with fury, "in the very mansion
of Donald will I seek the ravisher, for sure it must be him, and -- "

" Valor can do little without discretion," returned Andrew, " an ounce of the
latter, is worth a pound of wit."

"Why, what would thou have me do?"

" In vain he craves advice that will not take it."

"No more, I charge thee; if thou can afford me no consolation, for thy life
attempt not to trifle with my feelings."

" Fall not out with thy friend for a trifle."

"Well, well, my honest fellow, I have been hasty, I pray you pardon me."

"I do," said Andrew; " Happy is he who knows his follies in his youth."

The impetuous sallies of passion on the part of Eldred, were restrained by the
persuasive arguments of his attendant; and it was settled they should abandon
the hermitage on the following day. They made their intention known to Father
Ambrose, who entreated his noble guest, but in vain, to prolong his stay.

On the ensuing morn, the Recluse drew from his breast a casket.

"This," said he, "is the legacy of an expiring foe. I treasured it, hoping it
would have proved the means of uniting me to her I adored. Those thoughts are
crushed forever! Accept this as a memorial of one, who though but a short time
honored with your acquaintance, has for you a sincere respect."

So saying, he took out a ring, which he presented to Glencairn, who thanked
him for his present; but on looking at it, the blood forsook his cheek, and his
whole frame was convulsed at perceiving it bore the crest of his family. The
mystery in which his father's fate was wrapped, the time the jewels were given,
served to confirm his suspicions, that 'twas he had fallen beneath the arm of
Ambro^e; yet could he not account for his parent having served in the English
army. Again he thought, he might have been influenced by some grievance, to
oppose the interests of France, and for that reason had privately absconded
from Scotland. To censure his host would be an act of injustice, as to the
fortune of war he stood indebted for his loss.

These were the feelings that tore his mind; he instantly ordered his charger,
and taking an abrupt leave of the Anchorite, whom he could not see but with
horror, vaulted into his saddle, and hastened from the valley.

He rode toward the mansion of Wallace, and dismounted at twilight at the
cottage of Maud, whom he questioned concerning Jane.

"On the first news of your flight," answered she, "Sir James and Donald,
attended by their retainers, followed you; but to my great surprise, on the
subsequent evening, the former returned without his guest, denouncing the curse
of an irritated parent on his daughter, and vowing he would no farther pursue
her, but leave her to reap the just reward of her disobedience. This startled
me, and I am now convinced she is in their hands, but where they have secreted
her, heaven knows."

This intelligence increased Eldred's anxiety.

"Let us be gone, Andrew," he cried, "to the dwelling of this accursed rival:
dearly shall he make atonement for his villainy?

In vain were Maud's endeavors to dissuade him from his purpose; in vain she
painted the dangers he must necessarily encounter, and the improbability of
deriving any success from his rash project.

"You forget," said he, "the name I bear, never did base fear, or the thought
of danger invade the mind of my illustrious race, nor will I be the first to
^ully such a line of ancestors. Loud is their praise in mouths of wisest men,
and often are their deeds recorded to the sound of the lyre. As to the
improbability of my success, the omnipotent Being will determine, as may seem
best to him, and should I perish in the attempt, posterity will peruse my fate
with regret."

So saying, in opposition to the strenuous entreaties of Maud, he mounted his
steed, and attended by Andrew, shaped his course northward.

On the second evening, he descried the stupendous battlements of Donald's
mansion, rearing their rugged heads above the horrizon, in awful majesty.

Advancing toward it he met a youth, whose military accoutrements bespoke him
one of Donald's retinue; and on examining his countenance, the air of
ingeniousness with which it was strongly imprinted, prompted Eldred to make his
confidante, and to endeavor by gold, that all-persuasive argument, to win him
to his interest.

He accosted him with some trivial question, asking whose was the adjacent
mansion; after which, he informed the stranger it was in his power to serve him
essentially.

"My gratitude," said he, "shall not be confined to the stale trick of words; I
mean to give a more substantial proof of it. Take this purse, and rest assured,
that contains but a moiety of the acknowledgment I will make, provided you
befriend me."

"Your look," replied the soldier, "bespeaks you noble. I think, from your
appearance, you would yourself scorn a bribe. Why then should you suppose me
guilty of accepting one? Is it because I wear this humble dress? If so, learn
from me, that the dress of a hind often covers a heart, which would not degrade
the gaudy mar^le of a monarch. If I can assist you, I shall with pleasure do
it. But rest assured, if my inclination does not prompt me, it never shall be
said, Edric was b^assed by the love of lucre!"

These words charmed Glencairn, who was persuaded that at least, in this
instance, the face was an index of the mind. He instantly imparted his business
to the stranger, who confessed Jane was within the castle; at the same time, he
acknowledged the injustice of Donald, and vowed to forward the schemes of
Eldred as much as in him lay.

Our hero expressed his sense of the obligation, and demanded by what method he
could best gain admission to the habitation of Donald. Edric told him he had
another military suit with which he would accommodate him, and by that
artifice, enable him to pass the sentinel as one of the garrison.

Glencairn applauded the mental abilities of the soldier, who went in quest of
his armor, with which returning in a short time, the former equipped himself
the^e^^; then, having the watchword, he departed on his enterprise, leaving
his squire with Edric, who undertook to lodge him with a friend, where he might
tarry for his Lord.

CHAP. X.
It Is true, unruffled and serene, I Have met
The common accidents of life, but here
Such an unlooked ^or storm of ills fall on me,
It beats down all my strength.
ADDISON.
ELDRED crossed the drawbridge without the least suspicion, and had scarce
entered the courtyard, when his ear was saluted by the jocund sound of
festivity. He entered the building and making his way to that part whence the
noise proceeded, he came to a hall which was decorated by the arms and banners
of its various possessors. Here he sound a goodly company sacrificing largely
to Bacchus: swiftly was the mantling goblet passed around, while the warlike
deeds of the Scottish Chieftains rung through the stately edifice!

Eldred, darting a look around, saw at the farther end his rival, and Jane
seated by him, over whose spirits, neither the juice of the grape, nor the
voice of the bard, had the least influence. Pale melancholy was pictured in
her features; her face was averted from the hated society wherein she was
compelled to mix, while the briny moisture from her eye fell in the sparkling
cup, and diluted the potent beverage.

The sight of his mistress fired the soul of Glencairn; hardly could he refrain
from sacrificing the ravisher in the midst of his adherents; but policy
prevented him, and he determined to counteract the villainy of Donald by
stratagem.

Long did he continue at the castle, without the happiness of communicating a
word to the loved object who had brought him thither; when, as he stood
reclining against his beachen spear in painful rumination, the highland chief
passed near him, and fixed his eyes steadfastly on him; then suddenly
withdrawing them, left the courtyard. Our hero was in amazement, he naturally
conjectured he (...) known; still he determined not to abandon the place
without making Jane his companion.

His suspicions however were soon evaporated, by the Baron taking no farther
notice of him, and fortune soon after favored his wishes. As his mistress was
enjoying the cool evening breeze upon the terrace, he found means to convey a
letter, unperceived, into her hand, imparting the danger he encountered for her
sake, and with every tender argument, soliciting an interview that night, near
the western tower, as his friend Edric would have charge of the drawbridge,
who would enable him to snatch her from the captivity in which she languished.

Eldred waited with anxiety, the inseparable companion of love, till he thought
the inhabitants of the castle buried in sleep, then flew upon the wings of
impatience to the appointed spot. Long did he tarry, but no Jane appeared.
Furious at his disappointment, he was about to retire, when the distant view of
a female, again rekindled his hopes, and in a minute he held the daughter of
Wallace in his arms, fain would he have chid, but joy restrained his tongue
from any language, save what love inspired. With rapture he strained her to his
breast, apprehensive he should be once more deprived of her.

Thus does the shipwrecked mariner -- when wan despair forbids the thought of
ever regaining land, by chance some friendly billow wafts him toward a rock,
where close he clings, and fears the impetuous surge will tear him from his
only hope!

With eagerness did Glencairn hurry cross the draw bridge, where he was joined
by his squire, who had received from Edric intimation of his master's design.

"These excursions," said Andrew, "may be vastly entertaining to you, my Lord
and Lady, who are lovers, who can banquet on each other's words, and warm
yourselves with the breath of mutual protestations. But, for my part, I would
rather have been employed in feasting on a well fed Capon, and a flaggon of
wine. Here have I tarried, until I am perfectly a walking piece of ice; my body
is now in as cold a state as the summit of Arthur's seat on a winter's night.
Our horses too are stolen, and by the beard of St. Andrew which way they went I
know not: however it is for your service I suffer this inconvenience, and that
thought softens my sufferings."

Already they were at a distance from the hostile place, and safe they thought
from the persecution of their enemies. The transition from a situation so
deplorable, to one directly opposite, produced such a revolution in their
tender minds, as lovers can only imagine.

They were fondly entertaining each other with mutual protestations, when the
harsh din of footsteps fast advancing, caused them to mend their pace. Taking
Jane's trembling hand, Eldred hurried on, but their pursuers gained upon them,
and he distinguished the voice of Donald.

"Stop, villain!" he cried, "yield up your prize, or this moment you breathe
your last."

They were now so close, that all escape was hopeless. Eldred, therefore, like
to the forest lion when at bay, placed himself before his fair companion, and
drawing his sword prepared to meet his foes. Andrew followed his example
exclaiming, " It Is a hard battle where none escape."

The Lord of the Isles, whose impatience quickened his steps, first came up and
attacked his rival, they ^ought with valor, and Glencairn was on the point of
gaining the victory, when he received a wound in the back, that brought him
drowned in gore upon the earth, at which Jane uttered a piercing cry, and sunk
lifeless on his body, while the follower of our unfortunate hero being
disarmed, was fast bound and gagged, and with the lady, whom they forced from
her lover, conveyed to the Castle.

Eldred recovering from the swoon wherein loss (...) blood had cast him, ^ound
himself deprived of adored Jane, and manacled in chains; at which rage and
indignation renewed his strength.

"Cowardly assassin, he cried, "thou disgrace to knighthood, who can not rely
on the strength of thine own arm, but causest these, thy myrmidonian crew,
basely to lend thee aid! Free me from this hated bondage, restore my arms,
renew the combat, and let the victor be rewarded with the charms of Jane.

"Fool!" retorted Donald, "think thou I will play for that, which is my own
already? No! the female whom thou mentionest is within my power, even now she
enters my mansion, never to retrace her steps, till by the holy force of
matrimony she is linked to me. For thee, rash stripling, in a deep dungeon
shall thou expiate thy audacity. Could thy presumption prompt thee to imagine
that thy shallow brain could defeat the schemes of Donald? I knew thee from the
first; thou can not but remember, when in the court yard, surprise (...) my
sight upon thee; but the wiser dictates of cool policy recalled me to myself,
and I resolved to try what plans thy daring soul would form, contenting myself
with keeping a guard upon thee who watched thy every motion. The letter thou
gave to the lady she dropped, 'twas found and delivered to me. Thy friend the
tra^tor Edri^* was seized and be assured shall receive the just reward of his
treason. Another was placed at the draw bridge in his stead, with orders to let
thee pass, while with my troops I did begird the castle. Some kindly angel led
thee to the spot where I myself tarried, and has given me the supreme delight
of witnessing thy misery. Think not to escape, for by the blessed cross of our
country's champion thy punishment shall equal thy arrogance."

"And do thou make thy boast," exclaimed Eldred, "of this thy villainy?
Cowardice, the constant attendant upon guilt, burns high within thee. Come, at
one blow dispatch me, and glut thy savage nature!"

Donald perceived this speech was uttered to excite his anger, that so he might
be irritated, and deprive his rival of a hateful existence.

He replied "Thy artifice is vain! Death were too gentle, too unsatisfactory
for my revenge; in a loathsome prison, where not a breath of air but what is
putrid, enters, shall thou pine, till kneeling thou do entreat an end to thy
existence, and even that mercy is denied thee. Guards, bear him hence, and see
that you obey my orders."

Resistance could avail him naught* as well might he have stopped the rising
tide upon the sandy beach, as thus unarmed, attempt to oppose the will of
Donald. The soldiers hood-winked his eyes, and placing him on horseback, set
forward. After a tedious journey, he found himself descending a long flight o^
steps; suddenly stopping, the guards released his sight, and taking off his
chains, left him in perfect darkness, while the harsh grating of the keys,
convinced him he had reached his dungeon.

CHAP. XI.
The midnight clock has tolled, and hark! the bell

MASON.
DESPAIR now seized upon the soul of Eldred; deprived of liberty, robbed of the
idol of his heart, whom with its utmost fervency he worshipped, what could he
wish for but death?

Irritated by reflection, and accusing fate, that instead of permitting him to
end his life in battle, like his ancestors, had doomed him to perish in ignoble
bondage, perhaps by the hand of an assassin, he traversed his dungeon, till his
foot striking against a something threw him on the ground.

Curiosity prompted him to seek the ^ause of his disaster; after a tedious
search he picked up a dagger, which from the feel he judged to be a rusty one.
While his thoughts were employed in vain conjectures, how, or for what purpose
the instrument came there, the beams of the moon obscurely gleamed through an
aperture, in the roof of the cell, and presented to his astonished sight an
human skeleton, then disappearing he was again involved in chaos.

So momentary and so faint had been the light, he could not persuade himself
but the horrors of his situation had conjured up this phenomenon, and that
'twas but a phantom of his disordered brain. Determined, however to convince
himself, he felt about the place, till his hand falling on the fleshless bones,
brought conviction. While in this dreadful situation, a low and dismal groan
from a far end of the dungeon vibrated in his ear. So many concurring horrors
were sure sufficient to unnerve the ^^bres of the strongest heart, and though
unmoved he would have encountered a host of foes, yet did this awful scene so
work upon his fancy he could scarcely support himself; a cold and chilly dew
flowed down his limbs, his knees forgot their office and shook under him, his
nerves were all relaxed and sinewless as the newborn infant's.

"What bloody act has this infernal den been made the scene of?" he
involuntarily cried; Unhappy wretch I am doomed to mingle my dust with thine:
Alas! thy miseries are ended, mine to come."

Harrassed with mental and corporeal fatigue, he threw himself upon the bed,
and strove to gain a temporary relief from his anxiety by sleep, but the
caresuspending poppies fled his eyelids, and his groans of anguish echoed
through the place. He arose, walked in a state of distraction, and his
reflections served only to make his situation more deplorable. In vain did he
endeavor to penetrate the mysterious gloom that surrounded his understanding;
the more he tried to unravel the knotted clue, the more was he entangled in the
mazes of conjecture, without one leading thread to guide him to certainty;
while the horrors of darkness, the whistling wind, and dreary sounds of distant
bells increased the gloom.

During the whole night he was disturbed by a repetition of sighs and
melancholy noises, which issued from one particular direction, and kept him in
a state of racking uneasiness and anxiety.

At length the wished for morn arrived, and by the aperture through which the
chaste Diana had the preceding evening cast her pale influence, the gaudy sun's
illustrious rays now made their way, and discovered to Eldred the situation of
his confinement.

'Twas a spacious, lofty vaulted cavern; on one side stood an oaken table,
rotten and worn out with age; a stool that bore the same marks of antiquity,
and a bed of straw. Upon the table was placed a lamp and tinder box, which, to
the prisoner, was a cheering sight, as it would prevent his passing another
night in the darkness which he had spent the one preceding.

The only light was admitted through the opening aforementioned, and which had
been occasioned by an earthquake or some other strong convulsion of nature.

He was in the course of the day served with provisions through a small iron
grate; and by the rattling of various keys, and the creaking jar of gates, he
judged his prison of too much strength for him to entertain a hope of ever
making his escape.

Faint with his wound and lack of proper sustenance, he made a slight repast on
bread and water (the only food allowed him) and sunk under the pleasing power
of Morpheus; losing for a time the remembrance of his cares.

While sleeping, his dreams presented the figure of an aged man, whose aspect
commanded veneration and respect. He was immured in a thick vapourous cloud,
from which his utmost efforts were vainly put in force to disengage himself,
till casting an eye on Eldred, the mist he was involved in vanished, h^s silver
beard and hair were converted into jetty locks, while the feeble limbs of age
grew renovated, and formed an hero in the prime of manhood, cased in steel:
full he gazed on Eldred, and uttering these words; "Heaven guard you!"
disappeared.

Surprise awakened Gle^cairn, who sound the God of day had disappeared, and
that the mist of darkness enveloped the earth. He arose, his mind wholly
engrossed in contemplating his dream, felt his way to the table, lighted his
lamp, and removed the skeleton into a recess at the far end of the cavern, and
the part whence the groans he had heard on the preceding night appeared to
issue. Scarce had he laid it on the ground, ere the same dismal sounds harshly
struck his ear, and determined him, if possible, to discover the cause. He
searched in vain, he could find no clue to guide him, nor could he persuade
himself but the sounds were supernatural. He tarried some time, till a deep
sigh made him suddenly start from a fragment of the rock on which he had seated
himself, and in so doing he threw down the light and extinguished it.

At the same time a something fell on his head: he stood almost petrified with
horror; another groan echoed through the cave; he sought for his lamp, found
it, and with trembling steps made for the table, rekindled the flame, and once
more entered the recess. All was quiet, on the ground he discovered a small
roll of paper, which he knew had fallen upon him while in the dark. He returned
to the outer part of his prison to examine it, but the damps aided by time, had
nearly obliterated the writing; nevertheless some parts were legible, and he
perused the manuscript.

CHAP. XII.
-- How well in thee appears
The constant service of the antique world;
When service sweet for duty, not for mee^!
SHAKESPEARE.
IT IS now necessary to return to Donald, who having resigned the captive Eldred
to his followers, entered the castle, and summoned Andrew to his presence.
Judging of others by himself, he imagined the Squire's fidelity might be shaken
by the power of gold, and determined to make him assure the daughter of
Wallace, that Eldred had entirely resigned her to the Lord of the Isles, on
condition that he was restored to liberty. This he knew must give Jane a
despicable opinion of her lover, and possibly might favor his own suit.

Donald took his seat in the hall, and the follower of the Lord Glencairn was
soon ushered in.

"Approach and fear not," said the Chief, "fain would I be thy friend. Convince
the lady Jane thy master has renounced her, and fortune is thy own. As an
earnest of my favor, I present you with this purse."

"No, my Lord," answered Andrew "my affection for him I serve, was the gift of
nature; I consider it as sacred, and will preserve it as I would the last
legacy of a departed friend. Barter it for gold! No! keep it yourself, you have
more need of it."

"I need of it?" replied Donald.

"Yes, you!" cried the squire, "Go, purchase a fresh conscience, if you can.
Exchange your robe, if possible, for an honest heart, and think yourself happy
in your bargain."

"Wretch!" returned the chief, "obey me, or dread my vengeance."

"My lord," said Andrew, "rest assured, my philosophy is equally proof against
your menaces, as your gold."

"Fool!" exclaimed the enraged Donald, "Guards convey him back to prison, and
double load him with chains!"

"I defy you," retorted the faithful fellow, "double that again, the though it of
having acted rightly will make my irons light; while the weight that clogs thy
bosom will make your frame heavy, though in the state of Adam."

"Away with him!" cried the chief.

The soldiers obeyed, and having pinioned his arms, which gave him an
appearance not unlike a trussed capon, conveyed him to his cell, and left him,
with the alternative of ^hewing the ^ud of bitter reflection, or some moldy
bread, which was the only sustenance they left him.

"Here is indeed," muttered the captive, "sufficient room for meditation; here
I can indulge my philosophy, which bids fair to be put to the proof, and with
as little fear of interruption as the distressed cottager has to fear the
relief of greatness. Should I ever be delivered from this Giant of the Castle,
this Donald, never more will I act a part so ill suited to my abilities, as
that of a Squire. I am certain Mars did not preside at my nativity. I am rather
apt to think my parents were thinking of an olive branch at the time -- No
matter; I am afraid my death will be occasioned by the branch of the nearest
oak. I should not be surprised if this fiend was to hang me, and then my
masters promises would be fulfilled, that by following his fortune, I should
get exalted. Sure enough, I set out with a promising prospect; but it reminds
me of the old proverb, Praise a fair day at night. I am afraid I shall be kept
as a scarecrow, though forsooth there seems little occasion for that, the
birds appear to have as great an aversion as myself to this place. The only one
I saw, during my stay at Edric's friend's, was an old owl, as melancholy as
myself. Oh, that I was reading Plato in the buttery; there I had food for the
body as well as for the mind. Alas! I shall never see those days again."

Thus did the unlucky Andrew lament his fate.

In the mean time, Donald sought the apartment of Jane, whose timid nature he
disturbed with his impetuous solicitations. Much were her hours embittered by
his addresses; still she resisted his importunities, as firmly as the rock
withstands the lashing waves beneath; and an unlooked for circumstance called
him, for a time, from the castle, and relieved her from the restraint of his
company.

Nor was his conduct to Jane the only injustice Donald was guilty of, Scotland,
at that period, abounded with robbers; the whole kingdom was in a state of
civil war; the depredations of banditti were not only tolerated but encouraged
by the barons. Nay they were employed by them to destroy the neighboring
nobility.

Donald, whose disposition was suited to such deeds, soon made himself
conspicuous. At the instigation of Earl Douglas, the most powerful of the
Caledonian chiefs, who had been defeated by the king's army, he summoned a
numerous force to join him, under the command of Lauchlan Macleod, and Murdock
Gibson, two noted robbers, with whom he invaded every place that was devoted to
their sovereign, sparing neither age nor infancy, burning towns and villages,
and enriching himself with the spoils thereof.

He attacked Argyle, and the Isle of Arran; and having obtained possession of
the Castle of the latter by stratagem, he levelled it with the earth.

From thence he passed to Lochaber, and to Murray, where he exercised the same
barbarities as at the preceding places.

He likewise destroyed the Castle of Inverness, after having taken it in a
manner unworthy a warrior, and put the garrison to the sword.

These things he did, not so much to gratify Lord Douglas, as to indulge his
own sanguinary, avaricious turn of mind. Like the devouring locust, he carried
with him destruction, and delighted in the miseries of his fellow creatures.

CHAP. XIII.
Mourn, hapless Caledonia, mourn
Thy banished peace, thy laurels torn!
Thy ^ors, for valor long renowned,
Lie slaughtered on their native ground.
S^OLL^T.
WHILE the iron hand of civil war raged thus in Scotland, Henry of England
perceiving an advantageous opportunity, as he and his predecessors were ever
wont to do, commanded the inhabitants of Northumberland, and the other counties
on the borders, to make incursions; while the distracted state of Caledonia,
prevented James, (the sovereign of that nation) making any considerable attempt
to repulse the foe; and a defeat of his army by Henry Piercy, Earl of
Northumberland, caused Donald to think this a favorable juncture to obtain a
pardon for himself and his associates.

He therefore sent messengers to this purpose to his majesty, who handled the
matter very craftily, not openly and plainly forgiving the tyrant, nor yet
making the ambassadors entirely despair of remission for their chief.

He answered them gently, that the Lord of the Isles deserved no mercy at his
hands, that the languinary acts o^ which he had been guilty called aloud for
vengeance; nevertheless, that kings who represent the divine majesty of our
maker, should, in holding the balance of justice, ever lean toward the scale
of mercy. That his pardon depended entirely on himself; that he should do some
praiseworthy action, ere he was reinstated in his favor, and that he should
moreover repair every injury inflicted by him.

With this answer Donald was obliged to be content. At the same time
ambassadors arrived from Richard, Duke of York, to cla^m the assistance of the
Scottish monarch against Henry the sixth, whom he purposed to depose* and to
place himself upon the throne of England; in return for which he promised to
restore the lands in Northumberland enjoyed by James's progenitors, with
Berwick and all the fields adjacent; and, to conclude, vowed a perpetual peace
and amity, to be maintained between the two realms.

When the ambassadors had concluded their harangue, they thus received their
answer:

"It is not unknown the just title that Richard Plantagenet has to the crown
of England; but my assistance should not be too precipitately granted, neither
should a prince, who has so long, and by consent of his kingdom, been invested
with the insignia of royalty, be despoiled for a light cause, nor without
mature deliberation; but that I refer to the wisdom of the English nobility. I
have just reason for complaint against my brother Henry. First, that he did,
without provocation, invade my dominions, at a time when they were internally
rent by civil commotions; then also when I did seek redress, he delayed to give
me an answer thereupon. If, therefore, the Duke of York, with the Lords of his
faction, will keep promise, I here pledge myself, that my whole strength shall
be exerted to drive your present sovereign from the throne, and place the crown
upon his rival's head."

With this answer the ambassadors took their leave, and repeated the same to
their master.

In the mean time James summoned his forces to be ready on a certain day, in
order to invade their ancient enemies. On his march he was met and accosted by
an English, a creature of king Henry's, and a perfect adept in the art of
lying. He was accompanied by a monk, who feigned a marvelous gravity, (...)
pretended he was entrusted with bills and commissions from the Pontiff of Rome.

He thus addressed the Caledonian Prince.

"It is the Pope's command, that neither the sovereign of Scotland, nor any of
his army, shall pass farther into England, on pain of the curses and censures
of Holy Kirk. For through the frivolous dissentions of Christian kings, have
the Turks, (those cruel enemies to our religion) crept daily more and more into
Europe. Therefore, be all debates, battles and strife set aside between the
disciples of our Savior, and their utmost endeavors used to expel the
infidels, who would not only spoil them of their worldly liberty, but also of
the word of God: on which account, I am now authorized by the Pope, to promise,
that all ravages committed by King Henry shall be repaired, and that ye be from
this time on terms of amity."

James, believing nothing of deceit in these fraudulent hypocrites, obeyed the
mandate, and disbanded his troops, but was not long returned, before he
discovered the craft and subtilty of his foes; equally enraged at his own
credulity, he collected a fresh body of men, and entered the English borders.

While these transactions passed, the Duke of York led his forces against
Henry, whom he attacked, routed his army, slew many of his leaders, and made
the king himself prisoner, whom he conducted to London, where the Parliament
pronounced him incapable of ruling, though they permitted him to continue the
regal title, constituting Richard governor of the realm.

Thus was Henry, who at the ea^ age of nine months, was acknowledged monarch of
England and France, the prime of manhood deprived of both, and the prophecy
made good. " That Henry of Monmouth should win, what Henry of Windsor should
lose."

In the mean time James invaded the English sovereign's favorers in the north,
and when he had won the town of Roxburgh, and laid siege to the castle thereof,
ambassadors arrived, from his ally the Duke of York, requesting him to raise
the siege, as he had entirely carried his point.

James claimed the lands promised, to which the ambassadors replied they could
not give an answer.

Iritated at finding himself the dupe of both parties, he vowed revenge, and
swore he would dye the white rose of a deeper hue than its rival. Moreover,
that he would not depart till the castle ^as his own, so (...) the
commissioners.

Soon after he was joined by Donald, and a powerful reinforcement, who offered
to penetrate farther into England, and by several deeds of valor, he
recommended himself particularly to the notice of his monarch; his tent was
pitched nearest him, and naught was done without his concurrence.

During the siege, the King was unfortunately slain by the bursting of a
cannon, near which he stood. His death was regretted by every one; but in a
short time his place was supplied by his queen, who arrived with her son, and
restrained their grief.

"Here," she cried, "is the offspring of him you lament; show your regard to
your deceased Prince, by attacking the enemies of his successor, nor vainly
yield to an unmanly sorrow."

These words inspired the soldiers; they stormed the place, headed by Donald,
and after a stout resistance captured it. There we shall leave the Lord of the
Isles to reap the reward of his victory.

CHAP. XIV.
Blood has be^n shed ere now, in elder time,
Ere human statute purged the general weal,
Aye, and since too, murders have been performed,
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,

And there an end; but now they rise again,
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
And push us from our stools; this is more strange

IT IS now proper to return to the unhappy Eldred, who was left busily employed
in perusing the manuscript, some parts of which were effaced, the rest was
legible, and he read it.

MS.
Into whose hands soever these lines may fall, if the current of compassion
flows from their eyes, surely they will not refuse to bedew the following

The shafts of adversity fall on me, even as the waters of heaven do bent the

I le^t my castle, and without any retinue, ^ave my squire, took my course
northward. Dark was the night and loud the whistling wind; fiercely it
blustered through the thick foliage of the mountain pine; in roaring torrents
rushed the angry river over its oozy bed; all nature was convulsed, even things
inanimate seemed moved, and warned me of my danger!

Alas! little did I think what my sad destiny had reserved for me!

Passing the out-skirts of a grove, while yet the warring of the elements
continued, methought I heard the cry of deep distress. I listened with
attention, but in vain; the increased clamor of the storm baffled every
endeavor, and I was on the point of continuing my journey, when a piercing
shriek asailed my ear, on which I spurred my steed through the thick growing
trees, resolved to give assistance! hard, that while I hoped I was about to aid
the miserable, I rushed to meet my own doom.

Having advanced some way into the forest, how was my astonishment excited, on
being attacked by a party of armed men? Their company was numerous; however, I
determined to sell my life dearly, and unsheathing my sword, in which I was
followed by my trusty lacquey, made a stout resistance; but my servant slain,
and myself surrounded, I was disarmed, ^ast bound, and conducted to this
inhospitable den.

Useless were my conjectures, and vain my enquiries, as to where I was, or for
what detained. The following morning, I heard the ponderous portal of my prison
swing on its rusty hinges, and turning toward the door, the faint light
discovered to me the features of a brother!

Inhuman Wallace! at this moment my heart aches at the remembrance -- My poor
neglected infant! my dear, my beloved Eldred! never shall the distresses of an
injured parent reach thine ear!

The manuscript dropped from the hand of Glencairn at these lines, by which he
learned the skeleton was that of his long lost father. He pressed the tablets
to his lips with devotion, then starting from his seat, he flew to the recess
where he had deposited the remains; threw himself upon the ground, and clasped
the fleshless bones within his arms. At length he resolved to dig a grave, and
commit them to the earth.

This he accomplished by means of the rusty dagger he had found: then wrapping
his robe, of which he divested himself, round the corse, he returned it to that
from whence it sprung.

At that moment the nightly screechowl uttered a lamentable cry, which was
answered by a deep groan that issued from the corner whence he had heard the
preceding ones. His blood grew clotted in his veins, he fancied the spirit of
his departed sire had taken that method of spur him to revenge.

"Shade of my ill-fated, my lamented father!" exclaimed Eldred, "rest in peace!
Fear not, but thy murder shall be expiated. Blood calls for blood, nor shall it
call in vain; for sure that power who has brought me hither to discover the
author of thy dreadful end, will, by some miracle, effect my deliverance, and
make me the instrument of vengeance on his head!"

Having prayed awhile, he covered the bones with earth, and passed the
remainder of the night in heavy rumination.

The agitation he had labored under, his bodily as well as mental agony had
exhausted him, and tired nature craved repose. He enjoyed some hours of broken
slumber, nor did he awake till night; he then trimmed his lamp, and returned to
the manuscript.

In vain are my complaints; my sighs are only mimicked by the roaring wind, and
my tears mocked by the chilling rain!

My days pass unnumbered. Long, very long, have I now been an inmate of this
savage dwelling; Never, oh never more shall I breathe the fresh invigorating
air; no more wander in the scenes of youthful pleasures. My only prospect is
the rocky walls of this prison, my only refuge is my grave!

My sufferings are too great to bear. Surely, if my sad heart is made of
penetrable stuff, the cords must shortly crack, and end me!

I rise from a long night of sorrow; my health is much impaired; my strength
enfeebled. A few more tedious days of bondage, and sure this hapless frame will
shatter. Thou, heaven, who know my inmost thoughts, can testify my only care
is for the welfare of my darling son: on his young heart be virtue and humanity
imprinted; may he be ever ready to assist the unfortunate, and may the
corroding hand of sorrow never assail him; let his life ^e passed in happiness,
and when his Maker thinks fit to call him from this transitory life, be poor
men's prayers his epitaph!

Here the Manuscript ended.
CHAP. XV.
Come, melancholy! silent power,
Companion of my lonely hour,
To sober thought confined!
Thou sweetly sad, ideal guest,
In all thy soothing charms confessed,

Indulge my pensive mind.
CARTER.
ELDRED bedewed the sheets with his tears, placed them in his bosom, and
repaired to the grave of his parent. While every faculty was absorbed in
contemplation, a loud shriek made the vital blood grow chilly at his heart; at
the same time a noise at the gate of the cavern caused him to seek the reason.
He expected to see his executioner, but his horror was converted into surprise,
when he beheld a man unarmed, and advancing toward him; he descried the
features of Duncan, son of Carrol, who was Sir James's agent in his villainies,
and an inhabitant of the castle.

"Good heaven!" cried Eldred, "by what strange chance do I find thee here? tell
me." --

"Suspend your enquiries," returned the youth, "and consider only your safety.
Your prison doors are open to you, fly."

The silver tongues of angels could not have been more welcome to the ears of
Glencairn than these words, still his admiration increased.

"I conjure you," said he, "inform me by what strange means your kindness is
enabled to befriend me."

"Briefly thus: last night, in passing through the gallery of the castle, the
buz of people in conversation attracted my notice. I listened, and heard Sir
James and my father in earnest discourse; you, they often mentioned, and from
what they said, I learned you were here in confinement, and under the latter's
custody.

"He had for some time a large bunch of keys, of which he is so extremely
careful, that in the day he kept them under lock, and at night deposited them
beneath his pillow. I questioned him concerning what place they were the
safeguard of, but was silenced with a frown."

"Suspend your idle curiosity, nor for your life attempt to develope the
secrets of my heart."

"This was his answer. What I heard in the gallery convinced me those were the
keys of your prison, and I have spent the whole day in devising means for your
emancipation. To night my father was unexpectedly summoned by Sir James, and
being at the time employed in the locker, where he kept his charge, in his
haste, left the door open, and gave me the wished-for opportunity of restoring
you to that liberty, which, but for this lucky chance, you never would have
regained. Surely I am not culpable in thwarting the schemes of a parent, when
they are unworthy of him; and that Being, whose scrutinizing eye can look into
my very soul, knows that I act but from his just impulse."

"What savage place is this?" said Eldred, " The Haunted Cavern!" replied
Duncan. " The Haunted Cavern, indeed!" exclaimed our hero, "Little did I think,
at the time I treated the report but as the idle chimera of the peasants, that
'twas the haunt of a beloved --."

He recollected himself in time, to prevent the secret of the murder escaping
his lip. He quitted the cell, after damping the earthy pillow of his father,
and vowing to dedicate his life unto revenge.

At the door of his dungeon, he returned his deliverer every acknowledgment
that a heart stored with gratitude could inspire; then left him, and went to
the humble dwelling of old Maud, where he begged she would permit him to remain
for a short time, telling her, as she valued his life, not to divulge his being
there.

Eldred determined here to make his abode, till the search, which would of
course be made, should cease; then to visit the mansion of his ancestors,
relate the unnatural end of his father, and invoke the tenants to arm them for
revenge on his assassin.

He passed the night in a state of anxiety. In the morning, the same lady whom
he had seen at the cottage on the day of his elopement with Jane, again made
her appearance; still she was veiled; with impatience she questioned him
concerning his fair cousin, in which he satisfied her as much as in him lay,

In the evening Maud, by the desire of Glencairn, repaired to the castle, and
on her return gave him the following account.

"I hobbled at your request to the Baron's. I am sure my old feet ach for it,
and well they may; for crossing the rocks that lie 'twixt here and there would
bruise the hoof of a camel."

"Spare your observations," interrupted Eldred, "and tell me what tidings you
have brought."

"Spare my observations!" returned she, "I have made none, except on my
fatigue, and the badness of the road. Well, at last I arrived at Sir James's,
and the first person that I saw was Duncan; knowing from the service he had
done you, and a signal service too, let me tell you. Sure his goodness will
make some recompense for the life of his father; never were two so unlike.
There is as much difference between them as there ^s 'twixt a chappin of
whiskey and a pail of ditch water. Ah, my Lord, your gratitude to him cannot be
too great."

"I am not," said Eldred, "to learn what I owe him, nor will my heart, I hope,
ever forget the favors I have received from any. Rest assured, my good mother,
you shall not go unrewarded."

"Reward!" said the old woman, "I scorn it! it is my heart that prompts me to
lend you what little aid I can* and that looks for no other reward than the
satisfaction it feels in doing good. Well, I imparted to Duncan your being
here."

"Strange things," replied he, "have happened at the castle: last night, during
my absence at the Haunted Cavern, a pilgrim arrived at the gate; the laws of
hospitality forbad Sir James to refuse the lodging he demanded, or rest assured
he would have done it."

"This Duncan need not have told me, for I know the Baron's disposition; he
considers not the proper use of riches, which heaven by granting in profusion
to one, enables him to assist those to whom fortune has been less bountiful.
These are my ideas of wealth, and I am sure --."

"For heaven's sake!" cried the anxious Eldred, "suspend your comments, and
ease my impatience!"

"Well, well!" said Maud, "you are impetuous, but when your youthful blood is
lowered by age, you will know better."

"This pilgrim," continued Duncan, "has won the hearts of the whole family;
they idolize him. Now mark me; at the dead of night, the inhabitants were
alarmed by the cries of Sir James; they flew to his chamber, and found him in a
state impossible to picture: His eyes were glaring, the perspiration dropped
from off him, and his features were convulsed with horror. In the first sally
of his panic, he unwarily discovered the cause; he protested the apparition of
the late Lord Glencairn had appeared to him, had opened the curtains at the
bottom of his couch, presented himself in armor, and that having stood there a
few moments, he suddenly vanished. "My father," continued Duncan, "now entered
the apartment, and ordered the domestics to retire. In the morning, he
informed them 'twas nothing more than a dream with which their Lord had been
troubled, and which had left so strong an impression on him. This, though they
mentioned not their mistrust, I could observe they were far from crediting. Sir
James is confined by illness to his bed, and much I fear a guilty conscience is
his complaint. Recall to mind the misterious manner in which the late Lord of
Glencairn disappeared: I dare say no more, but I would not have his heart in my
breast for a kingdom. Trembling, I saw Carol take the keys and quit the castle:
in a little time be returned, and demanded of me whether I had not, on the
preceding evening, touched them; I denied having seen them. He sat for some
time musing, then starting from his chair, left me; but I am certain he has
concealed his prisoner's escape from Sir James."

"This was Duncan's account, and you have it in his own words."

Here Maud ceased to speak, and Eldred gave her the thanks which were her due.

CHAP. XVI.
Bring me unto my trial when you will.
Died he not in his bed? Where should he die?
Can I make men live whether they will or no?
Oh! torture me no more, I will confess.
SHAKESPEARE.
WHEN the residents of the cottage were retired to rest, Eldred wandered from
thence to get a little air, of which he stood in great need. Unknowingly he
took his way toward the Cavern, and seating himself upon a fragment of stone,
contemplated the beauties of nature: the moon shone bright, but was now and
then obscured by darksome clouds which swiftly flew across the luminary, and
seemed to foretell the approaching storm. Here he was soon disturbed by the same
noise he had been accustomed to hear while in confinement and which now
appeared to issue from the cave. He started, and perceived a figure gliding
along at no great distance. Resolved, if possible, to know what it was, he
followed it, but in vain; the various turnings of the rocks favored the object
of his pursuit, who soon disappeared, and le^t him wrapped in wonder. He
recollected a similar circumstance befaling Jane, and considered this as a
stimulative to him to avenge his father's death.

The castle clock now chimed the hour of twelve, and the fast falling rain
warned him to retire. He measured his steps toward the mansion of Wallace,
determined no longer to delay his vengeance, and by a secret passage entered
the building. The time conspired with his purpose; the croaking raven from the
mouldering turrets welcomed his approach; he hastened to the apartment of his
uncle, and entered it; around the couch the curtains were closed; he undrew
them, and beheld his victim buried in sleep, while conscience, that bane to
rest, disturbed even his slumbers.

"Behold!" he cried, "the ghastly spectre! See how his eye balls glare! Alas!
poor injured shade, can naught make thee atonement? Oh, murdered brother!"

The inflamed temper of Eldred could brook no more, in rage he exclaimed:

"Villain! awake and meet thy doom!" Wallace opened his eyes, and seeing
Glencairn, the blood forsook his cheek: fixed as though influenced by the
basilisk, he gazed upon the youth, when the power of utterance returning:
"Gracious powers!" he cried, "who is it I see?"

"Thou see," said Eldred, "the offspring of the murdered Archibald. Long have
thou triumphed, and with impunity enjoyed the produce of thy crimes; vengeance
is now at hand; from me thou art destined to receive it."

"I submit," quoth Wallace, "to the will of fate: my punishment is just; but,
O! I charge thee give me a little time for penitence, if heaven grants it, do
not thou refuse it!"

"Imposter!" returned Glencairn, "too well I conceive the shallow artifice:
thou would gain time, in the vain hope that some of thy infernal pack will
rescue thee, their leading blood-hound: but prepare -- as well might the taken
deer use persuasion with the ^ur that holds him, as thou hope to escape my just
revenge; revenge for a murdered parent, whose death is now avenged in this."

He raised his dagger, and was about to plunge it in the breast of his
prostrate victim, when an opposite door suddenly opened, and a pilgrim entered,
crying; "Hold! hold thy hand!"

Surprise called Eldred from his purpose; he cast his looks upon the stranger,
who tearing from his face an artificial beard, and divesting himself of his
weeds, displayed the figure of a warrior, (like to that he had seen in his
dream) who flew into his arms, exclaiming; "My son, my son!"

So momentary had been this scene, that the faculties of Eldred were totally
suspended, and the unhappy Wallace, on seeing the palmer throw off his
disguise, had fallen into a swoon.

"Merciful powers!" cried the astonished youth, "is it possible I see my
father?"

"Thou do," replied his sire, for it was him: "in me thou see him, while I
behold in thee a son, to reward my past misfortunes, and soothe my latter
hours."

Joy, the natural consequence of such unexpected happiness, having somewhat
subsided, their thoughts were turned to the wretched criminal, who still
remained insensate. At length, with much care, they brought him to himself, but
no sooner did he descry the features of his injured brother, than he relapsed
into his former state; nor was it but with much difficulty they could convince
him 'twas not the spirit, but the living Archibald, who stood before him, and
strove by every soothing method, to reconcile the culprit to himself -- but
ineffectual were his endeavors, repentance had touched his heart; and the
barbed dart of conscience forbade him ease.

"In vain," said he, "you kindly try to comfort me; reason pictures me a savage
unnatural wretch: for not to me you owe your life -- alas! long since I thought
you dead! Blessed be Providence that has preserved you! Avarice, that cursed
passion, was the source of all, and at his altar would I have sacrificed the
world! Your son I could not bear to look upon, and though a something, I will
not say humanity, restrained me from destroying him; yet when I ^ound my
schemes thwarted, when I had formed an alliance for my daughter, which but for
him would have taken place, I doomed him to the same wretched cavern, where I
imagined you had breathed your last. Seek not to make me wish for life, even
now I feel the biting agonies of death: summon my servants, and let me by
reparation make some atonement." The domestics appeared.

"Remember," quoth Wallace, "my nephew Eldred, is the heir of all that I
possess; thou, much wronged brother, curse not my memory; your sister, my
injured wife, was at the instigation of Duncan, by my orders, sent to -- "

Here his speech failed him; death stamped his seal upon his eyelids, and had
he lived but as he died, sighs and tears would have honored his memory which
was reviled with scoffings and upbraidings.

Eldred was acknowledged Lord of the Castle and its vast appurtenances: the
rustic tenants hailed their new master, with shouts of joy; the gates of this
hitherto inhospitable mansion were now thrown open, and welcome given to every
one; the ponderous ox smoaked before the fire, and the spacious hall resounded
with the sounds of mirth and minstrelley.

CHAP. XVII.
-- What are fifty, what a thousand slaves,
Matched to the sinew of a single arm
That strikes for Liberty?
BROOK.
ELDRED, by the desire of his father, whom we shall henceforth call the Lord
Glencairn, recited his adventures. On coming to the part which related to the
hermit, he showed the ring, and questioned his sire concerning it.

"That ring," returned his parent, "I presented to the Lord John Talbot ere
thou were born. He was in Scot land on some business of State, and we formed,
during his stay, a solemn friendship; he fell in the French wars, and I am now
convinced by the arm of your Anchorite."

Eldred then requested an account of his own fortunes.

"Alas! my son," he replied, "I cannot satisfy you without entering into a
detail of my sufferings; misfortunes I will no more entitle them, since I have
at last the happiness of seeing you again. When last these eyes beheld you, you
were an infant; your mother dying in giving you birth, my whole affection
centered in the dear pledge she left behind her, and I thought she lived again
in you, on whom my heart reclined as its last prop. On that fatal night that I
departed from my Castle, before I mounted, I pressed you to my heart, and
invoked a blessing on you; then journeyed toward the dwelling of Wallace, who
having intimation of my design to visit him, planted the ruffians who took me
in the grove. This I learned from himself on his visiting me in the cavern. It
would be superfluous to mention circumstances of which the manuscript has
informed you: four tedious years did I pass in that dreary place, during which
time my rest was often disturbed by the melancholy noises you have mentioned.
In vain were my endavors put in force to discover the cause; in vain I racked
my brain, and at length concluded the Cavern was haunted by some restless
spirit: full of these thoughts, my time grew doubly irksome.

"One stormy night, the rain beat hard against my prison roof; the peals of
thunder rattled over my head, and vivid flames of sulphurous lightning flashed
through the opening of the rock. Suddenly me thought, from the tremendous
crash, the cave was rent in pieces: I flew to the recess where the shock seemed
above the rest; but what was my surprise, when I found a part of it nearest the
ground torn by the fury of the elements, was broken away? nor can I picture the
agitation of my mind, when I discovered it opened into a long narrow passage. I
considered this as the kind work of Providence, and falling on my knees,
returned thanks to the Almighty, who thus seemed to promise me my liberty.

"I extinguished my lamp, not knowing where the path might lead me to. I felt
my way for some time, and at length descried a glimmering light, which made me
more cautious how I proceeded. On my nearer approach, I found it was diffused
by a lamp, suspended by a long iron chain from the roof of a cave, round which
were scattered, breast-plaits cuirasses, helmets, in short, every implement of
war. At the far end sat the figure of a man cased in steel, and his beaver
being up gave me an opportunity of seeing his face, which was as pale, as
death. I was much astonished, nay, such was the effect of my surprise, that I
considered him as something supernatural.

"On recollection, I thought my best way would be to return to my dungeon, and
tarry a fitter opportunity. I did so, and waited with impatience the return of
the following evening. As soon as it arrived I sought the passage again, and in
the cave beheld the same figure as before. I stood for some time gazing on him,
my situation being such as gave me a full view of him without fear of
discovery. Suddenly he started from his seat, and vanished through an outlet
that was near him. After a time, finding all quiet, I ventured out, but at that
instant he returned, and seeing me, unsheathed his sword and made toward me.
Fortunately the place was so well stored with weapons, that I soon armed
myself, and after an obstinate combat, stretched him drowned in blood upon the
earth.

"Compassion prompted me to give him every assistance in my power. I unbuckled
his breast plate, and endeavored to staunch his wound, but he pushed me from
him."

"Your care" he said, is vain: even now the Angel of death hovers around me,
and will shortly close my eyes for ever! Misfortunes, biting want have leagued
me with a band of robbers; listen to my sufferings and pity me.!

"I am son to the late Sir William Lovel, England claims my birth: in the
fruitful county of Norfolk I drew my first breath, and received the fostering
care of a fond father; the tender solicitude with which he watched my juvenile
years, can never be obliterated from the tablets of my memory, so long as I
possess the power of reflection.

"The first seventeen years of my life passed without any incident worthy
relating, when one of our tenants, named Brackenbury, was le^t guardian to the
daughter of a deceased friend, who had resided in a distant part of the
kingdom. On her arrival, her beauty entirely engrossed the conversation of the
place, and the continual commendations I heard of the pe^ections of this young
damsel* made me resolve to see her. I therefore one day, on my return from
riding, called at Brackenbury's to request a draught of water, but in hopes of
beholding his charge.

"I alighted by his desire, and was conducted into the cottage, where the first
object that attracted my notice was his lovely ward, Lauretta. Never did I
behold so charming a creature; but if I was captivated by her beauty, I was
much more so by her engaging modest mein, which had such an effect upon me, I
from that moment became enslaved.

"I visited my adored Lauretta every day; I disclosed my passion, and had the
satisfaction to find she returned my love: but Brackenbury, who was a man of
penetration, soon discovered the cause of my visits, and threatened, if I did
not discontinue them, to inform Sir William.

"I left the cottage in a state little short* of phrenzy, from which I became
gloomy and reserved; not only my mind, but my body was infected; I could take
no nourishment, sleep forsook my pillow, and my days were miserable. My father
perceived the alteration, and importuned me to divulge the reason; I could not
resist his entreaties, and confessed my affection for Lauretta."

"The good man heard me without a single interruption, then replied; "my dear
William, I do not blame you; you are young, and I must own the person on whom
you have bestowed your love, though neither rich or nobly born, is worthy of
your tenderness; I entertained indeed better hopes, but rather than see you
thus, you have my leave to espouse Lauretta."

"Words would be inadequate to the transports I felt on hearing him sanction my
love; I flew to the abode of my mistress, and informed her of the conversation
that had passed; her joy was equal to my own."

"I now fancied nothing wanting to perfect my felicity; but oh how transient is
the bliss of mortals! Three days previous to that which was ^o have put my
destined bride into my possession, my dear, my beloved parent was thrown from
his hor^e and so violently bruised as to cause his death. I was with him at the
time this fatal accident happened, and with the assistance of a peasant removed
him to the castle.

"A surgeon was immediately sent for, who pronounced his wounds mortal. Finding
he had but a short time to live, he ordered every one but myself to quit the
room; their desired me to sit down beside him.

"My dear boy!" said he, "you are going to lose a tender father, and a sincere
friend; your happiness has constituted the chief study of my life, your company
has been the only solace of my latter years. I have, William, time only to say
a few words relative to your future conduct. Never cringe to your superiors,
nor commit a dishonorable action for the sake of any temptation that may be
held out to you; rest assured, the greatest happiness man can taste is to
retrospect his past conduct, without feeling the goading stings of a
reproachful conscience. To your dependants be ever affable, and let it be your
constant care to reward the deserving. Farewell, my son, may heaven bless you!"

"Here, with a sigh, he resigned his breath to the Supreme Being, and slept in
peace!"

CHAP. XV.
If misfortune comes, she brings along
The bravest virtues. And so many great
Illustrious spirits have conversed with woe,
Have in her school been taught, as are enough
To consecrate distress, and make ambition
Even wish the frown, beyond the smile of fortune.
THOMSON.
"The violence of my grief," continued the robber, "threw me into a fever,
during which time Sir William was interred. On the following day, I received a
visit from my cousin, the Lord Lovel. Having always lived on amicable terms
with him, I imagined his coming the result of friendship, but I was soon
undeceived,

"On entering the hall, after consoling me for my irrepairable loss, with a
profusion of apparent kindness, he enquired whether my father had left a will?
I answered in the negative, on which he altered his tone, saying;"

"I thought as much; '^is therefore necessary I should let you know the cause
of my being here is to take possession of these domains, which now devolve on
me as nearest heir. I am moreover to inform you, your birth is illigitimate,
and that you quit this place tomorrow. You acknowledge Sir William left no
testament, you cannot therefore lay claim to any thing."

"I was petrified at these words, but the flinty hearted wretch, far from
feeling compassion for my situation, repeated his order that I should leave the
castle the next day.

"Having disengaged myself from the stupor wherein surprise had cast me, rage
succeeded* and I laid my hand upon my sword, with an intention to offer him a
sacrifice to filial duty and affection; for the memory of my mother, although
she died ere I was old enough to feel her loss, was highly revered by me. He
perceiving my design, called his attendants, who immediately entered and
disarmed me.

"Turn," cried he, "yon bastard forth, and if he ever presumes to come within
these walls again, death shall be his punishment."

"It was in vain to make resistance, as his followers were much too numerous
for my domestics to cope with; I therefore submitted to my destiny, and left
him master of what indeed was mine. Thus was I stripped of every thing, and
shut out from the very mansion, which bu^ a short hour before owned me for its
Lord!

"At first I thought of making an appeal to the law; but too true I was the
fruit of an alliance, which, though rendered firm by mutual affection, never
was sanctioned by the matrimonial rites. I also thought of visiting my beloved
Lauretta, but honor forbade me; to present a beggar to her arms I imagined,
would be an ill return for her unfeigned affection.

"I set forward, determined to turn my back on Norfolk for ever. I traveled
the whole night and the following day, scarce taking any refreshment. I entered
Scotland, and was passing near this spot, when my way was interrupted by a man,
who brandishing his sword, bade me deliver my money. Unused to be commanded, I
refused, on which he furiously attacked me; but I, aware of him, unsheathed my
weapon and escaped the blow. Long we fought, without the least advantage on
either side, till a deep wound which he received in the sword arm, caused him
to drop his falchion.

"My life is yours," he exclaimed, "take it!"

"I replied, no! although the unprovoked manner in which you attacked me would
authorize such a deed, yet religion which teaches us to forgive our enemies,
forbids me! Therefore live.

"He was about to return his thanks, when I observed a body of men issue from a
grove at no great distance, and hasten toward us. On drawing nearer, and
perceiving their associate wounded, they were about to sacrifice me to their
rage; when he generously cried hold! and learn, though your profession compels
you to divest the benighted traveller, to respect valor! Henceforth consider
this young man as my friend"

"I found by the deference paid him, he was their captain. His hurt required
assistance; and seeing I was fatigued he begged I would accompany him to his
cave, where I should be welcome to pass the night. Unable to suspect a person
who had behaved so nobly, I accepted his invitation.

"We walked till we came to a group of lofty rocks, and having wandered about
half a mile in the midst of them, entered this place. The chief having had his
wound dressed ordered some refreshment. In a minute the table was covered with
all sorts of delicate viands and rich wines, which, notwithstanding so much in
want of, I hardly tasted.

"Having finished our repast we retired. I arose early in the morning, but
found the captain up before me: he informed me he had, spite of the anguish of
his wound, left his bed in compliment to me. Our breakfast ended, he desired
all, save myself, to retire. As soon as they were gone, he thus addressed me:

"Stranger, you will doubtless wonder, in a place like this, to find a being
possessed of feeling; but let this teach you never to judge the heart by the
outward appearance, and learn, that a mortal compelled by poverty to embrace
the rude life of a robber, may have virtues to which a prince, with all his
greatness, may be a stranger. You have spared my life in a situation where few
would have acted like you; it is a vast debt and never can be cancelled. You
appear unhappy; can I in any way contribute to your satisfaction? If I can, let
not an ill timed diffidence prevent your putting my professions to the test."

"I thanked him for his kindness, but assured him my griefs were not within his
power to cure. He answered, his only inducement for noticing my melancholy was
the hope of being able to dispel it. Convinced by his manner he meant me well,
I resolved to trust him with my history, which I had no sooner finished, than
in a fit of passion he cried, "Just heaven? are such villains, the worst of
robbers, permitted to escape the lash of censure and rigor of the law, while
miserable wretches like myself, who only take from their fellow creatures to
satisfy the wants of nature, are branded with the most opprobrious epithets?
Young man, enlist yourself with me, and it shall be my study to make
restitution for the wrongs you have received from fortune."

"I consented, and became a comrade in their depredations. Long I had not
followed this detested calling, when our captain died, and by the general
assent of the band, I was elected commander, which post I have since filled:
but gracious heaven has by your hand shortened a life, the latter part of which
has been marked with crimes yet has not my soul been tainted with inhumanity,
and dearly would I make atonement; while yet life lasts, let me attempt it. In
the several cells this place contains are numberless victims, who have long -- "

"The unerring dart of death entered his heart at these words, and forbad his
tongue its repentant office. I searched the cave, but to no purpose; so
artfully were these dens concealed, that the piercing eye of the lynx in vain
might have sought them.

"Tired with my fruitless attempt, I was compelled to seek my safety; I
therefore returned to my own cavern, taking with me the body of the robber. I
stripped him, and exchanging clothes, left him, having disfigured his
countenance with blood, and laid the dagger near him, that so my persecutors
might suppose it was my body, and that in a fit of desperation I had put an end
to my existence.

"I then entered the passage, and having stopped up the aperture through which
I made my escape, with rubbish sought the outlet I had observed the robber
vanish through, and which, to my extreme surprise and joy, restored me to
liberty."

The mountain nymph, sweet liberty
MILTON.
"FAINTLY can I picture the sensations at that moment, in which all remembrance
of my past sorrows were for a time suspended. The mist of night was fleeting
fast, while in the east the ruddy tinted sky announced the arrival of the god
of day, and cast its influence on the bosom of the ocean. The air after so long
confinement I could ill bear: still the necessity of my quick departure gave me
fresh vigor, and urged me on. I traveled toward my castle, and at length the
turrets of my mansion showed themselves, when the appearance of an aged peasant
caused me to make toward him, and I quickly recognized his features; his life
had been spent in the vassalage of my ancestors.

"I accosted him as a stranger, determined to know whether the remembrance of
Glencairn obtained a place in his mind.

"Friend," quoth I, "I have traveled ^ar: say, does the spring of hospitality
influence the portal of yon edifice?"

"Seek it not," quoth he, "the story of woe is in vain repeated at that gate,
nor is the weary traveller ever invited to enter it."

"Indeed!" answered I, "and was it always so?"

"Alas!" replied the hind, "the former owner would with his own hand administer
comfort to the meanest creature; with him the poor lost a benefactor the
oppressed a champion, and the vicious a monitor."

"Think me not, Eldred, guilty of vanity, in repeating the words of the poor
fellow; for that, of all passions, is most deserving our contempt -- but let
this teach thee how to act the proper part of man. Reflect, that Being who
places thee in an exalted station, can hurl thee lower than thy dependant; and,
oh! my son, be assured the greatest luxury riches can purchase, is releiving
the b^ting wants of penury, and securing the prayers of our fellow creatures!

"I ventured to discover myself, and his joy at seeing me was extreme, but was
suddenly checked by recollecting where I was.

"My Lord," he cried, "fly this hostile place! should you be known, your life
would answer."

"Hold!" I interrupted, "for my life I care not; know you any tidings of my
son?"

"I know but little," returned the peasant, "'it was here believed you were
assassinated; a short time after, Sir James sent for your son to Edinburgh, and
garrisoned the castle with his own followers, discharging yours. Since the
departure of my young Lord, no Tidings have reached us."

"What could I think? From his inhuman treatment to me, what could I suppose
but you were no more?

"Almost distracted, I knew not what to do. But after a time, imagining I had
by some involuntary crime, drawn down the vengeance of heaven on me and mine;
so I imagined the only method to reconcile the Deity, would be by performing
some action that might appear laudable to him, and nothing seemed more suited
than undertaking a pilgrimage to the Holyland. I therefore provided myself with
a habit for the purpose, and commenced my journey, having sworn the old man
never to divulge his knowledge of my existence, and was accompanied by his good
wishes,

"Long, long and tedious was the way: unprotected from the scorching heat of
the Asiatic sun, I wandered, and having reached the destined spot, performed my
mission. I then traversed the eastern continent, still in Palmer's weeds, and
afterward returned to Europe, most part of which I crossed. At Italy, I met
with some more of my own calling, who proposed making the tour of England. I
accompanied them, and being so near my native country, I was by an involuntary
impulse compelled to visit it. I sought the castle of Wallace, and claimed
entertainment there; I learned from the conversation of the domestics, you had
been reared by your uncle until a short time previous, when you had absconded
with the daughter of Sir James.

"I last night threw aside my disguise, and entered his room: he instantly
remembered my features, but supposing me dead, imagination caused him to
consider me as the spirit of the brother he had so much wronged. I had this
night retired to the closet adjoining his apartment, with an intention to
disclose myself, and seek to soothe him to repentance, when the words I heard
convinced me you were my son; and I will no more complain of the sickle
goddess, since you are restored to me."

Here the Lord Glencairn concluded his narration.

On the following day the cavern was searched; they removed the rubbish and
entered the passage; the noises which had been heard were again repeated. At
length they discovered several cells, and delivered innumerable captives who
had long groaned in confinement, and whose appearance accounted for the
disturbances experienced by Eldred and his father, while in confinement. They
moreover secured the banditti, and resigned them to the rigor of the law. In
short, justice was again practiced, and the whole neighborhood rung with the
names of Eldred and Glencairn.

It is now proper to mention Donald, whom we left a laurelled conqueror at
Roxburgh. Flushed with conquest, and rendered more arbitrary from the fevorable
opinion entertained of him by the queen, he repaired to the Castle; and Jane
still persisting in her refusal of his hand, he resolved by force to make her
his. His confessor, who for the consideration of a little yellow dross,
cleansed his soul, and gave him a absolution, appeared a proper person.
Choosing the dead of night, by force he entered the chamber of his intended
victim, attended by his sacerdotal friend and bade her yield her hand.

The unhappy maid upon her knees, entreated death in preference; conjuring him
by every solemn argument to refrain from his design. But as effecually might
the trembling lamb plead for life to the voracious wolf, as she have softened
Donald's inflexible mind.

"Thy prayers are vain, weak maid," he cried, "I am preparing for thy
happiness. What can thou wish for? If power, my wide domains will give thee
that, accompanied by wealth; if love, behold me now, though with the smooth and
artful tale of hypocrites I cannot plead my passion, yet at thy feet I freely
lay my heart."

"Hold!" exclaimed Jane, "Dissembling villain? too well I see through thy poor
artifice: but here, in the sight of heaven, I swear I will never be thine!"

"Indeed, my saucy dame?" returned the Baron, "we'll try thy boasted
perseverance. Come father, execute your office."

The priest had just begun the ceremony, when they were startled by loud and
reiterated jars against the castle gate. Donald himself appeared careless of
this unexpected intrusion, and again ordered the monk to proceed. He did so,
and the irrevocable ring was about to be placed on the trembling hand of Jane,
when the chamber door was violently burst open, and an armed warrior stood
before the astonished Donald!

"Monster!" said the stranger, "release the lady, and oppose the strength of
one more equal to thee!"

So saying, he immediately assailed the Lord of the Isles: their swords cast
round a dreadful gleam, and victory seemed doubtful; when fortune, turning her
wheel out of its usual track, a thing too rare, favored the juster cause; the
unknown cavalier disarmed his antagonist, who was now entirely in his power.

"Thy life is fairly mine," exclaimed the conqueror, "but let the compassion I
extend to thee, teach thee to practice mercy to thy enemies. Live and repent!"

Jane, who had been an anxious spectator of the combat, was wrapped in silent
gratitude, when the stranger raising his beaver, disovered the face of her
loved Glencairn. The sudden change from deep despair to joy deprived her of all
power, and she sunk insensate into the arms of Eldred.

By this time the Lord Glencairn joined his son; they used their endeavors in
restoring Jane, and at length succeeded; when the latter introduced her to his
father, who received him with a parental affection.

During these transactions, the followers of the two Noblemen entirely
vanquished the retainers of Donald; they searched the castle, and gave liberty
to Edric, who was joyfully received by the young Lord Eldred; and in a dungeon
had found Andrew, but in a very weak condition.

"Here," says one of the officers, "is a prisoner, but he seems to be in so bad
a state, that were he released, he would scarce be able to leave the place."

"You are mistaken," replied the Squire, "were my prison doors now open,
notwithstanding the pain these steel ornaments with which they have honored me,
have caused, I could skip away as nimbly as a flea over a Friar's nose."

They liberated and conducted him to his master; his grotesque appearance
excited a smile on the features of his spectators: his red beard was grown to
an enormous length, and from the dirt which was gathered therein, gave him more
the resemblance to a demon than a human being. Immediately on his entrance, he
cried; "Ah, my Lord, is it possible it is you? Alas? you thought your cares
were all over when last you quitted this infernal dwelling, but you are so
precipitate; recollect an old proverb that I often repeated to you; An ounce of
discretion is worth a pound of wit! By the mass there stands old Pluto, alias
Donald! the last time I saw him he looked as hot as if he had been eating
Tewksbury mustard."

"Silence," replied Eldred, (then presenting his father) "do you know this
person, Andrew?"

"Hey! what! Oh, a ghost! a ghost!"

"No my honest fellow," returned Archibald, "I am no ghost!"

"Huzza! huzza!" cried the overjoyed Squire, "he is alive."

"Andrew," said Clencairn, "for your fidelity to my son, you shall be rewarded.
I will place you -- "

"Not in the army, I hope my Lord," interrupted Andrew, believe me, I shall
make but a pitiful soldier. I have so great an antipathy to steel, that I would
not be tailor to his majesty, merely because I should have been* obliged to
handle a needle."

"Fear not," exclaimed his master, "your post shall be exempt from danger."

"I thank you, my Lord," replied his servant, "that post will just suit me."

They now prepared to depart, and having sentenced the priest to perpetual
imprisonment, and pardoned Donald, (who lived many years a sincere penitent)
they pursued their journey to Aberdeenshire. In the way, Eldred informed Jane
of her father's death, at which she betrayed evident marks of grief: they
however sought to console her by saying, that on her arrival she would meet
with one, who would more than make reparation for her loss.

CHAP. XX.
Vain are all sudden sallies of delight:
Convulsions of a weak, distempered joy.
Joy's a fixed state; a tenure, not a start.
YOUNG.
ON arriving at the castle, Glencairn retired, but soon returned, leading in a
lady, whom he presented to his niece; saying, "behold the mother whose fate you
so regret."

The stranger fell upon her neck, and they mingled their tears of love and
tenderness; while the drop of sympathy more precious than the indian pearl,
sell from the eyes of Eldred and his father, and Jane instantly recognized the
figure she had so often seen at old Maud's.

All now was happiness at the castle, save that the breast of Eldred was
touched with remorse for his ungrateful conduct to the hermit. He could not
bear to suffer in the opinion of so worthy a creature, and instantly dispatched
a messenger in quest of him. His letter said.

"THE person he had so hospitably entertained at his cell was now restored to
happiness, and wished the anchorite to share his joy."

Jane entreated her parent to relate, by what strange means she had been torn
from her, and why she so long took up her abode at the cottage of Maud.

"Alas! my child," replied Matilda, "I have suffered much: my history is
unentertaining, and my misfortunes have been solely created by imperious man.
My father, heaven rest his ashes, first forbade me to love the youth to whom my
heart was so firmly attached, that even now the passion lurks at my breast.
Compelled to marry one who bore me not the least affection, who sought my
alliance to gratify his avarice, who drove me from my native land, and immured
me within the lofty walls of a mouldering convent. Carol was the person he
fixed on to conduct me."

"Villain!" exclaimed Glencairn, "he has escaped too well! On hearing I was
alive, and with my son, in the apartment of his Lord, he fled. Oh! had he
fallen into my power, the most galling cruelties tyranny ever invented had been
his!"

"Happy am I," returned Lady Wallace, "he is not. If the Almighty think fit to
spare him, and grant him leisure for repentance, shall man refuse it?"

"But to resume my tale. He lodged me in the convent, the abbess of which for
some time, treated me with tenderness and affection; at length she hinted a
distant wish that I should take the viel; but finding I would not understand
her, she spoke more plainly, I then peremptorily refused; since when she
endeavored by every rigorous means to compel me, but in vain. I rather would
have fallen a sacrifice at the altar, than offer a divided heart to heaven.

"My life was now become a burden to me, when I recollected an old french
soldier, who daily implored charity at the grate. I resolved on bribing him; I
told him frankly the treatment I had received, and promised him a purse of
gold, if he would assist me in making my escape, and that he would be under the
garden wall in the dusk of the evening. He assured me of his fideliity, vowed
to die in my service, and moreover offered to accompany me till I was assured
of my safety.

"At sun set I equipped myself with a Friar's habit* which he had furnished me
with in the course of the day, and was suffered by the porter to depart without
the least suspicion. My trusty soldier was waiting for me, and we took a long
leave of the convent.

"He procured me a passage in a vessel bound for Scotland, for which place I
embarked, after having rewarded him, and landed safely in my native country. I
instantly repaired to the cottage of Maud, where I have since tarried, and
consoled myself by being near you, my daughter. I am the person who was
introduced to you by the good old woman, on the morning of your elopement: I am
the object who caused your terror at the cavern, by addressing you, and who
have since beheld your cousin Eldred there. He sought to overtake me, but the
mazes and windings of the rocks favored my flight, and I escaped him.

"My reason for these walks was, that as I was fearful of being seen, which I
must have been, had I ventured out by day light, I embraced the hour of
darkness to enjoy the fresh invigorating air. On the rumor of Sir James's
decease, of Eldred succeeding him in the estate, and that my brother lived, I
hastened to the castle. Time had not so much altered the lineaments of a
sister, but that I was known, and received with such unfeigned marks of
affection, that a life of gratitude will scarce repay what I owe."

"No more of that," said Archibald, "our hours of misery, I trust, are past; be
those to come, of joy!"

In a few days Eldred's messenger returned, announcing the arrival of father
Ambrose. The young Lord hurried out from the company to welcome him, and
presently returned leading in the hermit, who no sooner entered the apartment,
than he sunk lifeless upon the floor.

All ran to him, and were busy in reviving him: at last they succeeded in their
endeavors, and on seeing Lady Wallace, he exclaimed, "Gracious heaven! Matilda!"

The well known voice struck conviction to her heart, and notwithstanding the
many years they had been absent from each other, she straightway knew her Alan!
her beloved Alan! whom she supposed to have perished in the Gallic wars.

They renewed their vows of everlasting love. Glencairn welcomed him as the
companion of his youth; while Jane and Eldred stood wrapped in wonder at the
scene.

They all removed to the castle of Glencairn, where, after the tedious interval
of a year from the death of Wallace, Alan Duntrone received the hand of his
widow, and at the same time Eldred was blessed with his lovely Jane.

The antique pile now rung with mirth and festivity. Bonfires blazed; the
mantling juice of the grape swelled on the hospitable board; the pliant fingers
of the bards flew over the strings of the soul-subduing lyre, while their
tongues alternately rehearsed the deeds of wariors, and constancy of maidens.

The castle of Wallace was converted into an alm's house, where age and infancy
met with a sanctuary from the iron gripe of indigence, and of which the
philosopher Andrew was constituted governor.

Edric was maintained as the Squire of Eldred; Duncan, the son of Carrol* as
his steward: Maud enjoyed a considerable pension from the purse of Eldred. In
short, no one who had contributed to his welfare went unrewarded.

Duntrone, with his lady, resided at the mansion of his ancestors; Eldred and
Jane at the castle of Lord Glencairn, who grew old amidst a numerous offspring
of grandchildren.

Thus did this family exhibit a picture to convince the (...), that the road of
Virtue, though (...) craggy and (...), leads ^o a happy goal; while the facile
and flowery path of Vice, (...) ends in a labyrinth of guilty conscience and
despair.
