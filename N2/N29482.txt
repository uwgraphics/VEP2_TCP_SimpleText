Boston 3 d December 1689. AT THE CONVENTION Of the Governor, and Council, and
Representatives of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay.
IT having pleased the God of Heaven to mitigate His many Frowns upon us in the
Summer past, with a mixture of some very signal Favors, and in the midst of
Wrath so far to remember Mercy; That our Indian Enemies have had a Check put
upon their Designs of Blood and Spoil: that others have not seen their Desires
accomplished upon us: And that we have such hopes of our God's adding yet more
perfection to our Deliverances; Inasmuch also, as the great God has of late
raised up such a Defense to the Protestant Religion and Interest abroad in the
World, especially in the happy accession of Their Majesty's our Sovereigns,
KING William and QVEEN Mary to the Throne:

It is therefore Ordered, that Thursday the nineteenth of December instant, be
kept as a Day of Thanksgiving throughout this Colony; And all Servile Labor on
said Day is hereby inhibited. And the several Ministers and Assemblies are
Exhorted to Observe the same by Celebrating the just Praises of Almighty God,
of whose tender Mercies it is that we are not consumed.

By Order of the CONVENTION, Isaac Addington Secr'.
