MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES, TRANSMITTING AN ORIGINAL
LETTER FROM MRS. WASHINGTON, In answer to a Letter from him, WRITTEN IN
PURSUANCE OF THE RESOLUTION OF CONGRESS, REQUESTING HER ASSENT TO THE INTERMENT
OF THE REMAINS OF GENERAL WASHINGTON IN THE CAPITOL, AT THE CITY OF WASHINGTON.

8th January, 1800.

Referred to the joint Committee appointed to prepare and report measures
expressive of the profound sorrow with which Congress is penetrated on the
death of General George Washington.

[ Published by order of the House of Representatives]

MESSAGE.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,
IN compliance with the request in one of the resolutions of Congress, of the
21st of December last, I transmitted a copy of those resolutions by my
Secretary, Mr. Shaw, to Mrs. Washington, assuring her of the profound respect
Congress will ever bear to her person and character -- of their condolence in
the late afflicting dispensation of Providence, and entreating her assent to
the interment of the remains of General GEORGE WASHINGTON, in the manner
expressed in the first resolution. As the sentiments of that virtuous lady, not
less beloved by this nation than she is at present greatly afflicted, can never
be so well expressed as in her own words, I transmit to Congress her original
letter.

It would be an attempt of too much delicacy, to make any comments upon it;
but, there can be no doubt, that the nation at large, as well as all the
branches of the government, will be highly gratified by any arrangement which
may diminish the sacrifice she makes of her individual feelings.

JOHN ADAMS.
UNITED STATES, January 6th, 1800.
MOUNT-VERNON, December 31st, 1799. SIR,
WHILE I feel with keenest anguish the late dispensation of Divine Providence,
I cannot be insensible to the mournful tributes of respect and veneration,
which are paid to the memory of my dear deceased husband; and, as his best
services, and most anxious wishes were always devoted to the welfare and
happiness of his country, to know that they were truly appreciated and
gratefully remembered, affords no inconsiderable consolation.

Taught by the great example which I have so long had before me, never to
oppose my private wishes to the public will, I must consent to the request made
by Congress, which you have had the goodness to transmit to me; and, in doing
this I need not, I cannot say, what a sacrifice of individual feeling I make to
a sense of public duty.

With grateful acknowledgments, and unfeigned thanks for the personal respect,
and evidences of condolence expressed by Congress, and yourself,

I remain very respectfully, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, MARTHA
WASHINGTON.
