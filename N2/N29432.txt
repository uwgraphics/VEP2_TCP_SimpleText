AT A General Court held at Boston, February the 21st. 1675.
UPon the serious Consideration of that Cloud of the Lords Anger wherewith he
has covered this Land, in the lengthening out of War, which is one of the
sorest of Gods Judgments, witholding in a great measure his blessing and
success upon Counsels and endeavors for the recovery of our peace, whence very
great Devastations in sundry parts of the Country has ensued, and more
Calamity is threatened, and that righteously for our aggravated Sins whereby the
Lord our God has been provoked, which sins have been expressed in several
former Orders for days of Fasting and Prayer that have been published; yet
these sins have not been turned from, but we are rather in the time of our
distress trespassing yet more against him: Spiritual Judgments are prevailing,
hardness of heart upon very many, great Security, Oppression, Luxury, and the
Pride of this Land testifying against us to our very faces, Exacerbation of
spirit (as in Massah and Meribah) breaking forth in stead of that Humiliation
that should appear in such a day of the Lords rebuke upon us, our refusing to
hear and obey the voice of the Lord in the mouth of his Servants whom he has
sent to preach in his Name: whence the Lord has denied to hear our
supplications, and seemed to shut out our prayer when we have cried to him, and
to threaten us for our worldliness to drive us out of our worldly possessions,
and for leaving our first love to remove the very Candlesticks out of their
place except we repent, and for our sinful heathenizing, to deliver us into
the hand of the barberous Heathen round about us, and so to clear up the
righteousness of his Judgments before all the world; (if by what he has
already done so dreadfully, and his threatening of further Judgments we will not
fear him, nor receive instruction, nor be reformed) in demonstrating that (in
case we be ruined) it is we that lay this pleasant land desolate,

This Court does appoint the second day of March next to be kept to a day of
solemn Humiliation, Fasting and Prayer by all the Inhabitants of this
Jurisdiction, respecting all ranks and orders amongst us both in Church and
Commonwealth, who are hereby earnestly exhorted to make humble confession of
their sins, thoroughly to amend their ways and turn to the Lord with their
whole hearts, that so the Lord may be entreated for us, and for his Name sake
turned away from the fierceness of his great anger, and that yet at length he
may be pleased to go forth with, and give success to such forces as are or may
be sent forth as a means under him for the suppression of the Enemy: And it is
hereby ordered that such as cannot have seasonable notice hereof shall and are
hereby enjoined to keep the fifth day of the next following Week in stead of
the day abovenamed,

Edward Rawson Secr'.
