PREFACE.
DR. Johnson has observed concerning devotional poetry, that "the sanctity of
the matter rejects the ornaments of figurative diction." Inferior subjects may
be heightened by the charms of rhetoric, but this is too sublime to receive any
decoration, from human eloquence; and we often debase it by making the attempt.

Dr. WATTS in one of his hymns has said, "Join all the names of love and power
That ever men or angels bore;
All are too mean to speak his worth,
Or set Emanuel's glory forth."


Yet, such was the imperfection of one of the best of men, that we frequently
find in his divine poems, epithets and allusions taken from "mortal be^^ties,"
and applied to the Savior, with a licen^e disgusting to the spirit of
devotion. It has been my aim to avoid these familiarites: and either to change
or omit such epithets and allusions.

The names of the authors from (...) this selection is made, are subjoined to
each psalm or hymn; excepting when they a^^ ^nknown or have requested
concealment. Must (...) these names are familiar to the readers of poetry; but
there is one, to whom I am largely indebted for some of the most elegant of
these productions, who as but little known in this country and of whom I
conceive the following account will be acceptable to every reader.

" ANNE STEEL was the eldest daughter of a dissenting minister at Broughton,
in Hamps^ire; a man of piety, integrity, benevolence, and the most amiable
simplicity of manners. She discovered in early life, her love of the mus^, and
often entertained her friends, with the truly poetical and pious productions of
her pen. But (...) h^^ in felicity, as it has been of many of her kindred
spirits, to have a capacious soaring mind, enclosed in a very weak and languad
body. She lived for the most part, a life of retirement in the same peaceful
village where she began and ended her days. The duties of friendship and
religion occupied her time; and the pleasures of both constituted her delight.
Her heart was apt to feel, often to a degree too painful for her own felicity;
but always with the most tender and generous sympathy for her friends. Yet she
possessed a native cheerfulness; of which, even the agonizing pains she
endured, in the latter part of her life, could not deprive her. In every short
interval of abated suffering, she would in a variety of ways, as well as by her
enlivening conversation, give pleasure to all around her. Her life was a life
of unaffected humility, warm benevolence, sincere friendship and genuine
devotion. She waited with christian dignity for the hour of her departure: When
it came, she welcomed its approach; and, having taken an affectionate leave of
her friends, closed her eyes, with these animating words on her lips, "I know
that my redeemer lives." This account is taken from the preface to the third
volume of her "miscellaneous pieces in prose and verse," published under the
name of THEODOSIA, by the Rev. Caleh Evans of Bristol, 1780, after her decease,


It is humbly apprehended, that a grateful and affectionate address to the
exalted Savior of mankind, or a hymn in honor of the Eternal Spirit, cannot
be disagreeable to the mind of GOD. To stigmatize such an act of devotion with
the name of idolatry, is (to say the least) an abuse of language. It cannot be
justly charged with derogating from the glory due to the ONE God and Father of
all, because he is the ultimate object of the honor which is given to his Son
and to his Spirit.

In this selection those christians, who do not scruple to sing praises to
their Redeemer and Sanctifier, will find materials for such a sublime
enjoyments whilst others whose tenderness of conscience may oblige them to
confine their addresses, to the Father only will find no deficiency of matter
suited to their idea of "the chaste and awful spirit of devotion."

PSALMS.
Psalm I. Common Meter. The Happiness of the Righteous and the Misery of the
Wicked.
BLESSED is the man who shuns the place,
Where sinners love to meet;
Who fears to tread their wicked ways,
And hates the scoffer's seat.
2
But in the statutes of the Lord
Has placed his chief delight;
By day he reads or hears the word,
And meditates by night.
3
He like a tree of generous kind
By living waters set;
Safe from the storm and blasting wind,
Enjoys a peaceful state.
4
Green as the leaf and ever fair
Shall his profession shine;
Whilst fruits of holiness appear
Like clusters on the vine.
5
Not so the impious and unjust,
What vain designs they form!
Their hopes are blown away like dust,
Or chaff before the storm.
6
Sinners in judgment shall not stand
Among the sons of grace;
When Christ the Judge at his right hand
Appoints his saints a place.
7
His eye beholds the path they tread,
His heart approves it well;
But crooked ways of sinners lead,
Down to the gates of hell.
WATTS.
Psalm II. Common Meter. The Exaltation of Christ.
ATTEND, O earth, when God declares
His uncontrolled decree;
"Thou art my Son, this day, my heir
"Have I begotten thee.
2
"Upon my holy Zion's hill
"My King I thee ordain;
"And though thy foes dispute my will
"Thou shall forever reign*
3
"Ask and and receive thy full demands,
"Thine shall the heathen be;
"The utmost limits of the lands
"Shall be possessed by thee.
4
"Thy righteous scepter thou shall sway
"And all thy foes command;
"Just as the potter breaks the clay
"And moulds it with his hand."
5
Be wise, ye princes, then, give ear,
Ye judges of the Earth;
Worship the Lord with holy fear,
Rejoice with awful mirth.
6
Approach the Son, with due respect,
To him your homage pay;
Lest ye persist in your neglect,
And perish in your way.
7
If but in part his anger rise
Who can endure the flame?
Then blessed are they whose hope relies
On his most holy Name.
TATE, varied.
Psalm II. Short Meter. The Death, Resurrection and glory of Christ.
MAKER, and sovereign Lord
Of Heaven and Earth and Seas,
Thy Providence confirms thy word
And answers thy decrees.
2
The things so long foretold
By David are fulfilled;
When Jews and Gentiles joined to say
Jesus thy holy child,
3
Why did the Gentiles rage,
And Jews with one accord,
Unite their counsels to destroy
The anointed of the Lord?
4
Rulers and Kings agree
To form a vain design,
Against the Lord they join their powers,
Against his Christ combine.
5
The Lord derides their rage
And will support his throne,
He who has raised him from the dead
Has owned him for his Son.
6
He asks and God bestows
A vast inheritance;
Far as the earth's remotest ends
His Kingdom shall advance.
WATTS.
Psalm III. Common Meter. Doubts and Fears suppressed.
MY God how many are my fears!
How fast my foes increase!
Their number how it multiplies!
How fatal to my peace!
2
The lying temtper would persuade
There Is no relief from heaven;
And all my swelling sins appear
Too great to be forgiven*
3
But thou, O Lord, art my defense,
On thee my hopes rely;
My sinking spirit thou will raise
And lift my head on high.
4
In former times of deep distress
To God I made my prayer,
He heard me from his holy bill;
Why should I now despair?
5
Guarded by him I lay me down
My sweet repose to take;
For I through him securely sleep
Through him, in safety wake.
6
Salvation to the Lord belongs
His arm alone can save;
Blessings attend thy people here
And reach beyond the grave.

Psalm IV. ver. 6, 7. Common Met. True happiness only in God.
WHEN fancy spreads her boldest wings
And wanders unconfined,
Amidst the varied scene of things
Which entertain the mind;
2
In vain we trace creation over
In search of sacred rest,
The whole creation is too poor
To make us fully blessed.
3
In vain would this low world employ
Each flattering specious wile*
For what can yield a real joy
But our Creator's smile*
4
Let earth with all her charms depart,
Unworthy of the mind;
In God alone, our restless heart
An equal bliss can find.
5
Great source of all felicity,
To thee our wishes tend!
Do not these wishes rise from thee
And in thy favor end?
6
Thy favor, Lord, is all we want
Here would our spirit rest
O seal the rich, the boundless grant,
And make us fully blessed.
Mrs. STEEL.
Psalm IV. ver. 8. Long Meter. An Evening Song.
THUS far the Lord has led me on*
Thus far his power prolongs my days,
And every Evening shall make known
Some fresh memorial of his grace,
2
Much of my time has run to waste
And I perhaps am near my home;
But he forgives my follies past,
And gives me strength for days to come.
3
I lay my body down to sleep
Peace is the pillow for my head;
His ever watchful eye shall keep
Its constant guard around my bed.
4
Faith in his name forbids my fear,
O may thy presence never depart;
And in the morning let me hear
The love and kindness of thy heart.
5
Thus when the night of death shall come,
My flesh shall rest beneath the ground;
And wait thy voice to break the tomb
With glad salvation in the sound.
WATTS.
Psalm V. Common Meter. For the Lord's Day morning,
LORD, in the morning, thou shall hear
My voice ascending high,
To thee will I address my prayer
To thee direct mine eye.
2
Thou art a God before whose sight,
The wicked shall not stand;
Sinners shall never be thy delight,
Nor dwell at thy right hand.
3
But to thy house will I resort
To taste thy mercies there;
I will frequent thy holy court
And worship in thy fear.
4
O may thy spirit guide my feet,
In ways of truth and grace;
Make every path of duty straight
And plain before my face.
5
The men who love and fear thy name
Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
The mighty God will compass them
With favor as a shield.
WATTS.
Psalm VI. Common Meter. Prayer in Sickness.
IN anger, Lord, rebuke me not
But spare a wretch ^^^orn;
Correct me not in thy fierce wrath,
Too heavy to be borne.
2
Sorrow and pain consume the day,
I waste the night with cries,
Counting the minutes as they pass,
Till the flow morning rise.
3
My tortured flesh distracts my mind
And fills my soul with grief;
How long, O Lord, will thou delay
To grant me thy relief?
4
The gloomy shades of death cannot
Thy glorious acts proclaim;
No prisoner of the silent grave
Can magnify thy name.
5
He hears when dust and ashes pray
He pities all my groans;
He saves me for his mercy's sake,
And heal^ my broken bones.
6
The virtue of his sovereign word
Restores my fainting breath,
To him will I devote that life
Which he has saved from death.
TATE and WATTS, united and varied.
Psalm VII. Common Meter. Confidence in God.
MY trust is in my heavenly friend,
My hope in thee, my God;
Rise and my helpless life defend
From those who seek my blood.
2
If malice lurked within my heart
Before thy piercing eyes;
I should not dare appeal to thee
Nor ask my God to rise.
3
Impartial judge of all the world,
I trust my cause to thee;
According to my righteousness
So let thy sentence be.
4
Let wicked arts of wicked men
Be wholly overthrown;
But guard the just, O God, to whom
The hearts of both are known.
5
Then will I all the righteous ways
Of Providence proclaim;
I Will sing the praise of God most high
And celebrate his name.

Psalm VIII. Common Meter. Divine Condescension.
O THOU to whom all creatures bow
Within this earthly frame;
Through all the world, how great art thou!
How glorious is thy Name!
2
When Heaven thy glorious work on high
Employs my wondering sight;
The moon that nightly rules the sky
With stars of feebler light;
3
Lord, what is man! that thou should choose
To keep him in thy mind!
Or what his race, that thou should prove
To them so wondrous kind!
4
Him next in power thou did create
To thy celestial train;
Ordained with dignity and state
Over all thy works to reign.
5
They jointly own his powerful sway
The beasts that prey or graze;
The bird that wings its airy way,
The fish that cuts the seas.
6
O thou to whom all creatures bow,
Within this earthly frame,
Through all the world, how great art thou,
How glorious is thy name!
TATE.
Psalm VIII. Long Meter. Adam and Christ, or the old and new Creation.
LORD what was man when made at first,
Adam, the offspring of the dust,
That thou should set him and his race,
But just below an angel's place!
2
That thou should raise his nature so,
And make him Lord of all below;
Make every beast and bird submit
And lay the fishes at his feet!
3
But what sublimer glories wait,
To crown the second Adam's state!
What honors shall thy Son adorn
Who condescended to be born!
4
See him, below his angels made!
See him in dust, among the dead!
To save the world from death and sin,
But he shall reign with power divine.
5
The world to come redeemed from all
The miseries that attend the fall.
New made and glorious shall submit
At our exalted Savior's feet.
WATTS.
Psalm IX. ver. 10, 11. Long Meter. Encouragement to Faith.
SING to the Lord, who loud proclaims
His various and his saving names.
O may they not be heard alone,
But by our sure experience known.
2
The great Jehovah be adored,
The eternal, all sufficient Lord;
Through all the world, most high confessed,
By him 'twas formed, and is possessed.
3
Awake, our noblest powers, to bless
The God of Abr'ham, God of peace;
Now, by a dearer title known,
Father and God of Christ his Son.
4
Through every age his gracious ear
Is open to his servants' prayer;
Nor can one humble soul complain.
That he has sought his God in vain.
5
What unbelieving heart shall dare,
In whispers to suggest a fear,
While still he owns his ancient name,
The same his power, his love the same.
6
To thee, our souls in faith arise,
To thee we lift expecting eyes,
And boldly through the desert tread,
For God will guard, where God shall lead.
DODDRIDGE.
Psalm X. Common Meter. A prayer for Deliverance from Oppression.
WHY does the Lord stand off so far,
And why conceal his face,
When great calamities appear,
And times of deep distress?
2
Lord, shall the wicked still deride,
Thy justice and thy power?
Shall they erect their heads in pride
And better men devour?
3
Arise, O God, lift up thy hand,
Attend our humble cry;
No enemy shall dare to stand
When God our help is nigh.
4
Thou will prepare our hearts to pray.
And still incline thine ear;
Thou know what thy children say
And thou their voice wilt hear.
5
Proud tyrants shall no more oppress,
No more despise the just:
And mighty sinners shall confess
They are but earth and dust.
WATTS.
Psalm XI. Long Meter. The justice of Divine Providence.
ON God my steadfast hopes rely,
Why do my foes insulting cry,
"Fly like a timorous, trembling dove,
"And seek the mountain's lonesome grove."
2
Behold the wicked aim their darts,
Against the men of upright hearts!
If Government be overthrown,
Who then the injured cause will own?
3
The Lord, enthroned above the sky.
On suffering virtue casts his eye;
Though he afflict his saints to prove,
Their patience, and to try their love;
4
Yet lawless hands and hearts impure,
His frowns vindictive will endure;
His lightning wings its rapid way,
His thunder fills them with dismay.
5
Where truth and justice hold their place
God will reveal his gracious face:
Delighted, in the upright mind
His own reflected beams to find.
MERRICK, varied.
Psalm XII. Common Meter. Corruption of Manners.
HELP Lord! for men of virtue ^ail,
Religion loses ground;
The sons of wickedness prevail
And treacheries abound.
2
Their oaths and promises they break
Yet act the flatterer's part;
With fair deceitful lips they speak
And with a double heart.
3
Scoffers appear on every side,
Where a vile race of men
Are raised to seats of power and pride,
And bear the sword in vain.
4
Lord, when iniquities abound,
And blasphemy grows bold;
When faith is hardly to be found,
And love is waxen cold;
5
Is not thy chariot hastening on?
Have thou not given the sign?
May we not trust and live upon
A promise so divine?
6
Thy word like silver seven times tried,
Through ages shall endure;
The men who in thy truth confide
Shall find the promise sure.
WATTS.
Psalm XIII. Common Meter. Complaint under Temptation.
HOW long will thou conceal thy face
My God, how long delay?
When will thou send thy heavenly rays
To drive my fears away?
2
How long shall my distressed soul
Struggle and toil in vain?
Thy word can all my foes control
And ease my raging pain.
3
Be thou my sun, and thou my shield,
My soul in safety keep;
Make haste, before my eyes are sealed
In death's eternal sleep.
4
How would the tempter boast aloud
If I become his prey,
And all the hosts of hell grow proud
At thy so long delay!
5
But ^hey shall fly at thy rebuke
And Satan hide his head;
He knows the terrors of thy look
And hears thy voice with dread.
6
Thou will display that sovereign grace
On which my hopes have hung;
I shall employ my lips in praise
And victory shall be sung.
WATTS.
Psalm XIV. Common Meter. Universal Depravity.
FOOLS in their hearts believe and say
"That all religion's vain:
"There is no God that reigns on high
"Or minds the affairs of men."
2
From thoughts so dreadful and profane
Corrupt discourse proceeds;
And by their impious hands are done
Abominable deeds.
3
The Lord from his celestial throne,
Looked down on things below;
To find the men that sought his grace
Or did his justice know;
4
He saw that all were gone astray,
Their practice all the same;
That none did fear his maker's hand,
That none did love his name.
5
Their tongues are used to speak deceit,
Their slanders never cease,
How swift to mischief are their feet
Nor know the paths of peace!
6
Such seeds of sin, that bitter root
In every heart are found;
Nor will they bear diviner fruit
Till grace refine the ground.
WATTS.
Psalm XV. Common Meter. The Citizen of Zion.
LORD who is the happy man that may
To thy blessed courts repair?
And whilst he bows before thy throne
Shall find acceptance there?
2
It Is he, whose truly honest heart
By rules of virtue moves;
Whose generous tongue disdains to speak
The thing his heart disproves.
3
Who never will a slander forge
His neighbor's fame to wound,
Nor hearken to a false report
By malice whispered round,
4
Who vice, when dressed in pomp and power,
Can treat with just neglect;
And piety, though clothed in rags
Religiously respect.
5
Who to his plighted vows and trust
Has ever firmly stood;
And though he promise to his loss,
He makes his promise good.
6
Who seeks not in oppressive ways
His treasure to employ;
Whom no rewards can ever bribe
The guiltless to destroy,
7
The man, who by this steady course
Has happiness insur'd,
When Earth's foundations shake, shall stand,
By Providence secured.
TATE.
Psalm XV. Long Meter. The virtues of a Christian.
WHO shall ascend thy heavenly place
Great God, and dwell before thy face?
The man who loves religion now,
And humbly walks with God below.
2
Whose hands are pure, whose heart is clean,
Whose lips still speak the thing they mean;
No slanders dwell upon his tongue,
He hates to do his neighbor wrong.
3
He will not trust an ill report,
Nor vent it to his neighbor's hurt;
Sinners of state he can despise,
But saints are honored in his eyes.
4
Firm to his word, he ever stood,
And always makes his promise good;
Nor will he change the thing he swears
Whatever pain or loss he bears.
5
He never deals in bribing gold,
And mourns that justice should be sold;
If others vex and grind the poor,
Sweet charity attends his door.
6
He loves his enemies and prays
For those who curse him to his face;
And does to all men still the same.
That he could hope or wish from them.
7
Y^^ when his ho^^est works are done,
His soul depends on grace alone:
This is the man thy face shall see
And dwell forever, Lord, with thee.

Psalm XVI. First Part. Long Meter. Good works profitable to men.
PRESERVE me Lord, in time of need
For succor to thy throne I flee;
But have no merit there to plead,
My goodness cannot reach to thee.
2
Often have my heart and tongue confessed
How empty and how poor I am;
My praise can never make thee blessed,
Nor add new glory to thy name.
3
Yet, Lord, thy saints on earth may reap
Some profit by the good I do;
These are the company I keep,
These are the choicest friends I know.
4
Let others choose the sons of mirth
To give a relish to their wine;
I love the men of heavenly birth
Whose works and language are divine.

Psalm XVI. Second Part. Common Met. The blessings of Nature and Grace.
LET Heathens to their idols haste
And worship wood or stone,
But my delightful lot is cast
Where the true God is known.

In this enlightened, pleasant land,
My happy portion lies;
Where nature's ever bounteous hand
All human want supplies.
3
Therefore my soul shall bless the Lord,
Whose precepts give me light,
And consolation still afford
In sorrows dismal night.
4
I strive each action to approve
To thine all-seeing eye;
No danger shall my hope remove,
For thou art ever nigh.

Which to thy presence lead;
Where pleasures dwell without allay,

Where souls departed are;
Nor quit my body to the grave,
To see corruption there.
3
"Thou will reveal the path of life
And raise me to thy throne;
Thy courts immortal pleasure give,
Thy presence, joys unknown."
4
Thus in the name of Christ the Lord,
The holy David sung;
And Providence fulfils the word
Of his prophetic tongue.

Jesus, whom every saint adores,
Was crucified and slain;
Behold the tomb its prey restores,
Behold he lives again.

Psalm XVII. Common Meter. The transforming vision of God.
MY God the visits of thy face
Afford superior joy,
To all the flattering world can give
Or mortal hopes employ.
2
But clouds and darkness intervene,
My brightest joys decline;
And earth's gay trifles often ensnare
This wandering heart of mine.
3
Lord, guide this wandering heart to thee,
Unsatisfied I stray;
Break through the shades of sense and sin
With thy enlivening ray.
4
O let thy beams resplendent shine
And every cloud remove;
Transform my powers and fit my soul
For happier scenes above.
5
Lord raise my faith, my hope, my heart,
To those transporting joys;
Then shall I scorn each little snare,
Which this vain world employs.
6
Then, though I sink in death's cold sleep,
To life I shall awake;
And in the likeness of my God,
Of heavenly bliss partake.

Psalm XVII. Long Meter. The Resurrection.
WHAT sinners value I resign,
Lord it is enough that thou art mine;

But the bright world to which I go,
Has joys substantial and sincere;
When shall I wake and find me there*
3
O glorious hour, O blessed abode!
I shall be near and like my God,
And flesh and sense no more controu^

Till the last trumpet's joyful sound;
Then burst the chains with glad surprise
And in my Savior's image rise.

A fortress and defense to me.
2
Thou my deliverer art, my God,
My trust is in thy mighty power;
Thou art my shield from foes abroad,
At home, my safeguard and my tower.
3
To heaven I made my mournful prayer,
To God addressed my humble cry;
Who graciously inclined his ear,
And heard me from his throne on high.
4
The Lord did on my side engage,
From heaven, my righteous cause upheld;
And saved me from the furious rage
Of threatening waves that proudly swelled.
5
Thou to the just shall justice show
The pure, thy purity shall see;
Such as perversely choose to go
Shall meet with due returns from thee.

But God, on whom my hopes depend?
Or who except the mighty Lord
Can with resistless power defend?

Psalm XVIII. Second Part. Long Met. God executing judgment on his Enemies.
INCUMBENT on the bending sky,
The Lord descended from on high;
And bade the darkness of the pole
Beneath his feet tremendous roll.

Thick woven clouds around him closed
His secret residence composed;
And waters, high suspended spread,
Their dark pavilion over his head.
3
His voice the Almighty Monarch reared,
Though heaven's high vault in thunder heard*
And down in fiercer conflict came
Tremendous hail and mingled flame.
4
With aim direct* his shafts were sped,
In vain his foes before them fled;
Around, his dreadful lightenings stray
And sure destruction marks their way.
5
Earth's basis, open to the eye
And ocean'^ ^prings were seen to lie;
As his vindictive fury past
And over them raged the dreadful blast.

Psalm XVIII. Third Part. Long Met. Sincerity proved or the equity of
Providence.
LORD thou have seen my soul sincere
Have made thy truth and love appear;

Since I have learned thy holy ways
My actions have proclaimed thy praise;
Or if my feet did ever depart,
'Twas never with a wicked heart.
3
What sore temptations broke my rest!
What wars and strugglings in my breast!
But through thy grace that reigns within,
I hope to conquer every sin.
4
With an impartial hand, the Lord
Deals out to mortals their reward;
The kind and faithful souls shall find,
A God more faithful and more kind.

The just and pure shall ever say
God is more pure and just than they;
And men that love revenge shall know
God has an arm of vengeance too.

It Is by thine aid, our troops prevail
And break united powers,
By thee their lofty walls we scale,
Or burn their proudest towers.
3
God speaks and at his fierce rebuke
Whole armies are dismayed;
His voice, his frown, his angry look
Strike all their courage dead.
4
He forms our soldiers for the field
With all their martial skill;
Instructs their hand the sword to wield
And gives them hearts of steel.

His name be ever blessed;

Divine instruction springs.

Above the spreading skies extends.

Unfathomed depths thy judgments are;
Thy providence the world sustains,

With what assurance should the just,
Thy sheltering wings their refuge make,
And saints to thy protection trust.

Such guests shall to thy courts be led,
To banquet on thy love's repast;
And drink, as from the fountain head,
Of joys that shall for ever last.

To upright hearts thy truth display;
With thee, the springs of life remain,
Thy presence is eternal day.

True pleasure runs through all his ways,
And peaceful is his end.

His Father's honor touched his heart,
He pitied sinners cries;

LORD let our humble cry
Before thy throne ascend;
Behold us with compassion's eye,
And still our lives defend.

For foes a numerous band
Against our lives conspire;
They aim destruction through the land,
And spread the raging fire.

Beneath the silent shade,
Their secret plots they lay,
Our peaceful towns by night invade
And waste the fields by day.
4
And will the God of grace,
Regardless of our pain,
Permit secure that bloody race
To riot over the slain?
5
In vain their secret guile
Or open force they prove;
Thine eye can pierce the deepest veil,
Thy hand their force remove.

Deliver us from death,
Send our invaders home;
Or drive them with thy powerful breath
Through distant wilds to roam.

Proclaim our guardian God;
In thy salvation we'll rejoice,
And sound thy praise abroad.

Even in a desert land.

Struck by thy power, the flinty rocks
In gushing torrents flow;
The feathered wanderers of the air,

Descends celestial bread;

Are numerous armies fed.

Supported thus, thine Israel marched,
The promised land to gain;
And shall thy children now begin
To seek their God in vain?

Are all thy stores exhausted now?
Or does thy mercy fail?

And anxious care prevail?

And wide disperse in air;

Slaughtered on fields, with crimson died;

But now, O Lord, look down and see*
Thy mourning vine, thy lovely tree!

Implores thy sovreign power to save,
From dark despair and gloomy death,
2
Thy wrath lies heavy on my soul,
And waves of sorrow over me roll,
Whilst dust and silence spread the gloom;
My friends, beloved in happier days,
The dear companions of my ways,
Descend around me to the tomb.

As lost in lonely grief I tread
The silent mansions of the dead,
Or to some thronged assembly go;
Through all alike, I rove alone,
Forgotten here, and there unknown,
The change renews my piercing woe.

Will thou neglect my mournful call?
Or who shall profit by my fall?
When life departs and love expires;
Can dust and darkness praise the Lord,
Or wake and brighten at his word,
To join the high angelic choirs?
5
My friends are gone, my comforts fled,
The sad remembrance of the dead
Recals my wandering thoughts to mourn;
But through each melancholy day,
I call on thee and still will pray,
Imploring still thy kind return.

Come kneel before his face;

Psalm XCV. First Part. Long Met. Public worship.
O COME loud anthems let us sing,
Loud thanks to our almighty king;
For we our voices high should raise,
When our salvation's rock we praise.

Into his presence let us haste,
To thank him for his favors past;
To him address, in joyful songs,
The praise that to his name belongs.
3
For God, the Lord, enthroned in state,
Is with unrivaled glory great;
A king superior far to all,
Whom by the title Gods, we call.

The depths of earth are in his hand,
Her secret wealth at his command;
The strength of hills that threat the skies
Subjected to his empire lies.

The rolling Ocean's vast ^hyss
By the same sovereign ^ights is his;

Down on our knees devoutly all
Before the Lord our maker fall.

The counsels of his love obey;
Nor let our hardened hearts provoke
Like Israel the avenging stroke.

Yet tempt their M^ke^ to his face;

Forget my power, abuse my love!
Since they despise my rest; I swear,
Their feet shall never enter there."

And march to Zion's heavenly gates;
Believe and take the promised rest,
Obey and be forever blessed.

His temple how divinely fair!

Let ocean lift its roaring voice,
Proclaiming loud "Jehovah reigns;"
For joy let fertile valleys sing,
And tuneful groves their tribute bring*
To him whose power the word sustains.

When earth shall own, his sovereign power
And barbarous nations fear his name;
Then shall the universe confess,

His acts it frequent lays;

Over swelling waves their trade pursue;

And in the deep, his wonders view.

The lowering storm begins to rise;

Upon the lofty waves appear;
Then down the deep abyss are driven,

Like men with fumes of wine oppressed;

Which way to steer* what course is best.

He kindly, condescends to hear,
And frees them from their deep distress.

And lays the bi^lows calm and still;
Then summons forth the gentle breeze,
The seaman's wishes to fulfill.

Would God for all his goodness praise;
And for the mighty works which he
Throughout the wondering world displays.

Enthroned above the sky;

Till thou remove thy rod,

And thy delays of mercy give,
Fresh courage to their pride.

In thy compassion lies;

Psalm CXXIV. Long Meter. Deliverance from Enemies.
HAD not the Lord, may Israel say.
Had not the Lord maintained our side,
When men to make our lives a prey,
Rose like the swelling of the tide;

The swelling tide had stopped our breath,
So fiercely did the billows roll;
We had been swallowed deep in death,
The waters had overwhelmed our soul.

We leap for joy, we shout and sing,
Who just escaped the fatal stroke;
So flies the bird with lively wing,
When once the fowler's snare is broke.

Forever blessed be the Lord,
Who broke the fowler's deadly snare
Who saved us from the threatening sword,
And made our lives his watchful care.

Who formed the earth and built the skies;
Who still upholds all nature's frame.
And guards his Church with wakeful eyes.

Psalm CXXIX. Long Meter. (A new version.) The Counsels of Enemies disappointed.
HOW often have our restless foes
Their arts employed to vex our land!
But God did kindly interpose,
His power has made our feet to stand.
2
By subtle wiles as dark as night,
Their malice lay a while concealed;
But soon the mischief sprang to light,
And all their projects stood revealed,
3
With pride and power and lifted hand,
They dealt their vengeful blows around;
Our backs were like the furrowed land,
When ploughmen break the stubborn ground.
4
But secret arts and open force
Have never moved our steadfast feet;
His justice still maintains its course,
And he will all their plots defeat.
5
Like withered grass, their hopes shall fade,
Nor God nor man their counsels bless;
No friendly hand shall lend them aid,
No tongue shall wish them good success.
Psalm CXXX. Common. Meter. Repentance and pardon.
LORD, should thou call us to thy bar,
Should thine impartial hand
Avenge our sins against thy law,

Hope dawns amidst our fears;
Divine forgiveness large and free
Shall wipe our flowing tears.

On thee alone our souls would wait,
And in thy word would stay;
Thy promises can light create
And turn our night to day.

Just as the guards that keep the night
Long for the morning skies,
Watch the first beams of breaking light
And meet them with their eyes.

So wait our souls to see thy grace,

Meet the first openings of thy face,
And find a brighter day.

Let contrite sinners, on the Lord,
With humble hope recline;
Justice and mercy, in his word,
Harmoniously combine.

FROM deep distress and troubled thoughts
To thee, my God, I raise my cry
If thou severely mark our faults,
What flesh could stand before thine eye.

But thou have set thy throne of grace
Free to dispense thy pardons there;
That sinners may approach thy face,
And hope and love as well as fear.

As the benighted pilgrims wait,
And long and wish for breaking day;
So waits my soul before thy gate,
When will my God his face display?

Nor shall I trust thy word in vain;
Let mourning souls address the Lord,
And find relief from all their pain.

And pardons what our hands have done.

Feed me with necessary food,
I ask not wealth or fame;

Without remorse or care:

Incessantly prepare.

Psalm CXLV. 1st. Part. Com. Met. The divine perfections and providence.
THEE will I bless, my God and king,
Thy endless praise proclaim;
This tribute daily will I bring,
And ever bless thy name.
2
Thou, Lord, art infinitely great,
And highly to be praised;
Thy majesty, with boundless height
Above our knowledge raised,
3
Renowned for mighty acts, thy same,
To future time extends;
From age to age, thy glorious name,
Successively descends.
4
The fathers to the listening youth.
Shall teach thy wondrous ways;
Ages to come proclaim thy truth,
And nations sound thy praise.
5
Thy glorious deeds of ancient date,
Shall through the world be known;
Thine arm of power, thy heavenly state
With public splendour shown.
6
The world is governed by thy hands,
Thy saints are ruled by love;
And thine eternal kingdom stands,
Though rocks and hills remove.
TATE and WATTS.
Psalm CXLV. 2d. Part. Com. Met. Divine Goodness:
GREAT is the Lord! our souls adore,
We wonder while we praise;
His power what creature can explore,
Or equal honors raise?
2
Thy name shall dwell upon my tongue,
While suns shall set and rise;
And tune my everlasting song
In realms beyond the skies.
3
Thy praise shall be my constant theme,
The wonders of thy power;
I Will speak the honors of thy name,
And bid the world adore.
4
But sweetly flowing strains shall tell:
The riches of thy grace;
And songs of grateful joy reveal
Thy spotless righteousness.
5
How large thy tender mercies are!
How wide thy grace extends!
On thy beneficence and care,
The universe depends.
6
To thee, O Lord, for daily meat,
Thy creatures lift their eyes;
On thee, their common father wait,
From thee receive supplies.
7
Thy sovereign bounty freely gives
From thine exhaustless store;
And universal nature lives,
On thy sustaining power.
8
Holy and just in all its ways,
Is providence divine;
In all thy works, immortal rays
Of power and goodness shine.
Mrs. STEEL.
Psalm CXLV. 3d. Part. Com. Met. Divine power and compassion.
GREAT God, while nature speaks thy praise,
With all her numerous tongues;
Thy saints shall tun^ diviner lays.
And love insp^^e their songs.
2
Thy power and goodness they shall sing,
The glories of thy reign;
Thy wondrous deeds, almighty King,
Shall fill the raptured strain.
3
Thy kingdom, Lord, forever stands,
While earthly thrones decay;
And time submits to thy commands
While ages roll away.
4
He that invokes the God of grace
Shall find him ever near;
To all who humbly seek his face
He lends a pitying ear.
5
He knows the pain his servants feel,
He hears his children cry;
And their best wishes to fulfill,
His grace is ever nigh.
6
His mercy never shall remove
From men of heart sincere;
He saves the souls whose humble love
Is joined with holy fear.
His praise a most delightful theme,
Shall fill my heart and tongue;
Let all creation bless his name
In one eternal song.
WATTS and STEEL.
Psalm CXLVI. Long Meter. No trust in man but in God.
THE praises of my God and King,
While I have life and breath to sing,
Shall fill my heart and tune my tongue,
Till heaven improve the blissful song.
2
No more in princes will I trust;
Vain man, thou art but air and dust!
With all thy pride, and all thy power,
The helpless creature of an hour!
3
He breathes, he thinks, but soon he dies*
No more the potent or the wise;
The scheme his morning thoughts begun*
Is lost before the setting sun.
4
Happy the man whose hopes divine
On nature's guardian God recline;
Who can with sacred transport say,
This God is mine, my help, my stay.
5
Heaven, earth and sea declare his name,
He built, he filled their spacious frame;
And over creation's fairest lines,
His steadfast truth unchanging shines.
6
His justice looks on those who mourn,
Beneath the proud oppressor's scorn;
The hungry poor his hand sustains,
And breaks the wretched captive's chains*
7
If weary strangers friendless roam,
Divine protection is their home;
The Lord relieves the widow's care,
And dries the helpless orphan's tear.
8
The Lord shall reign for ever King,
And age to age his glory sing;
Thy God, O happy Zion, reigns,
Resound his praise in lofty strains.
Mrs. STEEL.
Psalm CXLVI. Particular Met. Praise for divine goodness.
I WILL praise my maker with my breath,
And when my voice is lost in death,
Praise shall employ my nobler powers;
My days of praise shall never be past,
While life and thought and being last,
Or immortality endures.
2
Why should I make a man my trust?
Princes must die and turn to dust;
Vain is the help of flesh and blood;
Their breath departs, their pomp and power
And thoughts all vanish in an hour,
Nor can they make their promise good.
3
Happy the man whose hopes rely
On Israel's God, who made the sky,
And earth and seas with all their train:
His truth forever stands secure;
He saves the oppressed, he feeds the poor,
And none shall find his promise vain.
4
The Lord has eyes to give the blind,
The Lord supports the sinking mind,
He sends the laboring conscience peace;
He helps the stranger in distress,
The widow and the fatherless,
And grants the prisoner sweet release.
5
He loves his saints, he knows them well,
His love their joyful lips shall tell:
Thy God, O Zion, ever reigns:
Let every tongue, let every age
In this delightful work engage,
Praise him in everlasting strains.
6
I Will praise him, whilst he lends me breath,
And when my voice is lost in death,
Praise shall employ my nobler powers:
My days of praise shall never be past,
While life and thought and being last;
Or immortality endures.
WATTS.
Psalm CXLVII. Common Meter. The changing seasons.
WITH songs and honors sounding loud,
Address the Lord on high;
Over the heavens he spreads his cloud,
And waters veil the sky.
2
He sends his showers of blessing down,
To cheer the plains be^ow;
He makes the wood the mountains crown,
And grass in valleys grow.
3
He gives the grazing ox his meat,
He hears the ravens cry;
But man who tastes his finest wheat,
Should raise his honors high.
4
His steady counsels change the face,
Of the declining year;
He bids the sun cut short his race,
And wintry days appear.
5
His hoary frost, his fleecy snow,
Descend and clothe the ground;
The liquid streams forbear to flow,
In icy setters bound.
6
When, from his dreadful stores, on high,
He pours the rattling hail,
The man who dares his God defy,
Shall find his courage fail.
7
He sends his sun to melt the snow,
The fields no longer mourn;
He calls the warmer winds to blow,
And bids the spring return.
8
The changing wind, the flying cloud
Obey his sovereign word;
With songs and honors sounding loud,
Praise ye the almighty Lord.
WATTS.
Psalm CXLVII. 1st. Part. L. Met. The beauties of nature.
SING to the Lord, let praise inspire,
The grateful voice, the tuneful lyre;
In strains of joy proclaim abroad,
The endless glories of our God.
2
He counts the hosts of starry flames,
He knows their natures and their names;
Great is our God! his wondrous power,
And boundless wisdom we adore.
3
He veils the sky with treasured showers,
On earth, the plenteous blessing pours;
The meadows smile in lively green,
And fairer blooms the flowery scene.
4
His bounteous hand, great spring of good,
Provides the brute creation food;
He feeds the ravens when they cry,
All nature lives beneath his eye.
5
In nature, what can him delight
Most lovely in its maker's sight?
Not active strength his favor moves,
Nor comely form he best approves.
6
But to the Lord is ever dear,
The heart where he implants his fear;
The souls who on his grace rely
Are ever lovely in his eye.
Mrs. STEEL.
Psalm CXLVII. 2d. Part. Long Meter. The seasons of the year.
PRAISE ye the Lord! Oh blissful theme,
To sing the honors of his name!
It Is pleasure, it is divine delight,
And praise is lovely in his sight.
2
He speaks, and swiftly from the skies,
To earth, the sovereign mandate flies;
Observant nature hears the word,
And bows, obedient to her Lord.
3
Now thick descending flakes of snow
Over earth, a fleecy mantle throw;
Now glittering frost, over all the plains
Extends its universal chains.
4
At his fierce storms of icy hail,
The shivering powers of nature fail;
Before his cold, what life can stand
Unshelter'd by his guardian hand?
5
He speaks, the snow and ice obey,
And nature's fetters melt away;
Now vernal gales soft rising blow,
And liquid waters gently flow.
6
Sing to the Lord, let praise inspire
The graseful voice, the tuneful lyre;
In strains of joy, proclaim abroad
The endless glories of our God*
Mrs. STEEL.
Psalm CXLVIII. 1st. Part. Com. Met.
PRAISE ye the Lord, immortal choir,
Who ^ll the realms above,
Praise him, who formed you of his fire,
And feed^ you with his love.
2
Shine to his praise, ye crystal skies,
The floor of his abode;
O^ veil the lustr^ of your eyes,
Before a brighter God.
3
Thou central globe of golden light,
Whose beams create ou^ ^ays;
Join with the silver queen of night,
To own your borrowed rays.
4
Blush and refund the honors paid,
To your interior names;
Tell the blind world your orbs are fed,
By his exhaustless flames.
5
Winds, ye shall bear his name aloud,
Through the etherial blue!
For when his chariot is a cloud,
He makes his wheels of you.
6
Thunder and hail, and fire and storms
The troops of his command,
Appear in all your awful forms
And speak his potent hand.
WATTS.
Psalm CXLVIII. 2d. Part. C. Met.
SHOUT to the Lord, ye surging seas,
In your eternal roar;
Let wave to wave resound his praise,
And shore reply to shore.
2
While fishes sporting on the flood,
In scaly silver shine;
Proclaim their mighty maker God
Amidst the foaming brine.
3
But gentler things shall tune his name
To softer notes than these;
Young zephyrs breathing over the stream
Or whispering through the trees.
4
Wave your tall heads ye lofty pines
To him who makes you grow;
Sweet clusters bend the fruitful vine,
On every thankful bough.
5
Let the shrill birds his honor raise,
And climb the morning sky;
Whilst groveling beasts attempt his praise
In hoarser harmony.
6
Thus while the meaner creatures sing,
Ye mortals take the sound;
Echo the glories of your king
Through all the nations round.
WATTS.
Psalm CXLVIII. Long Meter.
FAIREST of all the lights above
Thou Sun, whose beams adorn the spheres
And with unwearied swiftness move.
To form the circles of our years.
2
Praise the creator of the skies,
Who dressed thine orb in golden rays;
Or may the sun forget to rise
If he forget his maker's praise.
3
Thou reigning beauty of the night,
Fair ^^ee^ of silence, silver moon,
Whose ge^^^e beams and borrowed light
Are so^^er rivals of the noon.
4
Arise, and to that sov'^eign power,
Wa^^ing and waning honors pay;
Who bade thee rule the dusky hours,
And half supply the want of day.
5
Ye glittering stars that gild the skies
When darkness has its curtain drawn,
And keep your watch with wakeful eyes,
When business, cares and day are gone.
6
Proclaim the glories of your Lord,
Dispersed through all the heavenly street
Whose boundless treasures can afford
So rich a pavement for his feet.
7
O God of glory, God of love,
Thou art our sun that makes our days,
With all thy shining works above
We would unite to sing the praise.
WATTS.
Psalm CXLVIII. Short Meter.
LET every creature join
To praise the eternal GOD,
Ye heavenly hosts, the song begin
And sound his name abroad.
2
Thou sun, with golden beams,
And moon, with paler rays,
Ye starry lights, ye twinkling flames,
Shine to your maker's praise.
3
He built those worlds above,
And fixed their wondrous frame;
By his command, they stand or move,
And ever speak his name*
4
Ye vapors, when ye rise,
Or fall in showers, or snow,
Ye thunders murmuring round the skies,
His power and glory show.
5
Wind, hail and flashing fire,
Agree to praise the Lord,
When ye in dreadful storms conspire
To execute his word.
6
By all his works above,
His honors be expressed;
(...) they who taste his saving love,
Should sing his praises best.
WATTS.
Psalm CXLVIII. 1st. Hallelujah Met. Universal Praise.
YE boundless realms of joy!
Exalt your maker's fame;
His praise your song employ,
Above the starry frame.
Ye holy throng Of angels bright,
In worlds of light, Begin the song.
2
Thou sun, with dazzling rays,
Thou moon that rules the night;
Shine to your maker's praise.
With stars of feebler light.
His praise declare, Ye heavens above,
And clouds that move, In liquid air.
3
Let them adore the Lord,
And praise his holy name;
By whose almighty word,
They all from nothing came.
And all shall last, From changes free,
His firm decree Stands ever fast.
4
He moved their mighty wheels,
In unknown ages past;
And each his word fulfils,
While time and nature last.
In different ways, His works proclaim,
His wondrous name, And speak his praise.
5
United zeal be shown,
His wondrous fame to raise,
Whose glorious name alone
Deserves our endless praise.
Earth's utmost ends His power obey;
His glorious sway, The sky transcends.
6
Virgins and youths engage,
To sound his praise divine;
While infancy and age
Their feebler voices join.
Wide as he reigns, His name be sung;
By every tongue, In endless strains.
7
Let all the nations fear
The (...) who rules above;
He brings his people near,
And makes them taste his love.
While earth and sky Attempt his praise,
His saints shall raise His honors high.

And every thankful heart
With warm devotion glow.

Then shall I grateful join
The universal choir,

And tune my song,
To lively praise.

And to the solemn organ sing.

Attend and join the blissful choir;

Adore and love and praise the Lord!

HYMNS.
Hymn. I. Long Meter. Persecution.
1
ABSURD and vain attempt! to bind
With iron chains, the freeborn mind!
To force conviction, and reclaim
The wandering by destructive flame!
2
Bold arrogance, to snatch from heaven
Dominion not to mortals given!
Over conscience to usurp the throne,
Accountable to God alone.
3
Mad zeal! that fills the world with woe!
That hurls down kingdoms at a blow!
That wakens vengeance to devour
The foes of antichristian power.
4
Jesus, thy gentle law of love,
Does no such cruelties approve;
Mild as thyself, thy doctrine wields
No arms, but what persuasion yields.
5
By proof^ divine and reason strong,
It draws the willing soul along;
And conquests to thy church acquires,
By eloquence, which heaven inspires.
6
O happy* who are th^^ compelled
To the rich feast, by Jesus held!
May we this blessing know, and prize
The light which liberty supplies.
SCOT.
Hymn II. Common Meter. The Resurrection of Christ.
1
AGAIN the Lord of life and light
Awakes the kindling ray,
Unseals the eyelids of the morn
And pours increasing day.
2
This day be grateful homage paid,
And loud hosannas sung;
Let gladness dwell in every heart,
And praise on every tongue.
3
Ten thousand differing lips shall join,
To hail this welcome morn;
Which scatters blessings from its wings*
To nations yet unborn.
4
Jesus, the friend of human kind,
With strong compassion moved,
Came from the bosom of his God,
To save the souls he loved.
5
The powers of darkness leagued in vain,
To bind his soul in death;
He shook their kingdom when he fell,
With his expiring breath.
6
Not long, the bands of death could keep
The hope of Judah's line;
Corruption never could take hold,
On one so much divine.
7
Exalted high at God's right hand,
And Lord of all below;
Through him is pardoning love dispensed,
And endless blessings flow.
8
Now to our Savior and our King,
Glad homage let us give;
And be prepared like him to die
That with him we may live.
MRS. BARBAUL^.
Hymn III. Long Meter. Holy Resolution.
1
AH, wretched souls, who strive in vain!
Slaves to the world and slaves to sin!
A nobler toil may I sustain,
A nobler satisfaction win.
2
I would resolve with all my heart,
With all my powers to serve the Lord;
Nor from his precepts ever depart,
Whose service is a rich reward.
3
O be his service all my joy,
Around let my example shine;
Till others love the blessed employ,
And join in labors so divine.
4
Be this the purpose of my soul,
My solemn, my determined choice;
To yield to his supreme control,
And in his kind commands rejoice.
5
O may I never faint nor tire,
Nor wander from thy sacred ways;
Great God, accept my soul's desire,
And give me strength to live thy praise.
MRS. STEEL.
Hymn IV. Common Meter. Watchfulness and Prayer.
1
ALAS what hourly dangers rise!
What snares beset my way!
To heaven, then let me lift my eyes,
And hourly watch and pray.
2
How often my mournful thoughts complain,
And melt in flowing tears!
My weak resistance, all how va^^!
How strong my foes and fears!
3
O gracious God, in whom I live,
My feeble efforts aid,
Help me to watch and pray and strive,
Though trembling and afraid.
4
Increase my faith, increase my hope,
When foes and fears prevail;
And bear my fainting spirit up,
Or soon my strength will fail.
5
When strong temptations fright my heart,
Or lure my feet aside;
My God, thy powerful aid impart,
My guardian and my guide.
6
Still keep me in thy heavenly way,
And bid the tempter flee;
And never, let me go astray,
From happiness and thee.
MRS. STEEL.
Hymn V. Long Meter. The Syro-Phenician Woman. Mat. xv.26, 27.
1
ALL-conquering faith! how high it rose!
When heaven itself might seemt'oppose!
All gracious Lord! who did appear
Most merciful when most severe!
2
Thus, at thy feet, our souls would ^^ll,
And loudly thus for mercy call,
"Thou Son of David, pity snow,
And save us from the infernal (...)
3
Though viler than the brutes we be,
Our longing eyes would wait on thee,
Who do to dogs such grace afford,
To taste the crumbs beneath thy board.
4
But thou the humble soul wilt raise,
And all its sorrows turn to praise;
Each self abasing broken heart
Shall with thy children share a part.
DODDRIDGE.
Hymn VI. Short Meter. Christ the Branch of David, and the Morning Star.
1
ALL hail mysterious King!
Hail David's ancient root!
Thou righteous branch, which thence did spring,
To give the nations fruit.
2
Our weary souls shall rest,
Beneath thy grateful shade;
Our thirsting lips the sweets shall taste,
By thy blessed fruit conveyed.
3
Fair morning star, arise!
With ^^ing glories bright;
And pour on th^se awakning eyes,
A stood of sacred light.
4
The horrid gloom is fled,
Pierced by thy heavenly ray;
Shine, and our wandering footsteps lead
To everlasting day.
DODDRIDGE, altered.
Hymn VII. Common Meter. A Pillar in the heavenly Temple.
1
ALL hail, victorious Savior, hail!
I bow to thy command,
And own that David's royal key
Well fits thy sovereign hand.
2
Open the treasures of thy love,
And shed thy gifts abroad;
Unveil to my rejoicing eyes,
The temple of my God.
3
There as a pillar let me stand,
On an eternal base;
Uprear'd by thy almighty hand,
And polished by thy grace.
4
There, deep engraven let me bear,
The title of my God;
And mark the new Jerusalem,
As my secure abode.
5
In lasting characters inscribe
Thy own beloved name;
That endless ages there may read
The great Immanuel's claim.
DODDRIDGE.
Hymn VIII. Long Meter. Uncharitable Judgment.
1
ALL-knowing God, it is thine to know
The springs whence wrong opinions flow;
To judge from principles within,
When frailty errs, and when we sin.
2
Who, among men, high Lord of all,
Thy servants, to his bar, may call?
Decide of heresy, and shake
A brother over the flaming lake?
3
Who, with another's eye, can read?
Or worship, by another's creed?
Revering thy command alone,
We humbly seek and use our own.
4
If wrong, forgive; accept, if right,
Whilst faithful we obey our light;
And, cens'ring none, are zealous still
To follow, as to learn, thy will.
5
When shall our happy eyes behold
Thy people, fashioned in thy mould?
And charity our lineage prove,
Derived from thee, O God of love?
SCOT.
Hymn IX. Long Meter. A Vision of the Lamb.
1
ALL mortal vanities, be gone!
Nor tempt my eyes nor tire my ears;
Behold before the eternal throne,
A vision of the Lamb appears!
2
Glory his fleecy robe adorns,
Marked with the bloody death he bore;
Seven are his eyes and seven his horns,
To speak his wisdom and his power.
3
Lo! he receives a sealed book,
From him that sits upon the throne!
Jesus, my Lord, prevails to look,
On dark decrees and things unknown.
4
All the assembling saints around
Fall worshipping before the Lamb;
And in new songs of gospel sound,
Address their honors to his name.
5
Our voices join the heavenly strain,
And with transporting pleasure sing*
Worthy the Lamb that once was slain,
To be our savior and our king.
6
Thou have redeemed our souls from hell,
With thine inestimable blood;
And wretches who did once rebel
Are now made servants of their God.
7
Worthy forever is the Lord.
Who died for treasons not his own*
By every tongue to be adored,
And reign upon his father's throne.
WATTS.
Hymn X. Common Meter. The Marriage of the Lamb.
1
ALL ye who faithful servants are
Of our almighty king,
Both high and low, and small and great,
His praise devoutly sing.
2
Let us rejoice and render thanks,
To his most holy name;
Rejoice, rejoice, for now is come
The marriage of the Lamb.
3
His bride herself has ready made,
How pure and white her dress!
This is the saint's integrity,
And spotless holiness.
4
How happy then is every one,
Who to the marriage feast;
And holy supper of the Lamb,
Is called, a welcome guest.
TATE.
Hymn XI. Particular Meter. Submission to the Divine Will.
1
ALMIGHTY King of heaven above,
Eternal source of truth and love,
And Lord of all below,
With reverence and religious fear,
Permit thy suppliants to draw near,
And at thy feet to bow.
2
Thy sovereign fiat formed (...) first,
Thy breath can blow us back to dust,
Frail, sinful, mortal clay;
It Is thine undoubted right to give,
Those earthly blessings we receive;
And thine to take away.
3
All things are under thy control,
Eternal wisdom rules the whole,
Educing good from ill;
Submissive therefore we resign,
Our wills are swallowed up in thine,
In thy most holy will.
4
In heaven above, thy will is done,
There, angels wa^^ around thy throne,
Thy counsels to obey;
Adoring at thy feet they fall,
Confess thee, sovereign Lord of all,
And own thy powerful sway.
5
Lord, may we join the heavenly throng,
May mortals learn the angelic song,
Who dwell beneath the sun;
May every tongue thy praise proclaim,
This be the universal theme,
"Jehovah's will be done."
Hymn XII. Short Meter. Humble Praise.
ALMIGHTY Maker, God,
How ^ondrous is thy name!
Thy glories how diffused abroad
Throughout creation's frame.
2
Nature in every dress
Her humble homage pays,
And finds a thousand ways t'express
Thy goodness and thy praise.
3
In native white and red,
The rose and lilly stand,
And free from pride their beauties spread
To show thy skillful hand.
4
The lark mounts up on high
With unambitious song,
And bears her maker's praise on high,
Upon her artless tongue.
5
My soul would rise and sing,
To her creator too;
Fain would my tongue adore my king,
And pay the worship due.
6
But pride, that busy sin,
Spoils all that I perform,
Cursed pride that creeps securely in,
And swells a wrethched worm.
7
Create my soul anew,
Or all my worship's vain;
This sinful heart will not be true
Till it be formed again.
8
In joy then let me spend,
The remnant of my days;
And to my God my soul ascend,
In sweet perfume of praise.
WATTS.
Hymn XIII. Common Meter. Holy Fortitude.
1
AM I a soldier of the cross?
A follower of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own his cause,
O^ blush to speak his name?
2
Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease?
Whilst others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?
3
Are there no foes for me to face?
Must not I stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?
4
Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
Increase my courage, Lord!
I Will bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by thy word.
5
Thy saints, in all this glorious war,
Shall conquer though they die;
They view the triumph from afar,
And seize it with their eye.
6
When that illustrious day shall rise,
And all thy armies shine,
In robes of victory through the skies,
The glory shall be thine.
WATTS.
Hymn XIV. Common Meter* Christ our Example.
1
AND is the gospel peace and love?
Such let our conversation be,
The serpent blended with the dove,
Wisdom and meek simplicity.
2
Whenever the angry passions rise,
And tempt our thoughts or tongues to strife;
To Jesus let us lift our eyes,
Bright pattern of the Christian life.
3
O how benevolent and kind!
How mild, how ready to forgive!
Be this the temper of our mind,
And these the rules by which we live.
4
To do his heavenly father's will,
Was his employment and delight;
Humility and holy zeal
Shone through his life divinely bright.
5
Dispensing good wherever he came,
The labors of his life were love;
Then, if we bear the Savior's name,
By his example let us move.
6
But, ah, how blind, how weak we are!
How frail, how apt to turn aside!
Lord we depend upon thy care,
We ask thy spirit for our guide.
7
Thy fair example may we trace,
To teach us what we ought to be;
Make us, by thy transforming grace,
O Savior, daily more like thee.
Mrs. STEEL*
Hymn XV. Short Meter. Triumph over Death.
1
AND must this body die?
This mortal frame decay?
And must these active limbs of mine,
Lie mouldering in the clay?
2
Corruption, earth and worms
Shall but refine this flesh
Till my triumphant spirit comes
To put it on afresh.
3
Christ, my redeemer, lives,
And often from the skies,
Looks down and watches all my dust
Till he shall bid it rise.
4
Arrayed in glorious grace,
Shall these vile bodies shine,
And every shape, and every face
Look heavenly and divine.
5
These lively hopes we owe
To Jesu's dying love;
We would adore his grace below,
And sing his power above.
6
O Lord, accept the praise
Of these our humble songs,
Till tunes of nobler sound we raise,
With our immortal tongues.
WATTS.
Hymn XVI. Common Meter. For the New Year.
1
AND now, my soul, another year
Of my short life is past;
I cannot long continue here,
And this may be my last.
2
Much of my dubious life is done,
Nor will return again;
And swift my passing moments run*
The few that yet remain.
3
Awake, my soul, with utmost care,
Thy true condition learn;
What are thy hopes, how sure, how fair?
And what thy chief concern?
4
With the new year, which now begins,
Begin thy race for heaven;
Repent of all thy former sins,
Reform and be forgiven.
5
Devoutly yield thyself to God,
To him thyself commend;
With zeal pursue the heavenly road,
Nor doubt a happy end.
LIVERPOOL COLLECTION.
Hymn XVII. All Sevens Meter. The Resurrection and Ascension of Christ.
1
ANGELS, roll the stone away,
Death, give up thy mighty prey;
See! he rises from the tomb,
Shining in immortal bloom.
2
It Is the Savior, Angels raise
Your triumphant song of praise;
Let the heaven's remotest bound
Hear the joy inspiring sound.
3
Now, ye saints, lift up your eyes,
Now to glory see him rise;
Mark his progress through the sky,
To the radiant world on high.
4
Heaven displays her crystal gate;
Enter in thy royal state;
King of glory mount thy throne,
It Is thy Father's and thy own.
5
Praise him all ye heavenly choirs,
Strike with awe, your golden lyres;
Shout, O earth, in rapturous song,
Let the strains be loud and strong.
6
To the listening nations tell,
Sin overthrown and vanquished ^ell.
Where is death's once dreaded king!
Where, O monster, is thy sting!
SCOTT.
Hymn XVIII. Long Meter. The Sabbath.
1
ANOTHER six days work is done!
Another Sabbath is begun!
Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest,
Inprove the day that God has blessed
2
Come, praise the Lord, whose love assigns
So sweet a rest to weary minds;
Provides an antepast of heaven,
And gives this day the food of seven.
3
O that our thoughts and thanks may rise
As grateful incense to the skies;
And draw from heaven that sweet repose
Which none but he who feels it knows.
4
This heavenly calm, within the breast,
Is the dear pledge of glorious rest,
Which for the Church of God remains,
The end of cares, the end of pains.
5
With joy great God, thy works we view
In various scenes both old and new;
With praise we think on mercies past,
With hope we future pleasures taste.
6
In holy duties let the day,
In holy pleasures pass away;
The Sabbath thus we love to spend,
In hope of one which never shall end.
STENNET.
Hymn XIX. Six Line Long Meter. God's Name proclaimed to Moses.
1
ATTEND, my soul, the voice divine,
And mark what beaming glories shine,
Around thy condescending God:
To us, he in his word proclaims
His awful, his endearing names;
Attend, and found them all abroad.
2
"Jehovah I, the sovereign Lord,
The mighty God by heaven adored,
Down to the earth my footsteps bend:
My heart the tenderest pity knows,
Goodness full streaming wide overflows,
And grace and truth shall never end.
3
"My patience long can crimes endure,
My pardoning love is ever sure,
When penitential sorrow mourns:
To millions, through unnumbered years,
New hope and new delight it bears,
Yet wrath against the sinner burns."
4
Make haste, my soul, the vision meet,
All prostrate at Jehovah's feet,
And drink the tuneful accents in.
Speak on, my Lord, repeat the voice,
Diffuse these heart-expanding joys,
Till heaven complete the rapturous scene.
DODDRIDGE.
Hymn XX. Common Meter. The new Creation.
1
ATTEND, whilst God's exalted Son
Does his own glories show;
"Behold I sit upon my throne
Creating all things new!
2
"Old things are wholly passed away
And the first Adam dies;
My hands a new foundation lay,
See the new world arise!
3
"I Will be a sun of righteousness,
To the new heavens I make;
None but the new born heirs of grace
My glories shall partake."
4
Mighty Redeemer, set me free,
From my old state of sin;
O make my soul alive to thee,
Create new powers within.
5
Renew my eyes, and form my ears,
And mould my heart afresh;
Give me new passions, joys and fears,
And turn the stone to flesh.
6
Far from the regions of the dead
From sin and earth and hell;
In the new world which grace has made
I would forever dwell.
WATTS.
Hymn XXI. Long Meter Glory in the Cross.
1
AT thy command, our blessed Lord,
Here we attend thy dying feast;
Thy blood, like wine, adorns thy board,
And thy own flesh feeds every guest.
2
Our faith adores thy bleeding love,
And trusts for life in one that died;
We hope for heavenly crowns above,
From a Redeemer crucified.
3
Let the vain world pronounce its shame,
And fling its scandals on the cause;
We come to boast our Savior's name,
And make our triumph in his cross.
4
With joy, we tell the scoffing age,
He that was dead has left his tomb;
He lives above their utmost rage,
And we are waiting till he come.
WATTS.
Hymn XXII. Common Meter. The Incarnation of the Word.
1
AWAKE, awake the sacred ^ong,
To our incarnate Lord!
Let every heart and every tongue
Adore the eternal Word.
2
That glorious Word, that sovereign power,
By whom the worlds were made;
O happy morn! illustrious hour!
Was once in flesh arrayed.
3
Then shone almighty power and love,
In all their glorious forms;
When Jesus left the world above,
To dwell with sinful worms.
4
To dwell with misery below,
The Savior left the skies;
And sunk to poverty and woe,
That wretched man might rise.
5
Adoring angels tuned their songs
To hail the joyful day;
With rapture then let mortal tongues
Their grateful homage pay.
6
What glory, Lord, to thee is due!
With wonder we adore;
But could we sing as angels do
We'd love and praise thee more.
MRS. STEEL.
Hymn XXIII. Long Meter. Temptation without and within.
1
AWAKE, my soul, lift up thine eyes,
See how thy foes against thee rise,
In long array, a numerous host;
Awake, my soul, or thou art lost.
2
See how rebellious passions rage,
And fierce desire^ and lusts engage;
See pleasure's silken banners spread,
And willing souls are captive led.
3
I tread upon enchanted ground,
Perils and snares beset me round;
O let me then guard every part,
But most, the traitor in my heart.
4
O teach thy servant how to wield
Blessed Savior, thy immortal shield;
Put on thy armor from above,
Of heavenly truth and heavenly love.
5
The terror and the charm repel,
The smiles of earth, the frowns of hell;
The tempter once thou did subdue,
O make me more than conqueror too.
MRS. BARBAULD.
Hymn XXIV. Hallelujah Meter. The Lord's Day Morning.
1
AWAKE our drowsy souls!
Shake off each slothful band!
The wonders of this day
Our noblest songs demand.
Auspicious morn, Thy blissful rays
Bright seraphs hail, In songs of praise!
2
At thy approaching dawn,
Reluctant death resigned
The glorious prince of life,
In the dark vault confined.
The angelic host Around him bends
And midst their shouts, The Lord ascends.
3
All hail triumphant Lord!
Heaven with hosanna rings;
Whilst earth in humbler strains,
Thy praise responsive sings.
Worthy art thou, Who once wast slain,
Through endless years, To live and reign.
4
Gird on, great King, thy sword,
Ascend thy conquering car,
Whilst justice, truth and love
Maintain the glorious war.
Victorious thou, Thy foes shall tread,
And sin and death, In triumph lead.
5
Make bare thy potent arm,
And wing the unerring dart,
With salutary pangs
To each rebellious heart.
Then dying souls, For life shall sue,
Numerous as drops, Of morning dew.

Hymn XXV. Long Meter. The Christian Race.
1
AWAKE our souls, away our fears,
Let every trembling thought be gone;
Awake and run the heavenly race,
And put a cheerful courage on.
2
True it is a straight and thorny road,
And mortal spirits tire and saint;
If they forget the mighty God,
Who feeds the strength of every saint.
3
The mighty God, whose powerful hand
Has matchless works of wonder done;
And shall endure, whilst endless years
Their everlasting circles run.
4
From him, the overflowing spring,
Our souls shall drink a rich supply;
Whilst those who trust their native strength
Shall melt away, and droop and die.
5
Swift as an eagle cuts the air,
We'll mount aloft to thine abode;
On wings of love our souls will fly,
Nor tire amidst the heavenly road.

Hymn XXVI. Long Meter. Benefit of Ordinances.
1
AWAY from every mortal care,
Away from earth, our souls retreat;
We leave this worthless world afar,
And wait and worship near thy feat.
2
Lord, in the temple of thy grace,
We bow before thee and adore;
We view the glories of thy face,
And learn the wonders of thy power.
3
Whilst here our various wants we mourn,
United prayers ascend on high;
And faith expects a sure return
Of blessings in variety.
4
If Satan rage and sin grow strong,
Here we receive some cheering word;
We gird the gospel armor on,
To fight the battles of the Lord.
5
Here, when our spirit faints and dies,
And conscience smarts with inward stings;
The sun of righteousness shall rise,
With healing beams beneath his wings.
6
Here would our ravished souls abide,
Or if from hence we must depart,
Let neither life nor death divide
Our God and Savior from our heart.

Hymn. XXVII. Long Meter. The Word made Flesh.
1
BEFORE the heavens were spread abroad,
From everlasting was the Word;
With God he was, the Word was God,
And by the angelic host adored.
2
By his great power, were all things made,
By him supported all things stand;
He is the whole Creation's head,
And Angels fly at his command.
3
Ere sin was born or Satan fell,
He led the host of morning stars!
Thy generation, who can tell?
Or count the number of thy years?
4
But lo, he leaves these heavenly forms,
The Word descends and dwells in clay;
That he may converse hold with worms,
Dressed in such feeble flesh as they.
5
Mortals with joy beheld his face,
The eternal father's only Son;
How full of truth, how full of grace!
When through his eyes, the Godhead shone*
6
Archangels leave their high abode,
To learn new mysteries here, and tell
The love of our descending God,
The glories of Emmanuel.
WATTS.
Hymn XXVIII. Common Meter. Faith in the Promise of Salvation.
1
BEGIN, my tongue, some heavenly theme,
And speak some lofty thing;
The mighty works, or mighty name
Of our eternal King.
2
Tell of his wondrous faithfulness,
Or sound his power abroad;
Sing the b^est promise of his grace,
And the performing God.
3
Proclaim salvation from the Lord,
To sinful, dying men;
His hand has writ the sacred word,
With an unerring pen.
4
Engraved as in eternal brass,
The gracious promise shines;
Nor shall the hand of time erase
Those everlasting lines.

Then why these doubts and sad complaints?
If Christ and we are one,
The word extends to all the saints,
Who humbly love the son.
6
By faith in this our souls have lived,
And part of heaven possessed;
We'll praise him then for grace received,
And trust him for the rest.

Hymn XXIX. Particular Meter. The Resurrection and Glory of Christ.
1
BEHOLD! the bright morning appears,
And Jesus revives from the grave!
His rising removes all our fears,
And proves him almighty to save.
How strong were his tears and his cries!
The worth of his blood how divine!
How perfect his great sacrifice,
Who rose though he suffered for sin!
2
The man who was crowned with thorns,
The man who on Calvary died,
The man who bore scourging and scorn,
Whom sinners agreed to deride;
Now blessed forever is made,
And life has rewarded his pain;
Now glory has crowned his head,
This is the true lamb that was (...)
3
Believing we share in his joy,
By faith (...) of his rest,
With him we can cheerfully die,
For with him we hope to be blessed.
It Is Jesus the first and the last,
Whose spirit shall guide us safe home;
We'll praise him for all that is past,
And crust him for all that is to come!

Hymn XXX. Common Meter. Praise to the Lamb of God.
1
BEHOLD the glories of the Lamb
Amidst the father's throne!
Prepare new honors for his name,
And songs before unknown.
2
Let Elders worship at his feet,
The Church adore around;
With vials full of odours sweet,
With harps of sweeter sound.
3
Those are the offered prayers of saints,
And these the hymns they raise;
Jesus is kind to our complaints,
He loves to hear our praise.
4
Now, to the Lamb that once was slain,
Be endless blessings paid;
Salvation, glory, joy remain,
Forever on thy head.
5
Thou have redeemed our souls with blood,
Have set the prisoners free;
Have made us kings and priests to God,
And we shall reign with thee.
6
The worlds of nature and of grace,
Are put beneath thy power;
Then shorten these delaying days,
And bring the promised hour.
WATTS.
Hymn XXXI. Short Meter. The Nativity of Christ.
1
BEHOLD the grace appears!
The promise is fulfilled;
Mary, the wondrous virgin bears,
And Jesus is the Child.
2
To bring the glorious news,
A heavenly form appears;
He tells the shepherds of their joys,
And banishes their fears.
3
"Go humble swains, said he,
To David's city fly;
The promised infant born to day
Does in a manger lie.
4
With looks, and hearts serene,
Go visit Christ your king."
And strait a flaming choir was seen
The shepherds heard them sing.
5
"Glory to God on high!
And heavenly peace on earth!
Good will to men, to angels joy,
At the redeemer's birth!"
6
In worship so divine,
Let saints employ their tongues;
With the celestial host we join,
And loud repeat their songs.
7
"Glory to God on high!
And heavenly peace on earth!
Good will to men, to angels joy,
At our redeemer's birth."
WATTS.
Hymn XXXII. Common Meter. The Ignorance of Man.
1
BEHOLD the new born infant, grieved
With hunger, thirst and pain!
It cries to have its wants relieved,
But knows not to complain.
2
Such childhood yet I must confess,
Though long in years mature;
Unknow^ (...) whence I feel distress,
And whe^^ to seek its cure.
3
Author of good! to thee I turn;
Thy ever watchful eye
Alone, can all my wants discern,
Thy hand alone supply.
4
O let thy fear within me dwell,
Thy love my footsteps guide;
That love shall vainer loves expel,
That fear, all fears beside.
5
And since, by error's force subdued,
My often misguided will
Preposterous, shuns the latent good,
And grasps the specious ill;
6
Not to my wish, but to my want,
Do thou thy gifts apply;
Unasked, what good thou know, grant,
What ill, though asked, deny.
MERRICK.
Hymn XXXIII. Long Meter. A grave and decent Deportment.
1
BEHOLD the sons and heirs of God
So dearly bought with Jesu's blood!
Are they not born to heavenly joys?
And shall they stoop to earthly toys?
2
Can laughter feed the immortal mind?
Were spirits of celestial kind
Made for a jest, for sport, for play,
To wear out time and waste the day?
3
Does vain discourse or empty mirth
Well suit the honors of their birth?
Shall they be fond of gay attire,
Which children love, which fools admire?
4
What if we wear the richest vest?
Peacocks and flies are better dressed;
This flesh with all its gaudy forms,
Must drop to dust and feed the worms.
5
Lord, raise our hearts and passions higher,
Touch our vain souls with sacred fire;
Then, with a heaven-directed eye,
We'll pass these glittering trifles by.
6
We'll look on all the toys below,
With such disdain as angels do;
And wait the call that bids us rise,
To mansions promised in the skies.
WATTS.
Hymn XXXIV. Common Meter. The repenting Prodigal.
1
BEHOLD the wretch whose lust and wine
Had wasted his estate!
He begs a share among the swine,
To taste the husks they eat.
2
"I die with hunger here, he cried,
I starve in foreign lands;
My Father's house has large supplies,
And bounteous are his hands.
3
I Will go, and with a mournful tongue,
Fall down before his face;
Father, I Have done thy justice wrong,
Nor can deserve thy grace."
4
He said, and hastened to his home,
To seek his Father's love;
The Father saw the rebel come,
And all his bowels move.
5
He ran and fell upon his neck,
Embraced and kissed his son;
The rebel's heart with sorrow brake,
For follies he had done.
6
"Take off his clothes of shame and sin,
The Father gives command;
Dress him in garments white and clean*
With rings adorn his hand.
7
A day of feasting I ordain,
Let mirth and joy abound;
My Son was dead, and lives again,
Was lost, but now is found^"
WATTS.
Hymn XXXV. Short Meter. Adoption.
1
BEHOLD, what wondrous grace
The father has bestowed
On sinners of a mortal race,
To call them sons of God!
2
It Is no surprising thing,
That we should be unknown;
The Jewish world knew not their King,
God's everlasting Son.
3
Nor does it yet appear,
How great we shall be made;
But, when we see our Savior here,
We shall be like our head.
4
A hope so much divine
May trials well endure;
May cleanse our souls from sense and sin,
As Christ the Lord is pure
5
If in our father's love,
We share a filial part;
Send down thy spirit like a dove,
To rest upon our heart.
6
We would no longer lie,
Like slaves beneath the throne;
Our faith shall Abba, Father, cry,
And thou the kindred own.
WATTS.
Hymn XXXVI. Long Meter. The better Part.
1
BESET with snares and filled with dread,
In life's uncertain path we tread;
Savior divine, diffuse thy light,
To guide our doubtful footsteps right.
2
Engage our roving treacherous heart,
To choose the wise, the better part;
To scorn the trifles of a day,
For joys that never fade away.
3
Then let the fiercest storms arise,
Let tempests mingle earth and skies;
No fatal shipwreck shall we fear,
But all our treasure with us bear.
4
If then our Savior still be nigh,
Cheerful we live and joyful die;
Secure when mortal comforts flee,
To find a thousand worlds in thee.
DODDRIDGE.
Hymn XXXVII. Long Meter. The Beatitudes.
1
BLESSED are the humble souls that see
Their emptiness and poverty;
Treasures of grace to them are given,
And crowns of joy laid up in heaven.
2
Blessed are the men of broken heart,
Who mourn for sin with inward smart;
The blood of Christ divinely flows*
A healing balm for all their woes.
3
Blessed are the meek who stand afar,
From rage and passion, noise and war;
God will secure their happy state,
And plead their cause against the great.
4
Blessed are the souls that thirst for grace,
Hunger and long for righteousness;
They shall be well supplied and fed,
With living streams and living bread.
5
Blessed are the men whose bowels move,
And melt with sympathy and love;
From Christ the Lord, they shall obtain
Like sympathy and love again.
Blessed are the pure whose hearts are clean,
From the defiling power of sin;
With endless pleasure they shall see
A God of spotless purity.
7
Blessed are the men of peaceful life,
Who quench the coals of growing strife;
They shall be called the heirs of bliss,
The sons of God, the God peace.
8
Blessed are the sufferers, who partake
Of pain and shame for Jesu's sake;
Their souls shall triumph in the Lord,
Glory and joy are their reward.
WATTS.
Hymn XXXVIII. Common Meter. The Hope of the Resurrection.
1
BLESSED be the everlasting God,
The father of our Lord;
Be his abounding mercy praised,
His majesty adored.
2
When from the dead he raised his Son,
And called him to the sky;
He gave our souls a lively hope,
That they should never die.
3
What though his uncontrol'd decree
Command our flesh to dust?
Yet as the Lord our Savior rose,
So all his followers must.
4
There Is an inheritance divine
Reserved against that day;
It Is uncorrupted, undefiled,
And cannot fade away.
5
Saints by the power of God are kept,
Till the salvation come;
We walk by faith as strangers here,
Till Christ shall call us home.
WATTS.
Hymn XXXIX. Common Meter. Benevolence rewarded.
1
BLESSED is the man whose tender heart
Feels all another's pain;
To whom, the supplicating eye
Was never raised in vain.
2
Whose breast expands with generous warmth,
A stranger's woe to feel;
And bleeds in pity over the wound,
He wants the power to heal.
3
He spreads his kind supporting arms,
To every child of grief;
His secret bounty largely flows,
And brings unasked relief.
4
To gentle offices of love,
His feet are never slow;
He views through mercy's melting eye,
A brother in his foe.
5
Peace, from the bosom of his God,
Peace shall to him be given;
His soul shall rest secure on earth,
And find its native heaven.
6
To him protection shall be shown;
And mercy, from above
Descend on those, who thus fulfill
The perfect law of love.

Your liberty receive,

The news of pardoning grace;
Ye happy souls, draw near,
Behold your Savior's face!

Has full atonement made;
Ye weary spirits, rest,
Ye mournful souls be glad.

Hymn XLI. Long Meter. The incomprehensible GOD.
1
CAN creatures to perfection find
The eternal uncreated mind?
Or can the largest stretch of thought
Measure and search his nature out?
2
It Is high as heaven, it is deep as hell,
And what can mortals know or tell?
His glory spreads beyond the sky,
And all the shining worlds on high.
3
God is a king of power unknown;
Firm are the orders of his throne;
If he resolve, who dare oppose?
Or ask him why or what he does?
4
He frowns, and darkness veils the moon;
The fainting sun grows dim at noon;
The pillars of heaven's starry roof
Tremble and start at his reproof.
5
He gave the vaulted heaven its form,
The crooked serpent and the worm;
He breaks the billows, with his breath,
And smites the sons of pride to death.
6
These are a portion of his ways!
But who shall dare describe his face?
Who can endure his light! or stand,
To hear the thunders of his hand?

Hymn XLII. Common Meter. God incomprehensible.

CELESTIAL King, our spirits lie,
Trembling beneath thy feet;
And wish and cast a longing eye,
To reach thy lofty seat.
2
In thee, what endless wonders meet!
What various glories shine!
The dazzling rays too fiercely beat,
Upon our fainting mind.
3
Angels are lost in glad surprise,
If thou unveil thy grace;
And humble awe runs through the skies,
When wrath arrays thy face.
4
Created powers, how weak they be!
How short our praises fall!
So much akin to nothing, we,
And thou, the eternal all.
5
Lord, here we bend our humble souls,
And awfully adore;
For the weak pinions of our minds
Can stretch a thought no more.

COME blessed Lord, descend and dwell,
By faith and love within our breast;
Then shall we know, and taste and feel
Such joys as cannot be expressed.
2
Come fill our hearts with inward strength,
Make our enlarged souls possess,
And learn the height, and breadth and length
Of thy unmeasurable grace.

Could we but pierce the veil, and see
The glories of the eternal skies;
What little things these worlds would be!
How despicable in our eyes!
4
Great all in all, eternal king!
Could we but view thy glorious face,
Then all our powers should join to sing
Thy boundless wisdom and thy grace.

Now to the God, whose power in heaven
And earth, has works of wonder done,
Be everlasting honors given,
By all the Church, through Christ his son.

"To be exalted thus;"
"Worthy the Lamb," our lips reply,
"For he was slain for us."

Honor and power divine;

Be, Lord, forever thine.

And speak thine endless praise.

To bless the sacred name,
Of him who sits upon the throne,
And to adore the Lamb.

Adorn the realms of peace.

The soul, from sin forever free,

But, clothed in spotless purity,
Redeeming love adore.

There, on a throne, how dazzling bright,
The exalted Savior shines;
And beams ineffable delight,

Join in immortal songs;

Employ their tuneful tongues.

With heavenly weapons I have fought
The battles of the Lord;
Finished my course, and kept the faith,
And wait the sure reward.

God has laid up in heaven for me,
A crown which cannot fade;
The righteous judge, at that great day,
Shall place it on my head.

Nor has the king of grace decreed
This prize for me alone;

Hymn L. Long Meter. Christ the Physician of the Soul.
1
DEEP are are the wounds which sin has made,
Where shall the sinner find a cure?
In vain alas, is Nature's aid,
The work exceeds her utmost power.
2
Sin, like a raging fever, reigns
With fatal strength in every part;
The dire contagion fills the veins,
And spreads its poison to the heart.
3
But can no sovereign balm be found?
And is no kind physician nigh?
To ease the pain, and heal the wound,
Ere life and hope forever fly?
4
Yes, there is a great physician near,
Look up my fainting soul and live!
See, in his heavenly smiles appear,
Such help as nature cannot give!
5
See, in the Savior's dying blood,
Life, health and bliss abundant slow!
It Is only that dear, sacred flood,
Can ease thy pain and heal thy woe.

Sin throws in vain its pointed dart,
For here a sovereign cure is found;
A cordial for the fainting heart,
A balm for every painful wound.

Whilst to their golden harps they sing;

Behold my heart and see;
And turn each worthless idol out,
That dares to rival thee.

Is not thy name melodious still
To my enraptured ear?
Does not my pulse with pleasure beat
My Savior's voice to hear?
3
Have thou a lamb in all thy flock
I would disdain to seed?
Have thou a foe, before whose face
I fear thy cause to plead?
4
Would not my ardent spirit vie,
With angels round thy throne,
To execute thy sacred will,
And make thy glory known?
5
Would not my heart pour out its blood,
In honor of thy name?
And challenge the cold hand of death,
To damp the immortal flame!

Thou know I love thee, O my Lord;
But how I long to soar,
Above the sphere of mortal joys,
And learn to love thee more!

DO thou my worthless name record,

Whilst many of the human race

Lo wretched millions draw their breath
In lands of ignorance and death!
But I enjoy my share of time,
Within thy gospel's favored clime.

Shall I my great vocation stain?
Away, ye works in darkness wrought!
Away, each sensual, wanton thought!

My soul I charge thee to excel,
In thinking right and acting well;
Deep let thy searching powers engage,
Unbias'd in the sacred page.

Heighten the force of good desire,
To deeds of shining worth aspire;

Advancing still in virtue's school;
Contending still, with noble strife,
To imitate thy Savior's life.

ETERNAL God, Almighty cause

Of all within itself possessed;
Controlled by none are thy commands;
Thou from thyself alone art blessed.

To thee alone ourselves we owe,
To thee alone our homage pay;
All other Gods we disavow,
Deny their claims, renounce their sway.

Fountain of peace and joy and love!
Thy ^avour only makes us blessed,
Without thee, all would nothing prove.

Spread thy great name through heathen lands,
Their idol deities dethrone;
Subdue the world to thy command,
And reign, as thou art, God alone.

O guide me down the steep of age,
And keep my passions cool;
Teach me to scan the sacred page,
And practice every rule.
3
My flying years, time urges on,
My strength must soon decay;
My friends, my youth's companions gone,
Can I expect to stay?
4
Can I exemption plead, when death
Projects his awful dart?
Can medicines then prolong my breath,
Or cordials shield my heart?
5
But thou can cheer my mortal hour,
On thee my hope depends;
Support me by almighty power,
While dust to dust descends.
6
Then let my soul, O gracious God,
Ascend to realms of day;
And in that sacred blessed abode,
Its endless anthems pay.

Throughout the heaven's remotest bound
Thy matchless love proclaim;
And join the choir of saints that sound
Their great Redeemer's name.

Amidst ten thousand deaths I stand;
And see, when I survey thy ways,
Ten thousand monuments of praise.

Thus far thy arm has led me on,
Thus far I make thy mercy known;

Shall raise one sacred pillar more;
Then bear, in thy bright courts above,
Inscriptions of immortal love.

ETERNAL power, whose high abode
Becomes the grandeur of the God,
Extending far beyond the bounds
Where stars revolve inferior rounds.

The lowest step beneath thy seat
Rises too high for Gabriel's feet
In vain the tall archangel tries
To reach its height, with wondering eyes.
3
Thy dazzling glory whilst he sings,
He hides his face behind his wings,
And ranks of thrones and powers around,
Fall prostrate on the heavenly ground.

Lord what shall earth and ashes do!
We would adore our maker too;
From lowest dust to thee we cry,
The great, the holy and the high.

Earth from afar has heard thy fame,
And men have learned to lisp thy name;
But the full glories of thy mind
Leave all our soaring thoughts behind.

Be short our hymns, our words be few,
A sacred reverence checks our songs,
And praise is silent on our tongues.

Embalms the air and paints the land;
The summer rays with vigor shine,
To raise the corn and cheer the vine.

Seasons and months and weeks and days
Demand successive hymns of praise;
Still be the cheerful homage paid,
With morning light and evening shade.
5
O, may our more harmonious tongues,
In worlds unknown, pursue the songs
And in those brighter Courts adore,
Where days and years revolve no more.

Hymn LX. Long Meter. The Influences of the Divine Spirit.
1
ETERNAL Spirit, we confess,
And sing the wonders of thy grace!
Thy power conveys the blessings down,
From God the Father and his Son.
2
Enlightened by thy heavenly ray,
Our shades and darkness turn to day;
Thy inward teachings make us know,
Our danger and our refuge too.
3
Thy gentle influence works within,
And breaks the chains of reigning sin;
Does our imperious lust subdue,
And forms our wretched hearts anew.
4
The troubled conscience knows thy voice,
It makes the broken heart rejoice;
Thy words allay the stormy wind,
And calm the surges of the mind.

Hymn LXI. Common Meter. Creating Wisdom.
1
ETERNAL wisdom! thee we praise,
Thee, all thy creatures sing;
With thy great name, rocks, hills and seas
And heaven's high arches ring.
2
Thy hand! how wide it spread the sky!
How glorious to behold!
Tinged with a blue of heavenly dye,
And starr'd with sparkling gold.
3
There, do thou make the globes of light,
Their endless circles run;
There, the pale planets rule the night,
And day obeys the sun.
4
The roaring winds stand ready there,
Thy orders to obey;
With spreading wings, they sweep the air,
To make thy chariot way.
5
The rolling mountains of the deep
Observe thy strong command;
Thy breath can raise the billows steep
Or sink them to the sand.
6
Thy glories blaze all nature round,
And strike our feeble sight,
Through skies and seas and solid ground,
With terror and delight.
7
Infinite strength and equal skill
Shine through the worlds abroad;
Our souls with vast amazement fill,
And speak the builder God.

EXALTED Prince of life, we own
The royal honors of thy throne;
It Is fixed by God's almighty hand,
And Seraphs bow at thy command.
2
Exalted Savior, we confess
The sovereign triumphs of thy grace;
Where beams of gentle radiance shine,
And temper majesty divine.
3
Wide thy resistless scepter sway,
Till all thy enemies obey;
Wide may thy cross its virtue prove,
And conquer millions by thy love.

Mighty to vanquish and forgive!
Thine Israel shall repent and live;
And loud proclaim thy healing breath,
Which gives them life, who wrought thy death.

Hymn LXIII. Common Meter. Walking by Faith.
1
FAITH is the brightest evidence
Of things beyond our sight;
It pierces through the veil of sense,
And dwells in heavenly light.
2
It sets time past in present view,
Brings distant prospects home;
Of things a thousand years ago,
Or thousand years to come.
3
By faith we know the world was made
By God's almighty word;
We know the heavens and earth shall fade,
And be again restored.
4
Abraham obeyed the Lord's command,
From his own country driven;
By faith he sought a promised land,
But found his rest in heaven.
5
Thus through life's pilgrimage we stray,
The promise in our eye;
By faith we walk the narrow way,
That leads to joy on high

FAR from my thoughts, vain world, be gone,
Let my religious hours alone;
From flesh and sense I would be free.
And hold communion, Lord, with thee.
2
My heart grows warm with holy fire,
And kindles with a pure desire;
To see thy grace, to taste thy love,
And feel thine influence from above.
3
When I can say that God is mine,
When I can see thy glories shine;
I tread the world beneath my feet,
And all that men call rich and great.

Send comfort down from thy right hand,
To cheer me in this barren land;
And in thy temple, let me know,
The joys that from thy presence flow.

And to the world's remotest ends
Thy empire shall advance."

Shall their Redeemer own?
Whilst Gentiles to his standard crowd,
And bow before his throne?
4
Are not all kingdoms, tribes and tongues,
Beneath the arch of heaven,
To the dominion of thy son,
Without exception given?

From east to west, from north to south
Then be his name adored,
Let earth with all its millions shout
Hosanna to the Lord.

And bow before thy throne;

FATHER of all! whose cares extend
To earth's remotest shore;
Through every age let praise ascend,
And every clime adore.

Yet not to earth's contracted span,
Thy goodness let me bound;
Or think thee, Lord alone of man,
When thousand worlds are round.
3
To thee, whose presence fills all space,
The earth, the air, the skies;
One chorus let all beings raise,
All Nature's incense rise!
4
Father of all! whose tender care
Does every want supply;
To thee I pour the fervent prayer,
And raise the filial eye.
5
What blessings thy free bounty gives
Let me not cast away;
Who gratefully enjoys and lives
Does the best homage pay.
6
Save me alike from foolish pride,
Or impious discontent;
At aught thy wisdom has denied,
Or aught thy goodness lent.
7
Teach me to feel another's woe
To hide the faults I see;
That mercy I to others show,
That mercy show to me.
8
Let not this weak unknowing hand,
Presume thy bolts to throw,
And deal destruction round the land,
On each I judge thy foe.
9
If I am right, thy grace impart,
Still in the right to stay;
If I am wrong, O teach my heart
To find that better way.
10
This day, be bread and peace my lot;
But, all beneath the sun,
Thou know it if best bestowed or not;
Then let thy will be done.

And when I go astray;
Recall my feet from folly's path,
To wisdom's better way.
3
Teach me in every various scene
To keep my end in sight;
And whilst I tread life's mazy track,
Let wisdom guide me right.
4
That heavenly wisdom from above
Abundantly impart;
And let it guard, and guide, and warm,
And penetrate my heart.

Till it shall lead me to thyself,
Fountain of bliss and love;
And all my darkness be dispersed,
In endless light above.

Wide as he spreads his golden flame,

2
Fountain of good! from thee, proceed
The copious showers of genial rain;
Which, over the hill and through the mead,
Revive the grass and swell the grain.
3
Through the wide world thy bounties spread;
Yet thousands of our guilty race,
Though by thy daily goodness fed,
Transgress thy law, abuse thy grace.
4
Not so, shall our forgetful hearts
O'erlook the tokens of thy care;
But, what thy liberal hand imparts,
Receive with praise and ask in prayer.

So shall the sun more grateful shine,
And showers in welcome drops shall fall;
When all our hearts and lives are thine,
And thou, our God, enjoyed in all.

1
FATHER of mercies! in thy house,
We pay our homage and our vows;
Whilst with a grateful heart we share,
Those pledges of our Savior's care.
2
The Savior, when to Heaven he rose,
In splendid triumph over his foes;
Scattered his gifts on men below,
And wide his royal bounties flow.
3
Hence sprang the Apostle's honored name,
Sacred beyond heroic fame;
Hence di^tates the prophetic sage,
And hence the evangelic page.
4
In lower forms to bless our eyes,
Pastors from hence and Teachers rise;
Who, though with feebler rays they shine,
Still mark a long extended line.
5
From Christ their varied gifts derive,
And fed by him their graces live;
Whilst guarded by his potent hand,
Amidst the rage of hell they stand.
6
So shall the bright succession run,
Through all the courses of the sun;
Whilst unborn churches, by their care,
Shall rise and flourish large and fair.
7
Jesus, our Lord, their hearts shall know,
The spring whence all these blessings flow;
Pastors and people shout his praise,
Through the long round of endless days.

When ever the helpless sons of want
In low distress are laid;
Soft be our hearts, their pains to feel,

So Jesus looked on wretched man,
When seated in the skies;
Amidst the glories of that world,
He felt compassion rise.

To raise us from the ground;
And shed his rich and precious blood,

Sweet, meek eyed patience arm my soul;
And let a prudent fortitude

Whilst a wise zeal inspires my heart,

Where not the heart is found.

Steady and strong the current flows;
Till lost in that unmeasured sea,
From which its being first arose.

Upon the rapid stream are borne;
To that unseen, eternal home,
From which no travelers return.

Yet whilst the shore, on either side
Presents a gaudy, flattering show;
We gaze in fond amazement lost,
Nor think to what a world we go.

To know the price of every hour;
That time may bear us on to joys,
Beyond its measure and its power.

And all the powers of language fail;
Joy through my feeble eyes shall break,

Of never failing skill,

And works his sovereign will.

The clouds they so much dread,

In blessings on their head.

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense;
But trust him for his grace;
Behind a frowning Providence,
He hides a smiling face.
5
His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour;

But sweet will be the flower.

And scan his work in vain;

And he will make it plain.

Hymn XCII. Common Meter. The God of Nature.
1
HAIL, King supreme! all wise and good^
To thee our thoughts we raise;
Whilst nature's lovely charms, displayed,
Inspire our souls with praise.
2
At morning, noon and evening mild,
Thy works engage our view;
And as we gaze, our hearts exult.
With transports ever new.
3
Thy glory beams in every star,
Which gilds the gloom of night;
And decks the rising face of morn,
With rays of cheering light.
4
The aspiring hill, the verdant lawn,
With thousand beauties shine;
The vocal grove and cooling shade
Proclaim thy power divine.

From tree to tree, a constant hymn
Employs the feathered throng;
To thee, their cheerful (...), they swell,
And chant their grateful song.

Still may our wondering eyes peruse

Thou did free salvation bring;

From the tyrant's deadly sting.

Bearer of our sin and shame!
By thy merits we find favor,
Life is given through thy name.

HAPPY the Church! thou sacred place,
The seat of thy Creator's grace!
Thy holy courts are his abode,
Thou earthly palace of our God.

Thy walls are strength, and at thy gates,
A guard of heavenly angels waits;
Nor shall thy deep foundations move,
Built on the counsels of his love.
3
Thy foes in vain designs engage,
Against thy walls in vain they rage;
Like rising waves, with anger roar,
That dash and die upon the shore.
4
Then let our souls in Zion dwell,
Nor fear the power of earth or hell;
Since God defends this happy ground,
Like brazen bulwarks built around.

God is our Sun, God is our shield,
Light and protection he will yield;
And we beneath the genial rays,
Will sing his love, and speak his praise.

Hymn XCVI. Long Meter. Christian Moderation.
1
HAPPY the man whose cautious steps
Still keep the golden mean;
Whose life by wisdom's rules, well formed,
Declares a conscience clean.
2
Not of himself he highly thinks,
Nor acts the boaster's part;
His modest tongue the language speaks
Of his more humble heart.
3
Not in base scandal's arts he deals,
For truth is in his breast;
With grief, he sees his neighbor's faults,
And thinks and hopes the best.
4
What blessings bounteous heaven bestows,
He takes with thankful heart;
With temperance he receives his food,
And gives the poor a part.
5
To sect and party, his large soul
Disdains to be confined;
The good he loves, of every name,
And prays for all mankind.
6
Pure is his zeal, the offspring fair
Of truth and peaceful love;
The bigot's rage can never dwell,
Where rests the heavenly dove.

And love inspires the breast!
Love is the brightest of the train,
And strengthens all the rest.

Knowledge, alas! it is all in vain,
And all in vain our fear;
Our stubborn sins will fight and reign,
If love be absent there.
3
It Is love that makes our cheerful feet
In swift obedience move;
Affliction's bitter cup is sweet,
When mixed with heavenly love.
4
Soon as we drop this mortal clay,
And leave this dark abode!
On wings of love we'll soar away,
To see our Father God.
5
This is the grace that lives and sings,
When faith and hope shall cease;
It Is this shall strike our joyful strings,
In realms of endless peace.

To make repentance sure;
Then let our hearts be purified

Hymn CXXVII. Short Meter. Ba^tism by Immersion.
1
IN such a grave as this,
The meek redeemer lay,
When he our souls to seek and save
Learned humbly to obey.
2
See how the spotless lamb
Descends into the stream!
And teaches us to imitate,
What him so well became.
3
Let sinners wash away,
Their sins of crimson dye;
Buried with him, their vilest sins
Shall in oblivion lie.
4
Rise, and ascend with him,
A heavenly life to lead;
Who came to ransom guilty men,
From regions of the dead.
5
Lord, see the sinner's tears!
Hear his repenting cry!
Speak, and his contrite heart shall live,
Speak, and his sins shall die.
6
Speak, with that mighty voice,
Which shall hereafter spread
Its summons through the earth and sea,
To raise the sleeping dead.

Hymn CXXVIII. Common Meter.
God our Portion. Psalm iv.6, 7.
1
IN vain the erring world inquires
For true substantial good;
Whilst earth confines their low desires,
They live on airy food.
2
Illusive dreams of happiness
Their eager tho'ts employ;
They wake, convinced their boasted bliss
Was visionary joy.
3
Not all the good which earth bestows,
Can fill the craving mind;
Its highest joys have mingled woes,
And leave a sting behind.
4
Be gone, ye gilded vanities!
I seek some solid good;
To real bliss my wishes rise,
The favor of my God.
5
To thee, my God, my soul aspires,
Dispel these shades of night,
Enlarge and fill these vast desires,
With infinite delight.
6
Immortal joy thy smiles impart,
Heaven dawns in every ray;
One glimpse of thee will glad my heart
And turn my night to day.

IN vain we lavish out our lives,
To gather empty wind;
The choicest blessings earth can yield
Will starve a hungry mind.

But God can every want supply,
And fill our hearts with peace;
He gives by covenant and by oath
The riches of his grace.
3
Pardon he speaks to contrite souls,
This is the joyful sound,
"Your sins shall sink beneath the sea,
And shall no more be found.
4
"And lest pollution should overspread
Your inward powers again;
My spirit shall bedew your souls,
Like purifying rain.
5
"Your stony hearts I Will take away,
That will not be refined;
And put within you, tender hearts,
To my blessed will inclined.
6
"On them my spirit shall engrave
The precepts of my law;
And by the gentle cords of love
Your willing souls shall draw."

We yield to thy commands;
Thou art our God, and we are thine,
In everlasting bands.

I SING my Savior's wondrous death,
He conquered when he fell;
"It Is finished," said his dying breath,
And shook the gates of hell.
2
"It Is finished," our Immanuel cries,
His sufferings then were done;
His kingdom then appeared to rise,
His victory was begun.
3
A person so divine was he,
Who yielded to be slain;
That he could give his life away,
And take his life again.
4
His cross a sure foundation laid,
For glory and renown!
As through the regions of the dead,
He passed to reach the crown.

And every tongue shall sing;

The conquest of our king.

Yes, thou art precious to my soul,
My treasure and my trust;
Jewels to thee are gaudy toys,

Not to my eyes is light so dear,
Nor friendship half so sweet.

And sheds its fragrance there;
The richest balm of all its wounds,
The cordial of its care.

JESUS is gone above the sky,
Where our weak senses reach him not;
And carnal objects court our eye,
To thrust our Savior from our thought.

How weak our faith and hope might prove;
And to refresh our minds he gave
This kind memorial of his love.

With his own flesh and dying blood;
We on the rich provision feed,
And taste the wine and bless our God.

And earth grow less in our esteem;
Christ and his love fill every thought,
And faith and hope be fixed on him.

It Is to prepare our souls a place;
That we may dwell in heavenly light,
And live forever near his face.

And powers of hell unknown,
Put their most dreadful forms
Of rage and malice on,
We shall be safe, For Christ displays

And wait your maker's nod!

Hang on his firm decree;
He sits on no precarious throne,
Nor borrows leave to be.

Before his throne, a volume lies,
With all the fates of men;
With every angel's form and size,
Drawn by the eternal pen.
4
His providence unfolds the book,
And makes his counsels shine;
Each opening leaf, and every stroke,
Fulfils some kind design.

Here he exalts neglected worms,
To sceptres and a crown;
And then, the following page he turns,
And treads the monarch down.

No creature asks the reason why,
Nor God the reason gives;
No favorite angel dares to pry,
Between the folded leaves.

My fate with curious eyes;
What gloomy lines are writ for me,
Or what bright scenes may rise.

May I but find my name,
Recorded, in some humble place,
Beneath my Lord, the Lamb.

Where sense and reason fail;

To sheltering caverns s^y;
And justly dread the vengeful fate,
Which thunders through the sky.

Protected by that hand, whose law
The threatening storms obey,
Intrepid virtue smiles secure,
And in the blaze of day.

In the thick cloud's tremendous gloom,
The lightning's horrid glare,
It views the same all gracious power,
Which breathes the vernal air.

Through nature's ever varying scene,
By different ways pursued;
The one eternal end of heaven
Is universal good.
5
With like beneficent effect,
Over flaming either glows;
As when it tunes the linnet's voice,
And blushes in the rose.
6
When through creation's vast expanse,
The last dread thunders roll;
Untune the concord of the spheres,
And shake the guilty soul;

Unmoved, may we the final storm
Of jarring worlds survey;
That ushers in the tranquil morn,
Of everlasting day.

Deep as our helpless miseries are,
And boundless as our sins.

Stand open night and day;
We humbly seek that rich supply,
That drives our wants away.

And slowly her resentments rise;
Soon she forgets the greatest wrong,
And soon the angry passion dies.

She envies none their better state,
But makes her neighbor's bliss her own;
Nor vaunts herself with mind elate,
But still a modest air puts on.

Her neighbor's infamy and ill
To her, no entertainment give,
She Is pleased to see him prosper still,
And still in good repute to live.

And will forever brightly burn;
When hope shall in enjoyment die,
And faith to intuition turn.

The armies of the Lord prevail;
In vain they rage, in vain they boast,
Their courage sinks, their weapons fail*

Down to the earth was Satan thrown,
Down to the earth his legions fell;
Then was the trump of triumph blown
And shook the dreadfu^ deeps of hell.

Behold the great accuser cast,

Love suffers long with patient eye
Nor is provoked in haste;
She lets the present inj'ry die

Malice and rage, those fires of hell,
She quenches with her tongue;
Hopes and believes and thinks no ill,
Though she endures the wrong.
4
She never desires nor seeks to know
The scandals of the time;
Nor looks with pride on those below
Nor envies those who climb.
5
She lays her own advantage by
To seek her neighbor's good;
So God's own son came down to die,
And save us by his blood.

There faith and hope are known no more
But Saints forever love.

Though to their hurt they swear;
Constant and just to all they speak,
For God and angels hear.

Still with their lips, their hearts agree,
Nor flattering words devise:
They know the God of truth can see
Through every false disguise.
4
They hate the appearance of a lie
In all the shapes it wears;

Eternal life is theirs.

Lo, from afar the Lord descends
And brings the judgment down;
He bids his saints, his faithful friends,
Rise and possess their crown.

For Jesus never dies.

But Christ our life shall come;
And by his mighty power shall raise
Our bodies from the tomb.

1
LIFE is a span, a fleeting hour,
How soon the vapor flies!
Man is a tender transient flower
That in the blooming dies.
2
Death spreads, like winter, frozen arms
And beauty smiles no more;
Where, now are fled those rising charms
Which pleased our eyes before?
3
The once loved form now cold and dead
Each mournful thought employs,
And nature weeps her comforts fled
And withered all her joys.
4
But wait the interposing gloom
And lo! stern winter flies!
And dressed in beauty's fairest bloom,
The flowery tribes arise.
5
Hope looks beyond the bounds of time,
When, what we now deplore
Shall rise in full immortal prime,
And bloom, to fade no more.
6
Then cease, fond nature, dry thy tears,
Religion points on high;
There everlasting spring appears,
And joys that never die.

LIFE is the time to serve the Lord,
The time t'insure the great reward;
And whilst the lamp holds out to burn,

Life is the hour which God has given,
To 'scape from hell and fly to heaven;

3
The living know that they must die,
But all the dead forgotten lie;
Their memory and their sense are gone,
Alike unknowing and unknown.

Their envy buried in the dust;
They have no share in all that is done,
Beneath the circuit of the sun.

In the cold grave to which we haste:
For no repentance can be found,
Nor faith, nor hope, beneath the ground.

Should wrath divine in dreadful storms,

Descend to crush rebellious worms!

In hope serene, my soul shall rest;
Nor storms nor dangers reach me there,

For goodness so divine.

Includes our rising race.

Shall own their father's God,
To latest times thy blessing share,
And sound thy praise abroad.

Hymn CLXIV. Long Meter. Folly cured by Affliction.

LOW at thy gracious feet I bend,
My God, my everlasting friend,
Permit the claim, O let thine ear,
My humble suit indulgent hear.
2
Lord, thou have bid me seek thy face,
And ask of thee, thy promised grace;
O may thy favor, bliss divine!
With fuller, clearer radiance shine.
3
But, O my heart, reflect with shame,
Can I prefer so bold a claim?
Conscious how often I have strayed,
By empty vanities betrayed.
4
How often, ungrateful to my God,
Have trifles called my thoughts abroad!
Till heavenly pity saw me roam,
And bade affliction bring me home.
5
And when the snares of earth were broke,
By kind affliction's needful stroke,
Have not I owned with humble praise
That just and right are all his ways?
6
Yes, gracious God, before thy throne,
My vileness and thy love I own;
O let that love with beams divine,
Forgiving, healing, round me shine.
7
When ever ungrateful to my God,
This heedless heart requires the rod,
Thy arm supporting, I implore,
The hand that chastens, can restore.

O may the kind conviction prove,
A (...) of thy paternal love;
Wean me from earth, from sin refine,
And make my heart entirely thine.

To our believing eyes!
The earth and seas are past away
And the old rolling skies!

The new Jerusalem comes down,
Adorned with shining grace.

Removes his blessed abode;

And death itself shall die."

Hymn CLXVI. Common Meter. A living and a dead Faith.
1
MISTAKEN souls, that dream of heaven,
And make their empty boast,
Of inward joys and sins forgiven,
Whilst they are slaves to lust;
2
Vain are our fancies, airy flights,
If faith be cold and dead;
None but a living power unites
To Christ the living head.
3
It Is faith that changes all the heart,
It Is faith that works by love;
That bids all sinful joys depart,
And lifts the thoughts above.
4
It Is faith that conquers earth and hell,
By a celestial power;
This is the grace that shall prevail,
In the decisive hour.
5
Faith must obey our father's will
As well as trust his grace;
A pardoning God is jealous still,
For his own holiness*
6
When from the curse he ^ets us free,
He makes our natures clean;
Nor would he send his Son to be
The minister of sin.
7
His spirit fills our hearts with love
And seals our peace with God*
With cheerful steps our feet shall move
Along the heavenly road.

MY dear redeemer, and my Lord,
I read my duty in thy word;
But in thy life thy law appears
Drawn out in living characters.
2
Such was thy piety and zeal
Thy deference to thy father's will;
Thy love and meekness, so divine,
I would transcribe and make them mine.
3
Cold mountains and the midnight air
Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer;
The desert thy temptations knew,
Thy conflict and thy victory too.

Be thou my pattern, make me bear
More of thy gracious image here;
Then God, the judge, shall own my name
Among the followers of the Lamb.

1
MY God, permit me not to be
A stranger to myself and thee;
Amidst ten thousand thoughts I rove,
Forgetful of my highest love.
2
Why should my passions mix with earth
And thus degrade my heavenly birth?
Why should I cleave to things below,
And let my God, my Savior go?
3
Call me away from flesh and sense,
Thy sovereign word can draw me thence,
I would obey the voice divine
And all inferior joys resign.

Be earth, with all her scenes, withdrawn,
Let noise and vanity be gone;
In secret silence of the mind
My heaven and there my God I find.

As nature could desire?
To higher joys than nature gives,
My nobler views aspire.

Its grateful tribute would impart;

I sink to earth, and lose the skies;
Yet I may still thy grace implore,
And low in dust, thy name adore.

O let thy grace my heart inspire,
And raise each languid, weak desire;
Thy grace, which condescends to meet
The sinner prostrate at thy feet.

With humble fear let love unite,
And mix devotion with delight;
Then shall thy name be all my joy,
Thy praise my constant, blessed employ.

With harmony and praise and love;

Looks kindly down on mortal things.
O let thy grace guide every song,
And fill my heart and tune my tongue;
Then shall the strains harmonious flow,
And heavenly joy begin below.

Ah vile ungrateful heart!

True pleasure, peace and rest:
When absent from my Lord, I live,
Unsatisfied, unblest.

My wandering soul restores:
He bids the mourning heart partake:
The pardon it implores.
O whilst I breathe to thee, my Lord,
The penitential sigh;
Confirm the kind the pardoning word
With pity in thine eye.

Rejoice to seek thy face,
And grateful own how kind, how sweet,

Yet, O the patience of my God,
Thy thunder silent lies.

This rebel heart no more withstands
But yields to sovereign grace.

The object of his love.

In vain this heavenly grace;

Producing holiness.

Hymn CLXXVII. Common Meter. Marriage.
1
MYSTERIOUS rite! by heaven ordained
This sacred truth to prove,
The bliss which mortals here enjoy
Must flow from virtuous love.
2
Though made by God's almighty hand
And in his image formed;
Yet Adam knew no happiness
Till love his bosom warmed.
3
Eden with all its beauteous groves
And fruits of richest taste,
To one for social bliss designed
Was but a lonely waste.
4
But when his lovely bride appeared
In native graces dressed,
The latent spark burst into flame
And love inspired his breast.
5
What wise provision have thou made,
Great parent of mankind,
That all thine offspring may enjoy
The bliss for them designed!

In bonds of virtuous love;
And whilst we live in peace below,
Prepare for bliss above.

And call our own, in vain,
Are but short favors borrowed now,
To be repaid again.

It Is God who lifts our comforts high
Or sinks them to the grave,
He gives, and blessed be his name,
He takes but what he gave.

Peace, all our angry passions then!

Be silent at his sovereign will,
And every murmur die.

And be the breathings of my heart
Dependence and desire.

Hymn CXCI. Common Meter. Winter.
1
NOW winter throws his icy chains
Encircling nature round:
How bleak, how comfortless the plains,
With verdure lately crowned!
2
The sun withdraws his vital beams
And light and warmth depart;
And drooping, lifeless nature seems
An emblem of my heart.
3
My heart, where mental winter reigns,
In night's dark mantle clad,
Confined in cold inactive chains
How desolate and sad!
4
Ever long the sun with genial ray
Shall cheer the mourning earth;
And blooming flowers and verdure gay
Renew their annual birth.
5
So, if my soul's bright sun impart
His all-enliv'ning smile,
The vital ray shall cheer my heart,
Till then, a frozen soil.
6
Then faith, and hope, and love, shall rise
Renewed to lively bloom,
And breathe accepted to the skies
Their humble, sweet perfume.
7
Great source of light, thy beams display,
My drooping joys restore,
And guide me to the seats of day
Where winter frowns no more.

Hymn CXCII. Common Meter. Charity.
1
O CHARITY, thou heavenly grace,
All tender, soft and kind!
A friend to all the human race,
To all that is good inclined!
2
The man of charity extends
To all, his liberal hand;
His kindred, neighbors, foes and friends
His pity may command.
3
He aids the poor in their distress,
He hears when they complain,
With tender heart delights to bless,
And lessen all their pain.
4
The sick, the prisoner, poor and blind,
And all the sons of grief,
In him a benefactor find,
He loves to give relief.
5
It Is love that makes religion sweet,
It Is love that makes us rise,
With willing mind and ardent feet,
To yonder happy skies.
6
Then let us all in love abound,
And charity pursue,
Thus shall we be with glory crowned,
And love as angels do.

Hymn CXCIII. Long Meter. Longing for Heaven.
1
O COULD I soar to worlds above,
That blessed state of peace and love!
How gladly would I mount and fly
On angels' wings to joys on high!
2
But ah, still longer must I stay,
Ere darksome night is changed to day;
More crosses, sorrows, conflicts bear,
Exposed to trials, pains and care.
3
Well, let these troubles still abound,
Let thorns and briars fill the ground;
Let storms and tempests dreadful come
Till I arrive at heaven my home.
4
My father knows what road is best
And how to lead to peace and rest;
To him I cheerful give my all,
Go where he leads and wait his call.
5
When he commands my soul away
Not kingdoms then shall tempt my stay;
With rapture I shall wake and rise
To join my friends above the skies.
PROUD.
Hymn CXCIV. Common Meter. The universal Extent of Christ's Kingdom.
1
OVER mountain tops, the mount of God,
In latter days shall rise;
Above the summits of the hills,
And draw the wondering eyes.
2
To this the joyful nations round,
All tribes and tongues shall flow;
Up to the mount of God they say,
And to his house, we'll go.
3
The beams that shine from Zion's hill
Shall lighten every land;
The king, who reigns in Salem's towr's,
Shall the whole world command.
4
Among the nations he shall judge,
His judgments, truth shall guide;
His scepter shall protect the just,
And crush the sinner's pride.
5
No war shall rage, nor hostile strife,
Disturb those h^ppy years;
To plough-shares men shall beat their swords,
To pruning-hocks their spears.
6
No longer, hosts encountering hosts,
Shall croads of slain deplore;
They Will lay the martial trumpet by
And study war no more.

O GOD, my Father, I adore
That all-commanding name;
It will my soul to life restore,
And kindle all my flame.
2
Entire, I bow at thy commands,
My filial homage pay;
With heart and life, with tongue and hands,
I Will cheerfully obey.
3
I Will wilfully no more transgress
As I too often have done;
But every sinful though it suppress,
Each sinful action shun.

Each day I live, I Will seek with care,
My Father, well to please,
And in this course will persevere
By thine assisting grace.
5
Thus will I my relation claim,
And call myself thy son,
And whilst I bear the glorious name,
My father's rights will own.

I will; but thou must strength impart
This promise to fulfill;
Lord, write thy law upon my heart
That I may do thy will.
Hymn CXCVI. Long Meter. Brotherly Love.
1
O GOD, our father and our King,
Of all we have, or hope, the spring;
Send down thy spirit from above,
And fill our hearts with holy love.
2
May we from every act abstain,
That hurts, or gives our neighbor pain,
And every secret wish suppress,
That would abridge his happiness.
3
Still may we feel our hearts inclined,
To act the friend to all mankind;
Still seek their safety, health and ease,
Their virtue and eternal peace.
4
With pity may our breast overflow,
When we behold a wretch in woe;
And bear a sympathising part
With all who are of heavy heart.
5
Let love in all our conduct shine,
An image fair, though faint of thine;
Thus may we his disciples prove
Who came to manifest thy love.

Silver and gold her happy dress,
Truth, meekness, love and righteousness;
Holy without and pure within,
Free from the guilt of reigning sin.

Her laws and doctrines just and right,
Her priests, the ministers of light;
Her order from the courts above,
And all her service done in love.

Her head and ruler is the Lord;
Her sons and daughters all agree
And live in peace and charity.

Her journey is the holy way
Which leads to everlasting day,
And her eternal sure reward
A crown of glory with the Lord.

Hymn CXCIX. Common Meter. The Ways of Wisdom.
1
O HAPPY is the man who hears
Instruction's faithful voice;
And who, celestial wisdom makes,
His early, only choice.
2
Her treasures are of more esteem
Than east or west unfold;
And her rewards more precious are
Than all their mines of gold.
3
In her right hand she holds to view
A length of happy days;
Riches, with splendid honors joined,
Her left hand full displays.
4
She guides the young with innocence
In pleasure's paths to tread;
A crown of glory she bestows
Upon the hoary head.
5
According as her labors rise
So her rewards increase;
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
And all her paths are peace.

O LORD, my best desires fulfill,
And help me to resign
Life, health and comfort to thy will,
And make thy pleasure mine.

Whose love forbids my fears?
Or tremble at the gracious hand
That wipes away my tears!
3
No, let me rather freely yield
What most I prize to thee;
Who never have a gift withheld,
Nor wilt withhold, from me.

And brighten all the scene.

To plead her humble claim,
And ask the bliss those words impart,

Thy boundless love surveys,
And fired with grateful zeal prepares
Her sacrifice of praise.

When evening slumbers press my eyes,
With thy protection blessed,
In peace and safety I commit
My weary limbs to rest.

My spirit in thy hands secure
Fears no approaching ill;
For whether waking or asleep
Thou, Lord, art with me still.

Then will I daily to the world
Thy wondrous acts proclaim;
Whilst all with me shall praises sing
And bless thy sacred name.

And thee alone wilt praise, to whom
Eternal praise is due.

Hymn CCII. Common Meter. Resignation, or Good out of Evil.
1
O RESIGNATION, heavenly power,
Our warmest thoughts engage;
Thou art the safest guide of youth,
The sole support of age.
2
Teach us the hand of love divine
In evils to discern;
It Is the first lesson which we need
The latest which we learn.
Is resignation's lesson hard?
On trial we shall find,
It makes us give up nothing more
Than anguish of the mind.
4
Resign, and all the pain of life
That moment we remove;
The heavy load of grief and care
Devolves on ONE above.
5
He bids us lay our burden down
On his almighty hand;
Supports our feeble frame, and makes
Our weary feet to stand.
6
What though we are swallowed in the deep,
And billows round us roar?
Like Jonah thou will safely keep,
And guide us to the shore.
7
Thy will is welcome, let it wear
Its most tremendous form;
Though tempests rise, we know that thou
Can save us by the storm.

Hymn CCIII. Common Meter. Desire of Communion with God.
1
O THAT I knew the secret place
Where I might find my God!
I Would spread my wants before his face
And pour my woes abroad.
2
I Would tell him how my sins arise,
What sorrows I sustain;
How strength decays and comfort dies
And leaves my heart in pain.
3
He knows what arguments I Would take
To wrestle with my God;
I Would plead for his own mercy's sake,
And plead my Savior's blood.
4
My God will pity my complaints,
And heal my broken bones;
He knows the meaning of his saints,
The language of their groans*
5
Arise, my soul, from deep distress,
And banish every fear;
He calls me to his throne of grace,
To spread my sorrows there.

Hymn CCIV. Long Meter. On the Dangerous Sickness of a Minister.
1
O THOU, before whose gracious throne
We bow our suppliant spirits down;
Thou know the anxious cares we feel,
And all our trembling lips would tell.
2
Thou only can assuage our grief,
And give our sorrowing hearts relief.
In mercy then, thy servant spare,
Nor turn aside thy people's prayer.
3
Avert thy desolating stroke,
Nor smite the shepherd of the flock;
Restore him, sinking to the grave,
Stretch out thine arm, make haste to save.
4
Bound to each soul by tender ties,
In every heart his image lies;
Thy pitying aid, O God, impart,
Nor rend him from each bleeding heart.
5
But if our supplications fail,
And prayers and tears cannot prevail!
Be thou his strength, be thou his stay,
Support him through the gloomy way.
6
Around him may thy angels stand,
Waiting the signal of thy hand;
To bid his happy spirit rise
And bear him to their native skies.

The Christian's Resolution, founded on Jacob's Vow. Genesis xxviii.20.
1
O THOU, by whose all-bounteous hand,
Thy people still are fed;
Who through life's weary pilgrimage,
Have all our fathers led.
2
To thee, our humble vow we raise,
To thee, address our prayer;
And in thy kind, and faithful hand,
Deposit all our care.
3
If thou, through each perplexing path,
Wilt be our constant guide;
If thou will daily food supply,
And raiment wilt provide;
4
If thou will spread thy shield around,
Till all our wand'rings cease;
And at our father's safe abode
Our souls arrive in peace;
5
To thee, as to our covenant God,
Ourselves we will re^^^^;
And count that all on earth we have,
And even our life is thine.
Hymn CCVI. Common Meter. The Contrite Heart.
1
O THOU, whose tender mercy hears
Contrition's humble sigh,
Whose hand, indulgent, wipes the tears
From sorrow's weeping eye.
2
See! low before thy throne of grace,
A wretched wanderer mourn,
Have thou not bid me seek thy face?
Have thou not said, return?
3
And shall my guilty fears prevail,
To drive me from thy feet?
O let not this dear refuge fail,
This only safe retreat.
4
Absent from thee, my guide, my light.
Without one cheering ray,
Through dangers, fears and gloomy night,
How desolate my way!
5
O shine on this benighted heart,
With beams of mercy shine;
And let thy healing voice impart
A taste of joys divine.
6
Thy presence only can bestow,
Delights which never cloy;
Be this my comfort here below,
And my eternal joy.

Hymn CCVII. Long Meter. The Importance of Time.
1
O TIME, how few thy value weigh,
How few will estimate a day!
Days, months and years are rolling on,
The soul neglected and undone.
2
In painful cares or empty joys
Our life its precious hours destroys;
Whilst death stands watching at our side,
Eager to stop the living tide.
3
Was it for this, ye mortal race,
Your maker gave you here a place?
Was it for this, his thought designed
The frame of your immortal mind?
4
For nobler cares, for joys sublime,
He fashioned all the sons of time;
Pilgrims on earth, but soon to be
The heirs of immortality.
5
This season of your being, know,
Is given to you, your seeds to sow;
Wisdom and folly's differing grain
In future worlds is bliss and pain.
6
Then let me every day review,
Idle or busy search it through;
And whilst probation's minutes last,
Let every day amend the past.

Hymn CCVIII. Common Meter. Prudence.
1
O IT IS a lovely thing to see,
A man of prudent heart!
Whose thoughts and lips and life agree
To act a useful part.
2
When envy, strife and wars begin
In little angry souls;
Mark how the sons of peace come in,
And quench the kindling coals.
3
Their minds are humble, mild and meek,
Nor does their anger rise;
Nor passion moves their lips to speak,
Nor pride exalts their eyes.
4
Their lives are prudence mixed with love,
Good works employ their day;
They join the serpent with the dove,
But cast the sting away.
5
Such was the savior of mankind,
Such pleasures he pursued;
His manners gentle and refined,
His soul divinely good.

Importunate Prayer. "Ask and ye shall receive." Matt. vii, 7. etc.
1
OUR father, throned above the sky,
To thee, our empty hands we spread.
Thy children, at thy footstool lie,
And ask thy blessings on their head.
2
Let mercy all our sins dispel,
As clouds before the solar beam,
Our souls from bondage and from hell
To liberty and life redeem.
3
With cheerful hope and filial fear,
In that august and precious name,
By thee ordained, we now draw near,
And would the promised blessing claim.
4
Does not an earthly parent hear
The cravings of his famished son?
Will he reject the filial prayer,
Or mock him with a cake of stone?
5
Our heavenly father, how much more
Will thy divine compassions rise;
And open thy unbounded store
To satisfy thy children's cries?
6
Yes we will ask, and seek and press
For gracious audience to thy seat,
Still hoping, waiting for success,
If persevering to entreat.
7
For Jesus in his faithful word
The patient supplicant has blessed,
And all thy saints with one accord
The prevalence of prayer attest.

And purchased with his blood!

Here wait, my warmest love;

Hymn CCXI. Hallelujah Meter. Christ seen of Angels.
1
O YE immortal throng,
Of angels round the throne,
Join with our feeble song,
And make the Savior known;
On earth ye knew, His wondrous grace;
His radiant face, In heaven ye view.
2
Ye saw the heaven-born child,
In human flesh arrayed;
How innocent and mild,
When in the manger laid!
And praise to God, And peace on earth,
For such a birth, Proclaimed aloud.
3
Ye in the wilderness,
Beheld the tempter spoiled,
Well known in every dress,
In every combat foiled;
Ye joined to crown, The victor's head,
When Satan fled, Before his frown.
4
Ye kept a silent guard,
Around his sleeping head;
Till the bright morn appeared,
Which waked him from the dead.
Then rolled the stone, And all adored,
Your rising Lord, With joy unknown.
5
When all arrayed in light,
The shining conqueror rode;
Ye hailed his rapturous flight,
Up to the throne of God.
And waved around, Your ardent wings,
And tuned your strings, Of noblest sound.
6
The warbling notes pursue,
And louder anthems raise;
Whilst mortals sound with you,
Their own redeemer's praise.
And thou, my soul, With equal flame,
His praise proclaim, Whilst ages roll.

PATIENCE, O what a grace divine,
Sent from the God of peace and love;
That leans upon its father's hand,
As through the wilds of life we rove.
2
By patience we serenely bear
The troubles of our mortal state;
And wait contented our discharge
Nor think our glory comes too late.
3
Though we in full sensation feel,
The weight, the wounds our God ordains;
We smile amidst our heaviest woes
And triumph in our sharpest pains.
4
O for this grace to aid us on,
And arm with fortitude the breast;
Till life's tumultuous voyage is over
We reach the port, of endless rest.
5
Faith into vision shall be brought,
Hope shall in full enjoyment die;
And patience in possession end
In the bright world of bliss on high.

Indulgent mercy bends;

Compared with what my sins deserve
How easy are my pains!

Great sovereign Lord I own thy hand,

And light from darkness raise;
Thus thou will change my grief to joy,
And turn my tears to praise.

Hymn CCXV. Common Meter. The Trials of Virtue.
1
PLACED on the verge of youth, my mind
Life's opening scene surveyed;
I viewed its ills of various kinds
Afflicted and afraid.
2
But chief my fear the dangers moved
That virtue's path enclose;
My heart the wise pursuit approved,
But oh, what toils oppose!
3
For see, while yet her unknown ways
With doubtful step I tread!
A hostile world its terrors raise,
Its snares delusive spread.
4
O how shall I with heart prepared
Those terrors learn to meet?
How from the thousand snares to guard
My inexperienc'd feet?
5
Let faith suppress each rising fear,
Each anxious doubt exclude;
My maker's will has placed me here,
A maker wise and good.
6
He to my every trial knows
Its just restraint to give;
Attentive to behold my woes,
And faithful to relieve.
7
Then why thus heavy, O my soul?
Say, why distrustful still,
Thy tho'ts with vain impatience roll
Over scenes of future ill?
8
Though griefs unnumber'd throng thee round
Still in thy God confide;
Whose finger marks the seas their bound,
And curbs the rolling ^ide.

1
PRAISE to God, immortal praise,
For the love that crowns our days,
Bounteous source of every joy,
Let thy praise our songs employ.
2
For the blessings of the field,
For the stores the gardens yield,
For the vine's exalted juice,
For the generous olive's use.
3
Flocks that whiten all the plain,
Yellow sheaves of ripened grain,
Clouds that drop their fattening dews,
Suns that temperate warmth diffuse;
4
All that s^^^ng with bounteous hand
Scatters over the smiling land:
All that liberal autumn pours
From her rich overflowing stores.
5
These to thee our God, we owe,
Source, whence all our blessings flow,
And for these our souls shall raise
Grateful vows and solemn praise.
6
Yet should rising whirlwinds tear
From its stem, the opening ear;
Should the fig-tree's blasted shoot
Drop its green untimely fruit;
7
Should the vine put forth no more
Nor the olive yield her store;
Though the sickening flocks should fall
And the herds desert the stall;
8
Yet to thee our souls shall raise
Grateful vows and solemn praise;
And when every blessing's flown
Love thee for thyself alone.

Hymn CCXVII. Long Meter. The Old and New Creation.
1
PRAISE to the Lord of boundless might
W^^^ uncreated glories bright;
His presence fills the world above
The eternal source of light and love.
2
This rising earth his eye beheld,
When in substantial darkness veiled;
The shapeless chaos, nature's womb,
Lay buried in eternal gloom.
3
"Let there be light," Jehovah said,
And light over all its face was spread;
The world arrayed in charms unknown
With all its newborn luster shone.
4
He sees the mind, obscured within
The shades of ignorance and sin;
And darts from heaven a vital ray
That changes darkness into day.
5
Shine, mighty God, with vigor shine
On this benighted heart of mine;
And let thy glories stand revealed
As in the Savior's face beheld.
6
My soul, revived by heaven-born day,
Thy radiant image shall display,
Whilst all my faculties unite
To praise the Lord who gives me light.

RAISE your triumphant songs

Its chief beloved chose,
And bade him raise our sinful race
From their abyss of woes.
3
His hand no thunder bears,
Nor terror clothes his brow;
No bolts to drive our guilty souls
To fiercer flames below.
4
But mercy filled the throne
Of the eternal sky,
When Christ was sent with pardon down
To rebels doomed to die.
5
Now, sinners, dry your tears,
Let hopeless sorrow cease;
Bow to the scepter of his love
And take the offered peace.

Lord we obey thy call,
We lay an humble claim,
To the salvation thou have wrought,
And love and praise thy name.

REMARK, my soul, the narrow bounds
Of the revolving year;
How swift the weeks complete their round!
How short the months appear!
2
So fast, eternity comes on,
And that important day;
When all that mortal life has done
God's judgment shall survey.
3
Yet like an idle tale we pass,
The swift advancing year;
And study artful ways to increase
The speed of its career.
4
Waken, O God, my careless heart,
Its great concern to see;
That I may act the christian part,
And give the year to thee.
5
So shall their course more grateful roll,
If future years arise;
Or this shall bear my waiting soul,
To joy beyond the skies.

SALVATION! O melodious sound

Salvation, that from God proceeds
And leads to God again!
2

From darkness, fire and chains;
Raised to a paradise of bliss
Where love with glory reigns!
3
But O, may a degenerate soul,
Sinful and weak as mine,
Presume to raise a trembling eye,
To blessings so divine?
4
The luster of so bright a scene
My feeble heart o'erbears;
And unbelief almost perverts
The promise into tears.
5
My Savior God, no voice but thine,
These dying hopes can raise;
Speak thy salvation to my soul,
And turn my tears to praise.

Transported shall proclaim;
And call on all the angelic harps,
To sound thy glorious name.

Rejoiced that we ourselves are thine.

Thy guardian care we trust;
That though it shall heal our bleeding hearts
When weeping over their dust.

Deserves it no regard?
2
I was his chief delight
His everlasting Son,
Before the first of all his works
Creation was begun.
3
Before the flying clouds,
Before the solid land;
Before the fields, before the floods,
I dwelt at his right hand.
4
When he adorned the skies,
And built them, I was there,
To order when the sun should rise,
And marshall every star.
5
When he poured out the sea,
And spread the flowing ^leep;
I gave the flood a firm decree
In its own bounds to keep.
6
Upon the empty air,
The earth was balanced well;
With joy I saw the mansion where
The sons of men should dwell.
7
My busy tho'ts at first
On their salvation ran;
Ere sin appeared, or Adam's dust,
Was fashioned to a man.
8
Then come, receive my grace,
Ye children, and be wise;
Happy the man that keeps my ways,
The man that shuns them dies.

Hymn CCXXIII. Common Meter. The Nativity of Christ.
1
"SHEPHERDS, rejoice, lift up your eyes,
And send your fears away;
News from the region of the skies,
Salvation's born to day.
2
"The Son of God, whom angels fear,
Comes down to dwell with you,
To day he makes his entrance here,
But not as monarchs do.
3
"No gold nor purple swaddling bands,
Nor royal shining things;
A manger for his cradle stands,
And holds the King of Kings.
4
"Go, shepherds, where the infant lies
And see his humble throne;
With tears of joy in all your eyes,
Go, shepherds, kiss the SON."
5
Thus Gabriel sang, and strait around
The heavenly armies throng,
They tune their harps to lofty sound,
And thus conclude the song.
6
"Glory to God, who reigns above,
Let peace surround the earth;
Mortals shall know their maker's love,
At their Redeemer's birth."
7
Lord, shall the angels have their songs,
And men no tunes to raise?
O may we lose these useless tongues,
When they forget to praise.
8
Glory to God who reigns above,
Who pitied us forlorn;
We join to sing our maker's love,
For there is a Savior born.

Hymn CCXXIV. Long Meter.
Faith in God in a Time of Distress. -- Habakuk, iii.17, 18.
1
SHOULD famine over the mourning field,
Extend her desolating reign;
Nor spring her blooming beauties yield,
Nor autumn swell the ripening grain.
2
Should lowing herds and bleating sheep
Around their famished master die;
And hope itself expiring weep,
Whilst life deplores its last supply.
3
Amidst the dark, the deathful scene,
If I can say, the Lord is mine;
The joy shall triumph over the pain,
And glory dawn, though life decline.
4
The God of my salvation lives,
My nobler life he will sustain;
His word immortal vigor gives,
Nor shall my hope or trust be vain.
5
Thy presence, Lord, can cheer my heart;
Though every earthly comfort die;
Thy love can bid my pain depart,
And raise my sacred pleasures high.
6
O let me hear thy blissful voice,
Inspiring life and joys divine,
The barren desert shall rejoice,
It Is paradise if thou be mine.

Hymn CCXXV. Common Meter.
Christ the Supreme Beauty. -- Isaiah, xxxiii 17.
1
SHOULD nature's charms to please the eye,
In sweet assemblage join,
All nature's charms would droop and die,
Jesus, compared with thine.
2
Vain were her fairest beams displayed,
And vain her blooming store;
Her brightness languishes to shade,
Her beauty is no more.
3
But ah, how far from mortal sight,
The Lord of glory dwells!
A veil of interposing night,
His radiant face conceals.
4
O could my longing spirit rise
On strong immortal wing;
And reach thy palace in the skies,
My Savior and my King!
5
There thousands worship at thy feet,
And there, (divine employ!)
The triumphs of thy love repeat,
In songs of endless joy.
6
Thy presence beams eternal day
Over all the blissful place;
Who would not drop this load of clay,
And die to see thy face?

Hymn CCXXVI. Long Meter. Faith in God's Names.
1
SING to the Lord, who loud proclaims,
His various and his saving names;
O may they not be heard alone,
But by our sure experience known.
2
The great Jehovah be adored,
The eternal, all sufficient Lord;
He through the world most high confessed,
By whom 'twas formed and is possessed.
3
Awake, our noblest powers to bless,
The God of Abr'ham, God of peace;
Now by a dearer title known,
Father and God of Christ his son.
4
Through every age, his gracious ear
Is open to his servants' prayer;
Nor can one humble soul complain
That he has sought his God in vain.
5
What unbelieving heart shall dare
In whispers to suggest a fear?
While still he owns his ancient name,
The same his power, his love the same,
6
To thee, our souls in faith arise,
To thee we lift expecting eyes;
And boldly through the desert tread,
For God will guard, where God shall lead.

Hymn CCXXVII. Common Meter. The Brazen Serpent.
1
SO did the Hebrew prophet raise
The brazen serpent high;
The wounded felt immediate ease,
The sick forbore to die.
2
"Look upward in the expiring hour
And live," the prophet cries,
But Christ performs a nobler cure,
When faith lifts up her eyes.
3
High on the cross, the Savior hung,
High in the heavens he reigns;
Here sinners by the serpent stung
Look and forget their pains.
4
When God's own son is lifted up,
A dying world revives;
The Jew beholds the blessed hope,
The expiring Gentile lives.

Hymn CCXXVIII. Long Meter. On the Death of a Child.
1
SO fades the lovely blooming flower,
Frail, smiling solace of an hour!
So soon our transient comforts fly,
And pleasure only blooms to die!
2
To certain trouble we are born,
Hope to rejoice, but sure to mourn;
Ah wretched effort! sad relief!
To plead necessity of grief!
3
Is there no kind, no lenient art
To heal the anguish of the heart?
To ease the heavy load of care
Which nature must, but dreads to bear?
4
Can reason's dictates be obeyed?
Too weak, alas, her strongest aid!
O let religion then be nigh,
Her consolations never die.
5
Her powerful aid supports the soul,
And nature owns her kind control;
Whilst she unfolds the sacred page,
Our fiercest griefs resign their rage.
6
Then gentle patience smiles on pain,
And dying hope revives again;
Hope wipes the tear from sorrow's eye,
And faith points upward to the sky.
7
The promise guides her ardent flight,
And joys, unknown to sense, invite,
Those blissful regions to explore,
Where pleasure blooms, to fade no more.

So let our works and virtues shine
To prove the doctrine all divine.
2
Thus shall we best proclaim abroad
The honors of our Savior God;
When the salvation reigns within,
And grace subdues the power of sin.
3
Our flesh and sense must be denied,
Passion and envy, lust and pride;
Whilst justice, temperance, truth and love,
Our inward piety approve.

Religion bears our spirits up
Whilst we expect that blessed hope,
The bright appearance of the Lord,
And faith stands leaning on his word.

When once the prison-walls are broke
In which it is now confined.

Such are the hopes that cheer the just,
These hopes their God has given;

We long and pant to see;
We would be absent from the flesh,
And present Lord with thee.

1
THE days how few, how short the year*
Of man's so rapid race!
Each leaving, as it swiftly flies,
A shorter in its place.
2
They who the longest lease enjoy
Have told us with a sigh;
That to be born, seems little more
Than to begin to die.
3
Our hearts are fastened to this world
By strong and numerous ties;
But every sorrow cuts a string
And urges us to rise.
4
When heaven would kindly set us free
And earth's enchantment end;
It takes the most effectual way,
And robs us of a friend.
5
If we presume to counteract
A sympathetic God;
Have we not cause to fear the stroke
Of his avenging rod?
6
If we resign, our patience makes
His rod a gentle wand;
If not, it darts a serpent's sting
Like that in Moses' hand.

Not even a sparrow yields its breath

Thy care, great God, sustains them all;
When urged by hunger's powerful call,
Expectant of the known supply
To thee, they lift the asking eye.

Shall raise the morn and evening song;
And ^ong as breath inspires my frame
The wonders of thy love proclaim.

Hymn CCXXXIII. Common Meter. Sinai and Sion.
1
THE God who once to Israel spoke
From Sinai's top in fire and smoke;
In gentler strains of gospel grace
Invites us now to seek his face.
2
He wears no terrors on his brow,
He speaks in love from Sion now;
It is the voice of Jesus' blood
That calls us wanderers back to God.
3
God's servant Moses quaked and feared,
When Sinai's thundering law he heard;
But gospel grace with accents mild
Speaks to the sinner as a child.
4
Hark! how from Calvary it sounds,
From the redeemer's bleeding wounds:
"Pardon and grace I freely give,
Then, sinner, look to me and live."
5
What other arguments can move,
The heart that slights a savior's love?
O may that heavenly power be felt
And cause the stony heart to melt.
6
Else how shall we thy presence bear,
When as our judge thou shall appear;
When slighted love to wrath shall turn,
And the whole earth like Sinai burn.

And endless life are given;
And the rich blood that Jesus shed,
To raise the soul to heaven.

Ye hungry poor, who long have strayed,
In sin's dark mazes, come,
Come from the hedges and highways
And grace will find you room.

Thousands of souls in glory now
Were fed and feasted here;
And thousands more, still on the way
Around the board appear.

Yet is his house and heart so large,
That thousands more may come;

Oe'r-fill the spacious room.

Nor weak excuses frame;
Come take your places at the feast,
And bless the founder's name.

But peace and truth and love,

Descending from above.

Moses a faithful servant stood,
But Christ a faithful son.

Then to his new commands
Be strict obedience paid;
Over all his father's house he stands
The sovereign and the head.

The man who durst despise

Behold how terribly he dies
For his presumptuous fault.

On that rebellious race;
Who hate to hear when Jesus calls,
And dare resist his grace.

The Reward of Faithful Servants. Daniel xii.3.
1
THERE is a glorious world on high,
Resplendent with eternal day;
Faith views the blissful prospect nigh,
And God's own word reveals the way.
2
There shall the servants of the Lord
With never fading luster shine;
Surprising honor! large reward,
Conferred on man by love divine!
3
How happy then the truly wise,
Who learn and keep the sacred road!
How happy they whom heaven employs,
To turn rebellious men to God!
4
To win them from the fatal way,
Where erring folly thoughtless roves;
And that blessed righteousness display,
Which Jesus wrought, and God approves!
5
The shining firmament shall fade,
And sparkling stars resign their light;
But these shall know nor change nor shade,
Forever fair, forever bright.
6
No fancied joy beyond the sky,
No fair delusion is revealed;
It Is God that speaks, who cannot lie,
And all his word must be fulfilled.
7
And shall not these cold hearts of ours,
Be kindled at the glorious view?
Come, Lord, awake our active powers,
Our feeble, dying strength renew.
8
On wings of faith and strong desire
O may our spirits daily rise;
And reach at last the shining choir,
In the bright mansions of the skies.

That forms thee fit for heaven;
And, as an earnest of the place,
Has his own spirit given.

We walk by faith of joys to come,
Faith lives upon his word;
But whilst the body is our home,
We Are absent from the Lord.

But we had rather see;
We would he absent from the flesh,

1
THE Savior comes! no outward pomp
Bespeaks his presence nigh;
No earthly beauties in him shine
To draw the carnal eye.
2
Fair as a blooming, tender flower
Amidst the desert grows;
So slighted and de^pis'd by man
The heavenly Savior rose.
3
They held him as condemned by heaven
An outcast from his God;
While for their sins he groaned and bled
Beneath his father's rod.
4
With sinners in the dust he lay,
The rich a grave supplied;
Unspotted was his blameless life,
Unstained by sin he died.
5
His soul rejoicing shall behold
The purchase of his pain;
And every sinner by him saved
Shall bless Messiah's reign.
6
He died to bear the guilt of men
That sin might be forgiven;
He lives to bless them and defend
And plead their cause in heaven.

On fiery wheels they rode;
And strangely washed their raiment white
In Jesu's dying blood.

Now they approach a spotless God,
And bow before his throne;
Their warbling harps and sacred songs
Adore the holy one.

The unveiled glories of his face,
Among his saints reside;
While the rich treasure of his grace,
Sees all their wants supplied.
5
Tormenting thirst shall leave their souls,
And hunger flee as fast;
The fruit of life's immortal tree,
Shall be their sweet repast.

Where living fountains rise;
And love divine shall wipe away,

And utter forth a glorious voice,
Forever singing as they shine,

Reserved until the final day!
Hymn CCLIV. Common Meter. Divine Goodness to Man.
1
THY wisdom, power and goodness Lord,
In all thy works appear;
But man, thy bounties shall record,
For thy distinguished care.
2
From thee, the breath of life we drew,
That breath thy power maintains;
Thy tender mercy ever new
Our brittle frame sustains.
^
Yet nobler gifts demand our praise,
Of reason's light possessed;
By revelation's brighter rays
Still more divinely blessed.
4
Thy providence our constant guard,
When threatening woes impend,
Will either threatening dangers ward,
Or timely succors lend.
5
On us thy providence has shone
With its propitious rays;
O let our lips and lives make known
Thy goodness and thy praise.
6
All bounteous Lord, thy grace impart,
O teach us to improve
Thy gifts with ever grateful heart,
And crown them with thy love.

Hymn CCLV. Short Meter. The Voice of Wisdom.
1
IT IS wisdom's earnest cry
Wisdom, the voice of God
To young and old, the low and high,
She speaks his will abroad.
2
Within the human breast
Her strong monitions plead,
She thunders her divine protest,
Against the unrighteous deed.
3
Within the holy place
She calls with open arms;
"How long, ye fools, will you embrace
Folly's deceiving charms?
4
The race of men I love;
In mercy I chastise;
Severely faithful, I reprove;
Hear, mortals, and be wise.
5
My doors are open wide
My table spread within;
Come then, ye simple, turn aside,
And leave the paths of sin.
6
My joys, unsensual taste,
Come drink of wisdom's wine,
No sorrow poisons my repast,
The banquet is divine.
7
My ways are ways of peace,
My pleasures never cloy;
The bliss I give will never cease
But lead to endless joy."

TO God the only wise,
Our Savior and our king,
Let all the saints below the skies
Their humble praises bring.

It Is his alm^ghty love,
His counsel and his care,
Preserves us safe from sin and death
And every hurtful snare.
3
He will present our souls
Unblemished and complete,
Before the glory of his face,
With joys divinely great.
4
Then all the chosen seed
Shall meet around the throne;
Shall bless the conduct of his grace
And make his wonders known.

To our Redeemer God,
Wisdom with power belongs,
Immortal crowns of majesty
And everlasting songs.

Hymn CCLVII. Long Meter. Divine Preservation.
1
TO heaven my grateful soul ascends
On God alone for help depends;
His hand is my perpetual guard
His grace the source of my reward.
2
The spreading skies by power divine
In all their radiant glories shine;
From his command, the solid earth
And all its stores derived their birth.
3
Inspected by his piercing eyes
No threatening snares my soul surprise;
My faithful guardian never sleeps,
My trembling feet he safely keeps.
4
Protected by his powerful arm
Should dreadful scenes our souls alarm,
Our lives are safe; his heavenly care
Defends us still from every snare.
5
He guides our feet, directs our way,
His morning smiles enliven day;
And when the sun withdraws the light
His presence cheers the shades of night.

Hymn CCLVIII. Long Meter. Communion with Christ.
1
TO Jesus, our exalted Lord,
That name, in heaven and earth adored,
Fain would our hearts and voices raise,
A cheerful song of sacred praise.
2
But all the notes which mortals know,
Are weak and languishing and low;
Far, far above our humble songs,
The theme demands immortal tongues.
3
Yet whilst around his board we meet,
And worship at his sacred feet:
O let our warm affections move,
In glad returns of grateful love.
4
Yes, Lord, we love and we adore,
But long to know and love thee more;
And whilst we taste the bread and wine,
Desire to feed on joys divine.
5
Let faith our feeble senses aid,
To see thy wondrous love displayed;
Thy broken flesh, thy bleeding veins,
Thy dreadful agonizing pains.
6
Let humble penitential woe,
With painful, pleasing anguish flow;
And thy forgiving love impart,
Life, hope and joy, to every heart.

Hymn CCLIX. Long Meter. The Heavenly Conqueror.
1
TO Jesus our victorious Lord,
The praises of our lives belong;
Forever be his name adored,
The subject of each thankful song.
2
Enslaved by sin, beset by foes,
Undone and perishing, we lay;
His pity melted over our woes,
To save the trembling, dying prey.
3
He fought, he conquered though he fell,
Whilst with his last expiring breath,
He triumphed over the powers of hell,
And by his dying, vanquished death.
4
Now on his father's throne he reigns,
And all the tuneful choir above,
Resound i^ high, immortal strains,
The praises of victorious love.
5
Though still surviving foes arise,
Temptations, sins and doubts appear;
And pain our hearts and fill our eyes,
With many a groan and many a tear;
6
Still shall we fight and still prevail,
In our almighty leader's name;
His strength, whenever our spirits fail,
Shall all our active powers inflame.
7
Immortal honors wait above,
To crown the dying conqueror's b^ow;
And endless peace, and joy, and love,
For the short war sustained below.

Then took the cup and blessed the wine,

Hymn CCLXI. Common Meter. The New Birth.
VAIN are the hopes the sons of men,
On their own works have built;
The carnal mind is all unclean,
And all its actions guilt.
2
Let Jew and Gentile stop their mouth,
Without a murmuring word;
And the whole race of Adam stand,
Guilty, before the Lord.
3
In vain we ask God's righteous law,
To justify us now;
When, to convince and to condemn,
Is all the law can do.
4
Not all the outward forms on earth,
Nor rites that Moses gave,
Nor will of men, nor blood, nor birth,
The guilty race can save.
5
God's spirit, like a heavenly wind,
Blows on the sons of flesh;
Changes the heart, renews the mind,
And forms the man afresh;
6
Our quickened souls awake and rise,
From the long sleep of death;
To heavenly things we turn our eyes,
And praise employs our breath.
7
The sins and folli^^ of our mind*
Are crucified and dead;
By holy love our souls are joined,
To Christ our living head.

UNVEIL thy bosom, faithful tomb,
Take this new treasure, to thy trust*

Invade thy bounds; no mortal woes,

Whilst angels watch its soft repose.

So Jesus slept; God's dying Son,
Past through the grave and blessed the bed,
Then rest, dear saint, till from his throne,

Whilst yet I draw my breath,

Hymn CCLXVI. Common Meter. Gratitude for Divine Mercies. Part I.
1
WHEN all thy mercies, O my God,
My rising soul surveys,
Transported with the view, I Am lost
In wonder, love and praise.
2
Thy providence my life sustained
And all my wants redressed,
When in the silent womb I lay
Or hung upon the breast.
3
To all my weak complaints and cries
Thy mercy lent an ear,
Er'e yet my feeble thoughts had learned
To form themselves in prayer.
4
Unnumber'd comforts on my soul,
Thy tender care bestowed;
Before my infant heart conceived
From whom those comforts flowed.
5
When in the slippery paths of youth
With heedless steps I ran,
Thine arm unseen conveyed me safe
And led me up to man.
6
Through hidden dangers toils, and death,
It gently cleared my way;
And through the pleasing scenes of vice
Where thousands go astray.

Hymn CCLXVII. Common Meter. Gratitude for Divine Mercies. Part II.
1
WHEN pale with sickness, often have thou
With health renewed my face;
And when in sin and sorrow sunk
Revived my soul with grace.
2
Thy bounteous hand with worldly good
Has made my cup run over;
And in a kind and faithful friend
Have doubled all my store.
3
Ten thousand, thousand precious gifts
My daily thanks employ,
Nor is the least, a cheerful heart
That tastes those gifts with joy.
4
Through every period of my life
Thy goodness I Will pursue;
And after death, in distant worlds
The glorious theme renew.
5
When nature fails, and day and night
Divide the time no more,
My ever grateful heart, O Lord,
Thy mercy shall adore.
6
Through all eternity to thee
A joyful song I Will raise;
For O, eternity's too short
To utter all thy praise.

Soft music hails the lovely spring
And woods and fields rejoice.

Bid verdure, beauty, fragrance rise,
And fix the roving thought.

With gratitude and love,

Beyond expression kind,

Spring, blooming in my heart!

Glad nature's cheerful song:

And taste the promised bliss;

Dark horror sits upon his brow!
And victory waits his arms!

And clothed in thine immortal bloom,
Attend thee to the skies.

Can ever dissolve the sacred bands.

With ardent strong desire,
And still, through all this desert road,
To taste thy grace, aspire;

My folly he pursued;
My wandering heart to quick return,
How tenderly he wooed!

Often I lamented an event
Which turned to my success.

When laboring under fancied ill,

He kindly cured with wholesome draughts
Of unaffected pain.
5
Sometimes he brought me near to death,
And pointing to the grave,
Made terror whisper kind advice,
And taught the tomb to save.
6
To raise my thoughts beyond where worlds
As spangles over us shine;
One day he gave, and made the next
My soul's delight resign.

From what seemed horror and despair,
The richest harvest rose;
And gave me in the will divine,
An absolute repose.

And pour contempt on all my pride.
2
Forbid it Lord, that I should boast,
But in the death of Christ my God;
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them to his blood.
3
See from his head, his hands, his feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did ever such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
4
His dying crimson like a robe,
Spreads over his body on the tree;
Then am I dead to all the globe,
And all the globe is dead to me.

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

Beyond this earth extend;
So far my tho'ts, so far my ways,

And bid me welcome to my Lord,
My life, my treasure and my trust?

And when my lively hope can say
I love my God and taste his grace,
Lord is it not thy blissful ray
Which gives the vision of thy face?

Though God afflicts, I Will not repine,
The noblest comforts still are mine;
Comforts which shall over death prevail,
And journey with me through the vale.

Each stroke some kind design fulfils;
And shall I murmur at my God,
When sovereign love directs the rod?

And lead me to the realms of day;
To milder skies and brighter plains,
Where everlasting pleasure reigns.

To bid the stagnant pulses flow,
The animating heat restore.
4
Thy will, ere nature's tutored hand
Could with young life, these limbs unfold,
Did the imprisoned brain expand,
And all its countless fibers told.
5
As from the dust, thy forming breath
Could the unconscious being raise;
So can the silent voice of death
Wake at thy call, in songs of praise.
6
"Since twice to die is ours alone,
And twice the birth of life to see;
O let us, suppliant at thy throne,
Devote our second life to thee."
MRS. MORTON.
Hymn CCLXXXVI. Long Meter. Faith Triumphant.
1
WHO shall the Lord's elect condemn?
It Is God who justifies their souls*
And mercy like a mighty stream
Over all their sins divinely rolls.
2
Who shall adjudge the saints to hell?
It Is Christ who suffered in their stead;
And the salvation to fulfill,
Behold him rising from the dead!
3
He lives! he lives! and reigns above,
Forever interceding there;
Who shall divide us from his love?
Or what shall tempt us to despair?
4
Shall persecution or distress,
Famine, or sword, or nakedness?
He who has loved us, bears us through,
And makes us more than conq'rors too.
5
Faith has an overcoming power,
It triumphs in the dying hour;
Christ is our life, our joy, our hope,
Nor can we sink with such a prop.
6
Not all that men on earth can do,
Nor powers on high, nor powers below;
Shall cause his mercy to remove,
Or wean our hearts from Christ our love.
WATTS.
Hymn CCLXXXVII. Common Meter. Death and the Resurrection.
1
WHY do we mourn departing friends,
Or shake at death's alarms?
It Is but the voice that Jesus sends,
To call them to his arms.
2
Why should we tremble to convey
Their bodies to the tomb?
There Jesus' sacred body lay,
And left a long perfume.
3
The graves of all his saints he blessed,
And softened every bed:
Where should the dying members rest,
But with the dying head?
4
Thence he arose, ascended high,
And showed our feet the way;
Up to the Lord, our flesh shall fly
At the great rising day.
5
Then shall the last loud trumpet sound,
And bid our friends arise;
Awake, ye nations, from the ground,
Ye saints, ascend the skies.
WATTS.
Hymn CCLXXXVIII. Common Meter. Looking at Things Unseen.
1
WHY should the world's alluring toys
Detain our hearts and eyes;
Regardless of immortal joys
And strangers to the skies!
2
These transient scenes will soon decay,
They fade upon the sight;
And quickly will their brighter day
Be lost in endless night.
3
Their brightest day! alas, how vain!
With conscious sighs we own;
Whilst clouds of sorrow, care and pain
O'ershade the smiling noon.
4
O could our tho'ts and wishes fly
Above these gloomy shades,
To those bright worlds beyond the sky
Which sorrow never invades.
5
There joys unseen by mortal eyes
Or reason's feeble ray,
In ever blooming prospect rise
Unconscious of decay.
6
Lord send a beam of light divine
To guide our upward aim,
With one reviving ray of thine
Our languid hearts inflame.
7
Then shall on faith's sublimest wing
Our ardent wishes rise,
To those bright scenes where pleasures spring
Immortal in the skies.
Mrs. STEEL.
Hymn CCLXXXIX. Long Meter. Marriage.
1
WITH cheerful voices rise and sing
The praises of our God and King;
For he alone can minds unite,
And bless with conjugal delight.
2
This wedded pair, O Lord inspire
With heavenly love, that sacred fire;
From this blessed moment may they prove
The bliss divine of marriage love.
3
O may they both increasing find
Substantial pleasures of the mind;
Happy together may they be,
And both united, Lord, to thee.
4
To you, blessed pair, your God has given,
To taste the love which reigns in heaven;
His gift with all your powers improve,
And cultivate that virtuous love.
5
So may you live as truly one;
And when your work on earth is done,
Rise, hand in hand, to heaven, and share
The joys of love forever there*
PROUD.
Hymn CCXC. Common Meter. The Penitent Thief.
1
WITH deep contrition, grief and shame,
The thief his crimes confessed,
T^en turned his dying eyes to Christ,
And thus his prayer addressed.
2
"When to thy kingdom thou shall come
O Lord, remember me."
"This day, with me in paradise
Thy happy soul shall be."
3
Thus spoke the Savior to a wretch,
Who languish'd at his side;
Whilst on the fatal tree he hung,
And bled and groaned and died.
4
Jesus, thou son and heir of heaven,
Thou Lord of all below;
Though then unjustly thou was brought
To infamy and woe;
5
Yet quickly from that dreadful scene
In triumph thou did rise,
Burst through the prison of the grave
And gain thy native skies!
6
Exalted to thy father's throne,
Pardon and life to give;
The penitent thou still do hear,
And bid the sinner live.
Altered from STENNET.
Hymn CCXCI. Common Meter. The First and Second Adam.
1
WITH flowing eyes and bleeding hearts
A fallen world survey!
See the wide ruin sin has made,
In one unhappy day!
2
Adam, in God's own image formed,
See from his God estranged!
And all the joys of paradise
For guilt and horror changed!
3
This fatal heritage bequeathed
To all his helpless race!
Through this dark maze of sin and woe
Thus to the grave we pass!
4
But, O my soul, with rapture hear
The second Adam's name;
And the celestial gifts he brings
To all his seed, proclaim.
5
What though in mortal life they mourn?
What though by death they fall?
Jesus in one triumphant day
Transforms and crowns them all!
6
Praise to his rich transcending grace
Even by our fall we rise!
And gain for earthly Eden lost
A heavenly Paradise!
MASON, altered.
Hymn CCXCII. Common Meter. Compassion of Christ.
1
WITH joy we meditate the grace
Of our high priest above;
His heart is full of tenderness,
Of pity and of love.
2
Touched with a sympathy within
He knows our feeble frame;
He knows what fore temptations mean
For he endured the same.
3
But spotless, innocent and pure
The great Redeemer stood;
When Satan's fiery darts he bore,
And did resist to blood.
4
He in the days of feeble flesh
Poured out his cries and tears;
And in his measure feels afresh
What every christian bears.
5
He Will never quench the smoking flax
But raise it to a flame;
The bruised reed he never breaks,
Nor scorns the meanest name.
6
Then let our humble faith address
His mercy and his power;
We shall obtain delivering grace
In the distressing hour.
WATTS.
Hymn CCXCIII. Common Meter. Repentance and Hope.
1
WITH restless agitations tossed,
And low immersed in woes,
When shall my wild distempered thoughts
Regain their lost repose?
2
O thou, the wretched's sure retreat,
These torturing cares control;
And with the cheerful smile of peace
Revive my fainting soul.
3
Did ever thy paternal ear
The humble plea disdain?
Or when did plaintive misery sigh,
Or supplicate in vain?
4
Oppressed with grief and shame, dissolved
In penitential tears,
Thy goodness calms our restless doubts
And dissipates our fears.
5
New life from thy refreshing grace
Our sinking hearts receive;
For it is thy darling attribute
To pity and forgive.
6
From that blessed source, propitious hope
Appears serenely bright;
And sheds its soft diffusive beam,
Over sorrow's dismal night.
7
My griefs confess its vital power,
And bless the friendly ray;
Which ushers in the glad serene
Of everlasting day.
MRS. CARTER.
Hymn CCXCIV. Long Meter. Jesus Christ, the same Yesterday, to Day and Forever.
1
WITH wonder, Lord, our souls proclaim
The immortal honors of thy name;
Assembled round our Savior's throne
We make his countless glories known.
2
Ere Adam's clay with life was warmed
Or Gabriel's nobler spirit formed;
Before creation was begun,
Before all ages, was the SON.
3
Through all succeeding ages he
The same has been and still shall be;
Immortal honors crown his head,
Though earth and skies wax old and fade.
4
The same his power his flock to guard,
The same his bounty to reward;
The same his faithfulness and love,
To saints on earth and saints above.
5
Let nature change, and sink, and die,
Jesus shall raise his people high;
And place them near his father's throne
In glory lasting as his own.
DODDRIDGE.
Hymn CCXCV. Common Meter. The Christian's Farewell.
1
YE golden lamps of heaven farewell,
With all your feeble light;
Farewell thou ever changing moon,
Pale empress of the night.
2
And thou, refulgent orb of day,
In brighter flames arrayed;
My soul that springs beyond thy sphere,
No more demands thy aid.
3
Ye stars are but the shining dust
Of my divine abode;
The pavement of those heavenly courts,
Where I shall see my God.
4
The father of eternal light
Shall there his beams display;
Nor shall one moment's darkness mix
With that un^aried day.
5
No more the drops of piercing grief
Shall swell into my eyes;
Nor the meridian sun decline,
Amidst those brighter skies.
6
There all the millions of his saints
Shall in one song unite;
And each, the bliss of all shall view
With infinite delight.
DODDRIDGE.
Hymn CCXCVI. Common Meter. Divine Goodness.
1
YE humble souls approach your God
With songs of sacred praise;
For he is good, immensely good,
And kind are all his ways.
2
All nature owns his guardian care,
In him we live and move;
But nobler benefits declare
The wonders of his love.
3
He gave his well beloved son,
To save our souls from sin;
It Is here he makes his goodness known,
And proves it all divine.
4
To this sure refuge, Lord, we come,
And here our hope relies;
A safe defense, a peaceful home
When storms of trouble rise.
5
Thine eye beholds with kind regard
The souls who trust in thee;
Their humble hope thou will reward
With bliss divinely free.
6
Great God, to thy almighty love
What honors shall we raise;
Not all the raptured songs above
Can render equal praise.
Mrs. STEEL.
Hymn CCXCVII. Long Meter. Blessed are the Poor in Spirit.
1
YE humble souls complain no more,
Let faith survey your future store,
How happy, how divinely blessed,
The sacred words of truth attest.
2
When conscious grief laments sincere
And pours the penitential tear;
Hope points to your dejected eyes,
A bright reversion in the skies.
3
In vain the sons of wealth and pride
Despise your lot, your hopes deride;
In vain they boast their little stores,
Trifles are theirs, a kingdom yours.
4
A kingdom, of immense delight,
Where health and peace and joy unite;
A kingdom which shall never decay
Though earthly kingdoms fade away.
5
There shall your eyes with rapture view
The glorious friend, who died for you;
Who died to ransom, died to raise
To crowns of joy and songs of praise.
6
Jesus, to thee I breathe my prayer,
Confirm to me, my interest there;
Whatever be my lot below,
This, this my soul desires to know.
7
O let me hear thy voice divine,
Pronounce the glorious blessing mine;
Enrolled among thy happy poor,
My largest wishes ask no more.
MRS. STEEL.
Hymn CCXCVIII. Common Meter.
The Invitation. Isa. lv.
1
"YE thirsty souls, approach the spring
Where living waters flow;
Free to that sacred fountain, all
Without a price may go.
2
"How long to streams of false delight
Will ye in crowds repair?
How long your strength and substance waste
On trifles light as a^^
3
"My stores afford those rich supplies
That health and pleasure give;
Incline your ear and come to me,
The soul that hears shall live.
4
"With you a covenant I will make,
That ever shall endure;
The hope which glad'ned David's heart
My mercy has made sure.
5
"Behold he comes, your leader comes
With might and honor crowned;
A witness who shall spread my name
To earth's remotest bound.
6
"See, nations hasten to his call
From every distant shore;
Islands unknown shall bow to him,
And Israel's God adore."

Hymn CCXCIX. Common Meter. The Gospel Feast.
1
YE wretched, hungry, starving poor,
Behold a royal feast!
Where mercy spreads her bounteous store
For every humble guest.
2
See Jesus stands with open arms,
He calls, he bids you come:
Guilt holds you back, and fear alarms,
But see there yet is room!
3
In Jesu's condescending heart
Both love and pity meet;
Nor will he bid the soul depart,
That trembles at his feet.
4
Come then, and with his people taste
The blessings of his love;
While hope attends the sweet repast,
Of nobler joys above.
5
There with united heart and voice,
Before the eternal throne;
Ten thousand, thousand souls rejoice,
In ecstasies unknown.
6
And yet ten thousand, thousand more,
Are welcome still to come;
Ye longing souls, the grace adore,
Approach, there yet is room.
MRS. STEEL.
Hymn CCC. Common Meter. True and False Zeal.
1
ZEAL is that pure and heavenly flame
The fire of love supplies;
Whilst that which often bears the name
Is self but in disguise.
2
True zeal is merciful and mild,
Can pity and forbear;
The fals^ is headstrong, fierce and wild,
And breathes revenge and war.
3
While zeal for truth the christian warms,
He knows the worth of peace;
But self comends for names and forms,
Its party to increase.
4
Zeal has attained its highest aim,
Its end is satisfied,
If sinners love the Savior's name
Nor seeks it aught beside.
5
But self, however well employed,
Has its own ends in view;
And says as boasting Jehu cried,
"Come see what I can do."
6
Self may its own reward obtain
And be applauded here;
But zeal the best applause will gain
When Jesus shall appear.
7
This idol self, O Lord, dethrone,
And from our hearts remove;
And let no zeal by us be shown
But that which springs from love.
