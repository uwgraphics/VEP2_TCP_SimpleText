Thursday, January ninth, 1794.
The Senate sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment --

John Nicholson, Comptroller General of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
having been summoned by the Senate to come forth and appear at the bar of the
Senate, "and answer sundry articles of impeachment exhibited against him by the
House of Representatives, in their name, and that of all the people of
Pennsylvania, for high crimes and misdemeanors in the discharge of his official
duties as Comptroller General of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania," appeared at
the bar of the Senate.

Whereupon,

The Clerk of the Senate read "the articles of impeachment" as follow, to wit,

"Articles of accusation and impeachment for high misdemeanors against John
Nicholson, Comptroller General of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by the
House of Representatives of the said commonwealth, in their name, and in the
name of the People of Pennsylvania, exhibited to the Senate thereof.
"Article I. THAT, by an act of the General Assembly of this commonwealth,
passed on the twenty-seventh day of March, in the year 1789, entitled, "An act
to repeal so much of any act or acts of Assembly of this commonwealth, as
directs the payment of the New-Loan debt, or the interest thereof, beyond the
first day of April next, and for other purposes therein mentioned," it was,
among other things, declared and enacted, That so much of every act or acts of
General Assembly as directed or secured the payment of the principal sum or
sums mentioned in certain certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates
(which had been issued in pursuance of a preceding act, passed on the first day
of March, 1786) or the interest thereof, beyond the term of four years, should
be thenceforth repealed and made null and void; thereby rendering the said
certificates no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt, due and owing from the
(...) Pennsylvania: But, nevertheless, John Nicholson, the Comptroller General
of this commonwealth, to promote and procure his own emolument, under the
color of his office, pretending as well to facilitate the execution of certain
acts of Congress hereinafter mentioned, touching a loan proposed by the United
States to the creditors of the respective states, as to carry into effect a
certain act of the General Assembly of this commonwealth, hereinafter also
mentioned, touching the redemption of certain debts due and owing from the
state of Pennsylvania, did, at various times, after the passing of the said act
of the sixth day of March, 1789, to wit, between the tenth day of April, 1792,
and the first day of August, 1792, recognize, certify, and declare the said
certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, to be subscribable, as
debts due and owing by the state of Pennsylvania, to a certain loan opened and
proposed, on the part of the United States, to the creditors of the respective
states, in and by two several acts of Congress, passed, respectively, on the
fourth day of August, 1790, and on the eighth day of May, 1792; thereby
committing a high misdemeanor, contrary to the intent and meaning of the said
law, passed on the twenty-seventh day of March, 1789, in violation of the
confidence reposed in him as a public officer, and manifestly, as the said John
Nicholson well know, to the risque and injury of the commonwealth.

"Article II. That, by an act of the General Assembly, entitled, "An act to
provide for paying and redeeming certain public debts, and for defraying the
expenses of government," passed on the tenth day of April, 1792, provision was
made, among other things, for redeeming certain debts then due and owing by
this commonwealth; in the specification of which debts the said certificates,
commonly called New-Loan certificates, were not included, nor could they, in
any wise, be contemplated to be objects of the said redemption; but,
nevertheless, the said John Nicholson, the Comptroller General of this
commonwealth, with a view to promote and procure his own emolument, and under
color of his office, did recognize, certify, and declare the said
certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificate?, to be redeemable; thereby
committing a high misdemeanor, contrary to the terms, intent, and meaning of
the said act of the General Assembly, passed on the tenth day of April, 1792,
in violation of the confidence reposed in him as a public officer, and to the
manifest loss and injury of this commonwealth.

"Article III. That the said John Nicholson, the Comptroller General of this
commonwealth, with intent to promote and procure his own emolument, and in
order to avoid discovery and detection in so doing, until such emolument was
actually reduced into his own possession, did not consult the Register General
touching the above transactions, nor communicate the same to the Governor; nor
did he discriminate, in the certification entered upon the face of the
abstracts of debts respectively, by which certification he recognized and
declared the said certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, to be
subscribable to the said loan opened and proposed on the part of the United
States, to the creditors of the respective states, nor in the certification by
which he recognized and declared the same to be redeemable under the said act
of the tenth day of April, 1792, between the said certificates, commonly called
New-Loan certificates, and other certificates which were properly debts, or
evidences of debts, due and owing from this state, and as such might lawfully
be subscribed to the said loan, and redeemed by virtue of the said act of the
tenth of April, 1792: in which conduct the said Comptroller General committed a
high misdemeanor, in as much as, thereby, all the checks of office, provided by
law, were destroyed, the other officers of government were deluded into error,
and the commonwealth suffered manifest loss and injury.

"Article IV. That, by the constitution of this commonwealth, it is declared,
that no money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of a
previous appropriation by law; yet the said John Nicholson, with a view to
promote and procure his own emolument, did, under color of his office, and in
the above mentioned delusive manner, certify to the Governor, that certain
debts, including the said certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates,
but not naming or describing the same, were redeemable and payable, when no
fund was, by law, provided for paying the same; thereby committing a high
misdemeanor, misleading the other officers of government, and causing money,
without a previous appropriation, to be drawn from the treasury in violation of
the constitution.

"Article V. That the said John Nicholson, Comptroller General of the
commonwealth, with intent to promote and procure his own emolument, and having
formed a plan to cause, under color of his office, the said certificates,
commonly called New-Loan certificates, to be redeemed, did, by himself or his
agents, between the tenth day of April and the first day of August, 1792,
purchase a very great amount of the said certificates, as well from persons who
came to exchange the same at his office, in pursuance of a provision for that
purpose contained in the said act of the twenty-seventh of March, 1789, as from
others; which certificates, so purchased, were afterward actually redeemed and
paid for at the treasury; thereby committing a high misdemeanor, rendering his
official trust subservient to the purposes of speculation, and injuring the
reputation, as well as the interest, of the commonwealth whose officer he was.

"And the said House of Representatives, by protestation, saving to themselves
the liberty of exhibiting at any time hereafter, any other accusation or
impeachment against the said Comptroller General, and also of replying to the
answers that the said Comptroller General shall make unto the said articles or
to any of them, and of offering proof of the said premises or any of them, or
of any other impeachment or accusation that shall be exhibited by them as the
case shall require, do demand that the said John Nicholson, Comptroller General
of this commonwealth, may be put to answer all and every the premises, and that
such proceedings, examinations, trial and judgment may be upon him had and used
as is agreeable to the constitution and laws of this commonwealth, and the said
House of Representatives are ready to offer proof of the premises, at such time
as the Senate of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall appoint.

"Additional articles of impeachment against John Nicholson, Comptroller
General.
"Article VI. THAT the said John Nicholson, Comptroller General of this
commonwealth, being entrusted by the aforesaid act, entitled, "An act to repeal
so much of any act or acts of Assembly of this commonwealth, as directs the
payment of the New-Loan debt, or the interest thereof, beyond the first day of
April next, and for other purposes therein mentioned," passed the
twenty-seventh of March, 1789, to receive the said certificates, commonly
called New-Loan certificates, from the persons holding the same, and to
re-deliver, to such persons, the certificates of debts, due by the United
States, loaned to this state, did, in the execution of the trust so in him
reposed, receive, from sundry persons, certain certificates, commonly called
New-Loan certificates, to be exchanged as aforesaid; whereby, and by virtue of
the said act of Assembly, the said certificates became the property of this
commonwealth, and ought to have been delivered, by him, to the Register
General, for the purpose of being cancelled and preserved; yet the said John
Nicholson, then being Comptroller General of this commonwealth, well knowing
the same to be the property of the commonwealth, but contriving and intending
to convert certain of the same certificates to his own use and emolument, did,
between the tenth day of April, 1792, and the first day of August, 1792,
unlawfully, and contrary to the duties of his office and the trust so as
aforesaid in him reposed, subscribe the last mentioned certificates to the loan
aforesaid, proposed by the United States to the creditors of this state, in his
own name and for his own use and benefit; whereby the said John Nicholson has
committed a high misdemeanor, in the violation of the trust and confidence by
this commonwealth in him reposed, and manifestly tending to the injury and loss
of the said commonwealth.

"Article VII. That the said John Nicholson, Comptroller General of this
commonwealth, being entrusted, by the aforesaid act, entitled, "An act to
repeal so much of any act or acts of Assembly of this commonwealth, as directs
the payment of the New-Loan debt, or the interest thereof, beyond the first day
of April next, and for other purposes therein mentioned," passed the
twenty-seventh day of March, 1789, to receive the said certificates, commonly
called New-Loan certificates, from the persons holding the same, and to
re-deliver to such persons the certificates of debts due by the United States,
did, in the execution of the trust so in him reposed, exchange, for sundry
persons, certain certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, by
receiving, of the said persons, the said New-Loan certificates, and delivering,
in return thereof, an equal amount in the certificates of debts due by the
United States; whereby, and by virtue of the act of Assembly in such case made
and provided, the said New-Loan certificates became the property of this
commonwealth, and ought to have been delivered to the Register General to be
cancelled and preserved: yet the said John Nicholson, then being Comptroller
General of this commonwealth, well knowing the premises, but contriving and
unlawfully intending to convert certain of the same certificates to his own use
and emolument, and by subscribing the same to the loan aforesaid, by the United
States proposed, to procure the amount thereof to be paid to him by this
commonwealth, did, between the first day of April, 1792, and the first day of
August, 1792, unlawfully, and contrary to the duties of his said office and the
trust so as aforesaid reposed in him, subscribe the said last mentioned
certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, to the said loan proposed
by the United States, in his own name and for his own use and benefit; and did
afterward apply for, and obtain, the amount thereof to be paid by the
Treasurer of this commonwealth to his use; whereby the said John Nicholson has
committed a high misdemeanor, has violated the trust and confidence so as
aforesaid in him reposed, and has occasioned great loss and detriment to this
commonwealth."
