A small Vial of Tears brought from the Funeral of JOHN WINTHROP, A very goodly
Child, the Only Son of JOHN WINTHROP Esquire And ANNE his Wife; who was born at
New London the 20th of April, 1716. and died there the 15th of February
following; being Three Hundred and two days old.
Job, 14.1. Man that is born of a Woman is Short of days, and Full of Trouble.

V. 2. He comes forth like a Flower, and is cut down: he sleeth also (...) a
Shadow, and continues not.

V. 5. Seeing his Days are Determined, the Number of his Months with Thee; Thou
have Appointed his Bounds, that he cannot pass.

IN loving, lovely, Darling John,
Winthrop, and Dudley Met in One:
Such Harmony of Charming Features
Rarely appears in Mortal Creatures.
But Oh --! What, meet to part so soon!
Must we Resign this Budding Boon?
We must: We will! CHRIST's Will is done;
Our wills shall make an Unison.
JESUS will call John from the Grave,
From Sin, Eternally to Save.
S. S.
