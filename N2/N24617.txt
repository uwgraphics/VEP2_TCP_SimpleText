MULTIPLICATION. Examples.
Bought 55 bushels of Corn at 1 D. 1 D. 1 C. 1 M. per bushel.

How much come it to?

^ Bought 70 Horses, at 90 D. 9 D. 9 C. per house

How much come they to?

^ Observe in example 1st, there are three figures at the right hand of the dot
in the question, so in the answer three figures must be dotted off.

In example 2d, There are only two figures at the right hand of the dot in the
question conseqently, two figures only, are to be dotted off in the answer.

REDUCTION at Federal MONEY.
RULE.
To add one cipher, will reduce any sum to the next lower denomination: --

To point off one at the right hand, will raise it to the next higher
denomination.

EXAMPLES.
Reduce 999 Dollars to dimes.
Add one cipher 9990 D. reduces it to dimes. Add two 99900 reduces it to cents.
Add three 999000 reduces it to cents.

To reduce 999000 Mills to cents.
Point off 1 fig. 99900.0 it reads cents. Point off 2 9990.00 it reads dimes
Point off 3 999.000 it reads dollars.

DIVISION.
RULE. The figures at the right hand of the dot in the divisor and quotient
counted together, must be equal to those pointed off in the dividend. When
there are no figures pointed off in the divisor, then you must point off as
many figures in the answer, as there are pointed off in the dividend.

^ If 122 Oranges cost 109 D. 8 D. 0 C. 0 M. what were they a piece.

^ As there were no figures pointed off in the Divisor of the above sums, so
many figures were to be pointed off, in the answer, as there were pointed off
in the Dividend.

SIMPLE INTEREST of Federal MONEY.
A Table of ratios from 1 to 10 per Ct.
Rate per ct. Ratios. 1.01 2.02 3.03 4.04 5.05 6.06 7.07 8.08 9.09 10.1

The principal, time and ratio given to find the interest and amount.

the interest; to which add the principal, and the sum will be the amount.

Required the amount of D. 537. D. 1 C. 6 for 5 years, at 7 per cent, per annum?

Note. That in every Multiplication, you must point off as many figures, to the
right hand, as there are figures at the right hand of the dot, in the
multiplier, and multiplicand both; in the above sum, in the first
multiplication, there were.16 and 07 which counted together, make four,
therefore four figures are to be pointed off.

In the second Multiplication, there were four at the right hand of the (...)
in the multiplicand; but none in the multiplier, therefore four only, are to be
pointed off in the answer.

Required the interest of 700 D. 7. D. 7 C. 7 M. for 2 years, at 7 per cent per
annum.
