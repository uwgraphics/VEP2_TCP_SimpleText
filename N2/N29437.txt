A FUNERAL ELEGY (Written many years since) On the Death of the Memorable and
truly Honorable John Winthrope Esquire: Governor of the Massachusetts Colony in
N-England. For the space of 19 years, who died in the 63d. Year of his Age.
March 26. 1649
YOu English Mattachusians all
Forbear sometime from sleeping,
Let every one both great and small
Prepare themselves for weeping.
For he is gone that was our friend,
This Tyrant Death has wrought his end.
Who was the very Chief among
The chiefest of our Peers
Who has in peace maintained us long
The space of nineteen years,
And now he is breathless, lifeless, dead,
Cold earth is now become his bed.
The Jews did for their Moses weep
Who was their Gubernator,
Let us for Winthrope do the like,
Who was our Conservator
With Lines of gold in Marble stone
With pens of steel engrave his name
O let the Muses every one
In prose and Verse extol his Fame,
Exceeding far those ancient Sages
That ruled Greeks in former Ages.
O spightfull Death and also cruel
Thou have quite slain New-Englands Jewel:
Show us vile Tyrant if thou can
Tell where to find out such a man?
Methinks I hear a spirit breathe
Non est inventus here beneath.
He was (we surely may say this)
Rara avis in terris,
Therefore let us give him his due,
To him is due this style,
He was an Israelite full true
Without all fraud or guile.
Let Winthrops name still famous be,
With us and our Posterity.
What goods he had he did not spare,
The Church and Commonwealth
Had of his Goods the greatest share,
Kept nothing for himself.
My tongue, my pen, my rustic art
Cannot express his true desert.
The nature of the Pelican
Read stories what they say,
To her I would compare this man
If lawfully I may.
To Moses meek, to Abraham,
To Joseph and to Jonathan.
He was New-Englands Pelican
New-Englands Gubernator
He was New-Englands Solomon
New-Englands Conservator.
Time and Experience the best trial,
These two admit of no denial:
Let nineteen years then witness be
Of Wintrops true sincerity.
Such gifts of grace from God had he,
That more than man he seemed to be.
But now he is gone and clad in clay,
Grim Death has taken him away.
Death like a murdering Jesuit
Has robbed us of our hearts delight.
Let Us show our love to him by weeping
That cared for us when we say sleeping.
O that our dry eyes fountains were,
Our heads a living spring,
O that our sighs the clouds could tear,
And make an echo ring:
Let us sit down in sorrow fell,
And now with tears ring out his knel.
Bright shining Phoebus hide thy face
Let misty clouds make dark thy sky,
Fair Cynthia count it no disgrace
To aid us with thy weeping eye.
O weep with us for Joshua
The Loadstone of America.
My senses they are all too weak
His praises due to write or speak
Now I must leave it to their skill
Who can endite and write at will.
New England thou have cause to mourn,
For that thy special friend is gone.
Yet see you mourn with moderation,
No cause you have of Desparation,
They yet survive who may renew
Decayed and dying hopes in you
With honor due let us respect them,
No cause we have for to reject them,
They are to us as true Directors
And under God our chief Protectors.
Here you have Lowells loyalty,
Pend with his slender skill
And with it no good poetry,
Yet certainly good will.
Read these few verses willingly,
And view them not with Momus eye,
Friendly correct what is amiss,
Accept his love that did write this.
Perciful Lowle.
