SONGS AND LULLABIES.


A LOVE SONG.
THERE was a little man.
Who wooed a little maid;
And he said, little Maid, will you
wed, wed, wed?
I have little more to say,
So will you aye or nay,
For the least said is soonest men
ded, ded, ded,
II.
Then replied the little maid,
Little sir, you have little said
To induce a little maid for to wed, wed, wed;
You must say a little more,
And produce a little Ore,
Ever I make a little print in your Bed, Bed, Bed.
III.
Then the little man replied,
If you will be my little bride,
I Will raise my love notes a little higher, higher, higher;
Though my offers are not meet,
Yet my little heart is great,
With the little God of love all on fire, fire, fire.
IV.
Then the little maid replied
Should I be your little bride,
Pray what must we have for to eat, eat, eat?
Will the flame that you're so rich in
Light a fire in the kitchen,
Or the little God of love turn the spit, spit, spit?
V.
Then the little man he sighed,
And, some say, a little cried
For his little heart was big with sorrow, sorrow, sorrow;
As I am your little slave,
If the little that I have
Be too little, little, we will borrow, borrow, borrow.
He who borrows is another Man's slave, and pawns his honor, his liberty, and
sometimes his nose for the (...).

VI.
Then the little man so gent,
Made the little maid relent,
And set her little heart a think-king, king, king.
Though his offers were but small,
She took his little All,
She could have but the Cat and her skin, skin, skin.




Amphion's SONG of Euridyce.
I WONT be my father's Jack,
I wont be my father's Gill
I will be the sidler's wife,
And have music when I will.
The Other little tune,
The Other little tune,
Prithee, love, play me
The Other little tune.
Maxim. Those arts are the most valuable which are of the greatest use.



IS John Smith within?
Yes, that he is.
Can he set a shoe?
Ave, marry two.
Here a nail, and there a nail,
Tick, tack, too.
Maxim. Knowledge is a treasure, but practice is the key to it.



SE saw, Margery Daw,
Jacky shall have a new master:
Jacky must have but a penny a day,
Because he can work no faster.
(...) mean and scandalous practice in (...), to things that deferve no (...)

GREAT A, little a,
Bouncing B:
The Cat's in the cupboard,
And she cannot see.
Yes she can see that you are naughty: and don't mind your book.



HIGH diddle diddle,
The Cat and the fiddle.
The Cow junno'd over the Moon;
The little Dog laughed,
To see such craft,
And the dish ran away with the Spoon.
It must be a little Dog that laughed, for a great Dog would be ashamed to
laugh at such nonsense.



A DIRGE.
LITTLE Betty winkle she had a Pig,
It was a little Pig not very big;
When he was alive he lived in Clover,
But now he is dead, and that is all over;
Johnny Winkle, he
Sat down and cried,
Betty Winkle, she
Laid down and died;
So there was an end of one, two and three,
Johnny Winkle he,
Betty Winkle she,
And Piggy wiggie.
A Dirge is a song made for the dead; but whether this was made for Betty
Winkle or her Pig is uncertain; no notice being taken of it by Cambden, or any
of the famous Antiquarians. Wall's System of Sense.





A Melancholy SONG.
TRIP upon trenchers,
And dance upon dishes,
My mother sent me for some bawn, some bawn:
She bid me tread lightly,
And come again quikly,
For fear the young men, should do me some harm.
Yet did not you see;
Yet did not you see,
What naughty tricks they put upon me,
They broke my pitcher,
And spilt the water,
And huffed my mother,
And chid her daughter,
And kissed my sister instead of me.
What a succession of misfortunes befell this poor girl! But the last
circumstance was the most affecting, and might have proved fatal. Winslow's
View of Bath.





LITTLE Tom Tucker
Sings for his supper;
What shall he eat?
White bread and butter:
How will he cut it,
Without e're a knife?
How will he be married,
Without e're a wife?
To be married without a wife is a terrible thing, and to be married with a bad
wife is something worse; however, a good wife that sings well is the best
musical instrument in the world. Puffendorf.



SE saw, sacaradown,
Which is the way to Boston Town?
One foot up the other foot down,
That is the way to Boston Town.
Or to any other town upon the face of the Earth. (...)



THERE was an old Woman
Lived under a hill.
And if she is not gone
She lives there still.
This is a self evident proposition, which is the very essence of truth. She
lived under the hill, and if she is not gone she lives there still. Nobody will
presume to contradict this. C^^usa.



THERE was an old Woman
Lived under a hill,
She put a mouse in a bag,
And sent it to mill:
The miller did swear
By the point of his knife,
He never took toll
Of a mouse in his life.
The only instance of a Miller refusing toll, and for which the Cat has just
cause of complaint against him. Coke upon Littleton.



THERE was an old Man,
And he had a calf,
And that is half;
He took him out of the stall,
And put him on the wall,
And that is all.
Maxim. Those who are given to tell all they know generally tell more than they
know



CROSS patch draw the latch,
Set by the sire and spin;
Take a cup and drink it up,
Then call your neighbors in.
A common Case this, to call in our Neighbors to rejoice when all the good
Liquor is gone. Pliny.



SHOE the Colt,
Shoe the Colt,
Shoe the wild Mare;
Here a nail,
There a nail,
Yet she goes bare.
Ay, ay, drive the nail when it will go: That Is the way of the world, and is
the method pursued by all our Financiers, Politicians, and Necromancers. Vattel.



TELL Tale Tit,
Your Tongue shall be slit,
And all the Dogs in our town
Shall have a bit.
Maxim. Point not at the faults of others with a foul anger.



WHAT Care I how black I be,
Twenty pounds will marry me;
If twenty will not, Forty shall.
I am my mother's bouncing Girl.
Maxim. If we do not flatter ourselves, the flattery of others would have no
effect



PLATO's SONG.
DING dong bell,
The cat is in the well.
Who put her in?
Tittle Johnny Green
What a naughty boy was that
To drown poor pussy cat,
Who never did any harm,
And killed the mice in his father's barn.
Maxim. He that injures one threatens an Hundred.



RIDE a cock Horse,
To Banbury cross,
To see what Tommy can buy;
A penny white loaf,
A penny white cake,
And a two penny Apple Pie.
There Is a good boy, eat up your pie and hold your tongue; for silence is the
sign of wisdom.



THREE wise men of Gotham,
They went to sea in a bowl,
And if the bowl had been stronger,
My song had been longer.
It is long enough. Never lament the loss of what is not worth having. Boil.
