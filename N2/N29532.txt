Association.
WHEREAS there has been a horrid and detestable Conspiracy formed and carried
on by Papists and other wicked and traitorous persons for Assassinating His
Majesty's Royal Person, in order to encourage an Invasion from France, to
subvert our Religion, Laws and Liberty. We whose Names are hereunto subscribed,
Do heartily, sincerely and solemnly profess, testify and declare, That His
present Majesty KING WILLIAM is rightful and lawful KING of the Realms of
England, Scotland and Ireland: And we do mutually promise and engage to stand
by and assist each other to the utmost of our power, in the support and defense
of His Majesty's most Sacred Person and Government, against the late King James
and all his Adherents. And in case His Majesty come to any Violent or untimely
Death (which GOD forbid) We do hereby further freely and unanimously oblige our
selves, to unite associate and stand by each other in revenging the same upon
His Enemies and their Adherents, and in supporting and defending the Succession
of the Crown, according to an Act made in the first year of the Reign of King
WILLIAM and Queen MARY, Entitled, An Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of
the Subject, and settling the Succession of the Crown.
