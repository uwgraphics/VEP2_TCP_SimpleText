PREFACE BY THE AUTHOR.
THIS piece is a continuation of my "Virgin of the Sun." My worthy friend, Mr.
Schroeder, has made several slight alterations in it, upon which I, relying on
his secrecy* might safely hold my peace; but which I shall now gratefully
acknowledge; partly, because I am not ashamed to take instruction from such a
man as Schroeder; partly, because otherwise some ill-tempered critic may, as
heretofore, upon the applause which the piece receives, rush forward, like an
envious blood-hound, to lessen my share of merit with the public. The
alterations are such as Mr. Schroeder made himself, or such as I have made by
his advice.

To the first of these belongs, in preference, the expunging a scene of
Diego's, which, without having any connection with the interest of the whole,
interrupted, by untimely jests, the progress of the first act. Further, the
suppression of a finale, and an air which Elvira, very unseasonably, sung to
the guitar. Further, the circumstance, that Pizarro only guessed at Elvira's
design upon his life, which, before this alteration, Rolla, without hesitation,
discovered to him; and thereby, perhaps, cast an appearance of ungenerous
conduct upon his character. Further, the mitigating Pizarro's baseness, where
he, in violation of his promise, seeks to get Rolla again in his power.

I have myself, at his desire, metamorphosed Valverde the priest, into a
private secretary; because, wicked priests can be tolerated only on the great
theater of the world, and not upon the stage of a playhouse. But I designed
this alteration only for the stage; and, that the press should restore this
wretch again to his historical character. At present I have neither time nor
inclination to attend farther to him.

Unquestionably, the alteration which has been most serviceable to the piece
is, the ennobling of Elvira's character, which I undertook by his advice, and
for which I sincerely thank him.

Other alterations, which Mr. Schroeder thought proper to recommend, in
compliance with the spirit of the times, I have not made. I see, for example,
no reason why we should refrain from saying, that the Pope, by his bull, made a
present of America to the Spaniards; that, by another bull, he declared the
Indians to be men and not apes; that thirteen Indians were crucified by the
Spaniards to the honor of Christ and the twelve apostles. Why must that be
suppressed on the stage, which history has so loudly proclaimed?

I take this opportunity of saying a few words concerning two other of my
pieces. A certain Mr. Schutze has confidently asserted, in his History of the
Hamburg Theater, that Mr. Schroeder had made great alterations in "Count
Benyowsky," to which that piece owed its success. This, with his permission, is
not true. Mr. Schroeder altered nothing in "Count Benyowsky;" and Mr. Schutze
will do well, in future, to seek better information.

The "Literary Gazette" has had the goodness to judge of my Sultan Wampum A
very pleasant farce, which I hope to present to the public. TRANSLATOR.
, (a hasty composition, upon which I do not set a very great value) with more
kindness than I, perhaps, should have done myself; although it has formerly, in
opposition to the public applause, condemned and trampled in the dust some
performances of mine whose merit is far superior.

For this kindness I am grateful, and will here make known, that some of the
censured, and truly censurable, verses do not belong to me, having been
altered, probably to suit the fancy of the composer, without my knowledge; and
remaining so, because I was too far from the place of publication to
superintend the press.

PIZARRO IN PERU; OR, THE DEATH OF ROLLA.
ACT FIRST.
SCENE FIRST.
A magnificent pavilion near Pizarro's tent -- a view of the Spanish camp in
the back ground. ELVIRA is discovered sleeping under a canopy on one side of
the pavilion. -- VALVERDE enters, kneels and attempts to kiss the hand of
ELVIRA; she rises and looks at him with indignation. Val. FORGIVE the power of
your charms.


El. Who has permitted thee to break in upon my slumbers? Is it not enough that
the tumults of the camp destroy my nightly rest? -- But leave me, and I forgive
thee -- I would rather have my sense of hearing tortured, than my sight. Leave
me, or I inform Pizarro of your insolence.


Val. Inform Pizarro! -- Nay, lady, rather inform me through what magic this
Pizarro has enchained thee? Wild and unseemly in his looks, a hypocrite in
friendship, in love a tyrant --


El. Hold! Your funeral oration comes too soon; Pizarro is not dead.


Val. A swineherd in his youth, he now in manhood treats mankind as swine.
Illiterate as an Andalusian muleteer, he cannot even read or write!


El. Love only reads in the eyes, and knows but to write on the heart. I saw in
Pizarro a hero, a leader of men -- in thee I see not man.


Val. Indulge your sportive mockery, while the sun of our prosperity yet
shines. When the thunder rolls, tremble -- The tempest is not far distant.


El. Valverde a prophet!


Val. Are we not in a strange country, where death lies in wait in every plant,
in every fruit we pluck to satisfy our hunger? Those whom the sword of the
enemy spares, an unwonted climate destroys. Daily the number of our foes
increases, while every sun lights a Spaniard to his grave.


El. And does that grieve Valverde? Are not the survivors the heirs of the dead?


Val. And can you think, lady, that the sordid thirst for gold --


El. Away, away! Think you I cannot discern the wolf, although the garment of
the lamb adorns him? I know ye all. There Is not a man in all the camp that
speaks his thoughts except the good Las Casas.


Val. Name not the dreamer!


El. O, had I known this venerable man in early life, how different might have
been my lot!


Val. Pizarro then, perhaps, had found more obstacles to fair Elvira's love --


El. How now! presumptuous priest!


Val. Pardon me, lady, but it moves my wonder still, that such a man could ever
gain your love. You say you saw a hero. What has Pizarro done to gain the title?


El. Ask Spain, ask Europe, ask both hemispheres that question. When with a
pigmy vessel and one hundred men he quitted Panama, to conquer an unknown
world, my heart whispered, "This is a brave man." But when upon the little
island Gallo, he drew a line with his sword in the sand, and permitted all to
abandon him who chose to pass that line; when only thirteen trusty men swore to
follow, and he at their head dedicated himself to death, my heart cried aloud,
"A hero!"


Val. Were fame herself enamoured of Pizarro, she could not sound his praises
in loftier key than does Elvira. But believe me, lady, Pizarro's brilliant
actions belong only to the past. As long as Alonzo de Molina instructs and
leads the enemy, Pizarro's heart will not be gladdened by the shouts of
victory. (Trumpets without.) He comes.


El. Look not confounded. Put on an honest face, man, if thou can.


Piz. (Without.) Secure him -- I will examine him myself.


Enter PIZARRO. He stops short on seeing VALVERDE and ELVIRA together. Looks at
them alternately with frowning suspicion. VALVERDE bows: -- ELVIRA laughs. Piz.
Why do thou smile, Elvira?


El. To laugh and weep, without being obliged to give a reason, are among the
few privileges we women enjoy.


Piz. I will know the cause.


El. "I will, I will!" But, unfortunately for your curiosity, I will not.


Val. Donna Elvira laughed at my fears.


Piz. Fears! What fears?


Val. That the enemy, through superior numbers and the instructions of Alonzo
de Molina --


Piz. Alonzo! Only women, and men more weak than women, could think of danger
from a source so mean. The ungrateful traitor! How I once loved that man! His
noble mother entrusted him a boy to my protection. He feasted at my table -- he
slept in my tent. I saw the spark of heroism in his soul, and hoped to fan it
to a flame. -- Often when I recounted our first adventures -- what toils we
struggled with -- what perils we surmounted -- how, landed on an unknown coast,
famine, fatigue, discord within and thronging foes without, thinned our scanty
ranks, while still I stood undaunted and maintained my purpose and my power, in
spite of growling mutiny and bold revolt, till with my faithful few I stood
victorious! -- Then would the youth Alonzo, with tears of wonder and delight,
fall on my neck, and swear his soul's ambition knew no other leader.


Val. And whose rude foot destroyed the hopeful seed?


Piz. Smooth-tongued Las Casas. He it was, with fascinating craft and canting
precepts of humanity, raised in Alonzo's mind a visionary enthusiasm, which
forced him, as the stripling termed it, to forego his country's claims for
those of human nature.


Val. And so become thy enemy and Spain's.


Piz. But first, with weariless remonstrance, he strove to win me from my
purpose, and wrest the sword from my determined grasp, calling the Peruvians
our brethren.


Val. Heathens our brethren! In that I see Las Casas.


Piz. But when he found that his tears fell on marble, he flew and joined the
foe: then, profiting by the lessons he had gained in wronged Pizarro's school,
the youth so disciplined and led his new allies, that soon he forced me -- Ha!
I burn with shame and fury while I own it! -- in base discomfiture to quit the
shore.


Val. But the hour of revenge is come.


Piz. It is! -- With mightier power, a second time I tread Peruvia's strand.
Soon shall Alonzo know Pizarro lives.


Val. It is yet a question, whether Alonzo lives.


Piz. Even now, one of his armour-bearers is made prisoner. He says the foe is
full twelve thousand strong, led by Alonzo and a chief called Rolla. This day
they sacrifice unto their God. We must profit by their security; attack them
unprepared, and make their altars reek with human blood. (Sound of trumpets.)
Right! The leaders obey my summons to counsel -- and then -- to battle! Elvira,
retire!


El. Why?


Piz. Men are to meet here.


El. O, men! men! ungrateful and perverse. O, woman! still affectionate, though
wronged. Those beings to whom in prosperity you look for added rapture, and on
whose bosoms you seek for rest in adversity, when the pompous follies of your
mean ambition is the question, you treat as play-things or as slaves. I shall
remain.


Piz. Remain, then, and be silent if thou can.


El. I shall think -- and the thoughtful are always silent.


Piz. There Is somewhat in her manner lately -- (Pizarro looks sternly and
suspiciously at Elvira, who meets him with a commanding and unaltered eye.)


Enter LAS CASAS, ALMAGRO, OFFICERS and SOLDIERS. Trumpets without. L. C.
Pizarro, we attend your summons.


Piz. Venerable father, welcome! Welcome, friends and fellow soldiers! The
moment has arrived which, to Pizarro's hopes, presents the full reward of our
undaunted enterprise and long enduring toils. The enemy today, sunk in
security, devote themselves to solemn sacrifice. Let us surprise them. Death to
the armed -- to the defenseless, chains!


Al. Death to the whole unbelieving race.


Val. For the honor of our faith.


L. C. (Fixing his eye on Valverde.) Blaspheme not! The basis of the Christian
faith is love!


Piz. We suffer famine, and the soldiers murmur.


Al. Whilst Alonzo, basking at his ease, mocks at our sufferings.


L. C. You do him wrong. My heart tells me, that the struggles in Alonzo's
bosom, between benevolence and patriotism, have left him little ease.


Al. It Is fit Las Casas should defend his pupil.


L. C. He is my pupil, and I glory in him.


Piz. Name not the traitor! Are we agreed for battle?


Al. All! lead us to battle, Pizarro!


Officers and Soldiers. Battle!


L. C. What a frightful echo! Battle! Gracious heavens! against whom? Against a
king who but yet a few days past stretched out to you the hand of friendship
and of peace. Against a people who never wronged the living being their creator
formed. A people, who, children of innocence! received you with hospitality and
kindness. Generously and freely did they share with you their comforts, their
treasures and their homes: you repaid them by fraud, oppression and dishonor.
These eyes have witnessed all I speak -- as gods you were received; as fiends
have you acted.


Val. They are heathens.


L. C. They are men. Hear me Pizarro! Hear me ye chieftains! And thou
all-powerful! whose thunders can rive the adamantive rock, and whose light and
warmth can melt the icy mountain into refreshing rivulets -- Oh! let thy power
give effect to thy servant's words, as the consciousness of right gives courage
to his will! Do not, I implore you, countrymen -- do not renew the foul
barbarities which your insatiate avarice has inflicted on this wretched,
unoffending race. The scenes which I have seen and could describe, would force
tears from the eyes of tigers. -- Hush my sighs -- drops of bitterness! choke
not my utterance! --


Piz. You exaggerate, Las Casas.


L. C. O, would to God I had already said the half of what I know! Donna Elvira
-- you weep! -- Alas! does the woe of this people move no other hearts than
thine and mine?


Al. There are no other women here but she and thou.


Piz. Close this idle war of words. Time flies, and our opportunity will be
lost. Comrades, are you for battle?


All. We are!


L. C. O! send me once more to those you call your enemies. O! let me bear the
words of penitence and peace, and preach our blessed religion uninterrupted by
the cries of blood!


Al. The sword of your hero shall prepare your way.


L. C. God! thou have anointed me thy servant, not to curse, but to bless. But
blessings on these men were blasphemy. No! I curse your purpose, fratricides. I
curse the bond of blood by which you are united. May fell division, infamy, and
rout, defeat your purpose and rebuke your hopes. I leave you, and forever! No
longer will I be the witness of these horrors. In caves and forests will I hide
myself. With tigers and with savage beasts commune. And, when we meet before
him whose mild doctrines you have this day renounced, tremble at the sight of
your accuser! (Going.)


El. Las Casas! O, take me with thee, Las Casas!


L. C. Nay, stay! Be thou the guardian of the innocent. Perhaps thy loveliness
may move to pity, where reason and religion plead in vain. Perhaps thou art
marked by heaven as the protecting angel of suffering Peru! Exit.


Piz. Elvira! would thou leave me?


El. I am bewildered. I am awaking from a dream. Las Casas has aroused me. O!
to my fancy, he appeared, but now, a being supernatural; and you -- a herd
beneath humanity.


Piz. Compassion sometimes becomes a woman.


El. Humanity always becomes a conqueror.


Piz. Now to prepare our muster and our march. At mid day is the hour of
sacrifice. Then, Almagro, march you with the left division through the wood.
You, Gonzalo, climb the hills with the right. I push straight forward. If we
surprise, we conquer; and if we conquer, the gates of Quito will be open to us.


Al. Then shall we hail thee monarch of Peru!


Piz. Not so fast. Ataliba still must retain the shadow of power; Pizarro still
appear dependent upon Spain. While the pledge of future peace, his daughter's
hand, secures my succession to the throne.


Al. Pizarro is both hero and statesman.


Val. You mark, Elvira.


El. It Is excellent.


Piz. Elvira -- you seem offended.


El. Offended? -- No! -- Thou know thy glory is my idol; and this is most
glorious, most just and honorable.


Piz. What mean you?


El. Oh! nothing -- mere woman's prattle. Let it not impede the royal hero's
course. (Trumpets.) The call of arms invites you. Away! away! ye valiant
warriors.


Piz. And go you not with me?


El. Undoubtedly! I must be the first to hail the future monarch of Peru.


Enter DAVILLA. Al. What bring thou, Davilla?


Dav. A prisoner. The guards on yonder hill, among the palms, have surprised an
old cacique. He resisted not; but every word he utters is fraught with
bitterness and scorn.


Piz. Lead him hither. (Davilla goes out, and returns with Orozimbo in chains
and guarded.) Who art thou?


Oro. Where is the leader of this band of robbers?


Piz. Ha!


Al. Madman! Tear out his tongue!


Oro. Or else you will hear the truth.


Al. (Showing his poinard.) Shall I not plunge this to his heart?


Oro. Does your army boast many such heroes as this?


Piz. Grey-headed ruffian, thou shall die.


Oro. That have I known since first I knew to live.


Piz. Less insolence perhaps had saved thy life.


Oro. My life is a withered tree -- it is not worth preserving.


Al. Purchase our friendship, and our swords shall place thee at the head of
thy people.


Oro. That was ever my station in the hour of danger.


Piz. We now march against your army. Be our guide through the wood, and we
will load you with treasure.


Oro. Ha, ha, ha, ha!


Piz. Do thou despise my offer?


Oro. Compared to mine, thy wealth is beggary. My treasures are so great, I
cannot ask the bounteous gods for more.


Piz. Indeed! In what do they consist?


Oro. First of my wealth, I count two valiant sons, armed for their country.
The rest consists of eighty active years spent in that country's service; these
are the treasures Orozimbo counts -- for every day a deed of righteousness.


Al. It Is not such wealth we seek, or question of.


Oro. No. Else had you never vexed the troubled seas, or stained these shores
with blood. The treasures of the soul are found at home.


Piz. How numerous is your army?


Oro. Count the trees of the forest.


Al. Which is the weakest part of your camp?


Oro. It has no weak part -- on every side it is fortified by justice.


Piz. At what hour do you offer sacrifice to your God?


Oro. The sacrifice of thankful hearts, every hour of the day.


Piz. Where have you concealed your wives and children?


Oro. In the hearts of their husbands and fathers.


Piz. Know thou Alonzo?


Oro. Know him! The benefactor of our nation!


Piz. By what has he merited that title?


Oro. By being the reverse of thee.


Al. Who is this Rolla, joined in command with Alonzo?


Oro. The first of heroes, and the best of men! The kinsman of the king, the
idol of the army, the friend of Alonzo, the lover of Cora; a lover who gave his
beloved to the man she loved, and loved that man for her sake.


Piz. Romantic savage! -- I shall meet this Rolla soon.


Oro. Thou had better not! Thou art not fit for death.


Al. Silence, old savage.


Oro. Why silence? When I address my God, I speak the truth; and shall I fear
to speak the truth to man?


Al. Silence, or tremble.


Oro. Beardless robber! I never yet have trembled before God -- why should I
tremble before man? before thee, thou less than man?


Al. Another word thou heathen dog, and I strike thee to the earth. (Draws his
dagger.)


Oro. Strike, Christian! Then boast among your fellows -- "I too have murdered
a Peruvian!"


Al. To hell with thee! (Stabs him.)


Piz. Hold! (Soldiers support Orozimbo.)


Al. Could thou longer have endured his insults?


Piz. And therefore should he die untortured?


Oro. Young man, you have lost a useful lesson; you might have seen with what
cruelty vengeance inflicts torments, and with what patience virtue bears them.


El. (Supporting Orozimbo's head upon her bosom.) O, you are monsters all! Look
up thou martyred innocent -- look up once more, and bless me ere thou die.
God! how I pity thee!


Oro. Pity me! me! so near my happiness. -- My wife beckons me to the land of
our fathers! -- The sun smiles! -- Spaniards -- heaven turn your hearts and
bless you! -- (Borne off, dying, by two Soldiers.)


El. Valverde -- Is not that the death of a christian?


Piz. Follow me, friends! Each to his post; and, ere Peruvia's god shall sink
beneath the main, the Spanish banners, bathed in blood, shall float above the
walls of Quito. Exeunt.


(Elvira and Valverde remain.) Val. Is it presumption, that my hopes gain
strength as Pizarro's overbearing cruelty increases?


El. I am mad with terror and remorse! Would I could fly these dreadful scenes!


Val. Might not Valverde's true attachment be thy refuge?


El. What would thou do to deserve me?


Val. One well aimed blow might save Peru -- avenge Elvira's injuries!


El. Save this innocent people? Restore a nation's happiness? -- Go -- go --
leave me alone.


Val. One word, and he lies bleeding at thy feet.


Exit. El. No! -- Shall murder also stand upon my soul? No! -- Fie, Elvira!
even for a moment to counsel with this unworthy traitor! Pizarro will abandon
me! -- me, who for his sake have sacrificed -- Oh, God! what have I not
sacrificed to him? -- Abandon me? No! I abandon him! -- I loved the hero; but
despise the robber! My love is past -- but hold -- try him once more, Elvira.
And if he is lost to reason and humanity -- abandon his unhallowed camp; nay,
cast him to the dust from which he sprung.


END OF FIRST ACT.
ACT SECOND.
SCENE FIRST.
A wood. -- CORA, sitting at the root of a tree, is playing with her CHILD.
ALONZO looks over them with delight. Co. (Looks smiling at the child and then
at Alonzo.) Now confess, does he resemble thee or not?


Alon. He looks like thee much more.


Co. No, no -- his hair -- the color of his eyes! O! my lord's image, and my
heart's adored!


(Pressing the child to her bosom.) Alon. The little urchin robs me of thy love.


Co. O no, Alonzo!


Alon. At least he steals caresses which once were mine -- and mine alone.


Co. When the mother caresses her child, she never forgets the father. I live
but in him and thee. Look, Alonzo! I am sure he will speak soon; then will be
the last of the three great holidays allowed by nature's sanction to the fond
mother's heart.


Alon. What are these three?


Co. When first the white blossoms of his teeth appear, breaking the crimson
buds that did encase them, that is a day of joy; next, when from his father's
arms he runs without support, and clings, laughing and delighted, to his
mother's knee, that is the mother's heart's next holliday. And sweeter still
the third, whenever his little stammering tongue shall utter the grateful sound
of father! mother! O! that is the dearest joy of all!


Alon. Beloved Cora!


Co. O, my Alonzo! daily will we pour our thanks to heaven!


Alon. To heaven, and Rolla!


Co. Art thou not happy?


Alon. Can Cora ask that question?


Co. Why then of late so restless on thy couch? Why do thy sighs torture thy
Cora's car?


Alon. Must not I fight with my brethren?


Co. With those who would destroy us. All men are brethren.


Alon. Should they prove victorious?


Co. I will fly and meet thee on the mountains.


Alon. Fly! -- with thy infant in thy arms?


Co. Why not? Think you a mother, when she flies from danger, can feel the
weight of her child?


Alon. Willingly would I share with you the precious burden. -- Cora -- dear
Cora -- would thou set my heart at rest?


Co. Oh yes! yes! yes!


Alon. Fly then, now, even today, to the mountains, to thy aged father, there
thou art safe. Then go it as it will, I feel secure. I either bring thee
tidings of victory, or come to end my life, with thee, with innocence and
nature.


Co. And to rear up our son to be the deliverer of his country.


Alon. That will we!


Co. Yes, but I cannot leave you, Alonzo. The thought of your danger will chain
my feet. The thought of you wounded -- alone -- abandoned. -- No, no, I cannot
leave you.


Alon. Rolla will be with me.


Co. Yes, where the battle rages. Rolla knows to deal wounds, but it is Cora's
part to bind them. He will avenge, not save thee. No, where the husband is,
there must the wife be also. I swear, not to leave thee until death!


Alon. Remain, then, soul of truth! And may God give us the victory!


Co. Is not our cause just? The protection of heaven is with us.


Alon. If not -- I shall die in thy arms.


Co. O, speak not of death. -- Since I have had thee and this little one -- I
cannot think of death.


Alon. O, excellence in all that is great and lovely, in courage, gentleness and
truth: my pride, content, my all! Can there on earth be fools who seek for
happiness, and pass by love in the pursuit?


Co. Alonzo, I cannot thank you -- silence is the language of love and
gratitude. (Shouts without.) Does the king approach?


Alon. No, it is Rolla, placing the guard which will surround the temple during
the sacrifice. The first of heroes, and the best of friends.


Enter ROLLA. Roll. (As entering.) Then place them on the hill fronting the
Spanish camp.


Co. Rolla! our brother.


Alon. Our more than brother -- friend!


Roll. Right! A friend who shares your happiness.


Co. Look on this child. If ever he does less for thee than for his father --
his mother's hate be on him!


Roll. Enough, enough! the object of my love was Cora's happiness. I see her
happy, and I am rewarded. Now, Cora, listen to a friend's advice. Fly with thy
child, deep in the forest, or to the mountains; here thou art not safe.


Co. Not safe with thee and Alonzo?


Roll. Pizarro's plan is to surprise us. Your presence will impede our efforts.


Co. Impede?


Roll. Thou know how tenderly we love. If thou art near, our thoughts, our
valor will not be our own. No advantage will be pursued that leads us from the
spot where you are placed; no succor will be given but for your protection.


Alon. Rolla is right. How should I dare to pierce the Spanish ranks, if but
one Spaniard should remain behind me, who might cut his way to the spot where
my Cora remained defenseless. You must be safe, or Alonzo is no general!


Co. (Smiling.) This is flattering to the vanity of the woman, but the wife
hears it not.


Alon. And is the mother also deaf?


Co. My confidence in thee, and in the gods, would have supported me. But for
thy peace, my husband, I obey thee.


Alon. Thank thee, my Cora. (March without.) Hark! the king approaches to
sacrifice. Rolla, is every post prepared against surprise?


Roll. All is prepared.


Alon. Then shall Cora, upon the rocky altar of the mountain, in the temple of
nature, implore a blessing on the efforts of the husband and the friend.


Roll. Yes, Cora, the pious supplications of the trembling wife and mother's
heart, rise to the throne of mercy, the most resistless prayer of human homage.
Exeunt.


SCENE SECOND.
Temple of the sun, with all the magnificence of Peruvian superstition. In the
center an altar. SOLEMN MARCH. The WARRIORS, headed by ATALIBA, enter on one
side. ROLLA, ALONZO and CORA on the other. Ata. Welcome, Alonzo! Rolla! my
kinsman, thy hand. (To Cora.) Heaven bless thee, joyful mother!


Co. May the sun bless the father of his people!


Ata. The children's welfare is the father's joy. (Takes the center of the
stage. Alonzo and Cora on his right. Rolla on his left.) Friends, what is the
temper of our soldiers?


Alon. Their joyful shout is, "The father of his people is with us!"


Roll. "He shares in our dangers and our toils!"


Alon. "God and the king!"


Roll. "Victory or death!"


Ata. I know my people! When this shield is pierced, not a man but will lend me
his breast! But, tell me, where are our enemies?


Roll. In their camp; motionless, but portending mischief. Like the
thunder-cloud on the brow of the distant mountain.


Ata. Tranquil courage be our safeguard.


Roll. They fight for gold, we for our country.


Alon. A robber leads them to battle, but with us is the beloved of his people.


Ata. And the god of our fathers! Come, friends, prepare for the sacrifice.


A SOLEMN PROCESSION commences from the recess of the temple above the altar.
The PRIESTS and VIRGINS OF THE SUN arrange themselves on either side. The HIGH
PRIEST approaches the altar. HIGH PRIEST SINGS. O glorious sun! Parent of light
and life!
Smile on thy children in the day of strife.
As by thy influence from the parent earth
The sap springs upward to the tender flower,
So from this soil may confidence and worth,
Arise and swell each heart to meet the coming hour!
CHORUS. VIRGINS OF THE SUN. O glorious sun! etc.

HIGH PRIEST. May the infants lisping please thee!
As he prays for his father's return.
May the prayers of the aged please thee!
While their hearts for their country burn.

( The youngest of the virgins of the sun, presents a basket of flowers to the
KING.) CHORUS. PRIESTS. O glorious sun! etc.

HIGH PRIEST. Kneel, children of the sun!
Through prayer the smiles of heaven are won.

CHORUS. THE WHOLE KNEELING. God of Peru! to thee we kneel. O give
That still thy children in thy smiles may live.

( During this, ATALIBA approaches and casts the flowers on the altar.) CHORUS.
PRIESTS. O give, great God! Some favorable sign
That thou acceptest of our humble praise!
Send forth, O source of heat! a beam benign!
Consume this offering with thy sacred rays.
(A flame descends and consumes the offering.) ALL RISE AND JOIN IN CHORUS.
Triumph! Triumph! Our prayer is heard!
Let shouts of triumph rend the air:
Peruvia's God has heard our prayer!
Now bend the bow and draw the sword,
And "victory or death" be each Peruvian's word!

Enter ORANO. Ora. The enemy!


Ata. How near?


Ora. As I approached their camp from the brow of the hill, I beheld them
suddenly rush out.


Roll. We know enough.


Ata. Lead the women and children to the place of safety. Exeunt Priests and
women.


Co. Oh, Alonzo!


Alon. We shall meet again.


Co. Bless thy son.


Alon. The blessing of heaven be on him and thee.


Ata. Haste, haste -- the moments are precious.


Co. Farewell, Alonzo. Remember, thy life is mine.


Roll. Say thou not a word to me, Cora.


Co. (Giving him her hand.) Bring me back Alonzo. Exit.


Ata. (Draws his sword.) Now, my brethren, my sons, my friends, I know your
valor. Should ill success assail us, be despair the last feeling of your
hearts. If successful, let mercy be the first. Alonzo, to you I give to defend
the narrow passage of the mountains. On the right of the wood be Rolla's
station. For me, straight forward will I march to meet them, and fight until I
see my people saved, or they behold their monarch fall. Be the word of battle
-- God and our native land.


(A march.) Exeunt. SCENE THIRD.
A wood. Enter ROLLA and ALONZO. Roll. Here, my friend, we separate. -- Soon, I
trust, to meet again in triumph.


Alon. Or, perhaps, we part to meet no more. Rolla, a moment's pause; we are
yet before our army's strength; one earnest word at parting.


Roll. There is in language now no word but battle.


Alon. Yes, one word more -- Cora!


Roll. Cora! -- Speak!


Alon. The next hour brings us --


Roll. Death or victory!


Alon. It may be victory to one -- death to the other.


Roll. Or both may fall.


Alon. If so, my wife and child I bequeath to the protection of heaven and the
king. But should I only fall, Rolla, be thou my heir.


Roll. How?


Alon. Be Cora thy wife -- be thou a father to my child.


Roll. Rouse thee, Alonzo! Banish these timid fancies.


Alon. Rolla! I have tried in vain, and cannot fly from the foreboding which
oppresses me. Thou know it will not shake me in the fight: but give me thy
promise.


Roll. If it be Cora's will. -- Yes -- I promise. --


(Gives his hand.) Alon. Tell her it was my last wish! And bear to her and to
my son, my last blessing.


Roll. I will. -- Now then to our posts, and let our swords speak for us.


Alon. Yet one moment. Let my body be buried under the palm tree, where we are
wont in the evening to sit, and desert not the place after my death, but do
thou and Cora, each evening visit the palm and sit on the grave of your friend.
-- And when my boy breaks a flower from the swerd of the grave, or the wind
rustles among the palm-leaves -- then think of Alonzo.


Roll. Away with these fancies.


Alon. (Seizing his hand.) Then think on me.


Roll. That will we.


Alon. Now, then, away to the fight!


Roll. Thee left, I right. (They draw.)


Alon. For the king and Cora!


Roll. For Cora and the king!


Exeunt different ways. Alarms. SCENE FOURTH.
A distant view of a Peruvian village. Trees growing from a rocky eminence on
one side. Alarms continued. Drums, etc. at a distance. Enter an OLD BLIND MAN
and a BOY. O. M. Hark! I hear the din of battle! Oh, my sight! had I retained
my sight, I might now have grasped a sword, and died the death of a soldier.


Boy. Shall I lead you back to your hut?


O. M. No. Are we quite alone?


Boy. Yes. My father is with the army, and my mother I know not where.


O. M. I am anxious for you, poor boy.


Boy. I can stay with you, dear grandfather.


O. M. But should the enemy come, they will drag thee from me, dear boy.


Boy. Impossible, grandfather! for they will see at once that you are old and
blind, and cannot do without me.


O. M. Poor child -- you little know these men. (Cannon heard.) Hark! can you
see nothing, boy?


Boy. We are too low.


O. M. Is there no hill near us?


Boy. I can climb this rock, and the tree above it.


O. M. Haste. (The Boy climbs up.) This is the first fight without me. The day
was, when I could bend as stout a bow as that which Rolla bears. But now, now
must I hear only how the swords glitter and the shields clash -- and, at the
sound of the war-horn, I strike my hand upon my thigh, but no longer find a
sword. -- Now, boy, what see thou?


Boy. Dust and smoke. Now the smoke is blown off -- I see our people.


O. M. Marching forwards?


Boy. They stand.


O. M. Do you see the standard of the Incas?


Boy. It waves in the midst.


O. M. Thanks to the gods -- the king lives!


Boy. Now I see the enemy. -- Now they mix with our people.


O. M. And fall? -- (Cannon.)


Boy. It thunders and lightens! -- The standard of the Inca falls.


O. M. Come down! -- Come down! -- See no more!


Boy. Our army retreats.


O. M. My sword! My sword! O glorious sun! Only one hour let thy light reach my
eyes!


Boy. A small troop comes this way --


O. M. Spaniards?


Boy. The heads of their lances glitter --


O. M. Fly, boy -- fly to the mountains.


Boy. Will you seek my mother?


O. M. My grave, boy -- my open grave! (They retire up.)


Enter ATALIBA, with ORANO and WARRIORS. Ata. My wound is bound; the hurt is
nothing. I may return to the field.


Ora. Pardon your servant; but the allotted priest, who attends the sacred
banner, has pronounced, that the Inca's blood once shed, no blessing can await
the day until he leave the field.


Ata. Hard restraint! O, my brave soldiers! Hard, that I may no longer be a
witness of their valor. But haste your return to your comrades; I will not keep
one soldier from his post. Go, and avenge your fallen brethren. (Exeunt Orano
and Warriors.) I will not repine; my own fate is the least anxiety of my heart.
It is for you, my people, that I feel and fear.


(Old Man and Boy advance.) O. M. I hear an unfortunate. Who is the moaner?


Ata. A wretch abandoned -- almost by hope.


O. M. Lives the king still?


Ata. He lives.


O. M. Then are you not abandoned. Ataliba protects the meanest of his children.


Ata. And who shall protect Ataliba?


O. M. The gods.


Ata. Their anger is upon him.


O. M. That cannot be. He has never withheld justice or oppressed the weak; he
has never fattened his courtiers with the sweat of the peasants. He has never
shut his hand to the poor, or his car to the unfortunate.


Ata. God! thou have thrown into this bitter hour the sweetest moment of my
life!


Boy. O, father! stranger! see these hideous men that rush upon us yonder.


Ata. Ha! Spaniards! And I -- Ataliba -- ill-fated fugitive, without a sword to
try the ransom of a monarch's life.


Enter DAVILLA, ALMAGRO, and SPANISH SOLDIERS. Dav. It Is he -- our hopes are
answered -- I know him well -- it is the king!


Al. Away! follow with your royal prize. -- Avoid those Peruvians though in
flight. This way we may regain our line. (Exeunt Davilla, Almagro, and Spanish
Soldiers, with Ataliba prisoner.)


O. M. The king! Wretched old man, that could not see his gracious form! --
Boy, would thou had led me to the reach of those ruffian's swords.


Boy. Father! all our countrymen are flying here for refuge.


O. M. No! -- to the rescue of their king -- they will never desert him.


Enter PERUVIAN OFFICERS and SOLDIERS, flying across the stage; ORANO
following. Ora. Hold, I charge you! Rolla calls you.


Officer. We cannot combat with their dreadful engines.


Enter ROLLA. Roll. Hold, recreants! cowards! What, fear ye death? and fear not
shame? By my soul's fury, I cleave to the earth the first of you that stirs --
or plunge your dastard swords into your leader's heart, that he no more may
witness your disgrace. Where is the king?


Ora. From this old man and boy I learn, that the detachment of the enemy,
which you observed so suddenly to quit the field, have succeeded in surprising
him; they are yet in sight.


Roll. And bear the Inca off a prisoner? Hear this, ye base, disloyal rout! Look
there! The dust you see hangs on the bloody Spaniards track, dragging with
ruffian taunts your king, your father! -- Ataliba in bondage. Now fly, and seek
your own vile safety, if you can.


O. M. Bless the voice of Rolla! -- and bless the stroke I once lamented, but
which now spares these extinguished eyes the shame of seeing the pale trembling
wretches, who dare not follow Rolla, though to save the king!


Roll. Shrink ye from the thunder of the foe -- and fall ye not at this rebuke?
Oh! had ye each but one drop of the loyal blood, which gushes to waste through
the brave heart of this sightless veteran! Eternal shame pursue you, if you
desert me now! But do -- alone I go -- alone -- to die with glory by my
monarch's side!


Sol's. Rolla! We'll follow thee.


Roll. God and our native land. (Trumpets sound; Rolla rushes out, followed by
Orano, Officers and Soldiers.)


O. M. O, godlike Rolla! -- And thou sun, send from thy clouds avenging
lightning to his aid! -- Haste, my boy; ascend some height, and tell to my
impatient terror what thou see.


Boy. (Ascends the rock, and from thence into the tree.) O -- now I see them --
now -- yes -- and the Spaniards turning by the steep.


O. M. Rolla follows them?


Boy. He does -- he does -- he moves like an arrow! -- now he waves his arm to
our soldiers. -- (Cannon heard.) Now there is fire and smoke.


O. M. Yes, fire is the weapon of those fiends.


Boy. The wind blows off the smoke; they are all mixed together.


O. M. See thou the king?


Boy. Yes -- Rolla is near him! his sword sheds fire as he strikes!


O. M. Bless thee, Rolla! Spare not the monsters.


Boy. Father! father! The Spaniards fly -- O -- now I see the king embracing
Rolla. (Waving his cap for joy. Shouts of victory. Flourish of trumpets, etc.)


O. M. (Falls on his knees.) Fountain of life! how can my exhausted breath bear
to thee thanks for this one moment of my life! My boy, come down, and let me
kiss thee. -- My strength is gone!


(The Boy having run to the Old Man --) Boy. Let me help you, father -- you
tremble so --


O. M. It Is with transport, boy! It is with transport! --


(Boy leads the Old Man off. Shouts, flourish, etc.) Enter ATALIBA, ROLLA, and
PERUVIAN OFFICERS and SOLDIERS. Ata. In the name of my people, the savior of
whose sovereign you have this day been, accept this emblem of his gratitude.
(Giving Rolla his sun of diamonds.) The tear that falls upon it may for a
moment dim its luster, yet does it not impair the value of the gift.


Roll. It was the hand of heaven, not mine, that saved the king.


Enter ORANO and SOLDIERS. Roll. Now, soldier, what news from Alonzo?


Ora. Alonzo's genius soon repaid the panic which broke our ranks; but I fear
we have to mourn Alonzo's loss; his eager spirit urged him too far in the
pursuit.


Ata. How! Alonzo slain?


Sol. I saw him fall.


Ora. Trust me, I beheld him up again and fighting -- he was then surrounded
and disarmed.


Ata. O! victory, dearly purchased!


Roll. O, Cora! Who shall tell thee this?


Ata. Rolla, our friend is lost -- our native country saved! Our private
sorrows must yield to the public claim for triumph. Now go we to fulfill the
first, the most sacred duty which belongs to victory -- to dry the widowed and
the orphaned tear of those whose brave protectors have perished in their
country's cause.


(Triumphant March, and Exeunt.) END OF SECOND ACT.
ACT THIRD.
SCENE FIRST.
A wild retreat among stupendous rocks -- CORA and her Child, with other Wives
and Children of the Peruvian Warriors, are scattered about the scene in groups.
1 st. P. Wom. Zuluga, see thou nothing yet?


2 d. P. Wom. Yes, two Peruvian soldiers; one on the hill, the other entering a
thicket in the vale.


3 d. P. Wom. One more has passed. -- He comes -- but pale and terrified.


Co. My heart will start from my bosom.


Enter a PERUVIAN SOLDIER. 1 st. Wom. Well! joy or death?


1 st. Sol. The battle is against us. The king is wounded and a prisoner.


1 st. Wom. Despair and misery!


Co. (In a faint voice.) And Alonzo?


1 st. Sol. I saw him not. Exit.


1 st. Wom. O, whither must we fly?


2 d. Wom. Deeper into the forest.


Co. I shall not move.


Enter 2 d PERUVIAN. 2 d Per. Still there is hope -- the battle turns.


1 st. Wom. Hope?


2 d. Per. Rolla has rallied the troops. -- They rush upon the enemy --


Co. And Alonzo?


2 d. Per. I saw him not. Exit.


Enter ORANO. Ora. Victory! victory!


1 st. Wom. Does the king live?


Ora. He lives -- Rolla has saved him -- saved his country!


Co. And Alonzo?


Ora. I saw him not. Exit.


(The triumphant march of the army is heard at a distance. The Women and
Children go to meet them. The Warriors enter, marching down the rocks, the
women strewing flowers before them. They range on each side. The King and Rolla
follow, and are met with rapturous and affectionate, respect. Cora, during this
scene, with her Child in her arms, runs through the ranks searching and
enquiring for Alonzo.) Ata. Thanks, thanks, my children! I am well; believe it;
the blood once stopped, my wound was nothing.


(Cora at length approaches Rolla, who appears to have been mournfully avoiding
her.) Co. Where is Alonzo?


(Rolla turns away mournfully.) Co. (Falling at the King's feet.) Give me my
husband; give this child his father.


Ata. I grieve that Alonzo is not here.


Co. Hoped you to find him?


Ata. Most anxiously.


Co. Ataliba, is he not dead?


Ata. No! the gods will have heard our prayers.


Co. Is he not dead, Ataliba?


Ata. He lives -- in my heart.


Co. O, king! torture me not thus! Speak out, is this child fatherless?


Ata. Dearest Cora! do not thus dash aside the little hope that still remains.


Co. The little hope! Yet still there is hope! Speak to me, Rolla, you are the
friend of truth.


Roll. Alonzo has not been found.


Co. Not found! What mean you? Will not you, Rolla, tell me the truth? Oh! let
not the lightning linger in its course -- Straight to my heart let it pierce.
Say not that he is not found; say, at once, that he is dead.


Roll. Then should I say false.


Co. False! Blessings on thee for that word! But snatch me from this terrible
suspense. Lift up thy little hands, my child; perhaps thy innocence may plead
better than thy mother's agony.


Roll. Alonzo is taken prisoner.


Co. Prisoner! And by the Spaniards? Pizarro's prisoner? Then is he dead.


Ata. Hope better -- the richest ransom which our realm can yield, a herald
shall this instant bear.


1 st. P. Wom. Oh! for Alonzo's ransom -- our gold, our gems! -- all! all! --
Here, dear Cora -- here! here!


(The Peruvian Women eagerly tear off all their ornaments, and run and take
them from their Children, to offer them to Cora.) Ata. Yes, for Alonzo's ransom
they would give all! -- I thank thee, Father, who have given me such hearts to
rule over!


Co. Now, one boon more, beloved monarch. Let me go with the herald.


Ata. Remember, Cora, thou art not a wife only, but a mother too. Hazard not
your own honor, and the safety of your infant. Among these barbarians, the
sight of thy youth, thy loveliness and innocence would but rivet faster your
Alonzo's chains, and rack his heart with added fears for thee. Wait, Cora, the
return of the herald.


Co. Teach me how to live till then.


Ata. Now we go to offer to the gods, thanks for our victory, and prayers for
our Alonzo's safety.


MARCH AND PROCESSION. The King and Rolla; then the Warriors; then the Women
and Children. Last Cora with her Infant. Exeunt omnes. SCENE SECOND.
The wood. Enter CORA with the CHILD. Co. What will become of thee -- precious
treasure -- the fountain of thy life is dried up.


Enter ROLLA, meeting her. Roll. Cora, I attend your summons.


Co. O, my child, my boy! have thou still a father?


Roll. Cora, can thy child be fatherless, while Rolla lives?


Co. Will he not soon want a mother too? -- Or think thou I can survive
Alonzo's loss?


Roll. Yes! for his child's sake.


Co. Poor child! shall it be nourished by the tears of its mother?


Roll. Listen to Alonzo's friend --


Co. Alonzo's friend! Who was not the friend of Alonzo?


Roll. His last words before the battle --


Co. His last words -- speak!


Roll. He consigned to me, two precious trusts -- his blessing for his son, and
his last request to thee.


Co. His last request! His last! -- O, name it.


Roll. "If I fall" said he, and grasped my hand, "be Cora thy wife."


Co. Thy wife!


Roll. I gave my word, and we pa^^^d.


Co. What a horrid light rushes on me! O, Alonzo! thou have fallen a victim to
thy heart's confidence! Had thou been silent -- had thou not made these
fatal charms a legacy to --


Roll. What a frightful image has seized thy soul! --


Co. It Is clear -- his spirit was ensnared; he was led to the fatal spot where
mortal valor could not front a host of murderers. He fell -- in vain did he
exclaim for help to Rolla. At a distance you looked on and smiled. You could
have saved him -- could -- but did not.


Roll. O, glorious sun! Can I have deserved this? Cora, rather bid me strike
this sword into my heart.


Co. No! live! live for love! for that love thou seek; whose blossoms are to
shoot from the bleeding grave of thy betrayed and slaughtered friend! -- But
thou have borne to me the last words of my Alonzo! Now hear mine. Sooner shall
this boy draw poison from this tortured breast -- sooner would I link me to the
pallid corse of the meanest wretch that perished with Alonzo, than he call
Rolla father -- than I call Rolla husband!


Roll. Yet call me what I am -- thy friend, thy protector!


Co. (Distractedly.) Away! I have no protector but my God! -- With this child
in my arms, will I hasten to the field of slaughter. There, with these hands,
will I turn up to the light every mangled body. Seeking, however by death
disfigured, the sweet smile of my Alonzo. -- With fearful cries will I shriek
out his name, till my veins snap! If the smallest spark of life remains, he
will know the voice of his Cora, open for a moment his unshrouded eyes, and
bless me with a last look; but if we find him not -- Oh! then, my boy, we will
to the Spanish camp. -- That look of thine, will win me passage through a
thousand swords -- they too are men. Is there a heart that could drive back a
wife that seeks her bleeding husband; or the innocent babe that cries for his
imprisoned father? No, no, my child, every where we shall be safe. A wretched
mother, bearing a poor orphan in her arms, has nature's passport through the
world. Yes, yes, my son, we'll go and seek thy father. Exit with the Child.


Roll. (After a pause of agitation.) Could I have merited one breath of thy
reproaches, Cora, I should be the wretch -- I think I was not formed to be. Her
safety must be my present purpose -- then to convince her she has wronged me!


Exit. SCENE THIRD.
Pizarro's Tent. PIZARRO, traversing the scene in gloomy and furious agitation.
Piz. Well, capricious idol, fortune, be my ruin thy work and boast. To myself I
will still be true. Yet ere I fall, grant me thy smile to prosper in one act of
vengeance, and be that smile Alonzo's death.


Enter ELVIRA. Piz. Who Is there? Who dares intrude? Why do my guards neglect
their duty?


El. Your guards did what they could; but they knew their duty better, than to
enforce authority when I refused obedience.


Piz. And what is your desire?


El. To see how a hero bears misfortunes.


Piz. Why did thou not see me in the midst of my flying army, when, with this
arm, I struck the fugitives to the earth? Thou should have seen me amidst my
o'erpowered soldiers, when the heads of thousands sunk low -- Then stood
Pizarro like a rock amidst the waters, nor bowed his head even to destiny.


El. I doubt not thy greatness in the roar of battle or the tumult of defeat.
But to know a hero thoroughly, I must see him in his tent, and alone.


Piz. Here see thou me. Am I humbled by defeat? Do you hear a fruitless
complaint from my lips?


El. Fie! Complaint! None but priests and women complain. -- But thy brow is
dark. Thou art not collected and serene.


Piz. Shall I rejoice that the bravest hearts of my followers have been pierced
by the spears of the foe?


El. Cold and silent should thou be, as the night that follows the storm. The
morning breaks, and, with strength renewed, reanimated by the beams of the new
sun, the hero walks forth, and is again himself.


Piz. Woman! -- Why on this day were not all my men like thee?


El. Then had my hand this day placed the crown of Quito on thy head.


Piz. Oh, Elvira! the flame of my hope glimmers weakly, while the scourge of my
life, Alonzo de Molina, directs the power of Peru.


El. Pizarro, I am come to probe the hero farther; not now his courage, but his
magnanimity -- Alonzo is your prisoner.


Piz. How?


El. Valverde saw him, even now, brought in chains to the camp.


Piz. Alonzo in my power! -- Oh, then, I am the conqueror! The power of Peru is
overthrown!


El. Believe me, you raise my impatience to see the man before whom Pizarro
trembles without hope.


Piz. Guards!


Enter SOLDIER. Piz. Bring hither the Spanish prisoner.


Exit Soldier. El. What shall be his fate?


Piz. Death!


El. Shame on thee! Shall the world say, that Pizarro could not conquer, until
he had murdered Alonzo?


Piz. Be it said -- I care not. His fate is sealed.


El. Follow then thy will; but, mark me, if basely thou do shed the blood of
this brave youth, Elvira's lost to thee forever.


Piz. Why this interest for a stranger? What is Alonzo's fate to thee?


El. His fate -- nothing! Thy glory -- every thing! Think thou I could love
thee, stripped of fame, of honor, and a just renown? Know me better.


Piz. Thou should have known me better. Thou should have known, that, once
provoked to hate, I am forever fixed in vengeance.


(ALONZO is brought in, chained and guarded. ELVIRA observes him with
attention.) Piz. Welcome, Don Alonzo de Molina; it is long since we saw each
other.


Alon. And yet we (...) too soon, Pizarro.


Piz. Thy looks are mended since our parting.


Alon. Yet have I not fattened on the blood and spoil of the unoffending.


Piz. What is thy secret, midst the toils of war, still to preserve the bloom
of careless ease?


Alon. Thou will not profit by it. Whatever the hardships or the cares of war,
peace reigns unshaken here. (Points to his heart.)


Piz. Sarcastic boy!


El. Thou art answered rightly. Why sport with the unfortunate.


Piz. We will no longer sport then. Alonzo, tomorrow thou die.


El. Pizarro -- no!


Piz. Hence! -- or dread my anger.


El. I will not hence, nor do I dread thy anger.


Alon. Generous lady! Spare thy unavailing pity. Seek not to thwart the tiger
with his prey beneath his fangs.


Piz. Audacious rebel! Thou, a renegado from thy monarch and thy God!


Alon. It Is false.


Piz. Art thou not, tell me, a deserter from thy country's legions -- and, with
vile heathens leagued, have thou not warred against thy native land?


Alon. No! Deserter I am none! I was not born among robbers! pirates!
murderers! -- When those legions, lured by the abhorred lust of gold, and by
thy foul ambition urged, forgot the honor of Castilians, and forsook the duties
of humanity, they forsook me. I have not warred against my native land, but
against those who have usurped its power. The banners of my country, when first
I followed arms beneath them, were Justice, Faith and Mercy. If these are
beaten down and trampled under foot -- I have no country, nor exists the power
entitled to reproach me with revolt.


Piz. The power to judge and punish thee, at least, exists.


Alon. Where are my judges?


Piz. Thou would appeal to the war council?


Alon. If the good Las Casas have yet a seat there, yes; if not, I appeal to
heaven!


Piz. And to impose upon the folly of Las Casas, what would be the excuses of
thy treason?


El. The folly of Las Casas! -- Such, doubtless, his mild precepts seem to thy
hard-hearted wisdom! O! would I might have lived as I will die, a sharer in the
follies of Las Casas!


Alon. With him I should not need to urge the foul barbarities which drove me
from your side; but I would gently lead him by the hand through all the lovely
fields of Quito; there, in many a spot where late was barrenness and waste, I
would show him how now the opening blossom, blade, or perfumed bud, sweet
bashful pledges of delicious harvest, wafting their incense to the ripening
sun, give cheerful promise to the hope of industry. This, I would say, is my
work! Next I should tell how hurtful customs, and superstitions strange and
sullen, would often scatter and dismay the credulous minds of these deluded
innocents; and then would I point out to him, where now, in clustered villages,
they live like brethren, social and confiding, while through the burning day
content sits basking on the cheek of toil, till laughing pastime leads them to
the hour of rest -- this too is mine! -- And prouder yet -- at that still pause
between exertion and repose, belonging not to pastime, labor, or to rest, but
unto him who sanctions and ordains them all, I would show him many an eye, and
many a hand, by gentleness from error won, raised in pure devotion to the true
and only God! -- this too, I could tell him is Alonzo's work! -- Then would Las
Casas clasp me in his aged arms; from his uplifted eyes a tear of gracious
thankfulness would fall upon my head, and that one blessed drop would be to me
at once this world's best proof, that I had acted rightly here, and surest hope
of my creator's mercy and reward hereafter.


Piz. Thou art what thou ever wast -- an enthusiast.


Alon. When this enthusiasm abandons me, I shall become worthy -- of Pizarro's
friendship.


Piz. Proud boy. Away and prepare for death.


Alon. I am always prepared.


Piz. The first beams of tomorrow's sun shall see thee die.


Alon. Thy ^^^geance is hasty. I thank thee for it. (Going.)


El. Hold Alonzo! -- Pizarro, this man shall not die.


Piz. Art thou mad?


El. If not justly, at least, act greatly. Name not thy country's wrongs --
it is plain they have no share in thy resentment. Thy fury against this man is
private hate, and deadly personal revenge; if this be so -- and even now thy
detected conscience in that look avows it -- profane not the name of justice or
thy country's cause, but let him arm, and bid him to the field on equal terms.


Piz. What! arm his hand again to shed the blood of his brethren?


Alon. Robbers were never my brethren.


Piz. Away! Thou know thy sentence.


Alon. I do. For thee, lady, accept my thanks. This camp is not thy proper
sphere. Were thou among yon savages, as they are called, thou would find
companions more congenial to thy heart. For there reigns nature and humanity.


Exit Alonzo and guards. El. How I admire this man!


Piz. Soon may thou say, I did admire him.


El. Meanest thou he will be dead?


Piz. As surely as the sun shall rise.


El. Pizarro -- spare him.


Piz. Again Elvira?


El. Yes, and a thousand times again. Let me be the instrument of his
salvation, and a thousand times will you bless me for sparing you the curses of
a world. Think, Pizarro, think of the fame you have gained. All Europe,
resounds with thy deeds. "He landed," they cry, "with a handful of men in a
strange land: after having conquered dangers innumerable of unknown seas, he
rendered the arms of Spain victorious over a mighty kingdom. -- He is a hero!"


Piz. And if I crush the only obstacle to my complete success, what will they
say?


El. They will say, "Pizarro trembled before Alonzo de Molina; chance gave him
Alonzo in chains, and he meanly murdered, like a cowardly assassin, the man he
could not conquer."


Piz. Elvira, no more! Leave me.


El. Pizarro, you no longer love me.


Piz. It is not so, Elvira. But what might I not suspect. -- This wondrous
interest for a stranger! -- Take back thy reproach.


El. No, Pizarro; as yet I am not lost to you -- one string still remains, and
binds me to your fate. Do not, I conjure you -- do not for thine own sake, tear
it asunder -- shed not Alonzo's blood!


Piz. My resolution is fixed.


El. Even though that moment lost you Elvira forever?


Piz. Even so.


El. Pizarro, remember the sacrifices I have made for thy sake. Have I not
shared all thy perils, heavy storms at sea, and frightful escapes on shore?
Even on this dreadful day, amid the rout of battle, who remained firm and
constant at Pizarro's side? Who presented her bosom, as his shield, to the
assailing foe?


Piz. It Is truly spoken all. In love thou art thy sex's miracle -- in war the
soldier's pattern -- and, therefore, my whole heart, and half my acquisitions
are thy right.


El. Convince me I possess the first -- I exchange all title to the latter, for
-- mercy to Alonzo.


Piz. No more! -- Had I intended to prolong his doom, each word thou utterest
now would hasten on his fate.


El. Alonzo then at morn will die?


Piz. Think thou yon sun will set? As surely at his rising shall Alonzo die.


El. Then be it done -- the string is cracked -- sundered forever. But mark me
-- thou have heretofore had cause, it is true, to doubt my resolution, however
offended -- but mark me now -- the lips which, cold and jeering, barbing
revenge with rancorous mockery, can insult a fallen enemy, shall never more
receive the pledge of love; the arm unshaken by its bloody purpose, which shall
assign to needless torture the victim who avows his heart; never more shall
press the hand of faith! -- Pizarro, scorn not my words -- beware you slight
them not! -- I feel how noble are the motives which now animate my thoughts --
who could not feel as I do, I condemn -- who, feeling so, yet would not act as
I shall, I despise!


Piz. (After a pause, looking at her with an affected smile of contempt.) I
have heard thee, Elvira, and I know well the noble motives which inspire thee
-- fit advocate in virtue's cause! -- Believe me, I pity thy tender feelings
for the youth Alonzo! -- He dies at sunrise! Exit.


El. It Is well! it is just I should be humbled -- I had forgot myself, and in
the cause of innocence assumed the tone of virtue. 'Twas fit I should be
rebuked -- and by Pizarro. Fall, fall, ye few reluctant drops of weakness --
the last these eyes shall ever shed. How a woman can love, Pizarro, thou have
known too well -- how she can hate, thou have yet to learn. Yes, thou
undaunted! Thou, whom yet no mortal hazard has appalled! Thou, who on Panama's
brow did make alliance with the raging elements, that tore the silence of
that horrid night -- when thou did follow, as thy pioneer, the crashing
thunder's drift, and stalking over the trembling earth, did plant thy banner
by the red volcano's mouth! Thou, who, when battling on the sea, and thy brave
ship was blown to splinters, wast seen -- as thou did bestride a fragment of
the smoking wreck -- to wave thy glittering sword above thy head -- as thou
would defy the world in that extremity! -- Come fearless man -- now meet the
last and fellest peril of thy life -- meet! and survive -- an injured woman's
fury, if thou can. Exit.


END OF THIRD ACT.
ACT FOURTH.
SCENE FIRST.
A Dungeon, in a cavern of the Rock, near the Spanish Camp. ALONZO, in chains.
Alon. For the last time, through the cleft dungeon's roof, I now behold the
quivering luster of the stars. Despise death. So spoke the enlightened among
the Greeks and Romans -- heathens confident in wisdom. And shall a christian
tremble? -- The vigorous youth struggles against a premature death -- a death
in the morning of life. No, Alonzo, date not thy life, which thou have run, by
the mean reckoning of the hours and days which thou have breathed: a life spent
worthily, should be measured by a nobler line -- by deeds of usefulness and
hours of bliss. -- Deeds which have made a nation happy, and hours enriched by
Cora's love -- Cora! -- Ah, there I draw upon the cord that binds me to the
world! -- My wife! my child! -- Here the tears of love hold me, and there the
smiles of innocence. Yes, Cassius, thou wast not a husband! Seneca, thou wast
not a father! Loud cries the voice of nature, "Live" -- and my heart re-echoes
the tone. -- Yes! -- Lord of my destiny! I wish to live!


Enter SOLDIER, with refreshments. Sol. Don Alonzo de Molina, here are
refreshments for you.


Alon. Who sends you?


Sol. I am here on guard.


Alon. Am I to thank you for this kindness?


Sol. No. Your fate makes my heart ach when I remember your former goodness to
the soldiery -- but I cannot help you. I am poor. Donna Elvira sends this
refreshment.


Alon. Return it with my thanks.


Sol. Will you not taste the wine?


Alon. I only drink water.


Sol. But in your situation -- it will give you courage to meet your fate.


Alon. My friend, I pity the wretch who has no other source from whence to draw
courage. Take the wine -- the night is cold -- it may do thee good.


Sol. You are a noble gentleman Don Alonzo. I could lament your fate, but that
it is a sin to pity a heathen. Exit.


Alon. Poor fellow -- he knows not what he says! Father of the afflicted! thy
refreshing streams quicken the flowers at the foot of the Pyrennees as well as
at the base of the Cordilleras. Thou have placed the cross upon our altars as
the token of mercy, but thou smilest on the sun, which adorns the bosom of the
Incas.


Enter ELVIRA. El. Don Alonzo.


Alon. Donna Elvira! Such a visit -- at this hour?


El. When we hasten to relieve the oppressed we count not the hours.


Alon. It is the last of my life.


El. I say to thee, "No."


Alon. Pizarro has sworn my death.


El. And I, thy life.


Alon. I thank thee, but I know to die.


El. Do thou suffer willingly?


Alon. If I answered in the affirmative, I should deceive both myself and thee.


El. Thou art married. Would thou make thy wife a widow?


Alon. My destiny is in the hand of my God.


El. Such are the words of those who dare not govern their own fortunes. Have
thou children?


Alon. One pledge of the purest love.


El. Would thou make thy child an orphan?


Alon. O, my Fernando!


El. Alonzo, thou art a true hero, thou art the benefactor of thy fellow-men.
Thou have been the guardian angel of Peru and have added the blessings of
science to the blessings which nature and innocence had already bestowed on
that region: and wilt, thou now without a struggle quit thy post, when one
manly exertion could save an unoffending people from destruction?


Alon. What meanest thou?


El. The destroyer of Peru will tomorrow be the murderer of Alonzo. Take this
dagger and follow me. Pizarro now sleeps in his tent. His death will spread
confusion through the camp, aided by which we may escape to the Peruvians.
There shall I feel the joyful tears of thy wife upon my cheek, and hear thy
child lisp the name of his father. Alonzo, follow me.


Alon. Murder a sleeping man?


El. Thy bitterest enemy.


Alon. Over my bitterest enemy would I cast my shield, to protect him from harm
while he slept.


El. Not thy foe alone, but the foe of mankind. Determine.


Alon. I am resolved.


El. Then follow me.


Alon. To the rack sooner than to dishonor. -- There was a time when this
Pizarro loved me: when each danger of the field, and each pleasure of the board
were shared with Alonzo. A hundred times have I slept by his side -- and shall
I, sleeping, kill him?


El. He has torn asunder every band which united you.


Alon. Except the remembrance of past kindness.


El. Enthusiast! I abandon thee. Yet bethink thee -- the morning's gray already
appears in the east -- its red is the signal of death. I will leave thee for a
few minutes and return, if Pizarro wakes not, to learn thy last resolve. Exit.


Alon. Alonzo's resolves are ever the same, unchangeable as the nature of
virtue. God be with my wife! -- God and Rolla! (Retires into the cave.)


Roll. (Without.) I must speak with him.


Enter SOLDIER, and ROLLA as a Monk. Sol. You must not, father.


Roll. He is my friend.


Sol. Not if he were your brother.


Roll. What is to be his fate?


Sol. He dies at sunrise.


Roll. Ha! -- Then I am come in time.


Sol. Just -- to witness his death.


Roll. Soldier -- I must speak with him.


Sol. Back -- back. It is impossible! --


Roll. I do entreat you, but for one moment!


Sol. You entreat in vain -- my orders are most strict.


Roll. Look on this wedge of massive gold -- look on these precious gems. In thy
own land, they will be wealth for thee and thine, beyond thy hope or wish. Take
them -- they are thine -- let me pass one minute with Alonzo.


Sol. Away! -- would thou corrupt me? -- Me! -- an old Castilian! -- I know
my duty better.


Roll. Soldier! -- have thou a wife?


Sol. I have.


Roll. Have thou children?


Sol. Four -- honest, lively boys.


Roll. Where did thou leave them?


Sol. In my native village -- even in the cot where myself was born.


Roll. Do thou love thy children and thy wife?


Sol. Do I love them? God knows my heart -- I do.


Roll. Soldier! imagine thou were doomed to die a cruel death in this strange
land: what would be thy last request?


Sol. That some of my comrades should carry my dying blessing to my wife and
children.


Roll. Oh! but if that comrade was at thy prison gate -- and should there be
told -- thy fellow-soldier dies at sunrise -- yet thou shall not for a moment
see him -- nor shall thou bear his dying blessing to his poor children, or his
wretched wife. What would thou think of him, who thus could drive thy comrade
from thy door?


Sol. How!


Roll. Alonzo has a wife and a child -- I am come but to receive for her, and
for her babe, the last blessing of my friend.


Sol. Go in -- (Retires.)


Roll. Oh! holy nature! thou do never plead in vain. There is not, of our
earth, a creature bearing form, and life, human or savage -- native of the
forest wild, or giddy air -- around whose parent bosom, thou have not a cord
entwined of power to tie them to their offspring's claims, and at thy will to
draw them back to thee. On iron pinion's borne -- the blood-stained vulture
cleaves the storm. Yet, is the plumage closest to her heart, soft as the
cygnet's down, and over her unshelled brood, the murmuring ring-dove sits not
more gentle! -- Yes! -- now he is beyond the porch, barring the outer gate! --
Alonzo! -- Alonzo! -- my friend! Ha! -- in gentle sleep! -- Alonzo -- rise! --


Alon. How! -- Is my hour elapsed? -- Well, (Returning from the recess.) I am
ready.


Roll. Alonzo -- know me.


Alon. What voice is that?


Roll. It Is Rolla's.


Alon. Rolla! -- my friend! -- (Embraces him.) Heavens! how could thou pass
the guard? Did this habit --


Roll. There is not a moment to be lost in words: -- this disguise I tore from
the dead body of a friar, as I passed our field of battle -- it has gained me
entrance to thy dungeon; now take it thou, and fly.


Alon. And Rolla --


Roll. Will remain here in thy place.


Alon. And die for me! -- No! -- Rather eternal tortures rack me.


Roll. I shall not die, Alonzo. It is thy life Pizarro seeks, not Rolla's -- and
from my prison soon will thy arm deliver me; -- or, should it be otherwise -- I
am as a blighted plantain standing alone amid the sandy desert. Nothing seeks
or lives beneath my shelter. Thou art a husband and a father -- the being of a
lovely wife and helpless infant hang upon thy life.


Alon. Would thou make me the cowardly murderer of my friend? Would thou
give me a life embittered by torments inexpressible?


Roll. No -- I give you to joy and Cora. You shall shed a tear at the
remembrance of Rolla, but it will be as one drop of bitterness in the cup of
your overflowing bliss.


Alon. Can a friend thus torture me?


Roll. I could not bring thee a word of greeting from Cora. She knew no one
around her. Thy return alone can preserve her life.


Alon. O, God! -- Cora! --


Roll. If thou art yet irresolute, Alonzo -- now heed me well -- I think thou
have not known that Rolla ever pledged his word, and shrunk from its
fulfillment. And, by the heart of truth I swear, if thou art proudly obstinate
to deny thy friend the transport of preserving Cora's life, in thee -- no power
that sways the will of man shall stir me hence; -- and thou will but have the
desperate triumph, of seeing Rolla perish by thy side -- with the assured
conviction, that Cora, and thy child, are lost forever.


Alon. Oh! Rolla! -- You distract me!


Roll. A moment's further pause, and all is lost -- the dawn approaches -- fear
not for me -- I will treat with Pizarro, as for surrender and submission; -- I
shall gain time, doubt not -- while thou, with a chosen band, passing the
secret way, may at night return -- release thy friend, and bear him back in
triumph. Yes -- hasten -- dear Alonzo! -- Even now I hear the frantic Cora call
thee! -- Haste! haste! haste!


Alon. Rolla, I fear your friendship drives me from honor, and from right.


Roll. Did Rolla ever counsel dishonor to his feiend?


Alon. Oh! my preserver! (Embracing him.)


Roll. I feel thy warm tears dropping on my cheek. Go! -- I am rewarded. (Throws
the friar's garment over Alonzo.) There! conceal thy face; and that they may
not clank, hold fast thy chains. Now -- God be with thee!


Alon. At night we meet again. Then -- so aid me heaven! I return to save -- or
-- perish with thee. Exit.


Roll. (Alone.) He has passed the outer porch. He is safe! He will soon embrace
his wife and child! Now, Cora, did thou not wrong me? This is the first time
throughout my life I ever deceived man -- Forgive me, God of truth! if I am
wrong. -- Alonzo flatters himself that we shall meet again -- Yes -- there!
(Lifting his hands to Heaven.) -- assuredly we shall meet again: there possess
in peace, the joys of everlasting love, and friendship -- on earth, imperfect
and embittered.


Enter ELVIRA. El. Now, Alonzo -- ha! -- Who art thou? -- Where is Alonzo?


Roll. Alonzo's fled.


El. Fled!


Roll. Yes -- and he must not be pursued. Pardon this roughness, (Seizing her
hand.) -- but a moment's precious to Alonzo's flight.


El. What if I call the guard?


Roll. Do so -- Alonzo still gains time.


El. What if thus I free myself? (Shows a dagger.)


Roll. Strike it to my heart. Still, with the convulsive grasp of death, I Will
hold thee fast.


El. Release me. I give my faith, I neither will alarm the guard, nor cause
pursuit.


Roll. At once, I trust thy word. -- A feeling boldness in those eyes assures me
that thy soul is noble.


El. What is thy name? Speak freely. By my order the guard is removed beyond
the outer porch.


Roll. My name is Rolla.


El. The Peruvian leader?


Roll. I was so yesterday -- today, the Spaniard's captive.


El. And friendship for Alonzo moved to this act?


Roll. Alonzo is my friend. -- I am prepared to die for him. Yet is the cause a
motive stronger far than friendship.


El. One only passion else could urge such generous rashness.


Roll. And that is --


El. Love.


Roll. True!


El. Gallant! ingenuous Rolla! -- Know that my purpose here was thine; and were
I to save thy friend --


Roll. How! a woman blessed with gentleness and courage, and yet not Cora!


El. Does Rolla think so meanly of all female hearts?


Roll. Not so -- you are better and worse than we are.


El. To save thee, Rolla, from the tyrant's vengeance -- restore thee to thy
native land -- and thy native land to peace -- would thou not rank Elvira
with the good?


Roll. To judge the action I must know the means.


El. Take this dagger.


Roll. How to be used?


El. I will conduct thee to the tent where fell Pizarro sleeps -- the scourge
of innocence -- the terror of thy race -- the fiend that desolates thy
afflicted country.


Roll. Have you not been injured by Pizarro?


El. Deeply as scorn and insult can infuse their deadly venom.


Roll. And you ask that I should murder him in his sleep?


El. Would he not have murdered Alonzo in his chains? He that sleeps and he
that is bound are equally defenseless. Hear me, Rolla -- So may I prosper in
this perilous act, as, searching my full heart, I have put by all rancorous
motive of private vengeance there, and feel that I advance to my dread purpose
in the cause of human nature, and at the call of sacred justice.


Roll. The God of justice sanctifies no evil as a step toward good. Great
actions cannot be achieved by wicked means.


El. Then, Peruvian! Since thou do feel so coldly for thy country's wrongs,
this hand, though it revolt my soul, shall strike the blow.


Roll. Then is thy destruction certain, and for Peru, thou a stranger,
perishest! -- Give me the dagger!


El. Now follow me; -- but first -- and dreadful is the hard necessity -- you
must strike down the guard.


Roll. The soldier who was on duty here?


El. Yes, him -- else, seeing thee, the alarm will be instant.


Roll. And I must stab that soldier as I pass? Take back thy dagger.


El. Rolla!


Roll. That soldier, mark me, is a man. All are not men that bear the human
form. He refused my prayers -- refused my gold -- denying to admit me -- till
his own feelings bribed him. For my nation's safety, I would not harm that man!


El. Then he must be with us -- I will answer for his safety.


Roll. Be that plainly understood between us; -- for whatever betide our
enterprise, I will not risk a hair of that man's head -- he is my brother.


Exeunt. SCENE SECOND.
Pizarro's Tent. PIZARRO on a couch, in disturbed sleep. Piz. (In his sleep.)
No mercy, traitor. -- Now at his heart! -- Stand off there, you. -- Let me see
him bleed! -- Ha! ha! ha! -- Let me hear that groan again.


Enter ROLLA and ELVIRA. El. There! -- Now, lose not a moment.


Roll. You must leave me now. This scene of blood fits not a woman's presence.


El. But a moment's pause may --


Roll. Go! -- Retire to your own tent -- and return not here -- I will come to
you. -- Be you not known in this business, I implore you!


El. I will withdraw the guard that waits.


Exit Elvira. Roll. Now have I in my power, the accursed destroyer of my
country's peace; yet tranquilly he rests. God! -- Can this man sleep?


Piz. (In his sleep.) Away! away! -- Hideous fiends! -- Tear not my bosom thus!


Roll. No: -- I was in error -- the balm of sweet repose he never more can know.
Look here, ambitious fools! -- Ye, by whose inhuman pride, the bleeding
sacrifice of nations is held as nothing -- behold the repose of the guilty! He
is at my mercy -- and one blow! -- No! -- my heart and hand refuse to act;
Rolla cannot be an assassin! -- Yet Elvira must be saved! (Approaches the
couch.) Pizarro! awake!


Piz. (Starts up.) Who? -- Guards! --


Roll. Speak not -- another word is thy death. -- Call not for aid! -- this arm
will be swifter than thy guards.


Piz. Who art thou? and what is thy will?


Roll. I am thine enemy! Peruvian Rolla! Thy death is not my will, or I could
have slain thee sleeping.


Piz. Speak, what else?


Roll. Now thou art at my mercy -- answer me! Did a Peruvian ever yet wrong or
injure thee, or any of thy nation? Did thou, or any of thy nation, ever yet
show mercy to a Peruvian in your power? Now shall thou feel -- and, if thou
have a heart, thou wilt feel it keenly! -- a Peruvian's vengeance! (Drops the
dagger at his feet.) There!


Piz. Is it possible? (Walks aside, confounded.)


Roll. Can Pizarro wonder at this? I thought forgiveness of injuries had been
the Christian's precept. Thou see, at least, it is the Peruvian's practice.


Piz. Rolla, thou have, indeed, surprised, subdued me. (Walks again aside, as
in irresolute thought.)


Re-enter ELVIRA, not seeing PIZARRO. El. Is it done? Is he dead? (Sees
Pizarro.) (...) -- still living! Then I am lost! and for you, wretched
Peruvians! mercy is no more! Oh! Rolla! treacherous, or cowardly?


Piz. How! Can it be, that --


Roll. Away! Elvira speaks, she knows not what! Leave me, (To Elvira.) I conjure
you, with Pizarro.


El. How! -- Rolla, do thou think I shall retract -- or that I meanly will
deny, that in thy hand I placed a poinard to be plunged into that tyrant's
heart? -- No! -- My sole regret is, that I trusted to thy weakness, and did not
strike the blow myself. Too soon thou will learn that mercy to that man, is
direst cruelty to all thy race!


Piz. Guard! quick! a guard!


El. Yes, a guard! I call them too! And soon I know they (...) me to my death.
But think not, Pizarro, the fury of thy flashing eyes shall awe me for a
moment! -- Nor think that woman's anger, or the feelings of an injured heart
prompted me to this design. No! Had I been only influenced so -- thus failing,
shame and remorse would weigh me down. But though defeated and destroyed, as
now I am, such is the greatness of the cause that urged me, I shall perish,
glorying in the attempt, and my last breath of life shall speak the proud
avowal of my purpose -- to have rescued millions of innocents from the
blood-thirsty tyranny of one -- by ridding the insulted world of thee.


Roll. Had the act been noble as the motive -- Rolla had not shrunk from its
performance.


Enter GUARDS. Piz. Seize this discovered fiend who sought to kill your leader.


El. Touch me not, at the peril of your souls; -- I am your prisoner, and will
follow you. But thou, their triumphant leader, shall hear me. Yet, first -- for
thee, Rolla, accept my forgiveness: even had I been the victim of thy nobleness
of heart, I should have admired thee for it. But 'twas myself provoked my doom
-- thou would have shielded me. Let not thy contempt follow me to the grave.
Did thou but know the spell-like arts, by which this hypocrite first
undermined the virtue of a guiltless heart! how, even in the pious sanctuary
wherein I dwelt, by corruption and fraud, he practiced upon those in whom I
most confided -- till my distempered fancy led me, step by step, into the abyss
of guilt --


Piz. Why am I not obeyed? -- Tear her hence!


El. It Is past -- but did thou know my story, Rolla, thou would pity me.


Roll. From my soul I do pity thee!


Piz. Villains! drag her to the dungeon! -- prepare the torture instantly!


El. Soldiers -- but a moment more -- it is to applaud your general -- it is to
tell the astonished world, that, for once, Pizarro's sentence is an act of
justice: yes, rack me with the sharpest tortures that ever agonized the human
frame; and when thou shall bid them tear me to death, hoping that thy
unshrinking ears may at last be feasted with the music of my cries, I will not
utter one shriek or groan -- but to the last gasp, my body's patience shall
deride thy vengeance, as my soul defies thy power.


Piz. (Endeavoring to conceal his agitation.) Hear thou the wretch whose
hands were even now prepared for murder?


Roll. Yes! And if her accusation's false, thou will not shrink from hearing
her; if true, thy barbarity cannot make her suffer the pangs thy conscience
will inflict on thee.


El. And now, farewell, world! -- Rolla, farewell! -- Farewell, thou condemned of
heaven! -- (To Pizarro.) -- for repentance and remorse, I know, will never
touch thy heart -- we shall meet again. -- Ha! be it thy horror here, to know
that we shall meet hereafter! -- And when thy parting hour approaches -- hark
to the knell, whose dreadful beat will strike to thy despairing soul. Then,
will vibrate on thy ear, the curses of the cloistered saint from whom you stole
me. Then, the last shrieks which burst from my mother's breaking heart, as she
died, appealing to her God against the seducer of her child! Then, the
blood-stifled groan of my murdered brother -- murdered by thee, fell monster!
-- seeking atonement for his sister's ruined honor -- I hear them now! To me,
the recollection's madness! At such an hour -- What will it be to thee?


Piz. A moment's more delay, and at the peril of your lives --


El. I have spoken -- and the last mortal frailty of my life is past. And now,
with an undaunted spirit, and unshaken firmness, I go to meet my destiny. That
I could not live nobly, has been Pizarro's act. That I will die nobly, shall be
my own. Exit, guarded.


Roll. Pizarro -- I pity thee the tortures of this hour.


Piz. No more -- Explain to me by what miracle thou art here, and here as the
protector of Pizarro?


Roll. I came to save my friend Alonzo.


Piz. Then thou came in vain.


Roll. No! Alonzo is in safety.


Piz. Who?


Roll. Thy prisoner.


Piz. Fled!


Roll. Yes. I have deceived his guard. My friend is safe. I am thy prisoner.


Piz. Young man, you force from me my admiration -- my esteem. -- Thou art at
liberty.


Roll. Thou do in this, thy duty.


Piz. Go, and if we meet again in battle --


Roll. We will fight like men.


Piz. I will turn aside and spare thee.


Roll. Not so. For thou shall be the first whom I will seek in the field of
battle. Meanwhile farewell. (Going -- returns.) Pizarro, the soldier who guarded
Alonzo, has done his duty -- forgive him.


Piz. Thou requirest too much.


Roll. Grant my request, or I remain. I save or suffer with him.


Piz. What, for a private soldier?


Roll. He is a man: a man of whose misfortune I am the cause.


Piz. Depart in peace. I forgive him. Rolla, I would we were friends.


Roll. Be virtue's friend, and thou art Rolla's.


Exit. Piz. Ambition! tell me what is the phantom I have followed? Where is the
one delight which it has made my own? My fame is the mark of envy -- my love
the dupe of treachery -- my glory eclipsed by the boy I taught -- my revenge
defeated and rebuked by the rude honor of a savage foe. And I have suffered him
to escape! -- The strength of the enemy was in my power. -- Ha! -- By Heavens!
he is still in my power. -- What, guards! (Going.) Hold, Pizarro, thou have
pledged thy faith. Damnation! -- But he is a heathen, and with these our
priests -- Away, away! damned sophistry! -- The faith of heroes ever was the
same.


Exit. END OF FOURTH ACT.
ACT FIFTH.
SCENE FIRST.
A thick Forest. In the back ground, a Hut almost covered by boughs of trees. A
dreadful storm, with thunder and lightning. CORA has covered her Child on a bed
of leaves and moss. Her whole appearance is wild and distracted. Co. O, nature!
thou have not the strength of love. My anxious spirit is untired in its march.
My wearied shivering frame sinks under it. -- And for thee, my boy -- when
faint beneath thy lovely burden, could I refuse to give thy slumbers that poor
bed of rest? O, my child! were I assured thy father breathes no more, how
quickly would I lay me down by thy dear side; but down, down forever. (Thunder
and lightning.) -- I ask thee not, unpitying storm! to abate thy rage, in mercy
to poor Cora's misery; nor, while thy thunders spare his slumbers, will I
disturb my sleeping cherub. Though, heaven knows, I wish to hear the voice of
life, and feel that life is near me. But I will endure all, while what I have
of reason holds. (Thunder and lightning.) -- Still, still implacable, unfeeling
elements! -- Yet still do thou sleep, my smiling innocent! -- O, death! when
will thou grant to this babe's mother such repose? Sure I may shield thee
better from the storm. My veil may --


While she is wrapping her mantle and her veil over him, ALONZO'S voice is
heard at a great distance. Alon. Cora!


Co. Ha!!! (Rises.)


Alon. (Again.) Cora!


Co. O, my heart! Sweet heaven, deceive me not! Is it not Alonzo's voice?


Alon. (Nearer.) Cora!


Co. It is -- it is Alonzo!


Alon. (Still nearer.) Cora! my beloved!


Co. Alonzo! -- Here! here! Alonzo! (Runs out.)


The voices of Alonzo and Cora are heard as if they approached, until an
exclamation of ecstacy expresses their meeting. Enter two SPANISH SOLDIERS. 1
st. Sol. I tell you we are near our out-posts, and the word we heard just now
was the countersign.


2 d. Sol. It is no such thing, comrade, we have lost our way.


1 st. Sol. Trust to me. I will lead you safe. When you see the sun on your
left hand, then --


2 d. Sol. When we shall see the sun again, Heaven knows!


1 st. Sol. I say the sun is on our left hand, and the camp -- (Sees the
Child.) What have we here? (Lifts the veil.)


2 d. Sol. A child, as I Am a soldier! A lovely child! Let us carry it off.


1 st. Sol. And what shall we do with it? -- Let it alone -- it is a heathen
child.


2 d. Sol. It sleeps so sweetly! I left one in Spain just of the same age! --
What say you, comrade, it is abandoned here to perish -- I will take it and
preserve it. (Takes it in his arms.)


1 st. Sol. As you like. But make haste, or we shall not regain the camp --
come this way! Exit.


2 d. Sol. Poor rogue! How sound it sleeps!


Exit, gazing on the Child. Re-enter CORA with ALONZO. Co. (Speaking without.)
This way, dear Alonzo. Now I am right -- there -- there -- under that tree. Was
it possible the instinct of a mother's heart could mistake the spot! Now will
you look at him as he sleeps; or shall I bring him waking, with his full blue
laughing eyes to welcome you at once? -- Yes -- yes -- stand thou there -- I Will
snatch him from his rosy slumber, blushing like the perfumed morn.


She runs to the spot, and finding only the mantle and veil, which she tears
from the ground, and the child gone, shrieks and stands in speechless agony.
Alon. (Running to her.) My heart's beloved!


Co. He is gone!


Alon. Eternal God!


Co. He is gone! -- My child! -- My child!


Alon. Where did you leave him?


Co. (Dashing herself on the spot.) Here!


Alon. Be calm, beloved Cora -- he has waked, and crept to a little distance --
we shall find him.


Co. Fernando! Fernando!


Alon. Is this certainly the spot where you left him?


Co. Is not this the veil that covered him?


Alon. Think not the worst.


Co. I think not. I see the blood of my child!


Alon. Cora, dear Cora! Come to my ar^^.


Co. Give me my child or death. (Looking upward.)


Alon. Here is a hut among the trees.


Co. Ha! yes, yes! there lives the savage that has robbed me of my child --
(Beats at the door, exclaiming) Give me back my child -- restore to me my boy!


Enter LAS CASAS, from the hut. L. C. Who calls me from my wretched solitude?


Co. Give me back my child! (Goes into the hut and calls) Fernando!


Alon. Almighty powers! do my eyes deceive me! Las Casas!!!


L. C. Alonzo -- my beloved young friend!


Alon. My revered instructor. (Embracing.)


Co. (Returned.) Will you embrace this man before he restores my boy?


Alon. Alas, my friend -- in what a moment of misery do we meet!


Co. Yet his look is goodness and humanity. -- Good old man, have compassion on
a wretched mother -- and I will be your servant while I live. -- But do not,
for pity's sake -- do not say you have him not -- do not say you have not seen
him.


(Runs into the wood.) L. C. What can this mean?


Alon. She is my wife. Just rescued from the Spaniard's prison, I learned she
had fled to this wild forest. -- Hearing my voice, she left the child, and flew
to meet me -- he was left sleeping under yonder tree.


L. C. How! -- did you leave him?


(Cora returns.) Co. O, you are right! -- right! -- Unnatural mother, that I
was -- I left my child -- I forsook my innocent -- but I will fly to the
earth's brink, but I will find him. (Runs out.)


Alon. Forgive me, Las Casas, I must follow her: for at night I attempt brave
Rolla's escape.


L. C. I will not leave you, Alonzo. -- You must try to lead her to the right
-- that way lies your camp -- wait not my infirm steps -- I follow you, my
friend.


Exeunt. SCENE SECOND.
The out-post of the Spanish camp -- the back ground wild and rocky, with a
torrent falling down the precipice, over which a bridge is formed by a felled
tree. ALMAGRO, without. Al. Bear him along -- his story must be false.


(Entering.) Roll. (In chains, brought in by soldiers.) False! -- Rolla utter
falsehood! -- I would I had thee in a desert, with thy troop around thee; --
and I, but with my sword in this unshackled hand!


Al. Is it to be credited that Rolla, the renowned Peruvian hero -- should be
detected like a spy, skulking through our camp?


Roll. Skulking! Base-minded plunderer, it is only such as thee that know the
arts of skulking and deceit: you cannot judge, cannot conceive, the motives
which animate the minds of nature's children. You, by a strange frenzy driven,
contend for power, for plunder and dominion -- we for our country, our altars,
and our homes. You follow an adventurer whom you fear, and obey a power which
you hate -- we serve a monarch whom we love -- a God whom we adore. Whenever
you move in anger, desolation tracks your progress -- wherever you pause in
amity, affliction mourns your friendship.


Al. Proud savage! -- we come to improve your state, enlarge your thoughts, and
free you from the yoke of error.


Roll. Away, away! -- first free yourselves from passion's deadly rule, and
spurn the dictates of avarice and pride. When we accept a change, it must be by
virtue recommended. The rulers whom we honor, possess the people's confidence
and love -- the laws we reverence, are our brave fathers' legacy -- the faith
we follow, teaches us to live in charity with all, and die with hope of bliss
beyond the grave! -- But why waste words with thee -- bring me to your general.


Al. He is here.


Enter PIZARRO. Piz. What, Rolla!


Roll. To thy surprise, no doubt.


Piz. And bound too!


Roll. So fast that thou have nothing to fear.


Al. The guards surprised him, passing our out-post.


Piz. Rolla, thou hear that I am guiltless of this insult. -- Release him.
(It is done.) Nor shall a hero like Rolla depart from me unarmed. (Gives him a
sword.) Learn that Spaniards know the courtesy which is due to a valiant enemy.


Roll. (Taking the sword.) And learn that Peruvians can forgive injuries. I
forgive thee.


Piz. Only forgive? -- I had hoped that Pizarro and Rolla might one day be
friends.


Roll. I will talk to thee of friendship -- as soon as the sea lies between us.
May I depart?


Piz. Freely.


Roll. And shall I not again be intercepted?


Piz. No! Let the word be given that Rolla passes freely.


Enter DAVILLA and SOLDIERS, with the CHILD. Dav. Here are two soldiers, who
have found a Peruvian child.


Piz. What is the imp to me? -- Bid them toss it into the sea.


Roll. Gracious heaven! it is Alonzo's child! -- give it to me.


Piz. Ha! -- Alonzo's child! -- Welcome, thou pretty hostage. -- Now Alonzo is
again my prisoner!


Roll. Thou will not keep the infant from its mother?


Piz. Will I not? -- What, when I shall meet Alonzo in the heat of the
victorious fight -- think thou I shall not have a check upon the valor of
his heart, when he is reminded that a word of mine is this child's death?


Roll. I do not understand you.


Piz. My vengeance has a long arrear of hate to settle with Alonzo -- and this
pledge may help to balance the account.


Roll. Man! man! -- Art thou a man? Could thou hurt that innocent? -- By
heaven! it is smiling in thy face.


Piz. Tell me, does it resemble Cora?


Roll. Pizarro! thou have set my heart on fire. If thou do harm that child --
think not his blood will sink into the barren sand -- no! -- faithful to the
eager hope that now trembles in this indignant heart -- 'twill rise to the
common God of nature and humanity, and cry aloud for vengeance on its accursed
destroyer's head.


Piz. Be that peril mine.


Roll. (Throwing himself at his feet.) Behold me at thy feet. -- Me, Rolla! --
Me, the preserver of thy life! -- Me, that have never yet bent or bowed before
created man, my king excepted. In humble agony I sue to you -- prostrate I
implore you -- but spare that child, and I will be your slave.


Piz. Rolla! -- Still thou art free to go -- this child remains with me.


Roll. Then was this sword heaven's gift, not thine. (Seizes the child.) Who
moves one step to follow me, dies upon the spot.


Exit, with the Child. Piz. Pursue him instantly -- but spare his life.


Exeunt Almagro and Soldiers. Piz. With what fury he defends himself! -- Ha! --
he fells them to the ground -- and now --


Enter ALMAGRO. Al. Three of your brave soldiers are already victims to your
command to spare this madman's life; and if he once gains the thicket --


Piz. Spare him no longer. (Exit Almagro.) Their guns must reach him -- he will
yet escape -- holloa! those horse! -- the Peruvian sets them -- and now he
turns among the rocks -- then is his retreat cut off.


ROLLA crosses the tree over the cataract, pursued by the Soldiers; they fire
at him; a shot strikes him. Piz* (Exclaims.) Now! quick! quick! Seize the
child! --


ROLLA tears from the rock the tree which supports the bridge, and retreats by
the back ground, bearing off the Child. Re-enter ALMAGRO and DAVILLA. Al. By
hell! he has escaped! -- and with the child unhurt.


Dav. No -- he bears his death with him. Believe me, I saw him struck upon the
side.


Piz. Dead! -- Shot! -- Brave man! Thou wast worthy of a nobler death! -- I
would have won thy friendship. -- Yes, by heaven! I reverenced and admired him
-- yet -- I am his murderer! -- Away! -- Give me a thousand men like this, and
I would conquer worlds!


Exeunt. SCENE THIRD.
Ataliba's Tent. Enter ATALIBA, followed by ALONZO, CORA, and LAS CASAS. Co.
Oh! avoid me not, Ataliba! To whom, but to her king, is the wretched mother to
address her griefs? The gods refuse to hear my prayers! Did not my Alonzo fight
for you? and will not my sweet boy, if thou will but restore him to me, one day
fight thy battles too?


Alon. Oh! my suffering love! my poor heart-broken Cora! you but wound our
sovereign's feeling soul, and not relieve thy own.


Co. Is he our sovereign, and has he not the power to give me back my child?


Ata. When I reward desert, or can relieve my people, I feel what is the real
glory of a king. When I hear them suffer, and cannot aid them, I mourn the
impotence of all mortal powers.


Voice behind. Rolla! Rolla! Rolla!


Enter ROLLA, mortally wounded; in his right hand the bloody sword, on his left
arm the child. Ata. Gracious God!


Roll. (Sinks on one knee before Cora, and with a weak voice exclaims) Cora --
thy child!


Co. My child -- covered with blood!


Roll. It is my blood. (Presenting her the child.)


Co. (Pressing it to her breast.) My child! Rolla!


Roll. I loved thee! Thou did me injustice! I can no more -- (Sinks down.)


Alon. (Casting himself on his knee by him.) Rolla! thou die! --


Roll. For thee -- and Cora! -- (Dies.)


Co. (Kneeling by the body.) O! who ever loved like this man? (To the Child.)
Boy, thou art dearly purchased!


Alon. (Starting up with an action of despair.) Las Casas! help me to believe
in God!


L. C. His ways are dark. Have faith, pray, and be humble.


THE END.
NOTES TO PIZARRO IN PERU.
THIS play is called in the original " The Spaniards in Peru; or, Rolla's
Death. A Romantic Tragedy; in Five Acts." -- The copy here presented to the
public is partly translated for the New York Theater, and partly adapted from
Mr. Sheridan's tragedy of Pizarro.

Page 9. Elvira is discovered.] In the original Elvira is attired as a man. The
alteration is Mr. Sheridan's.

Same page. Power of your charms.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"El. Why do you disturb my delightful dreams?


Val. What were you dreaming?


El. That I saw you hanged.


Val. How long will Elvira mock my love?


El. Your love? Who gave the bastard this honest name? Between ourselves,
Valverde, when I hear you speak of love, you appear to me like a pick-pocket;
who, while he bears the blessing of God in his mouth, is devising the best
means of purloining your purse.


Val. What may not a handsome woman say?


El. What may not a vain coxcomb do?"


Page 10. In thee I see not man.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"El. Valor captivates maiden hearts more than erudition. Pizarro fights with
the sword, and you with the pen. He sheds blood, and you only ink.


Val. And both to very little purpose.


El. But with all your scribbling Nugnez Balboa had never discovered the South
sea; with all the axioms of your Aristotle, Pizarro and Almagro would never
have fitted out a ship. You might have remained buried in your scholastic dust;
and I, perhaps, been still a nun.


Val. Have we gained or lost, is the question?


El. The uniformity of the cloister; the sleep of a dormouse.


Val. True woman. Splendid misery is dearer to you than obscure happiness.


El. Do you know what we most hate? An unbidden prater, a vulgar-themed
preacher."


Same page. Might have been my lot.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"Val. A holy enthusiast for what is called humanity. Nothing excites
enthusiasm so quickly as words which no one understands. The imagination
conceives, and brings forth a martyr.


El. Valverde a philosopher too?


Val. Does it displease thee? Well, then, let us step from the clouds of
philosophy to the flowering plains of love.


El. They will become barren under thy footsteps. In short, my crafty friend,
you must throw away the pen, seize the sword, and do something great before you
pretend to the love of Elvira."


Page 11. A hero!] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"Val. Great while he succeeds; but should his projects fail, the world will
call him fool.


El. The fate of every hero. With open mouths children behold the mounting
rocket, and when it falls, laugh.


Val. Suppose it even rose to the sky, what hopes have you from it?


El. To become a viceroy's wife. Pizarro will govern this rude nation; I will
instruct and fashion it.


Val. Indeed! Then you little know Pizarro's subtle thirst for honor. If
fortune lead him to her highest step, he will bestow his hand on one whose high
birth may hide his own mean origin; whose connexions at court may be his
protection. While the poor Elvira is forgotten; forgotten all that she has done
and suffered.


El. Ha! Then -- but hiss on, poisonous serpent!


Val. On the other side -- Valverde may then be high in dignity, and Elvira --
his friend.


El. Shameless wretch!


Val. You trample upon the flower which you might pluck, for the sake of fruit
which hangs too high for you."


Four lines are substituted.

Same page. Shouts of victory.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"El. And as long as this Pizarro deserves my affection, no art shall separate
me from him. When fortune turns her back upon him, Elvira will reach him her
hand.


Val. Slow is repentance, but she ever overtakes the thoughtless."


Page 13. Reek with human blood.] Here the following lines are omitted; --

"El. Surprise? Battle? Do you take me with you, Pizarro?


Piz. We were not speaking of a ball.


El. (With feeling.) Nor did I question a dancer.


Piz. If in my armoury you can find a sword light enough for a woman's hand,
come and stand by my side in the battle.


El. Would you rather have me there than not?


Piz. Yes; and do you know why? The tumult of the fight will be my surety for
your fidelity.


El. You are wrong. The woman who is desirous of being untrue, will not be
hindered by storms or earthquakes.


Piz. I thank you for the lesson, and will write it in my memory.


El. You cannot write.


Piz. (With a ferocious look.) Elvira!


El. Is it my fault?


Piz. You know that I will not hear of this.


El. If your nurse had broken your leg, would you be ashamed of limping?


Piz. Enough. And never again mention the subject.


El. (Aside.) Achilles was only vulnerable in the heel."


Here follows the buffoon scene of the armor-bearer, which, as it has been
generally condemned, and was printed contrary to the author's intention, I omit.

Page 15. Half of what I know.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"L. C. You have vied with each other, who could best murder men, who could
most dexterously split a skull. You have torn children from the arms of their
mothers, and dashed them against the rocks. You have roasted their leaders at
slow fires, and when their shrieks have disturbed the sleep of their
executioners, you have thrust gags in their mouths. On thirteen gibbets have
you hung as many Indians -- God -- dare I speak it! -- to the honor of Christ
and the twelve apostles! My eyes have seen this abomination, and still I exist."


Page 16. The sword of your hero, etc.] The original is, "First, let these
heroes fight, and prepare the way for our instruction."

Page 22. Scene first.] In the original the scene is thus described, and
continues through the act. "The Peruvian camp near a village, of which only a
few houses are visible. In the middle of the stage an altar is erected. In the
back-ground a hill on which stands a tree." -- The changes are Mr. Sheridan's.

Page 23. When first, etc.] In this speech Mr. Sheridan has improved upon the
idea of his original.

Page 34. Enter DAVILLA, etc.] The capture of the king, and the circumstances
attending upon it, are Mr. Sheridan's, who has omitted the incident of a
retreating soldier who returns to the fight upon the king's lending him his
sword, and comes back to recount Rolla's success; and also that of another
soldier, who dies at the king's and gives cause to this exclamation, "Blood of
a subject, costly pledge entrusted to my care, I have not shed thee wantonly."

Page 38. Act third.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

" (Cora stoops hovering over the child.) Still do thou sleep, sweet boy?
Will thou not yet open thy blue eyes, that the mother may rejoice in the blue
eyes of the father? (Rising sorrowfully.) Alas! where are thy father's eyes?
Sparkle they still? Does he still live?"

One of the Women. (Looking toward a hill at a distance.) Xuliqua! do you see
nothing?


A Female voice. (Behind the scenes.) I saw great clouds of dust a short time
since, but they are blown away.


A Woman. The battle must soon be decided.


Another. As I was standing on the hill, I heard the clash of arms.


A Third. We all heard the thundering tubes of the Spaniards.


Second. The gods protect our husbands!


Co. (Aside, raising her hands.) God be with thee, my Alonzo!


The First Woman. Xuliqua! do you see nothing?


Xul. (At a distance.) The sun dazzles me.


First Woman. Our father looks down upon us. The children of the sun will
conquer.


Co. (Looking at her Child.) See! A gnat has stung him. -- (Fans him with a
branch.) -- Oh, Alonzo! thy poor wife is lamenting the sting of an insect,
when, perhaps, an arrow is rankling in thy heart.


First Woman. Xuliqua! do you see nothing?


Xul. (At a distance.) I see a man hastening hither; and another at a greater
distance.


The Women. Thank heaven! Thank heaven! Messengers from our husbands!


Xul. (Appearing.) The first disappeared among the trees, and must soon be here.


Co. (Trembling.) My heart will spring from my bosom.


A Woman. There he is!"


Page 39. I saw him not.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"Women. Away, away to our brothers and husbands!


Per. Stay! they will soon be here.


Women. Here! Are they coming hither?


Per. They are close upon me.


Women. Let us break branches from the trees, and make garlands for the heroes.


All. Garlands! Garlands for the conquerors!


They break off branches. Co. (Mournfully.) No one has seen him! Oh, my son!
have thou still a father?


(A march is heard at a distance.) A Woman. Ha! they come. Look, sisters, how
triumphantly the warriors approach. Raise the children high in the air, that
they may lisp the conquerors' praises.


(As the march draws nearer, the women unite in a shout of triumph.) All. Hail!
Hail to the children of the sun! -- Joy to Rolla, the conqueror! -- Blessings
on Ataliba, our father and our king!"


Page 50. " He is a hero!"] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"Piz. (Smiling.) And then, no doubt, my mouldering bones will rattle with
delight in the grave.


El. Fame is a bubble, and the hero a child; yet does this gew-gaw unite the
demi-god to human nature."


Page 50. No more! Leave me!] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"El. You are right. Who would plant cedars in a marsh? Let us converse
rationally on this subject. Fame is an irrational thing. It is mere smoke, and
does not warm us. But advantage -- What think you, Pizarro? How if by
generosity, which costs us nothing, we could purchase a dear victory?


Piz. Speak more intelligibly.


El. Alonzo must seal the doctrine of Las Casas: -- whether by an heroic death,
which is of little advantage to us, or by a folly, which may aid us much,
depends on you.


Piz. How so?


El. Let us catch the enthusiast with his own phantoms. That nothing, called by
mortals virtue, is his idol. Go to him, and say, "Alonzo, thou have injured me.
I forgive thee. Thou art at liberty." The boy will sink into your arms, and
gratefully betray to you the throne of Quito.


Piz. Think you so? I doubt it.


El. If the artifice be too difficult for you alone, I will assist you. Whom
does the power of love more easily persuade to good or evil than the
enthusiast? I am possessed of beauty, and of sense; and well can I accommodate
myself to all the humors of your sex. You know, Pizarro, thousands obey you,
the hero -- You me, the woman.


Piz. I obey you!


El. Not another word, for time is precious. I go to Alonzo. Have I not already
won his heart as a young man? How then will he feel when I appear before him as
a woman, when I press his hand in mine, and rest my supplicating looks upon
him; when virtue's airy precepts flow from my lips with soft persuasion? --
Think you he can resist all this?


Piz. Your vanity amuses me.


El. Thank me for my good intentions, ere I repent them."


Page 34. Enter ELVIRA.] This scene is longer in the original. I have omitted
Elvira's proposal of love. Mr. Sheridan omits the whole scene.

Page 60. Imperfect and embittered.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"Roll. I am an interested man; for do I not die, that, when Cora ascends to her
father, her first question may be, "Where is Rolla?"


Page 69. The faith of heroes ever was the same.] Here the following lines are
omitted: -- "SCENE.
An open place not far from the Peruvian Camp. ATALIBA is discovered, reposing
under a Tree. Ata. How silent and dreary is every thing around me! The
sensations which succeed a victory resemble those which succeed a fever. We
rejoice at the danger which is past, and have scarcely strength enough to
rejoice. The smile swims in tears -- the triumph is expressed in sighs.
Conquest is dearly bought. History tells how many fell, but never tells how
many are made wretched. The arrow, which hits one heart, sometimes inflicts a
hundred wounds. Oh! I would sell all my conquests for one harvest-festival.


Enter a COURTIER. Cou. The herald is returned without consolation.


Ata. Is Alonzo dead?


Cou. No, but the Spaniards have refused the ransom. "Your treasures," said the
haughty spoilers, "belong to us, and in a few days we shall be your masters.
Justice dwells in our strength."


Ata. What! not yet humbled! Does this adder, then, which hisses round my
throne, for ever grow again? Where is Cora?


Cou. She fled with her child, but none knows whither. The army is alarmed and
sad, for Rolla too has disappeared.


Ata. Rolla! Impossible! He forsake me, when surrounded by distress and danger!
Oh, heavens! Is there no one who wishes to obtain my dignity! I will exchange
my situation for that of the meanest in my realm.


Enter ALONZO, in the Monk's habit. Alon. Do I behold my king again?


Ata. Alonzo, is it you?


Alon. Where is my wife?


Ata. Welcome appearance!


Alon. Where is my wife?


Ata. How did you escape?


Alon. By half a miracle.


Ata. Speak! -- Tell me all.


Alon. Whom but Rolla could friendship urge to make so great a sacrifice? Who
but Rolla could muffle himself in this mantle, and force his way even to my
prison? He it was, who broke my chains to hang them on himself.


Ata. Rolla in the power of the enemy! Alas! you wound me again.


Alon. (Throwing off the Monk's habit.) Give me a sword, and five hundred of
your boldest warriors, that I may hasten to release him.


Ata. Shall I risk in you my last support?


Alon. The enemy is dejected; the camp on the right side but ill defended.
Pizarro, by his cruelties, has made himself detested. The soldiers murmur; let
them not have time to reflect. If we obtain another victory, we may drive them
into the ocean.


Ata. Come with me. I will myself examine where it will be most proper to
attack them.


Alon. Do not thus expose yourself to danger. You are our king.


Ata. When the children are in danger, the father should exert himself.


Alon. Let me, then, first embrace my dearest Cora.


Ata. (Confused.) Cora!


Alon. Doubtless her sufferings have been great.


Ata. They have indeed.


Alon. In a moment I will return to you.


Ata. Where will you seek her?


Alon. (Alarmed.) Is she not here?


Ata. Her terrors drove her from us.


Alon. Whither?


Ata. I know not. Perhaps to the mountains, where her father dwells.


Alon. Heavens! What a chilness courses through my veins!


Cou. She was seen running through the field of battle, and calling for Alonzo
till it was dark.


Alon. And then?


Cou. Then she disappeared in the woods.


Alon. The woods! where Spanish soldiers are continually -- Cora! Cora! (Going.)


Ata. Alonzo! whither go you?


Alon. Wherever anguish and despair may lead me. Good Inca, thou art in safety.
The conquered foe dare not attempt to attack you. Oh thou, who do protect the
rights of all thy subjects, revere the rights of nature. My wife, my child, my
all is lost. Release me from my duty as a leader, that I may fulfill the duties
of a husband, and go in search of Cora.


Ata. I feel thy agony. Go, but forget not Rolla.


Alon. Cora! -- Rolla! -- What guardian angel will direct my steps. Exit.


Ata. (To the Courtier.) Lend me your sword. ( The Courtier presents it.
Ataliba tries to raise it, but his arm sinks.) I cannot. Poor monarch! What
avail reason and courage, if the limbs refuse their office. Exit."




Page 70. O nature, etc.] This speech is Mr. Sheridan's variation from the
author. The song which he introduced (for Cora to sing in this situation) I
have discarded.

Page 74. But I will find him.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"Co. I left my infant, and the vengeance of the gods pursues me.


L. C. Oh that I could console you!


Alon. Help me to bear this load of grief.


Co. (Raving.) Look at that speckled snake! -- see how it twines round the
child's body! -- Now it hisses! -- now it darts its sting into his heart!


Alon. Dearest Cora, recollect yourself.


Co. There the cruel Condor hovers in the air. Now it shoots down -- darts its
talons into the defenseless infant. There a blood-thirsty tiger lies in wait
for its prey! -- now it springs from the thicket! -- See how it tears him
piecemeal! (Falls) Help! help!


Alon. (Kneeling at her side.) My wife! My son!


L. C. Even to this solitude I am pursued by images of misery!


Alon. Give us consolation. Oh, Las Casas, my instructor, my benefactor, do not
forsake us at this dreadful hour.


L. C. I will remain with you, but we are close upon the Spanish camp. Fly to
your friends. I will accompany you.


Alon. How shall we convey this wretched being?


L. C. Try to raise her.


Alon. Come, dear Cora -- let us go.


Co. Go! Whither?


Alon. Back to our friends.


Co. I forsake this place -- this place, where my Fernando died?


Alon. The enemy is so near us --


Co. Cruel that thou art! Shall I not even collect my infant's bones?


Alon. Your father and brother are arrived.


Co. I have no father and brother. I only had a child.


Alon. We will seek it.


Co. (Suddenly springing up.) Seek it? Where? Where?


Alon. This old man will assist us.


Co. Yes, assist us, good old man! Help us to seek our child.


L. C. Willingly, dear Cora, if you will compose yourself.


Co. Have you any children?


L. C. No.


Co. Then I forgive the expression. Give me back my child -- then learn to know
the composure of a mother."


Page 75. Sculking! etc.] These two speeches of Rolla's, contain the substance
of the address which Mr. Sheridan made him deliver in the temple of the sun,
Act II. Scene II.

Page 76. As (...) lies between us.] Here the following lines are omitted:

"Piz. How if we were to be united by a mutual interest? Thou were before not
pleased when I made mention of my claim to Quito's throne. I renounce it.
Submit to the Spanish scepter, acknowledge the Christian faith, and I am
satisfied.


Roll. Very generous!


Piz. On Pizarro's friendship depends the protection of a mighty monarch, and
this Pizarro makes thee a voluntary offer of his hand.


Roll. Rolla is not a traitor.


Piz. Thou will at once avert all misery from thy native land.


Roll. To my native land I owe my life, but not my honor.


Piz. Thou will only remove a weak king from a station for which he was not
formed.


Roll. Ataliba weak! -- But were he so, a king who makes his people happy, is
strong through their affection.


Piz. Follow thy own counsel.


Roll. My conscience has long since decided.


Piz. Consider that rejected friendship rages as fiercely as rejected love.


Roll. Ha! that is the point at which I long have seen thee aim. Cast away the
mask.


Piz. (Checking his fury.) Rolla, do not mistake me.


Roll. May I go?


Piz. (After a struggle.) Go.


Roll. Will nothing intercept my way?


Piz. Nothing, unless repentance bring thee back.


Roll. Thanks to the Gods, I never yet repented any thing."


Page 77. Smiling in thy face.] Here the following lines are omitted: --

"Piz. Fancy this little head stuck on a lance's point -- then fancy Alonzo
rushing against us with uplifted sword, and bearing all before him like a
furious stream, which nothing can restrain but a -- child's head. Ha! there
stands he petrified. -- Down sinks his sword, and with a look of horror he
surveys the bloody banner, from which the drops still trickle down the lance.
-- Ha! ha! ha!


Roll. Art thou a human being?


Piz. Then, when he arrives at home, when his anxious wife throws her white
arms around his neck, and with her silken hair wipes off the drops of blood --
"Not so hasty," he will say. "You fancy this to be the blood of the enemy." --
Ha! ha! ha! -- "It is our infant's blood."


Roll. Look how the boy smiles. Could thou murder this innocent?


Piz. Could thou kill a pigeon?


Roll. If a ransom will content thee, I will send this infant's weight in silver.


Piz. Make a monument of it, and erect it on his grave.


Roll. Pizarro, thou art obliged to me for thy life. Grant me in return this
infant's life.


Piz. Will thou humble me by such a poor request?"


Page 78. Rolla crosses, etc.] Here Mr. Sheridan has, with great effect,
introduced in action what the author had given in narrative.

Page 79. Scene Third.] This scene in the original stands thus: --

"An open place near the Peruvian Camp. Enter ATALIBA with folded arms, and in
deep meditation. Ata. The enemy is quiet. My troops are buried in sleep. The
storm is over. Not a breath of air murmurs through the trees. Around me all is
silence and repose -- but not here -- (Points to his heart.) And why not here?
Am I to be pursued by the specter of the slain? Am I to be tormented by the
groans of the dying? Did I not draw the sword for God and my native land?


Enter CORA, raving. Co. Whither do you lead me? Where is my infant's grave?
(Espying the King.) Ha! Thou -- Son of the Sun, give me my child again.


Ata. Cora, whence come you?


Co. From my son's grave -- deep under the earth -- there it is cold and damp.
(Shuddering.) I shiver!


Ata. Horrible!


Enter ALONZO and LAS CASAS, in pursuit of CORA. Alon. Unhappy Cora! whither
does thy frenzy lead thee?


Co. Be silent, Alonzo. Here stands the sun of the gods. The sun is his father.
If he will but say a word, the grave will open, and disgorge its prey.
(Embracing Ataliba's knees.) Oh, my king, speak this one powerful word! Have
compassion on a mother's anguish,


Ata. Ye gods! what means this?


Alon. She has lost her child.


Ata. Poor mother, I cannot help you. Alas! I am but a king.


Co. You cannot! Who, then, can? To whom have the gods entrusted our existence?
Was it not you who led the Peruvians to battle? Did not my Alonzo fight for
you? Do you refuse me the only recompense for all his valor -- the life of a
child, who will hereafter fight for you?


Ata. Destroy me, ye gods! I cannot bear this.


Co. (Springing up.) Tyrant, whom my prayers and anguish cannot move, has not
blood enough yet flowed to satisfy thy rank ambition? Look! on each of thy
diamonds hangs a drop of blood. Art thou not satisfied without tearing infants
from their mother's breast, and casting them to beasts of prey? -- What is thy
diadem to me? What cares a mother for the throne of Quito? Hasten hither, all
ye, whom this victory has robbed of children! Help me to curse this foul
barbarian, and let our misery rise with his shouts of joy to heaven. Oh, if he
may but feel forever the distresses of one hapless mother, his punishment will
be sufficient. Sinks exhausted to the earth.


Alon. (Clasping her in his arms -- to Ataliba.) Forgive the frenzy of a mother.


Ata. (Wiping away a tear.) Alas! the throne supplies no compensation for this
tear.


Co. (Smiling.) Alonzo, my breast is painful. Reach me the child. (Exhausted.)
Alonzo, you are cruel; you see that I am dying, and will not let me once more
feel the rapture of beholding my child.


Alon. Alas! This is more dreadful than her fury. Rage on, poor wretched
mother! Thou no longer have a child.


Co. (Falling back.) Poor wretched mother! Thou no longer have a child.


Fnter a PERUVIAN. Per. Rolla comes.


Ata. and Alon. Rolla!"


FINIS.
