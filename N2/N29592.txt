CONVERSION EXEMPLIFIED.
AND now, to Life Raised by the Heavenly Call,
Henceforth, Vain Idols, I Renounce you all.
Vile Flesh, Thy raging Lust, and sordid Ease,
My winged Soul now shall not serve and please.
False World, Thy Laws shall be no longer mine,
Nor to thy Ways, my Newborn Soul incline.
Satan, Thou will, I know, my Tempter be;
But thy Temptation shall not Govern me.
Foolish I Have been; O Lord, I blush, I grieve;
And gladly would my Woeful Folly leave.
Fain would I Turn to God, but cannot alone:
Help, Sovereign Grace, or it will never be done!
To the Great GOD of Heaven I repair,
And Helped by Heaven, thus to Him declare.
Great GOD, Since to be Mine Thou willing art,
Oh! Be Thou mine! Replies my Conquered Heart.
To Glorify Thee, Glorious Lord* I take,
For That alone, which can me Happy make.
O FATHER, of all Things Creator Great,
Will thou all Happiness for me Create?
Eternal SON of God, will thou me Save,
That I the Hopes may of Gods Children have?
Eternal SPIRIT of God, Poor me will thou
With Spiritual Blessings of all sorts Endow?
Lord, Ravished at thy wondrous Grace, I do
These Gracious Offers now Conform unto.
O All-sufficient ONE, Will thou supply
My Wants from Stores of rich Immensity?
Shall Boundless Wisdom for my Good Contrive?
And Boundless Power, the Fruits of Goodness Give?
Shall Spotless Holiness on me Imprint,
An Holy Temper, with thine Image in it?
Lord, Thy Perfections all I do adore,
And to a Perfect Love my mind would soar.
A State of Bliss according to thy Word
Thou will unto thy Chosen Ones afford.
A State of Blissful Rest and Joy, wherein
Raised from the Dead, they shall be freed from Sin.
There Bathed in Rivers of Eternal Joy,
No Sorrows more shall them at all annoy.
GOD shall be All in All; Brought nigh to God,
In Him they shall forever make Abode.
They shall See God; The Beatific Sight!
And their own God shall take in them Delight.
My Soul, Make now thy Choice. O say; Is This
What thou do Choose for thy Chief Blessedness?
Things of this Present Time I now Refuse;
My Blessed GOD, Thee, Thee, and This I Choose.
May the sweet JESUS me to Glory bring,
And be my Glorious Prophet, Priest, and King.
Does the Almighty SON of God, to those
That Will, an Union with Himself propose?
My Lord, I will! The Will thou did bestow
To Thee, Oh, Let me be United so.
The full Obedience which my Surety paid
To God, may That my Righteousness be made.
A Wretched Sinner would appear in That,
Righteous before the dreadful Judgment Seat.
Show me thy Way, O Lord, Lest that I should
Fall by those Mockers that will me delude.
To thy Pure Scriptures way, I will adhere,
And find the Rule of my whole Conduct there.
All the Rebellion of my Heart Subdue;
And for thy work, O Lord, my Strength Renew.
From thy vast Fullness let my Faith derive
Strength to do all things, and to Thee to Live.
May thy Good SPIRIT me Possess, and Fill
With Light, and Zeal, to Learn and Do thy Will.
With His Kind Flames may He upon me Sieze,
And keep me always on my Bended Knees.
May all I am and have, be used for Him
Whose is my All, for He did me Redeem.
To Thee, Good SPIRIT, I lift up my Cries,
That thou will fall upon the Sacrifice.
May thy Bright ANGELS, be my Guardians then;
For Thee, they will Guard and Guide the Sons of Men.
By Thee assisted, LORD, Thus I Consent
Unto thy Everlasting COVENANT.
FINIS.
