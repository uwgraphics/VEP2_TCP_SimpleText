NEW YORK -- PRINTED BY THOMAS GREENLEAF.

RULES OF THE CITY DISPENSARY, etc.
The Subscribers to the Dispensary, established in this City, for the Relief of
the Poor and distressed, having, at their Meeting for the Election of Managers,
agreed to the following Resolution, to wit:

"RESOLVED, That the Managers of the Dispensary shall have Power to make such
Alterations in the original Constitution of this Society, as they shall, from
Time to Time, judge necessary: Provided, That such Alterations shall be subject
to Amendment or Revocation, at any annual Meeting of the Contributors:"

The Board of Managers have accordingly taken the Subject into Consideration,
and have agreed to the following Constitution and Bye Laws, as altered and
amended, for the future Regulation of this Institution.

THE CONSTITUTION.
1st. THAT every person who shall pay annually into the hands of the treasurer,
or to such other person as shall be appointed for that purpose, five dollars,
shall be a member of this institution, and be entitled to have two patients
always on the dispensary list; and for every two dollars and an half, which
shall be annually paid by any contributor, over and above five dollars per
annum, such subscriber shall be entitled to have one other patient on the
dispensary list. And every contributor who shall subscribe and pay fifty
dollars, shall be a member for life, and be entitled to have two patients
always on the dispensary list.

2d. That a board of thirteen managers shall be chosen on the second Monday in
January, every year, by a majority of the contributors, who shall attend for
that purpose or by their proxies, and who shall be entitled to one vote for
each subscription of five dollars; that seven managers shall constitute a
quorum, and, in case of the absence of the president, shall have power to
appoint a chairman, whose business it shall be to regulate all affairs relative
to the institution, to appoint a president, treasurer, and secretary annually;
to provide a house, medicines, and other necessaries for the sick: Provided
always, That no rule or regulation, for the government of the society, shall be
made or altered, unless at a regular meeting, and after notice thereof given at
a previous meeting.

3d. That the president and vice president of the medical society, for the time
being, be exofficio ex-officio managers of the dispensary.

4th. That one person shall be annually chosen by the managers, on the
Wednesday evening next following their electon, or on such succeeding evening
as the managers shall appoint, who shall act in the threefold capacity of
physician, surgeon, and apothecary to the dispensary, and who shall receive
such compensation for his services, as the managers from time to time shall
agree upon; that he shall continue in office until the Monday next ensuing the
annual election, or until another shall be chosen; that it shall be the duty of
the person so appointed, to attend such sick poor at their respective places of
residence, as may be recommended by any member of this institution, and who are
not able to go abroad; but that it shall not be required of him to attend any
poor at their own houses, who reside beyond a line drawn across the Island at
the two mile stone.

5th. That the person so appointed physician, surgeon, and apothecary, shall
attend on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from twelve to one o'clock, at the
dispensary, and shall prescribe for such patients as shall come there for
advice; and also administer to their relief as their cases may respectively
require; and that the poor, sick of any disease, acute, chronical, surgical, or
obstetrical, shall be objects of this charity; and such as may not have had the
smallpox, shall, at their own request, or that of their parents or friends, be
inoculated.

6th. Patients shall be admitted by a recommendation, signed by a subscriber,
who is to consider him or herself engaged, upon honor, not to recommend any but
such as are, in his or her opinion, really necessitous.

7th. The person appointed physician, surgeon, and apothecary, as aforesaid,
shall also keep a book, in which shall be fairly entered all prescriptions made
up by him, with an exact account of the names, places of abode, diseases, times
of admission and discharge of the patients; and shall be subject, from to time,
to such bye laws as may be made for his regulation: He may be dismissed for
neglect of duty, by the managers, at a board summoned for that express purpose,
at which not less than eight managers shall be present; and that his place, in
case of dismission, death, resignation, or removal, shall be supplied by the
managers, at their next or any subsequent meeting.

BYE LAWS.
THE managers shall meet at the dispensary on the third Monday in every month.

The president, and in case of his death or absence the treasurer, shall have
power, at all times, to call a meeting of the managers.

It shall be the duty of the president, or in case of his death or absence the
treasurer, to summon a meeting, whenever requested, in writing, by any three
managers.

A committee shall be appointed for each month in the year, whose duty it shall
be to give their occasional attendance at the dispensary, and report to the
board, what shall appear to them necessary, respecting the conduct of the
physician, and management of the dispensary.

The treasurer shall receive the subscriptions of the contributors, and pay out
such moneys as shall be directed by the board; his accounts shall be audited at
least twice in every year, by a committee to be appointed for that purpose, and
reported to the board, and a statement of his accounts shall be published for
the information of the contributors, in the month of December, in every year.

The person appointed physician, surgeon, and apothecary, shall constantly
reside at the dispensary, and be totally prohibited from prescribing or
practicing as physician, surgeon, or otherwise, except for the dispensary,
during his continuance in the aforesaid offices.

In the beginning of every year, and at such other times as may be required of
him by the board, he shall make a complete inventory of all utensils,
medicines, chirurgical instruments, and whatever else may be committed to his
charge, and shall hold himself accountable for the application of them; and
shall use his best endeavors to compel the patients to return such phials,
gallipots, and other utensils as may be entrusted to them.

(...) Day of (...) 179^ Contributor.

Rules to be strictly observed by the Patients.
1st. The out-patients, or such as are able to go abroad, and whose cases
require it, must attend at the dispensary on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,

to receive the necessary medical aid; and likewise to call at the dispensary at
such other times as shall be judged necessary.

2d. Those patients who are not able to go abroad, must send their
recommendations to the dispensary, as early as possible after receiving them;
when they will be visited by the physician at their respective places of abode.
And all patients are required attentively to follow such directions as shall be
given them, both with regard to medicines and diet, and particularly respecting
spirituous liquors.

3d. When any persons, recommended as out-patients (that is, such as are able
to go abroad) become incapable of attending at the dispensary, agreeably to the
first rule, such persons must send word to the dispensary of their inability,
in order that the physician may be informed thereof, who will attend them at
their own houses.

really necessitous.

5th. All the phials, gallipots, and other utensils are to be carefully
cleansed and returned to the dispensary.

dismission from the benefits of the dispensary, at the discretion of the
monthly committee, appointed by the managers to visit the dispensary.

7th. If any out-patients shall continue absent from the dispensary for the
space of two weeks, he or she being so absent, shall be considered as
discharged, unless a reason shall be given by such absent patient, as, in the
judgment of one of the members of the visiting monthly committee, for the time
being, shall be deemed satisfactory.

8th. All patients shall bring or send their recommendations to the dispensary
within the space of two weeks after their respective dates, otherwise such
recommendations will not be received.

THE following is an exact return of the patients admitted, cured, etc. from
the establishment of the Institution, Feb. 1st, 1791, to Feb. 1, 1795, being
four years.
Patients admitted 1431 Cured 1066 Died 113 Relieved 119 Removed to the
Hospital 43 do. to the Alms House 19 Discharged disorderly 25 Removed out of
Town 7 Remaining under care 39 1431

From the foregoing return the public will be enabled to form some judgment of
the future advantage that the poor of this City may hope to derive from this
institution, which has benevolence alone for its object. The families of many
persons, whose daily support depends upon their daily labor, not being able to
defray the expense of physicians, attendance, and medicine, frequently suffer
great inconvenience when sick, for want of medical aid; and others, when under
like circumstances, submit to the expense, often employ persons with a small
share of medical knowledge, in consequence of which life is sometimes lost, and
at best involve themselves and families in difficulties, from which, in some
instances, they rarely recover. The many advantages which have been derived
from similar institutions, both in Europe and America, inspire a pleasing hope
in the minds of the Managers, that such of their fellow citizens, who, in this
and many instances, have manifested a spirit of liberality, which justly
entitles them to the warmest approbation, will continue to give this
institution their special patronage.

That the Dispensary might be supplied with the best medicines, and at first
hand, the Managers some time past imported a considerable assortment from
Europe, which are paid for, and they have now remaining on hand medicines and
furniture to the amount of about 160l. -- They have also imported four complete
sets of aparatus, for the recovery of persons apparently drowned, which are
deposited at the following places, to wit.

One at Mr. Abraham Van Guelders, No. 77, Cortlandt-street, North river. One at
Mr. Abraham Bond's, No. 8, Little Water-street. One at Mr. Alderman Van Tuyl's,
No. 46. Water-street near Fly market. One at Mr. Alderman Beekman's
Water-street, between Pecks-flip and New-slip.
The present annual account of subscriptions to the Dispensary, after deducting
the expenses for collecting, is about 400l. and this statement is made without
making any allowance for subscribers who may happen to die, or remove from the
city; so that in all probability, the next annual revenue of the Dispensary, as
the subscriptions now stand, will fall short of the sum of 400l. above
mentioned; and as the yearly expenses of the Dispensary, including house-rent,
physician, surgeon, and apothecary's salary, amount to nearly the aforesaid
sum, it will be impossible for the managers to extend its usefulness to the
degree they ardently wish, unless many of their fellow citizens, who have
sufficient ability, and who have not yet honored the institution with their
names, will come forward and give it their patronage. From the above
representation, the public will see the propriety and necessity of the managers
soliciting fresh contributions, for the support of an institution, ever open
and ready to afford medical relief to the indigent sick.

Subscriptions will be taken at the Dispensary; also by Mr. Moses Rogers, the
(...) Treasurer, or by any of the managers.

The following certificates of the amount of subscriptions and expenditures,
since the first formation of the institution, February 1, 1791, to the 8
December, 1794, will give the public a clear view of the application of the
moneys, which have been received by the managers.
