(...) by that happy blissful way,
^e peaceful Pilgrims I shall see,
a^ have cast off their ^ags o^ clay,

Where no corrupted voices braul.

Nor forged Accuser bought or sold.
No Cause deferred, no vain spent Journey,
There Christ alone's the Kings Attorney

and he has Angels, but no Fees.
And when the twelve grand million Jury
Of all my Sins, will in a fury,
Against my Soul black Verdict give,
Christ pleads his Death, and then I live.
Be thou my speaker, taintless pleader,
Unblotted Lawyer, true Proceeder.
Thou give Salvation even for Alms,
Not with a bribed Lawyers palms.
