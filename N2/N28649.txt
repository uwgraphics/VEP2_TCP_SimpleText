THE STOCKBRIDGE FEDERAL ODE.
YE Sons of Columbia, unite in the cause,
Of Liberty, Justice, Religion and Laws,
Should foes then invade us, to battle we'll hie,
For the God of our fathers will be our Ally.
Should Frenchmen advance, though Europe join France,
Designing our conquest and plunder
United and free, we ever will be,
And our cannon shall tell them in thunder,
That foes to our freedom we'll ever defy,
'Till the continent sinks, and the ocean is dry,
When Bri^ain assailed us, undaunted we stood,
Defended the land we had purchased with blood,
Our liberty won, and it shall be our boast,
If the old world uni^ed should menace our coast,
Should millions invade, in terror arrayed,
And bid us our freedom surrender,
Our country they would sind, wi^h bayonets lined,
And WASHINGTON here to defend her,
For foes to our freedom, etc.

We are anxious that peace may continue her reign,
We che^ish the virtues which sport in her ^ain,
Our hearts ever me^^ when the fatherless sigh,
And we shiver at h^rror's funeral cry:
But still though we prize that child of the skies,
We'll never like slaves be accosted,
In a war of defense, our me^n^ are immense,
And we'll sight till our all is exh^^ste^.
For foes to our freedom, etc.

The Eagle of freedom with rapture behold
Over shadow our land with his plumage of gold;
The floodgates of glory are opened'd on high,
And Warren and Mercer descend from the sky,
They came from above with a message of love,
They bid us be firm and decided,
At liberty's call, uni^e one and all,
For you conquer unless your'e divided.
UNITE, and the foes of your freedom, etc.

Americans, seek no occasion for war!
The rude deeds of rapine still ever abhor,
Bu^, if in defense of your rights you should arm,
Let no toils discourage, no danger alarm;
For foes to your peace will ever increase,
If freedom and same you should barter,
Let those rights be yours, while creation endures,
For OMNIPOTENCE gave you the CHARTER.
Then foes to our freedom, etc.

HAIL COLUMBIA.
TUNE -- PRESIDENT'S MARCH.

HAIL Columbia, happy land,
Hail ye Herous -- Heaven-born band,
Who fought and bled in Freedom's cause.
Who fought and bled in Freedom's cause,
And when the storm of war was gone,
Enjoyed be peace your valor won,
Let independence be our boast
Ever mindful what it cost;
Ever grateful for the prize,
Let its ^^ar reach the skies.
Firm -- united -- let us be,
Rallying round our Liberty:
As a band of brothers joined,
Peace and safety we shall find.
Immortal Patriots, rise once more,
Defend your rights, defend your shore;
Let no rude foe with impious hand,
Let no rude foe with impious hand,
Invade the shrine where sacred lies
Of ^oil and blood the well-earn'd prize.
While offering peace sincere and just,
In Heaven we place a marly trust,
That truth and justice will prevail,
And every scheme of bondage fail.
Firm -- united, etc.

Sound, sound the trump of fame,
Let WASHINGTON's great name,
Ring through the world with loud applause,
Ring through the world with loud applause,
Let every clime to Freedom, dear,
Listen with a joyful ear.
With equal skill and God-like power,
He governs in the f^a^^ul hour
Of horrid war, or guide^ with ease
The happier times of honest peace,
Firm -- united, etc.

Behold the CHIEF who now commands,
Once more to serve his country stands --
(...) Rock on which the storm will beat,
(...) Rock on which the storm will beat,
^^t armed with vi^ture, firm and true.
His hopes are fixed on Heaven and You.
When hope was sinking, in dismay,
And glooms obscured Columbia's day,
His steady mind from changes free,
Resolved on Death or Liberty.
Firm -- united -- let us be,
Rallying round our liberty:
As a band of brothers joined.
Peace and safery we shall find.
SONG.
COME, hail the day, ye sons of mi^h,
Which gave your native country birth,
All hail the important hour:
Let ad^iration mark the da^.
When Fathers to their sons did say.
Be free, till time's no mo^e!
Columbia's sons have reared a tree,
The root, the branch, are Liberty,
Expanding far and wide:
Refulgen^ years, have tool'd away,
Since Freed^m blessed America --
Like those, two thousand glide.
When time released GEORGE WASHINGTON,
Not from affections he had won,
But from the height of care:
He left the reins of government,
To his suceessor's management,
Quite tired with noise and war.
O guide, ye gods, this reverend sage,
Until he is down the steep of age,
Then sooth his cares to rest:
Yet, may his virtues live again,
To vindicate the Rights of Man,
Of which we are possessed.
JOHN ADAMS, with a finished mind,
Columbia's chosen son, inclined
To take the important chair;
The hero takes the reins, and guides
America, against winds and tides,
To shun deg^^d^ng war.
But, if to war's terriffic sound,
We must devote fair freedom's ground,
To stain with blood its soil:
Then ROUSE, Americans, and show,
That you can wealth, or life bestow,
Ere FREEDOM meets a soil.
Should Europe's factions once attempt,
TO annihilate our government,
Or tread upon our shore:
Burgoyn'd, Cornwallis'd, they would be,
Or Arnold like, this country flee,
Or fall, to rise no more.
Then hail the day, ye sons of mirth,
Which gave your native country birth,
All hail the important hour
Let edmiration mark the day,
When fathers to their sons did say,
Be f^^^, till time's no more.
NEW YANKEE DOODLE.
SING Yankee Doodle, that fine tune,
Americans delight in;
It suits for peace, it suits for fun,
It suits as well for sigh^ing.
Chorus.
Yankee Doodle (mind the tune)
Yankee Doodle Dandy,
If Frenchmen come with naked bum,
We'll spank ^em hard and handy.
To Caira and Carmagnole,
Direct^ry dance like Neros;
By Frenchmen's songs, so full of wrongs,
And scorned by Yankee heroos,
Yankee Doodle, etc.
The President, with good intent,
Three Envoys sent to Paris,
But ci^que Tetes, would not with 'em treat,
Of honor France so bare is.
Yankee Doodle etc.
Through X. and Y. and Madam Sly,
They made demard of money;
For as we are told, the French love gold,
As t^^nging bees love Honey.
Yankee Doodle etc.
Nebuchad^^zzar long ago,
Set up a golden image.
Shadrach, Mesh^ch, Abednigo,
Would not fall down in homage.
Yankee Doodle, etc.
Just so cinque Tetes, with pride elate,
Of Marshall, Pinckney, Gerry,
Demand that they ^dore and pay,
The pi^^r to make merry.
Yankee Doodle, etc.
That Talleyrand might us trappan,
And over the country found it;
He sent his pill, to Aurora's mill,
And Benny faction ground it.
Yankee Doodle, etc.
But Ma^shall came, with trump of fame,
And brought the noble answer;
Without a jonk, he had in soak,
A ^^d for Telleyrand, Sir.
Yankee Doodle, etc.
With fraud and lie, Directory,
Deal in deceit and evil;
Who Venice sold, for power and gold,
Would sell us to the Devil.
Yankee Doodle, etc.
Their 'sernal bugs, may squeeze Dutch bugs,
But we will have no master;
And while the Swiss, Sans i. e. Wedding breeches.
Culottes kiss,
We'ell spread a blister plaster.
Yankee Doodle, etc.
Americans then fly to a^^s,
And learn the way to use 'em:
If each man fights to ^fend his rights,
The French cannot long abuse 'em.
Yankee doodle, etc.
Bold ADAMS did, in seventy-six,
Our independence sign, sir:
And he will not, give up a jot,
Though all the world combine Sir.
Yankee doodle, etc.
Let every men, adopt his plan,
Like brothers slick together:
Then all the threats, of vile cinque Tetes,
Will never weigh a feather.
Yankee doodle, and.
If we are fi^m, peace will return,
S^eet peace, the very dandy:
May they that slinch, a single inch
Never taste the sugar candy.
Yankee doodle (mind the tune), etc.
SONG.
Tune -- Rule Br^tania.
WHEN Britain with despotic sway,
Would at her feet our freedom lay,
Would at, etc.
We raised the Standard -- to arms, to arms, (...) cried,
Our patriots fought -- they bled, they di'd.
Independent Columbians, they would be,
Resolved to perish, or be free.
Great WASHINGTON did then command;
He led the bo^d heroic band,
He led, etc.
They fought and conquered -- Columbia's Sons were free,
Resolved on death or liberty.
Independent Columbians they would be,
Resolved to perish, or be free.
When France her struggle first began
For liberty, the rights of man,
For liberty, etc.
Glowing with ard^r -- with ardot in her cause,
We scorned that Kings should give her laws.
Independent -- may Gallia still be free,
They fought at first for liberty.
But France, you now forget your friend,
Our amity is at end,
Our amity, etc.
You rob our commerce, insult us on our coast,
Divide and conquer, is your boast.
Know proud Frenchmen, united we will be,
Resolved to perish or be free.
Shall we to France a tribute pay,
Or at her seet our freedom lay,
Or at, etc.
Forbid it Heaven Columbia's freemen cry,
We will be free or nobly die.
Know proud Frenchmen united we will be,
Resolved on death or liberty.
United then with heart and hand,
Our constitution firm shall stand,
Our constitution, etc.
Then raise the standard, let this your motto be,
Our father's fought, and so will ^e.
Hail Columbians, united we will be,
Like them we'll conquer and be free.
SONG.
FAIR liberty! whom heaven gave
But where peculiarly it loves;
And put off all it mean: for slave
With orange bowers and citron groves!
The children of the frozen north,
Where nature half her gifts retains.
Are doomed to tame the churlish earth,
For tasteless fruits, and tardy grains;
Yet while their weary task they ply,
By thee their fainting souls are cheered!
No stern unfeeling Lord is nigh:
No rods are seen, no chains are heard!
Still as they guide the delving plough,
Or bind pale Autumn's scanty store;
To thee, their manly lives they vow,
To thee, their grateful strains they pour!
SONG.
A soldier, a soldier, a soldier for me,
His arms are so bright,
And he looks so upright,
So gallant and gay.
When he trips it away,
Who is so nice and well powdered as he
Sing rub a dub, rub a dub, rub a dub a dub a dub dub dub,
Thunder and plunder,
A soldier, a soldier, a soldier for me.
Each morn when we see him upon the parade,
He cuts such a slash,
With his go^ get and sash
And makes such ado,
With his gaiter and queue.
Sleeping, or waking, who need be afraid,
Sing, rub a dub, etc.
Or else when he is mounted so trim and so tall,
With broad sword in hand,
The whole town to command,
Such capers, such prances,
Such ogling, such glances,
Our hearts gallop off, and are left at Whitehall.
Sing taran, tantaran, tantaran, tantaran tan, trumpet and thump it.
A soldier, a soldier, a solder for me.
A soldier, etc.
SONG, ON LIBERTY.
COME, come, my brethren dear,
Now we are assembled here,
Exalt your voices clear,
With harmony,
There Is none shall be admitted in,
Were he a Lord, a Duke or King.
He Is counted but an empty thing,
Except he is free.
Then let every man take glass in hand,
Drink bumpers to our native land,
As long as he can sit or stand,
With decency.
By our arts we prove,
Emblems of mutual love,
Types given from above,
To those who are free.
There Is not a tyrant who fills a throne,
Will ever be ashamed to own,
Those liberties to monarchs unknown,
But such as we.
Then let etc.
SONG.
GUARDIAN of our nation, stand firm in your station,
While Europe is all in commotion;
We'll let the world see that America's free,
Our flag shall ride safe on the ocean.
Since Fr^nce does aspire to set us on fire,
And fill our Grand Court with distraction,
Then firm let us be, uni^ed and free.
In spite of proud France and of faction.
We'll n^'er have a king, though of ADAMS we'll sing,
And chaun^ to our children h^s sto^y;
We'll let the world see Columbia i^ free,
And fight for our country and glory.
Our Navy shall ^ide on the ocean so wide.
With all ^he ^roud billows in motion,
No tyrant shall da^e his e^ sig^s t^ ^ear,
And pi^a^es shall fly from the ocean.
These pirates of France have dor'd to advance
To our s^a^, and ^he m^u^h of u^ harbors;
But Frenchmen shall see our st^^e will be free,
We'll clear all our co^sts of ^u^h robbers.
Now let us unite to stand for ^u^ right.
And protect our ^^^^m (...) f^^m plander;
These rovers at sea, shall begin now to flee,
When Ganges discha^ges his thunder.
SONG. THE NEW YORK PATRIOTIC SONG.
Tune -- Wasington's Marck and Yanke^ Doodle,
POETS may sing of their Helicon streams,
Their Gods and their heroes are fabulous dreams;
They re'er sang a line,
Half so grand, so divine.
As the glorious toast
We Columbians boast,
The Federal Constitution boys, and LIBERTY forever.

ADAMS, the man of our choice, guides the helm,
No tempest can harm us, no storm overwhelm;
Our sheet anchor's sure,
And our ba^k rides secure,
So here is to the toast
We Columbians boast,
The Federal Constitution boys, and President forever.

A free navigation, commerce and trade:
We'll seek for no foe, of no foe be afraid;
Our frigate's shall ride
Our desence and our pride;
Our tars guard our coast,
And h^zza to our toast,
The Federal Constitution, Trade, and Commerce, boys forever.

^o^^gomery, Warren, still live (...) our (...),
Like them our young heroes shall sp^rn at our wrongs,
The world shall admire
The zeal and the fire
Which blaze in the toast,
We Columbians boast,
The Federal Constitution, and its Advocatea forever.

When an enemy threats all party shall cease,
We bribe no ^ntriguers to buy a mean peace,
Columbians will scorn
Friend or foe to suborn,
We'll never stain the toast,
Which as freemen we boast,
The Federal Constitution and Integrity forever.

Fame's trumpet shall swell in WASHINGTON'S praise,
And time grant a furlough to lengthen his days,
May h^al^h wa^e the thread
Of delight round his head;
No nation can boast
Such a name -- such a toast --
The Federal Constitution boys, and WASHINGTON forever.

SONG.
GOD save the United States,
Free from the worst of fates;
Vile Gallic sway,
May they forever be,
Just, Independent, free,
Liberty's misery,
(...) Without dismay.
O God, great Adams save,
The firm, the good, the brave,
Who now commands,
May every enemy.
Fa^ from his presence flee,
And be dire anarchy,
Crushed by his hands.
Save too great WASHINGTON,
Columbia's dearest son,
Te be our shield.
When war's r^nen'd ^larms,
Shall call aga^n to arms,
And threatening danger warns
Us to the fi^ld.
"O Lord, our God a^ise;
"Scatter our enemies,
"And m^ke them f^ll,
"Confound their poli^ies,
"Frustrate their knavish tricks,
"On thee our hopes are fixed,
"O save us all."
Let a^^ with one consent;
Unite with government,
Our rights to guard,
May jarring d^scord cease.
Our social j^ys enc^ease,
And smling Heaven born peace
Be our reward.
SONG. THE FARMER's PATRIOTIC OD^.
TUNE -- Vicar of Bray.
FROM the soil our fathers dearly b^t,'
No foe their sons shall sever;
The laws for which our heroes fought,
Shall guard their rights forever.
When foes invade. with heart and hand,
We'll crowd the field of action;
From Gallic weeds, we'll purge aur land,
And crush the reptile faction.
Ere Jacobins shall lord it here,
Or we for Frenchmen labor,
The pruning hock shall dart, a spear,
The ploughshare glow, a sabre!
When foes, etc.

Let Gallia's pirates cross the waves,
To ask a contribution;
On land, we'll point them to their graves,
By Sea, the CONSTITUTION,
When foes, etc

Our swains shall quir their lover's arms,
And WASHINGTON shall lead 'em;
The husband leave d^mestic charms,
And know no friend, but Freedom.
When foer, etc.

The freeborn child, the tender wife,
Shall brave each sad disaster:
(...), the savage kaife:
(...) a ^^llic master.
(...) ^^^^de Columbia's friends
Shall (...) the field of action,
(...) to (...) waves repel the fiends,
That sew the sceas of faction.
SONG.
TO the standard repair,
Each jolly bold Tar.
Our country calls loudly to arms;
T^a^h the bullies of France,
The a^'d Yankee-Dance,
It Is freedom our bosom that warms.
I et the bean Talleyrand,
With his s^uff box in hand,
Ask again a doceur for admission;
Come here Monsieur Frog,
Take a ^^ff of our grog,
And we'll show you a Yankee commission.
Do you think Gallic Crows,
Can catch us adoze.
While storms are thick gathering aloft;
Pardonnez Monsieur,
Our Liberty's dear,
You Will not find us with sculls quite so soft.
Each day a new ship,
With her anchor atrip,
Is armed, and the Eagle full spread:
If America stoops,
And her sons become dupes,
It must be when her tars are all dead,
Come each honest soul,
Pass around the full bowl,
To ADAMS our glorious head;
Thank the good Gods above,
Who America love, --
Great WASHINGTON too is not dead!
Mother Carey's soul brood,
Can do you no good,
While such wor^hies America lead;
Our Ca^^ains are bold,
And despise secret gold,
Our coin boys, is Iron and Lead.
SONG.
COLUMBIA's Bald Eagle displays in his Claws,
The arrows of Jove, to confound her proud foes;
While the artful French Bear, with his wide spreading paws.
Would ensnare us by hugs far more fatal than blows.
But his hugs and his blows we will meet them like men,
And the Eagle shall drive the beast back to his den.
The terrible bear, not yet sated with blood.
Growls around his huge den, over the bones of his prey;
Though now gorged to the full, he still howls for more food,
And would lore by his tricks fair Columbia away.
But his tricks and his howls we despise them like men,
And the Eagle shall drive the beast back to his den.
Not a Frog ever shall bribe him to stay his rude shocks,
For the Eagle disda^ns to retreat from his ire:
We will marshal our columns as solid as rocks,
And receive the proud Frenchmen in vollies of fice,
Like true s^ns of Columbia, we will act still like men.
And her Eagle shall drive the Bear back to his den.
SONG.
TO Columbia, who, gladly reclined at her ease,
On Atlan^ic's broad bosom lay smiling in peace,
M^nerva s^^w hastily, sent from above.
And addressed her this message from ^hundering Jove:
"Rouse, quickly awake,
"For your freedom's at stake,
"Storms arise, your renowned independence to shake;
"Then lose not a moment, my aid I will lend,
"If your sons will assemble your rights to defend."
Roused Columb^a rose up, and indignant declared,
That no nation she would wronged, and no nation she feared.
That she wished not for war, but if war was her fate,
She could meet it with souls independent and great;
Then tell mighty Jove,
That we quickly will prove,
We'll deserve the protection he will send from above,
For never shall ^he sons of America bend,
But united, their rights and their freedom defend,
Minerva smiled cheerfully as she withdrew.
Enraptured to find her Americans true;
"For (said she) our sly Mercury oft-times reports
"That your sons are divided" -- Columbia retorts:
Tell that vile god of thieves,
His report but deceives,
And we care not what madman such nonsense believes.
For never shall the sons of America bend;
But united, their rights and their freedom defend.
Jove rejoiced in Columbians this union to see
And swore by old S^^x they deserved to be free;
Then assembled the gods, and to all gave consent.
Their assistance if needful in war to present;
M^^s arose, and shook his a^mour,
And swore, his old farmer
Should never in his country see ought that could harm her;
For never should the sons of America bend,
But united, their rights and their freedom defend.
Minerva refolv'd that her Aegis she would lend;
Had Apollo declared he their cause would befriend;
Old Vulcan an armor would forge for their aid,
More firm than the one for Achill^es he made;
Then said he I Will prepare,
A compound most rare,
Of courage and union each a full share,
That never can the sons of America bend,
But their rights and their freedom most firmly defend.
Ye sons of Columbia then join hand in hand:
Divided we fall, but united we stand;
It Is ours to determine, it is ours to decree,
That in peace we will live independent and free.
And should from afar,
Break the horrors of war,
We'll always be ready at once to declare,
That never will the sons of America bend,
But united, their rights and their freedom defend.
SONG.
COME all Grenadiers let us join hand in hand,
And swear by our country most truly to stand;
Round the banners of liberty manfully range,
Resolved to preserve it unblemished by change.
And should our proud foes in their insults persist,
Their arts is their arms we will firmly resist;
For our glorious freedom we drew with our breath
And with it we'll keep it unfully'd till death.
Our cause truly noble, and honor our guide,
The defense of our country shall ever be our pride,
Determined her dear Independence to guard,
In her happiness only we'll seek our reward.
For her every labor endu^'d will be sweet,
For her every dangor we'll cheerfully meet,
For our glorious, etc.

From our father who gained it, our freedom we hold,
And it never by their sons shall be cowardly sold.
To guard it our fortunes shall freely b^ spent;
But to buy it COLUMBIA will never giv^ a cent:
Then let it by Frenchmen be well understood,
That if we must purchase, our price i^ our BLOOD.
For our glorious. etc.

SONG. TIME AND LIBERTY.
TIME has not th^n'd my flowing hair,
Nor bent me with his iron hand
Ah! why so soon the bl^ssom tear,
E're Autumn yet the fruit demand.
Let me enj^y the cheerful day,
Till many a year has over me rolled:
Pleas^d let me t^ifle life away,
And sing of liberty e're I grow old.
TRUXTON's VICTORY. A Naval Patriotic Song,
sung by Mr. Hodgkinson, and composed by Mrs. Rowson, of Boston.
WHEN freedom, fair freedom her banner displayed,
Defying each foe whom her rights would invade,
Columbia's brave sons swore those rights to maintain,
And over ocean and earth to est^blish her reign.
Unit^d they cry,
While that standard shall fly,
R^solv'd, firm and steady,
We always are ready
To fight and to conquer, to conquer or die.
Though GALL^A through Europe has rushed like a flood,
And deluged the earth with an ocean of ^^ord;
While by FACTION she is led. While she is governed by KNAVES,
We court not her ^m les, and will never be her flaws:
He^ ^hreats we defy,
While oar standard shall fly;
Resolved firm and steady,
We alwavs are ready
To fight and to conquer; to co^quer or die.
Though France with caprice days our sl^tesmen upbraid.
A tribute d^m^nds, or sets bounds to our trade;
From our young rising NAVY our thunders shall roar,
And our Commerce extend to the earth's utmost shore.
Our cannon we'll ply,
While our standard shall fly;
Resolved, firm and steady,
We always are ready,
To fight and to conquer; to conquer or die.
To know we are resolved, let them think on the hour.
When Truxton, brave Truxton, off Nevis's shore,
His ship manned for battle, he standard unfurled,
And at the Insurgente d^fiance he hurled:
And his valiant Tars cry,
While our standard shall fly.
Resolved, firm and steady,
We always are ready
To fight and to conquer; to conquer or die.
Each heart beat exulting, inspired by the cause;
They fought for their country, their freedom, and laws:
From their cannon loud vollies of vengeance they p^er'd,
And the standard of France to Columbia was lowered.
Hazza! they now cry,
Let the Eagle wave high;
Resolved, firm and steady,
We always are ready
To fight and to conquer; to conquer or die.
Then raise high the strain, pay the tribute that is due,
To the fair CONSTELLATION, and all her brave CREW:
Be TRUXTON revered, and his name be enrolled
Mo^gst the Chiefs of the Ocean, the Heroes of old.
Each invader defy,
While such He^oes are nigh,
Who always are ready,
Resolved, firm and steady,
To fight and to conquer; to conquer or die.
THE CONSTELLATION's VICTORY,
TUNE, "The Arethusa Frigate."
COME, all ye jolly sailors bold,
Whose hearts are cast in honor's mould,
While Columbia's glory I unfold,
Huzza! to the Consteliation;
^or she is frigate stout and brave
^s ever stemmed the dashing wave;
^er men are staunch to the Baltimore launch;
and when the foe shall meet our fire,
^oner than strike we'll all expire
On board of the Constellation.
(...) was on February the ninth, that she so stout,
^^e island of Nevis was cruising abo^t,
^hen a large French sail, in view to the south
Hove in sight of the Co^st^llation,
^^e famed l'Insurgente a head did lie,
The Constellation seemed to fly;
(...) a (...) or tack, or a brace would she slack;
Though the Frenchmen laughed, and though it it fluff.
Yet they know not the handful of men so tough
On board of the Constellation.
On deck four hundred men did dance,
The floutest they could fi^d in France;
We with three hundred did advance
On board the Constel^a^ion.
Serv'r^l times he Frenchman hailed us hea?
We under her lee did nicely go;
And our two-round shot so well we plied,
That every broadside pier^'d her side --
In an hour -- for quarter the Frenchmen cried,
And struck to the Constellation.
'Twas post meridian -- quarter past past three
When we ran under the enemy's lee;
They mounted forty guns, and we
Mounted thirty eight in the Constellation.
And now to conclude, may Columbia's navy
Send all Gallic pira^es to the locker of Da^y!
Let each fill a glass to his fav'ri^e^ l^ss;
A health to brave Truxton, and officera true,
And all that belong to the ^allant crew
On board of the Constellation.
PAUL JONES. A much admired SONG.
AN American frigate from Baltimore came
Guns mounted forty, the Rich, in by (...),
A cruising in the channel of Old England,
With a noble commander, Paul Jones, was the Man
We had not sailed long, 'till we did espy,
A large forty-four and a twenty so nigh;
Two bright frigates well laden with store,
In concert they purs^'d us from the Old Yorkshire shore.
At the hour of twelve Pierce came along side,
With a loud specking trumpet, "whence came you, he cried?
"Come give me an answer, I hall'd you before,
Or this very moment a broadside I Will pour.
Paul Jones gave a smile, saying boys we'll not run,
Let every brave seaman stand close to his gun;
A broad side it came from these English men,
And the brave buckskin heroes returned it again.
We fought them four glasses, four glasses so hot,
That ^0 b^ld seamen lay dead on the foot:
And above 40 more lay weltering in their gore,
While Pierce's loud cannon upon the Richard did roar.
Our gunner got frightn'd, and to Paul Jones came,
Saying our ship she takes water, likewise in a flame:
Paul Jones laughing -- in the height of his pride,
Said, if we can do no better we'll sink along side
(...) Richard bore down and the Lion did ^^ke,
Which caused the heart of bold Pierce for to ache
Our shot flew so hot they could not stand us long,
Before the undaunted union of Britain came down.
Come now my brave boys, we have taken a rich prize
A large forty-four and twenty likewise:
He^e is a health to all widows who have cause to weep,
For the loss of their husbands in the bottom-less deep.
SONG. FLY TRAITORS.
FLY ye traitors from out land,
Fly ye Jacobinic band,
Who join the French and aid their cause;
Who join the French and aid their cause;
And sh^u^d the storm of war come on,
N^ doubt you would to their stardard run.
The independence which we boast,
By your vile ar^s was nearly lost;
Fach true Columbi^n will despise
The traitors who the Frenchmen prize.
All their arts employed we see
To destroy our liberty,
Like a band of rascals joined
May they be to hell consigned.
Ye democrats who strove once more
To make rude foes attack our shore,
Invited over the impious band,
Invited over the impious band,
Encouraged by your artful lies
To wrest from us the rights we prize;
While ye oppose each, measure just,
The French in you place all their trust,
That through your influence they will prevail,
But all their wick^d schemes shall fail.
All their arts, etc.

May public infamy and shame
Forever brand the traitor's name,
Who boasted he should not oppose
The French, should they come here as foes:
While they protect his interest dear,
He turns to them a joyful ear.
With matchless skill he make a his power
Assist his in crest every hour;
For while he gain, his heart's at ease;
Though he destroy's his country's peace.
All his arts, etc.

While those who league wi^h Talleyrand;
Once more to cheat our country stand;
Ye Democrats on you they call,
Ye Democrats on you they call,
For all the Jacobinic crew
Their hopes are fixed on hell and you;
But now o'erwhel'd with dire dismay,
Their schemes exposed in open day,
From vile French influence we'll be free,
Nor dread destructive anarchy.
Though all their arts employed should be
To introduce vile anarchy,
The band of rascals soon shall find,
Their names to infamy consigned,
AMERICA, COMMERCE and FREEDOM.
HOW blessed the life a sailor leads.
From clime to clime still ranging,
For as the calm the storm succeeds,
The scene delights by changing,
Though tempest howl along the main,
Some objects will remind us,
And ^^ear with hope to meet again
The friends we left behind us.
Then under full sail we laugh at the gale,
And the landsmen look pale, never heed them;
But toss off a glass to a favorite lass,
To America, Commerce, and Freedom,
But when arrived in sight of land,
Or safe in port rejoicing,
Our ship we moor, our sails we hand,
Wh^^^t out the boat is horsting;
With che^rful hearts the shore we reach,
Our friends delighted greet us,
And ripping lightly over the beach,
The pretty lasses meet us.
When the full flowing bowl enlivens the soul,
To fo^t it we merrily them,
And each bony lass will drink off her glass.
To America, Commerce and Freedom.
Our prizes sold, the chink we share,
And gladly we receive it,
And when we meet a brother Tar,
That wants, we freely give it:
No freeborn sailor yet had store,
But cheerfully would lend it,
And when it is gone -- to sea for more,
We earn't but to spend it.
Then drink round my boys, it is the first of our joys,
To relieve the distressed clothe and feed them,
It Is a duty we share with the brave and the fair,
In this land of commerce and freedom.
SONG.
Tune -- Rule Britannia.
WHEN our great Sires this land explored,
A shelter from Tyrannic wrong!
Led on by Heavens Almighty Lord,
They sung -- and acted well the song,
Rise united! dare be freed!
Our sons shall vindicate the deed.
In vain the region they would gain.
Was distant, dreary, undiselosed,
In vain the Atlantic roared between,
And hosts of savages opposed.
They rushed undaunted, hea'vn decreed
Their sons should vindicate the deed.
'Twas freedom, led the vet'rans forth,
And manly fortitude to bear,
They toiled, they vanquished! such high worth
Is always heavens peculiar care,
Their great example still inspires,
Nor dare we act beneath our Sires.
It Is ours undaunted to defend,
The dear bought, rich inheritance:
And spire of each invading hand,
We'll fight, bleed, die! in its defense,
Pursue our fathers' path to same,
And emulate their glorious flame.
As the proud oak inglorious stands,
'Till storms, and thunder root it fast,
So stood our new, unpractic'd bands,
'Till Britain roared her stormy blast:
Then he they vanquished, fierce led on
B^ freedom and great Washington.
Hail, godlike hero! b^rn to save!
Never shall thy deathless laurels fade,
But on tha brow, eternal wave,
And consecrate blessed Vernen's shade,
Thy spreading glories still increase,
'Till earth, and time, and nature cease.
Oh! may that spirit on thee shed,
Columbia's truest, noblest friend!
On thy successor's honored head,
In copious, double, showers descend!
This charge to Adams be consigned,
Be thou the second of mankind.
So when Elijah, called to heaven,
Up in the flaming chariot r^de,
Elisha took the mantle given,
And rose a prophet -- or a god!
Then sh^u^ groat Adams! freedom's son!
Immortal her of Washington.
SONG.
COME, care curing mirth,
From Wit's hour forth,
Bring Humor, your brother, along:
Hospitality's here,
And Harmony near,
To Chorus droll Sentiment's song.
In Comedy trim,
Joke, Jesture, and Whim,
With Trios will keep up the ball;
By order of Taste,
We open the feast
Of Friendship, in Liberty Hall.
Who'd President be?
Unanimity; see
He Is ordered to sit as our host;
My Lord Common Sense,
With pains and expense,
Introduced him to give out the toast.
Though Scandal we hate,
Only good we hold great,
Nor any for title's sake praise;
Unworthy that name,
No merit can claim,
But what genealogies raise.
In this Anno Dom. we
Would felicity see,
I Will demonsrate how easy we could,
Change fault finding elves
To mending ourselves,
Then things might soon be as they should.
Some wives read their mates
Curtain lecture debates,
And wonder they are not understood;
The Husband's perplexed,
And the Lady is vexed,
'Cause every thing's not as it should.
If pension or place,
Is the gift of his grace,
Refusal would be over nice:
Plumb Pudding on board,
And pressed by my lord,
Who would not come in for a slice?
Corruption's the cry,
Opposition runs high,
Yet who can help laughing to see,
Though factions so big
Ambo Tory and Whig.
In one part both parties agree (...)
For the kingdom of man,
Division's the plan,
By the laws of the Cyprian cour^,
The ladies must yield,
When our standard we wield,
And what we advance they support.
For a bumper I call --
Here Is to the sovereign of All.
The spring from which all honor flows:
From thence we all came,
So we go to that same,
Here Is to it, and to it, Here goes.
SONG.
HOW bright are the joys of the table,
I mean when the cloth is remov'd^
Our hearts are fast held by a cable,
While round the decanter is should.
The ladies all rise to retire,
We stand up and look very grave:
A bumper then draw round the fire,
Determined like souls to behave.
My servant, he knows I Am a toper,
"Clean glasses, of wine a recruit!"
He brings in a six bottle cooper,
And places it close at my foot.
I gingerly take up a bot^le.
The saw-dust I puff from his coat;
The cork out, he sings in the throttle,
But sweeter than Mira his note!
"What gentleman coffee now chooses?"
The compliment comes from the fair;
No gentleman coffee resuses.
But not a man s^irs from his chair.
Though Frenchmen may do so, I bar it,
With British politeness I think;
While Monsieur we thank for his claret,
He never shall teach us to drink.
Gay Hebe now shows in Apollo.
A struggle 'twixt claret and wit;
For Bacchus insists he shall swallow,
Six bumpers before he may sit.
Ye fair, why so ill should we treat you,
To ^^rt ere the battle is won?
At supper Ap^llo shall meet you,
And (...) you what Bacchus has done.
SONG.
MY mother says, I Am now sixteen,
Must dress -- in the beau monde be seen,
Reply to all the vows of men,
No, no, no.

In sweetest buds there canker lies,
And in the rose sharp thorns arise;
All this she says to make me wise,
And say no.

When Henry the other morning came,
Professed an honest tender flame,
And asked me, if the day I Would name,
I said no.

I told him, mother I Would obey,
And must reply of course with nay;
He sighed, then shall I far away?
I said no.

My speaking tears betrayed my love:
He said, shall Hymen doubt remove,
To church, you will not deny to rove?
I sighed no.

My mother now I have obeyed,
Attended well to what she (...)
And will to all -- but him I wed,
Still say no.

SONG.
A FLAXEN headed cow-boy, as simple as may be,
And next a merry plough boy I whist'led over the lea:
But now saucy footman, I strut in worsted lace,
And soon I Will be a butler and wag my jolly face.
When steward I Am promoted, I Will snip a tradesman's hill,
My master's coffers empty, my pockets for to fill:
When lolling in my chariot, so great a man I Will be,
You Will forget the little plough-boy that whist'led over the lea.
I Will buy votz^ at elections, but when I Have made the pelf,
I Will stand poll for parliement, and then vote in myself:
Whatever's good for -- me, sir, I never will oppose;
When all my ayes are sold off, why then I Will sell my nose.
I Will bawl, harangue and paragraph, with speeches charm the ear,
And when I Am tired on my legs, then I Will sit down a peer,
In co^et or city honor, so great a man I Will be;
You Will forget the little plough-boy that west'led over the lea.
SONG.
IN storms, when clouds obscure the sky,
And thunders roll, and lightenings fly --
In midst of all these dire alarms,
I think, my Sally, on thy charns.
The troubled main,
The wind and rain,
My ardent passion prove;
Lashed to the helm,
Should seas o^erwhelm,
I Would think on these, my love!
When rocks appear on every side,
And art is vain the ship to guide;
In varied shapes, when death appears,
The thoughts of thee my bosom cheers.
The troubled main, etc.

But should the gracious powers be kind --
Dispel the gloom, and still the wind,
And wait me to thy arms once more,
Safe to my long lost native shore:
No more the main,
I, d tempt again,
But tender joys improve,
I then with thee,
should happy be,
And think on naught but love!
SONG.
A ROSE tree in full bearing,
Had sweet flowers fair to see
One rose beyond comparing,
For beauty, attracted me;
Though eager once, to win it,
When lovely, blooming, fresh and gay,
I found a conker in it,
And now, throw it far away.
How fine this morning early!
The sun shiing fair and bright,
So late I loved you dearly,
Though lost now, each fond delight,
The clouds seem big with showers,
The sun beams no more are seen,
Farewell, ye fleeting hours,
Your falsehood has changed the scene,
When fair Aurora blushes,
And heaven's serene and clear,
The linnets, barks and thrushes,
With music, delight the ear;
When storms begin to gather,
And clouds veil the vaulted skies,
They bid adieu to pleasure,
In silence, their music dies.
So when you was my lover,
I thought you was all divine,
No blemish could discover,
But now, all your vices shine;
I find you are inconstant,
You're false and fickle as the wind,
I Will think no more upon you,
But banish you from my mind.
As little Cupid played,
The sweet blcoming flowers, among,
A be, that lay concealed
Under the leaves, his finger stung;
Tears down his pretty cheeks ran,
He frantic, blowed the smarting wound,
And crying through the grove ran,
Until he his mother found;
Mamms, I Am sorely wounded,
Assist me, or I die with pain,
My anguish is unbounded,
A be stung me, on the plain;
She smilingly, replying,
Said, O my son, how can it be?
That by a be you're dying,
What must she feel, who is stung by thee?
SONG.
HOW stands the glass around?
For shame, ye take no eat, my boys,
How stand the glass around?
Let mirth and wine abound,
The trumpets sound;
The colors they are flying, boys.
To fight, kill, or wound,
May we still be found,
Content with our hard fate, my boys,
On the cold ground.
Why, soldiers, why,
Should we be melancholy, boys?
Why, soldiers, why,
Whose business it is to die!
What sighing fie!
Drown fear, drink on, be jolly boys,
It Is he, you or I!
Cold, hot, wet or dry,
We Are always bound to follow, boys,
And scorn to fly!
It Is but in vain --
I mean rot to upbraid ye, boys --
It Is hut in vain
For soldiers to (...)
Should ne^ (...)
Send us to (...)
SONG. The Old Maid's Last Prayer.
COME all you pretty maidens, some old some younger,
Who all have got sweethearts, but I must sla^ longer,
Some sixteen, some eighteen, are happily married.
A^as how unequally such things are carried:
A limner, a penman, a tinker, a tailor,
A fiddler, a pedlar, a ploughman, a sailor.
Come gentle, come simple, come foolish come witty,
Come don't let me die a maid, take me out of pity
I have a sister Sally, who is younger than I am,
Has so many sweetheart's she is forced to deny them.
I never was guilty of denying many,
The lord knows my heart, I Would be thankful for any.
A limner, etc.

I have a sister Susan, though ugly ill shapen,
Before she was sixteen years old, she was taken,
Before she was eighteen a son and a daughter,
And I am six and thirty and never had an offer,
A limner, etc.

It has often been said, by my father and mother,
That going to one wedding makes, way for another;
If that be the case, I will go without bidding.
and let the world judge, if I don't want a wedding.
A limner, etc.

(...) never will scold, and I Will never be jealo^s,
My husband shall have money, to go the alehouse,
While he is there spending, I Will be at home saving,
And leave it to you all, if I an't worth the having.
A limner. etc.

SONG.
THE wealthy fool with gold in store,
Will still desire to grow richer,
Give me but these I ask to more,
My charming girl, my friend and pitcher,
My friend so rare, my girl so fair,
With such what mortal can be richer,
Give but these -- a fig for care.
With my sweet girl, my friend and pitcher.
From morning sun I Would never grieve,
To toil a hedger or a ditcher.
If that when I come home at eve.
I might enjoy my friend and pitcher,
My friend so rare, etc.

Though fortune ever shu^s my door,
I know not what can so bewi^ch her;
With all my heart -- can I be poor,
With my sweet girl, my friend, and pitc^^^
My friend so rare etc.

SONG.
LORD, what care I for mam, or dad?
Why let them scold and bellow?
For while I live. I Will love my lad,
He Is such a charming fellow.
The last fair day on yonder green,
The youth he danced so well o
So spruce a lad was never seen,
As my sweet ch^^^ (...) ^^llow.

SONG,
NO pastime, no sport can with ^u^^ing compare,
^et each lad and each lass then to the field repair.
While health, rosy health, with delight shall keep pace.
And prove there is no joys like the joys of the chase:
When the hor^'s sprightly notes calls the huntsman away,
Tantivy, tantivy, hark forward, huzza, huzza.
Let fashion and scandal, and cards share the time,
Of your fine London ladies who murder their prime;
Give me the delights that enliven this place,
While echo. re-echoed, gives joy to the chase.
Hark forward, tantivy, huzza.
Over mountain, over valley, with speed hasts away,
No longer our innocent past time delay;
Aurora to welcome with bright ^uddy face,
Let echo, re-ec hoed, give joy to the chase,
Hark forward, tentivy, huzza.
SONG
WHEN Jove was resolved to create the round earth,
He supoenaed the virtues di^^^^!
Young Bacchus then sat the gay chairman of ^^rth,
And the toast was wit, women, and wine.
The sentiment tickled the ear of each god;
Apollo he winked to the Nine;
And Venus gave Ma^s ^^o, a sly wanton nod,
When she drank to wit, women and wine.
Great Jove shook his sides, and the cup put round,
While Juno for once looked divine:
These blessings, says he, shall on earth now bound,
And the toast is, wit, women and wine.
These are joys, worthy Gods, which to mort^^^ are given,
Says Mo^^us: who will not repine?
For what is worth our notice, pray tell me Heaven,
If men have wit, women and wine.
This joke you will repent, I Will lay fifty to seven,
Such attractions no power can decline;
Great Jove, by yourself you will soon keep house in Heaven,
For you will follow wit, women and wine.
You Are right, says great Jove, let us hence t^ the Earth,
Men and Gods think variety fine;
Who would stay in the clouds, when good nature and mi^^h
Are below with wit, women, and wine?
SONG.
SIR Solomon Simons, when he did wed,
Blushed black as a crow; -- his fair lady did bl^sh light:
The clock struck twelve, they were both tucked in bed;
In the chimney -- a rush light,
A little farthing rosh light.
Sir Solomon gave his lady a nuge --
Cries he, "Lady Simons, here is vastly too much light:"
"Then Sir Solomon," says she, "do get up you cannot grudge,
And blow cut the rush light,
The little farthing rush light,
Fall, lal, lal, lal, la.
And blow cut the rush light."
Sir Solomon then, out of bed pops his toes,
And vastly he swore, and very much did curse light;
And then, to the chimney, Sir Solomon be goes
And he pufi'd at the rush light.
The little farthing rush light;
But poor Sir Solomon
Coud'nt blow out the rush light.
Lady Simons got out, in her night cap, so neat,
And over the carpet she did brush light;
And there she found Sir Solomon in a heat,
Puffing at the rush light;
The little farthing rush light
But neither of the two
Could blow out the rush light.
Sir Solomon and Lady, their breath quite gone,
^^^^g the belt in a rage, determined to crush light,
Half a asleep is his shirt, then up came John,
And he puffed at the rush light,
The little farthing rush light,
But none of the family
Could blow out the rush light.
Cook, Coachmen and maids, very near all in buff,
Come, and swore, in their lives, they never met with such light;
And each of the family by turns had a puff
At the little farthing rush light,
The cursed farthing rush light
But all that they could do
Could'nt blow out the rush light.
The watchman at last went by crying -- one!
Here, watchman come up, on you we might on worse light;
Then up came the watchman the business it was done,
For he turned down the Rush Light.
The little Farthing Rush Light;
So the business it was done,
For he turned down the Rush Light.
SONG.
DEAR Kathleen you no doubt,
Find sleep how very sweet it is.
^ogs bark, and cocks have crow'd out,
You never dreamt how late it is.
This morning gay,
I post away,
To have with you a bit of play,
On two legs rid
Along to bid,
Good Morrow to your night cap.
Last night a little boosy,
With whiskey, ale and cider,
I asked young Berry Blowzy,
To let me sit beside her.
Her anger rose,
And sour as floes,
The little gipsey cocked her nose
Yet here I Have rid
Along to bid
Good Morrow to your nightcap.
"Beneath the honey suckle,
"The daisy and the vi'let
Compose so sweet a truckle,
They Will tempt you sure to spoil it,
Sweet Sall and Bell
I Have pleased you well --
But hold I must'nt kiss and tell,
So here I Have rid
Along to bid
Good Morrow to your night cap.
SONG. DESCRIPTION OF A WOMAN,
WRITTEN BY A MAN,
A WOMAN is like to -- but stay --
What a woman is like who can say?
There Is no living with or without one --
Love bites like a fly,
Now an ear now an eye --
Buz, buz, always buzzing about one.
When she is tender and kind,
She is like to my mind,
(And Fanny was so, I remember.)
She Is like to -- Oh dear!
She Is as good very near
As a ripe molting peach in September,
If she laugh and she chat,
Play, joke, and all that,
And with smiles and good humor she meets
She Is like a rich dish,
Of ven'son and fish,
That cries from the table "come eat me."
But she will plague you, and vex you,
Distract and perplex you,
False hearted and ranging
Unsettled and changing,
What then do you think she like?
Like a sand? like a (...)
Like a wheel? like a (...)
Aye, like a clock that (...) at strike,
Her head's like the if (...) tell on,
Which nothing but monkies can dwell on;
Her heart's like a lemon so nice,
She carves for each love a slice:
In truth she is to me,
Like to wind, like the sea,
Whose raging will hearken to no man;
Like a mill,
Like a pill,
Like a fla^l,
Like a whale,
Like an ass,
Like a glass,
Whose image is constant to no man's
Like a flower,
Like a shower,
Like a fly,
Like a pie,
Like a pea,
Like a flea,
Like a thief,
Like in -- brief,
She Is like nothing on earth, but a woman:
SONG. DESCRIPTION OF A MAN.
WRITTEN BY A WOMAN.
A MAN, he is like to -- but stay,
To what he is unlike, who can say
And yet w^ can scarce do without him;
Love sets in his breast
Like a hen on her nest,
And his chickens are scratching about him.
When he is pleased I am squeezed,
When he is not I am teased,
And I never can tell where to find him;
He is like an old Horse,
Worth but little and cross,
And a woman is foolish to mind him.
If he chance to but smile,
And look pleasant awhile,
And come chattering round like a chicken --
He is like a gay la^k,
But a false hearted spark,
And his feathers are scarcely worth picking.
But when he is vexed,
Confused and perplexed,
Deceitful and vicious,
Base, false, and malicious,
He is like -- hard to speak myself --
He is like to -- alas!
Like a snake in the grafs,
He is then, only then, like himself.
His head's like a butcher's full shop,
Beef, mutton, and pork, or what not;
(...) heart's like a pail of old swil,
(...) the offal contributes to fill:
(...) to a wife,
(...) a case knife,
To cut up my cake or my cheese;
Like a saint when he is civil,
But if not, like the devil;
But will turn to whatever he please:
To a hog, to a dog,
To a hare, to a bear,
Whose cruelty yields to no man;
Like a mouse, like a goose,
Like a mule, like a fool,
Like a lane, like a vane,
Like a leaf. like -- in brief,
He Is like every thing else, but a Woman:
SONG.
SOME women take delight in dress,
And some in cards ^ake pleasure,
While others place their happiness
In heaping hoards of treasure,
In priva^e some delight to kiss,
Their hidden charms unfolding.
But they mistake their sovereign bliss,
There Is no such joy as scolding.
Each morn, as I open my eyes,
I soon disperse all silence,
Before my neighhors can arise,
They hear my clack a mile hence.
When at the board I take my s^a^
There Is one continued r^o^;
I cat, I scold, I scold, I cat,
My clack is never quie^:
Let it be flesh, or fowl, or fish,
Though of my own providing,
I stilsl find fault with every dish,
Still every servant chiding;
Too fat, too lean, too salt, too fresh,
I never can be suited,
But give a blast at every dish,
Baked, roasted, boiled or stewed.
Every night when I go to bed,
I surely fall a weeping,
For silence is the thing I dread,
I cannot scold when sleeping,
But then my pains to mitigate,
And drive away all sorrow,
Although to night may be too late,
I Will pay them off tomorrow.
SONG.
HOW imperfect is expression,
Some emotions to impart,
When we mean a soft confession,
And yet seek to hide the heart.
When our bosoms all complying,
With enruptur'd tumults swell,
And beat, what broken, falt'ring, dying
Language would, but cannot tell,
Deep confusion, rosy terror,
Quite expressive, paints my cheek;
Ask no more, behold your error,
Blushes eloquently speak;
What though silent is my anguish,
Or breadth'd only to the air:
^ark my eyes, and as they languish,
Read what yours have writ^en there,
O that you could once deceive me!
Once my soul's strong feelings view!
Love has naught more fond, believe me,
Friendship nothing half so true,
From you, I am wild, despairing:
With you, speechless, as I ^ouch,
This is all that bears declaring,
And perhaps, declares too much.
SONG.
FOR various purposes serves the fan,
As thus a decent blind,
Between the sticks to peep at man,
Nor yet betray our mind.
Each action has a meaning plain,
Resentment's in the snap:
A flirt expresses strong d^sdain,
Consent a gentle tap.
All passions will the fan disclose,
All modes of female art.
And to advantage sweetly shows
The hand if not the heart,
It Is folly's scepter, first designed
By love's capricious boy,
Who knows how lightly all mankind,
Are governed by a toy.
SONG.
JOLLY mortals fill your glasses,
Noble deeds are done by wine;
Scorn the nymph and all their graces,
Who'd for love or beauty pine?
Look within the bowl that is slowing,
And a thousand charms you will find.
More than Phillis has, though going
In a moment to be kind.
Alexander hated thinking,
Drank about at council board;
He subdued the world by drinking
More than by his conquering sword.
SONG.
FROM night till morn I take my gla^^
In hopes to forget my Chloe;
But as I take the pleasing draught,
She Is never the less before me,
Ah! no, no, no, wine cannot cure
The pain I endure for my Chloe.
To wine I flew to ease the pain
Her beauteou^ charms created;
But wine more firmly bound the chain,
And love would not be cheated.
Ah, no, etc.

SONG.
HARK! Echo! sweet Echo repeats the loud strain,
The shouting and hooting of chaste Dian's train;
Aurora smiles sweetly and comes on apace,
The hounds and the horn call us forth to the chase.
Blind Cupid is banished from these happy fields,
His quiver to Dian the wanton now yields;
She blunts all his arrows, his power destroys,
While the virgins all follow her innocent joys.
SONG.
LET a set of sober asses
Rail against the joys of drinking,
While water, tea,
And milk agree
To set cold brains a thinking.
Power and wealth,
Beauty, health,
Wit and mirth in wine are crowned,
Joys abound,
Pleasure's found,
Only where the glass goes round.
The ancient sects on happiness
All differed in opinion;
But wiser rules
Of modern schools
In wine fix her dominion.
Power and wealth, etc.

Wine gives the lover vigor,
Makes glow the cheek of beauty;
Makes poets write,
And soldiers fight,
And friendship do its duty.
Power and wealth, etc.

Wine was the only Helicon
Whence poets are long lived so;
'Twas no other main
Than brisk champaign,
Whence Venus was derived too.
Power and wealth, etc.

When Heaven in Pandara's box
All kind of ill had sent us,
In a merry mood
A bottle of good
Was cork'd up to content us.
Power and wealth, etc.

All virtues wine is nurse to,
Of every vice destroyer;
Gives dullards wit,
Makes just the cit,
Truth forces from the lawyer,
Power and wealth, etc.

Wine jest our joys a flowing,
Our care and sorrow drowning,
Who rails at the bowl,
Is a Turk in's soul,
And a christian never should own him,
Power and wealth, etc.

SONG.
A SAILOR's life, a life of woe,
He works now late, now early;
^ow up and down, now to and fro,
What then? he takes it cheerly.
Blessed with a smiling can of grog,
If duty call,
Stand, rise or fall,
To fate's last verge he will jog;
The cadge to weigh,
The sheets belay.
He does it with a wish;
To heave the led,
Or to cat head
The ponderous anchor-fish.
For while the grog goes round,
All sense of danger's drowned,
We despise i^ to a man:
We sing a little, and laugh a little,
And work a little, and swear a little,
And fiddle a little, and foot it a little,
And swig the flowing can.
If howling winds and roaring seas,
Give proof of coming danger,
We view the storm, our hearts at ease,
For Jack's to fear a stranger,
Blessed with the smiling grog we fly
Where now below
We headlong go,
Now rise on mountains high;
Spite of the gale,
We hand the sail,
Or take the needful reef;
Or man the deck.
Or clear some wreck,
To give the ship relief:
Though perils threat around,
All sense of danger drowned,
We despise it to a man;
We sing a little, etc.

But yet think not our case is hard,
Though storms at sea thus treat us!
For coming home, (a sweet reward!)
With smiles our sweethearts greet us.
Now too the friendly grog we quass
Our amorous toast,
Her we love most,
And gaily sing and laugh;
The sails we furl,
The for each girl,
The petticoat display;
The deck we clear,
Then three times cheer,
As we their charms survey;
And then the grog goes round,
All sense of danger drowned,
We despise it to a man.
We sing a little, etc.

SONG.
ATTENTION pray give, while of Hobbies I sing;
(...) each has his hobby from cobbler to king:
(...) some favorite hobby we all get a stride,
(...) when we'er once mounted full gallop we ride.
All on hobbies, all on hobbies, all on hobbies,
Gee up, gee O.

Some hobbies are restive and hard for to govern.
^en just like our wives, they are so cursedly stubborn;
^he hobbies of scolds are their husbands to teaze.
and the hobbies of Lawyers are plenty of fees,
All on hobbies, etc.

The beaux, those, sweet gentlmen's hobbies, good lack!
(...) to wear great large poultices tied round the neck;
and they think in the ton and the tippey they are dressed,
(...) they have breeches that reach from the ancles to chest.
All on hobbies, etc.

The hobbies of sailors when safe moored in port.
With their wives and their sweet hearts to toy and to sport,
W^^^ our ^^vy's comple^^^ ^^eir hobby (...) be
To show the whole world that America's free.
All on hobbies, etc.

The hobbies of soldiers, in time of great wa^
Are breaches and battles, with blood wounds (...) sears;
But in peace you will observe that quite different (...) trade is --
The hobbies of soldiers in peace, are the ladi^
All on hobbies, etc.

The Ladies, sweet creatures, yes, they no and then
Get astride of their hobbies, ay, just like (...) men;
With smiles and with simpers beguile us with eas^
And we gallop, trot, amble, even just as the please.
All on hobbies, etc.

The American's hobby has long since be^^ known;
No tyrant or king shall from them have a throne
Their States are united, and let it be said
Their hobby is WASHINGTON, Peace, an^ Free Trade.
All on hobbies, etc.

SONG.
WHEN fortune does frown,
I'lt never be cast down,
Repining wont alter my store:
For a good state of health
Is better than wealth:
And I Will be merry although I am poor.
The soldier delights
In blood, wars and sights,
The sailor too sails the seas over;
But this mind I am in,
I Will keep a full skin;
And I Will be merry although I am poor.
When the sailors drink wine,
Their lovers repine;
The miser is fond of his store;
Give the glutton his dish,
And I what I wish,
And I Will be merry although I am poor.
Let statesmen debate
On the affa^rs of the State;
Let moralists frown and look sour;
Let the world go as 'twill,
I Will drink to my fill;
And I Will be merry although I am poor.
Wine will discord assuage,
Enliven old age,
Make cheerful and gay at four score:
Give me a full glass,
A complying sweet lass,
And I Will be merry although I am poor.
Ye benevolent souls,
With full flowing bowls,
Who cheerfully add to the store;
Give me but one quart,
Just to comfort my heart,
And I Will be merry although I am poor,
And ye drunken sots,
Who call for your pots,
And ever are calling for more;
Only just let me drink,
And I Will make you all think,
That I Will be merry although I am poor,
Wine will its vot'ries save
From death and the grave;
When tipsy we fear death no more;
With a full glass in hand,
Firm as Atlas I Will stand;
And I Will be merry although I am poor.
SONG.
YE fair, possessed of every charm,
To captivate the will;
Whose smiles can rage inself disarm,
Whose frowns at once can kill,
Say. Will you deign the verse to hear,
Where flat^'ry bears no part;
An honest verse, that flows sincere,
And candid from the heart?
Great is your power; but, greater yet
Mankind it might engage:
If, as ye all can make a net,
Ye all could make a cage,
Each nymph a thousand hearts may take;
For who is to beauty blind?
But to what end a prisoner make,
Unless you have streng^h to bind!
Attend the council often told,
Too often told in vain,
Learn that best art, the art to hold,
And lock the lover's chain.
Gamesters to little purpose win,
Who lose again as fast:
Though beauty may the charm begin,
It Is sweetness makes it last.
SONG.
'TWAS near a thicket's calm retreat,
Under a poplar tree,
Maria chose her wretched seat,
To mourn her sorrows free;
Her lovely form was sweet to view,
As dawn at opening day,
But ah, she mourned, her love not true,
A^^ ^wept her care^ away.
The brook slowed gently at her feet,
In murmurs smooth along;
Her pipe, which once she tuned most sweet,
Had now forgot its song.
No more to charm the vale she tries;
For grief has filled her breast;
Those joys which once she used to prize --
But love has robbed her rest.
Poor hapless maid! who can behold
Thy sorrows so severe,
And hear thy love-lorn story told,
Without a falling tear:
Maria, luckless maid! adieu,
Thy sorrows soon must cease,
For Heaven will take a maid so true
To everlasting peace.
A much admired SONG.
A PLAGUE of those musty old lubbers,
Who tell us to fast and to think,
And patient fall in with life's rubbers,
With nothing but water to drink:
A cann of good stuff had they twigg'd it.
Would have set them for pleasure agog.
And spite of the rules.
The rules of the schools,
The old fools would have all of 'em swigg'd it,
And swore there was nothing like grog.
My father, when last I from Guinea
Returned with abundance of wealth
Cried -- Jack, never be such a ninny
To drink -- Says I -- here is father, your health.
^o l passed round the stuff -- soon he twigg'd it,
And it set the old codger agog,
And he swigg'd. and mother swigg'd,
And sister swigg'd and brother swigg'd,
And I swigg'd, and all of us swigg'd it,
And swore there was nothing like grog.
One day, when the Chaplain was preaching,
Behind him I curiously slunk,
And, while he our duty was teaching
And how we should never get drunk,
I tip'd him the stuff, and he twigg'd it,
Which soon set his reverence agog.
And he swigg^d, and Nick swigg'd,
And Ben swigg'd, and Dick swigg'd,
And I swigg'd, and all of us swigg'd it,
And swore there was nothing like grog.
Then trust me there is nothing like drinking
So pleasant on this side the grave;
It keeps the unhappy from thinking,
And makes even more valient the brave,
For me, from the moment I twigg'd it,
The good stuff has so set me agog,
Sick or well, late or early,
Wind foully or fairly,
I Have constantly swigg'd it,
And dam'me there is nothing like grog.
SONG.
RETURNING home, across the plain,
From market, the other day.
A sudden storm of wind and rain
Over took me by the way:
With speed I tript it over ground,
To find some kinder spot,
And from the st^rm a shelter found,
In Lubin's rural cot.
This swain had long possessed a flame,
But modestly concealed;
Nor 'till those favoring moments came,
His passion ever revealed:
Will you consent, sweet maid, cried he,
To share my humble lot;
Return, my love, and mistress be,
Of Lubin's rural cot.
He spoke so fair it pleased my mind,
I blushing, answered yes;
He swore he would be true and kind,
And sealed it with a kiss:
Next day the wedding ring was bought,
I all my fears forgot;
And blessed the d^y I shel^er sought,
In Lubin's rural cot.
FAIR KATE OF PORTSMOUTH.
FAIR Kate of Portsmouth loved a tar,
Ben Surf as kind a soul
^s ever braved the hottest war,
Or slung the flowing bowl,
^et, often he would heave a sigh, since fate,
^ad borne him far from lovely Kate.
For Ben in vain had often strove,
(Would parents but agree)
To wed fair Kate, his only love,
'Ere that he went to sea:
But, ah! in vain, fond hope was over,
^e sighed, then left his native shore.
^ne night as the mid-watch he kept.
A loose to love he gave,
^or while his ship-mates careless slept,
Plunged in a war'ry grave --
The conflict's over, sweet Kate' he cried,
Then sunk in peace, alas! and died.
Thus, hope is like the summer gale,
That Is transient as the wind,
Which reefs too soon soft pleasure's sail,
'Ere the wished port we find:
The tidings to fair Kate was brought,
Whose bosom was with anquish fraught,
And is my love no more?' she cried,
'Then peace adieu farewell,
This heart to his was ever allied,
And still it shall be true --
I feel my spirits wing its flight -- '
She spoke and sunk in endless night.
THE CAPTURED CREW.
NIGHT scarce her mantle had withdrew
And flowly ushered in the morn,
When bearing down, we 'spied in view,
The savage foe not far astern:
The stoutest trembled -- small our crew,
The victims of superior power:
Yet courage bade the drooping few
Wait calmly for the fatal hour.
Bold they approached -- a council's held,
Our men, with voice united, cry,
Rather than basely degn to yield,
'They'd meet their fate and boldly die:
The fight now raged -- from side to side
The thund 'rings cannons dreadful sound;
With purple stain the deck was died,
Which issued from each gaping wound.
Such havoc now stern death has made,
Vain our resistance -- naught could shield
Wounds and fatigue on valor preyed,
And wi^h reluctance did we yield;
But scarce our battered hull we quit,
Scarce from the sturdy wreck retire,
Ere up she blew, shamed to be bea^,
Shrouding her form in sheets of fire.
SONG.
THIS world is a stage,
On which mankind engage:
And each acts his part in a throng;
But all is confusion
Mere folly's delusion,
And nothing on earth but a song.
The parson so grave,
Says your souls he can save,
And teach the right way from the wrong,
After piously teaching,
And long winded preaching,
He fobs off his flock with a Song.
The Lawyer he scribbles
In qui^ks and in quibbles,
And moves his melifferous tongue;
'Twixt demur and vacation,
He Will raise expectation,
And sink your esta^e to a song.
The Doctor he fills
You with bol^s and pills,
In assurance that you shall live long:
But, believe me, it is true,
He Is guineas in view,
And his recipts are naught but a Song.
The Surgeon so bold,
His lancet does bold,
And fl^shes your bodies along;
Small wounds he enlarges.
To fill up his charges,
His art like the rest, is a song.
The Merchant is bent
On his fifty per cent,
To whom Ledger and Jouanal belong;
'Compt^ current in trading
And long bills of lading;
His balance will end in a song.
The Printer descerning
'Twixt ignorance and learning,
The diff^rence that truly belongs;
Yet sure, it is said,
That his logical head,
Is turned by a statesman or Song.
The School master rages,
For want of more wages,
And hurries his scholars along;
He teaches them morals,
And whips those that quarrels,
And silence all day is his Song.
The Farmer he brags
Of what crops he shall have.
Provided the season holds long;
But if drought comes on,
His hopes are all gone,
And his crops may be bought for a Song.
The soldier he prattles
Of sieges and battles,
And actions he never was among;
His preferment and merit,
Are like to his spirit,
And nothing on earth but a Song.
With powder and lace,
And a feminine face,
The fop he goes strutting along;
Just arrived from his travels,
Yet nothing unravels,
But just like a dance or a Song.
The surly old prude,
Complains you are rude,
Though for bliss she so secretly longs;
But t^ke her aside,
And you will manage her pride,
And her virtue bring down to a Song.
The silly Coquette,
Is all in a fret,
In the morning her toilet goes wrong;
All day long she passes,
Consulting her glasses,
And at night dies away like a Song.
I Have often been told,
The women will scold,
Their good-natured husbands among;
They Will work, and they will fret,
And they will scold, and they will sweat
And at night die away like a song.
Then let us be jolly,
Drive hence melancholy,
While we are good fellows among;
Let Us fill up our glasses,
Take life as i^ passes,
And each merry soul sing a Song.
SONG.
DISTRESS me with those tears no more;
One kiss my love, and then adieu;
The last boat destined for the shore
Waits, de^rest girl, alone for you.
Soon, soon, before the light winds borne,
Shall I be severed from your sight;
You, left the lonely hours to mourn,
And weep through many a stormy night.
When far along the restless deep,
In trim array the ship shall steer;
Your form remembrance still shall keep;
Your worth, affection still revere:
And with the distance from your eyes,
My love for you shall be increased,
As to the pole the needle lies,
And, farthest off, still varies least.
While round the bowl the cheerful crew
Shall sing of triumphs on the main,
My thought shall fondly turn to you,
Of you alone shall be my strain:
And we have bowed the leaguing foe,
Revengeful of my country's wrong,
Returning home my heart shall show,
No fiction graced my artless song.
SONG.
THOUGH prudence may press me,
And duty distress me,
against inclination, ah! what can they do?
No longer a rover,
His follies are over,
My heart, my fond heart says, my Henry is true.
The be thus as changing,
From sweet to sweet ranging,
(...) rose should he light on^ never wishes to stray;
With raptures possessing,
In one every blessing,
^ill torn from her bosom he flies far away,
SONG,
HOW happy the woman, whose charms
Gain sweet-hearts stuck all in a row
That if one should desert from her arms,
She still has two strings to her bow.
Should Thomas prove false -- could he rob
My heart of its quiet? Oh no --
For if Thomas is gone there is Bob:
I still have two strings to my bow.
Then it is not so common a thing
Can vex me, I Would have you to know!
Since I have two beaux to my string,
As well as two strings to my how.
SONG.
THE bright God of day, drew westwar^ away,
And the evening was charming and clear:
The swallow remains, nimbly sailing over the plains,
And the shadows like giants appear.
In a gay summer bower, when the violet's i^ the flower,
And zephyrs breathe ad^^^ around,
Loved Cella she sat playing on her spinnet,
And she charmed all the grove with the sound
The gay God of love flew over the grove,
By zephyrs conducted along,
As she touched on the string, he beat time will his wing,
And the echo repeated the song.
Rosy bowers, she sung, while the harmony rung
And the birds they all fluttering arrive:
The industrious bees, from the flowers on the trees,
G^ntly humm^d, with their sweets, to the hive.
Ye mortals beware how ye venture too ^ear,
Love doubly is armed to wound,
Your fate you may shun, but you're surely und^^e.
If you rashly approach near the sound,
SONG.
A BEAUTEOUS Sterling la te I saw,
On lovely Sylvia's hand;
To check its flight, around its leg,
She ties a silken band.
In vain it flut^ers to be gone:
Confinement is its lot:
In vain it strives to break the band,
But cannot untie the knot.
"Cease, cease, she cried, here you shall feed
"And in my bosom rest,"
No bird that ever winged the air,
Was half so much carest.
"If from my hand you should escape,
"You may perchance be shot:
"Then cease to peck it is all in vain;
"You cannot untie the knot."
The bird contented grows at length,
While Sylvia strokes his plumes,
Erects his little crest, and soon,
His former note resumes.
From what he would heard the fair one say,
These words by rote he got,
And often repeated, every day,
You cannot untie the knot.
One evening youthful Daman^at,
With his Sylvia by his side,
Reward my love, at last, said he,
Tomorrow be my BRIDE.
Her blushes in his favor rose,
Yet she consented not;
For ere she spoke the Sterling cried,
You cant't untie the knot.
SONG.
TRUST not man for he will deceive you
Treach'ry is his sole intent;
For he will court you, then he will leave you,
Poor, deluded! to lament.
Formed by nature to undo us,
They escape our utmost heed;
Oh! how bumble when they woo us,
But how proud, when they succeed.
So the Bird when once deluded,
By the fowler's artful snare:
Pines ont life, in cage secluded;
Fair ones, while you're young, beware!
SONG. PARODY ON THE ABOVE.
TRUST not Woman, she will beguile y^
All her smiles are formed by art:
First she will flatter then exile you,
Sighing with a broken heart!
Formed by nature to pursue us,
They outstrip the fleetest men; --
Ah! how sweet they bill and coo us,
But how proud they triumph then!
So the FISH the bait admiring,
On the d^^gler's fatal snare,
Gasps our life, in pangs expiring!
LOVERS, of the book beware!
SONG.
OH, Cupid forever,
I fear not thy quiver,
Nor do I regard thy brave bow;
Thine arrows cannot hit me,
Nor women our wit me,
I Am free from all sorrow and woe,
I Am free from, etc.

It Is true my sweet Nancy,
A while pleased my fancy;
But yet, she will cruelly frown,
If they will not use freedom,
Then quickly I Will leave them,
I Will leave them to l^ngu^sh alone.
I Will leave them, etc.

Had Nancy proved l^yal,
I should have had trial.
Of no other girl in my life;
I often times told her.
Which made her the bolder,
I purposed to make her my wife,
I purposed, etc.

But she being wanton,
Must needs go a ran^ng,
So easily hushed by heart's flame;
Yet bent on her pleasure,
I left a fair treasure,
I left her to folly and shame,
I left, etc.

That soft tender passion,
So much in the fashion,
Excited my wantoner's art --
Allurements of women,
So soft and so winning,
Yet never could conquer my heart,
Yet never, etc.

SONG.
HER mouth with a smile,
Devoid of all guile,
Half open to view;
Is the hud of the rose,
In the morning that blows,
Imperl'd with the dew.
More fragrant her breath
Than the flower scented heath,
At the dawning of day:
The hawthorn in bloom,
The lily's perfume,
Or the blossoms of May.
I NEVER WILL BE MARRIED.
WHEN I had scarcely told sixteen,
My flattering tell tale g^ass,
Told me there seldom could be seen
A b^ither bonnier lass;
Full twen^y lovers round me bowed,
But high my head I carrcire;ed,
And with a scornful air I vowed
I never would be married.
Young Harry warmly urged his suit,
And ta^k'd of wealth in store;
While Jenmy thought to strike me m^t^,
And ^old his conquests over:
Each youth a diff'^rent art essayed,
And still their arts I parried;
Believe me, Si^s, I laughing said,
I never will be married.
Then five revolving summers past,
White I the tyrant played;
Ah! then I feared 'twould be at last,
My fate to die a maid;
Of all the lovers in my train,
There was but one that tarried,
Thought 'twas time to change my strain,
And we this morn were married.
POOR TOM, OR THE SAILOR's EPITAPH.
HERE a sheer hulk, lies Poor Tom Bowl^
The darling of our crew,
No more he will hear the tempest howling,
For death has broached him too.
His form was of he manifest beauty,
His heart was kind and soft,
Faithful below he did his duty,
And now he is gone aloft.
Tom never from his word departed,
His virtues were so rare.
His friends were many, and true hearted,
His Poll was kind and fa^r:
And then he would sing so b^ithe and jolly,
And many's the time and ^f^^!
But mirth is turned to melancholy,
For Tom is gone aloft.
Yet shall poor Tom find pleasant weather,
When he who all commands,
Shall give, to call life's crew together,
The word to pipe all hands,
Thus death who kings and ^ars dispatches,
In vain Tom's life has ^^ff'd,
For though his body's under hatches,
His soul is gone aloft.
SONG.
WELCOME, welcome, brother debtor,
To this poor but merry place,
Where no bailiff, dun, or se^er,
Da^e ^o show hia frightful face,
But kind Sir, as you're a stranger,
Down your garnish you must lay,
Or your coat will be in danger:
You must either strip or pay.
Never repine at your confinement
From your children or your wife:
Wisdom lies in true refinemet,
Through the various scenes of life.
Scorn to show the least resentment.
Though beneath the frowns of fate:
Knaver and beggars find contentment.
Foa^s and cares attend the great.
Though our creditor are spiteful;
And restraint our bodies here,
Use will make a goal delightful,
Since there is nothing else to fear.
Every island's but a prison,
Strongly guarded by the sea:
Kings and princes, for that reason,
Prisoners are as well as we.
What was it made great Alexander.
Weep at his unfriendly fate?
'Twas because he could not warder
Beyond the world's strong prison gate.
The world itself is strongly bounded
By the heavens and stars above:
Why should we then be confounded,
Since there is nothing free but love?
SONG.
SWEET Nightingale, best poet of the grove
The plaintive strain can never belong to thee,
Blessed with the full possession of thy love,
O, lend that strain sweet Nightingale to me.
It Is mine alas, to mourn my wretched fate,
I love a maid, who all my bosom charms;
Yet spend my days without this lovely mate,
Inhuman fortune keeps her from my arms.
You happy birds by nature's simple laws,
Lead your soft lives sustained by natu^e's care,
You dwell wherever your roving fancy d^aws,
Your lovely songs enliven all the air. --
But we vain slaves of interest and of pride,
Dare not be blessed lest envious tongues should blame,
Hence, it is in vain, I languish for my bride,
Come mourn with me sweet birds, my helpless flame.
BETSEY BLOSSOM.
No more I Will court the town bred fair,
Who shines in artificial beauty;
Her native charms without compare,
Claim all my love respect and duty.
Oh! my bonny, bonny Bet, sweet Blossom,
Was I a king so proud to wear thee,
From off the verdant couch I Would bear thee,
To grace thy faithful lover's bosom.
Yet ask me where those beauties lie,
I cannot say in smile or dimple;
^n blooming cheek or radient eye,
It Is happy nature wild and simple.
Oh! my bonny Bet etc.

Let dainty beaux for ladies pine,
And sigh in numbers trite and common:
Ye gods! one darling wish be mine,
And all I ask is lovely woman.
Oh! my bonny Bet. etc.

Come dearest girl, the rosy bowl,
Like thy bright eye, with pleasure dancing;
My heaven art thou, so take my soul,
With rapture every sense entrancing,
Oh! my bonny Bet, etc.

ON BRANDY AND BEER.
When one's drunk not a girl but looks pretty,
The country's as gay as the city;
And all that one says is so witty.
A blessing on brandy and beer,
Bring the cup,
Fill it up,
Take a sup,
Take a sup,
And let not a flnicher come near,
And let not a flincher come near,
Oh give me but plenty of liquor,
I Would laugh at the 'squire and he vicar,
And if I Would a wife, why I Would kick her,
If ever she pretended to sneer.
Bring the cup, etc.

Though I know it is a heavy disaster,
Yet I mind not the rage of my master,
He bullies, and I d^ink the faster,
A blessing on brandy and beer.
Bring the cup, etc.

When a cherry chee'k maid I Have an eye on,
I do many things she cries, fie on;
Egod, I Am as bo^d as a lion,
A blessing on brandy and beer.
Bring the cup, etc.

POT OF BROWN ALE.
Roving about, good fellows to meet,
I met with a man upon Sal'sbury dale:
I saw by his fa^e that he was in good case
To go and shake hands with a pot of good ale
The beggar who begs with at any legs,
And his not a rag to cover h^^ (...),
Is as happy in rags a the miser with bags.
If once she shakes hands with a pos of good ale.
The old parish vicar, when he is in his liquor,
Does m^rrily a^ his parishioners ^ail
"Come pay all your ty^^^s, or I Will kiss all your wives,"
When once she shakes hands with a pot good ale.
The old parish clerk, his eyes are so dark,
He cannot well read the print is so small:
But he will see every letter, and sing the psalms better,
If once he shakes hands with a pot of good ale.
The farmer who hedges and dirch^s all day.
And w^aries himself out a^ the ^lough tale,
He Will talk of great things, about princes and kings,
When once he s^s down to a pot of good ale.
If, in drinking about, we chance to fell out,
Or an^ thing else does our senses assul:
If word come to blows, or a sharp bloody nose.
We'll drink and shake hands with a pot of good ale.
BRIGHT PHOEBUS.
BRIGHT Phoebus has mounted the chariot o^ day.
And the ho^ns and the hounds call each sportsman away;
Through woods and through meadows, with speed now they bound,
While health, rosy health, is in exercise found;
Hark away! Hark away! Hark away ^^th.
word to the sound of the horn,
And echo, blithe echo. makes jovial the morn.
Each hill and each valley is lovely to view,
While Puss flies the covert, and dogs quick pursue.
Behold where she flies ^'er the wide spreading plain!
While the loud opening pack pursue her amain.
Hark away, etc.

At length puss is caught, and lies panting for breath,
And the shout of the huntsman's the signal of death.
No joys can delight like sports of the field;
To hunting all pastpines and pleasures must yield.
Hark away, etc.

SONG.
YE Youths, wheresoever ye wander so free,
I pray give attention and listen to me,
For truly my case is dist^essing and hard,
^f none of your sex will my counsel regard;
If you wish for a wife,
To be happy for life,
Here Is one that will sell you a heart for a heart;
Come, come prithee buy,
Or else I shall die.
O pity a maiden, and pr^y take her part,
Ah do -- ah do --
O pity a maiden, and pray take her part.
^ull seventeen summers have now rolled along,
And still I Am unmarried a little too long!
But, since I have waited the time I have said,
I Will tell you the husband I now wish to wed;
Good sense I must find,
In the youth to my mind,
Not a fop or a coxcomb can ever touch my heart;
No, no -- he must be
Good tempered and free --
O, p^^y a maid^n pray take her part.
Ah do, etc.

Should you turn in your minds now a virgin's advice,
I charge you, ye batchelors, don't be too ^ice;
Though for virtue and so forth I may stard the test,
O, you will find me no more than a woman at best!
Indeed it is true,
So mind what you do,
'Ere you dare for the temple of Hymen to start,
But should you incline,
Hand a^^ heart to entwine,
O pity a maiden (...) take her part.
Ah d^, (...)

SUCH a Tom-boy before I had entered my teens.
In spite of my granny was I,
From my sempler, and d^ll, and such babyish scenes,
For a good game at romps I would fly;
Though she dodg'd me, and watched me, defied and besought,
To quiet my rogue of a heart,
My legs were too light for my grandmother's thoughts,
When my youth was a match for her art --
When she found her experience was thus overreach'd,
She Would exclaim in a rage, sure the girl is bewitched.
She lectur'd me next when my frock said aside,
And bid me beware of the men,
But such lectures she knew I could never abide,
So I ^old her again and again:
Nay, often in the midst, I'^ ^^eak from her and laugh,
At such prudish dull (...) and stuff;
She always for me was (...) half,
So I Would leave her alone (...)
When she found that to (...) ^ain she preached,
She Would exclaim, in a rage, (...) bewitched.
'Till I met with a lad whose face an^ (...)
With a thousand nice pleasantries moved;
Who told a long tale, I scarce knew about what,
Except 'twas ^o say that he loved;
Nor even from him no long speeches I Would hear,
Though I loved him as dear as my life;
Now we ro^p, dance and frolic each day of the year,
He Is as mad and as gay as his wife!
Now my granny may frown, since in vain she has preached,
And the world if it pleases, may thing us bewitched.
THE NEGLECTED FAIR.
OF Columbias boast the praise be mine;
What Is that but American beauty?
With rapture I Would invoke the nine,
Ye men, learn hence your duty:
The sex were blessings all designed,
With rapture hen enjoy them;
Nor so debase a female mind,
To conquer the^ destroy hem;
Then, O protect Columbia's fair,
Be mindful of your duty;
May vengeance never the villain spare,
A foe to love and beauty.
That tender form you first seduced,
Why is it now neglected?
Behold her sad, my grief reduced,
Pale, meagre, and d^jected!
Behold her begging with a sigh,
Behold her disregarded!
Then view the anguish in her eye!
And say, is love rewarded?
Then, O protect, etc.

Each female heart is free from guile,
'Till crafty men infect it;
With artful tale, or magic wile,
He wins and then neglects it:
Her pining soul fi^ds no relief.
Sad tears flow fast and melt her;
Her over fraught bosom boasts with grief,
And in the grave finds shelter!
Then, O protect, etc.

When fortune frowns and friends forsake,
Still lovely woman cheers us;
Our grief or raptures they partake,
D^stresses but endear us:
While man's professions all will fly,
Nor dying will abet you,
But meet your corpse as passing by,
And with a sigh forget you.
Then O protect, etc.

While round your bed the mourning fair
Hangs like a drooping willow,
Each p^ng or sigh stili anxious share,
Nor leave your woe worn pillow! --
Then charge your glasses to the fair,
May beauty ne'e^ be slighted --
That source of ^liss, by whom we are
Conceived b^ought forth d^lighted.
Then, O protect, etc.

POOR JACK.
GO, patter to lubbers and swabs, do you see,
'Bout danger, and fear, and the like;
(...) tight water boat, and good sea room give me,
And t'ent to a little I Will strike.
Though the tempest top gallant masts smack smooth should smite,
And shiver each splinter of wood,
Clear the wreck, stow the yards, and bowse every thing right,
And under reef'd foresail we'll s^ud.
Avast, nor don't think me a milk fop so soft,
To be taken for trifles aback;
For they say there is a providence sits up aloft,
To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.
Why, I heard our good chaplain palaver one day,
About souls, heaven, mercy and such;
And, my timbers, what lingo he would coil and delay!
Why, 'twas just all as one as High Dutch.
But he said how a sparrow cannot founder, do you see,
Without orders that comes down below,
And many fine things that proved clearly to me
That providence takes us in tow.
For says he, do you mind me, let storms ever so often
Take the top sails of sailors aback:
There Is a sweet little cherub that fits up aloft,
To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.
I said to our Poll, (for, do you see, she would
When last we weighed anchor for sea,
What argufies sniv'ling, and piping your (...)
Why, what a damned fool you must be!
Cannot you see the world's wide, and there is (...) for us all,
Both for seamen and lubbers ashore;
And if to Old Davy I should go, friend Poll
Why you never will hear of me more.
What the? all is a hazard -- ^om^ (...) be so s^
Perhaps I may laughing come back?
For dye see, there is a^cherub s^^ smiling aloft,
To keep watch for the life of poor Jack.
Do You mind me, a sailor should be every inch
All as one as a piece of his ship;
And with her brave the world, without off'^^ to flinch,
From the moment the anchor's a trip.
As for me, in all weathers, all times, sides (...) ends,
Nought's a trouble my duty elates;
For my heart is my Poll^s, and my rino,s (...) friends;
And, as for my life, it is the State's.
Even when my time comes, ne,er believe me (...)
As with grief to be taken aback;
That same little cherub that sits up aloft,
Will look out a good birth for poor Jack.
SONG.
THAT once was a ploughman, a sailor am now,
No lark that is aloft in the sky,
Ever flu^tered its wings to give speed to the plough,
Was so gay and so careless as I,
But my friend was a Carsindo on beard a king's ship,
And he axed me to go to sea for a trip;
And he talked of such things,
As if sailors were kings:
And so teazing did keep,
That I left my poor plough to go plough in the deep;
Where so sweetly the horn,
Called me up in the morn,
Ere I trusted to the Carfindo or the inconstant wind.
That made me for to go and leave my dear behind.
When so sweetly the horn, etc.

I did not much like to be on board a ship,
When in danger there is no door to creep out;
I liked the jolly tars, I liked bumbo and slip,
But I di^'t like rocking about.
By and by came a hurricane, I did^'t like that,
Next a battle that many a sailor la^d flat;
Ah! Why did I roam,
When so happy at home?
I could sow, and could reap,
Ere I left my poor plough, to ploughing the deep,
Where so sweetly the born, etc.

At length safe I landed, and in whole skin,
Nor did I make any long stay,
Ere I found by a friend who I ax'd for my kin,
Father dead, and my wife run away,
Ah! who but thyself, cried I, have thou to blame,
Wives loosing their husbands often loose a good name.
Ah! Why I roam,
When so happy at home?
I could sow, and could reap,
Ere I left my poor plough, and went ploughing the deep.
Where so sweetly the horn, etc.

Why if that be the case said this very same friend,
And you be'nt no more minded to roam;
Gi's a shake by your fist, all your care's at an end,
Dad's alive and your wife's safe at home:
Stark stairing with joy, I leaped out my skin,
Buss'd my Wife, Mother, Sister, and all of my kin;
Ah! cried I, let them roam,
Who want a good home;
I am well, so I Will keep,
Nor again leave my plough, to go ploughthe deep:
Once more shall the horn, call me np in the morn, etc.

SONG.
BEHOLD this fair goblet -- 'twas carved from the tree,
which, oh! my sweet Shakespeare, was planted by thee:
^^relick I kiss it, and how at thy shrine,
that comes from thy hand must be ever divine,
All shall yield to the mulberry tree:
Bend to thee,
Blessed mulberry!
Matchless was he
That planted thee,
And thou like him immortal shall be.
^e trees of the forest, so rampart and high,
^ho spread round your branches, whose heads sweep the sky;
^e curious exotics, whom taste has brought here,
^o root out the nativ^s at prices so dear;
All shall yield, etc.

^^e oak is held royal in Britain's great boast,
^^eserv'd on^^, our king, and will always our coast;
^f these, Sir we make ships -- there are thousands that fight,
^^t one, only one, like our Shakespeare can write,
All shall yield. etc.

^et Venus delight in her gay myrtle bower's,
^^n^na in fruit trees, and Flora in flower's.
^he ga^den of Shakespeare all pleasures will suit,
With the sweetest of flowers and the fairest fruit.
All shall yield etc.

With learning and knowledge the well-letter birch
Supplies law and physic, and grace for the church
But law and the gospel in Shakespeare we fin^
He gives the best physic for body and mind.
All shall yield. etc.

The fame of the patron gives fame to the tree;
From him and his merits this ^akes its degree:
Give Phoebus and Bacchus their laurel and vine^
The tree of our Shakespeare is still more divine
All shall yield etc.

As the genius of Shakespeare out shines the bright day,
More rapture than wine to the heart can convey
So the tree which he planted, by making (...) own,
Has the laurel and bay, and the vine all in one.
All shall yield, etc.

Then each take a relick of ^his hallowed tree,
From folly and fashion a charm let it be;
Let Us fill to the planter the cup to the brim,
To honor your country, do honor to him.
All shall yield, etc.

SONG.
DEAR TOM this brown jug which foams with mild ale.
In which we will ^oast the sweet Nan of the vale.
Was once Tobby Fillpo^ a thirsty old soul
As ever d^ank a bottle or fathomed a bowl:
In Baccus's court 'twas his joy to excel,
And among jolly topers he bore off ^he bell.
It chan^'d (...) in dog days he loll^d at his ease,
In a flower-woven arbor as ga^^^s you please;
With his friend and his pipe puffing sorrow away,
And with royal old stingo was soaking his clay,
His breath door of life on a sudden was shut,
And he died full as big as a Dorce^shire butt.
His body when long in the ground it had ^ain,
And time into clay h^^ desolv'd it again!
A potter found o^t in its covert so snug,
And with part of old Toby he formed this brown jug:
Now sacred to friendship ^o mi^^h and mild ale,
Here Is a health to my lovely sweet N^n of the Vale.
SONG.
SAY, Have you seen my Arabell?
The Caledonian m^id,
Or heard the you^hs of Scotland tell,
Where Arab^ll has strayed?
The damsel is of angel m^^n,
With sad and downcast eyes;
The shepherds call her, sorrow's queen,
So pensively she sighs.
But why her sighs so sadly swell,
Or why her tears so flow;
In vain, they press the lovely girl,
The innate cause to know.
E're reason am'd her tender mind,
The virgin learned to love,
Compassion taught he kind,
Deceit she was above.
And had not War's terrific voice,
Forbid the mutual bands,
E're now, had Sandy been her choice,
And Hymen joined our hands:
But, since the sword of war is sheathed,
And peace resumes her charms,
My every joy is now bequeathed
To Arabella's arms.
SONG.
AS musing I ranged in the meas all alone,
A beautiful creature was making her moan,
The tears they were fal^^ng full fast from her eyes,
She pierced the air and my heart with her cries.
^^ gently requested ^he cause of her moan,
She told me her sweet S^^^cino was go^e;
And in that sad posture she ever would remain,
Unless her dear charmer returned home again.
Perhaps it is some linnet, or blackbird, said I;
Perhaps it is the lark that has soared in the sky:
Come, dry up your tears, and abandon your grief,
I Will bring you another that shall give you relief.
It'sno blackbird, nor linnit, nor sky lark, said she,
But one that is fairer by far, th^n all three,
My sweet Senecino, for whom I now cry,
^^'s sweeter than all the gay songsters that fly.
Adieu to Prunella, Corinna, likewise,
Whom stars, and whom planets extol to the skies;
Adieu! to ^he Opera, farewell to the ball!
My charmer has gone, and a fig for you all.
SONG.
WHEN up to London first I came,
An awkward country booby,
I gaped and star'd and bid the same
As every other boody.
With countenance demurely set,
I doff^d my hat to all I met,
With -- 'Zir, your humble servant!
Alas! too soon I got a wife:
And, proud of such a blessing,
The joy and business of my life
Was kissing and caressing.
'Twas -- 'charmer! sweeting! duck and dove!"
And I, over head and ears in love,
Was Cupid's humble servant.
But when the honey-moon was past,
Adieu to tender speeches!
Ma'am loved quadrille, and lost too fast,
I swore I Would wear the breeches.
I storm in vain, -- restraint she hates:
Adieu, she cries -- the party waits; --
My dear, your humble servant!
SONG.
ON that lone bank where Lubin died,
Fair Rosalie, a wreched maid,
Sat weeping over the cruel tide.
Faithful to her Lubin's shade.
Oh! may some kind, some gentle wave,
Waft him to this mournful shore;
These tender hands should make his grave,
And deck his corpse with flowers over.
I Would ever watch his mouldering clay,
And pray for his e^ernal rest;
When time his form has worn away,
His dust I Would place within my breast.
While thus she mourned her Lubin lost,
And echo to her grief replied;
Lo! at her feet his corpse was tossed,
She shrieked -- she clasped him -- sighed, and died.
SGNG.
THE sails unfurled, the ship unmoor'd,
Her course to steer -- all hands on board,
Propitious every gale;
Fair Sally on ^he beach deplores,
Her sailor bound to distant shores,
But naught her tears avail.
"Oh! cruel fate -- ye powe'rs above,
"Why thus besret of him I love!
"Who on the restless deep,
"The boisterous tide must ceaseless brave,
"And meet, per chance, a wat,ry grave,
While I but live to weep."
Twelve months elapsed when he returned,
Her constant heart with rapture burned,
'Twas freed from ev^ry ca^e;
And Henry's love, his heart, his soul,
Were true, as needle to the pole.
When absent from his fair.
In wedded bliss they taste delight,
No winds disturb, nor storms affright
The lovely Sally's breast;
For now he makes a firm decree,
No more to trust the raging sea --
With her completely blessed.
SONG.
ADIEU ye streams that gently flowing,
Murmur through the flowery mead;
Vernal airs that softly blowing,
Rustle through the leafy shade!
Adieu, ye birds whose notes delighting,
Sweetly charm the rural scene;
Beauteous prospects all inviting,
Fields and meadows decked with green!
I could quit you unrepining,
Not a tear should bathe my eye,
Your enjoyments all resigning,
Nor my bosom heave a sigh.
But when cruel fat^ ordains me
From my lovely fair to part;
Oh! the separation pains me!
Deeply wounds my aching heart.
Falsehood and deceit despising,
O sh^'s fairer than the morn!
When bright Phoebus just rising,
Strews with pearl the dewy lawn.
But her mind in charms surpasses,
Spotless as the solar ray:
While a thousand nameless graces
All around my fair one play.
When with her the sweet enjoyment
Crowns the day with fresh delight;
To chat with her the sweet employment
Gilds with joy the gloomy night.
But by fate compelled to leave her,
From my Julia forced to part;
Oh! the cruel world "forever,"
Wounds afresh my bleeding heart!
SONG.
THE eve her silver vestment wore:
And closed the sultry day,
^e co^agers their toil forebore.
And homeword bent their way;
^^ve one poo^ maid, who all forlorn,
The tear of sorrow shed,
^^ek as the primrose 'neath the thorn,
That rears its modest head.
It Was lovely Marian that sighed,
And mourned her sorrows free;
Since fa^e young Sandy's love denied,
And sent him far to sea;
Wide over the billows doomed to roam,
He fled her longing arms,
And left his friends and native home,
To brave rude war's alarms.
Now three long months were gone and over,
When, ah! one fatal day,
As musing a her cottage door,
A sai^or bent his way --
'Twas Sandy's friend who sought the fair,
Sad ^idings to relate;
For grief of heart, joined with despair,
Had closed his hapless face.
Yet, 'ere he died, her bliss he planned,
For all his little wealth,
He fondly left, with lavish hand,
To Marian herself:
But what availed the golden store.
Sweet peace her bosom fled:
He Is gone, she cried, for evermore.
Then sighing joined the dead.
ABSENCE.
ALAS! they have torn my love away,
To range a foreign pa^^;
May heaven p^eserve him night and day
And cheer his fai^^ful hear^:
But mine, alas! no joy can find,
Though jocund swains appear,
In vain they strive to ease my mind,
For Henry is not there.
How often beside the purling stream,
And often in the grove,
When sh^lter'd from ^he sultry beam,
He told his tender love;
Ah! then my heart was fr^e from pain,
A stranger to ^ll are;
But now all joy d^serts the plain,
For Henry is not there.
Though absent from my charming youth,
My love i^ still the same:
May ^e return with equal truth,
An^ never love again;
The ^h p^y in my rural cot,
I Will ban^sh every fear.
Conten^^d ^^^h my humble lot,
If Henry is but there.
VICAR AND MOSES.
HERE was once, it was said, when, is out of my head,
and where too; yet true is my tale.
^t a round bellied vicar, bepimp^ed with liquor,
Could sti^k to no tex like good ale.
Tol de roll, de roll. lol lol lol lol.
^one right 'g^n ^o dose; for, under the rose,
The pa^so^ wa^ th^n non se ipse:
(...) se ipse! -- you^l^ say, What Is tha^ to the lay?
In plain English, the pa^son was u^sy,
(...) clerk, ^st p^ing in w^^h a band bebbin chin,
As solemn and ^upid as may be;
^e vica he ga^'d; the clerk h^mm^d and scraped,
Saying, peace, Sir, to bury a baby,
^^w our author supposes, the clerk's name was Moses,
He look^d, like his m^ster, so rosy;
^ho b^ink'd with o e eye, with h^s wig all awry,
And hiccu^d -- pray h^ w^^ it M^sy?
^hild, Sir, in carry*d, by you to be buried --
Bury me, Moses! no, that will not do. --
lord, Sir! said the clerk, you are all in the dark;
It Is a child to be bu y'd, not you.
Well, Moses, don't hurry; the infant we'll bu y. --
B^^, master, the corpse cannot stay. --
^ell, cannot it! bu^ why? for once, then we'll try
If a corpse, Moses, can run away.
But Moses replied: -- Sir the parish will chid^
'For keeping them out in cold weather. --
Then Moses, quoth he, go and tell them from
I Will bury them warm all together.
But, Sir, it rains hard; pray have some regard.
R^gard, Moses! that makes m^ stay:
For no c^rpse, young or old, in rain can ca^ cold;
But, faith, Moses, you and I may.
Moses begged he would be gone, saying, Sir, the rain's done;
Please to rise, and I Will lend you my hand. --
Oh! it is hard, quoth the vicar, to leave thus my liquor,
And go where I Am sure I cannot stand.
Then the parson sore troubled, to the church yar^ he hobbled,
Lamenting the length of the way;
For, Moses, quoth he, were I a bishop, do you see,
I neither need walk, preach nor pray.
When he came to the grave, says he -- Moses, (...) stave.
Lord! where is my tobacco box hid?
I declare this fast walking prevents me from talking;
So, Moses, pray give me a quid.
Then he opened the book, and in it seemed to look:
But over the page only he squinted: --
^^ys he, Moses, I Am vexed, for I cannot find the text.
The book is so damnably printed.
^ood people, let us pray, Life's, alas! but a day;
Nay, sometimes it is over at noon;
^an is but a flower, cut down in an hour:
It Is strong ale, Mosy, does it so soen.
Woman of a man born -- no, that is wrong, the leaf's torn?
Upon woman the natural swell is;
The world would grow wild, were men got with child:
Moses, you and I might have big bellies!
Neighbors, mind what I say, when it is night *it is not day,
Though in former times saints could work wonders;
For, cut off your head, in a trice, it is said,
They Would replace it without any blunders.
Come, let us go forth; put the child in the earth;
Dust to dust, Moses, dust is away;
For Moses, I trust we all should be dust,
If we was not to moisten our clay.
So one pot, and then -- the clerk said, Amen,
And thus we have carried the farce on.
The taste of the times will relish our rhimes,
When the ridicule runs on a parson.
Then, Satire, detest Immortality's j^st,
Each profane or immod^st ^xpr^ssion:
But we'll not be rude, (...) drink, as we should
To the good folks of every profession.

SONG.
GALLANTS attend, and hear a friend,
Trill (...) harmonious di^ty:
^^^^nge things I Will tel^, which late befell
In Philadelphia city.
'Twas early day, as poets say,
Just when the ^u^ was rising,
A so^dier ^o^d, on l^g of wood,
And saw a sight su^prising.
A^ in a maze, he stood to gaze,
The tr^th cannot be denied, sir
He spied a (...) -- of kegs or more,
Come floating down the tide, sir.
A sailor too, in j^^kin blue,
The strange appearance viewing,
F^^st d^mn'd ^is eyes, in great surprise,
Then said -- some mischief's brewing.
These Ke^s now hold the rebels bold,
Packed (...) like ^ick^d her^ing:
And they are come down t'attack the town,
In this new way of ferrying.
The soldie^ fl^w, the sailor too,
And' scared almost to death, sir,
Wore out their shoes, ^o spread the news,
And ran till out of breath, sir.
Now up and down, throughout the town,
Most frantic scenes were acted;
And some ran here, and some ran there
Like men almost distracted.
Some fire cried, which some denied,
But said the earth had quaked:
And girls and boys, with hideous noise,
Ran through the town half naked.
Sir William he, snug as a flea,
Lay all this time a snoring,
Nor dreamt of harm, as he lay warm
In bed with Mrs. L -- g.
Now in affright, he starts upright,
Awaked by such a clatter:
He rubs both eyes, and boldly cries,
"For God's sake what is the matter?"
At his bed side, he then espied
Sir Erskine at command, sir,
Upon one foot he had one boot,
And the other in his hand, sir.
Arise! Arise! Sir Erskine cries
The rebels -- more's the pity --
Without a boat are all on float,
And ranged before the city.
The motly crew, in vessels new,
With Satan for their guide, sir,
Packed up in bags, or wooden KEGS,
Come ^riving down the tide, sir.
^^^refore prepare for bloody war;
These KEGS must all be routed:
surely we despised shall be;
And British courage doubled.
^he royal band now ready stand,
All ranged in dread array, sir,
With stomach stout, to see it out,
And make a bloody day, sir.
The cannons roar, from shore to shore:
The small arms make a rattle:
Since wars began, I Am sure no man
Ever saw so strange a battle.
The rebel vales, the rebel dales.
With rebel trees surrounded,
The distant woods, the hills, and floods,
With rebel echoes sounded.
The fish below swam to and fro,
Attacked from every quarter:
Why sure, thought they, the devil's to pay,
Amongst folks above the water.
The KEGS, it is said, though strongly made,
Of rebel staves and hoops, sir,
Could not oppose their powerful foes,
The conquering British troops, sir.
From morn to night these men of might
Displayed amazing courage;
And when ^he sun was faily down,
Re^ir'd to sup their porridge.
An hundred men, with each a pen,
Or more, upon my word, sir,
It is most true, would be too few
Their valor to record, sir.
Such feats did they perform that day,
Upon these wecked KEGS sir;
That ^ear, to come if they get home,
They Will make then boasts and brags, sir.
TALLY HO.
AT the sound of the horn,
W^ rise in the morn,
And waken the woods as we thunder along:
Y^IX, yoix, Tally h^!
After Reynard we go.
While echo on echo redoubles the song:
We waken the woods as we thunder along.
^al^y ho! tally h^!
After Reynard we go,
While echo on echo redoubles the song.
Not ^h stee^s of ^he sun
Our b^ave courses outrun,
Over the mound horse and hound see us bound in full cry,
Like Phoeous we rife,
To the neights of the skies,
And, careless of d^nger five bars we defy.
We waken the woods etc.

At eve, Sir, we rush,
And are close to his brush;
Already he dies, see him panting for breath:
Each feat and defeat,
We renew and repeat,
Regardless of life, so we are in at the death.
We waken the woods, etc.

With a bottle at night,
We prolong the d^light;
Much trimbush we praise, and the deeds that were done:
And yoix, tally ho!
The next morning we go
Wi^h Phoebus to end, as we mount with the sun.
We waken the woods, etc.

THE LARK.
GO tuneful bird, that glads the skies,
To Daphne's window speed thy way,
And there on quivering pinions rise,
And there thy vocal art dispay.
And if she deign thy notes to hear,
And if she prase ^hy maun song;
Tell her the sounds that sooth her ear,
To Damon's native plaints belong.
Tell her, in livelier plumes arrayed,
The b^d from India groves may shine,
But ask the lovely, partial maid,
What are his notes, compared to thine?
Then had her t^eat y^n witless beau,
And all his ^fl^un^^g race, with scorn,
And lend an ear to Damon's woe,
Who sings her praise, and sings forlorn
PRIMROSES.
WHEN spring returning decks the grown
In glittering array,
And birds elated chaunt their loves
while mounted on the spray:
Then to the field, with eager haste
To cull the flowers I hie,
And, with my basket to my waist,
I trudge along and cry,
Two bunches a penny Primroses
Two bunches a penny.
And often as through the streets I walk,
In hopes to sell my ware,
The powdered beaus will deign to talk,
And try me to ensnare;
But true to love, my thoughts are placed
And from such offers fly,
So, with my basket to my waist,
I trudge along and cry,
Two bunches a penny Primroses,
Two bunches a penny.
What though no plumes adorn my head,
Nor satrins train behind,
I still have charms to please my Ned;
And he hits well my mind:
And soon to church with him I Will haste,
The gordian knot to tie,
No more with basket to my waist
Through Lanes or Streets I Will cry,
Two bunches a penny Primroses,
Two bunches a penny.
HEAVING THE LEAD.
FOR Balt'more, when, with favoring gale,
Our gallant ship up Ches'peake steered
And scudding under easy sail,
The high blue western land appeared;
To heave the lead the seamen sprung,
And to the Pilot cheerly sung,
"By ^^e deep -- NINE!"
And bearing up, to gain the port,
Some well known object kept in view;
An abby-tow'r, an harbour-fort,
Or beacon, to the ^essel true:
While often the lead the seamen'slung,
And to the Pilot' ch^erly sung,
"By the mark -- SEVEN!"
And, as the much loved shore we near,
With transport we beheld the roof,
Where dwell a friend, or partner dear;
Of faith and love a matchless proof!
The lead once more the seaman slung,
And to the watchful Pilot sung,
"Quarter less -- FIVE!"
SONG.
THE sweet rosy morning
Peeps over the hills,
With blushes adorning
The meadows and fields;
The merry merry merry horn
Calls come come come away,
Awake from your slumber,
And hail the new day.
The stag roused before us,
Away seems to sly,
And pants to the chorus
Of hounds in full cry;
Then follow follow follow follow
The mufical chase,
Where pleasure and vigor,
With health you embrace.
The day's sports are over,
Makes blood circle right,
And gives the brisk lover
Fresh charins for the night,
Then let us, let us now enjoy
All we can while we may,
Let love crown the night
As our sports crown the day.
SONG.
HOW poor is the man, though he wealth would possess,
Who the impulse of pity never knew!
But unfeeling could hear the said tale of distress,
And withold from misfortune its due
The element's rigor much sooner I Would brave,
Which my vessel ^on foul ground would strand;
Orin Biscay's rough bay meet a water grave,
Than I Would take such a wretch by the hand.
COME MY SYLVIA.
COME, my Sylvia! come and bless
This spot, which I have toiled to dress
(...) all that charms the gazer's eye,
(...) every tint that wears a dye.
In peace we'll dwell and placid ease,
We'll do whatever each shall please;
^ee as the sear cur senses soll,
And speak a boundless, sluent soul.
Nor time shall waft our love away,
Swift as the threads of life decay;
Each gale that flirts the hours along,
Shall bring fresh wrea^hes to deck our song.
From virtue's sweets, that never cloy;
From rural scenes, extat^c joy!
Or turn the mind instructing page,
And learn to live a good old age.
Let Us TIE THE KNOT MY SALLY.
I HAVE found my fair, a true love knot,
It Is loose by some disaster,
Come then with me to yonder grot,
And let us tie is faster;
Or shall we to the grove repair,
There is no time to dally,
The church, the pressed, awaits u^ there,
Let Us tie the knot my S^lly.
Methinks the knot was surely laid,
By Cupid's fond direction.
To prove, my sweet, my charming maid,
The Cement of affection:
It Is formed by some immor^tal hand,
Come, let us leave the valley,
And join in Hymen's silken band,
Let Us tie the knot, my Sally.
No hand can ever the band u^ tie,
When once we are united:
For every gua^dian sains is by.
When lovers vows are plighted:
The deed recorded is above,
Then let us not shilly shally,
Oh, let us haste, my charming love,
And tie the knot my Sally.
SONG.
WHEN bending over the lofty yard,
The jolly seaman reefs the sail,
Though whirlwinds roar, he grapples hard
The swinging beam, nor dreads the gale
When hidden rocks and table clouds
Impede the shattered vessel's way,
The boatswain clinging to the sh^ouds,
Undaunted pipes his midnight lay.
And '^re the wreck begins to sink,
'Ere through the sides the billows pour,
The sailor bravely stops to drink,
Th^n gra^p, the mast and gains the shore
Thus, Ha^^net, when I moored with you,
No threatening dangers would I see;
But laugh at terror's pale faced crew,
And baffle life's tempestuous sea.
Or happily should soft zephyrs blow,
We'd leave the port and share the gale;
While Bacchus called all hands below,
And fortune laugning set our sail:
From quicksands of domestic care,
Where jealousy's ioud breakers roar,
From sorrows coast we'd steer afar,
'Till death should tow our boat ashore,
FOR YOU, MY LOVELY GIRL.
COME, pretty Poll, thy tears refrain,
And dearest maid, believe
It w^ung my heart with cruel pain,
To see my charmer grieve:
Then dry those eyes and ere I go
Each anxious fear dispel:
And bold I Will meet my country's foes,
For you my lovely girl.
A sailor scorns the name of slave,
And when he is called to war,
Will teach the foe what it is to brave
A dauntless, jovial tar:
Then bid, my life, those sighs adieu,
Those lucid tears farewell:
I fly to conquer, love, for you,
For you, my lovely girl.
The signal's fired -- I Am called away,
It Is willed that we must part;
But though forbid with thee to stay,
I bear thee in my heart:
Then let not Polly be concerned
For Hymen soon shall tell,
Thy s^^lor's safe from war return,
For you, my lovery girl.
SONG.
Now Henry has left me to plough the salt sea,
May Providence shield him from harm,
What argues repining or grieving, said he,
Though fear did my bosom alarm,
With what rapture he pressed me and bid me farewell,
Crying, steady my girl, this will not do,
But my heart how it beat, and my bosom would swell,
When he whispered the parting adieu.
Blow cheerly each gale while my Henry's at sea,
Ye zephyrs prove gentle and kind,
That he may with safety return unto me,
His image is still in my mind;
Yet would I take courage and cease to regret,
As a sailor I Am sure he will be true,
But in spite of all talking I cannot forget
His last, his dear parting adieu.
No longer I Will murmur or think hard his lot
But for him my love I Will reserve:
And the cause that he fights in shall not be forgot,
For the rights of his country he will preserve:
(...) slattering hope forbids me to mourn,
While in fancy my Henry I view,
Which tells me with safety that my love will return,
And no more bid a parting adieu.
THE WESTERN SKY.
THE western sky was purpl'd over,
With every pleasing ^ay,
And fl^cks reviving felt no more
The sultry heat of day.
When from an hazel's ar^less bower,
Soft warbled Strephon's tongue,
He b^est the scene, he b^est the bower
While Nancy's praise he sung.
Let sops with fickle falsehood range
The paths of wanton love;
Whilst weeping maids lament their change,
And sadden every grove:
But endless blessings crown the day,
I saw fair Esham's dale,
And every blessing find its way,
To Nancy of the vale.
Struck with her charm^ and gentle truth,
I clasped the constant fair,
To her alone I gave my youth,
And vow my future care:
Aid when this vow shall faithless prove,
O^ I those charms forego,
The stream that sa^ our tender love,
That stream shall cease to flow.
NANCY; OR THE SAILOR's JOURNAL.
'Twas past meridian half past four,
By signal I from Nancy parted;
At six she lingered on the shore,
With uplift hands, and broken hearted.
At seven while taught ning the fore stay,
I saw her faint, or else 'twas fancy;
At eight we all got under way,
And bid a long adieu to Nancy.
Night came on, and now eight bells had rung,
While careless sailors, ever cheary,
On the mid watch so jovial sung,
With tempers labor cannot weary.
I little to their mir^h inclined,
While tender thoughts rushed on my fancy,
And my warm sighs increased the wind,
Looked on the moon and thought of Nancy.
And now arrived that jovial night,
When every true bred tar carouses,
When over the grog, all hands delight
To toast their sweet hearts and their spouses.
Round went the can, the just, the glee,
While tender wishes filled each fancy;
And when, in turn, it came to me,
I heaved a sigh, and toasted Nancy.
Next morn a storm came on at four,
(...) six, the elements in motion,
Plunged me and three poor sailors more
^^adlong within the foaming ocean.
Poor wretches, they soon found their graves,
For me, it may be only fancy,
For love seemed to sorbid the ^aves
To snatch me from the arms of Nancy.
Scarce the foul hu^ricane was cleared,
Sc^rce winds and waves had ceased to rattle,
When a bold enemy appeared,
And dauntless, we prepa^ed for battle.
And now, while some loved friend or wife,
Like lightning rushed on every fancy,
To Providence I trusted life,
And put up a prayer, and thought on Nancy.
At last, 'twas in the month of May,
The crew, it being lovely weather,
At three, A M. dis^ov^red day,
And England's chalky caffs together.
At seven, up channel how we bore,
While hopes and fears rushed on my fancy,
At twelve I gayly jumped ^shore,
And to my throbbing heart pressed Nancy.
THE TEMPEST.
^^ASE, rude boreas boisterous raller,
List ye landsmen all to me;
M^ssmates hear a brother sailor,
Sing the dangers of the sea.
From bounding billows firit in motion,
Where the distant whirlwinds rise,
To the tempest troubled ocean,
Where the seas contend with skies.
Hark, the boatswain hoarsly bawling,
By top-sail sheers and halliyards stand;
Down your stay sails quick be hauling,
Your top-g^llant-sails, hand boys hand.
S^ill it f^eshens, set in the braces,
Close reef, top-sail sheers let go;
Luff boys, luff, don'^ make wry faces,
Up your topsails nimbly clew.
The top sail yards point to the wind boys,
See all clear to reef each course;
Let the fore sheet go, don't mind it,
If the weather should turn worse.
Fore and aft he sprit-sail ya^d get,
Reef the m^zen, see all clear;
Hand up the preventer braces,
Man the fore yard, cheer boys, cheer.
Now all ye on down-beds sporting.
Fondly locked in beauty's arms,
Freth enjoy meets wanton courting,
Start from all but love's alarms.
Around us roars the tempest louder,
Thinking what fear our heart enthralls,
^^der yet, it still blows harder,
Now again the boars wain calls.
^ow the thunder's dreadful roaring.
Peal on peal contending clash;
On our heads fresh rains fait pouring,
It our eyes blue lightenings flash.
All around us one wide water,
All above us one black sky;
Different deaths at once surprise us,
Hark! what means the dreadful cry?
The formast's gone cries every tongue out;
Over the lee, twelve feet above deck;
A leak beneath the chestree sprang out,
Call all hards and clear the wreck.
Quick the lanyards cut to pieces,
Come my hearts be stout and bold;
Plumb the well, for the leak increases,
Four feet of water in the hold.
Whilst over the waves our ship is beating,
We all for our wives and sweethearts mourn;
Alas! from hence there is no retreating,
Alas! from hence there is no return.
Still the leak is gaining on us,
Both chain pumps are choked below;
Heaven have mercy here upon us,
For only that will save us now.
Over the lee beam lies the land boys,
Let the guns be overboard thrown;
To the pumps come every hand, boys,
See -- our mizen mast is gone.
But the leak we find it cannot pour fast,
We have lighted her a foot or more:
Up and rig a jury foremast,
She Is right, she is right, we are all off shore
Now once more on joys be thinking,
Since kind fortune saved our lives:
Push the can boys, let us be drinking,
To our sweathearts and our wives.
SONG.
COME, courage lads, and drink away;
A man upon his wedding day,
Ought rarely well his part to play,
At Stingo or October:
For who would be that stupid elf,
For whim, caprice, or love, or pelf,
To poison, hang, or drown himself,
Or mary when hefs sober?
For madam's will at nothing stops,
She must have balls, and routs, and fops,
And often ransacks all the sh^ps,
In gay attire to robe her.
Then drink the day you take a wife,
As the last comfort of your life,
For ever after, noise and strife
Are sure to keep you sober.
THE SEAMAN's HOME.
O You, whose lives on land are passed,
And keep from dangerous seas aloof:
^ho, careless l^sten to the blast,
Or beating rains upon the roof:
You little heed how seamen fare,
Condemned the angry storm to bear.
Sometimes while breakers vex the tide,
He takes his station on the deck:
And now ^ash'd over the vessels side,
He clears away the cumb'ring wreck:
Yet while the billows over him foam,
The ocean only is his home.
Still fresher blows the midnight gale,
'All hands reef topsails,' are the cries:
And while the clouds he heavens veil,
Aloft to reef the sail he fl^es:
In storms so rendering d^^m'd to roam,
The ocean is the seaman's home.
SWEET NIGHTINGALE.
SWEET nightingale! Queen of the spray,
Whose no^e is disturb^d by our song:
Ah! stretch nor thy pinions away,
Alarmed at ^he numerous throng;
But try the sweet warble again,
And challenge thy hea^e^s so fine,
Though the muses attend on their train,
To make such a concert as thine.
LITTLE LAD.
THOUGH I am now a very little lad,
If fighting men cannot be had,
For want of a better I may do,
To follow the boy with a rat tat too;
I may seem tender, yet I Am tough,
And though not much of me, right good fluff,
Of this I Will boast, say more who can,
I never was afraid to meet my m^n.
I Am a chickabiddy, see take me now now now,
I Am a little merry he, for your row dow dow.
Brown Bess I Will kno^k about, O there is my joy,
At my back a knapsack like a roving boy.
In my tartan played a young soldier view,
My philibeg and dirk, and my bonnet blue,
Give the word, and I Will march where you command,
Noble sergeant with a shilling strike my hand.
My captain, as he takes his glass,
May wish to toy with a pretty lass,
For such a one I have a roguish eye,
He Will never want a girl when I am by.
I Am a chickabiddy, etc.

Though a barber never yet has mowed my chin,
With my great broad sword I long to begin,
Cut, slash, ram damn -- O glorious fun,
For a gun, pip, pop, change my little pop-gun.
My foes shall fly like geese in flocks,
Even Turks I Will drive like turk^y-cocks,
And where ever quartered I shall be,
O, zounds! how I Will kiss my landlady.
I Am a chickabiddy, etc.

OF LOVE I MADE A JEST.
NOT long ago how blithe was I!
My heart was then at rest;
I knew not what it was to sigh,
Of love I made a jest.
But soon I found 'twas all in vain
To thwart the urchin's will;
For now I Am forced to drag the chain
For Fanny of the hill.
When walking out upon the green,
We chance to toy and kiss,
The lads and lasses vent their spleen,
In envy of the bliss,
By turns they censure every part,
Her face, her shape, and air;
But let 'em ra^l, with all my heart,
If I but think her fair.
With golden locks her head is graced,
That fan each dimpled cheek;
With lips might tempt even Jove to taste,
And eyes which seem to break.
If th^n such beauties she d^splays,
Ye pal^ry cri ica hence;
For such a fo^m was made for praise,
And not to give essence.
Great gods! who made mankind your care.
And judge unseen above:
For once be graceful to my prayer,
Give me the girl I love:
That when possessed of Fanny's charms,
The world I may defy;
And when you snatch her from my arms.
With pleasure then I Will die.
MAJOR ANDRE's SOLILOQUY.
RETURN ^e rap^u^'d hours,
When D^l^a's heart was mine:
When she wit^ wreaths of flowers,
My temples did entwine.
No jealousy, nor care --
Corro^ed in my breast;
Bu^y sions light as air,
P^esided over my rest.
But now around my couch,
No any visions p^ay;
No flowers deck my b^ow --
Each wearied holliday.
For far from these sad plains,
The ^^v^ly Delia fl^^;
W^ile w^^^k'd with jealous pains --
The wretch^d Andre -- dies.
[The foregoing was written by Major Andre while a prisoner in the American
camp.]

THE DRUM.
COME each gallant l^d.
Who for pleasure quit^ care,
To the drum, drum, drum, drum --
To the drum head with spirit repair.
Each recruiter takes a glass,
And each young s^ldier with his lass:
While he drum beats tat^o^ -- while, etc.
Retires the sweet night to pass.
Each night gayly lad --
Thus we'll merrily waste,
'Till the drum, drum, drum, drum, etc.
'Till the drum tells us it is past.
Pi^quet arms at dawn now shine,
And each drum ruffles down, down the line,
Now the drums bears revelle, now the, etc.
Sa^u^ing the day divine.
But hark yonder shouts --
See that standard now alarms;
Now the drum, drum, drum, drum, etc.
Now the drum beats loudly to arms.
Killed and wounded ho^ they lie!
Helter, skelter, se^ them fly,
Now the drum beats retreat, now, etc.
We'll fire a feu-de-joy.
THE CAPTIVE SLAVE.
OH! think on my fate! once I freedom enjoyed,
Was as happy as happy could be!
But pleasure is sled, even hope is destroyed,
A Captive alas! on the sea!
I was taken by the foe -- 'twas the fiat of fate.
To tear me from her I adore!
When tho'^ brings to my mind, my once happy state,
I sigh! while I tug at the oar.
Hard, hard, is my fate! -- Oh! how galling my chain!
My life's steered by mysery's chart;
And though against my tyrants I scorn to complain,
Tears gush forth to ease my full heart;
I disdain even to sh^ink, though I feel the sharp lesh;
Yet m^ breast bleeds for her I adore!
While around me the unfelling billows will dash,
I sigh! and still tug at the oar.
How Fortune deceives! -- I had pleasures i^ tow,
The port where she dwelt, we'd in view;
But the wished nuptial morn was o'erclouded with woe,
And dear Anna, I was hurried from you!
Our shallop was boarded and I borne away,
To behold my dear^ Anna no more!
But despair wastes my spirits, my form feels deca^'d!
He sighed -- and expired at the oar.
THE LAMPLIGHTER.
I AM jolly Dick ^he Lamplighter,
They say the Sun's my dad,
And truly I believe it so,
For I Am a pretty lad;
Father and I the world do light
And make it look so gay,
The difference is, I light by night,
My father lights by day.
But father's not the like of I,
For knowing life and fun,
For I strange tricks and fancy spy,
Folks never show the sun;
Rogues, owls, and bats, cannot bear the light,
I Have heard your wise ones say,
And so, do you m^nd, I sees by night,
Things never seen by day.
At night men lay aside all art,
As qui^e an useless task,
And many a face, and many a heart,
Will then pull off the mask;
Each formal prude and holy wight,
Will throw disguise away,
And sin it openly at night,
Who saint it all the day.
His darling hoard the miser views,
Misses from friends decamp,
And many a statesman mischief brews,
To his country over his lamp;
So father and I, do you take me right,
Are just on the fame lay,
I barefaced sinners light by night,
And he false saints by day.
THE SWEET LITTLE GIRL THAT LOVE.
MY friends all declare that my time is m^^pent,
While in ru^al re^irement I love;
I ask no more weal than dame fortune has se^^
But the sweet l^ttle girl that I love,
The sweet litt^e girl that I love.
The rose on her cheeks my delight
She Is soft as the down, as the down on the dove,
No lily was ever so white
As the sweet little girl that I love.
Though humble my cot, calm content glides the scene,
For my fair one delights in my grove;
And a palace l'd quit for a dance on the green,
With the sweet little girl that I love.
No ambition I know but to call her my own,
No fame but her praise wish to prove;
My happiness centers in Fanny alone,
She Is the sweet little girl that I love.
A GLASS IS GOOD.
A GLASS is good, and a lass is good,
And a pipe to smoke in cold weather;
The world is good, and the people are good,
And we are all good fellows together.
A bottle it is a very good thing,
With a good deal of good wine in it;
song is good when a body can sing,
And to finish we must begin it.
^table is good, when spread with good cheer,
And good company sitting round it;
When a good way off, we are not very near,
And for sorrow the devil confound it;
A glass is good, etc.

A f^iend is good when you're ou^ of good luck,
For tha^'s a good time to try him;
For a Justice is good, the haunch of a buck,
With such a good present you buy him:
A fine o^d woman is good when she is dead,
A rogue very good for good ha^ging;
A fool is good by the nose to be led,
My good song deserves a good drubbing.
A glass is good, etc.

SONG.
WHEN the trees are all bare, not a leaf to be seen,
And the meadows their beauties have lost;
When all nature's dis^ob^d of i^s mantle of green,
And the streams are fast bound by the frost:
When the peasant, inactive, stands shivering with cold,
Bleak the winds as they northerly blow,
And the innocen slocks ton ^or shelter to fold,
With their fl^eces all sp^inkled with snow.
In the yard when the cattle are fodder'd with straw,
And send forth their breath like a steam;
When the neat looking dairy maid sees she (...) thaw
Flakes of ice tha she firds on her cream;
The blithe country maiden as fresh as the roses
As she carelessly trips often sl^des,
And the rustics loud l^ugh, if in falling she she^^
Those charms which her modesty hides.
When ^he lads and the lass^s for company joined
And round the hall embers are m^^,
Talk of witches, and fairies, that ride ^n the wind,
And of ghost, '^ill they are all in a sweat:
When the birds o^the barn-door come hov'^ing for food.
O^ silen^ly sit on the spray;
And the poo^^timid hare in v^in secks the wood,
For faithless her footsteps betray.
Heaven grant in that season it may be my lot,
With the girl that I love and admire,
When the ^sickles hang to the ea^es of my cot,
I may ^hither in safety retire:
There in neatness and quiet, and free from surprise,
May we live and no hardships endure,
Nor feel any turbulent passions arise,
But those which each other can cu^e.
SONG.
WE soldiers drink, we soldiers sing;
We fight our foes, and love our king,
Are ever brisk and jolly;
We know no care in peace or war;
(...) ask no wealth but fame and health,
A knapsack and a Dolly.
Then mirth invites, we seldom think;
Then honor calls, we never sh^ink;
But scorning melancholy,
^^ert and gay, we march away
^o foreign parts with cheerful hearts,
A knapsack and a Dolly.
(...) doomed to fall, the good and brave
Will dew with tears their soldiers grave,
Thus sadness is a folly;
His dauntless sword fame will record,
His comrade dear will prize and cheer,
His knapsack and his Dolly.
Then come, my noble heroes, come,
With sprightly fife and echoing drum,
With minds elate and jolly;
Let Us take the fi^ld, nor ever yield
^o fortunes frowns, 'till conquest crowns
Our knapsack and our Dolly.
JACK IN HIS ELEMENT
BOLD Jack, the sailor, here he comes,
Pray how do you like my nib,
^y trowsers wide and trample on,
My nab and flowing jib,
I sailed the seas from e^d to end,
And lead a joyous life,
At every mess we find a friend,
At every por^ a wife.
I have heard them talk of constancy,
Of grief and such like fun,
I have constant been to ten, cried I,
But never grieved for one.
The flowing sails we tars unbend,
To lead a roving life,
At every mess we find a friend,
At every port a wife.
I have a spanking wife at Por^smou^h gates,
A pigmy at Goree,
An orange tawny up the Straits,
A black at St. Lucie.
Thus whatsoever c^urse we bend,
We lead a jovial life,
At every mess we find a friend,
At every port a wife.
Will Gaff by death was taken a back,
I came to bring the news,
Poll whimper'd sore, but what object,
I stood in William's shoes.
She got high chest, and at the end,
She loves me as her life,
And she has got an h^^nest friend,
And I a loving wife.
Come all you sailors that do go,
The unfortunate ^^as to ^ub;
You must work, love, and fight your foes,
And drink your gen^rous bub.
Storms that our masts in splinters tea^
Can take our joyou^ life,
In every want we find a friend,
And every port a wife.

COMMON SENSE.
Tune, "Gi^l I left behind me."
OH why should weak deluded man,
So long continue blind, si^?
^hy should he alse a fan^i^d form,
To impose upon his mind, sir?
^hen all appear of equal worth
Before the eye of Heaven;
Why should he ^dl, dread that power,
Which he himself has given.
Why should he tamely bow to those
Who class him with the swine, sir?
Who b^d him eat his bitter bread,
N^r off^r to repine, si^?
Who d^re alas, wi^h shameless front;
Assert that 'twould do good, sir;
If ever he murmur forth h^s wrongs,
To silence them with blood, sir.
Why should the gewgaw tricks of ^^ate,
Impose upon his reason?
Such toys and play-things are but fit
For childhood's simple season.
The jewels sparkling on the breast,
A child's regard may win, sir.
The manly mind locks not for these,
But asks the gem within, sir.
MAN wants no ornament of state,
No trick to make him greater,
The Pompous vestments but deface
The image of his Maker;
The simple garb and plain attire
The honest heart best suit, sir,
For Virtue only makes the man
Superior to the brute, sir.
THE HAPPY REFORMATION.
Tune -- "Maggy Lauder."
BRAVE Country men, both great and small,
Your FREEDOM now regain it;
A lesson I will give to you,
How we are to obtain it: --
In UNION's band be firm and true,
And still we'll grow the stronger;
Nor shall we groan bene^th the yoke
Of tyrants any longer
Tol, lol, etc.

^^me nature formed us all alike,
The brethren of one Nation,
Why should we then jar and fight,
To please men in high station!
Be patient, wise, and virtue prize --
This will be our salvation;
Let quarrels ce^se, and be in peace --
Oh! happy Reformation.
Tol, lol, etc.

The cause is good the works your own --
Then do it to perfection;
Let wisdom guide you in the way,
Walk strict by her direction,
Which, joined with courage' never can fail.
And manly resolution,
For to accomplish LIBERTY,
And banish persecu^ion.
Tol, lol, etc.

Go on, my boys, you know your rights,
Be sure that you do gain them:
Courtiers, creatures, and their power,
Now see that you disdain them;
Their pimps and spies, likewise despise --
Be steady in your station;
Assist the distressed and much oppr^ss'd,
Whether cousin or relation.
Tol, lol, etc.

THE GREEN FLAG.
Tune "The Girl I left behind me"
HIBFRNIA's Sons, the Patriot band,
Claim their Emancip^tion,
Arous'd from steep, they wish to be
An INDEPENDENT NATION;
United firm, like men of sense,
And ruly patriotic,
They vow they will not pay their pence
To any power despotic.
See shame faced misery at the door,
IERNE's Peasant st^rving;
While landlor^s, absen^ees and knaves
In England waste each farthing:
And thus their crimes our country stain.
Vi^e ^obbers and oppressors,
We hope that yet a time will come
To punish such tra^sgressors.
Hibernia then will raise her head,
The GREEN FLAG wide extending,
Her HARP well tu^'d to Liberty,
Her sons their rights defending;
Justice then begins her reign
Triumphant in our nation,
Good will on earth, and peace to man,
Throughout the whole creation.
SEE YOUR COUNTRY RIGHTED.
Tune "Maggy Lauder,"
ASSEMBLED in our country's cause,
Let Us hail the happy season!
We fear no frowns nor court applause,
Pursuing Truth and Reason.
Boldly all with heart and hand
Here we meet united,
And by each other firmy stand,
To s^e our country righted.
Long ben^ath the rod we lay,
Plundered and comented;
But no more shall tyron (...) sway,
Our wrongs shall be resented.
Boldly all with heart, etc.

See the rich and s^mp^uous board!
Ha pies all forrounding,
Seize our wea^th to swell the hoard,
In luxury abounding.
Boldly all with heart, etc.

Shall we tamely yet resign,
Our pu^se to these Collectors?
And hall them with a RIGHT DIVINE!
Away with such protectors.
Boldly all with heart, etc.

Fearless of their lawless power,
E^np^ys^ns of chander;
Let them bluster out their hour,
They shall soon knoek under.
Boldly all with heart, etc.

Brave the dangers that surround,
Bid them all defiance i
Truth eternal is our ground,
THE PEOPLE our alliance.
Boldly then with heart, etc.

See our numbers how they grow!
Crowding and dividing;
Eager all their rights to know,
Reason still presiding.
Boldly all with heart, etc.

Let us then as friends agree;
Kings and Priests dissemble;
War and strife they love to see,
UNION makes them tremble.
Boldly all with heart and hand, etc.

THE IRISH VOLUNTEERS.
Tune "Volunteers March,"
IN what history can you find,
Of all the soldiers of mankind,
A host of heroes formed in line,
Like IRISH VOLUNTEERS!
In ancient, or in modern days,
Did poets ever tune their lays,
To patrioto crowned with so much praise,
As IRISH VOLUNTEERS?
What bright days throughout the year,
At our reviews the na^ion cheer,
When crowds immense haste far and near,
T'admire our VOLUNTEERS!
The brave alone deserve the fair:
The ladies who best judges are,
Assert no soldiers can compare
With IRISH VOLUNTEERS?
THE NEGRO's COMPLAINT.
Tune, "How perfect is expression."
FORCED from home, and all its pleasures,
Afric's coast I left forlorn,
TO increase a stranger's treasures,
Over the raging billows borne.
Men from England bought and sold me,
Paid my pricerin paltry gold;
Though theirs they have enrolled me,
Minds are never to be sold.
Still in 'thought as free as ever,
What are England's rights? I ask,
From my delights to sever,
Me to torture, me to task?
Fleecy locks, and black complexion,
Cannot forfelt nature'^ claim:
Skins may differ, but affection
Dwells in black and white the same.
Why did all-creating nature
Make the plant for which we toil?
Sighs must fan it, tears must water,
Sweat of ours must dress the soil.
Think, ye masters iron-hearted!
Lolling at your jovial boards,
Think, how many backs have smarted
For the sweets your cane affords!
Is there, as ye sometimes tell us
Is there one who reigns on high!
Has he bid you buy and sell us,
Speaking from his throne the sky,
Ask him, if your knoted scourges,
Fet^e^s, blood extorting screws,
Are the means which duty urges
Agenes of his will to use?
Deem our nation brutes no longer,
Till some reason ye shall find,
W^^hier of regard and stronger
Than the color of our kind.
Slaves of gold! whose sordid dealings,
Taroish all your boasted powers,
Prove that you have human seelings,
Ere you proudly question our's!
THE GRAVE DIGGER'S ADDRESS, TO THE PRINCE OF WALES.
Tune "Merrily danced the Quaker."
Go on, brave Prince, increase your debts,
They Will all be reimbursed;
So many friends you do support,
The rest are easy forced --
Go on, I say -- advance your cause.
You Will soon come to the crown, sir,
And then with ware and luxury
You Will make my pot b^il brown, sir.
Yet merrily will the people dance,
And merrily will they caper,
Merrily will they all rejoice
When freed from such a creature.
And honor to the land you're sure,
To have in t^ blood royal;
And though the Peasont toils for you,
He Is hanged if not quite loyal
Why then should God's anointed band
In luxury be bounded? --
Then th^ow the public wealth away,
As if the nation found it.
Yet merrily, etc.

When men for Liberty shall call,
You must like all s^load them,
And then the smouther they will go
When you ind^ne to goad them:
They Will cry you're then a mighty prince,
A noble benefactor,
And pliant to your will they will be,
As if you were Protector.
Yet merrily, etc.

But now as to your King-chance, sir,
Indeed I would not buy it,
Or if I had it in my power,
I would not like to try it.
would as soon a Tinker be
And buckle on my budget,
As live upon the starving poor,
And hear mankind begrudge it.
Yet merrily, etc.

Farewell great, noble, royal sir --.
Your titles I Have forgot them,
But if I had them in my power,
I certainly would ROT them;
By ME, indeed, you should be praised,
Likewise your ROYAL DAD; sir,
For by his wars, and your excess,
I Have got a fat Church yard, sir.
Yet merrily will the people dance,
And merrily will they caper;
Merrily will they all rejoice.
When freed from such a creature.
THE UNION OF PARTIES.
Tune "The Cudgel."
GRAND Juries those time-serving knaves,
With arrogant power maintain,
That Catholic emancipation
We have not a right to obtain.
But oh, for a UNION OF PARTIES,
A UNION OF PARTIES for me,
And when that we are all United,
Poor Ireland then will be free.
Arrah Jurymen though I Am a Connaughtman,
Yet I am sorry to see,
Yon t^^be of oppressors combining
To hinder us all to be free.
But oh, etc.

Says the Jurymen, TEADY be easy,
I remember the time you were worse;
Says TEADY I well do remember,
That day was old Ireland's curse.
But, oh, etc.

I was worse faith, but soon I Will be better,
Dear neighbors I Will let you to see;
For the faster the Romans are rising,
The sooner the country they will free.
But, oh, etc.

They said I had a house, and a garden
To give me potatoes and bread:
(...) on Michaelmas day, the Landlord
He canted them over my head.
But, oh, etc.

Then from my horse and my garden
I was forced with my family to go;
Obliged to travel the nation.
In pover^y, hardships and woe.
But, oh, etc.

When we have thrown by our division,
Our misery will soon dis^ppear,
And the tythers and taxcr^ of mankind
Will shrink with horror and fea^.
But, oh, etc.

No longer the agen's of power,
Will by our hard labor be fed;
And the laboring poor of the nation
Will then find plenty of bread.
But, oh, for a Union of Parties,
A Union of Parties for me;
And when that we all are United,
Poor Ireland then will be Free.
THE PLACEMEN AND PENSIONER ADDRESS TO THE SWINISH MULTITUDE.
Tune "Derry Down."
YE vile swinish herd, in the fly of taxatio^
What would you be after disturbing the nation?
Give over your grumbling -- be off -- to your fly
(...) dare to look out if a king should pass by.
Derry down, down, down derry down.
Do you know what a king is? -- By Patrick I Will tell you,
He has power in his pocket to buy you and sell you:
To make you his soldiers, or keep you to work,
To hang you, or cure you, for ham or salt pork.
D^rry down, etc.

Do you think that a king is no more than a man?
Ye I^sh, ye sw^nish ironical cl^n!
I swear by his offi^e, his right is divine,
To flog you, and seed you, and treat you like swine.
Derry down, etc.

To be sure I have said -- but I spoke it abrupt,
That the state is defective, and also corrupt:
Yet, remember I to^d you with pre^a mon to peep,
For swine at a distance we prudently keep.
Derry down, etc.

Now the Church and the state, to keep each other warm.
Are married together, pray where is the harm?
How healthy and wealthy are h^sb^nd and wife!
But swine are excluded the conjugat life.
Derry down, etc.

What use do we make of your money? you say;
By the first law in nature -- we take our own pay,
(...) next on our friends a few pensions be^^ow
(...) to you we apply when our treasure runs low
Derry down, etc.

What know you of commons, of kings or of lords,
But what the dim light of taxation affords?
Be conten^ed with that and no more of your rout.
Or a new Proclamation will muzzle your snout.
Derry down, etc.

THE TRUMPET OF FAME.
Tune, "Planksty Connor."
GOOD People I pray you attend to me,
Who wish to set your Country FREE.
In UNION's band
Join hand in hand,
And be ye fi^mly UNITED;
The virtuous and brave will commend you,
And LIBERTY's Sons will befriend you,
The Ladies, so fair,
Your victories will share,
The prayers of the poor will attend you.
Tol, lol, etc.

Your Country's rights, on you depends,
Then cheer up your hearts my trusty friends;
In bondage perceive
Your bre^hren does grieve.
By slavery so long degraded:
To LIBERTY's arms I call you,
Let no despotic power enthral you,
No time serving imps,
Their spies or their pimps;
Shall ever find shelt^r among you.
Tol, lol, etc.

Be wise, ye Irishmen, and brave,
Persevere -- you will your country save;
The B^stiles you will tea^,
The SHAMROCK you will wear,
In spite of all knaves and usurpers:
With wisdom view man in his station,
Ye Sons of the brave I^ish Nation;
May the Trumpet of Fame
Your FREEDOM proclaim,
And meet with mankind's approbation.
THE PATRIOT YOUTH.
Tune, "Donald Brann."
GALLANT nation foes no more,
Ge^'rous I^^sh hail the day,
When from Hiberni^'s cul^ur'd shore
We chase ^yrannic power away.
Tol, lol, etc.

Late a band of Patriots rose,
Firm in Freedom's ^lorious cause;
Feeble slaves in vain oppose
Rights secured by equal laws.
Tol, lol, etc.

Verdant myrtles deck their brows,
Branchy leaves their blades entwin;
While, like us, they pay their vows
To each Patriot Hero's shrine.
Martial youths in Ireland bred,
Kindled with cogenial zeal,
Freedom'^ pa^h reso^v'd to tread,
J^a^ous of the public weal.
Tol, lol, etc.

Should tyrannic ^ower again
Raise its hydrae head on high,
Welcome then the hostile plain,
Freemen, da^ndess, dare ^o die!
Tol, lol, etc.

Ve^dant myrtles, branchy pride,
Shall t^eir thirsty blades entwine;
No, generous yo^th be not dis^nay'd,
The Rignis or Man you will never resign.
Tol, lol, etc.

THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH.
Tune, "Mo^gan Ratler."
ARRAH! PADDY, dear boy, my heart and my jo^;
Tune up your HARP. in the cause of our Country;
With repub^ican ^lee still le us agree.
And gallantly plant the Tree of Liberty.
The people, you see, do now all agree,
In spite of the tribe that long divided them;
We'll throw off the yoke -- huzza! for the stroke,
Sure, gramachree. PADDY, we'll have day about with them.
Tol, lol, etc.

Was Ireland Free, how snug I would be!
Myself and my neighbors would live to happily;
No tax would we pay, but what would defray
The ^en^e of the nation, laid out honestly:
Till that time shall come, let dissentions be mum;
What signifies quarrelting -- we are Irishmen;
All religious disputes hereafter he mu^e,
And unite to opp^se the mem that first ra^sed them,
Tol, lol, etc.

Hibernians you see, like brothers should be
And live like one family, happy and lovingly:
No artful knaves would then make them slaves;
But all would be mirth and conviviality.
For the rights of Man we will jo^n heart and hand,
The cause it is good, we never will fly for it:
Truta, I Will be ba^l in the ^ud must prevail --
By the holy St. PATRICK we'll fig^t till we die ror it.
Tol, lol, etc.

Ye Irishmen bold, let truth now be told --
English i^fluence has long enslaved us;
But n^w comes the time, our not on will shine,
As Providence, sure ^ha^ assi^^ed us.
Sweet FREEDOM appear, and ^very heart cheer
Relieving from chains those bound by iniquity
Let justice preside our footsteps to guide,
And lead us to peace and joyous tranquillity.
Tol, lol, etc.

SONG
SONS of Bacchua lets be gay,
Nimbly move the cheerful glass;
Life is short and glides away,
Let it then in pleasure pass:
Phoebus now may hide his light,
Silver Cyn^hia cease to shine,
Bacch^s' rays are far more bright,
Sparkling from the generous wine.
When the nymph is coy and cold,
And puts on a scornful air,
Bacchus makes the lover bold,
Gour^ge ever gains the fair:
While the fool who wastes his time,
Trisling over insipid tea,
Never can aim at things sublime,
'Till he freely drinks like me.
A CALL TO IRISHMEN.
Tune, "Wolf at Quebec."
NOW Hibernians bold and brave,
Let us all combine and save
This our Nation, from dire slavery.
For they rob us of our rights:
And till Irishmen UNITES.
We need never expect to be FREE.
Let us pull those villains down,
Base minions of a crown,
To enslave us is all they desire;
And too well they did succeed:
But Hiber^in shall be freed,
And fell tyranny shall foon expire,
Let us all our FREEDOM gain,
And our LIBERTY maintain,
That our moite henceforward may be --
Let Hibe^nia est in Peace,
And each Party quarrel ceas^ --
Le a^l Mankind Un^te and be FREE.
Let us cast ^way the yoke,
And our cha^ns will soon be, broke --
We will then bo a Nation once more:
Then our honor shall ^evive,
When they see we are alive:
Le! fair FREEDOM approaches our shore.
HONEST PAT.
Tune, "Girl I left behind me."
HIBERNIA's Sons, with hearts elate,
Who have des^o^ie fl^v'ry,
No jorn with us the cause is great,
Display your I^^sh brav'^^;
To crush chose k^aves that us e^slaves'
Our g^us shall roa^ like thunder,
And let hem see that we'll not be
By tyrants long kept under.
Old Grana g^oans, laments and moans,
Sore goaded by oppressors:
We are her Sons, the only ^n's,
Can be her so^e redresso^s; --
She loadly calls to one and all,
To cu^ her ch^ins asunder:
Her ^yc^nts ^ear, and greatly fear
That us they cannot keep under.
To miss this time would be a crime,
W^^st ^uro^^ is affrighted;
Wan warlike rage, now is the age
To see our country right^d.
A thing ^yra^me, struck by PAT,
To dust shall m^^ der under;
The hero's f^et shall tram l^^t --
For us they shan's keep under.
No S^a^esman great. Priest or Prelate;
Shall st^p ou^ bo^d concep^i^a;
When we are joined, with firm^ess bound,
We'll baffle their deceptions,
A bill of woe, by ^he junto,
Has passed through the House quick,
For to defile Hibernia's Isle,
And bird down honest PATRICK.
THE VIRTUCUS WARRIORS.
Tune, "Rossin C^stle."
HAIL! undaunr^d Hibernians true offspring of light,
Whose hearts will not recoil, nor give back to the fight;
Whose minds are unshaken whose breasts courage warms.
To try FREEDOM's cause by the strong dint of arms;
There Is a choice here before you, pray which will you take?
Will you stand by old Ireland and die for her sake?
Will you bring down oppression, or fall by its grasp?
Will you fly from your brethren, and leave them oppressed?
Vile oppressors I Am ready your minions to fight,
Your threats and bravadoes my mind shall not affright;
I have one life to lose -- I have laid it at stake,
I Am resolved -- and you will never my fortitude shake:
Why should heroes be backward their fate to receive,
Since all mankind must fleep in a dark files grave?
We have a great CREATOR, who sees from on high,
And without his command not a Sparrow can die.
Do you think to affright me by weapons d^^ death?
By power you may force me to yield up my brea^h:
Yet the high effervescence of glory I feel.
Condemning your actions -- despising your fleel:
What a glory it is for a warrior to fall.
By the thurst of a pike, or the force of a ball:
But what horrid disgrace from his country to fly,
Just because he a moment the sooner must die.
You think Irishmen cowards -- the error you will see,
They will yet be a nation -- they soon will be Free;
It will sorely surprise you to see them fland forth,
The rabble of the South with the swine of us North.
Let us boldly press forward with hearts undismayed,
For what should we tremble, or of what be afraid?
Let it never be recorded Hiberniars would fly --
But stand firm by each other, and conquer or die.
LIBERTY's ADDRESS TO HER FRIENDS IN IRELAND.
Tune. "Rejected Mason."
MY name is FREEDOM, new come over,
In priva^e, to this Nation,
I ^^vel'd round from shore to shore
To find out true relations;
My friends are true, and kind enough
To entertain a stranger,
But dare no own me openly
They Are so exposed to danger.
Tol, lol, etc.

My trusty friends if you will Unite,
And give me your assistance --
For Church and State are both combined
To banish my exi^tence:
But if you will true and rusty be,
And borsi your chains asunder,
My Fiag snali wave high in the air,
And make the nations wonder.
Tol, lol, etc.

Then we'll possess Hibernia's Isle,
And I no more will wander;
Young men and maids right j^y fully,
Sh^^l r^^ly ^oun^ the ^^^^d^rd:
No h^st^e blood s^all stain the jo^l,
Each one their lov^ enjoying;
Your h^a is and s^irus will r^j^ice
To see the Green Flag slying.
Tol, lol, etc.

My loving Sons who are consigned,
I hope you're not complaining,
Be not afraid -- do not repin: --
I Am sure you know my meaning:
For were it proper at t^is time,
You know it is my desire,
Your Freedom soon should be obtained,
Though thousands should expire.
Tol, lol, etc.

MUTUAL LOVE. A SONG.
BY G. A. STEVENS.
Tune, -- As Chloe on flowers reclined.
ON a brook's grassy brink, ^n the winow cool shade,
The primroses pressing, a damsel was said;
She smiled on the tide tha^ rolled limpid along,
Beholding herself, to herself sung this song. --
The 'Squire's fine lady last night he brough home;
What! ho' in such gay clothes from London she is come,
Had I costly fashions, as well should I seem,
For fairer my face is, if truth's in this stream,
Through church yard on Sunday, as flowly I treas
While gaping louts, grinning, on Tombstoo^ are spread:
I hear how they praise me, I keep on my ^ay,
And, down-looking, seem not to heed what the say.
Sometimes lords and captains, all over perfume;
Will st^p me, and ^ell me, I Am beauty in bloom:
That I rival h^rose. -- that I Am whiter than snow:
I simper, and simply say, -- "Don't jeer one so."
They Have pressed me, they have promised, nay offered me gold.
Sometimes (I assure them) they have strove to be bo^d:
They Have talked of my treasure, they have called it a gem;
To be sure so it is, but it is not for ^^em.
No! no! it is for him, and 't^s only his part,
Who Is ^he man of my hope, and the hope o^ my heart;
Who frien^ly instructs me, wh^ fondly can play,
And h^s eyes always speak what his wishes would say.
The ranging be sweets from the honey-cup fr^s.
As swee I ^ste love from the touch of his lips;
Often my cheek on he fleece of my ^^^bkins I est,
But col^^s that pillow compard to his breast
It Is here for my fair one! -- her I ver replied,
Over he hedge as he leaped, and light drop^'d at her side;
She ^a^^ed! a moment jife's bloom left her face,
But quick' ^^^was recalled by the warmen of embrace.
She languishing lay in love's tenderest scene,
And questioned the rambler where ^'^was he had been?
Why so he would fright there -- sh^'d scold him she ^ow'd;
But a kiss was his plea, and that psea was allowed.
'Till by kisses overcome, to his trans^orts she yi^rds,
The ^andscapes were lost, and forgot were the fields;
Each fe^^ those sensations, susceptibles prove,
Who, mutually mel^ing, exchange mutual love.
MARTIALIS EPIGRAMMA. Lib. vi. Ep. 34. Imitated.
BY SIR C. H. WILLIAMS.
COME Chloe, and give me sweet k^sses,
For sweeter sure never girl gave;
For why, ^n the mid^^ of our bl^sses,
Do you ask me how many I Would have?
I Am not to be stanted in pleasure,
Then pray thee my charmer be kind;
For wailst (...) love thee above measure,
To numbers I Will never be confined.
Count the bees that on Hyb'a are ^laving,
Count the fl^w'rs that enamel its field,
Count the flocks that on Tempe are traying,
Or the grain that rich Sic^^y yields;
Go number the stars in the heaven,
Count how many sands on the shore;
When so many ^i^^es you have given,
I ^ill shall be craving for more.
To a hear^ full of love let m^ hold thee,
To a heart which, dear Chloe is thine,
With my a^ms I Will for ever in^^ld thee,
And swift round thy limbs (...) v^ne,
What joy can be greater than this is?
My life on thy lips shall be s^ent;
Bu^ the wretch that can number his kisses,
With few will be ever content.
TO A YOUNG LADY WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES, ON VALENTINE'S DAY.
SAID TO BE BY DR.B -- Y;
BR^MFUL of anger -- not of love,
The champion sends his foe a glove;
But I, that have a double share.
Of the softer p^ssi^n -- send a pair:
Nor think it, dearest Delia, cru^l
Than I invite you to a duel.
Ready to meet you face to face,
A^ any time, in any plac^:
Nor shall I leave you in the lurch,
Though you should dare to fix ^he church:
There come equipped with all your charms,
A ring and license are my ar^^.
I will (...) try,
Resolved to fight, though sure to die.
SONG
BY C -- L T --.
WHEN Fanny, blooming fair,
First caught my ravished sight;
Stro^k with her shape and air,
I felt a strange deli^h^:
Wh^lst eage^ly I gazed,
Adm^ring every part,
And every feature praised,
She stole into^m heart.
In her hew ^ching eyes,
Ten thous^n loves appear;
There Cupid basking ^es.
H^s shafis a^e hoarded there,
Her blooming checks are died,
Wi^h color a^^ heir own,
Exce^ling far the pride,
Of roses n^wly blown.
Her well turned limb^ confess,
The lucky hand of Jove;
Her foatures all express
The beauteous queen of love;
When sl^mes my nerves invade;
When I behold the breast
Of that too c^arming maid
Rise sung to be pres^d!
Venus round Fenry's ^aisl,
Has her own cestus bound,
With guardian Cupid's graced,
Who dance the circle round.
How happy m^st he be,
Who shall her zone unloose!
Tha^ liss to all but me.
May heaven and she refuse.
SONG.
BY MRS. R --.
TO make the man kind, and keep true to your bed,
Whom your ch^^ce or your dess^ny, brings you to wed;
Take an hin^ from a friend, whom experience has ^a^g^t,
And ex^^^^nce, we know, never fails when it is bought!
The a^ts which you practiced at first to ensnare,
(For in love little arts, as in battle, are ^a^^)
Whether neatn^^s, or prudence, or wit were the bait,
Let the hook still be covered and still play the cheat.
Should he fancy another, upbraid not his flame!
To reproach him is never the way to reclaim;
It Is more to recover, than conquer an heart;
For one is all nature, the other all art.
'Tho a fairer than you he should happen to see
Be pleased with his choice, and then wish you were she:
Slyly find out your rival's particular charms.
And at night be the very '^be girl in his arms.
G^od sense is to them, what a face is to you;
Flatter that, and like us, they but think it their due:
Doubt the streng^h of your judgment, compa^^ to his own,
And he^ll give you perfections, at pe^sent u^known.
Should you learn that your rival his bounty partakes,
And your m^rit^d favor, ungrateful, forsakes
Sall, still debonair: still ergaging and free,
Be deaf, though you hear; and be blind, while you see.
LAMENTABLE CASE.
Submitted to the Ba^h Physicians.
BY SIR C. H. WILLIAMS.
YE famed physician^ of this place,
Hear Strephon's and poor Chloe's case,
Nor think tha^ I am j^king:
When she wo^'d, he can not comply,
When ^e would d^in^^; sh^'s not a-dry,
And is not this provoking?
A^ night when Strephon comes to rest,
Chloe rec^ives him on her breast,
With fondly-folding arms:
Down, down he han^s his drooping head,
Falls fast asleep, and lies as dead,
Neglecting all her charms.
Reviving when the mo^n returns,
With rising flames young Strephon burns,
And fain, won'd fain be doing;
^u^ C^^^e, now sl^ep, or sick,
Has no great relish for the trick,
And sadly bau^k^ his wooing.
O cru^l and disast' rous case.
When in the cri^ical embrace,
That only one is burning!
Dear docto^s, set this ma^ter right,
Give Strephon spi^^ts over night,
Or Chloe in the morning.
THE POET's TALE; OR, THE CAUTIOUS BRIDE.
BY R. E. S --, ESQUIRE
BRIDES. in all countries, have been reckoned.
For the first night, tim^d and coolish,
If they co^^inue so the second,
They a^w^ys have been reckoned foolish.
The reason's obvi^us and plai^ --
In many nice and t^cklish cas^s,
There Is much o^l^se, and naught to gain,
By affection and grimaces:
A brid^ groom, on ^he second night,
Wh^pt off the bed clothes in surprise,
Behold my dear, said he, a si^ht,
Enough to make your cho^^r rise.
She turned away as red as s^a^let.
W^^ist he cononu'd, p^a^ ^^hold;
Lay h^^ds on that outrag^ou^ ^a^le^,
That looks so impudent and bold.
This is the fifteenth time in vain,
He ha^h been sent to jail and fet^er'd
But there is no prison can contain
A prison breaker like JACK SHEPHARD.
The bride turned round, and took her place;
After some study^ng and ^hi^^king --
Said she, recovering her face
Though modesty still kept her winking;
In vain the vagabond'^ committed,
And to hard work and labor sent,
If you, his keeper, are outwitted
By his pretending to repent.
You treat him ru^gedly and hard,
Wh^lst any ins^lence appears,
But you're disarmed, and off your guard,
The moment that he falls in te^^s.
Now you must know that I suspect
A fe^low-feeling in such shape,
O^ else you would not, through neglect,
Let him continually escape.
I Will lend n^ hand, unless you will swear,
Tha^ you will delive him to me,
And suffer m^ to keep him there,
'Till I consent to set him free.
THE UNION OF BEAUTY AND WINE. A SONG.
BY G. A. STEVENS.
Tune, -- Attend all ye fair ones, I Will tell you the ar^
ONE day at her toilet, as Venus b^gan
To prepare for her face-making duty.
Bacchus stood at her elbow, and swore that her plan
Would not help it, but hinder her beauty.
A bottle young Semele held up to view,
And begged sh^'d observe his directions --
This burgund^, dear Cytharea, will do,
It Is a ^odge that refines all complexions.
Too polite to resuse him, the bumper she sips,
On his knees, the buck begged she would encore;
The joy-giving goddess, with wine-moisten'd lips,
Declared she would hob-^ob once more.
Out of the window each wash, paste, and powder, she hurled,
And the god of the gra^e vowed to join;
Shook hards, signed and l^al^d, then bid fame tell the world.
The Union of Beauty and Wine.
ON A LADY's GIRDLE.
BY WALLER.
THAT which her slender waist confined,
Shall now my joyful temples bind:
No monarch but would give his crown,
His arms might do what this has done.
It was my heaven's extremest sphere,
The pale which held that lovely dear;
My joy, my grief, my hope, my love,
Did all withiu this circle move.
A narrow compass! and yet there
Dwelt all that is good, and all that is fair!
Give me but what this ^ibb^n bound,
Take all the rest the sun goes round.
SONG.
BY THE HON. MR. H --.
YE belles and ye flirts, and (...) pert little thin^
Who trip in this fr^^^^some round,
Pray tell me from whence this indecency spring
The sexes at once to confound;
What means the cocked ha^, and the masculi^^ air,
With each motion designed to perplex?
Brigh^ eyes ^ere intended to languish, not (...)
And s^f^ness the test of your sex.
The girl who on beauty depends for support,
May c^^l every art to her aid;
The b^som displayed, and ^he ^eticoat short,
Are samples she gives of her t^ade.
But you, on whom fortune indulg^^tly smi^^s,
And whom pride has preserved from the (...)
Should (...) attack us, with (...) and wiles,
Not with open and insolent air.
The Venus, whose (...) delights all mankind,
Shrinks modesty back from ^he v^w,
And kindly should seem by the artist designed
To serve as a model for you.
Th^n learn with her beauties to copy her air,
Nor venture too much to reveal;
Our fancies will paint with you cover with care,
And double each charm you conceal.
The blushes of morn, and the mildness of May,
Are charms which no art can procure;
Oh! be but yourselves, and our homage we pay,
And your empire is solid and sure.
But if Amazon like you attack your gallants,
And put us in fear of our lives,
You may do very well for sisters and aunts,
But, believe me, you will never be wives.
SONG.
Tune, -- I fixed my fancy on her.
BRIGHT Cynthia's power, divinely great.
What heart is not obeying?
A thousand Cupid's on her wait,
And in her eyes are playing,
She se^ms the queen of love to reign,
For she alone dispenses
Such sweets, as best can entertain
The gust of all the senses.
Her face a charming prospect brings,
Her breach gives balmy blisses.
I hear an angel when she sings,
And taste of heaven in kisses.
Four senses thus she feasts with joy,
From nature^s richest treasure;
Let me the other sense employ,
And I shall die with pleasure,
SONG.
WRITTEN BY CAPTAIN JACKSON.
AS pensive on the Severn's side,
Cleora, soon to be and bride,

Was ever so forlorn a m^id?
Y^^^^ you from her plaint could learn,

My Isidore, ah! when will Isido^e return
The panting swain her plainings heard,
And instant at her feet appeared;
But mark the cry^d ^ssembling fair,

A RIDDLE.
BY L -- W -- R --.
IN infancy I knew a spot,

Where seed was never sown:

(...) this fount a shady grove,
(...) lovely Venus dear:
Where all the loves and graces rove,
And Wanton all the year,
The only grove where Ida's dove,
Is known to build her nest:
Wherein the little god of love
Creeps, from his mother's breast.
A smoother plain beyond the fount
Extends than Tempe sweet,
Wherein appears a little mount,
Which Cupid makes his seat.
Two snowy mountains rise above,
Fairest beneath the skies:
Which Venus named the hills of love,
Because, when pressed they rise.
LYDY CHURNING.
BRIM full of love fat Lydy sat,
Cheeks like a blooming plum:
Sweating with all a maiden's strength,
To make the butter come.
In vain she churn'd, in vain she tried;
O, would our Roger come!
For nothing but a Roger's strength
Can make my butter come.
Within the pantry Roger skulk'd,
And heard this amorous hum;
Then fixing fast on Lydy'd churn,
He made her butter come.
Lydy cried out -- O Roger on --
That day may I be dumb,
If once I toil -- when you so soon
Can make my butter come.
SONG.
(Written at an early age.) BY THE D -- OF D --.
LONG time I Have enjoyed the soft transports of love.
I'^ bill'd like a sparrow, and coo'd like a dove;
In woodpine alcove, or in j^^samin bow'^
To many fond shepherds I Have ^^sten'd a^ hour;
But now for such p^^asu^es I care not a rush,
No bird's in the hand, but one in the b^sh.
Young Colin's caresse enspir'd me with joy,
And Damon's soft vows I thought never could cloy;
With each I have sa^in the fav'ri^e retreat,
And beheld with de^^ght each fond swa^n at my feet;
But now for ^uch pleasures I care not a rush,
No bird's in the hand, but one in the bush.
Gay Strephon declares I Am the girl to his mind,
If he proves sincere, I Will be constant and kind,
He vows that tomorrow he will make me his wife,
I Will fondly endeavor to bless him for life;
For all other swains now I care not a rush,
No bird's in the hand, but one in the bush.
SOFTLY. AN ODE FROM HAFEZ.
BY THE LATE CAPT. THOMAS FORD.
DISGUISED last night, I rushed from home,
I^^ seek the palace o^ my soul:
I rea^^'d ^y silent steps the dome,
And ^o her chamber softly stole.
On a gay various couch reclined,
In sweet re^cue, I saw the maid:
My breast, like aspins to the wind,
To love's alarm softly played.
Two fingers, then, to half expanse,
I trembl^ng opened -- ^ith fear oppressed
With th^se I pulled her veil ask ^nc^,
Th^n softly drew her to my breast.
"Who art thou wretch!" my angel cried;
Whispering, I said -- '^hy sl^ve: thy swai^^
But hush my love! forbear to ch^de:
Speak softly, lest some hear the strain."
Trembling with love, with hope and fear;
A ^^^ength her ^uby lips I pressed:
Swee^ kisses often -- mellifluous -- dear --
Softly I snatched -- was softly blessed.
"O let me," now inflan'd I said,
"My idol clasp within these arms;"
"Remove the light" -- deep sighed the maid --
"Comn softly, come -- prevent alarms."
Now by her side with bliss I glowed --
Swift flew the night in amorous play:
At length the morning herald crow'd;
When softly thence I bent my way.
SEEING IS BELIEVING. A TALE.
BY MR. H --
THOMAS came running to the mill,
As Will was standing at the door,
Would you believe it, neighbor Will?
Said Tom, my wife's an arrant whore.
With colors flying, dru^^ba a pare,
I left her very hard at work,
Tossing the 'Squire up in the air,
As if he had been made of cork,
You know the burden is not light,
He was not born to be a jockey,
And to add something to the weight,
His Worship was a little rocky.
From my relation I presume,
Neighbor, you will conclude and gather,
That he was in a plaguey fume,
And she all over in a lather.
I never thought; as I Am a sinner,
That Moll had any sporting blood,
Or any kind of mettle in her,
No more than in a log of wood.
At any moment of a day,
My wife, said Will, takes as much pains
I make her pockets ring and play,
Jingling her keys about like chains.
And yet no sempstress with a thimble,
That si^s all day upon her crupper,
Can be more mettlesome and nimble,
Or readier for it, after supper.
Where did you leave your wife? said he --
Behind yon' stack where she lies dry,
Run and peep through the hedge and see,
Said Tom, if she begin to fly.
Will run and peeped and then crept nigher,
And then cried, Thomas you're a liar.
I see them at it, and see clear,
It Is not your Moll, but my sweet Nell;
The devil, I hope, that brought her here,
Will carry her back with him to hell.
I knew, and would have laid my life;
Said Tom, if I had bid you go,
To see the pastime of your wife,
You would not run to see the show?
But you would scamper to the st^ck,
To s^e my w^fe upon her back.
The only way that I could act,
The only way I would advise,
And the best way to prove the f^ct,
Is to appeal to your own eyes.
SONG. She rose and loot me in.
THE night her silent sable wore,
And gloomy were the skies:
Of glittering stars appeared no more
Than those in Nelly's eyes.
When at her father's gate I knocked
Where I had often been,
She, shroud^d only with her smock,
Arose and loot me in.
Fast locked within her close embrace,
She trembling st^od ashamed;
Her s^elling bread, and glowing face,
And every touch inflamed.
My eager p^ssi^n^ I obeyed,
Res^lv'd the fo^t to win,
And her fo^d hear^ was soon betrayed,
To yield and let me in.
Then, then, beyond expressing,
Transporting was the joy:
I knew no greater blessing,
So blessed a man was I.
And she all ravished with delight,
B^d me of, came again;
And kindly vowed, that every night
She Would rise and let me in.
But al^ a l^st she p^ov'd with bairn,
And sighing sat and d^ll,
And I ha^ was as match concerned,
Locked even just like a fool.
Her lovely eyes with tears ran over,
Repenting her rash sin;
She sighed and cursed the fatal hour
That ever she loot me in.
But who could cruelly deceive,
Or from such beauty part?
I loved her so, I could not leave
The charmer of my heart!
But wedded, and concealed our crime:
Thus all was well again;
And now she thanks the happy time
That ever she loot me in.
THE BIRTH OF CUPID
By the D -- s of D --.
HERE in the bower of beauty, newly s^orn,
Let Fancy sit, and sing how Love was born;
Wrapped up in roses, Zephyr found the child
In Flaura's cheek, when first The goddess sinil'd;
Nursed on ^he bosom of the beautous Spring,
Over her white breast he spread his purple wing;
O^ k^ss^s fed and silver drops of dew,
The little wanton into Cupid grew;
Then armed his head with glittering sparks of fire,
And tipp'd his sh^n^ng arrows with desire;
Hence joy a^^se upon the wings of wind,
And hope pr^sen^s the lover always kind,
Despite (...) for our (...),
And ^^^der p^^y (...).
THE PROGRESS OF LOVE
TO Celia thus fond Damon said,
See, here is a mossy carpet laid;
And then her hand he pressed,
Free from the world's intruding eye,
Her lurks, my dear, no busy spy,
He looked -- and sighed the ^est.
She ftarted with a feign^d surprise,
While pleasure sparkl'd in her eyes;
Sure Damon does not mean --
The shepherd stopped her with a kiss,
And pressed her panting breast to his,
My dear we are not seen.
Then by a thousand kisses more,
A thousand tender oaths h^ swore,
His love should never end;
She called on all the powers above,
None heard her but the god of love,
And he was Damon's friend.
Is there then no help, she said.
By Damon thus to be betary'd?
Then hung her head and blushed,
O Damon, Damon, yet be good,
The shepherd smiled and swore he would,
she sighed and all was hushed.
SONG.
SOME love to range, so fond of change,
Variety's their shrine;
Each has his scheme, his favorite whim,
But woman, woman's mine.
The s^ftive bowl, and martial soul,
The miser I decline;
Like childish ^oys, to some their joys,
But lovely woman's mine.
With varicus arts she charms our hearts,
And makes this life divine;
For all the tricks of all the sex,
I Would still have woman mine.
Let Id^o^s, have, what is what they would have,
The sex they cannot define;
Just as she is, she is formed to please;
And long be woman mine.
The sparkling eye, the mel^ing sigh,
When heart and heart conjoin;
The bliss of love, all bliss above,
Make charming woman mine.
In pomp and state succed ye great
I Will envy nor repine;
If blessed with power to life's last hour,
To keep dear woman mine.
SONG. SUNG AT THE ANACREONTIC SOCIETY, BY MR. HOOR.
YE sons of Anacreon, as^ist me to sing
Of the fountain of Venus ^he ri^ule^ spring,
It Is a mystical mirror, though hidden from sight,
Can attract even age to the fount of delight;
For the soul lost in transport is wasted above,
When you dip in the fountain of Venus and Love.
For the soul, etc.

It dwells in a valley by moss cireled round,
And ^ho' ever plumb'd no bottom ever found;
And here the wild spendthrift is welcomed to range
If he drawn a recept by a mutual exchange;
It Is a spring of such sweets even stoics approve,
When they dip in the fountain of Venus and Love.
It Is a spring, etc.

The bank of this fountain's a beautiful r^^l;
Its verge is inviting, though danger^^^ ^o tread;
For often in convulsions it ebbs and it flows,
And never so pleased as when it tells what it knows;
It Is fierce in the conflict, yet meek as a dove,
If conquered the fountain of Venus and Love.
It Is fierce, etc.

The richest of nectar this fountain distills,
That lies at the foot of the fairest of hills,
And the blossom that is lost in comba^ing ^he suit,
Is often repa^'d with the ch^icest of fruit;
But vain is the ask which th^usands have strove,
To conquer the foun^ in of Venus and Love.
But vain, etc.

A LOGICAL SONG.
WHY, Chloe, thus squander your prime
In debate between sear and temptation?
If adu^terous love he a crime,
Why quarrel with plain fornication?
But your beau^ies with age you may lose:
Then seize ^he short moment of joy!
If not -- th^n with confidence use,
What by using you cannot destroy.
Come, come, bid your transports begin,
Ere we ^ose both our youth and our leisure.
Come, it is better repenting a sin,
Then regretting the loss of a pleasure.
CELIA VANQUISHED.
CELIA! you kill me, by ^he lord!.
You know I Have suff^^'d like a martyr
Nor have I yet had one kind word,
Nor s^en an inch above your garter.
Can you forget, ungrateful maid,
How long my constant shame has lasted
Wha^ nonsense have I sung and said,
What ink and paper have I wasted?
Ah, cruel nymph! you know full well,
With what a pure, becoming zeal,
I Have begged your snowy bosom's swell,
And every other swell to feel^
And round your taper waist to twine,
Each inlet of delight to prove!
Our hearts, our lips, our souls to join!
And can you still, still doubt my love?
What, unconv^nc'd? the Devil's in it!
Well then, this proof shall calm your fear
And if one warm expressive minute
Speak not more love than days of tears.
Unless each palpitating nerve,
Each kindling vein confess me true,
Treat me at length as I deserve,
And banish me from joy and you!
ANSWER.
BE quiet, Sir! be gone, I say!
Lord bless us! how you romp and tear There!
I swear!
Now you have left my bosom bare!
I do not like such boisterous play,
So tsake that fancy hand away --
Why now, you, re^^uder than before!
Nay, I Will b^ hanged If I comply. --
Fie!
I Will cry!
Oh -- I cannot bear it -- I shall die! --
I vow I Will never see you more!
But -- are you sure you have shut the door?
DICK AND DOLL. A SONG,
BY G. A. STEVENS.
Tune: -- I Am like a skiff on the ocean tossed.
AS one bright summer's sultry day,
For sake of shade I sought the grove
Through thickset-hedge, on top of hay,
I met with mutual love:
A youth with one arm found his pretty girl's waist,
On small swelling breasts he his other hand placed,
While she cried, "Dick, be still
"Pray, tell me what is your will?"
"I come (quoth Dick) to have some chat,"
And close to here is his lips he squeezed
"I guess (cries Doll) what you would be at,
"But now I will not be teased"
She strove to rise up, but his strength held her down,
She called out for help! and petitioned the clown,
"O Dick! dear Dick! le^ me rise,
"The sun puts out my eyes.
"I Will tear your soul out! -- Lord! these men,
"If ever -- well -- I will not submit --
"Why? what? the devil! -- Curse me then; --
"You Will fli^g me in a fit."
Down, lik^ a be^^ lily, her head dropo'd aslant,
Her eyes lost the daylight, her breath became scant:
And, feebly, on her tongue
Expiring accents hung.
The chorus birds sung over their heads,
The breeze blew rustling through the grove,
Some smelt the hay on new mown meads,
All seemed the scene of love.
Dick offered t^ lift up the lass as she lay,
A look, full of tenderness, told him to stay;
"So soon, Dick, will you go?
"I wish -- dear me! -- heigh ho!"
Vibrating with heart heaving sighs,
Her tucker trembling to and fro,
Her crimson cheeks, her glist'ning eyes,
Proclaimed possession's glow,
Dick bid her farewell; but, she languishing, cried,
As wanton she played by her fallen shepherd's side!
"A moment! pray, sit still,
"Since now you have had your will."
"Lord! cries the girl, you hasty men,
"Of love afford but one poor proof;
"Our fowls at home, each sparrow hen
" Is ten time^ be'ter off. --
"No! that you should not, had I known your design,
"But, since you have had your will, pray let me have mine;
"So, once more, ere we rise,
"Do, dear Dick, save my eyes."
THE HONEY MOON. AN ODE.
COME, Cytherea, with thy doves,
And all thy tra^n of l^ttle loves,
Come from Idalia's pleasing shade,
For joy and amorous frolicks made;
Come and assist an artless tune,
Which strives to virble forth the Honey-Moon,
When Hymen does the pair unite,
And promises supreme delight;
With spa^kling torch comes bright to view;
And points at ^aptures great and new;
What pleasure is expected soon!
Then, then! comes on the pleasing Honey-Moon.
Cynthia the virgin goddess bright,
With greater speed rides down the night;
Her modesty betrays her hear^,
Shows in such sports she would take a part;
But that her wish she dares not own,
Or Jove with her wou^d have an Honey-Moon,
'An Honey-Moon!' cries simpering miss,
'I wonder much w^at's mean by this!
'I have all sweets quite n^ar me bandy,
'Is Honey-Moon like sugar candy?'
The j^yful ^^me will tell you ^^ou,
When you will bless the happy Honey-Moon
Ah! then those sweets, unknown before,
Will make you long dear miss, for more;
Will make you lick your sips, and cry,
'Till now, O what a fool was I!
'What pleasing ^ouches! -- what a tune
'Can e're ^e played that is like the Honey-Moon.
Could but the virgin, in her teens,
Tell what the joys of wedlock means:
She would not long the bliss dalay,
But with the first dear youth away;
On Venus' bed would tumble down,
And their prolong the charming Honey-Moon.
When heaving breasts delightful rise,
And (...) with sof^ extatic sighs!
When folding arms fond arms embrace,
And love seems furious for the chase;
U^umber'd joys the pair must crown,
Who then begin the pleasing Honey-Moon.
Ah! then encounter breast with breast,
And tenderest accents are ^^prest;
"My love, I melt! I bu^n! I bust!
The next is better than the first;
And so progressive they go on,
To make a heaven of the Honey-Moon.
Then all that youthful poets dream,
Beneath the shade, or by the stream,
Is realiz'd and certain found,
Beyond imagination's bound;
All that can please is fel^, or shown,
During the happy time of Honey-moon.
Then haste, ye youths, and haste, ye fair,
Love's banquet of delight to share;
Advance to Hymen's sacred fane,
A rich reward you will surely gain;
Each rapture will attend you soon,
And give you all the joys of Honey-Moon.
EPIGRAM.
BY I. -- D M -- Y.
AS Lydia on a bank reclining lay,
Young Lubin stole one half her charms away:
The lovely maid, her honor to preserve.
Drew back, and treated him with cold reserve.
But he, more amorous grown, now pressed her hand,
The more he pressed, the less she could withstand;
Vanquished, in excess of blis^ her all she lost. --
And with a boy soon made him pay the cost!
ON A LADY'S WEDDING BEING ON THE TWENTY-FIRST OF DECEMBER,
BY C -- F --.
RETURNED from the op'ra, as lately I sat,
Indiff'rently chatting of this thing and that,
My Chloe I asked, how it entered her head,
To fix on St. Thomas's, of all days to wed?
To which she replied, with reason the strongest,
"Though shortest the day is -- the night, Sir, is longest."
DON PRINGELLO's TALE. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE HOLY NUNS; OR THE MONK'S WISE
JUDGMENT.
BY MR. H -- LL.
THERE is a noble town called Ghent,
A city famous for its wares,
For priests and nuns, and Flanders mares,
And for the best of fish in lent.
There you may see, threatening destruction,
A hundred forts and strong redoubts,
Just like Vauban's with ins and outs,
And cover'd-ways of love's destruction.
In one, constructed as above,
There dwelt two nuns of the same age,
Joined like two birds in the same cage,
Both by necessity and love.
In towns of idleness and sloth,
Where the chief trade is tittle tattle,
Though pri^^^s are commoner than cattle,
They had out one between them both.
Our nuns should have had two at least,
In Ghent they are common as great guns;
Which made it hard upon our nuns,
And harder still upon the priest.
But he was worthy of all praise.
With spreading shoulder and a chest,
A leg, a chin, and all the rest,
Like Hercules of the Farnese.
Amongst the nuns there was a notion,
That these two sisters were assigned
To him, for a severer kind
Of penitential devotion.
His penance lasted a whole year,
And he had such a piece of work;
If it had been for turning Turk,
It could not have been more severe.
Our nuns, which is no common case,
Living together without jangling;
All of a sudden fell a wrangling,
About precedence and place.
They both with spleen were like to burst,
Like two proud misses when they sight,
At an assembly, for the right
Of being taken out the first.
Before the priest they made this clatter,
Between them both he was perplexed
And studied to find out a text,
To end the controverted matter.
Children, said he, schraching his sconce
I should be better pleased than you,
Could I divide myself in two,
And satisfy you both at once.
Angels, perhaps, may have such powers
But it is fix and seasonable,
That you should be more reasonable
Whilst you're with beings such as ours.
Be friends and listen to the teacher:
Cease your vain clamours and despute,
Be ye as fishes mute,
Before Saint Anthony the preacher.
To end at once all disputation,
I Will set my back against that gate,
And there produce, erect and straight,
The cause of all your altercation.
But first, you both shall hooded be,
Both so effectually blinded,
'Twill be impossible to find it,
Except by chance or sympathy.
Which of you first be it agreed,
The rudder of the church can seize,
Like Peter's vicar with his keys,
Shall keep the helm; and heave the lead;
She shall go first, I mean to say,
And have precedence every day.
The nuns were tickled with the jest,
They were content; and he contrived,
To give the helm, for which they strived,
To her that managed it the best.
KISSING. A SONG.
BY C. A. STEVENS.
Tune, -- In pursuit of some lambs from my stocks that had strayed.
YE delicate lovelies, with leave, I maintain,
That happiness here you may find:
To yourselves I appeal for felicity's reign,
When you meet with a man to your mind.
When gratitude friendship to fondness unites,
Inexpressive endearments arise;
Then hopes, fears, and fancies, strange doubts and delights.
Are announc'd by those tell-tale the eyes.
Those technical terms, in the science of love,
Cold schoolmen attempt to describe;
But how should they paint what they never can prove,
For tenderuess knows not their tribe.
Of all the abuse on enjoyment that is thrown,
The treatment love takes most amiss,
Is the rant of a coxcomb, the sot, and the clown.
Who pretend to indulge on a kiss.
The love of a fribble at self only aims:
For sots and clowns -- class them with beasts
No fiber, to atom, have they in their frames,
To relish such delicate feast.
In cireling embr^^^s, when lips to lips move.
(...), oh! teach me to praise,
The (...) to the Op'ra of love --
(...) empty would laugh at the phrase.
(...) preludes are kisses, and, after the play,
They fill up the pause of delight:
The rich repetitions, which never decay,
The lips silent language at night.
The raptures of k.issing we only can taste,
When sympathies equal inspire;
And while to enjoyment, unbounded, we haste,
Their breath blows the coals of desire.
Again, and again, and again beauty sips;
What feelings these pressures excite!
When fleeting life's stopped by a kiss of the lips,
Then sinks in a sigh of delight.
SONG.
BY THE SAME.
WHENEVER, Chloe, I begin
Your heart, like mine, to move,
You tell me of the crying sin,
Of unchaste lawless love.
How can that passion be a sin,
Which gave to Chloe birth?
How can those joys but be divine,
Which make a heaven on earth?
To wed, mankind the priests trepanned
By some sly fallacy,
And disobeyed God's great command,
"In crease and multiply!"
You say that love's a crime; content:
Yet this al^ow you must,
More joy's in heaven, if one repeat,
Than over ninety just.
Sin then, dear girl, for heaven's sake,
Repent, and be forgiven;
Bless me, and by repentance make
A holy day in heaven.
TO LYDIA.
BY THE D -- E OF D --.
LOVELY Lydia! lovely maid!
Ei her rose in thee's displayed;
Roses of a blushing red,
Over thy lip^ and cheeks are shed;
Roses of a balmy hue
In ^hy fairer charms we view.
Now thy braided hair unbind;
Now luxuriant, unconfined
Le^ ^hy wavy tresses flow;
Tresses bright, of burnished glow
Brave thy every neck my fair!
Now thy snowy shoulders bear:
Bid the vivid lust^e rise,
In thy passion streaming eyes;
See, the lucent meteors gleam!
See, they speak with wish^ul flame!
And how gracefully above,
Modeled from the bow of love,
Are thy arching brows displayed,
^oft'ning in a sable shade!
Let a warmer crimson streak
The (...) of thy downy check;
Let thy lips, that breathe perfume,
(...) purple now assume:
Give me little billing kisses,
(...) with murmuring blisses.
^^^^t my love! -- my angel, stay! --
S^^t! you suck my breath away;
Drink the life-drops of my heart!
Draw my soul from every part:
Scarce my senses can sustain
So much pleasure, so much pain!
Hide thy broad voluptuous breast!
Hide that balmy heaven of rest!
See, to fea^t the enamored eyes,
How the snowy hillocks rise!
Parted by the luscious vale,
Whence luxurious sweets exhale:
Nature framed thee but^' inspire
Never-ending fond desire!
Again, above its envious vest,
See, thy bosom heaven confessed!
Hide the rapturous dear delight!
Hide it from my ravished sight!
Hide it! -- for through all my soul,
Tides of madd'ning transport roll:
Venting now the impassioned sigh,
See me languish, see me die!
Tear no^ from me then thy charms!
Snatch, oh! snatch me, to thy arms!
With a life inspiring kiss,
Wake my sinking soul to bliss!
