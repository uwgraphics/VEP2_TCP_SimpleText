UPON THE DEATH of that Reverend and Aged Man of GOD, Mr. SAMUEL ARNOLD, Pastor
of the CHURCH at Marshfield, who deceased in the 71 st Year of his Age, and of
his Ministry the 36 th, September 1. 1693.
I.
WHEN Lights go out, Darkness succeeds;
Is this sad Marshfield's Case?
Ah! little, little, little know
We who succeeds in Place
II.
Of Arnold dead. This Star is set,
But where the next will rise
With Amplitude, how long his Course,
Cannot Astrophil devise.
III.
Thy Glory, Marshfield, is eclip'd,
Thy Sun has run his Race:
Melpomene may traced be
By Tears on every Face.
IV.
Long has Heaven frowned upon thy Seat:
A Trine of Glory late,
^
Great Winslow thou did rate
V.
As peerless once: But he is removed;
Thy Bourn is late drawn dry;
And brin^sh Tears now stain thy Face,
At Arnold's mourning high.
VI.
This Tri^e in thee did lately shine;
Beams borrowed from above
Did gild their Visibilia,
darted from the God of Love.
VII.
Concentrick are there Motions all,
(...) Spheres;
(...) and Hands engaged,
^
VIII.
^

IX.
(...) are placed on Thrones most bright,
(...) in due Time return,
(...) to judge
All tha^ the Gospel spurn.
X.
(...) last but not the least
(...) now ascends,
(...) Robes of Righteousness
Wh^^ Glory never ends.
XI.
(...), strong Love in him did f^me.
(...) Man large and ready.
Sharp Eye, strong Hand did steer his Course
In Piety most steady.
XII.
Strong Love to Christ, and to his Flock,
Did waste this Shepherd's Life;
Zealous for Truth he did appear,
Yet was no Man of Strife,
XIII.
Except with Sin and Errors foul,
Which felt his Heat and Flame;
A Flame Divine, which Lightning like,
Sin's Bones could pierce and Tame.
XIV.
The proud aspiring callous Brawn
Of bold Enthusiasts,
Religiously Sarcastical,
The Quakers he often blasts;
XV.
And stops their Mouths with Scripture Gag,
Makes them as mute as Sheep,
If in their ranging Circuit,
Into his Fold they peep.
XVI.
P^ter and John were Fishermen,
Arnold was of that Trade;
Each had his Hooks and Nets, but at
Christ's Call aside them laid.
XVII.
All Three much Fish d^d catch and ^ill,
But Men did catch and save,
Hence Crowns beset with Gems (...)
Their Exit from the Grave.
XVIII.
Amos, an Herdman once, was called
To fill a Prophet's Place;
And he that sat on Isr^^l^s Throne,
Was first old Jesse's Race.
XIX.
Arnold once hewing senseless Blocks,
Wild Olives here did polish,
And fixed them in Jehovah's House,
Which Time shall never abolish
XX.
Arnold, a Man of heavenly Words,
An heavenly Man in Deeds,
In Heaven it self full Christ enjoys,
No earthly Thing he needs.
XXI.
God grant this Candlestick may hold
Another Star as bright,
Whose Rising made our Midnight Noon,
Whose Setting brought our Night
XXII.
Grant, Lord, the Widow his Relict
May not sink down in Grief;
Let her and hers from thee receive
Each Days Joys and Relief.
Samuel Arnold. Anagram, Leave old Arm's.
OLD Arm's leave, and new take up,
For thou have drunk Death's bitter^st Cup.
Death has thee stung, Christ has it slain,
And thou ^halt surely rise again,
In Robe ^oft white, washed in Christ's Blood,
Which (...) and chiefest Good.
HOW solitary seems that (...)
Which Arnold's Presence are did grace?
What Ecc^o from that Pulpit sounds,
Whence Arnold preached Christ's bleeding Wounds?
The Sovereign Balm for Sinners great,
The Ru^^ of Abaddon's Seat.
Methink^ I see, methinks I hear
That (...) groan and drop a Tear
At Arnold Exit, fearing, vexed,
And with ^ad Sorrows much (...),
Who shall succeed; and of what (...)
The Man shall be that takes his Chair;
Whether a Text-man or a Drone,
Whether a Substantive alone,
Or one that is an Adjective,
Wh^ d^^h by others Labors Thrive.
Grant, (...) Sheep may now unite
To beg (...) Beams of Light
Wherein they may unite, ag^^e
To choose ^or them, and choose with Thee;
To choose a Man that can sup^ly
The Place of Arnold mounted high.
Pour down thy Spirit on tha^ Fold,
And let that Candles^ick soon hold
A Star of the first Magnitude,
Endowed with Grace's Plenitude.
Thy Throne, O God, do thou build up;
Soon take from them this bitter Cup,
Which they now drink. Let them rejoice
To see and hear their Shepherd's Voice.
Ichabod Wiswell.

MR. Samuel Arnold, The late faithful Preacher of the GOSPEL at Marshfield, Who
left Earth for Heaven, September 1. 1693. his last FAREWELL to the World.
Written by himself not long before his Death.
V^^N World wherein I for a Time did dwell,
I heartily unto thee bid Farewell.
My Time in thee draws near unto an End;
Jehovah to Thy Self O do Thou bend
My Soul, that it may soar and mount aloft.
With Eagle's wings, on high to thee as often,
As I with Nature's Sinkings am attended,
My strong Desire to Thee let be extended.
Thou art my Hope, my Help, my Joy, my Rest,
My Sanctuary when with Grief oppressed.
In all my Pilgrimage I have thee found
In Loving Kindness to me to abound.
In England old I first did draw my Breath,
And there I might have been a Man of Death;
But God me brought over the roaring Seas,
Into his Wilderness, where he did please
Make allure, and to him draw my Heart
(...) Grace, to choose him for my Part;
(...) Changes (...) with me
(...) unchangeably to be.
I (...) had upon the Sea,
(...) Providence called there to be;
And (...) Time appointed he did call
Me ^or to leave the Ship, and Nets, and all
Employments secular, to serve his Name,
In catching Men, by lifting up the ^ame
Of blessed JESUS, our Immanuel,
To draw poor Sinners with him for to dwell:
In which high (...) he has me sustain^d,
His Power and Mercy have with me remain^d
Year^ Thirty five, though Flesh and Heart have failed
Often ^imes, and Weaknes^ has (...) prevailed
O Lord!
Let all my ^ins by thee forgotten be;
Iniq^^^^ in me O do not see.
Let (...) poor Labors (...)
Which with my Heart I offer^d have to thee;
Let them not be forgot, but let them spring,
When I translated am with thee to sing.
Let my dear Fam'ly in thy Sight find Grace;
Among them that fear thee let them find a Place.
And let my Flock supplied be by thee,
When I shall cease them for to ^o oversee.
Let God's Jerusalem exalted be;
A Praise in the Earth, O let them be to thee.
Let Babel fall, and all ^hine Enemies
Incurable Destruction them surprise.
When thou shall call me hence, O let my Soul
Inable^ be it self on thee to roll:
And so to launch into Eternity,
That I thy Self in Christ may (...) enjoy.
FINIS.
