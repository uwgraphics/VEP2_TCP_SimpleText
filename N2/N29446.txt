At A COUNCIL Held at Boston, January the 3d. 1677.
WHereas the Holy God, who out of his tender mercy and bowels of Compassion
has preserved this People, and these Churches from the Malice and Rage of
their Enemies, and of those that devised Mischief against them, and thereby
bespoken his own praise in that to this day we remain a People, that out of his
very Faithfulness, does continue to afflict us, as with the remainder of the
Heathen, yet in Hostility with us, so also with that sore Distemper of the
Small Pox (daily increasing in our principal Towns, and severely threatening us
in this winter season) and thereby lately bereaving us of that most eminently
Learned, Pious and Faithful Servant of Jesus Christ Mr. Thomas Shepard Pastor
to the Church of Christ in Charlstown; the continuance of our Messengers in
England, and their Negotiation therein; and the dissettlement of the College
contrary to our hopes and expectation: one also cause of our serious
application to God, besides the consideration of that little advantage the body
of the Lords People in this Wilderness have obtained by the late passed Woes
and Miseries he has brought upon us; thereby frustrateing his declared
intention of such Affliction, viz. to Humble us, and Prove us, and do us good
in the latter end: The joint consideration of these things have moved the
COUNCIL to set apart the one and twentieth of February next, to be kept as a
day of solemn Humiliation and Prayer unto God, and invocation of his Holy Name,
if possible we may meet him in the way of his Judgment, and obtain
reconciliation with him; the settlement of our remaining troubles at home,
right understanding and favor with the Kings Majesty, and the turning of our
hearts unto God, and to each other, that the Lord may yet vouchsafe his
presence with us:

And do therefore Inhibit all Servile Labor on that Day, and commend it to all
Churches, Ministers and People throughout this Jurisdiction, solemnly and
seriously to keep the same accordingly.

By the COUNCIL Edward Rawson, Secr't.
