MENTORIA; OR THE YOUNG LADY'S FRIEND. IN TWO VOLUMES.

BY MRS. ROWSON, OF THE NEW-THEATRE, PHILADELPHIA: AUTHOR OF THE INQUISITOR,
FILLE DE CHAMBER, VICTORIA, CHARLOTTE, etc. etc.

Detested be the pen whose baneful influence
Could to the youthful docile mind convey
Pernicious precepts, tell loose tales,
And paint illicit passion in such colors,
As might mislead the unsuspecting heart,
And vitiate the young unsettled judgment.
I would not for the riches of the Past,
Abuse the noblest gifts of heaven thus,
Or sink my Genius to such prostitution.
VOL. I.

PREFACE.
OF all the foolish actions a person can commit, I think that of making an
apology for a voluntary error, is the most ridiculous; therefore, though I have
taken up my pen to write a preface, I am utterly at a loss what to say.

If it is true that "Good wine needs no bush, and a good play no Epilogue,"
then must it be equally certain, that a good book requires no preface -- and
this assertion acknowledged to be true, in what an awkward predicament do I
stand, since to publish this work without a preface, will be tacitly to infer,
that it is good and needs no recommendation, and so be deservedly censured as a
conceited scribler.

Should I write a preface and condemn the performance, confess it has
innumerable faults, and request the reader's pity and patience, I not only
prepossess them against it, but acknowledge myself an idiot, for suffering it
to meet the public eye, in such an imperfect state. What then am I to say, or
how fill up those few pages necessary to be placed at the beginning of a book?

Shall I tell the reader my design in publishing these volumes? I will; It was
an anxious desire to see all my dear country-women as truly amiable as they are
universally acknowledged beautiful; it was a wish to convince them that true
happiness can never be met with in the temple of dissipation and folly, she
flies the glare of fashion, and the midnight revel, and dwells only in the
heart conscious of performing its duty, and is the constant companion of those,
who, content with the station in which it has pleased Providence to place them,
entirely free from envy or malice, make it their whole study to cultivate those
amiable virtues which will render them at once beloved, admired and esteemed,
by all who know them.

Whether I have executed this design well or ill, must be hereafter determined,
not only by those partial friends whose kind encouragement prompted me to
submit these pages to the inspection of the public: but, a-well-a-day for me, I
must also be judged by some sage critic, who, "with spectacle on nose, and
pouch by's side," with lengthened visage and contemptuous smile, sits down to
review the literary productions of a woman. He turns over a few pages, and then
Catching the Author at some that or therefore,
At once condemn her without why or wherefore,


Then, alas! what may not be my fate? whose education, as a female, was
necessarily circumscribed, whose little knowledge has been simply gleaned from
pure nature, and who, on a subject of such importance, write as I feel, with
enthusiasm.

I have taken the liberty of placing a poem at the beginning of the work, which
was published some few years since in the novel Victoria, and as many parents
utterly forbid their daughters reading any of that species of writing, I
thought I should readily be excused for introducing it here.

I must confess, I have neither sufficient conceit or fortitude to enable me to
hear, unmoved, the decision of judicious criticism; yet, conscious that I never
wrote a line that would convey a wrong idea to the head, or a corrupt wish to
the heart, I sit down satisfied with the purity of my intentions, and leave it
to the happy envied class of mortals, who have received a liberal education, to
write with that taste and elegance which can only be acquired by a thorough
knowledge of the classics.

THE YOUNG LADY'S FRIEND.
VERSES, ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY, ON HER LEAVING SCHOOL.
I WISH not, Anna, to offend,
But write the language of a friend;
For though my dear from school you're freed,
You Have entered on a task indeed;
To act, as you proceed through life,
As daughter, mother, friend, and wife.
No doubt, within the school confined,
Your charming lively active mind,
By fancy's aid, contrived to dress,
Gay painted scenes of happiness;
And thought in all your future hours,
To find your pathway strewn with flowers,
Ah! lovely maid, too soon you will find
Your happiest days are left behind!
To grief and sorrow we were born,
Each flow'er we see conceals a thorn;
Like traitors, who, with hidden dart,
First soothe and win, then wound the heart.
Though life is an uneven road,
And though uncertain our abode,
Within this fragile house of clay,
Yet there are means to smooth the way;
From my experience dearly bought,
Blush not, my Anna to be taught.
And first, dear girl, each morn and even
Lift up your spotless soul to heaven,
The power who gave you life adore,
His wrath appease, his grace implore;
It Is our first duty; next to this,
Study your earthly parents bliss.
Increase their joys, soothe all their cares,
And have no wish, no will but theirs;
Whatever they bid you do or say
Dispute not, cheerfully obey
Their just commands, and if severe,
Remonstrate only with a tear:
For though unkindness grieves the heart,
Submission is a daughter's part.
Part of your happiness depends
On a judicious choice of friends.
If ever your heart's by grief oppressed,
Repose it in a mother's breast;
To her each secret thought impart,
Use no disguise, detest all arts;
Be candid, open and sincere,
A mother's love you cannot fear,
She Will be a kind and faithful friend,
And teach you how each fault to mend,
To others be polite and kind,
But cautious how you speak your mind:
Yet should it be your fate to meet,
A woman prudent and discreet.
Whose tongue to slander never was prone,
Who makes your joys and griefs her own,
Prize her, for it is from bounteous heaven
The choicest gift that can be given.
In friendship with the other sex
Be cautious, they are apt to vex;
Nor vainly think that you shall prove
The pleasures of Platonic love:
It is a phantom in the way,
To lead poor thoughtless girls astray.
Though man by nature was designed,
A guardian for weak woman kind,
Endowed with reason, sense and care,
To shield from wrong the helpless fair,
No sooner did the tyrant see
Woman from every blemish free,
Than heedless of his guardian part,
He strove, by mean seductive art,
To rob her of her brightest charms,
To fill her breast with wild alarms,
Reversed kind nature's gentle plan,
And woman's now the slave of man.
To lovers act with modest spirit,
Treat them according to their merit;
Encourage not, from foolish pride;
Fifty to dangle at your side:
But if you do not like a man,
Dismiss him gently as you can;
Thank him, but say 'twould be in vain,
Ever to urge his suit again.
But if the man whom you approve,
Should softly tell a tale of love;
Let your flushed cheek and downeast eye
In silence modestly reply;
Yet don't too easily believe,
For man, my Anna, will deceive,
If to misfortune's school you're brought,
Sad sorrow's lesson to be taught;
If forced from your dear parent's side,
To pass through life without a guide;
Be circumspect, be cautious, then,
Beware of all, but most of men.
For they will study to betray,
And make our helpless sex their prey;
From virtue's bright refulgent throne
With baleful hand will drag you down;
Dishonor first, then leave to mourn
Those blessings which can never return.
As the young bird who from the nest,
Its mother's fost' ring wings and breast
Timidly ventures through the air,
Far from the tender parent's care;
If chance some hawk beholds it fly,
He views it with an eager eye,
Pursues, and clench'd within his power,
It falls, poor bird, to rise no more
When once the nuptial knot is tied,
And my sweet girl becomes a bride,
Be it your care to keep your own
The heart your virgin sweetness won.
Kind to his friends and those he loves,
Be sure to like whom he approves.
Let neatness over your dress preside,
Let prudence all your actions guide;
Far from your bosom ever chase
The green-ey'd fiend, and in its place
Encourage mutual confidence;
For jealousy, if not driven hence,
Will on your inmost vitals prey,
And steal your soul's repose away.
To servants gentlest usage give,
It Is hard enough that they must live
In servitude, without ill nature,
From those they serve, a fellow creature,
Though placed in ever such low degree,
Feels grief and pain as well as we.
In every station seek not wealth,
Nor pray for aught save peace and health;
For by mankind it is confessed
The middle sphere is still the best,
Contentment there her throne will six,
And fly the gilded coach and six.
If ever your heart feels joy sincere,
'Twill be to dry affliction's tear;
To visit the distressed and poor,
And chase pale famine from their door.
To humble merit be a friend,
The character, aspersed, defend.
While Anna thus her time employs,
Pure and unmixed will be her joys;
Time, thus improved, glides gently on,
Nor will you find one day too long.
And when at length the hand of death,
Shall steal away your vital breath,
The ghastly king shall only be,
A messenger of joy to thee,
To take thee from this, world below,
To one where joys ne'ercease to flow.
Placed on a throne and robbed in white,
Too glorious far for mortal sight,
Joining the angels heavenly lays,
Glorious immortal hymns of praise.
HISTORY OF MENTORIA.
MENTORIA, or rather Helena Askham, was the only child of a brave soldier, who,
though born to move in but an humble sphere, had courage, magnanimity, and
fortitude, that might have become a staff officer, but he never rose to higher
rankthan a sergeant, in which station he acquitted himself with so much honor
that he was universally esteemed by his superiors, and beloved by his equals.
He was, at an early age, married to the daughter of a reputable tradesman, who
preferring the hardships of war, to a separation from her husband, resolutely
followed him to every campaign. It was at the frege of Quebec, that our gallant
veteran was wounded and left dead on the field: his faithful partner, unable to
support the shocking tidings which were abruptly conveyed to her, fell into
premature labor, and in giving birth to a female infant, rendered up her own
life.

Colonel Dormer was acquainted with the circumstance, and determined to protect
the poor little orphan -- ordered it to be provided with a nurse; and when he
wrote to England, informed his sister, Lady Winworth, of the charge he had
undertaken, requesting she would permit the little Helena to be sent over to be
educated with her daughters. Her ladyship acquiesced, and Helena arrived safe
in England, when only two years old, and was immediately admitted into the
nursery among the little Winworths, and as she grew up enjoyed with them the
benefit of a polite and liberal education.

The young Lord Winworth, as he advanced toward manhood, could not behold the
young orphan without some emotions of tenderness, Helena was pleasing in her
person, and elegant in her manners, but she was endowed with discernment and
sense far superior to the generality of young women of her age. She possessed
sensibility enough to be unable to listen with coldness and inattention to the
ardent professions of a young nobleman, who to the advantages of birth and
fortune, added a prepossessing figure, and every polite accomplishment -- but
she knew that he was extremely young, and that, in all probability, however
eager at that time to enter into indissoluble engagements, he would hereafter
repent his precipitancy, and regret that he had not matched with one more
suitable in rank and fortune. She also reflected that she should, by accepting
him, disappoint the hopes of his mother, and prove herself ungrateful to a
woman who had ever treated; her with maternal tenderness, "And shall I," said
she, for the gratification of a passion which has perhaps arose from childish
fondness, and only gains strength by not being opposed, entail on myself the
anger of my best benefactors, and lay myself open to the sneers of the world,
by matching so far above my expectations, nay, will not my husband be laughed
at for raising a poor orphan to his rank and title. I am determined to stifle
this rising passion, and to inform my Lady of the unfortunate attachment of her
son.

This judicious resolution she immediately put in execution. Lady Winworth
listened to her with a mixture of surprise and admiration. "My dear Helena,"
said she, "you shall never want a friend while I exist. This generous conduct
has rendered you more amiable than ever. My son is but a boy, I will send him
abroad, and in all human probability a few years spent at some of the gayest
Courts in Europe, will entirely eradicate this youthful penchant."

When the young gentleman was informed of his mother's desire that he should
travel, he flew to Helena, and earnestly entreated her to consent to a private
marriage before his departure. She laughed at his importunity, though her
little heart was ready to rebel, and she sound to laugh (however repugnant to
her feelings) was the only way to avoid an affecting interview. Her mirth
piqued him, "You do not love me, Helena," said he. "I never told you I did, my
Lord." "But your looks, your actions, have contributed to make me think you
did." "Why, my good Lord," said she smiling, "I do love you most
affectionately, and wish for nothing more than to see you happy." "Then why not
consent to our immediate union?" cried he eagerly." Because I love you as a
brother, and hope to see you, when you return, married to some lady of birth,
merit, and fortune, and to figure as bride-maid on the occasion."
"Unaccountable girl," said he, peevishly, "then only promise me to remain
single till my return." "Indeed I shall not, my Lord, for I have no intention
to wear a willow garland; and sure I am, that should I make such a promise, we
should both repent it before the year was out." "Nay, Madam," said he, angrily,
"if you are of so light a disposition -- " "It is even so," cried she, with
affected vivacity, "therefore, as you are warned, pray beware, and think no
more of so trifling and inconstant a character."

When Helena retired to her own apartment, she gave free vent to her feelings;
and in order to avoid the pain of parting, requested permission of Lady
Winworth, to pay a visit to a young lady, who lived some miles from town. The
old Lady saw the propriety of her request, and immediately granted it. She
therefore departed the next morning, leaving only a card, wishing his lordship
health and much pleasure in the course of his travels. So striking a proof of
her indifference increased his resentment, and he left England without any of
those pangs which he imagined he should suffer when separated form his Helena.

The event proved that Helena was right; for when Lord Winworth returned, he
brought with him a bride, lovely, amiable, and his equal in rank and fortune.
When his lordship left England, he took with him a young gentleman, as a
traveling companion; this gentleman did not see Helena previous to his
departure, but at his return, charmed with her innocent vivacity and judicious
conduct, requested permission to pay his addresses; which was immediately
granted, and on their union he was presented with a post under government,
which he enjoyed till his death.

Helena being then left in rather straitened circumstances, was requested to
become governess to the daughters of Lord Winworth; she consented, on condition
that they might be permitted to retire with her into the country. His lordship
purchased a estate in Wales, and thither she retired with her young charge.

On the death of his wife, Lord Winworth requested her to bring his girls to
town, and become their conductor in public, as she had been their preceptress
in private: but this she resolutely refused.

On the separation of the young ladies from their kind, almost materna. end,
they requested a continued correspondence might be kept up between them.
Mentoria was the appellation they had ever given her, and under this name was
the correspondence commenced.

As her letters are interspersed with entertaining tales apposite to the
subjects on which she wrote, I have avoided giving any of the young ladies'
letters, as they would only prove an interruption to the general design.

LETTER I. MENTORIA, TO THE MISS WINWORTHS.
AFTER being accustomed to the society of my dear Miss Winworths for fifteen
years, how solitary and comfortless is my situation. I every day feel my loss
more severely. I look at the harpsichord, and expect my Sophia to come and
practice her favorite lessons. I take up a book, and almost unknown to myself,
call on Emily to read some passage that pleases or interests me. I miss the
dear lively sallies of Gertrude, and the innocent prattle of Letitia: but
though I so severely feel the privation of your beloved society, I am not so
selfish as to wish you again in the shades of Cambray. I am certain of the
necessity of your taking a part in the active scenes of life, and as your dear
mother is now no more, your father will necessarily require the cheerfulness of
his children to brighten his solitary hours, and it was but just that my
beloved girls should appear in the station they were born to ornament.

I highly comment the prudence of your father, in taking Mrs. Clairville into
his family, to be your chaperons on your first entrance into fashionable
circles. She is a woman who has seen a great deal of polite life, has ever
retained an unblemished reputation, and though reduced by misfortune to be glad
to accept the situation your father offered her, has ever been received as a
guest whose presence conferred an obligation, by some of the first families in
England.

Though separated from you, I shall, as you desire, still continue your
preceptress, and shall not at any time scruple to tell you of your faults; for
partial as I am to your virtues, I am by no means blind to those errors to
which human nature is ever subject, and which, if not timely eradicated, will
gain an ascendancy over your mind, and entirely hide those amiable qualities,
which at present form the most striking traits in your character.

And to begin -- I feel myself greatly hurt and offended by the letter I
received from Gertrude, since your arrival in London. When it was first
delivered into my hands, a joyful sensation diffused itself over my heart, and
while reading the tender expressions of grateful affection that seemed to flow
spontaneous from your pen, it expanded with pleasure; but when I came to these
words, "My father received us with great affection, and has been very bountiful
in presents, clothes, pocket-money, etc. but yet for all that, my dear Madam, I
cannot feel that perfect affection for him, which I know I ought. He has a
great many peculiarities, some of them by no means pleasing; and my sisters all
agree, he is very much of the Bashaw."

Good Heavens! said I, and is this all the fruit I am likely to reap from the
pains I have taken to instill into the minds of those dear girls a just idea of
what is meant by the words, Filial Duty. That the very first letter I receive
should point at the little foibles of a parent, who they acknowledge received
them with affection, and has been extremely bountiful to them. Believe me, my
dear children, if you wish to pass through life with any degree of pleasure to
yourselves, you must early learn to submit, without murmuring, to the will of
your father; be blind to his errors, or if they are so glaring that you cannot
avoid seeing them, never expose them, or suffer others to speak disrespectfully
of him in your presence.

You must sacrifice your own wishes to his, you must study his happiness and
ease, and in so doing will most assuredly promote your own.

You no doubt remember the amiable Mrs. Railton, who favored me with her
company for a few weeks last summer. I yesterday received news of her death,
and as I am certain example is ever more efficacious than precept, I will give
you a slight sketch of her history, as a model by which every young woman who
wishes to promote her own felicity, will regulate her conduct.

Mr. George Campbell was the youngest son of a wealthy baronet, who having
several livings in his gift, besides good interest at Court, brought him up to
the church, with the sanguine expectation of one day seeing him a bishop.

Unfortunately for George, before he had attained his twenty-third year he
became attached to a young lady, who had every requisite to render the married
state happy, but money -- and money being the old gentleman's darling idol, he
consequently thought she possessed no requisite worthy the wife of his son; but
George was too far engaged to retreat with honor, he therefore told his father,
he was resolved upon the union, and in a few days presented his beloved Louisa
to entreat his blessing.

When Sir James found they were really married, he thought it was in vain to
fly in a passion, he received them cordially, and gave them, an universal
invitation to his house, but in his heart he never forgave them. The livings
were disposed of to other people, and at his death he left the whole of his
estates to his eldest son.

Mr. Campbell had only a curacy of about eighty pounds a year, and as regular
as the year came round, his wife presented him with a child. Poverty took up
her habitation among them, and he bitterly regretted having, by an act of
disobedience, not only brought on himself his father's displeasure, but
involved an amiable woman, whom he loved, in a scene of penury and distress.
These reflections sour'd his disposition, he became peevish and morose, nay
sometimes went so far, as to reproach his wife as the cause of his abject
situation.

Mrs. Campbell took great care to instill into the minds of her children the
respect and affection due from them to their father. "My dear children," she
would often say, "be assured, a breach of filial duty is ever attended with
regret, and in general with misfortune."

Louisa was the eldest of five children, she was mild, meek, and affectionate.
She attentively listened to the precepts of her mother, and laid them up in her
heart as an inestimable treasure. Mr. Campbell's temper grew so extremely bad,
that not only his wife, but his children came in for a share of his ill-humour.
Louisa, in particular, was sure to be wrong, in whatever she said or did, and
it was seldom she was favored with a kind or affectionate word, yet her
manners were so amiable and her form so lovely, that though she labored under
the disadvantages of a narrow education and extreme poverty, her company was
courted by some of the genteelest families in the village, but in compliance
with her father's illhumour, she was seldom allowed to stir from home.

When Louisa had reached her seventeenth year, Lady Mary Campbell, a distant
relation of her father's came on a visit to a family who resided in the same
village, Louisa's good qualities were resounded to Lady Mary from every mouth,
and all unanimously agreed it was a pity so lovely a girl should be buried in
obscurity and lost for want of a proper education.

Lady Mary was naturally of a humane disposition, she expressed a desire to see
Miss Campbell, and when introduced to her, finding her even superior to what
she had been taught to expect, made her an offer of going with her to London.

This was a proposal, too much to Louisa's advantage to be refused; the
invitation was accepted, and the visit prolonged for three years, during which
time Louisa had an opportunity of improving herself in the ornamental as well
as useful branches of education.

Mrs. Campbell, who had for many years labored under an evident decline, was
now summoned home by that power, who had been pleased in this life to try her
with long and heavy afflictions. Lady Mary carried Louisa to receive the dying
blessing, and pay the last duties to her amiable mother. -- That finished, she
proposed her return to London. The lovely girl, penetrated with gratitude for
the many favors she had received and tenderly attached to her generous
benefactress, with difficulty restrained her tears, while she thus addressed
her --

"Think me not ungrateful, dear Madam, if I beg to remain with any father; my
brothers and sisters are engaged in learning occupations which may enable them
to pass through life with industry and without reproach. I cannot leave my
father in this solitude after so recent an affliction: he has been for many
years used to the unremitting attention and tenderness of my excellent mother,
I must not suffer him too severely to feel her loss, but endeavor, as far as
in my power, by affection and assiduity, to supply her place."

"And can you, my dear Louisa, said her Ladyship, so easily forego the ease and
plenty you have enjoyed with me, to live a life of penury and labor, and that
for a man, who, though he is your father, I must say, does not deserve such
attention -- did he not always treat you with unmerited harshness?"

"Hold, my dear Madam," said Louisa, if, as you think, my father has not
behaved to me with the kindness of a parent, it by on means releases me from my
duty to him; had he a thousand errors he is my father still; as such I am
called upon by nature and religion to do every thing in my power to render his
life comfortable; if my endeavors to please can awaken his affection, I shall
think myself amply repaid; if not, the consciousness, of having performed my
duty, will give me a satisfaction which no future event can ever rob me of."

It was in vain Lady Mary urged her to return -- the lovely. elegant,
accomplished Louisa, preferred a low roofed mansion, scanty meals, and
attendance on a sick peevish father, to the lofty apartments, plenteous table,
and variety of amusements, she might have enjoyed with Lady Mary. She attended
him to the last, and by her tender solicitude and affection smoothed the
down-hill of his life, and cheared and comforted him in the most painful
illness by her unaffected piety; he was moved by her filial duty, all the
father rushed upon his soul, he blessed her with his parting breath, and
expired in her arms.

You may, perhaps, enquire, what benefit Louisa reaped from this rigid
performance of her duty? The question is easily answered. She gained a
contented happy mind, serenity dwelt in her heart and cheerfulness beamed from
her eyes.

She had a genteel competency left her at Lady Mary's death, married a
deserving man, and shone as conspicuously in the characters of a wife and
mother, as she had done as a daughter -- she lived beloved by all and died
universally regretted.

Be wise, my dear children, follow Louisa's example, so shall your lives be
happy and your last moments peace.

MENTORIA.

LETTER II.
I AM sorry, my dear ladies to be under the disagreeable necessity of again
taking up my pen to reprove,

Your letters to me of late, have arrived so seldom, and when they do arrive,
are so short, so filled with dress, visits, and parties of pleasure, that I
almost doubt whether some demon has not imitated your handwriting, to impose
upon me; for I can find no vestige of those sentiments I so anxiously strove to
inculcate in your minds while in the shades of Cambray: from the tenor of your
letters, I should imagine you live entirely in a crowd, if so, you certainly
have no time to attend to those improvements I so strongly recommended to you
not to neglect.

You seem also to have taken an unaccountable dislike to Mrs. Clairville. You
say your father is a great deal too partial to her; this appears to me the
evident effect of envy or jealousy; your father being perfectly sensible of
that lady's merit, and conscious that her situation in his family is rather
humiliating, by treating her with uncommon respect, shows the goodness of his
heart, and sets an example which I should rejoice to find my dear girls would
follow.

Another thing which seriously alarms me for your future happiness is, to find
you have your friends and secrets, and form little cotteries, of which neither
your father nor Mrs. Clairville have any knowledge; believe me, you cannot be
too cautious in the choice of your intimates, many a girl, whose intentions
have been perfectly innocent, has lost her reputation, by associating with
women whose levity has rendered their characters suspicious. You cannot find in
the whole circle of your acquaintance, a friend so sincere as your natural
parent, to him you may without reserve, communicate every wish of your hearts,
for trust me when I say, every thought you would hesitate to reveal to a
parent, must be totally improper to be harbored in your bosom. Perhaps you
will tell me, that having no mother, there are some emotions of the heart,
which the natural timidity and delicacy of your sex would render it extremely
painful to communicate to a father.

As I am sensible of the truth of this assertion, I must recommend to you to
chose a friend from among those most esteemed by your father, let her be some
years older than yourself, (for age, in general, learn experience in the arts
of the world) and by her advice, she may, in some measure guard you from
falling a prey to the dissimulation of many pretendens to love or friendship,
who will assume the semblance of attachment, to draw the unsuspecting youthful
heart into improper connections, which too often terminate in their ruin.

A numerous acquaintance is, in general, of dangerous consequence to young
women, as it is impossible but in a multiplicity of characters there may be
some, whose conversation and example it would be improper to follow, and such
is the frail state of human nature, that bad habits are easily contracted, and
can seldom if ever be eradicated. A girl just entering the state of womanhood
especially if she is possessed of any personal or mental accomplishments, and
of an open ingenuous temper is surrounded with innumerable dangers; her
reputation is of as delicate a texture, and may be as easily injured, as the
fairest blossom; the malignant whisperings of envy, or the pestiferous breath
of slander, may in an instant blast it; it will droop under the keen eye of
suspicion, and too often those who most pretend to admire its sweets, will
rudely pluck it from its parent stalk, deprive it of all its beauties, then
throw it from them like a loathsome weed, leave it to perish unpitied and
unregarded, and to be trod to the earth by every unfeeling passenger, who may
perhaps cast on it a look of contempt, and cry, "Behold the once lovely."

There are many women in the world lovely in their persons, elegant and
engaging in their manners, who are yet very improper connections for girls, who
wish to preserve their reputation unsullied; of this description I greatly fear
your favorite Matilda is -- the strong dislike she expresses at the idea of
your bringing either your father or Mrs. Clairville to see her, convinces me
there must'be something in her character which she would not like to have
discovered. Remember it was at a public ball you first formed an acquaintance
with her; that a gentleman introduced her to you, and chance afterward led you
in a morning excursion to ride by her little chateau; you confess she lives in
an elegant manner, that she is highly accomplished, and yet is always by
herself. Would any woman of character and fortune, do you think, live thus
recluse, have no female friends to associate with, no little cheerful parties
to enliven her solitude, and when she went into public, would she go only
accompanied by gentlemen? You say there is an air of mystery about her; and,
believe me, if that mystery was developed, it would discover nothing to her
advantage. Let me entreat my dear girls to drop the acquaintance, or inform
your father of it: if after a proper enquiry concerning her character, he
should approve the continuation of your visits, I shall be happy to find you
have so agreeable a member added to your society, and severely blame myself for
having judged so harshly.

I should not have so many fears concerning your intimacy with Matilda, had I
not, some years ago, known a very amiable girl, who entirely forfeited her good
name, and in the end her life, by associating with a woman of light character.

Harriet Harding had the misfortune to lose her mother when very young, and at
a very early age took upon herself the choice of her own acquaintance. She had
been at the play one night, when a lady in the same box had shown her many
civilities, and at parting gave her a card, and begged to have the honor of
seeing her.

Mr. Harding had remarked what passed, and on returning home, warned his
daughter against forming any acquaintance with her, as she was a woman publicly
kept by a man of fashion.

Harriet was giddy, thoughtless and fond of pleasure; chance threw her again in
the way of Amelia, and she entirely forgot her father's injunction. A strict
intimacy ensued, she was frequent in her visits to Amelia, often went with her
into public, and was charmed with the incense of flattery that was offered to
her by the men. Mr. Harding had business which called him to a distant part of
England, Harriet was left mistress of her own actions, and chose this
opportunity to go with Amelia on an excursion in the country; in this excursion
they were attended by the gentleman who kept Amelia, and one of his friends,
who was particular in his attentions to Harriet; the time flew on the wings of
pleasure, and when they returned to town, (Mr. Harding being still absent) it
was proposed she should accompany the party to a masquerade.

Harriet was a stranger to this sort of amusement, her spirits were exhilerated
-- she did not think of leaving it till a late hour, and when she mentioned
going home Amelia was not to be found. The gentleman who had been her protector
all the evening, begged permission to see her home, she consented, and at the
hour of five in the morning arrived at her father's house; a servant who had
arose carly to perform some particular work let her in, and the gentleman
followed her up stairs. She was surprised, but could not he so rude as to tell
him to leave the house; but how was her surprise increased, when throwing aside
his mask and domino, he proceeded to take liberties she had ever been used to
think of with abhorrence. Unable to defend herself from his insults, she
shrieked aloud, and in a moment her father, who had returned the evening
before, burst into the room -- her shame and terror overcame her, and she
fainted; an explanation ensued between the father and the gentleman who had
insulted her, who shocked at the impropriety of his behavior asked Mr.
Harding's pardon, and staying till Harriet was recovered, gave her this advice
at parting.

"I trust, my dear young lady, this will be a warning to you in future, how you
choose your intimates. Amelia is a woman so publicly known, that it was next to
impossible for you not to have been acquainted with the lightness of her
character, I am now fully convinced that you are a woman of strict honor, but,
believe me, till this day I always thought you a girl who had either no
reputation to lose, or paid very little attention to so material a concern. I
am sorry to say there are numbers of persons, of both sexes, who have seen you
with Amelia, who think the same, and whom it will be a very difficult matter to
convince to the contrary; let me beg of you to break off a connection so
derogatory to your honor, and by the future propriety of your conduct regain
that reputation, which your intimacy with so infamous woman has considerably
injured."

Harriet could answer only with her tears, which flowed plenteously, not only
at hearing these disagreeable truths, but from the reflection, that when the
stranger was gone she had still her father's anger to endure; had this been
all, Harriet might have thought herself happy, as by her future behavior she
might have hoped to regain his confidence and favor, but the heedless girl too
soon found, that not only her father watched her actions with a suspicious eye,
but all her female friends received her visits with coldness, forbore to return
them, and in a short time entirely dropped her acquaintance; to add to her
mortification, a young gentleman who had for some time addressed her on an
honorable score, broke off the connection, and she found herself as solitary
and as much neglected as though she lived in a desert."

"The consequence was, that on her father's decease, which happened soon after,
finding herself, without society, she renewed her intimacy with Amelia, and
from being accustomed to an intimate acquaintance with vice in others, she sunk
so low as to practice; it herself, without compunction or remorse; till
overtaken by disease and want (the sure attendants on riot and intemperance)
she sunk to an early grave, a victim to her own folly."

You see, my dear girls, Harriet was not naturally of a depraved inclination,
she shrunk with horror from the first approach of vice; her attachment to
Amelia was founded on a love of pleasure, she enjoyed every luxury while with
her, led a life of indolence, and was continually receiving presents of
something to decorate her person; these were indulgences she could not enjoy at
home, for though Mr. Harding was a very substantial tradesman, he would by no
means allow his daughter to launch into extravagance, either in her
housekeeping, dress, or pleasure -- he wished to see every hour usefully
employed, and as youth in general are much more found of pleasure than
employment, Harriet was delighted with the acquaintance of a woman in whose
society she could enjoy the one in its utmost extent, without ever hearing of
the other.

I know my dear girls will tell me, there is no danger of Matilda drawing them
into any improper scenes, by gratifying their desire of dissipation, since
their father indulgently allows them to enjoy every pleasurable amusement the
metropolis affords. But you are totally unacquainted with the world, there are
a thousand ways by which an artful woman may steal upon the undesigning heart,
a thousand ways by which she may lead them to destruction. Be wise then, my
sweet young friends, and drop this acquaintance, before you feel any of its
disagreeable consequences.

I shall in some future letter give you a few hints concerning the proper use
of time, certain that however harsh you may for a moment think my reproofs, the
native goodness of your hearts, will convince you they are meant solely for
your good, and that you have not a more affectionate friend than

MENTORIA.

LETTER III. MENTORIA TO MISS WINWORTHS.
My Dear Girls,
IN my last I gave you a striking instance of the dangerous tendency of
improper acquaintance; be assured, there are more women led into errors by the
bad precepts and examples of their own sex, than you would be apt to imagine,
not only in forfeiting their good name, but every pretension to happiness. I do
not know how otherwise to account for so many lovely, amiable women entailing
misery upon themselves and their posterity, than by the romantic ideas they
entertain of love and friendship.

Love, my dear children, is a noble, generous passion, and when kept under the
guidance of reason, exalts and elevates the human soul; but the juvenile mind
is apt to mistake a transient likeing, or a sudden impulse of gratified vanity,
for love; and many a girl from at first being pleased with the company of those
who indiscriminately offer the incense of adulation to every young female
begins to fancy one more particular than the rest, and that one is undoubtedly
designed to be her husband. From the moment this idea takes place, Miss is most
violently in love, sleeping or waking the dear youth is continnally in her
thoughts, she lives but in his presence, when he is absent she only exists. She
unbosoms herself to some dear girl nearly of her own age, and she being her
friend and confidant, the secret is to be kept inviolable. For want of some
laudable pursuit to employ her time and engage her attention, she indulges her
foolish penchant, which originated first in vanity and was afterward nursed by
fancy, till at length she is in reality attached to a man, who perhaps never
entertained a serious thought of her; he marries some other woman, and Miss is
left to sigh at her hard late, complain of the perfidy of mankind, and indulge
in a luxury of delicate ideal misery. Nor is this all, her dear and faithful
friend betrays her secret to all the Misses of her acquaintance, who (though
perhaps guilty of the same folly themselves) will not scruple to laugh at what
they will term, her indiscreet and foolish conduct.

Though such a situation is certainly sufficiently mortifying, yet it is by no
means the worst that may happen. A girl who imagines she must be in love with
the first man who says a few civil things to her, lays herself open to the
designs of the object of her ideal passion, who if he should happen to be an
artful man, may take advantage of her partiality and credulity, to draw her
into indissoluble engagements, which is in general the case when there is a
fortune in the way, or where that charm is wanting, to plunge her into infamy.

I once knew a girl, who, possessed of every advantage which could be derived
from wealth, beauty, honorable relations, and a polite liberal education, at
the early age of eighteen fell a victim to a romantic passion, and in the very
moment when she sacrificed the regard of her friends the hopes of future
advancement in life, in short, every thing that was valuable, she fancied she
had done a praiseworthy action, by evincing her constancy and disinterested
attachment to the object of her first love.

Belinda Dormer went to the same school with me, we contracted a great
friendship for each other, and when the holidays separated us, by calling each
to her respective home, we treasured up every little incident in our memories,
whether of pain or pleasure, that when we met we might exchange confidence, and
live over our pleasures, or soothe the remembrance of our little uneasinesses
by participation.

Bell was a lovely brown girl, elegant in her form, accomplished in her
manners, and lively in her disposition; her heart was tender and affectionate,
without the least tincture of art or affectation, good-natured, easy, and
credulous. She left school at the age of seventeen, and was ushered into the
world, prepared to admire her, for she was reputed heiress to an immense
fortune. The Christmas before she was taken home, during the holidays, her
father gave a hall in honor of her birthday, a young officer, whose only
recommendation was an handsome person and polite address, and who depended on
Mr. Dormer for father advancement in the army, requested the honor of her hand,
and in the course of the evening danced himself so far into her esteem, that
she implicitly believed him, when he told her she was the loveliest creature in
the world, and that he should be miserable if she did not suffer him to hope he
was not altogether indifferent to her.

Mr. Dormer had placed great confidence in this young man, he had taken him
from a state of abject penury, placed him at a genteel academy, and when he
imagined him capable of discharging his duty, as became a man of honor and a
soldier, purchased him an ensign's commission in a regiment going to America,
where he raised himself to the rank of captain, and was now just returned to
England. Mr. Dormer ever intended to be the friend and patron of young Horton,
but never dreamt of his aspiring to his daughter, he therefore gave him a
general invitation to his house, nor once thought but that his gratitude and
honor would be sufficient to prevent his forming any improper designs on the
person or fortune of Belinda, besides he was near ten years older than Miss
Dormer, and therefore there was no fear of an attachment taking place between
them.

But Horton was an artful ambitious man, he long had wished to enjoy the
benefits of an independent fortune, and looked on Belinda as the person by
whose assistance he could obtain so desirable an acquisition. He had always
been successful with the ladies, but the true state of his finances being
generally known, he found it impossible to succeed in any matrimonial scheme,
except it was with the innocent and unsuspicious, and Belinda was exactly
suited for his purpose. He flattered, swore, knelt, wept, and acted every
extravagance, till the simple girl made some confessions in his favor, he then
prevailed on her to keep her partiality a secret from her mother, for he knew
that her parents designed her for the bride of a young nobleman, who was at at
that time abroad. He expatiated on the folly and cruelty of parents choosing
partners for their children, and launched out in praise of disinterested love,
talked of the union of souls, and a deal of soft sentimental nonsense, about a
life of uninterruped felicity with the object of her own choice, though she was
to live in the meanest cottage.

When Belinda returned to school, she fancied herself as much in love as it was
possible for any sentimental heroine to be, and declared, for her sweet Horton
she would be coutent to relinquish all the elegancies and indulgencies to which
she had ever been a customed, and live upon the coarsest viands, in an obscure
mansion. It was in vain I endeavored to argue my young friend out of these
ridiculous notions, she remained fixed in her determination, to marry Horton or
not marry at all.

Unfortunately for Belinda, at that time I had as chimerical ideas of
friendship as she had of love, and should have supposed it an inexcusable
breach of confidence, to discover her designs to her mother, though it would
have been the best proof of real friendship I could possibly have given her.

She was taken from school with a design of being introduced to Lord Gaymore;
she went home one day, had a meeting with Horton the next, and the third
morning by five o'clock set off in a chaise and four to Scotland, without
having even seen the person her parents so earnestly wished her to be united
with.

When they returned, Mr. Dormer, though highly offended at the rash conduct of
Belinda, and the black ingratitude of Horton, forgave them, and settled an
handsome annuity on her, but told them the bulk of his fortune was entailed on
Lord Gaymore, (who was the nearest male relation) in case of her refusal of him.

Belinda was soon settled, and I took an early opportunity to visit her; I
sound her, according to her own words, "superlatively happy! Her Horton was the
kindest best of husbands, her home was a paradise, she would not be Lady
Gaymore for the world! What was affluence? Nothing when put in competition with
love and Horton." But this was the language of romance.

I called on her again in about six months. I found her fitting in extreme
dishabille, her face was pale, her eyes sunk, and as she pensively leaned her
head upon her hand a tear now and then stole down her cheek. I asked tenderly
the cause of her sorrow. "Oh! my friend," said she, "I have undone myself!
Horton is no longer the attentive tender husband." I, smiling, told her, that
she must not expect the solicitude of the lover to last for life, but be
content with the more calm and lasting esteem of a friend.

"Alas!" replied Belinda, "I have no friend, I find, too late, my violent
attachment to Horton was the romantic whim of a lively imagination; and that
the union of souls, the similarity of sentiment, which I had vainly thought
would make the fetters of Hymen easy, and even delightful, existed only in my
ideas. Horton has neither sense, good nature, or politeness at home, though he
appears to possess those amiable qualities so eminently abroad. He is
extravagant, vain, and too fond of his own person, to be long attached to any
woman, except his passion is excited by interested motives; he has not scrupled
to own, it was the hope of possessing my fortune alone induced him to address
me, and that had he known the estate was entailed on Lord Gaymore, he never
would have troubled himself to make love to a puny, baby-faced girl, when there
were so many fine women who would have thought themselves honored by his
notice. Indeed, continued she, redoubling her tears, he seldom comes home but I
am insulted with a recital of the many women of fashion who make him advances,
and I am debarred of every innocent amusement, stinted in my dress, and almost
kept without pocket-money, that he may appear with elegance in company, and
have plenty of money to la vish in expensive pleasures.

I was greatly chagrined to find my dear young friend had really such just
cause for complaint, but endeavored to comfort her, and lead her to hope, that
by constant affection, attention, and good humor, she might recall her
wanderer, and awaken in his bosom reciprocal tenderness. But I found by her
reply, these were fallacious hopes.

She had been to visit her parents, and had there formed an acquaintance with
Lord Gaymore, Unfortunately the ill-fated Belinda discovered this once dreaded
nobleman to be possessed of every real virtue, of which Horton had assumed the
semblance; his person was handsome, without being effeminate, his heart glowed
with humanity and benevolence; he was a man of refined sense and strict honor,
with a mind enlightened and expanded by a liberal education and a thorough
knowledge of the world. Belinda saw him, and acknowledged the full value of the
happiness she had voluntarily cast from her.

I warned her against making comparisons to the disparagement of her husband;
and hinted the folly and danger of suffering any other person to stand higher
in her esteem. She acknowledged the truth of my remarks, said she would
endeavor to be patient and content, but she greatly feared she had lost sight
of happiness for ever. And so indeed it proved, for though at the death of her
father she received a very handsome legacy, so great was Horton's extravagance,
that it was presently gone, lavished away on the worst of women for the most
infamous purposes.

Belinda had children very fast, and before she was thirty years old was left a
widow with eight helpless children, to struggle with the accumulated evils of
poverty, contempt, and a broken heart -- Horton's extravagance having obliged
her to sell her annuity, she had no resource but to accept a small yearly
allowance from Lord Gaymore, who was then married, and allowed her a hundred
pounds a year, for the education of her eldest boy, to whom he was godfather.

I will leave you my dear girls to imagine the pain and mortification of such a
dependence, and while you pity Belinda's misfortune, cautiously avoid her
errors! I shall renew the subject next post, till when and ever believe the
your friend,

MENTORIA.

LETTER. IV.
AS my subject is love, my dear children may perhaps once think an old woman
entertaining; but when they find my intention is only to expose the dangers
which are attendant on that passion, instead of following the example of more
juvenile scribblers, by expatiating on its pleasures, you will throw down my
letter in a pet. But I shall not let this deter me from following my intended
plan, and endeavoring to convince you that there cannot be a more critical
period in the whole course of your lives, than that in which you are surrounded
by lovers; nor can there be any thing of more dangerous tendency than a young
woman suffering a lover to approach her in a clandestine manner, or encourage
addresses which she has any reason to think her parents or friends would
disapprove; such a conduct is generally attended with disagreeable consequences.

I have a collection of letters in my possession, which I think might well be
termed a school for lovers, and will, I am certain, be of more effect in
convincing you of the impropriety of clandestine marriages, than a whole sheet
of dull precepts. I have sent them for your perusal, and by way of preface,
shall give you an account of the means by which I became possessed of them.

A favorite servant of your grandmother a who had been my nurse, had married
a reputable tradesman, but, through unavoidable misfortunes, they were reduced,
and the husband thrown into prison. Martha lived in an obscure lodging, and had
been for some months extremely ill. My lady encouraged me in going to see her,
and carrying her little presents.

One day my lady was gone out to dinner, the servants were all in the kitchen,
and I took that opportunity of going out unobserved to visit Martha. Charmed
with the idea of going by myself (for I usually had a servant with me) I
tripped nimbly along, in my way laying out my whole stock of pocket money,
which amounted to five shillings, in tea, sugar and biscuits, for my nurse. As
I went up stairs to Martha's apartment, I observed in a small back room, the
door of which was taken off the hinges, a tall well-made man, in an old rusty
black coat, his face pale and meagre, his arms folded upon his bosom, his eyes
fixed seemingly on the floor, but instead of the vacant inanimate stare, there
was a mixture of hornor and despair depicted in them. Curiosity prompted me to
draw near the door of the room; at the farther and, on a bundle of straw, the
only furniture the wretched apartment afforded, sat a woman, whose features
told she had once been lovely; on her lap lay an infant asleep, beside her sat
a fine boy, who, with a piteous accent was asking for bread; the woman paid no
attention to his entreaties, but with her eyes fixed on the youngest child,
appeared like misery personified. Young as I was, I felt my heart greatly
afflicted at this scene, and running hastily up stairs into Martha's room,
unable to articulate a word, I burst into tears. Martha astonished at the agony
I was in, tenderly inquired the cause. I told her what I had seen. "Alas! my
dear child," said she, "those people are in more distress than it is possible
for you to conceive; they have lodged in this house about six weeks, in which
time I am certain they have had nothing to support themselves and children but
what they could raise from the sale of a few clothes; they are now a fortnight
in arrears for rent, and the inhuman landlord has taken the door off the
hinges, and the windows out of the frames, to oblige them to quit the
apartment. Alas, poor souls, they have no means of procuring another shelter
from nocturnal dews, when they relinguish this. I have not seen him stir out
these two days past, and am apt to think in that time they have had no food
except a slice of bread and meat which I gave the eldest child yesterday.

How at that moment did I regret my money being all spent, five shillings
appeared to me a fortune, which might preserve these unfortunate people;
however, I had not even a single halfpenny, nor could I bear the thought of
taking from Martha any part of what I had given her. I therefore hastily bade
her good bye, and flew rather than walked home, inquired for the housekeeper,
related the afflicting situation of the family, and requested the loan of half
a guinea. The housekeeper was an unfeeling, mercenary woman, she never heard a
tale of distress but she imagined it fictitious, nor would she ever bestow any
relief, lest the object relieved should be an impostor. She refused my request.
I then had recourse to the nursery maid, but could borrow no more than one
shilling.

With this trifle I eagerly returned to the poor sufferers, entered the
apartment, and under pretense of kissing the infant, dropped the shilling into
the mother's lap. The exclamation which broke from her, when she saw the money,
convinced me she was a foreigner; and the demeanor of the man was vastly above
the common rank of people.

Unfortunately my Lady did not return from her visit till after supper, so that
I was not permitted to set up to see her; but though I retired to bed I could
not sleep, my mind had been too much agitated, and the starving family had left
such an impression on it, that the moment I closed my eyes they were present to
my imagination. Early in the morning I stole to Lady Winworth's chamber, told
my little story, and on my knees entreated some money to carry to them.

Her Ladyship, though from infancy nursed in the lap of ease and affluence, had
an heart overflowing with compassion toward her suffering fellow creatures;
she gave me two guineas, and ordered the footman immediately to attend me.

I cannot describe the joy that expanded my heart as I proceeded to G --
Street. The master of the house was just risen, and was opening his shop. I
asked for the foreign gentleman. Gentleman, returned he with a sneer, the
French beggar I suppose you mean, I don't know where he is, I turned them out
last night; people who cannot afford to pay for their lodgings, must lay where
and how they can. Cruel inhuman wretch, said I, and turned from him with every
mark of abhorrence.

It was yet early, the morning was inviting, and I thought a walk in the fields
might cheer me after my recent disappointment; however, I previously determined
every inquiry should be made after the poor foreigner and his family.

Crossing a field in the vicinity of Mary-lebon, the voice of a child crying
caught my ear, I turned my head, and saw at a little distance, seated on a log
of wood, the very person I had been seeking, one child was in his arms, the
other stood by him, his wife lay on the ground. I ran to him, spoke to him,
bade him take hope, and put the two guineas in his hand -- he looked at the
money, then at me. Angel of mercy, said he, with a deep sigh, it is too late,
my Agnes has left me. I saw his intellects were disordered and shuddered with
horror. Thinking the wife would be better able to take care of the money, I
stooped in order to awaken her -- I called her, she moved not -- I took hold of
her hand, it was dreadfully cold; she is in a sit, said I, and raised her head
upon my knee, Never, oh! never, my beloved girls, will the spectacle that
presented itself to my eyes, be banished from my memory. Her eyes were partly
closed, her mouth half open, her lips black -- Death had that night released
her from a world of misery. I shrieked and fainted. When I recovered I found
myself in my dear Lady's arms, who told me, the body of the poor young woman
was taken care of, that the man was quite distracted and entirely unable to
give any account of himself, though from an unfinished letter, addressed to the
Marchioness Savillion, which was found in the woman's pocket they had reason to
suppose they were of a good family.

The man survived his wife but a few days, my Lady took care of the children.

About six months after I was sent to a convent near Paris, in order to finish
my education, and perfect myself in the French language. Among a number of
boarders who resided at the convent, I was particularly noticed by one, who was
distinguished by the title of St. Augustina; she was of a weakly constitution,
and often confined to her bed, when she was always pleased if I would work or
read beside her. One day she gave me her keys, and desired me to unlock a
cabinet and take out a curious piece of needlework which she said had been
executed by a once loved friend. As I took the work from the drawer, a
miniature picture attracted my notice; methought I knew the features; I took it
up to examine it more minutely, and immediately recollected the interesting
countenance of the unfortunate Agnes. Upon inquiry I found I was right in my
conjecture; St. Augustina was the Marchioness Savillion, whom Lady Winworth had
made numerous fruitless inquiries after. She had been the friend and companion
of Agnes, but had married and left the convent where they both boarded just
before that young lady, and her last pathetic letters never reached her till it
was too late to administer relief; the Marchioness had since lost her husband
and two fine children, by fire, which accident had so impaired her health and
depressed her spirits, that she had retired from the world, and meant to spend
the remainder of her days in the convent where she had passed her youth. She
showed me all Agnes's letters, and before I left France suffered me to take
copies of them.

LETTER I. AGNES TO THE MARCHIONESS.
WHY have you left me, my Augustina, why are you away at the moment I most want
your advice? -- Selfish Agnes, methinks I hear you say, to regret the happiness
of your friend, because it interferes with your own. Oh! no, I do not regret
your felicity, my sweet friend, I rejoice, I exult in the reflection that you
are for ever exempt from the pangs which at present rive the heart of the
wretched Agnes.

You ever knew the aversion and horror that seized my heart when I reflected on
the intended union between myself and the Count de la Rue. Alas! my Augustina,
the time approaches when that aversion will become a crime, and yet I feel it
every day increase. Shall I own to the sympathizing bosom of friendship, that
my heart has made its election, and that election has not fallen on the man for
whom my parents have designed me. I know you will blame me, I know you will bid
me endeavor to conquer my growing passion, and call in reason to my
assistance. Alas! what power has reason over the heart torn by contending
passions? Duty bids me stifle my sighs, and bend my thoughts and wishes toward
the Count, love triumphs over duty, and I can only think of Vieurville.

The day after you left our convent, Mademoiselle Vieurville requested me to
attend her to the parlour, where her brother and lover waited to see her. "You
must go, Agnes, said she, or my brother will be quite at a loss how to amuse
himself, while I converse with Montrose." I was easily persuaded, and on
entering the parlour, was struck with the noble mein and elegant manner of
young Vieurville; we chatted for some time on indifferent subjects, his
vivacity and wit, (through which it was easy to discover a fund of good sense)
delighted me, and when I retired with Mademoiselle, I could not help expressing
my admiration; he is a charming young man indeed, said she, and had I not known
that you were on the point of marriage, I should not have ventured to introduce
him to you, for fear you might lose your heart; for you must know (continued
she, paying no regard to the visible emotion which I am certain agitated my
features) that Louis is to be married the same day that I am, to a beautiful
Spanish lady, who is expected in Paris next month. Has he ever seen his
intended bride? said I, affecting indifference. Oh! no, she replied, but if
Donna Clara be but half as lovely as her picture represents her, he must
inevitably fall in love. It is odd, said I, that he should consent to marry a
woman he has never seen. I dare say it appears so to you, replied Mademoiselle,
but when I shall tell you how it came about, your wonder will cease.

My mother was the only daughter of an ancient wealthy Spanish family, and
eloped with my father from a convent, where she was placed for education. The
match was very unequal; her father was irreconcilably offended, and would never
suffer her to be named in his presence.

My mother was tenderly beloved by her brother, who, at the old nobleman's
decease, paid her a handsome fortune, and vowed their families should ever live
in the strictest amity.

My uncle was married to a woman of whom he was passionately fond, and when, in
giving birth to Donna Clara, she departed this world, he took a solemn oath
that no other woman should ever supply her place, but that the whole of his
future life should be devoted to the care of his daughter. My mother at that
time lying in of a son, the two infants were contracted to each other, and my
brother, at his uncle's decease, is to inherit the estate and titles devolving
to him from his grandfather. My uncle is expected to bring his daughter to
Paris this winter, when the marriage is to be completed, and I shall be
delivered from this horrid convent.

I cannot describe my feelings during Mademoiselle's recital. I know not what
could be the cause of my agitation, but I could hardly restrain my tears, while
I remained in her apartment. When I retired, I began to take my heart to task,
and determined to repel a rising passion, which had thus suddenly taken
possession of it: I forebore making any comparison between my intended Lord and
young Vieurville, and determined never to see the latter again; but the next
morning vanquished these good resolutions.

I was but just arisen, when one of the lay-sisters informed me a gentleman
requested a few moments conversation. Imagining it to be either the Count, or
some messenger from my father, I repaired without hesitation to the parlour.
Judge of my surprise when I found myself in the presence of Monsieur
Vieurville. Supposing the nun had made a mistake in calling me instead of
Mademoiselle, his sister, I was going to retire, when he entreated me to stop,
assured me there was no mistake, and taking my hand, led me to a chair, and
seated himself beside me.

I come, dearest Madam, said he, to entreat a few moments serious attention
from you, and a candid answer to a question, which though abrupt in its nature,
yet from the circumstances which we both at present are in, demands an explicit
reply. My sister has informed me, that your parents design you for the wife of
Count de la Rue; however presumptuous the supposition may be, I cannot imagine
your heart has any interest in the intended union. My heart, Sir, replied I,
will ever follow the dictates of duty, and rejoice in ratifying any engagement
which I am certain will give my parents so much pleasure.

But was that heart left to make its free choice, would it then have selected
the Count as the object of its dearest affection?

I know not, Monsieur, what authority you have to make these enquiries, nor do
I think myself obliged to answer them.

I rose to quit the parlour -- lovely Agnes, said he, catching my hand, I know
I have been abrupt, but let my situation plead my excuse. You no doubt have
heard from my sister, that I am designed the husband of a woman I have never
seen; till yesterday I ever believed my heart unsusceptible of the power of
beauty, and imagined I might be as happy with Donna Clara as any other woman,
but I am now convinced, that indifference only proceeded from the want of a
proper object to call forth the affections of my heart. I have seen the lovely
object who has that power, I feel my bosom glow with new and unutterable
sensations, and though I would have married Clara had I continued in a state of
indifference; I will never wed her now, my heart is firmly attached to another.
You, adorable Agnes, are the only woman who ever gave my heart a single pain,
or taught it to throb with rapture; if your affections are already engaged, I
will condemn myself to eternal silence, but if you will grant me one ray of
hope that you are not altogether indifferent to my suit, the world shall not
tempt me to enter into any engagement with Donna Clara.

Oh! my beloved Augustina, at that moment reason, honor, fortitude, forsook
me, enchanted with the convincing proof he offered to give me of inviolable
attachment, I suffered him to perceive my partiality. I thought not on the
irreparable injury I should do Vieurville's family, I forgot the duty I owed my
parents, the respect I owed myself, and confessed that he alone was the master
of my affections.

I see your anger, my dear friend, I hear you blame my imprudence; shall I lose
your friendship, Augustina, will you chase the imprudent Agnes from your bosom!
Alas! If you do, where will she find another resting place? The thought
overpowers me, I can write no more.

Adieu, AGNES.

LETTER II. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.
I ACKNOWLEDGE your reproof, I see my error, but I have not power to renounce
it. You bid me exert my fortitude; I have no fortitude, my friend, it all
forsook me when I was parted from Augustina, what little I ever possessed was
but a gentle spark of virtue caught from her bosom. I am nothing of myself, a
feather, an atom of thistledown is heavy when weighed against the stability of
Agnes. Donna Clara is arrived, and Vieurville has refused to fulfill the
engagements his father had entered into; his sister suspects the cause, I have
lost her friendship, I have endured her reproaches; yes, my friend Agnes de
Romani has subjected herself to reproach, and conscious that she deserved it,
received it in passive silence, nor dared to vent her full heart in aught but
tears. Oh! Augustina, how am I fallen! I have this morning received a summons
to return home; tomorrow I leave the convent, tomorrow I bid adieu to
Vieurville. I am expected to receive the hand of the Count -- it is a vain hope,
I am determined to refuse him -- I cannot be the wife of Vieurville, I will
never be the wife of another -- my grave would be a welcomer bridal bed, than
to share a diadem with De la Rue. Augustina, pity me, but do not hate me.

AGNES.

LETTER III.
I HAVE refused him. I have borne a father's anger, a mother's tears, but still
continue resolute. Alas! Augustina, how easy is it to assume courage and
fortitude when the heart is interested. Methinks for Vieurville I could bear,
without complaining, the heaviest ills to which human nature is subject.

My father has just lest me, he has offered the Count my younger sister
Theodora, he has accepted her, and I am to take the veil, and give up my
fortune in return for this condescension, I have consented with alacrity. Oh
Vieurville, what a sacrifice I make for you. Tomorrow I return to the convent,
and enter on my novitiate. Augustina, pity me, pray for me, and, if you can
forget her errors, still love your

AGNES.

LETTER IV.
EIGHT months of my novitiate is past, and I have never heard of Vieurville.
But what is Vieurville to me? Am I not going to renounce the world and all its
pleasures; am I not going to devote my future life to my maker? Augustina, are
not my thoughts free, and though my body is immured within the walls of a
cloister, may not my fancy wander, free as air, to Vieurville. Oh! the tortures
of suspense! Could I but know where he was, could I but be satisfied he still
remembers Agnes, methinks I could be content. Write to me, my friend, endeavor
to calm my mind; tell me, Augustina, when I have thrown off the trappings which
mark a child of vanity, will not sweet peace inhabit my bosom, when simplicity
has attired my person? And when the irrevocable vow has past my lips, will not
my perturbed spirits be hushed to rest, and all my soul be rapt in religious
harmony. Oh! no, no, my sweet friend, the massy doors that close on us poor
captives, cannot shut out the busy meddling passions, or stifle the feelings we
receive from nature. The simplicity of our habit is not an index of the purity
of our mind, nor is the kneeling posture, or lifted eye, true indications of
the fervor of religion! Augustina, hypocrisy may dwell in a convent, so may
love, hatred, jealousy, and despair. And is an heart agitated by these
contending passions, a sit sacrifice to be offered at the throne of grace? Will
not your Agnes be the worst of hypocrites, to vow eternal love and faith to her
Maker, when her whole soul is absorbed in a passion for a frail mortal!

I know I distress you, my friend, Oh! pardon the wretched Agnes, if with her
complaining she sometimes dashes with bitter the cup which overflows with
blessings; if you refuse to hear my complaints, where shall the unhappy Agnes
seek for compassion -- had thou never left me I should not have been the
wretch I am.

Adieu. May every blessing heaven can bestow, or you desire, be your portion,
prays the lost

AGNES.

LETTER V.
AUGUSTINA, you will tremble when you receive this, you will think it a
meritorious act to drive from your heart the remembrance of Agnes de Romani;
but if thou have any remaining gleam of compassion in thy gentle bosom, oh give
it way, renounce not thy unhappy friend, but cheer her with one forgiving line.

I have seen Vieurville, I have forfeited my vows, left the convent, and become
a fugitive and an exile, my brain is distracted when I think what I have
suffered this last fourteen days, nor can all my husband's tenderness soothe
me. My pulse throbs, my veins are scorched with heat -- I must throw aside my
pen, my eyes are dim. Augustina, thy dying friend lifts up her soul in prayers
for thy happiness.

After three weeks being confined to my bed, I am at length permitted to
address the compassionate friend of my youth. Raised from the confines of the
grave, I once more pour forth my soul into the bosom of Augustina. I will now
attempt to give you some regular account of the proceedings of last month.
Alas! my friend, my heart will bleed afresh as I trace the painful scenes,
painful they will ever be to my remembrance, for I have drawn inevitable ruin
on the man my soul doated on.

As I had never heard any tidings of Vieurville, from the time I was taken from
the convent, with a design of being married to the Count, till within three
days of the time when my novitiate was expired, I began to look on my
profession as inevitable, and endeavored to bring myself to think of it with
calmness, but still corroding thoughts would sometimes intrude, and overturn my
best resolutions. My only wish was to hear whether Vieurville was alive or
dead, or whether he was married to my rival; but these were particulars I was
never able to discover, as his father and family had quitted Paris soon after
my return to the convent.

There remained but three days now before I was to take the veil, and I
endeavored to fortify my mind against the awful day, with every argument
reason or religion could supply. I was busy in reflecting on the change a few
short hours would make, when one of our boarders asked me to accompany her to
the grate; I complied, and we amused ourselves sometime in chatting to two
English ladies, who were in the parlour; the ladies were just preparing to
leave the convent, when a violent ringing at the gate alarmed us; the portress
ran to open it, and in a moment Vieurville rushed into the parlour. I know not
what I said or whether I spoke at all -- a sudden mist obscured my sight and I
fell to the ground; when I recovered, my friend, the boarder, told me, that
seeing the impetuosity of my lover, she had advised him to leave the convent,
and if he had any thing particular to communicate, to do it by letter, and
enclose it to her. Her friendly soothing greatly contributed to calm my
spirits, and as none of the sisterhood had seen Vieurville, they all remained
ignorant of the interview.

In about three hours I received a letter, in which he told me, nothing but
absolute force should so long have kept him from me; that he had been detained
in Spain by various stratagems, but having at last eluded the vigilance of his
guards, he hurried to Paris, where he presently learnt the sacrifice I was
about to make, he urged my leaving the convent and being united to him by the
most indissoluble bonds; and said, he made no doubt but my father would be
easily led to forgive us. I showed the letter to my young friend, she joined
the persuasions of Vieurville, and said she would undertake to manage my escape
on the very morning on which I was to become professed.

I wrote to my dear Vieurville, and my friend enclosed it in one from herself,
directing him in what manner to proceed. That very evening Edella, (which was
the name of my friend) was seized with a violent indisposition, which would
have made a dupe of even me, had I not been in the secret. She continued ill
all night, and the next day when she desired the abbess to send to a relation
she had about seven miles from Paris, requesting she would send her coach for
her the ensuing morning at eleven o'clock, as she thought a few days spent in
the country, would be of infinite service to her. Vieurville was ordered to
send a carriage at nine, and it being the last morning of my novitiate, I
desired not be disturbed till it was time for me to enter the chapel. This
request I knew would be complied with, as it would be supposed, I wished for
time for meditation. Accordingly I early left my cell, and going to Edella's
apartment, dressed myself in some of her clothes, and put on a long black hood
which would pull over the face; thus attired, I waited anxiously for a ring at
the gate and guessing it was the coach, hurried down stairs, and so prevented
the portress from coming up to call Edella. I met several of the nuns as I
passed from her apartment to the door, but they neither spoke to me, nor
attempted to stop me. I got out of the convent unsuspected, and in less than an
hour was in a place of safety, where a priest immediately united me to my dear
Vieurville. My first desire was that we should fly to my father for his
protection, entreat his pardon and blessing, and through his intercession be
again received into the church, from whence I was certain we should be
excommunicated. It was midnight when I arrived at my father's, he had been
returned from Paris near four hours, whither he had rapaired to see me take the
veil, and was then, overcome with fatigue and disappointment, just retired to
rest. I would not permit the servant to inform his master that I was come home,
but following him up stairs, threw myself on my knees by his bedside. He
started at seeing me, fury flashed from his eyes, and grasping my hand with
violence, he cried, Agnes, ungrateful girl, why are you here? With tremulous
accents, I in a few words told him I was married, and entreated his pardon and
friendship.

Oh! never shall I forget his answer, it was awful, 'twas more than nature could
support. He spurned me from him, he cursed me, and imprecated the wrath of
heaven on his head if ever he forgave me. "I will not, said he, precipitate
your impending fate, by betraying you to the ecclesiastical powers; go hasten
to leave France, and if you can be happy oppressed by the weight of a father's
curse, may you be so! -- Hence, begone, you offend my sight."

Vieurville forced me out of the room. During the time of my petitioning for
pardon, my mother had arose, she followed me down stairs, blessed me, and
promised to use her interest with my father, to effect a reconciliation. She
gave me all the cash she possessed and some jewels that had been presented me
by a relation. When I embraced her for the last time, it seemed like rending
soul and body asunder; but hope, that sweet soother of the human mind, bore me
up, and I flattered myself we should one day meet again.

When we left my father's house, we set forward immediately for Calais, and
from thence embarked for Dover, where, overcome by agitation and fatigue, I was
seized with a sever which brought me to the verge of the grave. During my
illness Vieurville wrote to his father, and we now anxiously await the arrival
of an answer. Oh! may it be propitious, but my sad heart presages I shall never
more know happiness: For myself, I could have borne it patiently, but when I
think I have involved my dear Vieurville in misery, my brain sickens and almost
madness ensues.

My dearest Augustina, if you do not resolve to hate me, by one kind line
convey some gleam of comfort to the agonizing heart of.

AGNES.

LETTER VI.
WHEN will my portion of misery be full, when shall I say there is 'no more to
suffer. When I am laid in the silent grave, when my eyes close on this world
and open to immortality, then Augustina may say, Agnes is at peace!

Though I have not received a line from your once friendly hand, I still think
you have not forgotten me, and having no other prop whereon to lean, I still
pour forth my sorrows to you. My mother, my only friend, is torn from me, and I
have the additional misery of thinking my disobedience precipitated her end;
she drooped from the day I left France, and her confidential servant informed
me, her last breath was spent in entreating my father to pardon me, but he was
inexorable.

Vieurville has received an answer from his father; but, oh! my Augustina, what
killing lines did it contain. Donna Clara had conceived a passion for her
cousin, and from the time of his leaving Spain, fell into a profound
melancholy, and when she heard of his marriage, the agitation of her spirits
became too much for her weak frame to support, and a rapid decline carried her
an early victim to the grave. Vieurville is disinherited, disowned, and loaded
with a father's anger; but will you believe it, my friend, he still loves the
woman who has brought those misfortunes upon him; but that love, that warm
mutual affection that subsists between us serves only to heighten our misery --
for oh! what torture can compare to that of seeing the object we love
overwhelmed with distress we have not the power to mitigate? --

I am a mother, Augustina, but far from feeling transport when clasping my
infant to my heart, methinks his innocent eyes reproach me with bringing him
into the world, when his only birthright is wretchedness. Poverty, with
haggard countenance, and famine, with cold griping hand, have taken up their
abode in our dwelling. Must I write it, must the daughter of de Romani tell her
friend, she is in want of almost the common necessaries of life! -- Oh! bitter
reflection, hard, hard task, Agnes must solicit charity of her friend
Augustina! -- And, alas! my friend, unless relief comes soon, we must perish!
for in this strange land what can we do? We cannot work, and (notwithstanding
the known humanity of the British nation) we are ashamed to beg.

Oh! how blind are the dictates of passion! how erroneous are its judgments!
may none of my sex henceforth listen to its delusive arguments, but by adhering
to the precepts of reason, avoid the miseries of.

AGNES.

LETTER VII.
IF ever this reaches the hand of my everloved Augustina Savillion, enquire for
my children, and be to them a mother; entreat the Marquis to take them under
his protection, for a few short days will render them orphans. We have passed
from one degree of wretchedness to another, till a bundle of straw, a dry
crust, and a few rags that cover our emaciated frames, are the whole of our
worldly possessions, and to increase my affliction, six weeks since I brought
into the world another child of sorrow.

Gracious heaven! could words convey to my Augustina the extent of my misery,
could she but for a moment, even in idea, experience my sufferings; -- but may
the beneficent power that rules the world avert from her even the shadow of
such afflictions, may my bitterest enemy never experience the pangs that at
present harrow up my soul.

I am a mother, I hear the darling of my heart, the child of my bosom asking
for food, and have it not to give him. I am a wife, and see my adored, my
almost idolized husband, sinking under the complicated evils of famine, grief
and sickness, yet have neither comfort or consolations to offer. Let the wife,
the mother, judge of my tortures, they are agonies that may be felt, but cannot
be described.

Augustina, this is the last time I shall ever address you; this night the
wretched Agnes must lay her head upon the earth, with no canopy but the skies.
Oh! my children, Oh! my beloved Vieurville, thy mother, thy wife has murdered
thee.

Adieu. If thou have any children, tell them my story, and teach them to subdue
their passions. We are incompetent judges of what will promote our own
happiness. Oh! that I had never --

Here the unfortunate Agnes breaks off, this was the letter found in her
pocket, and in all probability was written the day before her death.

To attempt a comment on this story would be an insult to your snderstandings;
I shall therefore leave you to make your own reflections, and wishing you every
happiness, throw aside my pen. Adieu, I need not tell you how much I am your
friend,

MENTORIA.

The author cannot help here remarking, that as this story is authentic and not
the offspring of fancy, she hopes it will make a lasting impression on the
minds of her fair readers.

MARIAN AND LYDIA. PART I.
"She sets like stars that fall to rise no more."

THE sun was sunk beneath the western hills, his parting beams made the horizon
flame with burnished gold, and darted on the topmost branches of the lofty
trees of a neighboring sorest. Autumn had not put off her pleasing robe, nor
had the gentle zephyr forsook the plain to give place to his rude brother
Boreas. The ground was strewed with leaves of various hues, the ripened fruit
hung on the bending trees, and fields of waving golden grain rendered the scene
delightful.

Marian and Lydia having finished their daily task, set aside their wheels with
alacrity, and tying on their straw bonnets, prepared to enjoy the beauties of
the evening, by rambling over the adjacent fields and meadows.

They were innocent and sprightly as the young fawn that lightly bounds over
the verdant lawn; smiling youth and rosy health glowed upon their cheeks, and
sparkled in their eyes; their wishes untaught by art or luxury to stray beyond
the bounds which simple nature has marked out, were easily supplied; they arose
each morn with the feathered choristers, and cheerfully pursued their daily
labor; the evening was their time for mirth. Innocence presided over all their
pleasures, and meek-eyed content on downy pinions hovered over their homely
couch, sweetening their quiet slumbers.

Their cottage was situated in a pleasant valley, on the borders of Wales; it
was plain and rural, it contained every necessary, but no superfluities;
simplicity had decorated it, and the neatness of its furniture rendered it more
pleasing to* the rustic inhabitants than the most sumptuous palace.

Here Marian and Lydia, by their cheerfulness and industry, enlivened the
declining hours of their mother Dorcas.

Beware, said the careful mother, beware, my children, tarry not too long, lest
the evening damps should impair your health, and rob your mother of her only
comforts.

The sisters departed, and as they wandered over the fields, in the innocent
gaiety of their hearts, carroled forth their songs in wild, untutored, but
melodious notes.

Sir George Lovemore had arrived a few days before at Gwinfred-Hall, to visit a
maiden aunt, whose unlimited fortune demanded this mark of respect, for the
virtues of her mind, or the sweetness of her manner he was totally unacquainted
with. Mrs. Gwinfred's unaffected piety, good humor, and amiable disposition,
were things totally disregarded by the young libertine, though the visit was
professedly made to her, yet he spent but a small share of his time in her
company. He was continually rambling from one place to another, making visits
to those neighboring gentlemen whose opinions and manners most suited with his
own. He was this evening returning from a visit to the Earl of Landaff, he was
seated in an elegant phaeton, drawn by four beautiful bays, his servants were
in their best traveling liveries, which were green faced with buff, and
superbly trimmed with gold lace, they proceeded slowly, the animals seeming to
partake of their master's indolence.

Marian and Lydia had wandered to the road, and were just crossing it with an
intent to enter a small wood on the other side, when this magnificent equipage
impeded their way. They had never before seen any thing half so grand -- they
stopped involuntarily to admire it as it passed; the wind had blown off
Marian's bonnet, her luxuriant brown hair falling in ringlets over her face and
neck, served as a shade to heighten but not obscure her charms.

Sir George caught a glimpse of her person, and in her little white jacket,
simple, unadorned, she appeared to him like a wood nymph; her form was
delicate, her stature rather below the middling size. He alighted from his
phaeton, and offering his hand to Marian, said he would assist her in crossing
the road; he seized her unreluctant hand, he gazed earnestly upon her face, and
felt in a moment his heart was captivated by this rustic fascinating beauty;
the modest inobtrusive charms of Lydia were unnoticed, he called her sister by
a thousand divine appellations, which, as they had never heard them before, at
once excited their wonder and their fears.

Leave us, good Sir, said Lydia, for we must return home, and should our mother
see you, she would be angry with us; besides, Sir, we country maidens are not
used to converse with such grand folks, and mayhap you will laugh at our
simplicity. They then dropped their curtsies, and wishing him a good night,
would have left him, but he stopped Marian, and attempted rudely to salute her;
she shrieked, struggled, and at length freeing herself from his hold, caught
her sister's hand, and darting across the field, they were presently out of
sight.

Sir George gazed after them for a moment, then, ascending his carriage,
determined in his own mind to attempt the seduction of Marian. He made no doubt
but she would again walk the same way, and resolved every night to ramble out
in hopes of meeting her.

The sisters slackened not their pace till they arrived within sight of their
mother's cottage. Dorcas, uneasy at their long stay, had walked forth to meet
them; their haste and confusion alarmed her. Tell me, my children, said she,
why are you thus agitated? Has any thing frightened you, or has any of the
low-bred clowns insulted you? Why would you walk so late?

Dear mother, cried Lydia, a gentleman stopped us, and was so rude to my sister.

Not very rude, said Marian, interrupting her, he only wanted to kiss me, and I
ran away from him. But you cannot think what a fine gentleman he was, so
handsome, and he had such a pretty thing to ride in; dear, dear, how I should
like to ride in such an one.

I am surprised, Marian, said Dorcas, gravely, to hear you talk thus; it
becomes not a girl of your humble station to speak in such raptures of the
beauty of a gentleman, or the grandeur of his equipage, much less to form
wishes to be indulged by riding in it.

Why surely, dear mother, said she, it is no harm to wish.

It is wrong, my dear child (replied the tender mother) very wrong to form
wishes which we are certain, from the situation in which it has pleased
Providence to place us, can never be laudably gratified. You know, Marian, it is
impossible you can ever possess a splendid equipage.

Oh! dear, said Marian, I do not think so; mayhap the fine gentleman may be in
love with me; I am sure he called me by many pretty names.

Dorcas shook her head, and sighed. And how, said she, looking mournfully at
Marian, how has vanity found entrance in a heart I had hoped was the seat of
innocence and content.

Don't be angry with my sister, dear mother, said Lydia, to be sure the
gentleman did talk a great deal about beauty and goddesses, but I dare say he
meant nothing.

That Is nothing but envy, said Marian, peevishly, because he did not say any
thing to you. For of what use would it be to him to say I was the loveliest
girl he ever saw, if he did not think so; that would be fibbing for fibbing's
sake.

Dorcas smiled at her simplicity, while she regretted that those sparks of
vanity which had ever lain dormant, had by flattery been blown into a flame.
They entered the cottage, and sat down to a rural supper of milk and fruit;
during the repast Marian could think nor speak of aught beside the gentleman.

Lydia was silent, and Dorcas now and then sighed profoundly, while a tear fell
as she reverted in her thoughts to occurrences long since past; when they had
finished their temperate meal, she thus addressed her daughters.

My dear children, said she, you have often heard me say, that you lost your
father when you were quite infants: in that I told you truth; he is lost,
irreparably lost to you and me, but it was not death that tore him from us. I
have ever avoided mentioning any of the occurrences of my past life, lest it
should pain your gentle affectionate hearts, but I find now the hour is arrived
when the mother's sorrows shall serve as a warning to the daughters, to teach
them to avoid those shoals and quicksands on which were wrecked her happiness
and peace.

Listen attentively, and while you weep over my misfortunes, let the errors
which brought them on me sink deep in your hearts; remember they were the cause
of your mother's ruin, and shun them through the course of your own lives as
you would any poisonous or obnoxious reptile.

THE HISTORY OF DORCAS. PART II.
I WAS the only daughter of a farmer in the West of England. He in his youth,
by integrity and fidelity, so well recommended himself to the favor of the
nobleman, of whom at that time he rented a farm, that he made him steward of
all his estates, which were situated in that country.

I had the misfortune to lose my mother before I had seen sixteen years; she
was a woman of exemplary piety, she had early inculcated in my mind a love of
religion and virtue, and taught me that humility, charity, and cheerful content
were the true marks of Christianity. -- Had I never suffered those excellent
precepts to depart from my mind, I should never have experienced the many
miseries which have since marked my unhappy life.

During the life of this worthy parent I lived extremely retired, she
superintended my education, which was such as might render me a useful member
of society, but she bestowed very little time on the shewy accomplishments
which are set so high a price on in the present age, and which, though they are
certainly necessary to finish the education of a gentlewoman, are very
immaterial to those who expect to move but in the middle sphere.

After my mother's decease I took the entire charge of my father's family upon
me, did the honors of his table, received and entertained all his visitants,
and made frequent excursions abroad; I was thoughtless, vain, and giddy. I
never before heard the voice of adulation, which now assailed my ears from
almost every man with whom I conversed. I listened to it eagerly, and like my
simple Marian placed an implicit faith in all they said.

My heart was full of sensibility, and being deprived of my mother, whom I had
ever considered and loved as a friend, I began to look round for some female
object on whom to settle those affectionate feelings, to whom I might unbosom
all my little inquietudes, consult and advise with on trifling embarassments
and vexations, which at that time I considered as serious troubles.

Unfortunately for me, the Earl of S -- to whom my father was steward, at that
time came into the country, and brought with him his daughter, Lady Laura S --
and a young gentleman whom I shall call Melfont, he was the second son of a
noble family, and though then only nineteen years old, had obtained the rank of
captain in the army; his fortune was large, having inherited his mother's
jointure, but he had chosen the profession of arms, as he thought the character
of a good soldier increased the dignity of the gentleman.

Lady Laura was nearly of my own age, chance one evening threw me in her way,
as I was walking with my father, and though fortune had placed so great a
distance between us, she professed a friendship for me, which highly gratified
my vanity and delighted my father, as he thought it would contribute to my
future advancement in life. -- But alas! my children, it was the source from
whence I might trace all my misfortunes.

Lady Laura was lovely in her person, and gentle in her manners, she possessed
a susceptible heart, and I thought her the pattern of all female perfection;
but in this I was woefully deceived. She had that selfish principle inherent in
her nature, which made her prefer her own happiness to that of the hole world
beside; however, this was an error which I did not discover till she had
brought inevitable ruin on me, and unfeelingly triumphed in the misery she had
occasioned.

From the evening of our first interview she continually formed pretenses to
call at my father's, and at length, by the Earl's permission invited me to pass
a few weeks with her at Seymour Castle. My father joyfully consented to my
accepting the proffered honor, and the day being appointed, Lady Laura herself
came in the chariot to fetch me.

It was near dinner time when I arrived, I felt myself rather abashed on being
presented to the Earl, and conscious of my inferiority, my face glowed with
confusion. Lord S -- was a venerable and truly worthy nobleman; he said many
obliging things to me, which in some measure encouraged me, and I began to look
and speak with a tolerable degree of freedom, when being informed that dinner
was served, the Earl led me into the dining room and presented me to Captain
Melfont.

All my confusion now returned. I blushed, trembled, and hardly knew how I
behaved during dinner, I had never before conversed with a man so well-bred,
polite, and agreeable as Captain Melfont. I wished to appear engaging, and
conscious of my own insignificance, shrunk as it were into nothing, and a
thousand times wished myself at home again. All day I was uneasy and
dissatisfied with myself, every accomplishment Lady Laura displayed, made me
regret not possessing the same, that I might equally with her contribute to the
amusement and share the applause of Melfont.

In the course of a few days my constraint gradually decreased, the polite
freedom with which I was treated by Lady Laura, and the pointed attentions I
experienced from Melfont, contributed to raise me in my own esteem, and I
became cheerful and happy.

As I had ever been accustomed to early rising, I was in general up some hours
sooner than Lady Laura, and usually spent the time till breakfast in the
garden, sometimes with a book, and sometimes with my work. Melfont had
frequently joined me in these little morning excursions, and I believe it was
the pleasure I experienced in his company, which made me so often repeat them.
At first he was polite, unconstrained and cheerful, but he soon grew
thoughtful, pensive, and even absent. I saw the change with regret; I almost
unknown to myself shared his uneasiness, and whenever he sighed involuntarily,
echoed his sighs responsively.

At length I assumed courage to enquire the cause of his melancholy; he
hesitated for a few moments, and then in faultering accents declared himself my
lover, at the same time saying, he had not the least hope of ever being happy,
conjured me to forget him, pressed my hand to his lips, and left me with
precipitation.

I now discovered the state of my own heart, I felt the greatest satisfaction
in the knowledge of being beloved; but my affliction was great when I reflected
he had said an insurmountable barrier was placed between us. I was weak enough
to shed tears, and could hardly summon composure enough to attend Lady Laura,
at the usual hour of breakfast -- though I was conscious that the indulging an
hopeless passion would entail lasting misery upon me, I never once attempted to
subdue it, or stifle emotions which my own reason told me were improper and
imprudent in a young person in my humble station; though I am certain, had I
when I first discovered my growing partiality for Melfont, immediately left
Seymour Castle, returned home, and by entering with avidity into all my usual
avocations, strove to banish him from my mind, and cautiously avoided all
opportunities of seeing or conversing with him, I should soon have conquered
the predeliction, and regained my usual tranquillity, but I wanted resolution to
fly the society of a man whose presence I fancied constituted my chief
happiness.

Solitude is the nurse of youthful passion -- in this I was fully indulged at
Seymour Castle, being allowed to pass my time in a manner most suitable to my
own inclination, whilst Lady Laura was engaged with her several masters, who
yet daily attended her. I had at the same time contracted a habit of reading
for several hours in the day, and unfortunately in the late Countess's library
met with several novels, a sort of reading with which my dear girls are totally
unacquainted; these books served only to soften my mind and increase my
passion, so that by never attempting to repel it in its first approach, it in
time gained an entire ascendency over my heart, formed a part of my existence,
twined round the chords of life, and can be extinguished only by the hand of
death.

Here Dorcas paused to give vent to her tears; Marian wept with her; Lydia
threw her arms round her mother's neck, and kissing off the drops as they fell
upon her cheeks, vowed that no action of hers should ever increase the anguish
which already weighed down her too susceptible heart. They then retired for the
night, Lydia to the soft repose that ever attends youth and innocence; Marian
to reflect on the fine things Sir George had said, and Dorcas to weep over past
afflictions.

THE HISTORY OF DORCAS CONTINUED. PART II.
THE sun had just darted his rays upon the distant mountains, the dew still
glittered on the waving grass, when Dorcas forsook her restless couch, and
summoned her daughters to their daily labor, having paid their adoration to
the divine disposer of all things, and partook of a (...) breakfast, she again
continued her recital.

For several mornings after the explanation I mentioned, I repaired as usual to
the garden, but Melfont did not join me, indeed he seemed particularly studious
to avoid every opportunity of conversing with me without a third person being
present. I was extremely uneasy at this conduct, I imagined he supposed me too
much his inferior to be made the honorable partner of his fortune, and in my
heart I thanked him for that honor, which prevented his soliciting me on other
terms; yet the visible constraint he put upon himself in attempting to appear
cheerful, pained me excessively; I became absent, melancholy and dejected.

Lady Laura frequently interrogated me in her lively manner on the cause of my
altered diposition, and one morning when Melfont was in the room, she jocularly
said, "Why, my good cousin Charles, what in the name of wonder possesses you to
be so dull, one would think some enchantment prevailed at Seymour Castle, and
that the very air was infections, here is my lively Dory, metamorphosed into
musing melancholy; and you, my late giddy cousin become the grave sentimental
philosopher. I verily believe a certain blind deity has been busy with you,
come hither, Charles, let me see where the arrow entered, is the wound deep?"

Melfont answered rather peevishy, and left the room. I felt my face glow and
my heart throbbed violently, Lady Laura saw my emotion, "Poor dear, said he,
did it fall in love, and had it no hope; well, well, never mind it, 'twas all
involuntary I Will be sworn."

Oh! Lady Laura, said I, despise me not for my weakness. -- I could say no
more, tears burst from my eyes, and I hid my face with my handkerchief.

"My dear Dory, said she, taking my hand, I did not mean to pain your gentle
heart, I have long seen the tenderness subsisting between my cousin and you,
and assure you it has given me peculiar pleasure; but my sweet little friend,
you must be rather cautious to guard your secret, for should my father discover
it, he will use every method to prevent an union between you ever taking place,
for Charles Melfont is designed by him the husband of your Laura."

Had I been transfixed by lightning, my countenance could not have expressed
more horror and surprise. I felt in a moment that I must appear a monster of
ingratitude in the eyes of the Earl, when he should find I had thus, though
unintentionally counteracted his designs, in regard to his daughter's future
settlement. I told Lady Laura, after what I had just heard, I should think
myself unpardonable to remain any longer at Seymour Castle, or ever suffer
Melfont to entertain me again in the character of a lover. I requested her to
suffer me to return home, and said, I would, if possible, avoid ever seeing him
again.

She laughed at what she called my delicate scruples, and told me, she had in
her own mind planned out future schemes of happiness for us all; for to tell
you the truth, said she, I have no great inclination to Charles, being engaged
both by inclination and solemn promises, to a young man of no great fortune,
though of a good family; he is at present only an ensign in the guards, so that
I am certain my father will never consent to our union; but you know, my dear
Dory, if you accept Melfont, I can then avow my choice openly, and you will at
once render yourself happy, and confer an obligation on your friend.

In this manner did the artful Laura work on my feelings, and at length won
Melfont over to her party. We were frequently witnesses to private interviews
between her lover and herself, and in a short time so far forgot what was due
to our parents, and to our own interest and honor, that we not only planned her
escape but accompanied her flight, and the same ceremony united Lady Laura to
Mr. Walsh, and your mother to Melfont.

When we returned to Seymour Castle we found it a seat of tumult and confusion;
the Earl refused us admittance, and my father, irritated at my ingratitude to
his patron and benefactor, would not suffer me to enter his habitation, nor did
I from that unhappy day ever see him; my behavior had made such an impression
on his mind, that he fell into a deep melancholy, which soon put a period to
his existence; the whole of his possessions were left to his nearest male
relation, and my name was only mentioned in the will, that he might reprobate
my ingratitude.

I can truly say, the affliction I felt when informed of his decease, proceeded
solely from the reflection, that I deserved his anger, and had not seen him or
endeavored to gain his pardon before his death.

The anguish of my heart was beyond expression, but the unremitting tenderness
which I experienced from my husband soon hushed my griefs to rest, and I became
tranquil, and even happy. -- Alas! this scene of serene pleasure was not long
to last; it fleeted away like a vision, and like a passing shadow left no trace
behind.

One year of connubial love was past, when you, my beloved girls, were in one
day ushered into the world. Melfont was disappointed, he had hoped for a boy,
as his family had never been reconciled to what they termed so disproportionate
a match, he imagined such an event might in some measure have conciliated their
regard, but the birth of my daughters frustrated these hopes; however he still
continued the kind attentive husband.

I lived extremely retired, consoling myself for the loss of every pleasure
which a person of my age might wish to enjoy, in Melfont's affection; and while
that continued I had no wish ungratified.

Lady Laura frequently visited me; her father had never forgiven her
precipitate marriage, nor did he ever give her any fortune.

Walsh had married more from the hope of aggrandizing himself than from any
affection he felt for her Ladyship. When he found these hopes were illusive he
threw off the mask, and treated her with contempt and unkindness, by which
means he rendered her life extremely wretched.

She saw the love and harmony which subsisted between your father and me, and
from that spirit of envy which hates to see happiness in another family, which
it cannot enjoy at home, she determined to undermine my felicity, and render me
as completely wretched as herself.

There is a caprice in the heart of man, or rather a depravity in their
natures, which leads them to neglect and despise a woman totally in their
power, and pursue with avidity those who by almost insurmountable obstacles,
are placed at a distance from them. This was exactly the case with Melfont.
When Lady Laura was offered to him by her father, when wealth and honor would
have attended his acceptance of her, he rejected her -- but now, irrevocably
united to me, and Laura the wife of another, he began to feel a passion for
her, and to wish he had not married so precipitately.

This passion was at first admitted into his bosom under the mask of pity, he
would listen to the frequent complaints she made of her hard fate, soothe her
distress, and offer every consolation in his power.

For some time I joined him in endeavoring to alleviate the sorrows of the
unhappy Laura; but at length his attentions to her became too pointed to escape
the penetrating eye of watchful tenderness, and I was unable to stifle that
jealousy which I had long strove to suppress.

However afflicted I might be, at the visible alteration in your father's
manner, I suffered no complaint to break forth, but nursed my corroding sorrows
in silence and solitude; in his presence I endeavored to appear cheerful,
though my heart was almost broken by his unkindness.

Two years had passed in this dreadful manner, when Mr. Walsh died, and Lady
Laura became a blooming widow. Lord S --, her father, was at that time upon the
continent, therefore she had no opportunity to make an immediate personal
application to him for reconciliation.

Lady Laura had long treated me with a cool hauteur, she now no longer wore
even the semblance of politeness, but whenever she came to the house, would
either not speak to me at all, or treat me with the most cruel disrespect. I
ventured to complain to Melfont of her ungenerous behavior, when his answer
struck me almost dumb with sorrow and astonishment.

I am surprised, Madam, said he, that you should complain to me in this manner,
what right have you to expect particular attention from a woman of Lady Laura's
distinction, I think she does you too much honor by condescending to enter the
house where you live. You should consider, Dory, you are only my mistress.

Your mistress, Melfont?

Yes, surely; you know I was under age when the ceremony was performed. I have
never introduced you to my family as my wife, nor have they ever considered you
as such."

I heard no more, a cold damp came over me, I shuddered and fell lifeless to
the floor. -- When I recovered, I found your cruel father had left me, in that
state of insensibility, to the care of the servants. I gave free vent to my
sorrows in a flood of tears, and then summoning all the fortitude I could to my
assistance, called for pen and ink, and wrote a letter to Melfont, a copy of
which I have preserved.

TO MELFONT.
SIR,
SINCE you inform me I am not your wife, be assured I retain too high a sense
of honor to remain with you on any other terms; but do not flatter yourself!
mean tamely to give up a title which I think I have an undoubted right to,
having received it at the altar, and borne it three years, during which time I
have never disgraced it by thought, word, or action. Before you receive this, I
shall be far advanced on my way toward Paris, where I mean to submit my cause
to the decision of the Earl of S --, who, though I have greatly injured, is the
only person I can at this time with propriety apply to, or hope to receive
assistance from. I know him to be a nobleman of too much honor and humanity to
suffer an insult offered to an unprotected woman to go unrevenged. He is the
friend of the widow and the fatherless, and in that rank I must place myself,
and your unhappy children, till you restore me to that which no action of mine
has ever forfeited.

Your affectionate, but injured wife, DORCAS MELFONT.


When I had finished this letter I ordered a chaise and four, and bidding the
servant put up a few things, took you, my beloved girls, and desiring the
letter might be delivered to your father when he came home, which I knew would
not be till late at night, set off full speed to Dover.

We traveled all night, and was lucky enough to arrive just as a packet was
sailing for Calais, I immediately embarked, a few hours wafted us across the
channel, and I then traveled with as much speed as possible to Paris. It was
late when I arrived, and being greatly fatigued with my journey, I determined
to stay till the next morning before I waited on the Earl. I took an hasty
supper and retired, in hope to recruit my exhausted frame by sleep.

The next morning I arose early, and dressing myself, took my dear children in
my hand, and repaired to the Earl's. I was with difficulty admitted, and when I
entered the room where his Lordship was at breakfast, my agitation was so great
I could scarcely stand.

Dorcas! said his Lordship, starting from his seat.

Oh! my Lord, said I, (throwing myself at his feet, and presenting my girls to
him) behold a miserable woman and two helpless infants, who without your
assisting hand must be plunged in infamy and inevitable ruin.

Rise, Dorcas, said his Lordship, explain yourself, your agitation at present
deranges your ideas.

I then in a few words told him, that Melfont had disowned me for his wife, and
that I was certain he meant to marry Lady Laura.

Heaven forbid, said the Earl, that my poor infatuated girl should add such an
heinous offense against humanity, to the catalogue of her former crimes. Oh!
Dorcas, her undutiful behavior has been like a viper preying upon my heart;
and to increase my affliction, I have been told she has dishonored even the man
for whom she forsook her father's protection. But this will be an act to make
honor and humanity blush. Be comforted, continued he, for the sake of these
poor innocents, I will not suffer your wrongs to pass unnoticed or unredressed.
Cheared by these kind expressions I returned to my lodgings, with a heart
considerably lightened, and was desired to call on the Earl again in about ten
days, when he should have had time to consult what was best to be done. On the
appointed morning I repaired to the Earl, I found him seated at a table
writing, a letter lay unfolded before him.

Dorcas, said he, (rising and leading me to a seat) I have received letters
from England since I saw you.

Do they mention me, my Lord?

Yes, they say you have long led a very dissolute life, and that you have
eloped from your husband with a young officer, and taken with you a quantity of
money and jewels.

Heaven forgive them, said I, and burst into tears.

But this is not all, my poor girl, continued the Earl, you have worse trials
than this to encounter.

Then I hope God will give me fortitude to support them, said I, but indeed my
heart is almost broke already. However, my Lord, let me know the worst, and I
will endeavor to bear it with patience.

Melfont is married to Lady Laura.

Cruel Melfont, how have I deserved this inhuman usage.

After you left me the other day, said the Earl, I sent a messenger express to
endeavor to procure a certificate of your marriage, and to take a letter to
Laura, promising pardon and forgetfulness of all that was past if she would not
marry Melfont, but in case she chose to follow the bent of her own depraved
inclination, to never assure the title of my daughter again, for from that
moment I would disown her. My messenger returned yesterday, and informs me, it
is impossible to procure a certificate, as the clergyman who married you was
dead, and that the day after you left England, Melfont publicly espoused Lady
Laura.

Merciful heaven, said I, (sinking on my knees) to your care I commit my dear
injured children. Oh! suffer them not to be punished for the sins of their
parents; make me the object of thy wrath for my disobedience and ingratitude,
but Oh! of thy infinite mercy avert the shafts of keen adversity from the bosom
of my beloved girls.

The Earl was affected, he dropped a tear in compassion to my anguish, and
promised to be my protector. The next day he gave me a deed, in which he
settled this cottage and its appendages, with one hundred pounds a year, on me
during my life, and to be continued to my children as long as they by their
conduct should merit his protection. I remained in France a few days, just to
recruit my strength and spirits, and then set forward for this place, where I
have lived now seventeen years, endeavoring to form the minds of my children
in such a manner, that the follies which occasioned their mother misfortunes
might never find entrance in their hearts.

Oh! Marian, listen not to the voice of adulation, stifle every rising
ambitious thought, be humble, be innocent, and be happy.

THE YOUNG LADY's FRIEND.
MARIAN AND LYDIA CONTINUED. PART IV.
MARIAN listened attentively to the affecting recital of her mother's sorrow,
but every syllable sunk deep into the heart of Lydia. I will daily think of
your distresses, my dear mother, said she, and they will serve as a shield to
my heart, and render it invulnerable to the attacks of vanity or the illusion
of passion.

And is my father living? said Marian.

I know not, replied her mother, but if he is, he can never be any thing to
you, he has renounced us all.

It was inhuman, my dear mother, to deprive us of that rank in life, we were
born to fill, and which I flatter myself we should not have disgraced.

Foolish Marian, said the anxious mother, why regret the loss of such a trifle:
be virtuous, my child, you will then elevate the most humiliating station, and
rise superior to those whose only boast is wealth and titles, to render them
the envy of the blind misguided multitude. Virtue alone is true nobility;
content is real happiness.

Lydia's heart responsive echoed her mother's sentiments -- Marian sighed and
was silent.

The moon in majestic splendour illumined the sky, and darted her silver beams
through the ancient elms that shaded Dorcas's cottage. The sisters were feated
by the door, and in obedience to their mother's command, were pouring forth
their thanksgiving to the giver of all blessing in an evening hymn. They had
just finished when a rustling among the bushes made them start; a beautiful
pointer ran into the cottage, and in a moment a servant in livery appeared, and
enquired the way to Gwinfred-Hall. Dorcas directed him which way to go. He said
he was weary, requested a drop of water, and leave to rest. Lydia went to fetch
him some cider, Dorcas moved toward the door, and silently admired the beauty
of the spangled firmament.

The man seized the opportunity, and delivered to the lovely unsuspecting
Marian a letter from Sir George Lovemore.

Love and ambition had already taught her art, she hastily took the offered
letter, and hid it in her bosom. Alas! simple maid, you there fostered a
serpent, whose subtle poison tainted your very heart. The servant having
completed his errand retired, and Marian found means to peruse her letter; --
it abounded with professions of love, vows of everlasting fidelity, and
encomiums on her beauty. She read it with rapture, and though so recently
warned of the duplicity of men, believed every syllable it contained. In
conclusion, he solicited a private interview the next morning, in the field
adjoining her mother's cottage. Marian paused at this request, hesitated --
read the letter again and resolved to comply.

During supper she was thoughtful and absent, and when the usual hour of rest
arrived, she retired with an anxious perturbed mind; sleep was a stranger to
her eyes, and several times she almost resolved to show the letter to Lydia,
and request her to accompany her -- But then Sir George had desired her to come
alone, he might be offended and she might never see him again. Vanity also
pleaded, he might marry her, raise her to an exalted station, and should his
views be otherwise than honorable, she certainly had resolution to withstand
his solicitations.

In this manner did she wear out the tedious night, at five o'clock she stole
softly from the side of her innocent sleeping sister, and with as little noise
as possible opened the door that led into the fields. Aurora had but faintly
streaked the eastern skies with mingled gold and purple, when the ill-fated
Marian met her lover.

He thanked her for her condescension, told her his whole happiness depended on
her, and urged her immediate flight with him to London.

Marian hesitated, her mother, her sister, hung heavy at her heart.

Sir George was an adept in the art of seduction, he talked of gaiety, splendour
and pleasure, swore she was born to grace the first station, declared it was a
crime to bury so much beauty and sweetness in a desert.

Marian's reason was not convinced, but her vanity was awakened and her senses
dazzled, what wonder then that her scruples were overcome by Sir George's
artful persuasions. She left the mansion of peace and innocence, and in a
chaise which he had prepared for the purpose, hurried as fast as four horses
would carry her to the seat of dissipation and folly.

Marian dropped a tear as she took a last look at the cottage, but Sir George
kissed it off, and the reflection which had caused it to start was instantly
banished from her mind.

Lydia on awakening missed her sister, and hastily rising, ran into her
mother's apartment, vexed that Marian should have been the first to bid her
good morning. I am not used to be such a sluggard, my dear mother, said she,
but my sister has received your blessing before me this morning. I have not
seen your sister, said Dorcas, but as it is a fine morning, she has, no doubt,
rambled out to enjoy its sweets; go, my beloved Lydia and seek her.

Lydia left her mother, and sought her sister in the fields and woods; echo a
thousand times repeated the name as she called her dear Marian; at length
fatigued and dispirited, she was returning home, when she met a shepherd, who
early attended his sheep, that way, and demanded of him whether he had seen her
sister.

He had seen her, he saw her enter the chaise with Sir George, he saw them
drive off.

Lydia heard the heart-rending tidings, she would have wept, but tears refused
their relief; she sighed, raised her hands to heaven in an agony of grief, and
sunk lifeless upon the ground. The shepherd was frightened, nor did he use any
method to restore her, but ran backward and forward, looking wildly round him,
and calling aloud for help. A young gentleman who had been that morning out a
shooting, heard the voice of terror, and hastened to the spot where the hapless
Lydia lay. Her charms were not of the dazzling sort, but the more her features
were examined the more they interested the beholder. The gentleman when he
first raised her from the ground, felt only for her as he would for any other
woman in distress; but when he looked attentively on her face, and beheld her
lovely though inanimate features, he felt an irresistible impulse to defend her
not only from her present uneasiness, but to shield her for ever from pain and
affliction. He carried her to a spring, and bathed her temples with water, she
opened her expressive blue eyes, Oh! my unhappy sister, said she, and freeing
herself from the arms of her deliverer, covered her face with her hands, and
gave free vent to her tears.

Have you lost your sister, my sweet maid, said the stranger.

Alas! Sir, replied Lydia, I fear my poor Marian is worse than dead. A
gentleman has found means to ensnare her innocent unsuspecting heart, and she
has this morning left her only friends to trust the promises of one she never
saw till three days since. I know not how to return to my poor mother with
these fatal tidings, I fear it will go near to break an heart already oppressed
with woes almost too heavy to be borne. "But God tempereth the wind to the
shorn lamb," continued she, raising her eyes to heaven, and no doubt will
inspire her with fortitude to bear, without repining, this heaviest of his
trials.

The stranger reverenced her sorrow, he took her passive hand, drew it under
his arm, and so proceeded silently along toward Dorcas's cottage; he attempted
not to interrupt her grief, but now and then a tear stole down his manly
cheeks, and a responsive sigh answered hers.

When they arrived at the cottage Dorcas met them at the door; Lydia flew
toward her, folded her arms round her neck, and dropping her head on her
bosom, sobbed aloud.

Oh! my beloved, said Dorcas, tell me, has any accident happened to your sister?

She is gone, said Lydia.

What, forever? cried the fond mother eagerly.

Oh! my dear mother, she is lost to us; that gentleman whom we met --

Enough, said Dorcas, I fully understand the extent of my misfortune; my Marian
is dishonored, plunged in infamy; but I will not renounce her, she is my child.
Oh! heavens, none but a parent can judge of the anguish that now harrows up my
soul. But, my sweet Lydia, will you forsake your mother in her old age, will
you leave her gray hairs to sink in sorrow to the grave, without a friend to
cheer her last moments, without the gentle hand of filial love to close her
dying eyes.

Oh! no, cried Lydia, dropping on her knees, never, never; when I forsake my
honored mother, may heaven regardless hear me when I pray, may I be cast out to
sickness, pain and poverty, without a friend to pity or relieve me.

Dorcas embraced her, and the stranger endeavored to dissipate the drops of
humanity which were gathering in her eyes. Lydia by degrees became more
composed, and informed her mother of the obligations she was under to the
gentleman who had accompanied her home.

Oh! Sir, said Dorcas, you are my friend and benefactor, had I lost my Lydia I
had lost my all; but say, by what name shall I remember you in my prayers?

They call me Renfew, Earl of Landaff, said he.

Dorcas started and turned pale -- the Earl continued,

Your sorrow has awakened in my breast every feeling of humanity, and if it is
in my power to be of any service to you, command me, and I will exert it to the
utmost.

Alas! my dear Marian! said Dorcas.

I understand you, replied the Earl, and wish I could restore her to you, but
as that is not in my power, teach me by some other means to promote your
happiness.

My Lord, said Dorcas, there is but one way to give the least satisfaction to
this afflicted heart; leave the cottage immediately, nor ever attempt again to
see or converse with Lydia.

And why this cruel restriction?

Time, my Lord, perhaps may inform you with my reasons for acting thus. At
present I cannot allege the true cause, and will never stoop to a mean
equivocation to excuse an action, which I am sensible is perfectly right.

The Earl was piqued, he bowed and left the cottage.

Lydia, said Dorcas, if you love your mother, you will avoid the Earl of
Landaff.

He is generous and humane, said Lydia,

Trust not to appearances, replied her mother, when you shall learn a tale
which I could tell you, you will then, like me, tremble at the name of Renfew.

Peace, with the speed of a courier, now fled from the mansion of Dorcas,
affliction usurped her place, and with solemn pace each night walked with the
solitary Lydia over those fields and meadows where she once had cheerfully
tripped with her beloved Marian.

In one of these melancholy excursions she was accosted by the Earl of Landaff;
she would have fled, but he prevented her, and in the most eloquent language
true love could inspire, told her how dear she was to him, and how cruel he
thought her mother, in refusing him the pleasure of her conversation.

My mother, replied Lydia, can be actuated by no motive but a wish to promote
my happiness. I esteem you, my Lord, I shall ever remember you with gratitude,
but my mother has forbid me to hold any conversation with you. Adieu, Sir, I
often think of you, but will never have any intercourse with you.

Stay, my sweet Lydia, said the Earl, only say you do not hate me. I swear,
dear maid, my designs are honorable, and if you will put yourself under my
protection, a private marriage shall convince you how sincere my professions
are.

My Lord, replied Lydia, though I acknowledge myself honored by this
declaration, I must decline accepting your offer; I know my rank in life is far
beneath what would be expected in the bride of Landaff, but humble as I am, I
will never become the wife of a man who would be ashamed publicly to own me as
such; nor will I ever clandestinely converse with a person whom my mother has
forbid me to see. My sister, I fear, by her disobedience, has rendered herself
miserable, nor will I, by a like conduct, increase the affliction of my dear
venerable parent.

Landaff expatiated on the many advantages attending wealth and splendour; Lydia
heard him with silent contempt. He told her his only wish was, to make her
happy.

That is impossible, my Lord, said she, the heart of Lydia never can know
happiness while her mother is in affliction, and her sister, perhaps, a
miserable wanderer, exposed to all the wretchedness, want and infamy can entail
on a fallen woman.

All farther persuasion was of no effect, Lydia continued firm in her
resolution of not leaving her mother, and fearful of again meeting the
importunate Earl, avoided for some time her favorite walk, confined herself to
the narrow limits of their garden, and devoted her time entirely to comfort and
cheer her afflicted parent.

The Earl finding no hope of success in drawing Lydia from her duty, and having
too much regard for virtue to force himself into their solitude, with an intent
to rob them of their only treasure, repaired to London, thinking time and
absence would effectually banish her from his memory.

We will now leave Lydia, following her usual innocent avocations, and return
to Marian, who was emerged in the vortex of fashionable folly.

When Sir George persuaded the unsuspecting Marian to leave her home, and trust
to his honor for protection, she had no doubt but his design was to marry her;
he had never told her so indeed, but surely he could mean nothing less -- he
had declared he loved her, and did not men always marry the women they loved?
Thus with fallacious hopes did she quiet each rising fear, and by painting to
herself the pleasure her mother and sister would experience when they should
embrace her as Lady Lovemore, entirely obliterated the pain she felt in
reflecting on the uneasiness they would suffer when her flight should be
discovered.

Sir George had never formed an idea of making her his wife, he saw she was
beautiful, he felt he loved her, and thought by lavishing on her riches and
finery, to which she had hitherto been unaccustomed, to ensnare and lead her an
easy victim to be sacrificed at the shrine of vice. To this end he forbore
taking any liberty during their journey which might alarm her, treated her with
respect and tender attention, and when they arrived in London placed her in an
elegant lodging, with proper servants to wait on her, and left her to ruminate
at leisure on the change in her situation.

The female attendant who was immediately about the person of Marian, was a
girl who had formerly fallen a prey to the arts of Sir George, and now only
enjoyed his bounty for reducing other hapless females to the horrid level with
herself. She was wretched in the loss of her own virtue, and like the spoiler
of mankind, exulted in every opportunity of robbing others of that blessing
herself could no longer enjoy. She treated the innocent Marian with the most
profound respect, led her through a suit of superb apartments and told her, if
she could think of any thing that would add to the elegance or beauty of the
furniture, she need only mention her wishes to have them complied with. She
next displayed a variety of elegant female apparel, toys, jewels, and other
things proper to catch the attention of inexperienced youth, and kindle the
glowing seeds of vanity into a flame that might consume her. She descanted on
the beauty, gallantry and generosity of Sir George, nor left the poor
bewildered girl, 'till she had seen her in bed, and fast locked in the embraces
of Morpheus.

Sophia, for that was the name of Marian's attendant, had learnt the part she
was to act from an old woman, to whom Sir George had wrote the day before he
left Gwinfred-Hall. She knew it would not be prudent to give the artless girl
any time for reflection, or to suffer her thoughts to recur to the friends she
had left in Wales. She therefore entered her apartment at an earlier hour than
is customary for town-bred ladies to rise; she was still asleep.

Sophia watched the moment of awaking, and hurrying her to rise, prevented the
intrusion of busy or perplexing thoughts. She was attired in a fashionable
undress, and before she had time sufficiently to admire either herself or the
beauty of the breakfast apparatus, Sir George was announced.

Marian was now hurried from one scene of dissipation to another for several
days, she was introduced to a large circle of those unhappy women, who purchase
ease and luxury at the price of honor.

She was charmed with the gaiety of their manners and the vivacity of their
conversation. Their precepts, their example, corrupted her heart, and she began
to think a life of licentious love (falsely termed a life of liberty) was alone
a life of happiness -- She forgot her afflicted mother, forgot her innocent
affectionate sister, forgot every precept of virtue and religion, and fell a
voluntary sacrifice to Sir George.

For many months folly wore the 'semblance of pleasure, and riot and
intemperance were mistaken for felicity. But alas! the wretched Marian too late
awoke to a sense of her miserable situation.

Sir George, attracted by a newer face, forsook her; refused her pecuniary
assistance, and even had the unfeeling villainy to betray her into the power of
one of his libertine companions.

At first her grief was violent, but she had been taught a method to stifle the
emotions of her heart by drowning her reason in repeated draughts of strong
liquors. She was soon lost to every sense of shame, and from being once the
admiration of the crowd wherever she moved, became an object of contempt, and
sunk to the horrid state of common prostitution.

MARIAN AND LYDIA. PART V.
IT was a cold evening in autumn, the wind was bleak, the rain fell heavily,
when pinched with famine and shivering with the chilling blasts, Marian
wandered, unfriended and unpitied, round Berkley-Square. -- She had several
times essayed to stop the passengers, and entreat charity, but there was yet a
spark of pride remained unsubdued, which made the supplication appear too
humiliating.

She drew near a door where a carriage was waiting -- Major Renfew came from
the house, and entered it; by the light of a flambeau, which shone on her face,
he discovered Marian -- her features were yet lovely, though pale, and strongly
marked by the oppressive finger of poverty. The Major bockoned her forward --
Who are you said he, surveying her with a scrutinizing eye, and why does your
countenance wear this appearance of misery?

Alas! replied Marian, it is the true index of my heart! I am the daughter of
folly and infamy, but though I own my punishment just, I cannot bear it without
complaining -- I cannot starve in silence!

Various were the emotions that agitated the heart of Major Renfew while he
gazed on the face of Marian; at first he felt something like humanity stirring
in his bosom, but at the second glance it was a more lively emotion, he gave
her a guinea, and appointing her to meet him at ten o'clock, at a house he
mentioned, drove off to pay some visits of ceremony.

Marian felt a warm glow of gratitude play round her heart, she could have
knelt and kissed the hand that had thus seasonably administered relief. She
waited impatiently for the hour of ten, when she might thank her benefactor as
she ought.

Major Renfew was a man of gallantry, he had been some years separated from his
wife, and indulged himself in frequent casual intrigues, which did no great
honor either to the brilliancy of his taste, or the goodness of his heart.

The beauty of Marian, though greatly impaired by intemperance, was yet
striking; the Major at that time was without a favorite, and from the
prepossession he felt in his bosom toward our poor wanderer, he determined to
raise her from the abject state to which she was reduced, to the honorable
station of his mistress; he therefore dispatched his visits as quick as
possible, and repaired to the place of appointment.

Marian met him at the door of the apartment, he gave her his hand, she raised
it to her lips, and attempted to speak, but words were refused, a gush of
silent tears more eloquently spoke her soul's meaning -- the Major was moved,
he made her sit down, and placing himself beside her, began to unfold the
designs he had formed in her favor.

Alas! Sir, said Marian mournfully, I had hoped you would have taken me from
this life of shame, indeed I am sick of what is termed pleasure, I long to sink
into peaceful obscurity, and having just sufficient to supply the wants of
nature, repent my past misdeeds, and wait with patience the appointed hour of
rest. I know not why it is, but I feel I never can return your generosity in
the way you require, and therefore dare not hope for farther favors.

Nay, my dear girl, said the Major, this is affectation; come shake off this
gloom which your misfortunes have occasioned to envelope your mind -- what,
though I am an old man, I will teach you to love me.

Oh! Sir, replied Marian, you have taught me that already, there is nothing
which I should think too hard to perform, to convince you of the grateful
affections of my heart. But I had hoped this sinking fragile frame never would
have known pollution more.

The Major endeavored to calm the perturbation of her spirits, and pressed her
to partake of some excellent champaigne which he had ordered with the supper.
Marian was thoughtful, eat little, and frequently turned her head to hide the
starting tears.

Supper removed he renewed his solicitations, she sunk on her knees, and with
uplifted hands entreated him to grant her relief on other terms, or suffer her
to leave him, and again tempt the miseries of her hard destiny. He was deaf to
her prayers, he attributed them to art -- he raised her from the ground, and
proceeded to unwarrantable liberties -- she made a violent effort, and
springing from his arms, cried, Oh! Dorcas, dear unhappy mother, why did I
leave you, -- then rushing out of the room, ran precipitately into the street.

The exclamation which she made had thrown the Major into a stupor of
astonishment, every faculty was suspended, nor could he recover sufficient
recollection to endeavor to stop her -- a thousand past occurrences rushed
upon his mind, and he remained immovable, his eyes rivetted to the door
through which she had passed.

At length recovering from his surprise, he observed a small shagreen case
which lay on the floor, and during her struggles had dropped from Marian's
bosom. He took it up, with emotion opened it, and the portrait of Dorcas met
his eyes. The case dropped from his unnerved hand, he groaned and fell
senseless to the floor, the noise of his fall brought up a servant of the
house, proper remedies were applied and soon restored him to a keen sense of
his past guilt and treachery to Dorcas, for Major Renfew was the perjured
husband whom Dorcas had concealed under the name of Melfont.

The first thought that struck him was the horrid crime he had so nearly
perpetrated; the next was what was become of his poor ruined child -- His
continual ravings for his Marian, his dear lost daughter, and the evident
incoherence of his discourse led the servants to believe he was seized with a
sudden fit of insanity, and in that belief conveyed him home.

The horror that dwelt upon his mind, and the violent agitation brought on a
fever, and before morning he was insensible to all that passed about him.
Before reason entirely forsook him, he was visited by the Earl of Landaff, who
was his nephew, to him he unfolded the dreadful tale, conjuring him to try
every possible method to discover the unhappy wanderer.

Oh! said he in an agony, "she knelt and prayed, my child entreated me, with
streaming eyes, to snatch her from infamy, and I would not hear her, -- seek
her Landaff, find her, save her from perishing for want." The remembrance was
too acute, and his senses, which were before wavering, took their flight -- but
still his fancy was haunted by the image of Dorcas and Marian, and his agonies
became dreadful, even to those who attended him.

Every enquiry after the hapless Marian was fruitless, and the miserable
Renfew, when a turn of his disorder restored him to reason, found that there
was no hope of recovering the poor wanderer --

The picture discovered to the Earl of Landaff that Dorcas was the mother and
Lydia the sister of the woman who had caused such anxious emotions in his
uncle's bosom, but how Lydia and Marian should be the daughters of Major Renfew
appeared to him an inexplicable riddle. His uncle soon unravelled the mystery,
and received some consolation from hearing that Dorcas was living, and that he
might hope to embrace one innocent child, in his Lydia.

He determined to seek Dorcas in her solitude, and acknowledge her to the world
as his first and only true affianced wife; but fearing to alarm her by too
abrupt an appearance, he addressed her first by letter.

TO DORCAS.
BY what title shall I address you, dear injured excellence, but by that which
must make me appear what I really am -- the vilest, the basest of mankind. --

Oh! Dorcas, cruel as my conduct was to you, my punishment, I trust, has been
equal to my fault -- alas! the crimes of the father have been visited upon the
child. Oh! my beloved, will not your gentle heart break when I shall tell you I
have seen our dear Marian -- I have seen her a wretched nightly wanderer -- I
heard her implore charity, I saw her overpowered with anguish of heart, and
relieved her not, but drove her from me, drove her again upon the merciless
world, exposed to all the miseries of want! -- But my old tough heart will not
burst, though it swells and throbs at the remembrance of that dreadful evening.

My Dorcas, I will do you justice, I will declare to the world your injuries
and my own perfidy. Prepare my love, to meet your penitent Renfew soon after
the receipt of this, and bid my sweet, my innocent Lydia, prepare to receive a
father's blessing.

Adieu. Many days shall not pass ever I hope to hear you pronounce my pardon,
and clasp you to the heart of your repentant husband,

RENFEW.


From the day of Marian's elopement pleasure had been a stranger to the heart
of Dorcas, nor could all the duteous tenderness of Lydia dissipate the anxiety
she felt for the fate of Marian from her maternal breast. Nor did joy now
sparkle in the eye of Lydia, the tear of sorrow had quenched their luster, and
like a cankerworm had fed upon her cheek, and stole from thence the blushing
rose. Full often she wept her hapless sister's fall, full often she sighed and
wished to hear again of Landaff, but her tears fell only on her pillow, when
the sable curtain of night hid them from the prying eye of maternal affection,
and her sighs stole forth when no one was nigh to hear them.

MARIAN AND LYDIA. PART VI.
'TWAS night, a cheerful fire illumined their little cottage, but sorrow still
sat heavy on the heart of Dorcas -- the wind blew, the cold rain beat against
the casement; and where now is my poor Marian? said she, sighing deeply.

I will sing you your favorite hymn, said Lydia, kissing off a tear as it fell
on her mother's cheek, and struggling to suppress its sympathising sister that
trembled in her own eye.

She took up her guitar, she wished to divert her mother's attention from the
painful reflections which then occupied her thoughts; she passed her fingers
across the strings, the tones were discordant, it is not in tune, said she.
Alas! my dear Lydia, replied her mother, it is our minds that are not
harmonized. She understood the meaning of her mother's words, but, making no
answer, began to sing an evening hymn of thanks. The sudden trampling of a
horse interrupted her, a loud rapping at the door alarmed them -- Lydia opened
the door, a servant entered. Dorcas looked earnestly at him; he threw aside his
riding coat, she knew the livery, and instantly recognized an old and favorite
servant of Major Renfew.

Simon, said she, turning pale and rising as she spoke, why are you here?

My dear honored lady, I come from my master, who repents his injurious
treatment of you, and comes to do you justice; but let this letter speak for
him.

And where is Lady Laura, said Dorcas, taking the letter.

She left my master some years since, and now leads a life of shame.

Poor misguided Laura, said Dorcas, as she broke the seal.

When she read the first lines joy lightened up her features, and a transient
glow of pleasure passed across her face; but as she proceeded her hands
trembled, her countenance assumed a deadly hue, and large drops of unutterable
anguish, chased each other down her cheeks -- the letter fell to the ground,
she clasped her hands and raised her eyes toward heaven.

Omnipotent power, said she, teach me to receive these tidings as I ought, thy
mercies and thy judgments go hand in hand. Oh! make me thankful for the one and
submissive to the other. Thou have mingled thy judgments and thy bounties in my
cup of life; lest while receiving only benefits I should forget the source from
whence those mercies flow. Lydia, continued she, you will receive a father's
blessing, but my poor Marian is lost for ever.

Two days after Major Renfew had dispatched the letter to Dorcas, he set
forward for Wales, accompanied by the Earl of Landaff; it was nearly the close
of the third day, they had arrived within a few miles of the cottage, and had
slackened their pace, that a servant might have time to inform Dorcas of their
near approach. The Major's bosom was agitated by the most painful sensations,
the Earl was animated by hope. The road was solitary, skirted on one side by a
thick wood, from whence they several times imagined they heard a voice of
complaint, the Major stopped his horse and stood in the attitude of listening.

Ah! woe is me, said the voice, I can get no farther, I must even perish here.

Landaff dismounted instantly and rushed into the wood, the Major would have
followed but a sudden pang seized him, he respired with difficulty and was
forced to support himself again a tree. In a few moments Landaff returned, a
female rested on his arm, her emaciated frame but slenderly sheltered from the
inclemencies of the weather, by a tattered gown; her hair loose and
dishevelled, her feet bare and bleeding from wounds she had received from sharp
stones, as she walked. Here is a sight of misery, said the Earl.

The Major looked at the unhappy girl, and through the shade which extreme
want, sickness, and even disordered reason had cast over her countenance,
instantly discovered the features of Marian.

Merciful heaven, he exclaimed, it is my child.

Have you a child, said Marian, catching at his last words, then for pity's
sake don't forsake her. I had a father once, I had a lover too, but you see how
it is with me now, I am poor, very wretched, and I sometimes think not quite in
my right senses. I have a mother who lives somewhere here about, I have
traveled a long way in hopes to find her, but I know not how it is, I have eat
so little, and wept so much, I was obliged to sit down and rest. Do but see how
my poor feet bleed.

Oh! my dear child, cried the Major, you make my heart bleed drop for drop with
them; but I am going to your mother's, and will show you the way.

You are a man, said she, and I dare not trust you; they are all hard-hearted,
cruel and treacherous. I once, continued she; looking earnestly in the Major's
face, I once met a man, but it is a long time since, who looked and spoke as you
do, only not quite so sorrowful -- I was miserable then, and he promised to be
my friend, but he did not mean it; he used me very cruelly, I hardly know how I
got from him, and have been wandering about ever since, sometimes one cold
stone, sometimes another has been my pillow. I bear it as well as I can, we all
must suffer according to our offenses.

Dear lunatic, said the Major, what a lesson do thou teach thy father.

That is true, said she, you have a child, if it is a daughter, bring her to
me, and I will teach her such a lesson -- I have it here (laying her hand on
her heart) it can never be erased but by the hand of death. Oh! I would tell
her such tales of men, would teach her to beware their flattery, to shut
herself in retirement, to pray for humility. Oh! fie upon it, fie upon it, it is
a bad world, but I Will to my mother, for I am sick, heart-sick of its follies.

She then darted precipitately into the wood, but had not proceeded many steps,
when overcome with fatigue, long fasting, and the agitation of her disordered
spirits, she sunk under the complicated evils, and fell fainting to the ground.

Renfew was too much absorbed in his own feelings to be able to give any orders
concerning his unhappy daughter, and could only exclaim, "These are thy works,
oh vice; look, old Renfew, behold the ruin of thy child, and remember it is the
reward of thy own ingratitude, perfidy and cruelty."

Landaff assisted the servants in raising Marian, and being then but a short
distance from the cottage, persuaded his uncle to ride forward, accompanied by
one servant, while he followed with the other two supporting Marian between
them. And is this the peace offering I shall carry to my afflicted Dorcas, a
daughter murdered by the inhumanity of a father, said the Major as he proceeded.

Dorcas had been listening to every passing breeze, and counting the minutes,
chiding their tardy progress. The sound of horses feet caught her ear, she met
her repentant Renfew at the door, threw herself into his arms, and fainted.
Lydia knelt and received a father's blessing.

Words are too languid to describe the ensuing scene, suffice it to say, for
Marian was for a moment forgot, for a moment they were all happy; but they were
awakened from this dream of bliss by the approach of Landaff.

Lydia started as she drew near the door, Renfew struck his forehead with his
hand, and bursting from the embraces of Dorcas, rushed out of the room.

Marian was beginning to recover her senses as they entered the cottage. Lydia
thought it was a stranger, poor and sickly, and as she lent her arm to assist
in leading her in, a tear fell in compassion to her weakness and apparent
misery. Marian sunk into a chair, folded her arms round Lydia's waist, and
gazing at her for a moment, recollection and reason at once returned, she
dropped her head on her bosom and cried, it is indeed my sister.

The voice was familiar to Dorcas. That voice should be the voice of Marian,
said she, but alas! the form retains no traces of my once lovely innocent child.

Innocence and peace are fled together, said Marian, grant me but pardon and
let me die at your feet; she sunk upon her knees, Lydia knelt beside her; the
afflicted mother wept over her, blessed and forgave her.

Enough, said Marian, this was the only prayer I dared to offer at the throne
of grace since I left my home, and became acquainted with guilt and misery; how
it has pleased heaven to direct me to you I know not. I have some faint
recollection of an horrid dream, but all things seem fading from my memory, an
icy chillness hangs about my heart, I feel the springs of life are quite
exhausted.

Oh! spare her, spare my child, merciful heaven, cried Dorcas, sinking on her
knees.

It cannot be, said the expiring sufferer, I die, but a mother's blessing
softens even the agonies of death, Oh! had I but deserved it.

She raised her hands and eyes in a fervent though inarticulate ejaculation to
heaven, and uttering a piercing groan expired.

Renfew heard the groan, he heard the cries of Dorcas and Lydia -- "And is she
dead, said he, rushing in and catching the pale corse in his arms, Oh! Marian!
Marian! why should thou pay the forfeit of thy father's crimes? But tell me,
continued he, who was her seducer; who plunged my child into this abyss of
misery; teach me where to find him, that with his heart's blood I may wash out
the stain he has entailed upon the name of Renfew."

Forbear, said Dorcas, laying her hand upon his arm, while a beam of mingled
piety and fortitude illumined her countenance, forbear, the hand of heaven is
in it, accept its just chastisements with humility, and remembering only thine
own offenses, blot from thy memory the offenses of others.

Renfew turned from her, folded his arms upon his bosom, and was silent.

A few days after the ill-fated Marian was committed to her parent earth, when
Renfew, Dorcas, and Lydia removed to the seat of the Earl of Landaff, where in
a short time she reaped the full reward of her filial duty and unremitting
tenderness to her mother, by becoming the bride of that young nobleman. She was
the blessing of her parents, the pride and honor of her husband, the friend and
preceptress of her children, who repaid an hundred fold the pleasure she had
conveyed to Dorcas's bosom by showing the same duty and affection to her.

Major Renfew purchased the cottage where his wife and children had lived so
many years, and kept it in constant repair; in the garden he had two small
temples erected, one was almost hid from the eye, by thick spreading cypress
and yew trees, round whose branches twined the deadly nightshade, and baleful
ivy; within was a tomb of black marble, over which stood Humanity weeping; on
the front of the monument was the following inscription:

Hither let the Daughter of Vanity repair, Look on this silent Monitor, AND
REMEMBER MARIAN!

She was fair and sweet as the lily, innocent as the young lamb, but folly
misled her, vice betrayed her, and misery closed the final awful scene, in the
Twenty-Third Year of her Age.

Beware the voice of flattery, beware the allurements of wealth, nor ask of thy
bountiful Creator aught but HUMILITY, VIRTUE AND CONTENT.

The other temple was built of white marble, surrounded by the most beautiful
flowering shrubs and evergreens; within was Peace and Prosperity, showering
their favors on filial piety; above hovered an Angel with a crown of gold in
her hands, round which was this heavenly promise: Honor thy Parents, and thy
Days shall be long in the Land.


May this promise ever be present to the remembrance of the fair daughters of
Britain!

LETTER VI. MENTORIA TO THE MISS WINWORTHS.
STILL am I to complain of the shortness of your letters, and receive the
trifling excuse, that you have no time. Fie, my dear girls, I am ashamed to
read so very childish an apology, your want of time must proceed from your own
bad management, for surely no rational being will give more to the pursuit of
amusement than what might just serve to give a zest to retirement; and, believe
me, you will find retirement alone the source of true happiness, and promoter
of industry -- and on the contrary, an eager pursuit of fashionable folly,
which seduces you under the semblance of pleasure, always tends to debilitate
the faculties of the mind, and lead you into habits of idleness and indolence
at once prejudicial to your tranquillity and interest, not only your temporal,
but what is of far more consequence, your spiritual interest.

If, my beloved pupils, you cannot find time once in several weeks to write a
few lines to a friend, who regards you with a tenderness nearly maternal; tell
me, and tell me truly, I entreat, how much time you can spare to devote each
day to the Creator and giver of all good? Ah! my young friends, I fear but a
little, very little portion is allotted for that service; yet trust me it is a
service which cannot be neglected but by the ungrateful and unthinking. Is
there one moment of your lives that passes unmarked by his blessings? Have you
not health, cheerfulness, friends, and the most valuable of all blessings, the
power to dry the tear of affliction, to comfort the widow, protect the orphan,
release the poor debtor, and perform all the good works of peace and mercy?

How should your hearts overflow with gratitude to that God, who thus
bountifully spreads around you the means of happiness, do not then my dear
children, throw the blessing from you, and continue squandering your time, and
trifling with your health 'till the first is nearly spent, and the latter
irretrievably ruined, and you will awaken too late to a just sense of your
error, when your mind, evervated by the weakness of your frame, vainly shall
endeavor in the few remaining years to regain those sources of mental delight
which ever slow from a proper exertion of the reasoning faculties.

When you were with me, was there ever a day too long? I hear you readily
answer no. Every moment was fully and pleasantly employed; true, but had we not
always time for reading, writing, music, drawing, needle work, and every other
amusing or useful employment. And did we ever, my dear girls, rise from the
sweets of repose, or retire to our chambers at night, without remembering our
duty to him through whose mercy alone we enjoyed all those blessings? and
certain I am, you were at that time as happy as it was possible for young
people to be; you were blithe as the woodlark, blooming as Hebe, and innocent
as the dove, who tries his new fledged wings in little circles round its
mother's nest.

Think not, my young friends, that I wish to deprive you of innocent amusement,
far from it. In the sphere where it has pleased providence to place you, it is
certainly right that you should partake in moderation of all the diversions of
the metropolis; but if those diversions are too frequently repeated, they lose
their effect, and you return from them weary, disgusted and dissatisfied.

But how different are the pleasures arising from the amusement to be found
within ourselves. The pursuit of either of the fine arts, the study of nature,
in all her varieties and beauties, the excellencies of christianity, the
delights arising from benevolence -- here are inexhaustible sources of
entertainment, rational sublime pleasure, that the farther you pursue it, the
more enchanting appears the prospect, new charms arise to your astonished view;
and though the joys of youth transiently fleet away, you will still have
pleasures within your reach, that can render old age not only easy to yourself,
but delightful to others.

I am no stranger to the many enticements youth and inexperience meet with in
the gay world to allure them from the paths of reason. I myself spent my youth
in London, but it was my lot to be placed in a family, where nothing was deemed
pleasure, however specious its appearance, that was not sanctioned by reason.

Your grandmother, my dear girls, was a woman remarkable for the elogance of
her manners and the cheerfulness of her disposition; yet believe me she was as
truly pious as a primitive christian. Surrounded with affluence, she was
humble, benevolent, tender hearted, and easy of access to the meanest
petitioner. In affliction resigned, patient and uncomplaining.

When it was first my happy fate to be taken under her protection, she was
scarcely twenty-six years old, extremely lovely in her person, endowed with
every accomplishment, admired wherever she appeared, respected by her friends,
and adored by her husband: yet she was not tainted by vanity, but made it her
study to conciliate esteem, when love and admiration should be no more. She
paid a strict attention to her domestic affairs, attended personally to the
morals and education of her children, never suffered an hour to pass
unemployed, or a day without paying her devotion to her maker.

This is an example I could wish you to follow, as it cannot sail of making you
as truly happy, as it is possible for human nature to be.

MENTORIA.

LETTER VII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.
AND so you really feel yourselves mightily offended because your father thinks
of a second marriage, when you should rather rejoice to find he has chosen so
amiable a woman as Mrs. Clairville.

You are to consider that it is more than probable in a few years you will all
of you be settled in a matrimonial way, and then how extremely uncomfortable
will your father find himself, after being so long accustomed to the society of
an amiable woman, to feel himself at once deprived of it, how solitary would be
his house, how pensive his breakfast hours.

But you cry, you do not like a stepmother. Can you suppose that Mrs.
Clairville will assume any improper authority over you when she becomes Lady
Winworth? --

Believe me, my children, while you behave with tenderness and propriety
toward her, she will never appear otherwise than your friend and companion.
Besides, you should reflect that your father having discharged his duty toward
you, by giving you a liberal education, and remaining unmarried till you have
attained to years of maturity, has now an undoubted right to please himself,
and choose a companion suited to his age and disposition. -- And shall you, the
children of his affection, whose happiness he has so much studied, whose
felicity is the first wish of his heart, shall you ungratefully murmur at his
choice, and by your discontent embitter the life of him it is your duty to love
and reverence.

No, no. -- I think my dear girls know too well the many obligations they are
under to this dear father, to attempt any thing which would be prejudicial to
his happiness. Consider, my dear girls, how much it will be your interest to
endeavor to conciliate the affection and esteem of the woman whom your father
thinks proper to place in so respectable a situation. You must regard her as
the representative of your deceased parent, and by tender assiduity and
attention, make her your sincere friend; such a conduct will make you dearer
than ever (...) the heart of your father, and a delightful tranquillity will
diffuse itself through your own bosoms, conscious that to the utmost of your
power you have performed your duty.

Perhaps you may tell me, there is no actual duty due to a stepmother. I
confess it is not so much a duty incumbent for you to obey the commands or
submit implicitly to the will of any but your natural parent, but remember my
fair friends, if you voluntarily perform an exalted action, where perhaps it
was not expected, and could not be demanded, how much more will it redound to
your honor, than the simple discharge of an obligation.

I am sensible that many young women have been rendered extremely unhappy by
their father's choosing second wives, but then it has been the error of
judgment in his choice; where passion has so blinded him that he could not
discover the faults of the person who had attracted his affection. Perhaps she
has been ignorant, ill-natured, illiberal, or fantastic; nay, it has been the
unhappy fate of some girls to have for a stepmother, a person in whom all
those disagreeable circumstances are combined. But what a different choice has
your father made, Mrs. Clairville is elegant, accomplished, gentle and
unassuming. She will render your father's evening of life like the parting rays
of a mild autumn day, where though we cannot but see the visible approach of
winter, there is such a soft serenity, such various beauties scattered over the
prospect, that the reflecting mind cannot but prefer it to the more gaudy tints
that embellish the appearance of spring.

Your own felicity too may be augmented by this union, as I am certain, however
vanity or folly may for a moment mislead your understanding, you will all
sincerely rejoice in an event that will ultimately tend to insure the most
refined pleasure to so good, so valuable a father, as Lord Winworth, by uniting
him to a woman, whose highly cultivated understanding renders her at once the
cheerful rational companion, and the disinterested friend.

You may remember, my dear girls, how unkind you thought me, when I positively
refused to accompany you to London; perhaps you may now perceive the justice of
that refusal. Had I complied with the polite invitation of your father, and
yielded my own better judgment to your pressing entreaties, I should have
undoubtedly long ago forfeited, in your opinion, all right to your affection.

Some years before Lord Winworth beheld your truly amiable mother, he so far
humbled himself as to make me a tender of his hand and fortune. I will not
dwell on the reason that urged me to refuse an offer so very far above my
deserts, least my dear Miss Winworths should think I boasted of my great
fortitude and resolution; believe me, it was only an exertion of reason, and I
felt amply compensated for all I suffered in this self-denial, (for I will not
deny that my heart pleaded strongly in your father's favor) by the reflection
that I had acted with honor and propriety, and evinced the sincerity of my
gratitude to my dear benefactress.

Affections that have been deeply impressed on our hearts in extreme youth, are
often revived again at the remote period of mature age, and I feared to lose
the friendship of my young friends, by awakening in the bosom of their father
the tenderness he once honored me with, by professing --.

Before I drop this subject, I will give you two instances that have fell under
my own immediate knowledge, to show you how very possible it is for an
obstinate misjudging child to trifle away both her own and father's happiness,
by being wilfully blind to the merits of his second wife; and also show how
truly amiable the daughter must appear, who makes the tranquillity of her
parent her chief study; and if her own peace is in some measure interrupted by
the caprice of a step mother, she will seek in resignation, piety and humility,
a sweet consolation and comfort.

Celia Markham had the misfortune to lose her mother at the early age of
twelve. Mr. Markham was doatingly fond of his daughter, he placed his chief
felicity in the hope of one day seeing her the most amiable, accomplished and
happy girl in England.

He had placed her at an eminent boarding school, but he knew too much of the
world to suppose, a girl of her volatile disposition, especially when she was
lovely in her person, and reputed heiress to a large fortune, could be so safe
any where as under the immediate protection of a father. He had no female
relation whom he could with propriety invite to his house, and he thought he
could not do his daughter a more acceptable service, than by choosing the
amiable Miss Nelson to preside in the place of her departed mother.

Miss Nelson was at that time upwards of thirty, she had rendered herself
universally beloved and respected by all who knew her, for the innate goodness
of her heart was conspicuous in every action. She had received a most liberal
education, and her mental endowments were far superior to the generality of
what is termed accomplished women -- yet so timid and unassuming in her
manners, that those with whom she conversed by degrees discovered her
excellencies, and after some years acquaintance would be daily finding
something new to admire. She had by the most exemplary conduct as a daughter,
convinced the world what might be expected from her as a wife and mother. She
was uniformly humane, pious and gentle; in person attractive, and in manners
elegantly simple.

Such was the woman whom Mr. Markham thought would help to form the manners,
cultivate the understanding, and direct the studies of his darling Celia.

Miss Markham no sooner was informed of her father's intended union, than she
conceived the most violent and ill founded dislike toward the innocent object
of his affection.

As Celia was so young, Mr. Markham never had an idea of consulting her on his
proposed marriage, having therefore obtained from Miss Nelson leave to name an
early day for the ceremony, he wrote to his daughter an affectionate letter,
informing her how much he had studied her happiness in providing her so amiable
a friend and preceptress, at the same time requesting her governess to prepare
her to be present at the wedding.

Celia was a girl of high spirits, her understanding had remained entirely
uncultivated, while large sums had been expended on the far less necessary
superficial accomplishments of music, dancing, drawing, and fancy works.
Religion she knew but by name; it is true, there were prayers read twice a day
in the school, and she went with the other ladies regularly to church twice
every Sunday, but there it rested. There had been no pains taken to instill into
her mind a true knowledge of what religion meant; she had not been taught that
to keep her passions under the control of reason, to submit, without repining,
to the will of those whom heaven had placed over her; to be meek, merciful, and
just, and let every action of her life be a continued work of gratitude to
heaven, and good will to her fellow creatures, was to follow the precepts of
true piety.

She had been early taught to value herself, upon the trifling advantages of
birth and fortune, for she saw the visible difference between the attention and
respect paid by her governess and the teachers to herself and those young
ladies who had neither of those advantages to recommend them.

She was naturally vain, and that vanity was augmented by the constant
adulation which she daily received from those girls, whose (...) of spirit
induced them to cringe to her superior wealth.

From constantly contemplating those fancied endowments, she began to imagine
she was born for universal sway, had settled it in her own mind, that in a few
years she should be called home to preside at her father's table, have the
management of the family, and partake of all the fashionable pleasures with
which the metropolis abounds.

How great then was her disappointment when she found all these pleasing
expectations at once frustrated -- when she found she was to be still
considered as a child, and under the control of the most dreaded of all
characters, a stepmother. --

She knew Miss Nelson, but far from admiring her amiable qualities, she had
considered her as a dull, precise, insipid old maid. She had no idea that
cheerfulness and unaffected piety constantly inhabited the same breast, nor
could she conceive that rational conversation, study, useful employment, and
innocent amusement, could amply diversify the scene, and be a source of
tranquil happiness without the aid of public entertainments, dress, parade and
folly.

It may be easily conceived, that two tempers so diametrically opposite would
never agree.

Mr. Markham had seen these erroneous traits in his daughter's disposition, but
he flattered himself, the amiable example and condescending behavior of Miss
Nelson would so far operate on her temper, as to make her love and endeavor to
imitate her virtues.

It is impossible to describe the rage and grief that displayed itself in the
countenance of Celia, on the receipt of her father's letters, regarding only
what she foolishly imagined would be prejudicial to her own happiness. She gave
vent to her passion in the most unbecoming terms, called her father cruel,
unjust and unfeeling, and vowed she would die sooner than call Miss Nelson
mother. "I will go to the wedding, said she, because that woman shall not have
a moment's happiness of which it is in my power to deprive her."

With this laudable resolution she sat forward for her father's house, where
upon being tenderly embraced by him, instead of returning a cordial salute, and
wishing him joy, she turned her face from him and bursting into tears, (which
proceeded more from passion than sensibility) said she was sorry to find her
dear mother was so soon forgot.

Not forgot, my beloved; replied Mr. Markham, for I have sought a woman who is
her counter-part in every amiable quality.

They then proceeded to church, where, after the ceremony was performed, tears
and sullen curtseys were all the gratulations Celia offered to her new mother.

Mrs. Markham was naturally a woman of great sensibility she attributed Celia's
melancholy to a cause that did honor to her own heart, and instead of taking
offense, endeavored to soothe and entertain her during the whole day. But
alas! the gentle Mrs. Markham knew not the difficulty of the task she had
undertaken. She had known Celia some years before her mother's death, and
always thought her an amiable, lively girl, and judging of her disposition by
that of her parents, imagined there would be no difficulty in modelling her
according to her own wishes.

But these fallacious hopes were soon no more. Celia from the day of her
father's marriage took every opportunity in her power to thwart and vex her
mother-in-law.

Though Mrs. Markham was a woman of too much sense, to let the caprice of such
a girl ruffle the uncommon serenity of her temper, yet was it totally
impossible for a woman of her exquisite sensibility, to enjoy any tolerable
degree of happiness while she saw the darling child of the man she loved and
esteemed of so froward and perverse a disposition.

Celia was volatile, and thoughtless to excess, fond of company, and so
entirely unqualified to amuse or entertain herself, that the most improper
society was preferred to being alone. Her mother-in-law was of too grave and
rational a turn to afford her any pleasure by her conversation, and to read or
work required so much attention, that she termed it fatigue.

It was with infinite regret that Mr. Markham discovered the little felicity he
was like to enjoy in this second union. He saw the child of his tenderest
affection restless and discontented; he saw with anguish the many fruitless
endeavors of Mrs. Markham to reclaim and make her pursue the direct road to
happiness.

Whenever the tender attention of this amiable woman lead her to remonstrate
with Celia on the impropriety of her conduct, and the miserable waste of her
time, the petulant girl would burst into tears, and cry, "Oh! that my dear
mother was living, I should not then be treated thus cruelly, and abridged of
every innocent pleasure, by a woman, who having stolen from me my dear father's
affections, now usurps and undue authority over both him and me."

These continual disputes greatly embittered Mrs. Markham's life. -- Mr.
Markham was at a loss how to conduct himself so as to give pain to neither wife
or daughter. In short, the whole family was unhappy from the capricious
behavior of her, whose chief study should have been to promote their felicity.

Celia had her friends, her parties, and her secrets, in which Mrs. Markham was
not allowed to participate; the consequence was, that she at a very early age
had her lovers also.

Among the many candidates for her favor was a Captain Parslow, he was a man of
no fortune, ignorant, conceited, and a complete coxcomb. He soon discovered the
weakness of Celia, he flattered her foibles, took her part against her
mother-in-law, and, in short, so far won on the foolish thoughtless girl, that
she consented to elope with him, and take a trip to Scotland.

By the dropping of a letter Mrs. Markham discovered the plan; she talked to
Celia in the accents of friendship and send solicitude but received in return,
only impertinence and disrespect.

Mrs. Markham thought it her duty to acquaint her husband with the discovery
she had made. Grieved to the soul, he sent for his daughter, and in the most
pathetic terms entreated her to desist from so fatal a step.

The artful Celia thought this was the time to alienate her father's affections
from his wife -- she positively denied the whole charge, and declared she
believed it must be a contrivance of Mrs. Markham';; begged if her dear father
thought her capable of such imprudence, he would send her abroad, and shut her
in a convent. "I know, continued she, with well dissembled tears, that you have
been taught to consider your poor girl as an abandoned wretch, who consulted
only her own happiness, but indeed, indeed my beloved father, you have been
deceived. I am not the guilty creature you think me. But, alas! I have long
seen my presence is a bar to your happiness, send me from you, then, dear Sir;
since it is impossible we can both enjoy content, let me be the victim, and may
your felicity be unbounded."

This artful speech had the desired effect, and Mr. Markham believing his
daughter perfectly innocent, began to treat the woman with coolness whom he
imagined had attempted to create dissension between him and his only child.

Celia saw she had now completely made her mother-in-law unhappy, and exulted
in her cruelty, adding insult to the already poignant sufferings of the patient
and amiable Mrs. Markham.

But Celia had not sufficient art to elude or evade the solicitude of her
admirer. Parslow still continued his devoirs, and Miss Markham listened to his
flattery and received his assiduities with too much pleasure to give any room
for despair; in a short time she eloped. Her father was amazed, and how much
was his astonishment increased when the following letter was put into his hand.

DEAR AND HONORED SIR,
THOUGH the step I have taken will. I am certain, by the generality of mankind,
be called an improper one, my own heart acquits me of any motive but a wish to
insure your happiness.

I have long seen, with sincere anguish of heart, how much my presence
militated against your tranquillity. I am convinced, my dear father, Mrs.
Markham is now the only object of your affection; your once tenderly beloved
child has only a secondary place in your heart.

Pardon me, my revered parent, if I say, this was too evident not to be
discovered, and when once, discovered, too painful to be borne in silence.

The contempt which Mrs. Markham's unjust suspicions subject me to, not only
from our acquaintance, but even our servants, has urged me to make choice of a
protector for my fame and honor, nor do I scruple to add, a protector from her
undeserved malice and continual ill nature.

Adieu, my dear father, may you be as happy as I wish you; forgive and think
with compassion on your child,

CELIA MARKHAM.


The feelings of a father on the receipt of such a letter are more easily
conceived than described. He had long considered his innocent wife as a person
who bad disturbed the peace of his family, and now that he imagined himself
convinced of her unjust conduct toward his daughter, his displeasure knew no
bounds; rage, invective, and bitter reproach, were all the gentle, meek,
uncomplaining sufferer received from a husband who once fondly esteemed her.
But though Mrs. Markham complained not the distress of her mind preyed upon her
delicate frame, she sank under this unexpected misfortune, and a rapid decline
in a few months put a period to her existence.

In the mean time Celia and her husband had been received and forgiven by Mr.
Markham; but, alas! that too indulgent father soon discovered, that in the loss
of his wife, he had been bereft of every earthly comfort; his daughter rather
triumphed in, than endeavored to soothe his melancholy -- she threw out the
most illiberal censures on the memory of the deceased Mrs. Markham, and having
no longer any particular end to attain by pretending violent affection to her
father, she at first began to flight and at length totally neglected him.

He felt, acutely felt, her unkindness, but still his affection led him to
lavish immense sums to support the extravagance of herself and husband 'till
unable any longer to keep them from ruin, he gave up all but about one hundred
pounds a year, with which he retired into the country, and ended his days in
what he called peaceful obscurity.

And to the last his prayers were offered at the throne of grace for his
ungrateful child -- but alas! Celia, by her own conduct counteracted the
effects of those pious prayers. Neglected, nay despised, by her husband, she
launched into every species of dissipation, and was in a few years reduced to a
state of absolute penury, where remorse is not the least painful of her many
heavy afflictions, all which she has brought on herself by an illiberal
obstinate conduct; for had she rightly considered the virtues and amiable
deportment of Mrs. Markham, she might have contributed to the felicity of her
father, and, in the end, ultimately insured her own.

How different was the behavior of Serena -- But as my letter is already of a
considerable length, I shall reserve her story 'till the next post.

Adieu, my beloved pupils, once more believe me, to be completely happy
yourselves, you must study the happiness of all with whom you are connected;
for there is more real pleasure flows from the reflection of having promoted
the welfare and tranquillity of a fellow creature, than can proceed from the
highest self gratifications the world can afford. The one is like a transient
vapor that for a moment illumines the sky, passes and is forgotten; but the
other, like the glorious sun, glads the whole face of nature, by its enlivening
beams, through the day, and even lends its rays to the silver moon, to cheer
the horrors of approaching night. So does the remembrance of good actions gild
the day of life, and cheer the heavy night of approaching death.

God bless you, my dear girls, believe my friendship sincere and unchangeable,
while life's warm fluid animates the heart of

MENTORIA.

LETTER VIII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.
I HAVE taken up my pen, without farther preface to proceed on my promised
story, and shall leave my dear Miss Winworths to apply the moral themselves;
sensible that they do not went sense to discover right from wrong, and
sincerely hoping they will not let folly, vanity, or illiberal prejudices
mislead their judgment.

Mr. Osborne was left a widower at a very early age, with only one daughter,
named Serena, who, when she had the misfortune to lose her mother, was scarcely
three years old. She inherited by the death of her mother, a genteel
independence, and was reputed heiress to her father's fortune, which was not
inconsiderable.

Not long after this melancholy event Mr. Osbore, being on a visit to a friend
in the country, became acquainted with Miss Withers.

She was, it must be confessed, beautiful in the extreme, but that
acknowledged, and there was not another favorable circumstance to be mentioned
in her behalf. She was the daughter of a man who enjoyed in a country town, a
considerable and lucrative post under government; his wife had brought him four
or five thousand pounds, which had been accumulated by her father, who regarded
not the cries of the fatherless, or the tears of the widow.

This woman's education had been such as might be expected for the child of a
poor petty-fogging lawyer, who by dint of chicanery and dirty employment, was
scraping a little sordid dross together, and thought by leaving her a fortune,
he left her every necessary recommendation to secure her advancement in life;
the consequence was, that to the most illiberal contracted ideas and consummate
ignorance, she added the pride and self conceit of a first-rate woman of
fashion; she was extravagantly fond of dress, parade, and show; but had no idea
of any difference being necessary between the education of a gentlewoman, and
that of a tradesman's or farmer's daughter.

Brought up under such a mother, with such confined notions, Miss Withers had
been taught to believe that the good housewife and accomplished woman, were one
and the same thing. She perfectly understood the art of cookery, pickling
preserving, and all the long etc's. necessary to form a complete housekeeper.

She could work tent-stitch, tambour, and crossstitch, make all her father's,
and indeed, all the family linen, knew the cheapest ways of going to market,
how to scold and keep her servants in order; in short, had been brought up as a
complete Mrs. Notable.

But to the fine arts she was a perfect stranger. Music, dancing, or drawing,
had no charms for her, nor had she the least idea of the pleasures resulting
from a well informed, elegantly cultivated mind. Haughty, yet mean; ignorant,
yet obstinate in her opinion, however absurd, and deaf to the voice of
conviction.

She had been educated in the strictest principles of methodism, yet was she of
no fixed religion, having been wearied in her youth by being too rigidly
obliged to conform to her parents manners; she contracted a dislike to her
religious duties, and at the time Mr. Osborne first saw her, was of no
particular sect whatever.

She had, by the death of her mother, who had been extremely anxious to make
her dear Jemima a fortune, just come to the possession of ten thousand pounds,
and was so insinuating in her manner, that she was universally well received in
all companies, and called one of the best kind of girls in the world.

Mr. Osborne was captivated with her lovely person and specious manners, and
having made proposals to her guardians, was accepted, and the lady, in due
time, became Mrs. Osborne.

She had from the first of her acquaintance pretended a violent attachment to
the little Serena, I say pretended, because I have been since convinced she
regarded her with an eye of envy and ill nature from the moment she became her
mother-in-law.

In about twelve months Mrs. Osborne presented her husband with a little girl,
and solemnly declared, at the time of her birth, it was impossible for her to
love any child better than she did Serena; and that it should be her chief
study to make no difference between the children.

This was a declaration I, who was present, was by no means pleased with, as I
knew it was not in nature for a woman to love another child so well as her own
offspring -- and though a strong sense of duty, and a naturally compassionate
heart, might lead a woman to treat with the utmost tenderness, a girl, deprived
of her natural parent, and thrown, as it were, on her protection; yet it was
impossible but inclination must lead her to give the preference to her own
child.

As Serena and Jemima (the name of her little half-sister) grew up, light and
shade could not be more opposite than their dispositions. Serena was sensible,
volatile, and cheerful, of a bright genius, fond of the pursuit of knowledge,
yet meek, mild and innocent as it was possible for a human being to be.

Jemima was sullen, proud, obstinate, and so stupid, that it was not in the
power of any masters whatever to cultivate a mind rendered impenetrable by
nature.

The excellencies which discovered themselves in the mind and disposition of
Serena were so many faults in the eyes of Mrs. Osborne, nor did she fail to
aggravate every error to which her volatility, or thoughtless innocence might
betray her, into crimes, so that by degrees her father's affection became
alienated from her, and it was almost impossible for the poor girl to speak,
move, or look so as not to give offense. As she advanced toward womanhood, her
troubles increased -- her high sense of her religious duties was termed
hypocrisy -- her strong sensibility, art; and her fine taste, and brilliant
genius, follies, which would in the end lead her to ruin.

When she had attained the age of sixteen, the bequest of a large fortune
obliged her father to visit Jamaica; he resolved to take his family with him,
and had not been there long before Mrs. Osborne was seized with one of those
fevers incident to the climate.

Tenderly and with the utmost care did Serena watch over her for many months
when the disorder had left her in a weak emaciated state, did she never quit
her bedside, administering every medicine, nor ever taking rest except what
she procured at intervals on a mattress in the same apartment. And what was the
return she received? Pettishness discontent, and repining. Frequently did Mrs.
Osborne ask, if she was brought to that strange place to be murdered -- if it
was intended she should be poisoned -- and whether Serena did not know that the
doctor designed to kill her; and these expressions were not the effect of
delirium, but spoken with a coolness and asperity that tore the heart of the
mild affectionate girl to whom they were addressed.

Mrs. Osborne at length recovered, when it pleased heaven to take her husband
from her, and she was left involved in a disagreeable law suit, which was
finally terminated to her disadvantage, she was cast with costs of suit, and
returned to England with little more than five hundred pounds remaining.

Now it was that Serena showed herself to be the amiable girl I had ever
thought her.

When she received her fortune, she settled an handsome annuity on Mrs.
Osborne, and divided the residue between Jemima and herself; though at her
father's death she had been, by their arts, deprived of any advantage from his
fortune, the whole being by will left to Mrs. Osborne and her daughter, but
providence had ordained that they were not to enjoy it.

To the last hour that she remained with her mother-in-law, she studied her
happiness only, though I have been informed it was seldom indeed that she
received even the smallest token of approbation. Her society was circumscribed,
her amusements abridged, her most innocent actions censured, and the gaiety of
her heart construed into levity, and reprimanded at vice; nay, after the
alteration in their circumstances, she was suffered to perform the most menial
offices: in short, my dear girls, her education had been confined, her genius
cramped, and had she not been a girl of an uncommon good heart, her disposition
must have been totally perverted by the constant restraint she lived under and
the severity with which she was treated; while Jemima was indulged in idleness,
her fault glossed over, and her perverse haughty disposition called laudable
pride. Yet did I never hear that Serena ever used an unbecoming expression to
her mother, or made any complaint of unkindness.

She has been now for some years married to a deserving man, and still
continues to treat Mrs. Osborne with the highest respect, and her daughter with
affection, though the ingratitude of Jemima often appears, by her unkind
neglect of a sister who sacrificed her own interest to the interest and
happiness of her mother.

Serena, though happy in her matrimonial connection, is not in affluent
circumstances.

Jemima is lately married to a man of large fortune, and removed to a distant
part of England, where, she can seldom find time to write to her sister, and
when she does so far condescend, it is with such apparent carelessness,
coldness, and distance, that the warm heart of Serena is chilled by the perusal
of her letters; yet will I venture to affirm Serena the happier woman of the
two.

I happened to mention one day the unmerited treatment she had received, not
only from them, but from her other relations; and mark, my dear girls, the
answer I received.

"Were I to say their unkindness did not give me pain, I should be guilty of
falsehood, because I have that warm affection in my heart, which expands it
with brotherly love toward all my fellow creatures, and never yet breathed a
wish to the disadvantage of a single individual. I mourn their afflictions, and
rejoice in their prosperity. I am therefore, conscious of not deserving their
unkindness, and wrapped in the integrity of my own heart, from my soul pity the
bosom that can harbor malice or ill will toward any one."

Thus, my dear Miss Winworths, you see how much our own happiness depends on
our strenuously cultivating such philanthropy of temper as may lead us to
regard ourselves but as secondary objects; the felicity we promote for others
will return with double force to our own bosoms, and conscious of having always
regarded our fellow creatures as ourselves, we can look up with confidence to
that good providence who will never forsake the children of obedience.

Adieu! Your friend in sincerity, MENTORIA.

N. B. Soon after this last letter Lord Winworth was married to Mrs.
Clairville, and the young ladies conducting themselves according to the advice
of their amiable friend, Mentoria, found in the newmade Lady Winworth, every
engaging quality that could be desired, to form the polite agreeable companion,
the affectionate parent, and sincere friend. The correspondence between
Mentoria and her pupils was continued for many years, but as the publication of
the whole would render this work too extensive, besides occasion unnecessary
repetitions. I have selected only two more letters, with which I shall close
the present collection; one addressed to Miss Gertrude, on her marriage, and a
second to the same lady, on the birth of a daughter, written by her venerable
friend, when she was in the last stage of a decline, and hastily verging
toward her place of rest, to which she humbly looked forward with that sweet
confidence and heavenly hope which ever elevates the soul of a departing
Christian.

LETTER IX. MENTORIA TO MISS G. WINWORTH.
I ADDRESS myself singly to you, my dear Gertrude, because the delicacy of your
present situation demands my serious attention, and calls up all my tenderness.

I am inexpressibly pleased to find you have made choice of so worthy a man as
Sir Arthur Fitzgerald, and that your father approves the object of your
selection

I think you have acted like a woman of sense and prudence, and I make no doubt
but you will preserve the same propriety of conduct when a wife, as has
evidently characterised you while single.

I admire that real delicacy which impelled you to give an immediate dismission
to all those pretenders who solicited your hand without being able to influence
your heart in their favor. There cannot be a more despicable passion than that
insatiable thirst for admiration, which leads a woman to encourage
indiscriminately the forward advances of every coxcomb, who shall pay them the
incense of flattery, and be continually spreading their lures to attract
adulation, however in their hearts they may despise the person who offers it.

I am sensible, my dear Gertrude will pardon me, if anxious for her future
happiness, I venture to give her my advice and opinion for the preservation of
her felicity in the married state; it has often been remarked, that a heart is
much easier gained than kept, and, believe me, it is a very judicious
observation.

There requires more care, attention, and solicitude, from the wife to the
husband, than from the mistress to her adoring lover. The lover being but
seldom with you, sees you only in part, it is natural to suppose you would
neither appear before him in a slatternly dress, or with a peevish aspect. Your
clothes will be always put on with neatness, and your face dressed in smiles.
On the contrary, the husband being always in your company, has an opportunity
of discovering every little defect or blemish in your person, manners, or
disposition, and the chief study of a wife should be to guard against every
thing that might create distaste, or excite disgust.

And in the first place let me recommend a most scrupulous regard to delicacy
and neatness.

Many young women foolishly imagine, as soon as they are married, they have a
right to understand and laugh at an indelicate allusion, but from this fault,
the native purity of your mind will, I am certain, preserve you, since nothing
but extreme ignorance or levity could lead any woman to listen with apparent
pleasure, to an improper tale, or ill timed jest.

There are too many men, nay, even among those who call themselves gentlemen,
who will not scruple to shock a woman's ears with conversation of this kind;
but the look of marked disapprobation and silent contempt, will never fail to
silence them, unless they are either brutes or fools, and to such there is no
fear of your being exposed.

The next thing is neatness in your person and dress and an equanimity of
temper to be preserved toward your husband, and your servants; -- nothing
degrades a gentlewoman more than her suffering her temper to be so far ruffled
as to use improper language to her dependants, nor can any thing be more
disgusting to a man of sense than to see his wife give way to sudden starts of
passion.

To every relation and friend of your husband, show a polite attention and
marked preference; show him, that to be related to, or esteemed by him, is a
sufficient claim upon your regard -- whatever be his errors, confine the
knowledge of them to your own bosom, and endeavor, by the midest persuasions,
to lead him to the path of rectitude. Discretion must direct you as to the
proper season to offer your advice and opinions, since men in general are so
tenacious of their prerogative, that they start from every thing that has the
least appearance of control or opposition. Never atttempt to restrain his
pleasures; if he should be fond of company, dissipation and expensive
amusements, be it your study to detach his mind from those pursuits, by
endeavoring to render his home delightful, let your face be ever arrayed in
smiles at his approach, form a society of those he loves and esteems most,
exert your various abilities to charm and entertain him, and believe me, he who
constantly meets cheerfulness and smiles at home, will seldom wish to seek
abroad for pleasure.

Above all things never suffer any person to speak disrespectfully of him in
your presence, and guard your heart from the least approach of jealousy; should
there even be occasion for suspicion, be careful not to let him see you have
discovered his dishonorable conduct, and never suffer any one, more especially
a man, to hear you complain.

Avoid reproaches, they in general increase rather than alleviate the distress;
if patient suffering and the mild remonstrance of an afflicted uncomplaining
spirit, will not work a reformation, reproach and discontent will have no
effect.

You must not be above attending to his interest so far as may lead you to
inspect the expenses of your family; have stated and regular times for
examining your house-keeper's accounts, and being satisfied that your
trades-people are regularly paid, and do not let trifles put you aside from
this very necessary point.

Let your own expenses be regulated by prudence void of parsimony, and suffer
not a passion for finery, and a wish to eclipse your acquaintance, prompt you
to overstep your income, or deprive you of the inexpressible pleasure of
relieving indigent merit.

Though I would not have you sacrifice too largely at the shrine of that idol,
fashion, I would have you follow her so far as may make your appearance always
deserve the appellation of elegantly neat; nor must you confine this appearance
only to your going abroad or receiving company at home; though you were to be
in the country for months, and see none but your husband and servants, never
neglect the real necessary duties of the toilet, it is a respect due to him, it
shows a wish to appear agreeable in his eyes, and that you prefer his
approbation to that of all the world beside.

There is one more circumstance I must mention, although a thorough knowledge
of your disposition renders it almost unnecessary; yet I have seen so many
couples made inexpressibly miserable by it, that I cannot resist my inclination
to warn you of so dangerous a conduct.

Never permit any man, however clothed with the mask of friendship, to treat
you with familiarity. There are many freedoms, which to a girl may be perfectly
innocent, and yet become almost crimes when offered to, or received by a
married woman.

A married woman should never suffer a man to entertain her in a strain of
^^^^antry, a pressure of the hand is an affront, and an attempt at a salute
(except where the nearness of the relation authorizes such a liberty) is, and
should be resented as an insult.

There is a decent gravity of manner that will at once excite admiration and
respect, and yet exclude all improper familiarity, nor can any thing be more
ridiculous, than to see the mistress of a family, perhaps the mother of four or
five children, affecting a giddy flirting carriage, that would be hardly
excusable in a girl of sixteen -- it may, in some instances, proceed from an
innocent gaiety of heart, but it hardly ever fails of degenerating into levity
and imprudence, always lays a woman open to insult, of which she cannot
complain, because she evidently invited it; and too often ends in the total
loss of honor, happiness, and reputation. Be cheerful, condescending, and
polite to all, but let there ever be that dignity in your manner which may keep
impertinent fools, or designing villains at a proper distance.

Pardon the length of this epistle, and believe it proceeds from a friend who
loves you. Remember me affectionately to your dear sisters. -- Adieu, may every
blessing be your portion here and hereafter.

MENTORIA.

LETTER X. MENTORIA TO LADY FITZGERALD.
THE news that you were safe in bed, and mother to a daughter, my dear
Gertrude, will, believe me, give as much satisfaction to my heart, as any
sublunary pleasure possibly can; and, weak as I am, tottering as it were on the
very brink of a vast eternity, I cannot resist the desire I feel, of once more
writing to my beloved pupils, for in addressing Lady Fitzgerald, I suppose
myself also writing to her sisters.

But first a few words to yourself, in regard to this dear, this precious
little charge, with which it has pleased heaven to entrust you. May it ever be
impressed on your mind that the future happiness or misery of this child
depends greatly on the treatment she receives during her puerile years.

Let not a too great fondness prompt you, by extreme indulgence, to enervate
the faculties of her soul, or pervert her disposition, and by so doing render
her totally unfit to bear the many inconveniences and crosses she must
necessarily meet with in her passage through life.

And on the contrary, do not, by an ill-judged severity, drive her to mean
subterfuges, falsehoods and deceit, through fear of your anger. -- Many an
amiable girl has been totally ruined by such treatment; it leads them to fear
but not love their parents, it prompts them to make companions of their
servants, and often ends in the entire perversion of their principles.

Teach her to fear to disoblige you, but let it be through fear of losing your
affection, not from the apprehension of punishment. Do not be too anxious to
have your child praised for an early progress in her education; a young mind
should not be loaded, it spoils the memory, and often occasions a dislike to
study in more advanced life, besides, children accustomed to hear themselves
commended are apt to think themselves sufficiently wife and accomplished before
their education is well begun.

Do not encourage her in a love of finery, or suffer her to be told she is
handsome, they will both be very pernicious to her future tranquillity.

There is one thing which parents are very apt, not only to do themselves, but
to suffer their servants to do the same; that is, when any little master visits
at the house nearly of miss's age, she is told that he is her little husband,
and that she must hold up her head and behave like a woman, or she will never
be married,

Thus is the idea of love and lovers introduced into there little hearts, before
they are capable of understanding what the word means.

This is, to me, the most foolish conduct in the world, and nothing would
offend me so soon, as having such ridiculous things said to any child in whose
education and future prospects I was any ways concerned. Teach them the
difference between right and wrong, and convince their reason, by pointing out
the real way to promote their own happiness, and merit the regard and esteem of
their friends.

Do not introduce your girl too early into public, it will give her a taste for
dissipation: in proper time let her partake in moderation of all the amusements
of the metropolis, so as to prevent the bad effects of curiosity ungratified;
but at the same time accustom her to find resources within herself, that may,
at all times, enable her to banish that monster Ennui.

Trust not the cultivation of her mental faculties, or the forming of her moral
character, to any one but yourself; and as she advances toward womanhood make
her your friend and companion: let the distance between mother and daughter be
forgot, and by treating her with a degree of confidence that flatters her
self-consequence, encourage her to make your bosom the repository of all her
secrets, and be ready to apply to your better jugment to direct all her actions.

I am certain there would not be half the imprudencies committed by girls in
general, if they were not kept at such an awful distance by their mothers; that
fearing either ridicule or reproof, they dare not entrust them with their
little plans and disappointments, and relying either on the advice of some one
as inexperienced as themselves, or to the suggestions of their own simple
hearts, they involve themselves in troubles, which endanger their peace of mind
and ruin their reputation, but so it will ever be while mothers forget they
have ever been girls themselves, and make no allowance for the volatility of
youth, and the innocent impulses of a heart unburthened by the cares of the
world.

I have written much more than I intended, but the subject interested me, and
there is yet another which dwells still nearer my heart, that is, my beloved
Gertrude, the necessity there is of giving your child a proper sense of the
high advantages of early piety, but this must not be done by teaching her to
say long prayers, of which she cannot comprehend the meaning, or by making her
read books of dull theology.

It is example, my dear friend, must teach her the true principles of the
Christian Religion; let her see you in the act of devotion, let her curiosity
be awakened, and then, as you answer her questions lead her by degrees to love,
worship and adore the Almighty giver of all good; convince her of her
dependence on his bounty for food, raiment, and all the blessings of life;
teach her to place her whole confidence in his mercy, to receive even the
smallest blessing with gratitude, and to bow under the heaviest affliction with
patience and humility.

But above all things, mind that your example does not contradict you precept.
What confidence can a child place in the religion of its parent, when the
parent lives in direct opposition to the principles of that religion.

Oh! my dear friend, this is the one thing needful! this the heavenly
comforter, that supports us through life, and will cheer us in the hour of
death!

Our duty is plainly marked and so easy, that when we do not perform it, we
take more pains to court misery, than would suffice to make us truly happy.
What can be more easily comprehended even by the meanest understanding. "Do
justly, love mercy, and walk humbly." Love thy Creator above all things, and
thy neighbor as thyself! forgive as you hope to be forgiven. And remember,
"That with the same measure you mete, the like shall be given to you again."

My dear young friends, think me not too serious. I am old, and sinking to the
grave, I am convinced of the necessity of living well, if we hope to die in
peace; and solicitous for the welfare of all dear to the family of Winworth. I
have exerted myself to write this, which you may consider as my last farewell.

God preserve and bless you all, may peace reign in your hearts, and true piety
direct your actions; may you so pass through this transitory life, as not to
dread the approach of the messenger that shall convey you to eternal rest.

And when, at last, Death shall your frame destroy.
Die by some sudden ecstacy of joy!
Peaceful heep out the sabbath of the tomb,
And (...) to raptures in a life to come.
MENTORIA.

ESSAY ON FEMALE EDUCATION.
IT is much to be lamented, that in the present mode of educating females, the
useful is entirely neglected, for the more ornamental and superficial
accomplishments.

There was a time, when, if the daughter of a reputable tradesman could read
and write good English, handle her needle with neatness and celerity, and
understand both the theory and practice of good housewifery, she was thought
perfectly accomplished, and so indeed she was as those qalifications rendered
her capable of undertaking the management of a family.

But in the present refined age, if an industrious tradesman can afford to give
his daughter, five hundred pounds, it is immediately settled by Mamma, that
Miss must be genteelly educated

Accordingly she is at an early age sent to a boarding-school, where she learns
to jabber bad French, and worse English; the old-fashion sampler, and useful
plain-work are neglected, and she is instructed how to work fillagree, make
wafer work, daub satin, and work ill proportioned figures in cloth, which in
due time are curiously mounted, and hung round to ornament the parlour of the
fond but ill judging parents.

Add to these accomplishments the very fashionable one of jingling the keys of
the harpsichord, with great velocity, though perhaps out of time and out of
tune.

Imagine Miss just returned, at the age of seventeen, her mind puffed up with
vanity, and her head well stored with sensibility, and all the delicate
feelings to be gleaned from a circulating library, the contents of which she
has eagerly and indiscriminately perused, without any one taking the pains to
direct her judgment or correct her taste.

We will suppose her lovely in her person, and attractive in her manners, she
comes home, and is idolized by her too partial mother, and spoken of by her
father with pride and exultation; but alas! she is too fine a lady to pay any
attention to the domestic concerns of the family.

In this foolish idea she is indulged by the mother, who thinks her dear girl's
beauty, sensibility, and accomplishments, will undoubtedly obtain her a match
far superior to her present station, and she will have no occasion to be a good
housewife.

But these sanguine wishes are seldom if ever realized, and we will suppose her
married to a man who is just entered into a genteel and improving line of
business; her friends think it a good match, her fortune is an acquisition to
her husband and they enter the career of life with all the hopes of permanent
happiness which peace plenty can inspire.

But what a wretched figure does this elegant accomplished girl make, as
mistress of a family; her servants cheat and laugh at her, her acquaintance
blame her, and perhaps she may incur even the censure of her husband, for
paying no more attention to matters which so nearly concern his interest.

Has she children, she knows not how to make or mend their clothes, she is
always surrounded with difficulties, from which she knows not how to extricate
herself, and ashamed to confess her ignorance to any one who could instruct her
in the point she requires, she becomes peevish and dissatisfied, neglects even
those accomplishments which she formerly strove so hard to attain; becomes
negligent in her dress, careless in her manners, and sinks into a very blank in
the creation.

Her husband disappointed in not seeing that order and regularity at home which
he had once fondly hoped, no longer finds any charms in her society, and seeks
to forget his disappointment either in the bottle, or at the gaming table, both
equally destructive; and she fees inevitable ruin approaching, without the
smallest power to ward off the blow.

Nor can the whole universe present us with an object more truly deserving our
pity, than such a woman in a state of penury! She is at a loss how to perform
even the necessary duties of life, she cannot exert herself to obtain even a
single meal for herself or children; she pines in obscurity, regretting her
useless education, and wishes that the sums so expended, had been laid by to
increase her fortune, and she herself had been only instructed in those things,
which would have tended ultimately to render her a useful and respectable
member of society.

But how widely different is the lot of the happy girl, whose parents have, not
only by precept but example, implanted in her mind the great necessity of
rendering herself useful, before she can be esteemed valuable -- who perfectly
understands how to manage her family, and regulate her servants -- who to
affability and cheerfulness, and industry, economy and piety.

Such a woman when she marries, however small her fortune, brings to her
husband an inexhaustible fund of treasure. She is not ashamed to investigate
even the minutest concerns of her family; her expenses are regulated by the
strictest rules of frugality void of parsimony, with one hand she secures her
husband's interest, and with the other dispenses to the sons and daughters of
poverty, the overplus of those blessings which her own prudence has helped to
secure to herself.

She is always strictly neat in her apparel, but entirely free from show or
finery; her whole family is regular, uniform and decent, her servants respect
her, her husband idolizes her, and her children look up to her as their friend
and benefactress, from whose bright example they may learn the road to
happiness.

Should even misfortune overtake her, she is still cheerful, still
unembarrassed, without a murmur she condescends to perform even the meanest
offices for herself, her husband, and children; she exerts her utmost abilities
to retrieve the prosperity they had unfortunately lost, she shares her husbands
care, and alleviates his concern -- and should their honest efforts to regain
their former state of affluence fail, she sets down perfectly happy in the
reflection that she had discharged, to the utmost of her power, the duties of
that station, in which it pleased Heaven to place her.

Yet, think not I mean entirely to set aside those accomplishments, which when
kept under proper regulations, certainly tend to make the female character more
irresistibly charming.

There are a certain class of women to whom these accomplishments are
absolutely necessary, to their filling their respective characters with
propriety.

A woman of independent fortune may with safety indulge her taste for music,
drawing, etc. but, in the name of common sense, what has a girl to do with the
fine arts, who, perhaps, after she leaves school, has neither time or
opportunity to pursue those studies, unless by so doing, she neglects some more
useful employment.

I acknowledge that it is not impossible for the useful and ornamental branches
of education to be combined; nay, that it is even natural for a woman of sense
and discretion to endeavor to blend them in such a manner, as to render them
only as soils to each other, and the woman who studies to unite in herself, the
attentive housewife, the good mother, affectionate wife, well-informed
companion, and accomplished woman, is certainly a character deserving esteem
and veneration, we look upon her almost as a being of a superior order, and she
is at once beloved, admired and respected by both sexes.

As so much of the happiness of mankind depends on the females connected in
their families, I have expatiated on the necessity of young women being brought
up in the practice of every domestic virtue, more largely than I at first
intended since not only the rising generation, but ages yet unborn shall
venerate or execrate our memories, according to the advice and example we give
our children.

If the daughters of the present age are suffered to remain totally ignorant of
the domestic regulations necessary to be observed in every family, what are we
to expect in the next generation, but that the ruin which has already begun to
show itself in our most capital cities, will spread itself all over the
kingdom, and sink it at last in one universal state of bankruptcy.

More, much more than we should at first be led to imagine, depends on the
education of the female world. What ruin, what inevitable desolation may not an
idle dissipated woman bring on those who may unfortunately be attached to her
person.

And on the contrary, how does a sensible, virtuous, well-informed female,
exalt and ennoble the thoughts of all who converse with her.

Were every parent of my opinion they would first, by example, plant the seeds
of genuine worth in the breast of their daughters, and by the tenderest care
and mildest precept, cultivate each budding virtue, 'till they blossomed in
full perfection, then ornamenting them with the elegant accomplishments
necessary to complete the female character, render them at once the pride and
glory of their country.

URGANDA AND FATIMA, AN EASTERN TALE.
IN one of the most beautiful valleys that lies upon the borders of the East
lived Zegdad, an inoffensive shepherd. He had but one child, and having been
early deprived of his wife, he lavished his whole stock of tenderness of Fatima.

Though fortune had not been lavish of her gifts to the father of Fatima, yet
he wanted not the necessaries or comforts of life -- his cottage was clean, and
furnished with every thing useful; his fields supplied them with food; his
flock with raiment.

Fatima was coarse in her person, but she was cheerful and good-natured -- she
rose each morn with the feathered songsters, and cheerfully performed the
duties of her station; her whole study was to please her father, and a smile
from Zegdad was at any time, ample recompense for the severest fatigue, and
like a cordial served to revive her drooping spirits. She would assist,
unasked, in the most laborious employments, and when the labor of the day was
past, she would lightly trip over the green turf, with her young companions,
while her father played on the flagelet. The mind of Fatima was calm as the
delights of Paradise.

One day her father sent her to the grand Vizier's, with fruit for his favorite
-- she was conducted by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful Semira
was reposing on a bed of roses, clad in all the pomp of eastern magnificence,
while two slaves were fanning her to rest.

Fatima had never before seen aught but simplicity -- she was filled with
wonder and astonishment at the surprising beauty and grandeur of Semira, and as
she gazed, envy and discontent crept into her hitherto guileless heart.

She returned home with a mind totally altered to what it was. Her rural
pastimes no more deligted her -- labor was now a trouble -- she had been a
witness to the ease and indolence of Semira. If at any time she caught a
glimpse of her person in the stream, she turned from it with disgust. Her days
were joyless, and her nights spent in bewailing her unhappy lot.

One evening, deaf to the solicitations of her young companions, she retired to
a thick grove, and inattentive to the sound of the flagelet, thus gave vent to
her sorrow.

Oh! wretched Fatima, unhappy maid! Why was I born to know so hard a fate -- to
eat the bread of labor, to sleep upon a rushy couch, while Semira is
surrounded with splendour, is served by kneeling slaves, and sleeps on a bed of
down! Why has nature denied me those ravishing beauties, it has so bountifully
lavished on her, her eyes are bright as the stars, her lips like half blown
roses, her hand and arm like polished ivory. Oh! why was I not lovely as
Semira, and favorite to the grand Vizier -- in this low abject state my being
is intolerable, I will no longer endure it but in but in yon limpid stream lose
the remembrance of myself and Semira.

At this moment the Fairy Urganda stood before her.

"Thy complaints are just, Oh! Fatima (said she) and if thou will relinquish
thy home, and forsake thy father, thou shall enjoy the utmost extent of thy
wishes."

Fatima eagerly complied with the offered terms and the Fairy immediately
sprinkled her with water at the same time pronouncing some mystic words, when
she was transformed into a virgin of transcendent beauty, and found herself in
the garden of a palace belonging to the grand Vizier.

The lovely Semira had the day before offended her Lord, and was no longer a
favorite. Fatima attracted the notice of the Vizier -- he ordered her to be led
into splendid apartments, clothed with costly robes, adorned with jewels, and
appointed slaves to wait on her, and comply with all-her wishes -- and Fatima
supplied the place of the degraded Semira.

She now thought herself the happiest among the happy; but the Vizier was
passionate, capricious, jealous, and extremely cruel, and it was not long
before the disappointed Fatima discovered that to be favorite to the grand
Vizier, was to live only in splendid slavery.

"But though (said she often to herself) though the grand Vizier's favorite is
miserable, how superlatively happy must be the favorite Sultana of my Lord the
Emperor! Oh! could I but attain that envied station, how soon should the
imperious Vizier suffer for his barbarity to me."

Again did the bosom of Fatima suffer all the miseries of discontent -- the
vaulted roofs, spacious gardens, and rich presents of the Vizier, no longer
charmed her. She sighed for the ensigns of royalty, and her pillow was nightly
bedewed with her tears.

One evening she retired to an arbor, at the extremity of the garden, and
throwing herself on the hanks where she had first seen Semira, thus poured
forth her complaints.

"How wretched is the fate of Fatima -- condemned to drag a hated being with a
man who studies only his own gratification, and expects me to be the slave of
his caprice and passion. Oh! could I but get from this detested place, I would
fly to my Lord the Emperor, and bow myself low in the dust before him. My
charms might captivate his royal heart, and I might reign the Empress of the
East."

As she spoke these words, a sudden light entered the arbor, and the Fairy
Urganda again stood before her.

"Beautiful Fatima, said she, forbear your complaints, the prophet permits you
to enjoy your wish, then rise and follow me."

The Fairy led her to the Emperor's palace, and placed her among a number of
beautiful slaves, from among which the Emperor was next morning to choose a
favorite.

In the morning the Emperor passed through the apartment, and his choice fell
on Fatima. She was clothed in the ensigns of royalty, led in state to the
mosque, and in a few hours heard herself proclaimed Empress of the East.

But Fatima had, to the idea of royalty, annexed the ideas of youth and beauty,
how surprised was she then to find the Emperor, old, ugly, and deformed in his
person, morose in his disposition, and jealous in the extreme -- she shrunk
from his embraces with horror, and contracted so settled an aversion to him,
that not all the splendour that awaited her could in the smallest degree
compensate for the many tedious hours she was obliged to devote to him.

Among the slaves that attended on Fatima, was the (...) Zynina, who had long,
with envious eyes, beheld the love of the Emperor bestowed on others, and only
watched an opportunity to ingratiate herself in his favor, by rendering him
some piece of service. To this end she cultivated the friendship of the new
Queen, and by degrees drew from her the reason of her tears and dejection.

This intelligence was instantly conveyed to the Emperor, with the addition of
Fatima's heart being dedicated to another. Osmin willing to be convinced of the
truth of Zynina's declaration, desired to be concealed in an apartment
adjoining the Queen's, where he might easily overhear any thing that passed
between her and the deceitful slave, who immediately returned to her mistress,
and artfully renewed the conversation.

Fatima, glad to unburthen her almost bursting heart, confessed her settled
aversion to her Lord, and that death itself would be preferable to her present
situation. "Then death be thy portion," cried the enraged Emperor, furiously
rushing into the apartment, and lifting his glittering scimitar.

Fatima fell upon her knees, and, in an agony of terror exclaimed, "O that I
was an humble cottager, and had never known the pangs that wait on greatness."

At that moment she found herself clad in her former homely apparel, standing
at the door of her father's cottage, when the Fairy appeared and thus addressed
her.

"Fatima, I have shown you the vanity of human wishes, learn from hence to be
content with the allotments of Providence. Whatever be your situation in life,
submit to it without repining, and know that our Holy Prophet, who orders all
things in this terrestrial world knows what is best for mortals: Fulfill
therefore the respective duties of thy station, to the utmost of thy power:
envy not the superior lot of another, but humbly take the blessings within thy
reach, enjoy them and be happy.

THE INCENDIARY.
AMONG the many evils that escaped from Pandora's box, to infest and plague
mankind, I know of none that has done more mischief than envy.

Good heavens! how depraved must be the heart that is pained by the prosperity,
merit, or beauty of another, or rejoices in their debasement.

Methinks, when I look round the world, I am ready to hail each member of
society as my brother or sister, I rejoice in their success, acknowledge their
merit, admire their beauty, lament their misfortunes, and shed the tear of
sincere compassion over their vices. I would not possess a heart absorbed in
selfish views for the universe.

The man who lives only for himself, is, in my opinion, a monster of
ingratitude; his life is one continued blank, except marked by some act of
inhumanity. If we must reckon that day lost in which we perform no good action,
what must we think of a life passed in a continued series of stupid inattention
to the distresses or injuries of our fellow creatures.

Hail! heaven-born charity! bright resplendent virtue; whose dazzling rays hide
from the accusing angel multitudes of offenses, blessed is the heart thou do
inhabit, happy is the man whose actions are guided by thee.

By charity I do not mean the merely sharing with those that need the
superabundant gifts of fortune, though it is certainly our duty to alleviate the
misfortunes of others, yet by so doing we do not fully discharge the duties of
christianity. Charity is that benevolence of heart, that meekness of spirit,
which leads us to judge favorably of the actions of others, never to propagate
a story to the injury of a neighbor's character, but to stand forward the
champion of innocence, and to defend those, whom envy, malice, or revenge, have
aspersed. Conscious of its own rectitude, suspects not the integrity of
another; ever ready to pour the balm of consolation into the heart wounded by
sorrow; envies no person's superior lot, but takes the portion assigned by
providence; with gratitude, uses it with prudence, and gives the overplus to
the sons and daughters of poverty, looks round the world with a smile of
complacency, and wishes every bosom as tranquil as its own.

Yet there are people in the world whose chief pleasure consists in villifying
and aspersing the characters even of their best friends, and sorry I am to say,
those characters are too frequently found among the fair sex. Would they but
consider that while depressing the merits of another, they do not increase
their own, but rather attract notice, and lead their acquaintance narrowly to
scrutinize the conduct of a woman, who is so severe upon their errors, it would
certainly, in some measure, stop the unbounded license they give their tongues.

I do not know a more hateful character than Hecatissa, she has indulged this
evil propensity 'till it has become a part of her nature, and she could no more
entertain you for a few hours without a tale of scandal than she could walk
over the glassy surface of the ocean. Many is the feeling heart she has
wounded, many a breach of friendship has taken its rise from her malevolent
tongue, she cares not how dear the ties she endeavors to break, she will sow
dissension between father and child, brother and sister husband and wife, and
exult in the misery the occasions; under the fairest semblance of friendship,
she will steal upon the unsuspecting heart, and after being treated with
unbounded confidence, like the ungrateful serpent, sting the breast that
harbors her!

She was, when very young, by the treachery of a near relation, thrown into a
distressing situation, from which the bounty and generosity of a widow lady
relieved her; not satisfied with merely administering to her present wants, she
took her into her family, and made her companion to her daughter.

The innocent Anna conceived a sincere friendship for her, and for many years
they lived like sisters; innumerable were the favors heaped on Hecatissa, who
remained with the family; till a worthy man, attracted by her person and
specious manner, made honorable proposals and married her.

Hecatissa might now have been the happiest woman breathing -- her husband was
generous, humane, friendly, and good-natured to excess. He presented her to his
family, who received her cordially, and the poor easy good man thought he had
insured his own felicity, but Hecatissa soon shone forth in her own proper
character.

She planted dissension in her husband's family, assumed an unbecoming
authority over all his actions, and by her artful ascendancy contracted his
heart, and made him treat with disrespect the very family who had sheltered her
unprotected youth! Her vile insinuations were aimed at the character of Anna,
nor was she the only object of her malice; every woman who possessed superior
endowments of person or mind, was to her a fit subject for slander. She wished
no person to be more fortunate or happy than herself, she listened to every
malicious tale with avidity, repeated them with pleasure, and aggravated every
circumstance which had the least appearance of vice or folly. She would stoop
to such meanness, that rather than not compass a favorite point, she would
tamper with servants, to obtain the secrets of a family.

She was once on a visit at the house of Serena, she found her beloved by her
servants, respected by her friends, and tenderly esteemed by her husband. Vexed
to see how superior she was in every respect to herself, she eagerly watched
for some opportunity to lessen her merit. She wrested the most innocent and
even laudable actions into guilt, she poisoned the minds of her servants, and
traduced her reputation assuming the appearance of humility and virtue, she
endeavored to throw on Serena the odium of every vice which deformed her own
character.

But Serena was not long inveloped in the cloud Hecatissa had spread over her;
she continued in the regular discharge of the duties of her station, paid no
regard to the malicious slanders she daily heard, but, pitying the woman who
could so far forget truth and justice as to blacken the character of one she
professed a friendship for, treated her with the silent contempt her conduct
merited.

No sensible person will scruple to affirm that Hecatissa is miserable. Hated
and despised by all her acquaintance, her society is shunned like the
pestilence; and though by her consummate art she still imposes upon her
husband, and retains his affection, her discontent and ill nature prevent her
reaping any pleasure in his company; she is jealous, peevish and uneasy; in
short she has such a legion of torments in her own bosom, that she often
applies to a comforting cordial to raise her depressed spirits.

However despicable the character of Hecatissa may appear that of Prudelia is
equally so. Prudelia is a woman who pays the nicest regard to propriety and
decorum, she is ever prying into her neighbor's conduct, and if their actions
do not exactly agree with her scrupulous notions of rectitude, she hesitates
not to conclude them abandoned and lost to every sense of virtue.

Albert and Julia had been married near four years, during which time they had
lived in mutual love and confidence, when their ill-fortune took them to live
in the same street with Prudelia. Albert followed the sea, of consequence Julia
was often left for months together the guardian of her honor, the mistress of
her own actions. She was lively in her disposition, but her heart was the seat
of pure innocence.

Albert was gone his accustomed voyage, when Prudelia undertook to scrutinize
the conduct of Julia.

Prudelia had visited her, she had been a witness to the innocent gaiety of her
temper, she had even pretended to admire her vivacity and good-humor, but she
whispered among her friends, that she thought it was highly improper for a
young woman like her, whose husband was from home, to receive so much company,
or be so frequent in her visits abroad. She watched every movement of Julia,
was informed of all her visitors names, knew what time they came and went and
even what hours she retired to rest and arose.

Julia was a woman of nice feelings, she was tenacious of honor; and the bare
idea of that honor being suspected was extremely painful to her. She was uneasy
at the watchful eye Prudelia kept upon her actions, not that she feared to have
them srcutinized, but because she did not think herself obliged to be
accountable for her conduct to any person but her husband. She therefore grew
distant and reserved, and whenever Prudelia called on her, gave little or no
answer to her many artful questions concerning where she had been, or how she
had spent her time.

About this time a brother of Julia's failed in business, he retired to a house
in the environs of Westminster, to avoid the importunity of his creditors.

Julia was tenderly attached to her brother, she exerted every power to serve
his distressed family, and even parted with her plate, and some other
valuables, to raise money to supply the present exigence.

The attorney who had the care of settling her brother's affairs, was
frequently with her for an hour or two together, and often she went away with
him in a coach, and was absent for several days, as the business which employed
so large a share of her time, required secresy, she never mentioned it to
Prudelia nor did she when going out ever tell the servant where she was to be
found.

One morning the attorney had breakfasted with her and she was gone with him to
her brother, when Albert unexpectedly returned. The servant could give no
account where her mistress was, and Prudelia who had seen him return, came over
to invite him to dine with her family.

I am sorry my Julia is from home, said he, but there was no possibility of her
thinking to see me to day, as I am returned at least six weeks before the time
appointed.

Why yes, replied Prudelia, with a significant look, I fancy you will be a very
unexpected guest.

It will be an agreeable surprise though, said Albert.

Perhaps so, said, Prudelia smiling, contemptuously.

The smile, the significant look, alarmed Albert, have you any reason to think
otherways, madam, said he? Surely Julia will be pleased with my return.

Oh! most certainly she will, replied she, smiling again; but, no doubt, she
would have liked a little more warning of your arrival.

By heavens, madam, said Albert, your words distress me beyond measure, you
cannot mean to glance an aspersion at the character of Julia, and yet what
other motive can you have for those contemptuous smiles. Tell me, dear madam,
the meaning of these ambiguous looks; but hold, if it is any thing to Julia's
disadvantage I shall not believe it though uttered by an angel.

Indeed, Sir, (said Prudelia, assuming a serious countenance, in which was
blended a mixture of pity and anger) far be it from me to injure the reputation
of any woman, or ever interfere between man and wife, you are united for life,
and it is therefore your duty to bear with each others foibles, as well as you
can.

My Julia has no foibles, replied Albert, or it she has I never discovered them.

I do not pretend to say she has, my good friend, but I wish she would come
home.

Albert joined the wish, and the day passed on without much farther
conversation.

As the evening advanced he grew uneasy, and when the clock struck ten, he
exclaimed impatiently, where can she be?

Patience, my good Sir, said the artful Prudelia, you may not perhaps see her
these two or three hours.

Julia was not used to keep such late hours, said he pensively.

Oh! that is nothing, new connections form new manners she is never home much
earlier, nay, it is very likely she may not be at home to night.

You seem to be aiming at something, madam, said Albert, for heaven's sake
speak out, and deliver me from this torture of suspense.

This was the favorable moment for the vile incendiary -- she prefaced her
scandalous tale, with the sorrow she felt at being obliged to give his worthy
heart so much pain, said, had Julia returned in any tolerable time, she would
have kept the affair to herself, but as she found he already began to suspect
something was amiss, she thought it was best he should be informed of the
whole, that he might take his measures accordingly.

She then informed him, that during his abscence Julia's extravagance had known
no bounds -- that she had paid no regard to her reputation -- received the
constant visits of one particular gentleman, and made frequent excursions into
the country with him, where she staid for several days, that to supply her
extravagance and that of her paramour, she had parted with her watch, plate,
and other valuables, and concluded with saying, her heart bled to think so
worthy a man should be united to a woman who knew so little how to value her
good fortune.

Albert listened with every mark of horror and astonishment, at length
(starting from his seat and stamping his foot with vehemence) he cried, it is
every syllable as false as hell, my Julia can never have betrayed the honor I
trusted to her care, or abused the confidence I reposed in her.

It Is well, Sir, replied Prudelia, with a look of offended pride, you doubt my
veracity, however you will find the whole neighborhood are acquainted with her
errors, as well as I am* nay call your own servant, she can assert the truth of
what I say.

The servant was called, she confirmed the infamous tale, and Albert vowed to
be revenged on his innocent wife.

Prudelia had judged rightly, Julia did not return that night, and though
Albert went home, and retired to his apartment, he never attempted to lie down,
but traversed the room in the utmost agitation of spirits during the whole
night.

In the mean time Julia was enjoying, with her brother's family, the most
exquisite satisfaction. His failure was occasioned by remittances arriving in
proper time for him to make good some obligations he had entered into, the
money Julia had raised for him, had prevented immediate bankruptcy, and that
day several ships had arrived with remittances, which would again enable him to
appear among his friends with credit.

The whole family were together at his lodgings, and a smile of tranquillity
sat on every countenance. -- How very happy I should be, said Julia, looking
round her, if my Albert was joined in this loved company, I should then, at one
view, behold all that is most dear to me on earth.

When supper was over, the evening was far advanced, Julia proposed staying
with them all night, and walking home in the cool of the morning.

She retired to rest with a heart lightened of its cares, offered up a prayer
for her Albert's safety, and sunk into an undisturbed slumber, little thinking
the miseries that awaited her in the morning.

At six o'clock she arose, and kissing her little sleeping niece, who had been
her bedfellow, stole softly down stairs, and walked leisurely toward home,
enjoying the freshness of the morning, as she walked through the park, and
contemplating on the happy change in her brother's affairs.

It was near eight o'clock when she arrived at her own door. My master is come
home, madam, said the maid, as she opened it.

Home, cried Julia, in an accent of joyful surprise, and running eagerly up
stairs, opened the door of his apartment, and would have thrown herself into
his arms, but he pushed her from him with violence, and cried by heavens, this
affected joy shall not cover your guilt; then looking at her sternly, he added,
how have you passed this night, degenerate ungrateful Julia?

Julia had never been addressed by Albert before but in a voice of the most
soothing tenderness. She staggered to the nearest chair, and faintly
exclaiming, what a horrid change is this, and burst into a violent flood of
tears.

Albert had never seen his Julia weep before, but his heart wept with her, but
he now took her surprise for a token of guilt, and imputed her tears to the
effects of art. He therefore regarded them not, but walked about the room in
sullen silence.

Oh! heavens, said Julia, what have I done to deserve this; tell me, Albert,
how have I forfeited your affection?

By betraying my honor, said he fiercely, by becoming an abandoned wanton.

Heaven is my witness, I have done neither, said she, sinknig on her knees, Oh!
Albert, kill me instantly, but do not suspect my fidelity. I will bless you
with my last breath, and dying, declare, I never entertained even a thought to
the prejudice of your honor, or the purity of the affection I bear to you.

Cursed dissembler, said the enraged Albert, and he spurned her from him with
his foot. She shrieked and fell, her head struck the bed-post, and the blood
gushed in a torrent from her forehead.

Merciful heaven, cried he, I have murdered her. He caught her from the ground,
but found neither sense nor breath remained. Frantic, he rang the bell for a
servant, and sent for immediate assistance.

A surgeon examined her head, the skull was fractured. After the wound was
dressed she opened her eyes, and fixed them upon her husband.

Albert, said she, I know not who has poisoned your mind, or how you could
suspect the fidelity of Julia. Believe me, I am innocent, in my cabinet you
will find papers, that will unravel any seeming mystery in my late conduct. I
die, but dying bless you, for all your kindness to me. Ah! my love, it is not
the wound I received on my head, but that which you inflicted on my heart, that
terminates my existence! I loved you too well, Albert, to feel the privation of
your affection and live; my heart unprepared to meet your unkindness sunk under
it, struggled and broke.

She attempted to throw her arms round his neck, but nature was exhausted; she
could only say, Oh! bless him heaven -- and her spirit took its flight to the
regions of eternal day.

Albert's distress was too great for description, when he sound he had by his
blind passion, terminated the existence of an innocent, valuable woman, whom he
loved with the most fervent affection. A deep melancholy seized him, nor could
all the attentions of his friends rouse him from the torpid stupor he had sunk
into, he grew worse and worse, and ended his days in a mad-house.

As there are too many Prudelia's in the world, we cannot be too cautious how
we believe a malevolent assertion, or give way to suspicion and jealousy.
