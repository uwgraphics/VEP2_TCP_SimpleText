ORATORIO.
SOLOMON's TEMPLE.
[As it was performed for the BENEFIT of SICK and DISTRESSED FREE MASONS.]

DRAMATIS PERSONAE.
SOLOMON, the GRAND MASTER. HIGH PRIEST. HIRAM, the Workman. URIEL, Angel of
the Sun. SHEBA, Queen of the South.
CHORUS of PRIESTS and NOBLES.

ACT I.
SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. CONVENED we are met -- chief oracle of heaven,
To whom the sacred mysteries are given;
We Are met to bid a splendid fabric rise,
Worthy the mighty ruler of the skies.

HIGH PRIEST. And lo! where Uriel, angel of the sun,
Arrives to see the mighty business done.
AIR. Behold he comes upon the wings of light,
And with his sunny vestments clears the sight.

URIEL. RECITATIVE. The Lord supreme, Grand Master of the skies,
Who bid creation from a chaos rise;
The rules of architecture first engraved
On Adam's heart.

CHORUS of Priests and Nobles. To heaven's High Architect, all praise,
All gratitude be given;
Who deigned the human soul to raise,
By secrets sprung from heaven.

SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. Adam, well versed in arts,
Gave to his sons the plumb and line;
By Masonry, sage Tubal Cain,
To the deep organ tuned the strain.
AIR. And while he swelled the melting note,
On high the silver concords float.

HIGH PRIEST. RECITATIVE accompanied. Upon the surface of the waves,
(When God a mighty deluge pours)
Noah a chosen remnant saves,
And laid the ark's stupendous floors.

URIEL. AIR. Hark, from on high, the mason word!
' David, my servant, shall not build
'A lodge for heaven's all sovereign Lord,
'Since blood and war have stained his shield;
'That for our deputy, his son,
'We have reserved -- Prince Solomon.

Da capa. CHORUS of Priests and Nobles. Sound great JEHOVAH's praise,
Who bid young Solomon the temple raise.

SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. So grand a structure shall we raise,
That men shall wonder! Angels gaze!
By art divine it shall be reared,
Nor shall the hammer's noise be heard.

CHORUS. Sound great JEHOVAH's praise,
Who bid King Solomon the temple raise.

URIEL. RECITATIVE. To plan the mighty dome,
Hiram, the master mason's come.
AIR BY URIEL. We know thee by thy apron white,
We know thee by thy trowel bright,
Well skilled in Masonry;
We know thee by the jewel's blaze,
Thy manly walk and air;
Instructed, thou the lodge shall raise;
Let all for work prepare.

HIRAM. AIR. Not like Babel's haughty building,
Shall our greater lodge be framed;
That to hideous jargon yielding,
Justly was a Babel named:
There confusion all o'erbearing,
Neither sign nor word they knew;
We our work with order squaring,
Each proportion shall be true.

SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. Cedars which since creation grew,
Fall of themselves to grace the dome*
All Lebanon, as if she knew
The great occasion, lo is come!

URIEL. AIR. Behold, my brethren of the sky,
The work begins, worthy an angel's eye.
CHORUS of Priests and Nobles. Be present, all ye heavenly hosts;
The work begins, the Lord defrays the cost.

ACT II.
SCENE I.
MESSENGER. RECITATIVE. Behold, attended by a numerous train,
Queen of the South, fair Sheba, greets thy reign!
In admiration of thy wisdom, she
Comes to present the bended knee.

SOLOMON to HIRAM. Receive her with a fair salute,
Such as with majesty may suit.

HIRAM. AIR. When allegiance bids obey,
We with pleasure own its sway.
Enter SHEBA, attended. Obedient to superior greatness, see
Our scepter hails thy mightier majesty.

SHEBA. AIR Thus Phoebe, queen of shade and night,
Owning the sun's superior rays,
With feeble glory, lesser light,
Attends the triumph of his blaze:
Oh, all excelling Prince, receive
The tribute due to such a king;
Not the gift, but will, believe;
Take the heart, not what we bring.

Da capo. SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. Let measures softly sweet,
Illustrious Sheba's presence greet.

SOLOMON. AIR. Tune the lute and string the lyre,
Equal to the fair we sing:
Who can see and not admire,
Sheba, consort for a king:
Enlivening wit and beauty join,
Melting sense and graceful air;
Here united powers combine
To make her brightest of the fair.

Da capo. SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. Hiram, our brother and our friend,
Do thou the Queen with me attend.

SCENE II.
A View of the TEMPLE. HIGH PRIEST. RECITATIVE. Sacred to heaven, behold the
dome appears;
Lo, what august solemnity it wears;
Angels themselves have deigned to deck the frame,
And beauteous Sheba shall report its fame
AIR. When the Queen of the South shall return
To the climes which acknowledge her sway;
Where the sun's warmer beams fiercely burn,
The Princess with transport shall say:
Well worthy my journey, I Have seen
A Monarch both graceful and wise,
Deserving the love of a Queen,
And a temple well worthy the skies.

Da capa. CHORUS. Open, ye gates, receive the Queen who shares,
With equal sense, your happiness and cares.

HIRAM. RECITATIVE. Of riches much, but more of wisdom see,
Proportioned workmanship, and Masonry.

HIRAM. AIR. Oh, charming Sheba, there behold,
What massy stores of burnished gold,
Yet richer is our art;
Not all the orient gems that shine,
Nor treasures of rich Ophir's mine,
Excel the Mason's heart:
True to the fair he honors, more
Than glittering gems of brightest ore,
The plighted pledge of love:
To every tie of honor bound,
In love and friendship constant found,
And favored from above.

SOLOMON and SHEBA. DUET. SHEBA. One gem beyond the rest I see,
And charming Solomon is he.

SOLOMON. One gem beyond the rest I see,
Fairest of fair ones, thou art she.

SHEBA. Oh, thou surpassing all men wise;

SOLOMON. And thine excelling women's eyes.

HIRAM. RECITATIVE. Wisdom and beauty does combine,
Our art to raise, our hearts to join.

CHORUS. Give to Masonry the prize,
Where the fairest choose the wise;
Beauty still should wisdom love;
Beauty and order reign above.

ODES.
HAIL to the CRAFT! at whose serene command
The gentle ARTS in glad obedience stand:
Hail sacred MASONRY! of source divine,
Unerring sovereign of the unerring line:
Whose plumb of truth, with never failing sway,
Makes the joined parts of symmetry obey;
Whose magic stroke bids fell confusion cease,
And to the finished ORDERS gives a place:
Who rears vast structures from the womb of earth,
And gives imperial cities glorious birth.
To works of Art HER merit not consigned,
SHE regulates the morals, squares the mind;
Corrects with care the sallies of the soul,
And points the tide of passions where to roll:
On Virtue's tablet marks HER moral rule,
And forms HER Lodge an universal school;
Where Nature's mystic laws unfolded stand,
And Sense and Science joined, go hand in hand.
O may HER social rules instructive spread,
Till Truth erect HER long neglected head*
Till through deceitful night SHE dart her ray,
And beam full glorious in the blaze of day!
Till men by virtuous maxims learn to move,
Till all the peopled world HER laws approve,
And Adam's race are bound in brother's love.
ODE.
[Written by a Member of the ALFRID LODGE at OXFORD, set to Music by Dr.
FISHER, and performed at the Dedication of FREE-MASONS HALL.]
Rapid zephyrs, as ye fly,
Waft our voices to the sky;
While we celebrate the NINE,
And the wonders of the Trine,
While the ANGELS sing above,
As we below, of PEACE and LOVE.
ODE.
By Brother DUNKERLEY.
ALMIGHTY Sire! our heavenly king,
Before whose sacred name we bend,
Accept the praises which we sing,
And to our humble prayer attend!
All hail great architect divine!
This universal frame is thine.
Thou who did Persia's king command,
A proclamation to extend,
That Israel's sons might quit his land,
Their holy temple to attend.
That sacred place where three in one,
Comprised thy comprehensive name;
And where the bright meridian sun
Was soon thy glory to proclaim.
Thy watchful eye, a length of time,
The wondrous circle did attend:
The glory and the power be thine,
Which shall from age to age descend.
On thy omnipotence we rest,
Secure of thy protection here;
And hope hereafter to be blessed,
When we have left this world of care.
Grant us, Great God, thy powerful aid,
To guide us through this vale of tears;
For where thy goodness is displayed,
Peace sooths the mind, and pleasure cheers.
Inspire us with thy grace divine,
Thy sacred law our guide shall be:
To every good our hearts incline,
From every evil keep us free.
All hail! etc.
ODE.
By the SAME.
HAIL, universal Lord!
By heaven and earth adored
All hail! great God!
Before thy name we bend,
To us thy grace extend,
And to our prayer attend.
All hail! great God!
ODE.
URANIA, hail! to thee we sing,
And all with pleasure own the lay;
Which from thy sacred fountain spring,
To clad the free born sons of day;
O still attend our meetings here,
With peace serene, and joy sincere.
True joys unruffled, calm repose,
In friendship's sacred band behold,
The happy recompense of those
Who laws and liberty uphold;
Who scorn all base unmanly views,
From vice refrain, and virtue choose.
May each Free Mason good and true,
In Britain's isle be ever found;
And in remotest regions too,
May love and harmony abound;
And all confess true Wisdom's power,
Till Time and Masons are no more.
ODE.
By Brother FENNER.
WITH grateful hearts your voices raise,
To sound the great Creator's praise,
Who by his word dispelled the night,
And formed the ridiants beams of light;
Who framed the heaven's, the earth, the skies,
And bid the wondrous fabric rise,
Who viewed his work, and found it just,
And then created Man from dust.
Happy in Eden was he laid,
Nor did he go astray,
Till, by the serpent, Eve, betrayed,
First fell, and led the way.
But falling from this happy plain,
Subject to various wants and pain,
Labor and art must now provide,
What Eden freely once supplied;
Some learned to till the unwilling ground;
Some bid the well strung harp to sound;
Each different arts pursued and taught,
Till to perfection each was brought.
Masons pursue the truth divine,
We cannot go astray,
Since three great lights conjointly shine,
To point us out the way.
Zion appears, rejoice, rejoice,
Exult, and hear, obey the voice
Of mercy and enlightening grace,
Recalling us to Eden's place;
With faith believe, and hope pursue,
And mercy still for mercy show;
Proclaim aloud, with grateful theme,
The great Redeemer's blessed name;
The eastern star now shows us light,
Let us not go astray;
Let Faith, Hope, Charity unite,
To cheer the gladsome way.
ANTHEMS.
ANTHEM.
GRANT us, kind Heaven, what we request,
In Masonry let us be blessed;
Direct us to that happy place
Where friendship smiles in every face:
Where Freedom and sweet Innocence
Enlarge the mind and cheer the sense.
Where sceptered Reason, from her throne,
Surveys the LODGE, and makes us one;
And Harmony's delightful sway
Forever sheds ambrosial day:
Where we blessed Eden's pleasures taste,
While balmy joys are our repast.
No prying eye can view us here;
No fool or knave disturb our cheer;
Our well formed laws set mankind free,
And give relief to Misery:
The poor, oppressed with woe and grief,
Gain from our bounteous hands relief.
Our LODGE the social Virtues grace,
And Wisdom's rules we fondly trace;
Whole Nature open to our view,
Points out the paths we should pursue.
Let us subsist in lasting peace,
And may our happiness increase!
ANTHEM.
BY Mason's Art the aspiring dome
On stately columns shall arise,
All climates are their native home,
Their godlike actions reach the skies.
Heroes and kings revere their name,
While poets sing their lasting fame.
Great, noble, generous, good and brave;
All virtues they most justly claim;
Their deeds shall live beyond the grave,
And those unborn their praise proclaim.
Time shall their glorious acts enrol,
While love and friendship charm the soul.
ANTHEM.
"LET there be light!" -- the Almighty spoke,
Refulgent streams from chaos broke,
To illume the rising earth!
Well pleased the Great Jehovah stood --
The Power Supreme pronounced it good,
And gave the planets birth!
In choral numbers Masons join,
To bless and praise this light divine.
Parent of light! accept our praise!
Who shedd'st on us -- thy brightest rays,
The light that fills his mind --
By choice selected, lo! we stand,
By friendship joined, a social band!
That love -- that aid mankind!
In choral numbers, etc.
The widow's tear -- the orphan's cry --
All wants -- our ready hands supply,
As far as power is given!
The naked clothe -- the prisoner free --
These are thy works, sweet Charity!
Revealed to us from heaven!
In choral numbers, etc.
ANTHEM.
TO Heaven's high Architect all praise,
All praise, all gratitude be given;
Who deigned the human soul to raise,
By mystic secrets sprung from Heaven.
CHORUS.
Sound aloud the great JEHOVAH's praise;
To him the dome, the temple raise.
PROLOGUES.
PROLOGUE.
[Spoken before a Play performed at EXETER, in ENGLAND, at the desire of the
UNION LODGE.]

LADIES, perhaps you have heard of Gyges' ring,
Of which historians write, and poets sing:
Formed by a Lydian sage with potent spell,
This ring its wearer made invisible.
After his death it often changed its master,
At length fate destined it to Zoroaster.
By his successors carefully possessed,
Long did the Magi flourish in the east;
'Till Ammon's son with Thais thither came,
Who fired Persepolis to please the dame.
Beneath its ruins long the treasure lay,
'Till by an Arab robber brought to day.
Unconscious of the prize, he trudged along,
And sold it to a Bramin for a song.
Thence in Bengal through various hands it past,
And to a kinsman of my own at last:
He dying, gave it me, its virtues rare
Unfolded, and soon left a joyful heir:
To pass wherever I pleased, unseen and free,
O what a feast for curiosity!
No more shall Masonry, I cried, conceal
Its mysteries; all its secrets I Will unveil.
No more the Fair shall languish; I Will explain
What they all wish to know, and wish in vain.
I said, and clapped my ring upon my finger,
A way I went in haste; I did not linger;
A (...) Brother's back, close as his shade
I (...) and with him my entry made.
The Brethren all were met, a social board:
I saw unterrified the guardian sword.
I saw -- I saw -- and now your ears prepare;
What I then saw I Will publicly declare.
Cleared was my mental eye -- I saw each grace,
And each protecting genius of the place.
Friendship, on wing ethereal, flying round,
Stretched out her arm, and blessed the hallowed ground.
Humanity, well pleased, there took her stand,
Holding her daughter Pity by the hand.
There Charity, which sooths the widow's sigh,
And wipes the dew-drop from the orphan's eye.
There stood Benevolence, whose large embrace
Uncircumscrib'd, took in the human race;
She saw each narrow tie, each private end
Indignant -- Virtue's universal friend,
Scorning each frantic zealot, bigot fool,
She stamped on every breast her golden rule.
And though the doors are barred against you, ye Fair,
Your darling representative was there,
Sweet Modesty -- Amid the moral lay,
To you her tribute did remembrance pay.
I saw each horest heart with transport flow,
I saw each honest cheek with rapture glow.
These little absences I found would prove
But added fuel to the torch of love.
Smit with delight, at once revealed I stood,
And begged admission of the brotherhood.
They kindly heard, and pardoned my offense,
I bartered curiosity for sense.
My magic ring destroyed, reduced to dust,
Taught what was right, and generous, and just.
For Masonry, though hid from prying eyes,
In the broad world admits of no disguise.
PROLOGUE.
YOU HAVE seen me often in gold and ermine dressed,
And wearing short-lived honors on my breast
But now the honorable badge I wear
Gives an indelible high character;
And thus by our Grand Master I am sent,
To tell you what by Masonry is meant.
If all the social virtues of the mind;
If an extensive love to all mankind;
If hospitable welcome to a guest,
And speedy charity to the distressed;
If due regard to liberty and laws,
Zeal for our right, and for our country's cause;
If these are principles deserving fame,
Let MASONS then enjoy the praise they claim.
SONGS.
The MASTER's SONG.
WE sing of MASONS' ancient fame!
Lo, eighty thousand CRAFTSMEN rise,
Under the MASTERS of great name,
More than three thousand just and wise.
Employed by SOLOMON, the fire,
And General Master Mason too,
As HIRAM was in stately Tire,
Like Salem built by Masons true.
The royal art was then divine,
The Craftsmen counseled from above,
The temple was the grand design;
The wondering world did all approve.
Ingenious men from every place
Came to survey the glorious Pile;
And when returned, began to trace
And imitate its lofty style.
At length the GRECIANS came to know
GEOMETRY, and learned the art
PYTHAGORAS was raised to show,
And glorious EUCLID to impart:
Great ARCHIMEDES too appeared,
And Carthaginian Masters bright;
Till Roman citizens uprear'd
The ART with wisdom and delight.
But when proud Aha they had quelled,
And Greece and Egypt overcome,
In Architecture they excelled,
And brought the learning all to Rome:
Where wise VITRUVIUS, Warden prime
Of architects, the art improved
In great AUGUSTUS' peaceful time,
When arts and artists were beloved.
They brought the knowledge from the East,
And as they made the nations yield,
They spread it through the North and West,
And taught the world the art to build.
Witness their Citadels and Towers,
To fortify their legions fine,
Their Temples, Palaces, and Bowers,
That spoke the Masons grand design.
Thus mighty eastern kings, and some
Of ABRAHAM's race, and monarchs good,
Of Egypt, Syria, Greece, and Rome,
True ARCHITECTURE understood.
No wonder then if Masons join
To celebrate those Mason Kings,
With solemn note and flowing WINE
Whilst every Brother jointly sings.
CHORUS.
Who can unfold the royal art,
Or show its secrets in a song?
They Are safely kept in Mason's heart,
And to the ancient Lodge belong!
SONG.
HAIL Masonry, thou craft divine!
Glory of earth, from heaven revealed!
Which does with jewels precious shine,
From all but Masons eyes concealed:
Thy praises due, who can rehearse,
In nervous prose, or flowing verse?
All craftsmen true distingush'd are.
Our code all other laws excel;
And what is in knowledge choice and rare,
Within our breasts securely dwell.
The silent breast, the faithful heart,
Preserve the secrets of the Art.
From scorching heat and piercing cold,
From beasts, whose roars the forest rends;
From the assaults of warriors bold,
The Masons' art mankind defends.
Be to this Art due honor paid,
From which mankind receives such aid.
Ensigns of state that feed our pride,
Distinctions troublesome and vain,
By Masons true are laid aside,
Art's freeborn sons such toys disdain.
Ennobled by the name they bear,
Distinguished by the badge they wear.
Sweet fellowship, from envy sree,
Friendly converse of brotherhood;
The lodge's lasting cement be,
Which has for ages firmly stood.
A lodge thus built for ages past,
Has lasted, and shall ever last.
Then let us celebrate the praise
Of all who have enriched the Art,
Let gratitude our voices raise,
And each true brother bear a part.
Let cheerful strains their same resound,
And living Masons healths go round.
A VALEDICTORY MASONIC SONG,
Composed by ELIHU PHINNEY, Master of the Lodge in Canaan, and sung the last
evening of his meeting in said Lodge.
Tune ARATHUSA.

YE Brothers of fraternal mind,
Whom honor, truth, and justice bind,
In whom the sons of science sind
No sly dissimulation --
Accept a tribute, justly due,
From a fond heart, faithful and true;
Accept my tender, last adieu;
And believe
That I grieve
Your worthy, social band to leave,
Because I am a MASON.
Although remote from you I stray,
Where sickle Fortune leads the way,
Your memory on my breast shall stay
While I have respiration:
And let me hold the fond idea,
That you will mind unworthy me,
Whenever you meet in social glee:
Give a toast --
Let me boast
The friendship of your noble host:
I ask it as a MASON.
If ever the Sirens of the age
Have drawn me from the Mystic Gague,
Pray blot the error from the page
Of rigid observation.
Your kindness on my heart I Will write;
And all unkindness, from my sight,
I Will banish to eternal night.
Let us be
Masons free --
Forgive, likewise forgiven be; --
The creed of every MASON.
Your choicest love I once did share, --
Your brightest badge did often wear, --
Placed in the Oriental Chair
By Mystic Installation;
And, by the emblematic THREE,
Dispensed the gifts of Masonry,
Till the Meridian Orb we see:
Then we may
Wet our clay,
And pass a cheerful hour away
In graleful relaxation.
A listening ear obtains the art, --
A silent tongue will never impart
The secrets of a faithful heart,
Whatever the temptation;
But honor, justice, both combine
To dignify the Grand Design --
And love through all their actions shine;
With a mind
Just and kind;
All their pleasures are refined:
So happy is a MASON.
Their faith's upheld by reason's voice;
Their hope forestalls enjoyments choice;
In charity their hearts rejoice,
And bless each fond occasion:
When unforeseen misfortunes press
The sons or daughters of distress,
With kind, fraternal tenderness,
Prompts relief,
Sooths their grief;
Of their pleasures it is the chief,
To raise a fallen MASON.
Humanity, that virtue bright --
Friendship, so lovely to the sight --
Brotherly-Love their hearts unite
In blessed conciliation:
No doting sot their mirth shall wound --
No minor knows their rites profound --
No atheist treads their hallowed ground;
No alloy
To their joy:
Pleasures pure, which never cloy,
Belong to every MASON.
May friendship, harmony, and love,
Your guardians and companions prove,
Till the Celestial Lodge above
Shall be each Brother's station;
But death, the level -- Time, the line
And plumb of justice, must combine
To fit us for that bliss divine:
Then shall we
Happy be;
Toward the East we'll bow the knee,
To our GRAND MASTER MASON.
The MASON's FAREWELL.
[ Tune of the PEACOCK.]

ADIEU, a heart, fond, warm, adieu
Ye brothers of a mystic tie,
Ye favored and enlight'ned few,
Companions of my social joy.
Though I to foreign lands must hie,
Pursuing fortune's slip'ry ball,
With melting heart and brineful eye,
I Will mind you still when far AWA.
Often have I met your social band,
To spend a cheerful, festive night;
Often honored with supreme command,
Presided over the sons of light,
And by that hyeroglyphic bright,
Which none but craftsmen ever know,
Strong memory on my heart shall write
Those happy scenes, when far AWA.
May freedom, harmony, and love,
Cement you in the grand design;
Beneath the Omniscient Eye above,
The glorious Architect divine.
That you may keep the unerring rule,
Still guided by the plummet's law,
Till order bright completely shine,
Shall be my prayer when far AWA.
And you farewell, whose merits claim
Justly that highest badge to wear;
May heaven bless your noble name,
To Masonry and Scotia dear.
A last request permit me here,
When yearly you assemble a'w,
One round, I ask it with a tear,
To him the friend that is far AWA.
And you kind-hearted sisters fair,
I sing farewell to all your charms,
The impression of your pleasing air,
With rapture often my bosom warms.
Alas! the social winter's night
No more returns while breath we draw,
Till sisters, brothers, all unite
In that GRAND LODGE that is far AWA.
SONG.
[By MATTHEW BIRKHEAD.]
COME let us prepare.
We Brothers that are
Assembled on merry occasion:
Let Us be happy and sing,
For Life is a spring
To a Free and an Accepted Mason.
The world is in pain
Our secrets to gain,
And still let them wonder and gaze on:
They never can divine
The right word or sign
Of a Free and an Accepted Mason.
It Is this and it is that,
They cannot tell what,
Nor why the great men of the nation
should aprons put on,
And make themselves one
With a Free and an Accepted Mason.
Great Kings, Dukes, and Lords,
Have laid by their swords,
Our mist'ry to put a good grace on,
And thought themselves famed
To hear themselves named
With a Free and an Accepted Mason.
Antiquity's pride
We have on our side,
To keep up our old reputation;
There Is naught but what is good
To be understood
By a Free and an Accepted Mason.
We Are true and sincere,
And just to the Fair;
They Will trust us on any occasion:
No mortal can more
The Ladies adore
Than a Free and an Accepted Mason.
Then join hand in hand,
By each Brother firm stand,
Let Us be merry and put a bright face on.
What mortal can boast
So noble a toast
As a Free and an Accepted Mason.
CHORUS.
No mortal can boast 3 times.
So noble a toast 3 times.
As a Free and an Accepted Mason. 3 times.
SONG.
ON, on, my dear brethern, pursue your great lecture,
Refine on the precepts of old architecture;
High honor to masons the craft daily brings,
Who are brothers of princes, and fellows of kings.
We drove the rude Vandals and the Goths of the stage,
Reviving the art of Augustus' sam'd age;
And Vespasian destroyed the vast temple in vain,
Since so many now rise where our principles reign.
The noble five Orders, composed with such art,
Will amaze the fixed eye, and engage the whole heart;
Proportion's sweet harmony gracing the whole,
Give our work, like the glorious creation, a soul.
Then, Master, and brethern, preserve your great name,
This Lodge so majestic will purchase you fame;
Revered it shall stand till all nature expire.
And its glories never fade till the world is on fire.
See, see, behold here, what rewards all our toil,
Invigorates genius, and bids nature smile:
To our noble Grand Master let bumpers be crowned,
To all masons, a bumper, so let it go round.
Again, my loved brethern, again let it pass,
Our ancient firm union cements with the glass:
And all the contention among masons shall be,
Who better can work, or who better agree.
In air he hung the pendent world,
And over it spread the azure skies;
Stars in circles caused to run,
And in the center fixed the Sun.
Then Man he called forth out of dust,
And formed him with a living soul;
All things committed to his trust,
And made him ruler of the whole;
But, ungrateful unto Heaven,
The rebel was from Eden driven.
From thence proceeded all our woes,
Nor could mankind one comfort cheer;
Until Free-masonry arose,
And formed another Eden here;
It Is only on masonic ground,
Pleasure with innocence is found.
It Is here the purest fountain flow,
Here naught corrupt can enter in;
Here trees of knowledge stately grow,
Whose fruit we taste exempt from sin;
In friendship sweet we still abound,
While gaurdian angels hover round.
SONG.
[ Tune, Rule Britannia.]

WHILE trifles lead the world astray,
And vice seduces giddy youth;
Rejoice, my brethern, in this auspicious day,
That guides a steady few to truth:
Raise, raise your voices, ye Kentish Masons all,
It Is SAWBRIDGE rules, obey his call.
Shall Masonry through Britain spread,
And flourish every where but here?
Forbid it, Virtue! while you our footsteps lead
Kent foremost shall in worth appear:
Huzza, my brethern! to SAWBRIDGE raise the song,
Our grateful strains to him belong.
When Harold's crown the Norman gained,
In (...) a hardy race he sound;
(...) to cherish, their ancient (...) unstained,
(...) masonic ground:
True to your duty, your ancestors and land,
Let SAWBRIDGE lead a worthy band.
Away with politics and news,
Away with controversies all;
We Are here united above all party views,
And gladly hail the social call:
Fill, fill your glasses; let SAWBRIDGE be the toast,
Long may we his protection boast!
SONG.
[ Tune, Hearts of Oak.] No sect in the world can with masons compare,
So ancient, so noble the badge is they wear,
That all other Orders however esteemed,
Inferior to masonry justly is deemed.
CHORUS.
We always are free,
And for ever agree;
Supporting each other,
Brother helps Brother,
No mortals on earth are so friendly as we,
When first attic fire mortals glory became,
Though small was the spark, it soon grew to a flame;
As Phoebus celestial transcendently bright
It spreads over the world a fresh torrent of light.
We always, etc.
The greatest of monarchs, the wisest of men,
Free-masonry honored again and again;
And nobles have quitted all other delights,
With joy to preside over our mystical rites.
We always, etc.
Though some may pretend we have no secrets to know,
Such idle opinions their ignorance show;
While others, with raptures, cry out, they are revealed,
In free-mason's bosom's they still lie conceald,
We always, etc.
Coxcomical pedants may say what they can,
Abuse us, ill use us, and laugh at our plan;
We'll temper our mortar, enliven our souls,
And join in full chorus over full flowing bowls.
We always, etc.
SONG.
[ Tune, Goddess of ease.]

GENIUS of masonry descend,
And with thee bring thy spotless train;
Constant our sacred rites attend,
While we adore thy peaceful reign:
Bring with thee Virtue, brightest maid,
Bring Love, bring Truth, and Friendship here;
While social Mirth shall lend her aid,
To smooth the wrinkled brow of care
Come, Charity, with goodness crowned,
Encircled in the heavenly robe,
Diffuse thy blessings all around,
To every corner of the globe:
See where she comes, with power to bless,
With open hand and tender heart,
Which wounded feels at man's distress
And bleeds at every (...)
Envy may every ill devise,
And falsehood be thy deadliest foe,
Thou friendship still shall towering rise,
And sink thine adversaries low:
Thy well built pile shall long endure,
Through rolling years preserve its prime,
Upon a rock it stands secure,
And braves the rude assaults of time.
Ye happy few, who here extend,
In pefect lines, from east to west,
With fervent zeal the Lodge defend,
And lock each secret in each breast:
Since ye are met upon the square,
Bid love and friendship jointly reign,
Be peace and harmony your care,
Nor break the adamantine chain.
Behold the planets how they move,
Yet keep due order as they run;
Then imitate the stars above,
And shine resplendent as the Sun:
That future masons, when they meet,
May all our glorious deeds rehearse,
And say, their fathers were so great,
That they adorned the universe.
SONG.
[ Tune, Arno's Vale.]

WHEN my divine Althea's charms,
No more shall kindle soft alarms,
And the keen lightning of her eye,
Passes unfelt unheeded by;
When moral Beauty's heavenly form
Shall cease the frozen soul to warm;
When manners thus corrupt we see,
Farewell the sweets of Masonry.
When science shall withdraw her light,
And error spread a Gothic night;
When Pity's sacred source is dry,
No pearly doop to melt the eye,
When truth shall hide her blushing head,
And famished virtue beg her bread;
When manners thus corrupt we see,
Farewell the sweets of masonry!
But while the fair transport our sight,
And moral beauty's charms delight;
while science lifts her torch on high,
And pity thaws the melting eye;
While Truth maintains despotic power,
And virtue charms without a dower;
While manners thus unstained we see,
All hail the sweets of Masonry!
SONG.
[ Tune, In infancy, etc.]

LET Masonry, from pole to pole,
Her sacred laws expand,
Far as the mighty waters roll,
To wash remotest land:
That Virtue has not left mankind,
Her social maxims prove,
For stamped upon the mason's mind
Are Unity and Love.
Ascending to her native sky,
Let Masonry increase;
A glorious pillar raised on high,
Integrity its base.
Peace adds to olive boughs, entwined,
An emblematic dove,
As stamped upon the mason's mind
Are Unity and Love.
SONG.
IT IS Masonry unites mankind,
To generous actions forms the soul;
So strict in union we are combined,
One spirit animates the whole.
CHORUS.
Then let mankind our deeds approve,
Since union, harmony, and love
Shall waft us to the realms above.
Wherever aspiring domes arise,
Wherever sacred altars stand,
Those altars blaze up to the skies,
Those domes proclaim the Mason's hand.
The stone unshap'd as lumber lies,
Till Mason's Art its form refines;
So passions do our souls disguise,
Till social virtue calms our minds.
Let wretches at our manhood rail;
But those who once our judgment prove,
Will own, that we who built so well,
With equal energy can love.
Though still our chief concern and care
Be to deserve a Brother's name;
For ever mindful of the fair,
Their choicest favors still we claim
From us pale discord long has fied,
With all her train of mortal spite;
Nor in our Lodge dares show her head,
Sunk in the gloom of endless night.
My Brethern charge your glasses high,
To our Grand Master's noble Name:
Our shouts shall beat the vaulted sky,
And every tongue his praise proclaim.
SONG.
[ Tune, God save the King.]

LET Masons fame resound
Through all the nations round,
From pole to pole:
See what felicity,
Harmless simplicity,
Like electricity,
Runs through the whole.
Such sweet variety
Never had society
Ever before:
Faith, hope, and charity,
Love and sincerity,
Without temerity,
Charm more and more.
When in the Lodge we are met,
And in due order set,
Happy are we:
Our works are glorious,
Deeds meritorious,
Never censorious,
But great and free.
When Folly's sons arise,
Masonry to despise,
Scorn all their spite;
Laugh at their ignorance,
Pity their want of sense,
Never let them give offense,
Firmer unite.
Masons have long been free,
And may they ever be Great as of yore:
For many ages past,
Masonry has stood fast,
And may its glory last
Till time's no more.
SONG.
[ Tune God save the King.]

HAIL MASONRY divine;
Glory of ages shine,
Long may thou reign:
Wherever thy Lodges stand,
May they have great command,
And always grace the land,
Thou Art divine!
Great fabrics still arise,
And grace the azure skies,
Great are thy schemes;
Thy noble Orders are
Matchless beyond compare;
No Art with thee can share,
Thou Art divine.
Hiram, the architect,
Did all the Craft direct
How they should build;
Chorus 3 times. Sol'mon, great Isr'els King,
Did mighty blessings bring,
And left us room to sing,
Hail royal Art!
SONG.
[By Brother NOORTHUCK.]
LET drunkards boast the power of wine,
And reel from side to side;
Let lovers kneel at Beauty's shrine,
The sport of female pride:
Be ours the more exalted part,
To celebrate the mason's Art.
And spread its praises wide.
To dens and thickets dark and rude
For shelter beasts repair;
With sticks and straws the feathered brood
Suspend their nests in air:
And man untaught, as wild as these,
Binds up sad huts with boughs of trees,
And feeds on wretched fare.
But Science dawning in his mind,
The quarry he explores;
Industry and the arts combined
Improved all Nature's stores:
Thus walls were built, and houses reared,
No storms or tempests now are feared
Within his well-fram'd doors.
When stately palaces arise,
When columns grace the hall,
When towers and spires salute the skies,
We owe to masons all:
Nor buildings only do they give,
But teach men how within to live,
And yeal to Reason's call.
All party quarrels they detest,
For Virtue and the Arts,
Lodged in each true Free-mason's breast,
Unite and rule their hearts:
But these, while masons square their minds,
The state no better subjects finds,
None act more upright parts.
When Bucks and Albions are forgot,
Free-masons will remain:
Mushrooms, each day, spring up and rot,
While oaks stretch over the plain;
Let others quarrel, rant and roar;
Their noisy revels when no more,
Still masonry shall reign.
SONG.
YE thrice happy few
Whose hearts have been true,
In concord and unity found;
Let us sing and rejoice,
And unite every voice,
To send the grand chorus around.
CHORUS.
Like pillars we stand,
An immovable band,
Cemented by power from above;
Then freely let pass
The generous glass
To Masonry, Friendship, and Love.
The GRAND ARCHITECT,
Whose word did erect
Eternity, measure, and space,
First laid the fair plan
Whereon he began
The cement of friendship and peace.
Whose firmness of hearts,
Fair treasure of arts,
To the eye of the vulger unknown;
Whose luster can beam
New splendour and same
To the pulpit, the bar, and the throne.
The great David's son,
Unmatched Solomon,
As written in Scripture's bright page,
A Mason became,
The favorite of Fame,
The wonder and pride of his age.
Indissoluble bands
Our hearts and our hands
In social benevolence bind;
For true to his cause,
By immutable laws,
A Mason's a friend to mankind,
Let joy flow around,
And peace, olive bound,
Preside at our mystical rites;
Whose conduct maintains
Our auspicious domains,
And Freedom with order unites.
Nor let the dear maid
Our mysteries dread,
Or think them repugnant to love;
To beauty we bend,
Her empire defend,
An empire derived from above.
Then let us unite,
Sincere and upright,
On the level of virtue to stand:
No mortal can be
So happy as we
With a brother and friend in each hand.
SONG.
When a lodge of Free-masons are clothed in their aprons,
In order to make a new brother,
With firm hearts and clean hands, they repair to their stands,
And justly support one another.
Trusty brother, take care, of eve-droppers beware,
It Is a just and a solemn occasion;
Give the Word and the Blow, that workmen may know,
There Is one asks to be made a Freemason
The Master stands due and his officers too,
While the craftsmen are plying their station;
The apprentices stand, right for the command
Of a Free and an Accepted Mason.
Now traverse your ground, as in duty you're bound,
And revere the authentic oration,
That leads to the way, and proves the first ray
Of the light of an Accepted Mason.
Here Is Words, and here Signs, and here is Problems and Lines,
And here is room too for deep speculation;
Here Virtue and Truth are taught to the Youth,
When first he is called up to a Mason.
Hieroglyphics shine bright, and here light reverts light
On the rules and the tools of vocation,
We work and we sing, the Craft and the king,
It Is both duty and choice in a Mason.
What is said or is done, is here truly laid down
In this form of our high installation;
Yet I challenge all men to know what I mean,
Unless he is an Accepted Mason.
The Ladies claim right to come into our light,
Since the apron, they say, is their bearing,
Can they subject their will, can they keep their tongues still,
And let talking be changed into hearing?
This difficult task is the least we can ask,
To secure us on sundry occasions;
When with this they comply, our utmost we'll try
To raise lodges for lady Free-masons.
Till this can be done, must each brother be mum,
Though the fair-one should wheedle and teaze on;
Be just, true, and kind, but still bear in mind,
At all times that you are a Free-mason.
SONG.
HOW happy a Mason whose bosom still glows
With friendship, and ever most cheerfully goes,
The effects of the mysteries lodged in his breast,
Mysteries revered, and by Princes possessed.
Our friends and our bottle we best can enjoy,
No rancour or envy our quiet annoy,
Our plumbline and compass, our square and our tools,
Direct all our actions in Virtue's fair rules,
Direct all our actions, etc.
To Mars and to Venus we are equally true,
Our hearts can enliven, our arms can subdue;
Let the enemy tell, and the ladies declare,
No class or profession with Masons compare;
To give a fond luster we never need a crest,
Since honor and virtue remain in our breast.
We'll charm the rude world when we clap, laugh, and sing,
If so happy a mason, say who'd be a king;
SONG.
[On the revival of Masonry.]
[ Tune, Vicar of Bray.]

WHEN Masonry expiring lay,
By knaves and fools rejected,
Without one hope one cheering ray,
By worthless sons neglected;
Fair virtue fled,
Truth hung her head,
Overwhelmed in deep confusion,
Sweet Friendship too,
Her smiles withdrew,
From this blessed Institution.
Cho. Fair Virtue fled, etc.
Columbia's sons determined then
Free-masonry to cherish,
They roused her into life again.
And bid fair Science flourish.
Now Virtue bright,
Truth robbed in white,
With Friendship hither hastens,
All go in hand,
To bless the band,
Of true Columbian Masons.
Cho. Now virtue bright, etc.
Since Masonry's revived once more,
Pursue her wise directions,
Let circumspection go be before,
And Virtue square your actions;
Unite your hands
In Friendships bands,
Supporting one another;
With honest heart,
Fair Truth impart,
To every faithful brother.
Cho. Unite your hands, etc.
Let coxcombs grin, and critics sneer,
While we are blithe and jolly,
Let fops despise the badge we wear,
We laugh at all their folly;
Let empty fools
Despise our rules,
Brothers we never will heed 'em,
Say what they will,
We Are Masons still,
And will support our freedom.
Cho. Let empty fools, etc.
But may kind Heaven's gracious hand,
Still regulate each action;
May every lodge securely stand,
Against the storms of faction;
May Love and Peace,
Each day increase,
Throughout this happy nation,
May they extend,
Till all shall end,
In one great conflagration.
Cho. May Love and Peace, etc,
SONG.
[ Tune, In Infancy.]

HAIL Masonry! thou sacred art,
Of origin divine!
Kind partner of each social heart,
And favorite of the nine!
By the we are taught our acts to square,
To measure life's short span;
And each infirmity to bear
That Is incident to man.
Cho. By thee we are taught, etc.
Though envy's tongue would blast thy fame
And simple ignorance sneer,
Yet still thy ancient honored name
To each true brother's dear:
Then strike the blow, to charge prepare,
In this we all agree.
May fredom be each Mason's care,
And every mason free.
Cho. Then strike the blow, etc
SONG.
[ Tune, Casino.]

COME ye Masons hither bring
The tuneful pipe and pleasing string,
Exert each voice,
Aloud rejoice,
And make the spacious concave ring:
Let your hearts be blithe and gay,
Joy and mirth let all display,
No stupid care
Shall enter here,
For this is Mason's holiday.
Cho. Let your hearts be, etc.
Friendship here has fixed her seat,
And virtue finds a calm retreat;
Go tell the fool,
It Is wisdom's school,
Where love and honor always meet
Cho. Let your hearts, etc.
Social pleasures here invite,
To fill the soul with sweet delight,
While hand in hand
Our friendly band
In love and harmony unite.
Cho. Let your hearts, etc.
May we often assemble here,
And long the badge of honor wear,
May joy abound
And we be found,
For ever faithful and sincere.
Cho. Let your hearts be, etc.
Take the flowing glass in hand,
And drink unto our Master Grand,
Long may he reign,
The cause maintain,
And Lodges flourish through the land
Cho. Let your hearts, etc.
SONG.
[ Tune, From the east breaks the morn.]

WHILST each poet sings
Of great Princes and Kings,
To no such does my ditty belong:
To no such does my ditty belong:
It Is fredom I praise,
That demands all my lays,
And masonry honors my song:
And masonry honors my song.
Cho. It Is fredom I praise, etc.
Within compass to live
Is a lesson we give,
which none can deny to be true,
Which none, etc.
All our actions to square
To the time we take,
And virtue we ever pursue,
And virtue, etc.
Cho. All our actions to square, etc.
On a level we are,
All true brothers share
The gifts which kind Hheaven bestows
The gifts, etc.
In friendship we dwell;
None but Masons can tell,
The bliss, which from harmony flows
The bliss, etc.
Cho. In friendship we dwell, etc.
In our mystical school,
We must all work by rule,
And our secrets we always conceal;
And our, etc.
Then let us sing and rejoice
And unite every voice,
With fervancy, freedom, and zeal,
With, etc.
Cho. Then let us sing, etc.
Then each fill a glass,
Let the circl'ing toast pass,
And merrily send it around,
And merrily, etc.
Let us masonry hail,
May it ever prevail,
With success may it ever be crowned,
With success, etc.
Cho. Let us masonry hail, etc.
SONG.
[ Tune, Balance a Straw.]

WHEN the Sun from the East first salutes mortal eyes,
And the sky-lark melodiously bids us arise;
With our hearts full of joy, we the summons obey,
Straight repair to our work, and to moisten our clay.
On the trassel our Master draws angles and lines,
There with freedom and fervency forms his designs;
Not a picture on earth is so lovely to view,
All his lines are so perfect, his angles so true.
In the west see the Wardens submissively stand,
The Master to aid, and obey his command;
The intent of his signals we perfectly know,
And we never take offense when he gives us a blow.
In the lodge, sloth and dullness we always avoid,
Fellow-crafts and apprentices all are employed:
Perfect ashlers some finish, some make the rough plain,
All are pleased with their work, and are pleased with their gain.
When my Master I Have served seven years, perhaps more,
Some secrets he will tell me I never knew before;
In my bosom I Will keep them as long as I live,
And pursue the directions his wisdom shall give.
I Will attend to his call both by night and by day,
It is his to command, and it is mine to obey;
Whensoe'er we are met, I Will attend to his nod,
And I Will work till high twelve, then I Will lay down my hod.
SONG.
TO all who Masonry despise,
This counsel I bestow;
Don't ridicule, if you are wise,
A secret you don't know:
Your selves you banter, but not it:
You show your spleen, but not your wit;
With a fa, la, la, etc.
Inspiring Virtue by our rules,
And in ourselves secure:
We have compassion for those fools
Who think our acts impure:
We know from Ignorance proceeds
Such mean opinion of our deeds;
With a fa, la, la, etc.
If Union and Sincerity
Have a pretense to please;
We Brothers of Free-masonry,
Lay, justly, claim to these:
To state disputes we never give birth,
Our motto friendship is, and mirth,
With a fa, la, la, etc.
SONG.
WE have no idle prating,
Of either whig or tory;
But each agrees
To live at ease,
And sing or tell a story.
CHORUS.
Fill to him,
To the brim,
Let it round the table roll:
The divine
Tells us wine
Cheers the body and the soul.
We Are always men of pleasure,
Despising pride and party:
While knaves and fools
Prescribe us rules,
We are sincere and hearty.
Fill to him, etc.
If an Accepted Mason
Should talk of high or low church;
We'll set him down
A shallow crown,
And understand him no church.
Fill to him, etc.
The world is all in darkness,
About us they conjecture;
But little think,
A song and drink,
Succeeds the Mason's lecture.
Fill to him, etc.
SONG.
[ Tune, Young Damon once the happy Swain.]

A MASON's daughter fair and young,
The pride of all the virgin throng,
Thus to her lover said,
Though Damon I your flame approve,
Your actions praise, your person love,
Yet still I Will live a maid.
None shall untie my virgin zone,
But one to whom the secret's known,
Of famed Free-masonry;
In which the great and good combine,
To raise with generous design,
Man to felicity.
The lodge excludes the fop and fool;
The plodding knave and party tool,
That liberty would fell;
The noble, faithful, and the brave,
No golden charms can ever deceive,
In slavery to dwell.
This said, he bowed and went away,
Applied, was made without delay,
Returned to her again;
The fair one granted his request,
Connubial joys their days have blessed,
And may they ever remain.
SONG.
HAIL secret art! by heaven designed
To cultivate and cheer the mind;
Thy secrets are to all unknown,
But Masons just and true alone,
But Masons just and true alone.
CHORUS.
Then let us all their praises sing,
Fellows to peasant, prince, or king,
Fellows to peasant, prince, or king.
From west to east we take our way,
To meet the bright approaching day;
That we to work may go in time,
And up the sacred ladder climb.
And up the, etc.
Then let us all, etc.
Bright rays of glory did inspire,
Our Master great who came from Tire
Still sacred history keeps his name,
Who did the glorious Temple frame.
Who did, etc.
Then let us, etc.
The noble art divinely reared
Uprightly built upon the square;
Encompassed by the powers divine,
Shall stand until the end of time,
Shall stand, etc.
Then let us all, etc.
No human eye thy beauties see,
but Masons truly just and free;
Inspired by each heavenly spark,
Whilst Cowans labor in the dark.
Then let us all, etc.
SONG.
GLORIOUS craft which sires the mind
With sweet harmony and love;
Surely thou were first designed
A foretaste of the joys above.
Pleasures always on thee wait,
Thou reformost Adam's race;
Strength and beauty in thee meet,
Wisdom's radiant in thy face.
Arts and virtues now combine,
Friendship raises cheerful mirth;
All unite to refine
Man from grosser parts of earth.
SONG.
[ Tune, By Jove I Will be free.]

OF all institutions to form well the mind,
And make us to every virtue inclined:
Nous can with the craft of Free-masons compare,
Nor teach us so truly our actions to square;
For it was ordained by our founder's decree,
That we should be loyal, be loving, and free, be loving, and free, etc.
We in harmony, friendship, and unity meet,
And every brother most lovingly greet;
When we see one in distress, we then do imp^^^
Some comfort to cheer and enliven his heart;
Thus always we live, and forever agree.
Resolved to be loyal, most loving, and free, most loving, and free, etc.
By points of good fellowship we still accord,
Observing each Brother's true sign, grip, and word;
Which from our Great Architect was handed down,
And never will to any but Masons be known;
Then here is to our Brethron of every degree,
Who always are loyal, are loving, and free, are loving, and free, etc.
Thus we interchangeably hold one another,
To let mankind see how we are linked to each brother;
No monarch that secret knot can untie,
Nor can prying mortals the reason know why;
For our hearts, like our hands, still united shall be;
Still secret, still loyal, still loving, and free, still loving, and free, etc.
SONG.
YE gracious powers of cheral song,
Attend; inspire your festive throng;
Let harmless mirth, and frolic glee,
Dance sportive at our Jubilce.
We ask no sound of spear or shield,
No trophics of the ensanguin'd field;
Let Hope, let Faith and Charity,
Begin and end our Jubilee.
No savage warrior's scarlet name,
Shall ever defile our roll of fame;
Bur peace, with white robbed train we see,
Presiding at our Jubilee.
The heart that feels for widowed woe,
The tears, for orphans pangs that flow,
The voice which bids distress to flee,
Shall celebrate in Jubilee.
Mercy, with pearly melting eye,
Stern Justice with her sword on high,
Shall both attendant angels be,
To guide, to guard our Jubilee.
Each Brother's soul shall rapturous swell,
Nor sorrow toll our sadd'ning knell;
The voice, the hands, the heart by three,
Shall thrice repeat our Jubilee.
Then call from east to west the world,
The mystic banners are unfurled!
And O! departed ancients, see
From heaven, and bless our Jubilee!
Lo! from his great or little store,
Each Brother flies his mite to pour,
That men may still rejoice to see,
A Mason's lodge a Jubilee.
Then, round the circle, let the glass
Yet in the square, convivial pass;
And when the sun winds over the lea,
Each lass, shall have her Jubilee.
Be this the general, cordial toast,
A wish that never should be lost,
That all the world may Masons be,
And live and love in Jubilee.
SONG.
ONCE I was blind and could not see,
And all was dark around;
But Providence did pity me,
And soon a friend I found;
Through secret paths my friend me led;
Such paths as babblers never tread.
With a fa, la, la, etc.
All stumbling blocks he took away,
That I might walk secure;
And brought me long ever break of day,
To Sol's bright temple door;
Where there we both admittance found,
By power of magic, spells and sound.
The curber of my bold attempt,
Did then my breast alarm;
And hinted I was not exempt,
If rash, from double harm;
Which quickly stopped my rising pride,
And made me trust more to my guide.
In solemn pace I was led up,
And passed through the bright dome,
But soon I was obliged to stop,
Till I myself made known;
Then round an ancient form was bro't,
To obtain the favor that I sought.
With humble posture and due form,
I listened with good will;
And found, instead of noise and storm,
That all was hushed and still;
And soon a heavenly sound did hear,
That quite dispelled all doubt and fear.
The guardian of this mystic charm,
In shining jewels dressed;
Said, that I need to fear no harm,
If faithful was my breast;
For though to rogues he was severe,
No harm an honest man need fear.
Bright wisdom from his awful throne,
Bade darkness to withdraw;
No sooner said, but it was done.
And then -- great things I saw;
But what they were -- I now will not tell,
But safely in my breast shall dwell.
Then round and round me he did tie
An ancient noble charm;
Which future darkness will defy,
And ward of Cowans harm;
Then I returned from whence I came,
Not what I was, but what I am.
Warden's SONG.
MY tongue shall ever run
In praise of WASHINGTON;
With Poetry and Music sound
His fame to all the world around;
And with Geometry in skilful hand,
Due homage pay,
Without delay.
To ADAMS our great Master grand;
He rules the freeborn Sons of Art
By love and friendship, hand and heart.
CHORUS.
Who can rehearse the praise,
In soft poetic lays,
Or solid Prose, of Masons true,
Whose Art transcends the common view?
Their Secrets never to Strangers yet exposed,
Resolved shall be,
By Masons free,
And only to the ancient lodge disclosed;
Because they are kept in masons heart,
By brethren of the royal Art.
Grand Wardens SONG.
LET Masonry be now my theme,
Throughout the globe to spread its fame,
And eternize each worthy Brother's name;
Your praise shall to the skies resound,
In lasting happiness abound,
And with sweet union all your noble deeds be crowned.
Repeat this last line. CHORUS.
Sing then, my muse, to Mason's glory,
Your names are so revered in story,
That all the admiring world do now adore ye.
Let harmony divine inspire
Your souls with love and generous fire,
To copy well wise Solomon your sire;
Knowledge sublime shall fill each heart,
The rules of g'ometry to impart,
While Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, crown the noble art.
Cho. Sing then, my muse, etc.
Let ancient Masons health's go round,
In swelling cups all cares be drowned,
And hearts united amongst the Craft be found;
May everlasting scenes of joy,
Our peaceful hours of bliss employ,
Which Time's all-conqu'ring hand shall never destroy.
Cho. Sing then, my muse, etc.
My brethren thus all cares resign,
Your hearts let glow with thoughts divine,
And veneration show to Solomon's shrine;
Our annual tribute thus we'll pay,
That late posterity shall say,
We Have crowned with joy, this happy, happy day.
Cho. Sing then, my muse, etc.
Secretary's SONG.
YE brethren of the ancient Craft,
Ye favorite sons of Fame;
Let bumpers cheerfully be quaff'd,
To each good Mason's name;
Happy, long happy may he be,
Who lobes and honors Masonry;
With a fa, la, la, etc.
Ye lovely fair, for beauty famed,
Your slaves we wish to be;
Let none for charms like yours be named,
That loves not Masonry;
This truth we ever prove full well,
That Masons never kiss and tell;
With a fa, la, la, etc.
Free-masons, no offenses give,
Let Fame your worth declare;
Within your compass wisely live,
And act upon the square;
May Peace and Friendship ever abound,
And every Mason's health go round;
With a fa, la, la, etc.
Royal Arch SONG.
GOD caused great lights to shine,
Moving in orbs divine,
Which ever shall
Banish all darkness quite,
With such refulgent light,
And from eternal night,
Save ROYALS all.
SANCTUM SANCTORUM,
Triangles -- no more of 'em,
Wisdom's revealed;
Sublimest arts refined,
Excellent arches bind!
No flaw in heart or mind
Shall be concealed.
Few in our numbers are,
Therefore in royal chair,
Honors abound;
We will join hearts and hand,
Whilst truth and virtue stand,
None but the Royal band
Shall circle round.
We will, etc.
Knights Templars SONG.
[ Tune, God save great George.]

GOD bless the Royal band,
Who grace this happy land,
With valiant Knights:
May the united Three,
Of the blessed Trinity,
Cement the unity
Of all great lights.
Twelve once were highly loved,
But one a Judas proved,
Put out his fire:
May Simon haunt all fools,
Who vary from our rules,
May the heads of such tools
Rest high on spires.
No Turk nor Jew we'll fight,
But in Religion's right
Let all be blessed
Poor pilgrims begging we
Will our Jerusalem see,
All steps, sir Knights have ye
Gloriously passed.
Entered, passed, raised, and arched,
And then like princes, marched,
Through rugged ways;
At length great lights we saw,
And poor old Simon too,
Also the word and law,
Glory and praise.
God in his rainbow gave,
Colors which now we have,
Black, red, and blue,
These colors emblems are
Of royal love most rare,
We are in souls sincere.
Just, good, and true.
Sir knights clasp hand in hand,
None but Knight Templars stand
In circle round:
May we all live in love,
And every comfort prove,
May mercy from above
Fall on this ground.
SONG.
LET Masons ever live in love,
Let harmony their blessing prove,
And sacred lodge on earth, the place
Where freedom smiles in every face.
CHORUS.
Live Free-masons, Free-masons live and love,
And show that your types are from above.
CHORUS.
Live Free-masons, Free-masons live and love,
And show that your types are from above.
Behold the world all in amaze,
Each curious eye with transport gaze,
They look, they like, they wish to be,
What none can gain except he is free.
Live Free-masons, etc.
Then let each Brother charge full high,
And let us drink the memory
Of Hiram and king Solomon,
Whose fame has through all ages run.
Live Free-masons, etc.
SONG.
ASSEMBLED and tyl'd, let us social agree,
With the monarch that sits on the threne,
For he charges a glass, and round let it pass,
To celebrate ancient St. John.
Though babblers may prattle in showing their spleen,
Their spite we compare to the drone,
The world is in pain our secrets to gain,
In ignorance let them think on,
For in sweet harmony, in love we'll agree.
To celebrate ancient St. John.
We'll charge, and we'll toast the great WASHINGTON;
We'll remember the wise Solomon,
For his actions were rare, by the compass and square,
Thus celebrate ancient St. John.
Then join hand in hand, in a body firm stand,
Our cares and our troubles be gone,
We'll unite, sing, and laugh, love the ladies, and quaff;
Thus celebrate ancient St. John.
SONG.
[ Tune, Rural Felicity.]

YE dull stupid mortals, give over your conjectures,
Since free masons secrets you never can obtain;
The bible and compass are our directors,
And shall be as long as this world does remain.
Here friendship inviting, here freedom delighting.
Our moments in innocent mirth we employ:
CHORUS.
Come, see, Masons' felicity,
Working and singing with hearts full of joy.
No other society that you can mention,
Which has been, is now, or hereafter shall be,
However so laudable is its intention,
It cannot compare with divine Masonry.
No envy, no quarrels, can here blast our laurels,
No passion our pleasures can ever annoy;
Come, see, etc.
To aid one another we always are ready,
Our rights and our secrets we carefully guard;
The lodge to support, we like pillars are steady,
No Babal confusion our work can retard.
Ye mortals come hither, assemble together,
And taste of those pleasures which never can cloy,
Come, see, etc.
We are to the Master for ever obedient,
Whenever he calls, to the Lodge we repair;
Experience has taught us, that it is most expedient
To live within compass, and act on the square,
Let mutual agreement, be Free-masons' cement,
Until the whole Universe time shall destroy;
Come, see, etc.
SONG.
WHEN Heaven designed that man should know
All that was good and great below;
This was the happy, choice decree,
The blessings of Free-masonry.
Hence peace and friendship deign to smile,
Instructive rules the hours beguile:
In social joy and harmony
Are spent the hours of Masonry.
To beauty's shrine they homage pay,
Its power they know, and own its sway;
And this their toast will always be,
Success to love and Masonry.
Of modern learning, ancient lore,
Masons possess an ample store;
At faction spurn, but loyalty
Congenial is with Masonry.
When taste and genius both combine,
To shape the stone or draw the line;
In fair proportion just and free,
All own the power of Masonry.
Whatever in sculptured skill we prize,
Or domes are reared, or structures rise;
Such wonders never mankind could see,
But from the help of Masonry.
An edifice we are proud to own.
Of wood not made, nor yet of stone;
Whose angles, squares, and symetry,
Are emblems of Free-masonry.
It Is founded on a brother's love,
Relief and truth its pillars prove;
Its corner stone is Charity;
The building's then Free-masonry.
By nature reared, improved by Art,
The mansion view, a Mason's heart,
Which never was equaled, all agree,
When modeled by Free-masonry.
SONG.
Let Masons be merry each night when they meet,
And always each other most lovingly greet,
Let envy and discord be sunk in the deep,
By such as are able great secrets to keep,
Let all the world gaze on our Art with surprise,
They Are all in the dark 'till we open their eyes,
'till we open, etc.
Whoever is know for to act on the square,
And likewise well skilled in our secrets rare,
Are always respected whether wealthy or poor,
And never yet was careless of things that are pure;
For their actions are bright and their lives spent in love,
At length will be happy in the grand lodge above. in the, etc.
We are brothers and fellows to brave WASHINGTON,
Our fame through the world does constantly run,
As we lovingly meet so we lovingly part,
No Mason did even bare malice at heart,
And the fool that is conceited we'll never despise,
Let him come to our lodge and we'll make him more wise, and we'll make, etc.
The SANCTUM SANCTORUM by Masons is framed,
And all the fine works which the Temple contained,
Undivulg'd their own secrets, to you will be sincere;
Which nobody, etc.
SONG.
Tune Greedy Midas.

WITH harmony and flowing wine,
My brethren all come with me join;
To celebrate this happy day,
And to our Master homage pay.
Hail! happy, happy, sacred place,
Where friendship smiles on every face;
And royal art! does fill the chair,
Adorned with his noble square.
Next sing, my muse, our Wardens praise,
With chorus loud in tuneful lays;
Oh! may these columns never decay,
Until the world dissolves away.
My brethren all come join with me,
To sing the praise of Masonry;
The noble, faithful, and the brave,
Whose arts shall live beyond the grave
Let envy hide her shameful face,
Before us ancient sons of peace;
Whose golden precepts still remain,
Free from envy, pride or stain.
SONG.
Tune The Entered 'Prentice.

FROM the depths let us raise
Our voices, and praise
The works of the glorious creation;
And extol the great fame
Of our Maker's great name,
And his love to an Accepted Mason.
In primitive time,
When men, of no crime,
Were saved from that great inundation
Whose Father from on high,
Taught Geometry,
That honored science of a Mason.
In an Ark that was good,
Made of Gopher wood,
And was built by divine ordination;
And the first in his time,
That planted a vine,
Was a Free and an Accepted Mason.
When Pharaoh, the King
Of Egypt, did bring
To bondage our whole generation;
That King got a fall,
And his Magicians all,
By a princely and learned wise Mason.
Then through the Red Sea,
Heaven guided their way,
By two pillars of divine ordination;
And Pharaoh's great train
Were lost in the main,
For pursuing an army of Masons.
When Amalek's King,
Great forces did bring,
Likewise the great Midianite nation;
Those Kings got a fall,
And their great armies all,
And their wealth fell a spoil to those Masons
King Solomon, he
Was known to be free,
Built a holy grand lodge for his nation;
Each beautiful part
Was due to the Art
Of Hiram, the great learned Mason.
They to Jordan did go,
And met their proud foe,
And fought the great Cannanite nation;
Whose gigantic strain,
Could never sustain
The force of an army of Masons.
SONG.
COME fill up a bumper, and let it go round,
Let mirth and good fellowship always abound;
And let the world see,
That Free-masonry,
Does teach honest souls to be jovial and free.
Our lodge now composed of honest free hearts,
Our Master most freely his secrets imparts;
And so we improve,
In knowledge and love,
By help from our mighty Grand-Master above.
Let honor and friendship eternally reign,
Let each brother Mason the truth so maintain;
That all may agree,
That Free-masonry,
Does teach honest souls to be jovial and free.
In Mirth and good fellowship we will agree,
For none are more blessed or more happy than we;
And thus we'll endure,
While our actions are pure
Kind heaven those blessings to us does insure.
SONG.
WHEN Masonry, by heaven's design,
Did enter first into Hiram's brain,
A Choir of Angles did rejoice,
And this Chorus sung with united voice,
CHORUS.
Hail! you happy, happy sons that be
Brothers in Free-masonry.
Great Hiram he did then repair,
And went to work with rule and square,
With plumb and level, to his eternal fame,
He did the glorious Temple frame,
Hail! you happy, etc.
When Solomon beheld the same,
He then set forth great Hiram's fame:
Oh! excellent Mason! he in surprise did say,
Above all Arts you bear the sway,
Hail! you happy, etc.
Now to great Hirams memory
Let Us fill a glass most cheerfully,
St. John (including) who the light did bring,
And great WASHINGTON'S praises ring,
Hail! you happy, etc.
Next charge unto our Master Grand,
And to each lovely fair one round the land,
Ourselves including, so let the health go round
And may we ever true be found,
Hail! you happy, etc.
A NEW SONG,
ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF MASONRY IN VERMONT -- BY A BROTHER IN THAT STATE.
Tune, MUTUAL LOVE.

AS Masons once on Shinar's plain,
Met to revive their arts again,
Did mutually agree;
Did mutually agree.
So now in Vermont we design,
To raise the noble art divine,
To ancient purity;
To ancient purity.
The Masons in this happy land,
Have now united in a band,
And a Grand Lodge have made;
And a Grand Lodge have made.
Green Mountain Brothers by a sign,
Like Salem's Sons each other join,
And Masonry have spread;
And Masonry have spread.
Thrice happy, blessed Fraternity,
Whose basis is sweet unity:
So may it ever be;
So may it ever be.
Fill to the noble happy band,
Who have supported in this land,
Upright Free-masonry;
Upright Free-masonry;
And may our Lodge forever be,
An honor to Free-masonry;
Well skilled in secrets rare;
Well skilled in secrets rare.
Health to our noble Master Grand --
Let Brother by each Brother stand:
A health to all the Fair;
A health to all the Fair.
PROLOGUE.
A PROLOGUE spoken before a Play which had been commanded by an Encampment of
KNIGHTS TEMPLARS.
Written by a BROTHER.
SEE -- here are men, who are bound by ties to tread
In honor's paths; -- by obligations led
To serve the fair; to dry the Orphan's tears,
The widow's pleas; and dissipate their fears;
To wield our swords in Christian's sacred came;
To vanquish Turks, and trample on their laws;
To pass our lives in righteousness and truth,
To serve our brethern, and instruct our youth.
Poor CYMON too, we awfully revere, --
Are strangers to servility and fear;
Knights of an ancient order! -- doomed to trace
The sacred rules of all EMMANUEL'S Race;
A Judas never encouragement can find
Among a band, where three in one must bind,
Who Are ever mindful of that dreadful day,
When fleeting souls resume their pristine clay:
Memento mori -- Cloud-cap'd Towers fall,
And universal Chaos buries all.
This institution -- ancient in its kind,
I Fethard, in the county of Tipperary, was the first Town in Ireland, where
Knights Templars were made.
Fethard first was polished and refined;
Why not? -- When beauties such as ye inspire
Our gallant Knights, and set their souls on fire;
In lovely order, -- see the polished rows,
Their friendship for the Royal Craft disclose;
The secret faithful Craft -- who joys can feel,
Nor cry they roast-meat -- fare they ever so well.
May such for ever be the ladies choice,
Free from deceit -- and free from every vice;
And more (ye fair) than all your slave has said,
You're sure that men will grace your nuptual bed;
No wan Italians, -- no pale fribbles we,
But flesh and blood, brave, honest, frank and free.
EPILOGUES.
EPILOGUE.
WITH what malicious joy, ever I knew better,
Have I been wont the Masons to bespatter?
How greedily have I believed each lie,
Contrived against that famed society?
With many more complained -- 'twas very hard,
Women should from their secrets be debarred.
When kings and statesmen to our sex reveal
Important business which they should conceal,
That beauteous ladies by their sparks adored,
Never could wheedle out the Masons word;
And often their favors have bestowed in vain,
Nor could one secret for another gain:
I thought, unable to explain the matter,
Each Mason sure must be a womanhater:
With sudden fear and dismal horror struck,
I heard my spouse was to subscribe the book:
By all our loves I begged he would forbear;
Upon my knees I wept and toar my hair:
But when I found him fixed, how I behaved,
I thought him lost, and like a fury raved,
Believed he would forever be undone
By some strange opperation under^^^^.
When he came back I found a change, it is true,
But such a change as did his youth renew:
With rosy cheeks and smiling grace he came,
And sparkling eyes that spoke a bridegroom's flame.
Ye married ladies, it is a happy life,
Believe me, that of a Free-mason's wise.
Though they conceal the secrets of their friends,
In love and truth they make us full amends,
EPILOGUE.
WELL, here I Am come to let you know my thoughts;
Nay ben't alarmed, I Will not attack your faults;
Alike be safe the cuckold and the wit,
The cuckold-maker and the solemn cit,
I Am in good humor, and am come to prattle,
Ha'nt I a head well turned, do you think, to rattle?
But to clear up the point and to be free,
What think you is my subject? MASONRY!
Though I Am afraid, as lawyers cases clear,
My learned debate will keep you as you were;
But I Am a woman -- and when I say that,
You know we'll talk although we know not what;
What think you, ladies, an't very hard
That we should from this secret be debarred?
How comes it that the softer hour of love,
To wheedle out this secret, fruitless prove?
For we can wheedle when we hope to move.
What can it mean, why all this mighty pother,
These mystic signs, and solemn calling, BROTHER?
That we are qualified in signs, are known,
We can keep secrets too, but they are our own.
When my good man went first to be a Mason,
Though I resolved to put the smoother face on:
Yet to speak truly, I began to fear
He must some dreadful operation bear;
But he returned to satisfy each doubt,
And brought home every thing he carried out:
Nay, came improved, for on his face appeared
A plealing smile that every scruple cleared
Such adding complaisance so much good nature,
So much, so strangely altered for the petter!
That to increase the mutual dear delight
Would be were a Mason every night.
TOASTS.
OUR right worshipful Grand Master.
All Grand Lodges throughout the globe.

Prosperity to the ancient and honorable Craft.
