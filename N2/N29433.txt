At a General Court Held at Boston the 11th. of October. 1675.
WHereas it has pleased our gracious God, contrary to the many
evill-deservings of an unworthy and sinful People such as we are, so far to
espouse the interest of his poor people, as to plead their Cause with the
Heathen in this Wilderness, that have risen up against us, and broken in upon
many of our Towns and places as a (...), seeking the utter extirpation and
ruin of the interest of our Lord Jesus, in the Wilderness, and that with so
considerable a progress, and such strange success, as ought not soon to be
forgotten by us: in this day of our calamity, God has made bare his own Arm
for our Deliverance, by taking away courage and Counsel from our enemies, and
giving strange advantages and great success to our selves and Confederates
against them, that of those several Tribes and Parties that have risen up
against us, which were not a few, there now scarce remains a Name or Family of
them in their former habitations; but are either slain, captivated or fled into
remote parts of this wilderness, or lie hid despairing of their first
intentions against us, at least in these parts: unto which mercy, God has
added an abatement of those Epidemical Sicknesses that have attended us most
part of this Summer, and vouchsafed us a liberal portion of the fruits of the
earth, for our comfortable sustentation and Relief: The joint consideration of
these things ministers great cause, and the same God that is Author of them,
can give us hearts to offer our Praise that thereby we may glorify him. Which
that we may obtain,

THis Court does appoint and set apart the ninth day of November next to be a
Day of solemn Thanksgiving and Praise to God for such his singular and Fatherly
Mercyes bestowed on us: and do commend the same to the respective Elders,
Ministers and People of this Jurisdiction, solemnly and seriously to keep the
same.

By the COURT, Edward Rawson Secr'.
