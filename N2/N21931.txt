PREFACE.
TO blazon forth a studied preface in praise of any publication, is, at best,
but a genteel infult to the judgment of the reader. -- That the present work is
entirely perfect, is what the auther neither believes himself, nor expects
others to believe; he flatters himself however, that it is as free fram errors
as could reasonably be expected. -- The Reduction of Coins and Currencies,
which is original, is, no doubt, open to improvement; though no pains have been
spared to render that part of the work worthy the approbation of the public. --
It would be proper to mention, that crowns of France and England, are
calculated at 111 cents each; but that since the calculation was made, they
have been fixed at 110 -- this is the only known inaccuracy (if it may be
termed one) contained in the work, and extends no further than the reduction of
crowns into federal money, and vice versa; for in all other cases, the crown is
calculated at its nominal value of five shillings sterling, unless where
otherwise regulated by law; to say more would be superfl^us -- the work is in
the reader's hand, and he must judge for himself independent of the

AUTHOR.

EXPLANATION OF CHARACTERS MADE USE OF IN CERTAIN CASES FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY.
= THE sign or mark of equation, or equal to de^^ting that the two numbers
between which it is placed, are equal to each other, as one dollar=8 s. that
is, one dollar is equal to 8 shillings.

+ This is called plus, and signifies more, or an addition, as 3 + 3 = 6, that
is, three having three added thereto, is equal to six.

- Minus, or lose, denotes that the latter of the two numbers between which it
stands, is subtracted from the former, as 4 - 2 = 2, or four having two
subtracted therefrom, are equal to two.

x This character is the sign of multiplication, and shows that the numbers
between which it stands are multiplied by each other, as 3 x 3 = 9, meaning,
that three multiplid by three are equal to nine.

This character denotes division, and shows that the former of the two numbers
between which it stands, is divided by the latter; as, 9 / 3 = 3, that is, nine
divided by three, produces or is equal to three.

Denoting, so is, is the sign of a geometrical progression, or increase, and is
placed between the second and third terms of four proportional numbers, thus, 4
8 12 24 -- or, as 4 are to 8, so are 12 to 24 -- as in the rule of three.

OF REDUCTION.
REDUCTION consists of two distinct rules; the one called Reduction Descending,
that is, when a great denomination is to be reduced to the standard of a
smaller one, as dollars into cents, cents into mills, etc. and is wrought by
multiplication; always taking care to multiply by as many as there are of the
smaller denomination contained in one of the greater; as dollars to be reduced
into cents, must be multiplied by 100; cents into mills, by 10, etc. taking
care to bring in the parts, that is, the cents when reducing dollars, and the
mills when reducing cents.

The other is called Reduction Ascending, being wrought by division, and made
use of to determine how many of a great denomination, as dollars, are contained
in a given number of a smaller one, as cents, or mills, and must be wrought
exactly contrary to Reduction Descending.

REDUCTION DESCENDING.
1. REDUCE 4832 feet 6 inches, into inches and tenths of an inch.

4832 -- 6 12 -- 57990,0

Here I multiply by 12, there being 12 inches in a foot, bringing in the inches
and making the the product 57,990, the number of inches; then annexing a cipher
to the units' place, reduces the whole to tenths of an inch without multiplying
by ten, and the point placed between the unit and the ten, shows those on the
left to be inches, and the whole together, tenths of an inch.

2. Reduce ^94 feet, 123 inches superficial measure, into inches.

794 -- 123 144 -- 3179 3178 795 -- 114459 inches.

DESCENDING.
3. Reduce 427 dollars, into cents. 427,00

When any number is to be multiplied by ten, annex one cipher to the units'
place; if by 100, annex two ciphers, etc. as in this case.

4. Reduce 425 pounds, into farthings. Ans. 408000.

5. Reduce 760 yards, into feet and inches. Ans. 2280 feet -- 27,360 inches.

6. Reduce 4321 gallons, into gills. Ans. 138,272.

7. There is a certain floor 124 feet long, and 65 wide; how many square feet
and square inches does it contain? Ans. 8,092 feet -- 1,165,320 inches.

RULE.
Multiply the length by the breadth, and that will give the square feet; the
product being multiplied by 144, gives the inches.

8. In 492 miles, how many inches, when 1760 yards make a mile? -- Answer,
31,173,120 inches.

9. In 432 crowns, at 8 s10 d. how many farthings? Answer, 183,168.

10. In 50 cwt. how many ounces? -- Ans. 89,600.

REDUCTION ASCENDING.
THIS rule, as already mentioned, is wrought exactly contrary to reduction
descending; that is, where the one is multiplied, the other must be divided, so
that they prove each other.

1. In 579,900 tenths of an inch, how many feet? Ans. feet, 12)57990 0 -- 4,832
-- 6 inches.

2. In 114,459 square inches, how many superficial feet? Ans. 794 feet, 123
inches.

3. In 42,700 cents, how many dollars? -- Ans. 427.

4. In 408,000 farthings, how many pounds? -- Ans. 425.

ASCENDING.
5. In 27,360 inches, how many yards? -- Ans. 760.

6. In 138,272 gills, how many gallons? -- Ans. 4321.

7. In 1,165,320 inches, how many square feet? Also, how long, will that square
be which is composed of them when it is 65 feet in breadth? Answer, 8092 square
feet -- 124 feet, the length of the square.

8. In 183,168 farthings, how many crowns at 8 s. 10 d. each? Ans. 432.

9. In 31,173,120 inches, how many miles? Ans. 492.

10. In 89,600 ounces, how many hundred weight? Ans. 50.

Reduction Descending and Ascending.
REDUCTION Descending and Ascending, is, when a number of one denomination, as
crowns is given, requiring the quantity or number that will bear the same value
in two or more other denominations, as cents and dollars; so that it must first
be reduced to the standard of the lowest denomination mentioned, and then
elevated to that of the other, and is wrought first by multiplying and then by
dividing, so as to correspond with the different denominations into which it is
to be reduced, as follows:

1. In 792 crowns, how many cents and dollars, a crown being 111 cents?

792 111/8712 792/879 12

Ans. 87,912 cents -- 879 12/100 dollars.

Here the given number of crowns being multiplied by 111, gives the number of
cents, and the two right hand figures being cut off, gives that of the dollars
-- the two figures thus cut off being cents.

2. In 763 poles or perches, how many feet and yards?

763 16 -- 4578 763 381 -- 3) 12589 feet. -- 4196 yards.

DESCENDING AND ASCENDING.
3. In 280 pence, how many farthings and three-pences? Ans. 1120 farthings --
93 three-pences.

4. In 67 degrees, how many miles and leagues, reckoning 69 miles to a degree?
Ans. 4656 miles -- 1552 leagues.

5. In 672 lb. avordupois weight, how many ounces and half-pounds? Ans. 10752
ounces -- 1344 half-pounds.

6. In 430 out. how many lb. and qrs. Ans. 48,160 lb. 1720 qrs.

TARE AND TRETT.
BY Tare isto be understood the weight of any barrel, bail, etc. containing
certain goods, and is to be deducted from the joint weight of the goods and
vessel, which is called the gross weight. When the tare is subtracted from the
gross weight, the remainder is called subtle weight.

Trett is an allowance of one twenty-sixth part of the subtle weight of some
particular goods, and is made for the dust, etc. which may be among them.

There is another allowance made to the citizens of London, of two pounds upon
every draught of or above 3 cwt. of some sorts of goods, as madder, sumac, etc.
and is not made at any other place: this is called cloff.

But as my business is to make calculations agreeable to the standard of the
United States, and more especially of this state, rather than to that of
London, I shall endeavor to make as accurate an one as can conveniently be;
observing at the same time, that the tare is so uncertain that nothing better
than a rough calculation can be expected.

But here I would have the reader reflect, that, as the object of this system
is to lay down the principles of working certain rules, rather than an accurate
representation of customs, a few pounds more or less tare will make no manner
of difference to the learner; for if he can find the tare at five per cent, he
can also find it at 7 per cent, or any other given rate.

I have been informed that the allowance of trett is entirely out of practice
at present; but least it should not be so, I shall state a few questions in
which both tare and trett are to be allowed.

In the following table I have endeavored to specify those articles on which
tare is allowed, and to come as near the usual allowance as I have it in my
power.

A TABLE OF TARE.
Articles. How Imported. From whence. Gross-weight. Tare. Sugars, In barrels,
hogsheads and boxes, West Indies, Various wts. Tare marked, or 12 per cent.
Rice, In tierces, Carol. and Geor. Various do. Marked, or 10 per cent. Ginger,
In kegs, West Indies, From 80 to 100 lb. From 12 to 16 lb. Tea, In chests, From
China, 50 to 100 lb. From 14 to 20 lb. Soap and Candles, In boxes, 60 to 100
lb. From 12 to 16 lb. Tobacco, In hogsheads, Virginia, 9 to 15 cwt. Tare always
marked. Nails, In casks, England, Tare uncertain. Paints, etc. In kegs and
casks Ditto, Tare marked.

Note -- By per cent. is meant 100 lbs. and not a gross hundred weight.

TARE AND TRETT.
1. IN 104 hogsheads of sugar, weighing 9 cwt. 2 qrs. 14 lb. each, tare per
hhd. 1 cwt. 0 qrs. 14 lb. how much nett?

8) 104 13 9 5 -- 936 65 -- 1001 cwt. gross. 117. -- 884 cwt. nett. 8)104 13 --
117 tare. --

Here I multiply by 9, making a product of 936. I then find that 2 qrs. and 14
lb. are of a hundred weight; then dividing the given number by 8, I find the
quotient to be 13, which I set at the right hand of the other work, and
multiply by 5, which gives the required, carrying the product under the 936,
and adding them together, the gross weight is found to be 1001 cwt. then to 104
add one-eighth of itself, and you have the tare in cwts. which being subtracted
from the gross weight, leaves the nett, viz. 884 cwt. This sum may be done by a
shorter method than the above, viz. take one hogshead, and deduct the tare,
multiplying the given number of hogsheads by the number of hundreds-weight
contained in one, as follows: c. qrs. lb. One hogshead gross, 9 2 14 hhds, -
Tare, 1 0 14 104 -- 8 8 2 0 nett. -- 832 52 -- 884 cwt. nett.

The most common method of working sums of this kind, is as follows, but it
being much longer, I think best to take one of the above rules whenever the
tare is so proportioned to the gross or nett weight, as to allow it.

9 - 2 - 14 1 - 0 - 14 112112 gross. 4 4 13104 tare. -- -- -- 38 4
112)99008(884 cwt. nt 28 28 896 -- -- -- 308 36 940 77 9 896 -- -- -- 1078 126
448 104 104 448 -- -- 4312 504 10780 1260 -- -- 112112 gross. 13104

2. In 24 tierces of rice, each weighing 7 out. 0 qrs. 7 lb. tare as follows: 8
tare 3 qrs. 8 tare 3 qrs. 7 lb. and 8 tare 3 qrs. 14 lb. how many nett hundreds
weight? Ans. 150.

3. In 672 chests of tea, each weighing 78, tare 15 lb. how many pounds?

2)672,0 672 3360 78 -- 10080 tare. 5376 4704 -- 52416 gross lbs. 10080 --
42336 nett lbs.

In this case the tare being 15 lb. per chest, I take the given number of
chests, and annex a cipher to the units' place, which gives the tare at 10 lb.
then taking one half of that number, and adding them together, gives the
complete tare at 15 lb. per chest; which being deducted from the gross weight,
shows the nett weight required.

4. In 624 boxes of goods, weighing 224 lb. each, tare 92 lb. how many nett
pounds? Ans. 82,368 lbs.

5. In 75 hogsheads of tobacco, each weighing 9 cwt. 2 qrs. 21 lb. tare 1 c. 1
qr. 7 lb. how much nett weight?

TARE AND TRETT.
2 qrs. 75 9 -- 675 14 lb. 37 - 2 7 lb. 9 - 1 - 14 4 - 2 - 21 -- 726 - 2 - 7
gross. 98 - 1 - 21 tare. -- 628 - 0 - 14 lb. nett. 1 qr. 75 7 lb. 18 - 3 4 - 2
- 21 -- 98 - 1 - 21

Here I multiply the number of hogsheads by the given number of cwts. and take
the parts for the 2 qrs. and 21 lb. saying 2 qrs. is one half of a cwt.
dividing the top line by 2; then 14 lb. is the fourth of 2 qrs. dividing the
lower line, and lastly, 7 lb. is the half of 14 lb. dividing the last quotient
and adding all together, I find the gross weight.

The same method is pursued respecting the tare, which finally being subtracted
from the gross weight, leaves the nett weight required.

To deduct tare and trett both, the tare being subtracted, divide the remainder
by 26, and subtract the quotient from the subtle weight.

6. In 240 boxes of goods, each weighing 794 lb. tare 82 lb. trett 4 lb. per
hundred and four pound, how much nett weight?

240 240 82 794 -- -- 480 960 1920 2160 -- 1680 19680 lb. tare. -- 190560
gross. 19680 -- 170880 subtle. Deduct one 26th for trett 6572 8/26 -- lbs. nett
with. 164307 18/26

OF FRACTIONS GENERALLY.
A FRACTION is a certain part or parts of a whole number, as three-fourths of
one shilling, and are marked thus, the lower number being called the
denominator, because it determines the term or denomination of the fraction, as
fourths, tenths, etc. and denotes that a whole number consists of so many equal
parts. The upper number is called the numerator, both because it is always
mentioned first in calling fractions, as 7/10 etc. and also because it shows
the fraction which it represents to consist of so many parts of a whole number,
as 3 set over 4, denotes the fraction to consist of 3 of the four equal parts
into which a whole number is divided and is called three fourths.

There are also fractions of fractions, as of of of a pound, dollar, etc. When
whole numbers and fractions happen together, they are called surd or mixed
numbers, as 3 6 7/9 that is, three and five eights, six and seven ninths, etc.

Fractions are generally divided into vulgars and decimals. A vulgar fraction
being a certain part or proportion of a whole number, as 7/9 etc.

A decimal fraction is always regulated by tens, hundreds, etc. that is, every
fraction, if consisting of one figure only, has ten for its denominator,
without the denominator being placed under it, as is the case in vulgar
fractions. Instead of this, there is a dot placed on the left hand of the
fraction, thus.9 denoting it to be nine-tenths of a whole number. If the
fraction consists of two or more figures, the denominator is increased in
proportion, as.64 or 64/100.432 or 432/1000 and so on to as many figures as may
occur.

When surd numbers are to be expressed in decimals, the dot is placed between
the whole numbers and the fractions, as, 5.6, or five and six tenths; 42.74, or
forty-two and seventy-four hundredths, etc. If a cipher, or ciphers, should
present themselves at the right hand of the decimals, they ought to be cut off,
each cipher so cut off, lessening the denominator one tenth, as,.240 cutting
off the cipher will leave the fraction.24 or twenty-four hundreths; and this is
all the method there is of reducing decimal fractions to their lowest terms;
for if they will not admit of this, or rather if there is no cipher in the
units' place, the fraction is at its lowest term in decimals already.

One reason why I have put fractions before the rule of three, is the extensive
use of them, for scarcely any, the most common question in Arithmetic, can be
precisely answered without a partial knowledge of them at least.

Another reason is, that I propose in the course of this work to lay down a
complete system of Reduction, to be applied to coins and currencies, and it is
next to an impossibility for a person to understand why such or such
proportions are made use of, unless he knows from whence they were taken, and
this he will know nothing about if he has not a tolerable idea of fractions.

VULGAR FRACTIONS.
CASE I.

To reduce fractions of various denominations, as and to a common denomination.

RULE.

1. MULTIPLY all the denominators into each other, for a new denominator.

2. Multiply each numerator into all the denominators except its own, for a new
numerator.

EXAMPLE.

1. Reduce and to a common denominator. 3/6 + 4/6 = 7/6 = 1.

Here the two denominators being multiplied together, produce 6 as the common
denominator; and each numerator being multiplied by the contrary denominator,
causes the fraction to stand as above, that is, 3 sixths and 4 sixths. I then
put the sign of addition between the 3 and the four, denoting that they are
added together, and the sign of equation to the right of the four, showing that
when added together they are equal to seven sixths; the seven being then
divided by 6, the denominator, the fraction, is finally found to be one whole
number and a sixth.

2. Reduce 3/6 and to a common denominator. 54/48 or 1 6/48 Answ.

CASE II.

To reduce a fraction to its lowest terms.

This is in order to show how low each part of the fraction may be reduced and
still be in the same proportion to each other, as when in larger numbers, as
18/27 may be reduced until it becomes and yet not vary the proportions. It is
also much easier working with small fractions than with large ones, which makes
this case very necessary.

RULE.

Divide the greater by the lesser of the two numbers, and the lesser by the
remainder, and so on until nothing remains -- the last divisor is the common
measure, by which (if it is not one) divide both parts of the fraction; the
quotients will be the fraction required -- if one is the common measure, the
fraction is already at its lowest terms.

In this case, in order to get the first and third number, of one denomination,
I multiply 6 by 12, calling the, 3/12, which is its exact value.

I have not inserted the Double Rule of Three in Vulgar Fractions in this work
as it is a rule that seldom occurs.

DECIMAL FRACTIONS.
IN order to discribe a Decimal Fraction, I shall quote a few lines from page
19, where I have had occasion to hint at them already.

"A decimal fraction is always regulated by tens, hundreds, etc. that is, every
fraction, if consisting of one figure only, has ten for its denominator,
without the denominator being placed under it, as is the case in vulgar
fractions. Instead of this, there is a dot placed on the left hand of the
fraction, thus.9 denoting it to be nine-tenths of a whole number. If the
fraction consists of two or more figures, the denominator is increased in
proportion, as.64 01 94/100.432 or (...). and so on to as many figures as may
occur.

"When surd numbers are to be expressed in decimals, the dot is placed between
the whole numbers and the fractions, as, 5.6, or five and six tenths; 42.74, or
forty-two and seventy-four hundredths, etc. If a expher, or ^^phers, should
present themselves at the right hand of the decimals, they ought to be cut off,
each cipher so cut off, lessening the denominator one tenth, as,.240 cutting
off the cipher will leave the fraction.24 or twenty-four hundreths; and this is
all the method there is of reducing decimal fractions to their lowest terms;
for if they will not admit of this, or rather if there is no cipher in the
units' place, the fraction is at its lowest term in decimals already."

The following is a scale, showing the increase both of whole numbers and
decimals.

8 Millions, 7 Hundreds of thousands, 2 Tens of thousands, 3 Thousands, 3
Hundreds, 4 Tens, 6 Units,.9 Tenth parts, 8 Hundredth parts, 5 Thousandth
parts, 6 Ten thousandth parts, 4 Hundred thousandt parts. etc.

The above table is to be read as follows: eight million, seven hundred and
twenty-three thousand, three hundred and forty-six, and ninety-eight thousand,
five hundred, and sixty-four, hundred thousandth parts of a whole number.

Though this table comprehends no smaller parts of a whole number, than hundred
thousandths, yet the decimal may be continued to a thousand figures, if
necessary, or even to infinity.

REDUCTION OF DECIMALS.
RULE.

ANNEX a convenient number of ciphers to the right hand of the numerator of any
given vulgar fraction, and divide by the denominator, cutting off all the
ciphers in the right of the quotient.

5. Reduce 12/54 to its term in decimals. -- Ans..222222+

6. Reduce 6/11 to its term in decimals. -- Ans..545454+

When the remainder is nearly equal to the dividend, in reducing dicimals, it
is sometimes necessary, in order to shorten the work, to raise the fraction one
term, upon the fourth, fifth, or sixth figure from the left, that is, if the
decimal is.43257 28/32, etc. reject the remainder, and call the seven, eight;
this will make scarcely any difference in the result, and will be of service if
the decimals are to be wrought by multiplication, etc.

To reduce a given decimal, to its proper quantity.
RULE.

Suppose.45 of a pound, New York currency, be given to find its proper quantity.

Multiply the given decimal, by the parts of the whole number, as 20, cutting

As the three sums above are sufficient to show how addition is performed, I
shall rest the matter here and proceed to SUBTRACTION OF DECIMALS.

SUBTRACT, as in whole numbers, pointing off as many figures to the right, as
there are decimals in either of the subtracting numbers.

EXAMPLE.

From 158.924851 From 89.749321 From 32.4536 Take 88.937862 Take 62.858431 Take
9.5647 -- -- -- Ans. 69.986989 Ans. 26.890890 Ans. 22.8889

MULTIPLICATION OF DECIMALS.
RULE.

WORK as if the two numbers to be multiplied were whole numbers, pointing off
as many decimals to the right, as there are in both the factors, or numbers so
multiplied.

MULTIPLICATION OF DECIMALS.
EXAMPLE.

56.5 51.6 56.32 31.459 4.0.6 48.91 42.618 -- -- -- -- 226.00 30.96 5632 251672
50688 31459 45056 188754 22528 62918 -- 125836 2754.6113 -- 1340.719662

DIVISION OF DECIMALS.
RULE.

1. AFTER bringing down and dividing all the whole numbers, the other quotient
figures are decimal fractions, and as such, must be pointed off.

2. Should there be a remainder, after bringing down the last figure of the
dividend, annex a cipher thereto, and divide again, and so proceed until
nothing remains -- the quotient is the answer.

EXAMPLE.

1. Divide 10.10 by 10.

10)10.10 -- 1.01 Ans.

2. Divide 64.8 by 16

16)64.8(4.05 64 -- 80 80

DIVISION OF DECIMALS.
3. Divide 64.81 by.16

.16)64.81(405.0625 64 -- 81 80 -- 100 96 -- 40 32 -- 80 80 --

In this case the divisor being hundredth parts, the quotient claims two places
for whole numbers, after those in the dividend, viz. 64, are divided and done
with, and the answer is 405.0625

If the divisor were tenths, the place for tenth parts only, on the left of the
decimals would be filled up with whole numbers: If thousandth parts, then the
whole numbers would fill up the place of thousandth parts, on the left of the
decimals.

In dividing decimals, whenever there begins to be a repetition of the quotient
figures, and the remainder, that is when the quotient figures run thus.4568 or
any other particular ones, and one of those figures is repeated in the quotient
(the remainder being the same in both cases) it is useless to proceed further
with the operation, as it may then be continued to infinity, without coming any
nearer the exact number, as in the case following.

4. Divide 32.250000 by 48.750

48.750)32250000(.66153846+ Ans. 292500 -- 300000 292500 -- 75000 48750 --
262500 243750 -- 1^7500 146250 -- 412500 390000 -- 225000 195000 -- 300000
292500 -- (7500)

5. Divide 773.7631978504 by 12.06172 Ans. 64.150320008229+

The Rule of Three Direct in Decimals.
RULE.

1. STATE the sum as if the parts thereof were whole numbers, reducing the
first and third numbers to one denomination, that is, they must both be tenths,
hundredths, or the like.

2. Multiply the second and third numbers together, and divide by the first.

3. Point off as many figures (except one) on the right of the quotient, as
there are decimals in the second and third numbers taken together; those on the
left being of that denomination, of which the middle number is a fraction, as
pounds, etc.

4. If the second number be shillings, and parts thereof, divide the quotient
by 20, multiplying the decimals by 12, and pointing off again for pence,
farthings, etc.

5. In dividing by the first number, if there is a remainder, annex a cipher to
it, and divide again, and so on, till nothing remains, observing to point off
agreeable to the product of the second and third numbers.

6. If the first and third terms are whole numbers, and the second one, tenths,
or whole numbers and tenths, whole numbers and hundredths, etc. point off as
many decimals as there are in it (the second term) the left hand figures are
whole numbers of the middle number. -- See the 6th sum for example.

OBSERVATION.
THE knowledge of this system depends in a great measure upon that of vulgar
fractions, without which nothing can be done to perfection.

GENERAL RULE.
The first thing to be done in this case, is to find the proportion in which
the one part stands with respect to the other, as a dollar to a pound, New York
currency, which when reduced into pence, will stand thus, 96/240, but when
reduced to their lowest terms, will be found to be. This may serve to show the
propriety of becoming acquainted with vulgar fractions.

The following table shows the proportion of all the different coins and
currencies (of which I propose to lay down a system of reduction) to each other.

Having in the foregoing table shown pretty fully the proportion between one
coin or currency and another, I shall proceed directly to the reduction of
them, in which I shall endeavor to be as plain, and at the same time as
concise as possible.

To reduce English Sterling into Irish Money, and Irish Money into English
Sterling.
RULE.

1. TO reduce sterling into Irish, add one twelfth.

2. To reduce Irish into sterling, subtract one thirteenth.

EXAMPLE.

L. sterling. 12 100 8 6 8 -- L. 108 6 8 Irish. The reverse. L. s. d. 108 6 8
Irish. deduct 1/11 8 6 8 -- Answer. 100 0 0 sterling.

Here the proportion being twelve to thirteen, as in the table of proportions,
I take 100 l. English sterling, dividing it by 12 and adding the quotient to
the dividend; the answer is 108 l. 6 s. 8 d. Irish; the reversing the case
needs no explanation.

To reduce pounds Sterling, into English guineas; proportion 21 to 20.

RULE.

Subtract one twenty-first part, from the pounds Sterling; the remainder are
guineas.

EXAMPLE.

L. 105 21) 105( 5 105 -- -- 100 guineas. Again. L. 105 20 -- 21)2100(100
guineas. 21 -- 00 The reverse of the above. guineas. 2 0)10 0=100 -- 5 = 5 --
105 Sterling. or thus, 100 guineas. 21 -- 100 200 -- 2 0)210 0 -- Ans. 105 L.
Sterling.

To reduce pounds Sterling, into moidores; proportion, 27 to 20.

RULE.

1. Divide the given number of pounds by 9, subtracting the quotient therefrom.

2. Divide the remainder by 6, subtracting that quotient from the dividend in
the like manner; the remainder will be the answer. The common method in this
case, is to multiply by 20 and divide by 27, and contrariwise to reverse it;
but the above rule being shorter, I have chosen it as the best.


EXAMPLE.

9)27 l. Sterling. 3 -- 6)24 4 -- Ans. 20 moidores.

To reduce moidores, into pounds Sterling.
RULE.

1. Divide by 5, adding the quotient to the dividend.

2. Divide the product by 8, adding the quotient again to the dividend, as in
the proof.

5)20 moidores. 4 -- 8)24 3 -- Ans. 27 l.

In order that the reader may understand why I make use of 9 and 6 in the one
case, and of 5 and 8 in the other, I shall only observe that 9 times 6 are
fifty-four, and 5 times eight are forty, which two numbers bear the same
proportion to each other, that 27 does to 20; this will therefore serve as an
explanation to all cases of a similiar nature in this system of reduction.

To reduce pounds Sterling, into English or French crowns; proportion, 1 to 4.

RULE.

1. To reduce pounds into crowns, multiply by 4.

2. To reduce crowns into pounds, divide by 4.

EXAMPLE.

32 4 -- Ans. 128 crowns. Reverse. 4)128 crowns. -- 32 l.

I shall omit doing any thing with French guineas, as they respect pounds
Sterling; because the one is precisely equal to the other, and consequently
needs no reduction.

To reduce pounds Sterling, into French livres -- proportion, 1 to 24.

RULE.

1. Multiply the number of pounds by 24.

2. If there are shillings and pence in the given sum, take the parts of a
pound for them, dividing 24, and setting the quotient under the product of the
pounds, as in practice -- See the

EXAMPLE.

l. s. d. 1 17 6 10 s. is 24 -- 24 5 s. is 12 2 s6 is 6 3 -- Answer, 45 livres.
proof. 24)45(1 l. 17 s. 6 d. 24 -- 21 20 -- 24) 420 (17 s.6 d. 24 -- 180 168 --
12 12 -- 144 144

To reduce pounds Sterling, into pounds Dutch or Flemish currency --
proportion, 9 to 16.

RULE.

Divide the given sum Sterling by 3, adding the quotient to the dividend, which
product divide again by 3, adding the dividend and quotient together as before;
the product is the answer. -- Otherwise, multiply by 16, and divide by 9.

EXAMPLE.

3)24 l. Sterling. 8 -- 3)32 10 - 13 - 4 -- Ans. l. 42 - 13 - 4 Flemish.

Again.

24 l. Sterling. 16 -- 144 24 -- 9)384 -- Ans. l. 42 - 13 - 4 Fle.

To reverse the above case i. e. to reduce Dutch or Flemish pound^^ into
Sterling.

RULE.

Divide the given sum Flemish by 4, subtracting the quotient from the dividend,
the remainder of which divide again by 4, subtracting the quotient as before;
the last remainder is the answer. -- Otherwise, multiply by 9, and divide by
16, the quotient is the answer.

EXAMPLE.

l. s. d. 4)42 - 13 - 4 Flemish. 10 - 13 - 4 -- 4)32 - 0 - 0 8 - 0 - 0 -- l. 24

To reduce Sterling, into Dutch or Flemish guilders -- proportion, 3 to 32.

RULE.

1. Multiply the given sum Sterling, by 4, and that product by 8.

thirty-second parts of a half johannes, which fraction reduce to its lowest
terms, according to case 2, of reduction of vulgar fractions -- page 20.

3. If there is a fraction in dividing by 9, as 4/9, and another in reducing
the shillings and pence to the fraction of a half johannes, reduce them to a
simple fraction, according to case X page 24.

EXAMPLE.

Rules for Calculating Federal Money.
IT is not a little extraordinary, that this currency which is of all others
the least intricate and the easiest calculated, is also the least understood
and the seldomest practiced, even by good arithmeticians -- I flatter myself
however, that I shall explain it in such a manner, as to leave no person at a
loss, who will pay half an hour's attention to the following pages: Here I must
observe once for all, that in every case, the different denominations must be
considered as whole numbers, and that the dollar point is the regulator for all
the others. I do therefore for the more easy comprehension of the subject,
subjoin the following

TABLE.
EAGLE. DOLLARS. DIMES. CENTS. MILLS. 1 10 1 10 100 1 10 100 1,000 1 10 100
1,000 10,000

All reductions in Federal Money, are performed by annexing ciphers or cutting
off figures on the right hand, in the following manner: To reduce eagles into
dollars -- dollars into dimes -- dimes into cents, or cents into mills, annex
one cipher as in the table -- To reduce a lesser denomination to a greater, cut
off just as many figures as there are ciphers annexed in the table to reduce
the greater to the lesser: thus if the sum be mills, cut off four to make
eagles -- three to make dollars -- two to make dimes, or one to make cents --
those figures so cut off are fractions of the greater denomination; as 42.39 or
42 dollars and 39 cents. As it is the most common (and equally proper) to speak
altogether of dollars, cents and mills, without respect to eagles or dimes, I
snail adopt this mode; at the same time observing, that where dollars and a
number of cents less than 10 occur, the place of dimes must be filled up with a
cipher, thus, 54.08 or 54 dollars and 8 cents.


If the sum be of different denominations, as 3 eagles, 4 dollars, 5 dimes, 6
cents and 7 mills, or any others, reduction decending cannot apply, because it
is already reduced, and must be numerated as whole numbers in the lowest
denomination mentioned -- in the present case it is 34,567 mills.

To find the amount of any quantity or number at a given price.

RULE.

If the price is not so proportioned to the dollar as to admit of taking the
parts, viz. 1-2, 1-4, etc. then multiply the given number by the price, and
point off as many figures from the right hand of the product as there are
noughts in the table betwixt the dollar and the lowest denomination mentioned.
Thus if it be dimes, point off one -- if cents, two, and if mills, three --
those to the left hand are dollars -- the first two to the right, cents, and
the other one mills (if mills be given) as 342.91.8 or 342 dollars 91 cents 8
mills.

EXAMPLE.

234 at 8 cents. 8 -- Answer, 18.72 or 18 dollars, 72 cents. 3476 at 3 cents 4
mills, 34 -- 13904 10428 -- Answer, 118. 18.4 or 118 dollars, 18 cents, 4
mills. 2432 at 1 dollar, 27 cents. 127 -- 17024 4864 2432 -- Answer, 3088.64 or
3088 dollars, 64 cents.

SUBTRACTION.
RULE -- As in Whole Numbers -- thus, Dolls. c.m.
From 2432.75.8 Take 2195.86.9 -- Answer, 236.88.9 or 236 dolls. 88 cents, 9
mills.

ADDITION.
RULE -- As in Whole Numbers -- thus, Dolls. c.m.
To 1728.34.3 Add 1624.89.9 -- Answer, 3353.24.2 or 3353 dolls. 24 cents, 2
mills.

Interest on Federal Money.
RULE.

1. If the sum consists of dollars only, multiply it by the rate per cent, and
that product by the term of years, pointing off two figures from the right hand
for cents; the rest are dollars -- thus,

598 dollars. 7 rate per cent. -- Answer, dolls. 41.86 cents, one years
interest. 5 term of years. -- Answer, 209.30 or 209 dollars, 30 cents.

2. If the sum consists of dollars and cents, proceed in the same manner, and
point off four figures; those two next the dollar point, are cents; the next
one mills, and the remaining one tenths of a mill -- thus,

Dolls.cents. 25.56 principle. 7 rate per cent. -- Doll. 1.78.9.2 interest for
one year. 6 term of years. -- Answer. 10.73.5.2 or 10 dolls. 73 cents, 5 mills,
2-10

3. If it is necessary to take the parts of a year, and in dividing there is a
remainder on the right hand, as 2 or 3, call it 20 or 30 as the case may be,
dividing again, and so on until nothing remains, taking notice to point off as
many additional figures as have been so annexed -- thus,

Dolls.cents. 5475 for 3 1-2 years. 7 rate per cent. -- 38325 3 1-2 term of
years. -- 1149 75 191 625 -- 13.41.3.7 5 or 13 d. 4 1 c. 3 m. 75-100 of a m.
