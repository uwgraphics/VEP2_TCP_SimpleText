PROLOGUE.
Written by T.W. Fitzgerald, Esquire. -- Spoken by Mr. Macready.
WHEN invalids possess both faith and wealth,
They Will find a nostrum to restore their health;
A panacea advertised to cure
Each ill the human body can endure.
But our bold Author claims a nobler art,
And advertises to relieve -- the heart
So many patients he expects to see,
That I Am appointed as his deputy.
Now, then, your mental maladies explain,
And I Will remove or mitigate the pain.
Does love or jealousy your peace molest,
Revenge inflame, ambition gnaw your breast?
For jealousy, a sovereign balm behold, --
The husband's certain cure, a pill of gold;
This dose, administered with prudent care,
Dispels at once the frailties of the fair;
Deprives the proctor of his crim.-con. ^ee,
And tunes the chord that jar'd to harmony.
Sold love torment some Romeo's heated brain,
Or agonize a Iuliet's breast with pain,
Let them my po^ent remedy apply, --
The maid shall cease to pine, the youth to sigh:
Gold shall restore each drooping lover's health,
And passion find a ^^^stitute in wealth.
But let not ill-timed ridicule degrade
What Heaven, when well applied, a blessing made,
To foster merit, wheresoever found,
And with improvement cheer a country round;
To feed the hungry, and to clothe the poor,
And send the beggar happy from the door;
To mitigate the horrors of despair,
And make the family of want our care;
To succor genius, drooping in distress,
Making the business of our lives to bless.
When the rich man can such employment find,
We wish his purse as ample as his mind.
For one poor patient I Have an anxious fear;
And you must be his kind physicians here.
Our Author has tonight so much at stake,
He finds his throbbing heart inclined to ache!
But should his Play a liberal audience please,
Your warm applause will set his heart at ease.

ACT I.
SCENE I. -- A Farm Yard. House on one Side, a neat Flower Garden on the other.
The Bells of a Team jingling.
FRANK (without). WOYH! Whoh! Smiler. (Enters.) So Feyther be not come home
from the Nabob's house yet. Eh! bean't that sister Jessy in her garden, busy
among the poseys? -- Sister Jessy!


Enter JESSY from the Garden, a watering pot in her hand. Iessy. Ah, Frank. so
soon returned from Gloucester? have you sold the corn?


Frank. Ees.


Iessy. And how did you like the town? you were never there before?


Frank Loike it -- I doant know how I loik'd it, not I; zomehow cou^dn^t zee
the town for the housen: desperate zight of 'em, to be sure -- But, Jessy, you
who went to Lunnun Town to take in your learing, can tell me, be there as many
houses in Lunnun?


I^ssy. A hundred times the number.


Frank. And do your 'squires there* like Sir Hubert Stanley and the Nabob here,
keep fine coaches?


Iessy Yes, Frank; there are some thousands round St. James^s Gate.


Frank. St. James's Geat! Dong it; it would be wort^ a poor man's while to
stand and open that geat -- Pray you, where do that geat lead to?


Iessy. The road to preferment Frank.


Frank. Ecod, if your road to preferment be so crammed wi' your coaches and
great folk no wonder a poor man be run down when he tries to get a bit.


Iessy. Ha! ha!


Frank. You seem to be in terrible good spirits, Jessy.


Iessy. I have reason, Frank, I have just received a letter from my dear
Edward, who has left London on business with his father, Mr. Rapid, and will be
here today.


Frank. I suppose it be a desperate long letter, and cruel sweet. Full of
kisses and voluntines. -- Nine sheets, I warrant.


Iessy. Hardly nine words. The truth is, that Edward, though handsome, generous,
and I hope sincere, is impatient, and hasty to a degree, that --


Frank. Hasty! What then? When a man be on the road to do good, he cannot go too
fast, I say. -- Bean^t that Feyther coming through Wheat Ash? He have been
drinking and gamestring all good Sunday night wi' Nabob's sarvants, -- how
whitish and deadly bad he do luck. He used to be as comely and handsome as
either of us, was not he now? Do you know, Jessy, at church yesterday, Sir
Hubert looking round, as he always do, to see if his tenants be there, missed
Feyther, and gave me such a desperate look, that I dropped prayer book out of my
hand; and truly, when Feyther do go to church, I be always shamed, he never
knows where to find the collect -- never -- I Am sure it be not my fault, he be
so full of prodigality -- never son set Feyther better example than I do^s
mine; what can I do more for 'un? it wou^dn^t be becoming in me to leather
Feyther, would it, Jessy?


Iessy. Here he comes -- I Will return to my garden -- to converse with him is to
me dreadful; for while my breast rises with indignation at his conduct as a
man, it sinks again in pity for the misfortunes of a parent.


Frank. Now, that is just like I -- I feels as if I should like to lick 'un and
cry all the time -- but what will be the end on it, Jessy?


Iessy. Ruin, inevitable ruin (despondingly)


Frank. Well, don^t thee be cast down -- thee knows I be cruel kind to thee; at
meals, I always gis thee the desperate n^ce bits, and if thy lover prove false
hearted, or Feyther should come to decay, I be a terrible strong lad, I Will work
for thee fra sunrise to down, and if any one offer to harm thee, I Will fight
for thee till I die.


Iessy. Thanks, my good lad; thanks, dear brother.

Kisses him, and exit.
Frank. As nice a bit of a sister that, as in our country round.


Enter Farmer OATLAND dressed in a compound of rusticity and fashion. Oat.
(singing). Ba viamo tutti tra. -- Dom it this be what I call loife! Have you
sold the wheat?


Frank. Ees.


Oat. How much?


Frank. Two load. -- Six and twenty pound.


Oat. (yawning). Exactly the trifle I lost last night.


Frank. What?


Oat. Take it to the Nabob's gentleman.


Frank. I were going, Feyther, to the castle, to ge^ it to Sir Hubert's steward
for rent.


Oat. Rent, you bore! That for Sir Hubert (snapping his fingers). Ah! Nabob's
sarvants be the tippy -- Every thing be done by them so genteely.


Frank. Ecod* you be done by them genteely enough! I be sure that house have
brought the country round to ruination. Before this Nabob come here wi' all his
money, and be doomed to 'un, every thing were as peaceable and deceant as never
was; -- not a lawyer within ten miles; now there be three practizing in
village; and what is ameast as bad, there be three doctors; and the farmers so
consated, drive about in their chay carts, eat lump sugar every day, and g^^
balls.


Oat. To be sure.


Frank. And what is the upshot? why that they jig it away to county jail.


Oat. Tezez vous! Let me see -- Great cassino be ten of diamonds. Well, then, I
play --


Frank. Play! ecod, if you go on so, you mun work though.


Oa^* Next I mun take care of the speads.


Frank. No, Feyther, a spade mun take care of you; by gol* here be Mr.
Heartley, Sir Hubert's steward; -- now doan't you be saucy to 'un, Feyther; --
now do behave thy zelf -- now that is a man, Feyther, do. clapping him on the
back.


Enter HEARTLEY. Heart. Good day, Farmer Oatland; how do do, honest Frank?


Frank. Desperate pure, thank ye, fur.


Heart. Well, farmer, once more I have called respecting your arrear of rent --
Three hundred pound is a long sum.


Frank. Three hundred pound!


Heart. And unless it be immediately discharged, Sir Hubert is resolved to --


Oat. That for Sir Hubert -- He shall have his rent -- Frank, send your sister
Jessy to the Nabob^s, he will let me have the money.


Frank. No! I will not -- What business have sister at such a desperate prodigal
place! Na, na, I^ll go myzelf.


Heart. You are in the right* honest Frank.


Frank. Yes, sur* I always am.


Oat Ugh! You vulgar mongrel -- Well, desire the Nabob's gentleman to desire
the Nabob to let me have three hundred pounds.


Frank. He will not gi' thee a brass farthing.


Oat. Sir Hubert shall have his money -- Ha! ha! ha! my notion is* he wants it
sad enough, ha! ha!


Heart. Sirrah!


Frank. Don't you mind 'un, sur don't ye, he be's intosticated. Dong thee,
beheave thyzelf (with sorrow and vexation.)


Oat Silence* you hound! and obey* -- Bon jour, Mr. Steward -- I^ll to bed --
Pon honor, I must cut Champaigne, it makes me so narvous -- Sir Hubert shall
have his money, let that satisfy -- Follow me, cur. Exit into the house.


Heart. Sad doings, Frank. Exit.


FRANK shakes his head and follows OATLAND. SCENE II. -- A Room in the Nabob^s
House.
Enter ELLEN VORTEX meeting BRONZE. Ellen. Good Mr. Bronze, have you been at
Sir Hubert Stanley^s?


Bronze. Yes, ma'am.


Ellen Is Charles Stanley arrived?


Bronze. No, ma'am; but he is hourly expected.


Ellen. Do they say he is well -- quite recovered?


Bronze I don't know ma'am -- upon my soul. -- I beg pardon, but really the
Baronet^s house is horrid vulgar, compared to your uncle's, the Nabob's here; I
peep^d through my glass into an old hall, and beheld fifty paupers at dinner,
such wretches, and the Baronet himself walking round the table to see them
properly fed. -- How damned low! -- Ugh! I wou^d bet a rump and dozen our
second table is more genteelerer than Sir Hubert^s own -- But I must away, for
we expect the rich Miss Vortex -- I beg pardon; but your name and the Nabob^s
daughter being the same, we call her the rich* to distinguish --


Ellen* And you do wisely -- No term of distinction could possibly be more
significant or better understood by the world than that you have adopted.


Bronze. Hope no offense, ma'am.


Ellen. None, Bronze, go in --


Bronze. The last man on earth to offend a fine woman.


Exit. Ellen. The rich Miss Vortex -- most true. -- But now dear Charles
Stanley is returned, I claim the superior title of the happy. Oh! Charles, when
we parted last at Spa, how great the contrast; thy animated form was prison^d
in the icy fetters of disease, thy pase and quivering lip refused a last adieu;
-- but ah! a smile, that seemed borrowed from a seraph, who waited to bear thee
up to Heaven, swore for thee everlasting love. That smile supported me in
solitude -- but to solitude I have now bid adieu: and to be near the lord of my
heart, have again entered this house, the palace of ruinous luxury and
licentious madness: -- but here comes its whimsical proprietor.


Enter Mr. VORTEX, with a paper in his hand, attended by black and white
Servants. Vortex. Sublime! -- Oh the same of this speech will spread to
Indostan. Eh! -- don't I smell the pure air in this room? Oh! you villains,
would you destroy me, throw about the perfumes. For legislative profundity, for
fancy and decoration -- it is a speech --


Ellen. What speech is it, sir?


Vortex. Ah! Ellen, why my maiden speech in Parliament. -- It will alarm all
Europe; -- I^ll speak it to you --


Ellen. No, my dear uncle, not just now. -- I hear you have been ill.


Vortex. Oh! very. A strange agitation at my heart and such a whizzing and
spinning in my head --


Ellen. I hope you have had advice? --


Vortex. Oh, yes I Have had them all -- One physician told me it was caused by
too brilliant and effervescent a genius; -- the next said, it was the scurvy;
-- a third, it proceeded from not eating pepper to a melon; another had the
impudence to hint it was only little qualms that agitated some gentlemen who
had made fortunes in India; -- one recommended a s^^ voyage -- another a
flannel nightcap; -- one prescribed water, -- the other brandy; but, however,
they all agreed in this essential point, that I Am not to be contradicted, but
have my way in every thing.


Ellen. An extremely pleasant prescription, certainly. But under these
circumstances do you hold it prudent, uncle, to become a parliamentary Orator?
I believe a little gentle contradiction is usual in that House.


Vortex. I know it -- but if you will hear my speech, you will see how I manage
-- I begin -- "Sir -- "


Enter Servant. Servant. Your daughter, sir, is arrived from town.


Ellen. Thank you, cousin, for this relief. -- Aside.


Vortex. Zounds! I Am not to be interrupted.


Serve. She is here, sir.


Enter Miss VORTEX. Miss Vor. My dear Nabob, uncommon glad to see you. Ah!
Ellen; what, tired of seclusion and a cottage?


Ellen. I hope, cousin, I am welcome to you.


Miss Vor. Certainly; you know we are uncommon glad to see any body in the
country -- but, my dear Nabob, you dont't inquire about the opening of our
townhouse.


Nabob. I was thinking of my speech.


Miss Vor. The most brilliant house-warming -- uncommon full, above a thousand
people -- every body there.


Ellen. Pray, cousin, do you then visit every body?


Miss Vor. Certainly, they must ask me.


Ellen. Must! I should imagine that would depend on inclination.


Miss Vor. Inclination! Pshaw! I beg your pardon, but you are really uncommon
ignorant, my dear. They must ask me, I tell you. -- Now suppose a Duchess rash
enough to shut me from her parties; -- very well. -- She names a night -- I
name the same, and give an entertainment greatly surpassing here is in splendour
and profusion. -- What is the consequence? -- why, that her rooms are as
deserted as an Ex-minister's levee* and mine cramm^d to suffocation with her
Grace's most puissant and noble friends. -- Ha! ha! my dear Ellen, the court of
St. James's run after a good supper as eagerly as the Court of Aldermen. -- Ha!
ha! your being in this country, Nabob, was thought quite charming. -- A host
not being at home to receive his guests is uncommon new and elegant, is not it.
-- Here we improve, my dear, on ancient hospitality -- those little
memorandums, Nabob, will give you an idea of the sort of thing.


Vor. (Reads). "March" -- Oh! that is a delightful month, when Nature produces
nothing, and every thing is forced. -- Let me see -- "50 quarts of green peace
at five guineas a quart," -- that was pretty well: -- "500 peaches" -- at what?
-- "a guinea each." -- Oh! too cheap.


Miss Vor. It Is very true; but I assure you I tried every where to get them
dearer, but could not.


Vor. And I suppose the new white satin furniture was all spoiled.


Miss Vor. Oh! entirely -- and the pier glasses shivered to pieces so
delightfully.


Vor. Well, I hope you had the whole account put in the papers?


Miss Vor. Certainly, else what would have been the use of giving the fete?
Then the company; such charming eccentricity, such characters out of character.
-- We had a noble Peer bowing for custom to his shop, and an Alderman turning
over the music leaves for the celebrated Soprano; an Orator's lady detailing
her husband's three hours speech in Parliament, and the Orator himself
describing how puppets are managed at the Fantoccini; we had grandmothers
making assignations with boys, and the children of Israel joining the host of
Pharaoh. -- Oh! my dear Miss Vortex, why don't you partake in these charming
scenes?


Ellen. My dear Miss Vortex, six suppers would annihilate my fortune.


Miss Vor. Oh! true; I forg^t your small fortune: but I don't think it much
signifies, I swear people of fashion in town seem to do as well without money
as with it. You might be successful at play -- there are points to be learnt
which certainly do not give you the worst of the game. Come, will you be my
protege?


Ellen. Excuse me, cousin. I dare say I ought to be covered with blushes when I
own a vulgar detestation of the character of a female gamester; and I must
decline the honor of your ^ntroduction to the ha^t ton, till at least they
have justice on their side.


Miss Vor. An uncommon odd girl, Nabob.


Ellen. Heavens! to what state of ^bject degradation must fas^^onable society
be reduced, when officers of police are as much (...) by ladies in the purli^^s
of St. James's, as they are by cut-purses in the (...) of St. Giles's.


Miss Vor. For shame, Ellen, to censure your own sex.


Ellen. Nor Madam, I am it is advocate -- and in that sex's name protest an
abhorrence of those wo^en who do not consider any thing shameful but to be
ashamed of anything -- whose resemblance to nature and innocence exists but in
their nakedness, and to whom honor is only known as a pledge at a
gaming-table. Exit.


Miss Vor. Did you ever hear, Nabob?


Vortex. I did not hear a word she said -- I was thinking of my speech.


Miss Vor. A pert, Gothic, low-bred creature! But her contemptible fortune
suits uncommon well with her gro^elling ideas.


Vortex. Don't you talk of her fortune, it always makes m^ poor ^ead worse. You
know at the time I gave her fi^e thousand pounds in lieu of what I called her
expectations. I had in my hands an (...). O dear! I Am afraid the doctor was
right -- ah! (...) are certain East India (...) -- I wonder if giving her fifty
thousand back again wou^d do my heart any good.


Miss Vor. What! my dear Nabob? I declare you quite shock me.


Vortex. Oh conscience!


Miss Vor. Conscience! he! he! a thing so uncommon vulgar, a thing so
completely (...); besides, you know very well it is absolutely impossible to
exist under 20,000 l. a year.


Vortex. That Is very true.


Miss Vor. Some people certainly do contrive to (...) on with ten thousand, but
how they do it is to (...); th^^ think of your intention of marrying me to the
son of your great rival the B^ronet; think of his borough.


Vortex. Ah! very true. -- Conscience avaunt; I have made a motion on matrimony
to Sir Hubert.


Miss Vor. And young Stanley's arrival; Oh! what a sweet youth!


Vortex. Oh! what a sweet borough interest! (...) I Am glad your heart is
interested.


Miss Vor. Heart interested! Lud, how can you suspect me of so uncommon vulgar
a sensation. I trust my joy is occasioned by ideas more becoming a woman of
fashion -- I am charmed because his fortune is large* his family ancient; and
because my marriage will render all my female friends so uncommon miserable;
and because I suspect that Ellen met young Stanley at Spa, and that she dares
aspire to --


Vortex I wish she were out of the house.


Miss Vor. No -- she shall stay to witness my triumph.


Vortex. Shall stay -- I Am not to be contradicted, you know -- my physicians --


Miss Vor. Certainly not, my dear Nabob; but I may recommend; I Am sure no
physician would object to your taking advice. Ah! does Ellen love you as I do?
-- will she listen to your speech as I intend to do? -- would she throw away
thousands for you in a night as I do?


Vortex. Very true! very true! Exeunt.


SCENE III. -- A Pleasure Ground, and View of an ancient Castle.
Enter four Servants dressed in old-fashioned liveries, then Sir HUBERT STANLEY
and HEARTLEY. Sir Hub. Good Heartly, is all prepared for my boy's reception,
his favorite study on the southern battlement? -- Are his dogs trained -- his
hunters well conditioned?


Heart. To say truth, Sir Hubert, the castle has been all day in quarrel, each
servant claiming the right of exclusive attendance on his dear young master.


Sir Hub. I thank their honest loves. He writes me he is well, good Heartly;
quite well. -- Ha! the village bells proclaim my boy^s arrival. -- Do thou
hear the people's shouts?


Heart. Aye, and it revives my old heart.


Sir Hub. These welcomes are the genuine effusions of love and gratitude --
Spite of this Nobob^s arts, you see how my loving neighbors respect me.


Enter Servant. Sir Hub. Where is my boy?


Serve. Not yet arrived, sir.


Sir Hub. No!


Serve. These rejoicings are for the Nabob's daughter, who is just come from
London.


Sir Hub. Indeed! ( pee^ishly) Well, well.


Serve. My young master will alight privately at Oatland's farm, and walk
through the park. Exit.


Sir Hub. The Nabob's daughter! -- Well, let it pass. -- Heartly, what said
farmer Oatland?


Heart. Nothing but what profligacy and insolence dictated -- he defied your
power, and sent to the Nabob


Sir Hub. Ungrateful man! let a distress be issued. -- Hold; no, no.


Heart. Indeed Sir Hubert, he is undeserving your lenity. -- Besides, sir, your
mortgage; Mr. Rapid, the wealthy tailor, will be here to day -- the interest on
the mortgage must be paid -- some of your election bills remain unliquidated,
and I fear, without a further mortgage --


Sir Hub. Don't torture. Pardon me, good old man.


Heart. Truly, Sir Hubert, what might have been effected with 5000 l. some
years ago, will now require ten -- you must retrench your hospitable
benevolence.


Sir Hub. My worthy steward, my head has long acknowledged the truth of your
arithmetic -- but my head could never teach it to my heart.


Heart. And, sir, you may raise your rents.


Sir Hub. Never, Heartley -- never. -- what! shall the many suffer that I may
be at ease! -- But away with care -- this is a moment devoted to exstasy --
this is the hour a doting father is to clasp an only child, who, after
combating with disease and death, returns triumphant to his arms in lusty
health and manhood. -- Ah! he approaches; it is my boy -- Do thou not see him
in the beechen avenue. -- Dull old man, advance thine hand thus -- ( putting
his hand over his forehead). -- See how his eyes wander with delight, and
renovate the pictures of his youth. -- Ah! now he sees his father, and flies
like lightning.


Enter CHARLES STANLEY -- (kneels). Charles My honored -- my loved father!


Sir Hub. Rise to my heart. -- Stand off, and let my eyes gloat upon thee --
thou art well. -- Thy arm good Heartley -- Nay, do not weep, old honesty, twill
infect me.


Charles. Ah* my excellent old friend -- in health I hope?


Heart. Aye, good master, and this day will make me young again.


Ch^rles. Dear father, already must I become a suitor to you. -- Passing
Oatland's farm, I found his lovely daughter Jessy in tears, occasioned by her
father's inability to pay his rent. I dried them with a promise -- (HEARTLEY
shakes his head, and Sir HUBERT averts his face). -- Ha! your brow is clouded
with unhappiness; -- pray sir --


Sir Hub. Good Heartley, leave us -- ( Exeunt HEARTLEY and Servants). --
Charles, so mixed is the cup of life, that this day, the happiest thy old
father can ever hope to see, is dashed with bitterness and sorrow, boy. I Have
been a very unthrift to thee.


Charles. Oh, sir!


Sir Hub. Listen to me. -- You have heard how my father kept alive the
benevolent hospitality that once distinguished old England, and I not finding
in modern ethics aught likely to improve either the morals or happiness of
mankind, determined to persevere in the ways of my fathers. Soon after you went
abroad, the adjoining estate was purchased by an East Indian, groaning under
wealth produced by groans. Like the viper, after collecting in the warm
sunshine his bag of venom, he came to the abode of peace and innocence, and
disseminated his poison. But mark me -- think me not so unjust, boy, as with
random slander to censure any body of men. No, thank heaven; there are numbers
whom Providence, in addition to the power, has added the will, to render wealth
a blessing to all around them.


Charles. You are ever just and liberal.


Sir Hub. But for this vile exception, this Mr. Vortex, I tell thee, riot,
contention* indolence, and vice succeeded. I struggled against this mischief,
which spurred him on to oppose me in my election. This contest [I trust,
Charles, you think the dignity of our family demanded it] -- this contest, I
say, obliged me to mortgage my estate to a considerable amount; and I fear,
boy, even that will not suffice. Do thou not blame the father?


Charles. Blame, sir? my fortune nay, my life, is he^d but to promote your
happiness.


Sir Hub. Glorious boy! then all will be well again; thy estate restored, thy
wealth enlarged.


Charles. How?


Sir Hub. By marriage, Charles. -- [Charles averts his face with dejection.]


Charles. Marriage, sir! To conceal the passion that triumphs here were but to
deceive a father, and injure the bright excellence I love. When I was ill at
Spa, the votaries of pleasure avoided me as the harbinger of melancholy, and I
was despised as a thing passing into ob^ivion by all but one fair creature. I
obtain^d an opportunity to thank her for the charitable pity her eye had beamed
on me. Love soon kindled his torch at Pity^s altar, for I found in Miss Vortex
such excel^ence --


Sir Hub. Who?


Charles. Miss Vortex, sir.


Sir Hub. From India?


Charles. The same.


Sir. Hub. She that is now proposed for your alliance.


Charles. Is it possible?


Sir Hub. And awaits your arrival in the neighborhood.


Charles. Oh! let me haste to her. -- Yet hold! Frank Oatland attends to hear
your determination.


Sir Hub. At present, Charles, I cannot grant your suit. -- (CHARLES beckons in
FRANK.) -- Young man, tell your Father the law must take its course. When I see
in him symptoms of contrition and amendment, I may restore him.


Frank. Thank ye, -- thank ye, sur.


Charles. How came this distress to fall on him?


Frank. Why, sur, he went on farmering pretty tightish, did not he, sur? till he
keep't company wi' Nabob's sarvants; then, all of a sudden, he took to the
gentleman line. I conceats, sur, he did not much understand the trim on it, for
the gentleman line didn't answer at all. I hope your honor bean't angry wi' I
for speaking to young 'Squire; your worship to know I were a bit of a
playfellow w' un, and we followed our studies together.


Sir Hub. Indeed!


Frank Ees, sur, we went through our letters -- and a-b ab -- e-b eb -- there
somehow I stuck, and 'Squire went clean away into abrevivation and abomination;
and then I never could take much to your pens, they be so cruel small; now a
pitch-fork do fit my hand so desperate kindly as never was.


Sir Hub. Ha! ha! Come, my boy, you^ll want refreshment. Exit. FRANK bows, and
is going.


Charles. What, honest Frank, will you not walk with me to the castle;


Frank. If your honor be so gracious.


Charles. Nay, wear your hat.


Frank. O dear! O dear! what a pity nobody do see I.


Charles. Come, brother student, your hand.


Frank. My hand! Lord dong it, only think of I:


Exeunt hand in hand. ACT II.
SCENE I. -- A Room in an Inn.
Enter two Waiters with luggage, meeting BRONZE. 1 st Waiter. Coming, sir*


Y. Rap. (without). Zounds, why don't you come? Why don^t all of you come, eh?


Bronze. Waiter, who are these people?


1 st Waiter. I don^t know. Mr. Bronze. -- The young one seems a queer one; he
jump^d out of the mail ran into the kitchen, whipp^d the turnspit into a
gallop, and bade him keep moving; and tho not a minute in the house, he had
been in every room, from the garret to the cellar.


2 d Waiter. Father and son, I understand. -- The name on the luggage I see, is
Rapid.


Bronze. Rapid! (aside). Perhaps it is my old master the great tailor and his
harum-scarum son -- I Will observe.


1 st Waiter. Here he comes full dash, and the old man trotting after him like
a terrier. Exeunt.


Enter Old and Young RAPID. Y. Rap. Come along, dad -- push on, my dear dad.
Well, here we are -- keep moving.


O Rap. Moving! Zounds havn't I been moving all night in the mail-coach, to
please you?


Y. Rap. Mail! famous thing, is not it? Je^up! whip over counties in a hop, step
and jump -- dash along


O. Rap. Od rot such hurry-scurry doings, I say. Here have I ground my old
bones all night in the mail, to be eight hours before my appointment with Sir
Hubert Stanley -- and now I must sit biting my fingers.


Y. Rap. Biting your fingers! No, no, I^^l find you something to do. Come,
we^ll keep moving! (Takes his father by the arm who resists.)


Enter Landlord. Land. Gentlemen, I beg leave --


Y. Rap. No prosing -- to the point.


O Rap. For shame -- don^t interrupt the gentleman.


Y. Rap. Gently dad. Dash away sir.


Land servant of Sir Hubert Stanley has been inquiring for Mr. R^^id.


Y. Rap. Push on!


Land. And expects him at the castle.


Y. Rap. That will do -- push off -- brush -- run! Exit Landlord (running.)
That Is the thing -- keep moving. I say, dad!


O. Rap. What do you say, Neddy?


Y. Rap. Neddy! dam it, don't call me Neddy. I hate to be called Neddy.


O. Rap. Well, I will not.


Y. Rap. That Is settled. I say, What Is your business with Sir Hubert? -- Some
secret, eh?


O. Rap. (aside) I will not tell you. Oh no -- a bill he owes me for making his
clothes and liveries.


Y. Rap. Pugh! he is a ready-money man. I never made a bill out for him in my
life. -- It will not do.


O. Rap Well, then, sit down, and I^ll tell you (they sit.) Can you sit still a
moment?


Y. Rap. (jumping up.) To be sure I can -- Now tell me briefly -- briefly. Sits
again.


O Rap. (aside) Indeed I will not, you must know --


Y. Rap. Aye --


O. Rap. You must know --


Y. Rap. Zounds! you have said that twice -- now don't say it again.


O. Rap. Well, I will not -- You must know -- it is a very long story.


Y. Rap. (rising.) Then I Will not trouble you.


O. Rap. (aside.) I thought so. And pray what might induce you to come with me?


Y. Rap. (aside.) Will Not tell him of Jessy. Oh, as we had given up trade, left
off stitching -- you know my way -- I like to push on -- change the scene,
that is all -- keep moving.


O Rap. Moving! (yawns). Oh, my poor old bones! Wa^ter, bring me a nightgown.
(Waiter helps him on with a nightgown -- he lays his coat on a chair.)


Y. Rap. What are you at, dad?


O. Rap. Going to take a nap on that sofa.


Y. Rap. A nap -- pugh!


O. Rap Zounds! I Have no comfort of my life with you.


Y. Rap. Say no more.


O. Rap. But I will though -- hurry, hurry -- od rabbit it, I never get a dinner
that is half dressed; and as for a comfortable sleep, I Am sure --


Y. Rap. You sleep so slow.


O. Rap. Sleep slow! I^ll sleep as slow as I please; so at your peril disturb
me. Sleep slow indeed! ( yawning).


Exit. Y. Rap. Now to visit Jessy. Waiter!


Waiter. Sar ( with great quickness).


Y. Rap. That Is right -- sir -- short -- you're a fine fellow.


Waiter. Yes, sar.


Y. Rap. Does Farmer Oatland live hereabouts?


Waiter. Yes, sar.


Y. Rap. How far?


Waiter. Three miles.


Y. Rap. Which way?


Waiter. West.


Y. Rap. That will do -- get me a buggy.


Waiter. Yes, sar.


Y. Rap. Oh, if my old dad had left off business as some of your flashy tailors
do, I might have kept a curracle, and lived like a man. Is the buggy ready?


Waiter. No, sar.


Y. Rap. But to cut the shop with paltry five thousand. -- Is the buggy ready?


Waiter. No, sar.


Y. Rap Or to have dashed to Jessy in a curracle. -- Is the buggy ready?


Waiter. No, sar. Exit.


Y Rap. To have flanked along a pair of blood things at sixteen miles an hour (
Puts himself in the act of driving, and sits on the chair where OLD RAPID left
his coat -- springs from it again.) What the devil's that? Zounds, something
has run into my back I^ll bet a hundred it is a needle in Father's pocket
Confound it! what does he carry needles now for? ( Searches the pocket) Sure
enough, here it is -- one end stuck into a letter, and the other into my back I
believe. Curse it! Eh! what^s this? Reads "To Mr. Rapid -- Free -- Hubert
Stanley. Ha ha, ha! here is dad^s secret -- Now for it! ( Reads very quick). Sir
Hubert Stanley will expect to see Mr Rapid at the Castle and would be g^ad to
extend the mortgage, which is now 50,000 l. What Is this? ( Reads again) --
Extend the mortgage, which is now 50,000 l to seventy. Fift^ thousand! huzza!
it is so -- my old dad worth fifty thousand -- perhaps seventy -- perhaps --
I Will -- no -- I Will --


Enter Waiter. Waiter. The buggy's ready, sar.


Y. Rap Dare to talk to me of a buggy, and I Will --


Waiter. Perhaps you would prefer a chaise and pair?


Y. Rap. No, I Will have a chaise and twelve Abscond! ( Exit Waiter.) I must -- I
must keep moving. -- I must travel for improvement First I^ll see the whole of
my native country, its agriculture and manufactories That, I think, will take
me full four days and a half Next I^ll make the tour of Europe; which, to do
properly, will, I dare say, employ three weeks or a month. Then returning as
completely versed in foreign manners and languages as the best of them, I Will
make a push at high life. In the first circles I^ll keep moving. Fifty
thousand! perpaps more -- perhaps -- oh!


Waiter (without) You cannot come in.


Bronze (without). I tell you I will come in.


Y. Rap, Will come in! -- that^s right -- push on, whoever you are.


Enter BRONZE. Bronze. I thought so. How do you do Mr. Rapid? Don^t you
remember Bronze, your father's foreman, when you were a boy?


Y. Rap. Ah, Bronze! how do you do, Bronze? Any thing to say, Bronze? Keep
moving. Do you know, Bronze, by this letter I have discovered, that my father
is worth -- how much think you?


Bronze. Perhaps ten thousand.


Y. Rap Push on.


Bronze, Twenty.


Y. Rap. Push on.


Bronze. Thirty.


Y Rap Keep moving.


Bronze Forty.


Y. Rap. Fifty -- perhaps -- sixty -- seventy -- oh! I Will tell you. He has lent
50 000 l. on mortgage, to an old Baronet.


Bronze. Sir Hubert St --


Y. Rap. (stopping him). I know his name as well as you do.


Bronze (aside). Here^s news for my master! Well sir, what do you mean to do?


Y. Rap. Do! Push on -- become a man of fashion, to be sure


Bronze What would you say, if I were to get you introduced to a Nabob?


Y. Rap. A Nabob! Oh! some flash-in-the-pan chap.


Bronze. Oh* no!


Y. Rap. What, one of your real, genuine, neat-as-imported Nabob's?


Bronze. Yes; Mr. Vortex. -- Did you never hear of him?


Y. Rap. To be sure I have. But will you?


Bronze. Yes.


Y. Rap. Ah! but will you do it directly?


Bronze. I will.


Y. Rap. Then push off -- Stop -- stop -- I beg your pardon -- it cuts me to
the heart to stop any man* because I wish every body to keep moving. But will not
dad's being a tailor make an objection?


Bronze. No; as you never went out with the pattern-books.


Y. Rap, (sighing). Oh! yes, I did.


Bronze. That Is awkward -- But you never operated?


Y. Rapid. [ with melancholy]. What do you say?


Bronze. I say you never. -- [describes in action the act of sewing.]


Y. Rap. ( sighing deeper). Oh! yes I did.


Bronze. That Is unlucky.


Y. Rap. Very melancholy, indeed!


Bronze. I have it. Suppose I say you are merchants.


Y. Rap. My dear fellow, sink the tailor, and I Will give you a hundred.


Bronze. Will you? thank you.


Y. Rap. Now push off.


Bronze. But don't be out of the way.


Y. Rap. Me! Bless you, I Am always in the way.


Bronze. Don't move.


Y. Rap Yes, I must move a little -- away you go -- ( pushes Bronze off).
Huzza! now to awake old dad* ( Exit, and returns with OLD RAPID.) Come along
dad.


O. Rap. half asleep. Yes, sir, -- yes, sir -- I Will measure you directly --
I Will measure you directly.


Y. Rap He Is asleep. -- Awake!


O. Rap. What Is the matter, eh? What Is the matter?


Y. Rap. What Is the matter! I Have found fifty thousand in that letter?


O. Rap. Indeed! ( opens the letter eagerly). Ah! Neddy, have you found out --


Y. Rap. I have -- that you are worth -- how much?


O. Rap. Why, since what is past --


Y. Rap. Never mind what is past.


O. Rap. I^ve been a fortunate man. My old partner used to say, Ah! you are
lucky, Rapid. Your needle always sticks in the right place.


Y. Rap No, not always ( shrugging). But how much?


O. Rap. Why, as it must out, there are fifty thousand lent on mortgage. Item
fifteen thousand in the Consols -- Item --


Y. Rap. Never mind the Items. -- The total my dear dad -- the total.


O. Rap. What do you think of a plum?


Y Rap. A plum! Oh, sweet, agreeable, little short word!


O. Rap. Besides seven hundred and ninety --


Y. Rap. Never mind the odd money -- that will do. But how came you so rich,
dad? Dam'me, you must have kept moving.


O. Rap. Why, my father, forty years ago, left me five thousands pounds; which,
at compound interest, if you multiply --


Y Rap. No; you have multiplied it famously. It Is my business to reduce it (
aside). Now, my dear dad, in the first place* never call me Neddy.


O. Rap. Why, what must I call you


Y. Rap. Ned -- short -- Ned.


O. Rap. Ned! O Ned!


Y. Rap* That will do. And in the next place, sink the tailor Whatever you do,
sink the tailor.


O. Rap. Sink the tailor! What do you mean?


Y. Rap. I^ve news for you. We are going to be introduced to Mr. Vortex* the
rich Nabob.


O. Rap. You don't say so! Huzza; it will be the making of us.


Y. Rap. To be sure. Such fashion! such style!


O. Rap. Aye, and such a quantity of liveries, and -- Oh dear me! (with great
dejection.)


Y. Rap. What Is the matter?


O Rap. (sighing.) I forgot I had left off business.


Y. Rap. Business! Confound it! Now, pray keep the tailor under, will you? I^ll
-- I^ll send an express to London (runs to the table.)


O. Rap. An express for what?


Y. Rap. I don't know. --


Enter Waiter. Waiter. The bill of fare, gentlemen.


Y. Rap. Bring it here [reads.] Turbots -- Salmon -- Soles -- Haddock -- Beef
-- Mutton -- Veal -- Lamb -- Pork Chickens -- Ducks -- Turkies -- Puddings --
Pyes. -- Dress it all -- that^s the short way.


Waiter All!


Y. Rap. Every bit.


O Rap. No, no, nonsense. -- The short way indeed! Come here, sir. -- Let me
see -- ( reads.) "Um -- Um. -- Ribs of beef" -- That^s a good thing; -- I Will
have that.


Y. Rap. What?


Waiter. Ribs of beef, sir.


Y. Rap. Are they the short ribs?


Waiter. Yes, sir.


Y Rap. That Is right.


Waiter. What liquor would your honor like?


Y. Rap. [jumping up.] Spruce beer.


Waiter. Very well, sir.


Y. Rap. I must have some clothes.


O. Rap. I Am sure that is a very good coat.


Y. Rap. Waiter! -- I must have a dashing coat for the Nabob. Is there a
rascally tailor any where near you?


Waiter. Yes, sir; -- there are two close by ( Father and Son look at each
other.)


Y. Rap. Umph! Then tell one of them to send me some clothes.


Waiter. Sir, he must take your measure.


O. Rap. To be sure he must.


Y. Rap. Oh, true! I remember the fellows do measure you somehow with long bits
of -- Well -- send for the scoundrel. Exit Waiter.


O. Rap. Oh, for shame of yourself? I Have no patience.


Y. Rap. Like you the better -- Hate patience as much as you do, -- ha! ha! --
Must swagger a little.


O Rap. Ah! I am too fond of you, I am, Ned. Take my fortune; but only remember
this -- By the faith of a man I came by it honestly -- and all I ask is, that
it may go as it came.


Y. Rap. Certainly. But we must keep moving you know.


O. Rap. Well, I don't care if I do take a bit of a walk with you.


Y. Rap. Bit of a walk! Dam'me, we'll have a gallop together. Come along, dad.
-- Push on dad. Exeunt.


SCENE II. -- A Room in Mr. VORTEX'S House.
Enter Mr. VORTEX, ELLEN, and Miss VORTEX. Ellen Married to Charles Stanley!
You, Madam?


Miss Vor. Yes, I.


Ellen. I Will not believe it.


Miss Vor. Well, I vow that is uncommon comic. And why not, my forsaken cousin?


Ellen. First, madam, I know Charles Stanley would only form so sacred an
alliance where his affections pointed out the object. Secondly, I feel those
affections to be mine.


Vortex. Thirdly, an inconstant swain was a thing never heard of; and to
conclude, pray peruse that letter --


Ellen [reads*] Sir Hubert Stanley informs Mr. Vortex that his son embraces
with eager joy the proposals for his marriage with Mr. Vortex's daughter.
(Drops the letter.) Then every thing is possible. Oh, love!


Vortex. Nay, don't you abuse poor Cupid -- his conduct has been perfectly
parliamentary. Self-interest has made the little gentleman move over to the
other side, that is all. ( Knocking at the door.)


Ellen. Heavens! should this be --


Enter a Servant. Serve. Young Mr. Stanley, sir.


Ellen. My soul sinks within me.


Miss Vor. (with affected tenderness). Upon my honor, my dear, you had better
retire. -- Your agitation --


Ellen. I thank you, madam ( going). Hold. -- No; -- with your permission I Will
remain ( returns).


Miss Vor. Just as you please. What a triumph! Oh, how uncommon delicious!


Ellen. Now, heart, be firm! [ Retires from the front of the stage].


Enter CHARLES STANLEY with eagerness, -- starts. Miss Vor. How he^s struck!


Vortex. Exceedingly.


Charles. What can this mean? [aside.] Ma -- mad -- madam -- the confusion that
-- that -- that --


Miss Vor. I must cheer him with a smile. ( During this ELLEN advances to the
front of the stage so as to leave Miss V^RTEX between her and STANLEY.)


Charles [ seeing ELLEN]. Ah! what heaven of brightness breaks in upon me!
Lovely Miss Vortex, can I believe my happiness? Will those arms receive me?
(Miss VORTEX, thinking this addressed to her, opens her arms; STANLEY rushes
past her to ELLEN) My Ellen!


Ellen. Oh* Charles* the sufferings my heart underwent this moment and the joy
it now feels is such, I cannot speak. (They retire.)


Miss Vor. Nabob! Nabob!


Vortex. What Is the matter?


Miss Vor. The matter! will not you resent this?


Vortex. Oh dear! not I.


Miss Vor. Will you bear an insult?


Vortex. My physicians order me not to mind being insulted at all; nothing is
to provoke me.


Miss Vor. Provoke you! -- If I were a man I would -- Oh!


Vortex. I don't like his looks -- he seems a desperate --


Miss Vor. What do you mean to do?


Vor. Why* as this is a very extraordinary case --


Miss Vor. Certainly


Vortex. I think it best to -- adjourn (goes up the stage, Miss VORTEX follows).


STANLEY and ELLEN come forward. Charles. I perceive the mistake; but my heart
confessed but one Miss Vortex. -- I thought the name, like the superior virtues
you adorn it with attached alone to Ellen. The embarrassments of my paternal
estate demanded a marriage with a woman of fortune.


Ellen. What do I hear?


Charles. Why this alarm?


Ellen Alarm! Must not those words terrify which separate me from you for ever?


Charles. What means my Ellen?


Ellen. Oh, Stanley, hear me On my return to England, Mr. Vortex, to whom the
care of my property was entrusted, was ever pressing on my mind the difficulty
of recovering my father's India possessions. Each messenger that arrived from
you, confirmed the melancholy tale* that my Stanley was sinking into an early
grave. Oh! what then was fortune or the world to me? I sought out solitude, and
willingly (...) to Mr Vortex what he called my expectations, (...) thousand
pounds.


Charles. Yet you shall be mine.


Ellen. No, Charles, I will not bring you poverty. I Will return to solitude and
endeavor to teach this lesson to my heart, that it will be joy enough to know
that Stanley is we^l and happy, ( Going)


Charles. Stay, Ellen -- think deeply before you consign the man that loves you
to certain misery.


Ellen. True -- in a few hours let me see you again. The opposing agitations my
mind has suffered unfit me for further conversation.


Charles. In a few hours, then, you will allow me to see you?


Ellen. Allow you to see me! -- Oh! Stanley, farewell! Exit.


Mr. and Miss VORTEX come forward. Miss Vor. Now speak.


Vortex. We had better pair off.


Miss Vor. No -- speak with spirit.


Vortex. I will -- Sir, I cannot help saying, that every man* that is, every
man of honor --


Miss Vor. That^s right! -- say that again.


Vortex. That every man of honor ( raising his voice).


Charles. Well, sir?


Vortex. Is -- is -- the -- the -- best judge of his own actions.


Charles. I perfectly agree with you -- and wish you a good morning. Exit.


Miss Vor. So, then, I Am to be insulted, despised and laugh^d at, and no duel
is to take place -- no body is to be killed -- my tender heart is to feel no
satisfaction -- (weeps.)


Vortex. I fight! -- Do you consider the preciousness of a legislator's life?

"A country suffers when a Member bleeds."


Enter BRONZE. Bronze. Oh, sir, such news!


Vortex. What! is parliament convened?


Bronze. No, sir; but I have found out that the Baronet is --


Vortex. What of him?


Bronze. Ruined!


Miss Vor. ( drying her eyes.) Well! that is some satisfaction.


Bronze. I met at the inn the Mr. Rapids, merchants I (...) lived with, who
have a large mortgage on his estate, and he wants to borrow more -- So, sir, I
told them I was sure my master would be proud to see them at Bangalore H^^l,
because I thought, sir --


Vortex. I know -- I have it. I Will show them every attention; and if I can but
get hold of the mortgage, I Will --


Miss Vor Oh! uncommon charming!


Vortex ( to Miss VORTEX). Now do you go and write a note, and say we will wait
on them. -- Ah! use policy instead of pistols, and I would fight any man --
for, as I say in my speech, "Policy, Mr. Speaker, is -- "


Miss Vor. Exactly, Nabob -- but I must write the letter, you know. Is the
young merchant handsome?


Bronze. Yes, madam.


Miss Vor. So much the better. Exit.


Vortex. You see, Bronze, the turn I give it is this -- "Policy, Mr. Speaker*
says I -- "


Bronze. Very true, sir; but I believe my mistress calls -- I attend you,
madam. Exit.


Vortex. Confound it! Will nobody hear my speech? then I Will speak it to myself.
-- "Policy Mr. Speaker -- "


Enter FRANK. Frank. How do you do, sur.


Vortex. What! interrupted again? -- Approach, don't be afraid.


Frank. Lord, sur, I bean't afeard: Why should I? -- I defies the devil and all
his works.


Vortex. If this be what is called rough honesty, give me a little
smooth-tongu'd roguery. I don't know you, fellow!


Frank. Ees, sur, you do -- I be's Frank Oatland.


Vortex. Begone! I know nothing of you.


Frank. Ees, sur, you do -- I Have a bit of a sister called Jessy.


Vortex. Eh! ah!


Frank (aside). Dom um, he knaws me well enough now.


Vortex. Oh! very true -- Frank Oatland, aye! Well, good Frank* how is Jessy?


Frank. Charming sur! charming!


Vortex. Aye, that she is, lovely and charming, indeed! (aside). -- And how are
you, Frank?


Frank. I be's charming too, sur!


Vortex. But why don't Jessy visit my people here? I should be always happy to
see her.


Frank. Should you, sur? Why, if I may be so bold as (...) ax, why, sur?


Vortex. Because -- because -- she is -- a -- farmer Oatland's child.


Frank. So be I, sur How comes it, then, that you never axes I to your balls
and ostentations? I can dance twice as long as sister can.


Vortex. Cunning fellow this! -- I must buy him. Well, Frank, what are your
commands?


Frank. Why, sur, Feyther do command you to lend him three hundred pounds --
no, sur, I mean he supplicates.


Vortex* Three hundred pounds!


Frank I Will tell you, sur, all about it. -- You know, sur, Feyther have been
knuckled out of a most cruel sight of money by you at weagering and cards.


Vortex. By me fellow! Do you think I associate with such reptiles?


Frank. Ecod it was either you or the other gentleman.


Vortex. The Other gentleman!


Frank. I dan't know which be which, not I. -- There be two of you.


Vortex. Two of us!


Frank. Ees; there be you -- that be one; -- and there be your gentleman -- he
do make the pair.


Vortex. The pair! -- and have I been buying a hundred thousand pounds worth of
respect for this? Have I become a Member to pair off with my valet?


Frank. Ecod, and a comical pair you be! -- The Other gentleman be's a tightish,
conceated sort of a chap enough; -- but you be a little -- he! he! (smothering
a laugh).


Vortex. Upon my soul, this is very pleasant -- You are quite free and easy.


Frank. Quite, sur; quite. Feyther do tell I it be all the fashion.


Vortex. He does! Then you may tell Feyther, that if he has lost his money at
play, the winners will not give him sixpence to save him from starving, and that
be all the fashion. -- By their distress the pretty Jessy will be more in my
power, and then I can reinstate them in a farm upon terms (aside.) Go, fellow!
I shall not send your Father sixpence.


Frank. The words I told um -- the very words I told um. -- Says I -- "Feyther
he bean't the man will gi' thee a brass fa^thing. Dong it, he hasn't it here,
says I" (laying his (...) upon his heart).


Vortex You said so* did you?


Frank. Ees -- so you see, sur, what a desperate cute lad I be.


Vortex. (aside). I^ll set a trap for you, you dog -- I Will have you in my
power, however; I^ll drop my purse -- he will take it -- and then -- (drops his
purse) -- A pair of us! I Will lay you by the heels, desperate cute as you are.
Exit


Frank Poor Feyther, poor sister, and poor I! Feyther will go broken hearted,
for ^artain; -- and then, sister Jessy's coming to labor. -- I cannot bear the
thought on (...) Od dom thee if I could but get hold of some of thy money I^d
teak care thee should not get it again -- Eh! (se^s the purse, walks round it)
Well, now, I declare that do look for all the world like a purse How happy it
would make poor Feyther and sister* I conceates there wou^d be no harm just to
touch it; -- (takes it up with caution;) it be cruel tempting. Nobody do see I
-- I wonder how it wou^d feel in my pocket (puts it with fear into his pocket).
Wouns! how hot I be! Cruel warm to be sure. Who Is that? Nobody. -- Oh! l -- l
-- l-u-d, lud! and I have gotten such a desperate ague all of a sudden, -- and
my heart do keep j -- jump -- jumping -- I believe I be going to die (falls
into a chair) Eh! -- Eh! -- Mayhap it be this terrible purse. Dom thee, come
out (throws it down -- After a pause) Ees, now I is better. -- Dear me, quite
an alteration. -- My head doant spin about soa, and my heart do feel as light,
and do so keep tittuping, tittuping, I cannot help crying.


Enter VORTEX. Vortex. Now I have him. -- ( Sees the purse). What, he has not
stole it, though his own Father's in want! -- Here Is a precious rascal for you!


Frank. Mr. Nabob, you have left your purse behind you (sobbing); and you ought
to be asheamed of yourself, so you ought, to leave a purse in a poor lad^s way,
who has a Feyther and a Sister coming to starving.


Vortex. My purse! True; reach in me.


Frank. Noa, thank you for nothing -- I Have had it my hand once. -- Ecod, if
having other people^s money do make a man so hot, how desperate warm some folks
mun be!


Vortex. Warm. -- foolish fellow* (wiping his forehead, and fanning himself
with his hat) Fugh! quite a Bengal day, I declare.


Frank. Od dang it! how their wicked heads (...) round!


Vortex. Spin round! I never heard such a simpleton. -- Spin, indeed! ha! ha!
God bless my soul, I Am quite giddy! Oh Lord! Oh dear me! Help! help!


Enter BRONZE. Bronze. What Is the matter, sir.


Vortex. Only a little touch of my old complaint. -- Send that fellow away.
[BRONZE goes up to FRANK.]


Frank. Oh, this be the other gent^eman. Sur, I have gotten twenty-six pound that
Feyther lost to you at gamestering.


Bronze. Where is it?


Frank. In my pocket.


Bronze That Is lucky! give it me.


Frank. Gi' it thee! Ees, dom thee, come out, and I Will gi' it thee (clenching
his fist.)


Vortex. Begone!


Frank. Gentlemen, I wish you both a good morning.


Exit. Vortex (getting up.) What a dunderhead that is! To suppose that a little
tenderness of conscience would make a man's head turn round. -- Pugh! it is
impossible; -- or how the devil wou^d the Lawyers find their way from
Westminsterhall? Giddy, indeed! Ha! ha! -- Bronze, take care I don't fall.
Exit, leaning on BRONZE.


ACT III.
SCENE I. -- A Room in an Inn.
Enter OLD RAPID with a Letter, and a Servant following. O Rap. What! a real
letter from the real Nabob -- Dear me! where is Neddy? -- Make my humble duty
to your master; proud to serve him -- no -- very proud to see him; -- grateful
for the honor of his custom -- no -- no -- for his company. -- I wish you a
pleasant walk home sir -- The Nabob coming here directly. Oh dear me! where is
Neddy? -- Waiter! Exit Servant.

Enter Waiter. Do you know where my boy is?


Waiter Not a minute ago I saw him fighting in a field behind the house


Enter YOUNG RAPID -- his Coat torn. O. Rap. Fighting! -- Oh, dear where is he?


Y. Rap. Here am I, dad. --


O. Rap. What has been the matter?


Y* Rap* Only a small rumpus; -- went to peep at the castle, -- pushing home,
-- the road had a bit of a circumbendibus -- hate corners, -- so I jumped the
hedge -- cut right across, -- you know my way, -- kept moving, -- up came a
farmer, -- wanted to turn me back, -- would not do, -- tussled a bit -- carried
my point, -- came straight as an arrow.


O. Rap. Fie, fie! -- But read that letter.


Y. Rap. What! the Nabob coming her directly, and I in this pickle. -- Waiter,
are my c^othes come home?


Waiter No, sir.


Y. Rap. Why, the fel^ow gave his word --


Waiter. Yes, sir; -- but what can you expect from a tailor? Exit.


Y. Rap. That Is very true.


O. Rap. Impudent rascal!


Y Rap. What the devil shall I do? The most important moment of my life. --


O Rap. It Is unlucky.


Y. Rap Unlucky? -- It Is perdition -- annihilation -- a misfortune, that --


O. Rap. I can mend.


Y. Rap. How?


O. Rap. By mending the coat.


Y. Rap. An excellent thought. -- Come help me off* -- quick, -- quick!


O Rap ^ always have a needle in my pocket.


Y Rap. (rubbing his back.) I know you have.


O. Rap Now give it me.


Y Rap. What! suffer my Father to mend my coat? -- No, -- no; -- not so bad as
that neither. -- As the coat must be mended, -- damn it, I^ll mend it.


O Rap Will you tho? -- Ecod, I should like to see you; -- here is a needle
ready threaded -- and a thimble; -- you cannot think how I shall like to see
you; -- don^t hurry, that^s a dear boy [YOUNG RAPID sits down, gathers his legs
under him -- OLD RAPID puts his spectacles on and sits close to him, looking on]


Y. Rap Now mind, dad, when -- Damn the needle!

[wounds his fingers.]
O Rap. That^s because you are in such a hurry.


Y Rap When the Nabob comes, -- sink the tailor. --


O. Rap. I will; -- but that^s a long stitch.


Y. Rap. Be sure you sink the tailor; -- a great deal depends on the first
impression; -- you shall be reading a grave book with a melancholy air.


O. Rap. Then I wish I had brought down my book of bad debts; -- that would
have made me melancholy enough.


Enter Mr. and Miss VORTEX, who advance slowly, the Nabob the side where YOUNG
RAPID is, Miss VORTEX to the other side. Y. Rap. I. -- ha! ha! I say, dad, if
the Nabob was to see us now, -- ha! ha!


O. Rap. Ha! ha! True; -- but mind what you're about.


Y. Rap. I Will be discovered in a situation that will surprise -- a striking
situation, and in some damned elegant attitude [ looks up and sees the Nabob.]


O. Rap. Why don^t you finish the job! -- why don't you? ( sees the Nabob) -- (
They look round the other way and see Miss VORTEX; they both appear ashamed and
dejected; YOUNG RAPID draws his legs from under him.)


Vortex Gentlemen, -- I and my daughter, Miss Vortex, have done ourselves the
honor of waiting upon you, to --


Miss Vor But I beg we may not interrupt your amusement; -- it is uncommon
whimsical!


Y Rap. ( recovering himself.) Yes ma'am, very whimsical, -- I must keep moving
[laughs] Ha! ha! You see, dad. 've won, -- I^ve won -- ha! ha!


Miss Vor He says he has won --


O Rap. (with amazement.) Oh! he has won, has he?


Y Rap. Yes, you know I Have won; he! he! why don't you laugh? ( aside to OLD
RAPID).


O. Rap. with difficulty. Ha he!


Y Rap. You see, ma^am the fact is, -- I had torn my coat; so says I to my
father, I^ll bet my bays against your opera box that I mend it; and so -- ha!
ha! ( to OLD RAPID) laugh again.


O Rap. I cannot -- indeed I cannot.


Y. Rap And so I -- I won -- upon my soul I was doing it very well.


O. Rap. No, you were not, -- you were doing it a shame to be seen


Y. Rap. (apart) Hush! -- Ah* father you don't like to lose.


Vortex We^l, gentlemen, now this very extraordinary frolic is over --


Y. Rap. Yes, sir, -- it is quite over, -- (aside) thank Heaven!


Vortex. Suppose we adjourn to Bangalore Hall?


Y. Rap. Sir. I Will go with you directly with all the pleasure in life [running]


Miss Vor I believe my curricle is the first carriage.


O. Rap. Dear me! [ looking at Miss VORTEX.]


Vortex. My daughter seems to please you, sir.


O. Rap. What a shape!


Miss Vor. Oh, sir, you're uncommon polite.


Y. Rap. He Is remarkably gallant, ma'am.


O. Rap. What elegance! -- what fashion! -- upon the whole, it is the best made
little spencer I Have seen for some time. (VORTEX and Daughter in amazement.)


Y. Rap. Oh, the devil! -- The fact is, ma'am, my father is the most particular
man on earth about dress -- the beau of his time -- Beau Rapid. -- You know,
father, they always called you Beau Rapid. -- I dare say he is had more suits of
clothes in his house than any man in England.


Miss Vor. An uncommon expensive whim!


Y. Rap. I don't think his fortune has suffered by it.


Miss Vor. ( to OLD RAPID). Shall I have the honor of driving you?


O Rap. Oh, madam, I cannot think of giving you so much trouble as to drive me.


Miss Vor. My dear sir* -- I shall be uncommon happy!


O. Rap. Oh, madam! (simpers and titters to his son, then takes Miss VORTEX 's
hand and trots off).


Vortex. We'll follow.


Y. Rap. If you please; -- not that I particularly like to follow.


Vortex. I suppose sir, now summer approaches, London begins to fill for the
winter.


Y. Rap. Yes, sir.


Vortex. Any thing new in high life? -- what is the present rage with ladies of
fashion?


Y. Rap. Why, sir, as to the ladies; -- ( aside) What shall I say? -- Oh, the
ladies, sir -- why, heaven bless them, (...)! they -- they keep moving; -- but,
to confess the truth, sir; my fashionable education has been very much
neglected.


Vortex. That Is a pity.


Y. Rap. Very great pity, sir.


Vortex. Suppose I become your preceptor.


Y. Rap. If you would be so kind -- I would treasure any little short rule.


Vortex. Why there is a short rule necessary for every man of fashion to attend
to.


Y. Rap. What is it?


Vortex. Never to reflect.


Y. Rap. Never reflect! -- what, push on -- keep moving! -- My dear sir --
that is my way -- suits me exactly.


Vortex. Then you must be known.


Y. Rap. To be sure; -- I Will give away thousands in charities.


Vortex. Charities! -- You would be forgot in a week. -- To be known, you must
be mischievous; -- malice has a much better memory than gratitude; -- and then
you must be gallant. -- Are there no pretty girls you should like to be well
with, eh?


Y. Rap. A very extensive assortment, sir.


Vortex. And perhaps there may be a married woman you would like to intrigue
with.


Y. Rap A very large quantity. -- Oh, how I long to begin! -- Are you married,
sir!


Vortex. Why, no!


Enter Servant. Servant. The carriage is ready.


Y. Rap. So am I; come, sir, -- four horses, I hope.


Vortex. No, sir.


Y. Rap. That Is a great pity. Pray, sir, will you have the goodness to tell
your coachman to drive like the devil?


Vortex. Sir* to oblige you.


Y. Rap. Sir, I ll be very much obliged to you.


Enter Waiter. Waiter. Your clothes are come, sir.


Y. Rap. That Is lucky.


Vortex. Then I ll wait for you.


Y. Rap. Wait for me! nobody need wait for me -- I ll be with you in a crack --
Do you push on -- I ll keep moving -- I ll take care nobody waits for me.
Exeunt severally.


SCENE II. -- A Room in the Nabob's House.
Enter OATLAND dejected, FRANK and JESSY leading him. Iessy. Be comforted,
Father.


Oat. To see thee brought to service! ( sighs). -- I Have done this; I that
should have --


Frank Never mind -- we be young and healthy, and don't heed it -- do us, Jessy?


Oat. To be asham^d to look my own chi^dren in the face -- I, who ought to have
been the fore-horse of the team, to be pulled along through life by this young
tender thing!


Iessy. Don^t despond, Father -- Sir Hubert will see your contrition, and
restore you to his favor.


Oat. When the hen sees the hawk ready to pounce, she gather's her young ones
under her wing -- when misfortune hovers over my sweet chicken here, I leave
her to shift for herself.


Iessy. Come, no more of this


Oat Even the savage hawk takes care of its nestlings -- what then am I? --
Children, do you hate me?


Frank. Hate thee! pugh, Feyther, dan't thee talk so -- good bye to thee --
cheer up -- Thee has long been a Feyther to me, now it^s my turn, and I Will be a
Feyther to thee.


Oat. I cannot speak -- take care of my girl, Frank. Exit.


Frank. Care of her! -- though she be a sarvant, let me catch any body striking
her, that is all. -- Well* Jessy, we mun not be sheam'd -- I know poverty be no
sin, because parson said so last Sunday. Talk of that -- I do hear that your
sweetheart, Mr. Rapid, be worth such a desperate sight of money as never was!


Iessy ( sighs). If his fortunes are so prosperous, brother, he is exa^ted
above my hopes -- if his heart be mercenary, he is sunk below my wishes. --
Heigh-ho! yet he might have sent to know if I were well, he might -- no matter!


Frank. He be coming to Neabob's here, on a visitation.


Iessy. Ah! coming here!


Frank. Ees -- and Mr. Bronze do say while he be here I am to be his sarving
man.


Iessy. You his servant! ( weeps).


Frank. Don't thee cry, Jessy!


Iessy. ( recovering herself). I will not; it was weak, it was wrong. -- Frank* be
sure you conceal from Mr. Rapid who you are -- I have reasons for it. -- Edward
here! -- when we meet it will be a hard trial. Yet why should I dread it? --
let perfidy and pride shrink abashed, virtuous integrity will support me.


Frank. That Is right. Jessy, show a proper spirit -- Ecod, if he were to pull
out his purse and to offer to make thee a present of five guineas, don't thee
take it. -- (JES^Y smiles dejectedly.) -- Here be the new mistress.


Iessy. Leave me.


Frank. Do thou hear? Dom it, dant't thee take it!

Exit.
Enter Miss VORTEX. Miss Vor. Oh! my new attendent, I suppose! -- What Is your
name, child.


Iessy Jessy Oatland, Madam.


Miss Vor. We^l, Oatland, ( taking out (...) glass,) look at me. -- Umph -- not
at all contemptible. -- That Is a charming nosegay -- ^JESSY presents it) -- all
exotics, I declare.


Iessy. No, Madam, neglected with wild flowers -- I took them from the bed of
weeds, bestowed care on their culture, and, by transplanting them to a more
genial soil, they have flourished with luxuriant strength and beauty.


Miss Vor. A pretty amusement.


Iessy. And it seem^d, madam* to convoy this lession -- Nor to despise the
lowly mind, but rather, with fostering hand to draw it from its chill
obscurity, that, like those humble flowers* it might grow rich in (...) native
energy


Miss Vor. Oh! ( aside) -- mind energy! -- What Is the* matter with the poor
girl I wonder! uncommon odd! -- I hear, Oat and you are reduced in your
circumstances.


Iessy. Yes, madam.


Mis^ Vor. That^s very lucky, because it will make you humb^e, child! -- Well,
and what are your qualifications?


Iessy. Cheerful industry, madam. I can read to you, write for you, or converse
--


Miss Vor. Converse with me! I dare say you can. -- No, thank you, child
instead of my listening to your voice, you will be polite enough to be as
silent as convenient* and do me the honor of listening to mine -- Oh! here
comes Mr Rapid.


Iessy. Ah! ( in great agitation); May I retire, madam?


M^ss Vor. Yes; I shall follow to dress. No, stay. Yes, you may go.


Iessy Oh, thank you! thank you, dear madam!

Exit, with rapidity.
Miss Vor. That poor girl appears to me rather crazy.


Enter OLD and YOUNG RAPID, and VORTEX. Miss Vor. Welcome to Bangalore Hall,
gentlemen.


Y Rap. Charming house! plenty of room! -- ( Runs about and looks at every
thing)


O. Rap. A very spacious apartment, indeed.


Vortex. Yes, sir; but I declare I forgot the dimensions of this room.


O. Rap. Sir, if you please, I ll measure it -- my cane is exactly a yard, good
honest measure -- it is handy -- and that mark is the half yard, and --


Y. Rap. ( Overhears, and snatches the cane from him.) Confound it! -- The
pictures, father -- look at the pictures ( pointing with the cane;) did you
ever see such charming --


Miss Vor. Do you like pictures?


Y. Rap. Exceedingly, ma'am; but I should like them a great deal better if they
just moved a little.


Miss Vor. Ha! ha! I must retire to dress -- till dinner, gentlemen, adieu.
Exit.


Y. Rap. ( to his Father.) Zounds! you will ruin every thing! -- Cannot you keep
the tailor under.


Vortex. Your son seems rather impatient.


O. Rap. Very, sir -- always was. -- I remember a certain Duke --


Y. Rap. That Is right, lay the scene high; push the Duke; push him as far as
he will go.


O. Rap. I will, I will. -- I remember a certain Duke used to say, Mr. Rapid,
your son is as sharp as a needle.


Y. Rap. At it again!


O. Rap. As a needle --


Y. Rap. ( interrupting him.) Is true to the pole. As a needle is true to the
pole, says the Duke; so will your son, says the Duke, be to every thing
spirited and fashionable, says the Duke. -- Am I always to be tortured with
your infernal needles? ( aside to OLD RAPID.)


Vortex. Now to sound them. -- I hear, gentlemen, your business in this part of
the country is with Sir Hubert Stanley, respecting some money transactions.


O. Rap. It Is a secret, sir.


Vortex. Oh! no -- the Baronet avows his wish to sell his estate.


O. Rap. Oh! that alters the case.


Vortex. I think that it would be a desirable purchase for you -- I should be
happy in such neighbors -- and if you should want forty or fifty thousand,
ready money, I Will supply it with pleasure.


O. Rap. Oh, Sir, how kind! -- If my son wishes to purchase, I would rather
leave it entirely to him.


Y. Rap. And I would rather leave it entirely to you.


Vortex. Very well, I Will propose for it^ -- ( aside) This will cut Sir Hubert
to the soul. -- There is a very desirable borough interest -- then you could
sit in Parliament.


Y. Rap. I in Parliament? ha! ha!


O. Rap. No; that would be a botch.


Y. Rap. No* no, I was once in the gallery -- crammed in -- no moving --
expected to hear the great guns -- up got a litt^e fellow, nobody knew who,
gave us a three hours speech -- I got devilish fidgetty -- the House called for
the question, I joined the cry -- "The question, the question!" says I -- A
Member spied me -- cleared the gallery -- got hustl'd by my brother spectators
-- obliged to scud -- Oh! it would never do for me.


Vortex. But you must learn patience.


Y. Rap. Then make me Speaker -- if that would not teach me patience, nothing
would.


Vortex. Do you dislike, sir, Parliamentary eloquence?


O. Rap. Sir, I never heard one of your real downright Parliament speeches in
my life -- never (yawns).


Y. Rap. By your yawning I should think you had heard a great many.


Vortex. Oh, how lucky! -- At last I shall get my dear speech spoken. -- Sir* I
am a Member, and I mean to --


Y. Rap. Keep moving.


Vortex Why, I mean to speak, I assure you; and --


Y. Rap. Push on, then.


Vortex. What, speak my speech? -- That I will -- I Will speak it.


Y. Rap Oh, the devil! -- Don't yawn so -- ( to OLD RAPID).


O. Rap I never get a comfortable nap, never!


Y Rap. You have a dev^lish good chance now -- Confound all speeches -- Oh! --


Vortex Pray be seated -- ( they sit on each side VORTEX) -- Now we'll suppose
that the chair -- ( pointing to a chair) --


O. Rap. Suppose it the chair! why it is a chair, an't it?


Vortex. Pshaw! I mean --


Y. Rap. He knows what you mean -- it is his humor.


Vortex. Oh, he is witty!


Y. Rap. Oh, remarkably brilliant indeed! -- (significantly to his Father).


Vortex. What, you are a wit, sir!


O. Rap. A what? Yes, I am -- I am a wit.


Vortex. Well, now I Will begin. -- Oh, what a delicious moment! -- The House
when they approve cry, "Hear him! hear him!" -- I only give you a hint in case
any thing should strike --


Y. Rap. Push on. -- I can never stand it -- (aside).


Vortex. Now I shall charm them -- ( addresses the chair). -- "Sir, Had I met
your eye at an earlier hour, I should not have blink'd the present question --
but having caught what has fallen from the other side, I shall scout the idea
of going over the usual ground." -- What! no applause yet? ( aside. -- During
this OLD RAPID has fallen asleep, and YOUNG RAPID, after showing great
fretfulness and impatience, runs to the back scene, throws up the window, and
looks out). -- "But I shall proceed, and, I trust, without interruption" -- (
turns round and sees OLD RAPID asleep).


Vortex. Upon my soul this is -- What do you mean, sir? --

(RAPID awakes.)
O. Rap. What Is the matter? -- Hear him! hear him!


Vortex. Pray, sir, don't you blush -- (sees YOUNG RAPID at the window). --
What the devil! --


Y. Rap. ( looking round) Hear him! hear him!


Vortex. By the soul of Cicero, it is too much.


O. Rap. Oh, Neddy* for shame of yourself to fall asleep! -- I mean to look out
of the window -- I am very sorry, sir, any thing should go across the grain. --
I say, Ned, smooth him down!


Y. Rap. I will -- What the devil shall I say? -- The fact is, sir* I heard a
cry of fire -- upon -- the -- the -- the water, and --


Vortex. Well, well -- But do you wish to hear the end of my speech?


Y. Rap. Upon my honor, I do.


Vortex. Then we'll only suppose this little interruption a message from the
Lords, or something of that sort. -- (They sit, YOUNG RAPID fretful.)


Vortex. Where did I leave off?


Y. Rap. Oh! I recollect; at -- "I therefore briefly concluded with moving --
an Adjournment" -- ( ris^ng.)


Vortex. Nonsense! no such thing -- ( putting him down in the chair). -- Oh I
remember! "I shall therefore proceed, and, I trust, without interruption -- "


Enter Servant. Serve. Dinner's on the table, sir.


Vortex. Get out of the room, you villain! -- "Without interruption -- "


Serve. I say, sir --


Y. Rap Hear him! hear him!


Serve. Dinner is waiting.


Y. Rap. (jumping up) Dinner waiting! -- Come along, sir.


Vortex. Never mind the dinner.


Y. Rap. But I like it smoking.


O. Rap So do I -- Be it ever so little, let me have it hot.


Vortex Will Not you hear my speech?


Y. Rap. To be sure we will -- but now to dinner. -- Come, we'll move together.
Capital speech! Push on, sir. Come along, dad. Push him on, dad. Exeunt,
forcing Vortex out.


SCENE III -- An ancient Hall.
Enter Sir HUBERT, leaning on CHARLES STANLEY. Charles. Take comfort, sir.


Sir Hub. Where shall I find it, boy? To live on my estate, is ruin -- to part
with it, death My heart is twined round it. I Have been the patriarch of my tribe
-- the scourge of the aggressor -- the protector of the injured! Can I forego
these dignities? My old grey-headed servants too, whose only remaining hope is
to lay their bones near their loved master, how shall I part with them? I
prate, boy, but it is the privilege of these white hairs.


Charles. Oh! say on, sir.


Sir Hub. All! all is dear to me! these warlike trophies of my ancestors!
Charles, thou see that goodly oak, 'twas planted at my birth Would thou
think it? In the late hurricane when the tempest humbled with the dust the
proudest of the forest, it bravely met the driving blast -- my people, with
shouts of joy, hail^d the auspicious omen, and augur'd from it prosperity to me
and mine. Fondly I believed it -- fondly I thought it. Fie! fie! I dote --


Charles. My Father, I doubt not but they augur'd truly. I must to the active
world. Why should I fear that the virtue and independence you have inspir^d --


Sir Hub. Ah, boy! but while licentiousness and party zeal command the choicest
gifts of fortune, virtue and genius must be content with their leavings.


Enter Servant -- delivers a Letter to Sir HUBERT, who reads it with great
agitation. Charles. Ah! what i^ it shakes you, sir? -- That letter!


Sir Hub. Nothing, my dear boy! -- it is infirmity! -- I shall soon be better.


Charles. Excuse me, dear sir (takes the letter, and reads.) "Mr. Vortex, at
the request of Mr. Rapid, informs Sir H. Stanley, it is inconvenient to advance
more money on mortgage. Mr. Vortex laments Sir Hubert's pecuniary
embarrassments" -- damnation" -- "to relieve which, he will purchase the castle
and estate." -- Sooner shall its massy ruins crumble me to dust -- Don't
despond, my father: bear up!


Enter FRANK, running -- his face bloody. Frank Oh, sir! At Neabob's table they
have been so abusing your feyther!


Charles. Ah!


Frank. And I Have been fighting --


Charles. Hush!


Sir Hub. What Is his business?


Charles. Oh, sir! (concealing his agitation.) My friend Frank consults me on a
love affair; and I must not betray his confidence -- In his hurry he fell.
Was'nt it so (significantly)?


Frank. Ees, sur, ees.


Sir Hub. You are not hurt, young man?


Frank. No, sur. Thank heaven, my head be a pure hard one.


Charles. Within. (Enter two Servants.) Attend my father.


Sir Hub. My boy, don't stay from me long.

Exit, leaning on Servants.
Charles. Now, good Frank, ease my tortured mind. -- What of my father?


Frank. Why, your honor, Mr Bronze came laughing out of dining room, and says,
"Daame, how the old Baronet had been roasted." So, sur, I not knowing what they
could mean by roasting a Christian, axed. "Why," say^ he, grinning, "they
voted, that it was a pity, the dignity of the bloody hand interfer'd, or the
old beggar might set up a shop."


Charles. What!


Frank. The old beggar might set up a shop.


Charles. Unmanner'd, cowardly babblers!


Frank. And that you sur, would make a dapper 'prentice.


Charles. I heed not that. But, when I forgive a father's wrongs --


Frank. So says I, Domme, if young 'squire had been among them, he would have
knocked all their heads together? Now wouldn^t you, sur, have knocked their
heads together? Then they all laughed at me: which somehow made all the blood
in my body come into my nuckles. So says I, "Mr. Bronze, suppose a case --
suppose me young 'squire Stanley: now, say that again about his honored
father." -- So he did; and I lent him such a drive of the feace. And I was
knocking all their heads together pretty tightish, till the cook laid me flat
wi^ the poker; then they all fell upon me; and when I could fight no longer, I
fell a crying, and run to tell your honor.


Charles. Thanks, my affectionate lad! Return to the Nabob's today.


Frank. I be sartain I shall never do any good there.


Charles. Tomorrow you shall live with me. I shall dismiss all my servants --
my circumstances require it.


Frank What! all but me -- What! I do all the work? -- Lord, Lord, how glad I
be, sur, you cannot afford to keep any body but I.


Charles. Good Frank, farewell! -- Hold -- here (presenting a purse.)


Frank. (refusing). Nay, prayee, sur, dan't you beheave unkind to me -- I be a
poor lad, that do worship and love you -- not a spy for the lucre of gain --
pray use me kindly, and don't gi' me a farding.


Charles. Frank. I beg your pardon. -- Farewell!


Fr. Lord, how glad I be he can only afford to keep I. Ex.


Charles. Insult my father! -- unmanly villain! -- whoever thou art, thy life
shall answer it! Exit.


ACT IV.
SCENE I. -- Enter VORTEX, in great terror, reading a Letter.
Vortex. Dear me! -- here is a terrible affair! (reads) "Give me up the author
of the slander on my father" -- that was myself. I never can find in my heart
to give myself up; "or personally answer the consequences; CHARLES STANLEY." Oh
dear! since I find my words are taken down, I must be more parliamentary in my
language. What shall I do? I cannot fight; my poor head will not bear it; it might
be the death of me.


Y. Rap. (without). Huzza, my fine fellows! Bravo!


Vortex. Eh! egad, a fine thought. Young Rapid is loaded muzzle high with
Champaigne. I Will tell him he said the words, and make him own them. I Have
persuaded him into a marriage with my daughter: after that, the devil's in it if
I cannot persuade him into a duel.


Enter YOUNG RAPID (tipsy). Y. Rap. Here I am tip-top spirits; ripe for any
thing.


Vortex. How did you like my Champaigne?


Y. Rap. Oh! suits me exactly; a man is such a damned long while getting tipsy
with other wine. Champaigne settles the business directly; it has made me --


Vortex. Lively, I see.


Y. Rap. Lively! it has made me like a sky-rocket. Well, how did I behave?
Quite easy was not I? Pushed on -- at every thing -- barred prosing. Jolly dogs
within -- the fat parson's a fine fellow -- kept the bottle moving -- said a
nice short grace.


Vortex. Well, and did you lose at play the five hundred pounds I ent you?


Y. Rap. As easy as could be.


Vortex* That was lucky.


Y. R^p. Very; particularly for those who won it --


Vortex. Well, now you^ll do.


Y Rap. Huzza! I Am a finished man [staggering, and strutting about]


Vortex You only want a quarrel to make you --


Y. Rap. A what? A quarrel. Damme, I Will settle that in two minutes (running
off.)


Vortex. Stop. You need not go out of the room for that.


Y. Rap What! will you quarrel with me, eh? -- With all my heart


Vortex Me! Oh no! -- I say I could get you such fame.


Y Rap. How, my dear fellow? Dash on.


Vortex. Why, at dinner you reflected on the Baronet.


Y. Rap. No, it was you.


Vortex. No, not I.


Y. Rap. Yes, it was you.


Vortex. Well, it might be I; but I don't say it was --


Y. Rap. I do. Push on.


Vortex. Young Stanley has demanded the author. Now, if you were to own the
words -- how the newspapers would teem with -- "The elegant Charles Stanley
was called out by the dashing Young Rapid about some trifle."


Y. Rap. Bravo!


Vortex. Any thing does for a duel now a days. The length of a dancer's great
toe; an election leg of mutton and trimmings.


Y. Rap. Say no more. I Will do it. By heavens no man of fashion shall be more
infamous -- I mean more famous. -- I Will go write to him directly.


Vortex. First take another bottle of Champaigne. You cannot think what a free
dashing style it will give you.


Y. Rap. I will [ going -- returns]. No, I cannot take up this quarrel.


Vortex. Oh dear! Why not? (alarmed.)


Y. Rap. Because I Am sure I Am depriving you of pleasure.


Vor. Oh, don't mind me! I give it you, to show my regard for you. Indeed, I Have
had so much fighting in my time, that with me it really ceases to be a
pleasure; the sweetest things will cloy; so the quarrel's yours. I wash my
hands of it.


Y. Rap. You're a damned good-hearted, generous fellow!


Vor. Then you will return triumphant, and marry my daughter.


Y. Rap. To be sure; keep moving ( going) I hope he will fight directly ^ike a
sailor, I hate a calm, particularly when an enemy's in sight. Hold; what must
we fight with? I can fence.


Vortex You have no objection to pistols and bullets?


Y. Rap I like bullets; they come so quick. But I must push on; the other
bott^e, and then -- I Am a first-rate fe^low -- Champaigne for ever! Exit.


Vortex. You shall have my pistols -- they have never been used ( Enter Miss
VORTEX) Here Is policy. "Crown me, shadow me, with ^aurels." -- Oh my dear, I Have
achieved two such difficult points!


Miss Vor. How, my dear Nabob?


Vortex. In the first place, I Have persuaded Young Rapid to marry you.


Miss Vor. Was that so difficult?


Vortex. No* no, certainly. But the next will delight you. -- Rapid is going to
have an affair of honor with Young Stanley.


Miss Vor. A duel! and about me!


Vortex. Yes* -- ( Aside) I may as well tell her so.


Miss Vor Charming!


Vortex. Now an't I a kind father, to set two young men fighting about you?


Miss Vor. Ah! that is, indeed, acting like a parent?


Vortex Egad, I must look after Rapid, though.


Miss Vor. But how did you manage it?


Vortex By policy to be sure: for, as I observe in my speech -- 'Policy is -- "


Miss Vor. And a very good observation it is.


Vortex How do you know, till you hear it? -- "Policy -- "


Miss Vor But Pray go to Mr Rapid (pushing him off)


Vortex. "Po^icy -- '


Miss Vor. Nay, ^ must insist -- [ Exit. VORTEX]. Oh delightful! -- Oatland!

Enter JESSY. -- I^m in such uncommon spirits, Oatland!


Iessy. May ^ inquire the cause madam?


Miss Vor Certainly. A duel is going to be fought about me.


Iessy. A due^ -- Horrible thought!


Miss Vor. Sensibi^ity* I vow! Too comic, a vast deal! Ha! ha! cottage pathos
must proceed from a source unknow to me, I^m sure!


Iessy. It proceeds, madam, from the heart.


Miss Vor. Umph! -- Let me have no more of it (sharply)


Iessy I beg your pardon -- I forgot the extent of a servant's duty* -- I
forgot that servants have no right to feel pleasure or pain, but as their
employers please; and that suppressing the sensibilities of Nature is
considered in their wages (sarcastically).


Miss Vor. No doubt of it. -- That Is so very sensibly observed, that I Will
forgive you Oatland. -- The pride of Young Stanley will be so humbled --


Iessy. Is the safety of that noble youth implicated?


Miss Vor. What -- A lover, I suppose -- came to the farm, I warrant --
attended Miss Jessy in the dairy -- ruffl'd the cream with his sighs -- talked
of Arcadia, and sipped butter-milk -- Ha! ha! I should not wonder, after what
I Have seen of his taste -- Yes, he is implicated -- I dare say Mr. Rapid will --
( going).


Iessy. Heavens! Is Edward ( catching hold of a chair for support).


Miss Vor. Edward!


Iessy. I mean, Madam, ( trembling, and curtesying), is Mr. Rapid^s life
involved?


Miss Vor Upon my honor, you seem to have an uncommon sensibility for all
mankind! -- Do you mean to sit down in my presence? Exit Miss VORTEX.


Iessy. No, madam! (sinks down in the chair.) Oh, Edward! unkind as thou art,
how gladly would I resign my life, to save thee! (weeps).


Enter ELLEN. Ellen. In tears, Jessy? Sweet girl, tell me --


Iessy. Oh madam! the most dreadful event is about to take p^ace. Mr. Stanley
is engaged in a duel with --


Ellen. Forbid it, Heaven. -- Let us fly to his Father: he may prevent it.


Iessy. Alas, madam! I fear he regards not his father's injunctions.


Ellen. Not regard his Father! Who, child?


Iessy. Mr. Rapid, madam!


Ellen. Mr. Rapid?


Iessy Oh! ( hiding her face)


Ellen. Is it so, sweet Jessy? But has he deserved thy love? Is he not unkind?


Iessy. Oh! true, madam! But is not his life in danger?


Ellen. We will not lose a moment. Let us seek Sir Hub.


Iessy. I Am very faint.


Ellen. I Will support thee; for in addition to the oppression of our common
grief, thou, sweet girl, must bear the agonising weight of disappointed love.
Come, rest on my arm.

Exeunt, ELLEN supporting JESSY.


SCENE II. -- Another Apartment in VORTEX'S House.
Enter YOUNG RAPID, followed by FRANK, who carries Pistols, a Sword, and
Champaigne. Y. Rap. Got the pistols, eh?


Frank. Here they be [ lays them down]. Your Feather were axing for you sur.


Y. Rap. My father! Should any thing happen -- when I reflect -- Reflect?
Zounds, that will not do. Some Champaigne! ( singing) "If a man can then die much
bolder with brandy" ( drinks). I Will write to him, however; a few words on a
scrap of paper may cheer him ( takes a letter out of his pocket, and is about
to tear a piece of it off). What! reads "Dear Edward, your faithful Jessy
Oatland" ( strikes his head.) Jessy Oat^and! What a scoundrel I am! ^ kisses
the letter.) Oh, Jessy, what an infernal pain at my heart! -- More Champaigne!


Enter Servant. Servant. A letter, sir, from Young Stanley.


Y. Rap. Then the die is cast ( Reads) "You are a scoundrel; meet me
immediately, or," -- Um, um, a decisive short letter enough. Damn this pain.
Quick! my pistols! Take them to Stanley Park: there wait for me. -- Oh, Jessy!


Enter OLD RAPID, at the back Scene. Frank. Ecod, he will kill thee. I Will lay
half-a-crown 'Squire Stanley hits thee the first shot.


Exit FRANK, with the pistols. O. Rap. ( coming forward.) Pistols -- kill
Stanley? Ned, tell me --


Y. Rap. ( aside). My father here. Oh, sir, nothing. Come, drink.


O. Rap. Look at me. Ah, that agitation! Tell me the cause! A parent commands
you. Your old doting father entreats it!


Y. Rap. ( aside.) I must deceive him. Sir, I Have received an insu^t, that no
gentleman of fashion can submit to.


O. Rap Gent^eman of fashion! -- Need a man resent it!


Y Rap. Read that letter, and judge.


O. Rap. Lack-a-day! Consider you're only a taylor's son. [Reads.] "You're a
scoundrel." -- That Is a hard word --


Y. Rap. Would you have me submit to be called scoundrel?


O. Rap. No, I would not -- [with tears.] Yes, I would.


Y. Rap. Sir, you don't feel like a man.


O. Rap. I Am sure I feel like a father!


Y. Rap. Read on, sir.


O Rap. ( reads.) 'And unless' ( wipes the tears away) 'unless' -- I cannot --


Y. Rap. (takes the letter and reads.) "And unless you immediately give me the
satisfaction of a gentleman, expect the chastisement due to a coward."


O. Rap. Chastisement! Chastisement! Coward! ( with irritation.) We are flesh
and blood, Ned.


Y. Rap. Wou^d you see me spurned?


O. Rap. [emphatically, and running into his son's arms.] No!


Y. Rap. Pray leave me, sir.


O. Rap. Where shall I go? -- What shall I do? -- What will become of me? Oh,
boy, try to avoid it. Remember your o^d fat^er, -- remember his life hangs on
yours. But, Ned -- don't forget you're a man!


Y. Rap. Pray leave me, sir.


O. Rap. I will. Farewell, my dear boy, 'twill break my old heart But remember
you're a man, Ned.


Y. Rap. [alone.] So, I^m proceeding full tilt to murder; have planted a dagger
in a kind father's heart. But here goes ( fills wine: throws away the bottle
and glass.) Its power is gone. Oh! This infernal pain! Could I with honor
avoid? ( looking at the letter) Chastisement! Coward! Damnation! I must push
on. Fool! Dolt! Villain that I am! Exit.


SCENE III -- A retired place in Stanley Park.
Enter Sir HUBERT STANLEY. Sir Hub. What can it mean? -- Charles parted from me
in an agony the ingeniousness of his nature had not art to conceal; -- he
grasped my hand, -- bade me farewell, as if it were for ever -- then broke away
-- ^eaving me a prey to wi^d conjecture and despair; -- soon shall I be at
peace, -- infirmity, when goaded on by sorrow, presses to the goal of life with
doub^ed speed. -- Sure'y through that laurel grove, I see two female figures
g^ide along? my eyes are not of the best, and the sorrow I have felt for my
dear boy has not strengthened them; -- they approach. --


Enter ELLEN and JESSY. Ellen. Pardon, Sir Hubert, this intrusion. My name, sir
is Ellen Vortex.


Sir Hub. Madam, I welcome you as my daughter.


Ellen. Oh, sir! the urgency of the moment will not allow me to thank such
goodness as I ought; your son, sir --


Sir Hub. Ah! What of him?


Ellen. I saw him pass along -- he fled from my outstretch'd arms -- was deaf
to my cries -- even now he is engaged in a duel.


Sir Hub. Ha! (draws his sword and is running out, slaggers* drops his sword.
-- ELLEN and JESSY support him) My functions are suspended! -- Oh nature! do
thou desert me at this moment? -- Who is the vi^^ain that has caused it?


Iessy Ah, my poor Edward!


Sir Hub. Oh that I could rush before my child, and receive the fatal ball in
this old broken heart! -- Perhaps -- dreadful thought -- even now the deadly
tube is evelled at his manly breast ( The report of a pistol is heard -- ELLEN
sinks into his arms.) Bear up I cannot support thee. (Another pistol is
discharged) -- Horrible suspense! -- what a deathlike silence!


Ellen. Death* -- Oh, my adored Charles!


Iessy. Ah, my poor Edward!


Frank. without. Huzza! huzza! ( enters) Huzza! -- He Is safe -- he is safe. --


All. Who? --


Frank. 'Squire Char^es -- Squire Charles, -- Huzza!


( Exit -- Sir H. folds his hands on his breast in silent gratitude.) Iessy.
Ah, my poor Edward!

thy sorrows! -- Take comfort, sweet girl! -- perhaps --


Enter OLD RAPID, capering. O. Rap. Tol de roll lol -- Safe and sound -- safe

Iessy. Who?


O Rap. My boy Neddy, -- my darling Neddy, safe and sound, -- tol de roll ^ol.
Sees Sir HUBERT, and bows respectfully. JESSY and ELLEN talk apart.


Sir Hub. So, Mr. Rapid! -- How happened this, sir?


O. Rap. Really. Sir Hubert, I don't understand the cut of it; all I can say
is* your son's behavior was -- oh -- super-fine; -- when they had fired their
pistols -- they drew out their swords* and your son disarm^d Neddy, and then he
generously gave him his sword again, which was extremely genteel. -- for it was
a brand new silver-hilted sword and, I suppose by the laws of honor, he might
have kept it. --


Sir Hub. Mr. Rapid, why did you break your appointment?


O. Rap. Mr. Vortex, sir --


Sir Hub. Mr. Vortex. -- I fear your son has selected an imprudent preceptor.


O. Rap. Chose a bad pattern you think, sir? -- I am afraid he has. --


Sir Hub. Will you, sir, favor me with a few minute's conversation?


O. Rap You know, Sir Hubert I^m your faithful servant to command. --


Sir Hub (to Ellen.) Come, let us to our hero. Will you fair creature,
condescend to be a crutch to an old man? (takes Ellen's arm.) I shall expect
you* si^.


Ellen. Jessy!


Iessy I follow, mada^. (Exeunt Sir Hubert and Ellen.) Do address the father of
Mr. Rapid?


O. Rap You do, pretty one!


Iessy. (taking his hand and kissing it.) I beg your pardon; but are you sure
your son's life is safe -- quite safe?


O. Rap. Yes -- A very charming gir^, I declare! -- I Am very much obliged to
you for taking notice of my Neddy! -- Poor fellow! Nobody seem^d to care what
became of him. -- I^m very much obliged. -- A sweet pretty-spoken creature as
ever I saw! But I must away to the (...), or I shall be too late for the
wedding.


Iessy. Wedding! whose, sir?


O. Rap. Whose! why, my boy Neddy's with Miss Vortex to be sure!


I^ssy. Married! Edward married! It Is too much -- ( leans on OLD RAPID for
support.)


O. Rap. Eh! what! speak -- tell me!


Iessy* Oh, Edward! is this the return for my love? Have ^ merited this cruel
desertion?


O Rap. Desertion! -- What! -- has the rasca^ -- I shall choke myself -- Has he
behaved ill to so sweet a creature? Your tears tell me so. -- I Will kill him. --
He^s my own son, and I have a right to do it. -- Your name, your name! pretty
soul!


Iessy. Jessy Oatland. -- The indiscretion of my Father has made me a servant.


O Rap. And the discretion of his Father has made him a gentleman -- But ^'ll
make the rasca^ know you are not humbled by your father^s conduct, nor is he
exalted by his, a villain! -- Can he hope to be ca^l'd a man of honor for
opposing his head to a pistol while himself levels the shaft of anguish at an
innocent woman's heart! -- But ^'ll kill him, that^s one comfort. -- Come with
me, sweet one!


Iessy. Sir, I must attend my mistress -- I am servant to his bride -- (weeps.)


O Rap. I shall go mad! -- Don't cry -- If he by marriage, will not make you my
daughter -- I by adoption, will -- Good bye, sweet Jessy! -- Oh, the rascal! --
Cheer up! -- The scoundrel* -- Pretty creature! -- The dog! What a shape! --
I Will kill him! Exeunt severally.

Frank You didn't tell I to light it.

Serve. He will wait on you, sir, directly.

Vortex. In the first place, then, I^ll read this paper.


Rap. No; I Will read it -- shall read it much quicker. ( Reads) -- "Received of
Mr Vortex the sum of five thousand pounds, in consideration of which I assign
over all my right and title to hum um, um -- Signed, ELLEN VORTEX." I

Rap Then be quick


Vortex. Why I am quick an't I? -- Died in India, and left her to my care. All

Rap. Confusion


Vortex. You are right, a^l was in confusion. So I prevailed on --


Rap. Jessy Oatland!


Vortex No no, El^en -- to sign that paper; since which, indeed, her affairs
have ^urn^d out pretty lucky. I purchased this estate with her fortune, which
will be yours, my boy -- It was a very snug bargain.


Rap What a horrible thing is the gift of speech!


Vortex Speech -- Did you say any thing about a speech? Ah* had you heard mine
out. -- Do you remember how it began? -- "Had I met your eye at an earlier
hour, I should" -- ( During VORTEX^S narration. RAPID, influenced by the most
fretful impatience* has unconsciously bit, and torn to pieces, the paper given
him by VORTEX.)


Rap (jumping up) S^death and fire! Is this a time for speeches* Is not your
daughter waiting? -- Is not? -- Oh, Jessy!


Vortex True* another opportunity! But, oh! it is a pretty speech. -- Well, now
give me back the paper.


Rap. The paper!


Vortex. Yes, now you have thoroughly digested the contents of the paper, give
it me again.


Rap. Oh* the -- the -- the paper ( sees it torn on the ground).


Vortex. Yes; that precious scrap that secures us a hundred thousand pounds,
you dog! -- Come, give it me.

ruin^d. Oh, my head! I Am going, I Am going


Rap. Upon my soul I^m very sorry, but --


Vortex. But what?


Rap. That infernal speech!


Vortex Oh! ( looking at the scraps of paper) -- Eh, but hold! when he marries
my daughter he will keep the secret for his own sake. Oh dear! I must lose no
time.


Rap. I Am very sorry; I Am sure if hearing your speech will be any compensation

Vortex No, no, not now -- come with me, all the lawyers are waiting. Oh, pray
come!


Rap. I Am coming, but you're always in such a hurry.


Vortex. I^ll send my daughter to him -- I must push him. Pray come directly.
Exit in a hurry.


Rap. Upon my soul you will break your neck, if you hurry. so. Am I always to

Miss Vor. Well, I^ll forgive you, if you will come directly.


Rapid nods, and she exits. Y. Rap. What do you want?


Frank. You be^s a desperate villain! ( Rapid going to strike.) Come, dan't you

Frank. Why, Jessy Oatland!


Rap. What! your sister -- the brother of Jessy my servant? Damnation? why did

Rap. The fact is, I am the most unhappy -- the -- What do you charge for
shooting a man? I^ll give you a thousand to blow my brains out. I^m the most
miserable dog. -- Pray, sir, will you tell me one thing? Are you a man of

along; but don^t hurry; because my dear fellow! it is impossible to do any thing

Enter JESSY and FRANK. Frank. How bee^st thee now, Jessy?


Iessy. Better. Quite recover^d. What passed between you and Edward?

were thy brother, he were so humble, and did ax I so to forgive un, that I
could say no more to un. Dom it, I could not hit him, when he were down; and

conduct has been --


Y. Rap* Detestable? -- But I Am pardoned, your eyes tell me so. Thanks, my
angel! ( running to her and kneeling.) I Am so oppressed with joy* -- Ma'am,

RAPID) What does he want?


Y. Rap. Shall ask him?


Vortex. Do. I^ll be very much obliged to you


Y. Rap. I will. -- I^ll manage ( winking and nodding to VORTEX)


Vortex. Oh, thank you!


Charl^s Once more, my E^len! supported by an indulgent parent's b^essing on
our union, I entreat --


Ellen Oh Char^es! shall then return your father's goodness by destroying his
hopes for ever? Shall I repay my Stanley^s love by inflicting on him penury and
sorrow? In pity, no more!


Y Rap ( to CHARLES STANLEY). What may be your business here sir?


Charles. ^ came to take leave. --


Y Rap. Hush (apart). -- To inquire respecting that lady^s fortune. We Will soon
answer all that, wont we? [ nodding to VORTEX.]


Charles. I say, sir --


Y Rap [stopping him.] We grant it, -- we grant Mr. Vortex has recovered
property to a considerable amount, but what signifies that? She assigned it for
five thousand pounds! -- You see how I^m going on ( to Nabob.)


Vortex. Oh, thank you, my dear friend!


Y. Rap. I Have seen the paper; haven^t I? -- [to Vortex.]


Charles. And I should be satisfied --


Y. Rap. You wou^d be satisfied if you saw it. -- Certainly -- very proper --
nothing in nature can be more reasonable; so Nabob show him the paper, and
settle the business at once (walks about, VORTEX following him) Show him the
paper -- don^t keep the gentleman waiting al^ day. -- Show him the paper. My
dear fellow what^s the use of walking after me? Show him the paper.

Vortex taking advantage of the pauses in the foregoing speech. I say my dear
friend hush! Be quiet! I want to speak to you; you forget you destroyed it.


Y. Rap. I destroyed it!


Vortex. Hush!


Y. Rap. He says I destroyed it!


Vortex. I did not* -- I^ll take my oath I did not.


Y Rap. And it is true.


Charles and Ellen. What?


Y. Rap True, upon my honor! He has no more hold on your estates, mad^^, than
I have.


Charles [ kneeling to ELLEN.] Will you now allow the humble Stanley to destroy
the hopes of wealthy Ellen? Will you permit me to repay your love with penury
and sorrow?


Ellen. Oh, chide on! [raising him.] Dear Stanley, my happiness is now complete.


Y. Rap. This is your house, ma'am. -- I give you joy! -- Sir, I give you joy!
-- Nabob I give you joy!


Vortex. Oh, my head! You villian!


Y. Rap. Don't talk about villainy, -- it will make you worse. Sit down, my dear
fe^low!


Charles. He Is justly punished for the falsehood of the story he told --


Y. Rap. I say, he is justly punished for the length of the story he told.


Charles. Mr. Rapid, in expressing my oblig^tions, allow me to be --


Y. Rap. Not more than a minute, I entreat.

character as a man of honor, in rewarding the affections of this amiab^e
woman, you command my praise; for bestowing happiness on my dear Charles,
receive an old man's b^essing.


Y. Rap. Approbation from Sir Hubert Stanley is praise indeed.


O. Rap. Dam me* there is the son of a tailor for you!


Vortex. What, a tailor!


O Rap. Yes; and let me tell you that one guinea honestly gotten by blood drawn
from the finger, is sweeter than a million obtained, by blood drawn from the
heart! -- so take that.


Y. Rap Well, Nabob, how do you feel?


Vortex. Egad it is very odd; -- but I declare I feel light and comfortable since
Ellen has got her Estate* and I somehow breathe more free* I Have a notion the
last line of my speech is true


Y R^p Come, I Will hear the last line.


Vortex. Why, "that the first step toward securing the esteem of others, is to
secure your own."


Y Rap. Stick to the last line.


Ellen. And, dear uncle take Sir Hubert Stanley for your Physician Follow his
prescuption of justice and benevo^ence, and my life on it, you will soon thank
me for my recommendation.


Vortex We, to show the sincerity of my intentions, allow me, Ellen, to present
you these parchments, the title-deeds of this Estate (present parchments).


O. Rap. I say, Ned, what nice measures they would make!


Ellen. And Sir* allow me to show you the true value of riches -- ( giving
parchments to Stan^ey)* Convert them into happiness


O. Rap. Well, I Have only one observation to make.


Y. Rap. I hope it is a short one.


Iessy. What, impatient again?


Y. Rap. I am, and if I err,

It Is you my generous Patrons, are the cause,
My heart's impatient for your kind applause.

EPILOGUE.
WRITTEN BY M. P. ANDREWS, Esquire. M. P. Spoken by Mrs. MATTOCKS.
SHAKESPEARE, a shrewd old quiz, in his dull age,
Said, very gravely, "All the world^s a stage."
But if the Poet on our times could drop,
He d rather own that "all the world's a shop."
"And what is the trade?" exclaim the critic railers,
Why, "Men and women all are merely tailors."
Nay. frown not, Beaux; and Ladies, do not pout;
You Have all your cuttings in and cuttings out.
And, first, Miss Hoyden, just escaped from school,
Slighting mamma, and all domestic rule;
If she on fashion's road should chance to trip,
What says the world? why, "Miss has made a slip."
And if, a falling character to save,
She weds with age just tott^ring over the grave,
The sportive world will still enjoy the joke,
And spouse, at home, at once is made a cloak.
The Politician too who, when in place,
Views public measures with a smiling face,
Croaks* when he is out, a discontented note, --
Sure he is a tailor -- he has turn^d his coat.
Often have I measured you when closely sitting,
To see what twist, what shape, what air was fitting.
Once more I Will try, if you^ll make no resistance;
Mine^s a quick eye, and measures at a distance.
[Produces the sh^^rs and measure.
Great Mr. Alderman -- your worship -- s^r,
If you can stomach it, you need not stir.
Room you require, for turtle and for haunch,
It Is done -- two yards three quarters round the paun^^^
Slim sir, hold up your arm -- Oh, you're a poet,
You want a coat, indeed -- your elbows show it.
Don't tremble man: there is now no cause for fears;
Though often you shirk the Gemmen of the sheers;
Genius stands still, when tailors interpose;
It Is like a watch -- it ticks -- and then it goes.
The needle dropped, the warlike sword I draw,
For often our Sex must yield to martial law;
Lady Hubbuffet came to me last night,
"Oh, my dear ma'am, I Am in such a fright;
"They Have drawn me for a man; and, what is worse,
"I am to soldier it, and mount a horse:
"Must wear the breeches" Says I "Don't deplore,
"What in your husband^s life you always wore;
"But that your La'ship's heart may cease from throbbing,
"Let your fat Coachman mount upon fat Dobbin;
"And for the good old pair I Will boldly say,
"Nor man, nor horse, will ever run away."
"Run!' -- "Arrab, who is that dare fear betray?"
(Cries patriot Paddy, hot from Bantry Bay.) [with a Brog^e.
"The Frenchmen came, expecting us to meet 'em,
"And sure we all were ready there to greet 'em,
"With piping hot potatoes made of lead,
"And powder that would save instead of bread;
"And, by my soul, such dainty fine fat frogs,
"With warm dry lodging for them in the bogs."
"They came, alas!' cried I* of terror full,
"They made a "conquest?" No, they made a bull."
But softly -- what with measures, bulls, and battle,
You must be tir^d with my poor foolish prattle;
But while you look so pleasant, kind, and clever,
Had I my way, I Would talk to you for ever.
THE END.
TO THE ADMIRERS OF THE DRAMA.
IT is the intention of the PRINTER, to publish all the modern Plays of merit,
should he find encouragement. -- They will be neatly executed, on a new type,
and good paper; -- and will be printed of the same size, to bind together.
