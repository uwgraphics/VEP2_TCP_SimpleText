THE JOURNEYMEN CABINET AND CHAIR-MAKERS PHILADELPHIA BOOK OF PRICES.

SECOND EDITION, CORRECTED AND ENLARGED.

ENTERED ACCORDING TO ACT OF CONGRESS.

PHILADELPHIA: PRINTED BY ORMROD AND CONRAD, AT FRANKLIN's HEAD, NO. 41,
CHESNUT-STREET. M.DCCXCV.

INTRODUCTION
THE recent improvements in our trade, will evince the necessity of the
enlargement of our book of prices, especially as many articles in our former
book, were not clear enough to prevent different constructions being put on
them both by employers and journeymen, which has been the cause of frequent
disputes between them. In order to prevent the like in future, it is requested
both parties will be particular in acquainting themselves with the following

General Explanation.

ALL kinds of drawer work in single carcases, or any work to represent the
same, to measure on the carcass, and all work with double carcases to m^^sure
the bottom one, both for length and width. A book-case, when made to stand on a
secretary, to measure only its own length. Libraries, on the bottom part.

Shamming of drawer fronts, the price of which is given in a table, is settled
exclusive of putting on brass work -- nor is the nuts or lock plates to be let
into any work in the start, except the fronts of secretary or furniture
drawers, the fall of a desk or dressing tables. All drawers in chamber, card*
Pembroke or work tables, and all drawers enclosed by doors, in all work
whatever, to start without locks -- and (...) secretary drawer is introduced
into any piece of work, deduct the price of the drawers taken out for its
reception, then add the price of the secretary drawer.
