New Songs, etc.
SONG, I. AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.
IT IS done! the edict past, by heaven decreed,
And Hancock's name confirms the glor'ous deed.
On this auspicious morn
Was Independence born:
Propitious day!
Hail the United States of blessed America!
CHORUS.
Fly, swift winged Fame,
The news proclaim:
From shore to shore
Let cannon's roar,
And joyful voices shout Columbia's name.
See haughty Britain, sending hosts of foes.
With vengeance armed, our freedom to oppose;
But WASHINGTON the great,
Dispelled impending fate,
And spurned each plan:
Americans, combine to hail the godlike man.
CHORUS. -- Fly, swift winged Fame, etc.

Let Saratoga's crimson plains declare
The deeds of Gates, that "thunderbolt of war:"
His trophies graced the field:
He made whole armies yield --
A vet'ran band:
In vain did Burgoyne strive his valor to withstand.
CHORUS -- Fly, swift winged Fame, etc.

Now Yorktown's heights attract our wondering eyes,
Where loud artill'ry rend's the lofty skies:
There WASHINGTON commands,
With Gallia's chosen bands,
A warlike train;
Like Homer's conquering gods, they thunder over the plain.
CHORUS. -- Fly, swift-wing Fame, etc.

Pale terror marches on, with solemn stride;
Cornwall is trembles, Britain's boasted pride;
He and his armed hosts,
Surrender all their posts,
To WASHINGTON,
The friend of Liberty, Columbia's favorite son,
HORUS. -- Fly, swift-wing'd Fame, etc.

Now from Mount Vernon's peaceful shades again,
The Hero comes, with thousands in his train:
It Is WASHINGTON the great
Must fill the chair of state,
Columbia cries:
Each tongue the glorious name re-echoes to the skies.
CHORUS. -- Fly, swift-wing'd Fame, etc.

Now shall the useful arts of peace prevail,
And commerce flourish, favored by each gale
Discord, forever cease
Let Liberty and Peace
And Justice reign;
For WASHINGTON protects the scientific train.
CHORUS. -- Fly, swift-wing'd Fame etc

SONG II. THE HEAVING OF THE LEAD.
WHEN sailing for Columbia's land,
With favoring gale our ship we steered;
And scudding up to gain the strand,
The lofty pines at length appeared.
To heave the lead the seaman sprung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
By the deep Nike!
2
And bearing up, to gain the port,
Some well known object kept in view,
An Abbey tower an harbor sort;
Or, beacon, to the vessel true,
While often the lead the seaman flung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
"By the mark seven.
3
And as the much loved thore was near,
With transport we beheld the roof;
Where dwelt a friend or partner dear,
Of faith and love a matchless proof.
The lead once more the seaman flung,
And to the watchful pilot sung,
"Quarter less five.
SONG III. THE STREAMLET THAT FLOWED ROUND HER COT.
THE streamlet that flowed round her cost
All the charms of my Emily knew:
How often has its course been forgot,
While it paused her dear image to woe.
Believe me the food silver tide,
Knew from whence it derived the fair prize,
For silently swelling with pride,
It reflected it back to the skies.
SONG IV. NOTHING LIKE GROG.
A Plague on those musty old lubber
Who tell us to fast and to think,
And patiently fall in with life's rubbers,
With nothing but water to drink.
A cann of good (...) swigg'd it,
Would have set (...)
And spite of the rules,
Of the schools, the old fool.
Would have all of them swigg'd it.
And swore there was nothing like grog.
2
My father, when last I from Guine:
(...)'d with abundance of wealth,
Cried -- Jack, never be such a ninny
To drink, -- Says I -- Father, your health,
So I passed round the stuff -- soon he swigg'd it,
And it set the old codger agog,
And he swigg'd and mother,
And sister and brother,
And I swigg'd, and all of us swigg'd it,
And swore there was nothing like grog.
3
One day when the Chaplain was preaching,
Behind him I curiously slunk,
And while he our duty was teaching
As how we should never get drunk,
I tipped him the stuff, and he twigg'd it,
Which soon set his reverence agog,
And he swigg'd, and Nick swigg'd.
And Ben swigg'd, and Dick swigg'd,
And I swigg'd, and all of us swigg'd it,
And swore there was nothing like grog.
4
Then trust me there is nothing as drinking
So pleasant on this side the grave;
It keeps the unhappy from thinking.
And makes even more valiant more brave,
For me from the moment I twigg'd it,
The good stuff so set me agog,
Sick or well, late or early,
Wind foully or fairly,
I Have constantly swigg'd it,
And hang me there is nothing like grog.
I a dark floating dungeon upon the sait wave
Spare a halfpenny, spare a halfpenny,
Spare a halfpenny to a poor Negro.
2
Tossed on the wild main, I all wildly despairing,
Burst my chains rushed on deck with my eyeballs wide glaring,
When the lightnings dread blast struck the inlets of day,
And its glorious bright beams shut forever away.
Spare a halfpenny, etc.
3
The despoiler of man then his prospect thus losing,
Of gain by my sale, not a blind bargain choosing,
As my value, compared with my keeping, was light,
Had me dashed overboard, in the dead of night.
Spare a halfpenny, etc.
4
And but for a bark to Brittannia's coast bound then,
All my cares by that plunge in the deep had been drowned then,
But by moonlight descried, I was snatched from the wave,
And reluctantly robbed of a watery grave.
Spare a halfpenny, etc.
5
How disastrous my fate, freedom's ground though I tread now,
Torn from home, wife and children and wandering for bread now,
While seas toll between us, which never can be crossed,
And hope's distant glimm'rings in darkness are lost.
Spare a halfpenny, etc.
6
But of minds foul and fair when the judge and the ponderer,
Shall restore light and rest to the blind and the wanderer,
The European's deep dye may outrival the sloe,
And the soul of an Ethiop prove white as the snow.
Spare a halfpenny, etc.
SONG VIII. THE SWEET LITTLE GIRL THAT I LOVE.
MY friends all declare that my time is misspent,
While in rural retirement I rove;
I ask no more wealth than dame fortune has sent,
But the sweet little girl that I love.
The rose on her cheek's my delight,
She Is soft as the down on the dove,
No lilly was ever so white,
As the sweet little girl that I love.
2
Though humble my cot, calm content gilds the scene,
For my fair one delights in my grove;
And a palace I Would quit for a dance on the green,
With my sweet little girl that I love.
The sweet little girl, etc.
3
No ambition I know, but to call her my own,
No same but her praise wish to prove;
My happiness centers in Fanny alone,
She Is the sweet little girl that I love.
The sweet little girl, etc.
SONG X. THE SAILOR BOY CAPERING ASHORE.
POLL dang' it how do you do,
Nan will not you g'us a buss;
Why what is to do wi you,
Why here is a pretty suss;
Say, shall we kiss and toy,
Oh! I Am the sailor's boy,
For capering a shore.
2
Father he apprentic'd me,
All to a coasting ship,
I b'ing resolved do you see,
To give'em all the slip,
I got to Yarmouth fair,
Where I had been before,
So father found me there,
A capering a shore.
3
Next out to India,
I went a Guinea pig,
We got to Table Bay,
But mind a pretty rig,
The ship driven out to sea,
Left me and many more,
Among the Hottenpots,
A capering a shore.
4.
I love's a bit of hop,
Life's never the worser for it,
If in my wake should drop,
A fiddle "that is your sort,"
Thrice tumble up a hoy,
Once get the labor over,
Then see the sailor boy,
A capering a shore.
SONG X. ALONE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON.
THE day is departed and round from the cloud,
The moon in her beauty appears,
'The voice of the Nightingale warbles aloud,
The music of love in our ears:
Maria, appear now the season so sweet
With the beat of the heart is in tune,
The time is so tender for lovers to meet,
Alone by the light of the moon.
2
I cannot, when present, unfold what I feel;
I sigh -- can a lover do more?
Her name to the shepherds I never reveal,
Yet I think of her all the day over.
Maria, my love, do you long for the grove?
Do you sigh for an interview soon?
Does ever a kind thought run on me as you rove,
Alone by the light of the moon?
3
Your name from the shepherds whenever I hear,
My bosom is all in a glow;
Your voice when it vibrates so sweet through mine ear,
My heart thrills -- my eyes overflow.
Ye powers of the sky, will your bounty divine,
Indulge a sond lover his boon?
Shall heart spring to heart, and Maria be mine,
Alone by the light of the moon.
SONG XI. MY HEART IS DEVOTED DEAR MARY TO THEE.
THOUGH the Muses never smile by the light of the sun,
Yet they visit my cot when my labor is done,
And whilst on my pillow of straw I recline,
A wreath of sweet flowerets they sportively twines.
But in vain she fair damsels weave chaplets for me.
Since my heart is devoted dear Mary to thee.
2
Full often I reflected on my indigent state,
But reflection and reason are ever too late,
They tell me I sigh for too beauteous a fair,
And sill my sad bosom with doubts and despair,
Then hope kindly smiling averts their decree,
For my heart is dovoted dear Mary to thee.
3
When the shrill pipe and tabor proclaim the light dance,
With transports I see my dear Mary advance,
Then such grace she displays while she trips mid the throng,
That each shepherd with raptures to her tunes his song,
But my none she is beloved with such truth as by me,
For my heart is devoted dear Mary to thee.
SONG XII. GOD SAVE AMERICA!
GOD save America,
Free from tyrannic sway,
Till time shall cease.
Hushed be the din of arms,
And all proud war's alarms;
Follow in all her charms,
Heaven born peace.
God bless great Washington,
Fair freedom's chosen son,
Born to command:
May every enemy
Far from his presence flee,
And be grim tyranny
Bound by his hand.
Thy name, O Montgomery
Full in each heart shall be,
Praised in each breath:
Though on the fatal plain
Thou wast untimely slain,
Yet shall thy virtues gain
Rescue from death.
SONG XIII. THE LUCKY ESCAPE.
I THAT was once a ploughman, a sailor am now,
No lark that aloft in the sky.
Ever fluttered his wings to give speed to the plough,
Was so gay and so careless as I.
But my friend was a carfindo aboard a king's ship.
And he ax'd me to go just to sea for a trip.
And he talked of such things,
As if sailors were kings,
And so teazing did keep.
That I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep.
No longer the horn,
Called me up in the morn.
I trusted the carfindo and the inconstant wind,
That made me for to go and leave my dear behind.
2
I did not much like to be aboard a ship,
When in danger there is no door to creep out;
I liked the jolly tares, I liked bumbo and flir^
But I did not like rocking about;
By and by came a hurricane, I did not like that,
Next a battle that many a sailor laid flat,
Ah! cried I who would roam,
That like me had a home,
When I sow and I Would reap,
Ere I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep,
Where sweetly the horn,
Called me up in the morn,
Ere I trusted the Carfindo and the inconstant wind,
That made me for to go, and leave my dear behind.
3
At last safe I landed and in a whole skin,
Nor did I make any long stay,
Ere I found by a friend that I ax'd for my kin,
Father dead, and my wife ran away:
Ah who but thyself, said I, have thou to blame,
Wives loosing their husbands often loose their good name;
Ah why did I roam,
When so happy at home.
I could sow and could reap,
Ere I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep,
When so sweetly the horn
Called me up in the morn,
Curse light upon the carfindo and the inconstant wind,
That made me for to go and leave my dear behind.
4
Why, if that be the case, said this very same friend,
And you b'ent no more minded to roam,
Gis a shake by the fist, all your care's at an end,
Dad's alive, and your wife's safe at home.
Stark starting with joy, I lept out of my skin.
Buss'd my wife, mother, sister, and all of my kin;
Now, cried I, let them roam,
Who want a good home,
I am well, so I Will keep,
Nor again leave my plough to go ploughing the deep:
Once more shall the horn,
Call me up in the morn,
Nor shall any d -- carfindo nor the inconstant wind,
Ever tempt me for to go and leave my dear behind.
SONG XIV. THE MANSION OF PEACE.
A ROSE from her bosom has strayed.
I Will seek to replace it with art;
But no, 'twill her slumbers invade,
I Will wear it fond youth next my heart.
Alas filly rose had thou known,
'Twas Daphne that gave thee thy place
Thou never from thy station had flown
Her bosom, the mansion of peace.
SONG XV. DEATH OR VICTORY.
HARK the din of distant war,
How noble is the clangour,
Pale death ascends his ebon care,
Clad in terrific anger.
A doubtful fate the soldier tries
Who joins the gallant quarrel;
Perhaps on the cold ground he lies,
No wife no friend to close his eyes.
Though nobly mourned; perhaps returned,
He Is crowned withvictory's laurel.
2
How many who, disdaining fear,
Rush on the desperate duty,
Shall claim the tribute of the tear,
That dims the eye of beauty.
A doubtful fate the soldier tries
Who join the gallant quarrel,
Perhaps on the cold ground he lies,
No wife no friend, to close his eyes,
Though nobly mourned; perhaps returned,
He Is crowned with victory's laurel.
3
What noble fate can fortune give,
Renown shall tell our story
If we should fall, but if we live
We live our country's glory.
It Is true a doubtful fate he tries,
Who joins the gallant quarrel;
Perhaps on the cold ground he lies,
No wife no friend to close his eyes,
Though nobly mourned; perhaps returned,
He Is crowned with victory's laurel.
SONG XVI. THE BOWL.
Tune, "When up the shrouds the sailor goes."

WHEN sorrow baneful ills impart,
And woes distract the mind,
Never let vain grief unman the heart,
Disperse it in the wind;
Nor yield like cowards to despair,
Dispel it from the soul,
For there is a balm, a cure for care,
Concentred in the bowl.
Columbia's prop, the hardy tar,
Rough, generous, and free;
If duty calls, attends the war,
And braves the foaming sea:
Even when unequal foes appear,
No fears torment his soul,
He finds a balm can keep it clear.
Concentred in the bowl.
SONG XVII. MARSEILLOIS HYMN.
ARISE! ye generous youth of France,
And mark the glory of this day:
Against us the tyrant-throng advance,
And high the bloody flag display. [Twice]
Our fields ferocious hirelings dare,
And savage howlings rend the sky,
They come! and from your arms they tear
The prattling babes, who bleeding, die!
Arm, Citizens, to arms!
Arrange the warlike band;
March on, march on,
With blood impure,
T'imbrue your thirsty land!
We march, we march,
With blood impure,
T'imbrue our thirsty land!
What would this herd of conjor'd kings,
Vile slaves, and traitors, ghastly throng!
For whom the chain ignoble brings
The bondage we have suffered long? [Twice]
In vengeance, French, let every breast
With swelling transport ceaseless burn,
Fair freedom teaches to detest
The slavery they bid return.
To arms, etc.

What! would these proud outlandish foes
Be legislators in our land?
What! would this hireling crounds oppose
And lay in dust our warlike band? [Twice]
Great God! shall then th'enflaving rod
Subject us to our former state?
Shall a vile despot's sovereign nod
Decide at will our abject fate?
To arms, etc.

Our warriors now the glory share,
By them you fall, by them succeed;
Spare, then, the wretched victims, spare!
We arm to die, or make you bleed. [Twice]
But, lo! these sanguinary lords
Joyous exert their savege power;
These bloody tyrants lift their swords,
And their own countries peace devour.
To arms, etc.

Tremble, proud tyrants, traitors blush,
Quick, quick resign the victor's plume,
The arm of justice, raised to crush,
Descends, and you must meet your doom. [Twice.
All, all are soldiers now in France,
And should we fall, new legions rise,
Our youth to join the fight advance,
And learn all danger to despise.
To arms, etc.

CHILDREN.
With joy we will assume the trust
When down death's hill our fathers roll,
Then shall we find their sacred dust
Will animate the aspiring soul. [ Twice]
Less zealous to survive our sires
Than share the death we all contemn,
Their sons a glorious pride inspires
T'avenge their wrongs or follow them.
To arms, etc.
Oh! "sacred love of country" aid
Our vengeful arms, our footsteps guide,
And Liberty! celestial maid,
Adhere to thy defender's side, [ Twice.]
When victory our tents shall leave,
To spread the joyous tidings round,
Thy triumph and our fame shall give
Our enemies their lasting wound.
To arms, etc.
Our native soil and social love,
Together limit our desires,
Then ever lei our souls improve
The glow which virtue's wish inspires. twice
By union shall our power's increase,
Our tyrant foes shall hug their chain;
And then the happy French shall cease
To chaunt the harsh incongruous strain.
To arms, etc.
Frenchmen, too long, the sport of factions,
This day should quench fell discord's flame:
Americans, whose virtuous actions
Excel the proudest nation's claim,
Let us for ever be united,
Conspiring kings our wrath shall dread,
Our thunders bursting on their head,
Shall hurl them from their thrones affrighted,
To arms, etc.
The translation of the fourth and fifth verses of the Children's hymn, could
not possibly be procured.
