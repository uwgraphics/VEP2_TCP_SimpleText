Robin Hood's Garland.
A proper new Ballad of bold ROBIN HOOD; showing his Parentage, Birth,
Breeding, Valor, and Marriage; of Tidbury Bull running. Composed for the
diversion at Old and Young People.
TO A NEW TUNE.
KIND gentlemen will you be p^tient a while,
Ay, and then you shall hear anon,
A very good ballad of bold Robin Hood,
And his brave man little John.
In Loxy town in merry Nottinghamshire,
In merry sweet Loxy town,
There bold Robin Hood was born and bred,
Bold Robin of fame and renown.
The father of Robin a forester was,
And he shot a lusty long bow,
Two north country miles and an inch at a shot,
As the pindar of Wakefield does know.
For the brought Adam Bell, and Clin of the Clough
With William of Cloudesly,
To shoot with our forester for forty marks,
And the forester beat them all three.
His mother was niece to the Coventry knight,
Which (...)
And flew the great boar that hung up at the gate
Or mine holl at the bull tells a lie.
Her brother was Gamwell of great Gamwell hall
And a noble house keeper was he,
Ay, as ever broke bread in Nottinghamshire,
And a 'Squire of famous degree.
This mother of Robin said to her husband,
My honey, my dove, and my dear,
Let Robin and I ride this morning to Gamwell,
To taste of my brother's good cheer.
And he said I grant thee thy boon, gentle Joan,
Take one of my horses I pray,
The sun it is rising, therefore make haste,
For tomorrow is Christmas day.
Then Robin Hood's father's gray gelding was bro't,
And sadled and bridled was he,
As also his bonnet and new suit of clothes,
And a cloak that reached down to his knee.
She got on her holliday kirtlet and gown,
They were of a light Lincoln grean,
The cloth was homespun, but color and make
It might well be-suited a qu^^n,
And then Robin got on his basket-hilt sword,
And dagger on the other side.
And said my dear mother, let us haste be gone,
We have forty miles to ride.
When Robin had mounted his gelding so gray,
His father without any trouble,
Set her up behind him, and bid her not fear,
For his gelding had often carried double.
When he was settled, they rode to the neighbors,
And drank and shook hands with them all,
And then Robin galloped, and never gave over,
Till he lighted at Gamwell hall.
And now you may think the right worshipful 'Squire
Was joyful his si^^er to see
For me kissed her^ and blessed her, and swore a great oath,
T^^^^ art, welcome de^^ sister to me.
Next morning when mass was said in the ca^pol,
Six ^^bles were laid in the hall,
And in comes the 'Squire and makes a short speech
It was, neighbors, you're welcome all.
But not a man here, shall taste^a^y M^rch beer,
Till a Christmas caroll be sung,
Then all clapped their hands, and they shouted and sung
Till the hall and the parlour did ring.
Now mustand and brawn, roast beef and plumbpies,
Were set upon every table,
And noble George Gamwell said eat and be merry,
And drink too as long as you're able.
When dinner was ended, his chaplain said grace,
And be merry, my friends, s^id the 'Squire,
It rains, and it blows, but call for more alo,
And lay up more wood on the fire.
And now call my little John hither to me,
for little John is a fine lad.
At gambols, and jiggling, and twenty-five trisks,
As shall make you merry and glad.
When little John came, they all to gambols went
Both gentieman, yeomen and clown,
And what do you think? Why, as true as I live,
Bold Robin Hood put them all down.
And now you may think the right worshipful 'Squire
Was joyful this fight for to ^ee:
For he said, Cousin Robin pray go no more home.
But tarry and dwell here with me.
Thou shall have my land when Lose, and till the^
Thou shall be the ^^aff of my age,
Then grant me my boon, dear uncle, said Robin,
That little John may be my page.
And he said, kind cousin, I grant thee thy boon,
With all my heart, so let it be,
Then come hither little John, said Robin Hood
Come hither little page to me.
Go fetch me my bow, my longest long bow,
And broad arrows, one, two, or three,
For when it is fair weather we'll unto Sherwood,
Some merry pastime for to see.
When Robin came unto merry Sherwood,
He winded his buggle so clear,
And twice five and twenty good yeomen bold,
Before Robin Hood did appear.
Where are all your companions? said Robin Hood,
For still I want forty and three.
Then said a bold yeoman, Lo, yonder they stand
All under a fine green wood tree.
As that word was spoken, Clorinda came by,
The queen of the shepherds was she;
Her gown was of velvet as green as the grass,
And her buskin did reach to her knee.
Her gate it was graceful, her body was straight,
Her countenace free from pride;
A bow in her hand, and a quiver of arrows
Hung dangling down by her side.
Her eyebrows were black, ay! and so was her hair
And her skin was as smooth as glass:
Her visage spoke wisdom and modesty too
Sets with Robin Hood such a lass.
Said Robin Hood, Lady fair, whither away*
Oh! whither fair lady away?
She made him answer, to kill a fat buck,
For tomorrow is Tidbury day.
Said Robin Hood, lady fair, wander with me,
A little with me to yon bower,
There sit and rest you, and you shall be sure
Of a brace or a lease in an hour.
As they were going toward the green bower,
Two hundred good bucks they espied,
She chose of the fattest that was in the herd,
And she shot him through side and side.
By the says of my body, said Robin Hood, West,
I never saw woman like thee:
And come thou from Eeast, or come thou from
Thou nee'dst not beg venison of me.
However along to my bower you shall go,
And taste of thus fo^e sters meat:
And when we came there, we found as good cheer,
As any man need for to eat.
For there ewas hot venison, and warden pies,
Cream clouted with honey comb plenty:
And servitors there were, besides little John,
Of good yeomen bold four and twenty.
Clorinda said, Tell me your name, gentle Sir!
And he said, It Is bold Robin Hood:
"Squire Gamwell's my uncle, but all my delight,
Is to dwell in merry Sherwood:
For it is a fine life, and void of all strife,
So it is, sir, Clorinda replied.
But oh! said bold Robin, how sweet should it be.
If Clorinda would now be my bride.
She blushed at this motion, yet after a pause,
Said, yes sir, with all my heart.
Then let us send for a priest, said Robin flood,
And be married before we do part.
But she said, it may not be so, gentle fir,
For I must be at Tidbury feast:
And if Robirt Hood will go there with me,
I Will make him the most welcome guest.
Said Robin Hood, Reach me that buck little Joln,
For I Will go along with my dear:
So bid my good yeomen kill six brace of bucks,
And meet me tomorrow just here.
Before they had ridden five staffordshire miles,
Eight yeomen that were brave and bold,
Bid Robin Hood stand, and deliver his buck,
A truer tale never was told.
I will not faith, said bold Robin, come little John,
Stand to me, and we'll beat them all.
Then both drew their swords, (...) them and
That five of the eight did (...) them.
The three that remained (...) for quarters,
And pitiful John begged their lives.
Then John's boon was granted, he gave them good counsel,
And so they went home to their wives.
This battle was fought near Tidbury town,
When bag pipes peaced, the bull:
I Am king of the fiddlers, and swear it is truth,
And call him that doubts it a gull.
For I saw them fighting and fiddled the while.
And Clorinda ^ng, Aye derry down;
The bumkins are beaton, put up your sword Bob.
And let us dance into the town.
Before we came to it we heard a great shouting,
And all that were in it looks madly:
For some were a bull bace, some dancing a morrie,
And singing brave Art^ur a Bradly.
And there we saw. Thomas our justice's clerk,
And Mary to whom he was hind:
For Tom rode before her, and called Mary madam
And kissed her sweetly behind.
And so may your worships; but we went to dinner,
With good Thomas, Mary and Nan,
They all drank a health to Clorinda, and told her,
Bold Robin Hood was a fine man.
When dinner was ended, Sir Roger, the Parson
Of Dubridge, was sent for in haste;
He brought his mass book and bid them take hands,
And joined them in marriage full fast.
And then as bold Robin Hood and his sweet bride,
Went hand in hand to a green bower,
The bride sung with pleasure in merry Sherwood
And 'twas a most delightful hour.
Where Robin Hood came in sight of his bower,
Where are my yeomen? said he,
Little John answered, lo yonder they stand,
All under the green wood tree.
Then garlands they brought her two and two,
And placed them in the bride's bed,
The music struck up and they all fell to dance,
Till the bride and the groom were in bed.
And what they did there must be counsel to me.
Because they lay long the next day,
And I made haste home, and got a good piece
Of the bride's cake, and so came away.
Now, alas, I had forgotten to tell ye,
That married they were with a ring;
And so will Nan Night, or be buried a maiden.
And now let us frolic and sing.
Robin Hood's progress to Nottingham, in which he slew fifteen Foresters.
ROBIN HOOD was a tall young man,
And fifteen winters old;
And Robin Hood was a proper young man,
Of courage stout and bold:
Robin Hood he went unto fair Nottingham,
With the general for to dine,
There was he aware of fifteen foresters,
All drinking ale and wine.
What news, what news? said Robin Hood;
What news fain would thou know?
Our King has appointed a shooting match,
And I am ready with my bow.
We hold it in scorn, then said the foresters.
That ever a boy so young,
Should bear a bow before the King,
That is not able to draw one string.
We'll hold you twenty marks, said bold Robin Hood
By the leave of our lady,
That I Will hit the mark an hundred rood,
And I Will cause a heart to die.
We'll hold you twenty, marks then said the foresters,
By the leave of our lady,
Thou hit'st not the mark, an hundred rood,
Nor cause a heart to die.
Robin Hood he bent a noble bow,
And a broad arrow he let fly,
He hit the mark a hundred rood,
And caused an heart to die.
Some says he broke ribs one or two,
And some say he broke three:
The arrow in one heart would not abide,
But it glanced through two or three.
The heart did skip, and the heart did leap,
And the heart lay on the ground.
The wager is mine, said Robin Hood,
Were for a thousand pound,
The wager's none of thine said the foresters,
Although thou be'st in haste,
Take up thy bow and get thee hence,
Lest we thy sides do baste:
Robin Hood took up his noble bow,
And his broad arrows let fly,
Till fourteen of these foresters
Upon the ground did lie.
He that did the quarrel first begin
Went tripping over the plain,
But Robin bent his noble bow,
And fetched him back again.
You said I was no archer, quoth Robin Hood,
But say you now again,
With that he sent another arrow
Which sp^it his head in twain.
You have found me an archer, quoth Robin Hood,
Which will make your wives to wring,
And wish that you never spoke the word
That I could not draw one string.
The people that lived in fair Nottingham,
Came running out amain,
Supposing to have taken bold Robin Hood,
With the forester; that were slain.
Some lost their legs and some their arms,
And some did lose their blood.
But Robin Hood took up his noble bow,
And went to merry greenwood.
They carried these foresters to fair Nottingham,
As many there did know;
They dug them graves in their church yard,
And buried them all in a row,
III. Robin Hood and the jolly Pindar of Wakefield. Showing how he fought with
Robin Hood, Will Scarlet and little John, a long summer's day.
TO A NORTHERN TUNE.
IN Wakefield there lives a jolly Pindar,
In Wakefield all on a green,
In Wakefield all on a green,
There is neither Knight or 'Squire, said the pindar,
Nor Baron that is so bold,
Nor Baron that is so bold,
Dare make a trespass to the town of Wakefield,
But his pledge goes to the pinfold.
All this beneard three witty young men,
'Twas Robin Hood, Scarlet and John,
With that they spied a jolly Pindar,
As he sat under a thorn.
Now turn again, turn again, said the Pindar,
For a wrong way you have gone,
For you have forsaken the King's highway,
And made a path over the corn.
O that were great shame, quoth jolly Robin,
We being three and thou but one,
The Pindar leaped back then thirty good foot,
'Twas thirty foot and one,
He leaned his back fast unto a thorn,
And his feet against a stone,
And there he fought a long summer's day,
And a summers day so long.
Till that their swords and their broad bucklers
Were broken fast unto their hands.
Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood
And my merry men every one.
For this is one of the best Pindars,
That ever I tried with sword,
O will thou forsake the Pindar's craft,
And live in the green wood with me?
At Michaelmas next covenant comes out,
When every man gathers in his fee,
Then I Will take the blue blade in my hand,
And plod to the greenwood with thee.
I have both bread and b^ef, said the Pindar.
And good ale of the best,
And that is meet good enough, said Robin Hood,
For any such unbidden guest.
O will thou forsake the pindar's craft,
And go to the greenwood with me?
Thou shall have a livery twice in the year,
The one green and the other brown.
If Michaelmas day was once come and gone,
And my master had paid me my fee,
Then would I set as little by him,
As my master does by me.
IV. Robin Hood and the Bishop; showing how Robin robbed the Bishop of his
gold, and made him sing a Mass.
TUNE -- ROBIN HOOD AND THE STRANGER.
COME, gentlemen all, and listen awhile,
With a heydown, down, and a down,
And a story I Will to you unfold,
I Will tell you how Robin served the bishop,
When he robbed him of his gold.
As it fell out on a sun shining day.
When Phoebus was in his prime,
Then Robin Hood that archer good,
In mirth would spend some time.
As he walked the forest along,
Some pastime for to spy,
There he was aware of a proud Bishop,
And all his company.
O what shall I do, said Robin Hood then,
If the bishop he does take me!
No mercy he'^^ show unto me I know,
Therefore away I Will flee.
Then Robin was stout and turned him about,
And a little house there did he spy,
And to an old wife to save his life,
He loud began to cry.
Why, who art thou? said the old woman,
Come tell unto me for good,
I am an out law, as many do know,
My name is Robin Hood.
And yonder is the Bishop and all his men,
And if that I taken be,
Then day and night he will work my spite,
And hanged I shall be.
If thou be Robin Hood, faid the old wife
As thou do seem to be,
I Will for the provide, and thee will I hide
From the Bishop and his company.
For well I remember on Saturday night,
Thou brought me shoes and hose,
Therefore I Will provide thy person to hide,
And keep thee from thy foes.
Then give me soon thy coat of gray.
And take then the mantle of green,
Thy spindle and twine unto me resign.
And take thou my arrows so keen.
And when that Robin Hood was so arrayed,
He went straight to his company;
O who is yonder, said little John,
That now comes over the lee;
An arrow I will at her let flee.
So like an old witch looks she.
O hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin then
And shoot not thy arrows so keen;
I am Robin Hood, thy master good,
And quickly it shall be seen.
The bishop he came to the old woman's house,
And he called with furious mood,
Come let me soon see, and bring unto me,
That traitor Robin Hood.
The old woman she sat on a milk-white sleed,
Himself on a dapple gray;
And for joy he had got Robin Hood,
He rode laughing all the way.
But as they were riding the forest along,
The Bishop he chanced to see
An hundred bowmen brave and bold,
Stand under the greenwood tree,
O who is yonder, the bishop he said,
That is ranging within yonder wood?
Marry, said the old woman, I think it to be
A man called Robin Hood.
Who, who art thou, the bishop he said,
Which I have here with me?
Why I am an old woman, thou cuckoldy bishop,
Lift up my leg and see,
Then woe to me, the bishop he said,
That ever I saw this day:
He turned him about, but Robin Hood so stout,
Called to him and bid him stay.
Then Robin took hold of the Bishop's horse,
And tied him fast to a tree:
Then little John smiled his master upon,
For joy of that company,
Robin took his mantle from his back,
And spread it upon the ground,
And out of the bishop's portmanteau he
Soon took out five hundred pound.
So now let him go, said Robin Hood,
Said little John, that may not be;
For I vow and protest, he shall sing a mass,
Before that he go from me.
Then Robin Hood took the bishop by the hand,
And bound him fast to a tree;
And made him sing a mass, Got wot.
To him and his yeomen dree.
And then they brought him through the wood,
And set him on his dapple gray,
And gave him the tail within his hand,
And bade him for Robin Hood pray.
V. Robin Hood and the Butcher; showing how he bed the Sheriff of Nottingham.
TUNE -- ROBIN HOOD AND THE BEGGAR.
COME all you brave gall^nts and listen awhi^^
With a hey down, down, and a down, (...)
That are in the bower within,
For of bold Robin Hood, that arch^r good,
A song I intend to sing.
Upon a lucky time it chanced so,
Bold Robin in the forest did spy
A jolly butcher with a bonny fine mare.
With his flesh to the market did hie.
Good morrow, good fellow, said jolly Robin,
What food have thou? tell unto me;
Thy trade to me tell, and where thou do dwell,
For I like well thy company.
The butcher he answered jolly Robin,
No matter where I do dwell,
For a butcher I am, and to Nottingham,
I am going my flesh to sell.
What Is the price of thy flesh? said jolly Robin,
Come tell it soon to me;
And the price of thy mare be she never so dear,
For a butcher fain would I be,
The price of my flesh, the butcher replied,
I soon will tell unto thee;
With my bonny mare, and they are not dear,
Foor marks thou must give me:
Thy money come count, and then I will mount,
For a butcher I fain would be.
Now Robin he is to Nottingham gone,
His butcher's trade to begin:
With a good intent to the Sheriff's he went,
And there he took up his inn.
When other butchers did open their shops,
Bold Robin he then began.
But how for to sell, he did not know well,
For a butcher he was but young.
When other butchers no meat could sell,
Robin he got both gold and see,
For he sold more meat for one penny.
Than others could do for three.
But when he sold his meat so fast,
No butcher by him could thrive,
For he sold more for one penny,
Than others could do for five.
Which made the butchers of Nottingham
To study as they did stand,
Saying he is some great prodigal,
That has sold his father's land.
The butchers stepped to jolly Robin,
Acquainted with him for to be,
Come, brother, one said, we'll be all of one trade
Come will you go dine with me.
A curse to his heart, said jolly Robin,
That a butcher will deny,
I will go with you my brethren true,
And as fast as I can hie.
But when to the Sheriff's house they came,
To dinner they hied apace,
For Robin he, and the man must be,
Before them all to say grace,
Pray God bless us all, said jolly Robin,
And our meat within this place,
A cup of sack so good, will nourish your blood,
And so I do end my grace,
Come fill us more wine, said jolly Robin,
Let us be merry while we stay;
For wine and good cheer, be it never so dear,
I vow I the reckoning will pay.
Come, brothers, be merry, said jolly Robin,
Let us drink, and me^rily give over.
For the shot I will pay ere I go away,
If it cost me five pounds or more.
This is a mad blade, the butchers then said,
S^ys the Sheriff, he is some prodiga^,
That some land has sold for filver and gold
And now he does mean to spend all.
^ast thou any horned beasts, the Sheriff then said
Good fellow, to full unto me?
^es, that I have, good master Sheriff,
I have hundreds two or three
And an hundred acres of good free, land.
If you please it for to see.
And, I Will make you as good a ssurance of it,
A^ ever my father made me.
The Sheriff he saddled a good palfry,
And with three hundred pounds in gold,
Away be went with bold Robin Hood
His horned beasts so behold,
Away then the Sheriff and Robin did ride,
To the forest in merry Sh^^wood,
Then the Sheriff d^^ say, God bless us this day.
From a man they call Robin Hood.
But when that a little farther they came,
Bold Robin did chance for ^^^spy
A hundred head of good red^^^er,
Come tripping the forest full ^ign.
How like you my horned beasts, good master Sheriff?
They Are both sat and fair to see.
The Sheriff replied, I wish I were gone,
For I like not thy company.
Then Robin he set his horn to his mouth,
And show out strong blasts three,
Then quickly ^^on there came little John,
And all his company.
What is your will, master, said little John,
I pray you to tell unto me?
I have brought hither the Sheriff of Nottingham,
This day to dine with thee.
He is welcome to me, then said little John,
I hope he will honestly pay;
I know he has gold, and if it were told,
Will serve us to drink a whole day.
Then Robin took the mantle from his back,
And laid it on the ground,
And out of the Sheriff's fine portmanteau
He told out three hundred pound.
Then Robin brought him through the wood,
With a hey down, down, and a down,
And set him on his dapple gray,
O have me recommended to your a (...) at home,
So Robin went l^ughing away.
VI. Robin Hood and the Tanner; or Robin Hood met with his match.
TUNE -- ROBIN HOOD AND THE STRANGER.
IN Nottingham lives a jolly Tanner,
With a hey down, down, and a down,
His name is Arthur a Bland;
There is never a 'Squire in Nottinghamshire,
Dare bid bold Arthur to stand.
With a long pike staff upon his shoulder,
So well he can clear his way;
By two and by three he makes them to flee,
For he has no list to stay,
As soon as he went forth in a summer morning
Into the forest of merry Sherwood,
To view the red deer, that sport here and there
He met with bold Robin Hood.
As soon as bold Robin did him espy,
He thought some sport he might make,
Therefore out of hand, he bid him to stand,
And thus unto him did speak:
Why, what art thou, thou base fellow,
That ranges so boldly here?
In sooth to be so brief, thou lookst like a thief,
That comes to steal the King's deer.
For I am keeper in this forest,
The King has put me in trust:
To look to his deer that range here and there,
Therefore now slay thee I must.
If thou be'st a keeper in this forest,
And has such great command,
Yet thou must have more partakers in store,
Before thou make me to stand.
No, I have no more partakers in store,
Or any that I do need,
But I have a staff of a strong oak graff,
I know it will do thy need.
For thy sword and thy bow I care not a straw,
Nor all thy armor to boot;
If thou gettest a knock upon thy bare scalp,
Thou can as well shite as shoot.
Speak cleanly, good fellow, said jolly Robin,
And give better terms to me,
Else I Will thee correct for thy neglect,
And make thee more mannerly.
Marry gap with a wenion, quoth Arthur a Bland
Art thou such a goodly man?
I care not a fig for thy looking so big,
Mead thy self where thou can.
Then Robin Hood he unbuckled his belt,
And laid down his bow so long,
He took up a staff of a strong oak graff,
That was both stiff and strong.
I yield to thy weapons, said jolly Robin,
If thou will but yield to mine;
For I a have a staff of a strong oak graff,
Not half a foot longer than thine.
But let me measure said jolly Robin,
Before we begin our fray,
For I will not have mine longer than thine,
For that would be counted foul play.
I pass not for length, bold Arthur replied,
My staff is of oak so free,
Eight foot and a half will knock down a calf,
And I hope it will knock down thee.
Then Robin he could no longer forbear,
But gave him so hea^y a knock,
That quickly and soon the blood it ran down,
Before it was ten o'clock.
But Arthur he soon recovered himself,
And gave him a knock an the crown,
That from every hair of Robin's head
The blood ran trickling down,
Then Robin Hood raged like a wild boar
As soon as he saw his own blood;
And Bland was in hafie, and laid on so fast,
As if ^e'd been cleaving of wood.
And about, and about, and about they went.
Like two wild boars in a chase,
Striving with aim each other to maim,
Leg, arm, or any other place.
And knock for knock they lustily dealt,
Which held for two hours and more,
That all the wood rang with every b^ng,
They plied their work so sore.
Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood.
And let our bloody quarrel-fall.
For he^e we may thrash our bones all to mash,
And have no money at all.
And in the forest of merry Sherwood,
Hereafter thou shall be free --
Cry a ^^rcy for naught, my freedom I bought,
I may thank my staff but not thee.
What tradesman art thou, said jolly Robin,
Good fellow I pray thee me show?
And also me ^^tt where thou do d well,
For both of them sain would I know?
I am a tanner, bold Arthur replied,
In Nottingham long have I wrought;
And if thou come there, I vow and do swear,
I will tan thy hide for naught.
Cry a mercy, good fellow, said jolly Robin,
Since thou art so kind and free;
And if thou will tan my hide for naught,
I will do as much for thee.
But if thou will forsake thy tanner's trade,
And live in the green wood with me:
My name's Robin Hood, I swear by the wood,
I will give thee both gold and fee.
If thou be Robin Hood, bold Arthur replied,
As I think well thou art;
Then there is my hand, my name's Arthura Bland,
We two will never pant.
But tell me, O tell me, where is little John,
Of him fain would I hear,
For we are allied by the mother's side,
And he is my kinsman near.
Then Robin blew on his bugle horn,
And blew both loud and shrill:
But quickly and anon, appeard little John,
Come tripping down a green hill.
O what is the matter, then said li^le John,
Master I pray you me tell?
Why do you stand with your staff in your hand,
I fear that all is not well.
O man I do stand, and he makes me to stand,
The tanner that stands she beside,
He is a bonny blade, and master of his trade,
For soundly he ^ath ^anr'd my hide.
He is to be commend^^, then said little John,
And he shall tan my ^id^ too.
Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood
For as I do understand,
He Is ^^^^oman goo^ and of thine own blood,
For his name is Arthur a Bland;
Then little John threw his staff away,
As far as he could fling;
And run out of hand to Arthur a Bland,
And about his neck did cling.
With loving respect, there was no neglect,
They are neither nice nor coy;
Each other did face with a lovely grace,
And both did weep for joy.
Then Robin Hood took them by the hands,
And dane'd about an oak tree:
For three merry men, and three men.
And three merry men are we.
And ever hereafter as long as we live,
We three will be as one;
The wood it shall ring, and the old wives sing,
Of Robin Hood, Arthur, and John.
VII. Robin Hood and the jovial ^^^ker.
TUNE OF, SUMMER TIME.
IN summer time when leaves grow green,
Down, a down, a down.
And birds sing on every tree,
Robin Hood went to Nottingham,
As fast as he could dree;
And as he came to Nottingham,
A tinker he did meet.
And seeing him a lusly blade,
He kindly did him greet.
Where do thou live, quoth jolly Robin.
I pray thee now me tell?
Sad news, I hear, there is abroad,
I fear all is not well.
What is the news, the tinker said,
Tell me without delay?
I am a Tinker to my trade,
And live at Banbury.
As for the news, quoth Robin Hood,
It is but as I hear,
Two tinkers they were in the stocks
For drinking ale and beer,
If that be all, the tinker said,
As I may say to (...),
Your news is not (...),
Albeit they are (...),
For drinking of good ale (...),
You will not lose your (...)
No, by my faith, quoth Robin Hood;
I love it with all my heart.
What news abroad, quoth Robin Hood,
Tell me what thou do bear,
Being thou ^oest from town to town,
Some news thou need'st not fear,
The news I hear the tinker said,
I know it is for good,
It is to seek a bold out law
Which they call Robin Hood;
I have a warrant from the King,
To take him where I can,
If you c^n tell me where he is,
I will make you a man!
The king he would give an hundred pounds,
That he could but him s^e;
And if we can but now him get,
It will serve you and me
Let me see that warr^nt, said Robin Hood,
I Will see if it be right,
And I will do the bell I can,
For to take him this night,
Th^^ I will not, the t^^ker ^id,
None with it I w^ll trust:
And where he is if you will not tell,
Take him by force I must.
But Robin Hood perceiving well
How then the game would go,
If you will go to Nottingham,
We shall find him I know.
The tinker had a crab-tree staff,
Which was both good and strong,
Robin he had a good strong blade,
So they went both along.
And when they came to Nottingham,
There they took up their Inn;
And they called both for ale and wine,
To drink it was no sin.
But ale and wine they drank so fast,
The tinker he forgot,
What things he was about to do,
It fell so to his lot.
That while the tinker fell asleep,
He made then haste away,
And left the tinker in the lurch,
For a great shot to pay.
But when the tinker awakened,
And found that he was gone,
And called then for his kind host,
And thus he made his moan.
I had a warrant from the King,
That might have done me good,
That is to seek a bold outlaw,
Some call him Robin Hood.
But now my warrant and money's gone
Nothing I have to pay;
He that promised to be my friend,
He Is gone and fled away.
That friend you speak of said the host
They call him Robin Hood,
When that first he met with you,
He meant you little good.
Had I but known it had been he.
When that I had him here,
The one of us should try our strength.
Which should have paid full dear.
In the mean time I must away,
No longer here I Will abide,
But I will go and seek him out,
Wherever do betide:
But one thing I would gladly know,
What I have here to pay?
Ten shillings just, answered his host,
I Will pay without delay.
Or else take here my working bag,
And my good hammer too,
And if I light but on the knave,
I will then soon you pay.
The only way then said the host,
And not to stand in fear,
Is to seek him among the parks,
Killing of the king's deer.
The tinker he then went with speed,
And made then no delay,
Till he found out bold Robin Hood,
That he might have a fray.
At last he spied him in a park.
Hunting of the deer,
What knave is that, quoth Robin hood,
That comes me so near?
No knave, no knave, the tinker said,
And that you soon shall know;
Which of us has done most wrong,
My crab tree staff shall show.
Then Robin drew his gallant blade.
Made of the trusty steel,
But the tinker he laid on so fast,
That he made Robin reel.
Then Robin's anger did arise,
He fought most manfully,
Until he made the tinker then,
Almost fit to flee.
With that they laid about again,
They plied their weapons fast;
The tinker thresh'd his bones so sore
That made him yield at last.
A boon, a boon, Robin he cries,
If thou will grant it me,
Before I do it, the tinker said,
I Will hang thee on this tree.
But the tinker looking him about,
Robin his horn did blow;
Then came unto him little John,
And brave Will Scarlet too.
What is the matter quoth little John,
You sit on the high way side?
Here is a tinker that stands hard by,
That has paid well my hide.
That tinker then said little John,
That blade fain would I see;
And I would try what I could do,
If he will do as much for me.
But Robin he wish d t^em both,
They would the quarrel cease,
That henceforth they might be as one.
And ever live in pe^ce.
And for the jovial tinkers part,
An hun^rd pound I give
In the year to maintain him one,
As long as he does live,
In manhood he is a mettle man,
And a mettle man by trade,
I never thought that any man,
Should have made me so afraid.
And if he would be one of us,
We will take one face,
And whatsoever we dogs,
He shall have hi full strare.
So that the tinker was content,
With them to go along.
And ^ith them resolved a part to take,
And so I end my song.
VIII. Robin Hood and Allen-a-D^^^
Tune -- "ROBIN HOOD in a GREENWOO STOOD."
COME listen to me you gallants so free,
All you that love mirth for to hear,
And I will you tell (...) bold outlaw,
That lived in Northamptonshire
As Robin Hood in the forest stood,
All under the greenwood tree;
There was he aware of a brave young man,
As fine as fine may be.
Then stepped forth brave li^^^e John,
And Midge the miller's son,
Which made the young man bend his bow,
When be see them come.
Stand off, stand off, the young man said,
What is your will with me?
You must come before our master straight,
Under you greenwood tree.
And when he came bold Robin before,
Robin asked him courtoously,
O have thou any money to spare,
For my merry men and me?
I have no money; the young man said,
But five shillings and a ring;
And that I'have kept these soven son, years,
To have it at my wedding.
Yesterday I should have married a maid,
But she was from me ta^en;
And chosen to be an old Knight's delight,
Where by my poor heart was slain.
What is thy name? then said Robin Hood,
Come tell me without sail:
By the faith of my body, then said the young man,
My name is Allen a-Dale.
What will thou give me, said Robin Hood,
In ready gold or see,
I Have no money, then said the young man,
No ready gold or see;
But I will swear upon the book,
Thy true servant for to be,
How many miles is it to thy true love,
Come tell me without guile?
By the faith of my body, then said the young man,
It is but five little miles.
Then Robin he halled over the plain,
He did neither ^int nor^in,
Until he came into the church.
Where Allen should keep his wedding.
What do thou here, the Bishop then said,
I prithee now tell unto me?
I ^n a bold hurp^r, quoth Robin Hood,
And the best in the ^orth country.
O welcome, O welcome, the bishop the said.
That music best ple^seth the:
You have no music, quoth Robin Hood,
Till the ^^^le and bridegree^ I see.
With that came in a worthy knight,
Which was both grave and old,
And after him a finikin lass,
Did shine like the glittering gold.
This is not a fit match, quoth Robin Hood.
That you do seem to make here;
^or since we are come into the church,
The bride shall choose her own dear.
Then Robin Hood put horn to his mouth.
And blew blasts two or three
Then four and twenty bowmen bold
Came leaping over the lee.
And when they came to the churchyard,
Marching all in a row.
The first man was Allen a Dale,
To give bold Robin his bow.
This is thy true love, Robin he said,
Young Allen, as I hear say,
And you shall be married at the same time,
Before we depart away.
That may not be, the Bishop he said,
For thy words shall not stand;
They shall be asked three time in the church,
As the law is of our land,
Robin Hood pulled off the Bishop's coat,
And put it upon little John;
By the faith of my body, then Robin he said,
This coat does make thee a man.
When little John went to the choir.
The people began to laugh,
He asked them seven times in the choir,
Lest three would not be enough,
Who gives this maid? quoth little John,
Quoth Robin Hood, that do I,
And he who takes her from Allen a Dale,
Full dearly shall he buy.
And thus having ended the merry wedding,
The bride looked like a Queen;
And so they returned to the merry greenwood,
Among the leaves so green.
IX. Robin Hood, little John, and the Shepherd.
TUNE -- Robin Hood and Queen Catharine.
ALL gentlemen and yeoman bold,
Down, a down, a down.
I wish you to draw near.
For a story of bold Robin Hood,
Unto you I will declare.
As Robin Hood walked the forest along,
Some pastime for to spy,
There was he aware of a jolly shepherd,
That on the ground did lie.
Arise, arise, said jolly Robin,
And now come let me see,
What is in thy bag and bottle, I say,
Come tell it unto me.
What Is that to thee? thou proud fellow,
Tell me as I do stand,
What have thou to do with my bag and bottle?
Let me see say command.
My sword that hangs by my side.
Is my command I know:
Come let me taste of thy bottle,
Or may it breed thee woe.
The De'il a drop, thou proud fellow,
Of my bottle thou shall see,
Until thy valor here be tried,
Whither thou will fight or flee.
What shall we fight for? says Robin Hood,
Come tell it soon to me:
Here Is twenty pounds in good yellow gold,
Win it and take it thee.
The shepherd stood all in a maze.
And knew not what to say,
I have no money thou proud fellow,
But bag and bottle I Will lay.
I am content thou shepherd swain,
Fling them down on the ground;
But it will breed thee meikle pain,
To win my twenty pound.
Come draw thy sword, thou proud fellow,
Thou stand too long to prate;
This hook of mine shall let you know,
A coward I do h^^^ (...)
So they fell to it fu^^^ard and (...),
It was on a summer's day;
From ten till four in the afternoon,
The shepherd held in play.
Robin's buckler proved his chief defense,
And saved him many a bang;
For every blow the shepherd gave,
He made Robin's sword cry ^wang.
Many a sturdy blow the shepherd gave,
And that bold Robin found;
Till the blood ran trickling from his head,
Then he fell to the ground.
Arise, arise thou proud fellow,
And thou shall have fair play,
If thou will yield before thou go,
That I have won the day.
A boon, a boon, cried bold Robin Hood,
If that a man thou be,
Then let me take my buggle horn,
And I Will blow out blasts three.
Then said the shepherd to bold Robin,
To that I will agree;
For if thou should^^ blow till tomorrow morn,
I scorn the foot to flee.
Then Robin he set his horn to his mouth,
And he blew with might and main,
Until he spied little John,
Come t^pping over the plain.
Who is yonder, thou proud fellow,
That comes down yonder hill?
Yonder is little John, Ro^^n Hood's man,
Shall fight with thee thy fill.
What is the matter, says little John,
Master come tell unto me?
My case is bad, cries Robin Hood,
For the sheph^^d has conquered me.
I am glad of that, cries little John,
Shepherd turn thou to me;
For about with thee I mean to have,
Either come fight or flee.
The shepherd gave John a sturdy blow,
With his book under the chin,
Beshrew thy heart, said little John,
Thou basesy does begin,
Nay, that does nothing, says the shepherd,
Either yield to me the day,
Or I will bang thy back and sides,
Before thou go away.
Again the shepherd laid on him,
The shepherd he begun,
Hold, hold thy hand, cried bold Robin,
I yield the wager won.
With all my heart; said little John,
To that I will agree;
For he is the flower of shepherd swains,
The like I never did see.
Thus have you heard of Robin Hood,
Also of little John,
How a shepherd swain did conquor them,
The like was never known.
X. The famous Battle between Ro^in Hood and the Courtal Friar.
To a new Nothern TUNE.
IN summer time when the leaves grow green,
And flowers are fresh and gay,
Robin Hood and his merry men,
Were disposed to play.
Then some would leap and some would run,
And some use Artillery,
Which of you can a good bow draw,
A good archer to be^
Which of you can can kill a swift buck,
Or who can kill a do?
Or who can kill a heart of Greece,
Five hundred foot him him fro?
Will. Scadlock killed a buck,
And Midge he killed a do,
Little John a heart of Greece,
Five hundred foot him fro.
Joy on thy heart, said Robin Hood,
That shot luch a shot for me!
I Will ride my horse an hundred miles
To find one that can match thee.
That caused Will Scadlock to laugh,
He laughed heartily,
A Courtal Friar in Fountain-Abbey,
Will beat both him and thee,
The Courtal Friar in Fountain-Abbey,
Well can a strong bow draw,
We will beat you and your yeomen,
Se^ them all on a row.
Robin Hood took a solemn oath,
It was by Mary Free,
That he would neither eat nor drink,
Till the Friar he did see.
He took his bow into his hand,
It was of trusty tre^,
With a she^f of arrows by his side,
To Fount in-da^^^ent he
And coming to fair ^ountain-dale,
No farther would he ride;
There was he aware of the courtal Friar
Walking by the water side.
Robin Hood lighted off his horse,
And tied him to a thorn;
Carry me over thou courtal Friar,
Or else thy life's for^orn.
He took Robin Hood upon his back,
Deep water did bestride;
And spoke neither good word nor bad,
Till on the other side.
Robin stepped off the F^yar's back,
The Friar said again,
Carry me back thou fine fellow,
Or it shall breed thee pain.
Robin he took the Friar on his back,
Deep water did bestride,
And spoke neither good word nor bad,
Till on the other side.
The Friar leapt off Robin's back.
Robin Hood said again,
Carry me over thou courtal Friar.
Or It shall breed the pain.
The friar took him on his back again,
And stepped up to his knee,
And coming to the middle stream,
There he threw Robin in,
Robin Hood swam to a bush of broom,
The friar to a willow wand;
Bold Robin Hood is gone to shore,
And took his bow in hand.
One of his arrows in his belt.
At the friar he let fly,
The courtal friar with his buckler,
Did put the arrow by.
Robin Hood shot so passing well,
Till his arrows were all gone;
They took their swords and steel buckler:
And fought with might and main.
From ten of the mo^^ing of that day,
Till four in the, afternoon,
Then Robin Hood came on his knees,
Of the friar to beg a boon.
A boon, a boon, thou courtal friar,
I beg it on my knee,
To set my horn to my mouth,
And blow out blasts three.
That I will do, said the courtal friar,
Of blasts I have no doubt,
I hope thou wilt blow so passing well,
Till both thy eyes fall out.
Robin Hood set his horn to his mouth,
And blew out blasts three;
Then fifty yeomen with bows bent,
Came ranging over the lee.
Whose men are those, said the friar,
That come so hastily?
These are my men, said Robin Hood,
Friar what is that to thee?
A boon, a boon, said the courtal friar,
The like I give to thee?
To set my fist unto my mouth,
And for to whute whutes three;
That I will do, said Robin Hood,
Or else I were to blame,
Three whutes now in a fryar's fist,
Would make me glad and fain.
The friar set his fist to his mouth,
And so whuted whutes three;
Half a hundred great bay dogs,
Came running over the lee.
Here is for every man a dog,
And I myself for thee:
Nay by my faith, said Robin Hood,
Friar that must not be.
Two dogs to Robin Hood did go,
One behind and one before,
Robin Hood's mantle of Lincoln gree^^
Off from his back they tore.
And whether his men shot East or West,
Or they shot North or South:
The courtal dogs so taught they were,
Caught the arrows in their mouth
Take up thy dogs, said little John;
Friar I pray to thee;
Whose manart thou, said the friar,
That comes to prate to me?
I am little John, Robin Hood's man,
Friar I will not ly^^
If thou take not up thy dogs soon,
I Will take them up and thee.
Little John had a bow in his hand,
He shot with might and main;
Half a score of the fryar's dogs,
Lay dead upon the plain,
Hold thy hand, good fellow, said the friar,
Thy masler I will agree,
And we will have new orders taken,
With all that may be.
If thou forsake fair fountain-dale,
And fountain Abbey free,
And if thou go to Nottingham,
And there remain with me,
Every Sunday throughout the year,
Ch^ng'd shall thy garn ^a^s be,
The courtal friar kept fountain dale,
Seven long years and more;
There was neither Knight, Lord nor E^rl!
Could make him yield before.
XI. Robin Hood and the stranger.
To a New Tune.
COME listen a while you gentleman all,
With a hey down, down and a down,
That are in this bower within;
For a story of gailant Robin Hood,
I do purpose now to begin.
As Robin Hood walked the forest along,
It was in the midst of the day;
There was he aware of a daft young man,
As ever did walk on the way.
His doublet was of sine silk, he said,
His stockings like scarlot shone,
And he walked on the way,
To Robin Hood then unknown.
A herd of deer was in the bond,
Feeding before his face;
The best of you I Will have at my dinner,
And in a little space.
The stranger made no mickle ado,
But bent a right good bow,
The best buck in the herd he slew,
Forty good feet him fro.
Well shot, well shot Robin Hood,
That shot it was in time;
And if thou will accept of the place,
Thou shall be a yeoman of mine,
Go play the chiven, the strager said,
Make have and quickly go,
Or with my fist. be sure of this,
I Will give thee buffets store.
Buffet not me, quoth Robin Hood,
Altho^ I am forlorn;
Yet I have those to take my part,
If I but blow my horn.
Wind not thy horn, the stranger said,
Be thou never so much in haste,
For I can draw a good broad sword.
And quickly cut the blast,
Let Us take our swords and broad bucklers,
And gang under yonder green tree;
And I hope to be saved, the stranger said,
That shall be better quit.
The stranger drew a good broad sword,
Hit Robin Hood on the crown:
That from every hair of Robin's head,
'The blood ran trickling down.
Crave mercy, good fellow, quoth Robin Hood,
And for this thou have done,
Tell me good fellow, now what thou art,
Tell me wherein thou do won.
The strager answered bold Robin Hood,
I Will tell thee where I dwell;
In Maxwell I was bred and born,
My name is young Gamwell.
For killing of my father's steward,
Am fore'd to the English wood,
And for to seek an uncle of mine,
Some call him Robin Hood.
But art thou a cousin of Robin Hood's then!
The sooner we shall have done,
The stranger then said, as I hope to be said,
I am his own sister's son,
But O! what ^issing and courting was there,
When these two cousins did meet;
And they went all that summer's day,
And little John did not meet:
But when they met with little John,
He there unto them did say,
O master, O master where have you been?
You tarried so long away.
I met with a stranger, quoth Robin Hood then?
Full sore he has beaten me,
Then I Will have about with him, quoth little John
And try if he can bent me.
O no, O no, quoth Robin Hood then,
Little John that may not be so,
For he is my own dear sister's son,
And cousins I have no more.
And he shall be a yeoman of mine,
My chief man next to thee;
And I Robin Hood, and thou little John,
And Scarlet he shall be.
XII. Robin Hood and Queen Catharine.
TO A NEW TUNE.
GOLD taken from the King's harbingers,
Down a-down a-down,
As seldom has been seen;
And carried by bold Robin Hood
For a present to the Queen
If that I live one year to an end,
Thus did Queen Catharine say,
Bold Robin Hood I Will be thy friend,
And all thy yeomen gay.
The Queen is to her chamber gone,
As fast as she can wen,
She calls unto her lovely page,
His name was Dick Parrington.
Come hither to me my lovely page,
Come hither unto me,
For now thou must to Nottingham,
As fast as thou can dree.
And as thou go to Nottingham,
Search all the English wood,
Enquire of one good yeoman or other,
That can tell you of bold Robin Hood.
Sometimes he went, sometimes he ran,
As fast as he could wen,
And when he came to Nottingham,
There he took up his inn.
There sat a yeoman by his side,
Tell me sweet page, quoth he,
What is thy business, or the cause
So far in the north Country?
This is my business, and my cause, sir,
I Will tell you for good,
To enquire of some good yeoman or other,
To tell me of bold Robin Hood.
I Will get my horse betimes in the morn,
Be it by break of day,
And I Will show you bold Robin Hood,
And all his yeomen gay.
When that he came to bold Robin Hood,
He fell upon his knee,
Queen Catharine, she does greet you well,
She greets you well by me.
She bids you post to London court,
Not fearing any thing,
For there shall be a little sport,
And has sent you a ring.
Robin took his mantel from his back,
It was of Lincoln green,
And sent it by this lovely page,
A present to the Queen.
He clothed his men in Lincoln green.
Himself in scarlot red,
Black hats white feathers, all alike,
Now bold Robin Hood in red.
And when he came to London court.
He fell down on his knee,
You Are welcome Locksly, said the Queen.
And all thy yeomon dree.
The King is gone to Finsbury field,
Marching in battle array,
And after follows bold Robin Hood.
And all his yeomen gay.
Come hither Topus, said the King,
Bow-bearing after me;
Come measure me out with this line,
How long our mark shall be,
What is the wager said the Queen,
That must I now know here?
Three hundred tun of Rhenish wine,
Three hundred tun of Beer.
Three hundred of the fattest heart,
That run on Dallen Lee?
That Is a princely wager, said the King,
That I must needs tell thee.
With that bespeak one Clifton then,
Full quickly and full soon,
Measure no mark, my sovereign liege,
We'll shoot at sun and moon.
Full fifteen score your mark shall be,
Full fifteen score shall stand,
I Will lay my bow said Clifton then.
I Will cleave the willow wand.
The king's archers did leap about,
Till it was three in one;
The ladies began to shout,
Madam, your game is gone.
A boon, a boon, Queen C^tharine crier.
I crave it on my knee,
Is there never a knight in your privy council
On Queen Catharine's side will be?
Come hither to me Sir Richard Lee,
Thou art a knight full good,
For I do know by thy pedigree,
Thou sprangest from Gower's blood.
Come hither thou Bishop of Hereford,
For a noble priest was he;
But my silver mitre, said the Bishop then.
I Will not bet one penny.
The King has archers of his own,
Full ready and full right;
And these be Strangers every one,
No man knows what they height.
What will thou bet, said Robin Hood,
Throw it down on the ground.
Ninety-nine angels, said the Bishop,
It Is near an hundred bound.
Robin Hood took his bag from his side,
And threw it on the green:
Will, Sc^dlock went smiling away,
I know who this money must win.
With that the King's archer's led about,
While it was three and three:
With that the ladies gave a shout,
Woodcock beware thy knee.
It is three and three now, said the King,
The next three pays for all,
Robin Hood went and whispered to the Queen,
The King's part shall be but small.
Robin Hood be then led about,
He shot it under hand;
And Clifton with a bearing arrow,
He clove the will^w (...).
And little Midge the miller's son,
He that not much the worse,
He sho^ within a singer of the prick;
Now Bishop beware of thy purse.
A boon, a boon Queen Catharine cries,
I crave on my bare ^uee,
That you will angry be with none
That is of my party
They shall have forty days to come,
And forty days to go.
And three times forty to sport and play,
Then welcome friend or so.
You Are welcome Robin Hood, said the Queen,
And so is, little John,
So is little Midge the miller's son,
Thrice welcome every one.
Is this Robin Hood? quoth the Bishop then,
As it seems well to be?
Had I known it had been that hold outlaw,
I would not have bet one penny:
He took me late one Saturday night,
And bound me fast to a tree,
And made me sing a mass (God w^ot)
To him and his yeoman dree.
What if I did? said Robin Hood,
Of that mass I was full fain:
For recompense of that he says,
Here Is half thy gold again.
Now nay, now nay, says little John,
Master, master, that shall not be,
We must give gifts to the King's officers,
That gold will serve thee and me.
XIII. Robin Hood's chase: Or, a merry progress between Robin Hood and King
Henry; showing how Robin Hood led the King a Chase from Nottingham to London;
and when he had taken his leave of the Queen he returned to merry Sherwood.
TUNE -- Robin Hood and the Beggar.
COME gallants all you I do call,
With a hey down, a down, a down,
That is now within this place,
For a song I will sing of Henry our King.
And how he did Robin Hood (...).
Queen Catharine she a match did make,
As plainly does appear,
For three hundred tun of good red wine,
And three hundred tun of beer.
But yet she had her archers to seck,
Their bows and arrows so good;
But her mind was bent with full intent,
To send for Robin Hood.
But when hold Robin Hood he came there,
Queen Ca^^^r^e did say,
Thou art welcome, Locksly, said the Queen,
And all thy yeoman gay.
For a match of ^^oting I have made,
Thou on my part must be:
If I miss the mark; be it light or dark,
Then Hanged will ^^be,
But when the game came to pla^^
Bold (...) nigh,
With his mant^e of green, most brave to be seen,
He let his arrows fly.
And when the court it ended was,
Bold Robin won it with a grace,
Ant after the King was angry with him,
And vowed he would him chase.
What though his pardon granted was,
While he with him did stay,
But yet the King was vexed with him,
When he was gone his way.
After from court the King did hie,
In a furious angry mood,
And often inquired both far and near,
After bold Robin Hood?
But when the King to Nottingham came,
Robin Hood was in the wood:
O come said he and let me see
Who can find bold Robin Hood.
But when bold Robin Hood he did hear,
The King had him in chase.
Then said little John, it is time to be gone,
And go to some other place.
Then away they went from merry Sherwood,
And into Yorkshire did hie:
And the King did follow, with a troop and a hollow.
But could not him come nigh.
Yet jolly Robin he passed along
And went straight to Newcastle (...) a
And there they stayed hours two or three,
And then he for Berwich was ^^ne.
When the King he did see how Robin did flee,
He was vexed wondrous sore,
With a hoop and a hollow, he vowed for to follow.
To take him, or never give over.
Come now let us away, then said little John,
Let any man follow that dare:
To Carlisle w'll hie with our company,
And so then to Lancaster,
From Lancaster then to Chester they went,
And so did good King Henry,
But Robin away, for he durst not stay,
For fear of some treachery.
Says Robin come let us to London go,
To see our noble Queen's face,
Is may be she wants our company,
Which makes the King us chase.
When Robin came Queen Catharine before,
He fell upon his knee,
If it please your Grace, I am come to to this place,
For to speak with King Henry.
Queen Catharine she answered bold Robin again.
The King is gone to Sherwood,
And when he went away unto me did say,
He would go and seek bold Robin Hood.
Then fare you well my cracious Queen,
To Sherwood I Will hie apace,
For fain I would fee what he would have with me,
If I could meet with his Grace.
But when King Henry he came home,
Full weary and vexed in mind,
And that he did hear Robin Hood had been there
He blamed (...) fortune unkind.
You are welcome home Queen Catharine cried,
Henry my sovreign liege,
Bold Robin H^^d that archer good,
Your person has been to seek.
And when King Henry he did hear,
Robin Hood had him to seek,
This answer be gave, he is a cunning knave,
For I have ^ought him three weeks.
A boon, a boon, Queen Catharine cried,
I beg it of your grace.
To pardon his life, and breed no more strife,
And so ends Robin Hood's chase.
XIV. Robin Hood's Golden Prize; Showing how he robbed two Priests of five
hundred pound.
I HAVE heard talk of Robin Hood,
Derry, derry down.
And of brave little John,
Of friar Tuck and Will Scarlet,
Locksly and Maid-marrien.
(...) such a tale as this before,
I think there was never known,
For Robin Hood disguised him^^^^,
And from the wood is gone,
Like to a friar bold Robin Hood,
Was accoutered in his array,
With hood, gown, beads and crucifix,
He past along the way;
He had not gone miles two or three,
But it was his chance to espy,
Two lusty priests clad all in black,
Come riding gallantly.
Bendicte, then said Robin Hood,
Some pity on me take,
Cross you my hand with a single groat,
For our dear Lady's sake.
For I have been wandering all this day,
And nothing could I get,
Not so much as one poor cup to drink,
Nor bit of bread toe^t.
Now by our dame, the priest replied,
We never a penny have,
For this morning we have been robbed,
And could no money save.
I am much afraid, said bold Robin Hood,
That you both tell a lie:
And now before you do go hence,
I am resolved to try.
Then Robin Hood laid hold on them both,
And pulld them down from their horses,
O spare us, friar, the priests cried out,
On us have some remorse,
You said you would no money, quoth Robin Hood,
Therefore without delay,
We three will fall down on our knees,
And fo^^ some money we will pray.
The priests they could not now gainsay,
But down they kneeled with speed;
Send us, oh send us, then quoth they,
Some money, to serve our need.
The priests did pray with mournful cheer,
Sometimes their bands they wrung,
Sometimes they wept and wrung their hands,
Whilst merrily Robin sung.
When they had been praying an hour's ^^^ce,
The priests did still lament,
Then quoth bold Robin, now let us see,
What money heaven has sent.
We will be tharers all alike,
Of money that we have:
And there is never one of us
That his fellow shall deceive.
The priests their hands in their pockets put,
But money could find none,
We'll se^ch ourselves said Robin Hood,
E^ch other one by one.
Then Robin Hood took pains to search them,
And he found good store of gold,
Five hundred pieces presently
Upon the grass he told.
Here is a brave show, said Robin Hood,
Such store of gold to see;
And you each one shall have a part,
'Cause you prayed so heartily.
He gave them fifty pounds a-piece,
And the rest for himself he kept:
The priests durst not speak one single word,
But they sighed wondrous deep.
With that the priests rose from their knees.
Thinking to have parted so;
Nay, stay, said Robin Hood, one thing more
I have to say ever you go.
You shall be sworn, said Robin Hood,
Upon this holy grass,
That you will never tell lies again,
Which way soever you pass.
He then set them on their horses again,
And away then did they ride;
And he returned to the merry Greenwood,
With great joy, mirth, and pride.
XV. Robin Hood's rescuing Will Stutley from the Sheriff and his men, who had
him taken Prisoner, and were going to hang him.
TUNE -- Robin Hood and Queen Catharine.
When Robin Hood in the Greenwood stood
Derry, derry down,
Under the greenwood tree,
Tidings there came to him with speed.
Tidings with certainty.
That Will Stutely surprised was,
And eke in prison say,
Three variets which the King had hired,
Did likewise him betray.
Aye, and to-morryw hanged must be,
Tomorrow a^ ^^^n as it is day.
But before they could this victory get,
^^tely did two of them slay.
When Robin Hood heard this news,
Oh he was grieved sore;
Aye, and to his merry men said,
Who altogether swore,
That Will Stutely should rescued be,
And be brought back again;
Or else should many a gallant right
For his s^ke there be slain.
He clothed himself in scarlet then,
His men were all in green;
A fairer sight throughout the world,
In no part could be seen.
Good sir, it was a gallant fight,
To see them on a row,
With every man a good broad sw^rd,
And eke a good yew bow.
Forth of the greenwood they are gone,
Yea all courageously,
Resolving to bring Stutely home,
Or every man to die.
When they came to the castle near,
Wherein Will Stutely lay;
I hold it good, said Robin Hood,
We here in ambush stay.
And send one forth some news to hear,
To yonder P^lmer fair,
That stands under the castle wall,
Some news he may declare.
With that steps forth a brave young man,
Which was of courage bold:
Thus did he to the old man say,
I pray the Palmer old,
Tell me if that thou rightly ken,
When must Will Stutely die?
Who Is one of bold Robin Hood's men,
And here does prisoner lie.
Alas! alas! the Palmer said,
And forever woe is me,
Will Stutely hanged must be this day,
On yonder gallows tree.
Oh had his noble master known,
He would some succor seed,
A few of his bold yeoman dree
Full soon would him befriend.
Aye, that is true the young man said,
Aye, that is true, said he;
Or if they were near to this place,
They soon would set him free.
But fare-thee well thou good old man,
Farewell, and thanks to thee:
If Stutely hanged be this day,
Revenged his death shall be.
He was no sooner from the Palmer gone,
The gates were opened wide,
And out of the castle Will Stutely came
Guarded on every side.
When be forth of the castle come,
And saw no help was nigh,
Thus he did say unto the sheriff,
Thus he said gallantly,
Now seeing that I at last must die,
Grant me but one boon, says he,
For my noble master never had a man
That yet was hanged on a tree,
Give me my sharp sword in my hand,
And let me be unbound,
And with thee and thy men I Will fight,
Till I die on the ground.
But this desire he would not grant,
His wishes were in vain;
For the sheriff had sworn he hanged should be.
And not by the sword be slain,
Do but unhind my hands he said,
I will no weapon crave,
And if I hanged be this day,
A whipping let me have!
Oh no! oh no! the sheriff said,
On the gallows thou shall die;
Aye, and thy master too,
If in my power does lie!
Oh dastard coward, Stutely he cries,
Faint hearted peasant slave.
If ever my master do thee meet,
Thou shall thy payment have.
My noble master thee does scorn,
And all thy cowardly crew;
Such silly imps unable are,
Bold Robin to subdue.
But when he was to the gallows come,
And ready to bid adieu,
Out of a bush lept little John,
And stepped Wiill Stutely to.
I pray the Will before you die,
Of thy dear friends take leave;
I needs must borrow him awhile,
How say you master sheriff?
Now as I live, the sheriff he said,
That varlet well I know;
^ome thirdy rebel is that same.
Therefore let him not go.
With that little Jo^, so hastily,
Away out stutel, bands,
And from one of the sheriff's ^en,
A sword twitcht from his hands.
Here Will take thou the some a while,
Thou can it better sway.
And here defend thyself from guile,
For aid will come str^itway.
And there he turn (...) them back to back,
In the middle of that fray,
Till Robin Hood approached near,
With many an archer gay.
With that an arrow by them sent,
I wist from Robin Hood;
Make haste, make haste, the sheriff said,
Make haste, for it is good.
The sheriff is gone, his doubtful men.
Thought it no boon to stay,
But as their master had them taught,
They ran full, fast away.
Oh stay, oh stay. Will Stutely said,
Take leave ever you do depart,
You never will catch bold Robin Hood,
Uniess you dare him start.
Oh I Will betide you, quoth Robin Hood,
That you soon are gone,
My sword may in the seabbar rest,
For here our work is done.
I little thought when I came here,
When I came to this place,
For to have met with little John,
Or seen my master's face,
Thus Stutely was at liberty set,
And safe brought from (...) for;
O thanks, O thanks to my master,
Since here it was not so.
And once again my brethren all,
Shall in the greenwood meet,
Where we will make out bow-strings twang,
Music for us most sweet.
XVI. The noble Fisherman: or, Robin Hood's Preferment. Showing how he won a
prize on the Sea, and how he gave one half to his Dame and the other to the
building of Alm-houses.
TUNE -- In Summer time, etc.
IN Summer time when leaves grow green,
When they grow both green and long,
Of a bold outlaw called Robin Hood,
It is of him I sing this song;
When the lily leaf and cowslip sweet,
Does bud and spring with merry cheer,
This outlaw was weary of the wood side,
And chasing of the fallow deer.
The fisherman brave, more money have,
Than any merchant two or three;
Therefore I will at Scarborough go,
That I a fisherman may be.
This outlaw called his merry men all,
As they sat under the greenwood tree:
If any of you have gold to spend,
I pray you heartily spend it with me.
Now, quoth Robin Hood, I Will to Scarborough go
It seems to be a very sine day;
Who took up his Inn, in a widow woman's house,
Hard bye under the waters gray;
Who asked of him, where wast thou born
Or tell me where thou do fare?
I am a poor fisherman said he then,
This day entrap'd all in care.
What is t^^ name' thou fine fellow,
I pray thee heartily tell me?
In my own counery where I was born,
Men called me Simon over-the-lee.
Simon, will thou now be my man,
And good round wages I Will give thee?
I have as good a ship of my own,
As any that sails upon the sea.
They plucked up anchor and away did sail,
More of days than two or three:
But Simon espied a ship of war,
That sailed to him vigorously.
O woe is me, said the master then,
This day that I was born,
For all the fish that we have got
Is every one lost and forlorn:
For these French robbers on the sea.
They will not spare, no, not one man,
But c^rry us to the coast of France,
And lay us in a prison strong.
But Simon said, do not fear them,
Nor master take you any care,
Give me my bent bow in my hand,
And never a french man will I spare.
Then straight they boarded the French ship,
The crew lying dead in their sight:
They found within the ship of war,
Twelve thousand pounds in money bright.
One half of the ship, said Simon then,
I Will give to my dame and children small,
The other half of the ship, my friends,
I Will share among you all.
But now bespoke the master then,
Not so, Simon, it shall not be,
For you have won it with your own hands,
And the owner of it you shall be.
It shall be so as you have said,
And with this gold, for the oppressed
An habitation I will build,
Where they shall live in peace and rest.
XVII. Robin Hood's delight: or a merry combat fought between Robin Hood. Will
Sc^rlet, and three stout keepers, in Sherwood forest.
TUNE -- Robin Hood, and Queen Catharine.
There Is some talk of Lords and Knights,
Down, a down, a down,
And some of yeomen good,
Lo, I will tell you of Will Scarlet,
Little John, and Robin Hood.
As they walked the forest along,
Upon a summer day,
There were they aware of three foresters,
Clad all in green array.
Why, who are you, cried bold Robin,
Who speak so boldly here!
We three belong to King Henry,
And are keepers of his deer.
If you are keepers of his deer,
Then we be rangers good,
And we'll make you know before we go,
That you have met with Robin Hood.
We be content, thou bold out law,
Our valor here to try,
And w^'^l make yon know before we go,
We'll fight before we fly.
So they fell to it full hard and sore,
It was on a midsummer day,
From eight o'clock. till two and past,
They all showed gallant play.
There Robin, Will, and little John,
They fought full manfully,
Till all their wind was spent and gone,
Then Robin aloud did cry.
O hold, O hold, cried bold Robin,
You be men of valor stout;
Come and go with me to Nottingham,
And there we will fight it out;
With a butt of sack we will bang it abcut,
To see who wins the day,
And for the cost, make you not doubt
I have gold and money to pay:
And ever hereafter so long as we live,
We all will brethren be,
For I love those men with heart and hard,
That will fight and never flee
So away they went to Nottingham,
With sack to make amends,
For three days space, they wine did chase,
And drank themselves to friends.
XVIII. Robin Hood and the Beggar; Showing how he and the Beggar fought, and
changed clothes. How he went a begging to Nottingham.
TUNE -- Robin Hood and the Stranger.
COME listen to me, you gentlemen all,
With a hey down, down, and a down,
That mirth do love for to hear,
And a story true I Will tell unto you,
If that you will but draw near.
Upon a time it chanced so,
Bold Robin was merry disposed,
His time to spend he did intend,
Either with friends or soes;
And riding toward fair Nottingham,
Some pastime for to spy,
There was he aware of a jolly beggar,
As ever he heheld with his eye;
Good speed, good speed, said Robin Hood then,
What country man tell unto me?
I am of Yorkshire, sir; but ere you go far,
Some charity give unto me?
I have ^o money, said Robin Hood then,
But a ranger within the wood,
I (...) an outlaw, as many does know.
My name is Robin Hood.
But yet I must tell thee, bonny beggar,
That a bout with thee I must try;
Thy coat of gray lay down I say,
And my mantle of green shall lie by,
Content, content, the beggar he cried,
Thy part shall be the worse,
For I hope this bout to give thee the rout,
And then have at thy purse.
And fighting there full hard and sore,
Not far from Nottingham town:
They never fled till from Robin's head
The blood ran trickling down:
Oh hold thy hand, said Robin Hood then,
And thou and I will agree;
If that be true the beggar he said,
Thy mantle give unto me,
Now a change, a change, said Robin Hood,
Thy bags and coat give me,
And this mantle of mine^ I Will to thee resign,
My horse and my bravery.
XIX. Robin Hood, Will Scarlet, and little John or, A narrative of their
Victory obtained against the Prince of Arragon and the two Giants: And how Will
Scarlet married the Princess.
TUNE -- Robin Hood: or, a hey down a down.
NOW Robin Hood, Will Scarlet and little John,
Are walking over the plain,
With a fat buck, which Will Scarlet,
With his strong bow had slain.
Jog on jog on, cries Robin Hood,
The day it runs full fast,
For though my nephew me a breakfast gave,
I have not yet broke my fast.
With that he took his bugle horn,
Full well he could it blow;
Strait from the woods come marching down
One hundred tall in a row.
Stand to your arms, cries Will Scarlet,
Lo, the enemy are within ken:
With that Robin Hood he laughed aloud,
Cries, they are my bold yeomen.
Who when they arrived, and Robin espied,
Cried, master what is your will?
We thought you had in danger been,
Your horn did sound so shrill.
Now nay, now nay, quoth Robin Hood.
The danger's past and gone;
I Would have you welcome my nephew here,
That has paid me two for one.
In feasting and sporting they passed the day,
Till Phoebus was sunk in the deep;
Then each one to his quarter hy'd,
His guard there for to keep.
Long had they not walked within the greenwood,
But Robin he soon espied
A beautiful damsel all alone,
That on a black palfrey did ride.
Her riding suit was of sable hue,
Black Cypras over her face,
Through which her rose like cheeks olid blush,
All with a comely grace.
Come tell me the case, thou pretty o^^e,
Quoth Room, and tell me ^right
From whence thou came, and whit^ ^er thou go
All in this mournful plight?
From London I came, the dam^e^^ plied,
From London upon the Thames,
Which circled is, Oh! grief to tell,
Besieged with goreign arms.
By the proud Prince of Arragon,
Who swe^rs by his martial band,
To have the Princess to his spouse,
Or else to w^iste this land.
Except that champions can be fou^^ad
That dare figh^ three to three,
Against the Prince and giants twain,
Most horrid for to see;
The Princess shall be the victor's prize,
The King has vowed and said,
And he that shall the conquest win,
Shall have her to his bride.
But all in vain we sought them about,
Yet none so bold there are,
That dare adventure life and blood,
To free a^lady fair,
This news ^^ruck Robin to the heart,
He fell down on the grass;
His actions and his troubled mind
Showed h^ perplexed was.
Where lies your grief, quoth Will Scarlet,
O master tell to me?
If the damsel eyes has piere'd your heart,
I Will fetch her back to thee.
Now nay, now nay, quoth Robin Hood,
She does not cause my smart;
But it is the poor distressed Princess
That woun^s me to the heart.
I will go fight the giants all,
To set the lady free;
Then since its so, quoth little John,
I will be one of thy company.
Mast I stay behind? quoth Will Scarlet,
No, no, that must not be;
I Will make the third man in the fight,
So we'll be three to three.
These words ch^er'd Robin to the heart,
Joy the one within his face;
Within his arms he hugged them both,
And kindly did embrace.
Quoth he, we'll put on motley gray,
With long staves in our hands:
A scrip and bottle by our fides.
As if come from the holy lands.
Now they are on their journey gone,
As far as they may speed;
Yet for all their haste, ever they arrived,
The Princess forth was led.
To be delivered to the Prince,
Who in the list did stand,
Prepared to fight, or else receive,
His lady by the hand.
With that he walked about the lists,
With giants by his side;
Bring forth quoth he your champions,
Or bring me forth my bride.
This is fourth and twenty day,
The day perfix'd upon,
Bring forth my bride, or London burns,
I swear by Acheron.
Then cries the King and Queen likewise,
Both weeping as they spoke,
Lo, we have brought our daughter dear,
Whom we are forced to forsake.
With that stepped out bold Robin Hood,
Cries he, my liege, not so,
Such beauty as the fair princess,
Is not for tyrant's mow.
And for those two Goliahs there,
That stand on either fide,
I have two little David's here,
That soon can tame their pride.
The trumpets began to sound a charge,
Each singled out a man,
Their arms in pieces soon were hewed,
Blood sprang from every vein.
The prince he reached bold Robin a blow,
He struck him with might and main;
Forced him to reel about the field,
And thought he had been slain.
Crave mercy, quoth Robin, for that blow,
The quarrel shall soon be tried,
This stroke shall show a full divorce,
Betwixt thee and thy bride.
From his shoulders he cut his head,
Which on the ground did fall,
And grumbling sore at Robin Hood.
To be so dealt withal.
The giants then began to rage,
To see their prince lie dead.
Thou will be the next quoth little John,
Except thou guard thy head:
With that his falchion wheeled about,
It was both keen and sharp,
He clove the giant to the belt.
And cut in twain his heart.
Will Scarlet well had played his part,
The giant brought to his knee:
Quoth Will the De'll cannot break his fast,
Unless he have all three;
So with his falchion run him through.
A deep and ghastly wound,
Who damned and foamed, cursed and blasphemed,
And then fell to the ground
Now all the lists with shouts were filled.
The skies they did resound.
Which brought the princess to herself,
Who was fallen in a swoon.
The King and Queen and Princess fair,
Came walking to that place,
And gave the chan (...)
And did (...)
Tell me, quoth the King, whence you are,
That thus disguised came?
Whose valor speaks that noble blood
Which runs through every vein.
A boon, a boon, quoth Robin Hood,
On my knee I do it crave;
By my crown, quoth the king, I grant,
Ask what -- and thoushalt have.
Pardon I beg for my merry men,
Which are in the greenwood,
For little John, and Will Scarlet,
And for me, bold Robin Hood.
Art thou Robin Hood? then quoth the King,
For the valor you have shown,
Your pardon I do freely grant,
And welcome every one,
Then did the Princess view all three,
With a sweet and lovely grace,
She took Will Scarlet by the hand,
Said here I make my choice.
With that a noble Lord stepped forth,
Of Maxfield Earl was he,
Who looked Will Scarlet in the face,
Then wept most bitterly.
Quoth he, I had a son like thee,
Whom I loved wondrous well;
But he is gone, or rather dead,
His name was young Gamwell,
Then Will Scarlet fell on his knee,
Cries, Father, father here,
Here kneess your son, your young Gamwell,
You said you loved so dear.
But oh! what embracing and kissing was there,
When all these friends were met:
They Are gone to the wedding, and then to the bedding,
And so I bid you good night.
XX. Little John and the four Beggars.
TUNE -- Robin Hood and the Beggar.
ALL you that delight to spend some time,
With a hey down, and a down,
A merry song for to sing;
Unto me draw near, and you shall hear
How little John went a begging.
As Robin Hood walked the forest along,
And all his yeomen dree;
Says Robin, some of you must a begging go,
And little John it must be thee.
Says John, if I must a begging go,
I will have a Palmer's weed;
With a staff and coat, and bags of all sorts,
The better then shall I speed.
Now little John is a begging gone,
Seeking for some relief;
But of all the beggars he met on the way,
Little John he was the chief.
But as he was walking himself alone,
Four beggars he chanced to spy,
Some deaf, some blind, and some came behind,
Says John, here is brave company.
Good Morrow, said John, my brethren dear,
Good fortune I had to see;
Which way do you go? pray let me know,
For I want some company.
Stand thee back thou crooked carl,
And take that knock on the crown;
Nay, said little John, I Will not yet begone,
For a bout I will have with you round.
John nipp'd the dumb, and made them roar,
And the blind that could not see;
And he that had been cripple seven years,
He made him run faster than he.
Then he got out of the beggar's cloak,
Three hundred pound in gold;
Good fortune had I, said little John,
Such a good sight to behold.
And you begging trade I will give over,
My fortune has been so good,
Therefore I Will not stay, but I will away
To the forest of merry Sherwood.
Then Robin Hood took little John by the hand,
And dane'd about an oak tree,
If we drink water while this does last,
Then an ill death may I die
XXI. Robin Hood and the Ranger.
TUNE -- Arthur a Bland.
WHEN Phoebus had melted the 'cicles of ice,
With a hey down, down, and a down,
And likewise the mountains of snow,
Bold Robin Hood would ramble to see,
To frolic abroad with his bow:
He then did behold a forester bold,
Who cried out, friend, whither so fast?
I Am going, quoth Robin, to kill a fat buck,
That my merry men may all feast.
You Would best have a care, said the forester then,
For these are his majesty's deer;
Before you shall shoot, the thing I Will dispute,
For I am head forester here.
Bold Robin be gave him many hard blows,
The other returned them as fast;
At every stroke their jackets did smoke,
Three hours the combat did last.
At length in a rage the bold forester grew.
And cudgelled bold Robin so sore,
That he could not stand, so shaking his head,
He cried, let us freely give over.
Then Robin Hood set his horn to his mouth,
A blast then he merrily blows;
His yeomen they hear, and soon they appear
A hundred with trusty long bows.
Lo, these are my yeomen, quoth Robin Hood,
And thou shall be one of my train,
A mantle and bow, and a quiver also,
I Will give thee whom I entertain.
The forester willingly entered the list,
They were such a beautiful sight;
Then with a long bow they shot a fat do,
And made a rich supper that night.
What singing and dancing was in the Greenwood
For joy of another new mate;
With mirth and delight they spent the long night,
And lived at a plentiful rate.
XXII. Robin Hood rescuing the Widow's 3 Sons from the Sheriff when going to be
executed.
TUNE -- In Summer time, etc.
ROBIN Hood is to Nottingham gone,
With a link a down, down and a day,
And there he met a silly old woman,
A weeping along the highway.
What news, what news, thou silly old woman,
What news have thou for me?
Said she there are three Squires in Nottingham
To day condemned to die.
Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone,
With a link a down, down and a day,
And there he met the proud Sheriff,
Walking along the highway:
O save, O save, O Sheriff! he said,
What to day will you give unto me?
Some suits and pence, the Sheriff replied,
Today is a hangman's fee.
I was never a hangman in my life,
Nor yet intends the trade,
But cursed be he, said ^old Robin,
That first was a hangman made.
I have a horn in my pocket, said he,
I got from Robin Hood,
O wind thy horn, the Sheriff then said,
Let Us hear if it blows good.
The first loud blast that he did give,
He blew both loud and shrill,
A hundred and fifty of Robin Hood's men
Came riding over the hill
They took the gallows from the slack,
They set it in the glen,
They hanged the proud Sheriff on that,
And released the three poor men.
XXIII. Robin Hood and the valiant Knight.
TUNE -- Robin Hood and the fifteen Foresters.
WHEN Robin Hood and his merry men all
Had reigned many long years,
The King was then told they had been too bold
To his Bishops and noble peers.
Therefore he called a Council of state,
To know what was best to be done,
For to quell their pride or else it was feared
The land would be overrun
Having consulted a long summer's day,
At length it was agreed,
That one should be sent to try the event,
And fetch him away with speed.
Therefore, a trusty most worthy Knight,
The King was pleased to call,
Sir William by name, when to him he came,
He told him his pleasure and all.
Go then from hence to bold Robin Hood,
Bid him without more ado,
Surrender himself, or else the proud elf
Shall suffer with all his bold crew.
He wandered about till at length he came
To the tent of bold Robin Hood;
His business he shows, bold Robin arose,
And there on his guard did stand,
They Would have me surrender, quoth Robin Hood,
And lie at their mercy then;
But tell them from me, that never shall be,
While I have seven score men
Then Robin set his horn to his mouth,
And blew a blast or twain;
And so did Knight, at which there in sight,
The archers came all amain.
The archers on both sides bent their bows,
And the clouds of arrows flew;
The very first fight, that honored Knight
Did there bid the world adieu.
At length they went off, the party they went,
For London with right good will,
