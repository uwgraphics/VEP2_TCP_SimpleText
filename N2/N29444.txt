Mr. Thomas Walley, For many Years Preacher of Gods Word in London, and of late
the Reverend Pastor of the Church of Christ in Barnstable in New England, Who
departed this Life on the Sabbath Morning, March 24 th 1677/8. Being newly

Ingentes dolores stupent. Psalm. 37. 37. Mark the perfect man and behold the
upright, for the end of that man is peace. Dignum laud virum Musa (...)
How many hearts do now with tears lament.
The loss of this so rich an Ornament?

My troubled heart cannot tell how to rest,

(...) all this bitter loss deplore;
(...)oor-Orphan Church, God (...) you from the dust:
You're now dejected. God in all is just;
By sending him God raised you very high,
His death does make you now distressed lie;
Bereaved Church thou vineyard of the Lord,
The farewell Counsel which he did afford
From Isa. fifth, what could have been done more
For this my Vineyard, which has had such store
Of Soul enriching means of fruitfulness?
This makes provoking your great barrenness
Let this remembered be and laid to heart
Lest God in wrath again from you depart;
Converting work, and building up in grace,
He minded most in's Ministerial race.
How many Souls by hearing of his voice
Allured were of Christ to make their choice?
Blind eyes were opened, those who did him hear,
From darkness unto light they turned were;
When he shall wake at Resurrection-day,
Before the face of Christ the Judge, he'I say
Lo here am I, my great Redeemer free.
Lo here the Children thou have given me:
Alas poor Children, is your Father gone?
Are you left desolate now to bemoan
The death of him whom you shall see no more?

But not (...) Pastour's (...)one, whose (...) eyes
You often saw lifted up in Sacrifice
Of prayer to God, whom he by Faith did see
And shall behold to all Eternity;
Mourn for your loss, but for his happiness,
You must in this your sorrow joy express;
Mourn not as hopeless, God who did him give
Though he be dead, yet does for ever live,
And lives to be a Fountain of supply
To Souls that unto him for food do cry;
Implore his grace now Moses meek is dead,
That by a gracious one thou may be led,
By one as pious a(...) as wise as he,
Then will this mourning Church most happy be;
The widow now behold (...) desolate.

They cannot but lament, and grieve, and mourn

They with your Father now rejoice together;
Happy those Souls that safely are come thither!
Your Fathers God love in (...)ncerity,
And you shall live with him aeternally.
Lead such a life as your blessed Father led,
And you will be blessed after you are dead.
What sweet assurance of his Fathers love?
And what sweet breathings after Christ above
With what delight did he his Christ embrace
How did he long to see God face to face?
