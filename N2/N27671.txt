Inscribed to the Memory OF THE AMERICAN FABIUS, BY DOCTOR ISAAC BALL, OF
NEW YORK.

Reader! If thou art an American, Behold the tomb with reverence and regret,
Where rest the remains of George Washington.

The kindest relation, the truest friend, the warmest patriot, the worthiest
man.

He exercised virtues in an age, Sufficient to have distinguished him even in
the best.

Sagacious by Nature, Industrious by Habit, Inquisitive with Art.

He gained a complete knowledge of the state of America, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.

He served his Country always, At every age and in every station.

This was the bent of his generous soul: This was the business of his laborious
life.

Public men and public things, He judged by one common standard, The true
Interest OF THE United States.

He made no distinction of party.

Gentle, Humane, Disinterested, Beneficent, He created no enemies on his own
account:

FIRM, DETERMINED, INFLEXIBLE, He FEARED NONE he could create in the cause of
AMERICA.

READER! In this misfortune of thy Country, lament thy own:

FOR KNOW -- The loss of so much PRIVATE worth Is a PUBLIC calamity.
