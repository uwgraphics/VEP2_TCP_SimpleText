By the GENERAL COURT Held at Boston, October the tenth, 1677.
WHereas the Lords ways toward his people are often mixed with Mercies and
Judgments, and are so toward our selves at present; the Holy and wise God
keeping us under his Rod in diverse respects; justly chastising us for our many
and great provocations of the eyes of his glory; for which we have great reason
to ly in the Dust, and to implore his Compassions: And yet on the other side we
have cause to acknowledge that this year past his mercies have been manifold,
giving us Peace in a great measure, with a rich Blessing on the Fruits of the
Earth, and hitherto mercifully preventing so great a spreading of Infectious
Diseases that have been amongst us, as was rationally feared by many: As also
frustrating the hopes of our Malicious Adversaries, and graciously considering
us in the midst of our fears, giving us favor in the eyes of our Sovereign
Lord the King, and his most honorable Council; as Letters received from our
Agents do fully inform us: besides many other benefits that the Lord is pleased
to be loading us daily with, whereby we are greatly obliged to offer the
sacrifice of praise, and bless his Holy Name:

This Court do Order, Appoint, and Set apart, the fifteenth of November next,
to be kept a day of Thanksgiving unto God, throughout this Jurisdiction:
Prohibiting all Servile Labors upon that day, and enjoining all the Churches,
Ministers and People within this Colony, solemnly, and seriously to keep the
same accordingly.

Dated at Boston this 10 th day of October, 1677. By the General Court, Edward
Rawson, Secr't.
