NEW SONG, Sung by Mr. Darby, jun. in the Pantomimical Dance, called The
Sailor's Landlady. WORDS BY MRS. ROWSON. MUSIC BY MR. REINAGLE.
HOW blessed the life a sailor leads,
From clime to clime still ranging,
For as the calm the storm succeeds,
The scene delights by changing.
When tempests howl along the main,
Some object will remind us,
And cheer, with hopes to meet again,
The friends we left behind us.
CHORUS.
For, under snug sail, we laugh at the gale;
And, though landsmen look pale, never heed 'em;
But toss off the glass, to a favorite lass,
To America, commerce, and freedom.
And when arrived in sight of land,
Or safe in port rejoicing,
Our ship we moor, our sails we hand,
Whilst out the boat is hoisting.
With cheerful hearts the shore we reach;
Our friends, delighted, greet us;
And tripping lightly over the beach,
The pretty lasses meet us.
CHORUS.
When the full flowing bowl enlivens the soul,
To foot it we merrily lead 'em;
And each bonny lass will drink off her glass,
To America, commerce, and freedom.
Our prizes sold, the chink we share,
And gladly we receive it;
And when we meet a brother tar
That wants, we freely give it:
No freeborn sailor yet had store,
But cheerfully would lend it:
And when it is gone, to sea for more;
We earn it, but to spend it.
CHORUS.
Then drink round, my boys; it is the first of our joys
To relieve the distressed, clothe, and feed 'em;
It Is a duty we share, with the brave and the fair,
In this land of commerce and freedom.
(Price three cents.) M. Carey, Printer.
