Proclamation. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
WHEREAS it appears, that a state of War exists between Austria, Prussia,
Sardinia, Great Britain, and the United Netherlands, of the one part; and
France on the other, and the duty and interest of the United States require,
that they should, with sincerity and good faith, adopt and pursue a conduct
friendly and impartial toward the Belligerent Powers:

I HAVE THEREFORE THOUGHT FIT by these presents, to declare the disposition of
the United States to observe the conduct aforesaid toward these Powers
respectively; and to exhort and warn the citizens of the United States
carefully to avoid all acts and proceedings whatsoever, which may in any manner
tend to contravene such disposition.

And I do hereby also make known, that whosoever of the citizens of the United
States shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture under the Law of
Nations, by committing, aiding or abetting hostilities against any of the said
Powers, or by carrying to any of them those articles, which are deemed
contraband by the MODERN usage of nations, will not receive the protection of
the United States, against such punishment or forfeitures; and further, that I
have given instruments to those Officers, to whom it belongs, to cause
prosecutions to be instituted against all persons, who shall, within the
cognizance of the courts of the United States, violate the Law of Nations, with
respect to the Powers at War, or any of them.

In Testimony whereof, I have caused the Seal of the United States of America
to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand. Done at the
City of Philadelphia, the twenty-second day of April, one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of
America, the seventeenth.

GO. WASHINGTON.
