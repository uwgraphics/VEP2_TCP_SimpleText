THE INQUISITOR; OR, Invisible Rambler.

IN THREE VOLUMES.

BY MRS. ROWSON, AUTHOR OF VICTORIA.

SECOND AMERICAN EDITION.

VOLUME I.

PHILADELPHIA: Printed for MATTHEW CAREY, Bookseller, South Market Street, near
Fourth. -- 1794 --

TO LADY COCKBURNE, THE FOLLOWING PAGES ARE MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED, AS A SMALL
MARK OF THE GRATITUDE WHICH WILL EVER GLOW UNDIMINISHED (while life remains) IN
THE BREAST OF HER LADYSHIP'S MUCH HONORED, OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT,

SUSAN ROWSON.

THE PREFACE.
I CANNOT for my life see the necessity of it, said I; there are numbers of
books published without prefaces.

But you do not consider, said my friend, that this book absolutely requires a
preface -- it is the adventures of a gentleman who possessed a magic ring: and
seemingly those adventures are written by himself, but you give no account how
they came into your hands?

Why they came into my hands through my brain, friend, said I. -- These
adventures are merely the children of Fancy. I must own that the best part of
them originated in facts.

But why do you make your Inquisitor a man? said he.

For a very obvious reason, I replied. A man may be with propriety brought
forward in many scenes, where it would be the height of improbability to
introduce a woman. -- I might, to be sure, continued I, have introduced the
following pages by saying I had found them in a hackney-coach; or met with part
of them by accident at a pastry-cook's or cheese-monger's, and being interested
by the narrative, I sent back for the remainder; or they might have been left
in a lodging by some eccentric old gentleman, who had lived there for many
years; and thinking the world would be greatly obliged to me for suffering such
a valuable manuscript to be printed, I was prevailed on by the earnest
entreaties of my friends, to commit it to the hands of the bookseller.

I know, Sir, this is the usual method of ushering these kind of publications
into the world -- but, for my own part, I will honestly confess that this work
was written solely for my amusement. As to the motives that induced me to
publish it, they can be of no consequence for the reader to be informed of,
therefore they shall remain a secret.

But sure, said my friend, you will make some apology for attempting to write
in the style of the inimitable Stern?

Is the person required to make an apology who copies a portrait painted by an
eminent master, said I; or should he fail of retaining, in his copy, the fine
strokes, the beautiful and striking expression in the features of the faultless
original; is he to tear his picture, or commit it to the flames, because he has
not the genius of the artist whose work he copied? Or, suppose a man admired
his Sovereign's exalted virtues, and with a laudable ambition strove to imitate
them; is he, because he is conscious of not having the abilities to shine in
the most eminent degree, not to endeavor to imitate them at all; or to hide
from the world the progress he makes?

No, certainly, said my friend; but have you the vanity to suppose that your
writings are the least tinctured with that spirit and fire, which are so
conspicuous in the works of your bright original?

By no means, said I; but I think, as the stars shine brightest when neither
the sun nor moon are in the firmament, so, perhaps, when the works of Stern
are not at hand, the Inquisitor may be read with some small degree of
attention, and afford the reader a little amusement; but should Maria or Le
Fevre make their appearance, its weak rays will be extinguished by the tear of
sensibility, which the love-lorn virgin and dying soldier would excite.

Then you do not intend to write a preface? said my friend.

Upon my word, I replied, I have begun several, but I never could write one to
please me; so I have at last determined to publish it without, and leave it to
the readers to form what conjecture they pleased concerning how I came
possessed of the papers which contained the adventures.

That will never do, said he, shaking his head.

Then prithee, my good friend, said I, do write a preface for me; for here I
have been hammering my pericranium and biting my nails these two hours, without
being able to beat out a single sentence, either introductory or prefatory.

Suppose, said he, you present your readers with our conversation; it will be
better than no preface at all.

It was a lucky thought, and I instantly set about it.

Gentle Reader, I here commit to your kind patronage this offspring of Fancy;
my characters are not pointed at particular persons, except one or two, where
gratitude involuntarily guided my pen; it was then I delineated the characters
of a Lady Allworth, and the family of the amiable sisters at H-m -- rs -- th.

As to those characters which appear in an unamiable light, I neither wish or
mean for any person to say that this is meant for Mr. or Mrs. such a one; but I
would wish every person who may think the character was designed for
themselves, to remember that the likeness was accidentally taken, and it is
conscience only that makes it appear so striking to their imagination.

THE INQUISITOR, etc.
THE PETITION.
I SHOULD like to know the certainty of it, said I* putting the petition into
my pocket. -- It contained an account of an unfortunate tradesman reduced to
want, with a wife and three small children. -- He asked not charity for
himself, but them. -- I should like to know the certainty of it, said I --
there are so many feigned tales of distress, and the world is so full of
duplicity, that in following the dictates of humanity, we often encourage
idleness -- Could I but be satisfied of the authenticity of this man's story, I
would do something for him.

Will your honor please to send an answer? -- said the child, that brought the
petition.

I had forgot her -- by the unaffected innocence of her countenance, she could
scarcely have seen nine years. -- Meekness smiled in her sweet eyes -- what a
lovely flower, said I -- it is a pity the chilling breath of sorrow should visit
thee too rudely -- I gave her half a guinea, and bid her tell her father to
come to me the next morning.

THE WISH.
How happy should I be, if some good fairy, as in days of yore, would give me
the power of visiting, unseen, the receptacles of the miserable, and the
habitations of vice and luxury. -- What a satisfaction I should feel in
rewarding and supporting merit; or withdrawing the veil, and discovering the
hideous aspect of hypocrisy. Besides, says self-love, I should then have an
opportunity of discovering the sentiments of the world concerning myself. I
should find my real friends, and detect my enemies. -- If half my fortune could
procure such a power, I would freely give it.

Search your heart, replies a soft voice, and see if it is not an unwarrantable
curiosity, rather than a real wish to do good, that now inspires you.

It is strange, said I; I hear a voice, but see no person near me; surely I do
not dream!

Be not surprised, continued my invisible companion, I am your guardian genius,
and have it in my power to comply with your wishes, provided they are corrected
by reason. -- Look on that table, and you will see a ring, which, when on your
finger, will render you invisible; and, as long as humanity, honor, or
friendship, leads you to use it, it will contribute to your happiness; but
whenever you endeavor to make it subservient to any unworthy purpose, it will
lead you into innumerable difficulties.

I thanked the kind genius, instantly seized the treasure, put it on my finger,
and, eager to try the experiment, walked out.

THE STREET.
I WILL bet you ten to one, said a noted gambler to another; -- they were walking
arm in arm -- I Will bet you ten to one I am married before this day fortnight.
-- You are a lucky dog, Cogdie, replied his companion, to obtain so lovely a
woman as Melissa, and twenty thousand pounds into the bargain.

D -- n the woman, said the wretch, it is money I want: by Heavens I have not
five guineas left in the world, and am twice as many hundred in debt. If I do
not succeed in this matrimonial scheme, I shall go to limbo. -- There Is an old
prying cat of a maiden aunt stands devilishly in the way, or I could easily
dupe the old dad. -- As to Melissa herself, she is such a mere simpleton in the
ways of the world, that it requires but a small share of art to make her
believe almost any thing.

By this time they had reached the house of the intended victim, when finding
my ring had the desired effect, I entered the house with her betrayer. His
companion wished him good morning, and I, without hesitation, followed him up
stairs.

THE DRAWING ROOM.
A VENERABLE old man was sitting on a sopha; the hoary ornaments of his head
inspired the mind with awe, while the benignity of his countenance encouraged
and invited friendship. -- Beside him, reading Thomson's Seasons, sat his
daughter, lovely and blooming as Aurora, when with rosy fingers, on a sweet May
morn, she unbars the gates of light. -- As Cogdie approached, her features were
enlivened with a glow that plainly told me her heart was not her own; and the
cordiality with which her father received him, evinced the integrity of his own
heart, as he suspected not the integrity of another. After the usual
compliments, the little party being seated, Cogdie informed the old gentleman
that he had been prevented the honor of dining with him that day by a
tradesman, to whom he owed about thirty pounds, which, as he had not lately
received remittances from his father, he found it inconvenient just then to
pay; that the man would take no denial, but had threatened to arrest him. I
must be obliged to borrow this paltry sum, continued he, till I can write again
to my father. -- You shall not be distressed for such a trifle, said the old
gentleman, I will lend it you.

He left the room to get the money, when the unfeeling Cogdie made use of that
opportunity to persuade the heedless unsuspecting Melissa to elope.

Thou art worse than a midnight ruffian, said I -- thou art stealing the peace
of a man who is at this moment contributing to thine. They had just time to
appoint the day, hour, and place of rendezvous, when Melissa's father returned
with the money. -- I had heard enough, and quitted the room as the old
gentleman entered.

THE REFLECTION.
THAT a man who has a wife and numerous family of children, and sees them
plunged in the deepest distress, should rob to keep them from starving, is not
a matter of surprise -- and while stern Justice holds the balance, angel-like
pity gently turns the scale. But that a man in full health and vigor, with
strength and abilities to support himself, who has no weeping wife or famished
children to urge him to the deed, should cozen and defraud his best friend,
debauch the morals of an innocent girl, and plunge her into ruin, only to
obtain a larger share of sordid ore, is to me unaccountable. It is an act that
makes humanity shrink back aghast: Justice, with frowns, unsheaths her sword,
and pity weeps but for the offender's crimes.

I will rescue Melissa, said I -- she may hereafter thank me. The thought
filled my mind with unusual complacency. -- I enjoyed in idea the satisfaction
and gratitude of her father, when he beheld his darling rescued from the jaws
of destruction.

It was a fine evening in the month of June; so removing the ring from my
finger, I stepped into a fruiterer's, purchased a bottle of strawberries,
walked into the Park, and seated myself in one of the chairs. -- My mind was at
that moment a sort of vacuum, my thoughts unemployed, when casting my eyes upon
the paper that covered the strawberries, I perceived it was part of a fairy
tale, but wrote in an uncommon poetic style.

THE FRAGMENT.
FAIR Cynthia now, bright Empress of the night,
Mounted her azure throne, with diamonds studded;
Her modest face, veiled in a fleecy cloud,
Which, as it partly hid, heightened her beauties.
When fair Alzada, weary and forlorn,
Pensive sat down beside a murmuring stream,
With naught to shield her from nocturnal dews,
Saving an ancient oak, whose sturdy boughs
Had braved the storms of many a winter past.
Her lovely head reclined upon her hand;
Her eyes were raised with fervor toward Heaven*
In those bright orbs started a pearly drop,
Which, as it fell, another took its place,
And that, too, fell and kissed its pleasing way
In quick succession down her ruby cheeks.
" Ah! me," she cried, " how wretched is my fate,
" Forced from my royal parents, and my home*
" What hospitable roof will now receive me,
" Or where shall poor Alzada lay her head.
" In this lone wild I see no trace of mortals;
" No lowing herds bespeaks a mansion near:
" No bleating flock breaks this most solemn silence;
" And ere another heavy hour is past,
" Perhaps some savage monster, fierce for prey,
" On me may satisfy his craving hunger."
The genius Abradan he held her sorrows;
In a plain rustic form concealed his own,
And thus addressed the sadly weeping fair:
" Fair daughter of affliction, follow me;
" I come to lead you to a festive board,
" Where social mirth and innocence preside,
" And where the smiling host shall bid you welcome."
The trembling princess left her mossy seat,
And without speaking, followed her kind guide.
When sudden clouds obscured the face of Heaven;
The thunders rolled, the forked lightnings flashed,
And all around was horror and amazement;
Alzada sunk in terror to the ground.
A death-like swoon sealed up each active sense.
The tempest ceased. She raised her fearful eyes,
And saw before her a fair lofty palace:
The gates were solid brass; and the supporters
Marble, twined round with vine leaves wrought in gold.
She entered, and was instantly surrounded
By seven young virgins, clad in azure blue,
With alabaster vases in their hands,
Who paid the homage to a princess due.
They shed around her numberless perfumes,
And over her threw a robe, of spotless white,
Then led her to a room within the palace,
Where, on a throne of amethyst and gold,
There sat a monarch of majestic port;
Who, rising, welcomed the admiring princess,
And placed her on a shining throne beside him.
They brought her baskets of the choicest fruits,
And water from the purest limpid stream.
Alzada, being refreshed, rose from her seat,
And thus addressed the master of the feast:
" Whoever thou art, great king, whose magic power
" Has brought me to this place, where farthest Ind'
" Seems to have empti'd her exhaustless store
" To add to its magnificence:
" Say, can you guide a helpless wand ring maid,
" To find the home where late she was so blessed;
" From whence the sorceress Zeluba forced her,
" And left her parents to bewail her loss."
To which the monarch, with a smile, replied,
" Lovely Alzada, fairest of thy sex,
" Whose charms triumphant rule this royal heart,
" Dry up thy tears. By this right hand I swear,
" Ere Phoebus harnesses his fiery steeds,
" And leaves his seagreen couch to visit mortals,
" I will conduct you to your father's court,
" And guard you from the vile Zelubia's power.
" Slaves bring my chariot. Bid the virgins wait,
" And strew fresh flowers wherever Alzada treads."
The chariot was of curious workmanship,
Ivory, gold, coral, and precious stones;
Around it hovered little laughing loves;
And on each side were ranged fair village maids,
With lutes and harps, tabors and shepherds' pipes,
Singing and playing soft harmonious airs.
Eight milk-white steeds,
I turned the paper, but there was no more -- There are times when the mind is
affected by mere trifles; such now was my case -- I was vexed at not finding
the conclusion of the story, and determined to go back to the fruiterer's, and
inquire if they had the remainder. -- A few moments brought me to the place.

THE FRUITERER's.
A CROWD was assembled before the door. Forgetting what I came for, friend,
said I -- addressing myself to the master of the shop, can you tell me the
cause of this bustle? -- It is a very extraordinary one, Sir, he replied. -- A
boy about ten years old, going to a shop hard by to purchase something for his
mother, was recollected by a tradesman to whom his father owed a considerable
sum of money, and who had just before employed a bailiff to arrest him. -- The
man inquired of the child where his father lived, and upon his refusing to
tell, offered him money, and promised him a great many fine things, but finding
that plan equally ineffectual, he proceeded to threats. Upon which, the boy
burst into tears, and seating himself upon some steps opposite, declared he
would stay there all night, rather than give them an opportunity of sending his
father to jail.

The boy has the spirit of a Roman, said I. -- How many a man will feel the
blush of conscious guilt upon his cheek, when he shall be told of this; for,
Oh! shame to humanity and manhood, how many would sell their country through
avarice, or betray it through fear. -- While this magnanimous boy refuses a
bribe, though poverty might induce him to take it, and dares brave the threats
of an inhuman wretch, rather than betray his father, though his childhood might
excuse even cowardice. -- I will go and speak to the creditor, said I --
perhaps I may persuade him to drop his design of arresting the poor man, and
then I will follow the boy home.

THE CREDITOR.
PRAY, Sir, how much does this boy's father owe you?

Eighteen pounds, replied the man.

And are you really distressed for the money?

No; thank my prudence for that; I have taken care of the main chance, and not
like Heartfree, loved others more than myself.

I fear you have not loved them so well, my friend.

Why no, to be sure! I follow the first law of nature, self-preservation.

And why not follow the first rule of Christianity, to do as you would be done
by?

Why look ye, Sir; I always pay my debts punctually, and I expect others should
pay me as punctually.

Certainly. -- But suppose a man who has an honest heart, should, by
unavoidable misfortunes, be rendered unable to discharge his debts; is it not
better to trust to his honor, rather than by confining him, put it entirely out
of his power to pay you at all?

Trust to his honor -- eh! you know but little of this world, to talk at that
rate: why this very Heartfree was ruined by trusting to a person's honor. An
old officer lodged in his house for many years, borrowed money of him, run in
his debt for linen for his whole family, and when I have talked to Heartfree
about the impropriety of his conduct in not asking for payment, he would answer
-- I am sure he will pay me whenever he has it in his power -- but before it
was in his power, he died, leaving four children without the least support. The
eldest was about twenty; a fine young girl to be sure, but she had been brought
up in idleness. She could embroider, draw, dance, sing, and play upon the
spinnet; but that would not keep her; so I advised Heartfree to try and get her
a place to wait on a lady. To put the two young girls out apprentice, and take
the boy to go of errands, clean shoes, knives, etc. in his own kitchen; but he,
forsooth, said no; the children of a man who had spent his days in the service
of his country, should never want an asylum while he had a house; nor the
innocent orphans want a friend, while he lived: so he married the eldest, and
put her sisters to school, where, luckily, they both died. -- The boy he sent
to the East Indies about seven years ago, after spending an enormous sum on his
education. -- His wife bred very fast, and was quite the fine lady; so what
with extravagance, and a few losses, from being one of the first linen-drapers
in the city, he has become a bankrupt, and, as I suppose, has not bread to eat.

And for his humanity, said I -- you would reward him with a prison; rob his
wife and children of their only comfort, the presence of their father and their
friend -- and of what use will it be to you?

I don't know that it will be of much use to me, he replied; but it will teach
Heartfree to remember himself before others, another time.

The remembrance of what he has done for others, said I, so far from sitting
painful on his mind, will smooth the thorny pillow of distress, and make even a
prison pleasant; he shall sleep soundly on a bed of straw, and dream of those
whose sorrows he has lightened, while you shall feel scorpions on a bed of
down: nor shall the sweet restorer of tired nature visit you, unless it be to
fright you with some dreadful vision of prisons and starving wretches.

I turned from him with honest indignation, and calling to the fruiterer, gave
him the money to discharge the debt. -- I would not trust myself to speak to
the man again, who could so shamefully trample on the laws of humanity. -- The
poor boy was weeping, his face hid with his hands. Go home, child, said I --
your father's debt is paid. He staid not to thank me; but the pleasure that
sparkled in his eye, the agility with which he sprang from his seat, and flew
toward his home, conveyed a greater pleasure to my heart, than the most
eloquent effusions of gratitude. -- I was willing to be a witness of his
relating the story to his parents; so putting on my ring. I followed him unseen.

THE FAMILY.
As I ascended a narrow winding staircase, I perceived in a small room, the
door of which was partly open, an elegantly-formed woman, sitting on the side
of a wretched bed, on which lay a man, the picture of famine. On her knee sat a
lovely infant, who with her little hand was wiping off the tears that trickled
down her mother's cheeks. -- The little boy, breathless with impatience, rushed
into the room -- Papa -- Mamma -- it is paid -- you shall not go to prison -- I
would not tell where you lived; indeed he was very angry; but that good
gentleman --

My dear boy, cried the fond mother, why do you talk so incoherently? Who has
frightened my child? What is the matter with you?

He endeavored to tell his story with propriety. -- It was in vain, joy had
entirely unconnected his ideas; but he made himself understood.

Oh! thou sensualist, could thou but in imagination taste the luxury of my
feelings at this moment, thou would henceforth forego the gratification of
thy grosser appetites, to feast thy mind with the highest of human pleasures.

I saw the honest fruiterer enter with some supplies which I had judged might
be necessary for people in their condition. He repeated every circumstance,
only concealing my name.

I was preparing to leave the room, when a child entered, whom I instantly knew
to be my little petitioner -- I will see thee again tomorrow, said I -- but
will now seek my lovely Emma, and engage her in thy behalf.

THE RESOLUTION.
IT was more than I could conveniently afford, said I -- when I found how much
money I had expended. Twenty pounds is a good sum, but it will cost me much
more before I have placed Heartfree in a situation more suitable to his merit
-- but no matter, I will discharge one of my servants: why should I keep two
footmen, when a man of greater worth is in want of even the common necessaries
of life? -- my dear Emma will, I am sure, agree to this proposal. -- My phaeton
and horses, too, I will dispose of; one carriage is enough; what business have
I with superfluities? the money this requires will be much better employed in
relieving the unfortunate. I will be generous, but I will not be imprudent --
my Emma, and her dear little Harriet, shall not suffer for my benevolence.

I had reached my own mansion; a smile of cheerfulness, that ever graced my
Emma's face, bade me welcome.

I communicated my proposal, and related Heartfree's case. -- She smiled
assent, and the smile was rendered doubly enchanting, accompanied by the tear
of sensibility.

Retiring, I passed through my Harriet's chamber -- sweet are the slumbers of
the innocent. I feasted my eyes upon her infant beauties, and retired to rest
with a mind so serene, that I envied not the greatest monarch, and forgave even
my bitterest enemies.

THE MORNING RAMBLE.
WHO will pretend to say that early rising does not afford us many pleasures,
and contribute to our health? -- how charming to see the beauteous orb of day,
rising supremely bright, to enliven nature, and tinge with gold the lofty
mountains' tops. -- The country is the place to enjoy these beauties; but even
near London we may find pleasant walks. -- I had ascended a hill -- how
charming was the prospect -- fields crowned with rising plenty; the peasants
blithly singing as they labor. -- These people seem happy, but they are not to
be envied; they work hard for their bread, and if their rude, unpolished minds
are callous and unfeeling in distress, they are likewise insensible to many of
the pleasures that await them; the works of nature afford them no satisfaction,
because they cannot contemplate their beauties; yet their minds are suited to
their station; refinement would be no blessing to them, and the best security
the peasant has for happiness, is ignorance.

These were my reflections, as I rambled toward Hampstead.

Give me a draught of milk, my dear, said I, to a rosy damsel. -- She blushed,
curtsied aukwardly, and complied -- she trembled as she presented it.

Were you ever in love? said I, as I took the milk.

Never but once, and please your honor.

And are you not in love now?

No.

No! and how happens that?

I am going to be married tomorrow.

And you don't think love necessary in matrimony?

Father says I shall love my husband as soon as I am married.

And pray who was you in love with?

Colin; his cottage was close to ours; we were born on the same day, and when
we were children we used to play together. If Colin had some fruit he would
save a part for me; and when strange gentlemen or ladies gave him halfpence,
he shared them with me: when we grew older, he would tend my sheep, watch my
young lambs, and bring home my cows; and if I Would had a brother, your honor, he
could not have been kinder, nor, I am sure, I could not have loved him better;
so he axed father to let us be married; but Colin was but a shepherd's boy, and
I was father's only child, so he said he could give me fifty pounds, and I
might have a match better than Colin -- so we kissed and parted -- and
tomorrow I am to be married to farmer Willson, who is old and lame, but he
says I shall have a mort of fine things -- though, to tell the truth, I had
rather wear my own linsey jacket, and be married to Colin.

And so you shall, my sweet simple rustic, said I -- Her father was one of my
tenants -- I took out my pocketbook, wrote a line or two on my tablet, and
bade her give it to her father.

What a curse this pride is, said I, as I directed my steps toward London --
but that this haughty dame should stoop to inhabit a cottage, is wondrous
strange -- Why a peer of the realm could but have made his daughter miserable,
to preserve the dignity of his house, but in the name of common sense, what has
a peasant to do with pride of family?

THE INN YARD.
MY dear friend, you are heartily welcome to town, said a spruce-dressed
citizen, as he helped his country friend to alight from the Norfolk stage. Pray
come home with me; I expect you will make my house your own while you stay in
town; there is nothing in my power I will not do to make it agreeable to you. I
have depended upon your company; my whole house is at your service.

This over-acted complaisance made me suspect his sincerity, or that he had
some sinister point in view; so putting my ring on my finger, I followed them
home.

THE DISCOVERY.
I AM greatly obliged to you, said the country gentleman, as he sat down to the
breakfast table; the invitation you have given me is very acceptable; I have
lost the estate I have been so long at law about, for want of sufficient
evidence; and after I have paid the costs, I shall not have more than two
hundred pounds left, with which I mean to purchase an annuity; therefore I
shall make your house my home, till I can settle my affairs.

It may be some time before you can settle your business to your satisfaction,
replied the citizen, his features contracting into cold civility; and I expect
a gentleman to take my first floor in about a week; I am very sorry I cannot
accommodate you longer.

My dear Mr. Woollet, cried the wife, hastily entering, I am vastly glad to see
you.

Mr. Woollet has lost his lawsuit, my dear, said the husband.

The smile of welcome was instantly changed into a look of amazement -- She had
advanced to give him her hand, but on his attempting to salute her, she
withdrew her cheek, exclaiming I am sorry for his disappointment -- and began
to make the tea.

He drank two dishes of tea, and then asked his friend to lend him two guineas.
-- He had it not in the house. -- Trade was very precarious -- again mentioned
his expected lodger, and recommended a mean room to his friend, at half a crown
per week, in an obscure lane in the city.

Oh! self-interest, how do thou deaden every virtue; lead to hypocrisy and
vice, and make us what we should be ashamed to own, mean, avaricious, and
unfeeling. -- Would I change the feeling heart for all the interested views
this world affords? Oh, no! give me sensibility to feel another's woe, and I
shall then feel, as I ought, my own happiness.

THE SURPRISE.
IT is vexatious, said Mr. Woollet, as he arose from breakfast, that I cannot
stay here, as I have no ready money to procure a lodging. -- No answer was made.

Cannot I have a room on your second floor, Mrs. Saveall?

Really, Sir, they are all occupied.

I do not know what to do; I must beg you to lend me half a guinea till next
week.

I cannot, upon my word, Sir.

Mr. Woollet summoned up a look of expressive anger and contempt, and fixing
his eyes on his false friend, cried, He who can refuse half a guinea to my
necessities, shall never share my prosperity. -- Know, selfish man, I have
gained my cause, and am, at this moment, master of two thousand pounds per
annum. Then turning from them, hastily left the house.

I stood for a moment to view their confusion; they spoke not a word, but
giving each other the keenest looks of reproach, separated in sullen silence.

At that instant, Heartfree shot across my mind, I quitted the house, and
removing the ring from my finger, walked home.

THE BREAKFAST.
SHE was listening with attention to Heartfree, who was relating the story of
last night. She knew it before, but still it was pleasing, for it was in praise
of the man she loved. -- Harriet had made an acquaintance with my little
petitioner; was displaying her toys, and teaching her to dress her doll.

I have made you wait, my Emma, said I -- Heartfree rose from his seat, bowed,
and cast down his eyes, while his cheeks were dyed with crimson -- it was a
blush neither expressive of guilt nor shame -- it was a blush occasioned only
by the pain a noble heart feels when in a state of despondence. I took no
notice of it, but began a conversation on indifferent subjects -- his confusion
gradually decreased, and in less than half an hour was quite dissipated.

I settled a plan for his future subsistence -- he left me in haste to carry
the joyful tidings to his wife -- he was beyond expression happy, nor was I a
jot behind him in that particular. -- My Harriet could not part with her little
play-fellow. -- She shall live with you, Harriet, said I; -- so she shall,
papa, and ride in my coach, and wear my fine things -- will not you, Lucy?

She looked up at me with a countenance I shall never forget.

And shall I never see mamma, then? and must she still live in that dark room?

I was willing to try her. -- You shall stay here, Lucy, said I, but you must
not see your mamma, nor can I help her living in that little dark room.

She surveyed the apartment she was in, as though making a comparison.

It is a fine place, said she; but if my mamma cannot take a part of these fine
things, I had rather go home again.

Oh! exclaimed Emma, who can say that Heartfree is poor; fate has indeed robbed
him of his wealth, but heaven in return has given him an invaluable treasure in
his children.

THE LESSON.
IT was about two years after, when my Emma, Harriet, Lucy, and myself, were on
a visit to Heartfree. -- His brother had returned from India with a fortune
equal to their most sanguine wishes. -- In rural retirement, about twenty miles
from London, they lived in complete happiness, having been taught the value of
present blessings, by past scenes of sorrow.

It was a night when the contending elements seemed to threaten the earth with
dissolution; the forked lightening rived the sturdy oaks; the bursting and
almost incessant peals of thunder made all nature tremble. The whirlwind raged,
the gleaming meteors showed the distant foaming sea, its proud unsettled waves
that seemed to wage war with the black impending sky. -- It was a night of
horror. It was a night to make a man remember on what a slender thread his life
depends. The vast universe is but an atom that with one blast from the Creative
Power might vanish into air, and leave no trace of planets, earth, or sea, but
all again be universal chaos.

It ceased. The moon broke from behind a jetty cloud, tinged round with silver
-- the wind passed gently over the trees and herbage, whose leaves had caught
the late descending shower, and glittered in the moon beams.

The tempest was dreadful, said I, but it has cleared the air of all noxious
vapors; and how beautiful appears the face of nature, heightened by the
remembrance of the late scene of horror! -- Just so it is with life; none can
enjoy the pleasures of prosperity so well as those who have felt the pangs of
adversity.

Our ears were invaded by a groan; it came from the road; we followed the
sound, and found a man lying on the ground, bleeding, and almost naked. -- We
bore him to the house, his wounds were dressed, and it was judged rest would be
his best restorer.

In the morning he was unable to rise. I proposed to Heartfree to visit him; we
entered the room, put back the curtains, and discovered the features of the
inhuman Creditor. -- We paused. -- He endeavored to turn his face from us, and
waving his hand for us to leave him, cried emphatically, Heartfree! thou art
revenged.

I should like to know, said Heartfree, when his wounded guest was able to
leave his apartment, by what accident you came in that dangerous situation.

I will inform you, he replied: -- About three weeks since, my house was
consumed by fire, and with it all my property -- my wife and children were
saved, but they were saved from the flames to perish by famine.

His heart was full. -- Heartfree passed his hand across his eyes. -- The man
continued, -- Some charitable people made a collection of near fifty pounds,
and advised me to go into the country, and purchase a little place, where my
wife and children might be supported by industry. -- To save expenses I
traveled on foot, and in a late tempest stopped at an ale house till it should
be over. On coming away, two men offered to accompany me; but before I had
proceeded far, they stopped and demanded my money; seeing they had no
firearms, I endeavored to defend myself, but they were too powerful; I
received a wound in my side, and soon grew insensible; the rest you know. -- I
return you many thanks for the unmerited favors I have received; but I must
now go back to my poor family, and either starve in obscurity, or go to the
parish.

You shall do neither, exclaimed Heartfree, looking at his own children as he
spoke.

Heartfree was a husband and a father in the just sense of the words. -- He was
troubled with a short memory, and had entirely forgot that he had ever been
harshly treated by the person before him.

You shall do neither, said he, taking out his pocket book, and endeavoring to
disperse the drops of humanity that started in his eye: here, giving him a
note, here is a trifle; I do not at present want; when you can spare it, repay
me; till then you are welcome.

The man could not take it -- astonishment had rendered him motionless.

Heartfree put it on the table, and calling to a servant to get a horse ready
for his guest to return to town, wished him a pleasant ride, and left the room.

THE ELOPEMENT.
I FEAR this step will greatly distress my poor father, said Melissa to her
woman, as they entered the Park.

They had left the carriage at Spring Gardens, with orders if they did not
return in two hours, to go home.

Mrs. Tiffany was artful; she knew her lady's partiality for Cogdie, and she
painted the matrimonial state, founded on love, in the most glowing colors.

Melissa for a moment forgot her father, but the idea soon returned.

I hope he will not be very wretched, said she.

You will soon return, answered Mrs. Tiffany.

But I marry without consulting him.

And is not your fortune your own, Madam; and in a case of this nature, young
ladies can certainly tell what will contribute to their own happiness, better
than their old fathers can judge for them.

But he will be very angry, Tiffany -- I will not go -- I will return, fall at
his feet, and confess my error -- I am sure he will refuse me nothing that is
really necessary to my happiness.

Dear madam, how can you talk so -- what will poor Mr. Cogdie think? he will
certainly go distracted.

Melissa stopped.

And then your aunt Sarah, she will never let you have Mr. Cogdie, if she can
prevent it.

No matter; I will not go.

Well, Madam, just as you please; Mr. Cogdie will think you meant to make a
fool of him, and will marry Miss Sparkle, who is so fond of him.

Melissa sighed -- and went forward.

A chaise and four was waiting for her at Hyde* Park corner; I had a horse
there ready also. -- By means of my ring I had followed them through the Park
unseen -- I now took it off, and mounting my horse, followed the chaise full
speed, in which were Cogdie, Melissa, and her woman.

GRETNA GREEN.
I HAVE often heard of this place, said I, but I never thought I should be one
that took a trip to it on an hymeneal expedition; -- but I must not lose sight
of Melissa; so putting on my ring, I followed them into the house.

THE INN.
How happy your condescension makes me, said Cogdie, as he seated himself by
Melissa -- but I shall not be entirely devoid of fear till I can call you mine*
and as the parson is not in the way, suppose, my dear girl, you sign this
paper, to certify that you came with me voluntarily, in case I should be called
to an account for running away with an Heiress.

May I not read the paper, said Melissa.

It is of no great consequence, my love, whether you sign it or not, only in
such cases there are sometimes difficulties ensue after the ceremony is over. I
may be tried and cast.

Give me the paper, I will sign it.

I trembled with anxiety. -- She had taken up the pen to sign the conveyance of
her whole fortune into his hands.

I will see him -- exclaimed a voice, not the gentlest in the world -- I have a
warrant to apprehend him.

Cogdie turned pale as ashes. -- The pen dropped from Melissa's hand. --

An officer of justice entered.

Mr. Cogdie, said he, you must go with me. I arrest you for a fraud committed
five years ago.

And who has employed you? who forged this tale to injure me in the opinion of
this lady?

I had taken off my ring, and stepping forward at that moment, cried, it is I,
you villain. Is it not enough that you have ruined an innocent girl who was
under my protection; left her and her helpless infant to shame and want, and by
base and fraudulent methods taken from me near a thousand pounds, but you must
add to the catalogue of your crimes the ruin of this amiable lady, and break
the heart of her worthy father.

Melissa shrieked, and fainted; I caught her as she fell, and bore her in my
arms to another apartment. -- Cogdie departed with the officers of justice,
muttering curses as he went.

O! where am I, cried Melissa, as she opened her eyes, and where is my dear
father? Safe, I hope, replied I; and when you choose, I will order a chaise,
and we will return to him.

When you please, Sir; but I fear he will never see me, never forgive me; I
dare not go to him.

I will make your peace with him, said I. -- Melissa burst into tears, and was
silent.

We cannot depart without some refreshment, thought I; so going into the
kitchen to order something, I met Mrs. Tiffany on the stairs. Woman, said I,
what wages does your lady owe you?

Six months, Sir; but I hope my lady will not part with me in this strange
place.

You had no business to advise her to come to this strange place -- there is
your money, and three guineas to pay your expenses to town, your lady never
desires to see you again. -- Now by the astonishment of her countenance, and a
sort of leer that she gave as she tripped down stairs, I guessed I had paid her
more than was her due.

HONESTY.
THIS woman has certainly got more than she had a right to, said I, standing
with my right hand on the top of the lower balustrade, and holding my purse,
which I had not yet tied up, in my left -- The world talks much about honesty,
but I cannot comprehend where it is to be found. -- The trader will stand
behind his counter, and ask you three shillings per yard for cloth more than it
is worth, and if you are inexperienced, as it frequently happens in such cases,
you pay him without hesitation -- he knows he has imposed upon you, yet he will
lay his hand upon his heart, and declare he is an honest man. -- The Courtier
-- Oh! quoth reflection, pray don't mention a courtier and honesty in the same
breath. -- The women -- how can you talk of their honesty, when you have so
flagrant a proof to the contrary before you. -- The Clergy -- worse and worse;
does not the beneficed clergyman quietly pocket his hundreds, or thousands,
while the poor curate is starving on thirty pounds per annum, and will not the
rector preach you an eloquent sermon on charity, and the curate spend his
breath in recommending abstinence. -- Is this honesty?

It may be called so, said I.

The lawyer and physician -- Oh, there is no honesty there, I assure you; the
one steals your fortune, and the other your life -- but this is all in the way
of business.

Then, pray where may we find this said honesty?

It was a sort of question I knew not how to answer -- at that instant faithful
Caesar came and licked my hand. -- You are right, said I, patting his head. If
any thing like honesty or fidelity is to be found in the world, it is in your
species.

Shall we go, Sir, said Melissa, as she came down stairs.

With all my heart, said I, putting up my purse, and offering her my hand. --
The chaise was at the door, and I was actually stepping into it, without once
recollecting that I had not spent a single halfpenny for the good of the house.

THE RECITAL.
IT is all like a dream, said Melissa, as the chaise drove off; a sort of
confused, disagreeable dream, from which I shall be glad to awake -- but pray,
Sir, if it be not troublesome, will you tell me the meaning of some words which
you dropped concerning Cogdie? what woman has he ruined, and whom has he
defrauded?

I will tell you, Madam, said I -- she was all attention.

Five years since, a friend of mine died, and left a lovely orphan daughter to
my care. -- Olivia was young and inexperienced in the ways of the world. -- I
was gay and fond of company -- the house of a young gentleman of fortune is not
a fit sanctuary for innocence and beauty. I loved Olivia like a sister -- I
would have revenged an insult offered her at the expense of my life, but she
required the tender solicitude of a mother, the sedate mature advice of a
father. -- Her heart was the seat of sensibility, she was formed for domestic
love and felicity -- having no paternal ties, no filial affection to warm her
gentle breast -- there was an aching void in her heart, which only love could
fill. -- Cogdie visited at my house -- he was much older than Olivia, she was
only sixteen. -- He was attentive to her childish pleasures; her favorite dog
was caressed -- he would feed her goldfinch, talk to her parrot, and bring her
nosegays. -- I was not of a suspicious temper, but placed an implicit
confidence in Cogdie, who, by a thousand arts, had ingratiated himself into my
favor. It was not long before I observed Olivia grew pale and thin; she had
lost her cheerfulness, and I frequently found her in tears. Imagining she might
be solitary for want of a female companion, I proposed her going into the
country to an old lady, a friend of mine, who had a daughter but three years
older than herself -- she consented, and two days after was appointed for her
departure. When the appointed morning came* she was not to be found. I sent to
all her acquaintance in vain. -- I cannot describe my distress -- I told my
affliction to Cogdie; he consoled me, and flattered me with hopes I might yet
find her -- I was happy to think I had such a friend. Three weeks passed on,
and I never heard of my Olivia. -- Cogdie had frequently mentioned his being
sometimes employed by a capital merchant at Hamburgh, with whom I was
acquainted when abroad -- He came to me one morning, and showed a letter, in
which he was desired to send the merchant a ring, the most valuable that could
be procured. -- I wonder, said Cogdie, why he has not sent me the money to
purchase this ring; he knows my circumstances are not the most affluent. He
seemed distressed at not being able to get so valuable a ring on credit. -- I
sent him to my jeweller; the ring was ordered, and it came to near eight
hundred and fifty pounds -- he took it away in haste one morning, as he said,
to send it to Hamburgh; and I never saw him again, till a few days since, when
I was informed he was one of the most noted gamblers about town. I had given up
all thoughts of ever finding Olivia, when going out one evening --

THE TRAVELLER.
THE roads are very heavy indeed, said I, breaking the thread of my story, and
fixing my eyes on an old man, who was traveling through the dirt -- There had
just fallen a heavy shower of rain, and the sun was now shining with scorching
rays upon his head; he was dressed in a gray coat, and a bundle hung to the end
of a stick that was across his shoulder. -- My heart is always interested by
the present object. -- This man, said I, is no more able to walk than I am; and
four horses can certainly drag three people -- I bade the postilion stop. --
And what are you about to do? said Prudence -- Offer that poor man a seat in
the chaise, said Benevolence -- ah! but you know nothing of him; he may be a
thief, cried Suspicion -- or a very poor mechanic, and by no means fit to ride
in a chaise with a gentleman, urged Pride -- but he is a fellow creature, and
seems very weary, said Humanity. -- I staid not another moment for
consideration.

And have you never heard of Olivia since? said Melissa, when we were settled
in our seats. -- I know not how it was, but I could not proceed with my story
-- there was something in the appearance of the old man, that awakened my
curiosity -- he was a figure not striking; but examine it minutely, and you
would find it interesting. A few gray hairs were scattered over his forehead;
his face seemed to have some traces of sorrow and disappointment; his features
were grave, but withal tempered with such meek resignation and composure, that
I contemplated them till I had forgot Olivia, Melissa, and almost myself.

THE CONJECTURE.
THERE is such a natural curiosity implanted in the mind of man, that we cannot
be half an hour in company with a stranger, before in our own imagination we
form many conjectures concerning his situation in life -- what sort of a
disposition he has -- whether he is married or single -- and fifty such
particulars, which are of no real consequence to us. -- I had not been seated
with this old man above ten minutes, when I had settled in my own mind that he
was a parson, that he had lost his wife, and that he was going to town in order
to look out for some employment to settle his children in. -- Thou have lost
thy partner, thought I, looking at him with compassion, she who has heightened
the pleasure of thy youth, shared with thee the sweets and bitters of life, and
was thy companion in old age. -- The bower that she planted so many years
since; the woodbines that she trimmed and guided with her hands, now shoot wild
and neglected, and that bower which to thee was once a paradise, is now
desolate and gloomy, deprived of her presence. -- What a saucy baggage is this
Madam Fancy, said I, recollecting myself; she has given me a pain at my heart
by telling me a tale which, perhaps, has no foundation. --

Do not complain of Fancy, said my fellow-traveller, for how many a heavy hour
she often helps to dissipate, when she soars upon the pinions of hope, and
builds fine airy fabrics, extricates us out of difficulties, and leads us to
the summit of our wishes; and we are for the moment as happy as though in the
real possession of them; and what though she sometimes does forsake us, and all
the prospects vanish into air, yet soon she returns again, and again is
welcomed -- we listen to her siren tale with pleasure, and so wear life away.
How often in ^ancy have I rushed into battle, and with this arm sent hundreds
to eternity -- how often has fancy led me to my sovereign's feet, to receive
the reward of my past services.

You are a soldier, then, said I, -- every feature was animated with the
remembrance of former campaigns, as he replied in the affirmative.

Then by my soul, said I, Madam Fancy is an arrant cheat, for she had
represented you as a parson.

THE SOLDIER.
I HAVE spent the best part of my life said the old man, in the service of my
country. -- At (...) of age I retired, with no other fortune than a
Lieutenant's half-pay -- it was but scanty, it was but sufficient for the wants
of Narcissa, my wife, and self. -- I would tell you that my child was lovely,
Sir, but I am old, and a father; both those particulars would lead you to doubt
my veracity. Our mansion was small, but it was the mansion of content. Last
summer an old lady came to lodge in our neighborhood; she took great notice of
Narcissa during her residence in the country, and at her departure, requested
me* to let my child come the ensuing spring to pass a few weeks in town; with
reluctance I consented, for I thought the fair blossom of innocence would be
subject to contamination if I entrusted her in the metropolis without a proper
protector.

You was right, said I -- at that instant recollecting poor Olivia, and fearing
I might again lose the thread of my story, I instantly gratified Melissa's
curiosity, by relating the remainder.

THE RECITAL CONTINUED.
GOING out one evening, I heard a voice which I thought I knew, imploring
charity. I sent my servant to bring her to me; she came weeping and sobbing
aloud. -- She just entered the door, and sunk insensible at my feet. -- It was
poor Olivia -- I raised her, I pressed her in my arms, and by the tenderest
caresses called her back to life. When she found herself in my arms, she could
hardly trust her senses, but sliding from my embrace upon her knees, took both
my hands in hers, and cried will you forgive me. -- I assured her she was
pardoned; soothed her, and begged to know why she had left my protection -- she
unfolded a tale of horror -- Cogdie had ruined her. She found herself pregnant,
and pressed him to marry her; he said I would not consent to their union, and
when out of tenderness I wished to remove her into the country, she thought it
was only to take her from him. -- Conscious of her own unhappy situation, she
flew to her betrayer -- he for a while behaved with a tolerable degree of
tenderness; but he soon threw off the disguise, and turned her out of doors, at
the same time informing her that I had taken an oath never to see or assist her.

Heavens! what barbarity, exclaimed Melissa. -- Melissa pitied Olivia, but she
felt for herself -- it might have been her situation. -- She desired me to
proceed.

I took the fair mourner, said I, into the country, where, in about six weeks,
she was delivered of a boy. -- I told her unfortunate tale to Mrs. Sidley and
her daughter; they pitied her, they determined she should not be lost. I
visited Olivia in her retreat; my visits were long and frequent; when I was
absent from Sidley Cot, I was pensive and unhappy; my former pleasures lost the
power of amusing -- in short, I at last discovered that the lovely Emma Sidley
had taken possession of my heart; I sought her hand -- I gained it, and brought
my charming prize triumphant up to town.

Olivia has spent these last five years in superintending the care of her boy;
she passes for a widow, and her charms have gained her many admirers, but she
declines them all; and declares she looks upon herself as the wife of Cogdie.
Chance discovered to me his vile design on you. Pardon me, dear lady, if I
thought the method I have made use of, the only one that I could impress your
mind with terror, at the precipice you have escaped, and guard you in future
against forming clandestine connections with our sex.

THE OMISSION.
AND what have you done with the old lieutenant? said my Emma, when I had given
her an account of our journey.

I set him down somewhere in the Strand, said I.

I hope you found some opportunity to increase his little store, without
hurting his feelings, said she.

I was ashamed to own my omission; and yet where is the shame? said I, as I sat
with my hand upon my Emma's knee, reading the sweet lines written by
benevolence on her lovely countenance. -- Where is the shame that I was guilty
of an omission through forgetfulness? it was not a wilful sin against charity
-- I will go seek him, said I, and repair my fault.

You will first go to my father, I hope, said Melissa.

I took my hat, and stood full two minutes undetermined which to do first --
they were both actions of benevolence.

Had it been thy case, bright pattern of humanity, said I, opening a volume of
Stern, that lay on the table before me, just at the corporal's relating the
story of Le Fevre to Captain Shandy -- had it been thy case, thou would have
given the preference to the old soldier; but I am a father, and will act as my
feelings direct.

THE RECONCILIATION.
IT is of no purpose, said I to the servant, to deny your master; I am sure he
is at home, and I will see him -- pray tell him I have particular business with
him. -- I had left Melissa at my house -- after waiting half an hour, I was
admitted up stairs -- Melissa's father was sitting in a pensive posture, his
looks dejected, and his dress disordered. -- On the other side of the room sat
a woman, the picture of envy and ill nature.

You will pardon me, Sir, for this intrusion -- I came from --

My daughter, eagerly exclaimed the old gentleman -- and where is she, Sir? --
will she come home again? Oh, lead me to her, that I may lock her in my arms,
and with tears of joy wash away the remembrance of her error.

I suppose Miss is married, cried Mrs. Sarah. -- She did not make such an
excursion, and with such company, for nothing.

Really, Madam, said I, she is not married; she has taken a little excursion,
it is true, but she is now at my house, impatiently waiting for a summons to
throw herself at her father's feet, and implore his forgiveness. -- The old
gentleman called for his hat.

Why surely you will not forgive her, brother* said the churlish aunt.

Not forgive her! exclaimed the father -- I tell you, sister, she shall be
forgiven, taken again to my bosom, again share my confidence; nor be driven by
my unkindness, and the cold contempt of her own sex, to that vice which I know
her soul would shrink from as from death.

Mrs. Sarah muttered something about virtue and propriety, and left the room.

There were three reasons why Mrs. Sarah was so inveterate against her niece;
the first was, she was old, very sallow, rather inclined to be crooked, and had
a voice something resembling the cawing of a rook; it was therefore a great
mortification to have a niece so young and lovely.

In the second place, she had formed some design on Cogdie's heart herself --
no woman can bear a rival in love or dress.

The third, and most potent reason was, she had never been a parent, therefore
could not tell the pangs, the yearnings, the fond solicitudes that by turns
agitated the heart of Melissa's father.

Come, let us go, my friend, said he, let us go and bring the dear fugitive
home.

As we were going, I gave him an account of our expedition.

I cannot bear to see him, exclaimed Melissa, hiding her face as we entered --
He would not suffer her to kneel, but embracing her cordially, cried, Come
home, my child, come home, and let us forget all that is past* I never will
reproach you.

He was right in making this promise, for nothing is so liable to drive a woman
to a second error, as her being subject to continual reproach for the first.

I wonder, thought I, as they departed, if there is a greater blessing on this
side eternity, than the power of conferring benefits. -- The man who has it in
his power to make others happy, has a large share of happiness allotted to
himself. -- I would not part with my ring, said I, for half the universe;
without it, I had been unable to deliver this charming girl from the hands of
her betrayer.

THE PRINTING OFFICE.
AND can that young creature be an author? said I -- she was standing at the
door of the printing office, waiting for admission. -- I had rambled out that
morning in search of adventures -- my ring was on, I entered the office with
the young author.

I have brought you my manuscript, Mr. C -- ke, said she; the story is founded
on fact, and, I hope, will be so lucky as to please those who shall hereafter
peruse it.

Is it original, Miss?

Entirely so.

Lord bless me! that was quite unnecessary.

Why, Sir, how could I think of offering to the public a story which has
appeared in print before?

Nothing more common, I assure you.

He was a thin, pale looking man, dressed in a shabby green coat -- he never
looked in her face the whole time he was speaking; but standing half sideways
toward her, fixed his eyes askance upon the ground. -- I never like a man that
is ashamed to look me in the face, it argues a consciousness of not having
always acted with integrity.

Nothing can be more common, Miss, continued he, than for an author to get a
quantity of old magazines, the older the better, and having picked and called
those stories the most adapted for his purpose, he places them in a little
regular order, writes a line here and there, and so offers them to the public
as an entire new work.

See here, now, I have published this work on my own account; these few first
pages are original, but I assure you the scissars did the rest. I have entitled
it The Moralist, and sell these two volumes at seven shillings and sixpence.

I should rather call that compiling, said the young author.

Why so it is, in fact -- but I assure you there are few people who have genius
sufficient to write a book, or, even if they had, would take the trouble to do
it. -- A fentimental novel will hardly pay you for time and paper. -- A story
full of intrigue, wrote with levity, and tending to convey loose ideas, would
sell very well.

It is a subject unfit for a female pen, said the young lady.

Why you need not put your name to it.

It is a subject unfit for any pen, retorted she, a deep vermilion dying her
cheeks, and fire flashing from her eyes -- she stopped, and checked her rising
passion -- I think, Sir, she continued, with more composure, the person who
would write a book that might tend to corrupt the morals of youth, and fill
their docile minds with ideas pernicious and destructive to their happiness,
deserves a greater punishment than the robber who steals your purse, or the
murderer that takes your life.

Mr. C -- ke stared -- it was a vacant stare -- he wondered, no doubt, how an
author could study any thing but her own emolument -- I was pleased with her
sentiments -- if your writings are equal to what you have just uttered, said I,
they will be worth perusing; but some can talk better than they write; perhaps
it is her case. Her works never fell in my way, so I cannot judge. --

You mean to publish by subscription, said Mr. C -- Ke -- She replied in the
affirmative --

And how do you mean to get subscribers?

-- By showing my propofals, and simply requesting them to encourage my
undertaking.

Oh! God bless me, he replied, still looking askance, for he never changed his
position, or raised his eyes from the ground, except it was to look at his
elbow, and contemplate his threadbare sleeve -- It will never do to go that
way to work -- you must have a tale of distress to tell, or you will never
procure one subscriber --

I am not very much distressed, said she; and if I was, why should I blazon it
to the world?

It is no matter whether you are really distressed or not, said C -- ke; but
you must tell a tale to excite pity, or you will never gain a single shilling
toward printing your books -- I have sold eight hundred copies of the Moralist
by these means -- nobody gives themselves the trouble to enquire whether my
story be false or true; it excites pity for the moment -- they send me a
subscription -- my purpose is answered, and it is a question whether they ever
think of me or my story again --

She seemed tired of the conversation -- so laying down her manuscript, and
desiring him to put it in hand immediately, she bade him good morning --

What impositions there are in the world! said I, as I went out of the office:
This very account will make me always refuse to subscribe to a book that is
recommended by a tale of distress.

THE FUNERAL.
Two coaches with white plumes; in the first was the coffin of an infant, at
the door of an elegant house stood several domestics weeping -- A young woman
who had stood at a distance, watched the coaches till they were out of sight,
and then burst into tears --

I removed my ring from my finger, and inquired the cause of her grief.

He is gone, Sir, said she, pointing to the road the coaches had taken; he is
gone, and I shall never see him again; he was the sweetest child -- I once
lived with him, I loved him with unspeakable tenderness, listened with pleasure
to his prattle, and when he was ill, attended him with anxious, unremitting
care; he was the delight of his parents, he was the joy of my heart.

You do wrong to lament, said, I; he is gone to a more happy place; he is taken
away before he had offended his Maker, to share in pleasures unspeakable and
unceasing; then why should you make yourself wretched? It is like regretting
that he was not suffered to remain in a world subject to all sorts of
disappointments and misfortunes; he is now an angel in the mansions of the
blessed; why should you then mourn his absence from you?

Have you children, Sir? said she, with unaffected simplicity -- The question
struck me forcibly. I thus asked my own heart -- had Harriet been taken from
me; could I have reasoned thus calmly; the very supposition gave me an
unspeakable pang; it told me that reason had little power over the heart torn
by the loss of what it prized more than life. -- I turned to the young woman --
she was gone a few paces from me -- she sighed, profoundly pronounced the name
of Henry, wiped off her tears, raised her swollen eyes to Heaven, and cried --
Thy will be done.

I was ashamed of my former reasoning; that one sentence convinced me, that
Christianity was a better comforter in affliction than the most boasted rules
of philosophy.

THE HAPPY PAIR.
IT was a neat little house, by the side of the fields -- a pretty looking
woman, dressed by simplicity, Nature's handmaid, was laying the table cloth, and
trimming up her little parlour; her looks were cheerful and serene, and with a
voice pleasing, though wild and untutored, she sung the following little
stanzas:

Here, beneath my humble cot,
Tranquil peace and pleasure dwell;
If contented with our lot,
Smiling joy can grace a cell.
Nature's wants are all supplied;
Food and raiment, house and fire:
Let others swell the courts of pride,
This is all that I require.
Just as she had finished, a genteel young man entered the gate; she ran
eagerly to meet him. --

My dear Charles, she cried, you are late tonight.

It was near ten o'clock -- I had taken the advantage of my ring, and followed
them into the house. --

I am weary, Betsey, said he, leaning his head upon her shoulder.

-- I am sorry for it, my love; but come, eat your supper, and you shall then
repose on my bosom, and hush all your cares to rest --

Their frugal meal was sallad and bread and butter.

If to be content is to be happy, my dear, said she, how superlatively happy am
I -- I have no wish beyond what our little income will afford me; my home is to
me a palace, thy love my estate. I envy not the rich dames who shine in costly
array; I please my Charles in my plain, simple attire; I wish to please no
other. --

Thou dear reward of all my toils! cried Charles, embracing her, how can I have
a wish ungratified, while possessed of thee -- I never desired wealth, but for
thy sake, and thy cheerful, contented disposition makes even wealth unnecessary.

It is by no means necessary to happiness, said I, as I left the house --
Charles and Betsey seem perfectly happy and content with only a bare competence
-- I ask but a competence, cries the luxurious or avaricious wretch; the very
exclamation convinces us, that a trifle is adequate to the wants of the humble,
frugal mind, while thousands cannot supply the inordinate desires of the
prodigal, or satisfy the grasping disposition of the miser.

THE DRUNKARD.
IT was a confused noise of singing, fwearing, and a crash of breaking glasses.
-- Perhaps, said I, this is a private mad house; for surely I am not near
Bedlam. The moon shone bright, I cast my eyes up toward the house, and
perceived the sign of the Angel -- Good Heavens! thought I, this is a public
house; and how ridiculous to place an angel at the door of the habitation of
drunkenness and debauchery.

Of all the crimes to which human nature is addicted, drunkenness is the most
pernicious; it is the master key that leads to all other vice. -- Behold that
young man; he is an apprentice -- in a fit of intoxication he commenced an
acquaintance with a lewd woman; he has not money to answer her extravagancies
-- he robs his master -- he is detected -- his distracted parents pay the sum
he has taken -- they exhort him with streaming eyes, to avoid such excesses in
future -- He leaves them with a promise of amendment -- Returning to his
master's house, he again is entrapped in his darling vice, and again returns to
his abandoned companion -- behold him now just entering her mansion -- he has
taken a considerable sum from his master's till -- the officers of justice are
close behind -- he entreats her to secret him -- she refuses -- she delivers
him up; denies her acquaintance with him -- he is dragged to prison. -- See him
now, loaded with irons, in a dismal dungeon; he has received the sentence of
death -- His parents enter; they are speechless with sorrow -- he remembers
their former kindness -- he sees their present anguish; his folly, his guilt
appear in their proper colors -- he would comfort them, but is unable -- the
messenger of death calls -- another moment, he asks but one moment, and that is
denied -- his mother --

But stop; the scene grows too deep; I must draw a veil before it.

THE BUCKS.
AND these men call themselves rational beings -- they had interrupted my
meditations by breaking the lamps and beating the watchmen who had endeavored
to prevent them. Among them was a young man of quality -- Oh, shame, said I,
that those whose exalted station makes their actions conspicuous in the eyes of
the world, should set examples so very detrimental to society.

D -- n me, says he, let us go and get drunk, and then roar catches through the
street, and disturb the sober, sleeping drones, in spite of all the watchmen
and constables in the kingdom -- Come along, my boys; and if we do go to the
round-house, let us go jovially.

How very humiliating it is to human nature to see mankind so far degrade
themselves, and commit such follies as render them scarcely a degree superior
to the brute creation -- nay, I do not know but the poor ass, who carries the
loaded panier, or the ox who drags the plough, are more useful to society than
such a man: these poor animals render their owners all the service in their
power, in return for their food, while the buck spends his nights in riot and
debauchery; his days in sleep; and, in return for the vast blessings showered
around him, instead of making himself serviceable to the community of which he
is a member, he breaks the laws, disturbs the peace, squanders his substance on
the infamous and profligate, and dies without having performed one action that
might make his loss regretted.

You thoughtless, dissipated rakes, that haunt this town, behold this
comparison, and if you are men, blush at your own inferiority.

THE MIDNIGHT HOUR.
THE clock struck twelve. --

This is the hour, said I, when Morpheus, with his drowsing poppies, has sealed
the eyes of the innocent and happy -- but Morpheus is a courtier; he never
visits the couch of affliction, or listens to the request of the unhappy. --
Now the lover, true to the appointed hour, to elude the guardian's watchful
eye, steals softly to the window of his fair enslaver, who anxiously had
counted the lazy, lagging minutes, and listened to the passing breeze that
moved the flowers or whispered through the wood; caught at each sound, and
thought it was her love. Now the fair mourner seeks her widowed bed, and hangs
over her sleeping infant, till busy fancy recalls to her mind the father's
features -- the tear of regret which trickles from her eye, falls on the
infant's cheek -- He wakes, he smiles, and charms away her sorrows. -- So, from
the lowering sky, when the soft shower gently descends on the half blown rose,
its fragrance is increased, its leaves expanded, and all its beauties are
revealed to view.

At this lonely hour the ruffian takes his knife, and rushes on the unguarded
victim of his barbarity.

Thou foolish wretch, think not the sable curtain of the night can hide thy
actions from the eye of justice.

This is the hour when the guilty mortal, though in a lofty room, stretched on
a bed of down, and covered by a gilded canopy, though, perhaps, on India's
distant shore he perpetrated the horrid deed; imbrued his hands in innocent
blood to grasp a glittering toy, starts frantic from his pillow -- he sees the
murdered Indian, his gaping wounds, his mangled carcass; he hears his wife and
children calling aloud for vengeance on the murderer; the cold sweat bedews his
limbs, his joints tremble, his faculties are lost, he groans, and in his
thoughts, curses the day when he was first taught the use of gold or the
advantages of power.

This is the hour --

In which, cries reflection, your Emma is wondering why you tarry so long from
her; and, anxious for your safety, paints to her sickening imagination a
thousand dangers which exist not but in her ideas.

-- I quickened my pace

-- She met me at the door

-- I caught her in my arms

A tear had fallen upon her cheek, another stood glittering in her eye -- the
first was a tear of suspense, the last of joy. I kissed them both away, and was
angry with myself for having given her gentle bosom a moment's pain.

THE LOUNGER.
HEIGHO! cried he, stretching and yawning; how shall I pass this day?

It was nine o'clock; he was just up, and had repaired to the coffee house for
his breakfast. He took the news paper, read two or three advertisements; but
soon threw it aside, and seemed wholly occupied in picking his nails and
whistling. I will follow you through this day, said I, and immediately put on
my ring. He left the coffee-house, and sauntered an hour in the Park, then
strolled from one acquaintance's house to another, till he received an
invitation to dinner -- That universal topic, the weather, being discussed, and
the play for the night mentioned, he had not another word to say, but sat
stupidly silent, unless, indeed, he ventured to say yes or no to any question
asked by the lady of the house.

He once complained of the heaviness of time -- she recommended drawing -- that
required too much study -- reading -- he could not bear a book, it stupefied
him -- music -- he should never have patience to learn he liked nothing but the
flute, and that would throw him into a consumption --

I am surprised, said the lady, you like none of these; give me leave to
recommend you a few books that I am sure will help to wear away the time --
Bridon's Tour you will find instructive and amusing -- Goldsmith's Animated
Nature is the same -- Stern is a pleasing author; and there is a vast fund of
amusement in --

You have mentioned books enough already, said he (interrupting her) to last me
my life. I never read any thing except it be a ballad, or the last dying speech
of people that were hanged.

Very entertaining and instructive subjects, cried the lady.

He dined, and then sauntered to a public house, drank a pint of rum and water,
went to the play when it was half over, and came away again without
understanding a single sentence he had heard -- went again to the public house,
squandered away two or three shillings more in drinking, only because he had
nothing else to do, and went to bed as he arose, with a mind entirely vacant,
unoccupied by thought or reflection -- This is the life of a lounger, said I --
If the lives of mortals are recorded in the book of fate, what a blank will
this man's life appear! -- Yet I am certain he goes to bed every jot as weary
as the poor labourer who toils for his daily bread -- Is it the fault of
education or disposition? said I.

Reason answered, it must be native indolence, or he would otherwise engage in
some pleasing study, that might at once employ and amuse him --

It is a matter of doubt with me, whether such a man deserves most our pity or
contempt.

A TALE OF SCANDAL.
AND so you are writing -- and do you intend to publish your works?

Perhaps I may, said I --

What is your subject, pray?

Rambles, excursions, characters, and tales.

And do you think the world will attend to your rambles, excursions,
characters, and tales?

I will write sentimental rambles, juvenile excursions, original characters,
and tales of scandal, and then my books will be universally read.

The last article may make them rise into some repute, said he.

Do thou know the origin of scandal? said I.

No --

Then I will tell thee --

She is of spurious birth; begot of envy on that blear-eyed monster, Mistrust;
she was nursed by Self-love, and tutored by Hypocrisy -- She is hideously
deformed, has a thousand ears, and lists to every tale -- Her eyes magnify the
smallest objects into mountains; and as her tongue has not the power to vent
her malicious tales so fast as her vile heart conceives them, she makes up the
rest in nods, winks, shrugs of the shoulders, lifting the eyes, and shaking the
head -- She in general wears a mask, and dresses in a pleasing garb, which
makes her so well received in all companies.

Why this is a tale of scandal indeed, said he.

And the only one I shall ever write, said I -- for if in this vast globe full
of interesting scenes to excite our wonder, and engage our attention, if, I
say, in such a place, a man cannot use his pen without stabbing the character
of his neighbor, he must have had a very narrow education, be possessed of a
bad heart, and blessed with little or no understanding.

THE VILLAGE WEDDING.
I NEVER see the simple inhabitants of a village engaged in a scene of mirth,
but I long to mingle with them -- I wish to see, feel, and taste, every thing
with the same sensations they do.

They were seated round a large table, under the shade of some spreading oaks
-- I will partake of their diversions, said I, without disturbing them; so I
put on my ring, and mixed among the groupe.

A nut-brown maid, dressed in pure white, the emblem of her own innocence,
presided at the head of the board -- I looked at her with scrutinizing eye, and
perceived it was my pretty milk-maid -- She had that day given her hand to
Colin, and the cheerful company had assembled to keep the wedding.

Their repast finished, a lad with a pipe and tabor, and another with a fiddle,
struck up a lively air, when Colin and his Rose led off the dance, with step so
light, a countenance so serene, and an air so blythe, that I wished myself an
humble villager, and my Emma a nut-brown maid.

And why cannot all the world live thus? What need of titles, equipage, state,
pomp, and nonsense? Nature never designed it so.

Nor did nature design us to wear clothes --

The idea was ludicrous -- it irritated my risible muscles -- what awkward
beings would these tight country damsels appear, if they were dancing about in
a state of nature! A petticoat is a pretty ornament, said I -- and so is an
apron -- The dancers had tucked their aprons up one side -- it gave them a look
of ease and negligence.

It is a strange, said I, that among all the caprices of fashion, the apron has
never been totally abolished, but has continued to be worn by all ranks and
degrees of women, from our grandmother Eve, down to these dancing damsels.

It had never struck me before that the apron was an ornament of such antiquity.

They danced till silver Cynthia lighted up the horizon, and then all with one
consent sat down to supper.

That past, the jocund tale, the song, the laugh, went round, and all was gay
festivity and mirth.

In the course of the evening, Colin had twined a branch of myrtle with
woodbine, and placed it on his Rose's bosom -- He could not have judged better;
the woodbine was an emblem of her sweetness, the myrtle of her love and
constancy.

Farewell, blessed pair! may your portion of life be pure, and unmixed with gall;
may your happiness be as permanent as your innocence and truth are conspicuous.

THE RESCUE.
I HAD been at the play.

A young creature, in the box adjoining that I sat in, had attracted my notice
the whole evening; her fixed attention during the performance, showed she was
almost a stranger to those kind of diversions.

The various passions that agitated her features at the interesting parts of
the drama, seemed the workings of pure nature -- I did not like her companions;
they were by no means suitable guardians for her youth and charms.

The one was a young man of fortune, a professed libertine.

The other an old, fat woman, whose looks and gestures bespoke her employment.

I thought I could read in the open countenance of the young lady, an
unconsciousness of guilt, and a full confidence in the company and protection
of her companions -- I was determined to be convinced whether my conjectures
were well founded.

When they left the playhouse, I put on my ring, and followed them; they were
set down at the door of an elegant house; the rooms within were superb, the
furniture grand, and the servants numerous -- Super was served up -- they urged
the young lady to drink several glasses of wine --

She complied with reluctance.

I will go and order the coach, said the old woman, and left the room.

The libertine took the opportunity, which was intentionally given, and had
nearly executed his horrid purpose, when taking off my ring, and snatching up a
knife that lay on the table -- Villain, said I, forbear your attempts, or this
instant puts a period to your life -- Heaven is too watchful over the virtuous,
to suffer it to fall a prey to such lust and barbarity.

If I was clever at designing, I would give you a sketch of this scene.

The libertine, at the sound of my voice, I relinquished his prey, and fixing
his eyes on me in file at astonishment, while every feature expressed terror
and dismay.

Half starting from his seat, he exclaimed, in a voice scarcely articulate,

Who are you?

The poor girl sat leaning her head against the elbow of the sopha, pale and
ready to sink -- like a timid heart, who for a moment having outstretched the
speed of the fleet hounds, trembling looks around, and stops and pants for
breath -- again her pursuers appear in sight -- again she would fly, but fear
deprives her of the power; tears of anguish chase each other down her cheeks,
and she sits in an agony of despair, awaiting the approaching ruin which she is
unable to escape.

I took her by the hand, bid her fear nothing, and led her triumphant from the
house of infamy.

THE ACTRESS.
I WILL take a peep behind the scenes, said I, one evening, as I passed the
Hay-market Theater; so, putting on my ring, I entered.

You surprise me, Madam -- not come into the house about his business the
nights that you perform? (said a man, addressing himself to Miss --) pray, in
what has he molested you?

He met me on the stairs, Sir, and it is very distressing to be jostled by such
low creatures. I will have the house cleared of such people.

It is a very extraordinary demand, Madam -- he is full as necessary in his
station as you are in yours -- I fancy, the heroine of a comedy would make but
a poor appearance with her hair uncurled and unpowdered; nor would you much
admire an hero with a beard of ten or twelve days growth.

I don't understand this insolence, replied she; it is what I am not used to.

Pray, what is all this fuss about? cried a lame gentleman --

Nothing in the world, Sir, but Miss -- and the barber.

It is very ridiculous, said I, talking of the circumstance a few days after,
that a woman, whose bread depends upon the smiles of the public, and who, every
night that she performs, exerts her talents to please tailors, hair-dressers,
tinners, nay, even chimney-sweepers, when they can raise a shilling to purchase
a seat among the Gods. It is the height of folly for such a woman to complain
of her feelings being hurt by meeting a barber on her dressing room stairs.

Call it by its right name, said a person that stood by me, it is pride.

Pride was not made for man, nor woman neither, I Will be sworn; it spoils the
finest set of features in the world, and is more pernicious to a pretty face
than paint to a lovely complexion; -- it sits but aukwardly on a duchess --
and the Queen never uses it.

What Queen? said he --

Why the British Queen, to be sure, said I --

But then you make no distinction, said he, between the conscious dignity of a
queen, and the pert supercilious airs of a favorite actress: if the world were
guided by the bright example set from the British throne, pride would be
entirely abolished.

That would be a heavenly thing, said I; for the annihilation of pride is like
the dissolution of the body, it unfetters the soul, and leaves it free and
unconfined to soar above the stars.

I have frequently been engaged in disputes concerning women of this profession
-- it puts me beyond all patience to hear people advance an opinion so very
contracted and illiberal, as that of supposing no woman can be virtuous who is
on the stage -- I know many at this time who are ornaments not only to their
profession, but to the sex in general: even the lady I have just mentioned, is
generous, humane and prudent, pride is her only fault -- Charming woman! I have
often said, when I was enchanted with her performance of some amiable character
-- conquer but that one foible, and our admiration will rise into veneration.
-- I am confident a woman may, if she is so inclined, be as virtuous as Lucrece
behind the scenes of a theater. Virtue begets respect wherever she appears; on
the contrary, a woman of loose inclination, though she is immured in a convent,
will find opportunities of doing evil. -- It is a great pity so many women
belonging to the stage are thus inclined; but why should we, on account of
those that are bad, condemn a Siddons, Brunton, Kemble, or Pope? -- Why should
a woman, if she is a good wife, daughter, or mother, be less respected because
she has genius to contribute to our amusement, by bringing before our eyes
heroines we have so often read of, and exhibiting characters we so greatly
admire? -- for my part, I never judge of a person from their profession or
situation in life; it is from their actions I form an idea of their
disposition; and as I think genius and merit deserve as much esteem when we
meet with them in an humble mansion as when they inherit palaces, so are virtue
and prudence as valuable an acquisition in an actress, as in the daughter of a
peer, and alike to be esteemed and respected.

THE RENCOUNTER.
IT is astonishing to me, how people can complain for want of amusement. I am
never a moment without something to amuse, instruct, or interest me -- I never
walk abroad, but I am attentive to every little incident that happens: a
solitary, slow pace, the folded arms, or down-cast eye, will excite my
compassion, and a joyous serene aspect will exhilirate my spirits -- even in a
wilderness, where never human step marked the green turf, or swept the dew
drops from the waving grass, even there I would find company, conversation, and
amusement.

To a thinking mind, the book of nature is ever open for our perusal; and a
soul warmed by sensibility and gratitude, reads the divine pages with pleasure,
and contemplates the great source of all with wonder, reverence, and love.

As I wandered along, encouraging these pleasing reflections, I saw an old man
buying some stale bread and meat at the window of a mean eatinghouse; he stood
with his back toward me; his coat was dirty and torn; his whole appearance was
expressive of the most object poverty. -- Friend, said I, going up to him,
perhaps this trifle may procure you a better meal, putting half a guinea into
his hand.

It always gives my heart a pang, when I see age and distress combined -- age,
of itself, always brings anguish enough. -- How very insupportable, then, must
it be, when there are no comforts, no little indulgencies, to compensate for
the those days of unavoidable pain.

As I presented my little donation, I looked in the old man's face -- I thought
I had seen the features, but could not recollect where.

Humanity is not entirely banished from the world, said he, turning part from
me to conceal his emotion.

I immediately knew his voice -- it was the old lieutenant. -- Good God! said
I, stopping him as he was going from me, what has reduced you to this
distressed situation?

Misfortune, said he.

And did not you know where I lived?

I was ashamed to beg, said he -- a sudden glow passing over his languid
features -- and I thought, Sir, you would be ashamed to own an acquaintance
with poverty.

You shall go home with me, said I, calling an hackney-coach -- let those take
shame to themselves who deny a part of their wealth to merit in distress. I am
proud to acknowledge myself the friend of a man of worth, though he should be
in the lowest situation. And why, said I, as we drove toward home, why should
a man be ashamed of his misfortunes? why should poverty call a blush upon the
cheek of merit, we did not mark out our own fortunes.

But then the world, the world, Sir, will always scoff and spurn the man
humbled by the griping hand of penury: nor is there an object that in general
meets with more contempt from the rich and powerful, than those who have seen
better days, but are reduced by unavoidable misfortunes to a dependence on
their smiles.

Strange infatuation! to set themselves, in the pride of their hearts, above
their fellow creatures; and for what, truly? because a little more yellow dirt
has fallen to their share. I believe there are but few who know the true value
of riches, and fewer still reflect that they are only stewards of the wealth
which the bounty of their Creator has committed to their care; and at last,
when we all come to give an account of our stewardship, the man who from a
truly compassionate nature has wiped the tear from the eyes of orphans,
softened the fetters of the captive, or cheared the widow, will receive a
greater reward than the ostentatious wretch, who, having spent his whole life
in amassing treasure, on his deathbed, when he can no longer enjoy it, leaves,
it for the endowment of an hospital. Such a man is not charitable from his
feelings for others, but an inordinate desire he has to have his own memory
held in veneration.

THE REPROOF.
AND do you think there are such characters in the world, said the old
lieutenant?

I fear there are too many, friend, said I.

I know not how it was, said he, but I never suspected mankind of half the
vices and follies I have found in this skort month that I have been in London;
and even now I do not think their errors proceed half so much from the badness
of their hearts as their heads. I own, continued he, it is our duty to render
every service in our power to our fellow creatures, but why should one, because
he has a just sense of his duty, and discharges it faithfully, despise, another
because he has not the same feelings. I felt a consciousness of having, in
commending benevolence, sounded my own praise -- (...) my turn to be ashamed.
-- I felt abashed, and (...), as it were, into nothing. -- Oh, man! what a poor
weak creature thou art, when even in the moment of discharging thy duty, thy
own heart, easily led astray, will vaunt and boast its own superiority. -- The
most benevolent action in the world loses its intrinsic merit, when the man who
performs it says to himself, I am better than my neighbor; I am not hard
hearted, nor proud, nor avaricious.

No, cries humility, but you are vainglorious.

I was quite disconcerted, and could not forgive myself.

THE MEETING.
I HAD ordered my servant to supply Mr. Nelson (for that was the name of the
old lieutenant) with every thing necessary for him to appear in at dinner, and
then went to seek my Emma. -- I found her in the garden -- the young lady I had
rescued last night, was busy in platting a little lock of hair, and placing it
in a fanciful manner to the bottom of a picture which hung and round her neck.
When she had finished, she glanced her eye toward us, and thinking she was not
observed, pressed it several times to her lips. I thought I saw a tear in her
eye, but the chaste look, the religious fervor with which she gazed upon the
portrait, convinced me it was a tear whose source might be acknowledged without
a blush.

She had dropped the picture, and, resting one arm upon a pedestal, seemed
attentively watching Harriet and Lucy, who had dressed a little favorite dog
in their dolls clothes, and was teaching it to dance a minuet. -- The scene was
picturesque; and I know not how long I might have contemplated it with silent
satisfaction, had I not observed Mr. Nelson coming toward me with eager step
and anxious eye.

Tell me, who is that? said he, pointing to the young lady -- but that I think
it is impossible, I should say it is my Narcissa.

At the sound of his voice the young lady looked up, and advancing a few steps,
stood in an attitude of wonder and astonishment, till he pronounced the name of
Narcissa; when springing like lightning to him, she threw her arms round his
neck, and cried, Yes, yes, I am your child.

It would be doing injustice to the rest of the scene, were I to attempt to
describe it -- words a could not speak the feelings of their hearts -- It was a
meeting between a fond father and an affectionate child -- and I leave it to
such to judge of their happiness.

THE REQUEST.
WHEN we had dined, and the cloth was removed -- Tell me, my dear Sir, said
Narcissa, by what lucky accident you came acquainted with this gentleman, and
what brought you at this time to London?

How can you ask me that, my child? replied the old man; did you think your
mother and myself could sit quietly down when you had been absent from us near
a month, and we had never had a single line from you?

I wrote twice a week, said Narcissa, wiping her eyes -- she could not bear to
hear her mother had been distressed.

The old man continued --

I was too much interested in the safety of my dear girl to be at ease under
such disagreeable appearances; so leaving your mother what money I could spare,
I sat out to walk to London, but was prevented by this gentleman. -- On my
arrival in town I went to the place where the old lady resided, and was told by
her servant that you were gone out of town to pass a few weeks -- I walked to
the place whither I was directed, but could find no such person -- My little
stock was almost exhausted -- I went again to the lady's house, and was treated
by her servant with insolence.

Narcissa laid her hand on his shoulder, and gave him a look that I am sure
would have healed every wound the servant's insolence had given his heart,
though they had been a thousand.

Oh! filial love, fair daughter of gratitude, sister to piety, thou first
favorite of Heaven, to whom long life and prosperous days are promised, how
does thy angel's face and soothing hand make the paternal evening of life clear
and unclouded! -- But I am wandering from my story.

I was now, continued Mr. Nelson, reduced to my last shilling, and being a week
in arrears for my lodging, was forced to sell my coat, and be content with an
old ragged surtout -- I wrote to the lady two days since, but received no
answer, and was almost driven to despair -- when chance again threw me in the
way of this gentleman -- But how am I to account for your being here, my child?
-- what was the cause of your neglect and silence? -- I think, Narcissa, if you
had known my anxiety, you would have relieved it by either coming or writing to
me.

NARCISSA.
THE person to whose care you entrusted me, said Narcissa, was a vile woman;
and it is only by a miracle I can have escaped her snare -- I never knew you
was in town -- I have been whirled about from one folly to another, and have
been witness to such scenes of shame as made me shudder; but I was told it was
usual for people of quality to lead a life of riot, which my vile preceptress
termed pleasure. -- A young nobleman paid me particular attention, talked much
of love and settlements, and grandeur, but never mentioned marriage -- I was
ever on my guard; nor, indeed, was my heart prepossessed in his favor -- His
person was not unpleasing, but his manner was disgusting, his morals corrupt,
and his conversation unchaste -- I had frequently entreated leave to return to
the country; frequently wrote to you, my dear father, desiring to be commanded
home -- But last night, last night --

She then proceeded to give him an account of what has been already related to
the reader -- When she mentioned the villain's attempt upon her honor, her
father looked down to the side where his sword used to hang -- then at his hand
-- then at his child -- then at his hand again --

It is not so withered, said he, but it might send a sword to his heart -- It
is not so much unnerved, said he, rising, and placing himself in an attitude of
defense, but it might make a villain tremble.

He is beneath your anger, said Narcissa, taking his hand and kissing it --
this hand, said she, that so often has fought for the honor of your country,
shall never be sullied with the blood of a coward; for who but a coward would
ruin a poor, defenseless woman.

WOMAN.
WHO but a coward indeed, cried I, for who can look at a woman in all her
native loveliness, helpless, unarmed, and devoid of the least defense against
the numerous dangers that await her, who that sees her sweet looks, that seem
to speak in nature's pure language -- behold I am at your mercy, you are my
protector, I am weak and defenseless, it is you must guard me -- who but a
barbarian, after having seen woman in this light, would attempt to injure or
insult her? Yet do I blush while I confess it, instead of remembering our duty
toward the lovely sex, man, who was designed by Heaven as their friend, is
become their seducer; and the fairer the flower, the more eager are they to
blast it -- like the scaley snake, who tries to draw to its devouring jaws the
harmless bird that thoughtless hops from spray to spray; he twines about, shows
all his gilded scales, basks in the sun, rears up his crested head, and courts
the little songster to his snare -- It ventures first to gaze at a distance on
him, then, by degrees, draws nearer to admire, till, fascinated by his subtle
arts, it drops into his jaws, and meets destruction.

Oh! how my heart has often bled to see so many lovely women, who were intended
by nature to be the pleasing bond of society, the source of virtuous pleasures,
reduced to the sad alternative of perishing for want, or living on the wages of
prostitution. -- But oh! woman, when thou can so far forget what is due to
thy own sex, as to be accessory to the ruin of the innocent, my heart swells
with indignation -- thou art then like the fallen angel, who, when in heaven,
was the first among the bright ethereal bodies, but falling, becomes the
lowest; and envious of those joys which he can never taste, exerts his arts,
his malice, and deceit, to draw down others to the same dark abyss which he
himself is plunged in.

THE EAST-INDIAN.
HE had frequently begged of me -- and when I relieved him, returned a look of
gratitude -- I always feel myself interested for those poor creatures who are
brought from their native country, and exposed to all the horrors of famine in
a place with whose customs and language they are entirely unacquainted -- I
say, within myself, what a poor miserable wretch should I be, if I were left in
their country, without money or friends -- We can never feel, properly, the
woes of another, unless we place ourselves, for a few moments, in their
situation.

This man was generally near my habitation, and I often felt something like
curiosity to know his history -- He appeared to me superior to the common rank
of beggars -- I will ask him, said I, one day; perhaps it may lie in my power
to make his life a little more tolerable -- I sent for him to my study, and
having proffered my service, inquired into his former fortunes -- Christian,
said he, I am a man who hold your race in utter abhorrence -- I have been
injured, vilely injured, by them, in return for kindness and friendship -- I
have my history by me, written in my own language: if you can translate it, I
will bring it you; and you will then see how little I ought to depend on the
word or promise of a Christian.

THE INQUISITOR, etc.
EAST INDIAN CONTINUED.
POOR fellow! said I, looking at him with an eye of compassion as he went out
of the apartment -- Poor fellow! thou have been hardly used by one man who
called himself a Christian, and it makes thee suspect the whole race -- But,
surely, said I, it is not a man's barely professing Christianity, that makes
him worthy that character; a man must behave with humanity, not only to his
fellow creatures, but to the animal creation, before he can be ranked with
propriety among that exalted class of mortals.

The man who with unmerciful hand scourges his slave, does he then remember
that the person he is chastising is endowed with the same sense of feeling as
himself, and is as sensible of pain, hunger, thirst, cold, aye, and all the
social blessings of life? has filial, conjugal, and paternal affection? -- then
why, because he is a slave, should you bestow on him painful stripes, when
yourself would shrink to receive but the smallest of them? -- Does the name of
Slave, --

Slave! said I, rising as I spoke, while the sanguine tide that plays about my
heart, rushed unbidden to my cheeks --

Why did I blush, why did I tremble, as I pronounced the word slave? -- It was
because I was ashamed of the appellation -- It is a word that should never be
used between man and man -- The negro on the burning sands of Africa, was born
as free as him who draws his first breath in Britain -- and shall a Christian,
a man whose mind is enlightened by education and religion, for a little sordid
pelf, sell the freedom of this poor negro, only because he differs from him in
complexion? -- What right has an European to sell an African? do they leave
their native land, and seek our coast, by arts entice our countrymen away, and
make them slaves? --

THE SLAVE.
I WALKED out, and endeavored to dissipate the disagreeable reflection; but
the idea of slavery pursued me still.

Unhappy man, said I, as busy fancy drew out the sad scene.

She held up to my mind's eye, a man born to a good inheritance, and surrounded
with all the comforts, all the blessings, he desired -- but he was a negro.

He was sitting in his little hut, his jetty companion by his side; one infant
at her breast, two others prattling at her knee; she looked, she felt happy.
Her husband, her children, were with her; serenity played on every countenance;
content had fixed her habitation in their dwelling -- Some Europeans enter --
they deck his beloved children with baubles -- they tie beads round the arms of
his wife -- and ornament her jetty looks with glittering toys -- He is charmed
with their courtesy -- He walks with them to the sea side, and takes his boy,
his eldest darling, with him -- they invite them on board the vessel -- Poor
soul! unsuspecting their treachery, he goes, and bids adieu to liberty for ever
-- His wife, taking advantage of his absence, trims up their hut -- lays her
dear babes to sleep -- and then prepares a supper for her love, composed of
wholesome roots and fruit -- She wonders why he stays -- She leaves her home,
and walks toward the sea; she sees him embark -- her child goes too -- the
sailors spread the sails -- the vessel moves -- she shrieks -- but there my
heart was wrung so keenly, I could go no farther.

I left the wife, and followed the poor negro -- he had no comfort but the idea
that he should be with his child; that he should have it in his power to ease
him if heavy tasks were imposed, to guard him from dangers, and teach him to be
resigned and contented. -- They arrive at Barbados -- they are exposed to
sale, and allotted to different masters.

Alas! poor man, tears and entreaties are vain, you are in the hands of the
sons of Mammon.

Fancy still led me forward -- I saw him when age and infirmities came on
without one comfort, without one friend, on a miserable bed, sickness and sad
remembrance his only companions -- he is weary of life -- he offers up a prayer
for his still dear companion, for his children, his hapless enslaved child --
He dies -- and is thrown into the grave without a prayer to consecrate the
ground, without one tear of affection or regret being shed upon his bier.

Had not that poor negro a soul?

Yes -- and in futurity it shall appear white and spotless at the throne of
Grace, to confound the man who called himself a Christian, and yet betrayed a
fellow creature into bondage.

It would give me a great deal of pleasure, said I, to have the history of the
East Indian -- but when I have got it, how shall I translate it? -- I know
nothing of the language; but, perhaps I may be able to procure a person to
translate it for me.

How do you do? my good friend, said a man, rather shabbily dressed. -- Now I
make it a rule never to turn my back on a man because he had rather wear a
threadbare coat, than run in debt with his tailor; so I turned about to
present my hand to the person who addressed me with such cordiality, and
perceived in him the features of an old school-fellow.

THE CLERGYMAN.
I FEAR, said I, as we went forward -- I fear you have not been successful in
gaining any permanent settlement -- pray how have you disposed of yourself
these last seven years?

I have, he replied, been strangely tossed about, beheld various scenes, tried
many different plans, and been unsuccessful in them all.

When I left Oxford, I was recommended by a friend of my father's to be
preceptor to the only son of a man of large fortune -- he was a sprightly,
sensible lad, but extremely capricious in his humor, which was owing to his
parent's never allowing him to be contradicted. For a month or six weeks we
went on very well; my young gentleman was fond of learning, took every thing
with surprising facility, and gave me little or no trouble in obliging him to
attend his book -- but the unbounded applause he received from his parents, the
caresses and indulgencies they were continually heaping on him, and the praise
every casual guest was obliged to bestow on this darling of the family, soon
made him think he was as learned as any of the seven wise men of Greece, and
therefore had no farther need of a preceptor.

When I found he grew careless and neglectful, I thought a little correction
might be necessary; but, on trying the experiment, was called by the over-fond
mother, an inhuman monster; and the father thought his boy had a genius too
bright to require such rough methods of proceeding. In short, Sir, having no
power over the child, he soon lost what little learning he had at first
attained; and I was dismissed with the character of having ruined the boy's
genious by ill-timed and unmerciful correction.

As I had taken orders, I lived for some time by occasionally reading prayers,
or preaching for a vicar who was very old and infirm, but having a large
family, could not well afford to pay a constant curate. -- In the course of
this time I became acquainted with a young lady, possessed of every virtue that
might render her a desirable companion; add to this, she had two hundred pounds
in her own possession, and lived with an uncle, who, besides an affluent
fortune, had an excellent living in his gift -- the old incumbent of which was
in a very declining state of health -- had Maria been poor I should have loved
her; but I should never have thought of marrying her in the circumstances I
then was, as I knew it must involve us both in misery. She was all gentleness;
and while she thought the sentiment she felt for me was only pity for my
precarious, disagreeable situation, it by degrees ripened into a tender and
lasting affection. -- Her uncle had ever studied her happiness, and thinking it
would soon be in his power to settle us both in an easy, desirable living, he
encouraged my pretensions, and in a few months made me the husband of Maria.

It would be needless to mention the happiness I enjoyed for eight months with
this amiable woman; suffice it to say, I envied not the wealthiest or most
opulent man in Europe. But our happiness was too great to be permanent -- her
uncle had ever been a man of sound constitution, and though then in the
sixtieth year of his age, gave no signs of infirmity or decay: but, alas! who
can depend on so frail a thing as life? -- One morning, having waited breakfast
till near ten o'clock, surprised at the old gentleman's lying so long, as he
was in general an early riser, I tapped at his chamber door, but received no
answer. I opened it, and went in, and found he had taken his final leave of
this world. I felt myself extremely shocked; but fearing for Maria, who, at
that time was pregnant, I composed myself, and going down, told her that her
uncle being rather indisposed, desired not to be disturbed.

On pretense of going for an apothecary, I went and informed and intimate
friend of Maria's with the melancholy affair. We determined she should call and
take Maria out, and by various methods keep her from home all day; when in the
evening we would, by degrees, acquaint her with the sad tidings -- But all
these precautions were vain. -- During my absence, one of servants had entered
the room, which, in my agitated state of mind, I had forgot to lock, and
instantly alarmed her mistress. At my return, I found my poor Maria in an agony
of grief, which, however, was happily of no ill consequence to herself or the
infant.

When my uncle was buried, we examined his papers, and no will being found, a
distant male relation took possession of the whole estate. I removed with my
wife from the house; still flattering myself, when the old incumbent died, I
should have the living; but I was mistaken. In a few months the old man paid
the debt of nature, and the living was disposed of to another person.

Our disappointment was very great -- but the two hundred pounds Maria
possessed, hindered us from being immediately exposed to want, but that sum was
gradually decreasing -- beside a child, which was born soon after my uncle's
decease, Maria promised to make me father of another. At any other time, this
would have given me great pleasure -- but the unsettled state of my affairs,
made me regret that this poor little infant was coming into a world to inherit
nothing but penury.

About this time I was recommended to Lord Ernoff, whose eldest son was going
abroad, and wanted a governor; however painful it might be to part with Maria,
yet the promise of a handsome salary led me to accept the proposal.

I left the dear woman, and set out to make the tour of Europe with my young
Lord. -- I had been absent from my native country three years, and found myself
highly in favor with the young gentleman abroad, and his father at home --
who, to recompense my fidelity to his son, was continually heaping favors on
Maria and the children.

We were at Madrid, when my Lord commenced an intrigue with a woman of rank and
reputation. -- It was in vain I represented to him the dangerous consequences
that might ensue from such an illicit amor. -- The more I remonstrated, the
more obstinate he appeared* and unfortunately soon succeeded in ruining the
object of his dishonorable pursuit.

Having obtained every favor from the easy, thoughtless Leonilla, he was
preparing to leave Madrid. -- She was informed of his design (and the revenge
of a Spanish woman, when injured, being always adequate to the love they once
bore their seducer) she hired bravoes to dispatch this young nobleman the night
preceding that appointed for our departure.

We had dined out -- and the evening being fine, preferred walking home, rather
than going in a carriage.

I perceived two men watch and follow us through every street, till coming to
one that was dark and unfrequented, one of the men came up and attempted to
stab my Lord -- I drew my sword, and aiming at the villain's heart threw myself
before the young nobleman, and received the poignard of the second assassin in
my own bosom.

This little scuffle having made some noise, people soon gathered round, when
the ruffians finding themselves disappointed in their aims, made off. -- My
Lord, thinking a longer stay at Madrid would be dangerous, left me to the care
of a surgeon and nurse, and departed next morning for saris, from whence he
proposed returning to England.

THE MOURNER.
MY friend was proceeding in his narrative, when our attention was engaged by
the appearance of a woman habited like a pilgrim, but in deep mourning -- such
an appearance being uncommon in England, it naturally excited our curiosity.

We were in Kensington Gardens. --

The mourner's stature was above the lower size, and there was a certain
dignity about her which spoke her of no common rank -- her features had once
been lovely; and even now, though pale and marked with grief, there was a
something in them that engaged the affections, and insensibly drew the heart
toward her. -- She seated herself upon the ground, and resting her elbow on
the root of a tree -- her head reclining pensively on her hand -- she plucked
up some wild daisies that grew round her -- it amused her for the moment, but
recollecting herself, she cried --

They will soon die, and I have killed them.

The thought seemed to give her exquisite pain. -- She dropped the daisies on
the ground, and burst into tears.

I will not look at them, said she, rising, and bending her steps another way.

Alas! poor soul, said I, it is not these flowers you would fly from, it is
yourself and your own painful reflections.

That is very true, said she (turning toward me, and laying her hand on my
arm) I would fain forget that I was the murderer of an innocent man -- I am
trying to expiate my fault by fasting and hard penance. I have come a
pilgrimage of many hundred miles on foot, nor rested my weary limbs, but when
necessity obliged me to cross the sea. -- If I could find the woman I have made
a window, and the children I have rendered orphans, I would do something to
make their lives happy, and then return home, and devote myself to the Blessed
Virgin.

Alas, continued she, still resting on my arm, and laying her other hand on her
heart -- alas, you know not what a sad thing it is to be an orphan. I once had
a father -- had he lived -- but, poor man, he had been to the wars; and when he
returned, he met my mother's corpse just going to the grave. -- He wept not --
he never once complained, but following in silence, saw her interred -- then
laid himself down on the cold turf that covered her, and never rose again.

Here she seemed quite lost -- and leaving me abruptly, walked to a retired
part of the garden.

I never felt my pity so strongly excited as at this moment. -- The whole tenor
of the mourner's discourse and actions discovered the disorder of her mind. She
seemed to have experienced a variety of misfortunes which had banished fair
reason from her throne. Poor girl, said I, how severely must your heart have
been wrung before you were drove to this miserable situation!

But come, said I, turning to my friend, finish your recital. -- He attempted
to speak, but was forced to stop -- something rose in his throat -- I felt the
same in mine -- but what that was, I will leave to the imagination of every
reader of sensibility.

THE COURTIER.
MY Lord's departing from Madrid without me, continued my friend, occasioned a
report to be spread that I had died of my wounds, and indeed never was a man
nearer the confines of the grave than I was -- but by the care and attention of
the people that were about me, I was in six weeks able to go into the country,
where I remained above two months in a languid, weak state, during which time I
received not one line from my Lord -- as soon as I found myself able to bear
the fatigue of traveling, I set forward for England, where I arrived about ten
months since, and found my dear Maria in a situation truly deplorable -- The
old Earl was dead, and the son daily expected from Paris, where he had made a
longer stay than he at first intended -- Maria had been six months without
receiving any money on my account, as my Lord had wrote to his father's
steward, informing him that I chose to be left at Madrid -- I endeavored to
get employ; and, after many fruitless attempts, at last got a curacy of thirty
pounds a year, which is but trifling to support a wife and two children -- I
have frequently wrote to my Lord, who has been at his seat in Essex ever since
his arrival in England; but either has been prevented from answering my letters
by a multiplicity of business, or he does not choose to be troubled with an
indigent friend -- Yet I cannot bring myself to think it possible for a human
being to be so ungrateful as to turn a deaf ear to the complaint of a man who
once saved his life, at the hazard of his own -- He arrived in town three days
since; and this day, at two o'clock, I propose waiting on him, and requesting
his assistance.

We will take an hackney-coach, and I will set you down at his door, said I.

When we arrived within ten yards of the house, I stopped the coach, and
getting out, wished my friend a good morning, and turned down a street, only to
put on my ring -- when quickening my pace, I was at the Earl's door as soon as
he was.

A servant appeared, whose insolent carriage bespoke the character of his Lord.

You may always judge of a man's general demeanor and disposition by the
behavior of his servant, the lower class of mankind always aping the manners
of their superiors.

After some hesitation, and a few leering, saucy looks at the rusty garb of my
friend, he left him standing in the hall, and went up to my Lord.

Having waited full a quarter of an hour, he again made his appearance at the
top of the stairs, and reaching his body partly over the ballustrades, called
out, You may come up.

I followed him into the chamber of the young Earl -- He was sitting in an easy
chair, dressed in a long robe de chamber, a dish of chocolate in one hand and
the news-paper in the other; -- his back was partly toward the door; -- and on
my friend's being announced, he neither turned his head nor raised his eyes
from the paper --

I have taken the earliest opportunity to wait on your Lordship, said my
friend, bowing.

Oh, Mr. Teachum, said my Lord, I am glad to see you -- Set Mr. Teachum a chair
-- said he to the servant -- and when did you arrive in England, Mr. Teachum?

I had the honor of informing your Lordship by letter, he replied, about six
months since, and of the mistake that was made concerning my salary, which was
stopped from the time your Lordship left Madrid.

Why, Teachum, said my Lord, lifting up his eyes, for the first time, from the
paper, and looking at my friend with a sort of surprise, I thought from that
time you was free from my service.

Very true, my Lord; but the wound I received in your Lordship's service
confined me to my apartment for a long time; and the attendance I received was
very expensive -- I had nothing to depend on but your Lordship's bounty.

Well, I will see and recompense you for your salary's being stopped --

Pray, how have you lived since your return to England?

But poorly, my Lord; I have but thirty pounds a year.

My Lord again looked up; but it was a look of disbelief.

And how many children have you?

Two, my Lord; a boy and a girl.

Well, I will see and do something for the boy -- and let me think -- yes,
there is the living at Wiltham, about three hundred a year -- that will just
suit you -- call on me again in a day or two; I shall always be glad to see you.

So saying, he got up, and without farther ceremony, walked into the next room
-- my friend departed, and I followed my Lord -- He pulled the bell -- John,
said he to the servant that entered, I desire you will tell the porter never to
admit that shabby parson again; I don't like to be teazed with visits from such
mean-looking people.

Mr. Bauble waits below, said the servant.

Desire Mr. Bauble to walk up -- and when Miss L'Estrange comes, let me know.

The jeweller entered, and in a few moments after, Miss L'Estrange, whose
levity of carriage, studied negligence, and confident stare, at once spoke her
profession.

A number of jewels were displayed; and this Lord, who had not a guinea to
spare for the poor man who saved his life, lavished four hundred pounds on
jewels for an infamous strumpet.

And is such a man, said I, as I left the house, is such a man as this a peer
of the realm? can he, who ought to ornament the nation, thus shamefully
disgrace it! -- Of all the crimes a man can commit, ingratitude is the
blackest: It argues a depravity of heart, a mind stupid and insensible; it sets
a man below the brute creation -- the animal world in general are grateful,
affectionate and faithful -- But man -- man, whose boasted reason makes him
lord over those who act merely from instinct, loses his superiority by folly
and ingratitude -- I am certain that the man who is unmindful of a benefit
conferred on him by a brother mortal, is totally destitute of gratitude toward
the great source of his life, health and prosperity.

THE VISIT.
I WILL go and see Teachum, said I, one day, after having recounted his story
to my Emma -- She would accompany me --

Their habitation was small, but every thing about was neat to excess; there
was nothing to be seen that spoke distress; the children were clean; Maria
herself, though her attire was plain, appeared the model of elegance -- she was
hearing her children their lesson; they stood before her, reading each
alternately a verse from the sacred writings.

Teachum was leaning over the back of her chair, gazing at his children, with
eyes expressive of as much pleasure, and far more serenity, than the miser who
contemplates his hoarded treasure --

We are come to spend an hour with you, said I, leading my Emma into the room.

Maria was embarrassed; but she was too polite to make unnecessary excuses
concerning her dress or apartment -- I always think such apologies are a sort
of reproof for an untimely visit.

Have you seen my Lord lately? said I.

He is never at home, replied Teachum.

I am sorry for it, said I; and believe me, my friend, I think your attendance
on him is entirely unnecessary, and your hopes from that quarter fruitless -- I
have taken the liberty of calling, to offer you any service that is in my
power, and to beg you will look upon me as your friend. I shall hope to see you
often at my house.

And I hope, said Emma, that Mrs. Teachum and my little friends here will
always accompany you.

I have been sadly perplexed for these few days, said I, changing the
conversation -- I have got a manuscript in my possession written in the Eastern
language; I am certain it contains some extraordinary incidents, but cannot get
at the particulars, being almost entirely unacquainted with the characters it
is wrote in.

It is lucky, said Teachum, that you have mentioned it to me; I ever took great
pleasure in studying the Eastern languages, and am a great admirer of their
style; it is simple and elegant, and though we may translate it with tolerable
correctness, we can never entirely preserve its native purity -- If you will
put the manuscript into my hands I will use my endeavors to translate it. I
have many leisure hours, in which I amuse myself with my pen.

I was highly pleased with the idea of having the adventures of the poor Indian
in my native language, and desired Teachum to call on me next day; when,
fearful of paining them by a longer visit, we reluctantly took our leave.

Emma, at parting, put something into the hand of the girl; and seeing I
observed her, she took my hand when we were seated in the carriage -- it was
but a trifle, my love, said she; and I had saved it from my own private
expenses.

Had she just been giving away half my fortune, the look, the manner in which
she pronounced these words, would have instantly obtained forgiveness.

THE METHODIST.
EMMA intended to call on several of her acquaintance. -- I hate visits of
ceremony -- so alighting from the carriage, I strolled into the fields.

An itinerant preacher was mounted above a listening multitude, bawling out the
virtues and excellencies of charity, and strongly recommending brotherly love
among the elect -- all his cry was faith and charity; at the same time he
declared every one to be in a state of perdition that differed from his sect in
their opinion concerning religious matters. I never was partial to people of
this persuasion; not that I condemn the whole class -- no, far be it from me to
censure a large body of people, because some of the members are hypocrites. --
I have known many people, who profess Methodism, humane, charitable, and just;
but they were people of enlarged ideas, and liberal education -- the solemn
gait -- sanctified air -- upcast eyes -- and tongue ever ready with scripture
phrases and quotations, are by no means the signs of genuine piety. -- A
cheerful, contented disposition -- a heart grateful for every blessing, and
resigned to the all-wise dispensations of Providence -- and a hand ready to
bestow on others part of the blessings we enjoy ourselves; -- these are the
results of pure religion -- these are the acceptable sacrifices in the sight of
our Creator.

When the preacher had finished his oration, he descended from the tub on which
he had stood; and with his hat in his hand, walked round to his numerous
congregation, every one warm with the impression made by his discourse, readily
contributed something toward the support of a man who was so eloquent in
recommending them to seek the right way to eternal happiness.

The collection that was made must have amply repaid him for the time and
breath he had spent in exhorting them to charity.

I should like to know, said I, whether this man practices the virtue himself,
he so strongly recommends to others.

I put on my ring, and followed him home.

His habitation was at Chelsea -- at his door he was met by a woman decently
dressed, but dejected in her countenance -- her eyes were swollen with tears.

Well, said the man, pushing rudely by her, is he gone?

He is gone, she replied -- gone for ever.

What, is he dead?

Yes.

And in my house -- why was he not removed to the workhouse?

Alas, Sir, replied the woman, the parish officers came to take him away; and
the exertions he made to rise and dress himself, being too much for his weak
frame, he expired as they were putting him into the chair.

And who will pay for the funeral?

The parish will.

And do you think he shall go out of this house till I am paid my rent? -- No,
no, as he has died here, he shall stay till every farthing owing me is
discharged. -- Have you got any money now?

Not one halfpenny, or a morsel of bread for my poor children -- But I will
sell my bed -- it is the last thing I have left, and we will henceforth sleep
on straw.

You shall sell nothing -- touch nothing till I am paid. -- What, do you think
I am to lose a whole year's rent?

Have you no compassion on a poor widow and six fatherless children? said the
woman.

I do not know what business such poor folks have to get children, he replied.
Go, go along woman; I am going to dinner, and cannot be troubled with your
whining and complaints.

I took off my ring and following the poor woman up stairs, gave her something
to quiet the apprehensions her inhuman landlord's discourse had inspired.

As I passed from the staircase to the street door, I heard this teacher of
charity pouring forth a long grace over his meat.

Hypocritical wretch! said I, do thou think this lip service is acceptable to
God? -- Mistaken man, thou art mocking the Lord of the universe. -- Go, divide
your meal with the widow and the fatherless -- it is the best way of showing
your gratitude to him who gave it to you.

Such men as this, said I, as I left the house, are a great deal more
prejudicial to society than the professed libertine. When we see a man neglect
all religious duties -- break through all ties, moral and divine, we naturally
turn from him with horror and detestation. -- But, when a man, under the clock
of piety and virtue, who professes a just sense of religion, is discovered to
be hard-hearted -- oppressive -- avaricious -- selfish -- in short, living in
the private practice of every vice he publicly declaims against; is it not
enough to make the generality of the world conclude that religion is no more
than a specious mask put on to deceive mankind?

Religion, in her own native simplicity, is truly lovely -- she attracts
admiration -- charms the soul by her precepts -- and passing with us through
life, blunts the points of those arrows of affliction which it is the lot of
every mortal to experience.

But, hypocrisy too often puts on her pleasing garb; and, when discovered,
leads mankind to think the angel-face of piety hides the foul fiend beneath.

THE STUDY.
MR. TEACHUM was in my study full half an hour before I came down. -- Well, my
friend, said I, as I entered, don't you think I have got a fine parcel of
writings? -- Here in this drawer, pointing to one that was partly open, I keep
all my heroic poetry -- here is another for plays -- another for odes, sonnets,
pastorals, etc. -- What a charming prize these would be to some garreted
author; he might sell all this waste paper for at least twopence a pound -- it
would then turn to some account, for it might serve to wrap penny-worths of
tobacco -- light pipes, fires, etc. or, in short, be applied to any other use
the possessor might want waste paper for

What an humiliating idea! said my friend, smiling.

Not at all, said I; in following the dictates of imagination, and employing my
pen, I please, I amuse myself -- but if my writings are not so lucky as to
please and amuse others, why should I be mortified? -- Every man has a peculiar
taste; and between you and I, my friend, every man has a peculiar hobbyhorse,
on which he frequently mounts, and rides away post haste, without once
considering who he may discompose, overturn, or offend in the wild career.

I know one man, who, though possessed of a very moderate fortune, and who has
had but a confined education, is so fond of aping the insolent carriage of a
lord, that he is continually distressing his companions by affected grimaces,
and studied gestures -- then he speaks in such a pompous style, and assumes
such an air of consequence, that while he thinks he is received with
admiration, every man of sense must laugh at his folly.

Another is fond of displaying his profound learning in the different sciences
-- at one time he is a professor of music -- at another time he studies logic;
and when by chance you mention either of those sciences, he will run on at
least two hours without either taking breath, or giving you an opportunity to
edge in a single word.

These are their hobby-horses -- writing is mine. I would not give up the
pleasure of writing for any pecuniary gratification that could be offered.

That is, said my friend, because you stand in need of no pecuniary favors;
but ask the poor author, who, in an airy apartment three stories from the
ground, sits invoking the coy muses to assist him in writing something to gain
him a few guineas that might serve to satisfy his butcher, baker, etc. -- ask
him, my good friend, if he will give up the pleasure of writing, to enjoy a
settled salary of sixty pounds a year.

He might readily promise to do so, said I; but take my word for it, the very
first time pen, ink, paper, and an opportunity fell in his way, he would write
an eulogium on the man who had thus generously raised him from distress.

Oh, ye sweet tuneful sisters, may ye never forsake my mansion; but when on the
wing to visit your favorites -- Burney, Moore and Inchbald -- stop for a
moment, and dart a single ray of your sacred fire upon the humblest of your
votaries -- in a sad hour it will enliven me -- in a lonely hour amuse -- and
when happiness deigns to be my companion, it will increase every pleasure.

But come, said I to Teachum, here is the story I wish you to translate. -- I
am going out for a few hours, and shall hope to see it in fair English
characters when come back. -- You shall see part of it at least, said he. So I
left him; and mounting my horse, which was at the door, rode into Hyde Park.

THE FRACAS.
ON my entering the Park, I saw at a distance, a multiplicity of people, some
running one way, some another, and all in the utmost confusion. -- I rode up to
the place, and the first thing that presented itself to my view, was Miss
L'Estrange in a fit, and a few paces from her, a young man laying on the
ground, bleeding. By his side knelt the fair mourner whom I had seen in
Kensington Gardens -- she was endeavoring to staunch the blood that issued
from his side, with her handkerchief -- it seemed a scene of confusion, for no
one was paying the least attention to this wounded man, but this unhappy woman.

I called my servant, and giving him my horse, raised the young man from the
ground, and presently perceived it was Lord Ernoff, whom Teachum had attended
abroad.

I assisted the fair mourner to bind up his wound with our handkerchiefs, and a
servant at that moment arriving with a surgeon and a litter, we lifted him on
it, and proceeded to the nearest house -- the surgeon thinking the sooner his
wound was dressed the better.

The mourner followed pensively -- often crossing herself, sighing, and weeping
bitterly -- no one attempted to obstruct her entrance into the house with us.

The wound was dressed, and the surgeon pronounced it not dangerous, provided a
fever could be prevented.

Lord Ernoff had fainted through loss of blood; and during the time of his
wound being dressed, remained in a state of insensibility.

It was judged proper that he should be immediately put to bed; but, when the
servant attempted to move him, the mourner came to me, and entreated that she
might not be separated from him -- for, indeed Sir, said she, I heartily
forgive him -- I do not wish his death now, though once I sought to have
assassinated him; but I have since been taught that we should forgive those who
injured us. Alas! if it were not for the reflection that I am not at enmity
with any mortal breathing, how should I have hope to obtain pardon of my
Creator for the heinous crime I have committed whilst in pursuit of my revenge?

I thought from these few words that this hapless mourner could be no other
than poor Leonilla. -- I entreated the people of the house to let her remain
with the wounded nobleman; and attended her up to his chamber, where he was in
bed, and just recovering his senses.

She approached the bed, and sitting down on the side, took one of his hands --
kissed it, and pressed it to her bosom.

He lifted his languid eyes, and fixed them on her face -- at first they spoke
amazement and terror -- but at last grief.

Where am I? said he -- am I passing the bounds of mortality; and art thou,
blessed shade, suffered to conduct me through the gloomy vale? -- I know why you
look so mournful -- you died of a broken heart -- but I shall be punished for
my crimes.

Compose yourself, my Lord, said the mourner -- you are in no danger, I hope
you may yet live many years, and be happy.

Do you talk of happiness, said he; and do you wish me happy?

I do! I do! So Heaven hear my prayers.

But, tell me, said he, how came you here? -- am I not in England?

She was going to answer -- when I interposed and begged they would both be
silent, and consider of what dangerous consequences a violent exertion of
spirits might be to the young gentleman. She promised obedience, drew the
curtains round the bed, and sat down in an easy chair that stood at the head. A
nurse entering, I took that opportunity to go and enquire what had been the
cause of this unhappy affair.

The servant who attended Miss L'Estrange and his Lordship in their ride that
morning, gave me the following account:

That a strange gentleman rode up to Miss L'Estrange, and accosting her in a
very haughty manner, inquired why she had left him at Paris, and what she had
done with a miniature picture which she had taken from his cabinet the morning
before she left him; the lady pretended not to know him, and complained to my
lord that she was insulted; upon which, high words ensued between the stranger
and Lord Ernoff, when the former, having a pair of pistols ready in his pocket,
offered one to my Lord, who being naturally of a warm disposition, took it, and
before any interposition could be made, they both fired; my Lord's pistol took
no effect, but the stranger's wounded him in the manner you have seen. At the
discharge of the pistols, Miss L'Estrange fainted; but I believe it was more
for fear of the life of the gentleman, than my Lord's. I ran as fast as I could
for a surgeon. --

The servant was proceeding in his story, when he was called away.

Having gained this intelligence, I determined to go immediately to Miss
L'Estrange, who was now become an inmate of Lord Ernoff's house, and see in
what manner she behaved, and whether the servant's suspicions were well founded.

I repaired immediately to his Lordship's house -- inquired for the lady, but
was denied admittance -- a chariot and four was at the door -- I feared some
foul play; and thinking there was no time to be lost, I watched my opportunity,
and putitng on my ring, went into the house, and up to the lady's apartment. I
found her sitting on a sopha, with a large quantity of jewels, etc. on a table
before her; she was bus^^^ in packing them up, but often turned, and addressed
some endearing expressions to an officer who sat beside her, entreating him
never to forsake her again, and telling him what riches she had heaped together
since she had lived with Lord Ernoff.

I examined the features of the pretended officer, and in spite of a large
black patch which he had over one eye, and his eyebrows and complexion being
stained, I soon discovered it to be the villain Cogdie, who had escaped from
the officers of justice as they were conveying him from Gretna Green to London.

I learned from the conversation that passed between Cogdie and Miss
L'Estrange, that she was in reality his lawful wife; but being of a loose
disposition, had broken the matrimonial bonds some years since, and visited
most of the capitals of Europe with a young nobleman, whose fortune she had
ruined, and finding him no longer able to support her extravagance, she had
left Paris with Lord Ernoff, with whom she had lived for this twelvemonth past.

I found, also, that chance had thrown Cogdie in her way; and that he, seeing
her in so prosperous a situation, and being himself at a very low ebb of
fortune, had persuaded her that his passion for her was stronger than ever, and
endeavored to prevail with her to rob the Earl, and decamp with him. -- But
L'Estrange was a woman whose avarice was not so easily gratified: she, by
feigning the most passionate tenderness for the Earl, had worked upon his
temper till she persuaded him to make a will greatly in her favor; and then
the insult, etc. which happened in the Park, was planned and executed by
Cogdie. He had marked the pistols; the one he gave to Lord Ernoff was charged
only with powder, but that which he retained himself was loaded with ball.

I was greatly at a loss how to act, as I feared to leave the house to procure
proper persons to secure Cogdie, lest in the mean time he should escape.

L'Estrange told him he ought to prepare for flight; and giving him several
bank notes, some jewels, and other valuables, stepped into another room and
brought out a gown, petticoats, etc. for him to put on. -- I was quite
undetermined in what manner to prevent his departure, when L'Estrange
recollected there was some more money in a bureau in Lord Ernoff's apartment,
which was in a distant part of the house; I followed, and seeing her safe in
the closet, in which there was no bell, and only a small high window, and that
secured with bars: I pulled to the door, locked and bolted it; I then returned
in haste to the apartment where Cogdie was, and seeing him totally absorbed in
the pleasure of contemplating his treasure, fastened both the doors, without
being observed.

Having succeeded thus far, I left the house with precipitation, and procured
proper people to apprehend them; I returned within half an hour, and demanded
entrance. Though I had been absent so short a time, five minutes longer had
been too late; Cogdie and L'Estrange had by their cries alarmed the servant;
for each fearing the other intended information against themselves, were in the
utmost consternation; and violent were their cries for liberty -- the servants
had burst open the doors, and Cogdie was on the stairs in order to depart when
I entered.

I committed them both to the charge of the constable; having first eased them
of the weighty concern of having so much money and jewels to take off. I waited
on them to the house of a neighboring justice, made my accusation in proper
form, and being certain that apartments in a strong, well built mansion, would
be prepared for their reception till further enquiry should be made concerning
the affair, I left them, and returned to the wounded Nobleman; and, from
thence, home.

THE REPARATION.
I THOUGHT you were lost, my love, said Emma, as I entered the parlour about
eleven o'clock, and found her seated at supper with Teachum and his Maria. --
In my hurry and confusion in the morning, though I had sent my servant home, I
had not sent any message by him: I was therefore not surprised at my Emma's
exclamation. The adventures of the day had so entirely taken up my mind, that
the East-Indian had not once intruded; and even when my friend mentioned having
almost completed the translation, I felt no sort of curiosity to see it. -- We
will take a walk tomorrow, said I to Teachum; I have seen Lord Ernoff today,
and, if you like, I will take you to visit him early.

We were at the house where he was before ten o'clock.

As we entered the room without noise, we saw the fair Leonilla in the highest
act of devotion; his Lordship was sitting in the bed, supported by pillows, his
eyes fixed with a mixture of love and veneration on her face, we were unwilling
to disturb them, so drew back behind the curtains. When she had finished her
morning orisons -- Oh, my dear Lord, said she, what a relief do you give my
almost bursting heart, by informing me that your governor is not dead. How
severe has the reflection always been, that my rashness had sent a deserving
man out of the world; a man who had honor, courage, affection, sufficient to
make him value his own life as nothing when the life of his lord was in danger.
It is that cruel idea, and the remembrance of my dear father and mother, that
at times deprives me of my reason; but I will be thankful to that good
Providence that has taken this mighty load off my heart.

I hope you have provided for Mr. Teachum, said she, after a little pause.

It is a shame to own I have not, said my Lord; but I will endeavor to repair
all my errors.

Mr. Teachum is come to see you, my Lord, said I, stepping forward.

Ernoff stretched out his hand, and taking hold of Teachum's, cried, this
wound, my good Dr. Teachum, is an excellent thing.

Indeed, my Lord, replied Teachum, I do not believe any body but yourself
thinks so, all your friends regret it.

I rejoice in it, said his Lordship, it makes me feelingly remember my own
ingratitude.

Teachum walked to the other end of the room -- he was too much of a Christian
to rejoice in the pain of a fellow mortal, though it might be productive of
good to himself. After our noble patient's wound was again dressed, he
requested Leonilla to inform him why she had left her native country.

She said, that when she found by the rumor then prevailing at Madrid, that
Mr. Teachum was killed in defending his Lordship, it lay very heavy at her
heart, and she grew melancholy and sickly. -- I never went to sleep, said she,
but I fancied the shade of the innocent man my rashness had murdered, was
reproaching me. I thought my mind would be easier after confession, and went to
my holy father, confessed my first deviation from duty, my grief, anger,
revenge, and all its fatal consequences. -- The good father rebuked the spirit
of revenge that still was harbored in my bosom, and taught me that penitence,
fasting, and tears, were the only methods to gain the pardon of the Creator for
my heinous offenses -- but, alas! Sir, I could not pray -- my mind was in a
state of horror, not to be described -- remorse, love, and rage, by turns
tormented my soul; but Heaven, offended at my obstinacy and folly, visited me
with a dreadful judgment. -- I had a favorite dog which you had given me; on
this poor inoffensive animal did I vent the various changes of my temper, one
moment caressing it, the next using it with the utmost barbarity. My dear
mother had never suspected my dishonor; she wondered at the alteration so
visible in my health and disposition; and frequently chid me for my unkindness
to this poor little animal. I fear I used it very ill; but, indeed I hardly
know what I did, my mind was so disordered.

My dog ran mad, and bit my dear mother; all medical assistance was tried
without effect -- she expired in the greatest agony. My father who was on a
campaign against the Turks at the time this happened, unfortunately returned
the day before my mother was buried -- he was unprepared for the stroke he saw
my mother' corpse -- he saw me deprived of my senses.

(...) delirium I told him how I had dishonored (...) -- It was too much; he
was not equal to the mighty load of sorrow, but sunk under it.

Since that, I have wandered about, over barren hills and desert plains,
seeking content, but she fled from me as I pursued her. I thought she might
dwell with charity; so I divided my portion with the fatherless and the widow;
but alas! I could never find her -- she is buried in the grave with my dear
parents!

I saw that the recital of her misfortunes had occasioned a return of her
unhappy malady; so taking her by her hand, I led her into another apartment,
and persuaded her to take some repose.

About six weeks after, I had the pleasure of bestowing her in marriage on the
repentant Lord Ernolf. Teachum performed the ceremony; and his Lord gave him as
a marriage portion, the promised living of Wiltham.

Leonilla never after relapsed into her former disordered state of mind. She
entreated that Cogdie and his companions might be forgiven. Her Lord complied
with her request; and she gave them a sum of money, to prevent poverty being an
incentive to future vice. But they were too far immerged in all manner of
deceit to think of amendment, and soon returned to their old practices.

I cannot help here relating a circumstance that happened many years after. --
The son which Olivia brought into the world, the fruit of her unfortunate
attachment to Cogdie, as he advanced in (...), showed no signs of any of his
father's vices (...) disposition, except a propensity to gaming -- (...)
propensity he once indulged at a public gaming house, where an old man having
won from him a considerable sum of money, which the young spark imagining was
not won by fair play; high words arose, and a challenge was given.

They met, fired, and the old man was wounded. -- The son of Olivia, though
hasty in his temper, was generous, humane, and forgiving; he wished not to take
the life even of the man who had wronged him.

He had him carried to his lodgings; and finding him in a poor situation, he
sent for a surgeon, and supplied him with all the necessaries and comforts of
life at his own expense.

A servant in the family who observed the frequent visits of Olivia's son to
this mean, obscure lodging, told it as a secret to Olivia's maid, who directly
told it to her mistress.

Olivia was then at my house; she had often wished an union might take place
between her son and Lucy Heartfree, my fair petitioner. The idea of a secret
mistress immediately alarmed her. -- She desired me to go with her to the place
the servant had mentioned.

I complied.

When we entered the room, the first object that struck our sight was her son
helping a woman to (...) infirm, sickly old man from a chair to the bed; he
was, to all appearance, near his end.

The old man no sooner saw us than he breathed a dreadful groan, and fell back
in his chair. Olivia was greatly agitated -- she applied her salts to his nose.
-- He recovered -- he gazed feebly on her. It is Olivia, said he. -- She
started. -- Do you not know me, Olivia? have you forgot the wretched Cogdie?

Gracious Heaven! cried Olivia, catching hold of her son's hand, it is your
father.

My father! said the youth; then I am a parricide.

Not so, my son, answered Cogdie; you have only revenged your mother's
injuries. -- But, will you forgive me.

May heaven forgive you as freely, said Olivia.

Her son knelt, and craved forgiveness of his dying father.

It is enough said Cogdie. I forgive, and I hope to be forgiven. -- His head
sunk on Olivia's shoulder -- he groaned and expired.

THE CHILDREN.
I THINK you have never read Mr. Teachum's translation, said Emma, one evening,
as I was sitting by her, listening to the innocent prattle of Harriet and her
little companion -- I had some months before committed them to the care of Mrs.
--, of Hammersmith.

Though I had always heard the highest character of this lady and her school,
yet my dear Harriet, who at this time was at home for the holidays raised it in
my opinion -- Lucy, said she, let us play at school -- you shall be Mrs. --,
and I will be a scholar.

You may always judge by the play of children what company, regulations, and
conversation, they are used to.

Come here, Miss Harriet, said Lucy; I hope you are very well this morning, and
quite prepared to say your task; you know I shall take no excuse.

Come, Ladies, it is eight o'clock, and not all dressed yet! -- Oh fie! Miss,
your face and hands are not washed! -- how indelicate that is! -- well, now we
are all ready -- so you must kneel down and say your prayers.

Do you always say your prayers at school, Harriet? said I.

Oh, yes, Papa; Mrs. -- not only makes us say our prayers, but she says her own
prayers with us.

Do you love Mrs. --, my dear?

Yes, indeed, Papa -- I don't know any body but what does love her, she is so
good to us all.

I was so pleased with the account the children gave of this amiable woman,
that by means of my ring I frequently visited her unseen -- there was always
the same decent regularity observed through the whole house.

She had a relation lived with her -- I would mention some acts of humanity
which I have seen this relation perform, but I fear to hurt her delicacy -- Yet
there is one which will never be erased from my mind. It was the kindness she
showed to a poor young woman who was distressed, calumniated, and beset with
dangers -- Yet she knew not the full force of her benevolence; but I, who
visited, unseen, the object of her humanity, know, that she drew her from an
horrid precipice, from whence she must have soon plunged into the gulf of
infamy.

Oh! thou gentle pattern of benevolence and piety, judge not the poor young
woman from appearances -- could thou but see her heart, thou would there
read gratitude to thee, written in indelible characters -- and when she prays
for thee whose bounty she has received, she humbly asks of Heaven the power to
return it. -- But I am always running from the subject I begin with.

My Emma had requested me to read Teachum's translation of the Eastern tale; so
dismissing the children to the nursery, and stirring up the fire, for it was a
cold evening in December, I stepped into my study and brought out the
manuscript.

SADI AND ZELIA.
SADI, the son of Mahadan, the rich possessor of a fertile valley, watered by a
beautiful river -- who had slaves at his command, and was called by the sons of
the East, Sadi the Happy. -- Ah! what avails possessions and treasure? -- and
what is terrestial happiness to man? -- It vanishes like a dream -- it
departs like the mist of the morning before the beams of the sun.

Sadi, the once rich and happy, is a slave, and wretched. -- Go tell this to
the daughters of joy -- sound it in the ears of the sons of pleasure; for
prosperity has hardened their hearts, and made them callous to the feelings of
humanity.

Zelia was the fairest among the daughters of Arabia; she was tall, and
straight as the pine tree; stately as the young cedar; her skin was like the
ripe olive; her eyes, bright stars; her locks were like the polished ebony; and
her teeth, fair rows of pearl; her lips were the color of the ruby; and her
breath like the breezes blowing from the spicy islands.

I built a bower for my Zelia; I adorned it with beautiful flowers, and planted
sweet smelling shrubs around it.

With lofty trees, I fenced out the sun beams; and the birds dwelt in their
branches. -- In the recess was a silver stream; the osiers and wild flowers
hung upon its banks, and the swans sported on its bosom.

I sought my love among the daughters of the plain -- I wooed her in the shady
places -- I brought her to the bower I had planted -- I culled for her the
choicest fruits -- I brought her silks from the looms of Persia -- I platted
her hair with fresh flowers -- I put costly jewels in her ears -- and with
pearls made bracelets for her arms.

We were the happiest among the happy; in the morning we arose together, and
worshipped the bright luminary of day. -- We strayed over the fertile valleys
-- we sported with the young fawns; or retired from the heat, and reposed in
the thick shade.

If I was in pain, she would sooth me. -- I listened to her angel voice all
day; and at night I reposed on her bosom.

The curtain of night had fallen over us -- the stars shot their beams through
the Heavens -- the voice of distress met our ears -- the plaints of sorrow
invaded our dwelling -- we went forth from the bower -- we saw a Christian
overpowered by his adversary. The blood issued from his bosom -- his face was
the picture of terror.

We bore him to our peaceful bower -- we poured oil upon his wounds, and Zelia
bound them up with her hands. -- She watched him with the case of a sister --
she gave him a part of our fruits, and brought him milk from the young camels.
-- He was grateful for the kindness we showed -- he swore by his God it should
not be forgotten. -- But, the word of a man is like unto the wind; it makes a
sound, passes, and is no more remembered.

He left our bower once at early dawn -- he tarried till the close of evening.

Zelia had retired to rest -- the moon beams played upon her face -- I
contemplated her sleeping beauties.

The Christian I had saved, entered the bower -- he brought with him a band of
ruthless ruffians. -- He seized upon my lovely Zelia -- he listened not unto
her cries -- he put a chain upon her feet, and bound the hands which had healed
his wounds.

They took our costly ornaments and pearls -- they bound me with an heavy iron
chain, and led us like two slaves toward the sea. -- They put us on board a
ship he had prepared -- they spread the sails -- the wind blew from the shore,
and in the morn we saw the main before us.

They took the chains from off my hands and feet -- they gave me food, but
parted me from Zelia.

I heard her lift up a voice of terror -- I heard her call on Sadi for
assistance -- I rushed into the room where they confined her -- I saw her in
the embraces of a villain -- I snatched a poniard from his side -- I bade him
instantly forego his prey.

Zelia like lightning darted from his arms -- she cried, Now, Sadi! -- Sadi,
follow me! -- then, from the window sprang into the ocean.

I sent the poniard to the traitor's heart. -- I felt its warm blood gush upon
my hand; then hastily obeyed my charming Zelia. -- I called her as I plunged
into the sea -- I sought my Zelia in the world of waters; but the spirits of
blessed saints had seen her virtue -- they caught the lovely victim as she
fell, and bore her on their wings to paradise. -- I called for death to take a
wretched life -- I sought the friend of misery, but he fled from me.

Some other Christians saved me from the sea; they gave me food, and treated we
with kindness -- but the kindness of a Christian is like the song of the Siren,
it soothes the senses, gains upon the heart; then, unsuspected leads to
destruction. -- They took me with them to the Western world -- they sold the
wretched Sadi for a slave.

My haughty spirit was not used to bondage. -- I heard that England was the
land of freedom -- I hid myself on board an English ship, and sailed unseen
into the boundless main. -- I left my hiding place, and sought the captain, and
bowed my face toward the deck, before him.

He told me, I no more should be a slave -- he brought me with him to this land
of freedom.

But, here I found I also was deceived; for, here mankind are slaves to vice,
to avarice, to luxury, and to folly. -- The man who brought me from the Western
world, demanded payment for my passage over. Alas! I had been rifled by the
Christians. -- I had naught to give but grateful thanks and prayers. -- He who
had said I should not be a slave, confined me in a loathsome prison house --
this was my welcome to the land of freedom.

For seven long years I never felt the air, nor even saw the cheerful face of
Heaven -- but the angel of death that visits all the earth, then stopped the
breath of my hard persecutor. I then was freed from out the loathsome prison,
and for a moment I rejoiced in liberty; but soon I felt the gnawing pangs of
hungar. I had no friend whose pity might relieve me -- the spacious city was to
me a desert, and I was starving in the land of plenty. -- But, who can bear the
griping hand of famine; who can sink under it and not complain? I laid me down
upon the damp, cold ground -- I groaned aloud, and tore my hair through
anguish; but many passed by, nor once regarded me; and others scoffed and
called me an imposter. I thought the end of all my woes was come -- I ceased to
groan, and waited death's approach; but pity had not wholly fled the world she
dwells within the hearts of Christian women -- one brought me something to
allay my hunger; another put some money in my hand -- One seeming almost as
wretched as myself, looked at me, shook her head, and dropped some tears. I felt
her kindness more than those before -- the tear of pity healed my bleeding
heart.

But, the woes of Sadi soon will have an end; soon shall I sleep, and be at
rest for ever, for the sorrows of my heart overpower me, and pain and sickness
how me to the earth. -- The lamp of life is very near exhausted; and when each
night I lay me down to rest, I think not to behold, another morning.

And what, alas! has wretched Sadi done, and, who reduced him to this state of
misery? Go tell the tale to all the Eastern world -- Go warn them to beware of
trusting Christians; for Sadi saved one from the jaws of death, and thus was
his humanity rewarded.

THE CONVERSATION.
THIS is a strange world, said I, laying down the manuscript, and addressing my
dear Emma --

The world, my love, she replied, laying one hand on my shoulder, and with the
other wiping away a drop which poor Sadi's story had excited -- The world, my
love, in itself, is a charming place -- it is the people in it that makes it
uncomfortable. Let us view it at first coming from the hands of the Creator;
what beauty, what regularity and order! but no sooner was man created, than
pride -- avarice -- envy -- revenge -- and a long train of evils --

Not forgetting female vanity and curiosity, said I, looking archly at her. --

Nay, my dear, said she, don't attribute all your evils to our sex; for I am
certain, that had not Adam had a little curiosity in his own composition, he
never could have been prevailed on to stray from his duty -- but we are running
from the subject, continued she.

My remark was, that it is the vile disposition of many people in the world,
not the world itself, that is so disagreeable to those who are possessed of
humanity and feeling. What a delightful place it would be, said I, if harmony,
peace, and love, universally reigned around us; if there was no ingratitude, no
revenge, no rapine, murder, theft, or perjury.

It would, said she; but it is not for us to say why are things thus? let us,
my love, endeavor to perform our duty, and, as far as example will go, lead
others to do the same; and let us be thankful that the world is not so full of
allurements, as to prevent our preparing and hoping for a better: For my own
part, continued she, passing her arm round my neck, while her lovely
countenance beamed with gratitude and love, my cup overflows with blessings; I
feel no sorrows, except it is when I reflect on the vices or sorrow of my
fellow creatures; yet, I must not expect to pass this life exempt from woe. --
Poor Sadi has had a life of misery, it is true, but shall we arraign the Power
Omnipotent, and say, why was it so?

My dear Emma said I, I did not mean to complain of the dispensations of
Providence, when I said it is a strange world; but does it not appear
wonderful, that a man can so far forget a benefit, as to treat his benefactor
with cruelty?

It is unaccountable, said she; and yet we hear of it in more instances than
one -- what a striking proof of ingratitude is related in Addison's pathetic
story of Inkle and Yarico --

Oh, a propos, said I, you never gave me your opinion of the opera taken from
that Story --

I was greatly pleased with it, she replied; I think the author shows (...)
judgment in the management of his plot; for after having excited in our
imagination a proper horror for the avarice and ingratitude of Incle, by
contrasting it with the blunt honesty of Trudge, he makes his hero repent, and,
by unexpectedly bringing him to act with honor and humanity toward his kind
preserver, leaves no impression on the mind of the audience, but an entire love
and admiration of virtue.

I think the remark extremely just, said I, which Incle makes in the conclusion
of the piece -- that, his contracting ideas, and grasping disposition, was
chiefly owing to his education. --

There is nothing, replied my Emma, which, in my opinion, should be so
carefully inculcated in the mind of a child as humanity -- there are many
parents who, out of a mistaken fondness for their children, will suffer them,
by way of amusement, to rob birds nests, catch butterflies, etc. and transfix
them with pins, and a thousand other whims and fancies which are the height of
cruelty; these things by degrees harden their hearts, and they can afterward
practice cruelty on their fellow creatures without repugnance. -- I would
always teach my children to be tender even to the smallest insect that has
life; if, indeed, they are obnoxious or poisonous, and self-preservation leads
us to destroy them, let them be dispatched quick and with as little pain as
possible. -- Then opening a volume of our inimitable Shakespeare, she read the
following passage in Measure for Measure:

The poor blind beetle which we tread upon,
In corporeal suff'rance feels as much
As when a giant falls.
Hail, humanity! fair daughter of Heaven, it is thou, bright angel, that can
smooth the bed of pain, and blunt the sharpest arrow of distress: come, thou
celestial guest! and dwell with me, and with thee bring thy sweet companion
gratitude.

Almighty Power! creator of the universe, said I, teach me to show my gratitude
to thee by practicing humanity toward my fellow creatures.

THE REGISTER OFFICE.
I HOPE you will not disappoint me Madam, said a young woman to an old fat
dame, who kept a Register Office for hiring of servants -- I had entered the
house by means of my ring.

The young woman was something below the middle size, her countenance was
dejected, and she appeared not to be used to servitude.

You had better sit down and rest yourself, my dear, said the old woman.

I will, if you please, replied the other; for it is a long walk from Lambeth.

She entered a little parlour, and sat down; when I learnt from their
conversation that the young woman, whom I shall henceforth call Mariana, was
applying for a place as governess to one or two young ladies, and was promised
by the woman who kept the office, that she should be recommended to Lady
Allworth, who wanted a governess for her two daughters.

It is now six weeks, said Mariana, since I was first proposed to Lady
Allworth, and I should be glad to know whether she will have me or no, for my
circumstances are such as render it absolutely necessary that I should have
some place in a short time -- Tomorrow, Mrs. L -- y, I hope you will go with
me.

The old woman promised faithfully to attend her, and at ten o'clock the next
morning was appointed for her to call.

Then tomorrow I will see thee again, poor, gentle Mariana, said I.

I was by no means pleased with the woman who stepped the office; for while
Mariana was resting herself, two young men of fashion came into the room.

I blush to think, that their being young men of fashion, rendered me uneasy on
the poor girl's account.

There were some very intelligent looks passed between them and the old woman;
and immediately on their leaving the room, Mariana was invited to dine the
ensuing day.

At ten the next day, Mariana again repaired to the office, and was again
disappointed of waiting on Lady Allworth.

I know not what to do, said she, as she left the house; and a tear stole down
her cheek -- She had refused the invitation to dinner, and was proceeding with
melancholy steps toward her home -- I followed her.

When she entered the house, she was wet, cold, and hungry; but there was
neither fire nor refreshment.

She sat down at the end of a long table, and leaned her head upon her hands,
the tears flowed plenteously down her pale face -- she looked the picture of
dumb despair.

I was thinking of some method to relieve her, when a short, fat old gentleman
entered the room.

I read in your face, Mariana, said he, that you have had no success today. --

She shook her head, and asked his advice how to proceed.

I would advise you to go to Lady Allworth yourself -- write a letter, send it
up, and wait for an answer from her Ladyship.

Mariana wiped her eyes, wrote a letter, and then proceeded to measure back the
weary steps she had trod before.

Poor girl! said I, as I followed her, I should like to know how you were
reduced to this situation; but I will not leave you, till I see you are likely
to get some settlement -- Youth and innocence without friends or money, in such
a place as London, must have a hard struggle to keep free from vice, and will
find it impossible to keep free from censure.

I wish Lady Allworth may be as much prepossessed in your favor as I am -- but
perhaps she will not see you; and should she not, you shall not be lost for
want of a friend.

I do verily believe, that during our walk from Lambeth to St. James's street,
I was almost as much agitated as Mariana herself.

She tapped modestly at the door; but I could see it was humiliating to her.

A servant appeared, and she was instantly admitted --

Will you deliver this to Lady Allworth? said she, presenting the letter.

The servant looked at her with compassion -- I thus translated his looks: this
poor girl is come to entreat a favor of my Lady; I will not be the means of
her not obtaining it; I wish the may meet with success.

Sir James Allworth, said I, is a benevolent man; he never suffers a petitioner
to be treated with rudeness or disrespect: I can read his humanity in the
countenance of his domestic.

I had hardly time for the reflection before Mariana was desired to walk up
stairs -- I perceived that she trembled as she ascended; but had her fears been
ever so great, they must all have vanished at the sight of Lady Allworth.

THE DRESSING ROOM.
SHE was an elegant woman, though, arrived to an age when the bloom and
sprightliness of youth is past; yet her face had a benignity about it that
diffused itself over all her features, and seemed enlivened by a ray of
celestial light; her fine black eyes were of that sort that would pierce the
inmost recesses of a guilty soul, but withal, tempered with so much
benevolence, that to the innocent they seemed to beam only with humanity and
compassion. -- Her form was majestic, and in her manner was a mixture of
dignity, ease, and sweetness.

Mariana's countenance brightened up when she saw this lovely woman -- she
curtsied, and a faint blush tinged her cheeks --

You are the person who wrote this letter? asked her Ladyship.

Yes, Madam.

Pray, who was it that pretended to recommend you to me?

Mariana informed her.

Good God! cried Lady Allworth; I know nothing of the woman; I never applied to
her for a servant in my life; and should never have thought of applying to an
office for a governess.

Mariana turned pale, and with difficulty restrained her tears.

But pray, continued her Ladyship, pray, Ma'am, inform me how you came to apply
to an office: -- have you no friends?

But one, Madam, and she is not in a line to recommend me.

Poor girl! said Lady Allworth, softly -- she thought the exclamation of pity
too humiliating to be addressed to Mariana herself: it was an involuntary
motion of the lips dictated by a feeling heart.

Pray, sit down, Madam continued her Ladyship, and, if it is not disagreeable,
inform me how you came into such a place as London without friends: I feel
myself interested in your behalf, and if it is in my power I will serve you.

Mariana sat down, and with a voice of timidity, accompanied with a look of
gratitude, in a few words, acquainted Lady Allworth with her story.

My father, Madam, is an officer in the army; my mother dying while I was yet
an infant, my father married a lady in America, who brought him an ample
fortune -- he took me over to America when only eight years old, and we
remained there in the utmost harmony till the unhappy breach between Great
Britain and her Colonies. My father refusing to join the Americans, his
property was confiscated, and he returned with his family to England in a
distressed situation. -- We have been in England seven years; the family has
been sickly and expensive -- my poor father was involved in debt -- I could not
bear the idea of adding to his expenses I left my home, which is in the
country, and came to town to a distant relation, in hopes, by industry, to
obtain a living; this relation I have undesignedly offended; as also some who
were nearer allied -- my efforts to live by industry have failed, and I find
myself under the necessity of seeking a service -- I had flattered myself with
the hopes of being engaged in your Ladyship's family; but alas! I am
disappointed in all my undertakings.

Has the woman who pretended to recommend, got any money from you? said her
Ladyship.

Indeed, Madam, she has got all I had.

Lady Allworth drew forth her purse -- Mariana arose to take her leave.

Stop a moment, said Lady Allworth -- sit down again -- you must want some
refreshment.

A glass of wine and a biscuit was ordered.

Call on me again in a day or two, said her Ladyship; I will try to do
something for you; in the mean time accept of this trifle.

I could not see what she put into her hand; but I am sure it was the manner of
the giver, not the gift itself, that sunk so deep into Mariana's heart: it was
that which made her exclaim as she left the house -- Dear Lady, when I forget
my obligations to thee, may I cease to live.

Lady Allworth kept her word, and recommended Mariana to a Lady in whose family
she remained till ill health obliged her to quit it.

Ye fair daughters of Britain, whose charms are the theme of every tongue, the
admiration of every eye, and whose praise is sounded to the most distant
kingdoms, learn from the amiable behavior of a Lady Allworth, how to attain
those charms which neither time nor accident can diminish -- the beauties of
that Lady's person might have rendered her universally admired; but it is the
goodness of her heart alone that could create universal love and veneration.

THE FASHIONABLE FRIEND.
As I passed a house in the close of the evening, the window shutters being
open, I saw a woman sitting by a table, her cheek resting upon her left hand,
and a pen in her right -- she wrote -- then paused -- then wrote: it seemed to
be a subject that required reflection. A genteel young woman knocked at the
door -- I had time on my hands, so being rather curious to be present at a
female tete-a-tete, I put on my ring, and when the door was opened I entered
with the visitor.

She was hardly seated, before, observing the writing apparatus, she says, So
my dear Ellen, you are exercising your fertile genius -- you are certainly a
charming girl! -- what would I not give to possess such a talent -- pray, may I
see your performance, or will you be so obliging as to read it to me?

Ellen took up the paper, threw it on the window, and said, it was only a
sonnet not worth looking at --

Oh, you sad girl? how can you mortify me so? I am sure if the sonnet is the
production of your own genius it must be delightful -- pray do let me see it.

If it will give you any pleasure, said Ellen, I will read it to you; -- but, I
assure you, it is but a trifle -- she took it up and read --

From the day of my birth until now,
I Have still been accustomed to grief;
My mother she nursed me in woe,
Her sorrows admit no relief;
She lulled me to sleep with her sighs,
Tears mixed with the milk of her breast;
For often would they start in her eyes,
At the fight of an object distressed
To feel for another man's woes,
Is a blessing to British hearts given;
A blessing which pity bestows;
And pity's the daughter of heaven.
All nature rejoiced at her birth;
Humanity fostered the child;
And when she appeared upon earth,
Each virtue approvingly smiled.
Oh, it is divine! exclaimed the visitor, whose name I found was Greenham; --
pray, my dear Ellen, favor me with a copy of it.

Ellen promised to comply with her request.

I wonder, said Mrs. Greenham, why you don't publish your works; it is a
thousand pities such charming poems as you in general write, should be buried
in oblivion.

I sometimes, said Ellen, think I will lay some of my little productions before
the impartial public; but I am quite terrified at the idea of exposing myself
to the ridicule of my own sex, or the satire of the other. --

You are too humble, my sweet friend, cries Mrs. Greenham, there is not the
least occasion for your fears -- I am certain your works would be universally
read and admired; and it will be injustice both to yourself and the world, to
deprive them of the gratification of perusing them* and yourself of the fame
you would certainly acquire, and undoubtedly deserve.

It is rather surprising* thought I, that one woman should be so liberal in the
praises of another. -- I looked intently in Mrs. Greenham's face; and methought
I read dissimulation in every feature -- I took an attentive view of Ellen, and
plainly discovered that she saw through the thin veil of her visitor's
flattery; and though she could not but listen to her with silent civility, she,
in her heart, despised her envy and ill nature much less than the specious arts
with which she endeavored to cover them.

When Mrs. Greenham took her leave, I followed her, determined to hear in what
manner she spoke of Ellen, when absent from her. She went immediately home, and
entertained her husband and several visitors at the expense of the inoffensive
Ellen.

I found her, said she, scribbling as usual; I praised her extravagantly, and
advised her to publish her works -- she said she had some ^^ghts of it. I wish
she would to my heart, for I should like to see her heartily laughed at -- I am
sure women have no business with pens in their hands, they had better mend
their clothes, and look after their family.

And pray, why not, Madam, said an old gentleman, who had listened attentively
to this loquacious harangue, why may not a woman, if she has leisure and
genius, take up her pen to gratify both herself and friends. I am not ashamed
to acknowledge that I have perused the productions of some of our female pens,
with the highest satisfaction; and am happy when I find any woman has so large
a fund of amusement in her own mind. I never heard a woman, who was fond of her
pen, complain of the tediousness of time; nor, did I ever know such a woman
extravagantly fond of dress, public amusements, or expensive gaiety; yet, I
have seen many women of genius prove themselves excellent mothers, wives, and
daughters.

But, Sir, replied Mrs. Greenham, the Lady in question only fancies herself
possessed of genius; her writings are the most insipid things in nature.

If I could see some of them, said the old gentleman, I should be a better
judge.

Then you shall presently, for I expect she will come and spend an hour or two
with me this evening, when I can easily prevail with her to show you some of
her pretty scrawls.

Ellen soon after made her appearance. -- Mrs. Greenham received her with a
vast show of affection, and soon began a conversation which led to literary
productions.

I know of nobody so clever in this way, said she, as my little friend Ellen
here -- do, my dear, oblige the company by reciting some of your poems; or,
perhaps, you may have some in your pocket -- I know you always have a treasure
there.

Indeed Madam, said Ellen, I only write for amusement; nor can it be supposed
my performances have any merit worthy the attention of this company.

Oh, you are always so diffident --

It is a sure sign of merit, said the old gentleman, -- But, pray Madam,
addressing himself to Ellen, do you devote much of your time to your pen?

I am so situated, Sir, she replied, that I am unavoidably obliged to pass many
hours entirely by myself -- In the former part of my life I have been engaged
in many scenes, the remembrance of which, in these solitary hours, would be
extremely painful, were it not for the relaxation and amusement I find in the
exercise of my pen -- I have but few acquaintance, she continued, and even
those few might, by too frequent visits, grow tired of my company. I seldom go
out but I meet with some object to engage my attention; and often when
reflecting on the various scenes around me, I fall into a train of ideas which
I feel a sort of pleasure in committing to paper; and in general they serve to
occupy the next leisure or solitary hour.

And an excellent way of spending time too, replied the old gentleman. -- I am
certain, Madam, you are never less alone than when by yourself.

It is true, Sir, said she, I do find a great deal of entertainment from this
method of employing myself; but it is no reason for me to suppose, because I am
amused in writing, another person should be amused in reading what I have
written.

But, I do assure you, said Mrs. Greenham, it will give us all a great deal of
satisfaction to hear a little of your performance. -- Now do, Ellen, oblige us.

Ellen was of a temper that could not bear entreaties -- she had not power to
refuse a request made with any tolerable degree of sincerity and earnestness. I
am always in pain for people of this disposition; they often do things
absolutely disagreeable to themselves, because they have not strength of mind
to refuse peremptorily, but do it so faintly, and with such evident marks of
pain, that a second or third request always conquers.

I know a young man of this disposition who is intoxicated two or three times a
week, though he is not naturally addicted to inebriety, and in general suffers
exceedingly after it, merely because he cannot resist the earnest importunities
of his friends.

I know a woman too, who, whenever she goes into a shop, lays out twice as much
money as she intended, because the shopkeeper entreats her to have this, and
that is so vastly pretty, or amazingly cheap -- and she imperceptibly launches
into extravagancies which she afterward heartily repents. -- Now, though such
a pliability of temper may be extremely pleasing and agreeable in domestic
life, it exposes a person to a thousand inconveniences, improprieties, and
irregularities. I would have a man or woman maintain an opinion of their own;
and when resolved to refuse a request which they may judge imprudent or
improper to grant, refuse it with such steadiness and dignity as may at once
prevent their being teazed into an action which their reason revolts against.

But, this is by way of digression, so I beg pardon, and return.

Ellen, urged by the united requests of the company, and a little female vanity
which dwelt in her own bosom, at length complied, and recited in a graceful
manner, a short, pathetic tale, written in the elegiac style, and greatly in
the manner of Shenstone.

The old gentleman bestowed no praises on it, but he honored the recital with a
tear, and soon after left the company -- when the inoffensive Ellen became a
butt for the satire, ridicule, envy, and ill nature of those that remained, and
whose tongues had only been restrained by his presence. Yet Mrs. Greenham
professed an unbounded friendship for her, and declared there was nothing but
what she would freely do to serve her -- but she was a fashionable friend.

Friendship is a word universally used, but little understood; there are a
number of people who style themselves friends, who never knew what it was to
have an anxious thought for the person for whom they pretend this violent
friendship, in the female world in particular. I make no doubt but there are
numbers of women who, should they be informed whilst at cards, of the greatest
misfortune having befallen one of their most intimate friends, would cry, Poor
thing, I am vastly sorry -- I had a great regard for her -- and then inquire
what is trumps? or how gows the game? I can divide the world into five distinct
classes of friends, for there is hardly any one person breathing but boasts of
feeling that exalted attachment for some one or other of their fellow mortals.
-- Among the men, is the professing friend and insidious friend; among the
women, the ostentatious, and the envious friend; and a small parcel may be
culled of both sexes and set under the denomination of real friends.

THE PROFESSING FRIEND.
I WILL try him, however, said Lavinia, wiping her eyes, for I have often heard
him say he valued my dear Ferdinand above all other men -- and sure he will not
let him languish in a prison for the want of such a trifle, and which we can so
soon repay.

It was a day or two after I was in possession of my ring. -- I had stepped
into a shop to buy a pair of gloves, when a young woman behind the counter
addressed these words to her companion.

You may try him, Lavinia, said her companion, but I do not think you will
succeed; beside, my dear, your circumstances are not so bad as to lead you to
fear your husband's confinement.

They are worse than you imagine, Eliza, said she; we have, besides this bill,
several more to pay, which we are equally unable to provide for. -- Mr. Woudbe
has professed the warmest friendship for my husband, I think he will be glad of
the opportunity to convince him it was not merely professional.

I had by this time purchased my gloves; and being anxious to know how Lavinia
would succeed in her undertaking, I just left the shop, put on my ring, and
returned.

Lavinia had left the shop, and was in the parlour. A person came in, who, from
his appearance, I should have supposed a man of fashion; yet, I knew him to be
a mechanic -- his affected air and gait spoke him a finished coxcomb -- it was
the identical Mr. Woudbe; he asked for her husband; he was not at home -- he
sat down, fell into conversation, frequently intimated his servant wishes for
their prosperity, and declared he desired nothing more than an opportunity to
convince his worthy friend Ferdinand how much he had his interest and happiness
at heart.

Lavinia's eyes beamed pleasure and gratitude; she thought it a favorable,
golden opportunity -- she told him her husband's circumstances were
embarrassed, but the loan of eighty or an hundred pounds would set them quite
at ease; and they should by industry and economy soon be enabled to repay it.

She pleaded with the most persuasive eloquence; love animated her countenance;
an anxious tear glittered in her eye -- but the professing Mr. Woudbe had none
of the finer feelings which dignify the man; he loved ostentation, show and
grandeur; but he had no idea of any pleasure in life superior to that he felt
when dressed in a finer coat than his neighbor. -- Two guineas was not too
much for a ticket for a ball, but a shilling was extravagantly thrown away in
relieving the wants of a distressed fellow creature.

To such a man, the tearful eye, the anxious countenance, alternately red and
pale, the trembling frame, and struggling sign of Lavinia, pleaded in vain; he
heard her with indifference; he consoled her in language in which was an equal
mixture of pity and contempt; and I was informed, by a person who knew him,
that it was the last visit he ever paid his friend Ferdinand.

This is a sort of friend which the world swarms with -- professions cost
nothing -- give me the man, whose heart, alive to every dictate of humanity,
stays not till he is asked to do a favor, but eagerly seeks out opportunities
to render service to mankind.

Anxious for the fate of Lavinia, a short time after, I made another invisible
visit -- when I entered the house, every thing was in confusion; and Lavinia
herself looked like Melancholy musing on a scene of woe. I was casting in my
own mind, fifty different plans to find out the real cause of her distress,
and, if possible, relieve it, without hurting her feelings, by letting her know
that her necessities were discovered by a stranger, when a little man entered
the house, whose features, however plain, and, to the generality of the world,
uninteresting, immediately prepossessed me in his favor.

Lavinia, said he, I hear you are moving, and am come to see if I can be of any
service to you -- where is your husband?

A gush of tears was all she could answer.

Dear girl, do not weep, said he -- is it pecuniary matters that distress you?
speak, Lavinia; will twenty or thirty guineas be of any service to you?

She hesitated; but at last confessed that they were greatly distressed for
money; and that her husband was obliged to keep out of the way of his creditors.

I will be with you again in a few moments, said he, darting out of the house.

I waited his return.

In less than half an hour he came back, and put a sum of money into Lavinia's
hand, which entirely calmed her fears.

Oh! Sir, said she, how shall I ever return this obligation?

By never mentioning it, he replied* let me beg it may be buried in oblivion --
I shall be offended if ever I hear it talked of -- it gives me pleasure that I
had it in my power to serve so worthy a man as your husband, and restore
tranquillity to two hearts which were formed for love and domestic happiness.

He shook her hand cordially, and left her.

How does thy humility exalt thee, my generous friend, said Lavinia, when he
was gone; but actions like thine cannot be hid; it would be an injury to
mankind, to conceal them -- yet it is not an action to be blazoned from the
trump of common fame; but gratitude shall snatch a gentler clarion, and tell
thy virtues to the listening few, who know how to admire and imitate them.

I left her with a heart at ease.

It was the close of the evening -- passing through a public street, I heard
the sound of music, and saw a room, in an house of entertainment, elegantly
illuminated -- I took the advantage of my ring, and went in -- It was an
entertainment given at the expense of Mr. Woudbe -- the kind, the friendly, Mr.
Woudbe, was lavishing in folly and dissipation, a sum, which might have
lightened the hearts of the miserable, and dried the tear of despondency -- But
he could not show his taste in giving or lending money -- he could display his
elegant fancy by spending it on trifles, or, in reality, throwing it away.

THE ATTORNEY.
YOU must not lose a moment, Sir, said a footman, addressing a man in the
coffee room, whom I knew to be an attorney -- You must make all possible haste,
for my master cannot live three hours.

The attorney was a tall, meagre man; had a great deal of servile politeness
and outward sanctity in his manner; yet there was an under designing cast with
his eyes, which made me suspect the integrity of his heart.

He is going to make a will, said I -- perhaps some rich, old miser is at the
point of death, and is willing to dispose of his hoards in the best manner he
can -- I will accompany the attorney.

We were sat down at the door of an handsome house, and I followed Mr. Vellum
unseen into the chamber of the sick man.

He appeared to be between the age of forty and fifty; his looks were
venerable, but his features were marked by the hand of death -- behind his
pillow, supporting his head, sat a lovely girl about fourteen years old, who
while she* with her hand, wiped away the sweat which stood upon the forehead of
the dying man, bedewed it again with her tears -- At the foot of the bed stood
a youth something older than the girl; he leaned against the supporter of the
bed* the curtain partly hid his face, but the part which was exposed to view,
spoke filial love, anxiety and sorrow.

My good friend, Mr. Vellum, said the sick man, feebly stretching out his hand,
I am glad you are come: I feel the springs of life almost worn out, and I wish
to settle my worldly affairs, that my dear Julietta and Horace may have no
trouble from my relations.

You know, Mr. Vellum, I married their mother contrary to the inclination of my
father, and, on that account, at his decease, found myself possessed of but a
small patrimony: willing to provide, not only for the present moment, but also
for futurity, I entered into partnership with an eminent merchant, and my
success being beyond my hopes, I not only lived in affluence, but am enabled to
leave my beloved children sufficient to place them above temptation, and give
them the exalted pleasure of administering to the necessities of their fellow
creatures -- I have experienced so much malignity and envy from my own
relations, that I think them by no means fit guardians for my children. My wife
was poor, and an orphan; she had many relations, but no friends. Those who will
no befriend a desolate orphan, are not proper people to be entrusted with the
care and management of young, volatile minds -- You, my friend, have a son
about the age of Horace; and a daughter some years older than Julietta; they
will be fit companions for each other. I do not think my children can be
happier than under your guardianship and protection -- I have in the funds
thirty thousand pounds -- I desire you will divide it equally between my
children; and, in case of their dying without issue, it shall devolve to you
and yours -- I shall leave you other testimonies of my regard, and a few
legacies to my servants -- pray be quick, I am hastening toward my end --

Mr. Vellum wrote the will, the old gentleman signed it, and two of the
servants witnessed it.

Mr. Vellum seemed greatly affected, professed much esteem for the lovely
children, and declared the whole study of his life should be to make them happy
-- he embraced, and pretended to weep over his friend* but methought there was
more of joy than sorrow in his tears -- The will in his possession gave him
greater satisfaction, than the death of his friend gave him pain.

THE DEPARTURE.
THE old gentleman desired to be left to himself a few moments, the attorney
and the children withdrew -- he offered up some pious ejaculations, requesting
the blessings so abundently shower'd on himself might be continued to his
children; his heart overflowed with gratitude for the many mercies he had
enjoyed; he petitioned health and prosperity, for his friends, penitence and
pardon, for his enemies, and finished his prayer by fervently recommending his
soul to the mercy of that Being who had guided and supported him through life.
This essential duty finished, he again called for his children.

My dear Horace and Julietta, said he, I am summoned from you; early, my
children, you are bereft of the love, attention, and advice of a parent, who
had no other regard for life than as it contributed to your happiness -- I have
but one precept I wish to inculcate and impress upon your minds: deal by all
mankind as you wish and expect them to deal by you; let nothing, my children,
alienate your affections from each other; and remember to respect your brother
and sister mortals, not according to the homage which the mistaken world may
think due to wealth and grandeur, but according to their own intrinsic worth
and merit.

Horace, respect virtue wherever you find it; nor dare on any account use the
wealth of which Heaven has appointed you steward, to corrupt integrity, or
pervert innocence; shun the society of the licentious though dignified with
titles; regard not the scoffs of the libertine, but preserve unshaken your
integrity to God and man.

Julietta, my beloved girl, fly from the voice of adulation; beware of
insidious villains, who spread their spacious snares for youth and innocence;
guard with unceasing vigilance your honor and your fame; yet, my dear girl,
exult not in the pride of your own virtue, nor triumph over the wretched fallen
of your sex; be uniformly good; be innocent yourself but pity and lament the
misery of those who have forfeited that inestimable jewel; pour the balm of
comfort into their bleeding hearts, and learn from their errors to rectify your
own.

Oh, I am going -- one more embrace -- Almighty Father bless -- bless my --
Children, he would have said, but the ghastly monarch sealed up his lips for
ever.

Oh! take me with you, dear saint, cried Julietta, wildly clasping her hands --
she threw herself on the bed and fainted.

The grief of Horace was manly, but expressive -- the tears rolled down his
cheeks -- he walked about the room in silent agony -- till seeing his sister's
situation, he forgot his own sorrows, and endeavored to revive and comfort her.

THE ORPHANS.
LOVELY children, said I, as I left the house, you are now launched into a
world full of temptations to vice, which will approach you under the
fascinating form of pleasure. -- May you avoid the rocks and quick sands on
which so many youths of both sexes are wrecked.

I do not like Mr. Vellum, said I, making a quick transition from the orphans
to the guardian. -- I wish he may discharge his trust faithfully.

Hang this suspicion, continued I, it is an uncharitable, unchristian-like
thing that has crept into my mind under the shape of anxiety for the welfare of
these poor orphans. -- There Is another foolish idea now; how is it possible a
person can be poor who has fifty thousand pounds to their fortune; it may seem
an inexplicable riddle to the narrow minded race of mortals who place the
summum bonum of sublunary happiness in an ostentatious display of wealth and
grandeur: but I can assure them a person possessed of fifty times that sum, may
be poor and so poor as to be miserable.

Impossible, exclaims pretty Miss Diddy, the tradesman's daughter, who just
returned from boarding school, is informed by mamma that she is to have five
thousand pounds for her fortune.

Impossible, had I ten more added to that five, I should be the happiest mortal
breathing -- and it is quite out of the question to think of ever being poor
again.

A well-a-day, said I, it is a strange thing; but, to me, poverty of ideas and
meanness of spirit are greater afflictions than poverty of purse and meanness
of birth.

When a man is alone, and in a thinking mood, his imagination insensibly runs
from one thing to another, till he entirely wanders from the subject that first
engaged his attention.

Now, this being my case, I had got into such a train of thought on the various
kinds of poverty with which the world is infested, that it was with difficulty
I brought my mind back to Horace and Julietta; and, when I did, that devilish
suspicion of their guardian's integrity would creep along with them.

Pshaw, said I, what business have I to suspect a man of baseness, to which,
perhaps, he may be an entire stranger. I declare* week mortal as I am, I find
sufficient employ in correcting my own errors, without searching out the errors
of others.

I endeavored to give my thoughts another turn, but in vain, they
involuntarily turned back to the orphans, and I wandered on, musing on the
uncertainty of their future happiness.

THE GIRL OF THE TOWN.
FOR ever cursed be that detested place, said a wretched daughter of folly, as
she passed a tavern in Holborn; and for ever execrated be that night, on which
I first entered it.

She caught my hand as I passed her.

Give me a glass of wine, said she.

The watch had just gone ten.

I looked in her face -- she was pretty; and I thought her features were not of
the sort which never express shame; her eyes were cast down -- I thought I saw
a tear steal from them -- I touched her cheek, it was wet, ye she forced a
smile -- I took hold of her hand, it was cold, it trembled.

My compassion was strongly excited -- by an involuntary motion, I drew her
hand under my arm, and walked on in silence till we came to another house of
entertainment. -- I then gave her something to procure refreshment, and bade
her good night.

Then you will not go in with me, said she, in tremulous accents.

I must not, said I, I have a wife.

Go then, said she, letting go my arm. Yet, I thought I had found a friend, and
would have told you such a tale -- but, no matter -- I am wretched -- I have
made others so -- I will not sin against conviction. While this lasts, said
she, I will live unpolluted -- when it is gone, I must either starve or sin
again.

Now let the icy sons of philosophy say what they please. I could no more have
left this poor girl, after such a declaration, than I could travel barefoot
over the burning deserts of Arabia. -- So, without once asking the advice of
Madam Prudence, or suffering Suspicion to hint, that her affliction might be
assumed -- I again took hold of her hand, and we entered the house together.

And now for your tale, my poor afflicted, said I, after she had eaten an
hearty supper of cold* veal and sallad.

To engage your friendship, Sir, said she, I must be open and candid, and often
condemn myself -- I know I stand convicted before the world; but the world sees
not the heart. -- Credulity was my fault; a vile platonic system, my ruin.

Yet, had I been ruined alone, it were but little consequence; but, alas! I
have involved others in misery -- I have sown thorns on the conjugal pillow of
a worthy woman -- I have torn the heart of a parent with all the dreadful pangs
an injured wife, a doting mother, can feel, who sees the husband of her
affections, the father of her children, eagerly pursuing, and encouraged in a
guilty passion.

Gracious God, cried she, clasping her hands, let my sorrows, my miseries, my
unfeigned penitence, expiate this fault, and for the rest, thy will be done.

I know not how it was; but, though she so strongly accused herself, and of
such heinous offenses, for my soul I could not but pity her; and so did my Emma
too, when I told her the tale; so I bade her be comforted, and I would serve
her in every thing that lay in my power --

But, to the tale --

You shall have it directly, good ladies -- I know you love a little private
history.

Mercy on me! cried Miss Autumn, what sort of a story are we to have now? the
history of a filthy creature, who lived with another woman's husband, and then
turned street-walker?

Even so, dear Madam; and if your immaculate modesty will be too much shocked
at the recital in public, double down the page, take it up in your chamber, and
read it when you are alone; it will save you the trouble of a blush --

And do you think, Mr. Inquisitor, that your works will be proper for the
perusal of youth?

I hope so, Madam; Heaven forbid that I should ever write a page, whose
tendency might make me blush to own it, or in my latest hour, wish to blot it
out -- my narrative is calculated to inspire at once pity and horror --

Pity! good Lord -- I never heard the like -- pity for an abandoned hussy, who
merits the most flagrant punishment?

You Will pardon me, Madam, If I differ from you in opinion -- I would have every
woman to feel a proper horror and detestation of the crimes this unhappy girl
has committed; but, at the same time, pity the weakness that led into them, and
the miseries the commission of them has entailed upon her.

I have no patience, Sir; I insist upon it, that the breach of chastity in
woman deserves the most rigorous punishment.

Unfeeling woman! if thou art really virtuous thyself, boast not thy
superiority over thy afflicted, fallen sisters; but retire to thy closet, and
thank thy Creator, that he gave thee not a form that might lead thee into
temptations, or endued thee with fortitude to withstand them --

But now for Annie's story. --

THE INQUISITOR, etc.
ANNIE's STORY.
IT was on a fine evening, the latter end of May, when tired with the fatigues
of the day, for she was a milliner's apprentice, Annie obtained leave of her
mistress to walk out for a little air. -- Her mistress had a shop which she
occupied, and frequently visited during the summer season, situated on the
banks of the Thames.

Annie strayed toward the water side. Some venerable trees grew on the banks,
forming a covert from the sun at noon; and, by their interwoven branches,
inspired a sort of pleasing melancholy in the gray twilight of the evening.

Annie was a sentimental girl -- she loved solitude, poetry, and music. -- With
a mind softened by the remembrance of some former occurrences of her life, and
spirits calmed, but not depressed, by the solemn silence and serenity of every
thing around her, she wandered on meditating on the happy state of those who
were in a situation to enjoy unmolested the darling pleasures of reading,
meditation, and friendship.

Whether love had any share in her thoughts at that moment, I never could get
her to confess -- but, whether a sentimental young woman, wandering in a
solitary walk, and contemplating the works of nature, might not naturally
enough wish for a bosom friend to participate in her pleasures, and join in an
innocent conversation, I leave to my fair readers to determine -- to be sure,
she might wish for a female companion; very likely she did; but it is a point I
never could determine.

In this shady walk Annie was accosted by Mr. Winlove.

Mr. Winlove was a gentleman of fortune, to whose family Annie had been
recommended by a particular friend as an innocent, well-disposed girl. -- She
frequently visited Mrs. Winlove -- she had received numberless civilities from
her husband -- there could be no harm in walking two or three turns with a
married man -- she accepted his proferred arm, and they proceeded together.

I had been wishing for an agreeable companion in this walk, Annie, said he.

Why did you not bring Mrs. Winlove with you?

It Is a natural question; Annie, but a wife is not always the most agreeable
companion. I am much better pleased with your company than I should be with
hers.

Annie had been brought up in the strictest principles of virtue; she had
likewise imbibed some strange, obsolete notions concerning honor, piety,
integrity, and the like. She, therefore, thought it strange that a man should
prefer the company of an indifferent person, to that of the woman to whom he
had vowed eternal love and constancy.

How can you talk so inconsistently, Mr. Winlove? said she; surely my company
cannot be preferable to that of the woman of your choice.

Do people never marry from any other motives than inclination?

I have heard, indeed, said Annie, of marriages of interest, where avarice, not
love, lighted the hymeneal torch; but I have too good an opinion of Mr. Winlove
to think he could be biassed by so sordid a motive.

How I am delighted to find that you entertain so high an opinion of me, my
dear creature; and yet it pains me.

Oh, why am I denied the power of bestowing myself and fortune on a woman every
way so amiable.

Annie was going to interrupt him, but he stopped her, and proceeded. --

Be not offended, my sweet angel, you have no idea of the miseries of my
situation; drawn into a cursed connection with a woman who has neither beauty,
merit, nor accomplishments to render her a desirable companion -- a woman for
whom I have not the least tenderness, and whom I married from a mistaken point
of honor -- unhappy wretch that I am, I must now daily see you, charming Annie,
lovely, amiable, accomplished, yet obliged to earn a subsistence, when nature
formed you to move in a sphere more exalted, more suited to your gentle
disposition. -- These hands, dear girl, were not formed for labor -- he took
one hand and pressed it tenderly to his lips.

Now, however Annie might be inclined to reprove Mr. Winlove in the beginning
of this address, the latter part of it was so prettily mixed with praises of
herself, that she could not well determine whether to be pleased or offended --
she therefore continued silent.

Annie was the daughter of a merchant; had been well educated; and being
supposed to have a large fortune, was early introduced into the school of
gallantry, and her ears invaded by the voice of adulation -- she was pretty --
how could she avoid knowing it? she had heard an hundred different men swear
it; her glass confirmed their oaths. -- She was naturally sensible; but she was
vain, and a little inclined to coquetry. -- Her father died insolvent -- she
was taken from a scene of grandeur, and apprenticed to a milliner. -- She was
good-natured, every body loved her -- she submitted to her fate without
repining, and endeavored to render herself useful in her new occupation. But,
alas! poor Annie, she loved the soft numbers of a Dryden or a Pope, much better
than the study of the fashions; and would prefer spending an hour at her pen,
before the formation of the most elegant ornament for the person.

It is not to be wondered at, that she was delighted by the voice of flattery,
since she had seldom, from her cradle, been accustomed to any other.

Mr. Winlove was artful; he easily discovered the method by which he might gain
the good will of this simple girl; and imperceptibly changed the subject, from
admiring the beauties of her person, to commend the graces of her mind. -- He
then inquired into the nature of her studies; commended her taste in the
selection of authors; ventured gently to laugh at her ideas of religion; called
them superstitious; said she was a novice in the ways of the world, and openly
avowed a passion for her.

At first her looks plainly indicated her horror and amazement -- She trembled
-- shrunk from him* and telling him she was shocked to find the person she had
supposed her friend, was her bitterest enemy, burst into tears.

Had Annie acted with propriety, she would have instantly left him; but he
attempted to palliate his offense -- she staid to hear him.

How can you call me your enemy, dear Annie, said he -- though I dote on you
almost to madness, I would not injure you to obtain an empire. I will curb my
passion; it shall be pure, exalted friendship that warms our bosoms; we may be
friends, my sweet girl; you cannot refuse me that token of your esteem.

Let your actions teach me to esteem you, Mr. Winlove -- I will be the friend
of no man who pretends to laugh at all obligations, moral and religious.

Mr. Winlove, by degrees, led her into a dispute -- Annie was not a match in
argument with this insidious friend; he was a sophist; he preferred the laws of
nature; called religion priestcraft; brought innumerable proofs to convince her
that her opinion was fallacious, and that she was entirely ignorant of the road
to happiness, if she supposed it was to be found by strictly adhering to the
musty rules prescribed by the aged and captious, who, unable any longer to
enjoy the pleasures of youth, would deprive others of their share.

Take example, dear Annie, said he, from the excellent Eloise, of Rousseau.

She had never read it.

He recommended it very strongly for her perusal.

As she returned home, passing a library, Mr. Winlove purchased the pernicious
novel, and gave it to Annie.

She took it home -- she read it -- her judgment was perverted -- she believed
in the reality of a platonic passion -- she thought she had the virtue of an
Eloise, and Mr. Winlove the honor of a St. Preux.

Churchill was the next author that was recommended.

She read -- she listened to the soft language of love, and imbibed pernicious
poison from every page she read, and every word she heard.

Trusting to her own strength and ^^^tue, she made a private assignation -- met
him -- confessed she loved him -- and was lost.

But little now remains to be told.

A few months convinced her, that when honor is forfeited, love cannot exist.

Mr. Winlove forsook her.

Her reputation stained -- without friends -- without peace -- despised and
insulted by her own sex, pitied by the other, and renounced by her uncle, who
had bound her apprentice, she became the associate of the abandoned and
profligate; and reduced to choose the dreadful alternative of death or infamy,
became a partner in vices which once she would have shuddered but to think on.

LOVE.
AND this man pleaded love as an incitement to the ruin of the poor, simple
Annie.

What is love?

It is a question which would be answered different ways, according to the age
and situation of the person to whom it is addressed -- Love! cries the lovely
girl, whose imagination is warmed by the perusal of a sentimental novel -- love
is the cordial drop Heaven has thrown in, to sweeten the bitter draught of life
-- without love we can only exist -- sweet soother of our cares! that can strew
roses on the coarsest bed, and make the most homely fair delicious. -- Give me
love and Strephon, an humble cottage shaded with woodbine; for love will render
the retreat delightful!

Charmed with the enchanting scene her busy fancy draws, she imagines happiness
exists only in a cottage; and that for the love of her dear Strephon, she could
easily, and without regret, forego all the indulgencies of her father's house;
all the advantages of wealth, and solace herself with a brown crust and a
pitcher of milk. But then her Strephon will always be near her, ever whispering
his love, and studying to promote her felicity: fired with these romantic
ideas, she takes the first opportunity of quitting her home; and without a
moment's deliberation, throws herself upon the honor of a man, who perhaps, had
no further regard for her than the hope of sharing her fortune might excite.

Ask this same woman, some few months after, when poverty has visited her
dwelling, and unmaskthe real designs of her husband, ask her then what love is
-- her answer will be, it is a foolish, headstrong passion, whose pleasures
exist merely in imagination; a blind hood-winked deity, who leads on his
votaries by promises of everlasting felicity; and when two late for retreat,
discovers his real aspect, and plunges them into inevitable misery. -- Yet this
woman's ideas of love were both erroneous -- the reason of which was, she had
never really felt the effects of that exalted passion.

Ask the libertine what is love?

Innocence trembles at his answer; religion and virtue replies, it is ruin,
infamy and shame.

The old, avaricious, captious wretch will tell you, there is no such thing as
love that it never existed but in romances* plays, and novels.

Then pray, Mr. Inquisitor, what is your opinion of love?

THE ANSWER.
REAL love was born of beauty, nursed by Innocence, and its life prolonged by
good sense, affability and prudence -- it consists of a strict union of soul
and parity of sentiment between two persons of different sexes -- its constant
attendants are honor, integrity, candor, humility, good nature, and
cheerfulness.

A passion of this kind elevates the soul* and inspires it with fortitude to
bear the various vicissitudes of life of without complaining -- from such a
passion proceeds all the endearing ties of nature -- Father, brother, husband,
wife, mother, daughter; names, the very sound of which will make every fiber of
the heart vibrate with pleasure.

What noble, praiseworthy actions have men performed when animated by the
esteem and love of a deserving object; even women have forgot the weakness of
their sex, and suffered hardships, combated perils, and braved even the threats
of war, for* the sake of a beloved husband. -- It opens the heart to all the
gentle virtues which ornament society -- the heart susceptible of love is never
callous to the feelings of humanity; he never beholds a distressed object but
he immediately wishes to relieve it, not that he feels so much for the person's
suffering as for those who may suffer with or for their distress, such as a
wife, husband, or parent. -- It is a passion which, when inspired by virtue,
and guided by religion and reason, dignifies mankind -- a passion which
ornaments the highest station, and adds new luster even to the British diadem.

Illustrious pair! whose every action tends to point the way to real happiness;
long, long may you reign the pride and blessing of your people -- May your
bright example spread throughout the kingdom, till Hymen led by Love and Honor,
shall reign triumphant over the British nation.

It is very extraordinary, but I never can finish with the subject I begin upon
-- I began a definition of Love, and I ramble immediately to the King and
Queen; and how was it possible I could do otherwise when love and harmony was
the theme.

My fair country-woman, you whose hearts are formed by nature open to every
gentle, generous sentiment, beware of Love -- there are many deceivers who
assume his appearance, and steal unsuspected into the heart; but of all the
various shapes it assumes, none is so much to be dreaded as the spacious mask
of friendship. -- There has been more women lost through platonic love than any
other; and the reason is, they are thrown entirely off their guard, and have
not the least doubt of the strength of their own virtue, or their lover's
honor, till both are forfeited past redemption.

But all this is digressing from Annie's story.

THE SEQUEL.
WHEN she had finished her relation, I took her into a hackney-coach, and
conveyed her home -- heartily told my dear Emma the circumstance of our
meeting, and asked her advice in what manner to dispose of the poor girl.

We tried her penitence; found it sincere; and willing to encourage her in
virtue, recommended her to the service of a lady, whose example confirmed those
sentiments which were newly returning to be inmates of Annie's bosom.

I have frequently seen her since, and experience a thousand times more
satisfaction in the reflection that I have snatched her from infamy, than the
man of pleasure can feel, who raises the object of his guilty pursuit from the
lowest station, to affluence and grandeur.

That is but a bad comparison neither; the two actions cannot come is
competition with each other, since the first elevates human nature, the latter
debases it.

THE JOURNEY.
I HAVE often been surprised to find that persons who are possessed of elegant
villas, and are at liberty to dispose of their time as they think proper,
should prefer spending it in London. For my own part, I should hardly pass one
month of the twelve in that seat of commerce and bustle, were it not for
unavoidable obligations.

I find the purest pleasures arise from a walk in a pleasant meadow, hedged
round with hawthorn, in a sweet May morning, when the lark attunes her early
song, and chaunts forth the praises of her Creator; to see bright Phoebus leave
his watery bed, and kiss away Aurora's pearly tears, which hang upon the
opening flowers.

Drive on, said I to the postillion, I long to be at my journey's end, and I
must positively dine at Friendly Hall today.

Pray, your honor, give me some halfpence, said a boy that ran out of a
cottage as the carriage passed.

He was an arch-looking boy, with curly hair, very decently dressed, and ran
along by the side of the carriage with surprising agility. -- I threw him out
some halfpence; and looking out of the window to observe him pick them up, I
saw a young man, who had greatly the appearance of a gentleman, eagerly take
the money from the child, and go into the cottage.

I had scarcely mentioned the circumstance to my Emma, before the postillion
driving carelessly over a heap of stones, one of the wheels gave way, and down
came the coach.

At another time, I should undoubtedly have sworn at the postillion, and thrown
myself into a violent passion, from which I might not have recovered the whole
day. -- At present, as there was no harm done, the accident only coincided with
my wishes, which led me toward the cottage; so helping my Emma out, and taking
Harriet in one hand and Lucy in the other, we walked into the humble habitation.

THE COTTAGERS.
THE young man was seated by a woman, whose face had never been remarkable for
beauty, but was irresistibly charming, overshadowed by melancholy, and adorned
by sensibility. -- Her fine auburn hair she had endeavored to confine under a
small lawn cap, but it had broke from its bandage, and played in wanton
ringlets round her face.

A child about three months old was at her breast, and the boy, to whom I had
given the halfpence, was making boats with bits of wood, and swimming them in
a pail of water that stood in a corner of the room.

As we entered, the young man glanced his eyes upon his clothes; his cheeks
assumed a sanguine hue. -- They certainly were threadbare; but what of that?
they had once been new, and from what remained, we could see they had once been
elegant; perhaps it was that very circumstance which distressed him.

Whatever circumstances a person is in, you may always discover by their
behavior, whether they have been inured to their situation from childhood. --
A person, who has never known any thing but poverty, shows no other mark of
chagrin at the entrance of a stranger, than what proceeds from an aukwardness
of manner, which they ever betray, when in the company of their superiors --
and raise that person to the most exalted station, and you will still perceive
the same disgusting aukwardness and rusticity. -- So, place a man of education
in ever so obscure a situation, you will always discover the manners of the
gentleman, though obscured by the garb of the beggar.

I, therefore, no sooner beheld the young man, than I discovered that he had
not always worn a thread bare coat, or lived from his childhood in a cottage.

THE EMBARRASSMENT.
I AM hungry, mamma, said Harriet.

Could you procure us a little bread and milk, said I to the young woman.

We have none in the house, Sir, she replied, visibly embarrassed; and it is
above two miles to another cottage.

The young man turned pale as ashes.

Give me my money, mother, said the boy, and I will go and buy some.

She hesitated, and the boy proceeded.

I think it is time we had some breakfast -- I am sure I am hungry -- and so
are you -- I heard you say so, or I should not have begged of the gentlefolks.

He will discover our poverty, said the father, forcing a smile. -- The mother
turned from us, and wept.

Pardon me, Madam, said Emma, if I ask the cause of your tears -- it is not
curiosity, but a wish to serve you, occasions the question.

Pride and poverty, replied the young man, struggling to suppress his emotions.

Will this relieve you, said I, offering him a few guineas. --

Though I am almost starving, said he, I feel more anguish than satisfaction at
the offer; nor would I accept it, but for my wife and children.

It is extraordinary that there is such an innate pride implanted in the mind
of some men that they are ashamed of poverty, though it was entailed upon them
by unavoidable misfortunes, and I am certain that people of this cast, in
receiving favors, though perhaps those favors raise them from a state of
penury to plenty, feel a larger share of pain than pleasure -- the noble mind
is always pained when laboring under the weight of obligations.

Now, shame upon the world for occasioning this -- were it not that there is
greater respect paid to the gilded equipage, glaring liveries, and embroidered
clothes, than to the poor atom of clay that is attended by all this pomp, a man
would never blush at poverty when it was attended by honor and virtue.

I do not mean hereditary honor, I mean a nobleness of soul, an elevation of
sentiment, an integrity of heart, that would rather bear the laugh of the world
for keeping within the strict rules of economy than suffer a tradesman's bill
to go unpaid, or a fellow creature to want sustenance.

A man of real honor will not always draw his sword at every trivial offense;
but he ever stands forth the undaunted champion of innocence and virtue -- he
also holds his friend's wife or daughter as sacred, regards them with esteem,
and treats them with respect.

The modern man of honor is quite a different creature; he must have his
pleasures whether he can afford to pay for them or not; he will steal his
friend's fortune at the gaming table; debauch his wife, or ensnare his
daughter, and then run him through the body by way of reparation.

And, what is hereditary honor? -- A word of pompous sound -- a toy -- a
plaything -- a pretty bauble for children of twenty, thirty, aye, up to an
hundred years of age.

I have seen those great babies as pleased with enumerating the titles of their
ancestors, as an infant has been with a new rattle, or a jack in the box.

Sir, my forefathers were Earls, or Dukes, or Princes. -- Sir, I have noble
blood in my veins, which has flowed uncontaminated through twenty generations.

Yes, Sir, but your ancestors were cruel, or unjust, or ambitious, or
avaricious, or proud, or revengeful. -- But they were Earls, or Dukes, or
Princes. -- That is the convincing argument; and my Lord sits down perfectly
contented with the reflection that he is right honorable by birth, and never
gives himself the trouble to perform one honorable action during the whole
course of his life.

And, pray what has this to do with the cottagers.

Faith I don't know that it has the least connection with them; but I never can
prescribe rules for my pen, any more than I can confine my thoughts to one
single object. -- To write straight forward, is like an hackney horse that,
setting out from the first stage, continues in the beaten track till he arrives
at the end of his journey -- for my part I hate such insipid traveling; mine
is a journey of pleasure, and I will turn out of the road as often as I please
to take a view of any thing amusing or entertaining.

THE STEWARD.
THE young man went out and procured some refreshment, of which we partook,
and, after the repast was finished, the wife prepared to give us her own and
husband's history. --

She laid her infant to sleep, set her apartment in proper order; and, having
set a mug of cider (which her husband had brought in) upon the table, sat down
to gratify the curiosity she had so strongly excited. --

At that instant a fat old man rode up to the door, dismounted, fastened his
horse to a tree, and entered.

I never cast my eye upon a stranger but I immediately form some idea of his or
her dispositions by the turn of their eyes and cast of their features; and
though my skill in physiognomy is not infallible, I seldom find myself deceived.

The old man had a sort of haughtiness in his carriage, which seemed the result
of mean pride and self-sufficiency* his person was coarse, his manner rude, his
language almost insulting.

I am surprised, said he to the young man, that you have not brought me your
last half year's rent -- I have repeatedly sent, and will no longer be put off
by your trifling excuses -- I am now come for the money, and will not depart
without it.

Sir, said the young man, we have it not; and to add to our misfortunes, two
days since our cattle were seized for a small sum which we owed in the
neighborhood. --

Money I want, and money I will have, said the man -- a large sum is to be made
up this week, and I will not wait any longer -- if you do not send me the rent
within two days, I will turn you out of the cottage, first seizing what stock
you have.

Confound this money, said I, it is the occasion of more ill will and
dissension than any thing else in the world.

Why, pray, young man, said he, what would you do without money?

I was dressed very plainly -- so was Emma and the children -- he had not seen
the carriage that was repairing; or if he had, could never have supposed it was
mine.

He addressed me, therefore, by this familiar epithet, on account of his
supposed superiority; and as he pronounced the words young man, he assumed such
an air of self-sufficiency, and sat himself back in the chair with such an
insulting assurance, that I had hardly patience to answer him calmly.

If there was no money in the world* said I, there would be no extortion; and,
I fancy then, you, my good friend, would find but little employment.

One of my servants then informed me that the carriage was ready -- I enquired
of my young host if this was his landlord, and was informed he was only steward
to Lord M --: I became answerable for the rent, and determined, on my return to
town, to pay a visit to his Lordship, and inform him of the necessitous
situation of his tenants.

THE AUTHOR.
ONE evening, as I was rambling out, I observed a man sitting on the trunk of
an old tree, with a paper and pencil in his hand; at first I supposed him to be
drawing, but, on a nearer approach, I found him to be writing.

Pray, Sir, said I, advancing, and paying him the compliments of the evening,
what may be the subject which so agreeably engages your attention? I presume
you are sacrificing at the shrine of the Muses -- I am, Sir, said he, rising
and putting the paper in his pocket -- I have been writing all this summer, and
in the winter I hope to have my works in print -- It is a novel, Sir, entirely
calculated to amuse --

In how many volumes?

Two.

And are you sure of selling them?

I am engaged, Sir, to write for a person who scarcely ever publishes any thing
but novels.

What may be the plot or foundation of your novel?

It is called Annabella; or Suffering Innocence -- my heroine is beautiful,
accomplished, and rich; an only child, and surrounded by admirers -- she
contracts an attachment for a man, her inferior in point of birth and fortune;
but honorable, handsome, etc. -- She has a female friend, to whom she relates
all that passes in her breast -- her hopes, fears, meetings, partings, etc. --
She is treated hardly by her friends -- combats innumerable difficulties in the
sentimental way, but at last overcomes them all, and is made the bride of the
man of her heart.

Pshaw, said I, that is ^^le; there are at this present day, above two thousand
novels in existence, which begin and end exactly in the same way -- the novel
writers have now taken another road; and, if you will give me leave, I will
just give you a few hints, which may, perhaps, be of some service to you in
writing a novel in future.

SKETCH OF A MODERN NOVEL.
IN the first place, your heroine must fall violently in love with an
all-accomplished youth at a very early age -- keep her passion concealed from
her parents or guardians; but bind herself in her own mind to wed no other than
this dear, first conqueror of her heart -- ill-natured, proud, ambitious
fathers, are very necessary to be introduced -- kind, affectionate, amiable
mothers. The superlative beauty and accomplishments of your heroine, or perhaps
the splendor of her fortune, must attract the attention of a man diametrically
opposite in person and disposition to her first lover -- the father must
threaten -- the mother entreat -- and the lover be very urgent for the
completion of his felicity -- remember to mix a sufficient quantity of sighs,
tears, swooning, hysterics, and all the moving expressions of heart-rending woe
-- her filial duty must triumph over inclination; and she must be led like a
victim to the altar. --

So much for the first part.

The second volume displays her angelic, her exemplary conduct in the character
of a wife -- the husband must be jealous, brutal, fond of gaming, keep a
mistress, lavish all his fortune on sharpers and lewd women -- the wife pious,
gentle, obedient and resigned --

Be sure you contrive a duel; and, if convenient, a suicide might not be amiss
-- lead your heroine through wonderful trails -- let her have the fortitude of
an anchorite, the patience of an angel -- but in the end, send her first
husband to the other world, and unite her to the first possessor of her heart
-- join a few other incidents; such as the history of her bosom friend, and a
confidant -- Manage your plot in such a manner as to have some surprising
discovery made -- wind up with two or three marriages, and the superlative
felicity of all the dramatis personoe.

There, Sir, said I, there you have the substance of a narrative which might be
spun out to two or three, volumes -- there has been many novels introduced to
the public built on as slender a foundation as that -- The Modern Fine
Gentleman, Deserted Bride, Clara and --

THE INTERRUPTION.
I HAVE often been surprised, said the author, taking the sketch (for I had
wrote it down) and giving me a bow of thanks -- It has often surprised me, said
he, to find that all the distresses of a novel proceeds from a passion, which
is, in general, supposed to contribute to our chief happiness -- All writers of
that sort of production, from the time of romance and enchanted tales, to the
present tribe of scribblers, could find no other subject to employ their pens,
but love -- I wonder that the novel readers are not tired of reading one story
so many times, with only the variation of its being told different ways.

When I first commenced Author, continued he, I wrote on religion and
philosophy; but I found in the first I could gain no reputation, unless I wrote
in the enthusiastic style of a Methodist; and the latter was too obstruse a
study for the young and gay, required too much time for the old, and was
totally improper for the ignorant and illiterate. -- My books would not sell --
I had frequently applied to a person eminent for his numerous publications. He
told me if I wished to get a living, I must write to amuse rather than instruct
the world; and that If I would write him a good novel in two volumes, he would
give me ten guineas for it.

He thought, no doubt, ten guineas was a very large sum to be put into the
hands of a poor author: to deal heartily, I should have been very glad at that
time, of a fifth part of the sum -- but, to proceed -- I was not at all
conversant in that sort of reading; but finding it absolutely necessary, I
borrowed some of the best esteemed modern novels from a library, and began to
peruse them with great attention, but there was a sameness in the generality of
them that disgusted, and a looseness in the language of others that shocked me.

It is indeed shocking, said I, to see so many reams of paper expended in
ushering to the world pernicious pages, which tend to vitiate the taste and
corrupt the heart. When the heroine of a novel is represented as flying in the
face of filial duty, eloping, running into the very lap of danger, braving the
authority of her parents, and forgetting the decorum and delicacy which ought
to be the characteristic of the female sex, and yet, in the end, meets with
every blessing, every comfort, she can wish; is it not enough to ruin the weak
head and unwary heart, by leading them to think true felicity is to be found by
following the bent of their own inclinations, though never so wayward and
opposite to the advice of their friends or the dictates of reason?

Nor can I think that the more modern productions contain a better moral, since
the whole merit of the filial obedience is cancelled by the retaining an
affection for one man after they have vowed eternal fidelity to another.

I would wish the authors of those works to reflect, that it is the
inclinations of the heart that renders us guilty, as much as the actual
commission of a crime; and a woman who strays from her husband only in wishes
and thoughts, is, in reality, as culpable as she who actually wounds his honor.

I have very nice notions of conjugal fidelity and filial duty, and earnestly
wish that no writings might ever be made public which tend to injure either:
they are the foundation on which we may always raise the temple of happiness,
they are a crown of glory for the head, a cordial and comforter even to the
sorrow-wounded heart.

These virtues are the brightest ornaments the female sex can wear, they make
the plainest woman lovely; and, when displayed in an eminent degree, elevate
the human soul, and make it little inferior to angels.

THE FAIR MANIAC.
I WAS proceeding in this manner, when a lovely young creature darted out of a
little cottage, as we were passing, and seized me by the arm, eagerly desired I
would convey her back to her friends.

They say I am mad, said she: but I am not, I have my reason as well as they
have; I know I am miserable, and have been so ever since they took my brother
from me. -- Oh! cruel to tear him from my arms, to break my very heart strings,
and send him away, never, never to return -- he went on the treacherous ocean
-- Yes, yes, the sea, the sky, all, all combined with my inhuman guardian to
take him from me -- hark! hark! do you not hear the wind? -- See the blue
lightning -- the raging waves -- the thunder -- I hear it -- I see the vessel
beat the foaming sea -- I see my brother -- see him wave his hand -- I cannot
come -- I cannot save thee -- the vessel parts -- she sinks -- he is gone, he is
gone -- Oh! merciless. --

Alas my drooping lily, said I, you see nothing; there is no sea near you; this
is merely the effect of fancy; your brother, no doubt, is safe, and will one
day return to make you happy.

Oh no! said she, crossing her hands upon her bosom, and sitting down upon the
ground. -- Oh no! he will never eturn to me; he will never more sooth and cheer
his unhappy sister -- but here will I sit on this lone bank, and mourn the
heavy hour in which he left me -- I Will build a tomb of sea shells, weeds, and
corals -- I Will plant around it pale primroses and sickly daffodils, and every
day I Will wash it with my tears, and count the hours, and chide dull, lagging
Time, till his sharp scythe shall cut life's fine drawn thread, and I may lay
me down and sleep with my dear Horace --

Horace! said I, looking more intently at her -- It was poor Julietta -- then
Vellum was a villain.

At the name of Vellum, she started from the ground, appeared terrified, looked
wildly round her, and uttering a feint exclamation, ran hastily into the
cottage.

I bade the author a good night, and followed her -- but an old woman, who I
found was her only attendant, could give me no information concerning her; only
that she had lost her senses ever since the death of her brother, who was
shipwrecked as he was going abroad to finish his education, and that she had
been sent into the country, in hopes that the air would be of service to her.

I found my heart so deeply engaged by the miserable situation of this lovely
orphan, that it was with difficulty I restrained my tears when I pressed her
cold hand and bade her good night.

THE MENDICANT.
THOUGH it was near three years since I had been a witness to the sorrow of
Julietta, on the death of her father, yet the scene still remained fresh in my
memory -- I remembered the doubts I then entertained of Vellum's integrity, and
was determined immediately to return to town, and search into the mystery of
Horace's death, and the shocking privation of Julietta's senses.

When I have once formed a resolution, I am not long in putting it in execution.

The morning after my arrival in town, I determined to pay Mr. Vellum an
invisible visit.

As I was proceeding through a very public street, I saw a servant, in livery,
seeding a fine dog with bits of roast meat, which appeared perfectly fresh and
good. -- A poor woman, whose tattered garb spoke extremity of poverty, whose
emaciated frame seemed tottering on the verge of eternity, and whose head was
sprinkled over with hoary frost, approached the man, and in the humblest manner
entreated him to let her pick up a little of the victuals which he had thrown
to the animal -- only one bit, Sir, said she, to save me from starving -- The
servant was silent -- she took it for consent, and bent forward to pick up what
the dog seemed to refuse.

The servant, who, unmoved, had heard her request, no sooner saw her attempt to
gather up the broken scraps, than he stepped eagerly to her, snatched them from
her, and with sacrilegious hand struck the wretched mortal, whose sex, age, and
poverty, should have kept her sacred from insult.

Good Heavens! said I, that a man should so far forget himself. -- What! must
the brute creation enjoy case and plenty, while an unhappy human being wanders
through the streets perishing with hunger? -- and what must this poor woman
suffer, at seeing herself denied the fragments that are rejected by a brute?
for the dog had absolutely left a large part of the food that had been given
him.

Who does that dog belong to? said I to the servant.

Lord M --, said he.

Lord M --, said I, at that instant recollecting the unhappy cottagers -- then
why not pay Lord M -- a visit now, as well as at any other time; it will only
defer my intended enquiry at Mr. Vellum's a few hours longer.

It was no sooner thought on than determined; and having inquired of the
servant in which house his Lordship resided, I put on my ring, ascended the
steps, and patiently waited the opening of the door.

THE PEOPLE OF FASHION.
I CHOSE to make this visit invisible, that I might be the better able to judge
of the sentiments and disposition of his Lordship.

Having got admittance into the house, unperceived, I followed a servant who
was going up stairs with the breakfast apparatus, though it was then one
o'clock.

On entering a room, I saw a woman in an elegant dishabille, lolling on a
sopha, and turning over an enormous heap of complimentary cards -- She was
between forty and fifty -- was finely formed, and had once been handsome, if
one might judge from a regular set of features; but at present her skin was
shriveled and yellow, her eyes sunk and languid.

Thomas, said she to the servant, is my Lor stirring?

Yes, my Lady.

Go with my compliments, and I should be glad of his company to breakfast.

In a few moments my Lord entered, threw himself into an easy chair, yawned,
and drawled out the compliments of the morning.

Where were you, my Lord, last night? I was quite surprised at not seeing you
at Lady Blackace's -- all the world was there.

It is quite a bore, my Lady, to see a man and his wife at the same place.

Very true, my Lord; but had your Lordship appeared, I should certainly have
been so polite as to have made my exit. -- A propos, my Lord -- I wonder what
has become of that fond fool, Charles Howard, and how he and Isabella like
matrimony with the sour sauce of poverty -- Good God! continued she, I wonder
how any body can think of swallowing that bitter pill without having it
sufficiently gilded over.

A servant entered, and announced Mr. Howard.

Mr. Howard! cried my Lady, staring up with astonishment, surely you mistake;
my brother has been dead above these seven years; and Charles cannot think of
coming.

The gentleman certainly sent up the name of Howard, said the servant.

He was bid to show him up.

THE FATHER.
AN elegant, elderly gentleman soon entered the room, dressed in the military
habit -- he paid his respects politely to my Lord -- advanced to the Lady with
a look of tenderness, and embraced her.

You are, no doubt, surprised to see me, sister, said he, after having supposed
me dead so many years; but your surprise will be converted into joy when I
inform you during the last seven years of my absence I have accumulated a large
fortune, and am now come to reclaim my son, and return the kindness and
generosity with which you stepped forward, and offered him your favor and
protection during the time when my duty forced me to be absent from my native
country -- You, my dear Lord and Lady M --, took my poor boy when he had no
inheritance but poverty.

During the time the old gentleman was delivering these words Lady M -- 's
countenance underwent several changes, and at last settled in a deadly pale --
the fond father instantly saw the change, and asked in a voice scarcely
audible, whether his child was dead?

No, Captain Howard, said my Lord, he is not dead, but he has behaved so ill of
late, that he has entirely forfeited my favor; he has voluntarily absented
himself from my house; and to confess the truth, I have not seen him these six
years, nor do I know where he is.

And what has he done? asked the distracted father.

He has behaved like a poor, mean spirited wretch, said my Lady -- he has
degraded the family my marrying a low, vulgar creature, in direct opposition to
the advice, nay absolute commands, of my Lord and myself.

Upon my honor, Mr. Howard, said my Lord, I had contracted such an esteem for
the lad* that I had positively determined to adopt him; but on his absolutely
persisting in his design of marrying the low creature my Lady mentions, I
forbid him my house: -- I had no intention to adopt a beggar's brat.

The conversation was now interrupted by a servant, who informed my Lady there
was company in the drawing room -- she begged leave of her brother to go and
receive them, and my Lord, having rung for his valet, retired to adjust his
dress:

THE ECLAIRCISSEMENT.
CAPTAIN Howard had been abruptly informed that his son had forfeited his
uncle's favor; had been informed of it in a manner inconsiderate and
unfeeling* and then left to himself to reflect at leisure on his misfortune.

He sat with one hand resting on the breakfast table, and the other in his
bosom, his brow contracted* and his eyes fixed on the floor -- there was such a
dignity in his person, and yet such an apparent concern upon his countenance,
that my affections were drawn toward him by an irresistible impulse -- I
longed to call him brother and friend -- my heart was wrung with sensibility.

And what avails it, said I, that this man has accumulated a large fortune? --
of what benefit is wealth to him? -- he had looked upon his son as his greatest
treasure -- for these many years has his delighted imagination drawn a most
perfect picture of felicity in the idea of beholding this beloved son, and
seeing him enjoying the favor of his uncle, and perhaps wedded to some amiable
woman, who, to the gifts of birth and fortune, added the gifts of nature, whose
beauty created love, and her virtue esteem.

Behold him now in one moment bereaved of this darling hope, his heart aching
with paternal love and fear -- oh! would children but reflect how greatly the
happiness of a parent depends on their well doing; could they have the least
idea of the mighty pangs which tear the parental bosom when they stray from
their duty, they would surely avoid every action which might tend to disturb
the peace or wound the minds of their parents; for sure I am, that not the
sharpest torture enthusiastic zeal could invent, can equal the torments that
rend the heart of a fondly-doating disappointed parent.

My meditations were interrupted by a decent, elderly woman, who opened the
door, and, advancing to Captain Howard, welcomed him cordially to England.

My good Mrs. Watson, said he, taking her by her hand* can you tell me where
Charles is, and to whom he has united himself so contrary to the desire of his
uncle and aunt?

It was for that purpose, said Mrs. Watson, that I took the liberty of coming
into the room to speak to you -- but this room, Sir, is not a proper place to
converse in; I must beg you to come into my apartment, and I will then inform
you of some circumstances which will fill you with astonishment.

I felt a curiosity which I could not withstand, and, anxious for the fate of
Charles, I followed Captain Howard and Mrs. Watson into another apartment. Mrs.
Watson I found was Lady M -- 's housekeeper, and had formerly lived in that
capacity with her Ladyship's mother -- When Captain Howard was seated, she
related the following circumstances:

You know, Sir, said she, just before you left England, my Lady, at my Lord's
request, had taken Miss Isabella Beauchamp to be her companion -- you had not
been gone many years before Mr. Beauchamp died insolvent, and the poor young
Lady had no dependence but on my Lord, who was a distant relation of her
father's. From the time of Mr. Beauchamp's death, Lady M -- altered in her
behavior to Miss Bella; treated her often with disrespect; and in general,
with cold contempt -- My Lord, on the contrary, behaved with the greatest
politeness, assiduity, and attention; made her elegant presents, insisted on
her joining all parties, public or private, in which Lady M -- was included --
young Mr. Howard showed the attention of a brother; and, I must own, this
conduct raised both the gentlemen highly in my opinion It was with great
concern that I noticed a settled melancholy on Miss Bella's countenance, and
often would she retire from a crowded assembly to her own apartment and give a
loose to her tears -- she had always conducted herself in such a manner as to
gain the love of all the domestics, and she had favored me with many singular
marks of friendship -- I therefore took the liberty one day to enquire into the
cause of her melancholy; when bursting into a flood of grief, she cried, oh!
Mrs. Watson, what will become of me? Lord M -- pursues me with a criminal
passion -- I cannot stay in this family to be subject to his insults; and if I
leave it, how shall I guard myself from the snares and insults of the unfeeling
part of mankind, who know not how to pity poverty? or how shall I provide for
the necessaries of life? I endeavored all in my power to console her, and told
her I would certainly look out for some reputable family where she might be
boarded on moderate terms, and that I would advise her to sell a few of her
jewels to provide for the present, and trust in providence that her future life
may be more fortunate -- she gave me a pair of diamond earings, which were her
mother's, to dispose of; but as I was returning to my own apartment I met Mr.
Howard, and knowing he was always plentifully supplied with money by his aunt,
I determined to make him acquainted with Miss Bella's situation, and engage him
to assist her -- but judge my surprise, when I had informed him of my Lord's
designs, to hear him fly into a violent rage, and swear she should not stay
another hour in the house* called her his wife, his adored Bella, and was
hastening to her apartment, when he was stopped by his aunt, who had overheard
our conversation, and peremptorily demanded whether he had been so mean
spirited as to marry Miss Beauchamp? -- he answered with warmth, he was not
married to her; but since there was no other way to shield her from the
contempt of pride and the insults of libertinism, he would marry her the next
morning.

Lady M -- was greatly irritated, and sent a message to Miss Beauchamp,
commanding her to quit her house instantly -- Charles followed the poor
distressed girl; and before my Lord returned, who was then in the country,
prevailed on her to give him a lawful right to protect her.

However ill Miss Beauchamp had been treated, Mr. Howard thought it was his
duty to visit his uncle, and sue for his pardon, for the precipitate step he
had taken.

They made their appearance the morning after my Lord come to town -- It is
unnecessary, and would only be shocking your feelings, to give you an account
of the reception they met with; suffice it to say, they were spurned by the
haughty pair, and turned with indignity out of the house. Lord M -- swearing by
all that was holy he would not give them a single farthing to keep them from
starving -- they left the house, and I never heard where they were till last
summer, when I accidentally found them in a mean cottage, which they rented of
Lord M -- 's steward -- they went by an assumed name, and Mrs. Howard having
bred very fast, and being very weakly, they were reduced to the most abject
state of penury.

Then these are my poor cottagers, said I.

-- Mr. Howard, when he had heard the conclusion of her relation, arose from
his seat and looking at once joy and indignation, swore he would never rest
till he had found his dear injured Charles.

I will find him, said he; and his lovely Isabella shall be rewarded for all
her love and patient sufferings -- he gave the housekeeper something by way of
gratuity, and immediately departed -- when I, having no farther business there,
followed his example.

NATURAL REFLECTION.
IT has often surprised me to find that people who have, with unbounded
generosity, educated, clothed, and fostered an infant in childhood, indulging
it to an extravagant degree, never suffering it to be contradicted, but
bringing it up in ease and luxury, shall, when that infant arrives at years of
maturity, when it has attained sense and reason sufficient to enable it to
judge what will most conduce to its own happiness, for the most trifling
misdemeanor, nay, for only daring to think contrary to its benefactors, or
presuming to choose a companion for itself, spurn from them, with indignity,
the object they once cherished, and drive it out, defenseless, to brave those
storms of adversity, which the education they have bestowed on it renders it
totally unable to combat with -- It has often puzzled me to determine whether
such people have ever been actuated by true generosity. Pure philanthropy will
lead us rather to study the happiness of a human being, when it is capable of
receiving real satisfaction from our kindness. So far from evincing our
affection to children by unlimited indulgencies, we are acting with cruelty
toward them, since we are laying up a fund of discontent and uneasiness for
hereafter. How hard is it for those darlings of families, whose every desire
has been complied with, who never wished for a toy or bauble, but it was
procured, though at the most exorbitant price, who was always fed with the
greatest dainties, to find, when arrived at maturity, that they are journeying
through a world, where they will unavoidably meet with disappointments,
vexation and trouble -- for my part, I would never indulge my children in a
wish which I thought might tend hereafter to render them unhappy; I would teach
them to confine their desires within the bounds of moderation, not by morosely
opposing all their little fancies, but by insensibly drawing off their
attention to any other objects.

As they advanced in years, I would, by example, teach them that forbearance
and self-denial, which precept alone will ever fail to effect. If they have
affluence, let them enjoy every reasonable wish of their hearts; and no one
need inquire what is to be done with the overplus.

Oh! ye sons and daughters of prosperity, look around you; see, in yon little
mansion lies a mother; a few hours since made her the parent of her seventh
child; she is in a situation, of all others the most deserving pity; she has
scarcely the means to support life; she is on a bed of pain and weakness; pain,
my lovely countrywomen, from which none of you are exempt, and which, no doubt,
you think almost insufferable, though you are surrounded with all the comforts
and blessings of life -- that poor woman has no comfort -- her husband is at
sea, laboring, watching, toiling, for a small pittance, which he hopes to
bring home to his wife and children -- she has anguish of mind added to the
sickness of her frame -- have you no trifle to spare, Madam, which might, in
some measure, alleviate that poor creature's sufferings? Two or three of those
guineas will never be missed by you, and they will be a treasure to her. -- You
cannot spare them -- you had rather lay them out in a hobby horse for master,
or a wax baby for miss -- if the dear creatures are disappointed, they will
fret and spoil their pretty faces with crying; and what mother can refuse her
little darlings any thing they ask for?

Oh! shame on thee, woman; thou have not one spark of genuine maternal
tenderness in thy composition, or thou would prefer easing the pangs of a
wretched mother, whose heart is pierced by the cries of her children wanting
bread, rather than by gratifying the caprice of thy own children -- lead them
to set no farther value on the wealth which Providence has entrusted to their
care, than as it may serve to purchase pleasure, dissipation, and folly.

Your wealth was certainly given you to purchase pleasure, but pleasures far,
very far different from those you are so eager in the pursuit of -- Go wipe the
tear from the eye of affliction; cloathe the poor naked wretch who, nightly
unhoused, in some sad lonely place, braves storms and tempests, heats and
pinching cold -- go release the unfortunate tradesman, who, through the
inattention, folly, or villainy of others, has lost his property, and now sighs
out his long, long hours in a prison -- Go seek the wretched mortals, who, by
dire misfortune reduced, oppressed by the iron hand of affliction, sit starving
in obscurity, and, rather than ask the cruel world for assistance, or blazon
forth their heartfelt sorrows, would sink to the silent grave, victims to
famine in the land of plenty.

I know, Madam, you will say I am very dull, that I have given you the vapors,
that these are phantoms of my own creating -- would to Heaven they were! but
alas! these things have seen, and my heart has bled that I had not power to
relieve them.

Oh! I could tell such tales of woe, drag forth such vile ingratitude to light,
that human nature would disclaim the being who could practice it.

THE INGRATE.
Do you see that beautiful woman in that splendid equipage, surrounded by a
train of servants? it is the thoughtless, ungrateful Amelia.

Behold that poor old woman, who toils through the dirt, unattended by any but
her two lovely daughters, sweet as opening flowers, and innocent as newborn
infants; see on her venerable countenance, what grief and despondency is
imprinted! see the big tears roll down her furrowed cheeks! see she enters an
obscure apartment, and a scanty meal is divided between her children and
herself.

She looks at them by turns, with such maternal tenderness, such anguish of
heart, that she seems to say, what will become of you, my sweet children; how
will you pass through life, when I am gone?

That poor old woman was Amelia's benefactress -- but it is fit I should tell
my tale methodically.

Amelia was the daughter of a gentleman of small fortune, who, besides her, had
nine other children: Mrs. Ellwin was a distant relation of the family; she was
the wife of an opulent merchant, and their habitation was the habitation of
philanthropy.

Amelia had received a tolerable education -- she was pretty in her person,
cheerful in her disposition, and had a good share of understanding; with these
accomplishments, Mrs. Ellwin thought it would be a pity for Amelia to be buried
in obscurity; she gave her an invitation to her house, clothed her genteelly,
and introduced her into such company as she thought would be most conducive to
her future advancement in life. It was not long before Amelia's charms made a
conquest of a gentleman of large fortune -- he loved her; and her virtues were
so kindly brought forward by Mrs. Ellwin, and her little faults buried in
oblivion, that he overlooked her want of fortune, made her his wife, and
settled upon her five hundred pounds per annum jointure. Amelia had not long
enjoyed this advancement, before Mr. Ellwin, having placed too great a
dependence on the honor of a friend, lost a large sum of money; of consequence
his payments were not punctual, and he became a bankrupt.

He struggled for some time against his adverse fate, but at length died of a
broken heart* and left his wife and lovely daughters no inheritance but poverty.

About this time, Amelia became a widow: -- but Amelia was now a fine lady --
she had no time to spend with poor relations, no money to spare to relieve the
distresses of Mrs. Ellwin; though her wedding clothes were purchased by that
generous friend, and cost near five hundred pounds, and that sum had never been
repaid.

Amelia is now just married again, and flying about in all the gaiety of heart
which wealth and splendor can inspire in a giddy mortal; while poor Mrs.
Ellwin is sinking under a load of anguish, unpitied and unthought of. Her once
blooming, amiable daughters drooping like frost-nipped blossoms, and either
Friendship, Humanity, nor Gratitude will reach forth a hand to cheer, revive,
or save them.

But I am wandering from my intended route.

THE SUICIDES.
As I approached Mr. Vellum's house, an hearse and six mourning coaches drove
from the door.

Perhaps, said I, the guardian is gone to give an account of his guardianship
-- and a very black account I fear it will be -- however I will go in; perhaps
I may learn something concerning the death of Horace, or gain some intelligence
which may be serviceable to the hapless Julietta.

I put on my ring, and a servant opening the door soon afterward, I entered
unperceived.

I went into several rooms before I found any body likely to give me any
satisfaction by their conversation. At length I entered a chamber, where, on an
embroidered sopha, lay Mr. Vellum, surrounded by magnificence -- but, good
Heavens! how changed from the man he once was -- his face was ghastly pale, his
eyes sunk, yet their motion was so quick and fiery, that they gave him the
appearance of a fiend rather than an human being.

Opposite to him, in a pensive posture, sat a young woman in a deep mourning
habit; her face was partly concealed with her handkerchief, but the part that
appeared bore such evident marks of sorrow, that a savage must have felt his
heart moved with pity at the sight.

He is gone, gone for ever, cried Vellum, starting from the sopha, and catching
hold of the young lady's hand -- he is gone, Hester, and you know not half the
anguish of my soul.

My dear father* said she, why will you give way to unavailing sorrow? the kind
power who lent him to you, has but recalled his own -- it is the lot of
mortality -- then why, my father, why will you offend your Creator by repining
at his divine will?

O, Hester, you do not know the dreadful circumstances of your brother's death
-- alas! my child, he rushed unbidden into the presence of his Maker with
multitudes of unrepented crimes upon his head.

Did he destroy himself? cried Hester, the look of woe changing into that of
inexpressible horror. -- Oh! what could tempt him to the dreadful deed?

Hester, my beloved daughter, I was his murderer, I was the cause of the horrid
act.

Forbid it, gracious God, she cried, clasping her hands, and sinking upon her
knees -- Oh! my father, recall those shocking words; you was not, could not be,
so inhuman.

Hester, said he, with a look of horrid firmness, I will unfold to you a tale,
which it is proper you should know; I may not long continue with you. -- I have
been guilty of deeds, which will make your tender* heart shudder to acknowledge
me as a parent -- Oh! cursed avarice, it was that which led me to stain my soul
with murder, and to ruin my child, my darling son. -- For him and for thee, I
would have gained an empire, though I had waded to it through oceans of human
blood* but to lead him by vile persuasions to agree to and execute the accursed
plot, and plunge himself, for sordid ore, to the lowest abyss of hell. -- Oh!
it is more than I can bear to think of -- my soul is at this moment suffering
all the tortures of the damned -- scorpions, flames, and furies hang about me
-- Horace, dear murdered youth, well may you smile to see my tortures.

Was Horace murdered! Oh! inhuman wretch, cried Hester -- then where is my
sweet Julietta? have you murdered her too?

I hope she still lives, said Vellum; and may your gentle friendship recall her
wandering reason, for my cruelty has bereaved her of her senses; and if she is
alive, she is a poor, distressed lunatic.

Gracious Heaven! cried Hester, bursting into a flood of tears, and leaning her
head upon the elbow of the sopha.

The lovely girl, continued her father, is in a miserable cottage, on one of
her own estates, in Wiltshire, where I have employed an old woman to watch her,
and, by harsh treatment, prevent her returning to reason.

As to Horace he is no more -- When I sent him abroad, as I said, for
education, your brother went with him -- we laid the shocking plot before the
vessel sailed; and one night as they were walking the deck together, your
brother pushed Horace into the sea -- the vessel was sailing before the wind,
and he was lost in a moment.

You, my dear Hester, I knew would be an obstacle to these hellish schemes, and
for that reason I sent you to France. -- About three weeks since your brother
had a thousand pounds of me; and in a few days after, applied for more; it was
then I discovered he had a propensity for gaming -- I remonstrated with him on
the folly of such a pursuit, and refused him a supply -- high words ensued --
he accused me of being a murderer; of drawing him in to participate the crime,
and then refusing him a participation of the wealth I had by that means gained.
-- It is impossible for you to conceive the terrors that seized my mind during
this conversation; I actually formed the resolution of giving this darling of
my soul into the hands of justice, and thereby saving my own wretched life --
but before I could execute my intention, I was alarmed by the discharge of a
pistol -- I ran to your brother's room, and saw him weltering in his blood, a
pistol clenched in his hand.

Go, leave me, said he, as I approached him; add not, by thy hateful presence,
to the horror of this moment -- I thought, by dying, to shut out life and
misery together, to fly from the terrors of a reproaching conscience; but,
alas! my miseries are but just beginning.

Oh! thou detested, wretched old man, continued he, drawing me forcibly toward
him, thou art ignorant what a task thou have yet to perform: Go, lose not a
moment, but use every method to restore that injured angel Julietta to her
senses -- give her back her fortune -- and do thou retire to some desert --
fast, pray, and lay upon the cold ground -- years and years spent in
supplication will hardly gain that pardon you so much need. -- There is! there
is! an hereafter -- I feel it now rush on my guilty soul. -- You do not know
how hard it is to die, to plunge at once into eternity. -- Oh! murder, murder
cannot be forgiven.

At that instant he expired with a groan, so hollow, that it still vibrates in
my ears.

I hear thee, Oh! thou guilty shade -- I will obey thee.

Hester, continued Vellum, I have sent for you home, that you may administer
comfort to Julietta -- here, take this paper, and go prepare for your journey;
when you are separated from me, open it; you will there find full instructions
how to act -- leave me, my child; I am now more composed, I may perhaps take
some rest.

Hester gladly retired.

I saw from the agitation of her features, though she could not but pity the
distresses of her father's mind, it was impossible for her any longer to love
him.

That task is over, said Vellum, as she shut the door -- now, what remains? --
to pray for pardon. -- Pardon for what? -- Murder. Ah! that is not all* my soul
is loaded with crimes -- Fraud* perjury, oppression, are in the horrid
catalogue! -- the widows, the fatherless children whom I have oppressed, will
rise up in judgment against me. -- Mercy -- Oh! mercy just God. -- but wretch
that I am, did I ever show mercy -- will that just Creator then show mercy to
me? -- No -- for I must appear at a tribunal where every one will be rewarded
according to his works.

Oh that I was annihilated! -- that I had never lived -- for the distraction of
my mind is too mighty to be borne -- I will not bear it -- I will end my
tortures -- my life is in my own power* and it is but to plunge at once into
evils which cannot be more dreadful than this constant terror. -- This is the
instrument, said he, taking a pistol from his pocket.

I stepped forward, in order to prevent his fatal intention.

It shall be done quick, said he -- I will not languish --

I caught hold of his arm; but it was too late; he had pointed the pistol to
his temple -- it went off, and he plunged in one moment into a dreadful
eternity.

Oh! save him! save him! cried Hester, bursting into the room; he is not fit to
die.

When she saw the shocking catastrophe, she uttered a scream of terror, and
sunk down upon the floor -- the servants entered, and all was in an instant a
scene of confusion.

I thought I could gain no farther intelligence -- and my spirits being greatly
depressed by the occurrences of the day, I departed, determining in a few days
to pay the gentle, unfortunate Hester another visit.

THE WIFE.
I WISH to go to Mrs. Melbourne's assembly, next week, if agreeable to you, my
dear, said a woman, who was walking through the park with a man whose
appearance spoke him the gentleman.

She was a pretty-looking person; her countenance was open and engaging, and
there was a mild air of tender melancholy diffused over it.

She led by the hand a beautiful girl, about four or five years old; and a
smiling boy, seemingly a year or two older, was skipping, with steps as light
as his own innocent heart, before them -- that man, said I, must surely be
happy.

I examined his countenance with a scrutinizing eye, and me thought I read in
it indifference and inattention; nay, he even seemed uneasy in the company of
his wife and lovely children.

-- I should like to go to Mrs. Melbourne's assembly, said she, putting her
hands under his arm, and giving him a look of tenderness -- it was a look I
know not well how to describe; it was a mixture of affection and gentle
solicitude; it was that kind of look my Emma ever assumes when she has any
little favor to ask, and it always carries with it such persuasive eloquence,
that for my soul I could not refuse, though she were to request the half of my
fortune.

You want new clothes too, I suppose, said he, rather surlily.

I thought you might make it convenient to let me have my half-years stipend,
said she, mildly; and you know, my dear, I never exceed it.

Very well, Madam, I hear enough of your economy, said he, withdrawing his arm
in anger; but I tell you I have no money for myself, and therefore cannot let
you have any. -- I do not see why you should go to Mrs. Melbourne's; you may
find employment and amusement too in nursing your brats; home is the fittest
place for women.

I will not go, Mr. Selby, if you desire I should not.

There now, make a merit of staying at home to oblige me, when you cannot go,
because I will not give you money to lavish in finery. The education of your
children costs me so much, that I intend, for the future, to reduce your
allowance to half what it used to be.

Very well, my dear, you are the best judge of what you can afford; I shall
always have your interest too much at heart to repine at being deprived of a
few superfluities, which I can easily do without.

By this time, they were arrived at Spring Gardens, where an handsome chariot
was waiting.

I am engaged out this evening, said he, handing her into the carriage.

Shall I see you at supper? said she, again assuming the look of solicitude;
but it was far more anxious than the former.

No -- perhaps I shall not return all night, said he, and immediately left her
without even the common form of civility.

Drive on* said she to the coachman; and as the carriage moved, I saw her apply
her handkerchief to her eyes.

Poor woman said I; at that instant feeling the drop of pity start into my own
-- Poor woman! thou art surrounded with wealth, have a number of servants, and,
no doubt, for these advantages, are the object of envy in the eyes of many;
but, alas! the poor cottager, whose mansion appears the habitation of poverty,
who has just set by her wheel, and is feeding a number of cherry-cheeked,
curlypated, ragged children, whose husband, returning from the labors of the
field, accosts her with words of kindness, kisses all his little prattlers
round, and takes the youngest on his knee to share his homely supper, that
humble cottager is happier far than you.

These reflections had passed with such rapidity through my brain, that Mr.
Selby was still in sight. -- I will follow thee, said I, and see what has had
power to charm thee from so sweet, so gentle a companion.

Having get my ring on, I quickened my pace, and soon overtook him.

He proceeded to May Fair: when knocking at the door of a large house, a
servant in a showy livery opened it, when, taking the advantage of my
invisibility, I entered, and followed him through a magnificent suit of rooms
into a drawing room.

THE MISTRESS.
SHE was an elegant-formed woman, rather above the middle size; her features
were regular, and her complexion would have been dazzling, had it not been for
an immoderate quantity of rouge, which she had laid on her face, which, in
reality, required no art to make it lovely; her eyes were dark, lively, and
piercing; and her hair, which was bright as golden thread, hung in wanton
ringlets round her face and neck; her dress was studiedly negligent, being only
a white muslin robe, with small silver sprigs; it was fastened round her
slender waist with a velvet zone, ornamented with pearl; she was seated by a
table, on which sat a little French dog, which she was caressing as we entered.

My charming Lassonia, said he, running to her with eagerness, how tedious have
the hours passed that kept me from you!

No doubt they have, said she coldly, evading his offered embrace, when you
have made it two hours later than you promised.

My dearest love, I could not avoid it, said he, business of importance --

Oh you are a very prudent man, said she, scornfully; by all means business
should be attended to before pleasure; but it is very well, Mr. Selby, I have
waited at home to hear your paltry excuse for breaking your word; but I have
made an engagement which I cannot possibly break; my chair is waiting: --

She arose to leave the room.

My angel, my dear Lassonia, said he, catching her hands, you surely do not
mean to leave me; hear me but one word; I should have been here much sooner,
had I not overtaken my wife and children in the Park, and she began teazing me
for money.

And you gave it her? said she, with precipitation.

No, my charmer, I have not given it to her, I have reserved it for you; there
is not a wish my Lassonia can form, but shall be immediately complied with --
Emily had set her heart upon going to Mrs. Melbourne's assembly; but I knew my
adored girl intended to be there, and did not wish to meet her; so I have
desired her not to go.

And have you brought me your wife's diamonds? said she.

No -- but you shall have some more valuable than those -- we will go out now,
and you shall choose them at any price you please.

What, I suppose, said she, with a look of contempt, your wife refused to part
with them; and you, a poor, tame-spirited husband, dared not contradict her;
but I will have her jewels or none, so take your choice* Sir, either bring me
the meek, dutiful Emily's diamonds, or never see me more.

What a pity it is, said I, as I stood contemplating this scene, what a pity so
lovely a form should conceal so vile a heart; that woman appears a masterpiece
of nature, and yet draw aside that beauteous veil, and there is such soul
deformity within, that we shrink with horror and disgust from the very object
which at first view filled us with admiration.

I am unwilling to refuse you any thing, my sweet girl, said he; but indeed I
do not know how to get the jewels; I have no plausible pretext to ask for them.

And is this your boasted love? said she, this the fidelity, the fervent
passion you have so repeatedly sworn? am I to be denied so trifling a
gratification, because you cannot bear a few tears from that proud minx your
wife? have I not sacrificed every thing for you? relinquished reputation,
honor, friends; and is this the return? this the gratitude I am to meet with?
you would sooner break my heart than comply with the smallest of my wishes.

During these reproaches, she had vented her passion by tears.

Do not thus distress yourself, my dearest creature, said Selby; you cut me to
the soul by your reproaches; come, dry up your tears, and tell me in what can I
oblige you?

Go and bring me Emily's diamonds this evening, said she.

I came to spend the night with you, my love, then do not send me from you; let
us go out and purchase some other trinkets.

I will have nothing but the diamonds! exclaimed she, in an agony of passion;
which remined me of Othello, in his jealous fury, raving for the fatal
handkerchief.

At length the infatuated Selby, finding it was in vain to attempt to sooth
her, and being, as he said, unable to live without her, actually promised to go
home and fetch the jewels for which she expressed such a desire.

I was determined to go with him, and hastily stepping down stairs before him,
stepped unperceived into a hackney coach which he had sent for, and was waiting
for him at the door -- a short time brought us to Gower street.

THE RECEPTION.
THIS is kind indeed, my love, said Mrs. Selby, meeting him with a smile as he
entered the parlour; I was afraid you would not have returned so soon.

Pshaw, said he, throwing himself into a chair; I do not suppose you will be so
pleased when I tell you the business which brought me home.

If it is any thing which will make you uneasy, my dear, said she, I shall
certainly regret it; but if it only concerns myself, I shall regret nothing
which gives me the extatic pleasure of your company.

You are a good girl, Emily, said he, taking her hand -- and methought at that
instant he repented the task he had undertaken -- but it was a momentary
reflection.

I have occasion for a large sum of money, said he, to make up a payment, and I
have no possible means of raising it.

Good God! cried she, turning pale with apprehension, are your circumstances
really so bad then?

Make no inquiries, said he, but consider if you can form any plan to relieve
me.

How much do you want, my love?

About two thousand pounds.

I dare say my father will lend you such a trifle, rather than you should be
distressed.

So, Madam, said he, you would advise me to apply to your father, and make my
misfortunes the talk of the town. -- You say you love me, Emily.

Heaven knows I do most fervently.

Then to prove it bring me your jewels, they will procure me the money I want.

You cannot raise so large a sum without my mother's also; and I should not
wish to part with them.

A very pretty declaration indeed, Madam; you value your mother's memory more
than your husband's peace of mind.

Oh! do not say so harsh a word, said she; I will bring the jewels -- had I the
universe at my command, it would be of no value to me, when put in competition
with your happiness.

She left the room, and soon returned with the jewels.

Here they are, said she; would to Heaven every desire which you form may be as
easily obtained.

He looked them over.

These are not all, said he --

A blush of confusion passed over the pale face of the trembling Emily.

I have indeed reserved some, said she; but do not be angry, I cannot part with
the first tokens of your love; I cannot part with your picture.

I must have all, said he, impatiently.

The afflicted wife drew from her throbbing bosom a miniature picture set with
diamonds, and a small, but valuable locket, emblematical of love and peace; he
took them from her --

Leave me the picture, said she -- take the diamonds, but, for pity's sake,
take not that dear, first pledge of your love. -- The picture will not enhance
the value to any but me.

I cannot stay to take it out, said he, putting the jewels in his pocket, and
giving the poor, weeping Emily a slight kiss; he snatched up his hat, and
instantly returned to the vile Lassonia.

I had been too much disgusted with that woman's behavior to entertain a
thought of returning with him, therefore, taking off my ring when I left the
house, I walked toward home.

THE INFORMATION.
BEING at the play with a friend some months after, I observed Lassonia in a
box opposite to that in which I sat, adorned with the very jewels which Selby
had obtained from his affectionate wife.

Who that sees that woman, said I to my friend* but would think her the
loveliest work of creation?

I have been admiring her for some time, said he; can you give me any
information concerning her? I have seen her once before, and am quite
captivated with her beauty* if her mind is equal to her person, I could freely
devote my life to such a woman.

There is no more comparison between her mind and her form said an old
gentleman in a black coat and a snug round wig, who sat just behind us -- there
is no more comparison between them, said he, than there is between an angel of
Light and a demon of Hell.

Do you know her, Sir, said my friend, turning hastily round.

I do, young man, said he; and to guard you from the effects of her pernicious
charms, if you will sup with me after the play, I will tell you a tale that
shall make you hate her.

When the play was over, we adjourned to a tavern, and after supper our new
friend gave us the history of Lassonia.

Miss Freeman and Miss Eldridge, said he, were the daughters of two opulent
tradesmen; their fathers were united in the closest bonds of amity. Emily
Freeman and Lassonia Eldridge were playmates in infancy, educated at the same
school, and contracted for each other the affection of sister. -- Emily had
just entered her sixteenth year, when she was called from school to attend an
excellent mother, who was hastily advancing to that "bourne from whence no
traveller returns." Lassonia would not be separated from her friend on this
trying occasion, and Mrs. Freeman soon after paying the debt of nature, she was
retained by Mr. Freeman, as a companion, whose vivacity would prevent Emily
from too frequently musing on her recent loss.

Mr. Selby became acquainted with the lovely friends before Emily had attained
her eighteenth year -- her sense and penetration charmed him; and her person,
having then all the attractions of blooming youth, he declared himself her
lover -- he frequently laughed and romped with Lassonia, but never entertained
a thought of love, as her conduct, in general, was so flighty, and her
conversation so trifling, that though it was impossible to avoid admiring her
beauty, she had not one requisite calculation to create esteem.

About this time Mr. Eldridge was taken ill -- the physicians feared a
consumption, and advised a journey to Montpelier -- Lassonia accompanied her
father, and, during their absence, Emily gave her hand to Mr. Selby. Mr.
Eldridge recovered his health, and they revisited England; when no mention
being made of Lassonia's returning to Mrs. Selby, she continued with her
father* to superintend his family. Two years passed on in delightful harmony
between Mr. and Mrs. Selby* in which time she presented him with a boy and a
girl. During that period the father of Lassonia died insolvent, and she was
reduced to the necessity of going to service, as there was not the least
provision for her future subsistence.

It was then the generous, disinterested Emily offered her an asylum in her
house, appointed her an apartment, a servant to attend her, and supplied her
with clothes and money from her own private purse.

Lassonia had not long been an inmate in the house of her friend, before,
envious of her felicity, she determined to imbitter it, by alienating the
affection of Selby from his truly amiable wife -- Selby was young, and fond of
variety; his passion for Emily was greatly abated by possession, and though he
almost venerated her for her virtues, the charms of her faithless friend
enflamed his heart, and he eagerly caught at the frequent opportunities which
she intentionally gave him to plead his passion.

Lassonia is a proud woman; her situation was irksome, though every favor from
Emily was conferred in so delicate a manner, that an indifferent spectator
would have imagined her the person obliged.

She was likewise an artful woman; she soon gained such an ascendency over
Selby, that while Emily scarcely dared to hint her wishes, Lassonia demanded
with authority, and gained every desire. Yet of so gentle, unsuspicious a
temper, was Mrs. Selby, and so great a confidence did she place in the honor
of her friend and her husband, that though Lassonia remained in the family near
a twelvemonth after her connection with Selby, she never once thought such a
thing could happen. -- She frequently lamented to her treacherous friend the
alteration in her husband's behavior, but she never suspected her as the cause
of her uneasiness.

But Lassonia now found it necessary to remove from Mrs. Selby's, to prevent
her shame from becoming public; she told Emily that she was distressed at being
so great an encumbrance to her, and that having an opportunity of going abroad
with a lady, who wanted a companion, she would embrace it, and endeavor to
contribute to her own support. By this conduct, she laid a plan to prevent
returning to the family, which she predetermined not to do before she left it.

Mrs. Selby loaded her with obligations at parting. She retired to a small
house, about twenty miles from town, which Selby had provided for her
reception, and where she remained three years, Selby spending great part of his
time with her.

About six months since she came to town, assumed the name of Green, took an
elegant house, and set up a carriage. Mrs. Selby hearing of her arrival, and
supposing she was married, requested me, who at that time was ignorant of the
circumstances I have now related, to go with her and pay Lassonia a morning
visit.

We were shown into the drawing room by a servant* who informed us his mistress
would be down in a few minutes, but that she was then dressing.

How agreeably surprised my dear Lassonia will be said Emily to find I am the
lady who wanted to speak with her -- for she had sent up no name.

We were chatting on indifferent subjects, when a child ran into the room,
crying, I will have papa's picture; I will not break it indeed, a maid followed
him in; he ran to Emily, whose arms were extended to receive him, and throwing
the picture into her lap, judge her feelings when she saw the portrait of Mr.
Selby, which she had given him but two days before with the greatest regret,
imagining him in want of money. Her feelings overpowered her, and she fell
lifeless on the floor. The cries of the servant alarmed the family, and
Lassonia, thinking some misfortune had happened to her child, rushed into the
room, followed by Selby himself.

It is impossible to describe the scene that ensued on the recovery of Emily --
Lassonia raved, Mrs. Selby wept, and Selby appeared motionless as a statue.

As soon as Emily was able to walk, I took her hand and led her to the
carriage. Upon her return home, her fainting fits returned; she passed a night
of inconceivable distress for Selby never came near her; and in the morning she
was in a violent fever* I then went in pursuit of the perfidious husband but as
the suffering saint desired, forbore to reproach him.

I found him, and he returned with me to her.

She beheld him approach with a faint smile -- It is kind, my Selby, said she,
to come and receive the parting sigh of her who has so long been a barrier to
your happiness; indeed I did not know, or I never would have visited my happy
rival -- I never thought your love was divided, and the certainty of it came so
sudden upon my heart, that, weak and unprepared as it was, it could not bear
the shock -- take care of my children, said she* adieu, my love; my heart may
break, but my tongue will never reproach you.

Her disorder hourly increased; a delirium ensued; and before the next morning
she breathed her last, invoking blessings on the head of her faithless husband
and treacherous friend.

THE DISSERTATION.
IT is such women as Lassonia, who cast an odium on the whole sex; and such
women are not only objects of contempt, but detestation. I am not of opinion
that women would never degenerate into vice, were they not at first seduced by
man; certain I am, though my heart aches at the idea, that there are many
women, who are abandoned to all manner of wickedness, entirely through the
depravity of their inclinations. -- Oh! how my soul rises with indignation, to
see the fairest works of the Creator's hand so far forget their native dignity,
as to glory in actions which debase them beneath the lowest reptile that crawls
upon the earth! To see a woman loaded with ornaments which are the wages of
guilt, and exulting in the badges of her dishonor; to see her admitted into
all public places, and rudely pressing before the meek and virtuous -- I could
strip her of her gaudy trappings, and, to bring her to a just sense of her
infamous conduct, feed her upon bread and water, till convinced of the
necessity of repentance, she should gladly embrace the most servile employment,
and accept the meanest apparel, rather than return to her former life of vice
and dissipation.

How many families have been ruined by licentious women! How many virtuous
wives have sunk, brokenhearted, to the grave! how many innocent orphans have
been sent portionless into the world, through their diabolical machinations!
and, alas! (I shudder as the thought occurs) how many wretched women, forgetful
of their marriage vows, have relinquished a tender husband, a family of
children, whose innocent caresses should have linked her heart inseparably to
their father, and thrown herself into the arms of an abandoned libertine! --
let not such a woman plead seduction -- a married woman must, by her conduct,
give some encouragement before the most profligate man would dare offend her
ear with a declaration of love; and weak, very weak, must be her repulses, if
he ventures to persevere in his impious pursuit.

From the inmost recesses of my soul do I pity the unhappy girl, who, betrayed
by the impulse of affection, falls a prey to an insidious villain, and,
abandoned by her seducer, is exposed to the scorn and contempt of the world --
Oh! how my heart has been wrung to see poor girls, who are scarcely past their
childhood, whose misfortune it has been to have wicked advisers, so early
initiated into the school of vice. Their tender frames, which once perhaps, by
kind, paternal care, were shielded from the winds of Heaven -- now defenseless,
in the most inclement season, exposed to noxious damps and pinching cold, and
when they most stand in need of consolation, when bowed almost to the grave
with want, disease, and shame, to see them rest their wearied bones upon the
cold, damp pavement, and lay their aching heads upon the steps of an house
where a woman dwells, whose heart is a thousand times more guilty than theirs,
who sins without remorse, and riots in wealth and luxury.

I never see the poor mightly wanderers that infest our streets, but, spite of
my endeavors to the contrary, the tear of anguish will steal unbidden to my
eye.

Poor souls! I often say, poor, unhappy creatures, would to Heaven I had a
fortune capacious as my heart, that I might snatch you from perdition, and
teach you the road to everlasting felicity. I would guard you from the insults
of the world; I would cherish you, listen to all your tales of sorrow, and join
my tears with yours, till we had washed away the stains of guilt, and taught
you "that to be happy, is to be happy."

Oh! my fair countrywomen, turn not away from the plaints of misery; scorn not
the daughters of affliction; for, if by clemency and humanity you could draw
one miserable object from the thorny paths of vice, and restore her to peace
with her own soul, you would do an act more acceptable in the sight of your
Creator, than the man who bestows thousands for the endowment of an hospital --
the first action must proceed from innate goodness of the heart; the last may
from self-love -- a man may do a public act of benevolence to perpetuate his
name, and dignify himself with the title of generous; but that pure charity,
which leads us to forgive the failings of our fellow creatures, cheer the
desponding heart, and wipe the grief-swoln eye of an obscure individual, must
be the result of religion; it is a sort of benevolence which gratifies the
heart in performing good deeds, but blushes whenever those actions are repeated
-- It feels the most exalted pleasure in relieving a distressed fellow
creature, but it is pained to receive acknowledgements.

THE ARREST.
I WILL go and pay the disconsolate Hester a visit, said I, one morning as I
was rambling near Chelsea. I bent my steps toward her habitation; but had not
proceeded far, before I observed a young man, whose dress had formerly been
genteel, but was now shabby in the extreme; his hair had once been dressed, but
it might have been some three weeks or a month since; his coat was de coleur de
pace, but much the worse for wear, as the elbows discovered a very fine but
dirty shirt; his once satin waistcoat was threadbare and greasy, his breeches
loose and ragged at the knees; a pair of dirty silk stockings, ornamented with
here and there a hole, hung in a slovenly manner about his legs; and the sable
fril of his shirt, that peeped from his breast, was trimmed with the finest
edging -- That man has once been a coxcomb, said I; for I always judge, when I
see the remains of finery put on carelessly, or disfigured with dirt, that the
wearer has formerly been extravagant in his dress.

I approached the tattered beau, in order to take a view of his person, when I
discovered the features of my old acquaintance Mr. Woudbe.

And this is the end of ignorant pride, ostentation, and folly, said I -- no
doubt you would now be glad of a friend to administer to those wants which
henceforth you will learn to pity in others -- but I fear your conduct has been
such that you have no friends to apply to.

The thought was scarcely passed, before two disagreeable loking fellows came
up, and showing the trembling Woudbe a bit of parchment, he was forced to
surrender himself their prisoner.

Just at that time, a young man of fashion passing, and recollecting Woudbe,
accosted him with heigh! Jack, what! come to this already, I thought you would
have held it out a little longer -- ha! ha! what a rueful figure! -- all out at
the elbows, eh!

A truce with your sneers, Sir, said Woudbe, assuming an air of importance, I
stand in need of twenty pounds immediately -- you have frequently made me
offers of service; lend me that sum, and I shall be obliged to you.

Ah! Jack, said the other, that air and manner will not do now, it did very well
while the IN argent lasted, and you was a gentleman at large; but now you are
again plain Jack Woudbe, the Cabinet-maker; you must learn to bow, cringe, and
mind your business -- I am sorry it goes so hard with you; but depend upon it,
this will always be the case with young men of trifling fortunes, who ape the
manners, and launch into extravagancies, which are only becoming their
superiors -- I would lend you the money with all my heart, but I know you have
no way to repay it, and are too proud to go to work; therefore you had better
submit to your fate with a good grace.

The poor crest-fallen Woudbe walked away with his disagreeable companions, and
the stranger addressed himself to me -- that young man, Sir, said he, was the
son of an industrious tradesman, who, by strict attention to business, scraped
together about three or four thousand pounds; at his death this money was left
for his only son, who was then getting a little education at a cheap school in
the country.

When fifteen years old, he was apprenticed to a capital Cabinet-maker; a very
handsome premium was given with him; but he was too much of the gentleman to
attend to business, and when he came of age, he assumed the dress and manners
of a man of fashion; expensive amusements, treats, balls, and the retinue of
dissipation and folly were eagerly attended to -- but this would not last long;
it is now over; and even if he makes friends to get from his present
confinement, I know of no method he can pursue for future subsistence.

Such young men as these, said I, by their folly, are often involved in
difficulties, which, in hopes of extricating themselves from, they hurry to the
gaming table, and finding their expectations frustrated there also, as the last
resource, betake themselves to a black crape, a good horse, and a pistol. --
How careful should parents and guardians be to instill into the minds of youth
of narrow fortunes, meekness, humility, and industry! the least tendency to
thoughtless extravagance, in either sex, ought to be severely chastised; since
pride, and a passion for expensive pleasures, which they have no laudable
method to obtain, has hurried thousands into actions which imbitter the last
hours of life, with poverty, shame, and remorse.

As I finished these remarks, I looked up, expecting an answer from my
companion; but whether my discourse was too grave, or whether it touched his
feelings, or whether some other cause had occasioned him to leave me, I know
not, but he was gone; and on my turning round to look for him, I saw he was
hastily proceeding toward town.

How easy it is, said I, for a man to blame a conduct in others, which he is
eagerly pursuing himself; perhaps a few years may reduce that young man to the
same situation in which he now smiles to see Woudbe -- experience is
undoubtedly best when purchased; but Woudbe has, I fear, paid an exorbitant
price for his.

I was now opposite Vellum's house.

THE RETRIBUTION.
HAVING entered, by means of my ring, I proceeded, unseen, to Hester's
apartment -- she was greatly altered since the death of her father; a sickly
langour had taken possession of her features, she looked anxious and fatigued.

I wonder Harper is not returned* said she to a young woman who was with her: I
hope the dear Julietta is not worse.

She had hardly pronounced these words, before a post chaise stopped at the
door, and, in a few moments, the injured orphan entered, leaning on the arm of
an elderly woman; an universal trembling seized on Hester, when she beheld the
ravages which sickness and ill usage had made on the form of her lovely friend;
she led her to a sopha, dropped on her knees before her, and gazing at her with
a lock that spoke the keen anguish of her soul, took her thin hands in hers,
and burst into tears.

Do you not know me, my sweet friend? said she, after a long and affecting
silence; will you not speak to me, Julietta?

Hester, said she, bowing her head forward, and leaning her cheek upon that of
her weeping friend, Hester, why are you so sorrowful? and why are you dressed
in black? are you an orphan, Hester?

Oh? had it pleased Heaven I had been, cried Hester, earnestly, rather than
you, dear, injured angel, had been reduced to this hapless state.

Alas! said Julietta, why would you wish to be an orphan, to have a cruel
guardian, to lose your brother, to eat dry bread and drink cold water, and lie
upon a wretched bed of straw? you could not bear it, dear Hester; you would die
of a broken heart -- for my part, I am used to it; I can bear it very well;
then let me return to my little hut again -- if my guardian knew I had left it,
he would be very angry.

And have you suffered all this? cried Hester, weeping bitterly. Oh! Julietta,
you never shall return to that sad place again; your cruel guardian is dead.

Dead! cried Julietta, raising her hands and eyes in a supplicating manner;
then Heaven have mercy on him.

And what do you think of the poor girl's case? said Hester, as she re-entered
the room with Dr. M --, after they had persuaded Julietta to go to bed.

The doctor gave her great hopes that kind and affectionate treatment would
soon entirely restore her reason, which he imagined was already beginning to
return.

Could I but see that happy day, said she, and deliver her fortune into her own
hands, I should have no farther business in this world.

How so, my young friend? said the Doctor, with a look of surprise; I think you
have a great deal of business in the world yet; why sure, with all your
goodness and accomplishments, you would not shut yourself up in a convent?

Why no, said she; I am not a sufficient convert to the catholic religion to
imagine it absolutely necessary to shut ourselves up within the walls of a
prison to avoid the temptations of the world* but, I think, a person may in
solitude better practice those virtues so necessary to our well doing
hereafter, than in the noise and hurry of the more busy scenes of life. -- By
solitude, I do not mean to retire to a desert, and shut myself from the
converse and society of my fellow creatures; I mean a calm retirement, far from
folly and dissipation, where I may consult my own heart on the propriety and
equity of all my actions, without incurring the sneers and ridicule of the
world. As to the wealth which my poor unhappy father hoarded, it does not
belong to me; it is the property of the widow and the fatherless.

Here her tears interrupted her.

After this declaration, Doctor, she, continued, you will not be surprised at
my resolution of retiring from the gay scenes of life; and, I flatter myself, I
shall in time regain that serenity of mind a series of uncommon trials have
robbed me of.

The Doctor was too much affected to reply; he pressed her hand, struggled hard
to suppress a rising tear, and making a hasty bow, left the room.

A few weeks restored Julietta to reason, health, and spirits; when Hester,
having resigned her fortune to her own care, and made ample retribution of
those sums her father had appropriated to his own use, during the insanity of
his ward, retired to a village, in a county far distant from London, and spent
the remainder of her life in administering to the wants of the helpless and
distressed.

Her friendship for Julietta ceased but with her life; and many summers has
that amiable girl spent with her, uniting in every action of benevolence, and
shedding peace and plenty around them; the villagers adored them while living,
and mourned with unaffected sorrow when deprived by death of their
benefactresses.

THE CITY HEIRESS.
I WILL have the most elegant that is to be had, Mamma, cried a young lady, as
she came out of a carriage, and ran into a milliner's shop, which I had entered
to buy some little presents for Harriet and Lucy.

Do not let me detain you from waiting on the ladies, said I to the mistress of
the shop, for I was willing to see to what lengths this girl's extravagance
would take her.

I want a bouquet, Mrs. Frippery, said she; come, show me some of the
handsomest you have.

The counter was in an instant overspread with roses, carnations, lilies,
jessamine, and other flowers innumerable; it looked like the temple of Flora;
but I should by no means have taken the young lady for divinity of the place,
as she was a little swarthy figure, with small black eyes, a good deal marked
with the small pox, and something inclined to be crooked. -- Nature might have
made her really so, but her stay-maker had found out a method, in a great
measure, to hide the defect; her hair was dressed to the extremity of the
fashion; her bonnet, which was large, and loaded with trimmings, placed on the
left side of her head; a train of rich satin swept the ground as she walked*
the prominence of her handkerchief almost hid her chin; and her cheeks wore the
tints of some of the best rouge. -- It is astonishing, said I, as I sat looking
at her, that a woman to whom nature has not been lavish in personal
attractions, should take such pains by their outre manner of dressing* entirely
to obscure the few charms with which they are endued, and make their defects
conspicuous.

I was roused from these reflections by the Lady's bidding five guineas for as
many flowers.

But really, Mrs. Frippery, said she, have you none more elegant?

Why, my dear Miss, said the woman, I have one, but it is positively bespoke by
the Duchess of Melvin, and it likewise comes rather high: -- it cannot go out
of my shop under seven guineas -- though there are not more flowers in it than
in the one you have chosen.

The flowers were produced, the Lady insisted on having them, and the money was
paid.

It is a doubt with me* said I, whether the poor mortal whose industry and
ingenuity formed those pretty ornaments, scarcely earns more than enough to
support nature; and yet this thoughtless girl has paid seven guineas for them,
merely because they were bespoke by the Duchess of Melvin.

Just as the Ladies were about leaving the shop, a smart man, dressed like an
officer, whose language spoke him hibernian, desired to look at some point
ruffles; he advanced to the counter at which the young Lady sat, and while he
seemed busy at looking at the ruffles* took an opportunity to slip a letter
into her hand unperceived by her mother. -- I shall again have recourse to my
ring, said I, for if I am not mistaken, that man is a fortune-hunter.

That young Lady, said Mrs. Frippery, as they drove from the door, is the only
child of Alderman Fig -- she is heiress to a vast fortune.

Two fat old gentlemen passing just then, she informed me that one of them was
Mr. Fig himself.

I had made my purchases, so I stepped out of the shop and followed the
Alderman.

THE DISAPPOINTMENT.
I HAVE been out on purpose to get an appetite, said Mr. Fig; -- I think it was
the largest turtle I ever saw; and my friend Dip always has his turtles so well
dressed, that I long for the hour of dinner. I will just step home and change
my wig, and be with you again immediately.

Then this is the time* said I, for me to get admission. -- I put my hand in my
pocket for my ring -- but it was gone -- I searched every pocket diligently,
but no ring could I find. I returned to the millner's shop, and from thence
home -- searched my bed -- had every room in the house swept; but it was all to
no purpose. -- I never saw it again.

And pray, Mr. Inquisitor, what became of the City Heiress?

Upon my word, Madam, I never heard.

FINIS.
