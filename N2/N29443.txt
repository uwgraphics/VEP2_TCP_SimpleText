An Advertisement.
WHereas the Lands of Narrhaganset, and Niantick Countries, and parts adjacent,
are places very pleasant and fertile, fit and commodious for plantation, and
several Townships; the true and legal Right whereof belongs to certain
Gentlemen in New England, (the most part of them dwelling within the Colony of
the Massachusetts) by purchase from the chief Sachims, that were sole
Proprietors of the same; and was long since allowed and approved by the
Honored Commissioners of the united Colonies, and recorded in the Book of
Records for the Colony of Connecticot, under which Government and Jurisdiction
the Land aforesaid lies.

These are therefore to certify and inform all Christian People, that are
willing or may be desirous to settle themselves in a regular way of Townships
on the said Lands, that they may please to apply themselves to the Subscribers
hereof in Boston, who are by the said Gentlemen, the Proprietors, chosen and
appointed a Committee to act in any of their Concerns touching the Premises;
with whom all such Persons may treat and agree on very easy and reasonable
Terms.

Dated in Boston the 30 th. of July* 1678. Simon Bradstreet. John Saffin.
Elisha Hutchinson.
