At A COUNCIL Held at Boston, September the seventeenth 1675
I T having pleased the HOLY GOD ( all whose works are Truth, and his ways
judgment) for our sins whereby he has been provoked, in special by the
undervaluation of our pleasant things; great unthankfulness for, and manifold
abuses of our wonderful peace, and the blessings of it in this good Land which
the Lord has Given us; Ill entertainment of the Ministry of the precious
Gospel of Peace: leaving our first Love, dealing falsely in the Covenant of the
Lord our God: the Apostasy of many from the Truth unto Heresies, and pernicious
Errors. Great Formality, Inordinate Affection, and sinful Conformity to this
present evil vain World: and (beside many horrid and Scandalous Sins breaking
forth among us, for which we have Cause to be greatly humbled before the Lord),
our great unsensibleness of the displeasure of the Lord in suffering these
abominations to be perpetrated, together with our Carnal Security, and
unquietness under the Judgments of God upon us, our abiding very much
unreformed, notwithstanding all warnings, and Chastisements, whereby the Lord
has been, and is still debating with us; we having greatly Incensed him to
stir up many Adversaries against us, not only abroad, but also at our own
doors, (Causing the Heathen in this wilderness to be as thorns in our sides,
who have formerly been, and might still be a wall unto us therein; and others
also to become a Scourge unto us) the Lord himself also more Immediately
afflicting us by diseases whereof so many Children in some of our Towns have
died this Summer. His not going forth with our Armies as in former times, but
giving up many of our Brethren to the mouth of the devouring Sword, yea,
showing himself angry with the Prayers of his people: threatening us also with
Scarcity of Provision and other Calamities, Especially if this present War
with the barbarous Heathen should continue; And that the Lord of Hosts himself
withdraw not the Commission he has given to the Sword and other Judgments to
prevail against us;

The GOVERNOR and COUNCIL of this Jurisdiction therefore ( being under the
Sense of these evils; and also of the distressed state of the rest of the
Colonies Confederate with our selves, and of the Churches of Christ in other
parts of the Christian World; in this day of trouble, rebukes, and blasphemy:
and fearing the sad Issue thereof, unless the Lord help us with our whole
heart, and not feignedly, to turn unto himself) Do Appoint an Order the seventh
day of the new Month; to be a day of public Humiliation, with Fasting, and
Prayer; throughout this whole Colony; that we may set our selves sincerely to
seek the Lord, rending our hearts, (...) our Garments before him, and pursue
the same with a thorough Reformation of (...), or is an Image of Jealousy
before the Lord to offend the eyes of his (...) Lord may turn from his fierce
anger, that we perish not: We do therefore (...) this Jurisdiction to so bear
Servile Labor upon that day, and (...) respectively to (...) the same, as is
Appointed.
