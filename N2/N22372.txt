SOCIAL HARMONY; OR, THE CHEERFUL SONGSTER's COMPANION.

The vocal muse has power
To sooth the troubled breast
To cheer the darkest hour,
And lull each grief to rest;
To banish sorrow, care and strife,
And give a double (...) to life.
NEW YORK: Printed by SAMUEL CAMPBELL, No. 124, Pearl-Street. M.DCC.XCV.

SOCIAL HARMONY; OR, THE CHEERFUL SONGSTER'S COMPANION.
THE OLYMPIAN HUNT.
Bards call themselves a heavenly race,
Topers find heaven in wine,
We truly boast who love the chase
An origin divine.
The deities all hunters are,
Great Jove, who spends his life
In hunting of the willing fair,
Is hunted by his wife.
Then come and wake the drowsy morn,
While the swift game we follow,
The feathered throng and tuneful horn
Shall join the hunters hollow.
Gay Ba^chus on his tun, that hack,
Toasts for view hollows gives
While Mercury, with his Bow-street pack,
Scours heaven to hunt for thieves.
Bold Mars, a blood hound, hunts for fams,
No^ 'till it is latest breath,
Will he ever leave the panting game,
But comes in at the death.
Then come, etc.
Dians in her sacred grove
Saw rash Acteon near,
And though she seemed to scorn his love,
She took him for her deer.
Yet vexed to think this hint so sly
On the fool she could not pass,
From his own hounds she made him fly,
And killed him for an ass.
Then come, etc.
Great Jun^ wretched, restless fair,
On jealous fury bent,
Still in full cry is hunting care,
And still on a wrong scent.
Indeed the fair often mount their nag,
By the hunting mania struck,
And if Acteon was a stag,
Poor Vulcan was a buck.
Then come, etc.
MORALITY IN THE FORE-TOP.
Two real tars, whom duty called
To watch in the fore-top,
Thus one another over-haul'd,
And took a cheering drop.
I say, Will Hatchway; cried Tom Tow,
Of conduct what is your sort,
As through the voyage of life you go,
To bring you safe to port?
Cried Jack, you lubber, don't you know
Our passions close to reef?
To steer where honor points the prow,
To hand a friend relief,
These anchors get but in your power,
My life for it that is your sort,
The bower, the sheet, and the best bower,
Must bring you into port.
Why then you're out, and there is an end,
Tom cried out, blunt and rough,
Be good, be honest, serve a friend
The maxim's well enough;
Who swabs his bows at other's wo^,
That tar's for me your sort,
The vessel right ahead shall go,
To find a joyful port.
The storms of life upon me press,
Misfortunes make me reel,
Why, damme, what is my own distress,
For others let me feel?
Ay, ay, if bound with a fresh gale,
To heaven this is your sort,
A handkerchief's the best w^^ sai^
To bring you safe to port.
SWIZZY.
If, bold and brave thou can not bear
Thyself from all thou love to tear;
If while winds, war, and billows roll,
A spark of fear invade thy soul.
If you are appalled when cannons roar,
I prithee, mess mate, stay on shore.
There like a lubber
Whine and blubber:
Still for thy ease and safety busy,
Never dare to come
Where honest Tom,
And Ned and Nick, and Ben and Phil,
And Jack and Dick, and Bob and Bill,
All weathers sing and drink the swizzy.
If should' ^^ou lose a limb in fight,
She who made up thy heart's delight,
Poor recompense, that thou art kind,
Shall prove inconstant as the wind:
If such hard fortune thou deplore,
I prithee, mess-mate, stay on shore.
There, etc.
If prisoner in a foreign land,
No friend, no money at command,
That man thou trusted have alone
All knowledge of thee should disown.
If this should vex thee to the core,
I prithee, mess-mate, stay (...) shore.
There, etc.
FAMILY LIKENESS,
Lovely woman, pride of nature,
Good and sweet, and kind and fair,
Than man a higher style of creature,
Perfect as celestials are.
See Mira come, like stately Juno,
Ever fair, and ever young,
Completely like, as you and I know,
For Mira, like Juno, has a tongue.
Young Caelia's charms, that beam so sweetly,
To paint, ah! what can words avail,
She Is Venus self, and so completely,
That Caelia is, like Venus frail.
To woo the charming Gloriana
Audacity would be afraid;
She Is chaste and icy as Diana,
And, like Diana, an old maid.
Thus women boast a near relation,
It Is plain to the celestial race;
Thus we of their divine creation,
A family resemblance trace.
If then some faults of this complexion,
Like spots that is on that sun their fame,
Rust this same model of perfection,
The stars, not women are to blame,
BUXOM NAN.
The wind was hushed, the storm was over,
Unfurled was every flowing sail,
From toil released, when Dick of Dover
Went with his mess-mates to regale.
All dangers over, cried he, my neat hearts,
Drown care then in the smiling can;
Come, bear a hand, let us toast our sweethearts,
And first I Will give my Buxom Nan.
She Is none of they that is always gigging,
And stem and stern made up of art;
One knows a vessel by her rigging,
Such ever slight a constant heart.
With straw hat and pink streamers flowing,
How often to meet me has she ran,
While for dear life would I be rowing,
To meet with smiles, my Buxom Nan.
Jack Jollyboat went to the Indies;
To see him stare when he came back;
The girls were so all off the hinges,
His Poll was quite unknown to Jack.
Tant masted all to see who is tallest,
Breast works, top ga'nt sails and a fan,
Mess-mate, said I, more sail than ballast,
Ah! still give me my Buxom Nan.
None on life's sea can sail more quicker,
To show her love or serve a friend,
But hold, I Am preaching over my liquor.
This one word then, and there is an end,
Of all the wenches whatsomdever,
I say, then find me out who can,
One half so true, so kind, so clever,
Sweet trim, and meat as Buxom Nan.
PLEASURES OF THE CHASE.
Except the folks that is fast asleep,
All nature now is waking,
Aurora at the world a peep
Is in her nightcap taking,
Hark, all the rory tory boys,
Making the devil of a noise,
To cure the head aches of last night,
The peaceable King's subjects fright,
And helter skelter come apace,
To enjoy the pleasures of the chase.
How sweet to be as on we rush,
By the pig-tail entangling,
Amidst a lovely torny bush,
Or on a tree left dangling,
Ah musha gra, than wine and love
The joy of hunting's far above.
Can either Cupid or the bowl
Such pleasures give? Ah by my soul,
Briars and torns may scratch your face,
Still great's the pleasures of the chase.
Then when our metal's at its pitch,
While tally-ho we are bawling,
Safe landed in a muddy ditch,
To be genteelly sprawling.
Ah musha gra, than wine and love
The joy of hunting's far above;
Can either Cupid or the bowl
Such pleasure give? Ah by my soul,
Briars and torns may scratch your face,
Still great's the pleasures of the chase.
Then dripping like a drowning rat,
At night you would not think it,
What glorious wine, if it were not
We Are too fatigued to drink it.
Ah bodder not of love and war,
The joy of hunting's greater far,
Hark, echo in melodious tones,
Halloos and whistles, sighs and groans
While many a broken sconce and face
Proclaim the pleasures of the chase.
A SAVAGE LOVE SONG.
So sweet I Will dress my Zootka fair,
Such pretty toys her charms shall deck,
The nails of foes shall grace her hair,
Their eyes and teeth adorn her neck.
A hut I Will build her of catalps,
And sweetly hang it round with scalps,
And while we frantic skip and sing,
And join to form the mystic ring,
And tymbals bang and cymbals twang,
And cymbals twang and tymbals bang,
And jump and prance,
And frisk in wedlock's devious dance,
We'll drink and yam,
And make the Banjier cry giam.
The rose Europe's beauties boast,
Asia, the saffron's silkly dye,
Let ebon wives grace Afric's coast,
Can these with lovely Zootka vie?
Her olive cheek the gloss outshines
That decorates the copper mines.
Come then, and frantic, etc.
Some shave their eyebrows for the fair,
Others for love pull out their teeth,
Some by the roots tear up their hair,
To form a pretty marriage wreath,
My loving feet at Zootka's nose
Shall aim a hundred tender blows,
And as they frantic, etc.
THE SHIPWRECK.
Avert yon omen, gracious heaven!
The ugly scud,
By rising winds resistless driven,
Kisses the flood.
How hard the lot for sailors cast,
That they should roam
For years, to (...) perish thus at last,
In sight of ^ome.
For of the com^ing gale we mourn,
A tempest g^ows,
Our vessel shatt^er'd, so and torn,
That down sh^e goes.
The tempest com^es, while meteors red,
Portentous fly,
And now we touch old Ocean's bed,
Now reach the sky.
On sable wings in gloomy flight,
Frien^ds seem to wait,
To snat^^ us in this dreadful night,
Dark as our fate;
Unless some kind, some pitying power
Should ^ interpose;
She labors so, within this hour,
That down she goes.
But see on rosy pinions born,
Over the mad deep,
Reluctant beams the sorrowing morn,
With ^s to weep.
Deceitful sorrow, cheerless light,
Dreadful to think,
The morn is risen in dreadful night
Our hope, to sink,
She splits, she starts, through sluices driven,
The water flows.
Adieu, ye friends, have mercy heaven,
For down she goes.
SONG. FARMER.
A flaxen-headed cow-boy,
As simple as may be,
And next a merry plough-boy,
I whistled over the lea:
But now a saucy footman,
I strut in worsted lace,
And soon I Will be a butler,
And wag my jolly face.
When steward I Am promoted,
I Will snip a tradesman's bill.
My master's coffers empty,
My pockets for to fill:
When lolling in my chariot,
So great a man I Will be,
You Will forget the little plough-boy
That whistled over the lea.
I Will buy votes at elections,
But when I Have made the pelf,
I Will stand poll for parliament,
And then vote in myself:
Whatever's good for me, sir,
I never will oppose;
When all my AYES are sold off,
Why then I Will sell my NOES.
I Will joke, harangue, and paragraph,
With speeches charm the ear,
And when I Am tired on my legs,
Then I Will sit down a peer.
In court or city honor,
So great a man I Will be,
You Will forget the little plough-boy
That whistled over the lea.
THE MILLER.
Merry may the maid be
That marries the miller,
For foul day and ^air day
He Is ay bringing till her;
Has ay a penny in his purse
For dinner and for supper;
And gin she please a good fat cheese,
And lumps of yellow butter.
When Jemie first did woo me,
I spier'd what was his calling;
Fair maid, said he, O come and see,
You Are welcome to my dwelling:
Though I was shy, yet I could soy,
The truth of what he told me,
And that his house was warm and couth,
And room in it to hold me.
Behind the door a bag of meal,
And in the kissed was plenty
Of good hard cakes his mither bakes,
And bannocks were na scanty;
A good fat sow, a sleeky cow
Was standing in the byre;
Whilst lazy puss with mealy mouse,
Was playing at the fire.
Good signs are these, my mither says,
And bids me take the miller;
For foul day or fair day,
He Is ay bringing till her;
For meal and ma't she does na want,
Nor any thing that is dainty:
And now and then a keckling he^
To lay her eggs in plenty.
In winter when the wind and rain
Blaws over the house and byre;
He sits beside a clean hearth stane,
Before a rousing fire:
With nut-brown ale, he tells his tale*
Which rows him over fou ^appy;
Who'd be a king? -- a pretty thing,
When a miller lives so happy.
SONG.
Tune, Dus^y Night.
When first a maid within her breast,
Perceives the subtle flame,
She finds a something break her rest*
Yet knows not whence it came.
A husband it is she wants.
Now riper grown at fight of man,
Her swelling bosom glows;
Old maids, may say, the sex trepan,
But miss r^uch better knows,
A husband it is she wants.
If pale and wan the drooping fair,
Seems sinking in her grave;
It vain is medicinal care,
It Is this alone can save.
A husband it is I mean.
Let maidens stale their doctrine preach,
Against what like us they love;
For trust me they the same would teach,
If they the same could have.
A husband it is I mean.
Then on, dear girls, and boldly prove
There Is truth in what I say:
Let Hymen take the torch of love,
And gild cach happy day.
A husband it is I mean.
THE LAMPLIGHTER.
I Am jolly Dick the Lamplighter,
They say the Sun's my dad;
And truly I believe it, Sir,
For I Am a pretty lad.
ather and I the world delight,
And make it look so gay,
The difference is, I lights by night,
And father lights by day.
But father's not the likes of I,
For knowing life and fun,
For I strange tricks and fancy spy
Folks never show the sun.
Rogues, owls, and bats cannot bear the light*
I Have heard your wise ones say;
And so, do you mind, I sees, at night,
Things never seen by day.
At night men lay aside all art,
As quite a useless task,
And many a face and many a hear^
Will then pull off the mask.
Each formal prude, and hosy wight,
Will throw disguise away,
And sin it openly at night,
Who sainted it all day.
His darling hoard the miser views*
Misses from friends decamp,
And many a statesman mischief brews
To his country over his lamp.
So father and I, do you take me right,
Are just on the same lay*
I barefaced sinners light by night,
And he false saints by day.
I AM IN HASTE.
As cross the field the other morn
I tripp'd so blythe and gay,
The 'Squire with his dog and gun
By chance came by that way;
Whither so fast, young maid? he cried,
And caught me round the waist,
Pray stop awhile. Dear Sir, said I,
I cannot, for I Am in haste.
You must not go ^s yet, cried he,
For I have much to say;
Come, sit you down, and let us chat,
Upon this new-mown ^ay.
I Have loved you long, and often have wished
These ruby lips to taste;
I Will have a kiss. Well then, said I,
Be quick, for I Am at haste.
Just as he spoke, I saw young Hodge
Come through a neighboring gate,
He caught my hand, and cried, dear girl,
I fear I Have made you wait;
But here is the ring, come, let us to church,
The joys of love to taste;
I left the 'Squire, and laughing said,
You see, Sir, I Am in haste.
WHILE HIGH THE FOAMING SURGES RISE.
While high the foaming surges rise*
And pointed rocks appear,
Loud thunders rattle in the skies,
Yet sailors must not scar.
In storms in wind
Their duty mind;
A loft, below,
They cheerful go,
To reef or steer, as it is designed,
No fear or dangers fill the mind.
The fignal for the line is made,
The haughty foe's in sight;
The bloody ^lag's aloft displayed,
And fierce they dreadful fight.
Each minds his gun,
No dangers shun;
A loft, below,
They cheerful go,
Though thunders roar, yet still we find
No fears alarm the sailor's mind.
The storm is hushed, the battle's over,
The sky is clear again;
We toss the ^^^n to those on shore
While we are on the main,
To Poll and Sue,
Sincere and true;
The grog goes round,
With pleasure crowned,
In war or peace alike you will find
That honor fills the sailor's mind.
A LAUGHING SONG.
Come, ye wasting sons of care,
Live to laugh, and hang despair;
Pining grief is naught but folly,
Laugh with me, and be as jolly;
Ever thus your mirth shall flow.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ever thus your mirth shall flow,
Ha, ha, ha, ha, etc.
Columbians, thus be ever gay,
Come where laughter leads the way;
To the winds give simple sorrow,
Laugh today, and cry tomorrow:
Life's a jest, we wise ones know.
Ha, ha, ha, etc.
Since good humor here does reign,
With all my heart let us laugh again;
What dull mortal can withstand it,
When the gods and you command it?
True enjoyment here below
Is ha, ha, ha, etc.
THE LASS OF RICHMOND HILL.
On Richmond Hill there lives a lass,
More bright than May Day morn;
Whose charms all other maids surpass,
A rose without a thorn*
This lass so neat, with smiles so sweet,
Has won my right good will;
I Would crowns resign, to call her mine,
Sweet lass of Richmond Hill.
Ye zephyrs gay that fan the air,
And wanton through the grove!
O whisper to my charming fair --
I die for her and love.
This lass so neat, etc.
How happy will that shepherd be,
Who calls this nymph his own!
O may the choice be fixed on me!
Mine Is fixed on her alone.
This lass so neat, etc.
SONG. POOR SOLDIER.
Since love is the plan,
I Will love if I can --
Attend, and I Will tell you what sort of a man:
In address how complete,
And in dress spruce and neat*
No matter how tall so he is over five feet;
Not dull, nor too ^itty,
His eyes I Will think pretty,
If sparkling with pleasure whenever we meet.
In a song bear a bob,
In a glass of hob-nob,
Yet drink of his reason his noddle never rob;
Though gentle he be,
His man he shall see,
Yet never be conquered by any but me.
This, this is my fancy;
If such a man I can see,
I Am his if he is mine; until then, I Will be free.
THE ECHOING HORN.
The echoing horn calls the sportsman abroad,
To horse, my brave boys, and away;
The morning is up, and the cry of the hounds
Upbraids our too tedious delay,
What pleasures we find in pursuing the fox!
Over hill and over valley he flies:
Then follow, we'll soon overtake him, huzza,
The traitor is seized on and dies.
Triumphant returning at night with the spoil,
Like bacchanals shouting and gay,
How sweet with our bottle and glass to refresh
And lose the fatigues of the day!
With sport, love, and wine, sickle fortune defy,
Dull wisdom all happiness sours;
Since life is no more than a passage at best,
Let Us strew the way over with flowers.
SONG.
This, this my lad's a soldier's life,
He marches to the sprightly fife,
And in each town to some new wife
Swears he will be ever true.
He Is here, he is there, where is he not?
Variety's his envied lot;
He eats, drinks, sleeps, and pays no shot,
And follows the loud tattoo.
Called out to face his country's foes,
The tears of fond, domestic woes,
He kisses off, and boldly goes
To earn of fame his due.
Religion, liberty, and laws,
Both his are, and his country's cause,
For these through danger, without pause,
He follows the loud tattoo.
And if at last in honor's wars,
He earns his share of danger's scars, --
Still he feels bold, and thanks his stars
He Is no worse fate to rue.
At Chelsea, free from toil and pain,
He wields his crutch, points out the slain,
And, in fond fancy, once again
Follow the loud tattoo.
A FAVORITE SONG.
Jack Ratlin was the ablest seaman,
None like him could hand, reef, or steer:
No dangerous toil, but he would encounter
With skill, and in contempt of fear.
In fight a lion, -- the battle ended,
Meek as the bleating lamb he would prove;
Thus Jack had manners, courage merit,
Yet did he sigh, -- and all for love.
The song, the jest, the flowing liquor,
For none of these had Jack's regard:
He, while his messmates were carousing,
High sitting on his pending yard,
Would think upon his fair one's beauties,
Swear never from such charms to rove;
That truly he would adore them living,
And, dying, sigh -- to end his love.
The same express the crew commanded
Once more to view their native land,
Among the rest brought Jack some tidings;
Would it had been his love's fair hand!
Oh! Fate! her death defaced the letter --
Instant his pulse forgot to move!
With quivering lips, and eyes uplifted,
He heaved a sigh! -- and died for love.
BALLAD, IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT.
I was, do you see, a waterman,
As tight and spruce as any,
'Twixt Richmond town
And Horsly down
I earned an honest penny;
None could of fortune's favors brag
More than could lucky I,
My cot was snug, well filled my cag,
My grunter in the sty.
With wherry tight
And bosom light
I cheerfully did row,
And to complete this princely life,
Sure never man had friend and wife
Like my Poll and my partner Joe.
I rolled in joys like these awhile,
Folks far and near caressed me,
'Till woe is me,
So lubberly
The press gang came and pressed me:
How could I all these pleasures leave?
How with my wherry part?
I never so took on to grieve,
It wrung my very heart.
But when on board
They gave the word
To foreign parts to go,
I rued the moment I was born,
That ever I should thus be torn
From my Poll and my partner Joe.
I did my duty manfully,
While on the billows rolling,
And night and day
Could find my way
Blindfold to the main-top bowling:
Thus all the dangers of the main
Quicksands and gales of wind,
I braved in hopes to taste again
The joys I left behind:
In climes a^ar,
The hottest war,
Poured broadsides on the foe,
In hope these perils to relate,
As by my side attentive sat,
My Poll and my partner Joe.
At last it pleased his Majesty
To give peace to the nation,
And honest hearts,
From foreign parts,
Came home for consolation:
Like lightning -- for I felt new life,
Now safe from all alarms --
I rushed, and found my friend and wife
Locked in each other's arms!
Yet fancy not
I bore my lot
Tame, like a l^bber: -- No,
For seeing I was finely ^rick'd,
Plump to the devil I fairly kicked
My Poll and my partner Joe.
BALLAD, IN THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT.
I am a jolly fisherman,
I catch what I can get,
Still going on my betters' plan
All Is fish that comes to net:
Fi^ just like men, I Have often caught,
Crabs, gudgeons, poor John, codfish,
Ard many a time to market brought
A devilish sight of odd fish.
This all are fishermen through life,
With weary pains and labor,
This baits with gold, and that a wife,
And all to catch his neighbor:
Then praise the jolly fisherman,
Who takes what he can get,
Still going on his betters' plan,
All Is fish that comes to net.
The pike, to catch the little fry,
Extends his greedy jaw,
For all the world, as you and I
Have seen your man of law:
He who to laziness devotes
His time is sure a numb fish,
And members who gives silent votes
May fairly be called dumb fish.
False friends to eels we may compare,
The roach resembles true ones;
Like gold-fish we find old ones rare,
Plenty as herrings new ones.
Then praise, etc.
Like fish then mortals are a trade,
And trapp'd, and sold and bought,
The old wife and the tender maid,
Are both with tickling caught;
Indeed the fair are caught, it is said,
If you but throw the line in,
With maggots, flies, or something red,
Or any thing that is shining:
With small fish you must lie in wait
For those in high condition,
But it is alon^ a golden bait
Can catch a learned physician.
Then praise, etc.
SONG. IN LOVE IN A VILLAGE.
How blessed the maid whose bosom
No headstrong passion knows,
Her days in joys she passes,
Her nights in calm repose:
Where ever her fancy leads ^er,
No pain, no fear invades her,
But pleasure without measure,
From every object flows.
No pain, no fear, where ever she goes,
How blessed the maid whose bosom
No headstrong passion knows,
Her days in joy she passes,
Her nights in calm repose;
Where ever her fancy leads,
No pains no fears invades,
No fear invades, no fear invades.
I WOULD THINK ON THEE, MY LOVE.
In storms when clouds obscure the sky,
And thunders roll, and lightnings fly,
In midst of all these dire alarms,
I think, my Sally, on thy charms*
The troubled main,
The wind and rain,
My ardent passions prove,
Lashed to the helm,
Should seas overwhelm,
I Would think on thee my love.
When rocks appear on every side,
And art is vain the ship to guide,
In varied shapes when death appears,
The thoughts of thee my bosom cheers.
The troubled main,
The wind and rain,
My ardent passion prove,
Lashed to the helm,
Sold seas overwhelm,
I Would think on thee my love.
But should the gracious powers be kind,
Dispel the gloom and still the wind,
And waft me to thy arms once more,
Safe to my long-lost native shore:
No more the main,
I Would tempt again,
But tender joys improve;
I then with thee,
Should happy be,
And think on naught but love,
HOMEWARD BOUND.
Come loose every sail to the breeze,
The course of my vessel improve,
I Have done with the toils of the seas,
Ye sailors! I Am bound to my love,
Ye sailors! I Am bound to my love,
Ye sailors! I Am bound to my love.
I Have done with the toils of the seas,
Ye sailors! I Am bound to my love*
Since Emma is true as she is fair,
My griefs I fling all to the wind,
It Is a pleasing return for my cares;
My mistress is constant and kind.
My sails are all filled to my dear:
What tropick-bird swifter can move,
Who cruel shall hold his career,
That returns to the nest of his love.
Hoist every sail to the breeze,
Come, ship-mates, and join in the song:
Let Us drink while the ship cuts the seas,
To the gale that may drive her along.
DEAR IS MY NATIVE VALE.
Dear is my little native vale,
The ring-dove builds and warbles there;
Close by my cot she tells her tale
To every passing villager.
The squirrel leaps from tree to tree,
And shells his nuts at liberty.
In orange groves and myrtle bowers,
That breathe a gale of fragrance round,
I charm the fairy-footed hours
With my loved lute's romantic sound;
Or crowns of living laurel weave*
For those that win the race at eve.
The shepherd's horn, at break of day,
The ballad danced in twilight glade;
The canzolet and roundelay,
Sung in the silent greenwood shade.
These simple joys that never fail,
Shall bind me to my native vale*
MARY's DREAM.
The moon had clim'd the highest hill
That rises over the source of Dee,
And from the eastern summit shed
Her silver light on tower and tree;
When Mary laid her down to sleep,
Her thoughts on Sandy far at sea,
When soft and low a voice was heard
Say -- Mary, weep no more for me.
She from her pillow gently raised
Her head to ask who there might be,
And saw young Sandy shivering stand,
With palid cheek and hollow eye.
O, Mary dear! cold is my clay,
It lies beneath a stormy sea;
Far, far from thee, I sleep in death,
So, Mary, weep no more for me.
Three stormy nights and stormy days,
We tossed upon the raging main,
And long we strove our bark to save,
But all our striving was in vain:
Even then, when horror chilled my blood,
My heart was filled with love for thee;
The storm is past, and I at rest,
So, Mary, weep no more for me;
O! maiden dear, thyself prepare,
We soon shall meet upon that shore
Where love is free from doubt or care,
And thou and I shall part no more.
Loud crow'd the cock! the shadow fled!
No more of Sandy could she see;
But soft the passing spirit said,
O! Mary! weep no more for me.
THE TARTAN PLAYED.
By moonlight on the green,
Where lads and lasses stray,
How sweet the blossomed bean,
How sweet the new-made hay.
But not to me sae sweet
The blossom of the thorn,
As when my lad I meet
More fresh than May Day morn.
Give me the lad so blithe and gay*
Give me the tartan plad^ie;
For spite of all the world can say,
I Will wed my Highland Laddie.
His skin is white as snow,
His ^^n are bonny blue;
Like rose-bud sweet his mow,
When wet with morning dew.
Young Will is rich and great.
And fain would ^a' me his;
But what is pride or state
Without love's smiling bliss.
Give me the lad, etc.
When first he talked of love,
He looked so blithe and gay,
His flame I did approve,
And could nae say him nay.
Then to the kirk I Will haste,
There prove my love and truth;
Reward a love so chaste,
And wed the constant youth.
Give me the lad, etc.
SONG. POOR SOLDIER.
The wealthy fool, with gold in store,
Will still desire to grow richer?
Give me but these, I ask no more,
My charming girl, my friend and pitcher
My friend so rare, my girl so fair,
With these what mortal can be richer?
Give me but these, a fig for care,
With my sweet girl, my friend, and pitcher.
From morning sun I Would never grieve
To toil a hedger or a ditcher,
If that when I come home at eve
I might enjoy my friend and pitcher.
My friend so rare, etc.
Though fortune ever shuns my door,
I know not what it is can bewitch her;
With all my heart -- can I be poor,
With my sweet girl, my friend, and pitcher.
My friend so rare, etc.
SONG.
When Britain first at Heaven's command,
Arose from out the azure main,
Arose, etc.
This was the charter, the charter of the land,
And guardian angels sung the strain;
Rule, Britannia, Britannia, rule the waves,
For Britons never will be slaves.
The nations not so blessed as thee,
Must in their turns to tyrants fall,
Must, etc.
Whilst thou shall flourish, shall ^lourish great and free,
The dread and envy of them all.
Rule, Britannia, etc.
^till more majesti^ shall thou rise --
More dreadful from each foreign stroke*
^ore dreadful, etc.
^^ the loud blast that tears the skies*
Serves but to root thy native oak*
Rule, Britannia, etc.
Thee haughty tyrants never shall ^ame;
All their attempts to bend thee down,
All their, etc.
Will but arouse, arouse thy generous flame,
And work their woe, and thy renown.
Rule, Britannia, etc.
To thee belongs the rural reign --
Thy cities shall with commerce shine,
Thy cities, etc.
All thine shall be, shall be the subject main,
And every shore it circles thine.
Rule, Britannia, etc.
The Muses, still with freedom found,
Shall to thy happy coast repair,
Shall, etc.
Blessed isle! with beauty, with matchless beauty crowned,
And manly hearts to guard the fair.
Rule, Britannia, Britannia rule the waves,
For Britons never will be slaves.
NOTHING LIKE GROG.
A plague of these musty old l^bbers,
W^^ (...) us to fast and to think,
And patient fall in with life's rubbers,
With nothing but water to drink.
A can of ^^^d stuff, had they twigg'd it,
Would have set them for pleasure agog,
And spite of the rules,
The rules of the schools,
The old fools would have all of them swigg'd it,
And swore there was nothing like grog.
My father, when last I from Guinea
Returned with abundance of wealth,
Cried, Jack, never be such a ninny
To drink; -- says I, -- father your health!
So I passed round the stuff, and he twigg'd it,
And it set the old codger agog;
And he swigg'd and mother,
And sister, and brother,
And I swigg'd, and all of us swigg'd it,
And swore there was nothing like grog.
One day, when the chaplin was preaching.
Behind him I curiously slunk,
And, while he our duty was teaching,
As how we should never get drunk,
I tipped him the stuff, and he twigg'd it,
Which soon set his reverence agog:
And he swigg'd, and Nick swigg'd,
And Ben swigg'd, and Dick swigg'd,
And I swigg'd, and all of us swigg'd it,
And swore there was nothing like grog.
Then trust me, there is nothing as drinking
So pleasant on this side the grave,
It keeps the unhappy from thinking,
And m^ke em more valient, more brave.
For me, from the moment I twigg'd it,
The good stuff has set me agog,
Sick or well, late or early,
Wind foully or fairly,
I Have constantly, constantly swigg'd it:
And d -- n me, there is nothing like grog.
TRUE FRIENDSHIP.
Blessed friendship, hail! thy gifts possessing,
That happy mortal's rich indeed,
Thou willing giv'st each earthly blessing,
To all but those who are in need.
Thy words are sweet as Hybla's honey,
In accents kind, and mild, and civil
Flows thy advice, thou giv'st not money,
For money is the very devil;
And rather than the foul temptation
Sold into scrapes thy friend betray,
Disinterested consideration,
Thou kindly takes it all away.
Are his affairs at rack and manger,
Lest a bad world thy friend should chouse
No time for thee to play the stranger,
Thou deign'st to manage all his house,
To make hi^^ thy good pleasure tarry,
To kiss thy feet, to hop over sticks,
To run, to leap, to fetch and carry,
And play a thousand monkey tricks.
Nay, if thy liquorish chops would water,
To ease him of domestic strife,
Thou ridd'st him of a flirting daughter,
Or, kinder still, thou steal'st his wife.
Come then, my friend, prevent my pleasures,
And out of ^oors politeness kick,
With me, and mine, pray keep no measures,
Drench me with bumpers, make me sick;
My cellar bleed, devour my mutton,
Upon my vitals dine and sup;
Come on thou kind, thou friendly glutton,
Kill, barbecue, and eat me up.
Then, to the last a friend, desert me,
That wise by dear experience grown,
And having no kind friend to hurt me,
I may, at last, become my own.
PATRICK O'ROW.
Patrick O'Row is my name,
My calling's the trade of a boxer,
I Am a devil of a fellow for same,
Why I Am bottom like any game cock, Sir.
Oh, I tips 'em so tight,
Left and right,
And to blind him so well I know how,
To the spine of the back. I am blood,
Ah, honey, 'twou'd do your heart good,
To be lather'd by Patrick O'Row.
I presently knocks down my men,
Your servant, says I, pray call again;
Then I close up their peepers, and then,
I wish you good night, Mr. Galahgan.
Were alive Master Slack,
On his back
I Would lay him as flat as he is now.
It Is my washing, my lodging and food,
Ah, honey, 'twoud do your heart good
To be lather'd by Patrick O'Row.
There Is Johnson, and George, and Big Ben,
Three bruisers that well can rally you,
Though they thump'd the three Birmington men,
Say I, my lads, little I value you.
Mendoza and Ward
Can strike hard,
And to stop and put in, well know how;
Nay, they are every reaf of them blood,
Yet, honey, 'twoud do them all good
To be lather'd by Patrick O'Row.
Wid a handful of fellows like these,
Britannia, what glory I Would bring her to;
Let the Spaniards come on when they please,
Devil burn me, we'd teach them a ting or two.
Wid a phalanx of fists
In our lists,
So nately we'd bodder their glow,
We'd presently try if they are blood.
Ah, honey, 'twou'd do their pride good
To be lather'd by patrick O'Row.
Come all ye tight lads who would earn
True fame, in a possee gather ye,
How your country you would serve would ye learn,
Just only come here till I lather you.
Oh, I Will make you so tight,
Left and right,
And each knock me down argument know;
Come here then, and try if you're blood.
Devil burn me, 'twou'd do your hearts good
To be lather'd by Patrick O'Row.
SOUND ARGUMENT.
We bipeds, made up of frail clay,
Alas are the children of sorrow,
And though brisk and merry today,
We all may be wretched tomorrow.
For sunshine's succeeded by rain,
Then, fearful of life's stormy weather,
Lest pleasure should only bring pain,
Let us all be unhappy together.
I grant the best blessings we know
Is a friend, for true friendship's a treasure,
And yet, lest your friend prove a foe,
Oh taste not the dangerous pleasure:
Thus friendship's a flimsy affair,
Thus riches and health are a bubble,
Thus there is nothing delightful but care,
Nor any thing pleasing but trouble.
If a mortal would point out that life
That on earth could be nearest to heaven,
Let him, thanking his stars, choose a wife
To whom truth and honor are given:
But honor and truth are so rare,
And horns when they are cutting so tingle
That with all my respect to the fair,
I Would advise him to sigh and live single.
It appears from these premises plain
That wisdom is nothing but folly,
That pleasure's a term that means pain,
And that joy is your true melancholy.
That all those who laugh ought to cry,
That it is fine frisk and fun to be grieving,
And that, since we must all of us die,
We should taste no enjoyment while living.
KATE OF ABERDEEN.
The silver moon's enamored beam
Steals softly through the night*
To wanton with the winding stream,
And kiss reflecting light;
To courts be gone, heart-soothing sleep,
Where you have so seldom been,
Whilst I May's wakeful vigil keep
With Kate of Aberdeen.
The nymphs and swains expectant wait,
In primrose chaplets gay,
Till morn unbars her golden gate,
And gives the promised May;
The nymphs and swains shall all declare
The promised May, when seen,
Not half so fragiant, half so fair,
As Kate of Aberdeen.
I Will tune my pipe to playful notes,
And rouse your nodding grove,
Till new-wak'd birds distend their throats,
And hail the maid I love:
At her approach the lark mistakes,
And quits the new dressed green:
Fond birds, it is not the morning breaks,
It Is Kate of Aberdeen.
Now blithsome over the dewy mead,
Where elves disportive play,
The festal dance young shepherds lead,
Or sing their love-tun'd lay,
Till May in morning-robe draws nigh,
And claims a virgin queen;
The nymphs and swains exulting cry,
"Here Is Kate of Aberdeen."
THE LINNETS.
As bringing home the other day
Two linnets I had taken,
The pretty warblers seemed to pray
For liberty again.
Unheedful of their plaintive notes,
I sang across the mead;
In vain they tuned their downy throats,
And fluttered to be freed.
As passing through the tufted grove
Near which my cottage stood,
I thought I saw the queen of love
When Chlora's charms I viewed.
I gazed, I loved, I pressed her stay
To hear my tender tale;
But all in vain, she fled away,
Nor could my sighs prevail.
Soon through the wound which love had made,
Came pity to my breast;
And thus I as compassion bade,
The feathered pair addressed:
"Ye little warblers, cheerful be,
"Remember not ye flew:
"For I who thought myself so free,
"Am far more caught than you."
SONG.
When the men a courting came,
Flattering with their prittle prattle,
Of their follies I made game,
Rallied with my tittle tattle.
Cooing to me, wooing to me,
Teazing of me, pleasing of me,
Offering pelf, each silly elf
Come cooing, wooing, and bowing to me.
The divine, with looks demure,
Talked of tithes and eating plenty;
Showed the profits of his cure,
And vowed to treat me with each dainty.
Cooing to me, etc.
The learned sergeant of the law
Showed his parchments, briefs, and papers,
In his deeds I found a flaw,
So dismissed him in the vapors.
Cooing to me, etc.
Physic now displayed his wealth,
With his nostrums; but the fact is,
I resolved to keep my health,
Nor die a martyr to his practice.
Cooing to me, etc.
But at last a swain bowed low,
Candid, handsome, tall, and clever,
Squeezed my hand -- I cannot tell how,
But he won my heart for ever.
Cooing to me, wooing to me,
Teazing of me, pleasing of me,
Offering pelf, each silly elf,
I sent all other wooers from me.
LIFE's LIKE A SEA IN CONSTANT MOTION.
Life's like a sea in constant motion,
Sometimes high and sometimes low;
Where every one must brave the ocean,
Whatsoever winds do blow.
Though at night by squalls or showers,
Or driven by some gentle gales,
If dangers rise be ever ready
To manage well the swelling sails.
What, though the wayward winds should bluster,
Let us not give way to fear;
But all our patience let us muster,
And learn by reason how to steer;
Let judgment ever keep us steady.
For that is a balance seldom fails;
If danger's rise, be ever ready
To manage well the swelling sails.
Trust not too much your own opinion,
When the vessel's underway;
Let good examples be your dominion,
That will seldom lead astray.
But should thunder over you shudder,
Or Bore as over the surface rails,
Let good directions guide the rudder,
Whilst Providence conducts the sails.
When you are safe from dangers riding
In some favorite port or bay,
Hope, be the anchor you confide in,
Care awhile, in slumbers lay;
Next, each a can of liquor flowing,
And good fellowship prevails;
Let every heart with rapture glowing,
Drink, "Success unto the Sails!"
THE HONEY-MOON.
Would you know, my good friends, what the honey-moon is,
How long the duration, how perfect the bliss,
A proof may be found, and a sample be seen,
In some boarding school couple just left
Gretna-green.
My dearest, my duck,
My sweetest, my chuck;
Miss Kitty's an angel, her Billy's a god;
Whips crack, glasses jingle,
While sighs intermingle,
And Cupid assents, and goes nidditty nod,
Niddity nod, niddity nod,
Over Kitty the angel, and Billy the god.
Papa's and mama's surly tempers once past,
Bright Bloomsbury-square has this couple at last!
In three week's possession, how pleasure will cloy!
Neglect hurts the lady, and time cools the boy.
So impatient to roam; --
Ma'am, you're never at home,
A path so vexatious no wife ever trod;
My torment, my curse; --
You are bad -- you are worse.
While Cupid flies off, from a quarrel so odd,
Niddity nod, niddity nod,
And Miss is no angel, and Billy no god.
To routs hies the lady, to gambling goes master,
To part from each other, never couple went faster,
While raking at night, and distraction at noon,
Soon close all the joys of the sweet honeymoon.
Bleeding hearts, aching ^eads,
Separate tables and beds,
Renders wedlock's sweet countenance dull as a clod.
Then hie for a summons
From grave Doctors Commons,
While proctors and parchments go niddity nod,
Niddity nod, niddity nod,
Over Kitty the angel, and Bill the god.
SONG.
When fairies dance round on the grass,
Who revel all night in the roun'
Then say will you meet me, sweet lass,
Alone by the light of the moon?
Then say, etc.
First swear you will never deceive
The lass you have conquered so soon,
Nor leave a lost maiden to grieve,
Alone, by the light of the moon.
Nor leave, etc.
I swear to be constant and true,
Nor would I be false for a crown:
I Will meet you at twelve on the green,
Alone by the light of the moon.
I Will meet, etc.
The nightingale perched on the thorn,
Enchants every ear with her song,
And is glad on the absence of morn,
To salute the pale light of the moon.
And is, etc.
How sweet is the Jessamine grove!
How sweet are the roses in June!
More sweet is the language of love.
Breathed forth by the light of the moon.
More sweet, etc.
DOT AND CARRY ONE.
Pounds, Shillings, pence, and farthings, I
Have at my fingers end,
And how to sell, and how to buy,
To borrow of to lend;
But this, tho I never went to school,
My pate has run upon.
Addition be my golden rule,
Ha! dot and carry one.
At loss and gain a scholar got,
Right early was I taught
To gain of guineas all I could
To lose the devil a groat;
For fractions and divisions, when
They practice sword and gun,
Subtract myself I will, and then
Ha! dot and carry one.
But words no more I Will numerate,
And thus sum total lies:
Of war no more I Will sing or prate,
Reduction I Will despise:
And if cockade and roguish eye
Has not my Susan won;
If she is resolved to multiply,
Ha! dot and carry one.
THE SAILORS WATERY GRAVE.
While over the raging roaring seas,
The sailors heart is sore oppressed,
While landsmen safe, with health and ease,
For wives and children we have no rest;
To them perhaps never shall return,
Our little savings cannot save,
But we are lost and they long mourn,
The sailors cold! cold! watery grave.
Kind landsmen, oh! reflect a while,
The awful scenes that us befall,
On sailors orphans cast a smile,
Poor hearts! should they for pity call;
To them perhaps never to return,
Our little savings cannot save,
But we are lost! and they long mourn,
The sailors cold! cold! watery grave.
DRINK AND BE MERRY.
Wine, wine is the liquor of life;
The heart is consumed by care;
Good fellows then end the strife,
'Twixt the bottle and despair.
CHORUS.
Derry down, hey down derry,
Drink and drive care away;
Drink all the night and day,
Drink and be merry.
Brisk wine and impertinent care,
Dispute the control of me;
Let me be my master, despair,
Wine, thou shall my mistress be!
(...) Derry down, hey down derry,
Drink and drive care away;
Drink all the night and day,
Drink and be merry.
NANCY OF THE DALE.
My Nancy leaves the rural train,
A camp's distress to prove;
All other ills she can sustain,
But living from her love:
Yet, dearest, though your soldier's there,
Will not your spirit fail,
To mark the dangers you must share,
Dear Nancy of the dale?
Dear Nancy, etc.
Or should you, love, each danger scorn,
Ah! how shall I secure
Your health -- 'mid toils which you were born
To sooth -- but not endure:
A thousand perils I must view,
A thousand ills assail;
Nor must I tremble even for you,
Dear Nancy of the dale.
Dear Nancy, etc.
FLOWERS OF EDINBURGH
My love was once a bonny lad,
He was the flower of all his kin,
The absence of his bonny face
Has rent my tender heart in twain*
I day nor night find no delight,
In silent tears I still complain;
And exclaim against those my rival foes,
That ha'e taken from me my darling swain.
Despair and anguish fills my breast,
Since I have lost my blooming rose;
I sigh and moan while others rest,
His absence yields me no repose.
To seek my love I Will range and rove,
Through every grove and distant plain;
Thus I Will never cease, but spend my days,
To hear tidings from my darling swain.
There Is naething strange in nature's change,
Since parents show such cruelty;
They caused my love from me to range,
And knows not to what destiny.
The pretty kids and render lambs
May cease to sport upon the plain;
But I Will mourn and lament in deep discontent
The absence of my darling swain.
Kind Neptune, let me thee entreat,
To send a fair and pleasing gale;
Ye dolphins sweet, upon me wait,
And convey me on your tail;
Heavens bless my voyage with success,
While crossing of the raging main,
And send me safe over to that distant shore,
To meet my lovely darling swain.
All joys and mirth at our return
Shall then abound from Tweed to Tay:
The bells shall ring, and sweet birds sing,
To grace and crown out nuptial day.
Thus blessed wi' charms in my love's arms,
My heart once I will regain;
Then I Will range no more to a distant shore,
But in love will enjoy my darling swain.
PLATO's ADVICE.
Says Plato, why should man be vain,
Since bounteous heaven has made him great?
Why looks he with insolent disdain,
On those undeck'd with wealth or state!
Can costly robes or beds of down,
Or all the gems that deck the fair;
Can all the glories of a crown
Give health, or ease the brow of care?
The sceptered king, the burdened slave,
The humble and the haughty die:
The rich the poor, the base, the brave,
In dust, without distinction lie:
Go search the tomb where monarchs rest,
Who once the greatest titles wore,
Of wealth and glory they are berest,
And all their honors are no more.
So flies the meteor through the skies,
And spreads along a glided train;
When shot -- it is gone -- its beauty dies --
Dissolves to common air again;
So it is with us, my jovial souls,
Let friendship reign while here we stay;
Let Us crown our joys with flowing bowls.
When Jove commands we must obey.
THE DISCONSOLATE SAILOR.
When my money was gone that I gained in the wars,
And the world 'gan to frown on my fate;
What mattered my zeal or my honored scars,
When indifference stood at each gate.
The face that would smile when my purse was well lined,
Showed a different aspect to me;
And when that I could naught but ingratitude find,
I hi'd once again to the sea.
I thought it unwise to repine at my lot,
Or to bear with cold looks on the shore;
So I packed up the trifling remains I Would got,
And a tri^te, alas! was my store.
A handkerchief held all the treasure I had,
Which over my shoulder I threw;
Away then I tradg'd with a heart rather sad,
To join with some jolly ship's crew.
The sea was less troubled by far than my mind,
For when the wide main I surveyed,
I could not help thinking the world was unkind,
And fortune a slippery jade.
And I vowed if once more I could take her in tow,
I Would let the ungrateful one so:
That the turbulent winds and the billows could show,
More kindness than they did to ^me.
DANS VOTRE LIT.
Dans votre lit, my Fanny say,
When past the busy hours of day;
Stay and let me happy be,
To find you sometimes think on me.
Dans votre lit.
But whether absent or in view,
My thoughts are fondly bent on you;
When in my dreams I Am full of glee,
And in my arms embracing thee.
Dans votre lit.
But soon as dawn appears, my fair,
The blissful vision's lost in air;
Consent and you shall quickly set,
'Twill make it sweet reality.
Dans votre lit.
The soft confession make, my fair,
And with it glad my raptured ear;
And in return I Will swear to thee,
Ten thousand worlds I Would give to be
Dans votre lit.
THE JEW BROKER.
Ye jo^bers, underwriters, ye tribes of pen a^^ ink,
Wid my fall lal de ra, etc.
Who on the alley's gay parterre your tea and coffee drink,
Wid my fall lal de ra, etc.
Rattling up your yellow boys come hither at my call,
I Am buyer and I Am seller, and I can sa^ve you all,
Wid my fall lal de ra, etc.
Ye bulls, ye bears, ye lame ducks, and all the waddling crew,
If it was not for us smouch^rs, I don't know what you would do;
If ever you want shecurities, it is we that find good pail,
Our friends have got de tarnish -- but den they shometimes ^^il.
Wid my fall, etc.
If nobleman have lost race-horse, and all their money spent,
My heart it melts, I draw de pond, I lend for cent per cent;
But if a life you would insure dats old and crazy grown,
Do ways and means I Will let you know to get de business done.
Wid my fall, etc.
Ye captains and ye colonels, ye jointer'd widows all,
To little Isaac come when your stocks begins to fall;
I Will put you in a method once more to raise d^ cash,
I Will buy into your sinking -- funds -- dat you may cut a flash.
Wid my fall, etc.
Ye parsons wid good livings, ye courtiers wid good place,
Advice I Will give you cra^is, and tink upon your case;
If dare ish poshibility, for you I Will raise de dust --
But den you must excuse me if I sarve myself de first.
Wid my fall, etc.
I give advice to every tribe, but physic and the law,
But they outwit de Jews themselves, for bills at sight they draw;
We, when we lend our monish, run some risk -- though it is but small --
But they take all de monish, and run no risk at all.
Wid my fall, etc.
THE TINKER.
A tinker I am, my name's Natty Sam,
From morn to night I trudge it:
So low is my fate, my pers'nal estate
Lies all within my budget.
CHORUS.
Work for the tinker, ho! good wives,
For they are lads of mettle;
Twere well if you could 'mend your lives
As I can mend a kettle*
The man of war, the man of the bar,
Physicians, priests, free-thinkers,
That rove up and down great London town,
What are they all? but tinkers.
Work for the tinker, etc.
Those among the great, who tinker the state,
And badger the minority;
Pray what is the end of their work, my friend?
But to rivet a good majority.
Work for the tinker, etc.
This mends his name, that cobbles his fame*
That tinkers his reputation;
And thus, had I time, I could prove in my ^hime*
Jolly tinkers of all the nation.
Work for the tinker, etc.
JACK IN HIS ELEMENT.
Bold Jack the Sailor here I come,
Pray how do you like my nib,
My trowsers wide, my trampers rum,
My nab, and flowing jib?
I sails the seas from end to end,
And leads a joyous life,
In every mess I find a friend,
in every port a wife.
I Have heard them talk of constancy,
Of grief, and such like fun,
I Have constant been to ten, cried I,
But never grieved for one:
The flowing sails we tars unbend,
To lead a roving life,
In every mess we find a friend,
In every port a wife.
I Have a spanking wife at Portsmouth-gates*
A pigmy at Goree,
An orange-tawny up the Stairs,
A black at St. Lucie:
Thus whatsomdever course I bend,
I leads a jovial life,
In every mess I find a friend,
In every port a wife.
Will Gaft by death was taken aback,
I came to bring the news,
Poll wimper'd sore, but what did Jack?
Why, stood in William's shoes:
She ^^t, I chased, but in the end
She loved me as her life,
And so she got an honest friend,
And I a loving wife.
Thus be we sailors all the go,
On fortune's sea we ru^,
We works, and loves, and fights the foe,
And drinks the generous bub:
Storms that the mast to pieces rend,
Cannot shake our jovial life,
In every mess we find a friend,
In every port a wife.
WHEN THE FANCY STIRRING BOWL.
When the fancy stirring bowl
Wakes its world of pleasure,
Glowing visions gild my soul,
And life's an endless treasure;
Memory decks my wasted heart,
Fresh with gay desires,
Rays divine my senses dart,
And kindling hope inspires.
Then who'd be grave,
When wine could save
The heaviest soul from sinking,
And magic grapes,
Give angel shapes,
To every girl we are drinking.
Here sweet benignity and love
Shed their influence round me,
Gathered ills of life remove,
And leave me as they found me,
Though my head may swim, yet true
Still to nature's feeling;
Peace and beauty swim there too,
And rock me as I Am reeling.
Then who'd be grave, etc.
On youth's soft pillow tender truth
Her pensive lesson taught me,
Age soon mocked the dream of youth;
And wisdom waked and caught me.
A bargain then with love I knocked
To hold the pleasing gipsey,
Then wise to keep my bosom locked,
But turn the key when tipsey.
Then who'd be grave, etc.
When time assuag'd my heated heart
The ^ray beard blind and simple,
Forgot to cool one little part
Just flushed by Lucy's dimple.
That part's enough of beauty's ^ype
To warm an honest fellow;
And though it touch me not when ripe*
It melts still while I Am mellow*
Then who'd be grave, etc.
I WOULD RATHER BE EXCUSED.
Returning from the fair one eve,
Across yon verdant plain,
Young Harry said he would see me home;
A tight, a comely swain.
He begged I would a fairing take,
And would not be refused;
Then asked a kiss, I blushed and cried*
I Would rather be excused.
You're coy, said he, my pretty maid,
I mean no harm I swear;
Long time I have in secret sighed
For you my charming fair:
But if my tenderness offend,
And if my love's refused,
I Will leave you -- what, alone? cried I,
I Would rather be excused.
He pressed my hand, and on we walked,
He warmly urged his suit;
But still to all I said he was
Most obstinately mute.
At length, got home, he angry cried*
My fondness is abused;
Then die a maid -- indeed, said I,
I Would rather be excused.
JOVIAL COMPANIONS.
Come, come, my jolly lads!
The wind's abaft;
Brisk gales our sails shall crowd:
Come bustle, bustle, bustle, boys,
Ha^l the boat;
The boatswain pipes aloud:
The ship's ^nmoor'd;
All hands on board;
The rising gale
Fills every sail,
The ship's well manned and stored.
Then s^ing the ^lowing bowl --
Fond hopes arise --
The girls we prize
Shall bless each jovial soul:
The cann boys bring --
We'll drink and sing,
While ^oaming billows roll.
Though to the Spanish coast
We Are bound to steer,
We'll still our rights maintain;
Then bear a hand, be steady, boys,
Soon we'll see
Old England once again:
From shore to shore
While cannons roar,
Our tars shall show
The haughty foe,
Britannia rules the main.
Then sling the flowing be^^, etc*
DEATH OR LIBERTY.
Whilst happy in my native land,
I boast my country's charter;
I Will never basely lend my hand
Her libe^^ies to barter.
The noble mind is not at all
By poverty degraded;
It Is guilt alone can make us fall,
And well I am persuaded,
Each happy freeman's song shall be,
Give me death or liberty.
Give me death, etc.
Though small the power which fortune grants*
And few the gifts she sends us,
The lordly hireling often wants
That freedom which defends us;
By law secured from lawless strife,
Our house is our castellum;
Thus blessed with all that is dear in life,
For lucre shall we sell 'em?
No! -- every freeman's song shall be,
Give me death or liberty.
Give me death, etc.
SONG. DESERTER.
Somehow my spindle I mislaid,
And lost it underneath the grass;
Damon, advancing, bowed his head,
And said, what seek you, pretty lass?
A little love but urged with care,
Often leads a heart, and leads it far.
'Twas passing by yon spreading oak
T^^t I my spindle lost just now*
His ^^ife then kindly Damon took,
And from the t^^e he cut a bow.
A little love, etc.
Thus did the youth his time employ,
While me he tenderly beheld;
He talked of love, I leaped for joy,
For ah! my heart did fondly yield.
A little love, etc.
MA CHERE AMIE.
Ma chere amie, my charming fair,
Whose smile can banish every care;
In kind compassion smile ^n me,
Whose only care, is love of thee.
Ma c^ere amie, ma chere amie, ma chere amie, ma chere amie.
Under sweet friendship's sacred name,
My bosom caught the tender flame;
May friendship in thy bosom be
Converted into love for me,
Ma chere amie, etc.
Together rea^'d, together grown,
O let us now unite in one!
Let pity soften thy decree,
I droop, dear maid! I die for thee*
Ma chere amie, etc.
THE ROSE.
No flower that blows is like this rose,
Or scatters such perfume;
Upon my breast, ah! gently rest,
And ever, ever bloom!
Dear pledge, to prove a parent's love,
A pleasing gift thou art;
Come, sweetest flower, and from this hour
Live henceforth in my heart!
LOVE's A BUBBLE.
Love's a bubble, courting trouble,
Whilst we love, and love in vain;
When it is over, is the lover,
Now we are got him, worth the gain*
Is love treasure? Is it pleasure?
That can pay whole years of care,
Is the blessing worth caressing?
Speak, ye swains, and own ye fair.
Kind you are pleasing, coy we are teazing,
Love's a fond fatiguing chase:
Smiles deceive us, hopes relieve us,
Hearts our sport from place to place.
Cupid, smiling, life beguiling,
Tempts us with the playful toy;
Often denying, often complying,
Love's our torment and our joy.
THE HONEST SAILOR.
That girl, who fain would choose a mate,
Should never in fondness fail her;
May thank her lucky stars, if Fate
Should splice her to a sailor.
He braves the storm, the battle's heat,
The yellow boys to nail her;
Diamonds, if diamonds she could eat,
Would seek her honest sailor.
If she be true, sure of his heart,
She never need bewail her;
For though a thousand leagues apart,
Still constant is her sailor.
Though she be false, still he is kind,
And comes with smiles to hail her;
He trusting, as he trusts the wind,
Still ^aithless to her sailor.
A butcher ^an procure her prog;
Three-threads to drink, a tailor:
What Is that to biscuit and to grog,
Procured her by her sailor.
She who would such a mate refuse,
The devil sure must all her;
Search round, and if you're wise, you will choose
To wed an honest sailor.
SONG.
You may talk of a brogue, and of Ireland (sweet nation)
Of bulls and of howls, and Palaver, commeca;
But, mon Dieu! it is no more to the French boderation,
Than Vin de Bourdeaux like to sweet Usquebaugh.
If I go back again, blood and 'ounds! how I Will wriggle,
And conge, and caper, and make the folks stare,
And instead of potatoes, how Shelah will giggle,
When I cries, Ma'am, hand me that sweet pomme de ^erre.
With their petit Cha^son, Ca ira, Ca ira,
Malbrook, Mermington, and their dans votre lit,
By the powers they are all nonsense and bodder, agrah! to our diddero, bubbero,
whack, langolee.
Oh, mon jolly tight Shelah, ah! how could I scorn her?
When I loved her so dearly, ma foi, hubbaboo!
And go round the globe, ay, from corner to corner,
For soup maigre, la dance, and for frogs and virtu.
And then to forsake magnifique Tippirary,
For pauvre Versailles, and its ca^e^ing throng;
And eat fricassees only fit for a fairy,
Instead of substantial beef, rote de muton.
With their petit Chanson, etc.
Oh! I kissed a Grisette who holloed out ma si done,
And yet I consol'd her all night and all day;
To be sure I was not her sweet Irish Cupidon,
Her petit Mignon and mi Lor Anglois:
But when she found out sans six sous was poor Pat, Sir,
It was allez, miserable diable, John Bull;
So I even gave this bla^^^ying Frenchified cat, Sir,
Of good wholesome shele^ah, a complete stomach full.
With their petit Chanson, etc.
SONG. CHELSEA PENSIONER
Sing the loves of John and Jean,
Sing the loves of Jean and John;
John for her would leave a queen,
Jean for him the noblest don.
She Is his queen,
He Is her don;
John loves Jean,
And Jean loves John.
Whatever rejoices happy Jean
Is sure to burst the sides of John,
Does she for grief, look thin and lean,
He instantly is pale and wan:
Thin and lean,
Pale and wan,
John loves Jean
And Jean loves John.
'Twas the lily hand of Jean
Filled the glass of happy John:
And heavens! how joyful was she seen,
When he was for a license gone!
Joyful seen,
They Will dance anon,
For John weds Jean,
And Jean weds John.
John has taken to wife his Jean,
Jean's become the spouse of John,
She no longer is his queen,
He no longer is her don.
No more queen,
No more don;
John hates Jean,
And Jean hates John.
Whatever it is that pleases Jean,
Is certain now to displease John;
With scolding they are grown thin and lean,
With spleen and spite thy're pale and wan.
Thin and lean,
Pale and wan,
John hates Jean,
And Jean hates John.
John prays heaven to take his Jean,
Jean at the devil wishes John;
He Will dancing on her grave be seen,
She Will laugh when he is dead and gone.
They Will gay be seen,
Dead and gone,
For John hates Jean,
And Jean hates John.
SONG.
I sailed in the good ship Kitty,
With a stiff blowing gale and rough sea,
Left Polly the lads call so pretty,
Safe here at anchor, yo yea, yo yea, yo yea, yo yea, yo yea.
She lubber'd salt tears when she parted,
And cried, now be constant to me;
I told her not to be down hearted,
So up with the anchor yo yea.
When the wind whistled larboard and starboard,
And the storm came on weather and lee,
The hope I with her should be harbored,
Was my cable and anchor, yo yea.
And yet my boys, would you believe me,
I returned with no rhino from sea;
My Polly would never receive me,
So again I heaved anchor, yo yea.
TWEED SIDE.
What beauties does Flora disclose?
How sweet are her smiles upon Tweed?
Yet Mary's still sweeter than those;
Both nature and fancy exceed.
Nor daisy, nor sweet-blushing rose,
Nor all the gay flowers of the field,
Nor Tweed gliding gently through those
Such beauty and pleasure does yield.
The warblers are heard in the grove,
She linet, the lark, and the thrush,
The blackbird and sweet cooing dove,
With music enchant every bush.
Come let us go forth to the mead,
Let us see how the primroses spring:
We'll lodge in some village on Tweed,
And love while the feathered folks sing.
How does my love pass the long day;
Does Mary not tend a few sheep?
Do they never carelessly stray,
While happily she lies asleep!
Tweed's murmurs should lull her to rest,
Kind nature indulging my bliss,
To relieve the soft pains of my breast,
I Would steal an ambrosial kiss.
It Is she does the virgins excel,
No beauty with her may compare;
Love's graces around her do dwell,
She Is fairest where thousands are fair.
Say, charmer, where do thy flocks stray?
Oh tell me at noon where they seed;
Shall I seek them on sweet winding Tay,
Or the pleasanter banks of the Tweed.
SONG. FRIENDLY TARS.
While up the shrouds the sailor goes,
Or ventures on the yard,
The landman* who no better knows,
Believes his lo^ is hard.
But Jack with smiles, each danger meets,
Casts anchor, heaves the log,
Trims all the sails, belays the sheets,
And drinks his can of grog.
When mountains high the waves that swell
The vessel rudely bear,
Now sinking in a hollow dell,
Now quivering in the air.
Bold Jack, etc.
When waves against rocks and quicksands roar,
You never hear him repine,
Freezing near Greenland's icy shore,
Or burning near the line.
Bold Jack, etc.
If to engage they give the word,
To quarters all repair,
While splinter'd masts go by the board,
And shot sing through the air.
Bold Jack, etc.
SONG. ISLANDERS.
When Yanko, dear, fight far away,
Some token kind me send:
One branch of olive, for dat say
Me wish de battle end.
The poplar tremble while him go,
Say of die life take care,
Me send no laural, for me know
Of dat he find no share.
De ivy say my heart be true,
Me droop, say willow tree,
De torn he say me sick for you,
De sun-flower, tink of me.
Till last me go weep wid de pine,
For fear poor Yanko dead;
He come, and I de myrtle twine,
In chaplet for him head.
SONG. ISLANDERS.
A bed of moss we'll straight prepare,
Where, near him gently creeping.
We'll pat his cheeks, and stroke his hair,
And watch him while he is sleeping.
Sweet flowers of every scent and hue,
Pinks, violets and roses,
And blooming hyacinths we'll strew,
As sweetly he reposes.
And we'll with fond emotion start,
And while, with admiration,
We softly feel his fluttering heart,
Partake its palpitation.
THE VIRTUE OF DRUNKENNESS.
If the beauty of truth unadorned is seen best,
The man that is drunk of fair truth is the test;
For liquor man's natural temper assumes,
While every thing artful flies off with the fumes,
The vizor of life is pulled off by the bowl,
And the face of a drunkard exhibits his soul.
Then beware all who are in rascality sunk,
You Will all be detected if once you get drunk.
If contempt of all danger true courage ever gave
The man that is drunk as a lion is brave;
For like any Caesar, he'ell riot and storm,
And talk of great feats he is two weak to perform.
He Will utter big oaths, know not what to be at,
Thump his head with his fist, but there is nothing in that,
Then beware Braggadocias in cowardice sunk,
You Will all be detected if once you get drunk.
Come on let us drink then, right conscious the bowl,
In each rosy cheek though it light up the soul,
Can nothing of worldly deformity show,
Nor prove that we ought but with honesty glow.
It Is the ordeal of truth and of generous delight,
Which to keep us all honest, we'll try every night.
Proving still by our acts in no meanness we are, sunk,
But true honest friends, whether sober or drunk.
THE MERRY SAILOR.
How pleasant a sailor's life passes,
Who roams over the watterry main:
No treasure he ever amasses,
But cheerfully spends all his gain:
We Are strangers to party and faction,
To honor and honesty true,
And would not commit a base action,
For power and profit in view.
CHORUS.
Then why should we quarrel for riches,
Or any such glittering toys?
A light heart and a thin pair of breeches,
Goes through the world my brave boys.
The world is a beautiful garden,
Enriched with the blessings of life;
The toiler with plenty rewarding,
But plenty too often breeds strife:
When terrible tempests assail us,
And mountainous billows affright,
No grandeur nor wealth can avail us,
But skilful industry steers right.
Then why, etc.
The courtier's more subject to dangers
Who rules at the helm of the state;
Than we, who are to politics strangers,
Escape the snare laid for the great:
The numerous blessings of nature,
In various nations we try;
No mortals on earth can be greater*
Who merrily live till we die.
Then why, etc.
THE PEDDLER.
I am a jolly gay peddler,
Come here to sell my ware;
Yet though in all things I Am a meddler,
I meddle most with the fair.
When I show my ribbands to misses,
Though copper and siller I gain;
Yet better I Am pleased with the blisses,
hat I cannot now explain.
I am a jolly gay pedlar, etc.
Fools say that this life is but sorrow,
And seem disinclind to be gay;
But why should we think of tomorrow,
When we may be happy today?
I rove round the world for my pleasure,
Resolved to take nothing amiss;
And think my x^istence a treasure,
When blessed with the cup and the kiss.
They surely are thick heeded asses.
Who know that youth's gone in a crack,
Yet will not enjoy, as it passes,
The season that never comes back.
Let time jog on slower, or quicker,
Or whether we are silly, or wise;
We shall not be the worse for good liquor,
Or the smiles of a girl with black eyes.
SONG.
By rougery it is true,
I opolent grew,
Just like any other professional sinner;
An orphan, do you see,
Would just wash down my tea,
And a poor friendless widow would serve me for dinner.
I was to be sure,
Of the helpless and poor
A guardian appointed to manage the pelf;
And I manag,d it well,
But how -- say you -- tell?
Why let them all starve to take care of myself.
With these tricks I went on,
Till, faith, sir, anon,
A parcel of stupid mean spirited souls,
As they narrowly watched me,
Soon at my tricks caught me,
And, in their own words, haul'd me over the coals.
In the pillory, that fate
For rougues soon or late,
I stood for the sport of a dissolute mob;
Till my neck master Ketch
Was so eagar to stretch,
That I gave up the thing as a dangerous job.
Now a wolf -- from their dams
I steal plenty of lambs,
Pmper'd high, and well fed -- ^n insatiable glutton,
In much the same sphere
When a man, I move here,
Make and break laws at pleasure, and kill my own mu^ton.
Then since for their sport,
No one here moves the court,
Nor am I ameanable to an employer,
I shall for ever prefer,
With your leave, my good sir,
The life of a wolf to the life of a lawyer.
THE DUSTMAN.
I Am dashing Dick, the Dustman,
None my calling can degrade,
For I am not the first man
Who had driven a dirty trade.
Dust, ho! Dust, ho! I ring my bell and cries,
My tricks if you would find them,
Pretty early you must rise.
For watch me still however you will,
I bears off many a prize,
And if I want to blind 'em,
I throws dust in their eyes.
Why what is your man of honor.
And what is your madam fame?
A jilt when he has won her,
That proves a dirty name.
Victory! Victory! he draws his sword and cries,
In the midst of slaughter find him,
See where the savage flies;
He spares no life,
Nor friends nor wife,
Wherever he finds a prize,
Till death at last to find him,
Throws dust into his eyes.
The lawyer, the physician,
And even the learned divine,
Each drives in his condition,
As black a trade as mine.
Fees, ho! Fees, ho! each draws his purse and cries,
Their conseience cannot bend 'm,
The wretched patient dies;
All ^ra^ers fail.
And in a jail
The ruined client lies,
Unless you throw to blind 'em
Gold dust into their eyes.
And so, do you see, men bustle,
To see who is dirty first;
And one another hustle,
And all to raise the dust.
^ust, ho! Dust, ho! each draws his purse and cries,
And whom old Nick behind him,
Will take to mount up tries,
All scrabling go,
From friend to foe,
To bear away some prize;
And each throws dust to blind him,
Plump in his neighbor's eyes.
THE SAILOR's FAREWELL.
The top sails shiver in the wind,
The ship she casts to sea,
But yet my soul, my heart my mind,
Are Mary moored with thee;
For though thy sailor's bound ^far,
Still love shall be his leading star.
Should landsmen flatter when we are sailed,
O doubt their artful tales;
No gallant sailor ever failed,
If love breathe constant gales;
Thou art the compass of my soul,
Which steers my heart from pole to pole.
Sirens in every port we meet,
More fell than rocks and waves;
But such as grace the British fleet,
Are lovers and not slaves;
No soes our courage shall subdue,
Although we have left our hearts with you.
These are our cares -- but if you're kind,
We'll scorn the dashing main,
The rocks, the billows, and the wind,
The power of France and Spain:
Now England's glory rests with you,
Our sails are full -- sweet girls, adieu!
SEQUEL TO THE SAILOR's FAREWELL.
No topsail shivers in the wind,
Our ship's safe moored in port
In Mary's arms my heart reclined,
No more of waves the sport;
And now to her returned from far,
Alone she proved my leading star.
Though landsmen flattered when I sailed,
And artful tales renew,
But still my Mary never failed,
To keep my love in view,
From trying gales and bloody war,
She still has proved my leading star.
Though Sirens strove to win my heart,
From port to port the same,
In vain my thoughts take Mary's part,
And dwell upon her name,
No sounds have charms but her dear voice,
Her constant sailor's lovely choice.
But now returned and Mary kind
To care we'll bid adieu,
And thou my dear shall steer my mind.
All Is joy when blessed with you,
Dear idol of thy sailor's heart,
Let wedlock join us never to part,
DUET. INKLE AND YARICO
Inkle O say simple maid, have you formed any notion
Of all the rude dangers in crossing the ocean?
When winds whistle shrilly, ah! will not they remin'd you
To sigh with regret for the grot left behind you?

Yarico. Ah no I could follow and sail the world over,
Nor think of my grot, when I look at my lover!
The winds which blow round us, your arms for my pollow.
Will lull us to sleep, whilst we are rocked by each billow.

Inkle. "Then say, lovely lass, what if happily esp^ing
A rich gallant vessel with gay colors flying?

Yaric^ I Will journey with thee, love, to where the land narrows,
And fling all my cares at my back with my arrows."

Both. O say then, my true love we never will sunder,
Nor shrink from the tempest, nor dread the big thunder,
Whilst constant, we'll laugh at all changes of weather,
And journey all over the world both together.

THE END OF A SONG.
Lawyers pay you with words, and fine ladies with vapors,
Your parsons with preaching, and dancers with capers:
Soldiers pay you with courage, and some with their lives;
Some men with their fortune^, -- and some with their wives!
Some with fame, some with conscience, and many throw both in:
Physicians with Latin, and great men with nothing,
I, not to be ^ingular in such a throng,
For your kindness pay you with the end of a song.
But pleading, engrossing, declaring, and vap'ring,
And fighting, and hect'ring, and dancing, and cap'ring;
And preaching and swearing, and bullying, prescribing*
And coaxing, and wheedling, and feeing, and bribing;
And every professional art of hum-drumming,
Are clearly of some sort of species of humming:
Humming! nay take me with you, the term's very strong.
But I only meant -- humming the end of a song.
For all who thus kindly may pay me attention,
I would I had language of some new invention
My thanks to return; for where is the expression
Can describe of your kindness the greatful impression?
May every desire of your heart be proptious,
Be lasting success the result of your wishes;
Unimpair'd be your joys, your lives happy and long, --
And now -- I am come to the end of my song.
SONG. ROSINA.
Belville. Her mouth, which a smile,
Devoid of all guile,
Half opens to view,
Is the bud of the rose
In the morning that blows,
Impearl'd with the dew.
More fragrant her breath
Than the flower scented heath
At the dawning of the day,
The hawthorn in bloom,
The lilly's persume,
Or the blossoms of May.

SONG. ROSINA.
William. When bidden to the wake or fair,
The joys of each free hearted swain,
'Till Phoebe promised to be there,
I loiter'd last of all the train,
If chance some fairing caught my eye, --
The ribbon gay, or silken glove!
With eager haste I ran to buy,
For what is gold compared to love?
My posy on her bosom placed;
Could Harry's sweeter scents exhale;
Her auburn looks my ribbon graced,
And fluttered in the wanton gale.
With scorn she hears me now complain,
Nor can my rustic presents move:
Her heart prefers a richer swain,
And gold, alas! has banished love.

ANNA's URN.
Encompassed in an angel's frame,
An angel's virtues lay;
Too soon did heaven assert the claim,
And called its own away;
And called its own away.
My Anna's worth, my Anna's charms,
Must never more return,
Must never more return,
What now shall fill those widowed arms,
Ah! me, Ah! me, Ah! me, my Anna's urn.
SONG.
Tune, Ye Gods, ye gave to me a Wise.

Our fathers left a race of Kings,
And we were glad to find them;
O how we loved the pretty things!
And laughed and ran behind them.
We la^d our necks beneath their feet,
So humble and so lowly;
And they rode over as we mete,
Still pleased to see our folly.
But warmly now our hearts incline,
To rule the land without them;
The MOLDY PARCHMENTS we resign,
And from the globe we'll rout them.
ODE TO THE DRUM.
I hate that dum's discordant sound,
Parading round, and round, and round;
To thoughtless youth it pleasure yields,
And lures from cities and from fields.
To sell their liberty for chains
Of tawdry lace, and glittering arms,
And when ambition's voice commands*
To march and fight, and fall in foreign lands.
I hate that drum's discordant sound,
Parading round, and round, and round;
To me it talks of ravaged plains,
And burning towns and ruined swains,
And mangled limbs and dying groans,
And widow's teas, and orphan's moans,
And all that misery's hand bestows,
To swell the catalogue of human woes.
SONG.
Tune, Highland Laddie.

Proud monarchs raised to wear a crown,
Forget the power by which they hold it;
They tread the passive subject down,
And thirst for vengeance when they are told it
CHORUS.
But, no more with blind submission --
We'll read them over a new commission;
The Peoples voice
Shall be their cho^^e,
And tread beneath their feet -- oppression.
And men forget that kings of old,
Depending on their free election,
Durst at their peril be so bold,
To rule but as they had direction.
But, no more, etc.
Or, if the king a SOT betrays,
Or, if humane his disposition;
Some minister assumes and sways,
And robs to feed his own ambition.
But, no more, etc.
Thus kings and ministers succeed,
In either still the tyrant reigning;
They suck the poor and as they feed,
Forbid the sufferer's complaining,
CHORUS.
But, no more with blind submission;
We'll read them over a new commission --
The people's voice
Shall be their choice,
And tread beneath their feet -- oppression.
BLOW HIGH, BLOW LOW.
Blow high, blow low, let tempests tear the mainmast by the board,
My heart with thoughts of thee my dear and love well stored;
Shall brave all danger, scorn all fear,
The roaring winds, the raging sea;
In hopes on shore, to be once more,
Safe moored with thee.
Blow high, etc.
Aloft, while mountains high we go,
The whistl'ing wind that scuds along;
And the surges roaring from below,
Shall my signal be to think on thee,
And this shall be my song,
Blow high, etc.
And on that night when all the crew,
The memory of their former lives,
Over flowing canns of slip renew,
And drink, their sweet-hearts and their wives;
I Will heave a ^^gh, and think on thee,
The burden of my song shall be,
Blow high, etc.
THE NEGLECTED TAR.
I sing the British seaman's praise,
A theme renowned in story,
It will deserve more polished lays;
Oh! it is your boast and glory.
When mad-brain'd war spreads death around,
By them you are protected;
But, when in peace the nation's found,
These bulwarks are neglected.
Then, oh! protect the hardy tar,
Be mindful of his merit.
And when again you're plunged in war,
He Will show hi^ daring spirit.
When thickest darkness covers all,
Far on the trackless ocean;
When lightnings dart, when thunders roll,
And all is wild commotion:
When over the bark the white top'd waves,
With boisterous sweep are rolling,
Yet coolly still, the whole he braves,
Untamed amidst the howling.
Then, oh! protect, etc.
When deep immersed in sulfurous smoke,
He feels a glowing pleasure;
He loads his gun, he cracks his joke,
Elated beyond measure.
Though fore and aft the blood-stained deck,
Should lifeless trunks appear;
Or should the vessel float a wreck,
The sailor knows no fear.
Then, oh! protect, etc.
When long becalmed, on Southern brine,
Where scorching beams assail him;
When all the canvas hangs supine,
And food and water fail him;
Then often he dreams of Britain's shore,
Where plenty still is reigning;
They call the watch, his rapture's over,
He sighs, but scorns complaining*
Then, oh! protect, etc.
Or burning on this noxious coast,
Where death so often befriends him,
Or pinched by hoary Greenlands frost,
True courage still attends him:
No clime can this eradicate,
He glories in annoyance;
He fearless braves the storms of fate,
And bids grim death defiance.
Then, oh! protect, etc.
Why should the man who knows no fear,
In peace be then neglected,
Behold him move along the pier,
Pale, meagre, and dejected!
Behold him begging for employ;
Behold him disregarded;
Then view the anguish in his eye,
And say, are tars rewarded?
Then, oh! protect, etc.
To them your dearest rights you owe,
In peace then would you starve them?
What say ye, Britain's sons? -- Oh! no.
Protect them, and preserve them.
Shield them from poverty, and pain,
It Is policy to do it;
Or, when grim war shall come again,
Oh, Britons, ye may rue it!
Then, oh! protect, etc.
FAVORITE INDIAN DEATH SONG.
The sun sets in night, and the stars shun the day,
But glory remains when their lights fade away;
Begin ye tormentors, your threats are in vain,
For the son of AL^NOMOOK shall never complain.
Remember the arrows he shot from his bow;
Remember your chiefs by his hatchet laid low:
Why so slow? Do you wait 'till I shrink from my pain?
No -- the son of ALKNOMOOK shall never complain.
Remember the wood -- where in ambush we lay,
And the scalps which we bore from your nation away:
Now the flame rises fast! you exult in my pain;
But the son of ALKNOMOOK shall never complain.
I go to the land where my father is gone:
His ghost shall rejoice in the fame of his son:
Death comes like a friend, -- he relieves me from pain;
And the son of ALKNOMOOK has scorned to complain.
SONG.
When the chill Sirocco blows,
And winter tells a heavy tale;
When 'pyes and daws, and rooks and crows,
Do fit and curse the frost and snows.
Then give me ale!
Stout brown ale, nut brown-ale, --
O give me nut brown ale.
Ale in a Saxon rumkin then,
Such as will make a Grimalkin prate,
Bids valor burgeon in all men;
Quickens the poet's wit and pen;
Despises fate --
Old brown ale, nut-brown ale,
O give me stout brown ale.
Ale that the plowman's heart up keeps,
And equals it to tyrant's thrones,
That wipes the eye which over weeps,
And lulls in sweet and dainty sleeps
The wearied bones.
Old brown ale, nut brown ale --
O give me stout brown ale.
SONG.
When Jove was resolved to create the round earth,
He subpoena'd the virtues divine, --
Young Bacchus he sat precedentum of mirth,
And the toast was "wit, women, and wine."
The sentiment tickled the ear of each god --
Appollo he winked at the Nine;
And Venus gave Mars, too, a sly wanton nod,
When she drank to wit, women, and wine.
Old Jove shook his sides, and the cup put around,
While Juno, for once looked divine;
These blessings, says he, shall on earth now abound,
And the toast is wit, women, and wine.
These are joys, worthy gods, which to mortals are given,
Says Momus who will not repine;
For what is worth out notice, pray tell me in heaven,
If man have wit, women, and wine?
This joke you will repent, I Will lay fifty to seven,
Such a^^action no power can decline;
Old Jove by yourself you will keep house in heaven,
For w^'ll follow wit, women, and wine.
You Are right, says old Jove, let us hence to the earth,
Men and gods think variety fine;
Who'd stay in the clouds, when goodnature and mirth,
Are be^^y with wit, women, and wine.
WHEN I WAS A YOUNKER.
When I was a younker, and lived with my dad,
The neighbors all thought me a smart little lad;
My mammy she called me a white headed boy,
Because with the girls I liked to toy.
There was Ciss,
Priss,
Letty,
and Betty,
And Doll,
With Meg, Peg, Jenny and Winny and Moll;
I flatter their chatter so sprightly and gay;
I rumble 'em, tumble 'em; that is my way.
One fine frosty morning a-going to school,
Young Moggy I met, and she called me a fool:
Her mouth was my primmer, a lesson I took;
I swore it was pretty and kissed the book.
But school,
Fool,
Primmer,
and Trimmer,
and Birch,
And boys for the girls that I Have left in the lurch.
I flatter, etc.
It Is very well known I can dance a good jig;
And at cudgels from Robin I won a fat Pig:
I wrestle a fall, and a bar I can fling.
And when over a flaggon, can sweetly sing.
But Pig,
jig,
Wicket,
and Cricket,
And Ball.
I Would give up to wrestle with Moggy of all.
I flatter, etc.
TWIGGLE AND A FRIZ.
London town is just like a barber's shop;
But by the Lord Harry, it is wondrous big!
There the painted doll, and the powdered fop,
And many a blocknead wears a wig.
And I tickled each phiz,
With a twiggle and a friz;
With a twiggle, twiggle, twiggle and a frizzle,
With a twiggle, twiggle, twiggle,
And a frizzle, frizzle, frizzle.
And I tickled each phiz,
With a twiggle and a friz.
A captain of horse I went to shave.
O, damme! says he, with a martial frown;
I poised my rasor like a barber brave;
I took him by the nose; he knock's me down
But I tickled, etc.
I next went to dress up a fine gallant Miss;
Down the lady fits and her bosom bares;
Cupid or the devil made me sieze a kiss;
But ere my iron cooled I was kicked down stairs.
But I tickled, etc.
I went to dress a Lawyer, O rare sport!
Who had a false oath that day for to swear.
By my skill sore trouble I spared the court;
For my iron burnt Six-and-eight-pence's ear.
So I tickled, etc.
I went for to dress up an old maid's hair,
Wrinkl'd and bald as a scalded pig;
As she led the dance down with a swimming ai^
The poor old lady dropped her wig.
So I tickled, etc.
SONG.
How blithe was I each morn to see
My swain come over the hill!
He leaped the brook and flew to me;
I met him with good will.
Oh! the broom, the bonny broom,
Where lost was my repose;
I wish I were with my dear swain,
With his pipe and my ewes.
I neither wanted ewe nor lamb,
When his flock, near me lay;
He gathered in my sheep at night,
And eheer'd me all the day.
Oh! the broom, etc.
Me tuned his pipe and reed so sweet,
The birds stood listening by;
The fleecy flock stood still and gazed,
Charmed with his melody.
Oh! the broom, etc.
While thus we spent our time, by turns,
Betwixt our flooks and play,
I envied not the fairest dame,
Though ere so rich and gay.
Oh! the broom, etc.
He did oblige me every hour:
Could I but faithful be?
He stole my heart, could I refuse
Whatever he asked of me?
Oh! the broom, etc.
Hard fate! that I must banished be,
Gang heavily and mourn,
Because I loved the kindest swain,
That ever yet was born,
Oh! the broom, etc.
SONG. DUENNA,
Adieu, thou dreary pile! where never dies
The sullen echo of repentant sighs!
Ye sister mourners of each lonely cell,
Inured by hymns and sorrows, fare-you-well!
For happier scenes, I fly this darksome grove.
-- To saints a prison, but a tomb of love!
SONG.
When little on the village green
We played, I learned to love her,
She seemed to me some fairy queen,
So light tripp'd Patty Clover,
With every simple childish art
I tried each day to move her;
The cherry pluck d the bleeding heart,
To give to patty Clover.
The fairest flow'ts to deck her breast,
I chose -- an infant lover;
I stole the goldfinch from its nest,
To give to Patty Clover,
SONG. ROSINA.
Ere bright Rosina met my eyes
How peaceful passed the joyous day!
In rural sport I gained the prize,
Each virgin listened to my lay.
But now no more I touch the lyre,
No more the rustic sports can please;
I live the slave of fond desire,
Lost to myself, to mirth, and ease.
The tree that, in a happier hour,
Its boughs extended over the plain;
When blasted by the lightning's power,
Nor charm's the eye, nor shades the swain.
SWEET POLL OF PLYMOUTH.
Sweet poll of Plymouth was my dear,
When forced from her to go; --
Adown her cheeks rained many a tear,
My heart was fraught with woe. --
Our anchor weighed, for sea we stood,
The land we left behind;
Her tears then swelled the briny flood,
My sighs increased the wind.
We plowed the deep, and now between
Us lay the ocean wide;
For five long years I had not seen
My sweet, my bonny bride.
That time I sailed the world around,
All for my true love's sake;
But pressed, as we were homeward bound,
I thought my heart would break.
The press-gang bold I asked in vain
To let me once on shore:
I longed to see my poll again,
But saw my Poll no more.
And have they torn my love away!
And is he gone! -- she cried:
My Polly -- sweetest flower of May,
She languish'd drooped, and died.
SEQUEL TO SWEET POLL OF PLYMOUTH.
When Edward first heard Poll of Plymouth was dead,
The functions of life made a pause;
His piteous eyes stood aghast in his head,
And his ship-mates enquired the cause.
He stood for a while, then addressed them all round,
With his hands closely pressed to his heart:
Within this sad letter at once I have found
The scepter of death and his dart.
It tells me my sweet Poll of Plymouth is dead,
My joy and my only delight;
When I was torn from her she took to her bed,
And sighing, resigned her dear life!
He fancied he saw his dear Poll in the clouds,
Oh wait for poor Edward he cries:
And wast as he fancied he ran up the shrouds,
And eagerness flashed in his eyes.
He called to all hands, then gave a loud shriek,
And now quite distracted he raves;
Do not you see that my heart's sprung a leak?
Then threw himself into the waves.
All hands were employed to prevent his sad fate;
The long boat was launched out in vain;
They dragged him on shore, but alas! 'twas too late;
For he never once breathed again!
MY AIN KIND DEARY O.
Will ye gang over the Iee-rig,
My ain kind deary O!
And cuddle there so kindly
Wi' me, my kind deary O!
At ^hornie dike, and birken tree,
We'll daff and never be weary O!
They Will scug ill even frae you and me,
Mine ain kind deary O!
Nae herds wi' kent or cooly there,
Shall ever come to fear ye O:
But lav'rocks whistling in the air,
Shall woo like me their deary O!
While others herd their lambs and ewes,
And toil for warld's gear my jo,
Upon the lee my pleasure grows,
Wi' you my kind deary O!
PRAISE OF LOVE.
Never 'till now I knew love's smart,
Guess who it was that stole my heart?
'Twas only you, if you will believe me.
'Twas only you, etc.
Since that I Have felt love's fatal power,
Heavy has passed each anxious hour,
If not with you, if you will believe me.
If not with you, etc.
Honor and wealth no joys can bring,
Nor I be happy though a king;
If not with you, if you will believe me,
If not with you, etc.
When from this world I Am called away,
For you alone I Would wish to stay;
For you alone, if you will believe me.
For you alone, etc.
'Grave on my tomb wherever I Am laid,
Here lies one who loved but one maid;
That Is only you, if you will believe.
That Is only you, etc.
FINIS.
