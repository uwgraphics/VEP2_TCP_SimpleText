INDIGENCE AND NOBLENESS OF MIND.
ACT I. SCENE I. A Parlour: at the back are Doors with glass Pannels, through
which is discovered a large Compting-House, where several clerks are writing.
NICOLAS laying the breakfast on the table. HOW plaguey cross my master is
before breakfast! not a good word comes from his mouth till he has put a roll
down his throat -- (piles up rolls on a plate) -- It is no little matter that
brings him into temper. He will make as much havoc among these rolls, as a
stage coach would with six insides. Oh, here he comes -- now I shall get my
trimmings, because I asked for a bit of lace to my coat. "My master opens his
eyes and his mouth at the same moment in a morning, and between hunger and ill
temper, snaps at every thing he sees."

Enter VAN SNARL. V. Sn. And so you must have lace to your coat! you
impertinent puppy! to give me your opinions!


Nic. I did not mean any thing, Sir.


V. Sn. And what do you speak for, if you don't mean any thing? hold your
tongue at once -- that is the shortest way of saying nothing.


Nic. I did not look on it as how you would be angry.


V. Sn Who says I Am angry? -- Rascal, if you did not know the sweetness of my
temper, you would not dare to open your lips: always trying to vex me and spoil
my temper! But I will be quite happy and easy, I Am determined, in spite of you
all. I Will be placid -- I Will be serene, -- I Will be meek -- I Will be -- (turns to
the table and speaks in a passion) -- plague on you -- what do you bring me
this heap of dry rolls for? Fetch a muffin.


Nic. Yes sir ( aside) I wish he would begin to eat -- nothing cures his ill
humor like plenty of rolls and muffins.


V. Sn. ( pours out tea) If a man can lay up an hundred thousand pounds, and
not have a right to his own way of thinking at least, there is an end to every
thing at once. If I had not the sweetest temper in the world (Nicholas returns
with several muffins) -- Where Is the muffins -- Puppy! you don't think my
liveries handsome enough! -- Do You call these muffins? Butter a roll or two.
Don't let me see you open your (begins eating muffins) mouth again, sirrah.


Nic. ( aside) I don't dare answer till he has swallowed.


V. Sn. (having swallowed his morsel) Do you starve?


Nic. ( observing that he had eat) No, we know better how to follow our
master's example. We be main well as to the inside lining. "But -- lud! Sir --
there is our neighbor's servants be as fine as so many puppets at the wax work.


"V. Sn. Yes, and live on the same diet as puppets at the wax work. Go down
into the kitchen, you rascal, and stop your mouth."


Nic. What answer be I to give the Polandish gentleman, that lodges up stairs?


V. Sn. What! now you want to plague me again!


Nic. He have been waiting this half hour to know if you be at leisure.


V. Sn. Well, I cannot hurry my breakfast for him -- Zounds! you don't let me
swallow my victuals. What is the use of money if one cannot be happy at one's
meals? ( Nicolas going) What are you ( peevishly) going away for, before I have
done speaking? Probably Mr. Adelbert wants to pay his rent -- so, as soon as
I Have eat this roll tell him I Am at leisure. Go -- and don't open your lips. --


(Nicolas bows and exit.) V. Sn. (taking a large bit of muffin) Laced liveries!
-- no, no -- solid comfort for me. Oh, here is my lodger.


Enter ADELBERT, in a Polish dress. Adel. Mr. Van Snarl, I come to wait on you
--


V. Sn. Rent in hand -- strict to your word, eh? I Am glad to see it. It Is not
always the case with gentlemen of small fortune.


Adel. With gentlemen of every fortune -- They profess an obligation over which
wealth has no influence.


V. Sn. Aye! what is that?


Adel. Honor.


V. Sn. I should not like my rent in that coin: Honor makes a good cabinet
medal, but will not pass on 'Change.


Adel. In my country, in Poland, it will -- I have seen it too in England, at
the call of friendship or humanity, accepted and endorsed for a man's whole
estate.


V. Sn. Psha! why do you plague me about England? -- People love to praise every
country but the country they live in.


Adel. I Am afraid I disturb you.


V. Sn. No, no, sit down; a punctual tenant is never any disturbance. Only that
rascal Nicolas has been trying to spoil the sweetness of my temper. Puppy!
wants a livery with a bit af lace ( imitates Nicolas) as if he could eat lace!
(forced laugh) ha -- ha -- as if he could eat lace, eh, Mr. Adelbert! Now
you're a sensible man -- you prefer the plain dress of your country -- you're
economical.


Adel. Necessity imposes that duty on me.


V. Sn. Aye, aye, I know you're not so rich as I am. I have been laying up
money these twenty years. You Would, hardly believe, Mr. Adelbert, how interest
upon interest, once set a rolling, gathers like a snowball. And you see (points
to the compting house) there they are at it -- there is my mill going, eh! look
-- there it goes.


Adel. You are a happy man, Mr. Von Snarl.


V. Sn. Happy! to be sure I am. Why should not we all be happy? Come, now to
business.


Adel. ( sits down) Well then, I owe, Sir, already a debt to you; I come to ask
your permission to increase it.


V. Sn. Eh!


Adel. It is with the utmost reluctance I venture on this freedom; -- but you
would greatly oblige me by honoring my draft for twenty pounds.


V. Sn. (staring at him) What!


Adel. If from riches you derive happiness, you have assuredly learnt their
real value, that of imparting happiness to others; and I am confident you will
not turn your back on one, who entrusts you with his distress.


V. Sn. ( turns away from Adelbert) Thank'ye for the compliment.


Adel. My little revenue is secure, but my remittances are not arrived. If in
the mean time --


V. Sn. Well, I hope they will arrive soon.


Adel. Were I not satisfied on that head I would not --


V. Sn. Shall I pour you out a dish of tea?


Adel. You will indulge me then?


V. Sn. You have seen the papers I suppose -- no news --


Adel. ( piqued) Mr. Von Snarl, you are a rich man, and accustomed to
speculations.


V. Sn. Speculations! well what of that?


Adel. Did you ever speculate on the face of an honest man?


V. Sn. Did I ever see one? ( sarcastically.)


Adel. It is true I can give little security. This miniature, (drawing a
miniature from his bosom) is the only one I am able to offer. It is set with a
few brilliants, of no great value, and I am sorry to part with it. But if you
would accept it as a pledge --


V. Sn. A pledge! -- why the devil! do you take me for a pawnbroker?


Adel. I beg pardon.


V. Sn. What I give, I give without pledge, bond or note.


Adel. Even to a stranger?


V. Sn. Stranger or no stranger, we are bound to assist distress without
interest.


Adel. Generous!


V. Sn. Do You observe? -- when we can -- but my purse will not bear a loan at
present.


Adel. Only twenty pounds.


V. Sn. Twenty pounds! twenty devils. I had yesterday two bankruptcies in my
books -- one of my ships from Africa lost, with a cargo of 400 blacks on board
-- besides the parson's widow, Mrs. Rose and her daughter, whom I maintain, as
you know, in the house. I will not say what they cost me, because that is charity
-- but I know I have a tender heart and a sweet temper, that would be my ruin,
if I did not watch my purse at both ends. But come -- if I cannot lend you my
money, I Will give you my advice. Go to Levi, the great Jew, and he will lend you,
on the picture nearly its full value.


Adel. To a Jew!


V. Sn. A Jew! well, what of that? I would as soon do business with a Jew as a
Christian. He Will deal with you as a man and a friend.


Adel. And not as you have done. I beg pardon for the trouble of this visit.
(going)


V. Sn. Hark'ye, Mr. Adelbert, ( Adelbert returns) I expect to see my son in
law every hour, and I shall want a room for him. I don't mean to be uncivil to
you, because you have not got twenty pounds.


Adel. I understand you -- I shall provide myself with another lodging.


V. Sn. Well, well, as you like for that: I don't mean to turn you out of the
house. You Will dine with me before you go away today?


Adel. Dine with you! you do me too much honor. -- ( contemptuously)


V. Sn. Nay, I insist on it. You must take leave of the girls this afternoon.


Adel. That Is true. I owe the young ladies every attention. I shall wait on
you. Exit Adelbert.


V. Sn. Now that is what I call plaguey dry. Owes the young ladies! -- He does'nt
owe the young ladies half so much as he owes me. And then he would borrow! -- an
insolent rascal! -- borrow! -- Talk to me as he would to a pawn-broker! -- If I
had'nt the sweetest temper in the world -- Nicolas!

Enter NICOLAS. Ask Totum, if there are letters by the mail today, and tell
Mrs. Homily to come hither.


Nic. Mrs, Rose, Sir?


V. Sn. Mrs. Rose, sirrah! yes Mrs. Rose.


Nic. Yes, Sir. Exit Nicolas.


V. Sn. May not I call her Mrs. Homily if I choose it? Plague on it, I must not
have my jokes now in my own house.


NICOLAS returns. Nic. Mr. Totum says he will bring you the letters himself,
sir.


V. Sn. In how many hours, minutes, and seconds, has he calculated he shall
come?


Nic. He said he would come presently, Sir, -- Mrs. Rose is here, Sir. Exit
Nicolas.


Enter Mrs. ROSE. V. Sn. Well, Mrs. Homily, whither in such a hurry?


Mrs. R. Oh, lud, Sir, here is every thing wanted at the same instant. In the
compting house they want their coffee -- The cook wants rice and currants --
the footman wants his breakfast, and Miss Josephine wants honey water for her
hair.


V. Sn. Well, and I want to speak to you. I expect company to dinner.


Mrs. R. Company! no I hope not.


V. Sn. I have two Burgomasters to dine with me, and --


Mrs. R. Oh, Gemini, I must go to to the larder directly. The kitchen is not
prepared for two Burgomasters.


V. Sn. (pettishly) What Is the kitchen to me, provided there be plenty on the
table? Next, I suppose, I must not have Burgomasters to dine with me?


Mrs. R. Pretty talking! it would be a fine thing indeed, if one could blow
good things on the table, forsooth, as they do in the Rambling Night's
Entertainments. -- That Is all sinful witchcraft, and I am sure you cannot
expect a clergyman,s widow, as I am, to meddle with any such devilish practices.


V. Sn. No: but I expect my housekeeper to provide me a good dinner.


Mrs. R. Well, well -- I Will go to the larder and see what there is for you.
Yonder Is Mr. Totum with your letters. By the time you have read them I shall
know more about it. Exit Mrs. Rose.

TOTUM without. Three bales of goods to Van Cormack and Co -- Right.


V. Sn. Totum!


Tot. ( without) Ready, Mr. Van Snarl -- Item; numero four -- cargo of Spanish
wares -- right -- post Don Candimorez -- right -- place four hundred marks to
account of Louis Vancaper and Co -- right -- call in --


V. Sn. Totum!


Tot. ( without) Ready, Mr. Van Snarl -- call in bills on Carpo and Co. No time
to note.

Enter TOTUM. Mr. Van Snarl, your very obedient servant.


V. Sn. Well, Totum, is the mail arrived?


Tot. Received letters -- read -- speak contents, names, signatures -- say if
right -- no time to note -- (gives a parcel of letters to Van Snarl) Imprimis
-- a letter bearing royal signet -- parcel annexed -- ( goes to the door of the
compting house) Clever door! convenient -- hear clerks with left ear -- letters
with right -- credit time ( places himself in the midway of the door sometimes
watching the clerks within, and sometimes attending to Van Snarl)


V. Sn. ( opening the parcel) How long has the mail been arrived?


Tot. ( looking hastily at a clock, which is seen within) Thirteen minutes,
nine seconds, and a fraction.


V. Sn. Eh! the deuce! a letter from our Prime Minister! ( reads) "Greeting --
Whereas it appears from the report of our Secretary for the Naval Department,
that you have procured an expeditious delivery of the articles required of you;
We, therefore, to testify our good will toward you, send you the enclosed
snuff box -- Your affectionate friend, Richtenstein."


Tot. ( advances) Congratulate -- this is a day -- this is an hour -- day
fourteen -- month April -- hour ten in forenoon -- fifty three minutes, seven
seconds, and a fraction. Ha! ( looks at the box which Van Snarl holds in his
hand) -- brilliants -- I underwrite


V. Sn. Doubtless --


Tot. Worth more or less, twelve hundred and ninety-nine dollars, three
guldens, eighteen stivers, one groot, and three pfennings.


V. Sn. I Will value it at two thousand dollars.


Tot. Right -- secondly, a letter from correspondent at Amsterdam ( gives a
second letter and goes again to his post at the door of the compting house)


V. Sn. Vander Housen! ( opens the letter and reads) "Sir, this is to inform
you, that, under date of seventeenth ultimo, we have sent to your direction a
son, viz. Hans William -- hope you will safely receive the same, and beg you
will consign him forthwith to your daughter."


Tot. Not arrived as per advice -- hope they book'd him.


V. Sn. ( reads) "Though young folks are of late much fallen in value, we can
assure you, said Hans William is of extra good quality, and will, we dare say,
give satisfaction. Remain, errors excepted, Sir, your most faithful servant and
friend to command, Vander Housen and Co."


Tot. Congratulate -- ha, ha! you will have a wedding -- you must give a ball --


V. Sn. I will give a dinner.


Tot. A fire-work in your garden.


V. Sn. With all my heart.


Tot. Your own figure all in a blaze.


V. Sn. Eh!


Tot. Like a flying mercury ( imitates the attitude of a mercury) with a
snuff box in your hand.


V. Sn. Zounds! do you consider what all this will cost?


Tot. Total, seventeen dollars, eight guldens, nine stivers, three pfennings
and a fraction -- ha! Oh, it will cut a dash! we'll go halves.


V. Sn. Halves! Totum! Why, Totum, you're out of your senses, Totum.


Tot. One expense to serve for two weddings.


V. Sn. Two weddings! who is the other bridegroom? (TOTUM draws himself up
conceitedly.) What! yourself?


Tot. Received this morning -- hour nine in the forenoon, forty-three minutes,
seventeen seconds, a letter -- note the contents -- poor dear father deceased.


V. Sn. Your father dead!


Tot. Died twenty-fifth instant, four in the morning, fifty-nine minutes, and
three seconds, aged seventy eight years, four months, two weeks, five days,
fourteen hours, and a quarter -- left to Tilman Totum, sole heir, eighty
thousand marks.


V. Sn. Totum, take a chair.


Tot. Exclusive, in the hands of Van Creeper and Co. one thousand bales of
Panama dowlas --


V. Sn. Dear Totum, pray sit down.


Tot. Six chests of silver plate (takes a chair) -- twenty four cargoes of
Nankin muslins --


V. Sn. Let we wipe the cushion.


Tot. And one hundred and eight jars of fine Smyrna oils --


V. Sn. Mr. Totum, I insist on your being seated.


Tot. Besides a box of uncounted livres, stivers, groots, pfennings, guilders,
schellings, florins, dollars, ducats, doubloons, milreas, sequins, and duros,
all brand new, never been yet in circulation.


V. Sn. Dearest Mr. Totum, do me the favor to sit down. [They both sit.]


Tot. Father deceased -- enter on trade -- engage capital -- ensure on my own
risk -- build warehouse -- settle correspondence -- marry.


V. Sn. And who is the bride?


Tot. Louisa Rose -- a good girl.


V. Sn. Good! why, you're mad -- she has not a farthing.


Tot. A pretty face --


V. Sn. What interest will that bring?


Tot. A pair of white hands --


V. Sn. Which can earn nothing.


Tot. Hm! a pretty little foot --


V. Sn. Poh, poh -- why, Totum, you're bewitched.


Tot. Totum, you're bewitched -- right. The devil draws on my heart -- must
accept -- flesh weak -- temptation strong -- pretty girl, an enchanting angel
-- solitary bachelor, a poor devil -- so, if you have no objection --


V. Sn. None in the world, dear Totum. ( aside) I shall get rid of a boarder,
whom I took into my house to please my daughter. But have you spoke to the girl?


Tot. Occasionally -- time suiting.


V. Sn. How does she seem to like you?


Tot. Little rogue! loves me -- secretly.


V. Sn. Secretly!


Tot. Prove it -- pro primo -- whenever she sees me, laughs -- shows she is
pleased: Pro secundo, when she hears me coming, runs away -- shows she is
bashful: Pro tertio, when I speak to her, answers at random -- shows her mind
is so engaged, she does not know what she says: Pro quarto, always jokes about
my wig.


V. Sn. That shows plainly she is in love.


Tot. Only one little article makes me uneasy. That Polander up stairs -- I
perceive certain looks -- here, there -- from, to -- seem to mean something.


V. Sn. I can make you easy on that head, for he shall not stay in my house.
Between you and me, Mr. Totum, I suspect the Pole to be a spy.


Tot. Hm! why not?


V. Sn. I see he is very poor -- and who can tell? It would not be amiss if you
could take an opportunity, when he is gone out, of just -- eh? in his room, eh?


Tot. Examine his papers, boxes, and so forth -- I understand you -- Just what
I wished -- Shall find if there is any thing going on between him and Louisa --
I Will be on the watch -- At what hour do we dine today? Answer -- three o'clock
-- Burgomasters never wait -- Your humble servant to command, Tilman Totum --
sole heir to eighty thousand marks, six chests of silver plate, one hundred and
eight jars of Smyrna oil, etc. etc. etc.


Exit TOTUM. V. Sn. This will be a rare riddance for me -- Where is that giddy
baggage my daughter all this while? Oh, here she comes with Louisa. Come
hither, Josephine.

Enter JOSEPHINE and LOUISA. I have something to tell you -- can you guess what
it is?


Jos. No, but I am dying with curiosity to know it.


V. Sn. Ah, you're a woman.


Jos. Yes, unfortunately.


V. Sn. And you, ( to LOUISA) I suppose, are dying too -- you are a woman too,
eh, Louisa?


Lou. Yes, Sir.


V. Sn. Well, there is a grand dinner today, and the grand dinner has its grand
reasons.


Jos. Must we put on our best gowns?


V. Sn. If you like.


Jos. That is according as the reasons are worth them.


V. Sn. Suppose it is a bridegroom --


Jos. ( laughs) Oh, la! have you ordered one for me, papa?


V. Sn. Suppose I have --


Jos. What! from China?


V. Sn. Psha! he comes from one of the first houses in Amsterdam.


Jos. ( with affected gravity) Does he cost much?


V. Sn. Your hand.


Jos. That Is very dear.


V. Sn. And your heart into the bargain.


Jos. That Is too much.


V. Sn. It Is little enough for a good husband, so don't plague me with any more
questions.


Jos. Yes, there is one more I must ask. What is his name?


V. Sn. Hans William.


Jos. Oh -- then I will not have him.


V. Sn. Why so?


Jos. I have no objection to William, -- but Hans -- positively Hans must not
come near me.


V. Sn. There, there! that is the way -- no matter how deserving a man be -- if
his name do not happen to strike your fancy, he is to be laughed at. Take
pattern by Louisa -- she is a good girl, and knows how to behave herself.


Lou. Josephine is only joking, Sir.


V. Sn. Joking! zounds! every body is to make jokes but myself. I have found a
husband too for Louisa.


Jos. From Holland too?


V. Sn. No -- home manufacture.


Jos. And his name not Hans?


V. Sn. Hold your tongue, and think of making up your wedding suit.


Jos. Oh -- there will be time enough for that.


V. Sn. Suppose your bridegroom should come today?


Jos. Suppose some accidents should happen tomorrow?


V. Sn. What accidents; pray?


Jos. Suppose he should not like me, and suppose we should quarrel, and suppose
I should scratch his eyes out before the wedding?


V. Sn. Why, then you will have the comfort of marrying a blind man; for, to tell
you plainly, the affair is concluded, and if you don't take him, and like him
too when he is come, never expect to have a farthing of my money; and another
time you may provide for yourself. (angrily.) If I had not the sweetest temper
in the world, these silly girls would contrive to put me in a passion.


Exit VAN SNARL. Jos. But, Louisa, we forgot to enquire the name of your
husband.


Loui. Oh, Dear! that was not said in earnest.


Jos. It will prove as much in earnest, I fancy, as mine. Do you think I Will let
my father send me to Holland, like a ton of flax?


Loui. Ah, Josephine! you are very happy; -- for you have a father --


Jos. Will you change fathers with me?


Loui. No -- not for all the world. My father, to be sure, will not see me; and I
always thought that very strange: But, in every thing else, he is so good to
me, and so kind! --


Jos. But not very wise* I think. He refuses to see you, and does not know that
he sees you every hour. Under the name of Mrs. Rose's daughter you have won his
affection, in spite of his prejudice and absurdities.


Loui. If I was but sure of that, Josephine!


Jos. I am sure of it -- and, what is better, he loves you for your own sake:
the parent's vanity has no hand in it.


Loui. Why should he shun me so, Josephine? An't I his child? And, indeed,
indeed, I never did any thing willingly to offend him. Why should he drive me
from his sight, as soon as I was born? I grew up far away from him, and he
forbids me now to come to him, that I may take his hand, and press it to my
lips.


Jos. To be sure it is droll enough. Father and daughter live in the same
house, converse together, correspond together, and yet are strangers, except by
letters, which are sometimes a week in traveling from one to the other.


Loui. Yesterday he got my last letter. When I sat down to it, Josephine, my
heart was quite full: -- and I begged so hard to see him; and the words were,
all, so blotted, he must have seen that I cried all the while I was writing it.
I fancied in the evening he looked more thoughtful than ever. Perhaps he may be
brought to give his consent to see me at last. Don't you think he might,
Josephine?


Jos. If I were to tell you that I saw him wipe a tear away with his hand --


Loui. Did you, indeed? I wish I had seen it! But it would not have signified.
Ah, Josephine! it is very hard when a child is not allowed to kiss off a tear
from the cheek of her father.


Enter Mrs. ROSE, with a letter. Mrs. R. Well, child, here is a letter for you
again -- (LOUISA snatches the letter hastily from her, and presses it to her
lips.).


Jos. Would not one think it was from her sweetheart? Well, I Will leave you to
your transports; -- when they are over, I shall expect you; and in the mean
time I Will settle the color of our wedding suits. Exit JOSEPHINE.


Loui. (reads) "My dear and only daughter (she kisses the letter again) your
last letter has drawn tears from my eyes. Your wish to see me is mine also."
Oh! then I shall be so happy! "Yet, as you value my life* do not insist on your
request. I have withheld myself eighteen years from your sight -- I dare not
yet meet it -- never again enquire the reason. ( weeps -- then after a pause
reads,) You must have occasion for money -- yet you ask for none -- I therefore
enclose you a note -- you must want for nothihg -- all I have is yours -- I
received it all from your mother -- Resemble her! Adieu, my dear, dear child!
Love your father, who has no other joy in this world than you!" -- Then he
never will see me! what have I done to deserve this! (weeps.)


Mrs. R. Dear child, trust to Providence! We must none of us despair -- things
may change for the better in a moment. Oh! if you had heard my husband's
discourse about poverty and want! Poor dear Dr. O^^^rius!


Loui. Poverty! Oh, that is a word the heart knows nothing about.


Mrs. R. Because the heart knows nothing about hunger and thirst. Want is a
very bad companion; and you may thank your father for never letting you know
it. See how much the note is for, that he has sent you.


Loui. It Is for much more than I want.


Mrs. R. Well, well, if you don't want it today, you may tomorrow -- but I
warrant you will give it away before tomorrow, to some poor person or other:
[LOUISA appears suddenly thoughtful.] Well -- what will you do with it?


Loui. Oh, I must not tell you. What I intend to do would be of no value if it
were told. -- ( Looks at the note) three hundred crowns! I wish they were three
thousand, with all my heart.


Mrs. R. Oh, you extravagant child! three hundred crowns! you will not surely give
that sum away!


Loui. No -- I Will lay it out at interest -- I Will be an usurer.


Mrs. R. An usurer, forsooth! Ah, child, child! you learn to cipher and cast
accounts, to be sure; but how many pence there are in a dollar, you will never
learn to reckon as long as you live. Exit Mrs. ROSE.


Loui. That, now, may be very true: and, somehow or other, I always thought
charity much easier than arithmetic. I know Mr. Van Snarl takes a deal of
pleasure in counting up his dollars; but, for my part, I think there is more
pleasure, by half, in giving money to the distressed, and letting them count it
for me. Exit.


END OF THE FIRST ACT.
ACT II. An Apartment in VAN SNARL'S House.
SCENE I.
Enter VAN SNARL and LEOPOLD. Van Snarl. NAY, brother, its very strange you
will not let me tell you the news.


Leop. I have no relish for news -- Few old things of the world are worth much,
and the new ones are worth less.


V. Sn. There, now you are out of temper -- It Is a strange thing a man cannot
be always easy and happy as I am. I will tell you for all that; Louisa Rose is
going to be married.


Leop. Louisa Rose! -- to whom?


V. Sn. Guess.


Leop. I cannot rack my brain with conjecture.


V. Sn. To my book-keeper, Tilman Totum.


Leop. (appears surprised) I am sorry for it.


V. Sn. His father has just left him eighty thousand marks.


Leop. I am heartily sorry for it.


V. Sn. Why, that is droll. I think it is a devilish neat thing -- He means to
set up in trade for himself, and he thinks Louisa will make him a very suitable
wife.


Leop. Fie, fie!


V. Sn. Brother Leopold, you are a queer fellow: -- why should she not?


Leop. A girl like an angel, and a fellow like a monkey.


V. Sn. Yes -- but the angel is as poor as the devil, and the monkey is as rich
as a jew.


Leop. She may starve with Totum, in spite of his riches.


V. Sn. (with a sneer). Nay, how can that happen.


Leop. If the fool does not know that money is not wealth.


V. Sn. Money not wealth? -- What nonsense you talk! -- Pray what is wealth
then?


Leop. The free and liberal use we make of it. Wealth, brother, is like a
sword, placed in various hands. Fools are laughed at for their ignorance in
using it; knaves, who grasp it, hurt their neighbors with it; wise and
benevolent men, alone, know how to guard themselves with it, while they protect
the weak, who want their assistance.


V. Sn. Well, if Louisa starves, it shall not be my fault. -- I Will set her off
well at least -- I Will give her a grand wedding dinner.


Leop. I hope you mean to give her a portion likewise.


V. Sn. A portion! do you think I am gone out of my senses?


Leop. With all your money!


V. Sn. That all would have been little enough by this time, if I were as
romantic as you are, brother -- If you are so fond of the girl, why don't you
give her a portion out of your own fortune?


Leop. It belongs to my daughter.


V. Sn. Ah -- if you had taken as good care of your patrimony, and attended to
the golden rule of multiplication, as I have done. --


Leop. I have attended but to one golden rule through life, brother.


V. Sn. What may that be?


Leop. Humanity.


V. Sn. Lucky, if you had mixed a little prudence with it; then you would have
been always easy and happy, as I am; that is, if you were as sweet tempered as
I am. -- But you -- had not you happened to meet with a wife --


Leop. ( interrupting him.) Let me beseech you, brother, no mention of that
subject!


V. Sn. I was only going to say that her fortune helped you up.


Leop. Oh, Emilia!


V. Sn. Aye, aye, she was a woman of the right sort -- She had plenty of jewels
and cash. I wish she was alive again.


Leop. For heaven's sake, brother!


V. Sn. I am only saying that if your wife was still alive --


Leop. Nay, then, you compel me to leave you. ( Exit hastily.)


V. Sn. There he goes again. Was ever any man so uncivilly treated in his own
house as I am! a silly fellow, making such a perpetual wimpering for the loss
of one wife! -- I have buried three, one after the other, without breaking my
heart. That Is the difference between Leopold and me -- he carries his
remembranee of his wife about in his mind, and I carry mine in my pockets.


Exit. SCENE II. Another Apartment.
Enter TOTUM and Mrs. ROSE. Mrs. R. Let me go, Mr. Totum -- I have no time for
talking -- My master has two Burgomasters to dine with him -- and, thank
heaven! there is plenty for them! -- A sirloin of beef, roast fillet of veal,
scollop'd oysters, collar'd eel, anchovies, and a furmenty pudding.


Tot. No time for talking! forty-seven words, four articles, and five stops.
Listen! do you know, Mrs. Rose, -- sweet Mrs. Rose, -- that today is a day --
a day -- a -- I cannot tell you what a day it is --


Mrs. R. Well, and if it be a day, I warrant I can provide for it --


Tot. Brief reply -- credit words.


Mrs. R. I always add a dish for every fresh guest, and for every bit of good
news.


Tot. Good news -- right. Attend, note contents -- Imprimis, Mr. Van Snarl has
received a snuff box from the Minister --


Mrs. R. What -- the Minister of the Parish? --


Tot. Poh! psha! No, no, Prime Minister -- Head-Clerk to the King.


Mrs. R. From his Majesty's Minister! Oh! then I must provide a dish of Plaice.


Tot. In secundo, Miss Josephine's bridegroom is on the road.


Mrs. R. The bridegroom! I must have pigeons and a cake.


Tot. And, thirdly -- Mrs. Rose -- sweet Mrs. Rose -- you may take into account
a second wedding.


Mrs. R. A second wedding? --


Tot. Yes, note a ditto.


Mrs. R. Oh, then I must order a goose for the second coarse -- mercy on me! --
there will be hardly time.


Tot. Dine at three -- time in hand five hours twenty-seven minutes -- no fear
of deficit. -- Enter items -- provide plaice, pluck pigeons, gut goose, one
hour, fifteen minutes -- dress, stew, and roast ditto, two hours, one half
quarter, and three seconds. -- Balance, two hours, four minutes, twenty seven
seconds, and a fraction -- post credit side -- therefore listen, Mrs. Rose --
sweet Mrs. Rose, listen.


Mrs. R. I tell you, Mr. Totum, since there is to be a second wedding --


Tot. The second wedding, Mrs. Rose, depends on you.


Mrs. R. The second course does, Mr. Totum; so I Will give another look into the
larder -- (going.)


Tot. Listen, Mrs. Rose, sweet Mrs. Rose, listen -- I have placed a large sum
in your hands --


Mrs. R. In mine! --


Tot. The sum of my happiness -- I must disclose to you the state of my books
-- my father being deceased --


Mrs. R. Poor man!


Tot. Died fourteenth of last month, at fifty-nine minutes, three seconds,
after four in the morning -- aged seventy eight years, four months, two weeks,
three days, fourteen hours, twelve minutes, and a quarter, ha! --


Mrs. R. Bating the odd hours, minutes, and quarter, just the very age of my
late husband, poor dear Dr. Olearius.


Tot. Left Tilman Totum, sole heir, eighty thousand marks.


Mrs. R. Indeed! I am truly happy to hear it -- Now I Have just thought that we
have got in the larder --


Tot. Psha! close the larder, open your ears and listen -- I say, Mrs. Rose --
sweet Mrs. Rose, listen. -- Having now stock in trade, I mean to open an
account of matrimony.


Mrs. R. (bridling and smiling.) Matrimony?


Tot. Yes -- open a new firm, raise a new head.


Mrs. R. Was that the subject you wanted to speak on? Oh, Mr. Totum, you do me
too much honor.


T. I do you no honor at all; I only want you to listen, Mrs. Rose; sweet Mrs.
Rose, listen! I fear, above all things to cast up wrong; that, you know, to a
man in business -- say no more -- hate a blot -- therefore, without your
consent, reckon naught.


Mrs. R. Dear Mr. Totum -- to be sure -- but you know the world is rather
ill-natured: there are some circumstances, that should be taken into
consideration.


Tot. Allow deductions -- state fairly, what heads?


Mrs. R. First --


Tot. Imprimis --


Mrs. R. Difference of age.


Tot. Repairs payable by the owner; according to best of knowledge and belief,
difference not great.


Mrs. R. True, when one has met with hardships, one looks older than one really
is. But, dear Mr. Totum, marriage is a serious step; when I lost poor dear Dr.
Olearius -- Heaven grant him rest! -- I made a vow never to marry again.


Tot. Well, well, I don't care for your vow -- that is an account balanced --
credit by loss -- but, sweet Mrs. Rose, my new head is yet a blank -- suffer me
--


Mrs. R. Ah! dear Mr. Totum, we are poor people, who have many wants to be
supplied.


Tot. You allow the demand then? -- note consent


Mrs. R. ( with affected satisfaction) Dearest Mr. Totum, you may command me.


Tot. (adjusting himself.) Your daughter, I conclude --


Mrs. R. My daughter!


Tot. Yes, Mrs. Totum, that will be -- Happy, happy pair!


None but the rich deserve the fair. Mrs. R. Mistress Totum! Oh! you want to
marry my daughter Louisa, do you?


Tot. Whom else, the dickens! do you think I want to marry?


Mrs. R. Oh, oh! Aye, aye! Well, that is nothing to me -- you must speak to
Louisa herself about that.


Tot. Express. But, if I may debit my head with the daughter, and credit by the
mother's consent, that will be a pretty clear account.


Mrs. R. A mother! Oh! to be sure -- well, I have a deal to say on that
subject; but I am in haste now -- Well, Mr. Totum, speak to Louisa yourself;
you have my consent,, if you can gain Louisa's, (aside) which I am sure you
never will.


Tot. Enough! You endorse the bill -- she will answer it -- therefore I remain,
errors excepted, your obedient, faithful servant, shortly son-in-law, Tilman
Totum, sole heir to eighty thousand marks, six chests of silver plate, one box
of uncounted livres, stivers, etc. etc.


Exit TOTUM. Mrs. R. Dear heart! What will Mr. Leopold say to this? Well, well,
as Heaven pleases: Mr. Totum is a pretty man, and a good man; he never fails at
a sermon, and it is quite edifying to hear him chant.


Exit Mrs. ROSE. SCENE III. An Apartment in VAN SNARL'S House.
LOUISA sitting at her Work, ELLEN with a Guitar in her Hand, which she appears
to be laying down, as taking leave of LOUISA. Loui. Thank ye, Ellen; but did
not you tell me, that Mr. Leopold heard you singing one day?


Ellen. Yes, I did so.


Loui. And desired you to sing the song again?


Ellen. Yes; twice.


Loui. Then pray let me hear that song before you go. I am sure I shall like
it, if he did.


Ellen. It Is one of our village ballads.

AIR.
'Twas in the solemn midnight hour,
When all was dark around;
When planets strike, and spells have power
And mandrakes cleave the ground:
I heard a voice as from the tomb,
The bell then beating one;
"Adieu," it cried, "I meet my doom,
"My life's last sand is run."
'Twas William's voice, 'twas William's form,
Wet from his watery grave;
"I sink," he cried, "amid the storm,
"I sleep beneath the wave:"
Starting I rise, and snatch my gown,
And hasten to the shore;
I see the gallant ship go down, --
But see my love no more.

Exit ELLEN. ( After the Air, LOUISA remains pensive.) Enter JOSEPHINE and
ADELBERT. Jos. Pray walk in, Mr. Adelbert; there is no one here who will not be
glad to see you -- is there, Louisa?


(LOUISA appears embarrassed, and rises from her chair.) Adel. ( to JOSEPHINE.)
Your friend's generous heart is ever ready to welcome the unfortunate,


Jos. Make a curtsy, Louisa. -- Mr. Adelbert is come to dine with us.


Adel. By your father's invitation.


Jos. That was very well done. You shall sit by one of us. Now, the question
is, whether you mean to eat much or little, or to talk much or little.


Adel. Why so?


Jos. I Will tell you. If you have a mind to eat very little, and not to speak at
all, you shall sit by Louisa.


Adel. I protest, I am at a loss to understand you.


Loui. Dear! She does not know what she means herself.


Jos. But indeed she does know what she means. Have not I seen him sit by you
for hours together, without opening his lips?


Loui. Nay, now I Am sure you are mistaken; Mr. Adelbert has always entertained
me exceedingly.


Jos. Oh! I never doubted that.

Enter TOTUM, more sprucely dressed than before, and Mrs. ROSE. (JOSEPHINE,
LOUISA, and ADELBERT, converse in dumb show; TOTUM appears to be whispering to
Mrs. ROSE.)
Tot. (in a low voice.) Have you dropped a word for me?


Mrs. R. Speak to the girl yourself, I tell you, Mr. Totum.


Tot. There Is that cursed ^all Pole! When he is gone --


Mrs. R. He dines here.


Tot. Dines! choke him.


Mrs. R. Heaven forbid!


Jos. ( advances to TOTUM.) Mr. Totum! I protest you have put on a new wig
today.


Tot. Yes -- I Have raised a new head. Do You like it? -- Put it on in haste --
spirits in great fluctuation -- high, low -- up, down -- from fifty to seventy.


Loui. Ha, ha! -- Why really --


Tot. Don't laugh; a laugh sinks me. This day, Miss Josephine, is the most
awful day of my life -- I am going to file off bachelor's account, and begin a
new head in the ledger of matrimony.


Jos. Then you are going to be married?


Tot. Going to be married -- right. -- Oh, my Louisa, if I may speak the wishes
of the heart! --


Jos. What, have you got a heart?


Tot. Only by debit -- wants credit by ditto -- I come to ask Miss Louisa,
whether she will run the risk of partnership with me in a new branch of trade?


Jos. Why, Louisa knows nothing of book-keeping.


Tot. I beg you will not interrupt me, Miss, while I am summing up my articles.
Speak, Miss Louisa, without loss of time, may I flatter myself --


Loui. With what, Mr. Totum?


Tot. Transfer -- heart and hand -- hand and heart -- please to accept a barter.


Jos. Why, I really begin to think you want to marry Louisa.


Adel. ( aside.) Heavens!

(JOSEPHINE and LOUISA laugh.)
Tot. What means this pretty smile on my Louisa's cheek?


Jos. Pure joy.


Tot. Pure joy! -- right. A laugh -- brief -- credit words. ( to LOUISA.) Note
consent?


Loui. Indeed, Mr. Totum, you are very good; but I am not my own mistress, you
know.


Tot. Oh! I have got your mother's consent posted already.


Loui. Yes -- but my mother knows, that --


Jos. (maliciously to Adelbert) She is already promised. (Adelbert appears
alarmed).


Loui. Indeed, Mr. Totum, I can never be your wife.


Tot. Never! Error in addition. Why?


Jos. Hold, Sir! Girls must never be asked why.


Tot. Account stands open. ( looking askance at Adelbert). To be sure I am not
the youngest in the room, but neither am I the poorest -- I fancy eighty
thousand marks. -- Oh! here comes Mr. Leopold; he will sum up better for me --
Enter LEOPOLD. Your servant, Sir; please to check account between these ladies
and me.


Leop. What is the matter?


Tot. The matter, Sir, is that --


Jos. Mr. Totum wishes to marry --


Tot. Hush, Miss, do not interrupt me, while I am drawing up my articles. The
matter, Sir, is that, whereas --


Jos. What, is it a bankruptcy in the gazette?


Tot. Whereas, Sir, it has pleased Providence to close my father's account, and
to make me sole heir to eighty thousand marks, I intend instantly, and without
loss of time, to open account per matrimony -- to take a wife.


Leop. Right.


Jos. His choice is fixed on Louisa.


Leop. Right.


Tot. But Miss Louisa --


Jos. Will Not have him.


Tot. Don't interrupt my articles, Miss Josephine. Miss Louisa, Sir, draws
balance by refusal -- will not strike a barter -- but rather chooses to strike me
clear out of her books.


Leop. Very right.


Tot. Right! no, I say she is wrong; her mother's consent stands to credit -- (
Leopold starts and is affected) -- Mrs. Rose here --


Mrs. R. To be sure. Fortune leads to comfort.


Leop. ( recollecting himself) Very true.


Jos. But love, not fortune should lead to the altar.


Leop. Very true, likewise,


Tot. So we are all in the right then?


Leop. All.


Tot. And I get no wife.


Jos. Take me.

Enter VAN SNARL.
V. Sn. Come, come along, girls: come, gentlemen, the dinner is going in. Come,
Mr. Totum, you must dine with us today. Totum and I are partners today in
good fortune. Here, girls, I have not shown you the handsome snuff box I have
received from the Minister. Look at it, brother: Totum says it is worth two
thousand dollars. (gives the box to Leopold, who looks at it with indifference.)


Leop. I wish you joy.


Jos. Dear uncle, let me look at it. (Leopold gives the box to Josephine, by
whom it is handed to others, till it comes round again to Van Snarl, who during
the ensuing dialogue, puts it in his pocket without attending to it.)


V. Sn. Totum! why, how now? You look as sad as if your father was come to life
again. -- What Is the matter with you?


Jos. Cannot you guess, Papa?


V. Sn. What, has Louisa refused him? ( Totum shrugs his shoulders). I supposed
as much. Methinks a girl that has nothing but a smooth face to recommend her.
and her feet under a strange table, might give herself fewer airs. If I had not
the sweetest temper in the world --


Leop. You would on such an occasion remind her of her dependence on you. Fie,
brother, for shame!


V. Sn. What, Louisa behaves like a fool, and I am to be ashamed! Mr. Totum,
I Would have you know, brother, with eighty thousand marks in his bureau, has only
to hold out his hand, and on every finger hangs a bride.


Jos. Aye, such brides, Papa, as deserve hanging.


V. Sn. Well, a good dinner will put a silly girl out of his head. Come along,
children; where is my snuff box?


Leop. I gave it to Josephine.


Jos. And I handed it round to the company.


Loui. And I.


Adel. and Tot. And I.


V. Sn. But no one handed it to me again. (feels in his pockets).


Jos. No matter now: Mrs. Rose I see is growing impatient. The box will be
found again, I dare say.


V. Sn. It must be found again.


Leop. Well, after dinner. Come, your guests are waiting.


Mrs. R. And the soup will be stone cold.


V. Sn. Soup be d -- d! If all the soup in the town should freeze, I will not
stir, I tell you. I have never had my box again; here -- here are my pockets;
here is nothing, and here is nothing. (turns out both his pockets.)


Tot. Here are mine, to command. ( turns his pockets out; they contain only a
letter, which he opens and reads)

"Sir, this brings advice that your father departed this life yesterday, the
twenty-fifth instant, at four A. M. fifty nine minutes, three seconds, etc. etc.


V. Sn. ( turns to ADELBERT) Now, Sir, it is your turn.


Adel. ( appearing disturbed at the proposal) Sir!


V. Sn. I suppose, you will consent to what all the company must agree upon --
only for form's sake, you know.

( going to him.)
Adel. Stand off! You cannot be in earnest.


V. Sn. Joke or earnest, as you like. Gentlemen do not carry smuggled goods, I
suppose, in their pockets.


Adel. ( nettled) If that is meant as a joke, Sir, it is, without under-rating
it, a very clumsy one; but, if you are in earnest, I must inform you, that both
my birth and character place me so far beyond this low suspicion, that I will
sooner die than consent to give you the gross proof you require of your
absurdity. I utterly despise the meanness of your conduct; and leave you, lest,
by persisting in it, you should rouse me to convert the contempt I feel for
you, into chastisement. Exit.


V. Sn. The devil! -- we must not let him go -- (following him.)


Leop. Hold! do you know what it is to charge a gentleman thus, brother?


V. Sn. What do I care for a gentleman, when he hops off with my snuff box?


Loui. (with warmth) He has not got it -- it is impossible --


Leop. ( observing LOUISA) Ha! Louisa the defender of Adelbert!


Loui. Mr. Adelbert, I am sure, knows nothing of it. You may see that plain
enough in his face.


V. Sn. His face! why, zouuds! you don't expect to see the snuff box in his
forehead, do you? What do you say, Totum?


Tot. Set down circumstances -- cast up fairly -- sum total -- the Pole must
have the box --


V. Sn. Aye, that he has -- but come -- let us go to dinner -- he is not out of
the town. -- Plague on him, he has spoilt my stomach for today, I shall not be
able to touch a morsel for vexation -- Come -- oh! plague on that Pole!


Leop. We follow you, brother.

Exeunt V. SNARL, Mrs. ROSE, LEOPOLD, and TOTUM.
Jos. Louisa, what say you to this? Is Mr. Adelbert --


Loui. Guilty of a baseness? Ha! -- Oh, Josephine! my heart is ready to burst.
( crying.)


Jos. Why you seem very much interested about Mr. Adelbert, Louisa?


Loui. Who, I? -- dear, no! -- it is only, because -- because --


Jos. Because you cannot bear to see innocence suspected.


Loui. Yes, that is what I was just going to say -- that is it exactly.


Jos. Oh, nothing else to be sure. (archly)


Loui. No, indeed, it was nothing else. Nothing but -- Heigho! -- come,
Josephine, we must follow the company. Come. Hurries off with JOSEPHINE.


END OF THE SECOND ACT.
ACT III. An Apartment in VAN SNARL'S House.
SCENE I.
LEOPOLD holding ADELBERT by the hand, and pulling him forward into the room.
Leopold. NAY, nay -- yet come in -- this is a liberty I do not frequently take.
I love the world too little to force myself upon it -- but when a wrong is
offered to an innocent person, a very hermit may find cause to leave his cell.


Adel. I respect the justice of your sentiments, but I ought never to be seen
again in this house.


Leop. My brother has been in the wrong -- the box is found --


Adel. Probably.


Leop. The lining of his pocket was unsewed -- and the box slipped through it
--


Adel. And from such a trifle a man's honor is to be called in question!


Leop. My brother is ashamed of his behavior -- he will beg your pardon.


"Adel. I do not seek to witness the humiliation of another.


"Leop." He has been sharply reproved by all of us -- particularly by Louisa --
(observing Adelbert with attention.)


Adel. ( expresses surprise -- pauses --) By Louisa! -- Let all be forgotten --


Leop. The commission of my visit is then at an end. -- I could wish to prolong
it on my own account. Your manner has interested me -- will you answer me, as a
man, what I shall ask you?


Adel. As a man!


Leop. Yes, for I would make my enquiry as a man; who, though he shut himself
from the bustle of the world, as I do, should never lock up the kind impulses
of his heart toward a fellow creature.


Adel. I will answer you --


Leop. Your resentment of my brother's proposition was natural: but before you
avowed that resentment, I fancied that I remarked a certain embarrassment in
your manner, which appeared to proceed from some other cause than indignation.
What was that cause?


Adel. ( after a pause) False shame.


Leop. In what could that consist?


Adel. I am poor -- very poor --


Leop. Poverty is no dishonor.


Adel. Certainly none to me. To Poland, to my struggling country, I sacrificed
my wealth as I would have sacrificed my life, if it had required it -- My
country is no more, and we are wanderers on a burdened earth, finding no
refuge but in the hearts of the humane and virtuous.


Leop. But you are young, and industry might --


Adel. That has ever been my friend. The little talents with which the
affluence of my parents crowned my education, have preserved me from the
extremes of indigence. The spirit of Poland has supplied the rest.

( With warmth.)
Leop. Your gains then are probably small?


Adel. When beneath the gilded roofs of the wealthy, the social banquet
gladdens the heart, I take my solitary walk into the fields, and under heaven's
canopy I make my poor repast. Such was my intention today, before your brother
unexpectedly invited me to his table.


Leop. Go on.


Adel. You know what passed. Had I submitted to the search proposed, my scanty
meal must have been discovered.


Leop. ( expressing great surprise and emotion) Young man, we must be better
acquainted. Yet that cannot be without more confidence on your part.


Adel. I am a stranger -- an unknown exile --


Leop. Who yet chose rather to bear the harsh suspicion that wronged you, than
submit to that pity, which; however painful to you, would have exulted in your
relief.


Adel. Perhaps I acted from prejudice -- but let me confess my pride. Had one
contemptuous glance fallen on the humble pittance which I bore about me -- had
any one but smiled --


Leop. Had any one dared to smile, I -- I would have resented it.


Adel. You are warm, sir!


Leop. My heart is so. Young man, since your residence at my brother's I have
marked you, and am persuaded of your worth -- and if you will accept of a small
loan from me -- it will come from the hand of a friend -- do not reject it.


Adel. When I shall be unable to earn even the morsel which I concealed today,
I will come to you.


Leop. Give me your hand. ( they shake hands) Another time we will -- (looks
round in great agitation) Yonder comes Louisa -- let me see you again. At
another time if the recital be not painful to you, I will request your
confidence: and should it open afresh the wounds of your bosom, be persuaded
that you will meet a friend, who will strive to heal them -- one practiced in
sorrow -- one, whose delight it would be to pour out the balm of comfort, and
confer a happiness which he cannot hope himself to taste.


Exit. Enter LOUISA. Loui. I thought Mr. Leopold had not been gone, and I --
oh! dear me, you seem quite flurried -- I hope nothing has happened -- I hope
you have not done any thing, sir, to offend my -- to offend Mr. Leopold, sir?


Adel. Far from it, I hope -- he came just now to confer favors on me, which I
must not accept.


Loui. And do you mean to go, then -- from -- from this house, sir? -- (looks
down embarrassed) -- Indeed, I am sorry --


Adel. Do you take an interest in my fate, Louisa? -- Beware of that.


Loui. Beware! -- and why so?


Adel. Because poverty, which in general silences the feelings, is not always
master over the heart.


Loui. But the poor have hearts like other people -- and when the heart is
good, why should poverty silence it?


Adel. The rich only dare to speak its language -- A man like Totum dares to
offer you his hand, he dares to say -- I love you --


Lou. And what signifies his saying that? I Am sure I don't mind what he says.


Adel. It signifies something, Louisa -- for the rich man is at least received
with politeness, the poor one, however worthy in other respects, is rejected
with scorn.


Lou. Then they who reject a worthy man, because he is poor, never deserve a
rich one, I am certain.


Enter VAN SNARL. V. Sn. Mr. Adelbert. I -- I am come to beg your pardon -- I
have found --


Adel. I beg that not a word may be spoken on the subject.


V. Sn. Why may not I say, I found myself in the wrong? Surely it is not for the
pleasure of saying it --


Adel. Mr. Leopold has explained all.


V. Sn. Oh, very well, and now I mean to make you amends.


Adel. Amends!


V. Sn. Ah, it goes against a man's stomach, to be sure, -- but I must make you
an apology -- Leopold says I must, -- they all say I must -- It Is cursed
disagreeable -- but I must make you amends -- so you see I do it with a good
grace. I Am come to tell you, that I am just sending out a ship, and you shall
go supercargo.


Adel. Indeed! My gratitude robs me of words to thank you.


Loui. (alarmed and full of emotion) Will you go, Adelbert?


Adel. To gain an honest livelihood! to be restored to honest industry! Oh!
heavens!


V. Sn. She will sail for Africa next month.


Loui. Oh! what, will you go to Africa!


Adel. ( with surprise) for Africa!


V. Sn. You shall not be at a farthing expense. I am determined to do the thing
handsomely. I Will freight her myself; you shall only have to purchase negroes --
(Adel. shudders) What is the matter with you?


Adel. Humbled though I am, in poverty and in affliction; harrassed by daily
cares, and wounded by hourly regrets -- the bread I earn shall never force a
tear from the helpless, nor bring remorse to my repast.


V. Sn. So now I must not make him amends -- I Am not to have my own way in any
thing. What, then, you despise my offer? Go on with your romantic notions: --
Here Is a pretty couple of you! -- one does not choose a husband with eighty
thousand marks, and the other will not go to sea to make his fortune for life. I
wish you had nothing but sentiment and romance to eat for a fortnight, and by
that time, you, Miss, would take Tilman Totum, with eighty thousand marks, and
you, sir, without a pound in your pocket, would be glad to sail to the coast of
Guinea -- Zounds! if I had not the sweetest temper in the world, I should be
kept in a perpetual passion.


Exit Van Snarl. (Louisa appears agitated, and Adelbert observes her
anxiously.) Adel What agitates you, Louisa


Loui. You have a kind heart, Mr. Adelbert, for every one but yourself -- You
will not go, then, to make your fortune? Oh, dear, if you had gone -- Mr. Totum
Would then have asked me again to marry him.


Adel. And would you have accepted him?


Loui. No, never -- though he were ten times as rich as he is.


(A pause for a few moments.) Adel. Does my heart deceive me, or do I read
yours aright, Louisa?


Loui. What do you mean?


Adel. Were you ever in love, Louisa?


Loui. Lord! that is a strange question --


Adel. And I have perhaps no right to ask it.


Loui. Why, though you have lived a whole year in this house, we know nothing
of you, to be sure, but that you come from Poland, and that we should hardly
know either, but from your dress.


Adel. Would you listen with patience to my story, if I should disclose it to
you, and you alone?


Loui. With patience! Ah! I wish you would try.


Adel. Well, -- during the last struggles of our expiring state, though private
and important duties detained me at a distance, I embarked my whole fortune on
the side of those, who, even against a victorious enemy, wished to defend their
native country -- you know the result -- my situation here speaks it -- except
a trifling stipend that is still left to me, I have no remaining possession but
health, no hope but industry -- Alas! my poor country!


Loui. And can you be happy no where but in Poland, Mr. Adelbert?


Adel. I might yet be happy -- I might -- I struggle in vain against myself --
Reason forgets to speak, and my heart betrays me. ( he kneels to Louisa.)


Loui. Oh, dear! you frighten me out of my wits -- if any one should come --


Adel. Hope only can raise me from the ground -- (Louisa hides her face with
one hand, and holds out the other to Adelbert, who seizes it and presses it
with rapture to his lips) Then I am happy -- My banishment, my wrongs, my
sufferings, all -- all are now a dream. Will you indeed share my poverty? Oh!
then we will make it a lot the richest ones shall envy. The dawn shall light me
forth to industry, and the dews of evening shall warn me from my work. Love
shall season our scanty meal, and the husband, returning from his toil, shall
enjoy, in contentment and affection, a kindlier rest than lights upon the downy
beds of palaces.


Loui. Oh! but I am not so poor as you imagine -- ( Adelbert starts) I am not
the orphan of a clergyman.


Adel. No!


Loui. I have a father, and a rich one too.


Adel. Rich! then all my hopes of happiness are crushed at once.


Loui. No -- don't say so: I am sure, when he knows you, he must be so proud of
you!


Adel. The poor Adelbert dared to lift his eyes to the poor Louisa. The rich
Louisa is lost to him -- Honor is my tyrant -- I obey, against my will -- but I
obey. Ah! Louisa!


Enter JOSEPHINE. Jos. Bravo, children -- ( both start) when lovers are caught
--


Adel. (embarrassed) Do not imagine that --


Jos. That you are in love? oh, no -- it is impossible; you are a great deal too
old for that.


Adel. I should be sorry if you thought that Louisa --


Jos. Was in love? Oh! no certainly; she is a great deal too young.


Adel. I assure you that --


Jos. That she hates you: Is that the case, Louisa? You see she has not the
heart to deny it: and you, sir, can you venture to confess? --


Adel. Who can look at Louisa without admiration?


Jos. Nay, that is a very rude speech when there is another woman in the room.


Adel. But to love her is a blissful privilege denied to me.


Jos. And why so, pray?


Adel. Because I am poor.


Loui. And I am rich.


Jos. Oh, you are in the right. (to Adel) You are a good-natured soul, and you
know what a plague it is to share a fortune with the person whom we love best,
and so would save Louisa that trouble. Well, I grant you a twelvemonth for
reflection; Louisa will then be nineteen, and you may by that time resolve to
accept her with the encumbrance of her fortune. In the mean time promise me you
will not take any rash step, that may make Louisa unhappy.


Adel. You shall dispose of me. bows and exit.


Jos. Oh, then it is all very well. Make yourself easy, Louisa: the man is
young, and we shall manage him.


Exit Louisa and Jos. SCENE II. A Hall in Van Snarl's house.
Enter NICOLAS, laughing. I fagg's we have got a pretty visitor today, sure
enough. Whod'ye please to speak with, sir, says I. Any body, says he. And who
be I to say, sir, that you be? Any body, says he again -- Odzooks, here he is
following me.

Enter HANS WILLIAM, walks across the stage singing and whistling. Nic. Be
pleased to sit here awhile, sir; and I Will go on without any body, to see if any
body is at home.


Exit Nicolas laughing to himself. H. Will. So, Hans William, here you are -- My
father has an odd way of thinking; -- I shall be more inclined to follow my own
-- Eh! yonder is a nice girl -- I wish that may be Josephine. Enter JOSEPHINE.
-- Good morning, young lady.


Jos. It is rather afternoon than morning.


H. Will. Not where the day breaks so brightly.


Jos. Very gallant, truly -- May I take the liberty to ask --


H. Will. Who I am? -- I am a queer fellow.


Jos. Well, but queer fellows have names.


H. Will. Mine is Timothy Trifle, at your service; -- "Plain Timothy with the
men -- dear Timothy with the women."


"Jos. With all of them?


"H. Will. With all who wish to please me." -- And now, what is your name?


Jos. My -- my name is Louisa Rose. I am a poor clergyman's orphan, who live in
this house. Perhaps you have business with Mr. Van Snarl?


H. Will. But I have with his daughter?


Jos. With his daughter?


H. Will. They say she has a great fortune; and, about six weeks ago, says my
mother one evening, to me -- "Dear Timothy, you are a poor fellow, and must
make your fortune by marriage.


Jos. Very wisely.


H. Will. Very motherly, you mean. There Is Mr. Van Snarl, says she, your
father's old school-fellow, has a most charming daughter -- I dare say you must
know her.


Jos. Oh, to be sure -- I know Josephine as well as I know myself.


H. Will. Is she handsome?


Jos. When she consults her looking-glass, she shinks so.


H. Will. Is she like you?


Jos. She is not handsomer than I am.


H. Will. I like that -- she has no need. -- Has she good sense?


Jos. Not enough to prevent her from talking.


H. Will. Well, I like that -- Is she kind hearted, good to the poor?


Jos. Oh, lord! the poor get nothing in this house, if I do not give it them.


H. Will. I don't like that. Is she grave or lively?


Jos. As wild as a young devil.


H. Will. Aye! Then she will just do for me.


Jos. But there is one thing, Mr. Queerfellow, with your -- I like that, and I
don't like that, that is against you: -- Josephine's hand is promised.


H. Will. To whom?


Jos. To a young man at Amsterdam -- one Hans William.


H. Will. Oh, I know him. -- I Will rid her of that booby.


Jos. What sort of a man is he?


H. Will. He? A stupid, pedantic fellow, with a full-bottom'd wig.


Jos. Oh, lord!


H. Will. A shrill voice, and bandy legs.


Jos. Oh, lord! I don't like that.


H. Will. You don't like it? How does it concern you then?


Jos. Oh, it is nothing at all to me, to be sure -- only for my friend's sake. (
Aside) So I had nearly betrayed mysell. -- Do you wish to see my father, Sir?


H. Will. Your father!


Jos. My friend's father, I mean. ( Going.)


H. Will. Hold, hold, a moment (looks steadfastly in her face.) Your name is
Louisa Rose. It may be; -- there is not a rose-bed in Christendom, that would
refuse to own you; but deuce take me if I believe you. -- Shall I tell you your
real name?


Jos. Well, what is it?


H. Will. Josephine.


Jos. And what makes you suppose so?


H. Will. I don't suppose -- I am certain. -- You discovered the husband in my
features at first sight, and you thought it your duty to impose upon me
instantly.


Jos. You are a devil. Runs off.


H. Will. Bravo, Hans William! -- That Is just the girl for you. Oh, here comes
old Van Snarl, I suppose: -- Egad, I Will have nothing to say to him, till I know
whether that be Josephine, or not.


Enter VAN SNARL. V. Sn. Your servant, Sir. (H. WILL. whistles) Here Is a pretty
fellow! -- My daughter tells me you desire to speak with me.


H. Will. Oh, that is your daughter, is she?


V. Sn. Why whose should she be? -- Next I Am not to be father of my own
children. She tells me your name is Trifle.


H. Will. You recollect the name well enough, I suppose?


V. Sn. Never heard it in my life.


H. Will. When you were at school, with the old Doctor with a red nose, and used
to steal peaches in company with Tom Trifle.


V. Sn. Tom Trifle! -- Who is he?


H. Will. My father, Sir, your poor school-fellow.


V. Sn. Poor! Zounds, Sir, I do not know any thing of him. If you have nothing
particular to say to me --


H. Will. I have a letter to you from my father -- The deuce! I have left that
plaguey letter at the inn.


V. Sn. There you may leave it then.


H. Will. I Will run and fetch it in a moment.


V. Sn. You may break your neek by the way, if you choose. I desire you will never
step your foot over my threshold again.


H. Will. Stay, old gentleman -- stay till I return with the letter -- I Will make
you remember Tom Trifle, depend on it.


Exit H. WILL. V. Sn. Puppy! These young fellows, nowadays, have no more
respect for riches than they have for manners.

( going.)
Enter LEOPOLD, meeting him. Leop. Brother, lend me the master-key of your
house.


V. Sn. What is it for?


Leop. I cannot tell you at present.


V. Sn. Then I cannot lend it you at present. -- Do You intend to set all my
doors wide open today? -- First comes my daughter, "Pappa, lend me the
master-key." -- She is hardly gone, when you come, "Brother, lend me the
master-key." -- Every body wants me to lend them something.


Leop. Surely thou don't distrust me?


V. Sn. I don't say that: -- I know you will not rob me; but it is fair enough to
refuse you for all that.


Leop. On what account?


V. Sn. who has got English patent locks to his doors, oh?


Leop. For that I have a particular reason.


V. Sn. Who sits whole days locked up in his room, eh?


Leop. I wish to be alone.


V. Sn. Who has a mysterious cabinet* in which no mortal has dared to set foot
for years together.


Leop. That Is my fancy.


V. Sn. Well, and it is my fancy not to lend you the master key. I have my
particular reasons as well as you, only I Am not so unbrotherly minded; but that
is no wonder -- you have not such a remarkable sweet temper as I have -- There,
there is the key, but take notice, if I miss a single bottle of wine, you shall
be answerable for it.


Exit Van Snarl. Leop He is in the right -- but I dare not open my heart to
him. He would not understand it. Could I indeed find the bosom of a friend!


Enter LOUISA. (LEOPOLD turns and starts at perceiving her.) Loui. I hope I
don't interrupt you, sir.


Leop. Come in, Louisa, you can never be unwelcome.


Loui. You are so good, and yet I am afraid you are not happy.


Leop. I was once happy: That Is the proudest boast that mortality allows.


Loui. And why cannot you be happy again? I Am sure all good people, who know
you, must wish to make you so.


Leop. Few are the hearts, Louisa, that keenly feel for the distress of others:
those few the miserable cannot seek -- but when once they find them -- Oh!
heaven!


lifting up his hands with great emotion. Loui. I am an orphan; and it
signifies so little what a poor girl, like me, feels for the distress of other
people, that I am afraid to tell you how many tears you have cost me.


Leop. Tears for me!


Loui. I am too young, to be sure, to ask you questions about yourself; but if
I had a right -- if I were your relation, now -- your daughter, or --


Leop. Would to heaven!


Loui. Hav'nt you a daughter?


Leop. I have.


Loui. Is she about my age?


Leop. Yes, thereabout.


Loui. And why don't you let her live with you?


Leop. Dear girl, spare me! do not repeat that question.


Loui. Has she offended you?


Leop. Never.


Loui. Then you do not love her; that is a sure thing.


Leop. She is my only happiness on earth!


Loui. Then why have you banished the poor soul your presence?


Leop. ( warmly) Who says so? Those with whom she lives -- and must live yet
for a short time -- are excellent people.


Loui. But they are not her parents. She does not find the care of a fond
mother.


Leop. Oh, heaven! -- She has no mother!


Loui. That Is a great pity, when she does not find a father.


Leop. Cease, girl! cease! ( after a pause) Pity my sorrows


Loui. indeed I wish to share them. Do let me speak to you. Death has robbed
you of a wife, but you have still a daughter left: she would be almost wild
with joy, if she could fill her mother's place in your affection -- Why will
you not call her to you?


Leop. She shall come.


Loui. And, till she comes, do look on me as your daughter -- let me dry your
tears, and kiss the hand a daughter should kiss. Takes his hand and kisses it.


Leop. Louisa, you have shaken my soul. I cannot account for the power you have
over me -- Yes, I will disclose to you the very sanctuary of my grief -- Come
to my apartment an hour hence -- It is sacred to sorrow -- sacred, alas! have I
kept it -- nor have I suffered the foot of a stranger to profane the threshold.
-- For one hour adieu, Louisa! -- Remember -- be punctual.


Exeunt LOUISA and LEOPOLD on opposite sides. END OF THE THIRD ACT.
ACT IV. Apartment in Van Snarl's House.
SCENE I.
Enter Mrs. ROSE, NICOLAS, and another Servant. Nicolas. WHAT is the matter,
Mrs. Rose?


Mrs. R. There is a crowd about them at the inn: they fought with swords, as if
flesh and blood were made of wood.


Nic. Well, but who are they?


Mrs. R. Oh, I don't wish to know -- somebody said it was our Polish lodger --
but heaven forbid! -- a couple of wild wretches -- I Am certain they never read
my husband's sermon on duelling -- the last sermon my poor dear Dr. Olearius
ever preached --


Nic. Are they wounded?


Mrs. R. Oh! I dare say they are both killed -- they fought together, one like
a cannibal, the other like a hottenpot --


Enter TOTUM. Tot. Fine doings! five gashes, three side-cuts, and an eye-let
hole -- The Pole is a pretty fellow.


Nic. Mr. Adelbert!


Tot. The young gentleman wanted a bleeding.


Mrs. R. What, is Mr. Adelbert wounded?


Tot. The point of the sword made entry by his windpipe, proved a running
account in his ribs, and carried over into the heart -- I think he is a safe man.


Mrs. R. Oh, mercy! let us go and enquire about him. Oh, that he had read my
husband's last sermon on duels!


Exeunt Mrs. Rose and servants. Tot. Ha! -- Louisa will now be mistress Totum
-- Ha! no rival now -- The Pole's done for, Ha! Scratch out the Pole, Ha! Exit.


SCENE II.
ADELBERT'S Apartment, with an inner room and closet; and a window looking into
the street -- A small box standing on the table -- A trunk in the corner of the
room. LOUISA opens the door, and enters timorously -- then treading softly,
goes toward the window and looks out. Loui. No, he is not coming; I am safe
for a few minutes at least -- poor soul! he is wounded, and perhaps he cannot
come home yet -- he will want a great many things, which money can procure for
him -- so let me make haste and give him all I have. ( she takes the bill of
exchange from her bosom) Now where shall I put this note, that he may see it
directly? On the table -- no, it will not be safe -- ( tries to open the box on
the table) Stay, this is not locked -- he cannot help seeing it here, when he
opens the box. -- (laying the paper in the box and addressing herself to it)
Don't you let any body take you out, but my Adelbert, and when you come to his
hands, tell him (takes up the note and kisses it) there, tell him that, Now if
I can get back to my own room before any one asks for me, ( goes toward the
door) Oh! dear! hark I hear somebody on the stairs. "If Adelbert should have
come back -- No, it is impossible in this short time (listens) they are coming"
-- If I should be found here -- cannot I hide myself? -- this door is open
(goes into an inner room.)


LEOPOLD opens the door cautiously -- Enters. Leop. So -- I might have passed
without the master-key. It is plain the young gentleman has little to lose, or
less suspicion of losing it -- Well, here is a man with whom I can hold
fellowship -- to whom I can at last open a burdened heart -- a comfort so long
denied to me! (Louisa, overhearing, clasps her hands with expressions of great
affection) Spite of that noble pride which disdains to lie under an obligation,
I will enjoy the pleasure of conferring one on him -- this for a beginning (
takes a roleau from his pocket) where shall I put the money? -- This box -- Aye
it is open (opens the box and sees the note) Eh! what is this! the very bill I
sent by yesterday's post to my daughter! how can it have come into this man's
box? -- Could the servant I sent with the letter have opened it? -- he is
seemingly honest -- nay I know him to be so -- "Fie, fie, I Am ashamed of myself
when I suspect an honest man." Surely Adelbert could not ( discovers suspicion
and horror) -- could not have recourse to means, I shudder even to think of! --
at least it is ground of reasonable suspicion -- Shall I take back the note? --
No! What right have I to take out of a stranger's chest, a paper, which I sent
to Frankfort fifteen hours since! -- a perfect riddle! I Will leave it where I
found it (puts the note again in the box) my money too shall stay where it was
-- (puts the roleau in his pocket) and now back to my solitary chamber, till
some fortunate conjecture shall make me once more hope that man is not
altogether hateful! Exit Leopold.


LOUISA comes out from the inner room. Loui. Oh, mercy! what have I done?
Instead of helping poor Adelbert, I have brought him into a suspicion of the
basest guilt. What can I do! I must e'n go and tell my father who I am, come of
it what may. Yes, I Will tell him all -- dear, dear, I do tremble so! -- let me
get away before I Am caught again ( goes to the door -- starts and runs back
again frightened) Oh, mercy! there is somebody else -- this time perhaps it is
Adelbert himself! -- I feel as if I had done wrong -- but heaven knows my
innocent intentions; I Will hide myself once more. ( retuns into the inner room.)


TOTUM puts his head in at the door. Tot. Eh! door open! now for a peep (
enters) nobody here -- Pole wounded -- stopped at hotel -- post time to debit and
proceed. Now, sure as my name is Tilman Totum, I Will balance the Pole's books --
"if detected, transfer account to my master, and declare I went by orders."


Loui. (looking out) What can Mr. Totum want, I wonder! --


Tot. (looks round the room with contempt) Light stock in warehouse -- soon
taken -- "small compass -- credit trouble and thought." -- Quick -- first look
over papers -- Eh! no desk! no books! -- a fellow of no account! -- Oh! may be
he writes in his closet -- look into back shop.


( goes into the closet.) Loui. (coming from the inner room) I am frightened
out of my wits -- he does not perceive me, and I Will seize this moment to make
my escape -- I cannot guess his design, but. whatever it may be, I Will lock the
door after me, and leave him to answer for it.

Exit LOUISA, and locks the door without.
Tot. (returns) Egad, he is a deep one. Where can he keep the balance sheet?
must have private books somewhere -- (sees the box on the table) -- Oh, ho!
here we have him -- now see contents -- now we'll detect the spy -- (takes out
the bill of exchange and reads.) "On demand pay to this my order, the sum of
three hundred crowns." Accepted too! As good as Bank -- ah, your spies must
have the wherewith ( reads again) "Le -- o -- " What! "Leopold Van" -- drawn by
my master's brother! Zounds, this is forgery! "Aye, aye, this is the use he
makes of getting his head into good books." We'll go over a few more folios
here. ( draws a chair to the table, sits down and begins to rummage the box.)
If I can barely find enough to hang him, that is all, (rummaging) that is all the
harm I wish him. Hark! did not I hear something? ( Rises suddenly, replaces
every thing in the box, except the note, and shuts the box hastily, which
closes with a spring-lock.) I Will take a peep down the street, to be sure that
Mr. Iron-driver is not nearer than I suspect. ( He runs to the window, looks
out, and starts.) Oh, here is a blunder; here is a scratch -- Zounds! here is Old
Scratch himself. Yonder comes the Pole; I see his head. Whip off with the box
-- Egad, the best way. -- (Takes up the box and goes toward the door.) --
"We'll have a halter for you, Mr. Forgery, and then see whose is the safest
head; yours with a rope round it, or Tilman Totum's with eighty thousand marks
to credit." ( Goes to the door, tries to open it, and finds it locked.) Eh!
how is this? the door fast! -- O Lord! I am checked. A plague on him; I hear him
at the foot of the staircase -- there are only thirty-four steps, two landing
places, and a turning, between me and a sword through my body. Oh, the devil!
here he is on the stairs. Lets return the note -- (sets the box down on the
table, and tries to open it.) Devil on devil! the box shuts with a spring-lock,
and the lid is fast. "O lud, if this piece of forgery is found upon me, I shall
be brought in an accomplice, and then there'll be a halter for me." I have
opened a fine head of account here. Where shall I put the note? Here is a trunk
as large as our ledger. I Will insert it here; he will not think of opening this.
"At least the note will be wrote off from my head."


( Opens the trunk, flings the note into it, and shuts it again.) Enter
ADELBERT and HANS WILLIAM. Tot. Mr. Adelbert, your most obliged and obedient.


Adel. Mr. Totum, how did you come into my room?


Tot. Brought forward per door, Sir.


Adel. I left my door locked.


Tot. Closed; pardon me, it stood open, I swear; though there is no occasion to
swear that, because it is true.


Adel. But we found it shut this moment.


Tot. Why, yes; while I was just looking out at the window, a sudden draft came
in per chimney, and closed the account -- closed the door, I mean.


Adel. And locked it too?


Tot. Locked it! Oh, perhaps it shuts with a spring, ( aside) like some other
cursed locks.


Adel. It does not turn without a key.


Tot. No? not turn! -- then it must have been an Eddy wind, -- a sort of
tornado -- we suffer much by them in our trade.


Adel. And pray, Sir, what might occasion me the honor of this visit?


Tot. O Lord, Sir, your chamber commands such a fine view of the forest! I was
just taking a peep, looking over your leaves -- the leaves of your trees, I
mean. Charming green fields, Sir! smooth as, the desks in our counting house.
What beautiful geese, Sir, on the common yonder! good quills, I warrant;
eighteen stivers per dozen. You would find them excellent for book-keeping.


ADELBERT and HANS WILLIAM express contempt of TOTUM. H. Will. Come, you forget
that you are wounded.


Adel. A mere scratch on the wrist.


Tot. Scratches are sometimes serious things.


Adel. A little balsam will cure it; tomorrow there will scarcely remain a
scar -- ( goes into the inner-room.)


Tot. (aside) Now is my time for getting out without loss. ( to H. WILL.) I am
glad to find our friend so little damaged, Sir. I wish you a good afternoon,
Sir.


H. Will. Stay, Sir; I could not pardon myself, if I did not declare to every
one the noble assistance I have received from that gentleman.


Tot. Another time I shall be happy to attend -- I wish you a good afternoon,
Sir.


H. Will. I Will tell it you in a few words.


Tot. ( with great impatience) As few as you please. -- I have three bills to
forward to Amsterdam, seven letters of advice, thirteen dunners, all for
night's post; to be ready at nine, P. M.


H. Will. As I was finishing my wine this afternoon at the Hotel, I engaged a
party at Faro, which was at my side. ( points to his left hand.)


Tot. Yes, debtor's side.


H. Will. I knew no one: a man in the dress of an officer held the bank, so,
without scruple, I punted high, and lost a good round sum. On this I wanted to
force the game, and put an hundred ducats on one card.


Tot. Yes, a hundred ducats; exactly that sum I shall send to agent at Leipsig
tomorrow; three notes ready in iron chest, No. 21, three months date, No. 29
--


H. Will. Well, well, but, my friend yonder in his bedroom, whose name I don't
know, stood leaning on a chair, and observing the game. -- You don't attend to
me. (TOTUM looks frequently to the door of the bed-room.)


Tot. Yes -- I do -- Sir; attention is the best point of business -- I am
attending, Sir -- to -- ( aside) see how I can get off before I am caught by
the Pole again.


H. Will. The card turned against me, and I was pushing the cash to the bank;
stop, Sir, cried he, take your money back; you are cheated. (TOT. draws back,
H. WILL. follows.)


Tot. Yes -- cheated.


H. Will. Up jumps the bank-holder, insults my friend; both drew their swords,
and before we could part them, both were wounded.


Tot. Double entry -- good check -- very extraordinary indeed. I wish you a
good afternoon, sir. ( Adelbert returns from the inner room, and advances.
Totum going out, meets him) A plague! Here is the Pole again.


Adel. ( holding his wrist with the other hand) There, it is dressed. Mr.
Totum, be so good to lift the lid of that trunk, and take out a ribbon which
lies at the top.


Tot. Sir! take out! -- excuse me, sir, I never take any thing out of other
people's trunks.


Adel. You see my hands are engaged. If you will be so obliging to tie the
ribbon, which you will find there, round my wrist, by tomorrow the whole story
will be forgotten.


H. Will. I shall never forget it.


Tot. ( opening the trunk, and taking out the ribbon, which he ties hastily on
Adelbert's wrist) Well, if I must I -- but you had better close the trunk
again, sir.


Adel. (looks into the trunk and takes out the bill of exchange) What Is this? a
bill of exchange!


Tot. A bill of exchange!


Adel. Where did this come from?


Tot. ( aside) As if he did not know where it came from -- Oh! no doubt,
arrived per mail -- post to credit -- goods delivered.


Adel. How came it into my trunk?


Tot. Oh, every body knows that. -- When received, wrote on to cash, and then
put under lid.


Adel. I Am all amazement! ( a moment's pause) Mr. Totum, this must be your deed.


Tot. Mine, sir! You don't believe, sir, that I --


Adel. It is hard to believe, indeed; but all circumstances considered -- This
gentleman shall judge. When I went out this morning, I left nothing but a few
trifles of apparel in my trunk, and at my return I find you locked in my room,
and here a note of exchange. It is in vain to deny it; you must have put it
into my trunk.


Tot. Well, sir -- if I must confess, I did put it into the trunk, but --


Adel. Generous man! how have I mistaken you! -- You saw me cast down by
misfortune, and wished to lift me from the ground. But this, sir, cannot be
accepted.


Tot. Zounds! it is accepted already. You have only to offer it for payment,
and then -- (aside) we'll have you taken up for forgery, and lift you from the
ground presently.


Adel. Mr. Totum, I must insist on your taking it.


Tot. Take it! I would not take it at discount.


Adel. Can you refuse to take back three hundred crowns?


Tot. Certainly one would be very glad to take three hundred crowns -- but --
but --


"Adel. It is your property." You owned you put it into my trunk.


Tot. Yes -- but I swear I found it in your box.


Adel. That is impossible. I have not so much wealth in the world. If it do not
come from you --


Tot. From me! I protest before this gentleman, I have nothing to do with it.


Adel. Then I must entreat you, at least, to carry it back to the person from
whom it came.


Tot. ( aside) That person is the devil. -- I beg to be excused, Sir. I don't
keep cash there. I don't know the parties.


Adel. Sir, I insist on it.


Tot. I cannot, indeed Sir.


Adel. You offend me.


Tot. I am sorry for it Sir; but --


Adel. I beg --


Tot. I can by no means -- I -- I -- (sees the door open) I wish you a good
afternoon, Sir. I see the door's open, and so -- egad, here is a bolt for it.
(runs out.)


H. Will. Do you really think such a fellow as that capable of an act of
generosity?


Adel. No -- but the generous Leopold --


H. Will. Be who he may, has chosen a vile deputy. But let that pass -- one
thing is clear -- from what I have now witnessed -- you are possessed of every
thing that a brave man should have, except money. My purse is at your command
-- you have opened my heart already; and I should think myself a mean wretch
indeed, if, when the strings of my heart are touched, those of my purse did not
instantly follow.


Adel. The debt that lies on your heart, pay in the heart's coin, when you
please. At present I am in no want of money.


H. Will. I heartily wish you were for my own sake. Do you know you have brought
me into a house where I am no stranger?


Adel. As a merchant, the house of Van Snarl cannot be unknown to you.


H. Will. That Is not all: I have a close speculation here on the person of one
Louisa Rose.


Adel. ( starts) Louisa Rose!


H. Will. Do you know her?


Adel. (embarrassed, but recollecting himself) Yes.


H. Will. You do! then there is really such a person?


Adel. There is only one Louisa Rose in the world.


H. Will. I comprehend -- Hans William, you are come here a day too late. Is she
rich?


Adel. Unfortunately she is.


Hans Will. Unfortunately! for whom?


Adel. What have I said! pardon me, my friend. You have an honest open
countenance, and it led me half way to a confession, which --


H. Will. You may very safely entrust to me -- Go on.


Adel. A confidence so rashly ventured --


H. Will. Is, I own, as rare as the generous action, by which you have made me
your friend for life.


Adel. I cannot resist you -- yes, I love Louisa -- the agitation in which you
see me, will tell you how much I love her. While I believed her the orphan of a
poor and humble clergyman, I flattered myself I might have obtained her -- but,
alas! --


H. Will. What! did not Von Snarl acknowledge her for his daughter?


Adel. Louisa his daughter!


H. Will. He told me so himself just now --


Adel. She said her father was rich! ( with emotion.)


H. Will. I am to marry her.


Adel. (starts) You are to marry her!


H. Will. I came hither for no other purpose.


Adel. And will you marry her?


H. Will. ( holds out his hand to ADELBERT) What! and break the heart of a man
who has risked his life for me! give me your hand. (they shake hands) If you
cannot make an answer for me to that question, I Will make none for myself.


Adel. But I heard of a match that was in treaty for Josephine.


H. Will. Josephine! well, that is she, is it not?


Adel. I don't understand you.


H. Will. Von Snarl has but one daughter, has he?


Adel. Did not you say Louisa too was his daughter?


H. Will. Eh! -- I begin to suspect some mistake -- let us examine, if you
please.


Adel. You came to this house to marry Louisa --


H. Will. No: I came to marry Josephine, Von Snarl's daughter.


Adel. And who wants to force Louisa on you?


H. Will. Why, are not Josephine and Louisa the same person?


Adel. By no means.


H. Will. Then one of them has made a fool of me. Which of the two is the
merrier?


Adel. Josephine.


H. Will. Hurra! that is my girl then! -- shake hands again -- the first was a
sentimental shake, and this is a merry one. We shall not be rivals.


Adel. Again I do not comprehend you.


H. Will. Why, the truth is, I am very properly served -- I came into this house
under a false name, and the girls have outwitted me -- Josephine suspected my
design, and passed herself on me for Louisa Rose. I Will be revenged; though egad,
I like her better than ever.


Adel. Then you know nothing of Louisa?


H. Will. I never imagined, till this moment, that there was such a person in
existence. I Will go down and look for that merry girl again, and if I find her
-- ( going.) One word before I go, my dear new friend -- You perceive I am
likely to have some interest in this house, and if it can avail you with
Louisa, you shall find that the mark a rascal has left on your wrist, will be
much sooner worn away than the impression you have made on an honest man's
heart. Come along.


Exeunt HANS WILLIAM and ADELBERT. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.
ACT V.
SCENE I. A Hall in Van Snarl's House.
Enter Mrs. ROSE, with keys in her hand, JOSEPHINE following. Josephine. MRS.
Rose!


Mrs. R Aye, to be sure! Mrs. Rose must be every where at once! Well, child,
what do you want with Mrs. Rose?


Jos. I thought I saw Mr. Adelbert return.


Mrs. R. Yes, yes, he has come home sure enough.


Jos. And a young gentleman with him --


Mrs. R. A young gentleman! -- I was on the staircase, with a sugar loaf under
my arm -- so I stopped and made a curtsy. Mr. Adelbert bowed very politely, I
must say that for him -- but the other young gentleman brushed by me, as if he
would have knocked me down.


Jos. He was attentive only to his friend, who was wounded.


Mrs. R. Manners are good at all times, say I.

Enter LOUISA. Well, Louisa --


Jos. Have you heard what occasioned the duel?


Loui. Oh! it was such a generous action of Mr. Adelbert, to --


Mrs. R. A generous action! to thrust a sword through a man's body! You have
forgot, I fancy, what excellent things my husband said in his sermon against
duels -- Poor dear Mr. Olearius!


Loui. Dear mother, if you would now but step up to poor Mr. Adelbert --
perhaps he wants help -- you have several fine receipts for wounds, you know.


Mrs. R. Child, I have a great many excellent wound balsams -- but I step up
into the young man's room! -- You know before one has come to a certain age --


Loui. A certain age! -- and what does that signify? I think at any time of
life we should give our help to a fellow creature, when it is wanted.


Mrs. R. You are right, my dear -- When we can be useful, we must sometimes
disregard slanderous tongues; -- so I Will carry Mr. Adelbert the black ointment,
which stands on the chimney in my room -- but don't let any body know it.


Jos. There Is only that young man there -- he will not tell.


Mrs. R. Oh, mercy! if it should be known that I visited a young man in his
bed-room! -- however, I Will carry him the black ointment. Exit Mrs. Rose.


Loui. Now, my dear Josephine, let me tell you what has passed -- but I am so
confused, I can hardly speak.


Jos. For joy or grief?


Loui. Oh! for both. In the first place, -- my father --


Jos. Whose whims begin to tire me --


Loui. I summoned up all my courage, and spoke to him -- and am so happy --


Jos. Well -- what has passed?


Loui. He promised to tell me all his sorrows,


Jos. Then I don't wonder at your being so happy. -- Upon my word you are much
obliged to him --


Loui. And he desired me to meet him in his room --


Jos. And are you prepared in what you will say to him?


Loui. No, not I -- but my heart will be full -- and then I warrant I shall not
want words to tell it is meaning.


H. Will. ( without) Josephine! Josephine!


Jos. Who calls me?


[Louisa goes to the side of the stage, Hans Willian enters and seizes her
hand.] H. Will. Oh! are you found by your true name? eh! who is this? I beg a
thousand pardons, ma'm --


Jos. Ha! ha! fairly caught! Give me leave sir, to introduce you to this young
lady. This is miss Josephine -- My dear Josephine, this is Mr. Timothy Trifle.


Loui. Sir, my name is Louisa Rose --


H. Will. Another Louisa Rose? and yet I heard a person in this house, say just
now, that there is but one Louisa Rose in the world -- ( Josephine smiles,
Louisa blushes) Well, my dear Louisa Roses, inform me where I may find the real
genuine Josephine?


Jos. What is your pleasure, sir, with her?


H. Will. Exactly this -- if you are both Louisa Rose, I have no business with
either of you -- but if you are both Josephine, I Am resolved I Will marry you
both.


Loui. Is not this the gentleman you expected today?


Jos. What, my lover, Hans William? Oh, no, he wears a full bottomed wig, has a
shrill voice, and is bandy-legg'd.


H. Will. He is very like me, for all that.


Jos. No. I have been expecting him this whole morning, and in the mean time
comes this saucy --


H. Will. Take care what you are going to call me --


( Louisa is going) Jos. Stay, Louisa, don't go -- not that I Am afraid of being
left alone with Mr. Trifle, but that --


Loui. I must go now, to the person I told you of -- when I come back, I Will
meet you in your room exit Loui.


Jos. And now, sir, I desire to know whether you are Hans William or Trifle?


H. Will. Which do you wish?


Jos. Neither -- Can you speak the truth?


H. Will. Certainly.


Jos. Do it then this moment.


H. Will. I am in love with you.


Jos. Who asked you that?


H. Will. Have you settled, what day will be convenient for our wedding?


Jos. What, then, you are determined to marry me?


H. Will. Positively.


Jos. And have you spoken to my father?


H. Will. Yes.


Jos. And what said he?


H. W. He requested me never to put my foot over his threshold again.


Jos. Indeed! and what induces you to refuse him such a trifling request?


H. Will. I do not -- I mean to take him at his word, only I design to take you
with me.


Jos. Are you quite sure of that?


H. Will. Quite --


Jos. Without letting me know who you are! When a man intends to rob an honest
girl of her name, he should at least provide her with another.


H. Will. Why, I gave you your choice of two.


Jos. Well, then, your name is not Trifle.


H. Will. No more than yours is Louisa Rose.


Jos. Why did you wish to impose on me?


H. Will. I Will tell you. Your father and mine have treated our love a little too
much in a mercantile manner.


Jos. Our love!


H. Will. I did not wish to contradict my father, and as my heart was free, I
neither promised or refused, but I was determined first to take a look at you.
If I had not liked you, I should have been off again in a moment: but -- here I
am still -- and, to own the truth at once -- I do like you.


Jos. You're very flattering.


H. Will. And therefore meaning to be a dutiful son --


(advances toward Jos.) Jos. Hold, hold, not in such haste -- perhaps I may
have a mind first to look at you too.


H. Will. With all my heart -- ( turns round)


Jos. The outside is well enough -- but who will answer for the inside?


H. Will. That you will find out after the wedding.


Jos. A clear bargain, my father says, prevents quarrels -- suppose we agree to
tell our own faults to one another, and then try if we can be friends.


H. Will. With all my heart.


Jos. Well, do you begin.


H. Will. First, I am hotheaded and passionate.


Jos. That may be cured by good temper on my part.


H. Will. I Am careless --


Jos. That will be cured when you have a wife to look after.


H. Will. I am vain.


Jos. That you must only be of me.


H. Will. I shall be vainer than ever, if I win you for my wife.


Jos. Well, that I Will forgive -- proceed.


H. Will. That is all.


Jos. Oh, then you may be endured.


H. Will. I hope so -- and now it is your turn to tell your faults.


Jos. I have none.


H. Will. None at all.


Jos. Girls have no faults before marriage.


H. Will. And after marriage?


Jos. Have none but in the eyes of their husbands.


H. Will. So we have settled our accounts already?


Jos. Hold! hold! there are a few other things to be discussed. Have you no bad
habits?


H. Will. None that I know of.


Jos. How do you pass the day when you are at home?


H. Will. I have a foolish custom of my country -- I like a pipe for an hour or
two --


Jos. I cannot endure it -- you must give up the pipe,


H. Will. I shall find that difficult, perhaps.


Jos. As you please -- I can play with my lap-dog while you are smoking.


H. Will. Your lap-dog!


Jos. I can leave him when you leave your pipe.


H. Will. I give up the pipe --


Jos. I give up the lap-dog; well, proceed with the day.


H. Will I love to dine at two.


Jos. I hate to dine 'till four.


H. Will. For your sake I can dine an hour later.


Jos. To oblige you, I would dine an hour earlier.


H. Will. Then at three --


Jos. Agreed.


H. Will. After dinner I take a nap.


Jos, And I take an airing.


H. Will. Without me?


Jos. I cannot take your bed in my carriage.


H. Will. But suppose I don't sleep --


Jos. Then I don't go out.


H. Will. In the evening I go to the club.


Jos. And I invite company.


H. Will. Whom I don't know!


Jos. I cannot ask your club into my apartment.


H. Will. Then I shall stay at home --


Jos. And I shall have no company but those whom you invite.


H. Will. Well -- so far we proceed cordially -- but I have one bad habit, I
own, not so easy to be got rid of -- you will overlook it, I dare say -- I
cannot help falling in love with every pretty woman I see.


Jos. Oh, that is of no importance at all.


H. W. Indeed! -- well, that is very good natured. nettled


Jos. I cannot be otherwise than good-natured on that head, because I have
exactly the same fault.


H. Will. Eh!


Jos. I cannot help liking every handsome man that comes in my way.


H. Will. What!


Jos. I like to hear men pay me compliments


H. Will Do you?


Jos. Swear solemn vows to me --


H. Will. Do you?


Jos. To be sure -- what is the matter with you? -- You dislike it, do you?


H. Will. Suppose we both leave off this last trick?


Jos. How is that to be managed?


H. Will. Suppose I have no eyes but for you?


Jos. To that I consent.


H. Will. Suppose you have none but for me?


Jos. That will be the consequence of the other.


H Will. Say you so? then give me your hand in earnest.


Jos. Yes -- but you must first obtain my father's leave to step over the
threshold.


H. Will. ( snatches her hand and kisses it) Come along my charming girl, I Will
obtain your father's leave, to do every thing that you bid me, as long as we
live.


Exeunt. SCENE II.
[LEOPOLD' S Apartment, hung round with black; at the back of the stage the
door of a Cabinet, or small inner room, closed, and silk curtains drawn before
it. Furniture suited to the melancholy of the apartment.] Enter LEOPOLD,
musing. An hour has nearly passed, and Louisa will presently be here. For the
first time, since fifteen years have elapsed, the foot of a stranger will tread
this sancturay of my sorrows -- for the first time my heart will open itself to
sympathy, and the tears of another being will be mixed with mine. I feel myself
unaccountably attracted toward that good girl. Hark! she is come.

LOUISA opens the door, and enters timorously. Leop. You are true to your
appointment, Louisa.


Loui. I have counted the minutes ever since I left you. What a dark and dismal
room this is!


Leop. It wears the color of mourning -- In the first hours of grief, the eye
feeds with pleasure on these congenial hues -- but a real and lasting grief
outlives the very sense of these vain distinctions -- In my sight these walls
are now a mere blank -- So also to me is life -- mournful and void.


Loui. You said your life was not always so sad.


Leop. I enjoyed its morning -- but its noon was stormy -- and now, its closing
eve, shade deepening over shade, wraps me bewildered and perplexed, in
cheerless darkness.


Loui. But indeed, indeed, I am sure your evening may be brighter if you choose.


Leop. If I choose; -- Can I command the clouds that lower round my setting sun?


Loui. Yes, I do think you may. Now, pray, listen to me; -- You have been very
good to me -- you have given me your confidence -- you have made me feel as if
I belonged to you -- and now you have done all this -- don't be angry with me,
if I speak what I think.


Leop. Be angry with you, my good girl!


Loui. Yes -- don't be angry with me, if I tell you, that I think you have been
unkind to yourself.


Leop. How so, Louisa?


Loui. By casting one from you, whose love and duty teach her, that her chief
happiness would be to give you comfort.


Leop. I understand you, Louisa. But tell me -- tell me, girl, wherefore you
are so warmly interested in my daughter's fate -- You spoke to me of her before.


Loui. She -- she is my friend.


Leop. Why did you not inform me of this sooner?


Loui. Because I know how earnestly your poor child sighs for her father's love
-- because I could find no reason why you should be so severe toward her --
and because I wanted to observe you first, and learn on what account it was you
hated her.


Leop. Hated her! tell me something of my daughter.


Loui. I can tell you nothing, but of her unhappiness -- of her tears.


Leop. ( affected) Does she feel such love for me?


Loui. Does she love you! -- Oh! -- Since she has been old enough to learn what
happiness means, the wish to be known to you, has been the dearest of her
heart. Her tears have often fallen upon my bosom. She has, many and many a
time, felt bitter anguish, while she sat alone sighing out -- "My father does
not love me!"


Leop. She shall return to me --


Loui. Shall she? -- shall she indeed!


Leop. Yes! Let her come! And when clasping her in my arms, joy, shall
overpower my senses, and tears shall be my only utterance, then -- then she
shall be assured that I love her.


Loui. (trembling, and grasping Leopold's hand) I -- I hope I may believe you.


Leop. You have a right to doubt; but do not condemn me, girl, if I have
appeared cold and unconcerned for one, whose welfare is so dear to me -- such,
as, for these few months past, you have seen me -- such have I been for
seventeen years; during that period, I have sometimes lived for men, but no one
has lived for me. You, my good girl, are the first who have rekindled in my
heart the desire to see my daughter.


Loui. Then blessed be the moment in which I entered this house!


Leop. I bless it. -- Hear me, Louisa, censure me, but pity and excuse me. I
was once rich, for I possessed in a virtuous wife, the only true riches in this
world, Content and Cheerfulness. When the Creator finished his glorious work of
nature, he added its last bright ornament, Woman! I loved one alone, among all
beings: -- I had chosen her from a world, and from a world I would still choose
her. The years of our first love fell swiftly into that eternity where she now
resides. The birth of a daughter was the dearest and last moment of my
happiness. Scarcely had she beheld the light* when her mother died -- ( Louisa
appears affected) her infant cries were the dirge of all my joys on earth.


Loui. Poor innocent!


Leop. While yet Emilia's grave was fresh, I clasped her infant to my bosom,
and flying from the world, resolved to live for my child alone -- She was the
only treasure left to me on earth.


Loui. And why did you forsake that child?


Leop. Mark me -- As I conveyed my little one to the fostering refuge I had
provided for her, methought her mother's spirit beamed in her features -- Oh!
what did that look effect! The keen remembrance of my loss, pierced anew into
my soul -- I dreaded to turn again toward my child -- her existence had
destroyed what was dearer to me than my own -- I entrusted her with those, of
whose kind hearts I was well assured -- Business called me away -- concerns of
my wife's fortune -- (after a pause, he shudders) I have never returned to my
child.


Loui. Had she deserved this?


Leop. Day after day, year after year, have I ardently sighed to meet my child
again. But she is well and happy -- and what could my presence bestow? The
sight of my affliction -- of my misery -- I strove to rouse me from despair --
I turned from the grave, which had devoured my hopes, and sought for
consolation among men -- I told them my sorrows, and met derision -- until at
last I shut my bosom against the world, and fled, where only I could escape
torment -- to solitude.


Loui. Ah! I Am afraid you found little comfort there.


Leop. Such as you see me now possess. But here has fancy furnished me with
ample food for sadness -- here have I framed a sacred record of my beloved
Emilia -- here I gathered every remembered object, that had been dear to her --
yes -- here her spirit dwells; here often in my thoughts has communed with me
-- Else, how could I have endured so much? [ During these last lines, LEOPOLD
takes LOUISA' s hand with great emotion, and leads her toward the door of the
cabinet -- stops suddenly.) Will thou not tremble, girl? Yet, it is imagination
fills the scene -- all is but show -- the mockery of my heart's pangs. --


(Opens the folding doors of the cabinet, and discovers, within, an emblematic
transparency, in which is the name of EMILIA, written in large characters.)
Loui. ( nearly fainting, falls on the ground) My mother!


Leop. What do you mean? -- who art thou Louisa?


Loui. Your daughter. (Leopold, trembling, raises her) Forgive me, my dear
father, but --


Leop. Art thou indeed my daughter?


Loui. Oh! does not your heart tell you so?


throws herself into his arms. Leop. Oh, yes -- thou art -- thou art my child.


Loui. My letters could not move you -- I wished still to try if I could gain
your love -- Josephine assisted me -- I passed here for the daughter of --


Leop. I comprehend it all -- How could I so long deny myself this comfort!
(embraces her) Support me, my child -- lead me nearer -- that, in the presence
of my mother's spirit, I may bless thee --


(A noise heard without. Leopold starts, and shuts the cabinet. Adelbert enters
hastily.) Adel. Pardon, generous man -- pardon this intrusion -- I must have
leave to speak -- you have given me so singular a proof of your benevolence.


Leop. You surprise me -- I, Sir?


Adel. Was it not by your order that this note was conveyed into my room?


Leop. No, not by mine, -- ( looks at LOUISA, who casts down her eyes) but I
guess by whom it was bestowed. That glowing cheek, that down-cast look disclose
the truth -- the person, to whom you are indebted, stands before you --


Adel. Louisa! --


Leop. Give me the note -- Come, my children, let us hasten to meet my brother
-- he has long borne with my discontent -- he shall be the first witness of my
returning joy. Exeunt.


SCENE III. The Hall.
Enter TOTUM, in a great bustle, and NICOLAS. Tot. Well, Nicolas -- are the
constables posted?


Nic. They are ready, down at the door --


Tot. Down at the door -- right. Let no one take his head out of the house; if
I call, be ready, at a moment's notice -- away -- no blunders -- good Nicolas.


Exeunt TOTUM and NICOLAS on opposite sides. Enter VON SNARL, JOSEPHINE, and
HANS WILLIAM. V. Sn. Fine doings, indeed! Did not I tell you never to come into
my house again?


H. Will. And did not I tell you that I would come into it again? This is the
letter from my father --


V. Sn. Psha! I suppose it is all about the red nose and the peaches.


H. Will. Read it.


V. Sn. What should I read it for? I have told you already to get out of my
house.


H. Will. I Will, go, as soon as you have read the letter.


V. Sn. Well, you shall not spoil the sweetness of my temper. I have read many
useless letters in my life before this: ( opens the letter and reads) "The
bearer of this, my lawful son and heir, Hans William, ( surprised) whom I send
in good condition" --


H. Will. Yes, I Am in pretty good case --


V. Sn. "By this day's mail" -- hem -- "Vander Housen and Co." -- the devil!
you have taken me in, (forces a laugh) ha -- ha -- I thought you had too honest
a face for a cheat. Did not I tell you, Josephine, he was of prime quality --
but Hans must not come near you -- ( to H. W.) give me your hand -- you are a
rogue and a wit; but if you had not been a rich rogue, like myself --


Jos. ( to H. WILL.) You would be a rogue and a thief --


H. Will. And must never more have put my foot over the threshold --


V. Sn. Well, well, why do you put me in mind of that? If I had not the sweetest
temper --


Enter LEOPOLD. Leop. Brother, give me joy -- Louisa Rose shall be married
today, as you said.


V. Sn. Oh, she consents at last to take eighty thousand marks, does she?


Leop. She shall give her hand, as it should always be given, where the heart
guides it.


V. Sn. And why did she plague me this morning with all that nonsense? -- Only
to put me in a passion!


Enter TOTUM and Mrs. ROSE. Tot. Now, Sir, the constables are at the door -- he
cannot have negociated the bill already -- Oh, yonder he comes -- now, Sir --


Leop. ( looks toward the side scene) Adelbert! a bill! what is all this?


V. Sn. Why, what should it be? Totum has a charge against my lodger for a
note, purporting to be drawn by you, for three hundred crowns.


H. Will. Against my friend!


V. Sn. Your friend! Do you know any thing more of him?


H. Will. Yes, I know him for one who thinks every stranger entitled to his
regard, and who will rather risk his life, than suffer an honest man to become
the dupe of a knave. Perhaps I may find ( looks at TOTUM with scorn) an
opportunity of doing as much for him.


Leop. Here is the note, written by myself -- you found it in the hands of a
man of integrity, and, as a proof of my esteem for him, I mean to make him heir
to my whole fortune.


V. Sn. You do! -- and pray what becomes of your daughter?


Enter ADELBERT and LOUISA. Leop. Behold her. (VON SNARL and TOTUM express
surprise.) In the fond and artless affections of her mind, while I recognized
the image of her whom I adored, I read likewise, in forcible characters, my own
duty -- yes -- this is my daughter, and, if I guess the heart aright -- this is
my son.


Adel. An outcast!


Leop. You have found an asylum here. Accept her, Adelbert: with my whole heart
I give her to you.


Mrs. R. Oh, what a fine sermon my poor dear Dr. Olearius would have made on
this occasion!


V. Sn. So! I shall give Louisa a wedding-dinner, as I said -- I Am right this
time, in spite of you all.


Tot. And if this be the case, I may as well make the constables void. -- Hymen
has protested my draught: and, for fear the Pole should make a scratch in my
ledger, I will not leave him a single side for a memorandum sheet. -- Hang Hymen!
-- Plague light on the Pole!


Exit TOTUM. Leop. The indulgence of a gloomy temper has stolen from my life
its sweetest hours, and drawn sighs from the bosom of innocence -- my child,
forgive me! -- Amid tears of anguish and despair you were baptized. -- Amid
those of repentance and joy, receive a father's blessing! -- "Convinced of my
error, I will now return with cheerfulness to the world, and bear, without
repining, the lot which heaven has assigned me. -- The present emotions of my
heart instruct me, that there is no cordial for a parent's sorrows beyond the
virtuous affection of A DAUGHTER."


FINIS.
