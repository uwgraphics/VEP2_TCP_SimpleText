May it please Your Excellency,
WE His Majesty's most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects the Representatives of this
His Majesty's Province, cannot omit a most grateful Acknowledgment of Your
Lordships favor declared in Your Speech to this Assembly, wherein Your
Lordship has been pleased to Express so great a kindness toward us, so deep a
Sense of our late Sufferings, and present condition, and so tender a Regard to
our future welfare: That our hearts are filled with an entire Joy and
Satisfaction; for that also we now see Your Lordships Presence has already
Dispersed those dark Clouds of late Impending, Portendous of our Ruin and
Destruction, and given us a fair prospect of a Serene and Happy Day.

As to the several Paragraphs in Your Lordships Speech, they are now under
Consideration, and we shall follow Your Lordships direction therein, Resolving
in all things according to our best understanding, to behave our selves as
becomes His Majesty's most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, and Your Lordships most
Faithful and Obedient Servants.

Signed by Order and in behalf of the Representatives, Samuel Penhallow,
