AT A COUNCIL held at BOSTON the 25th. of June, 1675.
T He Governor and Magistrates being assembled in Council to consider of the
public affairs of this Commonweal, and being sensible of many humbling
Providence of the Lord, wherein do appear no small Tokens of his frowns
toward us, whom he has so signally owned for many years, to the just
admiration of Strangers, as well as of our selves, and that now by our
unsuitable walkings, and unanswerable returns, we should provoke him to
threaten us with loosening the bridle of the Heathen that are neighboring to
us. Which in conjunction with many other afflicting Dispensations of divine
Providence, does minister just ground to fear least the anger of God be kindled
against us,

Do commend to all the People of this Jurisdiction as their indubitable duty,
seriously to consider thereof, and to judge our selves for all those many sins
and evils that do abound among us, to the dishonor of God, and our Profession
of his great Name, and to implore his Compassions to be toward us, freely
pardoning all our Sins and Transgressions, and that he would give us Repentance
for the same, and turn his People again unto himself, to seek the Lord God of
our Fathers with all our hearts and that his favorable presence may be with
us, blessing this present Expedition for rebuking the rage of the Heathen,
lengthening out our Peace, and blessing the fruits of the Earth, that we may
yet further experience his goodness toward us, And for that end do nominate
and appoint the 29th. day of this Instant June to be kept as a day of
Humiliation and Prayer; and do order that all the Ministers and People of this
Jurisdiction respectively attend and keep the same; and where there shall be
any failure for want of seasonable notice, that the 8th day of the next Month
be by them kept as a day of Humiliation and Prayer, unless the Providence of
God shall otherwise eminently divert, and give us just cause to turn the same
into a day of Praise and Thanksgiving.

By the Council, Edward Rawson Secret.
