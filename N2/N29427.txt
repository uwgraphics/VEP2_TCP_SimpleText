At A GENERAL COURT Held at Boston, March the eleventh 1673/4.
WHereas it pleases GOD still to Exercise his people here and elsewhere, with
many and various Difficulties and Trialls: Particularly, the breaking forth of
Notorious and scandolous Sins among us, The straitning of several persons with
respect to the scarcity of Grain and other provision, Divisions in some
Societies, Danger of War threatening us, The condition of our Dear native
Country and the people of God there and else where in Europe, respecting the
Wars and other Troubles:

These and other considerations has moved this Court, Who do hereby Order and
Appoint That the Twenty Sixth day of this instant March, be set apart and kept
as a day of Humiliation and Prayer, to seek the Lord in these things, and for a
blessing upon the Country, and the Labors of the People the year ensuing. And
do Commend it to all the Churches, Pastors, Teachers, Ministers and People
within this Jurisdiction, solemnly and seriously to keep the same accordingly.

Edward Rawson
