THE PROSPECT OF PEACE.
THE closing scenes of Tyrants' fruitless rage,
The opening prospects of a golden age,
The dread events that crown the important year,
Wake the glad song, and claim the attentive ear.
Long has Columbia rung with dire alarms,
While Freedom called her injured sons to arms;
While various fortune fired the embattled field,
Conquest delayed, and victory stood concealed;
While closing legions marked their dreadful way,
And Millions trembled for the dubious day.
In this grand conflict heaven's Eternal Sire,
At whose dread frown the sons of guilt expire,
Bade vengeance rise, with sacred fury driven,
On those who war with Innocence and Heaven.
Behold, where late the trembling squadrons fled,
Hosts bowed in chains, and hapless numbers bled,
In different fields our numerous heroes rouse,
To crop the wreath from Britain's impious brows*
Age following age shall these events relate
'Till Time's old empire yield to destined Fate;
Historic truth our guardian chiefs proclaim,
Their worth* their actions, and their deathless fame;
Admiring crowds their life-touch'd forms behold
In breathing canvass, or in sculptured gold,
And hail the Leader of the favorite throng,
The rapturous theme of some heroic song.
And soon, emerging from the orient skies,
The blisful morn in glorious pomp shall rise,
Wafting fair Peace from Europe's fated coast;
Where wandering long, in mazy factions lost,
From realm to realm, by rage and discord driven,
She seemed resolved to reascend her heaven.
This LEWIS viewed, and reached a friendly hand,
Pointing her flight to this far-distant land;
Bade her extend her empire over the West,
And Europe's balance tremble on her crest!
Now, see the Goddess mounting on the day,
To these fair climes direct her circling way,
Willing to seek, once more, an earthly throne,
To cheer the globe, and emulate the sun.
With placid look she eyes the blissful shore,
Bids the loud-thundering cannon cease to roar;
Bids British navies from these ports be tossed,
And hostile keels no more insult the coast;
Bids private feuds her sacred vengeance feel,
And bow submissive to the public weal;
Bids long, calm years adorn the happy clime,
And roll down blessings to remotest time.
Hail! heaven-born Peace, fair Nurse of Virtue hail!
Here, fix thy scepter and exalt thy scale;
Hence, through the earth extend thy late domain,
'Till Heaven's own splendour shall absorb thy reign!
What scenes arise! what glories we behold!
See a broad realm its various charms unfold;
See crowds of patriots bless the happy land,
A godlike senate and a warlike band;
One friendly Genius fires the numerous whole,
From glowing Georgia to the frozen pole.
Along these shores, amid these flowery vales,
The woodland shout the joyous ear assails;
Industrious crowds in different labors toil,
Those ply the arts, and these improve the soil.
Here the fond merchant counts his rising gain,
There strides the rustic over the furrowed plain,
Here walks the statesman, pensive and serene,
And there the school boys gambol round the green.
See ripening harvests gild the smiling plains,
Kind Nature's bounty and the pride of swains;
Luxuriant vines their curling tendrils shoot,
And bow their heads to drop the clustering fruit;
In the gay fields, with rich profusion strow'd,
The orchard bends beneath its yellow load,
The lofty boughs their annual burden pour,
And juicy harvests swell the autumnal store.
These are the blessings of impartial Heaven,
To each fond heart in just proportion given.
No grasping lord shall grind the neighboring poor,
Starve numerous vassals to increase his store;
No cringing slave shall at his presence bend,
Shrink at his frown, and at his nod attend;
Afric's unhappy children, now no more
Shall feel the cruel chains they felt before,
But every State in this just mean agree,
To bless mankind, and set the oppressed free.
Then, rapt in transport, each exulting slave
Shall taste that Boon which God and nature gave,
And, fired with virtue, join the common cause,
Protect our freedom and enjoy our laws.
At this calm period, see, in pleasing view,
Art vies with Art, and Nature smiles anew:
On the long, winding strand that meets the tide,
Unnumber'd cities lift their spiry pride;
Gay, flowery walks salute the inraptur'd eyes,
Tall, beauteous domes in dazzling prospect rise;
There thronging navies stretch their wanton sails,
Tempt the broad main and catch the driving gales;
There commerce swells from each remotest shore,
And wafts in plenty to the smiling store,
To these thronged seats the country wide resorts,
And rolls her treasures to the opening ports;
While, far remote, gay health and pleasure flow,
And calm retirement cheers the laboring brow.
No din of arms the peaceful patriot hears,
No parting sigh the tender matron fears,
No field of fame invites the youth to rove,
Nor virgins know a harsher sound than love.
Fair Science then her laureled beauty rears,
And soars with Genius to the radiant stars.
Her glimmering dawn from Gothic darkness rose,
And nations saw her shadowy veil disclose;
She cheered fair Europe with her rising smiles,
Beamed a bright morning over the British isles,
Now soaring reaches her meridian height,
And blessed Columbia hails the dazzling light!
Here, rapt in though it, the philosophic soul
Shall look through Nature's parts and grasp the whole.
See Genius kindling at a FRANKLIN'S fame,
See unborn sages catch the electric flame,
Bid hovering clouds the threatening blast expire,
Curb the fierce stream and hold the imprisoned fire!
See the pleased youth, with anxious study, rove,
In orbs excentric through the realms above,
No more perplexed, while RITTENHOUSE appears
To grace the museum with the rolling spheres.
See that young Genius, that inventive soul,
Whose laws the jarring elements control;
Who guides the vengeance of mechanic power,
To blast the watery world and guard the peaceful shore.
And where is the rising Sage, the unknown name,
That new advent'rer in the lists of fame,
To find the cause, in secret nature bound,
The unknown cause, and various charms of sound?
What subtle medium leads the devious way;
Why different tensions different sounds convey;
Why harsh, rough tones in grating discord roll,
Or mingling concert charms the enraptured soul.
And tell the cause why sluggish vapors rise,
And wave, exalted, through the genial skies;
What strange contrivance nature forms to bear
The ponderous burden through the lighter air.
These last Displays the curious mind engage,
And fire the genius of the rising age;
While moral tho'ts the pleased attention claim,
Swell the warm soul, and wake the virtuous flame;
While Metaphysics soar a boundless height,
And launch with EDWARDS to the realms of light.
See the blessed Muses hail their roseate bowers,
Their mansions blooming with poetic flowers;
See listening Seraphs join the epic throng,
And unborn JOSHUAS rise in future song.
Satire attends at Virtue's wakening call,
And Pride and Coquetry and Dullness fall.
Unnumber'd bards shall string the heavenly lyre,
To those blessed strains which heavenly themes inspire;
Sing the rich Grace on mortal Man bestowed,
The Virgin's Offspring and the filial God;
What love descends from heaven when JESUS dies!
What shouts attend him rising through the skies!
See Science now in lovelier charms appear,
Graced with new garlands from the blooming Fair.
See laureled nymphs in polished pages shine,
And Sapphic sweetness glow in every line.
No more the rougher Muse shall dare disgrace
The radiant charms that deck the blushing face;
But rising Beauties scorn the tinsel show,
The powdered coxcomb and the flaunting beau;
While humble Merit, void of flattering wiles,
Claims the soft glance, and wakes th'enlivening smiles.
The opening luster of an angel-mind,
Beauty's bright charms with sense superior joined,
Bid Virtue shine, bid Truth and Goodness rise,
Melt from the voice, and sparkle from the eyes;
While the pleased Muse the gentle bosom warms,
The first in genius, as the first in charms.
Thus age and youth a smiling aspect wear,
Awed into virtue by the leading Fair;
While the bright offspring, rising to the stage,
Conveys the blessings to the future age.
THESE are the views that Freedom's cause attend;
THESE shall endure 'till Time and Nature end.
With Science crowned, shall Peace and Virtue shine,
And blessed Religion beam a light divine.
Here the pure Church, descending from her God*
Shall fix on earth her long and last abode;
Zion arise, in radiant splendors dressed,
By Saints admired, by Infidels confessed;
Her opening courts, in dazzling glory, blaze,
Her walls salvation, and her portals praise.
From each far corner of the extended earth,
Her gathering sons shall claim their promised birth.
Through the drear wastes, beneath the setting day,
Where prowling natives haunt the wood for prey,
The swarthy Millions lift their wondering eyes,
And smile to see the Gospel morning rise:
Those who, through time, in savage darkness lay,
Wake to new light, and hail the glorious day!
In those dark regions, those uncultur'd wilds,
Fresh blooms the rose, the peaceful lilly smiles.
On the tall cliffs unnumber'd Carmels rise,
And in each vale some beauteous Sharon lies.
From this fair Mouth th'excinded stone shall roll,
Reach the far East and spread from pole to pole;
From one small Stock shall countless nations rise,
The world replenish and adorn the skies.
Earth's blood-stained empires, with their Guide the Sun,
From orient climes their gradual progress run;
And circling far, reach every western shore,
'Till earth-born empires rise and fall no more.
But see the imperial GUIDE from heaven descend,
Whose beams are Peace, whose kingdom knows no end;
From calm Vesperia, through the etherial way,
Back sweep the shades before the effulgent day;
Through the broad East, the brightening splendour driven,
Reverses Nature and illumins heaven;
Astonished regions bless the gladdening sight,
And Suns and Systems own superior light.
As when the asterial blaze over Bethl'em stood,
Which marked the birthplace of the incarnate God;
When eastern priests the heavenly splendour viewed,
And numerous crowds the wondrous sign pursued:
So eastern kings shall view the unclouded day
Rise in the West and streak its golden way:
That signal spoke a Savior's humble birth,
This speaks his long and glorious reign on earth!
THEN Love shall rule, and Innocence adore,
Discord shall cease, and Tyrants be no more;
'Till you bright orb, and those celestial spheres,
In radiant circles, mark a thousand years;
'Till the grand fiat burst the etherial frames,
Worlds crush on worlds, and Nature sink in flames!
The Church elect, from smouldering ruins, rise,
And sail triumphant through the yielding skies,
Hailed by the Bridegroom! to the Father given,
The Joy of Angels, and the Queen of Heaven!
