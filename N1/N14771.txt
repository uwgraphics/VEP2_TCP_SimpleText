To the CHURCH and CONGREGATION assembling in Brattle-Street, the following
ELEGY, Sacred to the MEMORY of their late Reverend and Worthy PASTOR, DR.

PHILLIS PETER'S.
Boston, Jan. 1784
An ELEGY, etc.
O THOU whose exit wraps in boundless woe,
For Thee the tears of various Nations flow:
For Thee the floods of virtuous sorrows rise
From the full heart and burst from streaming eyes,
Far from our view to Heaven's eternal height,
The Seat of bliss divine, and glory bright;
Far from the restless turbulence of life,
The war of factions, and impassioned strife.
From every ill mortality endured,
Safe in celestial Salem's walls secured.
EVER yet from this terrestrial state retired,
The Virtuous loved Thee, and the Wife admired.
The gay approved Thee, and the grave revered;
And all thy words with rapt attention heard!
The Sons of Learning on thy lessons hung,
While soft persuasion moved the illit'rate throng.
Who, drawn a by rhetoric's commanding laws,
Complied obedient, nor conceived the cause,
Thy every sentence was with grace inspired,
And every period with devotion fired;
Bright Truth thy guide without a dark disguise,
And penetration's all-discerning-eyes.
THY COUNTRY mourns the afflicting Hand divine
That now forbids thy radiant lamp to shine,
Which, like the sun, resplendent source of light
Diffused its beams, and cheered our gloom of night.
WHAT deep-felt sorrow in each Kindred breast
With keen sensation rends the heart distressed!
Fraternal love sustains a tenderer part,
And mourns a BROTHER with a BROTHER'S heart.
THY CHURCH laments her faithful PASTOR fled
To the cold mansions of the silent dead.
There hushed forever, cease the heavenly strain,
That waked the soul, but here resounds in vain.
Still live thy merits, where thy name is known,
As the sweet Rose, its blooming beauty gone
Retains its fragrance with a long perfume:
Thus COOPER! thus thy death-less name shall bloom
Unfading, in thy Church and Country's love,
While Winter frowns, or spring renews the grove.
The hapless Muse, her loss in COOPER mourns,
And as she fits, she writes, and weeps, by turns;
A Friend sincere, whose mild indulgent grace
Encouraged often, and often approved her lays.
WITH all their charms, terrestrial objects. strove,
But vain their pleasures to attract his love.
Such COOPER was -- at Heaven's high call he flies;
His task well finished, to his native skies.
Yet to his fate reluctant we resign,
Though our's to copy conduct such as thine:
Such was thy wish, the observant Muse surveyed
Thy latest breath. and this advice conveyed.
