THE CRISIS. NUMBER II.
A Bloody Court, A Bloody Ministry, AND A Bloody Parliament.
THE sudden and unexpected dissolution of the last ruinous Parliament gave a
just and general alarm to the whole nation; and we may search in vain the
voluminous pages of Grecian, Roman, or English history, to find such another
plan of premeditated villainy for destroying, at one grand stroke of royal and
ministerial policy, all the rights of a free people. Lord North, engendered in
the womb of hell, raised by the fostering hand of infernal spirits, and
possessing principles that have eclipsed all the glories of his satanic
parents, had the effrontery to declare, in the face of the House of Commons and
the world, but a few days before the recess of the late Parliament, that they
should meet again early in October for the despatch of business. When he
uttered this falsehood, it was suspected by many, and he well knew it had been
determined, that they should be dissolved, although the precise time was not
fixed. On the 16th day of September, 1774, a notice was published in the
Gazette for the last Parliament to meet on the 15th of November; eleven days
had not elapsed before a proclamation appeared for its dissolution, and the
calling a new Parliament. Who can guard against deception, artifice and
villainy, when stamped with royal authority? The very thought of an honest House
of Commons struck terror into the guilty soul of Lord North, the diabolical
minion of royal favor, and instrument of royal vengeance; nay, even the King
(virtuous as he is) had his fears; and in order to secure their own creatures
and dependents, or, in other words, to have the old Parliament new revived, and
smuggle a majority of venal abandoned miscreants (who would deny their God, or
sell their souls for money) into the present House of Commons, lord North sent
letters to all his friends that they might be prepared, and it was known in the
most distant parts of England, and even the time of the election fixed in
several boroughs in Cornwall some days before the Parliament was dissolved.
This is a truth which Lord North, with all his consummate impudence, cannot
deny.

The ministerial hacks were immediately set to work to fabricate lies (and
publish them in the news papers) to delude and deceive the electors; that
little or no opposition might be made to the tools of government. One report
said the dissolution of Parliament was owing to some disagreeable advices from
America, and that our virtuous King, with his still more virtuous ministers,
intended to adopt some conciliating measures with respect to the colonies, and
that it would betray a weakness in the King to let the same Parliament meet
again, to repeal those acts which they had but a few months before passed.
Another report, equally true, asserted it was on account of intelligence
received from the north of a very alarming nature; and a third, that it was
occasioned by a difference between the French and English ministry, which
rendered such a step necessary, as there was great reason to believe we should
soon be involved in a war, and that it would be exceedingly improper to have
the nation put in a ferment, by a general election, at so critical a time as
that, and when the assistance of Parliament would be particularly wanted. A
fourth report was, that Lord Chatham and his friends would be immediately taken
into favor, and that there was to be an entire change in the ministry. By
these low artifices and ministerial lies, the people of England were lulled
into a state of supineness, and even made to lend a helping hand to complete
their own ruin.

The subsequent part of this paper shall unravel the diabolical scheme. Lord
North saw a powerful opposition forming in every part of England; he was
fearful of associations; he dreaded a solemn league and covenant, which he was
certain the people would have entered into for the preservation of their rights
and liberties before next May, the time when the Parliament would have been
dissolved of course; he trembled for the event; conscious of his own villainy,
and that his head had been long forfeited to the justice of his country, he
determined to take the electors by surprise, to put them off their guard, and
rob them of time; that no opposition might be made to his creatures, and the
people be prevented from fixing upon men of honest independent principles, to
whom they might with safety delegate the important, the sacred trust of
representation.

Lord North communicated his fears to the King, painted the daring rebellious
spirit of the Americans, and told him, that the people here were as disloyal
and disaffected, and that hints had been thrown out in the public prints, of
plans forming in different parts of England, for keeping out of the new
Parliament most of his friends; and unless prevented, by some well concerted
scheme, there was but too much reason to believe, from the spirit of the
people, that they would succeed; an event, says this traitor, much feared and
greatly dreaded by every well wisher to your person and government: Should it
ever take place, as there is a country party, or a majority of mock patriots in
the House of Commons, who are enemies to all order and government, you must be
reduced to a most degrading situation indeed; your present friends will then be
unable to give you any assistance; and instead of the power being in your
hands, it will then be in the hands of the people; and you will be under the
disgraceful necessity of giving your assent to the repeal of every act which
has been lately passed for the purpose of raising a revenue, and enforcing a
due obedience to your authority: In short, you will be a King without power,
and subject to the control of a few demagogues for liberty, the dregs of
mankind, and a common rabble, who will always support them; nay, it may even
endanger the security of your throne, for what will not a hot headed Parliament
do, with whom the voice of the people can have any weight? The plan for
reducing the Americans, and making them dependent on your will, must be
crushed; they will triumph in the victory obtained over the just power of
Parliament and your prerogative; your faithful servants will be compelled to
leave you, and you will be without a real friend to advise with. If your
Majesty can get a majority of your friends rechosen in the new Parliament, you
will be able to raise what money you please with their assistance; you will
then be able to keep your present Ministers, and preserve them from the
resentment (which has been incurred by serving of you) of an enraged rabble,
who are made to believe, through the licentiousness of the press, that they
labor under a load of accumulated grievances; you will then be able to trample
under foot, faction, sedition, and rebellion throughout your dominions, and to
carry every thing before you, agreeable to your royal pleasure; with the power
of Parliament, and your Majesty's firmness and perseverance, you may bring
England and America into a proper state of subjection to your will. To
accomplish this it will be necessary to prorogue the Parliament to some future
day, then to meet, and immediately after call a council and dissolve them; in
the mean time your friends may be made acquainted with this determination, and
be prepared for the election before any opposition can possibly be made, or the
people know any thing of the matter.

The King, firmly resolved on the people's ruin, caressed his villainous minion,
admired the plan formed for our destruction; and, drunk with prerogative,
sucked in the baneful advice and pursued it.

Thus the present Parliament was smuggled, and thus, in a most shameful,
unprecedented, artful, and sudden manner, was the last House of Commons
dissolved by the King, to answer his own and his minister's wicked, tyrannical,
and bloody designs against the people and constitution of this kingdom. Such an
instance, of an infamous exertion of the royal prerogative, and under the like
circumstances, is not to be found in the history of England; such an injury and
insult was never before offered to a free people, and never ought to be
forgiven. It was a piece of Hanoverian treachery, baseness, and ingratitude,
which has far exceeded all the artful villainy and low cunning of the discarded
Stuarts. His Majesty (heaven protect so much goodness) out of a tenderness to
the constitution, could not make so bad a use of his prerogative, five years
back, as to dissolve the same Parliament, when their iniquitous proceedings,
and their violations of justice, had roused the indignation of the people, and
he was requested to do it by upwards of eighty thousand freeholders (signed)
and the general voice of the whole nation; but in 1774 he got the better of
that tenderness, and, to answer his own purposes, could exert the royal
prerogative (which he had absolutely refused to his subjects, in the haughty
terms of a despot) with no other view, but to overturn the constitution of the
British empire in England and America, and destroy or enslave the people.

His Majesty, his minions, and instruments of slaughter, are now safe in
robbing the people of their property, by shameful and iniquitous taxes in time
of peace; safe in their subversion of the Protestant religion; safe and
successful in their cruel plan for starving the honest and industrious
inhabitants, and destroying the trade of the town of Boston in America, and the
commerce of England; safe so far in their attempt to destroy the lives, rights,
liberties, and privileges of millions; I say they are safe, in all these
violations of, and depredations on, our national security, and natural rights,
because we are tame.

These mighty crimes will sure, ere long, provoke
The arm of Britain to some noble stroke.
No wonder if such deeds should soon compel
America and England to rebel;
Then George may boast, that he, by art and hire,
Great Nero like, has set the world on fire;
Might boast that thousands by his power fell,
And that he could even Nero far excel;
Bute shall rejoice, and instantly restore
The Stuart race in all their cursed power;
Shall seize upon the throne he should defend,
And traitor prove when George most wants a friend.
This may not be; but should he still oppress
His injured subjects, sure they will seek redress,
When, by oppression, driven to despair,
If he don't love them, they may make him fear;
And though, by shameful taxes, he has seized
Their treasure, and their very vitals squeezed,
Yet he should know, that swords and arms remain,
When called by wrongs, are seldom used in vain;
And freedom's sons, with liberty inspired,
With mighty rage and indignation fired,
'Ggainst England's mortal foes no longer yield
To lawless power armed with virtue's shield;
Their cause most just, nay Heaven's sacred cause,
The cause of truth and violated laws,
Will draw the avenging sword, O glorious deed!
Their laws to save, and make those traitors bleed;
Aided by Heaven all danger will defy,
And nobly conquer, or like Britons die;
Then, blessing freedom with their parting breath,
Will bravely fall into the arms of death
A glorious death, much better in the grave,
A freeman buried than a living slave.
'Twas first decreed, by that great power above.
All should be free, and Heaven gave in love
That blessing to mankind, a sacred trust,
He who'd resign it, is to God unjust.
