IN CONGRESS.

the Crew, be Exported from any of the United States after the fifth day of
January next, until the first day of November next, or until Congress shall
make further order therein -- And it is earnestly recommended to the Executive
Powers of the several United States to see that this Resolution be strictly
complied with.

By Order of Congress, JOHN HANCOCK, President
