ODE FOR THE 23D OF OCTOBER, 1792.
1
WHEN formed by GOD's creating Hand,
This beauteous fabric first appeared;
Eternal Wisdom gave command,
All Nature with attention heard.
2
"Here, Ocean, roll thy swelling tide;
"Here spread thy vast Atlantic main;
"From European eyes to hide
"That Western World, which bounds thy reign."
3
Whilst Ocean kept his sacred charge,
And fair Columbia lay concealed;
Through Europe, Discord roam'd at large,
Till War had crimsoned every field.
4
Black Superstition's dismal night
Extinguished Reason's golden ray;
And Science, driven from the light,
Beneath monastic rubbish lay.
5
The Crown and Mitre, close allied,
Trampled whole nations to the dust;
Whilst FREEDOM, wandering far and wide,
With pure RELIGION, both were lost.
6
Then, guided by the Almighty Hand,
COLUMBUS spread his daring sail;
Ocean received a new command,
And Zephyrs breathed a gentle gale.
7
The Western World appeared to view,
Her friendly arms extended wide;
Then FREEDOM over the Atlantic flew,
With pure RELIGION by her side.
8
Tyrants with mortal hate pursued;
In vain their forces they employ;
In vain the Serpent pours his flood,
Those heaven-born Exiles to destroy.
9
"No weapon formed against my flock
"Shall prosper," says the Almighty Lord;
"Their proudest threatenings thou shall mock,
"For I will be thy shield and sword.
10
"Sweet peace and heavenly truth shall shine
"On fair Columbia's happy ground;
"There FREEDOM and RELIGION join,
"And spread their influence all around."
CHORUS.
11
Hail! GREAT COLUMBIA! favored soil;
Thy fields with plenty crown thy toil;
Thy shore, the seat of growing wealth;
Thy clime the source of balmy health.
12
From thee proceeds the virtuous plan,
To vindicate the Rights of Man.
Thy fame shall spread from pole to pole,
Whilst everlasting ages roll.
