A POEM, etc.
ONCE more Bellona, forced upon the stage,
Inspires new fury, and awakes her rage,
From North to South her thun'dring trumpet spreads
Tumults, and war and death, and daring deeds,
What breast but kindles at the martial sound?
What heart but bleeds to feel it is country's wound?
For thee, blessed freedom, to protect thy sway,
We rush undaunted to the bloody fray,
For thee, each province arms its vigorous host,
Content to die, ever freedom shall be lost.
Kind watchful power, on whose supreme command
The fate of monarchs, empires, worlds depend,
Grant, in a cause thy wisdom must approve,
Undaunted valor kindled from above,
Let not our souls descend to dastard fear,
Be valor, prudence both united here,
Now as of old thy mighty arm display,
Relieve the oppressed, and saving power convey,
It Is done, and see th'omnipotent befriends,
The sword of Gideon, and of God descends.
Ah, see with grief fair Massuchusetts plains,
The seat of war, and death's terrific scenes,
Where darling peace with smiling aspect stood,
Lo! the grim Soldier stalks in quest of blood:
What madness heaven, has made Britannia frown?
Who plans our schemes to pull Columbia Columbia, America sometimes so called,
from Columbus the first discover.
down,
See Boston groan beneath the strong blockade,
Her freedom vanished, and destroyed her trade,
Injured, oppressed, no tyrant could exceed,
The cruel vengeance of so base a deed.
New Albion's sons New Albion, properly New England, but is often applied to
all British America.
whom honest freedom moves
(My heart admires them, and my verse approves)
Tired of oppression in a Stuart's reign,
A Popish faction, ministerial train;
Bravely resolved to leave their native shore
And some new world they knew not where explore,
Far in the West, beyond where Poets said,
The Sun retired, and Cynthia went to bed,
Few then had seen the scarce discovered Bourne,
From whence like death yet fewer did return:
Dire truths from thence the wandering sailor brought
Enlarged by terror, and the poer of thought,
With all the forms that pict'ring fancy gives,
With all the dread that in idea lives,
Fierce Cannibals that sought the blood of man,
Vast cruel tribes that through the desert ran,
Giants whose height transcends the towering oak,
Brutes with whose screams the trembling forest shook
All these and more they held no cause of fear,
Since naught but slavery, dreadful could appear.
Ah see the day, distressful to the view,
Wives, husbands, fathers, bid a long adieu,
Dear native land, how heaved the heavy sigh,
When thy last mountains vanished on the eye,
Then their frail barks, just entered on the sea,
Pursued the long uncomfortable way:
But pitying heaven the just design surveys,
Sends prosperous gales, and wafts them over the seas.
Behold the shore; no rising cities there,
To hail them welcome from the sea appear,
In the wild woods the exiled host were spread,
The heavens their covering, and the earth their bed:
What expectations but a life of woe?
Unnumber'd Myriads of the savage foe,
Whose brutal fury raised, at once might sweep
The adventurers all to death's destructive sleep;
Yet 'midst this scene of horror and despair,
Stout industry began his office here,
Made forests bend beneath his sturdy stroke,
Made oxen groan beneath the sweaty yoke,
Till half the desert smiled and looked as gay
As northern gardens in the bloom of May.
But ah, review the sorrows interwove,
How the fierce native with the stranger strove; --
So heaven's bright lamp the all-reviving sun,
Just as his flaming journey is begun,
Mists, fogs and vapors, sprung from damps of night,
Mount up and strive to dim the approach of light;
But he in triumph darts his piercing ray,
Scatters their forces and pursues his way.
Often when the husband did his labor leave
To meet his little family at eve,
Stretchd in their blood he saw each well known face,
His dear companion and his youthful race;
Perhaps the scalp with barbarous fury torn,
The visage mangled, and the babe unborn
Ripp'd from its dark abode, to view the sun,
Ere nature finished half she had begun.
And should we now when spread through every shore,
Submit to that our fathers shunned before?
Should we, just heaven, our blood and labor spent,
Be slaves and minions to a parliament?
Perish the thought, nor may one wretch remain,
Who dares not fight and in our cause be slain;
The cause of freedom daunts the hireling foe,
And gives each Sampson's strength toward the blow,
And each, like him, whom fear nor force confines,
Destroys a thousand modern Philistines.
Who fights to take our liberty away,
Dead-hearted fights and falls an easy prey;
The cause, the cause, most cruel to enslave,
Disheartens thousands, and unmans the brave:
Who could have thought that Bri-ons bore a heart,
Or British troops to act so base a part?
Britons of old renowned, can they descend,
TO enslave their brethren in a foreign land?
What oath, what oath, inform us if you can,
Binds them to act below the worth of man?
Can they whom half the world admires, can they
Be advocates for vile despotic sway?
Shall they to every shore and clime renowned
Enforce those acts that tyranny did found?
'Yet sure if this be their resolved design,
'Conquer they shall wherever the sun does shine*
'No expedition proved unhappy yet,
'Can we Havanna's bloody siege forget,
'Where British cannon the strong fortress tore,
'And winged whole legions to its infernal shore
'Or does the voice of fame so soon forego
'Gibraltar's action, and the vanquished foe,
'Where art and nature both at once combined
'To baffle all our hardy troops designed? --
'Yet there Britannia's arms successful sped,
'While haughty Spaniards trembled, felt and fled
So say the pension'd tools of slavery,
So say our traitors, but so say not I --
(Tories or traitors, call them which you choose,
Tories are rogues, and traitors imps broke lose)
But know ye few, the scandal of our land,
On whom returns the blood that we expend.
Those troops whose feats are told on every shore,
Here lose their spirit and are brave no more;
When armies fight to gain some cruel cause,
Establish tyrants or destructive laws.
True courage scorns to inspire the hateful crew,
Recall past fame, or spur them on to new;
Dark boding thoughts the heavy soul possess,
And ancient valor turns to cowardice.
Dark was the prospect, gloomy was the scene,
When traitors joined to break our union chain:
But soon by heaven inspired arose the cry,
Freedom or death, unite, unite or die.
Now far and wide a manly spirit reigns,
From Canada to Georgia's sun burnt plains;
Few now insult with falsehoods, shameless pen,
Monsters from Tophet driven in shapes of men:
Few pension'd scribblers left the daring head,
Some have turned lunatics and some have fled --
Some late converted, scarce their pensions hold,
And from mere force disdain the charms of gold.
What deep offense has fired a monarch's rage,
What moonstruck madness seized the brain of Gage?
Laughs not the soul, when an imprisoned few,
Affect to pardon those they cannot subdue?
Though twice repulsed and hemmed up to their stations,
Yet issue pardons, oaths and proclamations,
As if at sea some desperate madman crew
Should threat the tempest with what they could do,
And like proud Xerxes lash the angry waves,
At the same instant that they find their graves.
But not the pomps and favors of a crown,
A nations anger, or a statesman frown,
Could draw the virtuous man from virtue's way,
To chain by force what treach'ry cannot betray,
Virtue disdains to own tyrannic laws,
Takes part with freedom, and assumes its cause,
No part had she, her fiercest forces own,
To bring so far this heavy vengeance on;
She stood with Romans while their hearts were true,
And so she shall, Americans with you.
Should heaven in wrath decree some nations fall,
Whose crimes from thence for sacred vengeance call,
A monarch first of vulgar soul should rise,
A sure forerunner of its obsequies,
Whose heart should glow with not one generous thought
Born to oppress, to propagate, and rot,
Whose lengthened reign no deed of worth should grace
None trusted but a servile pensioned race;
Too dull to know what saving course to take,
That heaven in time its purpose might forsake,
Too obstinately willed to bow his ear
To groaning thousands or petitions hear,
Dare break all oaths that bind the just like fate,
Oaths, that th'Arch-Devil would blush to violate,
And foe to truth both oaths and honor sell,
To establish principles, the growth of hell,
Style those who aim to be his truest friends,
Traitors, insidious rebels, madmen, fiends,
Hoodwinked and blind, deceived by secret foes,
Whose fathers once with exiled tyrants rose,
Blessed with as little sense as God ever gave,
Slave to wrong schemes, dupe to a noble knave.
So odd a monarch heaven in wrath would plan,
And such would be the fury of a man.
See far and wide over long Canadia's plains,
Old popish fraud and superstition reigns;
The scarlet whore long has heaven withstood,
Who cries for murder and who thirsts for blood,
Established there, marks down each destined name,
And plants the stake impatient for the flame,
With sanguinary soul her trade begins,
To doom her foes to hell or pardon sins;
Her crafty priests their impious rites maintain,
And crucify their Savior once again;
Defend his rights, who scattering lies abroad,
With shameless front usurps the seat of God:
Those are, we fear, who his vile cause assert,
But half reformed and papists at the heart.
Bear me some power as far as winds can blow,
As ships can travel, or as waves can flow,
To some lone isle beyond the southern pole,
Or lands round which pacific waters roll,
There should oblivion stop the heaving sigh,
There should I live at least with liberty,
But honor checks my speed and bids me stay,
To try the fortune of the well fought day,
Resentment for my country's fate I bear,
And mix with thousands for the willing war;
See Washington New Albion's freedom owns,
And moves to war with half Virginia's sons,
Bold in the fight, whose actions might have awed,
A Roman Hero, or a Grecian God,
He, he, as first, his gallant troops shall lead
Undaunted man a second Diomede,
As when he fought at wild Ohio's flood,
When savage thousands issued from the wood*
When Braddock's fall disgraced the mighty day,
And Death himself stood weeping over his prey,
When doubting victory changed from side to side,
And Indian soil with Indian blood was died,
When the last charge repulsed th'invenom'd foe,
And lightnings lit them to the shades below.
See where from various distant climes unites,
A generous council to protect our rights,
Fixed on a base too steadfast to be moved,
Loving their country, by their country loved,
Great guardians of our freedom, we pursue
Each patriot measure as inspired by you;
Columbia, nor shall fame deny it owes
Past safety to the counsel you propose,
And if they do not keep Columbia free,
What will alas! become of Liberty?
Great souls grow bolder in their country's cause,
Detest enslavers, and despise their laws,
O Congress famed, accept this humbly lay,
The little tribute that the muse can pay,
On you depends Columbia's future fate
A free asylum or a wretched state,
Fallen on disastrous times we push our plea,
Heard or not heard, and struggle to be free,
Born to contend, our lives we place at stake,
And grow immortal by the stand we make,
O you, who far from liberty detained,
Wear out existence in some slavish land,
Fly thence from tyrants, and their flattering throng,
And bring the fiery freeborn soul along,
Neptune for you shall smooth the hoary deep,
And awe the wild tumultuous waves to sleep;
Here vernal woods, and flowery meadows blow,
Luxuriant harvests in rich plenty grow,
Commerce extends as far as waves can roll
And freedom, God-like freedom crowns the whole.
And you brave men who scorn the dread of death,
Resolved to conquer to the latest breath,
Soldiers in act, and heroes in renown
Warm in the cause of Boston's hapless town,
Still guard each pass, like ancient Romans, you
At once are soldiers, and are farmers too;
Still arm impatient for the vengeful blow,
And rush intrepid on the yielding foe;
As when of late midst clouds of fire and smoke,
Whole squadrons fell, or to the center shook,
When even the bravest to your arms gave way,
And death exulting, eyed the unhappy fray,
Behold, your WARREN bleeds, who both inspired,
To noble deeds, and by his actions fired
What pity heaven! -- but you who yet remain
Affect his spirit as you loved the man:
Once more, and yet once more for freedom strive,
To be a slave what wretch would dare to live?
We too to the last drop our blood will drain,
And not till then shall hated slavery reign,
When every effort, every hope is over,
And lost Columbia swells our breasts no more*
O if that day, which heaven avert must come,
And fathers, husbands, children meet their doom
Let one brave onset yet that doom preceed,
To show the world America can bleed,
One thundering raise the midnight cry,
And one last flame send Boston to the sky.
But cease, foreboding Muse, nor strive to see
Dark times derived by fatal destiny;
If ever Heaven befriended the distressed,
If ever valor succored those oppressed,
America rojoice, thy standard rear,
Let the loud trumpet animate to war:
Thy guardian Genius haste thee on thy way,
To strike whole hosts with terror and dismay.
Happy some land, which all for freedom gave,
Happier the men whom their own virtues save;
Thrice happy we who long attacks have stood,
And swam to Liberty through seas of blood;
The time shall come when strangers rule no more,
Nor cruel mandates vex from Britain's shore;
When Commerce shall extend her short'ned wing,
And her free freights from every climate bring.
When mighty towns shall flourish free and great,
Vast their dominion, opulent their state;
When one vast cultivated region teems,
From ocean's edge to Mississippi streams;
While each enjoys his vineyard's peaceful shade,
And even the meanest has no cause to dread;
Such is the life our foes with envy see,
Such is the godlike glory to be free.
FINIS.
