NEW YEAR's VERSES Addressed to the Customers of The FREEMAN'S JOURNAL, By the
Lad who carries it. JANUARY 8th, 1783.
LET those who will, in hackney'd rhyme
And common cant, take up your time
And even the Muse's aid implore
To tell you what you knew before,
That days are short and nights are long,
The weather cold and hunger strong.
The markets high -- and such like stuff --
I Am sure you know it well enough; --
Untaught by us, I dare to say
You hit, exactly, New Year's Day,
And knew at least as well as we
The present year is eighty three; --
(Such simple things as these to tell
A mere drum head would do as well --)
All this I knew you knew before,
And therefore knocked not at your door
Upon the individual day
When eighty three came into play,
With verses for the purpose planned
Bidding you gravely watch your sand,
Since death is always near at hand;
All this I left to those whose trade is
To threaten beaus and frighten ladies,
And brought my papers, (swiftly speeding)
The Freeman's Journal, for your reading.
Unhappy Journal, doomed by fate
To meet with unrelenting hate,
From those that can their venom spit
Yet condescend to steal your wit;
While Timon with malicious spirit
Allows you not a grain of merit,
While he an idle pomp assumes
Let him return his borrowed plumes,
And you will find the insect creeping
With not a feather worth the keeping.
But this is neither here nor there,
May quarrels past dissolve in air;
In Stygian waves of sable hue
Be all absorbed with EIGHTY TWO,
Or lost on Lethe's silent Shore
Disgrace our rising state no more.
Another word I meant to say,
(Kind customers, have patience pray,
My subject is the New Year's day,)
How came it that mistaken man
Has thus inverted Nature's plan
And contradicted common reason
By making this the mirthful season,
When all is dreary dull and dead,
The sun to southern climates fled
To dart his fierce and downright beams
Intensely on Brazilian streams;
No daisies on the frozen plain,
No daffodils to please the swain,
The limpid wave compelled to freeze
And not a leaf upon the trees! --
It Is wrong -- the very birds will say;
Their New Year is the bloom of May,
Then nature calls to soft delights,
And they obey as she invites.
And yet this happiness below,
Which all would gain but few know how,
Is not to time or place confined,
It Is seated only in the mind;
Let Seasons vary as they will
Contentment leaves us happy still,
Makes life itself pass smooth away,
Makes every hour a New Year's day.
