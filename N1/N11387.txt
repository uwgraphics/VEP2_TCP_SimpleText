A P^EM, Upon the present Times, with a brief (...) humble Address to the
ALMIGHTY, in Behalf of the (...) of our Cause.
Composed by Philoleutheros Americanus.
TOM Tory who not long ago was sent,
By George the third to rule this continent,
W^^^ his c^mm^ssion was so elevated,
Which proved p^or Tom was very shallow-pa^^d.
S^^d he to George, if you will let me have
Ten thousand men, no other help I crave,
To drive the country to the western shore,
It Is quite enough I Am sure I want no more,
O^ half that number I suppose would do,
To force submission from that rebel crew.
Who wont subm^t to your ty^annic laws?
I cannot imagine what should be the cause.
But I shall make them quickly all obey.
And glad to yie^d to your ty^annic sway.
R^^her than ^^ll by my victorious arm,
I feel my b^e^st with martial a dor warm.
I long to let my royal master know
What great exploits your general can do.
Lord North shall plot, and you shall set the seal
To all the devility he does reveal.
But first great s^^, I cannot but think 'twould suit,
That you should send a line or two to Bute;
For he is in F^^nce and soon can let you know,
The best advice from the dark pit below,
For you have no subject in your spacious realm,
Except myself so fit to set at helm,
As these two pol^ticians seem to be,
They do so well with Beelzebub agree.
And he is always ready to ad^^se,
And loves to deal in tyranny and lie^.
Besides a parliament great (...) you have,
Who never tried America to save,
Except a few who from Lord North declines,
And wi^h Lord B^te was in the Spanish m^nes,
There to remain till he his breath resigned,
In bondage and it servi^ude confined,
Because his un^^e^sally well know,
These two vile wretches are so wicked grown,
That all America must bleed and die,
O^e ^e resign their ^a^^l p^^perty.
As ^ree born subject^, freed^m they would have,
Which m^st be owned the God of nature gave,
But their bold sch^m^s shall quickly be detected,
And they to lawless tyranny subjected.
His wicked schemes Tom having now revealed,
He folded up the letter which he sealed,
Watched the first opportunity and sent,
By the first ship which to Old-England went,
Soon that arrived and North received the letter,
And nothing under heaven pleased him better,
He read the letter to his royal master,
Read very fast, but wished he could read faster.
Now having read the wicked letter through,
Great sir, said he, what had we best to do.
It Is my opinion and my great desire,
That all America be set on fi^e,
Unless they will subm^t to you and me,
Though my design ^s lawless tyranny.
But first I think it is be^^ that we should send
To France, for there we have a special friend,
Lo^d Bute, for ^e you know is my relation,
And we three politicians rule the nation.
North wrote a letter which he sent to France,
By a small vessel which he found by chance,
But what he wo^^e, I cant at present tell,
Because I cant remember very well.
But then he wrote the substance of the ^^ay,
Of the two Englands at this present day,
That Thomas G^ge was resolute to join
The British forces and with them combine,
The Massachusett's province to subdue,
And every other northern province too,
Must all submit, and bow the servile kne^,
To lawless power and Brit^sh tyranny.
Lord But^ received the letter which was wi^^,
Then called a cou^cil from the lower pi^,
To know what ^ort of counsel he had better
Return in answer to this wicked letter.
Lord Bute was cle^k to the (...) clan,
Satan was chairman when the (...) beg^^,
But soon they vo^ed Bute shou^^ take his place,
Because the worst of all the human race.
He asked advice, which all were free to give,
Which was that no American should live,
Unless he should his proper^y resign,
To lawless power, and to a tyrant join,
That George the third, or rather North the tyrant,
(The truth of what I say ^o^ may rely on it)
Should send his force^ to this northern shore,
To burn and plunder all they came before,
That a death warrant quickly should be sent,
To North America with this ^^tent,
That all might tremble at the awful news,
Lay down their arms, nor in the least refuse,
A calm submission to tyran^^ power,
The like on earth was never known before,
That Tom should march to Philadelphia town,
Pull every place of public ^orship down,
And Nero like, the aged ^ou^d destroy,
The blooming virgin and (...) bea^dless boy,
Should snatch the infant from the streaming breast,
Whose spouting veins shou^^ maculate his vest,
And when he reached the Philadelphia shore,
Both young and old should welter in their go^e,
Except the Congress, which no was to take,
And every patriot should ^isoner make,
And like the cruel persecu^^^g Saul,
Should bring them b^n^ (...) ^^stice, one and all,
Hand cuff'd with (...) hard and strong,
And like a pack of felon^ (...) along,
Such the resolves of the in (...) ^^^w,
The cruel verdict all cons^ (...)*
With ^lmost spend Lord Bu^^ ^ letter wrote,
Sent by Charon's weather^ (...) boat,
The news to carry to the (...) isle.
Lord North received the (...) with a smile,
Then smiling to his royal (...) said.
America shall be in ashe^ (...)
Unless they will submit to (...) and me,
Here is a plot of popish ty^^nny,
Hatched by my father who (...) France resides,
Who with your majesty (...) pr^sides.
You know great si^, Tom G^ge a letter sent,
Hoping much future (...) to prevent,
If but ten thousand men (...) might obtain,
To quell the Whigs, and ^o extend your reign,
From sea to sea, and to the friged zone,
Make all obedient to the British throne.
And though he thinks ten tho^s^nd men would do,
And be sufficient to subdue the f^e,
Yet twenty thousand I advise to sen^
That the disturbance soon may have an end.
Most noble lord, his majesty replied,
What you petition, shall ^ot be denied,
To all the plots which (...) to me reveal
I will consent, and set my royal seal,
That all may bow, nor da^^ to contradict,
But yield to every thing you shall infl^ct.
Full twenty thousand (...) raised with speed,
All shipped on board, and (...) well agreed,
Neptune and E^rus soo^ (...) ships conveyed
To Boston shore, and i^ ^arbour laid.
Tom saw the shipping, ^^ugh'd from ear to ear,
To see so much artillery ^ppear,
With soldiers plenty, rea^^y to obey,
What he should order wi^h impartial sway.
They quickly landed w^^h their war like store,
Tom never felt one ha^ ^o big before.
And now sa^ he, I will (...) pleasure ^^e,
I^ the first place, I Will stop the public news,
That none may know w^ is my grand intent,
Which is to govern all the conti^ent*
And like a king to exe^cise my power,
No mor^e^ ever felt so big before;
I feel myse^f (...) as a king,
With North America, all i^ a string,
With flexile knee, obeying my command,
And fondly cringing to salute my hand.
Thus by himself, poor Tom a council held,
With self-conceit and proclamations filled,
But many ta^k of Robbin-Hood we k^^w,
Who never yet so much as bent his b^w,
As by this hero is exemplified,
Who eighteen months or something better tried
By all his forces to obtain his will.
At length he got as far as Bunker's Hill;
Though he himself would never take the field,
But like a valiant coward kept concealed*
And well he might, for often tim^^ it is said,
That his own soldiers would have had his head,
Had he exposed himself to public view,
And I suppose the rumor to be true.
Thus disappointed of his expectation,
His little heart was filled with perturbation.
He walked the st^e^^s, not knowing what to do,
Looked like a spector from the pit below.
Some days he walked in this dist^e^s'd condition,
Then like a cowa^d, quitted his commission,
Which when his royal master came to h^a^,
He o^der'd he should speedily appear
Before his betters, give a reas^^ why,
He thus behaved, or like a cowa^d ^^e.
T^m soon obeyed the summons which was sent,
To be arraigned before the p^rli^ment.
But how ^e (...) I never yet could ^ea^,
And I (...)
But there I se^^e him on the Brit^sh (...),
And ^o this con^inent return once mo^^
To General H^w^, who took poor T^m's commission,
Which he resig^'d to such a sad condition.
Now since Lord How (...) by his master sent,
And has ass^m'd the reins of government,
Which way the scale will turn no mortal knows,
Or how the Almighty will of us dispose.
So great the Hero, noble the commander,
Little inferior to great Alexander.
But yet at present I must needs conclude,
What honestly we purchased and subdued,
We have as just a title to enjoy.
And that no living mortal may destroy.
What our sore ^at^er's in this desa^^ s^ught,
And for their money of the natives bought.
Yet freely to the Almighty I appeal*
Nor would be tried by fortunes fickle wheel.
O, thou Almighty Conducte^ of Heaven!
Who all our lives and properties ^^st give^,
Thou do thy pleasure (...) without control,
Where all the planetary chorus roll,
So is this earth the object of thy care,
Where beasts and birds innum^^able are.
The scal^l^ tribes which cut the ^^a^ing b^i^e,
And every b^eathing particle is thine,
Though vast the number, never was (...) found,
Without thy car^ one li^^le^s on the ground.
But man though vile, is thy peculi^^ ca^e,
Endowed with faculties (...),
With wh^^ the b^e creation do e^j^y,
Yet how they se^k even other to dest^oy.
Look down with p^^y on our b^^ed^^^ ^^rd.
To the destroying angel give c^mm^nd,
That to the s^^boa^d he return again,
The sh^ning blade, there ever to remain.
O^r ^oes (...), n^me^^us ^^d strong*
And seem re^^lv'd the quarrel to prolo^g.
Yet thou ca^ ^^ve by many o^ b^^ew.
And have a r^ght to gov^^n, it is thy (...).
To th^^ (...) ca^e the j^^^^ce of o^^ ^^use,
And would (...) tried (...) unerring (...).
By thee, the p^^ud Egyp^^^n ^ost was dr^w^'d,
Thou d^dst (...) advice con^^^^d,
The great Ass^ (...) did d^^^^^y,
(...) by a ^ss boy.
T^ wa^ (...) vict^^y was thin^,
In (...) hands (...) ^rmy (...),
And (...) have, and (...).
