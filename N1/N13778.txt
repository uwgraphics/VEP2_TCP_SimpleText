In Council, March 26, 1781.
SIR,
I ENCLOSE you by express, three acts of the last session of Assembly for
ascertaining the number of militia in the state; exempting artificers employed
at iron works from militia duty, and remedying the inconveniences arising from
the interruption of the draught and he procuring clothes, provisions, and
wagons for the army.

WE expect to send a vessel shortly with a flag, from this place to
Charlestown, with tobacco, to be disposed of for our captive officers and
soldiers there. Be so good as to give notice to the friends of any of them
within your county, that any articles which they may think proper to send for
their relief by that conveyance, shall have a free passage, if ready to be
delivered here by the last of April, and not too much for the spare room in the
vessel.

THE number of deserters from the British army who have taken refuge in this
state, is now considerable, and daily augmenting. These people notwithstanding
their coming over to us, being deemed in law alien enemies, and as such, not
admissible to be citizens, are not within the scope of the militia and invasion
laws, under which citizens alone can be embodied I thought it necessary to
observe this to you, lest any error in this point should creep into practice,
by incorporating those persons into the militia of the state.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, Your most obedient, and most
humble servant,
