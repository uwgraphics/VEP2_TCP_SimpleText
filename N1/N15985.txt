SONGS for CHILDREN.


SONG I.
I.
LITTLE darling, quickly rise,
Morning blushes in the skies;
Now the prospect all is gay,
Rise to work, to (...), or play.
II.
Do not use "the Sluggard's guise,
"Loath to go to bed or rise:"
Think how sweet is early day,
Rise, my darling! come away.
III.
Molly will the fire prepare;
Cakes and tea shall be your fare;
Breakfast waits. Make haste, I pray,
Take it, love; -- then come away.
IV.
Look! the kitten on the hearth,
With the morning, wakes to mirth:
Pretty little Puss will play,
When she sees the morning gay.
V.
Don't you hear the gentle dove
Cooing in the neighboring grove?
While the tender lambkins play,
All to hail the rising day.
VI.
And the be in rosy bowers,
Sipping honey from the flowers;
Little creature, seems to pay
Tribute to the early day.
VII.
Sleep, you know, was made for night,
Not to waste the golden light;
Those that sleep their time away,
Don't deserve the sight of day.
VIII.
Let the naughty children lie,
You are no such LULLABY;
Minding what your parents say,
You will rise to read or play.
IX.
Early hours are good for health;
Early rising leads to wealth;
Whether it is for work or play,
Learn to rise with rising day!
SONG II.


I.
COME Harry and Polly, and
Billy anti Dolly,
My play-fellows all, hither come;
With manners so pretty, a while
leave the city,
And ramble a little from home.
II.
We shall all be delighted, and none will be slighted,
Our nurses too with us shall come;
And we'll all be playing, the time sweet delaying,
'Till evening shall warn us -- go home.
III.
While we are well treated, our pleasure completed,
Sure all the good children will come;
As in innocent sporting new pleasures we are courting,
We shall dream of them when we go home.
IV.
Our joys thus overflowing, no cares nor ills knowing,
As none that are naughty must come;
By all thus regarded, and praised and rewarded,
How merrily we shall go home!
SONG III.


I.
TELL me not of silly fears,
Such as foolish children do!
Sudden starts and causeless tears,
Dearest! were not made for you.
II.
No!for you our darling are,
By your mother fondly pressed;
You are all your nurse's care,
And by every friend caressed.
III.
Don't you fear the bugbear crew,
Naughty boys that come to fright;
Don't you think they will come to you,
If you sleep without a light.
IV.
Light and darkness all the same,
With good boys and girls should be;
These indeed are but a name,
He that is good, from fear is free.
V.
Then, my child, in quiet rest,
For, believe me, it is most true;
While with innocence you're blessed,
Bugbears are not made for you.
SONG IV.


I.
IT IS a pretty bird, my deary,
See his wings are tipped with gold;
What a pity he should fear ye,
But he should not be too bold.
II.
In the woods had you first found him,
When he warbled from the spray;
When the joys of freedom crowned him,
O! how sweet, though wild his lay.
III.
But in bondage thus restraining,
Though he tunes his little voice,
Still his song is but complaining;
Can the captive ever rejoice?
IV.
Arts in time may tame and please him,
(Arts he never knew when free)
But in vain you strive to please him,
While he pants for liberty.
SONG V.


I.
THE fish that wild sports through the book,
Thinks the pleasures of life are his own;
But when he is once caught on the hook,
Alas! all those pleasures are gone.
II.
The angler too sure plies the bait,
Contrived to deprive him of breath;
In sport see he swallows his fate,
And his pleasures are ended in death.
III.
And such is the fate of the child,
From his parents who wildly will run;
Although by false pleasure beguiled,
At last he is lost and undone.
SONG VI.


I.
WHEN SALLY was little, she lived in a cot,
With her father, and mother, and aunt;
And though, as it seems, they no riches had got,
Yet their darling did never know want.
II.
When SALLY grew bigger she went to a school,
And there, as her play-fellows tell,
She minded her learning, observed every rule,
For a while not a girl did so well.
III.
She was notic'd by many. -- A gay lady fair,
Once took her with kindest intent;
She made the young SALLY her principal care,
And took her wherever she went.
IV.
Now while SALLY was good she lived like a queen;
What a pity she does not so still!
But with sad wicked children at last she was seen,
And she will go with them, say what you will.
V.
'T was this made the lady young SALLY forsake,
No more would she act a friend's part,
But the girl she obliged to her own ways to take,
And her mother has broken her heart.
VI.
Thus, now SALLY is naughty, she is hated by all,
And, if she don't mend in her ways,
By her obstinate folly to ruin she will fall,
Though once she had every one's praise.
VII.
Then think of young SALLY; take warning betimes,
Of bad company early beware;
if you join naughty children, you will share in their crimes,
And certainly fall in a snare.
SONG VII.


I.
WHILE you smell at that rose-bud, my love,
whilen its beautiful hue each admires,
Your mind you may aptly improve,
by lessens which prudence inspires.
II.
The flower is all gay to the sight,
Its blush is like that of the morn;
But yet with its colors so bright,
Don't you see it is armed with a thorn.
III.
When you press it, be careful of harm,
Lest your fingers unwary you wound;
If you should, it no longer would charm,
Though with summer's choice beauties it is crowned.
IV.
No flower that adorns the gay green,
Indeed with the rose can compare;
It is bright in simplicity seen,
The rose is both useful and fair.
V.
But yet every sweet has its sour.
And all things on earth still must cloy;
And godness alone has the power,
To give us true comfort and joy.
VI.
Then in search of soft pleasures, my dear,
As along life's gay stream you are borne,
All bright while the prospects appear,
Pluck the rose, but beware of the thorn.
SONG VIII.


I.
OVER the fields, through the gardens we rove at our will,
For leave is now given us to play;
So we'll take thus of innocent pastime our fill,
And make holiday while we may.
II.
It Is because we have been good that such pleasures we taste,
Our'essons so soon we have learned;
That now we have leisure which pays for our haste,
No joys are like those which are earn'n.
III.
Then to Charley, to Jemmy, to Betsey we'll go,
But Peter the naughty we'll shun;
For we cannot true pleasure in company know,
Of boys that from learning will run.
IV.
Little Charley and Jemmy their parents obey,
And Betsey's so good, that I find.
Her aunt has just given her a frock fine and gay,
And her friends are all loving and kind.
V.
When we leave off our sporting, and home I return,
I know what Mamma will give me,
And my brother and sister, for all in our turn
Will be happy and all will agree.
VI.
And now to the pye-house you will all take a race;
But stop a while 'till you start fair;
Oh I see that young Tommy breaks first from his place,
Yet I Will catch him before he gets there.
SONG IX.


I.
DID you see young pouting WATTY?
Did you see him late I pray?
He has been so very naughty,
That he cannot go out today.
II.
See, now, at the door I spy him,
He for very spite and shame,
Bites his lip, don't let us go nigh him,
'Till he owns he is to blame.
III.
He Is a stubborn boy, my Nancy,
Stubborn folks never want for woe;
But correction will, I fancy,
Make him yet his errors know.
IV.
If it does not, still offending
All who wish him well to do;
Without any hope of mending,
Ruin must his steps pursue.
V.
Then let you and I take warning,
Early thus from others harm;
WATTY's faults in time discerning,
And by goodness learn to charm.
SONG X.


I.
SINGING, dancing, anticks, tumbling,
Trick on trick still merry jumbling;
Full of laughing, joking, sporting,
To the booths the crowd resorting.
such is a country fair, boys.
II.
People still on people pressing,
Players and their puppets dressing;
Some the pence together scraping,
Others quite employed in gaping.
Such is a country fair, boys.
III.
While the crowds thus oddly mixing,
Merry Andrew throws his tricks in;
Merry Andrew still diverting,
For his tricks there is no hurt in.
Such is a country fair, boys.
IV.
Here are ribbands, caps, and laces,
Cakes and toys in other places;
All alike for show displaying,
Choose at will, it is but paying.
Such is a country fair, boys.
V.
Nanny, Billy, Patty, Molly,
Little Ned and sister Dolly;
All will go to spend their treasure,
For the scene is full of pleasure.
Such is a country fair, boys.
SONG XI.


I.
IF you're given to boasting, you will never do well:
Be silent, but evermore strive to excel;
And if you will attend now a story I Will tell.
For sweet modesty's charms you may learn here;
The beauties of sweet modesty.
II.
There once was a BUTTERFLY gaudy and vain.
Who spied a poor mole creeping over the plain,
And she viewed him indeed with an eye of disdain.
Sweet modesty's charms you may learn here;
The beauties of sweet modesty.
III.
She quickly began his rough from to despise,
His creeping on earth and his want of bright eyes;
But the mole quite contented still nothing replies.
Sweet modesty's charms you may learn here;
The beauties of sweet modesty.
IV.
But a bird in his swiftness now rushed through the air,
And soon made a prey of the insect so fair;
While the mole still jogged onward devoid of all care.
Sweet modesty's charms you may learn here;
The beauties of sweet modesty.
V.
Though the mole could not see yet he heard of her fate,
Quite happy, he neither was vain nor was great;
He was wise and content, nor repented too late.
Sweet modesty's charms you may learn here;
The beauties of sweet modesty.
SONG XII.


I.
WHAT a sweet and pretty creature
We have buried, Charles, today;
Oh! it sung the songs of nature,
And has often made us gay.
II.
But 'twas wild and would be straying,
Never could endure its cage;
And as thus all giddy straying,
Chanced with PUSSY to engage.
III.
Cruel PUSSY little caring
For his form or song so sweet;
Ever watching and ensnaring,
Caused him soon his fate to meet.
IV.
Though we pitied him when dying,
And his shroud and coffin made;
Yet indeed there is no denying,
He was by himself betrayed.
V.
Had he stayed as friends would have him
In his cage or mistress' room,
Puss could not of life bereaved him,
He had never met his doom.
VI.
Wanton children, hence take warning,
Safest in your parents care;
When their gentle precepts scorning,
Ever sure to meet a snare.
SONG XIII.


I.
HOW sweet are the sports of our youth,
What pleasures with our's can [compare?
It Is innocence pleases, and truth,
To an infant's what joys can compare?
II.
So easy the blise that we find,
While none are our care or our woe;
Our parents may feel in their mind,
But no troubles their little ones know.
III.
With peace and contentment we rise,
If it be to our learning or play;
Let none our seet pastimes despite,
Since lif's but the sport of a day.
IV.
The grave ones may think as they will,
But can gravity give them the [pow'r,
Like us to live merrily still,
And happily spend the fleet hour.
V.
At marbles, at hoop, or at ball,
Or whatever the sports that delight;
In the day it is exercise all,
And sweetly we sleep in the night.
VI.
Though trifles we look for like these,
Do not men too their trifles pursue?
And gewgaws their fancies can please,
'T were well if as innocent too.
SONG XIV.


I.
WHILE the moon so sweetly shining,
Makes the scene as bright as day;
Quite your whimp'ring, and your whining,
Ask for leave, and come to play.
II.
Sunshine, to be sure, is glaring,
By the day we work and read;
Yet with softer beauties cheering,
Evening may its beauties plead.
III.
Ev'nings like to these are pretty,
All is quiet and serene;
Patty for them quits the city,
Patty, mamma's little queen.
IV.
Look the streams all silver running,
Hills all yellow'd over appear;
Woods the blaze of daylight shun-ning,
Yet are sweetly brightened here.
V.
As each little pastime varies,
By the pale, uncertain light;
Don't you look like little fairies,
Dancing in a ring by night?
VI.
But, though now the sports may keep ye,
Early hours require your rest;
Whether lively you or sleepy,
Early hours are always best.
SONG XV.


I.
WHAT do you see there my deary,
Which so much attracts your eyes,
That you draw the glass so near ye,
What fresh beauties there can rise?
II.
It Is your face that you are viewing
Pretty infant, full of play;
But the years, their course pursuing,
Take at last all charms away.
III.
All but those which Heaven bestowing,
On the mind which firm and sure;
Through old age and sickness glowing,
Still unfading shall endure.
IV.
Beauty is a short-lived blessing,
As a gaudy show admired;
Goodness merits our caressing,
Most by all to be desired.
V.
If the glass, is thus delighting,
Where a pretty face is seen;
Outward beauty so inviting,
Should remind of that within.
VI.
Then, my darling, while intent you
View so close a pretty face;
Think for what your Maker meant you,
Nor a lovely form disgrace.
SONG XVI.


I.
DEAREST Betsey say,
When I was away,
Was your sport and play,
Innocent and pretty.
II.
Without disguise,
Art or lies,
Truth I prize,
Ask my sister Kitty.
III.
She can tell,
Prise knows well,
So does Bell,
All was good and pretty.
IV.
We did read,
Sing indeed,
Ali agreed,
Charley ran with Kitty.
V.
In the shade,
Rings we made,
Laughing Played,
Was it not all pretty.
VI.
Take a kiss,
And for this,
Bell and Priss
Shall sup on tarts with Betty.
You are my darling yet,
O pretty, pretty BETT!
SONG XVII.


I.
MORNING now is past away,
On the fields the sunbeams play;
From the school returning soon,
See good boys go home at Noon.
II.
Naughty children sometimes stay,
Kept from dinner and from play;
You, my dear, and Kitty too,
Come the pleasing scene to view.
III.
Now before the dinner's got,
Let us walk to that green plot;
If the sun too sultry prove,
We may seek the shady grove.
IV.
There your play-fellows you will find,
They have left us far behind:
In the shed in yonder dale!
Dolly tends her cleanly pail!
V.
Don't you see the useful cow?
Don't you hear the creature low?
Thus she gives her store when due,
For syllabubs and puddings too.
VI.
Still her milk for you shall flow,
Thither dearest let us go;
There while we shall sport and play,
Noontide hour will pass away.
SONG XVIII.


I.
COME, come away,
For we must be gay,
Without any loss,
Any hind'rance or cross,
We sha1l find,
What is most to our mind,
A boy that is so good, he can never have foes,
But pleasure he meets with wherever he goes.
II.
And Sukey we find,
Good-natured and kind,
For her play-mates she still
Has goodnature at will,
To her mistress or nurse.
She never is worse;
She never needs anger, nor frowning, nor blows,
But smiles must attend her wherever she goes.
III.
So come all away,
To our meeting so gay,
Round the may pole we'll dance
And in pleasure advance,
Charles and Sukey shall be
Crowned with garlands, you will see.
Boys and girls, when so good, all distinction shall know,
And they shall have praises wherever they go.
SONG XIX.


I.
WHEN you live with your parents at home,
My infant how happy are you;
But When you are seeking to roam,
What evils alas! you pursue.
II.
If abroad you too carelessly play,
What troubles you oftentimes meet!
Being lost while you carelessly stray,
Or run down by the folks in the street!
III.
It Is then that you wish to comeback,
To your parents and nurses so kind;
Should you leave them at once, then [alack!
How many more troubles you would find.
IV.
The pets and the airs which you show,
Though sometimes corrected it is true;
That correction its good can bestow,
My dear, It Is the better for you.
V.
'T will be time enough many a long year,
For you through the wide world to roam;
And then you will soon wish too, my dear,
That you would still been contented at home.
VI.
Whatever are the scenes you behold,
And various, indeed, they must be;
As often by your nurse you have been told,
"Home is home, though it is homely," You Will see.
SONG XX.


I.
CHILDREN, while you seek for pleasure,
Don't you see the moments fly;
Mirth is yours, but keep in measure,
Though you laugh you soon may cry.
II.
But a Lott'ry, boys, this life is,
Most will lose, though all must play;
All our time but full of strife is,
You are happy in today.
III.
Do not ask about tomorrow,
Little wantons revel still;
Future times bring care and sorrow,
Soon, too soon, you will have your fill.
IV.
Yet, content with play and sports, you
Now may pass the time away;
Fleeting movements, as they court you,
But invite to sports and play.
V.
Like the beauties that surround you,
(Nature's beauties) which never cloy;
While with innocence thus crowned you
Every blessing shall enjoy.
SONG XXI.


I.
COME, leave off your schooling, to sport and to play,
For we must be all gay and merry today;
It is young CHARLEY's birthday.
We all must agree,
To visit our play-mate good humored and free.
While he invites,
And pleasure delights,
Who Will be so happy, so happy as we?
II.
Young CHARLEY is loved by the best in the town,
Good nature does still all his qualities crown;
He is free and good humored to you and to me,
And to like him we all must for ever agree.
While he invites,
And pleasure delights,
Who Will be so happy, so happy as we?
III.
'T was CHARLEY that won the first prize of good boys,
The cockade and medal he wears and enjoys,
On his birthday we all then, sure, present must be,
And the tea, cakes and fruit are got ready you see.
While they invite,
And pastimes delight,
There will none be so happy, so happy as we.
SONG XXII.
The GOOD BOY's GARLAND.


I.
WHEN BILLY was a little boy,
He then lived all alone;
Abroad his father had employ,
And mother he had none.
II.
So BILLY was unhappy quite,
But still his book he read;
And learning still was his delight,
Which to promotion led.
III.
The parson was a man full kind,
The child when he observed;
As BILLY first had took his mind,
His love he still preserved.
IV.
He taught him all good boys should know,
BILLY each lesson took;
While study is his full employ,
He profits by his book.
V.
Beloved by all; -- A merchant brave,
Took BILLY for his clerk;
Where he had all that boy could have,
And minded well his work.
VI.
The master died -- he had the trade,
And only daughter too;
And business all his study made,
Industrious did pursue.
VII.
His father now, returned again,
His voyage being done;
With gold and jewels at command,
And Would assist his son.
VIII.
But BILLY wanted none of these;
With riches of his own,
He lived in grandeur and in ease,
And not (as once) alone.
IX.
For he had friends, and soon was made
An Alderman we find;
And, as his talents he displayed
The city proved most kind.
X.
Lord Mayor of London, he at last,
In the gilt coach does ride,
See how he through the streets does pass,
His lady by his side.
SONG XXIII.


I.
WHAT a pretty kitten's here,
See how playful it is my dear;
Well does she the time beguile,
Though you're ill, she would make you smile.
II.
But behold in all her pride,
Sitting by the fire side:
As if full of thoughts of weight,
Grave old Puss is placed in state.
III.
Every thing the kitten views,
Sportive, happy, she pursues;
Mouse or paper cork and firing,
All alike can pleasure brag.
IV.
Once her mother, full of game,
Played and frisk'd, and did the same;
To a mouse even now inclined,
Still "The cat is after kind."
V.
Time has all the difference made,
The power of Time's in all displayed;
You, though full of merry play,
Will be grave another day.
VI.
Youth's the time for joy and mirth,
Youth will give all pleasures birth;
None your pleasures will despise,
Be but MERRY, child, and WISE.
SONG XXIV.


I.
YE children whom whimsies and follies prplex,
Whom passions misguide, and impatience vez,
Who never with pleasure your parents obey,
But are still discontented, at reading or play.
Attend to our counsel and we will declare,
How you may avoid all your follies and care.
II.
Consider of whom you were born, and how bed,
Consider who gives you your board and your bed;
Remember by whom 'twas you first saw the light,
Remember who guards you by day and by night.
Attend toour counsel, and hear us declare,
How you may avoid all your trouble and care.
III.
Be always compliant and do what you're bid,
For that is the way you will never be chid!
If your parents should frown, by your smiles you may charm,
For the smiles of sweet innoccence anger disarm.
Then attend to our counsel, and hear us declare,
How a child may avoid every trouble and care.
IV.
To all your acquaintance be gentle and kind,
The advice of your elders be sure that you mind;
Whatever they say, you will find for your good,
So let their instructions be always pursued
Attend to our counsel for they will declare,
How a child may avoid every trouble and care.
V.
With your play-fellows never be wrangling nor cross,
For they that are wranglers are sure to have loss;
But win by good humor the praises of those,
Who may serve you as friends, or may hurt you as foes.
Then attend to our counsels, and hear us declare,
How you may live happy, and avoid of all care.
VI.
Do to all, as yourself you would wish to be done by,
And scorn to tell tales, to speak evil, or lie;
Fear God, love your parents, and honor the King,
And happiness still from your actions shall spring.
Then attend to our counsels, and while thus we declare,
How you may live happy, and void of all care.
SONG XXV.


I.
OF every day that is in the week,
Good children should love one day;
And plainly, my dear boy, to speak,
The day I mean is Sunday.
II.
To church all decent folks then go,
There Charley, Billy, Harry,
And many others that we know,
Their little pray'r-books carry.
II.
And after Church abroad they walk,
Dressed neatly as you find too;
Of good and serious things they talk,
And all are free and kind too.
IV.
Through fertile fields of verdant hue,
In summer as they rove;
God's goodness they with wonder view,
In valley, mead, and grove.
V.
In winter round the cheerful hearth,
They talk of sports for Monday;
And full of sweet and harmless mirth,
They pass the hours of Sunday.
VI.
Then of all days, though seven are seen,
Each week we'll pitch on one day;
And that is the day that comes between
The Saturday and Monday.
SONG XXVI.


I.
COME my Charley, haste away,
This is sure a sportful day;
See, Mamma has her design,
BETSEY is your VALENTINE.
II.
Betsey whom Papa so loved,
Betsey by your friends approved;
See she dressed all gay and fine,
It Is to be your VALENTINE.
III.
You have see a young Betsey's ways,
Well you know she merits praise.
She Is good-natured, lively, free,
Pattern fit for you and me.
IV.
She at Easter cakes shail share,
As she did our Christmas fare;
How could we make holiday,
If our Betsey was away.
V.
Then let us haste with her to play,
On this fine and merry day;
Since it was Mamma's design,
Betsey should be your VALENTINE.
SONG XXVII.


I.
SEE the jolly train are reaping
Yellow sheaves in order placed;
Harvest home they will soon be keeping,
And the best of cheer shall taste.
II.
Those that labor to content ye,
Happily for you and me;
Well deserve to feast in plenty,
As they do you will plainly see.
III.
Summer's blessings are delighting,
Then good children in the fields.
View the season all delighting,
Taste the cherries, plumbs, it yields.
IV.
Now the year is growing riper,
Peaches, apples, pears we find;
Merrily now plays the piper,
While the corn the reapers bind.
V.
Charley, Billy, Polly, Hetty,
View the season with a smile;
Heaven be sure will never let ye
Want, while these for you shall toil.
VI.
One reaps quick, the other binds it,
When well thrash'd, on floors it is laid;
Then the jolly miller grinds it,
And it makes our daily bread.
SONG XXVIII.


I.
JACKEY was a pretty boy,
Jackey was his parent's joy;
But too often nursed and spoiled,
Jackey grew a naughty child.
II.
On a sultry summer's day,
Jackey would go out to play;
Left his school and parents too,
Thinking pleasure to pursue.
III.
There he saw the streams all run,
Brightly glittering in the sun;
Naughty boys would swimming go,
Jackey likewise would do so.
IV.
So he did; -- but soon the tide,
Carried him far off and wide;
And his play mates quickly found
Jackey likely to be drowned.
V.
One at length jumped in to save,
Jackey from the dreadful wave;
See he wet and sad does look,
Better he had learned his book.
VI.
Home the naughty boy is brought,
And severely told his fault;
See! he stays at home today,
While his school-mates are at play.
SONG XXIX.


I.
PRETTY little chidren come,
Though we have no sports of May,
You may hear our Billy's drum,
And our Sammy's fiddle play.
II.
They have been abroad to buy,
Toys their parents to them gave;
See their little flags on high,
Full of pleasure, how they wave!
III.
First of all the throng is Charley,
On his flag is writ in gold;
How his parents love him dearly,
Few so good, though twice as old.
IV.
Next comes Harry, known to all,
None like him at cricket play;
Little as he is, the ball
He can strike a wondrous way.
V.
But these sports are over now,
To the winter we must yield;
Winter calls the sheep and cow,
Cold and shivering from the field.
VI.
Yet still over the blazing fire,
Charley with our Kitty stands;
We can sport to our desire,
Play at questions and commands.
SONG XXX.


I.
IN infancy what joys appear,
To children only known;
For still with each succeeding year,
Fresh pleasures are their own.
II.
Papa, Mamma, all joyful view,
Those pleasures still improve;
And all your friends shall give you too
Some token of their love.
III.
Alas, that roses such as these,
Should ever fade away;
But infancy which thus can please,
My dear must soon decay.
IV.
The little lambs that frisking so,
All playful you behold;
Ere long, if they are alive, must go
All gravely to the fold.
V.
They must grow old, if life is spared,
So too must you and I;
The present moment then regard,
Nor for the future sigh.
VI.
In infancy may you my dear,
Your pleasures ever find;
Pleasures, that void of harm or fear,
Can leave no care behind.
SONG XXXI.


I.
THIS, London is a fine place,
A great and gallant city;
And though not all are blessed with grace,
The boys and girls are pretty.
II.
There is the wax-work to be shown,
And lions in the Tower;
And as full well to all is kuown,
New prospects every hour.
III.
But Pretty they who pretty da,
Your parents often tell you;
And if you keep their lives in view,
You Will find they told full well too.
IV.
Though London is a place so fine,
And various beauties strike you;
Yet at those beauties you will repine,
Unless the folks should like you.
V.
Wherever you go, learn to be good,
And you will be rewarded;
And where (though little) you are viewed,
You still will be rewarded.
VI.
And when from London you are come,
That great and gallant city,
Be you but good and kind at home,
Still all things will be pretty.
SONG XXXII.


I.
IT IS the season of mirth, boys, the people around,
All flock from their houses while music does sound;
It Is the season of mirth, boys, of frolic and play,
With the season returning, returns Lord-May'rs Day.
II.
See the companies daily advance in their pride,
Along the smooth Thames see the barges swift glide;
What noses! what shouting! the windows are lined,
With men, women, and children of every kind.
III.
See the Man all in armor rides on a fine horse,
And all through the city he takes his full course;
If the fogs don't prevent you, his armor so bright,
Will please you at once, and will dazzle your sight.
IV.
Last comes the Lord Mayor, his coach covered with gold
And the sheriffs, a sight that is quite fine to behold;
When the show is all over, to feasts they away,
And such are the pleasures of a Lord-May'rs Day,
SONG XXXIII.


I.
COME sleep, my sweet baby, the winds they will rock,
Yet nothing shall fright you, and nothing shall shock;
Sweet innocence guards you, on that still depend,
For that will make every one Charley's dear friend.
II.
But the naughty boy, when the wind whistles, shall fear,
if the trees do but nod, he thinks danger is near;
So he is always in trouble, deservdly so,
For the wicked and obstinate never want woe.
III.
But you will sleep soundly, your dreams will be sweet,
And when you awake all your joys be complete;
For sleeping or waking all pleasures we find,
Depend on the charms of an innocent mind.
IV.
Then sleep on my baby, the winds as they blow,
Shall on you still slumbers and safety bestow
Smile, smile, my dear Charley, for you may depend,
That Heaven shall your innocence ever befriend.
SONG XXXIV.


I.
PEACEFUL do the waters flow,
Gentle winds as peaceful blow,
Thus, my child, from fretting cease,
Hush, your passions into peace.
II.
When the blustering storms arise,
See how frightful look the skies;
But when calm, the prospect bright,
Glads you with the beauteous light.
III.
Calm the prospect of the mind,
When your temper's mild you will find,
Then are you like smiling May,
When the flowery Spring is gay.
IV.
But when crying, you deform
That pretty face, and fret and storm;
Like November's dreary day,
Then you fright your friends away.
V.
Then as waters gently flow,
When the breezes softly blow;
Do you be peaceable and mild,
Fret no more my pretty child.
SONG XXXV.


I.
A SPIDER once his web had spun,
And thought he dwelt securely
In a snug corner it was run,
And as he thought full surely.
II.
Many a thoughtless fly he caught,
And soon his fate decided;
Grown proud at last, he vainly though it
All foes to have derided.
III.
So high his cobweb seat he built,
So well he had designed it,
That while he gloried in his guilt,
Not Molly's broom could find it.
IV.
At length, one Summer's morn, a Be
Came humming round the ceiling.
And soon, like many others, she Entangled without feeling.
V.
The Spider from his secret cell,
Came out with thoughts most pleasing;
And with a leap he practiced well,
At once his prey was seizing.
VI.
But the strong Be his web destroyed
And the sly felon wounded;
Thus ere his conquest he enjoyed,
His schemes were all confounded.
VII.
Stung to the quick, he now withdrew,
And made a dismal moan;
The Be with honey loaded flew,
The Spider died alone.
VIII.
Thus wretches who work other's woe,
A while with joy relate;
When unexpected ills they know,
Unpitied meet their fate.
DIRECTIONS FOR ALL GOOD BOYS AND GIRLS TO FOLLOW.
I.
WHEN early in the morn you rise,
And shake off slumber from your eyes,
Fail not to pray to God on high,
To shower his blessings from the sky
II.
And when you have said your morning prayer,
Let cleanliness be next your care,
Your hair be combed, your face and hands
Be washed, as decency commands.
III.
Next mind in time vou get to school,
And there observe each proper rule;
Sit still and steady; on your book,
But not on other matters, look.
IV.
To learning if you will attend,
Learning will prove your greatest friend
Dunces for ever meet with shame,
And never rise to worth or fame.
V.
But those who to their book attend,
Shall always meet through life a friend;
And, howsoe'er their lot is cast,
If wise, will come to good at last.
VI.
Before your meals repeat your grace,
Then sit contented in your place;
Nor ask for any thing, but wait
Till meat be put upon your plate.
VII.
Sit upright, never forward lean,
From grease be sure that you keep clean;
Nor look around with greedy eye,
Nor eat too much of favorite pie.
VIII.
Sit sti1l 'till you are bid retire,
Nor crowd too close over winter fire;
Observe what all good children do,
And keep their pattern still in view.
IX.
Never be heard too loud to speak,
Only when asked your silence break;
Be sure your elders to obey,
Nor ever be quarrelsome at play.
X.
Never bear tales, or you will be
Hated by all you hear and see;
Mind but yourself -- let others do
Just as they please; -- it is naught to you.
XI.
Be of a temper kind and mild,
For that will best become a child;
A wrangler none can ever approve,
But gentleness secures you love.
XII.
If ever you should chance to meet
A common beggar in the street,
Do not with scorn that beggar view,
The God that made him, did make you.
XIII.
On school-mates never lay the fault,
If you have done what you ought not,
Believe me, child, however you cry.
It Is always best to scorn a lie.
XIV.
To every one give honor due,
And they will return their love to you;
There Is none so high, there is none so low,
But yet may prove a friend or foe.
XV.
But chief of all your parents prize,
it you would be blessed, if you would be wise,
Though now perhaps not understood,
All that they say is for your good.
XVI.
DO you a just example take,
I Will ways in proper time forsake,
Your safety never can be ensur'd,
But by your parent's care secured.
XVII.
In all your thoughts, at work or play,
Your teachers still1 should bear the sway;
Nor ever keep company with those,
Who other thoughts or words disclose.
XVIII.
When tired at night to bed you go,
Sleep quiet, as no cares you know,
Again your prayers to heaven addressed,
No doubt an infant shall be blessed.
XIX.
In every case let children own
They have no will that is their own;
And, though above their years, their wit,
Still to superiors mild submit.
XX.
Sweetness and goodness be their praise,
For these will last to other days;
The time will come when they shall prove,
That children's goodness gains Heaven's love.
THE CONCLUSION.
READ over these pleasing lines with care, my dear,
For you alone are they inserted here;
Songs wrote to please you, tales for you designed,
Both to divert you, and improve your mind.
Whatever you in earliest days are taught,
Is thus, by care, to just perfection brought;
Yet still amusement we shall here bestow,
For with amusement should instruction go.
Our verses are contrived for every ear,
And you must understand them when you hear:
Then to our rhymes a pleased attention give,
And you will taste their profits while you live.
To little ones our rhymes are now addressed,
Great ones may profit by the truths expressed.
Then let not any thing prevent your claim,
To take what leads you still to worth and fame.
In every line a moral fair is shown,
Children may make that moral still their own;
And, if they take it, shall in future days,
Succeed to wealth, to happiness, and praise.
FINIS.
