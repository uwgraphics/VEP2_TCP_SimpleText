THE PREFACE.
HISTORY has been so often written and improved, either for party purposes, or
mere amusement, that some serious persons have been ready to treat it as a
thing foreign from religion, and of little service to mankind. Yet the same
persons will readily own* that nothing teaches like experience; and what is
true history but the experience of those who have gone before us? of which
perhaps none have been more remarkable, since the affairs of Canaan, than those
of this country. And as the present contests about liberty and government are
very great, they call loudly for all the right therein that can be gained from
every quarter.

MR. Rollin in his ancient history says, " The powers that be are ordained of
God; but neither every use that is made of this power, nor every means for the
attainment of it, are from God, though every power be of him. And when we see
these governments degenerating, sometimes to violence, factions, despotic sway
and tyranny, it is wholly to the passions of mankind that we must ascribe those
irregularities which are directly opposite to the primative institution of
states; and which a SUPERIOR WISDOM afterward reduces to order, always making
them contribute to the execution of HIS de^^ga^, full of equity and justice.
This scene highly deserves our attention and admiration. It is with a view of
making the reader attentive to this object, that I think it incumbant on me to
add to the account of facts and events what regards the manners and customs of
nations; because these show their genues and character, which we may call, in
some measure, the soul of history."

NOW it may well be supposed, that men who are striving for more power over
others than belongs to them, will not nor cannot, set either their own or their
opponants genues and character in their just light. And if it should be found,
that near all the histories of this country which are much known, have been
written by persons who thought themselves invested with power to act as
lawgivers and judges for their neighbors, under the name either of orthodoxy,
or of immediate power from heaven, the inference will be strong, that our
affairs have never been set in so clear light as they ought to be; and if this
is not indeed the case I am greatly mistaken, of which the following account
will enable the reader to judge for himself.

THE greatest objection that I have heard against this design is, that we ought
not to take up the ashes of our good fathers, nor to rehearse those old
controversies, which will tend to increase our present difficulties. But what
is meant by this objection? To reveal secrets, or to repeat matters that have
been well settled, between persons or parties is forbidden, and its affects are
very pernicious; but what is that to a history of public facts, and an
examination of the principles and conduct, both of oppressors, and of the
oppressed?

MEN who are still fond of arbitary power may make the above objection; but a
learned and ingenous pedobaptist that felt the effects of such power, lately
said, "The presbyterians, I confess formerly copied too nearly the
episcopalians. The genuine principles of universal and impartial liberty were
very little understood by any; and all parties were too much involved in the
guilt of intollerance and persecution. The dissenters in our times freely
acknowledge this, and condemn the narrow principles or many of their
predecessors; having no objection to transmitting down to posterity, in them
true colors, the acts of oppression and intollerance of which all sects have
been guilty. Not indeed, as is sometimes done, with a view of encouraging such
conduct in one party by the example of others; but of exposing it alike in all,
and preventing it wholly, if possible, in time to come." F^^neaux's letter to
Black^^^e. p. 74.
This is the great design of the ensuing work; and which seems essentially
necessary to that end. For as every one is orthodox to himself, they who have
oppressed others, have always denied it. After our baptist fathers in Boston,
had been greatly injured for 15 years, they published a vindication of their
character; but as to their other sufferings contented themselves with saying,
"Some of us were oftentimes brought before councils and courts, threatened,
fined, our estates taken away, imprisoned and banished;" a noted minister
called their vindication, a fallacious narrative, and said, "Errors lie in
generals, a particular account might have been more satisfying." Willard's Ne
sator. p. 10.
Here therefore are a great number of particulars with good vouches to support
them; which show that oppression on religious accounts was not of the first
principles of New England, but was an intruder that came in afterward.

WHEN I was requested by several gentlemen of note and others, to undertake
this work, two great objections presented themselves to my mind against it;
namely, my great unfitness for it, and the difficulty of obtaining the
necessary materials. But their importunity prevailed against the first, and
divine providence has removed, the other, by conveying into my hands a variety
of authentic materials, much beyond what I conceived could have now been
obtained in the world. Many of them I have taken from the ancient records of
the colonies of Plymouth, Massachusetts, Providence and Rhode Island, as well
as the records of the united colonies: though I regret the want of better
acquaintance with the two latter, before the first two hundred pages of our
history were printed off. Many other records have also been serviceable; and I
would now retunr my public thanks to the several gentlemen who are keepers of
them, for the candid and kind treatment they have shown on this occasion. A
great variety of other manuscripts have been servicable to me, whereof Mr.
Hubbard's history, and extracts from governor Winthrop's journal are not the
least. It is to be noted, that only the word Hubbard in the following
quotations refers to that history, in distinction from another valuable
collection, of which take the following account. Mr. Samuel Hubbard came over
to Salem in 1633, in his youth; joined to Watertown church in 1635; but went
the same year up to Windfor, where he soon married a churchmember that removed
from Dorchester, and they settled at Weathersfield; till in May 1639 they
removed to Springfield, and he was one of the five men who first joined in
founding that church. It was constituted under Connectient government, but
falling afterward into the Massachusetts, he removed in 1647 to Fairfield.
Though he says, "God having enlightened both* but mostly my wife, into his holy
ordinance of baptizing only visible believers; and being zealous for it, she
was mostly struck at, and answered twice publicly, where I was also said to be
as bad as she, and threatened with imprisonment to Hartford goal, if we did not
renounce it or remove. That scripture came into our minds, if they persecute
you in one place, slay to another." Whereupon they removed to Newport, and
joined to elder Clarke's church there on Nov. 3. 1648, where they lived to old
age; from whence he repeatedly visited his suffering brethren at Boston, and
had an extensive correspondance both in Europe and America; and he copied
several hundred of his own and other letters into a book, which I am now
favored with; containing a fund of intelligence, from 1641 to 1688. The
writings and papers also of our elders, Holmes, Comer, Callander and others
have been useful in this design. Though, for want of room I have been forced to
leave a great many valuable articles out of this volume, and to give but a
sketch of things in latter times. However I propose by divine leave to preserve
and digest them in the best manner I can, for the use of these who may come
after us; and should be glad to obtain accounts of the rise, progress and
present state of all our churches, for the same end.

IN the following work, Plymouth Register intends an account of their church
from its beginning, wrote by our county register, and annexed to Mr. Robbin's
ordination sermon 1760. The history of Providence means what was published of
that nature in their Gazette in 1765. Perhaps the rest of my authorities are
sufficiently described. So great a part of this history is given in the words
of others, that continued marks of quotation would have been tedious; therefore
many passages only begin and end therewith. In the excellent letter you have in
page 390 -- 395, I have marked the words which were necessarily supplied to
complete the sense; but though I have as strictly kept to the true sense in all
my quotations as in that, yet I have not thought it necessary to continue such
m^^ks in all. In the dates, where our fathers began the year with March, I have
either plainly noted it, or else have begun the year with January, only have
let the old style stand, till it was altered here by law. Of the moneys, Mr.
Prince says their recknoned were sterling. till 1640. In 1652 when they first
coined silver here 1 l. of it was 15 s. sterling. and so it continued to 1690,
when they began to make paper money, which gradually depreciated from 6 s. to
45 s for a Spanish milled dollar. In 1750 our currancy was brought back to what
is was a hundred years before, and that is our lawful money ever since. A dash
-- in a quotation signifies the omission of something there for bervities sake;
betwixt figures, it is to extend the reference from one number to the other.

WHOEVER considers the difficulty of compiling such a work with exactness,
together with (...) confusion of the present times, and the authors instance
from the press, will not be severe upon him for every imperfection they may
discover therein; though he has named his principle vouchers, on purpose to have
his performance thoroughly examined, and every material mistake corrected,
Sincerity and impartiallity are allowed to be the most essential rules of
history: how far they appear in this the reader will judge. Only the author
must say, that he has acted under a full belief, that with what measure we
mete, it shall be measured to us again; so that we cannot injure others in any
case, without therein wronging our own souls. And to impress this great truth
upon every mind, is the aim and carnest desire of their humble servant,

A HISTORY OF NEW ENGLAND, With particular Reference to the People called
Baptists.
CHAP.I. The Sentiments and Character of the first Planters of this Country,
with their Proceedings down to the Year 1634.
TO obtain clear and just ideas of the affairs of the Baptists in New England,
it seems necessary for us to look back to its first settlement, and carefully
to examine what were the sentiments and character of the original planters.
Those that began the first colony were called Separatists, because of their
withdraw from the national church of England; and different parties have
accused them with rigidness therein; but ingenuous minds will not choose to be
turned off with hard names, without knowing what is meant by them, therefore
let us hear those fathers tell their own story. They separated from the
national church near the beginning of th last century, and formed societies for
worship by themselves; till, after suffering much from the ruling party in
their native country, they left it, and sojourned about twelve years in
Holland, and then removed to this land.

ABOUT the time of their steeing into Holland, Mr. Richard Bernard, an
Episcopal minister in Nottinghamshire, out of which many of those fathers
removed, published a book against them, which he called The Separatist's
Schism. unto which Mr. John Robinson, the pastor of the church which afterward
began the settlement of New England, published an answer in 1610, entitled, A
Justification of Separation from the Church of England. As I am favored with
this performance, containing 476 pages in quarto, I shall from thence give the
reader his own words upon the most material points of their controversy, and
the rather, because the writings of that eminent father of our country are very
little known at this day among us.

MR. Bernard began his book with some things which he called Christian Counsels
of Peace, to which Mr. Robinson answers, that, "As God is the God of peace, so
are not they God's children which desire it not; yea, even in the midst of
their contentions. But as all vices use to cloth themselves with the habits of
virtues, that under their liveries they may get countenance, and find the more
free passage in the world, so especially in the church all tyranny and
confusion do present themselves under this color, taking up the politic
pretense of peace, as a weapon of mere advantage, wherewith the stronger and
greater party uses to beat the weaker. The Papists press the Protestants with
the peace fo the church, and for the rent they have made in it, condemn them
beyond the heathenish soldiers, which forbore to divide Christ's garments; as
deeply do the bishops charge the ministers refusing conformity and subscription
The main of those who afterward settled the Massachusetts colony were of this
sort; they refused full conformity to the national church, and yet condemned an
entire separation from it.
, and both of them us. But the godly wise must not be affrighted either from
seeking or embracing the truth with such bugs as these are, but seeing the
wisdom which is fom above, is first pure, then peaceable, he must make it a
great part of his Christain wisdom to discern betwixt godly and gracious peace,
and that which is either pretended for advantage, or mistaken by error, and so
labor to hold peace in purity. Let it then be manifested unto us, that the
communion which the church of England has with all the wicked in the land,
without separation, is a pure communion; that their service book, devised and
prescribed in so many words and letters, to be read over and over with all the
appurtenances, is a pure worship; that their government by national provincial
and diocesan bishops, according to their canons, is a pure government, and then
let us be blamed if we hold not peace with them in word and deed; otherwise,
though they speak unto us never so often, both by messengers and mouth of peace,
and again of peace, as Jehoram did to Jehu, yet must we answer them in effect
as Jehu did Jehoram, what peace, whilst the whoredoms of the mother of
fornications, the Jezebel of Rome, do remain in so great number amongst them?
And I doubt not but Mr. Bernard, and a thousand more ministers in the land
(were they secure of the magistrate's sword, and might they go on with good
license) would wholly shake off their canonical obedience to their ordinaries,
and neglect their citations and censures, and refuse to sue in their counts,
for all the peace of the church which they commend to us for so sacred a thing.
Could they but obtain license from the magistrate to use the liberties which
they are persuaded Christ has given them, they would soon shake off the
prelates yoke, and draw no longer under the same in spiritual communion with
all the profane in the land, but would break those bonds of iniquity, as
easily as Sampson did the cords wherewith Dalilah tied him, and give good
reasons also from the word of God for their so doing." p. 13, 14.

WHOEVER reads and well observes the history of the Massachusetts colony, I
believe, will find that those remarks were neither ^^thusiastical nor
censorious, but that they discover great knowledge, and a good judgment both in
human and divine concernments. Mr. Robinson proceeds and says, "These things I
thought good to commend to the reader, that he may be the more cautious of this
and the like colorable pretenses, wishing him also well to remember, that
peace in disobedience is that old theme of the false prophets, whereby they
flattered the mighty, and deceived the simple, Jer. vi. 14, and viii. 11. -- In
the church of England we do acknowledge many excellent truths of doctrine,
which we also teach without commixture of error, many christian ordinances
which we also practice being purged from the pollution of antichrist, and for
the godly persons in it (could we possibly separate them with both arms; but
being taught by the apostle, speaking but of one wicked person, and of one
Jewish ordinance, that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, 1 Cor. v. 6,
Gal. v. 2 -- 9, we cannot be ignorant how sour the English assemblies must
needs be: Neither may we justly be blamed though we dare not dip in their meal,
lest we be soured by their leaven." p. 15, 16. And to Mr. B. who counsels that
we should bear with lighter faults for a time, till fit occasion be offered to
have them amended, he replies, "1. No sin is light in itself, but being
continued in and countenanced, destroys the sinner, Matt. v. 19. 2. It is the
property of a profane and hardened heart evermore to extenuate and lessen
sins. 3. Though the bearing and forbearing, not only of small but even of great
sins also, must be for a time, yet it must be but for a time, and that is
whilst reformation be orderly sought and procured, Lev. xix. 17. But what time
has wrought in the church of England, all men see growing daily, by the just
judgment of God, from evil to worse, and being never aforetime so impatient
either of reformation or other good as at this day. 4. A man must so bear evil,
as he be no way accessory unto it, by forbearing any means appointed by Christ
for the amending it." p. 16.

"I SEE not upon what occasion the author should shuffle into this controversy,
which is merely ecclesiastical, such considerations as he does concerning the
frame and alteration of civil states, except he would either insinuate against
us, that we went about to alter the civil state of the kingdom; or, at least,
that the alteration of the state ecclesiastical, must needs draw with it the
alteration of the civil state; with which note the prelates have a long time
bleared the eyes of the magistrates, but how deceitfully, has been
sufficiently manifested, and offer made further to manifest the same by solemn
disputation. And the truth is, that all states and policies which are of God,
whether monarchical, aristocratical or democratical, or how mixed soever, are
capable of Christ's government. Neither does the nature of the state, but the
corruption of the persons, hinder the same in one or other. -- And where Mr.
Bernard further advises, rather to offend many private persons than one lawful
magistrate, I doubt not he gives no worse counsel than he himself follows, who
(except I be much deceived in him) had rather offend half the private persons
in the diocese, than one archbishop, though he be an unlawful magistrate. But
let us remember our care be not to offend the Lord, and if with the offense of
a private person, though never so base, be joined the offense of the Lord,
better offend all, both lawful and unlawful magistrates, in the world, than
such a little one, Matt. xviii. 6." p. 17, 18.

ANOTHER piece of counsel given by Mr. B. is, Use the present good which thou
may enjoy to the utmost; and an experienced good, before thou do trouble
thyself to seek for a supposed better good, untried, which thou enjoyest not.
To this Mr. R. says, "We may not stint or circumscribe either our knowledge,
faith, or obedience, within straiter bounds than the whole revealed will of
God, in the knowledge and obedience whereof we must daily increase and edify
ourselves; much less must we suffer ourselves to be stripped of any liberty
which Christ our lord has purchased for us, and given us to use for our good,
Gal. v. 1. And here, as I take it, comes in the case of many hundreds in the
church of England, who what good they may enjoy (that is safely enjoy, or
without any great bodily danger) that they use very fully. Where the ways of
Christ lie open for them, by the authority of men, and where they may walk
safely with good leave, there they walk very uprightly, and that a round pace;
but when the commandments of Christ are as it were hedged up with thorns, by
men's prohibitions, there they foully step aside, and pitch their tents by the
flocks of his fellows, Cant. i. 6." p. 23. Again Mr. B. says, Never presume to
reform others, before thou have well ordered thyself. To which Mr. Robinson
answers, "True zeal it is certain ever begins at home, and gives more liberty
unto other men than it dares assume unto itself; and there is nothing more
true, and necessary to be considered, than that every man ought to order
himself in his own steps first. That is good and the best, but not all; for if
by God's commandment we ought to bring back our enemy's ox or ass that
strayeth, how much more to bring into order our brother's soul and body,
wandering in bypath?" p. 24.

MR. Bernard went on to lay down a number of things, which he supposed would
render it very unlikely that a separation from them could be right, before he
came to the merits of the cause; as 1. The novelty thereof differing from all
the best reformed churches in Christendom. To which Mr. Robinson replies, "It
is no novelty to hear men plead custom, when they want truth. So the heathen
philosopher reproached Paul as a bringer of new doctrine, Act. xvii. 19. So do
the Papists discountenance the doctrine and profession of the church of
England; yea even at this day, very many of the people in the land call Popery
the old law, and the profession there made the new law. But for our parts, as
we believe, by the word of God, that the things we teach are not new, but old
truths renewed; so are we no less persuaded, that the church constitution, in
which we are set, is cast in the apostolical and primitive mould, and not one
day nor hour younger, in the nature and form of it, than the first church of
the new testament." p. 40. 2. For that it agreeeth so much with the ancient
Schismatics, condemned in former ages by holy and learned men. Answer, "Can our
way both be a novelty, and yet agree so well with ancient Schismatics?
Contraries cannot be both true, but may both be false, as these are." p. 42.
Mr. Robinson tells us, that another article which Mr. B. alleged against them
is, That we have not the approbation of any of the reformed churches for our
course. Answer, "This is the same in substance with the first, and that which
follows in the next place the same with them both; and Mr. B. by so
ordinarily pressing us with human testimonies, shows himself to be very barren
of divine authority. Nature teaches every creature, in all danger, to fly
first and oftenest to the chief instruments either of offense or defense,
wherein it trusts, as the bull to his horn, the boar to his tusk, and the
bird unto her wing; right so this man shows wherein his strength lies, and
wherein he trusts most, by so frequent and usual shaking the horn, and whetting
the tusk, of mortal man's authority against us. But for the reformed churches
the truth is, they neither do imagine, nor will easily be brought to believe,
that the frame of the church of England stands as it does. The approbation
which they give, is in respect of such general truths of doctrine, as wherein
we also, for the most part, acknowledge you; which notwithstanding you deny in
a great measure in the particulars and practice. But touching the gathering and
governing of the church, which are the main heads controverted betwixt you and
us; they give you not so much as the left hand of fellowship, but do, on the
contrary, turn their backs upon you." p. 46, 47 "The ways of the church of
England, wherein we forsake her, do directly and ex diametro cross and thwart
the ways of the reformed churches, in these three main heads: "1. Thereformed
churches are gathered of a free people, joined together by voluntary
profession, without compulsion of human laws. On the contrary, the church of
England consists of a people forced together violently by the laws of men into
their provincial, diocesan and parishional churches (as their houses stand) be
they never so unwilling or unfit. "2. The reformed churches do renounce the
ministry of the church of England, as she does theirs; not admitting of any by
virtue of it to charge of souls, as they speak, where, on the contrary, all the
mass-priests made in Queen Mary's days, which would say their book-service in
English, were continued ministers by the same ordination which they received
from Popish prelates. "3. The government by Archbishops, Lord Bishops and their
substitutes, in the church of England, is abhorred and disclaimed in the
reformed churches as antichristian; as is, on the contrary, the Presbyterian
government, in use there, by the church of England refused, as Anabaptistical
and seditious." p. 52.


Here we may see how the very name of Anabaptist was used as a weapon to fight
against reformation in Mr. Robinson's day, and the practice is still followed
by many.


. Thus much of the learned abroad; in the next place Mr. Bernard draws us to
the learned at home, from whose dislike of us he takes his fifth likelihood,
which he thus frames: The condemnation of this way by our divines, both living
and dead, against whom, either for godliness of life or truth of doctrine,
otherwise than for being their opposites, they can take no exception." To which
Mr. Robinson answers, "No marvel: We may not admit of parties for judges: How
is it possible we should be approved of them in the things wherein we witness
against them? And if this argument be good and likely, then is it likely that
neither the Reformists have the truth in the church of England, nor the
prelates; for there are many of those both godly and learned, which in their
differences do oppose, and that very vehemently, the one the other. Now, as for
my own part, I do willingly acknowledge the learning and godliness of most of
the persons named by Mr. B. and honor the memory of some of them; so neither do
I think them so learned, but they might err, nor so godly, but in their error
they might reproach the truth they saw not. I do confess to the glory of God,
and mine own shame, that a long time before I entered this way, I took some
taste of the truth in it by some treatises published in justification of it,
which were sweet as honey unto my mouth; and the principal thing which for the
time quenched all further appetite in me, was the over-valuation which I made
of the learning and holiness of these and the like persons, blushing in myself
to have a thought of pressing one hairbreadth before them in this thing, behind
whom I knew myself to come so many miles in all other things; yea and even of
late times, when I had entered into a more serious consideration of these
things, and, according to the measure of grace received, searched the
scriptures, whether they were so or no, and by searching found much light and
truth, yet was the same so dimmed and overclouded with the contradictions of
these men, and others of the like note, that had not the truth been in my heart
as a burning fire shut up in my bones, Jer. xx. 9, I had never broken those
bonds of flesh and blood, but had suffered the light of God to have been put
out in my unthankful heart, by other men's darkness.

"EVERY man stands bound to give this reverence to the graces of God in other
men, that in his differences with them he be not suddenly nor easily persuaded,
but that being jealous of his own heart, he undertake the examination of
things, and so proceed with fear and trembling, and having tried all things,
keep that which is good, 1 These. v. 21; so shall he neither wrong the graces of
God in himself, nor in others. But on the other side, for a man so far to
suffer his thoughts to be conjured into the circle of any man or men's judgment,
as either to fear to try what is offered to the contrary, in the balance of the
sanctuary, or finding it to bear weight, to fear to give sentence on the Lord's
side, yea though it be against the mighty, this is to honor men above God, and
to advance a throne above the throne of Christ, who is Lord and King for ever.
And to speak that in this case, which by doleful experience I myself have
found, many of the most forward professors in the kingdom are well nigh as
superstitiously addicted to the determinations of their guides and teachers, as
the ignorant Papists unto theirs; accounting it not only needless curiosity,
but even intolerable arrogance, to call in question the things received from
them by tradition. But how much better were it for all men to lay aside these
and the like prejudices, that so they might understand the things which concern
their peace, and seeing with their own eyes, might live by their own faith?

"AND for these famous men named by Mr. B. (with whose oppositions, as with
Zedekiah's horns of iron, he would push us here and every where) as we bear
their reproofs with patience, and acknowledge their worth without envy or
detraction, so do we know they were but men, and through human frailty might be
abused as well, or rather as ill, to support antichrist in a measure, as others
before them have been, though godly and learned as they. It will not be denied
but the fathers, as they are called, Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian,
Ambrose, Jerome, Austin, and the rest, were both godly and learned, yet no man,
if he have but even saluted them, can be ignorant what way, though unwittingly,
they made for the advancement of antichrist which followed after them, and if
they, notwithstanding their learning and godliness, thus ushered him into the
world, why might not others, and that more likely, though learned and godly as
the former, help to bear up his train? Especially considering that as his
rising was not, so neither could his fall be perfected at once. And for us,
what do we more or otherwise, for the most part, than walk in those ways into
which diverse of the persons by Mr. B. named have directed us by the word of
God, in manifesting unto us by the light thereof what the ministry, government,
worship, and fellowship of the gospel ought to be For proof of this, Mr.
Robinson, in another place, cites a number of passages written; he says, "By
such men as I dare say Mr. B. reckons amongst the painful and conscionable
ministers: Their words are these:

"The names and offices of Archbishops, Archdeacons, Lord Bishops, etc. are,
together with their government, drawn out of the Pope's shop, antichristian,
and contrary to the scriptures. Parsons, vicars, parish priests, stipendiaries,
etc. be birds of the same feather." 2d Admo. to the Parliament. "There is no
true visible church of Christ, but a particular congregation only." Christian
Offer, prop. 4.

"Every true visible church of Christ, or ordinary assembly of the faithful,
has, by Christ's ordinance, power in itself immediately under Christ to elect,
to ordain, deprive and depose their ministers, and to execute all other
ecclesiastical censures." Ibid. prop. 5. "The visible church of Christ,
wheresoever it be, has the power of binding and loosing annexed unto it, as
our savior Christ teaches, Matt. 18." Discovery of Dr. Bancraft's Slanders.
"Amongst us the holy mysteries of God a^e? profaned, the Gentiles enter into
the temple of God, the holy things are indifferently communicated with the
clean and unclean." Plain Declaration.

"Now, says Mr. Robinson, let the reader judge whether these men in thus
writing have not opened the door unto us, by which themselves enter not." p.
75, 76.


? We then being taught, and believing that the word of God is a light and
lanthorn, not only to our eyes, but to our feet and paths, as the Psalmist
speaks, Psalm. cxix. 105, cannot possibly conceive how we should justly be
blamed by these men for observing the ordinances which themselves not only
acknowledged, but contended for, as appointed by Christ to be kept inviolable
till his appearing, as some of them have expressly testified.

"To conclude, let not the christian reader cast our persons, and the persons
of our opposites, whether these or others, in the balance together; but rather
our cause and reasons, with their oppositions and the grounds of them, and so
with steady hand, and impartial eye, poize cause with cause, that so the truth
of God may not be prejudiced by men's persons, nor held in respect of them." p.
48 -- 58.

BY these free and plain declarations the reader may be able to judge, whether
the reproach of rigidness properly belongs to Mr. Robinson, or to his accusers
and persecutors; yet because he would not stay in the church of England, when
he was convinced of its being wrong so to do, Mr. Bernard accuses him and his
brethren of either denying their conversion there, or else of accounting it a
false one. To which Mr. R. answers, "For our personal conversion in the church
of England, we deny it not, but do, and always have done, judge and profess it
true there; and so was Luther's conversion true in the church of Rome, else
could not his separation from Rome have been of faith, or accepted of God." p.
69.

AND now for particular sentiments about church affairs; Mr. Robinson's
opponent had said, The word is the constitution of the church. To which he
replies, "His meaning is or should be, that the word is the ordinary means for
collecting and constituting the church of God. I grant it: But how considered?
Not the word in men's bibles alone, for then all the heretics in the world were
true churches; nor yet the word preached simply, for Paul preached the word to
the scoffing Athenians, and to the blasphemous Jews, yet I think he will not
say that either the one or the other were churches truly constituted. How then?
The word published, understood, believed and obeyed, outwardly at the least, as
the spiritual sword or axe, hewing the stones in the rock, and the trees in the
forest, and preparing them to be Lord's spiritual house. And thus much the very
places produced by Mr. B. do evidently declare.

"MATT. xxviii. 19, which is the first place, shows, that such as by preaching
of the word were made disciples, for so much the word imports, were to be
gathered into the church and baptized. Mark xvi. 15, shows the same, especially
if you add verse 16, infering that men by preaching must believe, and so
believe, as they have the promise of salvation. 2 Cor. v. 19, and xi. 2, prove
that the word of reconciliation and ministry of the gospel, believed and obeyed
to the forgiveness of sins, and to the preparation and sanctification of the
church of Christ, is the means of gathering and building up the same. Acts ii.
14, 37, 38, 41, and xvi. 32 -- 34, are of the same nature, and do prove that
sundry of the Jews at Jerusalem, by Peter's preaching, and that the gaoler's
household at Philippi, by Paul's preaching, were brought to repentance, and
faith in Christ, and so added to the church; but what will be the conclusion of
all these premises? the proposition is this: " The true apostolic churches
having a true constitution, were gathered and constituted of such men and women
as by the preaching of the gospel were made disciples, had faith and repentance
wrought in them, to the obtaining of the forgiveness of sins, and promise of
life eternal, and to sanctification and obedience." p. 89, 90.

OF baptism Mr. Robinson says, "The proper ends and uses of baptism are to
initiate the parties baptized into the church of Christ, and to consecrate them
to his service, and so to serve for badges of christianity, by which it is
distinguished from all other professions, Matt. xxviii. 19, 1 Cor. xii. 13." p.
26. "The sacrament of baptism is to be administered by Christ's appointment,
and the apostles example, only to such as are, externally, and so far as men
can judge, taught and made disciples; do receive the word gladly, Acts ii. 41;
believe and so profess, Acts viii. have received the holy ghost, Acts x. 47,
and to their seed, Acts ii. 39, 1 Cor. vii. 14." p. 92. "Baptism administered
to any others is so far from investing them with any saintship in that estate,
that it makes guilty both the giver and receiver of sacrilege, and is the
taking of God's name in vain." p. 110.

OF the Lord's supper he says, "The apostle teaches, 1 Cor. x. 16, that the
bread and wine in the supper are the communion of the body and blood of Christ,
that is, effectual pledges of our conjunction and incorporation with Christ,
and one with another: And in ver. 17, that all which eat of one bread or one
loaf, are one mystical body. This place alone, if Mr. B. and his fellow
ministers would seriously consider, and set themselves faithfully to observe,
they would rather offer their own bodies to be torn in pieces by wild beasts,
than the holy mysteries of Christ's body to be profaned as they are." p. 92.

OF the keys, Matt. xvi. 18, 19, he says, "It is granted by all sides that
Christ gave unto Peter the keys of the kingdom, that is, the power to remit and
retain sins declaratively, as they speak, as also that in what respect this
power was given to Peter, in the same respect it was, and is, given to such as
succeed Peter; but the question is, in what respect or consideration this power
spoken of was delegated to him? The Papist affirms it was given to Peter as the
prince of the apostles, and so to the Bishops of Rome, as Peter's successors,
and thus they stablish the Pope's primacy. The prelates say nay, but unto Peter
an apostle, that is, a chief officer of the church, and so to us, as chief
officers succeeding him. Others affirm it to belong to Peter here as a minister
of the word and sacraments, and the like, and so consequently to all other
ministers of the gospel equally, which succeed Peter in those and the like
administrations. But we, for our parts, do believe and profess that this
promise is not made to Peter in any of these respects, nor to any office,
order, estate, dignity or degree in the church or world, but to the confession
of faith, which Peter made by way of answer to Christ's question; Thou art
Christ, the son of the living God. To this Christ replies, Blessed art thou;
thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church; I will give unto
thee the keys, etc. So that the building of the church is upon the rock of
Peter's confession, that is, Christ whom he confessed. This faith is the
foundation of the church; against this faith the gates of hell shall not
prevail; this faith has the keys of the kingdom of heaven; what this ^aith
shall loose or bind on earth, is bound and loosed in heaven. Thus the
Protestant divines, when they deal against the Pope's supremacy, do generally
expound this scripture. Now it follows, that whatsoever person has received
the same precious faith with Peter, as all the faithful have, 2 Pet. i. 1, that
person has a part in this gift of Christ. Whosoever does confess, publish,
manifest or make known Jesus to be the Christ, the son of the living God, and
Savior of the world, that person opens heaven's gates, loses sin, and
partakes with Peter in the use of the keys; and hereupon it follows
necessarily, that one faithful man, yea, or woman either, may as truly and
effectually loose and bind, both in heaven and earth, as all the ministers in
the world." p. 149, 150.

"BUT here I know the lordly clergy, like the bulls of Bashan, will roar loud
upon me, as speaking things intolerably derogatory to the dignity of
priesthood; and it may be some others also, either through ignorance or
superstition, will take offense at this speech, as confounding all things; but
there is no such cause of exception. For howsoever the keys be one and the same
in nature and efficacy, in what faithful man or men's hands soever, as not
depending either upon the number or excellency of any persons, but upon Christ
alone; yet is it ever to be remembered, that the order and manner of using them
is very different.

"THE keys in do^^ ^^e may be turned as well upon them which are without the
church, as upon them which are within, and their sins either loosed or bound,
Matt. xxviii. 19; but in discipline not so, but only upon them which are
within, 1 Cor. v. 12, 13. Again, the apostles by their office had these keys to
use in all churches, yea, in all nations upon earth: Ordinary elders for their
particular flocks, Act. xiv. 23, and xx. 28. Lastly, there is an use of the
keys publicly to be had, and an use privately; an use of them by one person
severally, and an use of them by the whole church jointly, and together; an use
of them ministerially, or in office, and an use of them out of office: But the
power of the gospel, which is the keys, is still one and the same,
notwithstanding the diverse manner of using it." p. 151.

"IF the keys of the kingdom of heaven be appropriated unto the officers, then
can there be no forgiveness of sins, nor salvation, without officers; for there
is no entrance into heaven but by the door. Without the key the door cannot be
opened: So then belike, if either there be no officers in the church (as it may
easily come to pass in some extreme plague or persecution) and must needs be in
the churches of Christ in our days, either in their first planting, or first
calling out of Babylon; for Antichrist's mass-priesthood is not essentially
Christ's true ministry, or if the officers take away the key of knowledge, as
the Scribes and Pharisees did, and will neither enter themselves nor suffer
them that would; then must the miserable multitude be content to be shut out
and perish eternally, for ought is known to the contrary. To admonish the
officers of their sin, were against common sense, that the father should be
subject to his children, the work domineer over the workman, the seedsman be
ordered by the corn, and to excommunicate and call new, were intolerable
usurpation of the keys; this power is given to the chief officers only, p. 94,
95, and to separate from them is as intolerable, p. 88 These are quotations
from Bernard.
. Miserable were the Lord's people, if these things were so; but the truth is,
they are miserable guides that so teach.

"THEY which may forgive sins and sinners, save souls, gain and turn men unto
the Lord, to them are the keys of the kingdom given, by which they open the
door unto such as they thus forgive, gain and save: But all these things, such
as are not ministers may do, as these scriptures, which I entreat the godly
reader to consider, do most clearly manifest, Matt. xviii. 15.2 Cor. v. 7 --
10. Act. viii. 1, 4. with xi. 19 -- 21. Jam. v. 19, 20.1 Pet. iii. 1. Jude
xxii. 23. Erroneous, therefore, and derogatory is it to the nature of the
gospel, and free donation of Christ, thus to impropriate and engross the keys,
which lie common to all christians in their place and order." p. 152, 153.

CONCERNING ordination Mr. Robinson observes, "That the officers of the church
are the servants of the church; and their office a serice of the Lord, and of
his church, Matt. x 25, 26, 27.2 Cor. iv. 5. Romans xv. 31. Whereupon it
follows necessarily, that what power the officers have, the body of the
church has first." p. 411. "To these things I add, that what power any of the
Pope's clergy receive from him, the same he takes from them, and deprives them
of, where they withdraw their obedience, or separate from that church. For our
better proceeding, I will first consider what ordination is; and secondly how
far the brethren may go by the scriptures, and the necessary consequences drawn
from them, in this and the like cases, in the first planting of churches, or in
reducing of them into order, in or after some general confusion. The prelates,
and those which level by their line, highly advance ordination far above the
administration of the word, sacrament and prayer; making it, and the power of
excommunication, the two incommunicable prerogatives of a Bishop above an
ordinary minister. But surely herein these chief ministers do not succeed the
chief ministers, the apostles, except as darkness succeeds light, and
Antichrist's confusion Christ's order. Where the apostles were sent out by
Christ, there was no mention of ordination; their charge was, go teach all
nations, and baptize them; and that the apostles accounted preaching their
principal work, and after it baptism and prayer, the scriptures manifest, Act.
vi. 4, 1 Cor. 1.17." p. 412.

"ORDINATION does depend upon the people's lawful election, as an effect upon
the cause, by virtue of which it is justly administered, and may be thus
described, or considered of us; as the admission of or putting into possession
a person lawfully elected into a true office of ministry. -- The right unto
their office they have by election, the possession by ordination, with the
ceremony of imposition of hands, The apostle Peter, advertising the disciples
or brethren that one (fitted as there noted) was in the room of Judas to be
made a witness, with the eleven apostles, of the resurrection of Christ, when
two were by them presented, did with the rest present them two and none other
to the Lord, that he, by the immediate direction of the lot, might show whether
of them two he had chosen, Act. i. -- In like manner the twelve being to
institute the office of deaconry in the church at Jerusalem, called the
multitude of the disciples together, and informed them what manner of persons
they were to choose; which choice being made by the brethren accordingly, and
they so chosen presented to the apostles, they forthwith ordained them, by
virtue of the election made by the brethren. To these add, that the apostles,
Paul and Barnabas (being thereunto called by the holy ghost) did pass from
church to church, and from place to place, and in every church where they came
did ordain them elders by the people's election, signified by their lifting up
of hands, as the word is, and as the use was in popular elections, throughout
those countries, Act. xiii. 2, and xiv. 23. -- The judgment and plea (when they
deal with us) of the most forward men in the land, in this case, I may not
omit; which is, that they renounce and disclaim their ordination by the
prelates, and hold their ministry by the people's acceptance. Now if the
acceptance of a mixed company, under the prelates government (as is the best
parish assembly in the kingdom) whereof the greatest part have by the revealed
will of God no right to the covenant, ministry, or other holy things, be
sufficient to make a minister, then much more the acceptance of the people
with us, being all of them jointly, and every one of them severally, by the
mercy of God, capable of the Lord's ordinances Mr. Robinson gives us a number
of the Protestant's testimonies upon this point, of which take the following:
"Gall. i. 8. If any teach another gospel, let him be anathema. Only the
assembly where the true doctrine sounds is the church: In it is the ministry
of the gospel: In it are the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Wherefore in that
very assembly there is the right of calling and ordaining the ministers of the
gospel, because we must fly the enemies of the gospel, as anathema. And
besides, if we should desire of them the ceremony of ordination, they would not
give it, except we would bind ourselves to renounce the true doctrine, and
other wicked bonds would they cast upon us. It is the confusion of order, to
seek shepherds from the wolves. This has ever been the right of the true
church, to choose and call out of her own assembly sit ministers of the gospel.

Philip Melancton. "In the planting of churches anew, when men are wanting,
which should preach the gospel, a woman may perform that at the first; but so
as when she has taught any company, that some one man of the faithful be
ordained, which may afterward minister the sacraments, teach, and do the
pastor's duty faithfully.

Peter Martyr. "Tilenus being demanded of the Earl of Lavall, from whom Calvin
had his calling? answered, From the church of Geneva, and from Farrell, his
predecessor; who also had his from the people of Geneva; who had right and
authority to institute and depose ministers: Which thing he also confirms by
Cyp^^an, Epist. xiv.

p. 421, 422.

These were the sentiments of those who knew how they came out of Rome, and
upon what grounds the Protestant churches were formed, but how differently are
things represented by aspiring men at this day?


. I acknowledge that where there are already lawful officers in a church, by
and to which others are called, there the former, upon that election, are to
ordain and appoint the latter. The officers, being the ministers of the church,
are to execute the determinations of the church under the Lord -- Ordination is
properly the execution of election." p. 413 -- 15.

"THE apostle Paul writes to the churches of Galatia to reject, as accursed,
such ministers whomsoever as should preach otherwise than they had already
received: And the same apostle writes to the church of Colosse, to admonish
Archippus to take heed to his ministry. So John also, to the church of Ephesus,
commends it for examining, and so consequently for silencing, such as
pretended themselves apostles, and were not: As also to the church of Thiatyra,
reproving for suffering unsilenced the false prophetess Jezebel. Now as these
things did first and principally concern the officers, who were in these and
all other things of the same nature to go before and govern the people; so are
the people also in their places interested in the same business and charge:
Neither could the officers sin (if they should have been corrupt or negligent)
discharge the people of their duty in the things which concerned them; but they
were bound notwithstanding to see the commandments of the apostles, and of the
Lord Jesus by them, executed accordingly. And if the people be in cases, and
when their officers fail, thus solemnly to examine, admonish, silence, and
suppress their teachers, being faulty and unsound; then are they also by
proportion, where officers fail, to elect, appoint, set up and over themselves
such fit persons as the Lord affords them, for their furtherance of faith and
salvation." p. 417, 418.

AGAINST this doctrine many objections have been raised; the chief of which are
about the people's instability, and its tendency to confusion. In answer to
which, Mr. Robinson reminds his opponant, that though his ignorant people had
readily changed their religion with their Prince, even back to Popery in Mary's
days; yet, "The prelates and priests were as unstable as the rest, yea their
ringleaders. But, says he, for experience in this our popularity, as you term
it, I tell you, that if ever I saw the beauty of Sion, and the glory of the
Lord filling his tabernacle, it has been in the manifestation of the diverse
graces of God in the church, in that heavenly harmony, and comely order,
wherein by the grace of God we are set and walk; wherein, if your eyes had but
seen the brethren's sober and modest carriage one toward another, their humble
and willing submission unto their guides in the Lord, their tender compassion
toward the weak, their fervent zeal against scandalous offenders, and their
long-suffering toward all, you would, I am persuaded, change your mind, and be
compelled to take up your parable, and bless where you purposed to curse." p.
212. "For mine own part, knowing mine own infirmities, and that I am subject to
sin, yea and to frowardness in sin, as much as the brethren are; if by mine
office I should be deprived of the remedy which they enjoy, that blessed
ordinance of the churches censures, I should think mine office accursed, and
myself by it, as frustrating and disappointing me of that main end for which
the servants of Christ ought to join themselves unto the church of Christ,
furnished with his power for their reformation. As, on the contrary, God is my
record, how, in the very writing of these things, my soul is filled with
spiritual joy, that I am under this easy yoke of Christ, the censures of the
church, and how much I am comforted in this consideration, against my vile and
corrupt nature, which, notwithstanding, I am persuaded the Lord will never so
far suffer to rebel, as that it shall not be tamed and subdued by this strong
hand of God, without which it might every day and hour so hazard my salvation.
That doctrine which advances an inferior and meaner state in the church, above
that which is superior and the chief, that is unsound, and indeed serving in a
degree for the exaltation of that man of sin above all that is called God. But
the doctrine of setting the elders without and above the judgments and censures
of the church, does advance an inferior above a superior. The point I thus
manifest:

"THE order of kings is the highest order or estate in the church. But the
order of saints is the order of kings, and we are kings as we are saints, not
as we are officers. As the Lord Jesus did prove against the Scribes and
Pharisees, that the temple was greater than the gold, because it sanctified the
gold, and that the altar was greater than the offering, because it sanctified
the offering, so by proportion the condition of a saint, which sanctifies the
condition of an officer, is more excellent than it is, To our saintship, and as
we have faith, is promised the forgiveness of sins, the favor of God, and life
eternal, but not to our office, or in respect of it. The estate of a saint is
most happy and blessed, though the person never so much as come near an office;
but on the contrary, an officer, if he be not also and FIRST a saint, is a most
wretched and accursed creature." p. 216, 217.

THE reader will not wonder that those who were for national churches; and
unconverted ministers, discovered a strong prejudice against such writings as
these; but how well do they agree with the apostles doctrine? 1 Cor. xii. 31,
and xiii. 1 -- 3, Gal. i.

OF REFORMATION, Mr. Robinson says to his opponent, "You speak much of the
reformation of your church after Popery. There was indeed a great reformation
of things in your church; but very little o^ the church, to speak truly and
properly. The people are the church; and to make a reformed church, there must
be first a reformed people; and so they should have been with you, by the
preaching of repentance from dead works, and faith in Christ; that the people,
as the Lord should have vouchsafed grace, being first fitted for, and made
capable of, the sacraments, and other ordinances, might afterward have
communicated in the pure use of them; for want of which, instead of a pure use,
there has been, and is at this day, a most profane abuse of them, to the
great dishonor of Christ and his gospel, and to the hardening of thousands in
their impenitency. Others also endeavoring yet a further reformation, have
sued and do sue to Kings, and Queens, and Parliaments, for the rooting out of
the prelacy, and with it, of such other evil fruits as grow from that bitter
root; and on the contrary, to have the ministry, government and discipline of
Christ set over the parishes as they stand; the first fruit of which
reformation, if it were obtained, would be the profanation of the more of
God's ordinances upon such, as to whom they appertained not; and so the further
provocation of his Majesty unto anger against all such as so practiced, or
consented thereunto. Is it not strange that men, in the reforming of a church,
should almost, or altogether, forget the church, which is the people, or that
they should labor to crown Christ a King over a people, whose prophet he has
not first been? Or to set him to rule by his laws and officers, over the
professed subjects of Antichrist and the devil! Is it possible that ever they
should submit to the discipline of Christ, which have not first been prepared,
in some measure, by his holy doctrine, and taught with meekness to stoop unto
his yoke?" p. 300, 301.

A MAIN plea for such confusion, both then and now, was and is drawn from the
parable of the tares: But, says Mr. Robinson, "Since the Lord Jesus, who best
knew his own meaning, calls the field the world, and makes the harvest, which
is the end of the field, the end of the world, and not of the church, why
should we admit of any other interpretation? Neither is it like that Christ
would in the expounding of one parable speak another, as he should have done,
if, in calling the field the world, he had meant the church. As God then in the
beginning made man good, and placed him in the field of the world, there to
grow, where by the envy of the serpent he was soon corrupted, so ever since
has the seed of the serpent, stirred up by their father the devil, snarled at
the heal of the woman's seed, and like noisome tares vexed and pestered the
good and holy seed; which though the children of God both see and feel to their
pain, yet must they not therefore, forgetting what spirit they are of,
presently call for fire from heaven, nor prevent the Lord's hand, but wait his
leisure, either for the converting of these tares into wheat, which in many is
daily seen, and then how great pity had it been they should so untimely have
been plucked up? Or for their final perdition in the day of the Lord, when the
church shall be no more offended by them. And that the Lord Jesus no way speaks
of the toleration of profane persons in the church, does appear by these
reasons: 1. BECAUSE he does not contradict himself, by forbidding the use of
the keys in one place, which in another he has turned upon impenitent
offenders, Matt. xviii. 2. In the excommunication of sinners apparently
obstinate, with due circumspection, and in the spirit of wisdom, meekness, and
long-suffering, with such other general christian virtues, as with which all
our special sacrifices ought to be seasoned, what danger can there be of any
such disorder, as the plucking up of the wheat with the tares, which the
husbandman fears? 3. The Lord Jesus speaks of the utter ruinating and
destruction of the tares -- the plucking them up by the roots: -- But
excommunication rightly administered is not for the ruin and destruction of any,
but for the salvation of the party thereby humbled, 1 Cor. v. 5. -- The Lord's
field is sown only with good seed -- his church saints beloved of God, all and
every one of them, though by the malice of Satan, and negligence of such as
should keep this field, vineyard and house of God, adulterated seed, and
abominable persons, may be foisted in, yea and suffered also." p. 119, 120. "I
deny not but, as it has been said of old, there are many sheep without, and
many wolves within; many of the visible church which are not of the invisible
church, and many of the invisible church which never come into the visible
church: But this, say I, is not according to the revealed will of God in his
word; but by men's default and sin. It is their sin of ignorance, or infirmity,
which, being of the invisible church, do not, if possibly they can, join
themselves unto the visible church, there to partake in the visible ordinances.
It is their sin of hypocrisy and presumption, which not being of the invisible
church, do adjoin themselves to the visible church, there to profane the
Lord's covenant and ordinances, to which they have no right. For how can they,
being wicked and unholy, challenge the Lord to be their God, that is, all
happiness and goodness unto them, which is one part of the covenant; or profess
themselves to be his people, which is another part, when the devil and their
lusts is their God?" p. 313, 314.


Of the Difference between Civil and Ecclesiastical Government.

"1. CIVIL officers are called in the word of God princes, beads, captains,
judges, magistrates, nobles, lords, kings, them in authority, principalities
and powers, yea in their respect Gods; and according to their names so are
their offices: But on the contrary, ecclesiastical officers are not capable of
these, or the like titles, which can neither be given without flattery unto
them, nor received by them without arrogance: Neither is their office an office
of lordship, sovereignty or authority, but of labor and service, and so they,
the laborers and servants of the church, as of God, 2 Cor. iv. 5, 1 Timothy iii.
1.

"2. MAGISTRATES may publish and execute their own laws in their own names,
Ezra i. 1, etc. Esther viii. 8, Matt. xx. 25. But ministers are only
interpreters of the laws of God, and must look for no further respect at the
hands of any to the things they speak, than as they manifest the same to be the
commandments of the Lord, 1 Cor. xiv. 37.

"3. CIVIL administrations, and their forms of government, may be and often times
are altered, for the avoiding of inconveniences, according to the circumstances
of time, place and persons, Exodus xviii. 13, etc. But the church is a kingdom
which cannot be shaken, Heb. xii. 28, wherein may be no innovation in office,
or form of administration, from that which Christ has left, for any
inconveniency whatsoever.

"4. CIVIL magistrates have authority by their offices to judge offenders, upon
whom also they may execute bodily vengeance, using their people as their
servants and ministers for the same purpose; but in the church the officers are
the ministers of the people, whose service the people is to use for the
administering of the judgments of the church, and of God first, against the
obstinate, which is the utmost execution the church can perform. -- But here it
will be demanded of me, if the elders be not set over the church for her
guidance and government? Yes certainly, as the physician is set over the body,
for his skill and faithfulness, to minister unto it, to whom the patient,
though his lord and master, is to submit; the lawyer over his cause, to attend
unto it; the steward over his family, even his wife and children, to make
provision for them: Yea, the watchman over the whole city, for the safe keeping
thereof. Such, and none other, is the elder's or Bishop's government" p. 135 --
137.

BUT, says Mr. Robinson, "What sway authority has in the ^^rch of England,
appears in the laws of the land, which make the government of the church
ALTERABLE at the magistrate's pleasure; and so the clergy, in their submission
to King Henry VIII. do derive, as they pretend, their ecclesiastical
jurisdiction from him, and so execute it. Indeed many of the late Bishops and
their proctors, seeing how monstrous the ministration is of DIVINE things, by
an human authority and calling; and growing bold upon the present disposition
of the magistrate, have disclaimed that former title, and do professedly hold
their ecclesiastical power and jurisdiction de jure divino, and so consequently
by God's word unalterable: Of whom I would demand this one question:

"WHAT if the King should discharge and expel the present ecclesiastical
government, and plant instead of it the presbytery or eldership, would they
submit unto the government of the elders, yea or no? If yea, then were they
traitors to the Lord Jesus, submitting to a government overthrowing his
government, as does the Presbyterian government that which is Episcopal: If no,
then how could they free themselves from such imputations of disloyalty to
Princes, and disturbance of states, as wherewith they load us and others
opposing them? But to the question itself: "As the kingdom of Christ is not of
^is world, but spiritual, and he a spiritual King, John xviii. 36, so must the
government of this spiritual kingdom under this spiritual King needs (...)
spiritual, and all the laws of it. And as Christ Jesus has, by the merits of
his priesthood, redeemed as well the body as the soul, 1 Cor. vi. 20; so is he
also by the scepter of his kingdom to rule and reign over both: Unto which
christian magistrates, as well as meaner persons, ought to submit themselves,
and the more christian they are, the more meekly to take the yoke of Christ
upon them, and the greater authority they have, the more effectually to advance
his scepter over themselves and their people, by all good means. Neither can
there be any reason given why the merits of saints may not as well be mingled
with the merits of Christ, for the saving of the church, as the laws of men
with his laws, for the ruling and guiding of it. He is as absolute and entire a
King as he is a priest, and his people must be as careful to preserve the
dignity of the one, as to enjoy the benefit of the other." p. 38.

Of Ministers Maintenance.

MR. Bernard charged his opponents with error, in holding that ministers ought
not to live of tithes, but of the people's voluntary contribution; and says,
This is against the wisdom of God, who allowed a settled maintenance under the
law; and there is nothing against it in the gospel. But in reply Mr. Robinson
says, "As the Lord appointed under the law a settled maintenance by tithes and
offerings, so did he a settled land of Canaan, which was holy, and a sacrament;
so did he also appoint that the Levites be maintained there, should have no
part nor inheritance with the rest of the Israelites their brethren. And has
God's wisdom so appointed now? If it had, I fear many would not rest in it, so
wise are they for their bellies. And where you add, that there is nothing in
the gospel against this ordinance in the law, the author to the Hebrews might
have taught you, that the law is abolished by the gospel, in the sense we speak
of; and the old testament by the new, in respect of ordinances, whereof this
was one. If it be said that tithes were in use and given by Abraham to
Melchizedech, priest of the most high God, before the law or old testament was
given by Mosed, I answer, that so was circumcision ministered and sacrifices
offered before Moses; which notwithstanding were parts of the old testament,
and assumed by Moses into the body of it, and so are abolished by the new. To
conclude this point, since tithes and offerings were appurtenances unto the
priesthood, and that the priesthood, both of Melchizedech and Levi, are
abolished in Christ, as the shadow in the substance; and that the Lord has
ordained that they which preach the gospel, should live of the gospel; we
willingly leave unto you both you priestly order and maintenance, contenting
ourselves with the people's voluntary contribution, whether it be less or more,
as the blessing of God upon our labor, the fruit of our ministry, and
declaration of their love and duty." p. 439, 440.

IN all these passages which begin and end with marks of quotation, I have
recited Mr. Rohinson's own expression, without knowingly adding a single word.
The spelling I have brought to the present times, but the language is entirely
his; and it may be questioned whether any talked a purer one in that day or
not, if there does in this. About the time of his publishing this book, and
some following years, many came to his church at Leyden from "diverse parts of
England, so that they grew a great congregation; even so as to have three
hundred communicants Prince's Chronology -- Plymouth Register
. And as the Arminian controversy caused great troubles in Holland, and
especially at Leyden, their two divinity professors being divided, Episcopius
appearing for, and Polydore against the Arminian tenets; Mr. Robinson, though
he preached thrice a week, and went through much other labor, yet went
constantly to hear them both, whereby he got well grounded in the controversy,
so that when Episcopius, about the year 1613, set forth sundry Arminian theses
at Leyden, which he would defend against all opposers. Polydore insisted upon
Mr. Robinson's engaging against him, telling him, that "Such was the ability
and expertness of the adversary, that the truth is in danger to suffer, if he
would not help them; is so importunate as at length he yields; and when the day
comes, he so defends the truth, and foils the opposer, as he put him to an
apparent nonplus in this great and public audience. The same he does a second
and a third time, upon the like occasions, which as it causes many to give
praise to God that the truth had so famous a victory; so it procures Mr.
Robinson much respect and honor from those learned men and others Prince's
Chronology, p. 36, 38.
."

SEVERAL attempts were made to plant New England from worldly motives, but they
all proved abortive. In 1607 an hundred men were sent over to Sagadahock, with
furniture to lay the foundation of a great state, and all lived through the
winter but their president; yet the next year, The "whole colony breaks up, and
returns to England, and brands the country as over cold and not habitable by
our nation, and the adventurers give over their design Ihid. p. 21 -- 25.
. Other fruitless attempts were made for a while, and then were given over. Sir
"Ferdinando Gorges and Captain Mason spent twenty thousand pounds each, in
attempts for settlement, and each of them thought it advisable to give over
their designs, and sit down with the loss. Whether Britain would have had any
colonies in America at this day, if religion had not been the grand inducement,
is doubtful Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 3.
.

THE people whose religious sentiments are described above, after long
consideration, many earnest requests to heaven for direction and help, and well
consulting matters with English friends, at last determined to come over to
this wilderness; and divine providence made them the honored instruments of
laying the foundation of this now flourishing country. In December, 1617, Mr.
Robinson and Elder Brewster wrote to the Council for Virginia, who then had the
management of these affairs, wherein they say, For your encouragement we will
not forbear "to mention these inducements. 1. We verily believe and trust the
Lord is with us; to whom and whose service we have given ourselves in many
trials, and that he will graciously prosper our endeavors according to the
simplicity of our hearts. 2. We are well weaned from the delicate milk of our
mother country, and inured to the difficulties of a strange land. 3. The people
are, for the body of them, industrious and frugal, we think we may safely say,
as any company of people in the world. 4. We are knit together as a body, in a
most strict and sacred bond and covenant of the Lord; of the violation whereof
we make great conscience, and by virtue whereof we hold ourselves strictly tied
to all care of each other's good, and of the whole. 5. It is not with us as
with other men; whom small things can discourage, or small discouragements
cause to wish ourselves at home again Prince, p. 51, 52.
."


HEREIN they were not mistaken, as will soon appear; for though contentions
among the said Council, and other things, obstructed their proceeding till
1620, and they could not then obtain any royal promise of liberty of conscience
in this country, only that the King would connive at them, and not molest them
if they carried it peaceably, Yet, casting "themselves on the care of
providence, they resolve to venture. But as the could not obtain shipping and
provision enough to carry half their company the first year, Mr. Robinson was
obliged to tarry in Holland with the larger part, while Mr. William Brewster,
their ruling elder, came over with the other. Most of their brethren came with
them from Leyden to Delph-Haven, where they spent the night in friendly,
entertaining and christian converse. And July 22, the wind being fair, they go
aboard, their friends attending them, when Mr. "Robinson falling down on his
knees, and they all with him, he with watery cheeks commends them with most
fervent prayer to God; and then with mutual embraces, and many tears, they take
their leaves, and with a prosperous gale come to Southampton, in England. July
27, 1620, Mr. Robinson wrote a letter, which was received and read to the
company at that place Prince, p. 70, 71.
; which I think worthy of a place here. The letter is as follows:

" Loving christian Friends,
"I DO heartily and in the Lord salute you, as being those with whom I am
present in my best affections, and most earnest longing after you, though I be
constrained for a while to be bodily absent from you: I say constrained; God
knowing how willingly, and much rather than otherwise, I would have born my
part with you in the first brunt, were I not by strong necessity held back for
the present. Make account of me in the mean time as a man divided in myself,
with great pain (and as natural bonds set aside) having my better part with
you; and although I doubt not, but in your godly wisdoms you both foresee and
resolve upon that which concerns your present state and condition, both
severally and jointly, yet have I thought it but my duty to add some further
spur of provocation unto them who run already, if not because you need it, yet
because I owe it in love and duty.

"AND first, as we are daily to renew our repentance with our God, especially
for our sins known, and generally for our unknown trespasses; so does the Lord
call us in a singular manner, upon occasions of such difficulty and danger as
lies upon you, to both a narrow search and careful reformation in his sight,
lest he calling to remembrance our sins forgotten by us, or unrepented of, take
advantage against us, and in judgment leave us to be swallowed up in one danger
or other; whereas, on the contrary, sin being taken away by earnest repentance,
and the pardon thereof from the Lord sealed up to a man's conscience by his
spirit, great shall be his security and peace in all dangers, sweet his
comforts in all distresses, with happy deliverance from all evil, whether in
life or death. Now next after this heavenly peace with God and our own
consciences, we are carefully to provide for peace with all men, what in us
lies, especially with our associates; and for that, watchfulness must be had,
that we neither at all ourselves do give, no, nor easily take offense being
given by others. Woe be to the world for offenses, for although it be necessary,
considering the malice of Satan and man's corruption. that offenses come, yet
woe unto the man, or woman either, by whom the offense comes, says Christ,
Matt. xviii. 7. And if offenses in the unseasonable use of things, in
themselves indifferent, be more to be feared than death itself, as the apostle
teaches, 1 Cor. ix. 15, how much more in things simply evil, in which neither
the honor of God nor love of man is thought worthy to be regarded? Neither yet
is it sufficient that we keep ourselves, by the grace of God, from giving
offenses, except withal we be armed against the taking of them, when they are
given by others; for how imperfect and lame is the work of grace in that
person, who wants charity to cover a multitude of offenses? as the scripture
speaks. Neither are you to be exhorted to this grace only upon the common
grounds of christianity, which are, that persons ready to take offense, either
want charity to cover offenses, or duly to weigh human frailties; or, lastly,
are gross though close hypocrites, as Christ our Lord teaches, Matt. vii. 1 --
3: as indeed, in my own experience, few or none have been found which sooner
give offense, than such as easily take it; neither have they ever proved sound
and profitable members in societies, who have nourished this touchy humor. But
besides these, there are diverse motives provoking you above others to great
care and conscience this way; as first, there are many of you strangers to the
persons, so to the infirmities of one another, and so stand in need of more
watchfulness this way, lest when such things fall out in men and women as you
expected not, you inordinately affected with them, which does require at your
hands much wisdom and charity for the covering and preventing of incident
offenses that way. And lastly, your intended course of civil community will
minister continual occasion of offense For several years their affairs were
managed in one common stock, but they afterward found the way of distinct
property to be much better.
, and will be as fuel for that fire, except you diligently watch it with
brotherly forbearance. And if taking offense causelessly or easily at men's
doings be so carefully to be avoided; how much more heed is to be taken that we
take not offense at God himself? Which yet we certainly do, so often as we do
murmur at his providence in our crosses, or bear impatiently such afflictions
wherewith he is pleased to visit us. Store up therefore patience against the
evil day; without which we take offense at the Lord himself in his just works.
A fourth thing there is carefully to be provided for, viz that with your common
employments, you join common affections, truly bent upon the general good,
avoiding as a deadly plague of your both common and special comforts, all
retiredness of mind for proper advantage; and all singularly affected every
manner of way, let every man repress in himself, and the whole body in each
person, as so many rebels against the common good, all private respects of
men's selves, not sorting with the general convenience. And as men are careful
not to have a new house shaken with any violence, before it be well settled,
and the parts firmly knit; so be you, I beseech you my brethren, much more
careful that the house of God, which you are and are to be, be shaken with
unnecessary novelties, or other oppositions, at the first settling thereof.

"LASTLY, whereas you are to become a body politic, using amongst yourselves
civil government, and are not furnished with special eminency above the rest,
to be chosen by you into office of government, let your wisdom and godliness
appear, not only in choosing such persons as do entirely love, and will promote
the common good; but also in yielding unto them all due honor and obedience in
their lawful administrations, not beholding in them the ordinariness of their
persons, but God's ordinance for your good; not being like the foolish
multitude, who more honor the gay coat, than either the virtuous mind of the
man, or the glorious ordinance of the Lord; but you know better things, and
that the image of the Lord's power and authority, which the magistrate bears,
is honorable, in how mean person soever; and this duty you may the more
willingly, and ought the more conscionably to perform, because you are, at
least for the present, to have them for your ordinary governors, which
yourselves shall make choice of for that work. Sundry other things of
importance I could put you in mind of, and of those before mentioned, in more
words; but I will not so far wrong your godly minds, as to think you heedless
of these things, there being also diverse amongst you so well able both to
admonish themselves and others of what concerns them. These few things
therefore, and the same in few words, I do earnestly commend to your care and
conscience, joining therein with my daily incessant prayers unto the Lord, that
he who has made the heavens and the earth, and sea, and all rivers of water,
and whose providence is over all his works, especially over all his dear
children for good, would so guide and guard you in your ways, as inwardly by
his spirit, so outwardly by the hand of his power, as that both you, and we
also for and with you, may have after matter of praising his name all the days
of your and our lives. Fare you well in him in whom you trust, and in whom I
rest, an unfeigned well-wisher to your happy success in this hopeful voyage,

JOHN ROBINSON Morton, p. 7 -- 10.
."


THIS excellent letter properly describes the sentiments, temper and rules of
conduct of the chief founders of New England; and may the same be duly regarded
to their latest posterity!

BY Dutch intrigues and other's ill conduct they were hindered long, and at
last forced to come with only one ship instead of two, which sailed from
Plymouth, in England, on September 6, and arrived in Cape-Cod harbor November
11, and at the place which they named Plymouth, in December, 1620.

AND now compare this company with that of Sagadahock. That company, who came
upon worldly designs, had an hundred men; this religious society consisted of
but one hundred and one souls, men, women, and children; the one arrived at the
place designed for settlement in August, the other not till winter had set in:
The worldly company only buried their president, and all returned the next year
to their native country again; whereas this religious people, in about five
months time, buried their Governor and full half their number, and yet with
fortitude and patience they kept their station; yea, though they were
afterward deserted and abused by some who had engaged to help them. We cannot
now form and adequate idea of what those pious planters endured, to prepare the
way for what we at this day enjoy. In the year 1623 they say, "By the time our
corn is planted, our victuals are spent; not knowing at night where to have a
bit in the morning, and have neither bread nor corn for three or four months
together; yet bear our wants with cheerfulness, and rest on providence Prince,
p. 139.
."

IT pleased God further to try their faith, by sending a great drought and heat
from the third week in May till the middle of July, which caused their corn to
wither as if it were truly dead; and a ship that they had long expected did not
arrive, but they thought they saw signs of its being wrecked on the coasts.
"The most courageous are now discouraged. Upon this the public authority set
apart a solemn day of humiliation and prayer, to seek the Lord in this
distress, who was pleased to give speedy answer, to our own and the Indians
admiration; for though in the former part of the day it was very clear and hot,
without a sign of rain, yet before the exercise is over the clouds gather, and
next morning distill such soft and gentle showers as give cause of joy and
praise to God. Their corn recovers, and soon after arrives the ship they
expected, bringing over about sixty more of their friends, and a letter from
others, wherein they say to those here Let it not be grievous to you, "that you
have been instruments to break the ice f^^ others who come after with less
difficulty: The honor shall be yours to the world's end. We bear you always in
our breasts, and our hearty affection is toward you all, as are the hearts of
hundreds more who never saw your faces, who doubtless pray for your safety as
their own Prince, p. 137 -- 140.
. Their harvest was plentiful; and above twenty years after Governor Bradford
says, Nor has "there been any general want of food among us since to this day
Ibid. p. 141.
.

MR. Robinson and many of his people were detained in Holland, till, after
about a week's illness, he died there on March 1, 1625, aged near 50 years.
Governor Bradford says, His and "our enemies had been continually plotting how
they might hinder his coming hither, but the Lord has appointed him a better
place. Mr. Prince says, His son Isaac came over to Plymouth "colony, lived to
above 90 years of age, a venerable man, whom I have often seen, and has left
male posterity in the county of Barnstable Prince, p. 159, 160.
.

THE cause why Mr. Robinson and the remaining part of his church were kept back
so long, was their inability to transport themselves, and several merchants who
had engaged in the affair deserted them, pursuing separate schemes of their
own, and sent over one company of sixty stout men, who began a plantation at
Weymouth; but soon reduced themselves to such straits that several perished,
and the rest were forced to be beholden to the charity of Plymouth people, to
keep them alive till they could get back whence they came. Another worldly
scheme was begun at Braintree, which also proved abortive, while our christian
fathers at Plymouth were enabled to keep their station. And some of the
adventurers wrote to them on December 18, 1624, and said, We are still
persuaded you are "the people that must make a plantation in those remote
places, when all others fail Ibid. p. 155.
. They were long destitute of a pastor, and yet constantly maintained divine
worship among them, of which a noted author gives this account; says he,

"To satisfy the reader, how a christian church could, in any tolerable
measure, carry on the public worship of God without suitable officers, as was
the case of those people of Plymouth, we must know that those were a serious
and religious people, that knew their own principles -- knew and were resolved
on the way of their worship, but in many years could not prevail with any to
come over to them, and undertake the office of a pastor amongst them, at least
none in whom they could with full satisfaction acquiesce, and therefore in the
mean while they were peaceably and prudently managed by the wisdom of Mr.
Brewster, a grave and serious person -- ruling elder among them. Besides also
several of his people were well gifted, and did spend part of the Lord's day in
their wonted prophesying, to which they had been accustomed by Mr. Robinson.
Those gifts while they lasted made the burden of the other defect more easily
born Hubbard. Mr. Robinson says, The disciples of Christ "did not then first
receive power to teach when they were possessed of their apostleship, but long
before they were admitted into office, as did others also besides them, without
office, as well as they, Matt. x. 5, 6, 7, Luke x. 1 -- 3, 9, 10. Answer to
Bernard, p. 148. That we call prophesying, I affirm "not to be so appropriated
to the ministry, but that others having received a gift thereunto, may and
ought to stir up the same, and to use it in the church, for edification,
exhortation and comfort, though not yet called into the office of the ministry,
Romans xii. 6, 1 Cor. xiv. 3, 1 Pet. iv. 10, 11. p. 235.
.

THE names of those first planters were, John Carver, William Bradford, Edward
Winslow, successive Governors; William Brewster, elder; Captain Miles Standish,
Robert Cushman, John Alden, Samuel Fuller, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins, and
others, each of whom have posterity remaining among us to this day. I am not
preserving from "oblivion the names of heroes, whose chief merit is the
overthrow of cities, provinces and empires; but the names of the founders of a
flourishing town and colony, if not of the whole British empire in America
Massachusetts History, vol. 2, p. 462, 463.
. Their deep poverty, and the abundance of their joy, abounded unto the riches
of their liberality, so as not only to enable them to relieve many in distress,
but also to launch out so as to help over about 35 families more of their
friends from Leyden, who were transported hither in 1629, at the charge of
their brethren here, which was cheerfully born by them, though it amounted to
above five hundred and fifty pounds sterling, besides supporting them after
their arrival for 16 or 18 months, till they had a harvest of their own, which
cost near as much more. Mean while, says Governor Bradford, "God gives us peace
and health, with contented minds, and so succeeds our labors that we have corn
sufficient, and some to spare, with other provisions: Nor had we ever any
supply from England but what we first brought with us Prince, p. 156, 201.
. The first horned cattle that they ever had here were a bull and three
heifers, which Governor Winslow brought over to Plymouth in March, 1624.

ABOUT that time, the fame of the plantation "at New-Plymouth being spread in
all the western parts of England, the Rev. Mr. White, a famous Puritan minister
of Dorchester, excites several gentlemen there to make way for another
settlement in New England Ibid. p. 144.
. This was the beginning of the Massachusetts colony; that year a few persons
who gathered at Cape-Ann, that removed the next year, and began the town of
Salem, to whom others resorted from time to time, till in the summer, 1628, Mr.
John Endicot came over to govern them; and in 1629, Mr. Francis Higginson and
Mr. Samuel Skeleton, two Nonconformist ministers, came with many others, and
formed and organized a church in that place. Upon which we may see Mr.
Robinson's words verified; for these Puritans, who had blamed him for an entire
separation from the national church, yet were no sooner settled on this side
the Atlantic, than they cast off the prelates yoke in such a manner, that when
John Brown and Samuel Brown, two of the first patentees, men of "estates, and
men of parts, attempted to set up Episcopal worship at Salem, Governor Endicot
convented them before him, where they accused "the ministers as departing from
the orders of the church of England; that they were Separatists, and would be
Anabaptists, etc. but for themselves they would hold to the orders of the
church of England. These speeches and practices were judged by the Governor and
Council to be such as tended to mutiny and faction, and the Governor "told
them, that New England was no place for such as they, and therefore sent them
back for England, at the return of the ships, the same year Morton's Memorial,
p. 84, 85.
.

BY this and many other instances we may see, that the men who drew off from
the national establishment, as soon as they were convinced that truth called
them to it, were not so severe against Dissenters from themselves, as they were
who stayed till interest and civil power would favor the cause before they
separated.

IN the year 1630, Governor Winthrop with about fifteen hundred people came
over, and planted Charlestown, Boston, Dorchester, and Watertown, and soon
formed churches in each town. Of these people Mr. Hubbard says, Intending not
"to write an apology, but an history of their practice, nothing shall here be
interposed by way of defense of their way, only to give a clear discovery of
the truth, as to matter of fact, both what it was at first, and still continues
to be. Those that came over soon after Mr. Endicot, namely Mr. Higginson and
Mr. Skeleton, Anno. 1629, walked something in an untrodden path, therefore it is
the less to be wondered at, if they went in and out; in some things complying
too much, in some too little, with those of the separation; and it may be in
some things not sufficiently attending to the order of the gospel, as
themselves thought they understood afterward. For in the beginning of things
they only accepted of one another according to some general profession of the
doctrine of the gospel, and the honest and good intentions they had one toward
another, and so by some kind of covenant soon molded themselves into a church
in every plantation where they took up their abode The covenant of the first
church in Boston was in these words: "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
in obedience to his holy will and divine ordinance, we whose names are here
underwritten, being by his most wise and good providence brought together into
this part of America, in the Bay of Massachusetts, and desirous to unite
ourselves into one congregation or church, under the Lord Jesus Christ our
head, in such sort as becomes all those whom he has redeemed and sanctified
to himself, do hereby solemnly and religiously (as in his most holy presence)
promise and bind ourselves to walk in all our ways according to the rule of the
gospel, and in all sincere conformity to his holy ordinances, and in mutual
love and respect each to other, so near as God shall give us grace.

JOHN WINTHROP. THOMAS DUDLEY, ISAAC JOHNSON. JOHN WILSON" etc. Mr. Foxcraft's
Century Sermon at Boston.

; until Mr. Cotton and Mr. Hooker came over, which was in the year 1633, who
did clear up the order and method of church government, according as they
apprehended was most consonant to the word of God. And such was the authority
they, especially Mr. Cotton, had in the hearts of the people, that whatever he
delivered in the pulpit was soon put into an order of court, if of a civil, or
set up as a practice in the church, if of an ecclesiastical concernment. After
that time, the administration of all ecclesiastical matters was tied up more
strictly than before to the rules of that which is since owned for the
Congregational way. -- The principal points wherein they differ from others may
be reduced to these four heads: 1. THE subject matter of the church, saints by
calling: Such as have not only attained the knowledge of the principles of
religion, and free from gross and open scandal, but are willing, together with
the profession of their repentance and faith in Christ, to declare their
subjection to him in his ordinances, which they account ought to be done
publicly before the Lord and his people, by an open profession of the doctrine
of the gospel, and by a personal relation of their spiritual estate, expressive
of how they were brought to the knowledge of God by faith in Christ Jesus; and
this is done either with their viva voce, or by a rehearsal thereof by the
elders in public before the church assembly, they having beforehand received
private satisfaction, the persons openly testifying their assents thereunto,
provided they do not scandalize their profession by an unchristian
conversation, in which case a profession is with them of small account. 2. IN
the constitutive form of a particular visible church, which they account ought
to be a restipulation, or mutual covenanting to walk together in their
christian communion, according to the rules of the gospel; and this they say is
best to be explicit, although they do not deny but an implicit covenant may
suffice to the being of a true church. 3. IN the quantity or extensiveness of a
particular church, concerning which they hold that no church society, of gospel
institution, ought to be of larger extent, or greater number, than may
ordinarily meet together in one place, for the enjoyment of all the same
numerical ordinances, and celebrating of all divine worship, nor ordinarily
fewer than may conveniently carry on church work. 4. THAT there is no
jurisdiction, to which as such particular churches are or ought to be subject,
be it placed in classes or synod, by way of authoritative censure, nor any
church power, extrinsical to the said church, which they ought to have
dependence upon any other sort of men for the exercise of.


"AFTER this manner have their ecclesiastical affairs been carried on ever
since the year 1633, that is, down to 1680, when Mr. Hubbard wrote his history.

HERE let it be well observed and ever remembered, that these were the main
points wherein they differed from others; and the reader is welcome to search
through all their history from that day to this, and see if he can find that
these principles, in themselves considered, ever produced any evil effects; but
this people brought two other principles with them from their native country,
in which they did not differ from others; which are, that natural birth, and
the doings of men, can bring children into the covenant of grace; and, that it
is right to enforce and support their own sentiments about religion with the
magistrate's sword. And those, let them live in England, Scotland, Rome, or
elsewhere, who reproach and condemn New England for the evils which these two
principles have produced, while they hold the same things, ought to consider
that in so doing they will be found inexcusable before our GREAT JUDGE.

THE root of a compulsive uniformity was planted at a General Court in Boston,
May 18, 1631, when it was ordered and agreed, that for the time to "come, no
man shall be admitted to the freedom of this body politic, but such as are
members of some of the churches within the limits of the same Prince's Annals,
p. 28, 29.
. This test in after times had such influence, that he who did not conform, was
deprived of "more civil privileges than a Nonconformist is deprived of by the
test in England. Both the one and the other must have occasioned much formality
and hypocrisy. The mysteries of our holy religion have been prostituted to mere
secular views and advantages Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 431.
.

IF in any instances this people carried their zeal to a greater severity than
Episcopalians have often done, let it be remembered, that the latter hold a
power in their church to decree rites and ceremonies, and so consequently a
power to abate or alter the same as occasion suits; but the fathers of the
Massachusetts held the scriptures to be their unalterable rule, and having
formed a plan which they thought was truly scriptural, Captain Johnson in 1651
said, To "them it seems unreasonable, and to savor too much of hypocrisy, that
any people should pray unto the Lord for the speedy accomplishment of his word
in the overthrow of Antichrist, and in the mean time become a patron to sinful
opinions and damnable errors that oppose the truths of Christ, admit it be but
in the bare permission of them Johnson's History, p. 206.
. Hence it appears, that it was this erroneous notion of using carnal weapons
against what they looked upon false opinions, that ought to bear the blame and
reproach of those persecutions, and not their particular religious
denomination, nor any of their zeal to promote religion by gospel means and
methods.

THAT they were not aware how unscripturally they had confounded church and
state together, appears from many facts. They were so much concerned to keep
them distinct, that in 1632 the church of Boston wrote to the elders and
brethren of the churches of Plymouth, Salem, etc. for their advice in three
questions; 1. Whether one person might be a cavil magistrate and a ruling elder
at the same time? 2. If not, then which should they lay down? 3. Whether there
might be diverse pastors in the same church?
The first was agreed by all negatively; the other two doubtful Prince's
Annals, p. 64
. In consequence of which Mr. Nowel resigned his office of ruling elder, to
which he had been ordained in the church, to hold those of a magistrate and
secretary in the state. Hubbard. On the other hand, Mr. John Doan, having been
formerly chosen to the office of deacon in the church of Plymouth, at his and
the church's request, he was freed from the office of assistant in the
commonwealth Ibid. p. 92.
.

AGAIN our late Governor says, "I suppose there had been no instance of a
marriage lawfully celebrated by a layman in England, when they left it. I
believe there was no instance of marriage by a clergyman after they arrived,
during their charter; but it was always done by a magistrate, or by persons
specially appointed for that purpose. It is difficult to assign a reason for so
sudden a change Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 144.
." I happened to observe a passage in Mr. Robinson which I suppose gives us the
true reason of that great change. Mr. Bernard had charged the Separatists with
an error, which he said they had given neither reason nor scripture for, in
holding that ministers may not celebrate marriage, nor bury the dead. To which
Mr. Robinson answers,

"IN our third petition to the King, and the fourth branch of the sixth
proposition, there are almost twenty several scriptures, and nine distinct
reasons grounded upon them, to prove, that the celebration of marriage, and
burial of the dead, are not ecclesiastical actions, appertaining to the
ministry, but civil, and so to be performed. The apostle testifies that the
scriptures, being divinely inspired, do make perfect, and fully furnished, the
man of God, or minister, to every good work of his calling. Now I suppose Mr.
B. will not be so ill advised, as to go about to prove that the celebration of
marriage, and burial of the dead, are duties prescribed by the Lord Jesus to be
done in the pastor's office, or that the scriptures lay this furniture upon the
man of God for the proper works of his office. They are then other spiritual
lords than the Lord Christ, that prescribe these duties to done by their men,
furnished by other scriptures than the divine scriptures, the Bishop's
scriptures, their canons and constitutions; whereby they are furnished indeed
with ring, service book, and other priestly implements for the business
Justification of Separation, p. 438.
. This I suppose accounts for that change in our father's conduct then; though
it is likely we are agreed in general now, that as it was an error of Popery to
call marriage a sacrament, and to limit its administration to the clergy; so on
the other hand that it was a mistake in those fathers to think that the civil
state might not as well appoint ministers to celebrate marriages as any other
persons.

THESE and many other things prove that those fathers were earnestly concerned
to frame their constitution both in church and state by divine rule; and as all
allow that nothing teaches like experience, surely they who are enabled well to
improve the experience of past ages, must find it easier now to discover the
mistakes of that day, than it was for them to do it then. Even in 1637, when a
number of Puritan ministers in England, and the famous Mr. Dod among them,
wrote to the ministers here, that it was reported that they had embraced
certain new opinions, such as "that a stinted form of prayer and set liturgy is
unlawful. That the children of godly and approved christians are not to be
baptized, until their parents be set members of some particular congregation.
That the parents themselves, though of approved piety, are not to be received
to the Lord's supper until they be admitted set members," etc. Mr. Hooker
expressed his fears of troublesome work about answering os them Massachusetts
History, vol. 1, p. 81.
; though they may appear easy to the present generation.

CHAP. II. Mr. ROGER WILLIAMS'S Sentiments and his Banishment, with other
Affairs of the Colonies, from 1634 to 1644.
MR. Hubbard tells us, that February 5, 1631, "arrived Mr. William Peirse at
Nantasket; with him came one Mr. Roger Williams, of good account in England for
a godly and zealous preacher; -- he had been some years employed in the
ministry in England It appears by his own account that he was then in the 32d
year of his age.
. Accordingly I find Mr. Williams reminding Mr. Cotton of conversation he had
with him and Mr. Hooker, while they were riding together, to and from
Sempringham. Reply to Cotton on the Bloody Tenet, p. 12.
." From whence it appears that Mr. Williams was acquainted with those two
famous men, in our mother country, and the subject of that conversation shows
that he could not then conform to the national church so far as they did.

MR. Hubbard says, "Immediately after his arrival he was called by the church
of Salem to join with Mr. Skeleton; but the Governor and Council being informed
thereof, wrote to Mr. Endicot, to desire they would forbear any further
proceeding therein, till the said Council had conferred further about it. 1.
Because he refused to join with the congregation [i. e. church] of Boston,
because they would not make a public declaration of their repentance, for
holding communion with the church of England while they lived there. 2. Because
he declared it as his opinion, that the civil magistrate might not punish any
breach of the first table; whereupon they for the present forbore proceeding
with him, which occasioned his being called to Plymouth;" where, Governor
Bradford says, "He was freely entertained, according to our poor ability, and
exercised his gifts among us; and after some time was admitted a member of the
church, and his teaching well approved; for the benefit whereof I still bless
God, and am thankful to him even for his sharpest admonitions and reproofs, so
far as they agreed with truth Prince, p. 48.
."


As the two points which were so offensive to the rulers at Boston, were the
foundation cause of their after-proceedings against Mr. Williams, and nearly
affect the history of our country to this day, they demand our close attention.
The Governor and Company of the Massachusetts colony held communion with the
national church, and reflected upon their brethren who separated from her,
while in their native island, and on their departure from it, they from on
board their chief ship wrote to those who were left behind, April 7, 1630, in
these words Which were printed in London a few days after. Neal's History of
New England, vol. 1, p. 147.
:

Reverend Fathers and Brethren,

"HOWSOEVER your charity may have met with some occasion of discouragement,
through the misrepresentation of our intentions; -- yet we desire you would be
pleased to take notice of the principles and body of our company, as those who
esteem it our honor to call the church of England, from whence we rise, our
dear mother, and cannot part from our native country, where she specially
resideth, without much sadness of heart, and many tears in our eyes; ever
acknowledging that such hope and part as we have obtained in the common
salvation, we have received in her bosom, and sucked it from her breasts: We
leave it not therefore, as loathing that milk wherewith we were nourished
there, but blessing God for the parentage and education, as members of the same
body, shall always rejoice in her good.

John WINTHROP, Governor. CHARLES FINES, GEORGE PHILIPS, RICHARD SALTONSTALL,
ISAAC JOHNSON, THOMAS DUDLEY, WILLIAM CODDINGTON," etc. Massachusetts History,
vol. 1, p. 487 -- 489.

Now as Episcopalians, down to this day, try to improve this address, as an
evidence that New England was first planted by members of their church (though
the foregoing history snews that it was not so) we may safely conclude that the
ruling party in the nation did not neglect the advantage hereby given to
strengthen themselves then in their way, which was so corrupt, that when the
Archbishop of Canterbury a little after commenced a prosecution against Mr.
Cotton, the Earl of Dorset interceded for him, till he found matters were got
to such a pass that he sent Mr. Cotton word, That "if he had been guilty of
drunkenness or uncleanness, or any such lesser fault, he could have obtained
his pardon; but inasmuch as he had been guilty of Nonconformity and Puritanism,
the crime was unpardonable; and therefore, said he, you must fly for your
safety Magnalia, b. 3, p. 19.
. And can we wonder that Mr. Williams, who came over the year after the
aforesaid address was made, should not incline to join in fellowship with the
authors of it, without some honest retraction! Yet he was not so rigid but that
he did hold occasional communion at the Lord's table in the church of Plymouth,
with Governor Winthrop, and his minister, Mr. Wilson, of Boston, October 28,
1932 Prince's Annals, p. 70.
."

MR. Williams preached at Plymouth between two and three years, and then
discerning in a leading part of the church a disagreement with some of his
sentiments, and being invited to Salem, he requested a dismission there, and
though a number were unwilling for it, yet elder Brewster prevailed with the
church to grant his request, fearing, he said, "That he would run the same
course of rigid separation and Anabaptistry, which Mr. John Smith at Amsterdam
had done Mr. Smith's church separated from the church of England with Mr.
Robinson's, and removed a little before him into Holland. After Mr Smith's
death a number of his church returned, and promoted the Baptist's cause in
London. Croshy's History, vol. 1, p. 268.
. Such as did adhere to him were also dismissed, and removed with him, or not
long after him, to Salem Morton, p 86, 87.
:" The court again wrote to Salem against Mr. Williams, but could not prevent
his being called to office there; and we are told that, in one year's time he
filled that place with "principles of rigid separation, and tending to
Anabaptism Morton -- Hubbard.
:" For which they afterward banished him; though as it was a confused piece of
work for them thus to deal with him, so their historians have given the world a
very confused account about it. Morton, Hubbard, Dr. Cotton Mather, and others,
have set his banishment in 1634, yet all agree that he was not ordained till
after Mr. Skelton's death, which was in August that year; and they tell us of a
twelvemonth's labor with him and his church after his ordination, before his
banishment; neither do they give us a better account of the true causes of that
sentence, than they do of the date of it. I have taken much pains to collect as
exact an account of this affair as possible, and have succeeded beyond my
expectation.

THE dates I find to be as follow: Governor Winthrop and his Council first
wrote to Salem against Mr. Williams, April 12, 1631 Prince, p. 26.
, which occasioned his going to Plymouth. His first child was born there the
first week in August, 1633 Providence Records.
, and Mr. Cotton, who arrived at Boston the fourth of September following, says
he had removed into the Bay before his arrival Tenet washed, part 2d, p. 4.
. Mr. Skeleton died August 2, 1634 Magnalia, b. 3. p. 76.
, and we shall find proof enough that Mr. Williams was not banished till above
a year afterward; so that instead of such hasty proceedings at Salem as his
opponents would represent, he preached there more than a year before he was
ordained, and as long after it.

As to the causes of his sentence, Mr. Morton has given us five articles, Mr.
Hubbard six; Mr. Williams has reduced them to four, but Mr. Cotton is not
willing to let them stand as he stated them, but tells us that, two things
there were, which "(to my best observation and remembrance) caused the sentence
of his banishment; and two others fell in that hastened it.

"1. His violent and tumultuous carriage against the patent.

"BY the patent it is, that we received allowance from the King to depart his
kingdom, and to carry our goods with us, without offense to his officers, and
without paying custom to himself. By the patent, certain select men, as
magistrates and freemen, have power to make laws, and the magistrates to
execute justice and judgment amongst the people, according to such laws. By the
patent we have power to erect such a government of the church This clause is
not truth.
, as is most agreeable to the word, to the estate of the people, and to the
gaining of natives, in God's time, first to civility, and then to christianity.

THIS patent Mr. Williams publicly and vehemently preached against, as
containing matter of falsehood, and injustice: Falsehood, in making the King the
first christian Prince who had discovered these parts; and injustice, in giving
the country to his English subjects which belonged to the native Indians Tenet
washed, p. 27.
.

LET it be here noted, that we have no proof that Mr. Williams ever preached or
objected against the whole patent, or charter, without distinction, much less
not against that part of it which constituted them a civil government, His own
account of this matter informs us, that the sin of the patents which lay so
heavy on his mind was, that therein "christian Kings (so called) are invested
with a right, by virtue of their christianity, to take and give away the lands
and countries of other men.

AND he tells us that this evil so deeply afflicted his soul, that, before his
troubles and banishment, he "drew up a letter, not without the approbation of
some of the chief of New England, then tender also upon this point before God,
directed unto the King himself, humbly acknowledging the evil of THAT PART of
the patent which respects the donation of lands, etc. Reply to Cotton on the
Bloody Tenet, p. 276, 277.
"

WHAT grounds Mr. Williams and others had for this concern will plainly appear
by what follows; for in the said patent from Charles the first, he recites that
which was given by his father, King James the first, dated November 3, 1620,
wherein he "gave and granted unto the Council established at Plymouth, in the
county of Devon, all that part of America lying and being in breadth from 40
degrees of northerly latitude from the equinoxial line to 48 degrees of the
said northerly latitude inclusively, and in length of and within all the
breadth aforesaid throughout the main land from sea to sea, together also with
all the firm lands, soils, grounds, havens, ports, rivers, waters, fishing,
mines and minerals -- jurisdictions, privileges, franchises, and preheminences,
both within the said tract of land upon the main, and also within the islands
and seas adjoining. Provided always, that the said islands, or any of the
premises by the said letters patent intended and meant to be granted, were not
then actually possessed or inhabited by any other christian Prince or state --
To have and to hold, possess and enjoy, all and singular the aforesaid
continent lands, and every part and parcel thereof, unto the said Council, and
their heirs and assigns for ever -- To be holden OF our said most dear and
royal father, his heirs and successors, AS OF HIS MANOR of East-Greenwich, in
the county of Kent. Then King Charles went on to name the Massachusetts
Company, and to describe the limits of their colony through the main lands of
America, and granted it to them in the same manner, "to be holden OF US, our
heirs and successors, AS of OUR manor of East-Greenwich Massachusetts History,
vol. 3, p. 1 -- 4.
, etc.

CAN any man claim a fuller property in any land in the world, than here was
assumed over this vast tract of America! And though the men who had taken this
patent banished Mr. Williams out of it, yet before we have done we may see this
very principle which he abhorred turned back into their own bosoms, and made
use of by a tyrannical party to give them a severe scourging, after their
patent was vacated.

THE other foundation cause of Mr. Williams's banishment Mr. Cotton gives in
these words:

"2. THE magistrates, and other members of the General Court, upon intelligence
of some Episcopal and malignant practices against the country, made an order of
Court to take trial of the fidelity of the people, not by imposing upon them,
but by offering to them, an oath of fidelity; that in case any should refuse to
take it, they might not betrust them with place of public charge and command.
This oath when it came abroad he vehemently withstood, and dissuaded sundry
from it, partly because it was, as he said, Christ's prerogative to have his
office established by oath; partly because an oath was part of God's worship,
and God's worship was not to be put upon carnal persons, as he conceived many
of the people to be. So the Court was forced to desist from that proceeding
Tenet washed, p. 28, 29.
.

THIS case thus stated carries a sad face with it, but one acquainted with the
history of the country would be ready to doubt whether it was truly stated or
not; for every freeman had taken an oath of fidelity to the government before
that time, and if there was no intent of imposing but only of offering this new
oath, could they not find men enough for officers that would take it? Indeed
when I come to find how the truth of this matter was, by the colony records,
and to think that Mr. Cotton had them at his door when he wrote, I am the most
shocked about him by this publication of his against Mr. Williams, of any thing
I ever met with concerning him. Upon the colony records, when the General
Assembly met at Boston, May 14, 1634, I find those words, viz.

"It was agreed and ordered, that the former oath of freemen shall be revoked,
so far as it is dissonant from the oath of freemen here underwritten, and that
those that received the former oath shall stand bound no further thereby to any
intent or purpose than this new oath ties those that take the same."

The Oath of a Freeman.

"I A. B. being by God's providence an inhabitant and freeman within the
jurisdiction of this commonweal, do freely acknowledge myself to be subject to
the government thereof, and therefore do here swear, by the great and dreadful
name of the ever-living God, that I will be true and faithful to the same, and
will accordingly yield assistance and support thereunto with my person and
estate as in equity I am bound, and I will also truly endeavor to maintain and
preserve all the liberties and privileges thereof, submitting myself to the
wholesome laws and orders made and established by the same. And further, that I
will not plot nor practice any evil against it, nor consent to any that shall
so do, but will truly discover and reveal the same to lawful authority now here
established, for the speedy preventing thereof. Moreover I do solemnly bind
myself in the sight of God, that when I shall be called to give my voice,
touching any such matter of this state, wherein freemen are to deal, I will
give my vote and suffrage, as I shall judge in mine own conscience may best
conduce and tend to the public weal of the body, without respect of persons or
favor of any man; so help me God in the Lord Jesus Christ."

THIS oath was framed and taken before they proceeded to election at the time
abovesaid. When the Assembly met again at Newtown, now Cambridge, March 4,
1635, they enacted, "that every man of or above the age of sixteen years, who
has been or shall be resident within this jurisdiction, by the space of six
months (as well servants as others) and not infranchised, shall take the oath
of residents, before the Governor, Deputy Governor, or two of the next
Assistants, who shall have power to convent him for that purpose, and upon his
refusal to bind him over to the next Court of Assistants, and upon his refusal
the second time, to be punished at the discretion of the Court.

"IT is ordered, that the freeman's oath shall be given to every man of or
above the age of sixteen years, the clause for election of magistrates only
excepted Massachusetts Records.
."

Now let the candid reader judge,

1. WHO was the best friend to CHARTER-RIGHTS? The Massachusetts Company were
limited, in three different passages of their patent, not to make any laws
contrary to the laws of England; yet one professed design of this new oath, was
to guard against Episcopal practices, to effect which they left out the clause
in their former oath, which bound them to submit to all such laws, orders,
sentences and "decrees, as should be lawfully made and published by them; and
instead of it obliged men to swear to submit to the wholesome laws and orders
"made and established by the same. And though Mr. Cotton asserts that they did
not impose but only offer this new oath, yet the colony records are express,
that every man who resided within their jurisdiction six months, servants as
well as others, must swear to obey all their wholesome laws and orders, or be
punished at their discretion; yea, and also swear to reveal any plot that they
should know of against such government, to lawful authority " now here
established: That is, not to complain to any but themselves.

2. FROM whence came the power that presumed to abosolve themselves and others
from their oath, to keep to acts lawfully made, and to substitute the word
wholesome in the room of it? Let the learned Cotton Mather answer the question.
Says he, startq;the reforming churches, flying from Rome, carried some of them
more, some of them less, all of them something, of Rome with them; especially
in that spirit of imposition and persecution, which has too much cleaved unto
them all His son Dr. Samuel Mather's Apology for the Churches of New England,
Appendix, p. 149.


THAT spirit of imposition and persecution ran so high in England at the time
we are upon, that King Charles the first gave a commission, April 28, 1634, to
Archbishop Laud, and ten courtiers more Lord Coventry, the Archbishop of York,
the Earls of Portland, Manchester, Arundel, and Dorset, Lord Cottington, Sir
Thomas Edmunds, and the Secretaries Cook and Windebank.
, some of them known Papists, committing to any five of them power of
protection and government, as "well over the English colonies already planted,
as over all such other colonies, which by any of our people of England
hereafter shall be deduced into any other like parts whatsoever, and power to
make laws, ordinances and constitutions, concerning either the state public of
the said colonies, or utility of private persons and their lands, goods, debts
and succession, within the precincts of the same, and for ordering and
directing of them, in their demeanors toward foreign Princes and their people,
and likewise toward us and our subjects, as well within any foreign parts
whatsoever beyond the seas, as during their voyages, or upon the seas, to and
from the same. And for relief and support of the clergy, and the rule and cure
of the souls of our people living in those parts, and for consigning of
convenient maintenance unto them by tithes, oblations and other profits
accruing, according to your good discretion, with the advice of two or three of
our Bishops, whom you shall think fit to call unto your consultations, touching
the distribution of such maintenance unto the clergy, and all other matters
ecclesiastical, and to inflict punishment on all offenders or violators of
constitutions and ordinances, either by imprisonments or other restraints, or
by loss of life or members, according as the quality of the offense shall
require; with power also, our royal assent being first had and obtained, to
remove all Governors and Presidents of the said colonies, upon just cause
appearing, from their several places, and to appoint others in their stead --
and power also to ordain temporal judges and civil magistrates to determine
civil causes, with such powers, in such a form, as to you or any five of you
shall seem expedient; and also to ordain judges, magistrates and officers for
and concerning courts ecclesiastical, with such power and such a form, as to
you or any five or more of you, with the advice of the Bishops suffragan to the
Archbishop of Canterbury for the time being, shall be held meet. Giving,
moreover, and granting to you, that if it shall appear, that if any officer or
Governor of the said colonies shall unjustly wrong one another, or shall not
suppress all rebels to us, or such as shall not obey our commands, that then it
shall be lawful, upon advice with ourself first had, for the causes aforesaid,
or upon any other just reason, to remand and cause the offender to return into
England, or into any other place, according as in your good discretions you
shall think just and necessary. And we do furthermore give unto you, or any
five or more of you, letters patent and other writings whatsoever, of us or of
our royal predecessors granted, for or concerning the planting of any colonies,
in any countries provinces, islands or territories whatsoever beyond the seas;
and if upon view thereof, the same shall appear to you, or any five or more of
you, to have been surreptitiously and unduly obtained, or that any privileges
or liberties therein granted be hurtful to us, our crown or prerogative royal,
or to any foreign Princes, to cause the same to be revoked, and to do all other
things, which shall be necessary for the wholesome governemt and protection of
the said colonies, and our people therein abiding Massachusetts History, vol.
1. p. 502 -- 506.


THUS the words discretion and wholesome were brought in to violate charters
and all public faith, and to set up tyranny over the colonies; but Mr. Edward
Winslow being sent over agent for the country, by his indefatigable endeavors,
and the influence of some great men, prevented the taking place of this
arbitrary commission; upon which Laud turned his resentment against him, and
got him imprisoned seventeen weeks in the Fleet prison, in London, for having
sometimes taught publicly in the church of Plymouth, and for marrying people,
which Laud called "assuming the ministerial "office Flymouth Register, p. 12 --
14.
."

HAD the Massachusetts fathers only taken lawful and prudent methods to guard
against such Episcopal and malignant practices as these, they would have been
justified, and applauded by posterity; but now we mourn to think that they
brought so much of the same distemper into this country with them as they did.

THE same court that passed the act to oblige all to take the above oath, or be
punished at their discretion, also passed the following, viz.

"THIS court does entreat of the brethren and elders of every church within
this jurisdiction, that they will consult and advise of one uniform order of
discipline in the churches, agreeable to the scriptures, and then to consider
how far the magistrates are bound to interpose for the preservation of that
uniformity and peace of the churches Massachusetts Records.
."

UPON this Mr. Williams publicly preached against the oath they had framed, of
submission to such a power; for which the Governor and Assistants called him
before them, March 30, 1635, when he was "heard before all the ministers, and,
according to Governor Winthrop's opinion, was clearly refuted Winthrop's
Journal.
. The two things which Mr. Cotton says hastened his banishment were, Mr.
Williams's stirring up his church to write to other churches to which those
rulers belonged, admonishing them of injustice about some land near Salem; and
his separating from his own church when they turned against him is these things
Tenet washed, p. 20, 30.
. Concerning the first of these articles Governor Winthrop says, Salem men
preferred "a petition at the General Court, May, 1635, for some land in
Marblehead rock, which they did challenge as belonging to their town; but
becuase they had chosen Mr. Williams their teacher while he stood under
question of authority, and so offered contempt to the magistracy, etc. their
petition was refused till, etc. Upon this the church of Salem wrote to other
churches to admonish the magistrates of this as a heinous sin, and likewise the
deputies, etc. Winthrop's Journal.
" By, the conlony records I find, that the town of Marblehead was first granted
by the Assembly which met May 6, 1635, when sundry parcels of land which Salem
had improved were granted to them as soon as they should want them, only with
order that Marblehead should pay Salem for what they had done upon the land;
among the rest the land betwixt the clift and "the forest river, near
Marblehead, was so granted, but with this proviso, that if in the mean time
"the inhabitants of Salem can satisfy the Court that they have true right unto
it, that then it shall belong unto the inhabitants thereof.

THE generality of those inhabitants turned the next fall, and joined with the
rulers in banishing Mr. Williams, and when the General Assembly met again,
March 3, 1636, I find these words, viz. "it was proved this Court that
Marble-Neck belong to Salem Massachusetts Records.
Now what can be more natural than to conclude from hence, that the way for
Salem to satisfy the Court that they had a true right to their land, was to
submit their ecclesiastical as well as civil affairs to their direction?

AT a General Court, July 8, 1635, Mr. Williams, "of Salem, was summoned, and
did appear. It was laid to his charge, that being under question before the
magistracy and churches for diverse dangerous opinions, viz. 1. That the
magistrate ought not to punish the breach of the first table, otherwise than in
such case as did disturb the civil peace. 2. That he ought not to tender an
oathe to an unregenerate man 3. That a man ought not to pray with such, though
wife, children, etc. 4. That a man ought not to give thanks after sacrament,
nor after meals; and that the other churches were about to write to the church
of Salem to admonish him of these errors, understanding the church had called
him to the office of a teacher.
The said opinions were adjudged by all the magistracy and ministers (who were
desired to be present) to be erroneous, and very dangerous, and the calling of
him to office at that time was judged a great contempt of authority. So in fine
there was given to him and the church of Salem to consider of these things till
the next General Court, and then either to give satisfaction to the Court, or
else to expect the sentence; it being professedly declared by the ministers (at
the request of the Court to give their advice) that they who should obstinately
maintain such opinions (whereby the church might come into heresy, apostasy or
tyranny, and yet the civil magistrate could not intermeddle) were to be
removed, and that the other churches ought to request the magistrate so to do
Governor Winthrop's Journal.
.

THIS is the most plain and ingenious account of the real cause of Mr.
Williams's banishment that I have ever met with, from any who were opposite to
him, and carries the more weight with it, as it was wrote by one of the
greatest gentlemen in the country, in the time of it, and who was personally
concerned in these tranfactions. And by the first and last of this account it
is evident, that the grand difficulty they had with Mr. Williams was, his
denying the civil magistrates right to govern in ecclesiastical affairs.

THIS honorable writer informs us, that on August 15, 1635, Mr. Williams,
pastor of Salem, be-being "sick, and not able to speak, wrote to his church a
protestation that he would not communicate with the churches in the Bay,
neither would he communicate with them, except they would refuse communion with
the rest: But the whole church was grieved thereby.

SEPTEMBER 1. At this General Court, Mr. "Endicot made a protestation, in
justification of the letters formerly sent fom Salem to the other churches
against the magistracy and deputies, for which he was committed; but the same
day he came and acknowledged his fault, and was discharged Winthrop's Journal.
-- Mr. Endicot afterward acted at the head of the most bloody persecutions in
this country.
.

OCTOBER At this General Court Mr. Williams, "the teacher of Salem, was again
convented, and all the ministers in the Bay being desired to be present, he was
charged with his said two letters, that to the churches, complaining of the
magistrates for injustice, etc. and the other to his own church. -- He
justified both, -- and maintained all his opinions; and being offered further
conference or disputation, and another respite, he chose to dispute presently;
so Mr. Hooker was appointed to dispute with him, but could not reduce him from
any of his errors; so the next morning the Court sentenced him to depart out of
our jurisdiction, within six weeks, all the ministers approving the sentence;
and his own church had him under question also for the same case, and he at his
return home refused communion with his own church, who openly disclaimed his
errors, and wrote an humble submission to the magistrates, acknowledging their
fault in joining with Mr. Williams in that letter to the churches against them
Winthrop's Journal. -- The next time the Court met they confirmed their land to
them, as before observed. The province records agree with this account, only
they do not set any date after the Court met in September, before Mr.
Williams's sentence; but it might be October before it was passed.


JOHN SMITH was banished at the same time with Mr. Williams, for his dangerous
opinions, but we are not told what they were. It seems that the Court after
this gave Mr. Williams liberty to stay till spring, only enjoined it upon him
not to go about to draw others to his opinions; but in January, 1636, the
Governor and Assistants were informed, that he received and preached to
companies in his house, even of "such points as he had been censured for. Upon
which they agreed to send him into England by a ship then ready to depart; the
reason was, because "he had drawn about twenty people to his opinions, they
were intended to erect a plantation about the Narraganset bay, from whence
infection would easily spead into these churches, the people being many of them
much taken with the apprehension of his godliness. They sent for him to come to
Boston, but he sent an excuse; upon which they sent a pinnace, with a
commission to Captain Underhill, to apprehend him and carry him on board the
ship then at Nantasket; but when they "came to his house, they found he had
been gone three days Winthrop's Journal.
.

THIS I believe is the exact date of his departure, instead of being in 1634,
as their historians have represented. Sixteen years after Mr. Williams tells
us, he remembered a serious question which many "fearing God have made, to wit,
whether the promise of God's spirit blessing conferences, be so comfortably to
be expected in New England, because of those many public sins which most of
God's people in New England lie under, and one especially, to wit, the framing
a gospel or Christ to themselves without a cross, not professing nor practicing
that in Old, which they professedly came over to enjoy with peace and liberty
from any cross of Christ in New. I know those thoughts have deeply possessed
not a few, considering also the sin of the patents, wherein christian Kings, so
called, are invested with right, by virtue of their christianity, to take and
give away the lands and countries of other men; as also considering the
unchristian oaths, swallowed down, at their coming forth from Old-England,
especially in superstitious Laud his time and domineering Reply to Cotton, p.
276. Note, it was not all oaths, but only them that he esteemed unchristian
ones that he objected against.
.

IT is evident by the foregoing list of errors charged upon Mr. Williams, that
the Massachusetts ministers and rulers meant to carry their uniformity so far,
as to oblige ministers and christians, throughout their jurisdiction, not only
to ask a blessing at the Lord's table and at common meals, but also to return
thanks afterward; and it is likely that this straining of that matter beyond
scripture example, has had not a little influence upon many since to carry them
to the other extreme. Be that as it may, what human heart can be unaffected
with the thought, that a people who had been sorely persecuted in their own
country, so as to flee three thousand miles into a wilderness for religious
liberty, yet should have that imposing temper cleaving so fast to them, as not
to be willing to let a godly minister, who testified against it, stay even in
any neighboring part of this wilderness, but moved them to attempt to take him
by force, to send him back into the land of their persecutors! To avoid which
he fled to the heathen in the depth of winter, and obtained such favor in
their sight, that Osamaquin (otherwise called Masasoit) chief Sachem at Mount
Hope, made him a grant of part of that which is since called Rehoboth; yet that
was so far then from answering to its present name, that a letter and messenger
was sent from Plymouth to let him know there was not ROOM for him in that
place, because within their patent. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a
lamentation!

MR. Williams's own testimony, upon a particular occasion at Providence
twenty-five years after, I think deserves notice here. Says he,

"I TESTIFY and declare in the holy presence of God, that when at my first
coming into these parts I obtained the lands of Secunk of Osamaquin, the then
chief Sachem on that side, the Governor of Plymouth, Mr. Winslow, wrote to me,
in the name of their government, their claim of Secunk to be in their
jurisdiction, as also their advice to remove but over the river unto this side,
where now by God's merciful providence we are, and then I should be out of
their claim, and be as free as themselves, and loving neighbors together This
by the way shows a great difference between the temper of Plymouth and
Massachusetts rulers, and which we shall yet see more^^^f. The chief Sachem's
names are very differently spelt in the different writings I have met with.
. After I had obtained this place, now called Providence, of Canonicus and
Myantinomy, they chief Nanhigganset Sachems deceased, Osamaquin (the Sachem
aforesaid, also deceased) laid his claim to this place also. This forced me to
repair to the Nanhigganset Sachems aforesaid, who declared, that Osamaquin was
their subject, and had solemnly, himself in person, with ten men, subjected
himself and his lands unto them at the Nanhigganset, only now he seemed to
revolt from his loyalty, under the shelter of the English at Plymouth This
perfectly agrees with the account we have of Masassoit or Osamaquin's league he
made with Plymouth people the spring after their first coming, and of the
Narraganset's threatenings on that account. Prince's Chronology, p. 102, 116.
. This I declared from the Nanhigganset Sachems to Osamaquin, who without any
stick acknowledged to be true, that he had so subjected as the Nanhigganset
Sachems had affirmed; but withal he affirmed that he was not subdued by war,
which himself and his father had maintained against the Nanhiggansets; but God,
said he, subdued us by a plaque, which swept away my people, and forced me to
yield. This conviction and confession of his, together with gratuities to
himself, brethren and followers, made him often profess, that he was pleased
that I should here be his neighbor, and the rather because he and I had been
great friends at Plymouth; and also because his and my friends at Plymouth
advised him to be at peace and friendship with me; and he hoped that our
children after us would be good friends together. And whereas there has been
often speech of Providence falling in Plymouth jurisdiction by virtue of
Osamaquin's claim; I add unto the testimonies abovesaid, that the Governor, Mr.
Bradford deceased, and other of their magistrates, declared unto me, both by
conference and writing, that they and their government were satisfied, and
resolved never to molest Providence, nor to claim beyond Secunk, but to
continue loving friends and neighbors (among the barbarians) together. This is
the true sum and substance of many passages between our countrymen of Plymouth
and Osamaquin, and me.

ROGER WILLIAMS Copied from the original, in his own hand writing, dated
"Providence, 13, 10, 1661," (so called.)
"

THE above date of Mr. Williams's removal is confirmed by Mr. Winslow's being
then Governor of Plymouth; for 1636 was the only year that he sustained that
office between 1633 and 1644: And as is appeared by Plymouth records that he
entered on his government the first of March that year, we may conclude that
Mr. Williams fled to Secunk in the depth of winter, and removed with a few
friends over the river in the spring It is said that he, with Thomas Angel,
^^hired servant, and some others, went over in a canoe, and were saluted by the
Indians near the lower ferry, by the word whatcheere? i. e. how do you do?
which gave name to a field, which Mr. Williams sold many years after, and in
the deed says he satisfied the owner: for it, and planted it, "at my first
coming with mine own hands." They went round till they got to a pleasant spring
above the great bridge, where they landed; and near to which both he and Angel
lived to old age.
. And here let us admire the wisdom that governs the world, "As Joseph was sold
by his envious brethren, with intent to get him out of their way, yet divine
providence overruled this cruel action quite otherwise than they intended, and
made it the means of their future preservation; so the harsh treatment and
cruel exile of Mr. Williams seem designed by his brethren for the same evil
end, but was, by the goodness of the same overruling hand, turned to the most
beneficent purposes History of Providence.
."

JUST at this juncture the Pequods, a powerful Indian tribe, who lived upon the
lands where are now the towns of Groton and Stonington, were forming plots
against the English colonies, even the very year that those of Connecticut and
Providence began, and when Boston was but six years old; and as a vessel was
sent by the government from thence, under the command of John Oldham, to trade
with the natives at Block-Island, about fourteen Indians boarded the vessel,
and murdered him; but as John Gallop happened to come upon them, in his return
from Connecticut river, they leaped into the sea, where some were drowned, and
others reached the shore. The first news of this sad event that they received
was from Mr. Williams's pen, by two Indians who went with Oldham, and one from
Conanicus, a Narraganset Sachem, who arrived -- at Boston July 26, 1636.
Governor Vane wrote back to Mr. Williams, to let the Narragansets know that
they expected them to send home two boys who were with Oldham, and to take
revenge upon the islanders. Four days after the boys came home with one of
Miantinomy's men, with another letter from Mr. Williams, informing that said
Sachem had caused the Sachem of Niantick to send to Block-Island for them, and
that he had near a hundred fathom of peag, and much other goods of Oldham's,
which should be reserved for them, and that three of the seven Indians who were
drowned were Sachems Hubbard.
. August 26 came a third letter from Mr. Williams, and Governor Winthrop says,
"In these Indian troubles Mr. Williams was assiduous to influence the
Narragansets in favor of the English, and to keep them from joining with the
Pequods Hubbard's Journal
.

SEPT, Canonicus sent word of some English "whom the Pequods had killed at
Saybrook, and Mr. Williams wrote that the Pequods and Narragansets were at
truce, and that Minatonomoh told him that the Pequods had labored to persuade
them that the English were minded to destroy all the Indians. Whereupon we sent
for Minotonomoh to come to us. Accordingly he and two of Canonicus's sons and
another Sachem, and near twenty of their men whom they call Sannups, came to
Boston October 21, where the Governor called together all the magistrates and
ministers: And next day a firm league was signed between them. But because they
could not make them "well understand the articles, they told them they would
send a copy of them to Mr. Williams, who could best interpret the same to them.
So after dinner they took leave Winthrop -- Hubbard.
. What would the Massachusetts have now done, if Mr. Williams had been sent to
England, as they intended the winter before!

LET us now review their religious state. In October, 1635, arrived Mr. Thomas
Shepard and Hugh Peter's, two ministers, who were much improved afterward; also
Mr. afterward Sir Henry Vane, the latter of whom was admitted a member of
Boston church November 1 Winthrop
. At the General Assembly held March 3, 1636, "Ordered, that all persons are to
take notice that this Court does not, nor will hereafter, approve of any such
companies of men, as shall henceforth join in any pretended way of church
fellowship, without they shall first acquaint the magistrates and the elders of
the greater part of the churches in this jurisdiction with their intentions,
and have their approbation herein. And further it is ordered, that no person
being a member of any church which shall hereafter be gathered without the
approbation of the magistrates and the greater part of the said churches, shall
be admitted to the freedom of this common wealth Massachusetts Records.
."

AT the election at Boston, May 25, Mr. Vane was chosen Governor, and Mr.
Winthrop Deputy Governor; and a standing Council was formed of three men; The
reason was, for that it was showed "from the word of God, etc. that the
principal magistrates ought to be for life. Mr. Winthrop and Mr. Dudley were
chosen for life, and Governor Vane to be their President Winthrop's Journal.
Mr. Cotton wrote this year to Lord Say and Seal, and says, God has so framed
the state of "church government and ordinances, that they may be compatible to
any commonwealth, though never so much disordered in its frame, But yet when a
commonwealth has liberty to mould its oun frame, I conceive the scripture has
given full direction for the right ordering of the same, and that in such sort
as may best maintain the euexia [well being] of the church. Mr Hooker does
often quote a saying out of Mr. Cartwright, that no man fashioneth his house to
his hangings, but his hangings to his house. It is better that the commonwealth
be fashioned to the setting forth of God's house, which is his church; than to
accommodate the church frame to the civil state. -- Nor need we fear, that this
course will, in time, cast the commonwealth into distractions, and popular
confusions. -- Purity preserved in the church, will preserve well ordered
liberty in the people, and both of them establish well balanced authority in
the magistrates. Massachusetts History, vol. 1. p 497, 500. His great mistake
herein will soon appear.
. The next year Mr. Endicot was chosen for life in Vane's room. This Council
soon found work to do, one article of which here follows.

To the Constable of Salem.
"WHEREAS we are credibly informed that diverse persons (both men and women)
within your town, do disorderly assemble themselves both on the Lord's days and
at other times, contemptuously refusing to come to the solemn meetings of the
church there (or being some of them justly cast out) do obstinately refuse to
submit themselves, that they might be again received; but do make conventions,
and seduce diverse persons of weak capacity, and have already withdrawn some of
them from the church, and hereby have caused much (not only disturbance in the
church, but also) disorders and damage in the civil state. -- These are
therefore to require you forthwith to repair unto all such disorderly persons;
and signify to them that said course is very offensive to the government here,
and may no longer be suffered, and therefore command them from us, to refrain
all such disordered assemblies, and pretended church meetings; and either to
conform themselves to the laws and orders of this government, being established
according to the rule of God's word; or else let them be assured that we shall
by God's assistance take some such strick and speedy course for the reformation
of these disorders, and preventing the evils which may otherways ensue, as our
duty to God and charge over his people do call for from us. And when you have
given them this admonition you shall diligently attend how it is observed, and
certify us accordingly, as you will answer your neglect herein at your peril.

From Boston this 30th of the 3d month, 1636. H. VANE, GOV. JO. WINTHROP, Dept.
THO. DUDLEY Winthrop.

THEY were somewhat too short in declaring the laws and orders of their
government already established, for that work was yet to do; therefore this
Court now passed the following act, viz. The "Governor, Deputy Governor, Thomas
Dudley, John Haynes, Richard Bellingham, Esquires, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Peter's; and
Mr. Shepard, are entreated to make a draught of laws agreeable to the word of
God, which may be the fundamentals of this commonwealth, and to present the
same to the next General Court; and it is ordered that in the mean time the
magistrates and their associates shall proceed in the courts to hear and
determine all causes according to the laws now established, and where there is
no law, then as near the laws of God as they can Massachusetts Records. From
their beginning the Governor and Assistants had been their executive court,
till the March preceding, when they took in associates with the magistrates;
and formed inferior courts in their several towns, to try causes not exceeding
ten pounds; from whence appeals might be made to the court of Assistants.
.

SOON after this came on such disputes in the country about grace and works,
that it began to be as "common there to distinguish between men being under a
covenant of works, and a covenant of grace, as in other countries between
Protestants and Papists Hubbard. Captain Johnson says, "That you may understand
their way of broaching their abominable errors, it was in dividing those things
the Lord has united in his work of conversion continued, carrying on a soul to
heaven, in these four particulars: "1. In dividing between the word and the
word, under pretense of a legal gospel, persuading the people their ministers
were legal preachers, teaching them little better than Popery, and unfit for
gospel churches; denying them to be any ministers of Christ, that preach any
preparation work, by showing men what the law requires. Here Is nothing, says
one of them, but preaching out of the law and the prophets. Truly, says
another, I have not heard a pure gospel sermon from any of them. "In separating
Christ and his graces, in manifesting himself to be in the soul; and this they
say makes much for the magnifying of free grace; and indeed they made it so
free, that the soul that receives it shall never taste any of it by their
consent, but remain still a dry branch as before. These legal Pharisees, says
one of them, tell us of a thing they call inherent grace, and of a man being
made a new creature; but I am sure the best of them go on in their legal duties
and performances still, sorrowing for sin, hearing of sermons, observing duty
morning and evening, and many such like matters. Tush man, says another, you
shall hear more than this; I was discoursing with one of their scholastical
preacher's disciples, a professed convert, and yet when he came to pray, he
begged for the forgiveness of his sins; I asked him why he used that vain
repetition, since he did believe he was justified by Christ already? He made me
an answer not worth repeating; but when I told him God could see no sin in his
people, no more than I could see that which was covered close from my
eyesight, he told me I spoke little less than blasphemy. So ignorant are these
men, and their learned guides also; who persuade them the more they have of the
indwelling of the spirit of Christ, the better they shall be enabled to these
legal duties. Nay, quoth the other, I can tell you more than all this; they
make it an evidence of their good estate, even their sanctification, and yet
these men would make people believe they are against Popery. "3. The third
dividing tenet, by which these persons prosecuted their errors, was between the
word of God and the spirit of God: And here these sectaries had many pretty
knacks to delude withal, and especially to please the female sex, they told of
rare revelations of things to come from the spirit, as ^hey say. -- Come along
with me, says one of them. I will bring you to a woman that preaches better
gospel than any of your black coats, that have been at the university; a woman
of another kind of spirit, who has had many revelations of things to come, and
for my part, says he, I had rather hear such a one that speaks from the mere
motion of the spirit, without any study at all, than any of your learned
scholars, although they may be fuller of scripture -- and admit they speak by
the help of the spirit, yet the other goes beyond them. 4. To divide between
Christ and his ordinances; and here they played their game to purpose, even
casting down all ordinances as carnal, and that because they were polluted by
the ordinance of man; as some of these sectaries have said to the ministers of
Christ, you have cast off the cross in baptism, but you would do well to cast
off baptism itself; as also for the sacrament of the Lord's supper, for to make
use of bread, or the juice of a silly grape, to represent the body and blood of
Christ, they accounted it as bad as necromancy in ministers of Christ to
perform it." Johnson's History, p. 67 -- 94

. It divided the General Court, and from thence it was carried into Boston
church, where it caused sharp debates on Lord's day, December 31, between the
two ministers, Cotton and Wilson, and between the Governor and Deputy Governor,
who were members of it Winthrop -- Hubbard.
. In this controversy Mr. Cotton found what it was to fall into the minority,
for none of the ministers held fully with him but Mr. Wheelwright, who was not
a settled minister, but was preaching to a branch of Boston church, at the
place now called Braintree; where at a general fast on January 19, 1637, he
delivered a discourse that greatly increased the flame. Under his third use we
are told that he said, The "second sort of people that are to be condemned, are
all such as do set themselves against the Lord Jesus Christ; such are the
greatest enemies to the state as can be; if they can have their wills, you see
what a lamentable state both church and commonwealth will be in; then we shall
have need of mourning; the Lord cannot endure those that are enemies to himself
and kingdom and people, and unto the good of his church Gorton's Glass for
New England, p. 19, 20; who says, in this, Wheelwright "bore testimony to the
light;" and the words above he says he transcribed out of Mr. Wheelwright's
manuscript.


AT the General Court, March 9, Mr. Wheelwright was called to account for the
words which tended to sedition in his sermon, but the matter was deferred from
court to court till fall, when he was banished. Contention arose to a great
height. Stephen Greensmith, for saying "that all the ministers except A. B. C.
did teach a covenant of works, was censured to acknowledge his fault in every
church, and fined 40 l. Winthrop.
"

AT the General Court, May 17, 1637, after a hot dispute they proceeded to
election, when Mr. Vane and his friends were left out He sailed for England the
3d of August following.
; and a law was made, "that no town or person shall receive any stranger
resorting hither with intent to reside in this jurisdiction, nor shall allow
any lot or habitation to any above three weeks, except such persons shall have
allowance under some one of the council, or of two other of the magistrates
their hands, upon pain that every town that shall give or sell any lot or
habitation to any such not so allowed shall forfeit 100 l. for every offense;
and every person receiving any such for longer time than is here expressed, or
than shall be allowed in some special case -- shall forfeit for every offense
40 l. and for every month after such person shall there continue 20 l.
Massachusetts Records.
"

MR. Cotton was for a while so much dissatisfied with this law, that he had
thoughts of removing out of that jurisdiction Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p.
6^.
. Governor Winthrop wrote a defense of it, in which he does not deny but that a
principal design of that law was to keep away persons of Mr. Wheelwright's
opinions, and says, If "we find his opinions such as will cause divisions, and
make people look at their magistrates, ministers, and brethren, as enemies to
Christ, antichrists, etc. were it not sin and unfaithfulness in us, to receive
more of their opinions, which we already find the evil fruit of? Nay, why do
not those who now complain join with us in keeping out such, as well as
formerly they did in expelling Mr. Williams for the like, though less
dangerous?" Where this change of their judgments should arise I leave to
themselves to examine Massachusetts History, vol. 3, p. 71.
. Ah! less dangerous, sure enough! for Mr. Williams was banished for holding
that the magistrates sword ought not to be brought in to decide religious
controversies; but Wheelwright would have turned that sword against the rulers,
ministers and people, that he judged to be under a covenant of works, and so
enemies to grace.

MR. Wheelwright was brother in-law to Mrs. Anne Hutchinson, who had been a
principal instrument of the division in the country about grace and works. We
are told that she brought these two errors out of England with her, viz. 1.
That the person "of the Holy Ghost dwells in a justified person. 2. That no
sanctification can help to evidence our justification Winthrop's Journal.
A synod of ministers and messengers from all parts of the country met at
Newtown, the 30th of August, and spent three weeks in debates upon these
controversies, and drew up and condemned fourscore errors. The General Court
adjourned to attend on their debates, and after their result was signed by all
the settled ministers except Mr. Cotton, who also appeared to incline toward
the majority; they met Sept. 26, when Mr. Wheelwright "appearing, was dismissed
until he should be sent for by the court or courts which shall succeed. This
present court is dissolved, until a new one be called, and to be kept at
Newtown Massachusetts Records.
.

HERE opens something that I never heard of till I found it upon the colony
records. It was customary to elect their deputies twice a year, namely, in the
spring and fall; but to choose them twice in one fall was an unprecedented act,
of which I believe no parallel can be found from the foundation of the country
to this day. It seems that a major vote of those deputies, to execute the
decrees of the late synod, could not be obtained, therefore the house was
dissolved, and a new one convened on November 2, 1637; to whom a remonstrance
against those former proceedings was presented, signed by above sixty men; of
whom William Aspinwall, who drew it, and John Coggshall were members of the
Assembly; but for which they were now excluded, and an order was sent for
Boston to choose two other deputies. Also, "John Oliver, justifying the
seditious libel called a remonstrance or petition, was discharged from being a
deputy in this court Massachusetts Records -- Winthrop. The remaining members
of the Assembly were Governor Winthrop, Deputy Governor Dudley, John Endicot,
John Humfrey, Richard Bellingham, Roger Harlakenden, Israel Stoughton, Simon
Bradstreet, and Increase Howel, Assistants, and 31 deputies. The house that was
dissolved in September had 26 deputies, of whom but IT were in this new house.
Mr. Atherton Hough was one who was left out, though he was a magistrate two
years before. John and Isaac Heath, John Johnson, Thomas Dynde, Nicholas
Danforth, William Spencer, Samuel Appleton, Joseph Metcalf, John Upham, and
Thomas Gardner, were also of those they left out.

These and such like proceedings caused the removal of Mr. William Blaxton
about this time. He was a minister in the church of England, but came early to
this country. It appears by Johnson's history, p. 20, that he was here in 1628,
but not agreeing with Mr. Endicot and others about church affairs, he betook
himself to agriculture. He had planted himself upon the neck of land where
Boston stands, which from him was called Blaxton's Point, when the
Massachusetts company first arrived with their charter. At a court in Boston,
April 1, 1633, they made him a grant of fifty acres of land near his house
there, Massachusetts Records. Yet now he said, I came from England, "because I
did not like the Lord Bishops; but I cannot join with you, because I would not
be under the Lord Brethren. Magnalia. He went and settled six miles ^orth of
Mr. Williams, near what is now called Whipple's Bridge, in Cumberland; where he
lived to old age, and used at times to preach at Providence, and other places
adjacent, and left behind him the character of a godly and pious man, though
his family is extinct. He planted an orchard near where he lived, which we are
told is the first that ever bore fruit in Rhode Island colony; and 140 years
after, many of the trees continued to be thrifty and fruitful.


The court then proceeded to pass the following sentences, viz. "Mr. John
Wheelwright being formerly convicted of contempt and sedition, and now
justifying himself and his former practice, being the disturbance of the civil
peace, he is by the court disfranchised and banished, having fourteen days to
settle his affairs.

"MR. John Coggshall being convented for disturbing the public peace, was
disfranchised, and enjoined not to speak any thing to disturb the public peace,
upon pain of banishment.

"MR. William Aspinwall being convented for having his hand to a petition or
remonstrance, being a seditious libel, and justifying the same, for which and
for his insolent carriage, he is disfranchised and banished, putting in
sureties for his departure before the end of the first month next ensuing.

"MRS. Hutchinson, the wife of Mr. William Hutchinson, being convented for
traducing the ministers and their ministry in this country, she declared
voluntarily her revelations were the ground, and that she should be delivered,
and the court ruined with their posterity, and hereupon was banished; and the
mean while was committed to Mr. Joseph Weld, until the court shall dispose of
her."

CAPTAIN Underhill, and two sergeants, were put from office and disfranchised,
one of the sergeants being also fined 40 l. the other 20 l. Four men more were
disfranchised for having their hands to said petition, one of whom was William
Dyer, afterward the first secretary of Rhode Island colony. Ten men retracted
their signing that remonstrance, and were forgiven. Then upon the 20th of
November the court passed the following sentence:

"WHEREAS the opinions and revelations of Mr. Wheelwright and Mrs. Hutchinson
have seduced and led into dangerous errors many of the people of New England,
insomuch as there is just cause of suspicion that they, as others in Germany in
former times, may upon some revelation make sudden irruption upon those that
differ from them in judgment; for prevention whereof it is ordered that all
those whose names are underwritten (upon warning given at their
dwelling-houses) before the 30th day of this month of November, deliver in at
Mr. Keayne's house, at Boston, all such guns, pistols, swords, powder, shot and
match, as they shall be owners of, or have in their custody, upon pain of 10 l.
for every default to be made thereof; which arms are to be kept by Mr. Keayne
till this court shall take further order therein. Also it is ordered, upon like
penalty of 10 l. that no man who is to render his arms by this order, shall buy
or borrow any guns, swords, pistols, powder, shot or match, until this court
shall take further order therein." Seventy-six men are named as being disarmed
by this sentence, only if any of them would acknowledge and not justify said
petition before two magistrates, they should then be free from it Massachusetts
Records. It appears that the court had much difficulty afterward with Keayne
about these arms.
. Of these men 58 belonged to Boston, 5 to Roxbury, 2 to Charlestown, 6 to
Salem, 2 to Ipswich, and 3 to Newbury; of whom Richard Dummer, of Newbury, had
been an Assistant, and Mr. Hutchinson, Underhill, Aspinwall, Coggshall and
Oliver, of Boston, Robert Moulton, of Salem, and others, had been deputies.

DIRECTLY upon the foregoing act the Assembly added the following, viz. "The
court being sensible of great disorders growing in this commonwealth, through
the contempts which have been of late put upon the civil authority, and
intending to provide remedy for the same in tim^, does order and decree, that
whosoever shall hereafter openly or willingly defame any court of justice, or
the sentence or proceedings of the same, or any of the magistrates or other
judges of any such court, in respect of any act or sentence therein passed, and
being thereof lawfully convicted in any general court or courts of Assistants,
shall be punished for the same, by fine, imprisonment or banishment, as the
quality and measure of the offense shall deserve. -- Provided always, that
seeing the best judges may err through ignorance or misinformation -- it is not
the intent of this court to restrain the free use of the way of God, by
petition," etc.

A COMPLAINT being made at the same time that some ministers were not well
maintained, the court sent out a request, That the several churches will
"speedily enquire hereinto, and if need be to confer together about it, and
send some to advise with this court at the next session thereof, that some
order may be taken according to the rule of the gospel. Massachusetts Records.
The effects of these proceedings we shall soon see; though by the way it is
proper to observe, that as Mr. Williams had been instrumental of procuring the
Narragansets help against the Pequods, the several colonies sent out their
forces against them, and Governor Winthrop says, May 24, "By letters from Mr.
Williams we were notified, that Capt. Mason was gone to Saybrook with 80
English and 100 Indians," etc. so that he was constantly engaged for their
good; the army was successful, the Pequods were subdued, and I find a proposal
of a day of thanksgiving for the soldiers return, at the General Court, August
1. But at the same time they say "Mr. John Green, of New-Providence, having
spoken against the magistrates contemptuously, stands bound over in 100 marks
to appear at the next quarter court." At that court he was fined 20 l. and
committed till it was paid; though upon a submissive petition to the General
Court, Sept. 26, he was released Ibid.
. He with others had resorted to Mr. Williams's plantation, to which there was
a great addition the next spring, as well as a new one begun at Rhode Island,
of which take the following account:

MR. John Clarke, a learned physician, who I find was admitted a freeman at
Boston May 6, 1635, as his brother Joseph had been the March before, seeing how
things were turned at the court in November, 1637, he made a proposal to his
friends, for peace sake, and to enjoy the freedom of their consciences, to
remove out of that jurisdiction. The motion was accepted, and he (being then a
gentleman in his 29th year) was requested with some others to look out for a
place; they did so, and by reason of the heat of the preceding summer, they
first went northerly into that which is now the province of New Hampshire; but
the coldness of the following winter made them incline to turn the other way.
"So having sought the Lord for direction, they agreed that while their vessel
was passing about Cape-Cod they would cross over by land, having Long Island
and Delaware bay in their eye, for the place of their residence. At Providence
Mr. Williams lovingly entertained them, and being consulted about their design,
readily presented two places before them; Sowams, now called Barrington, and
Aquetneck, now Rhode Island. They being determined to go out of the other
jurisdictions, Mr. Williams, Mr. Clarke, and two others, went to Plymouth to
enquire how the case stood; who lovingly entertained them, and let them know
that they claimed Sowams, but advised them to settle at Aquetneck, and promised
that they should be looked upon as free, and to be treated and assisted as
loving neighbors." Upon their return nineteen men incorporated themselves into
a body politic, and chose Mr. Coddington to be their Judge or chief magistrate.
Clarke's Narrative. -- Callender's Sermon.
."

Now to take things in their order, it is to be observed, that though Mr.
Williams and a few of his friends had, with the consent of the Narraganset
sachems, been settled at Providence near two years, yet the first deed of the
place that is extant bears date the same day with that of Aquetneck; and is as
follows:

"AT Nanhiggansick the 24th of the first month, commonly called March, in the
2d year of our plantation, or planting at Mooshausick, or Providence:
Memorandum, that we Caunannicus and Miantinomu, the two chief sachems of
Nanhiggansick, having two years since sold unto Roger Williams the lands and
meadows upon the two fresh rivers called Mooshausick and Wanaskatuckett The
first of these rivers falls into the cove above Providence great bridge from
the north, the other from the west.
, do now by these present establish and confirm the bounds of those lands, from
the rivers and fields of Pautuckett, the great hill of Neoterconkenitt on the
northwest, and the town of Mashapauge on the west. As also, in consideration of
the many kindnesses and services he has continually done for us, both for our
friends of Massachusetts, as also at Quininkticutt and Apaum, or Plymouth; we
do freely give unto him all that land from those rivers reaching to Pautuxett
river, as also the grass and meadows upon Pautuxett river; in witness whereof
we have hereunto set our hands, in the presence of, The mark of CAUNANNICUS,
The mark of MIANTINOMU. The mark of SEATAGH, The mark of * ASSOTEMEWETT.


"1639, MEMORANDUM, 3 month 9 day, this was all again confirmed by Miantinomu;
be acknowledged this his act and hand; up the stream of Pautuckett and
Pautuxett without limits we might have for our use of cattle; witness hereof,
ROGER WILLIAMS, BENEDICT ARNOLD Literally transcribed from Providence Records.
Pawtucket river rises in or near Rutland, and runs through Leicester, Sutton,
Grafton and Uxbridge, and entering Rode-Istand colony, passes between
Smithfield and Cumberland, and falls into Narraganset bay, between Providence
and Rehoboth. Pawtuxet rises near the borders of Connecticut, and passing
through Gloucester, Situate and Cranston, falls into said bay, five miles
south of Providence.



THE deed of Rhode Island was also given the same March 24, 1638; and 20 years
after Mr. Williams having occasion to give his testimony concerning it, says,
"I have acknoledged (and have and shall endeavor to maintain) the rights and
properties of every inhabitant of Rhode Island in peace; yet since there is so
much sound and noise of purchase and purchasers, I judge it not unseasonable to
declare the rise and bottom of the planting of Rhode Island in the fountain of
it: It was not price nor money that could have purchased Rhode Island.
Rhode Island was obtained by love; by the love and favor which that honorable
gentleman Sir Henry Vane and myself had with that great sachem Miantinomu,
about the league which I procured between the Massachusetts English, etc. and
the Narragansets in the Pequod war. It is true I advised a gratuity to be
presented to the sachem and the natives, and because Mr. Coddington and the
rest of my loving countrymen were to inhabit the place, and to be at the charge
of the gratuities, I drew up a writing in Mr. Coddington's name, and in the
names of such of my loving countrymen as came up with him, and put it into as
sure a form as I could at that time (amongst the Indians) for the benefit and
assurance of the present and future inhabitants of the island. This I mention,
that as that truly noble Sir Henry Vane has been so great an instrument in the
hand of God for procuring of this island from the barbarians, as also for
procuring and confirming of the charter, so it may by all due thankful
acknowledgement be remembered and recorded of us and ours which reap and enjoy
the sweet fruits of so great benefits, and such unheard of liberties amongst us
This I copied from the original manuscript, in Mr Williams's own hand writing,
dated "Providence, 25 6, 1658 (so called)." The affair of procuring the charter
we shall hear more of anon.
."

MR. Williams having obtianed the aforesaid grant of Providence, conveyed the
same to his friend by the following instrument.

"Providence, 8th of the 8th month, 1638 (so called.) Memorandum, that I Roger
Williams, having formerly purchased of Caunannicus and Miantinomu this our
situation or plantation of New-Providence, viz. the two fresh rivers
Wanasquatuckett and Mooshausick, and the ground and meadows thereupon; in
consideration of thirty pounds received from the inhabitaints of said place, do
freely and fully pass, grant and make over equal right and power of enjoying
and disposing of the same grounds and lands unto my loving friends and
neighbors, Stuckely Westcoat, William Arnold, Thomas James, Robert Cole, John
Green, John Throckmorton, William Harris, William Carpenter, Thomas Olney,
Francis Weston, Richard Waterman, Ezekiel Holliman, and such other as the major
part of us shall admit into the same fellowship of vote with us: As also I do
freely make and pass over equal right and power of enjoying and disposing of
the lands and grounds reaching from the aforesaid rivers unto the great river
Pautuxett, with the grass and meadows thereupon, which was so lately given and
granted by the aforesaid sachems to me; witness my hand, ROGER WILLIAMS
Providence Records. It seem the first deed of this tenure was lost, therefore
this was drawn as exactly as could be remembered in 1666. Of the above men,
Olney, Weston, Westcoat, Waterman and Holliman, did not depart the
Massachusetts colony till April 1638. Massachusetts Records. They, will
Throckmorton, came from Salem. Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 421, and
records aforesaid. Weston had been a deputy in court.
."

THOSE who were thus received signed the following covenent, viz.

"WE whose names are here underwriten being desirous to inhabit in the town of
Providence, do promise to submit ourselves in active or passive obedience to
all such orders or agreements as shall be made for public good of the body in
an orderly way, by the major consent of the present inhabitants, masters of
families, incorporated together into a township, and such others whom they
shall admit unto the same, only in civil things.

BY the records, compared with a more ample and full deed of Mr. Williams's to
the town, executed December 20, 1661, which is entered there, it appears that
he generously gave the aforesaid twelve men their interest in the town freely,
and the thirty pounds were paid by the next who were admitted, at the rate of
thirty shillings a man, the names of whom were Chad Brown, William Field,
Thomas Harris, William Wickenden, Robert Williams, Richard Scott, William
Renolds, John Field, John Warner, Thomas Angel, Benedict Arnold, Joshua
Winsor, Thomas Hopkins, Francis Weeks," etc Of these I find Williams (brother
to Mr. Roger) among the Massachusetts freemen, but no more of their names upon
those records. Perhaps most of them might have newly arrived; for Governor
Winthrop assures us that not less than 3000 arrived this year in 20 ships; and
Mr. Hubbard tells us that those who inclined to the Baptist's principles went
to Providence, others went to Newport. Seven of the first twelve, with Angel,
I suppose began the settlement with Mr. Williams in 1636.
. In the last mentioned deed, after referring to the former ones, and
expressing that the sachems deed was two years after his first purchase, he
more fully explains the nature and motives of those transactions. Says he,
notwithstanding I had the frequent promise "of Miatinomu, my kind friend, that
it should not be land that I should want about those bounds mentioned, provided
that I satisfied the Indians there inhabiting, I having made convenant of
peaceable neighborhood will all the sachems and natives round about us, and
having, in a sense of God's merciful providence unto me in my distress, called
the place PROVIDENCE, I desired it might be for a shelter for persons
distressed for conscience; I then considering the conditions of diverse of my
countrymen, I communicated by said purchase unto my loving friends John
Throckmorton, and others, who then desired to take shelter here with me. And
whereas by God's merciful assistance I was the procurer of the purchase, not by
moneys nor payment, the natives being so shy and jealous that moneys could not
do it, but by that language, acquaintance and favor with the natives, and
other advantages which it pleased God to give me; and also bore the charges and
venture of all the gratuities which I gave to the great sachems, and other
sachems and natives round about us, and lay engaged for a loving and peaceable
neighborhood with them, to my great charge und travel; it was therefore
thought fit that I should receive some consideration and gratuity. Thus, after
mentioning the said thirty pounds, and saying, this sum I "received; and in
love to my friends, and with respect to a town and place of succor for the
distressed as aforesaid, I do acknowledge this said sum and payment a full
satisfaction; he went on in full and strong terms to confirm those lands to
said inhabitants; reserving no more to himself and his heirs than an equal
share with the rest; his wife also signing the deed.

I TRUST the reader will excuse the length of this account, when he considers
that these were the foundations of a now flourishing colony, which was laid
upon such principles as no other civil government ever had been, as we know of,
since Antichrist's first appearance; and ROGER WILLIAMS justly "claims the
honor of having been the first legislator in the word, in its latter ages, that
fully and effectually provided for and established a free, full and absolute
LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE. History of Providence. The Massachusetts were so far
from favoring this cause, that their General Court of March 12, 1638, passed
this act, viz. "Whereas a letter was sent unto this court, subscribed by John
Green, dated from New-Providence, and brought by one of that Company, wherein
the court is charged with usurping the power of Christ over the Churches and
men's consciences, notwithstanding he had formerly acknowledged his fault in
such speeches by him before used; it is now ordered, that the said John Green
shall not come into this jurisdiction, upon pain of imprisonment and further
censure. And because it appears to this court that some others of the same
place are confident in the same corrupt judgment and practice, it is ordered,
that if any other of the inhabitants of the said plantation of Providence shall
come within this jurisdiction, they shall be apprehended, and brought before
some of the magistrates, and if they will not disclaim the said corrupt opinion
and censure, they shall be commanded presently to depart, and if such persons
shall after be found within this jurisdiction they shall be imprisoned, and
punished as the court shall see cause."

Massachusetts Records.

Lamentable case indeed! that no inhabitant of that infant plantation, who were
not able to send out shipping themselves, might go into the colony, where many
of the necessaries as well as comforts of life were only to be obtained by
them; but they must either be exposed to dissemble, or to suffer imprisonment,
if not worse; for how could they honestly declare that the Massachusetts did
not usurp a power over men's consciences!




NONE might have a voice in government in this new plantation, who would not
allow this liberty. Hence about this time I find the following town act, viz.
"It was agreed that Joshua Verin, upon breach of covenant, or restraining
liberty of conscience, shall be withheld from the liberty of voting till he
shall declare the contrary." It appears from Mr. Hubbard, that the way in which
he restrained that liberty was, in not letting his wife go to Mr. Williams's
meeting so often as she was called for. Verin soon removed to Barbados, and
left his interest in Providence in such a state as has caused much trouble
since.

WE will now turn to the affairs of Rhode Island people, who on March 7, 1638,
signed the following instrument: "We whose names are underwritten do swear
solemnly, in the presence of JEHOVAH, to incorporate ourselves into a body
politic, and as he shall help us, will submit our persons, lives and estates,
unto our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and to all
those most perfect and absolute laws of his, given us in his holy word of
truth, to be guided and judged thereby.

Thomas Savage, William Dyre, William Freeborne, Philip Sherman, John Walker,
Richard Carder, William Baulstone, Edward Hutchinson, sen. Henry Bull, Randal
Holden, William Coddington, John Clarke, William Hutchinson, John Coggshall,
William Aspinwall, Samuel Wilbore, John Porter, Edward Hutchinson, jun. John
Sanford Colony Records. Of these William Hutchinson died on the island; the
other Hutchinsons, Aspinwall and Savage, went back, got reconciled, and were
promoted in the Massachusetts colony afterward. Near all the others were
considerably promoted afterward in Rhode Island colony, and have posterity
still remaining therein. All but two of the above nineteen men were disarmed by
the sentence of November 20, 1637. and which two were Messieurs Coddington and
Holden. And Messieurs Coddington, Coggshall, Baulston, E. Hutchinson, Wilbore,
Porter, Bull, Sherman, Freeborn and Carder, were all excluded or driven out of
the Massachusetts colony by an act of their Assembly, on March 12, 1638, in
these words, viz.

"Whereas you have desired and obtained license to remove yourselves and your
families out of this jurisdiction, and for that information has been given to
the court, that your intent is only to withdraw yourselves for a season, that
you may avoid the censure of the court, for some things that may be objected
against you; the court does therefore signify unto you that you may depart
according to the license given you, so as your families be removed before the
next General Court. But if your families be not so removed, then you are to
appear at the next court, to abide the further order of the court herein." Mr.
Nicholas Easton, of Newbury, who went to Newport, and Messieurs Francis Weston,
Richard Waterman, Thomas Olney, and Stukely Westcoat, of Salem, who went to
Providence, were also included in this sentence. Beside these there were
William Lytherland, Robert Harding, John Briggs, George Barden, John Odlin,
Richard Wait, and others that were disarmed at Boston, who removed into this
colony, and have left a respectful remembrance there.


."
THIS was doubtless in their view a better plan than any of the others had
laid, as they were to be governed by the perfect laws of Christ. But the
question is, how a civil polity could be so governed, when he never erected any
such state under the gospel? As much as they had been against the legal
covenant, yet they now went back to the first order of government after Israel
came into Canaan, and to imitate it chose Mr. Coddington their judge, and Mr.
Nicholas Easton, J. Coggshall, and William Brenton, elders to assist him. This
form continued, till on March 12, 1640, they altered it, and chose Mr.
Coddington Governor, Mr. Brenton Deputy Governor, and Messieurs Easton,
Coggshall, William Hutchinson, and John Porter, Assistants, Robert Jefferies
Treasurer, and William Dyre Secretary; which form continued till they received
a charter.

BUT before we proceed further upon their affairs, it may be proper to observe,
that the Assembly, who met at Boston, September 6, 1638, made the two following
laws.

1. "WHEREAS it is found by sad experience, that diverse persons, who have been
justly cast out of some of the churches, do profanely contemn the same sacred
and dreadful ordinance, by presenting themselves over-boldly in other
assemblies, and speaking lightly of their consures, to the great offense and
grief of God's people, and encouragement of evil-minded persons to contemn the
said ordinance; it is therefore ordered, that whosoever shall stand
excommunicated for the space of six months, without laboring what in him or
her lies to be restored, such person shall be presented to the Court of
Assistants, and there proceeded with by fine, imprisonment, banishment, or
further, for the good behavior, as their contempt and obstinacy upon full
hearing shall deserve." 2. "THE court taking into consideration the necessity
of an equal contribution to all common charges in towns, and observing that the
chief occasion of the defect herein arises hence, that many who are not
freemen nor members of any church, do take advantage thereby to withdraw their
help, in such voluntary, contributions as are in use; it is therefore hereby
declared, that every inhabitant in any town is liable to contribute to all
charges both in church and commonwealth whereof he does or may receive benefit;
and withal it is also ordered, that every such inhabitant who shall not
voluntarily contribute proportionably to his ability with other freemen of the
same town, to all common charges, as well for upholding the ordinances in the
churches at otherwise, shall be compelled thereto by assessment and distress,
to be levied by the constable or other officer of the town, as in other cases
Massachusetts Records.
."
HERE, my dear countrymen, let us make a little pause. Not long since, in the
presence of a number of gentlemen, mention was made of the former persecutions
in New England, upon which one of their legislators arose and said, "it is
monstrous cruelty and injustice, thus to rake up the ashes of our good fathers,
and to reproach their children therewith, when we never think of those
transactions without grief and abhorrence!" If so, why are those deeds imitated
by our present rulers? And why do the people love to have it so? Certainly the
support of good order and government in the church is of greater importance
than ministers maintenance; and to vindicate the methods then taken to support
the former of these, Mr. Cotton brought that plain text, thou shall surely kill
him, because he has sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God; and,
said he, this reason is of moral, that is, of universal "and perpetual equity
Bloody Tenet washed, p. 67.
. But I never heard any man say so of that other text, thou shall give it me
now, and if not, I will take it by force, which is the most like the practice
of many in this generation of any thing that I could ever find in our bible.
Governor Winthrop informs us, that the next May after the above laws were
passed, Mr. Cotton, in preaching from Heb. viii. 8, taught that when
"magistrates are forced to proceed for the maintenance of ministers, etc. then
the churches are in a declining state. Here he showed that the ministers
maintenance should be by voluntary contribution. But the law to empower their
executive court to punish excommunicates, for disregarding the churches
authority, was repealed the next fall, while that to maintain ministers by
assessment and distress was continued in full force; and their practice upon it
in Watertown moved Nathaniel Briscoe to write a book against it, the
consequence of which was, that he was brought before the quarter court at
Boston, March 7, 1643, and fined ten pounds; and John Stowers, for reading of
diverse "offensive passages (before company) out of a book, against the officers
and church of Watertown, and for making disturbance there, was fined forty
shillings. This severity brought Briscoe to a public acknowledgment, and then
his fine was remitted to forty shillings, and that to be "taken Massachusetts
Records.
. The ministers thus left it to the secular arm to convince him, and said, his
arguments "were not worth the answering; for he that shall deny the exerting of
the civil power, to provide for the comfortable subsistence of them that preach
the gospel, fuste potius erudiendus, quam argumento, as they say of them that
are wont, negare principia, let him that is taught communicate to him that
teaches in all good things Hubbard -- Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 427.
; that is, he that shall deny such an exertion of power, is rather to be taught
by a cudgel than argument, as they say of them who are wont to deny first
principles. But let us take heed that we are not imposed upon, by a confounding
of two things together, which are as distinct in their nature as light and
darkness are, namely duty itself, and the right way of enforcing of it. The
duty of offering daily or continual thanksgivings to our great creator, and of
a liberal communication to Christ's ministers and members, are both called
sacrifices to God, in Heb. xiii. and why do our rulers neglect to enforce the
daily exercise of family worship, by the same sword as they do ministers
maintenance? Is not God's honor of greater concernment than men's livings are!
A college was founded this year in Newtown, which for that reason was called
Cambridge; and the importance of receiving learning at that or like places, to
qualify men for the ministry, has been much insisted upon ever since; and those
who have not been educated at such places have commonly been called laymen. And
among the many reflections that have been cast upon them, one is, that they
often beg the question in argument. But who are guilty of this mean sort of
conduct now? The question between us is not, whether it be the duty of those
who are taught to communicate unto their teachers or not; but it is, whether
that duty ought to be enforced by the sword, or only by instruction, persuasion
and good example? And what have learned ministers ever done toward proving
their side of the question better than begging!

THE great events of this year have taken up considerable room, yet I must
request a place for a few articles more, that will affect the following part of
our history Mr. Hansard Knolly, came over in the spring of this year, who was
ordained by the Bishop of Peterborough June 29, 1629; but he says, "about the
year 1636 I was prosecuted in the high commission court, by virtue of a
warrant, wherewith I was apprehended in Boston (in Lincolnshire) and kept a
prisoner in the man's house who served the warrant upon me: But God helped me
to convince him, and he was so greatly terrified in his conscience, that he set
open his doors, and let me go away; but before I went, I tarried so long in
London, waiting for a passage, that when I went aboard I had but just six brass
farthings lest, and no silver nor gold, only my wife had five pounds that I
knew not of, which she gave me when we came there. By the way my little child
died with convulsion fits, our beer and water stank, our biscuit was molded and
rotten, and our cheese also, so that we suffered much hardship, being twelve
weeks in our passage; but God was gracious to us, and led us safe through the
great deeps; and ere we went on shore came one and enquired for me, and told me
a friend that was gone from Boston to Rhode Island had left me his house to
sojourn in, and to which we went, and two families more with us, who went
suddenly to their friends and other relations in the country; and I being very
poor, was necessitated to work daily with my hoe, for the space of almost three
weeks. The magistrates were told by the ministers that I was an Antinomian, and
desired they would not suffer me to abide in their patent. But within the time
limited by their law in that case, two strangers coming to Boston from
Piscataqua, hearing of me by mere accident, got me to go with them to (...)
plantation, and preach there, where I remained about four years, and then being
sent for back to England, by my aged father, I returned with my wife and one
child, about three years old, and she great with another. We came safe to
London on the 24th of December, 1641, in which year the massacre in Ireland
broke forth, and the next year wars brake forth in England, between King and
Parliament." Account of his own life. He embraced the Baptist principles,
gathered a church of that persuasion in London, and used seldom to have less
than a thousand auditors. He baptized Mr. Henry Jessey, an eminent minister in
that city, and others; suffered much for religion, continued pastor of that
church till he died in London, September 19, 1691, aged 93. Cresby. And though
he was reproached as an Antinomian, yet Dr. Mathor says he had a respectful
"character in the churches of this wilderness. Magnalia, b. 3, p. 7. After his
return to England, he suffered deeply in the "cause of nonconformity, being
universally esteemed and beloved by all his brethren. Neal, vol. 1, p. 216.
.

ON June 5 Uncas, the sachem of the Mohegan Indians, "having entertained some
of the Pequods, came to the Governor at Boston with a present, and was much
dejected because at first it was not accepted; but afterward, the Governor and
Counc^ being satisfied about his innocence, they accepted it; whereupon he
promised to submit to the orders of the English, both touching the Pequods he
had received, and as concerning the differences between the Narragansets and
himself; and confirmed all with this compliment; laying his hand upon his
heart, he said, this heart is not mine, but yours; I will never believe any
Indian against the English any more; and so he continued ever after. -- Uncas
was alive and well in the year 1680 Winthrop -- Hubbard. Mr. Hubbard dates his
coming in July, but I follow the Governor who acted in the affair. Uncas's head
quarters were about eight miles above the mouth of New London river, on the
west side of it; and though they, as well as other Indians, are greatly
diminished, yet a considerable body of that tribe remain there to this day. In
1741 a remarkable work of God was wrought among them; a church of Christian
Indians was afterward gathered, and continues there, many of whom give great
evidence of true piety. Mr. Samson Occum^is of that tribe.
.

MR. Cotton had entertained a favorable opinion of Mrs. Hutchinson, and when
she was upon examination before the court that banished her, he was asked what
he thought of her revelation concerning her deliverance? He replied, "if she
does look for for deliverance from the hand of God by his providence, and the
revelation be in a word, or according to a word, I cannot deny it." Upon which
Mr Endicot said, "you give me satisfaction." "N^, no, (said Mr. Dudley) he
gives me none at all -- Y^^ weary me, and do not satisfy me" Mr. N^^^el said,
"I think it is a devilish delusion." And Governor Winthrop said, "of all the
revelations that ever I heard of, I never heard the like ground l^^^ as is for
this. The enthusiasts and Anabaptists h^d never the like." Mr. Dudley added, "I
never law such revelations as these among Anabaptists, therefore am sorry that
Mr. Cotton should stand to justify her;" and he and others of the court would
have brought him upon trial also, but the Governor prevented it Massachusetts
History, vol. 2, p. 514, 515.
.

AFTER a year's consideration, Mr. Cotton, at a public fast, December 13, 1638,
"did confess and bewail, as the churches, so his own security and credulity,
whereupon so many and dangerous errors had gotten up, and spread in the
churches, and went over all the particulars, and showed how he came to be
deceived; the errors being formed, in words, so near the truth he had preached,
and the falsehood of the maintainers of them was such, as they usually would
deny to him what they had delivered to others. He acknowledged that such as had
been seducers of others (instancing in some of those of Rhode Island, though he
named them not) had been justly banished; yet he said such as only had been
misled, and others who had done any thing out of a misguided conscience (not
being grossly evil) should be born withal, and first referred to the church, and
if that could not heal them, they should rather be imprisoned or fined than
banished, it being likely that no other church would receive them. -- If he
were not convinced, yet he was persuaded to an amicable compliance with the
other ministers, by a studious abstaining on his part from all expressions that
were like to be offensive; for although it was thought he did still retain his
own sense, and enjoy his own apprehension, in all or most of the things then
controverted (as is manifest by some expressions of his in a treatise of the
new covenant, since published by Mr. Thomas Allen, of Norwich) yes was there an
healing of the breach that had been between him and the rest of the elders, and
a putting a stop to the course of errors in the country for the future. By that
means did that reverend and worthy minister of the gospel recover his former
splendour throughout the country of New England Winthrop -- Hubbard. Roger
Harlakenden, one of the magistrates, died at Cambridge, November 17, this year.
Winthrop. Near the same time a church was gathered at Exeter, on Piscataqua
river, and soon after Mr. Wheelwright, at his and their request, was dismissed
with others to it, from the church of Boston, and became their minister.
Hubbard. These facts help to discover the spirit of those times.
."

This year, upon an occurrence, Governor Winthrop wrote to Mr. Clarke at
Aquetneck, and styled him, a physician and a preacher to those of that "island.

We are now come to an event which has made much noise in the world, I mean Mr.
Williams's baptism. The reader may remember that he was charged with advancing
principles at Plymouth that tended to Anabaptism, and that he filled Salem
therewith; and could he have found an agreeable administrator, it is not likely
that he would have neglected the putting of this principle into practice so
long as he did. At length, being in such a state of exile in a heathen land, it
is probable he concluded that the case about baptism, which Mr. Robinson
recites, was applicable to theirs, which is in these words:

"Zanchy, upon the fifth to the Ephesians, treating of baptism, propounds a
question of a Turk coming to the knowledge of Christ, and to faith, by reading
the new testament, and withal teaching his family, and converting it and others
to Christ; and being in a country whence he cannot easily come to Christian
churches, whether he may baptize them, whom he has converted to Christ, he
himself being unbaptized? He answers, I doubt not of it but that he may, and
withal provide, that he himself be baptized of one of the three converted by
him. The reason he gives is, because he is a minister of the word
extraordinarily stirred up of Christ: And so as such a minister may, with the
consent of that small church, appoint one of the communicants, and provide that
he be baptized by him Robinson's answer to Bernard, p. 422.
.

Mr. Williams took such a method, with only this difference, that one of the
community was first appointed to baptize him, and then he baptized the rest;
for Mr. Hubbard, says he, was baptized by "one Holliman, then Mr. Williams
rebaptized him, and some ten more. With this Governor Winthrop agrees, and sets
the date of it in March, 1639. The Governor called Holliman a poor man, and
Hubbard styles him a mean fellow; but after the year 1650 I find him more than
once a deputy from the town of Warwick in their General Court. The above
gentlemen represent that Mrs. Hutchinson's sister, the wife of one Scott,
stirred Mr. Williams up to this action; though afterward Mr. Hubbard does not
pretend to certainty as to that, and says it was difficult for one to give an
exact account of their religious affairs in that colony, that did not live
among them; and it is certain that he and the Governor were both mistaken in
calling "those of Providence all Anabaptists." For it appears from under Mr.
Williams's own hand, seventeen years after, that Arnold and Carpenter, two of
the first twelve, were not such Massachusetts History, vol. 3, p. 277.
; neither have I met with any proof that Gorton, Weston or Waterman, who went
to Warwick, were ever of that denomination This Baptist church at Providence
appears to be the second distinct society of that denomination in all the
British empire. There had been many of them intermixed with other societies
from their first coming out of Popery, but their first distinct church in our
nation was formed out of the independent church in London, whereof Mr. Henry
Jacob was pastor from 1616 to 1624, when he went to Virginia, and Mr. John
Lothrop was chosen in his room. Prince's Chronology. But nine years after,
"several persons in the society, finding that the congregation kept not to
their first principles of separation, and being also convinced that baptism was
not to be administered to infants, but such only as professed faith in Christ,"
desired and obtained liberty, and formed themselves into a distinct church,
Sept. 12, 1633, having Mr. John Spilsbury for their minister. A second Baptist
church was constituted in London this year, but I believe later in the year
than ours at Providence. Crosby's History, vol. 1, p. 148, 149. Mr. Lothrop
came over to Boston in 1634, was minister a while at Situate, and then at
Barnstable. Winthrop, -- Prince.
.

Before this time Mr. Peter's was got to be minister of Salem, and he wrote to
the church of Dorchester on July 1, this year, to acquaint them that their
"great censure" was past upon Roger Williams and his wife, John Throgmorton and
his wife, Stukely Westcot and his wife, Mary Holliman, and the widow Reves, and
that all but two of these were rebaptized Massachusetts History vol. 1, p. 421.
.

Besides the above men, we are well informed that William Wickenden, Chad
Brown, and Gregory Dexter, were of this Baptist church in Providence, and in
1765 Governor Hopkins, who is not a Baptist, said, this first church of
Baptists at Providence "has from its beginning kept itself in repute, and
maintained its discipline to this day; has always been, and still is, a
numerous congregation, and in which I have with pleasure observed very lately
sundry descendents from each of the above named founders, except Holliman
History of Providence. Olney and Dexter were much improved in their day in
public offices in the colony.
. It seems he removed away.

I am sensible that this testimony is very different from the accounts of many
New England historians, who represent that the church soon broke up, because
Mr. Williams did not walk long with it. His stop in that travel Governor
Winthrop mentions in July following; and Richard Scott, who afterward turned to
the Quakers, says, I walked with him in "the Baptists way about 3 or 4 months,
in which time he brake from the society, and declared at large the ground and
reasons of it; that their baptism could not be right, because it was not
administered by an apostle. After that he set upon a way of seeking (with two or
three of them that had dissented with him) by way of preaching and praying; and
there he continued a year or two, till two of the three left him. That which
took most with him was to get honor amongst men. After his society and he in a
church way were parted, he then went to England, and there got a charter; and
coming from Boston to Providence, at Seaconk the neighbors of Providence met
him with fourteen canoes, and carried him to Providence. And the man being
hemmed in the middle of the canoes, was (...) elevated and transported out of
himself, that I was condemned in myself, that amongst the rest I had been an
instrument to set him up in his pride and folly. -- Though he professed liberty
of conscience, and was so zealous for it at the first coming home of the
charter, that nothing in government must be acted till that was granted; yet he
could be the forwardest in their government to prosecute against those that
could not join with him in it; as witness his presenting of it to the court at
Newport Scott's letter in George Fox's answer to Williams, 1677, p. 247.
.

Thus Quakers, as well as Paedobaptists, could cast out hard reflections
against him; whether justly or not, the reader when he has heard the whole
story will judge. At present I would only remark, that this man had been Mr.
Williams's neighbor 38 years when he wrote this letter, and the spirit of it
fully proves that he was not prejudiced at all in his or the Baptist's favor;
yet the facts according to him were, that but two or three persons went off
with Mr. Williams, leaving the rest in a church way still; neither does he say
a word of Mr. Williams's expecting to be an apostle himself. Indeed as to that
point, Mr. Hubbard goes no further than to say, "expecting (as was supposed) to
become an apostle;" and Governor Winthrop has the same parenthesis; so that it
was no more than a supposition in that day, but a late historian has delivered
it off as fact, without the parenthesis; and Dr. Mather, from his grandfather
Cotton, says they broke "forth into Anabaptism, and then to Antibaptism and
Familism, and now finally into no church at all Magnalia, b. 7, p. 9.
. Such naked untruths have one generation after another told about these people!

An evident cause of Mr. Williams's refraining from a farther proceeding in
church ordinances, was an apprehension of the necessity of a visible succession
of regular ordinations from the apostles, to empower men to it, which
succession he could not find: Yet how fond are many ministers in our day of
this successive notion? A minister's preaching upon it was vindicated in the
Boston Evening-Post of May 9, 1774, which informs us that the preacher said,
"God the Father sent forth the Son; he sent forth the apostles as the Father
sent him; they sent forth others, with command to commit these things to
faithful men. And the preacher said that Christ had never committed this power
(to put into office) to any but such as were in office; and consequently no
other had a power to put out of office. But I am not afraid boldly to assert,
that I verily believe, according to this doctrine, there is not a minister this
day under heaven but what must stop from administering baptism, as Mr. Williams
did, if they were as honest as he was. A minister in Connecticut a few years
ago published a pamphlet to support the above opinion; wherein, to get over the
difficulty that arises for want of any proof of such a lineal succession, he
observed that none under the law were to be priests but the lawful posterity of
Aaron; yet supposing a bastard son of that family should have posterity, in so
long a succession that the knowledge of his illegitimacy was lost, he asserted
that such priests might well be admitted into office with others. According to
which doctrine, knowledge must be very detrimental to such priests, and
ignorance must be the mother of such devotion. The minister who published said
pamphlet is a trustee of Yale College; and likely he is better acquainted with
philosophy and school divinity than he is with his bible, or else he would have
known that Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven (in
distinction from all earthly gods) refused to admit or suffer men upon
negatives: And such as sought, but could not find THEIR REGISTER, were, as
polluted, put from the priesthood. Ezra ii. 62. And if we review the text that
is now so much harped upon, we shall find that the apostolic succession is in
the line of faithful men, and no others are truly in it, though false brethren
have sometimes crept in unawares.

Mr. John Spilsbury, pastor of the first Baptist church in London, says,
because some think to "shut up the ordinance of God in such a strait, that none
can come by it but through the authority of the popedom of Rome; let the reader
consider who baptized John the Baptist before he baptized others, and if no man
did, then whether he did not baptize others, he himself being unbaptized. We
are taught by this what to do upon the like occasion. I fear men put more than
is of right due to it, that so prefer it above the church, and all other
ordinances; for they can assume and erect a church, take in and cast out
members, elect and ordain officers, and administer the supper, and all anew,
without looking after succession, any further than the scriptures; but as for
baptism, they must have that successively from the apostles, though it comes
through the hands of Pope Joan. What is the cause of this, that men can do all
from the WORD but only baptism?

The learned Mr. John Tombs also in that day produced the foregoing passage
from Zanchy, for the same purpose that I have now done Crosby, vol. 1, p. 103
-- 105.
.

I would just add, that though the express rule to Israel was, that every male
must needs be circumcised at eight days old, or be cut off from their people,
yet this general rule was so far dispensed with in a particular case, that
circumcision was omitted forty years in the wilderness; and multitudes of them
stood before God, and entered into or renewed their father Abraham's covenant
in the plains of Moab, who yet were not circumcised till after they came over
Jordan. Deuteronomy. xxix. Joshua v. 4 -- 7. But the Christian church had been through
a worse wilderness than that of Arabia, between the apostolic age and that we
are now treating of; therefore that ancient example seems to give light in the
case before us.

Mr. Pelatiah Mason, who was born near Providence ferry in 1669, told his sons
(three of whom are now public preachers in Swanzey) that he heard from the
fathers of that day, that in the trial they then had, they heard that the Queen
of Hungary, or some in those parts, had a register of a regular succession from
the apostles, and had thoughts of sending Mr. Thomas Olney (who succeeded Mr.
Williams as their pastor) into that country for it; but at length concluded
that such a course was not expedient, but believing they were now got into the
right way, determined to persevere therein.

Mr. Hubbard speaking of that colony says, "as to matters of religion, it was
hard to give an exact account to the world of their proceedings therein, by any
who have not been conversant with them from the beginning of their plantations;
yet this was commonly said by all that ever had any occasion to be among them,
that they always agreed in this principle, that no man or company of men ought
to be molested by the civil power upon the account of religion, or for any
opinion received or practiced in any matter of that nature; accounting it no
small part of their happiness that they may therein be left to their own
liberty; by which means the inhabitants are of many different persuasions. But
what tendency that liberty had, by so long experience, toward the promoting of
the power of godliness, and purity of religion, they are best able to judge
that have had occasion to be most conversant amongst them."

By this and many other passages, that learned writer, as well as Governor
Winthrop, discovered more candor of mind toward Mr. Williams and Rhode Island
colony, than almost any other of the Massachusetts writers have ever done,
first or last. Mr. Hubbard says, "at Rhode Island they gathered a church, but
in a very disordered way; taking in some excommunicate persons, and others
which were members of the church of Boston, but not dismissed; -- yet had they
afterward one Mr. Clarke for their minister, who had been bred to learning."

At the General Court at Boston, March 13, 1639, "John Smith, for disturbing
the public peace, by combining with others to hinder the orderly gathering of a
church at Weymouth, and to set up another there, contrary to the orders here
established, and the constant practice of all our churches, and for undue
procuring the hands of many to a blank for that purpose, is fined 20 l. and
committed during the pleasure of the court or the council.

"Richard Silvester, for going with Smith to get hands to a blank, was
disfranchised and fined forty shillings.

"Ambrose Morton, for calling the church covenant a stinking carrion, and a

in the sharp, and said the ministers did dethrone Christ and set up themselves,
he was fined 10 l. and counseled to go to Mr. Mather to be instructed by him

. Thomas Mackpeace, because of his novel disposition, was informed we were
weary of him unless he reformed.

"The fourth of the 2d month was thought fit for a day of humiliation, to seek
the face of God, and reconciliation with him by our Lord Jesus Christ in all
the churches. Novelties, oppression, Atheism, excess, superfluity, idleness,
contempt of authority, and troubles in other parts, to be remembered.

"Mr. Robert Lenthal, upon his free acknowledgment under his hand, given into
the court, was appointed to appear at the next court, and enjoined to
acknowledge his fault, and give satisfaction to the church at Weymouth, and to
give a copy of that he gave into the court to the church of Weymouth.

"John Smith and John Spur are bound in 40 l. to pay 20 l. the first day of the
next court Massachusetts Records. Their crime was this, Mr Lenthal held, that
only baptism was the door of entrance into the "visible church; the common sort
of people did eagerly embrace his opinion, and some labored to get such a
church on foot, as all baptized ones might communicate without any further
trial of them; for this end they procured many hands in Weymouth to a blank,
intending to have Mr. Lenthal's advice to the form of the call. -- Mr. Lenthal,
having before conferred with some of the magistrates and ministers, did openly
and freely retract -- so the court forbore any further censure, though it was
much urged by some. Hubbard. The next court Smith was fined 5 l. more for
contempt; but upon making his submission, and presenting his money, he got
released by paying 15 l. Massachusetts Records.
."

Mr. Lenthal went to Rhode Island, was admitted a freeman there on August 6,
1640; and he kept school and preached there for a while, but before March,
1642, was gone for England. The first settlement of the island began the same
spring they purchased it, the second the spring after; the latter of which was
named Newport, on May 16, 1639; the other was called Portsmouth, at a general
court, March 12, 1640.

At a General Court at Boston, Oct. 8, 1640, "it is ordered, that the letter
lately sent to the Governor by Mr. Eaton, Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Haynes, Mr.
Coddington, and Mr. Brenton, but coming also to the General Court, shall be
thus answered by the Governor, that the court does assent to all the
propositions laid down in the aforesaid letter, but that the answer shall be
directed to Mr. Eaton, Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Haynes only, excluding Mr.
Coddington and Mr. Brenton, as men not to be capitulated withal by us, either
for themselves or the people of the island where they inhabit, as their case
stands Massachusetts Records. They at this court granted to Mr. John
Winthrop, junior, all their right to Fisher's Island, which, still belongs to
his pesterity.
." Eaton was of New Haven, the other of Connecticut, which had no more of a
charter from England than Rhode Island had; therefore it was a difference about
religious affairs that caused this partiality.

"Our neighbors of Plymouth had procured from hence this year one Mr. Chauncy,
a great scholar and a godly man, intending to call him to the office of a
teacher; but before the fit time came, he discovered his judgment about
baptism, that the children ought to be dipped, and not sprinkled. There arose
much trouble about it. The magistrates and the elders there, and the most of
the people, withstood the reviving of that practice, not for itself so much as
for fear of worse consequences; as the annihilating our baptism, etc. Whereupon
the church there wrote to all the other churches, both here and at Connecticut,
etc. for advice, and sent Mr. Chauncy's arguments. The churches took them into
consideration, and wrote several answers, wherein they showed their dissent
from his, and clearly confuted all his arguments; -- yet he could not give over
his opinion; and the church of Plymouth, being much taken with his able parts,
were very loath to part with him. He did maintain also that the Lord's supper
ought to be administered in the evening, and every Lord's day. And the church at
Sandwich (where one Mr. Leveridge was minister) fell into the practice of it.
But that being a matter of no great ill consequence, save some outward
inconvenience, there was little stir about it. This Mr. Chauncy was after
called to office in the church of Situate Winthrop's Journal.
.

At a quarter cour at Boston, Dec. 1, "the jury found Hugh Buet to be guilty of
heresy, and that his person and errors are dangerous for infection of others.
It is ordered that the said Hugh Buet should be gone out of our jurisdiction by
the 24th present, upon pain of death, and not to return upon pain of being
hanged." This is the first instance that I find upon the Massachusetts records
of banishment for heresy upon this penalty. Two years before they banished
three persons at once, on pain of death, for adultery. The records give no
account of what Buet's heresy was, but Governor Winthrop says, it was "for
holding he was free from original sin, and from actual also, for half a year
before, and for holding that true Christians are enabled to live without
committing actual sin."

The learned upon pious Mr. Henry Dunstar came over this summer, and on August
27 weas chosen President of Harvard College, which flourished under his care
and influence fourteen years; till having openly renounced infant baptism, such
a temper was manifested against him on that account, that he resigned that
office Magnalia, b. 4, p. 127, 128.
." About this time it appears by Mr. Hooker's letters, that many inclined
toward the Baptist way, and he expressed his apprehensions that the number
would increase Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 227.
; which it seems moved him to "resolve that he would have an argument able to
remove a mountain before he would recede from" infant baptism. This resolution
Mr. Mitchel, thirteen years after, adopted from him, as a shield against Mr.
Dunstar's arguments. Mitchel's Life, p. 70.

sold his plantation at Lynn to the lady Moody, and returned to England.

of those at Aquidnet turned professed Anabaptists. Winthrop.
. Mr. Hubbard says, Nicholas Easton used to teach at Newport, and m^^tained,
"that man had no power nor will in him^^, but as he ^as acted by God; and
seeing that God filled all things, nothing could be or move but by him, and so
must needs be the author of sin, and that a Christian is united to the essence
of God. Being showed what blasphemous consequences would follow therefrom, they
seemed to abhor the consequences, but sill defended the position. -- Mr.
Coddington, Mr. Coggshall, and some others, joined with Nicholas Easton in
those delusions; but their minister, Mr. Clarke, Mr. Lenthal and Mr. Harding,
with some others, dissented and publicly opposed; whereby it grew to such a
heart of contention that it made a schism amongst them." Mr. Coddington and Mr.
Easton afterward joined the Quakers, Mr. Clarke and his friends formed the
first Baptist church on Rhode Island.

In June this year the General Assembly of the Massachusetts sent to Plymouth
to know why they might not take Seaconk into their jurisdiction; they tried for
it about three years, till the commissioners of the united colonies confirmed
it to Plymouth.

At a quarte^ court at Boston, Sept. 7, Mr. William Collins, a man of learning,
who had married Mrs. Hutchinson's daughter, being "found a seducer;" and
Francis Hutchinson, for calling the church of Boston "a whore," etc. were both
fined and banishep upon pain of death. Massachusetts Records.
. About two years after they were both killed by the Indians, with their mother
Hutchinson, toward New York. It is evident that the planters of Rhode Island
did not at first see into the true nature and grounds of liberty of conscience,
but their assembly at Portsmouth, Mar. 16, 1641, passed an act for that
purpose, which on the 17th of Sept. following was confirmed as a perpetual law.
And at an assembly in Newport, Sept. 19, 1642, they appointed Messrs.
Coddington, Brenton, Easton, Coggshall, Baulston, Porter, Dyer, Clarke, Harding
and Jefferies, a committee to improve the first and best opportunity that
presented to send home for a charter, and to write to Sir Henry Vene to solicit
his assistance and influence in the design. They accordingly sent over by Mr.
Williams, and obtained their request; though in the mean time a most dreadful
broil broke out, and prevailed to a terrible degree among them, of which take
the following account.

Samuel Gorton, a man of learning from London, arrived at Boston in 1636, and
doubtless had a considerable hand in the mystical disputes that then embroiled
them. From thence he went to Plymouth, where he treated their pastor Mr. Smith
in such a manner, as caused the authority to take him in hand, and required
bonds of him for his good behavior. This occasioned his departure to
Rhode Island, where such a difficulty arose, that by Mr. Coddington's order he
was imprisoned and whipped. From thence he came to Providence, where he was
kindly treated by Mr. Williams and others; and he and his friends sat down at
Pawtuxet, now called Cranston. I find by the records that Mr. Gorton bought
half of Robert Cole's interest there on Jan. 10, 1641. And as the court at
Newport in March following disfranchised Richard Carder, Randal Holden, Sampson
Shatton, and Robert Potter, they and John Wickes. who had followed Gorton from
Plymouth, came and formed a considerable party at Pawtuxet. And such a
contention was raised between them and the former inhabitants, as they came
armed into the "field, each against other; but Mr. Williams pacified them for
the present. This caused the weaker party to write a letter to the
Massachusetts rulers, complaining of the wrong they suffered, desiring aid, or
if not, counsel from us. We answered them, that we could not levy war without a
General Court. For counsel we told them, that except they would submit to some
jurisdiction (Plymought, or etc.) we had no calling or warrant to interpose in
their contentions, but if they would submit to any, then they had a call to
protect them. Winthrop -- Hubbard.
How different was the temper here discovered, from that of the pious Mr.
Williams? He was ever ready wherever he came to exert all his influence to make
peace so far as he could with a good conscience, but the court at Boston seemed
willing to play one party against another, till all would submit to their
power. Gorton took a like method to defend himself against them; the
consequence of which was terrible indeed; the true state whereof I shall give
with all the exactness I can.

William Arnold, Robert Cole, William Carpenter, and Benedict Arnold, of
Pawtuxet, went to the General Assembly at Boston, Sept. 8, 1642, and submitted
themselves and their lands to that government. At the same time Mr. Leveret and
Edward Hutchinson were sent to Miantinomu to demand satisfaction of him, and
first to tell him "of credible information received, partly by relation of the
Indians themselves, that they have drawn in many other Sachems to join with the
Narragansets, in making war upon the English." Benedict Arnold and Ahauton, the
Indian, were to be their guides and interpreters Hubbard -- Massachusetts
Records.
. Then, October 28, a warrant was sent from Boston to cite Gorton and his
friends to come to their court, to answer to the complaints of Arnold's company
against them, signed by the Governor and three assistants. To this an answer
was returned on Nov. 20, signed by Samuel Gorton, Randal Holden, Robert Potter,
John Wickes, John Warner, Richard Waterman, William Woodale, John Green,
Francis Weston, Richard Carder, Nicholas Power and Sampson Shatton. It
contained a long mystical paraphrase upon their warrant, and many provoking
sentences against those rulers and their ministers, and a refusal to come to
them. But in order to get out of their reach they removed and purchased
Shawomet for 144 fathoms of wampum, and obtained a deed of it, signed by
Miantinomu, Pomham, and others, on Jan. 12, 1643. John Green had received a
deed of an island, neck of land and meadow, called Ocupassutuxet-cove, dated
October 1, 1642, signed by Miantinomu and Socononco Gorton's Defense --
Callender -- Colony Records. The 144 fathom of peag it is said was computed at
40 l. 16 s. sterling. Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 118.
.

The General Court at Boston, May 10, 1643, appointed Mr. Atherton and Tomlyns,
with William Arnold to speak with Mr. Green, Warner, and their company. On
June 22 through Benedict Arnold's influence and assistance, Pumham, Sachem of
Shawomet, and Sacanocho, Sachem of Pawtuxet, signed at Boston a submission of
their persons and lands to that government; and Arnold was allowed 4 l. for his
pains Massachusetts Records. The colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth,
Connecticut and New Haven, by their commissioners; signed articles of
confederation together for mutual assistance and defense on May 19, 1643, from
whence they were called the united colonies.
. Governor Winthrop tells us that they had 2 or 300 men under them. The plea
for this action was, that Gorton's company and Miantinomu had oppressed these
Sachems, and wronged them of their lands. Pumham said he was forced to sign the
deed, but would take none of the pay. The Governor, with another magistrate,
wrote to Shawomet people about it; and also to Miantinomu, and he came down and
met said Sachems at Boston, where they were forced to confess that they had
sometimes sent him presents, and had aided him in his wars against the Pequods;
yet they and Arnold would have it, that they were as free Sachems as he was,
because their people paid tribute to them. So the court received them (as is
before noted) under their protection. We are told that before this, Gorton and
his company had sent a writing of four sheets, full of reproaches against the
"magistrates, ministers and churches, and stuffed likewise with absurd
familistial stuff, and wherein they justified the purchase of the Sachems
lands, and professed to maintain it to the death Hubbard.
.

Miantinomu had already seen Uncas, a warlike Sachem to the west of him,
putting himself and his people under the protection of the English; and he was
accused of hiring a young Pequod to murder Uncas, but he brought the young man
with him, who told the court that Uncas cut his own arm with a flint, and then
charged him to report that Miantinomu had hired him to murder him. But upon
private examination, the court were persuaded the young man was guilty, and
advised Miantinomu to send him to Uncas; but instead of doing it, he cut off
his head by the way, as he returned home Johnson, p. 182 -- 184.
. What followed till his own death, we have recorded by Governor Winthrop, in a
more distinct and clear light than has ever been published, I shall therefore
give it to the reader in his own words.

August. "Onkus being provoked by Sequassion, a Sachem of Connecticut (who
would not be persuaded by the magistrates there to a reconciliation) made war
upon him, and slew diverse of his men, and burnt up his wigwams; whereupon
Miantinomu, being his kinsman, took offense against Onkus, and went with near
one thousand men, and set upon Onkus before he could be provided for defense;
for he had not then with him above three or four hundred men. But it pleased
God to give Onkus the victory, after he had killed about thirty of the
Narragansets, and wounded many more: And among these, two of Canonicus's sons,
and a brother of Miantinomu, who fled; for having on a coat of mail Johnson
calls it a Corsl^t, and both he and Hubbard say he had it of Corton.
, he was easily overtaken, which two of his captains perceiving, they laid hold
of him and carried him to Onkus, hoping thereby to procure their own pardon.
But so soon as they came to Onkus he slew them presently; and Miantinomu
standing mute, he demanded of him, why he would not speak? If you had taken me
(says he) I would have besought you for my life, etc. The news of Miantinomu's
captivity coming to Providence, Gorton and his company wrote a letter to Onkus,
willing him to deliver their friend Miantinomu, and threatened him with the
power of the English if he refused. Upon this Onkus carries Miantinomu to
Hartford to take advice of the magistrates there; and, at Miantinomu's earnest
entreaty, he left him with them, yet as a prisoner. They kept him under guard,
but used him very courteously. So he continued till the commissioners of the
united colonies met at Boston In September.
, who taking into serious consideration what was safest and best to be done,
were all of opinion that it would not be safe to set him at liberty; neither
had we sufficient ground for us to put him to death. In this difficulty we
called in five of the most judicious elders (it being in the time of the
general assembly of the elders) and propounding the case to them, they all
agreed that he ought to be put to death. Upon this concurrence we enjoined
secresy upon ourselves and them, lest if it should come to the notice of the
Narragansets, they might attempt somewhat against Hartford for this reason, or
might set upon the commissioners, etc. upon their return, to take some of them
to redeem him (as Miantinomu himself had told Mr. Haynes had been in
consultation amongst them) and agreed that upon the return of the commissioners
to Hartford, they should send for Onkus, and tell him our determination, that
Miantinomu should be delivered to him again, and he should put him to death so
soon as he came within his own jurisdiction, and that the English should go
along with him to see the execution. And if any Indians should invade him for
it, we would send men to defend him. If Onkus should refuse to do it, then
Miantinomu should be sent in a pinnace to Boston, there to be kept until
further consideration.

"The reasons of this proceeding with him were these: 1. It was now clearly
discovered to us that there was a general conspiracy among the Indians to cut
off the English, and that Miantinomu was the head and contriver of it. 2. He
was of a turbulent and proud spirit, and would never be at rest. 3. Although he
had promised us in the open court to send the Pequod to Onkus, who had shot him
in the arm, with intent to have killed him (which was by the procurement of
Miantinomu, as did probably appear) yet in his way homeward he killed him. 4.
He beat one of Pumham's men, and took away his wampam, and then bid him go and
complain to the Massachusetts. According to this agreement the commissioners,
at their return to Connecticut, sent for Onkus, and acquainted him herewith,
who readily undertook the execution; and taking Miantinoma along with him, in
the way between Hartford and Windsor (where Onkus has some men dwell) Onkus's
brother following after Miantinomu, clave his head with an hatcher, some
English being present. And that the Indians might know that the English did
approve of it, they sent 12 or 14 musketeers home with Onkus to abide a time
with him, for his defense, if need should be Winthrop.
."


Alas! when good men get into an evil path, where will it carry them? The next
news we hear is as follows. September 12, the General Court sent a warrant to
require Gorton and his company to come to Boston, to answer the Indians
complaints against them. To which they sent a verbal answer, that they were out
of that jurisdiction, and would own subjection to none but the government of
Old. England. Upon which the court wrote the 19th, informing them that they
intended to send commissioners for to seek to right these things among them
Gorton's Defense.
. The commissioners were, Captain George Cook, Humphry Atherton, and Edward
Johnson, who were sent, with forty able men to attend "them, which have
authority and order to bring Samuel Gorton and his company, if they do not give
them satisfaction. A Major General was appointed in the colony, and the country
put into a posture of was. They of Aquidneck are granted "to buy a barrel of
powder, pro^ded Lieutenant Morris give caution that it be employed for the
defense of the island, by the advice of the Governor and Deputy. It is ordered
that the deputies should acquaint the elders, to desire them in special manner
to commend this undertaking to God

A large commitee of magistrates and deputies were appointed in the recess of
the General Court, "not knowing (say they) what may fall out, concerning the
expedition now on foot against Samuel Gorton, and the rest of that company.

"It is ordered that Pumham and Sochonoco should have, each of them, lent them
a fowlingpiece, and Benedict Arnold has liberty to supply them with powder and
shot as he sees occasion Massachusetts Records.
.

Hearing of their coming, Gorton's company sent a letter to meet them, dated
September 28, to let them know, that if they came in a way of loving
neighborhood, they were welcome; but if with a band of soldiers, they charged
them not to set foot on their land at their peril. The commissioners wrote a
reply, signifying their great desire of having conversation with them, with
hope of reclaiming them from their errors; but if that could not be done, that
they should then look upon them as "men prepared for slaughter, and accordingly
should address themselves with all convenient speed; which we may well suppose
was very surprising to their wives and children, and it is said it scattered
and occasioned some of their deaths. Some of the people of Providence went with
those commissioners and soldiers, and procured a parley with Shawoment men, who
demanded the reason of this proceeding; to which the others answered, that they
had done wrong to certain of their subjects, and also held blasphemous errors.
Shawomet men offered to appeal to England, but that was refused; then they
offered to leave the controversy to indifferent men in this country. This
appeared so reasonable that a truce was agreed upon, till they could send to
Boston to know the mind of the court upon it. And Chad Brown, Thomas Olney,
William Field, and William Wickenden, of Providence, wrote a letter to persuade
the rulers of the Massachusetts to comply with this proposal. But an answer was
returned, dated October 3, refusing any such thing Gorton's Defense.
. After this those men were seized and forcibly carried to Boston, where the
General Court by adjournment met October 17, when the accusation following was
exhibited, viz.

"The charge of the prisoners, Samuel Gorton and his company.

"Upon much examination and serious considerations of your writings, with your
answers about them, we do charge you to be a blasphemous enemy of the true
religion of our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy ordinances, and also of all
civil authority among the people of God, and particularly in this jurisdiction.

"It is ordered that Samuel Gorton shall be confined to Charlestown, there to
be set on work, and to wear such bolts or irons as may hinder his escape, and
to continue during the pleasure of the court; provided that if he shall break
his said confinement, or shall in the mean time, either by speech or writing,
publish, declare or maintain any of the blasphemous or abominable heresies
wherewith he has been charged by the General Court, contained in either of the
two books sent unto us by him or Randal Holden; or shall reproach or reprove
the churches of our Lord Jesus Christ in these united colonies, or the civil
government, or the public ordinaces of God therein (unless it be by answer to
some questions propounded to him, or conferrence with any elder, or any other
licenced to speak with him privately under the hand of one of the assistants)
that immediately upon accusation of any such writing or speech, he shall, by
such assistant to whom such accusation shall be brought, be committed to prison
till the next court of assistants, then and there to be tried by a jury,
whether he has so spoken or written, and upon conviction thereof shall be
condemned and executed. Dated the third of the ninth month, 1643."

A like sentence was passed, by which John Wicke^ was confined to Ipswick,
Randal Holden to Salem, Robert Potter to Rowley, Richard Carder to Roxbury,
Francis Weston to Dorchester, and John Warner to Boston; all on the fame
penalty with Gorton. William Woodale was confined to Watertown during the
pleasure of the court, and if he escaped to be punished as they see meet.
Further,

"It is ordered, that all such cattle of Samuel Gorton, John Green I cannot
find that Green was carried now to Boston. Hubbard says Woodale was found to
be an ignorant young man.
, etc. as have been or shall be seized upon, for such satisfaction of charges
as the country has been put unto, by sending and fetching them in, and other
charges about the trial in the court, and expense in the prison or otherwise,
shall be appraised and fold to the most advantage, and disposed of accordingly,
and the overplus to be reserved by the treasurer for their maintenance. -- If
any of them will not do such work as they may, and as shall be appointed them,
they are to be left to shift as they may.

"Richard Waterman is dismissed for the present, so that what is taken of his,
is to go toward payment of the charge, and the rest of his estate is bound in
100 l. that the shall appear at the General Court the third month, and not
depart without license, and to submit to the order of the court.

"Nicholas Power appearing, and denying that he set his hand to the first book,
was dismissed with an admonition.

"For appraising the cattle brought from Providence, the prisoners have liberty
to name two, Robert Turner and the soldiers two, and the court one. The
prisoners refusing, the court, Robert Turner, and the soldiers, chose Mr.
Colbron, John Jephson and William Parks Massachusetts Records. Nicholas Power,
and many of his posterity have been of good note among the Eaptisls in
Providence. Hubbard says he was released "freely, for that he was "in his
master's house"
." The whole of the aforesaid charges were adjudged to amount to an hundred and
sixty pounds. They were detained through the winter under the above sentence;
but finding that they could not keep them from seducing "others, not yet bring
them to any sight of their folly and wickedness, the General Court (March 7,
1644) sent them away Hubbard.
. Ah, sent them away sure enough! it was with the words following, viz.

"It is ordered that Samuel Gorton and the rest of that company, who now stand
confined, shall be set at liberty, provided that if they or any of them shall,
after fourteen days after such enlargement, come within any part of our
jurisdiction, either in the Massachusetts, or in or near Providence, or any of
the lands of Pomham and Soconocho, or elsewhere within our jurisdiction, then
such person or persons shall be apprehended, wheresoever they may be taken, and
shall suffer death by course of law: Provided also, that during all their
continuance in our bounds inhabiting for the said time of fourteen days, they
shall be still bound to the rest of the articles of their former confinement,
upon the penalty therein expressed Massachusetts Records.
."

Such a way of treating our fellow servants as this, will doubtless appear very
surprising to the present generation; and many will be ready to say, how was it
possible for any, if they had been endowed with the least spark of
Christianity, or even humanity, to treat their neighbors as those rulers did?
Let Captain Johnson, who was one of the three commissioners that took them,
answer the question; says he,

"That holy man of God, Mr. John Cotton, among many others, has diligently
searched for the Lord's mind herein, and has declared some sudden blow to be
given to this blood thirsty monster (the man of sin) but the Lord has
inseparably joined the time, means and manner of this work together; and
therefore all men that expect the day (of his fall) must attend the means. And
speaking of Gorton and his company, he says, "to be sure there be them in
New England that have Christ Jesus and his blessed ordinances in such esteem,
that the Lord assisting, they had rather lose their lives, than suffer them to
be thus blasphemed, if they can help it; and whereas some have favored them,
and endeavored to bring under blame such as have been zealous against their
abominable doctrines, the good God be favorable unto them, and prevent them
from coming under the like blame with Ahab; yet they remain in their old way,
and there is somewhat to be considered in it to be sure, that in these days,
when all look for the fail of Antichrist, such detestable doctrines should be
upheld, and persons suffered, that exceed the beast himself for blasphemy, and
this to be done by those that would be counted reformers, and such as seek the
utter subversion of Antichrist Johnson's History, p. 187, 230.
.

This plain account of the reasons and motives they acted upon, takes off the
edge in some measure of Gorton's keen satire upon them, which he wrote from
Warwick, Sept. 16, 1656, to the first Quakers that were imprisoned in Boston,
saying, I marvel "what manner of God your adversaries trust in, who is so
fearful of being infected with error, or how they think they shall escape the
wiles and power of the devil, when the arm of flesh fails them, whereby they
seek to defend themselves for the present; sure they think their God will be
grown to more power and care over them, in and after death, or else they will
be loath to pass through it. Which remark is cutting indeed, if we leave out any
consideration of duty in the case; but if that be brought in, then it is
presumption, and not faith, to expect protection and support from God in a way
of disregard of the means of his appointment. Hence, the error of supposing
that God has appointed the use of secular force in religious affairs, ought to
bear all the blame and scandal of those cruel proceedings; and instead of
venting our resentment against our dead fathers, let these things rouse the
living to repentance and reformation. Those fathers could find warrant enough
in the old testament for the use of force against idolaters and blasphemers;
but the use of force to collect the priests support was plainly censured in
those time. With what face then can those who profess to be under the law of
liberty, forcibly take a farthing from any to maintain professed ministers of
HIM who has said, freely ye have received, freely give; and who commanded his
disciples to shake off, and therefore not to carry away, so much as the dust of
a city or house that would not receive them!

It is likely that the reader would want to know what Gorton's sentiments
really were, which were so offensive. To this I answer, that he evidently was a
man of smart capacity, and of considerable learning, and when he pleased could
express his ideas as plainly as any man; but he used such a mystical method in
handling the scriptures, and in speaking about religion, that people are not
agreed to this day in what his real sentiments were. It is so common for
parties to misrepresent the opinions of their opponents, that little regard is
paid by many to what the Massachusetts have said against him. I will therefore
give a taste of what he published to the world, not in a way of controversy,
but of friendly correspondence with the aforesaid prisoners at Boston. He first
wrote a letter to them of the date I have given; to which they returned an
answer; then he made a reply, October 6, 1656, wherein he gives various remarks
upon the sentiments expressed in their letter, and says,

"In us a child is born, in us a son is given Observe the word of truth says,
unto us, but this perverter of scripture says, in us.
, but the government is upon his shoulder, and he is called wonderful
Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace: So
that wherever this lowly and meek spirit is, there is also the spirit of the
Lion of the tribe of Judah, and the Lord thereby shall roar out of Zion, and
utter his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake, but
the Lord is the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.
True lowliness of spirit, and the loftiest mind that ever was, are never
separated; for these twain are made one so as never to be separated, no more
than a child (in point of all human abilities) and the Ancient of Days shall;
for as we receive the kingdom of heaven as a little child, so we are never
otherwise in the same respect, which we know, no wisdom human, serpentine, or
upon principles proper to a creature, can ever yield unto, or find out; and
therefore we are fools unto the world, being bereaved of all their principles,
in regard of any exercise of them according to their proper intent in any of
our designs -- And therefore as brute beasts are unto them, so are they to us
in the things of God. Again he says, we conclude that the "wisdom of God,
though become foolishness unto the world, yet does it contain sufficiency of
power in argument to overtop any council, synod, synedrim or assembly,
composed by human art and learning. -- For as it is in that way of the devil,
to propose his temptations from the letter of the scriptures, to subdue Christ
thereby; so is there sufficiency of spirit and wisdom, in the true
interpretation thereof, to confound and bring them (in the party proposing
them) to naught. A Christian is still saying, let there be light, and it is so;
he shall ever divide the light from the darkness, and the waters that are above
the firmament from the waters that are below the outspread firmament. In a
word, he is for ever to form all things out of that ancient chaos of God and
man being made one." Once more he says, if I witness to the Son, word, light,
life, law, or peace of God, I must witness unto the being of such a thing, that
such a thing is, as also to the manner of its being, how it comes to be such a
thing, together with its necessary and proper operations, which must inevitably
accompany such a manner of being, with the comprehensions and extensions of
such operations and motion, or else I am not that faithful and true witness,
the beginning of the creation of God, or that head and masterpiece of his work
These letters are annexed to a book he published in 1656, p. 272 -- 294.


These extracts from his own writings, may give the reader some idea of his way
of handling the scriptures. Our Savior vanquished the tempter by appealing to
what was written, and showing thereby that Satan perverted the text he
pretended to quote; but the lofty mind of this writer soared so much above that
method, as to say of the world of mankind, as brute beasts are unto them, so
are "they to us in the things of God. Well therefore might Mr. Williams say, "I
am no more of Master Gorton's religion than of Master Cotton's; and yet if
Master Cotton complain of their obstinacy in their way, I cannot but impute it
to his bloody tenet and practice, which ordinarily gives strength, vigor,
spirit and resolution to the most erroneous, when such unrighteous and most
unchristian proceedings are exercised against them Reply to Cotton, p. 123.
." Besides their difference about gospel doctrines, they evidently differed in
the following points of practice. 1. Mr. Williams used great plainness of
speech, so that his meaning was obvious to common understandings; but Mr.
Gorton's writings are not so. 2. Mr. Williams openly stood for what he believed
to be the truth, in the face of the greatest danger; but when Mr. Gorton saw
himself greatly exposed in Boston, he explained their mystical writings in such
a manner, that Governor Winthrop said, "he could agree with him in his answer,
though not in their writings Gorton's Defense.
." 3. Mr. Williams set a noble example of overcoming evil with good; but Mr.
Gorton was sadly ensnared in rendering evil for evil, and railing for railing.
Though after he had been to England, and obtained liberty to return to and
enjoy the lands they had purchased, he and sundry of his suffering companions
became very useful members of civil society. But as corruption is ever the most
dangerous when covered with a religious mask, it is of great importance for us
all to learn to distinguish between that and true religion. Paul said to the
contending Corinthians, are ye not carnal and walk as men? The same query may
be made concerning those contentions betwixt Gorton and his opponents.


The Massachusetts professed a high regard to their charter, when they banished
Mr. Williams; but that gave them no right to any land or government, further
than three miles south of their bay, and of every part of Charles rives; and
that line crosses the great post road near landlord Maxcy's, in Attleborough,
from whence to Pawtuxet river is 19 miles, and Shawomet is still further
southward; yet we are plainly told that Arnold and his company were received
partly to draw in the rest, either "under themselves or Plymouth. Hubbard. And
when Gorton and his friends were got out of Arnold's reach, two petty sachems
were taken in to found a claim upon, though it was known that Miantinomu was so
much above them, that he sold Providence and Pawtuxet over their heads some
years before, in which was contained the best title that Arnold's company had
to their lands. What work then did they make, in first enticing subjects to
revolt from their prince, and then in killing him because he was uneasy about
it! Had they not been blinded with such a zeal as the disciples had, when they
were for having fire to come down and consume the Samaritans, surely they would
not have violated the rules of justice and equity as they did. They tried
afterward to vindicate their conduct by the claim of Plymouth to that land,
and upon an act of the commissioners of the united colonies concerning it
Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 122.
But Plymouth patent extended no father westward than Narraganset river, that
is Osamaquin or Masassoit's territories Prince's Chron^^ogy, p. 197.
; and we have before heard how they fell short of the lands in question.
Further the commissioners pleaded, that Miantinomu engaged by treaty, not to
begin war with Uncas without first appealing to the English, yet had broken
that agreement Massachusetts History, vol. 3, p. 140.
. But a very credible writer of their own informs us, that Miantinomu first
sent his complaint to Hartford against Uncas; and when they refused to meddle
in Sequassion's quarrel, he would know whether they would be offended if he
should make war upon Uncas? And that they left him to take his course Hubbard.
so that their case in truth was, like that of other invaders of their
neighbor's rights; they were in danger of being awfully requited, by a man so
sensible and powerful as Miantinomu, if he was not taken out of the way. This
evil is greatly to be lamented, and should ever stand as a solemn warning to us
all, to beware of taking one step into any course of injustice, deceit, or
cruelty; for it will surely prove bitterness in the latter end.

Had Gorton been duly aware of this, he would not have armed Miantinomu against
Uncas, for no better reason, that we know of, than because he, being a warlike
prince, stood in the way of his forming an Indian party sufficient to withstand
or overcome the Massachusetts; which proceeding, together with his irritating
writings against their rulers and ministers, were the evident cause of things
being carried to the dreadful extremity they were. Mr. Williams ever bore as
plain and full testimony against their persecuting any man for matters of
conscience, as Gorton could; and had a much greater influence over the Indians
than he ever had; yet he was so far from trying to raise a heathen party
against Christians, to correct them for injuries done to himself, that he
exerted himself with great assiduity to prevent any thing of that nature; by
which he undoubtedly was the greatest instrument of saving New England of any
one man that lived in that day, and for which his memory is and will be blessed.

Among the reasoners of our world, some will not allow, that men are influenced
in all their voluntary actions by previous causes and motives, while others
incline so much to infidelity as to represent, that the very notion of
religion, or of persons thinking that the Deity loves them better than others,
tends to make them hate and treat those ill who, as they suppose, are not thus
beloved. But as nothing teaches like experience, lot the light which facts give
in the case be regarded, beyond all the supposition or wrangles of disputants.
Is is not evident, that those several contending parties were influenced in all
their bad actions by the same principles of ambition, avarice, deceit, and
resentment, that other men are? And is it not as evident, that those actions
which were good and praiseworthy flowed from a hearty belief of revealed
religion, especially of free salvation by Christ Jesus? At present we will take
a view of the head men of the three parties of Boson, Warwick and Providence.

Governor Winthrop was in such esteem in his native country, as to be made a
justice of peace at the age of eighteen, had an estate of six or seven hundred
pounds sterling per annum; yet sold it, and spent the main of it in promoting a
religious settlement in this wilderness; where for all his vast labor and
pains, in settling and managing the government, he for some years had no stated
salary, and never had more than one hundred pounds a year; was several times
very ungratefully treated by his own people; and what could carry him through
all this, with cheerfulness to the end, but the power of religion What his
religious sentiments were, the reader may form some judgment by the following
extracts. In the first part of his administrations as Governor, he said, "in
the infancy of plantations, justice should be administered with more lenity than
in a settled state; because people are more apt then to transgress; partly out
of ignorance of new laws and orders, partly out of oppression of business and
other straits. But when some leading and learned men took offense at his
conduct in this matter, and upon a conference, gave it as their opinion, that a
stricter discipline was to be used in the beginning of a plantation than after
its being with more age established and confirmed, the Governor being readier
to see his own errors than other men's, professed his purpose to endeavor
their satisfaction with less lenity in his administrations." From whence we may
guess at the cause of the severities we have been treating of.

His expenses were great, and for two years he had no settled salary, yet the
divine precept against taking bribes, had such influence upon his mind, that
when he was the third time chosen Governor, May 8, 1632, he told the people
publicly, "that he had received gratuities from diverse towns, which he received
with much comfort and content; he had also received many kindnesses from
particular persons, which he could not refuse, lest he should be accounted
uncourteous, etc. but he professed he received them with a trembling heart, in
regard to God's rule, and the consciousness of his own infirmity, and therefore
desired that hereafter they would not take it ill if he should refuse presents
from particular persons, except the assistance of some special friends. To
which to answer was made; but he is told after, that many good people were much
grieved at it, for that he never had any allowance toward the charge of his
place."

After he had acted in banishing Mr. Wheelwright and others, many of their
friends in Boston church, whereof he was a member, were earnest with the elders
to have the church call him forth as an offender, for passing that sentence;
which he understanding, took occasion to make a public speech to them upon it,
in which he said,

"As for myself, I did nothing in the causes of any of the brethren, but by
advice of the elders of the church. Moreover, in the oath which I have taken
there is this clause, in all causes wherein you are to give your vote, you
shall do as in you judgment and conscience you shall see to be just, and for
the public good. And I am satisfied it is most for the glory of God, and the
public good, that there be such a sentence passed; yea, those brethren are so
divided from the rest of the country in their opinions and practices, that it
cannot stand with the public peace for them to continue with us; Abraham saw
that Hagar and Ishmael must be sent away."

Seven years after, upon a hot debate between the magistrates and deputies
about who should have the negative vote, Governor Winthrop wrote his mind upon
it, some passages, whereof gave offense to some noted men, which he
understanding, made the following speech at the next General Court, viz. "As
for the matter of my writing, I had the concurrence of my brethren; it is a
point of judgment which is not at my own disposing. I have examined it over and
over again, by such light as God has given me, from the rules of religion,
reason and custom; and I see no cause to retract any thing of it: Wherefore I
must enjoy my liberty in that, as you do yourselves. But for the manner, this,
and all that was blameworthy in it, was wholly my own; and whatsoever I might
allege for my own justification before man, I wave it, as now setting myself
before another judgment seat. However, what I wrote was upon great provocation,
and to vindicate myself and others from great aspersion; yet that was no
sufficient warrant for me to allow any distemper of spirit in myself; and I
doubt I have been too prodigal of my brethren's reputation. I might have
maintained my cause without casting any blemish upon others. When I made that
my conclusion, and now let religion and sound reason give judgment in the case,
it looked as if I arrogated too much unto myself, and too little to others: And
when I made that profession, that I would maintain what I wrote before all the
world, though such words might modestly be spoken, yet I perceive an
unbeseeming pride of my own heart breathing in them. For these failings I ask
pardon both of God and man."

Once more; when a great disturbance had been made in the colony by Dr. Child
and others, in 1646, Governor Winthrop was called to an account for his actings
against them, before a great assembly, but he was openly acquitted; upon which
he said, "though I am justified before men, yet it may be the Lord has seen so
much amiss in my administrations, as calls me to be humbled; and indeed for me
to have been thus charged by m^n, is itself a matter of humiliation, whereof I
desire to make a right use before the Lord. If Miriam's father spit in her
face, she is to be ashamed. But give me leave before you go to say something
that may rectify the opinions of many people, from whence the distempers have
risen that have lately prevailed upon the body of this people. The questions
that have troubled the country have been about the authority of the magistracy,
and the liberty of the people. It is you who have called us unto thy office;
but being th^^ called, we have our authority from God; it is the ordinance of
God, and it has the image of God stamped upon it; and the contempt of it has
been vindicated by God by terrible examples of his vengeance. I entreat you to
consider, that when you choose magistrates, you take from among yourselves man
subject to like passions with yourselves. If you see our infirmities, reflect
on your own, and you will not be so severe censurers of ours. We count him a
good servant who breaks not his covenant. The covenant between us and you is
the oath you have taken of us, which is to this purpose, that we shall govern
you, and judge your causes, according to God's laws, and our own, according to
our best skill, As for our skill, you must run the hazard of that; and if there
be an error, not in the will, but in the skill, it become you to bear it. Nor
would I have you to mistake in the point of your own liberty. There is a
liberty of corrupt nature, which is affected both by men and beasts, to do what
they list; and this liberty is inconsistent with authority, impatient of all
restraint; by this liberty sumus omnis deteriares: It is the grand enemy of
truth and peace, and all the ordinances of God are bent against it. But there
is a civil, a moral, a foederal liberty, which is the proper end and object of
authority; it is a liberty for that only which is just and good; for this
liberty you are to stand with the hazard of your very lives; and whatsoever
cro^^es it, is not authority, but a distemper thereof. This liberty is
maintained In a way of subjection to authority; and the authority set over you,
will in all administrations for your good be quietly submitted unto, by all but
such as have a disposition to shake off the ^oke, and lose their true liberty,
by their murmuring at the honor and power of authority." Magnalia, p. 2, p. 9
-- 13 Prince's Annals p. 60.

O! had it not been for the mistaken notion of using secular force in religions
affairs, how gloriously would this and other New England fathers have shined!?


?

Gorton, as we have seen, had a notion that the child was born in him and his
followers, who had the government upon his shoulders, and he concurred with
Wheelwright in treating those who opposed their religious sentiments as enemies
to the state; which principle evidently moved him to endeavor to raise what
force he could against them, even from among the barbarians; and also to treat
them with such a temper as he did from time to time. Even so late as the year
1676, the very little of the book he then published shows the spirit of it,
which is exactly in these words, viz. A "glass for New England, in which they
may see themselves and spirits, and if not too late, repent and turn from their
abominable ways and cursed contrivances. By S. G. And as the Quakers were about
that time accused by authority of setting up their post by God's posts, he
says, "I hope none will be so blind and ignorant as to set their posts or
thresholds to the devil's post, and the professors of New-England's posts, viz.
their whipping-post or gallows-posts; no nor yet join their threshold to their
gaol-thresholds, nor their bridewell-threshold, over which and in which
professors and talkers of God and Christ do and have hauled over lambs and
followers of Christ, and in which they crop their ears, and out of which they
bring them in their wills and madness, and banish, whip and hang them in their
blind zeal. p. 17, 18. And he annexes to said book a letter to Governor
Bellingham, dated from Boston prison June 15, 1667, wrote by John Tyso, a
Quaker who speaks of it as a great error in Dr. Increase Mather to say, there
was "nothing IN him that he hoped to be saved by, and that there was none
cleansed from all sin on this side the grave. p. 35. Gorton likewise, speaking
of Wheelwright's being first called before the General Court for his sermon, at
their session in March, 1637, tells us that Mr. Cotton then said, "brother
Wheelwright's doctrine was according to God, in the point controverted, and
wholly and altogether; and nothing did I hear alleged against the doctrine
proved by the word of God. -- But, (says G.) that which is most to be lamented,
is that those which once had a good testimony in their hearts and mouths for
God, and his light and spiritual appearance; and they not being faithful and
constant to that which is made manifest and committed to them, it has even
happened to them according to the saying of the Lord God, by the mouth of his
prophet, that in the day in which a righteous man turns from his righteousness,
and does wickedly, all the righteousness that he has done shall be forgotten,
and in the sin which he has sinned he shall surely die the death. p. 6, 7.

Now is it not evident, that the Massachusetts were moved by the same
unreasonable principle of grasping at power and gain, that belonged not to
them, in their dealings with Gorton, as operates in other men, though it went
under a cloak of religion? And is it not as evident that he was moved with
self-conceit, and carnal wit and resentment, in his carriage toward them,
notwithstanding all his talk of the child's being born in him, and of a
creating power for ever to form all things out of that ancient " chaos of God
and man being made one! And neither of these things can hurt the truth and
excellency of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION, any more than the self confidence,
rashness and dissimilation of Peter did on the one hand, or the blasphemy of
Hymenus and Alexander on the other. And though some would have it, that Mr.
Williams, after his banishment, left revealed religion, and took to the
exercise of reason and humanity, in distinction from it, yet his own testimony
is exceeding clear to the contrary. In his address to the Quakers 37 years
after his banishment he say,

"The truth is, from my childhood, now above threescore years, the Father of
lights and mercies touched my soul with a love to himself, to his only
begotten, the true LORD JESUS, to his HOLY SCRIPTURES, etc. his infinite wisdom
has given me to see the city, court and country, the schools and universities
of my native country, to converse with some Turks, Jews, Papists, and all sorts
of Protestants, and by books to know the affairs and religions of all
countries. My conclusion is, that, be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven
thee, Matt. ix. is one of the joyfulest sounds that ever came to poor sinful
ears. How to obtain this sound from the mouth of the mediator that spoke it, is
the greatest dispute between the Protestants and the bloody whore of Rome: This
is also the great point between the true Protestants and yourselves; as also,
in order to this, about what man is now by nature, and what the true Lord Jesus
is Dedication of his book against the Quakers, 1673.
.

And upon their use of those words spoken to the saints, the manifestation of
the spirit is given to every man to profit withal, and other like expressions,
which they would apply to mankind in general, he says, the Papists catch hold
upon a letter; this is "my body; you as simply as do the Generalists catch hold
upon the letter, all, every man, etc. whereas the scope and connection in all
writings, and in all matters in the world, is rationally to be minded. The
sense and meaning is, in all speech and writing, the very speech and writing
itself. The words all and every one, in our own and other tongues, are often
used figuratively. It is so all the scripture over, and thrice in one verse,
Col. i. 28, where reason cannot imagine that Paul did literally and
individually admonish every man, teach every man, and present every man that
comes into the World perfect in Christ Jesus, which could not, cannot possibly
be true, without another sense and exposition than the words literally hold out
Ibid. p. 8, 9.
.

And when they demanded the reason why he condemned them for not holding to the
external use of baptism and the supper, while he did not live in the practice
thereof himself? He answered, that "it was one thing to be in arms against the
King of kings, and the visible administration of his kingdom, and to turn off
all to notions of an invisible kingdom, officers and worship, as the Quakers
did; and another thing, among so many pretenders to be the true church, to be
in doubt unto which to associate himself. After all my search and examinations,
I said, I do profess to believe, that some come nearer to the first churches
and institutions of Christ than others; as in many respects, so in that
gallant, heavenly and fundamental principle, of the true matter of a Christian
society, viz. actual believers, true disciples and converts, and living stones,
such as can give some account how the grace of God has appeared to them, and
wrought that heavenly change in them. I professed that if my soul could find
rest in joining unto any of the churches professing Christ now extant, I would
readily and gladly do it, yea, unto themselves whom I now opposed. But not
finding rest, they knew there is a time of ^^rity and primitive sincerity;
there is a time of transgression and apostasy, and there is a time of the
coming out of the Babylonian and wilderness apostasy Ibid. p. 65, 66.
.

These extracts may assist the reader in forming a true judgment of the motives
upon which those several noted men acted in those difficult times, which also
may be useful now to teach us all, what to avoid and what to pursue; the
importance of which I hope will sufficiently apologize for the length of this
account, and also make the reader willing to take an article or two more before
we conclude this chapter.

The church at Plymouth was so unwilling to part with "a man of such eminence"
as Mr. Chauncy, that they conceded, in case he would settle with them, that he
should act according to his persuasion, which was that baptism ought only to be
by dipping "or plunging the whole body under water, with such as desired it,
either for themselves or infants, provided he could without offense suffer
their other minister, Mr. Regner, to practice in the other way, with those who
desired it; but he did not see "light to comply Plymouth Register, p. 5, 6
. From thence he was called to office in the church at Situate, where we are
told that he persevered in his opinion of dipping "in baptism, and practiced
accordingly, first upon two of his own children, which being in very cold
weather, one of them swooned away; -- another, having a child about three years
old, feared it would be frighted (as others had been, and one caught hold of
Mr. Chauncy, and had near pulled him into the water) she brought her child to
Boston (with letters testimonial from Mr. Chauncy) and had it baptized here.
This last action was in July, 1642; and not long after, the lady Moody, a wise
and amiable religious "woman, being taken with the error of denying baptism to
infants, was dealt withal by many of the elders and others, and admonished by
the church of Salem (whereof she was) persisting still, and to avoid further
trouble, she removed to the Dutch, against the advice of her friends. Many
others infested with Anabaptism, etc. removed thither also. She was after
excommunicated. Winthrop.


Here as well as elsewhere appears the honesty and ingenuity of this great man,
in stating facts plainly, when they make directly against his own persuasion.
Those who deny infant baptism have been reproached from age to age with the
name of Anabaptists, under which have been couched such dreadful ideas, that
even to this day we see the very name used as an argument in various
controversies; so that if a disputant can tell his opponent, he in that point
agrees with the Anabaptists, it is thought that therein he must be in an error;
but our honorable author gives, without a covering, the good characters and
virtues of that father and that mother in our Isarel, at the same time that he
describes plainly what he disliked in them; leaving fair grounds for others to
judge upon, without being biassed with any old stories of German madness. By
this it appears that the grand difficulty in the way of burying in baptism, is
their admitting of subjects to it who have not the faith or discretion which is
necessary for such an action.

Though Mr. Williams had done such great services for his English neighbors in
the late wars, yet he was not permitted to pass throught their coasts, but was
forced to repair to the Dutch to get a passage to his native country; yea, it
must needs be so, because the blessings of a peacemaker were to come upon him,
among the Dutch as well as English As a distinct account of this affair has not
been published among us, I shall give it a place here. When the commissioners
of the united co^^o^ies met in September, 1643, they were informed of a Dutch
ship that had arrived in Hunson's river, which brought 4000 pounds of powder,
and 700 pieces, to trade with the ^a^i^es; but the Dutch Governor, having
notice thereof, prudently confiscated them to the use of the company; thereby
depriving their enemies of arms, whereby they might themselves have been
destroyed, and furnishing themselves and friends with weapons for their safety;
for at this time the Indians had fierce war with the Dutch, and if it had not
been for the assistance of the English, they might have been all cut off. The
occasion of the war was this: An Indian being drunk, had slain an old Dutchman;
the Dutch required the murderer, but he could not he had. The people called
often upon the Governor to take revenge, but he still put it off, because he
thought it not just, or not safe. It fell out in that time, that the M^quasor
Mohawks, either upon their own quarrel or (as the report was) being set on by
the Dutch came suddenly upon the Indians near the Dutch, and killed about 30 of
them; the rest fled for shelter to the Dutch. One Marine, a Dutch captain,
bearing of it, went to the Governor and obtained a commission to kill as many
as he could of them; and accordingly went with a company of armed men, and set
upon them, when they feared no such thing from the Dutch, and killed 70 or 80
men, women and children. Upon this the Indians burnt diverse of their farm
houses, and their cattle in them; and slew all they could meet with, to the
number of 20 or more, of men, women and children, and pursued hard upon the
Dutch, even home to their sort Aurana (Albany) that they were forced to call in
the English to their aid, and entertained Captain Underhill in their service.
Marine was so much enraged to see Underhill preferred before him, that his
Governor was forced at last to send him home in chains. About this time Captain
Patrick, who went from Boston, was shot dead by a Dutchman, upon a Lordsday, at
Stamford. Though the people were all for war before, yet now they were so much
offended with the Governor, that he entertained a guard of ^o English about his
person. And the Indians annoyed them so by sudden assaults out of swamps, etc.
that he was forced to keep a running army to oppose them upon all occasions.
The Indians killed and drove all before them as far as Stamford; slew Mrs.
Hutchinson and her family, all except one whom they captivated. They passed
over to Long Island, and the natives there took part with them, and began to
burn the Dutchmen's houses; assaulted the house of the lady Moody, who not long
before moved from Salem upon the account of Anabaptism; but she was desended by
forty men that gath^^ed to her house, which they assaulted diverse times. But
the Long Island Indians, by the mediation of Mr. Williams (who was then there
to "take ship for England) were pacified, and peace re^stablished between the
Dutch and them. But still upon the main, they set upon the Dutch with an
implacable fury, killing all they could come by, burning their houses, and
destroying their cat^le, without any resistance; so as the Governor and such as
escaped betook themselves to their fort at Manhatos [New-York] and there lived
upon their cat^le. But many of the Indians being destroyed by Captain Underhill
and his followers, at last they began to be weary of the sport, and
condescended to terms of peace. Winthrop -- Hubbard.
.

When Mr. Williams arrived in England, he found the country involved in the
dreadful calamities and horrors of a war between the King and Parliament; but
the Parliament having the command of the fleet, did by an ordinance of November
2, 1643, appoint commissioners to manage the affairs of the islands and other
plantations; from whom, by the kind assistance of Sir Henry Vane, who was one
of them, Mr. Williams obtained a charter, including the lands bordering
northward and northeast on "the patent of the Massachusetts, east and southeast
on Plymouth patent, south on the ocean, and on the west and northwest by the
Indians called Narragansets; the whole tract extending about twenty-five miles,
unto the Pequod river and country; to be know by the name of The INCORPORATION
of PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, in the NARRAGANSET-BAY, in NEW ENGLAND. Together
with full power and authority to rule themselves, and such others as shall
hereafter inhabit within any part of the said tract of land, by such form of
civil government, as by voluntary consent of all, or the greater part of them,
they shall find most suitable to their estate and condition. -- Provided the
civil government of the said plantations be conformable to the laws of England,
so far as the nature and constitution of the place will admit.

This charter was signed March 14, 1644, by Robert Warwick, Philip Pembroke,
Say and Seal, Philip Wharton, Arthur Haslerig, Cornelius Holland, Henry Vane,
Samuel Vassel, John Roll, Miles Corbet, and William Spurstow. See said charter
in the History of Providence.

CHAP. III. From 1644 to 1651, containing the first Law that was made in
New England against the Baptists, and a Variety of other Events.
THE first Baptist church in Newport we are told was formed and set in order
about this year, under the ministry of Mr. John Clark; which is the first
church of any denomination on Rhode Island that has continued by succession,
and the second in the colony The first certain date in their church records is
taken from a manuscript of Mr. Samuel Hubbard in 1648, which says the church
was formed about the year 1644, and by what I have quoted from Winthrop and
Hubbard, it appears as likely to be earlier as later than that time.
. Also in the Massachussetts we are told that Anabaptists increased and spread
"in the country Winthrop.
. Upon which they framed and passed the following act at their General Court,
November 13, 1644.

"Forasmuch as experience has plentifully and often proved, that since the
first rising of the Anabaptists, about 100 years since, they have been the
incendiaries of the commonwealths, and the in^^ctors of persons in main matters
of religion, and the troublers of churches in all places where they have been,
and that thry who have held the baptizing infants unlawful, have usually held
other (...) or heresies together therewith, though the (...) other heretics use
to do) concealed the same till they ^pred out a fit advantage and opportunity,
to vent them, by way of question or scruple; and whereas diverse of this kind
have since our coming into New England appeared amongst ourselves, some whereof
(as others before them) denied the ordinance of magistracy, and the lawfulness
of making war, and others the lawfulness of magistrates, and their inspection
into any breach of the first table; which opinions, if they should be connived
at by us, are like to be increased amongst us, and so must necessarily bring
guilt upon us, infection and trouble to the churches, and hazard to the whole
commonwealth; it is ordered and agreed, that if any person or persons, within
this jurisdiction, shall either openly condemn or oppose the baptizing of
infants, or go about secretly to seduce others from the approbation or use
thereof, or shall purposely depart the congregation at the ministration of the
ordinance, or shall deny the ordinance of magistracy, or their lawful right and
authority to make war, or to punish the outward breaches of the first table,
and shall appear'to the court wilfully and obstinately to continue therein
after due time and means of conviction, every such person or persons shall be
sentenced to banishment Massachusetts Records. Mr. Hubbard speaking of their
making this law, says, "but with what success is hard to say; all men being
naturally inclined to pity them that suffer, how much soever they are incensed
against offenders in general. Natural conscience and the reverence of a Deity,
that is deeply engraved on the hearts of all, make men more apt to favor them
that suffer for religion, true or false." A judicious remark; yet in another
instance we may see how party influence can blind great men. For this author in
1638 tells us of Arnold's opposing their censuring Verin at Providence, for
refusing to let his wife go to Mr. Williams's meeting so often as she was
called for, and represents that to censure Verin therefore, would be a breach of
God's ordinance, about the subjection "of wives to their husbands. But the same
author informs us, that in 1644 one Painter, a poor man, was suddenly turned
Anabaptist, and having a child born, would not suffer his wife "to carry it to
be baptized. He was complained of for this to the court, and enjoined by them
to suffer his child to be baptized. And because he refused to obey them
therein, and told them it was an Antichristian ordinance, they tied him up and
whipped him; which he bare without flinching, and declared he had divine help to
support him; upon which, says our author, "two or three honest men that were
his neighbors affirmed that he was of very loose behavior at home, etc. Be it
so or not, yet we have no better account of Verin's character than of his, yet
Verin must not be censured for withholding his wife from meeting; but it poor
Painter will not give up the disposal of his children to his wife, at the
court's commandment, he must not only be censured, but also suffer corporal
punishment: Yea, and into the bargain, be publicly reproached for his private
failings! Governor Winthrop tells us he belonged to Hingham, and says he was
whipped "for reproaching the Lord's ordinance." But did not they reproach infant
sprinkling, by taking such methods to support it much more than Painter did?
.

Let it be here noted, that the evident design of this law was to guard against
such as refused to countenance infant baptism, and the use of secular force in
religious affairs; which the Baptists have ever done from that day to this; but
the other articles inserted in this act they have not owned; and the court then
had no proof at hand, but were forced to have recourse to surmises, distant
times, and foreign countries, for them; and a like method of treating the
Baptists, in courts, from pulpits and from the press, has been handed down by
tradition ever since. And can we believe that men so knowing and virtuous in
other respects, as many on that side have been, would have introduced and
continued in a way of treating their neighbors, which is so unjust and
scandalous, if they could have found better arguments to support that cause
upon? I have diligently searched all the books, records and papers I could come
at upon all sides, and have found a great number of instances of Baptists
suffering for the above points that we own; but not one instance of the
conviction of any member of a Baptist church in this country, in any court, of
the errors or evils which are inserted in this law to justify their making of
it, and to render our denomination odious That is not one instance in any
government that supported Paedobaptism by force. But Mr. Williams, when
Governor of Providence colony in 1655, acted with the court in punishing a man
for opposing all government, who then was called a Baptist, but after turned to
the Quakers.
. Much has been said to exalt the characters of those good fathers: I have no
desire of detracting from any of their virtues; but the better the men were,
the worse must be the principle that could ensnare them in such bad actions.

The contrast betwixt their treatment of Mr. Wheelwright and Mr. Williams this
year desserves notice. Upon a new running of the line, the Massachusetts had
taken Exeter into their colony, which caused Mr. Wheelwright to remove to
Wells, from whence he wrote to the Governor at Boston for a reconciliation,
Dec. 7, 1643, and said, it is the "grief of my soul that I used such vehement
censorious speeches. I repent me that I did adhere to persons of corrupt
judgments, to the countenancing and encouraging of them in any of their errors,
or evil practices, though I intended no such thing. The court inclined to bear
him, of which the Governor sent him a written account, and received such a
reply as would make one think of Bishop Burnet's remark. Said he, there are
none of us but what will acknowledge in general terms that our church is
imperfect, though when we come to particulars we are always in the right Said
letter to the Governor is in these words: R. W.

"I have received your letters, wherein you signify to me, that you have
imparted my letter to the H. C. and that it finds good acceptance, for which I
rejoice with all thankfulness; as also for liberty of safe conduct granted by
the court, and; in case I desire, letters for that end. I should very willing
(upon letters obtained) express by word of mouth, openly in court, that which I
did by writing, might I without offense express my true intent and meaning more
fully to this effect, that notwithstanding my failings (for which I crave
pardon) yet I cannot with a good conscience condemn myself for such capital
crimes, dangerous revelations and gros^errors, as have been charged upon me.
The concurrence of which, as I take it, make up the substance of all my
suffenings. I do not see but in so mixed a cause, I am bound to use, may it be
permitted, my just defense, so far as I apprehend myself to be innocent, and to
make my confession where I am convinced of any delinqency, otherwise I shall
seemingly and in appearance fall under guilt of many heinous offenses, for
which my conscience does acquit me. If I seem to make suit to the court for
relaxation to be granted as an act of mercy upon my sole confession. I must
offend my conscience; if by an act of justice, upon my apology ad lawful
defense, I fear I shall here offend your Worships. I leave all things to your
wise and holy consideration, hoping you will pardon my simplicity and
plainness, which I am forced unto by the power of an overruling conscience. I
rest your Worship's in the Lord.

J. WHEELWRIGHT."

Wills (1) 1. 1643.

Winthrop -- Hubbard. Note, their way was to begin the year with March 25, so
that according to our reckoning this was March 1, 1614.


. Yet without waiting for his personal appearance, they at the General Court in
Boston, May 29. 1644, passed the following act, viz.

"It is ordered that Mr. Wheelwright (upon a particular, solemn, and serious
acknowledgment and confession, by letters, of his evil carriages, and of the
court's justice upon him for them) has his banishment taken off, and is
received as a member of this commonwealth At the same time they passed a
sentence, that "Richard Waterman, being foned erroneous, heretical and
obstinate, it was ordered that he should be detained prisoner till the quarter
court in the seventh month, unless five of the magistrates find cause to send
him away, which if they do, it is ordered, he shall not return within this
jurisdiction upon pain of death."

Mr. Williams returned with the charter he had procured to Boston, the 17th of
September following Winthrop.
and brought the ensuing letter with him.

To the right worshipful the Governor and Assistants, and the rest of our
worthy friends in the plantation of Massachusetts Bay.

Our much honored friends, "TAKING notice some of us of long time of Mr. Roger
Williams's good affections and conscience, and of his sufferings by our common
enemy and oppressors of God's people the prelates, as also of his great
industry and travels in his printed Indian labors in your parts (the like
whereof we have not seen extant from any part of America) and in which respect
it has pleased both Houses of Parliament to grant unto him and friends with
him a free and absolute charter of civil government for those parts of his
abode, and withal sorrowfully resenting that amongst good men (our friends)
driven to the ends of the world, exercised with the trials of a wilderness, and
who mutually give good testimony each of the other (as we observe you do of
him, and he abundantly of you Mr. Williams confirmed his profession of love to
them by his practice, in constanlty doing them all the good in his power, both
in this country and at the British court, where also his great friend, Sir
Henry Vane, this year showed a truly Christian spirit of forgiveness toward
the Massachusetts; for when upon a certain affair a heavy complaint was made
against the government, "and they were threatened with the loss of their
privileges, Sir Henry Vane stood their friend, and by his great interest which
the Parliament, appeased their resentment, and laid the storm which was
gathering and hung over them.

Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 66. Mr. Williams's printed Indian labors
referred to, which had considerable influence in procuring their charter, were
three years before the famous Mr. Elliot began to preach to the Indians at
Natick, or Mr. Thomas Mayhew a Martha^ Vineyard.

to profess our great desires of both your utmost endeavors of nearer closing
and of ready expressing those good affections (which we perceive you bear each
to other) in effectual performance of all friendly offices. The rather because
of those bad neighbors you are likely to find too too near you in Virginia,
and the unfriendly visits from the west of England and from Ireland. That
howsoever it may please the Most High to shake our foundations, yet the report
of your peaceable and prosperous plantations may be some refreshings to your
true and faithful friends, Cor. Holland, John Blackistow, Isaac Pennington,

taken prisoner.



It is said, "upon the receipt of this letter, the Governor and magistrates of
the Massachusetts found, upon examination of their hearts, no reason to condemn
themselves for any former proceedings against Mr. Williams; but for any offices
of Christian love, and duries of humanity, they were very willing to maintain a
mutual correspondence with him; but a to his dangerous principles of
separation, unless he can be brought to lay them down, they see no reason why
to concede to him, or any so persuaded, free liberty of ingress or egress, lest
any of their people should be drawn away with his erroneous opinions Hubbard.
."

The reader may remember that Wheelwright, in his sentence of banishment, was
charged with contempt and sedition, which he never confessed; and that Governor
Winthrop declared his opinions to be worse than Mr. Williams's The court
sentence against him was is these words: "whereas Mr. Roger William one of the
elders of the church of Salem has breached and divulzed diverse new and
dangerous opinions, against the authority of magistrates, as also written
letters of defamation both of the magistrates and churches here, and that
before any conviction, and yet maintains the same without retraction: It is
therefore ordered, that the said Mr. Williams shall depart out of this
jurisdiction within six weeks now next ensuing, which if he neglect to perform,
it shall be lawful for the Governor and two of the magistrates to send him to
some place out of this jurisdiction, not to return any more without license
from the court."

Massachusetts Records, 1635.


; yet now the one is received to favor and liberty again, while the other is
denied it, though he had done the colony such great and essential services as
the former never did. How can we account for this? The best answer I can give
is, that Mr. Wheelwright held to infant baptism, and to the magistrates power
to govern in religious affairs, and now yielded to their exercise of it; but
Mr. Williams denied both, for which he was excommunicated by the church, after
the court had sent him away; Wheelwright was also in such favor with Mr.
Cotton, that he was dismissed from his church in fellowship, after the court
had banished him for sedition; and he now appeared very complaisant and
submissive to men in power: But Williams was so self-conceited, turbulent, "and
uncharitable, as to give public advertisements and admonition to all men,
whether of meaner or more public note and place, of the corruptions of religion
which himself observed, both in their judgments and practices; of which there
needs no other evidence, than what is obvious to the view of every indifferent
reader, in his dealing with that famous and reverend divine Mr. John Cotton, in
his book called The bloody Tenet.

These words Mr. Hubbard quotes from another, as the received opinion of that
day. But who was this reverend divine, and how was he dealt with? Was not Mr.
Williams as truly a minister of Christ as he? Does self-conceit move men to
give plain warnings to great men, which have a tendency to expose self to heavy
sufferings? And does it move persons to do every kind office they can from year
to year, for those who will not hear reproof, but requite evil for good? This
is a different sort of pride than what most men are acquainted with. However
that the reader may have a fair opportunity of judging for himself, I shall
endeavor plainly to state before him the occasion and nature of this
controversy between Cotton and Williams.

A prisoner in Newgate wrote some arguments against persecution, which were
presented to Mr. Cotton, and he wrote an answer to them in a letter to one Mr.
Hall, of Roxbury; who not being satisfied therewith, sent them to Mr. Williams
at Providence, requesting him to write upon the subject. And as Mr. Cotton
closed his letter to Mr. Hall with saying. I forbear adding reasons to justify
"the truth, because you may find that done to your hand, in a treatise sent to
some of the brethren, late of Salem, who dubted as you do: Mr. Williams wrote
to Mr. Sharp, elder of Salem church, for it, and obtained it William's Reply to
Cotton, p. 290, 291.
. He then wrote his sentiments upon the whole, under the title of The bloody
Tenet of Persecution for Conscience Sake; which I suppose he now brought with
him from London, though I have not been able to obtain it. Mr. Cotton wrote an
answer to him, which he called The bloody Tenet washed, and made white in the
Blood of the Lamb; that was printed in London in 1647. To this Mr. Williams
published a reply in 1652, entitled, The bloody Tenet yet more bloody, by Mr.
Cotton's Endeavor to wash it white. The two last of these performances are now
before me, and from thence I shall give the reader their own words upon the
most material points of their dispute.

First. Mr. Cotton's memory failed him so much as to represent, that what he
wrote in answer to the prisoner's arguments, was in a private letter to Mr.
Williams, and upon that said, "I wrote my conscience, and the truth of God
according to my conscience; why should he punish me with open penance, and
expose me (as much as in him lies to the world) to open shame, as a man of
blood, for the liberty of my conscience? How will it stand with his own
principles, to plead for liberty of conscience and yet to punish it? Besides
let him remember, if I did offend him with such an error, it was but a private
offense, and the rule of the gospel required he should first have convinced and
admonished me privately of it, and so have proceeded upon my contumacy, at
length to have told the church, before he had published it to the world Note,
C. and W. in this account stand for Cotton and Williams's books abovesaid; the
figures for the pages therein.
." C. p. 2.

Mr. Williams in his reply mentions Mr. Cotton's mistake about who he wrote the
letter to, and that he supposed his answer to the prisoner's arguments had been
as public as his profession and practice was upon that tenet, and then says,
"but grant it had been a private letter, and the discourse and the opinion
private; yet why does he charge the discusser with breach of rule, in not using
orderly ways of admoniton, and telling the church, when master Cotton in this
book blames the discusser for disclaiming communion with their church, and they
also (after he was driven by banishment from civil habitation amongst them) had
sent forth a bull of excommunication against him in his absence! Such practice
the Lord Jesus and his first apostles or messengers never taught. -- I never
heard that disputing, discoursing and examining men's tenets or doctrines by
the word of God, was, in proper English, persecution for conscience: Well had
it been for New England, that no servant of God, nor witness of Christ, could
justly take up complaint for other kinds of persecution." W. p. 4, 5.

The main point of all Mr. Cotton's washings is a denial of the charge of
persecuting any for cause of conscience, and he says, "I expressly profess, 1,
that no man is to be persecuted at all, much less for conscience sake. 2, I
profess further, that none is to be punished for conscience sake, though
erroneous, unless his errors be fundamental, or seditiously and turbulently
promoted, and that after due conviction of conscience; that it may appear, he
is not punished for his conscience, but for sinning against his conscience. --
If this tenet have any appearance of blood in it, it is because it is washed in
the blood of the Lamb, and sealed with his blood. And then though it may seem
bloody to men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth (as Paul seemed to
such to be a pestilent fellow) yet to faithful and upright souls, such things
as are washed in the blood of the Lamb, are wont to come forth white." C. p. 3.

In reply to this Mr. Williams says, "is not this the guise and profession of
all that ever persecuted or hunted men for their religion and conscience? Are
not all histories and experiences full of the pathetical speeches of
persecutors to this purpose? You will say you are persecuted for your
conscience, you plead conscience, thou art a heretic, the devil has deceived
thee, thy conscience is deluded, etc. -- Time has and will discover that such
a blackamore cannot be washed in the blood of Christ himself, without
repentance." And he goes on to observe, that the setting up of state religions
has been the grand source of persecution in every age. W. p. 6, 7. Against
which he brought our Lord's parable of the tares of the field. Upon which Mr.
Cotton said, "it is true, Christ expounds the field to be the world, but he
meant not the world, but (by an usual trope) the church scattered throughout
the world." C. p. 41.

Mr. Williams says, "it is no wonder to find master Cotton so entangled, both
in his answers and replies touching this parable; for men of all sorts in
former ages have been so entangled before him. To which purpose I will relate a
notable passage recorded by that excellent witness of God, master Fox, in his
book of Acts and Monuments; it is this: In the story of Mr. George Wisehart, in
the days of King Henry the eighth, there preached at the arraigament of said
Wisehart one John Winryme, sub-prior of the abbey of St. Andrews; he discoursed
on the parable of the tares; he interpreted the tares to be heretics; and yet
contrary to this very scripture (as Mr. Fox observes, though elsewhere himself
maintains it the duty of the civil magistrate to suppress heretics) I say the
said Winryme concludes that heretics ought not to be let alone until the
harvest, but to be suppressed by the power of the civil magistrate. So that
both the Popish prior and the truly Christian Fox were entangled in
contradictions to their own writings about this heavenly scripture." W. p. 46.

To support the notion of calling the church the world, Mr. Cotton quoted some
texts wherein the redeemed are so called. C. p. 43. In reply Mr. Williams says,
"grant that it has pleased the Lord in his infinite wisdom to cause the term
world to be used in various significations; yet let any instance be given of
any scripture, wherein the Lord opposing the church and world, wheat and tares
does not distinguish between the church redeemed out of the world, and the
world itself, which is said to lie in wickedness, and to be such as for which
Jesus would not pray, John xvii." W. p. 56. He further argued that sowing of
the seed in four sorts of ground by Christ's messengers, he called the kingdom
of heaven, which four sorts cannot be supposed to be of the church. Mr. Cotton
answers, 1, that Christ preached himself to those four sorts of hearers, yet he
was the minister of circumcision, and seldom preached to any but members of the
church of Israel. C. p. 44. Reply, "when they grew incurable, and received not
the admonitions of the Lord, by the Lord Jesus and his servants preaching unto
them, the Lord cast them out of his sight, destroyed that national church, and
established the Christian church." W. p. 57.

But Cotton says, "2, it is an error to say, the church consists of no more
sorts of hearers but one, the honest and good ground; for if the children of
church members be in the church, and of the church, till they give occasion of
rejection, then they growing up to years, become some of them like the
highway-side, others like the stony, others like the thorny, as well as others
like the honest and good ground. C. p. 44." Mr. Williams replies.

"Admit the Christian church were constituted of the natural seed and offspring
(which yet Mr. Cotton knows will never be granted to him, and I believe will
never be proved by him) yet he knows, that upon the discovery of any such
portion of ground in the church, the church is bound to admonish, and upon
impenitency after admonition, to cast them into the world, the proper place of
such kinds of hearers and professors." W. p. 57.

Mr. Cotton adds, "is it not a main branch of their covenant with God, that as
God gives himself to be a God to them, and to their seed, so they should give
up themselves and their seed to be his people? Besides has not God given
pastors and teachers, as well for the gathering together of the saints, as for
the edification of the body of Christ? And has he not given the church, and
the gospel preached in the church, to lie like leaven in three pecks of meal
till all be leavened?" C. p. 44. Mr. Williams says, "I answer, the proper work
of pastors and teachers is to feed the sheep in the flock, and not the herds of
wild beasts in the world. And although it is the duty of parents to bring up
their children in the nurture and fear of the Lord; yet what if those children
refuse to frequent the assemblies of the church, and what if those three sorts
of ground or hearers will not come within the bounds of the pastors and
teachers feeding; has not the Lord Jesus appointed other officers in Ephesians. iv.
for the gathering of the saints, that is, sending out of the church of Christ
apostles or messengers, to preach Christ to the three sorts of bad ground, to
labor to turn them into good ground? But alas! to salve up this, the civil
sword is commonly run for, to force all sorts of ground to come to church,
instead of sending forth the heavenly sowers according to the ordinance of
Christ." W. p. 38.

Another argument Mr. Cotton draws from the servants wondering to see the
tares, which would not have been strange in the highway. C. p. 45. In reply to
which Mr. Williams says, "let the highway, stony and thorny ground, be
considered in their several qualities of profaneness, stoutness, and
worldliness, and all the sons of men throughout the world naturally are such;
and it is no wonder, nor would the servants of Christ be so troubled, as to
desire their plucking up out of the world. But again consider all these sorts
of men as professing the name and anointing of Christ Jesus, in a false,
counterfeit antichristian way, and then it may well be wondered whence such
monstrous Christians or anointed ones arose; and God's people may easily be
tempted rather to desire their rooting out of the world, than the rooting out
of any such sorts of ground or men, professing any other religion, Jewish,
Mohammedan or Pagan. -- A traitor is worse than a professed fox." W. p. 58, 59.

Again, while Mr. Cotton pleaded for the exertions of the civil power against
heretics and antichristians, he says, "no ordinance or law of God, nor just law
of man, commands the rooting out of hypocrites, either by civil or church
censure, though the church be bound to endeavor as much as in them lies to
heal their hypocrisy." C. p. 47. To this Mr. Williams answers, "hypocrisy
discovered in the fruit of it, is not to be let alone in the church or state;
for neither the church of Christ nor civil state can long continue safe, if
hypocrites or traitors (under what pretense soever) be permitted to break forth
in them, without due punishment and rooting out; this hypocrisy being
especially the great sin against which Christ so frequently and so vehemently
inveighed, and against which he denounced the sorest plagues and judgments." W.
p. 62. He then proceeded to plead, that the civil state should only punish
civil offenses. Upon which Mr. Cotton asks, "what if their worship and
consciences incite them to civil offenses?" C. p. 50. Mr. Williams says, "I
answer, the conscience of the civil magistrate must incite him to civil
punishment; as a Lord Mayor of London once answered that he was born to be a
judge, to a thief that pleaded he was born to be a thief. If the conscience of
the worshippers of the beast incite them to prejudice prince or state, although
these consciences be not as the conscience of the thief, commonly convinced of
the evil of his fact, but persuaded of the lawfulness of their actions; yet so
far as the civil state is endamaged or endangered, I say the sword of God in
the hand of civil authority is strong enough to defend itself, either by
imprisoning or disarming, or other wholesome means, while yet their consciences
ought to be permitted in what is merely point of worship, as prayer and other
services and administrations. Against any civil mischief the civil state is
strongly guarded. Against the spiritual mischief, the church or city of Christ
is guarded with heavenly armies, wherein there hang a thousand bucklers, and
most mighty weapons. Cant. iv. 2 Cor. x." W. p. 66, 67. But as he still pleaded
that the civil sword was never appointed by Christ for an antidote or remedy in
spiritual evils and dangers; Mr. Cotton denies it, and says, "it is evident the
civil sword was appointed for remedy in this case, Deuteronomy. xiii. and appointed it
was by that angel of God's presence, whom God promised to send with his people.
Exodus xxxiii. 2, 3. And that angel was Christ, whom they tempted in the
wilderness. 1 Cor. x. 9. Therefore it cannot truly be said, that the Lord Jesus
never appointed the civil sword for a remedy in such a case: For he did
expressly appoint it in the old testament; nor did he ever abrogate it in the
new. The reason of the law (which is the life of the law) is of eternal force
and equity in all ages. Thou shall surely kill him, because he has sought to
thrust thee away from the Lord thy God; this reason is moral, that is, of
universal and perpetual equity to put to death any apostate seducing idolator,
or heretic Does not this and such like sentences make the tenet to appear yet
more bloody!
" C. p. 66, 67.

In reply Mr. Williams says, "how grievous is this language of m^st, Co^^^^!
Moses in the old testament was Christ's servant, yet being but a servant,
dispensed his power by carnal rites and ceremonies, laws, rewards and
punishments, in that holy nation, and that one land of Canaan. But when Jesus
the Son and Lord himself was come, to bring the truth, life and substance, of
all those shadows; to break down the partition wall between Jew and Gentile,
and establish the Christian worship and kingdom in all nations of the world,
master Cotton will never prove, from any of the books and institutions of the
new testament, that unto those spiritual remedies appointed by Christ against
spiritual maladies, he added the help of the carnal sword. If it appear, as
evidently it does, that Jesus, the antitype of the kings of Israel, wears his
sword in his mouth, being a sharp and two-edged sword, then the answer is a
clear as the sun, that scatters the clouds and darkness of the night. Besides,
master Cotton needs not fly to the pope's argument for children baptism, to
wit, to say Christ never abrogated Deuteronomy. xiii. therefore, etc for Mr. Cotton
knows the profession of the Lord Jesus, John xviii. that his kingdom was not
earthly, and therefore his sword cannot be earthly. Mr. Cotton knows that Jesus
commanded a sword to be put up, when it was drawn in the cause of Christ, and
added a dreadful threatening, that all that take the sword (that is, the carnal
sword in his cause) shall perish by it" W. p. 95, 96.

The reader may remember, that Mr. Williams was often blamed for holding that
the civil magistrate's work was confined to the precepts of the second table;
his main argument therefore was, that (...) the most sully of that subject of
any place in the (...), and there the discourse is confined to the du^^^
included in love to our neighbor. Mr Cotton grants his premises, but not his
conclusion, and says, "though subjection to magistrates, and love to all men,
be duties which concern the second table, yet the inference will not follow,
that therefore magistrates have no^^ing to do to punish any violation, no not
the weightiest duties of the first table. It is a clear case, among the duties
of the second table, people may be exhorted to honor their ministers, and
children may be exhorted to honor their parents; but will it hence follow, that
therefore ministers have nothing to do with matters of religion in the church,
or parents in the family?" C. p. 96.

Mr. Williams answers, "if people are bound to yield obedience in civil things
to civil officers of the state, Christians are much more bound to yield
obedience to the spiritual officers of Christ's kingdom; but how weak is this
argument to prove, that therefore civil officers of the state are constituted
rulers, preservers and reformers of the Christian and spiritual state, which
differs as much from the civil, as the heavens are out of the reach of the
earthly globe?" W. p. 147, 148.

Mr. Cotton often recurs, through his book, to his notion of not punishing men
for any matter of conscience, but only for sinning against their own
consciences after conviction. One great article of Mr. Williams's sentence of
banishment was, his writing letters against the rulers and churches before any
conviction. And Mr. Cotton says of ministers and churches, "none of us had any
further influence, than by private and public conviction of himself, and of the
demerit of his way." C. 2d part, p. 12. And when one of the magistrates was
going to the court that banished Mr. Williams, and asked Mr. Cotton what he
thought of it? his answer was, "I pity the man, and have interceded for him,
whilst there was any hope of doing good; but now he having refused to hear both
his own church and us, and having rejected us all, as no churches of Christ,
before any conviction, we have now no more to say in his behalf, nor hope to
prevail for him." C. p. 39.

This notion of not punishing any in matters of religion, till they had first
convinced their consciences, runs through Mr. Cotton's whole book, as those who
have it may see in the quotations below Page 3, 26, 189; second part, p. 12,
17, 32, 37 -- 39.
; and he tries to support it by Tit. iii, 11, which refers entirely to
ecclesiastical, and not to civil government; and there not to every error, but
only to gross heresy, which was to be judged of by those who were well
acquainted with spiritual things. But, said Mr. Williams,

"Every lawful magistrate, whether succeeding or elected, is not only the
minister of God, but the minister or servant of the people also (what people or
nation soever they be, all the world over) and that minister or magistrate goes
beyond his commission, who intermeddles with that which cannot be given him in
commission from the people, unless master Cotton can prove that all the people
and inhabitants of all nations in the world have spiritual power, Christ's
power, naturally, fundamentally and originally residing in them, to rule
Christ's spouse the church, and to give spiritual laws and commands Those who
are called Lords spiritual in England have no power, since the pope
excommunicated them, but what they derive from the civil state.
; otherwise it is but profaning the holy name of the Most High. It is but
sta^tering of magistrates, it is but the accursed trusting to an arm of flesh,
to persuade rulers of the earth that they are Kings of the Israel or church of
God, who were in their institutions and government immediately from God, the
rulers of his holy chuch and people. Not a few of his opposites will say, and
that aloud, that he and they were or might have been convinced, whatever he or
they themselves thought. The truth is, the carnal sword is commonly the judge
of the conviction or obstinacy of all supposed heresies Dr. Owen wrote a piece
upon toleration soon after Mr. Cotton's book was published in London, and upon
this point he says, "he that holds the truth may be confuted, but a man cannot
be convinced but by the truth That a man should be said to be convinced of a
truth, and yet that truth not shine in upon his understanding, to the expe^lin
of ^he contrary error, to me is strange. To be convinced is to be overpowered
by the evidence of that, which before a man knew not. I once knew a scholar
invite to a dispute with another man, about something in controversy in
religion; in his own, and in the judgment of all the by standers, the opposing
person was utterly confuted: And yet the scholar, within a few months, was
taught of God, and clearly convinced, that it was an error which he had
maintained, and the truth which he opposed; and then, and not till then, did he
cease to wonder, that the other person was not convinced by his strong
arguments, as before he had thought. To say a man is convinced, when either for
want of skill and ability, or the like, he cannot maintain his opinion against
all men, is a mere conceit. -- That they are obstinate and pertinacious is a
cheap supposal, taken up without the price of a proof. As the conviction is
imposed, not owned, so is this obstinacy; if we may be judges of other men's
obstinacy, all will be plain; but if ever they get uppermost, they will be
judges of ours." Collection of Owen's sermons and truths, 1721, p. 312.
. Hence the faithful witnesses of Christ, Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, had not a
word to say in the disputations at Oxford: Hence the Nonconformists were cried
out as obstinate men, abundantly convinced by the writings of Whitgift and
others; and so in the conference before King James at Hampton Court." W. p. 96,
192.

Mr. Williams in discussing his opponent's arguments observed, that his
opponent had taken many charges and exhortations which Christ gave to his
ministers, and directed them to the civil magistrate. But Mr. Cotton says, "the
falsehood of the discussor in this charge is palpable and notorious." Yet fifty
pages forward in the same discourse Mr. Cotton says, "the good that is brought
to Princes and subject by the due punishment of apostate seducers, idolaters
and blasphemers, is manifold. First, it puts away evil from the people, and
cutteth off a gangrene, which would spread to further ungodliness. Deuteronomy, xiii.
5, 2 Timothy ii. 16, 17, 18. Secondly, it drives away wolves from worrying and
scattering the sheep or Christ. False teachers be wolves. Matt. vi. 15, Act.
xx. 29." C. p. 88, 138. This is a clear proof that great men cannot go strait
in a crooked path.

Mr. Williams had argued that Mr. Cotton's doctrine tended to the setting up of
a Spanish inquisition in all parts of the world, and to frustrate the great
design of our Savior's coming. He denies it, and accuses Mr. Williams of
rather promoting the principal end of the Spanish inquisition, "by proclaiming
impunity to all their whorish and wolvish emissaries. Nor is it, says he, a
frustrating of the sweet end of Christ's coming, which was to save souls, but
rather a direct advancing of it, to destroy, if need be, the bodies of those
wolves, who seek to destroy the souls of theose for whom Christ died." C. p. 93.

Mr. Williams replies, "I cannot without great horror observe, what is this but
to give a woeful occasion, at least to all civil powers in the world, to
persecute Christ in his poor saints and servants? Yea, if master Cotton and his
friends of his conscience should be cast by God's providence (whose wheels turn
about in the depth of his councils wonderfully) I say should they be cast under
the reach of opposite swords, will they not produce master Cotton's own bloody
tenet and doctrine to warrant them (according to their consciences) to deal
with him as a wolf, an idolater, an heretic, and as dangerous an emissary and
seducer as any whom master Cotton so accuses? Master Cotton has no reason to
charge the discusser with indulgence or partiality toward Romish and wolvish
emissaries; his judgment and practice is known so far different, that for
departing too far from them (as is pretended) he suffers the brands and bears
the marks of one of Christ's poor persecuted heretics to this day One of the
two points that the Massachusetts began their contention with him upon, was his
refusing to countenance the fellowship they had with popish corruptions in the
church of England.
. All that he pleaded for, is an impartial liberty to their consciences in
worshipping God, as well as consciences and worships of other their fellow
subjects." W. p. 141, 142.

This book Mr. Williams dedicated to the rulers of New England, wherein, after
several useful remarks, he says, "there is one commodity for the sake of which
most of God's children in New England have run mighty hazards; a commodity
marvelously scarce in former times, in our native country: It is the liberty of
searching after God's most holy mind and pleasure. Of this most precious and
invaluable jewel if you suffer Satan to bereave you, and that it shall be a
crime humbly and passibly to question even laws and statutes, or whatever is
even publicly taught and delivered, you will find yourselves after all your
long run (like that little Frenchman who killed the Duke of Guise, and was
taken next morning near the place from whence he had fled upon a swift horse
all night) I say you will most certainly find yourselves but where you were,
enslaved and captivated in the chains of those popish darknesses, viz.
ignorance is the mother of devotion, and we must believe as the church
believes, etc. -- O remember that your gifts are rare, your professions of
religion rare, your persecutions and hidings from the storms abroad rare and
wonderful Persecution drove them into this land, where they were hid from the
bloody storm of intestine wars in England.
! So in proportion your transgressions and public sins cannot but be of a rare
and extraordinary guilt. -- Amongst the crying sins of our own or other sinful
nations, those two are ever among the loudest, viz, invented devotions to the
God of heaven. 2dly, Violence and oppression on the sons of men, especially of
his sons, for dissenting. That the impartial and dreadful hand of the most holy
and jealous God, a consuming fire, tear and burn not up at last the roots of
those plantations, but graciously discerning the plants which are not his, he
may graciously sanctify and cause to flourish what his right hand will own,
this is the humble and unfeigned desire and cry at the throne of grace, of your
so long despised outcast, ROGER WILLIAMS." W. dedication, p. 26, 27.

Thus I have laid before the reader some of the most material points of that
controversy in their own words, that he may see what those principles were
which New England writers have often reproached, under the name of rigid
separation and Anabaptism; and also how the ruling party, with all their boast
of orthodoxy, could confound Jewish types with Christ's institutions, in order
to keep up Paedobaptism, and the use of secular force in religious affairs; and
could separate from the common rights of humanity good Christians, and some of
their own best friends, only for testifying against such confusion!

"At a General Court, March, 1645, two petitions were preferred, one for
suspending (if not abolishing) a law made against Anabaptists the former year;
the other was for easing a law of like nature made in Mrs. Hutchinson's time,
forbidding the entertaining of any strangers, without license of two
magistrates; which was not easily obtained in those days. Some at this time
were much afraid of the increase of Anabaptism. This was the reason why the
greater part prevailed for the strict observation of the aforesaid laws,
although paradventure a little moderation as to some cases might have done very
well, if not beter. Many books coming out of England in the year 1645, some in
defense of Anabaptism and other errors, and for liberty of conscience, as a
shelter for a general toleration of all opinions, etc. others in maintenance of
Presbyterian government (agreed upon by the assembly of divines at Westminster)
against the Congregational way which was practiced in New England; the
ministers of the churches through all the United Colonies agreed upon a meeting
at Cambridge, where they conferred their councils, and examined the writings
which some of them had prepared, in answer to the said books; which being
agreed upon and perfected, were sent over into England to be printed, viz. Mr.
Hooker's Survey, in answer to Mr. Rutherford; Mr. Mather, Mr. Allen and Mr.
Shepard, about the same subject Hubbard.
," etc

Our friend, in London, hearing of the law made at Boston last year to banish
Baptists, and the learned Mr. John Tombs having written an examination of Mr.
Stephen Marshal's sermon upon infant baptism, dedicated to the Westminster
assembly, Mr. Tombs was moved to send a copy of his examination to the
ministers of New England, and wrote an epistle with it to them, dated from the
temple in London, May 25, 1645; hoping thereby to put them upon a more exact
study of that controversy, and to allay their vehemence against the Baptists
Crosby's history, vol: 1, p. 121, 122.
. But the Westminster assembly were more ready to learn severity from this
country, than these were to learn lenity from any; for the Independents on
December 4, 1645, presented a request to that Presbyterian assembly, that they
might not "be forced to communicate as members in those parishes where they
dwell; but may have liberty to have congregations of such persons who give good
testimonies of their godliness, and yet uot of tenderness of conscience cannot
communicate in their parishes; but the assembly returned a flat denial, and
said, this opened a gap for all sects "to chanllenge such a liberty as their
due; and that this liberty was denied by the churches of New England, and we
have as just ground to deny it as they Crosby's history, vol. 1, p. 185, 186.
.

Sir Henry Vane also, when his interest in Parliament was very great, wrote go
Governor Winthrop in the following terms.

Honored Sir,
"I received yours by your son, and was unwilling to let him return without
telling you as much. The exercise and troubles which God is pleased to lay upon
these kingdoms, and the inhabitants in them, teaches us patience and
forbearance one with another in some measure, though there be difference in our
opinions, which makes me hope that, from the experience here, it may also be
derived to yourselves, lest while the Congregational way amongst you is in its
freedom and is backed with power, it teach its oppugners here to extirpate it
and root it out, from its owa principles and practice. I shall need say no
more, knowing your son can acquaint you particularly with our affairs. Sir, I
am your affectionate friend, and servant in Christ,

Had not the notion of securing religion to their posterity, by infant baptism
and the magistrates power, strongly prepossessed their minds, how could they
have resisted all these motives to lenity as they did? That they were under a
very strong bias may be seen in three pieces which were wrote this year against
the Baptists. One of them was by Mr. Cotton, who was so much afraid of having
both sides of the argument examined, that he gives us neither the names of the
authors he wrote against nor the titles of their works; only he owns them to be
such as did not deny magistrates, nor predestination, "nor original sin; nor
maintain free will in conversion, nor apostasy from grace; but only deny the
lawful use of baptism of children, because it wants a word of commandment and
example from the scripture." And he says, "I am bound in Christian love to
believe, that they who yield so far, do it out of conscience, as following
herein the example of the apostle, who professed himself, and his followers, we
can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. But yet I believe withal,
that it is not out of love to the truth that Satan yielded so much to the
truth, but rather out of another ground, and for a worse end. He knows the
times that how, by the good and strong hand of God, they are set upon purity
and reformation. And now to plead against the baptism of children upon any of
those Arminian and popish grounds, which be so grossly ungracious as those above
named, Satan knows and sees they would utterly be rejected Here is an
acknowledgment, that the Baptists of that day did no hold the errors charged
upon them in the aforesaid law.
. He chooses therefore rather to play small game, as they say, than to lose
all. He now pleads no other argument in these stirring times of reformation
than may be urged from a main principle of purity and reformation, viz. that no
duty of God's worship, nor any ordinance of religion, is to be administered in
the church, but such as has just warrant from the word of God. And by urging
this argument against the baptism of children, Satan transformeth himself into
an angle of light; and the spirit of error and profaneness into a minister of
truth and righteousness. And so he hops to prevail, either with those men who
do believe the lawful and holy use of children's baptism to renounce that
principle, and so to renounce also all reformation brought in by it: Or else,
if they stick to that principle, then to renounce the baptism of children; and
so the reformation ^^g^n will neither spread far, ^or continue long For if
godly parents do withdraw their children from the covenant, and from the seal
of the conven^^t they do make void (as much as in them ^e^h the covenant both
to themselves, and to their children; and then will the Lord cut off such s^^^
from his people, Genesis xvii. 14. And so the reformation, begun with a blessing,
will end in a curse, and in a cutting separation either of parents or of
children, or both, from the Lord and his people Cotton's Grounds and Ends of
Children's Baptism, printed 1647, p. 3, 4.
.

About the same time a minister at Lynn wrote a volume against various Baptist
authors; but before he came to any of their arguments he said, ever "since that
word of old, I will put enmity betwixt thee and the woman, and betwixt thy seed
and her seed, Satan has had a special spite at the seed of the church: Witness
that act of Cain, who was therein of that evil one, in killing his brother
Abel: Whence also that project of Satan, all the ways that may be, to lay
foundations of corrupting, and in time ruining the seed of the church by
unequal marriages, etc. Genesis vi. 1, 2, Neh. xiii. 23, 24. Whence also that act
of his, in stirring up his instruments to deride little Isaac. Whence also that
satanical practice of seeking to cut them off by Pharaoh, Exodus i. by Edomires,
Psalm cxxxii. by Babylonians, Jer. ix. Syrians, Dan. viii. Herod, Matt. ii.
etc. or if they be not cut off in such sort, yet to stir up persons under
pretense of religion, to devote them unto the very devil, Jer. vii. 31, etc.
Ezekiel. xvi, 20, etc. or if they live, yet to persuade to their detainment under
an Egyptian estate, and exclusion from any church care or privilege. -- Who
sees not how Satan does seek by such suggestions to undermine the succession
of the true religion, and of true visible churches, which have used to be
continued in and by the church seed? And what is Satan's fetch, to bring this
about, but the old trick, to create (as I may say) scruples in the hearts of
God's people, knowing well that it is a taking wile first to bemist through
such legerdemain the eyes of the mind, and then to spoil them of truth. it took
with our grandmother Eve, and was the inlet of all error and evil. Has God
said it? was the old serpentine insinuation to blind and buzzle, and so corrupt
first the judgment in point of warrant of this or that practice. -- How many
precious professors, to outward view at least, did at first entertain some
scruples about the external interest of church members children in the
covenant, and initiatory seal of it, which now peremptorily censure the same as
antichristian and human inventions? Let my advice be grateful to thee thus far,
Christian reader, to take heed of unnecessary discourses and disputes with
satanical suggestions, under what promising and plausible pretenses soever they
come. -- It is not the first age or time, that satanical suggestions, thus it
is written, and thus says the Lord, has been propounded Mr. Thomas Cobbet's
Vindication of the Covenant and Church Estate of Children of Church Members,
printed in London, 1648, preface, p. 7 -- 9. Mr. Tom^s says Mr. Cotton wrote to
him, that the piece he sent them was delivered to Mr. Cobbet to answer.
.

The question has often been asked in our day what do you think of our good
fathers who held to infant baptism? How did they get along? Here you have an
answer in their own words; and the famous Dr. Thomas Goodwin ushered these
performances into the world with a recommendatory preface to each of them; and
the sentiments and temper of them have evidently been handed down by tradition
ever since. But I appeal to the conscience of every reader, whether he can find
three worse things on earth, in the management of controversy, than first to
secretly take the point disputed for truth without any proof: then secondly
blending that error with known truths, to make artful addresses to the
affections of passions of the audience, to prejudice their minds, before they
hear a word that the respondent has to say. And thirdly, if the respondent
refuses to yield to such management, then to call in the secular arm to
complete the argument. And were not these the methods that were then taken to
support Paedobaptism? The Protestants way of defending their cause against the
Papists was, if that ye will prove that your ceremonies "proceed from faith,
and do please God, ye must prove that God in express words has commanded them,
or else shall you never prove that they proceed from faith, nor yet that they
please God Knox's History of the Reformation, p. 104.
. But when this argument was urged against infant baptism, Cotton without any
proof asserts that Satan transformeth himself into "an angel of light. And the
whole of the above recited addresses to men and women's passions, are evidently
founded upon the supposition, that infant baptism is as infallibly required by
God, as abstaining from the forbidden fruit was, or Abraham circumcising his
children; and having taken the very point which is dispured for truth, without
any evidence, they blended that with many known facts recorded in scripture,
and thereupon rank the oppolers of that point with the old serpent the devil
and Satan, and with his instruments Came, Pharaoh, Herod, and other murderers;
yea with such as sacrificed their children to devils! And this history contains
abundant evidence of their adding the magistrate's sword to all these hard
words, which were ^ied in their prefaces before they came to any of the
Baptist's arguments. When Mr. Cotton came to them, the first of them is, that
in Christ's commission to his ministers, he ordered them first to teach or make
disciples, and then to baptize them; and he says two arguments offer themselves
for his way from hence.

"1. Such as be disciples, they are to baptized; but the children of the
faithful, they are disciples; therefore children of the faithful, they are to be
baptized." And to support this assertion he turns to Isaiah live. 13, all thy
children shall be taught of God; and says he, "if they be taught of God, then
are they disciples; for that is the meaning of the word. Disciples are taught
or learnt of God Cotton's Grounds and Ends, p. 5, 6.
. This is true, and our Lord quotes this text to show how the father draws
souls to himself, and says upon it, every man Note, Christ shows that the word
children in that text means posterity; men that are taught.
therefore "that has heard, and has learned of the father, comes unto me,
John vi. 45. Can we desire a more exact and certain definition of the word
disciple than we have here? And let conscience speak before him who will judged
us all; do you who practice in this disputed way, believe when you bring your
infants to be sprinkled that they have heard and learned of the father, so as
to come unto Christ? And do you bring them because they be taught of God? It
they are not, they are not disciples according to the known meaning of the word.

Mr. Cotton frames his second argument from Exodus xii. 48, where God required
every proselyte to have all his males circumcised, before he could come to the
passover; upon which Cotton says, if "then our Lord's supper come in the room
of the passover, and our baptism in the room of circumcision, like as he that
had not circumcised his males, was accounted as one uncircumcised himself, and
so to be debarred from the passover, so he who has not baptized his children,
is accounted of God as not baptized himself, and so to be debarred from the
Lord's supper. If therefore you forbid baptism to children, you evacuate the
baptism of their parents, and so make the commandment of God, and the
commission to the apostles, and the baptism of believers, of none effect Ibid.
p. 11


These are the two main arguments for infant baptism to this day; and they both
hang upon the little word IF, which I think is a very small pin to rest the
weight of whole provinces and kingdoms upon: If infants are disciples by virtue
of their parents profession, then are they to be baptized; and if our baptism
comes in the place of the circumcision of Jewish proselytes, then we cannot
lawfully omit bringing our infants thereto. But what if this supposition should
prove to be as contrary to truth as darkness is to light, will men persist in
that way still? Abraham had no warrant to circumcise any but such as were
either born in his house or bought with his money. The first order that was
given for bringing in others by households was in the day that Israel came out
of Egypt. Now as we make no pretense of being Abraham's natural posterity, nor
of being bought with Jewish money, the argument all turns upon a supposal that
Gentile believers ought to bring their households with them to baptism, as the
said proselytes did theirs to circumcision. But I know not how words can
express the contrary more plainly than God himself has done in this case; for
he says, his new convenant is not according to that he made with Israel on said
day, Heb. viii. 8 -- 11. Upon this men often assert that the ordinances differ,
while the subject, are the same: But the text assures us expressly, that the
main difference is in the subjects; that the subjects of the new covenant all
know God from the least to the greatest When this is mentioned, they would then
turn it to the difference betwixt the covenant; but that cannot be here
intended, because that distinction was as real in Abraham's time as it is now,
as the apostle shows in Romans iv. 1^, which text is often brought for a proof
that the covenant is the same now as with Abraham. It does prove that the
internal efficacy of divine institutions was the same upon believers then as
now; only their faith was fixed on a future Messiah, ours on one already come.
The difference then betwixt the two covenants we are speaking of, is not
internal, but external. By divine institution a whole family and a whole nation
were then taken into covenant; now none are added to the church by the Lord but
believers who shall be saved, Acts ii. 41, 47. Professors who had not this
character were false brethren unawares brought in, Gal. I^. 4. Their being in
was owing to men's imperfection, and not to God's institution; yet because the
Baptists refused to yield to a practice they viewed to be not only without, but
directly against divine institution, they were abused in the manner above
described; and Mr. Cobbet concludes his discourse with a few inferences, in
which he says, see the "danger and detestableness of Anabaptistical tenets,
giving God and Christ (in part) the lie, vailing the glory of his preventing
grace of covenant, Numb. xi. 18. -- Condemning the judgment and practice of
former churches, Je^^s and Gentiles -- Whence that prophone trick of some to
turn their back upon the churches [when they sprinkled infants] as if all their
persons, and prayers, and fellowship, were unclean: Whence the ^^aling of it
antichristian, etc. What is this but to blaspheme the name and tabernacle and
saints of God? Rev. xiii. Thus the Baptists were accused by those noted authors
of profaneness and blasphemy, only for their manifesting by word and gesture
their dissent from infant sprinkling.

Mr. Nathaniel Ward, of Ipswich (the Indian name of which was Agawam) who, with
Mr. Cotton, had often been improved by the Court in composing their law-book,
published a tract this year under a fanciful title, which contains the
following addresses to the Anabaptists. 1. To entreat them "to consider, what
an high pitch of boldness it is, for a man to cut a principal ordinance out of
the kingdom of God; if it be but to make a dislocation, which so far disgoods
the ordinance, I fear it altogether unhallows it. To transplace or transtime a
stated institution of Jesus Christ, without his direction, I think is to
destroy it How easily may this reasoning be retorted? Christ's institution, and
the apostles administrations of baptism, were expressly to such as believed,
gladly received the word, and should be saved; and those who professed such a
says, went into the water, and were buried in baptism; and according to this
writer's doctrine, how does it destroy the ordinance to change it into
sprinkling of infants?
. 2. What a cruelty it is, to divest children of that only external privilege
which their heavenly father has bequeathed them, to interest them visibly in
himself, his son, his spirit, his covenant of peace, and the tender bosom of
their careful mother the church. 3. What an inhumanity it is, to deprive
parents of that comfort they may take from the baptism of their infants dying
in their childhood. 4. How unseasonably and unkindly it is, to interturbe the
state and church with their Amalakitish onsets, when their lives? 5. To take a
thorough view of those who have perambled this by-path; being sometimes in the
crowds of foreign wederdropers, i. e. Anabaptists, and prying into their inward
frames with the best eyes I had, I could but observe those disguised guises in
the generality of them. 1. A flat formality of spirit, without salt or savor
in the spiritualities of Christ; as if their religion had begun and ended in
their opinion. 2. A shallow slighting of such as dissent from them, appearing
too often in their faces, speeches and carriages. 3. A feeble yet peremptory
obstinacy: Seldom are any of them reclaimed Simple Cobbler of Agawam, p. 16, 17.
Hubbard.
.

By these extracts the reader may see the temper and language of Paedobaptists
in that day; and how much much of the same has there been in later times? Of
charging us with cruelty, because we hold that no acts of men can interest
children in the grace of God, before they are taught and believe his truth; and
because we dare not place our hopes of infants salvation upon the doings of
ministers and churches, instead of the sovereign mercy of God in Jesus Christ,
unto whom we would commit them by believing prayer, and if they live, would use
all gospel methods for their conversion, and obedience to all his commands? How
much also have we seen of their assuming God's prerogative, in judging the
hearts of such as yield not to their arguments?

As all the foregoing means were ineffectual, some of the ministers presented a
bill to the General Court this year, for the calling a synod to settle these
and other ecclesiastical affairs. "The magistrates passed the bill, but some of
the deputies questioned the power of the Court, to require their churches to
send their messengers to such a convention, as not being satisfied that any
such power was given by Christ to the civil magistrates over the churches in
such cases." This caused a debate, the conclusion of which was, that the
ensuing synod should be convened by way of motion only to the churches, and not
in words of command Hubbard.
. The order of it began thus:

"Boston, 15th 3d Month, 1646.

"The right form of church government and discipline being agreed, part of the
kingdom of Christ upon earth, therefore the establishing and settling thereof
by the joint and public agreement and consent of churches, and by the sanction
of civil authority, must needs greatly conduce to the honor and glory of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and to the settling and safety of church and commonwealth,
where such a duty is diligently attended and performed." Upon which they sent
out their motion for said synod; to enforce which they say, "that for want of
the thing here spoken of, some differences of opinion and practice of one
church from another do already appear amongst us; and others (if not timely
prevented) are like speedily to ensue, and this not only in lesser things, but
even in points of no small consequence and very material; to instance in no
more but those about baptism, and the persons to be received thereto, in which
one particular the apprehensions of many persons in the country are known not a
little to differ; for whereas in most churches the ministers do baptize the
children if the grandfather or grandmother be set members, though the immediate
parents be not, and others, though for avoiding of difference of neighbor
churches they do not yet actually so practice, yet they do much incline
thereto. And many persons living in this country who have been members of the
congregations in England, but are no found fit to be received at the Lord's
table here, there be notwithstanding considerable persons in these churches who
do think that children of these also, upon some conditions and terms, may and
ought to be baptized: Likewise on the other side, there be some among us who do
think that whatever be the state of the parents, baptism ought not to be
dispensed to any infants whatsoever; which various apprehensions being seconded
with practices according thereto, as in part they already are, and are like to
be more, must needs, if not timely remedied, beget such differences as will be
displeasing to the Lord, and offensive to others, and dangerous to ourselves."
These were their resons for calling the synod, and the work assigned for them
was to "discuss, dispute, and clear up by the word of God, such questions of
church government, and discipline, in the things aforementioned, or any other
as they shall think needful and meet, and to continue so doing, till they or
the major part of them shall have agreed upon one form of government and
discipline, for the main and substantial parts thereof, as that which they
judge agreeable to the holy scriptures; which when it was finished was to be
presented to the General Court, "to the end that the same being found agreeable
to the word of God, it may receive from the said General Court such approbation
as is meet, that the Lord being thus acknowledged by church and state, to be
our judge, our lawgiver and King, he may be graciously pleased still to save
us, as hitherto he has done This request was also sent to the churches of
Plymouth and Connecticut colonies. Massachusetts Records.
."

Here we may plainly see wherein their great mistake lay. They confounded the
judgment that they formed upon the scripture with the rule itself. Also the
majority assumed the power of judging for the whole, and of punishing
dissenters from their judgments, as breakers of God's law; a delusion that the
world is not clear of to this day, though light and truth have gained much
since that time.

We are told that opposition was made in some of the churches against sending
to that synod, notwithstanding the moderate expressions in the Court's order
for it, and Mr. Hubbard says the principal men who raised it were "some who
lately came from England, where such a vast liberty was pleaded for, by all
that rabble of men that went under the name of Independents, whether
Anabaptists, Antinomians, Familists and Seekers, far beyond the moderate limits
pleaded for by Congregational divines in the assembly at Westminster, such as
Dr. Goodwin, Mr. Nigh, Mr. Buroughs, etc. who yet tacked about further than
they need to have done. A great part of the Parliament also, then in being,
inclined much that ways, and had by their commissioners sent word to all the
English plantations in the West Indies, and Summer Islands, that all men should
enjoy their liberty of conscience; and had by their letters also intimated the
same to those of New England. Some few of the church at Boston adhered to these
principles, which made them stickle so much against the calling of the synod at
that time; against which they raised a threefold objection. 1. That by a
liberty already established among the laws of New England, the elders or
ministers of the churches have liberty to assemble upon all occasions, without
the compliance of the civil authority. 2. It was observed that this motion came
originally from some of the ministers, and not from the Court. 3. In the order
was expressed, that what the major part of the assembly should agree upon
should be presented to the Court for their confirmation.


"To the first it was answered, that said liberty was granted only for help in
case of extremity, if in time to come either the civil authority should grow
opposire to the churches, or neglect the care of them, and not with any intent
to practice the same while the civil rulers were nursing fathers to the church
Mr. Williams in discussing Mr. Cotton's arguments observed, that the higher
powers in Rome, xiii, were strangers to God and true religion, from whence he
argued, that for Paul to command subjection to such in spiritual causes, would
have been to put out the eye of faith, reason and sense, at once. To which Mr.
Cotton answers, the cases of religion wherein we "allow civil magistrates to be
judges, are so fundamental and palpable, that no magistrate studious of
religion in the fo^r of God, but if he have any spiritual discerning, he cannot
but judge of such gross corruptions as unsufferable in religion. -- But for
such magistrates as are merely natural and Pagan, though Christians be bound to
subject themselves to them with patience; yet such magistrates ought to forbear
the exercise of their power, either in protecting or punishing matters of
religion, till they have learned so much knowledge of the truth, as may enable
them to discern of things that differ. Tenet washed, p. 101, 102. In reply to
which Mr. Williams says, O the miserable allowance which master Cotton has
"brought the Kings and governors of the world unto! We allow them to judge in
such fundamentals, etc. -- The magistrate must wait at their gates for their
poor allowance: They shall judge, and they shall not judge; they shall judge
that which is gross and palpable, enough to hold the people in slavery, and to
force them to sacrifice to the priest's belly; but the more sublime and nicer
mysteries they must not judge or touch, but attend upon the tables of the
priests infallibility." Williams's Reply, p. 152 "If Christ Jesus have left
such power with the civil rulers of the world, for the establishing, governing,
and reforming his church, what is become of his care and love, wisdom and
faithfulness, since in all ages since he left the earth, for the general, he
has left her destitute of such qualified princes and governors, and in the
course of his providence furnished her with such, whom he knew would be as fit
as wolves to protect and feed his sheep and people! p. 202.
. To the second it was answered, it was not for the churches to enquire what or
who gave the occasion; but if they thought fit to disire the churches to afford
them help of council in any matter which concerned religion and conscience, it
was the churches duty to yield it to them; for as far as it concerns their
command or request, it is an ordinance of man, which all are to submit unto for
the Lord's sake, without troubling themselves about the occasion or success.
For the third, where the order speaks of the major part, it speaks in its own
language, but it never intended thereby to restrain the synod in the manner of
their proceeding; nor to hinder them, but that they might first acquaint the
churches with their conclusions, and have their assent to them before they did
present them to the Court.

"This matter was two Lord's-days in agitation with the church in Boston,
before they could be brought to any comfortable conclusion; but on a lecture
day intervening, Mr. Norton, teacher of the church at Ipswich, was procured to
supply the place at Boston, where was a great audience; and the subject then
handled was, Moses and Aaron kissing each other in the mount of God. -- On the
next Lord's Day, after much debate in Boston church, it was agreed by the vote
of the major part, that the elders and three of the brethren should be sent to
the synod Hubbard.
."

This account from one of their noted ministers, may give us considerable light
about the actings of that day. He informs us that the synod did not meet till
near winter, when after a session of fourteen days, they adjourned to June 18,
1647; and that summer proving sickly The celebrated Mr. Hooker, mini^^^^ (...)
July 7, 1647.
, they were forced to adjourn again. But on August 16, 1648, they met, and
completed the Cambridge platform; the last article of which says, "if any
church, one or more, shall grow schismatical, rending itself from the communion
of other churches, or shall walk incorrigibly or obstinately in any corrupt way
of their own, contrary to the rule of the word; in such case the magistrate is
to put forth his coercive power, as the matter shall require." Which principle
the Baptists and others felt the cruel effects of for many years af^^^ (...)
clause was also inserted at the end of their tenth chapter, that no church act
can be consummated without the consent of both elders and brethren; which
implicitly gives ministers a power to negative the churches acts, and which
many in later times have contended for; though that would give them such a
lordly power over the church, as chief judges in the state are not allowed to
have in the executive courts of our nation. But as to baptism, though the order
for calling the synod asserted that most ministers DO baptize the grandchildren
of church members, yet that assertion was so far from truth, that those who
labored much to have this principle "declared and asserted in the platform,
could not effect it because of "many worthy men Magnalia, b. iv. p. 176.
." Mr. Hooker had published his testimony, wherein as he asserted, "that
children as children have no right to baptism, so that it belongs not to any
predecessors either nearer or farther off removed from the next parents to give
right of this privilege to their children Survey of Church Discipline, part 3,
p. 13.
:" Mr. Thomas Shepard, pastor of the church where this synod met, had also
publicly asked what members every particular visible church ought to consist
of? and answered, that Christ being "the head of every particular church, and
it his body, hence none are to be members of the church but such as are members
of Christ by faith. And though he observes that hypocrites do sometimes creep
in, yet he says, if they could "have been known to be such, they ought to be
kept out; and when they are known they are orderly to be cast out (...) of the
Oracles of God, p. 25, 26.
. And there was still more regard paid to this first principle of the
New England churches, than could consist with the admission of persons to bring
their children to baptism, who were "not found fit" for the other ordinance.

It may be proper now to take a further view of the affairs of Mr. Gorton and
his company. Upon their being released and banished, as I have related, they
went to Rhode Island, and from thence over to Narraganset, where, on April 19,
1644, they procured a deed from the sachems, whereby they resigned themselves,
people, lands, rights, inheritances and possessions, over unto the protection
and government of King Charles; and appointed Samuel Gorton, and others their
agents, to carry the same to him. This was signed by Passicus, Canaunicus and
Maxan, and witnessed by two Indians and three English. The loss of their great
sachem Miantinomu lay very heavy upon their spirits. Hubbard says he was a very
goodly personage, of tall "stature, subtle and cunning in his contrivements.
In May came a letter to the rulers at Boston, signed by Canaunicus, "though
written by some of Gorton's company, to this effect, that they purposed to make
war upon Uncas, in revenge of the death of Miantinomu and others of their
people, and marvelled that the English should be against it; and that they had
put themselves under the government and protection of the King of England, and
so were become their fellow subjects, and therefore if any difference should
fall between them; it ought to be referred to him; professing withal their
willingness to continue all friendly correspondence with them. The General
Court received another letter from Gorton and his company, to the like effect.
"June 23, news came that the Narragansets had killed six of Uncas's men and
five women, and had sent two hands and a foot to Pumham, to engage him to join
with them, but he chose to keep to the Massachusetts Winthrop -- Hubbard.
. Contentions increased so much the next year that an extraordinary meeting of
the Commissioners of the United Colonies was called at Boston, on July 28,
1645, when they sent three messengers to the Narragansets, who on their return
brought a letter from Mr. Williams to the Commissioners, assuring them that
"war would presently break forth, and that the Narraganset sachems had lately
concluded a neutrality with Providence, and the towns on Aquedneck island."
Upon which they determined to raise an army of 300 men, in the following
proportion, viz. 190 out of the Massachusetts, 40 out of Plymouth, 40 out of
Connecticut, and 30 out of New Haven colonies. Forty were raised immediately,
and sent away under the command of Lieutenant Humphry Atherton, to protect
Uncas, till Capt. Mason should meet him there with the western forces, who were
then to proceed to meet the remainder of the forces from the eastward, in
Narraganset, under the command of Edward Gibbons, Major General. After which
Governor Winthrop informed the Commissioners, "that since Miantinomu's death
the Narraganset sachems by messengers sent him a present, expressing their
desire to keep peace with the English, but desiring to make war with Uncas for
their sachem's death." The present was about the value of 15 pounds in wampum,
but he refused to receive it upon those terms. The Commissioners concluded to
take the present into their hands, and thereupon sent Captain Harding and Mr.
Wilbore to those sachems, who were to take Benedict Arnold with them, and
inform them that their present was returned and not accepted, unless they would
be at peace with Uncas as well as the English; but if said sachems would come
with them to Boston, they should have liberty safely to come and return without
molestation, to treat of peace, though deputies in their stead would not now
do. The messengers returning brought back the present, and informed the
Commissioners that "they found not Benedict Arnold at Providence, and heard
that he durst not adventure himself again amongst the Narraganset Indians
without a sufficient guard. They also understood that Mr. Williams, sent for by
the Narraganset sachems, was going thither, wherefore they acquainted him with
their message, showed him their instructions, and made use of him as an
interpreter. He prevailed with Passicus and others to go to Boston, and moved
the messengers to write and acquaint Captain Mason of the prospect there was of
peace; which last article the Commissioners censured them for, as going beyond
their instructions. The English demanded 2000 fathoms of wampum to pay the
costs of this expedition, and for other damages; which the Indians were
compelled to yield to, and to give hostages till it was paid; and so articles
of peace were drawn up and signed between them. After which the Commissioners
drew up a formal declaration, to justify their proceedings in said war Records
of the United Colonies. Massachusetts History, vol. 3, p. 138 -- 145.
.

The Indians were far from being easy under these things; and in August, 1648,
about 1000 Indians from various parts were collected in Connecticut, with 300
guns among them; and it was reported that they were hired by the Narragansets
to fight with Uncas. The magistrates of Hartford sent three horsemen to enquire
what they designed, and to let them know that if they made war with him the
English must defend him, upon which they dispersed. When the Commissioners met
at Plymouth the next month, they ordered four men to be sent to the
Narragansets, "with instructions how to treat with them, both concerning their
hiring other Indians to war upon Uncas, and also about the tribute of wampum
that was behind. Captain Atherton and Captain Prichard undertook the service,
and going to Mr. Williams, they procured the sachems to be sent for; but they,
hearing that many horsemen were come to take them, shifted for themselves:
Passicus sled to Rhode Island; but soon after they were, by Mr. Williams's
means, delivered of their fears, and came to the messengers as they were
desired, and denied their hiring the Mohawks to war against Uncas, though they
owned that they had sent them a present Canaunicus died a very old man, on June
4, 1648. Hubbard.
.

Gorton, Holden and Green, went to England to carry the Narraganset's
surrendry of themselves and lands, as well as their own complaints, to the
King; but found him not able to help either himself or them. However, they
published their case and a narrative of their sufferings, in 1645, under the
title of Simplicity's Defense against seven-headed Policy. They also applied
themselves to the Commissioners that the Parliament had appointed over the
affairs of the plantations, and at length obtained from them the following
letter to the authority in the Massachusetts colony, viz.

"We being especially entrusted, by both houses of Parliament, with ordering
the affairs and government of the English plantations in America, have some
months since received a complaint from Mr. Gorton and Mr. Holden, in the name
of themselves and diverse other English, who have transported themselves into
New England, and now are or lately were inhabitants of a tract of land called
the Narraganset Bay (a copy of which complaint the enclosed petition and
narrative will represent unto your knowledge) we could not proceed forthwith to
a full hearing and determining of the matter, it not appearing unto us that you
were acquainted with the particular charge, or that you had furnished any
persons with power to make defense in your behalf; nor could we conveniently
respite some kind of resolution, without a great prejudice to the petitioners,
who would have lain under much inconveniency if we had detained them from their
families, till all the formalities and circumstances of proceeding (necessary
at this distance) had regularly prepared the cause for a hearing. We shall
therefore let you know in the first place, that our present resolution is not
grounded upon an admittance of the truth of what is charged; we knowing well
how much God has honored your government, and believing that your spirit and
affairs are acted by principles of justice, prudence and zeal to God; and
therefore cannot easily receive any evil impressions concerning your
proceedings. In the next place you may take notice that we found the
petitioners aim and desire, in the result of it, was not so much a reparation
of what was passed, as a settling their habitations for the future, under that
government, by a charter of civil incorporation, which was heretofore granted
them by ourselves. We find withal that the tract of land called the Narraganset
Bay, concerning which the question is arisen, was diverse years since inhabited
by those of Providence, Portsmouth and Newport, who are interested in the
complaint; and that the same is wholly without the bounds of the Massachusetts
patent granted by his Majesty. We have considered that they be English, that
the forcing of them to find out new places of residence will be very
chargeable, difficult and uncertain, and therefore, upon the whole matter, do
pray and require you to permit and suffer the petitioners, and all the late
inhabitants of Narraganset Bay, with their families, and such as shall
hereafter join with them, freely and quietly to live and plant upon the
Shawomet, and such other part of the said tract of land, within the bounds
mentioned in our said charter, on which they have formerly planted and lived,
without extending your jurisdiction to any part thereof, or otherwise
disquieting them in their consciences or civil peace, or interrupting them in
their possessions, until such time as we shall have received your answer to
their claim in point of title, and you shall thereupon have received our
further order therein. And in case any others, since the petitioners address to
England, have taken possession of any part of the lands heretofore enjoyed by
the petitioners, or any their associates, you are to cause them that are newly
possessed as aforesaid to be removed, that this order may be fully performed.
And, till our further order, neither the petitioners are to enlarge their
plantations, nor are any others to be suffered to intrude upon any part of the
Narraganset Bay; and if they shall be found hereafter to abuse this favor, by
any act tending to disturb your rights, we shall express a due sense thereof,
so as to testify our care of your honorable protection and encouragement. In
order to the effecting of this resolution we do also require, that you suffer
the said Mr. Gorton, Mr. Holden, Mr. Green, and their company, with their
goods and necessaries, to pass through any part of that territory which is
under your jurisdiction, toward the said tract of land, without molestation,
they demeaning themselves civilly, any former sentence of expulsion otherwise
notwithstanding. We shall only add, that to these orders of ours we shall
expect a conformity, not only from yourselves, but from all other governments
and plantations in New England whom it may concern. And so commending you to
God's gracious protection, we rest your loving friends.

"From the Governor in Chief, loving Admiral, and Commissioners for foreign
plantations, sitting at Westminster, 15 May, 1646.

"To our loving friends the Governor, Deputy Governor and Assistants of the
Massachusetts plantations, in New England.

Warwick, Governor and Admiral, Northumberland, Nottingham, John Holland, H.
Vane Providence Records.
," etc.
With this order and resolution Mr. Gorton and his friends returned to Boston,
where they were in motion to apprehend them, till upon showing the state's
order they were permitted to return to Shawomet, which, in honor to their
friend the Admiral, they called Warwick. Sundry of them lived there to old age,
and were considerably improved in the government of the colony.

As there was no particular form of government, nor appointment of officers in
their charter, it took a length of time to settle upon a method that was
agreeable to the majority of the inhabitants. Their first General Assembly met
at Portsmouth on May 19, 1647, when Mr. John Coggshall was ch^sen President,
Mr. Roger Williams Assistant for Providence, Mr. John Sanford for Portsmouth,
Mr. William Coddingdon for Newport, and Mr. Randal Holden for Warwick. Mr.
William Dyre was chosen recorder. They agreed upon a body of laws, chiefly
taken from the laws of England, with the addition of a few suited to their
particular circumstances. They also ordered, that forasmuch "as Mr. Roger
Williams has taken great pains, and expended much time, in obtaining the
charter for this province, of our noble Lords and Governors, be it enacted and
established, that in regard to his so great trouble, charges and good
endeavors, we do freely give and grant unto the said Mr. Roger Williams an
hundred pounds, to be levied out of the three towns, viz. fifty pounds out of
Newport, thirty pounds out of Portsmouth, twenty pounds out of Providence;
which rate is to be levied and paid in by the last of November.

The form of government which they came into was thus to elect a President and
four Assistants annually, who had the executive power, were judges in the
courts of law, and kept the peace. An Assembly of six Commissioners, or
Representatives from each town, made laws and ordered their general affairs;
but their laws must be sent to every town, to be deliberately considered in
their town meetings, from whence the clerk was to send an account of their
votes to the general recorder In May, 1660, they enacted that the return of
their votes to the recorder must be made in three months.
, and if the majority of the towns approved the law, it was confirmed, if not,
it was disannulled. The Assembly chose yearly a general recorder and general
sergeant; which are only other names for a secretary and sheriff. In each town
six persons were yearly chosen, who were called the town-council, who had the
powers of a Court of Probate, of granting licenses to innkeepers and
retailers, and the care of the poor.

Persons of almost all sentiments and tempers had resorted to this new colony,
and various contentions and parties had appeared, which were not easily
composed and reconciled; but toward the obtaining of such a desirable end, the
following covenant was drawn and signed at Providence, viz. "considering the
great mercy afforded unto us, is this liberty thus to meet together, being
denied to many of our countrymen in most parts, especially in our poor native
country, now deploring their distressed condition in most sad and bloody
calamities: That ingratitude and disacknowledgments for favors received, are
just causes for the deprivation of them, together with home divisions and home
conspiracies, the ruination of families, towns and countries: Moreover, the
many plots and present endeavors at home and abroad, not only to disturb our
peace and liberties, but utterly to root up both root and branch of this our
being; that government held forth through love, union and order, although by
few in number and mean in condition, yet (by experience) has withstood and
overcome mighty opposers; and above all, the several unexpected deliverances of
this poor plantation, by that mighty providence who is still able to deliver
us, through love, union and order: Therefore being sensible of these great and
weighty premises, and now met together to consult about our peace and liberty,
whereby our families and posterity may still enjoy these favors; and that we
may publicly declare unto all the free discharge of all our consciences and
duties, whereby it may appear upon record that we are not wilfully opposite,
nor careless and senseless, and thereby the means of our own and others ruin
and destruction; and especially in testimony of our fidelity and cordial
affection unto one another here present, that so there may be a current
placable proceeding, we do faithfully and unanimously, by this our
subscription, promise unto each other to keep unto these ensuing particulars.
First, that the foundation in love may appear among us, what causes of
difference have heretofore been given, either by word or misbehaviour, in
public or private, concerning particular or general affairs, by any of us here
present, not to mention or repeat them in the assembly, but that love shall
cover the multitude of them in the grave of oblivion. Secondly, that union may
proceed from love, we do promise to keep constant unto those several
engagements made by us, both unto our town and colony, and that to the
uttermost of our powers and abilities to maintain our lawful rights and
privileges, and to uphold the government of this plantation. Also that love may
appear in union, we desire to abandon all causless fears and jealousies of one
another; self-seeking and striving one against another, only aiming at the
general and particular peace and union of this town and colony. Lastly, for our
more orderly proceeding in this assembly, whereby love and union may appear in
order, if in our consultations differences in judgment shall arise, then
moderately in order, through argumentation, to agitate the same; considering
the cause how far it may be hurtful, or conducing unto our union, peace and
liberty, and accordingly act, not after the will or person of any, but unto the
justice and righteousness of the cause. Again, if such cause shall be presented
wherein such difficulties shall appear, that evident arguments cannot be given
for present satisfaction, but that either town or colony or both shall suffer,
then to take into our consideration a speech of a beloved friend, "better to
suffer an inconvenience than a mischief," better to suspend with a loss which
may be inconvenient, than to be totally disunited and bereaved of all rights
and liberties, which will be a mischief indeed. Moreover that offenses and
distractions may be prevented, that so the current of business may peaceably
proceed in this assembly, we do faithfully promise to carry ourselves, in words
and behavior, so moderately and orderly as the cause shall permit, and if any
of us shall fly out in provoking, scurrilous, exorbitant speeches, and
unsuitable behavior, that he or they so doing shall be publicly declared,
branded and noted upon record to be a covenant violator, and disturber of the
union, peace and liberty of this plantation. We do here subscribe without
partiality. Dated December, 1647.

Robert Williams, Roger Williams, John Smith, Hugh Bewit, William Wickenden,
John Tripp, Thomas Hopkins, William Hawkins."
THIS preferring of the public good to private interest or inclination, Mr.
Williams discovered as much of, through his life, as perhaps any man has done
in latter ages; but alas! he had to do with many who were not of this
disposition.

IN their General Assembly at Providence, May 16, 1648, Mr. Coddington was
elected President, and Jeremiah Clarke, Roger Williams, William Baulston, and
John Smith, Assistants; Philip Sherman, recorder, and Alexander Partridge,
general sergeant; but Mr. Coddington absented himself, Mr. Dyre, the late
recorder, having exhibited diverse bills of complaint against him, and he did
not attend "this Court for the clearing of the accusations charged upon him;
upon which the Assembly passed an act that in such a case the Assistant of the
town where the President lived should supply his place All the articles from
Mr. Gorton's return till now are taken from the colony and Providence town
records, compared with Mr. Callender and others.
.

MR. Coddington wrote to Gevernor Winthrop the 25th of the same month, that Mr.
Baulstone, "and some others of this island, are in disgrace with the people in
Providence, Warwick, and Gorton's adherents on the island, for that we will not
interpose or meddle at all in their quarrels with the Massachusetts, and the
rest of the colonies; and do much fear that Gorton will be a thorn in their
sides, if the Lord prevent not. And when the Commissioners of the United
Colonies met in September this year, he and Captain Partridge went to them and
said, our request and motion is "in "the behalf of our island, that we the
islanders of Rhode Island may be received into a combination with all the
United Colonies of New England, into a firm and perpetual league of friendship
and amity, for offense and defense, mutual advice and succor, upon all just
occasions, for our mutual safety and welfare, and for preserving of peace
amongst ourselves, and preventing, as much as may be, all occasions of war or
differences, and to this our motion we have the consent of the major part of
our island. WILLIAM CODDINGTON, ALEXANDER PARTRIDGE.


THUS, under a pretense of promoting peace, they would have separated the
island from the rest of that little colony. However the Commissioners were not
willing to own them as a distinct colony, but would have the island to be
included in Plymouth patent, and if the majority of its inhabitants would
acknowledge themselves to be under that jurisdiction, they were willing then to
afford them the same advice and help as they did to others Massachusetts
History, vol. 3, p. 225, 226.
Mr. Edward Winslow had been sent over to England their agent, to answer the
complaints of Gorton's company, and to support their claims against that little
colony; but he wrote from London to the Commissioners of the United Colonies,
April 17, 1651, and said, since "I perceived by letters from Plymouth, that
after another year's warning nothing is likely to be done, in reference to the
old order of Lords and Commons sent over; I looked upon it as a vain thing to
strive against the stream; whereas indeed that was the main material objection
above a twelvemonth since, which I could not answer that we had such an order,
but never looked after the performance thereof, nor made any return upon it
Ibid. p. 229.
.

WHILE various parties were exerting themselves in different ways, Mr. Williams
on August 31, 1648, made the following motion to the town of Providence, viz.

"WORTHY friends, that ourselves and all men are apt and prone to differ, it is
no new thing. In all former ages, in all parts of the world, in these parts,
and in our dear native country and mournful state of England, that either part
or party is most right in his own eyes, his cause right, his carriage right,
his arguments right, his answers right, is as woefully and constantly true as
the former. And experience tells us, that when the God of peace has taken
peace from the earth, one spark of action, word or carriage, is too too
powerful to kindle such a fire as burns up towns, cities, armies, navies,
nations and kingdoms. And since, dear friends, it is an honor for men to cease
from strife; since the life of love is sweet, and union is as strong as sweet;
and since you have been lately pleased to call me to some public service, and
my soul has been long musing how I might bring water to quench, and not oil or
fuel to the flame, I am now humbly bold to beseech you, by all those comforts
of earth and heaven which a placable and peaceable spirit will bring to you,
and by all those dreadful alarms and warnings either amongst ourselves, in
deaths and sicknesses, or abroad in the raging calamities of the sword, death
and pestilence; I say I humbly and earnestly beseech you to be willing to be
pacifiable, willing to be reconcilable, willing to be sociable, and to listen
to the (I hope not unreasonable) motion following: To try out matters by
disputes and writings, is sometimes endless; to try out arguments by arms and
swords, is cruel and merciless; to trouble the state and Lords of England, is
most unreasonable, most chargeable; to trouble our neighbors of other
colonies, seems neither safe nor honorable. Methinks, dear friends, the colony
now looks with the torn face of two parties, and that the greater number of
Portsmouth, with other loving friends adhering to them, appear as one grieved
party; the other three towns, or greater part of them, appear to be another:
Let each party choose and nominate three; Portsmouth and friends adhering
three, the other party three, one out of each town: Let authority be given to
them to examine every public difference, grievance and obstuction of justice,
peace and common safety: Let them, by one final sentence of all or the greater
part of them, end all, and set the whole into an unanimous posture and order,
and let them set a censure upon any that shall oppose their sentence. One log,
without your gentle help, I cannot stir; it is this: How shall the minds of the
towns be known? How shall the persons chosen be called? Time and place
appointed in any expedition? For myself I can thankfully embrace the help of
Mr. Coddington or Mr. Clarke, joined or apart, but how many are there who will
attend (as our distempers are) to neither? It is, gentlemen, in the power of
the body to require the help of any of her members, and both King and
Parliament plead, that in extraordinary cases they have been forced to
extraordinary ways for common safety. Let me be friendly construed, if (for
expedition) I am bold to be too too forward in this service, and to say, that
if within twenty days of the date hereof, you please to send to my house, at
Providence, the name of him whom you please to nominate, at your desire I will
acquaint all the persons chosen with place and time, unto which in your name I
shall desire their meeting within ten days, or thereabouts, after the receipt
of your letter. I am your mournful and unworthy ROGER WILLIAMS Providence
Records
.

THIS address had such effect, that Mr. Williams was received to act as
President of the colony, till their election at Warwick, May 22, 1649, when Mr.
John Smith was chosen President, and Thomas Olney, John Sanford, John Clarke,
and Samuel Gorton, Assistants; Philip Sherman, recorder; Richard Knight,
sergeant, and John Clarke, treasurer. Mr. Williams was chosen to take "a view
of the records delivered into the Court by Mr. William Dyre. And they made a
law that if a President should be elected, and should refuse to serve, he
should be fined ten pounds; and if an Assistant refused, five pounds. Also
"ordered that a messenger be sent to Pumham and the other sachem, to require
them to come to this Court; and that letters be sent to Benedict Arnold and his
father, and the rest of Pawtuxet, about their subjecting to this colony." Mr.
Dyre again presented his complaints against Mr. Coddington, but they were
deferred.

AT the Assembly at Newport, May 23, 1650, a fresh order was sent to the towns,
to collect and pay what they owed to Mr. Williams for the charter, within
twenty days. William Arnold and William Carpenter, instead of submitting to the
government of their own colony, went again and entered complaints against some
of their neighbors to the Massachusetts rulers, and they sent a citation to
them to come and answer the same in their courts, dated from Boston, June 20,
1650, signed by Edward Rawson, secretary Providence Records.
. Such obstructors of good government were they who have made a great noise in
the world about the disorders of Rhode Island colony! In 1651, Mr. Coddington
caused a terrible difficulty among them, as will be seen in its place, though
another affair must be attended to first.

CHAP. IV. An Account of Mr. Clarke and Mr. Holmes, and of their Sufferings at
Boston in 1651.
IT has already been seen that Mr. John Clarke was a principal instrument in
procuring Rhode Island for a people who were persecuted elsewhere, and that he
was the first religious minister on the island, and serviceable also in their
civil government; yet all this did not prevent his being most abusively treated
this year in Boston, with two other members of his church.

THE best account of Mr. Obadiah Holmes that I have seen, is in a manuscript
which he left to his children, that a gentleman of his posterity has favored
me with; an extract of which I will give in his own words. Says he,

"FIRST, I must remember my honored parents, who were faithful in their
generation, and of good report among men, and brought up their children
tenderly and honorably. Three sons they brought up at the university in Oxford;
but the most of their care was to inform and instruct them in the fear of the
Lord; and to that end gave them much good counsel, carrying them often before
the Lord by earnest prayer; but I, the most rebellious of all, did neither
hearken to counsel nor any instruction, for from a child I minded nothing but
folly and vanity, and as years did grow on, and wisdom should have taken place,
then the wisdom I had was wise to do evil, but to do well had no knowledge. --
As days and strength increased, even so did my transgressions, so that I became
hardened in sin, not only to be drawn into it by others, but was as forward to
draw others into evil as my fellows -- being come to that height of wickedness
that I did think it best when I could do the most wickedness, and began to
think that it was but a foolish thing to talk of God, that should bring man to
judgment -- Continuing in such a course for four or five years, and then began
to bethink what counsel my dear parents had given me, many a time with tears
and prayers; my rebellion to my honored parents then looked me in open face,
and my dear mother being sick, it struck to me my disobedient acts, which
forced me to confess the same to her. After this I began to go to hear the word
preached, but every word was against me, and left me without hope of mercy; and
sometimes passing over a field called the Twenty Acres, stood still and said,
oh! that I might lie in hell but so many years as here are grass! It would have
an end. -- That word was ever before me, the wicked shall be turned to hell --
where the worm dies not, etc. And yet at this time Satan tells me, it is best
to put such thoughts out of mind, and take pleasure while thou art here, and
return to thy former merry companions and friends; which I did for a time; but
the worm in the conscience did still gnaw. I went to hear the most noted men I
could, but found it still against me; yet often heard them say, I must repent
and be humbled, and must pray: and then should find mercy; but must confess
sins and forsake them; which brought me to a resolution, in the most public way
or company I could find, ever so to do; and had done it through ignorance, had
not a friend advised me to the contrary, and that upon good grounds. But he
also put me upon prayer and hearing. I then fell to prayer and duties, but
found no rest or quiet in my soul; for then Satan let fly at me, and told me,
it was too late to return, for there was no hope for me. I answered him, and
did instance several of my wicked companions God had shown mercy unto a little
before. He answered, remember thou scorned, mocked and derided them; yea saying
the devil was in them, they were all mad, and become fools; and withal he told
me I had read and heard that there was a sin that never could be forgiven, the
which sin I had committed. With this assault he fooled me a long time; even my
life was a burden to me. Oh! the knives, ropes, trees, coal-pits, can witness
the many escapes of them, as one in a most undone, desperate condition, as one
appointed to eternal destruction. The perplexity of mind brought me to great
weakness in body, and yet for ease and comfort I turned over every stone,
hearkened to all my acquaintance and friends, as to leave off my old ways, and
all my old companions, which I had done before; but all this while I never
considered sin according to the true nature of it, as being loathsome to the
Lord, but as it brought judgment upon me; yet was I fearful to sin, and began
to love to read the scriptures, and frequent prayer and other duties, and took
delight among professors that were of the strictest sort, easily seeing the
gross evil and danger of the formal ministers and professors, and so that
conformity was only superstition and a name: Yet for all that I had no rest in
my soul, though I was in a manner as strict as any. As I was enlarged in sorrow
for sin, deep in humiliation, enlarged in prayer, or filled with tears, my
comfort came in and increased; but as I failed in them, so my sorrows renewed;
and when I looked over my best performances found them full of sin. Oh! then
the fears, doubts and questioning of my own estate! I judged it was all done in
hypocrisy, which sin my soul did then abhor. In this sad and doubtful state I
continued very long, yea many years. And although I could speak comfortably to
others, yet had often much disquiet within my soul; my comforts were according
to my enlargements. Not long after this there was in me a great love to the
Lord; but alas! I was deceived by my own heart, and the ministers who told me
there must be such and such a love to him, as to keep to him in duty, and to
part with all for him, but they left me short of understanding him as I should,
and my selfish heart was willing to love him or part with all for him, yea my
dear honored father, brethren and friends, house and lands, and my own native
country, for time, and to avoid those popish relics of the bishops, and that
filthy rabble, and to separate from them, and all those that mention them; and
was fully known in my own country, and adventured the danger of the seas to
come to New England, where I tried all things in several churches, and for a
time thought I had made a good choice or change: But in truth it little
differed from former times, and my spirit was like a wave tossed up and down,
as not yet come to dig so deep as I should, or to consider the only ground of a
well-grounded hope, which God at last brought me to consider, which is, his own
love to poor lost man, which first was in his own secret council and purpose
before man was, and revealed to man in his time; and that there is no
preparative necessary to obtain Christ, nor any thing to deserve that love, or
to merit the same. And nothing could stay or satisfy my soul till I came to
consider why, when and upon whom he laid sin and transgression, namely, on the
Lord, and on him alone. And looking at me when a rebel, an enemy, yea dead in
sin and trespasses, yea in my blood, he then said, live, through the blood of
Christ be cleansed, and in him be loved, for his own love to poor man, and that
the election may obtain it, for he knows who are his; but his good will is
manifested before they have done either good or evil, so that neither good
foreseen shall prevail, nor evil original or actual shall hinder, but that free
grace may have its free course; but manifested when he gives faith to believe
the promise of the Father in giving a full discharge to the soul, by taking
full satisfaction from his only Son, who became sin for us, who knew no sin,
that we might be made the righteousness of God through him; and so remission
and free pardon is granted forth, that whosoever believes in him shall not
perish, but have everlasting life; and all those that so come to him he will no
ways cast away. And when God had given me to see in any measure this love of
his, then and not till then could I give over working for life, and to live in
working. But at last he caused me to say, that from life I must work, and then
all my former turnings and returnings must come to naught, yea all my
righteousness as filthy rags, and to account all as dung, so I might obtain
Christ; or rather that I might be accepted by him, and so removed me from the
covenant of works to the covenant of grace, even that new covenant of life
alone by himself, who paid so dear a price, as to lay down his own blood to
wash, cleanse and purify the soul, and to redeem both soul and body to serve
the Lord; and that is now the life I live by faith in the Son of God; and this
faith causes works of faith, or rather fruits that flow from that root, so that
now love has constrained me to yield myself to live to him, as to a king to
rule me by his holy laws and commandments, and as to an only prophet to teach
and instruct me, both to know and to do his holy will, and as my only chief
priest to offer a sacrifice for me, which he did even for all, whereby my poor
imperfect prayers and all other services became accepted of the Father; and
this love, shed abroad in my heart, wrought in me a restless desire to know his
will, that I might show forth the praises and glory of him, that had called me
by his grace."

As the sentiments of the ancient Baptists in this country have been grossly
misrepresented, and as Mr. Holmes was no small sufferer in that cause, I
thought it expedient to let the reader thus far hear him speak for himself, or
tell his own experience and ideas about the nature of true religion. When he
first came to this land he joined with the chuch in Salem, with whom he walked
six or seven years, and then about the year 1645 was dismissed to the
Congregational church in Seaconck (Rehoboth) newly settled there, under the
ministry of Mr. Samuel Newman; and he continued in that relation about four
years, till an unrighteous act, as he judged, of the minister and part of the
church, for which they would not give satisfaction, caused Mr. Holmes and
several more to withdraw, and set up a meeting by themselves, and being
convinced that the Baptist's way was right, a number of them were baptized, I
suppose by the aforesaid Mr. Clarke, for they joined to his church. After this
Mr. Newman pronounced a sentence of excommunication against Mr. Holmes, upon
which he and two more were presented to the General Court at Plymouth, June 4,
1650, where they met with four petitions against them, one from their own town
with thirty-five hands to it, one from the church at Taunton, one from all the
ministers but two in Plymouth colony, and a fourth from the Court at Boston,
under their secretaries hand, urging Plymouth rulers to suppress them speedily
Clarke's Narrative, p. 18, 25. Plymouth Records.


HERE we may observe the great difference between our Plymouth fathers, and the
Massachusetts. With all these stimulations to severity, the Court of Plymouth
only charged them to desist from their practice, which others had taken such
offense at, and one of them yielding thereto, the others, viz. Obadiah Holmes
and Joseph Tory, were bound over to the next October Court, but were not so
much as bound to their good behavior, nor any other sureties required, only
they were bound one "for another in the sum of ten pounds a piece, for their
appearance at said Court.

"AT a General Court holden at New-Plymouth the second of October, 1650, before
William Bradford, gentleman, Governor, Thomas Prince, William Collyare, Capt.
Miles Standish, Timothy Hethe^ly, William Thomas, John Allen, gentlemen,
Assistants, [and a House of Deputies.]

Presentment by the Grand Inquest.

October 2 cond, 1650.

"WE whose names are here underwritten, being the grand inquest, do present
to this Court John Hazell, Mr. Edward Smith and his wife, Obadiah Holmes,
Joseph Tory and his wife, and the wife of James Man, William Deuell and his
wife, of the town of Rehoboth, for the continuing of a meeting upon the
Lord's day from house to house, contrary to the order of this Court, enacted
June 12, 1650. THOMAS ROBINSON,

HENRY TOMSON," etc. to the number of 14 Plymouth Records.
.

THIS is an exact copy of their presentment, but no sentence appears upon
record against them. How different is this from the actings of Boston Court the
next year Mr. Hazel wrote to his cousin Hubbard, of Newport, June 23, 1651,
that they were then threatened with a fine of 10 s. ^ day for every person who
set up any other meeting, and that their absence from the town meeting the day
before should prove costly. Samuel Hubbard's manuscript. Mr. Hazel died soon
after, near Boston; the rest of them moved to Newport, where I find that Edward
Smith, Joseph Torry, James Man and William Deuall, were admitted freemen May
17, 1653, Smith was afterward a magistrate, and Torry many years secretary of
the colony, as well as a teacher in Mr. Clarke's church, in which Mr. Holmes
also ministered for many years.
! For on July 19, 1651, Messieurs Clarke, Holmes and Crandal, "being the
representatives of the church in Newport, upon the request of William Witter,
of Lynn, arrived there, he being a brother in the church, who, by reason of his
advanced age, could not undertake so great a journey as to visit the church
Newport church papers.
." He lived about two miles out of town, and the next being the Lord's Day,
they concluded to spend it in religious worship at his house; and Mr. Clarke
says, "finding by sad experience, that the hour of temptation spoken of was
coming upon all the world (in a more eminent way) to try them that are upon the
earth, I fell upon the consideration of that promise, made to those that keep
the word of his patience, which present thoughts, while in conscience toward
God, and good will unto his faints, I was imparting to my companions in the
house where I lodged, and to four or five strangers that came in unexpected
after I had begun, opening and proving what is meant by the hour of temptation,
what by the word of his patience, and their keeping it, and how he that has
the key of David (being the promiser) will keep those that keep the word of his
patience from the hour of temptation: While I say I was yet speaking, there
comes into the house where we were two constables, who, with their clamorous
tongues, made an interruption in my discourse, and more uncivilly disturbed us
than the pursuivants of the old English bishops were wont to do, telling us
that they were come with authority from the magistrate to apprehend us. I then
desired to see the authority by which they thus proceeded, whereupon they
plucked forth their warrant, and one of them with a trembling hand (as
conscious he might have been better employed) read it to us; the substance
whereof was as follows: "BY virtue hereof, you are required to go to the
house of William Witter, and so to search from house to house, for certain
erroneous persons, being strangers, and them to apprehend, and in safe custody
to keep, and tomorrow morning by eight o'clock to bring before me,

ROBERT BRIDGES."

"WHEN he had read the warrant, I told them, friends, there shall not be, I
trust, the least appearance of a resisting of that authority by which you come
unto us; yet I tell you, that by virtue hereof you are not so strictly tied,
but if you please you may suffer us to make an end of what we have begun, so
may you be witnesses either to or against the faith and order which we hold. To
which they answered they ^ould not; then said we, notwithstanding the warrant,
or any thing therein contained, you may. -- They apprehended us, and carried us
away to the alehouse ordinary, where at dinner one of them said unto us,
gentlemen, if you be free I will carry you to the meeting; to whom it was
replied, friend, had we been free thereunto we had prevented all this,
nevertheless we are in thy hand, and if thou will carry us to the meeting,
thither will we go; to which he answered, then will I carry you to the meeting;
to this we replied, if thou forcest us unto your assembly, then shall we be
constrained to declare ourselves, that we cannot hold communion with them. The
constable answered, that is nothing to me; I have not power to command you to
speak when you come there, or to be silent. To this I again replied, since we
have heard the word of salvation by Jesus Christ, we have been taught, as those
that first trusted in Christ, to be obedient unto him both by word and deed;
wherefore if we be forced to your meeting, we shall declare our dissent from
you both by word and gesture. After all this, when he had consulted with the
man of the house, he told us he would carry us to the meeting; so to their
meeting we were brought, while they were at their prayers, and uncovered; and
at my first steping over the threshold I unveiled myself, civily saluted them,
and turned into the seat I was appointed to, put on my hat again, and sat down,
opened my book, and fell to reading. Mr. Bridges being troubled, commanded the
constable to pluck off our hats, which he did, and where he laid mine there I
let it lie, until their prayers, singing and preaching was over; after this I
stood up, and uttered myself in these words following: I desire as a stranger
to propose a few things to this congregation, hoping in the proposal thereof I
shall commend myself to your consciences, to be guided by that wisdom that is
from above, which being pure is also peaceable, gentle, and easy to be
entreated; and therewith made a stop, expecting if the Prince of peace had been
among them, I should have had a suitable answer of peace from them. -- Their
pastor answered, we will have no objections against what is delivered. To which
I answered, I am not about at present to make objections against what is
delivered, but as by my gesture at my coming into your assembly, I declared my
dissent from you, so least that should prove offensive unto some whom I would
not offend, I would now by word of mouth declare the grounds, which are these:
First, from the consideration we are strangers each to other, and so strangers
to each other's inward standing with respect to God, and so cannot conjoin and
act in faith, and what is not of faith is sin. And in the second place, I could
not judge that you are gathered together, and walk according to the visible
order of our Lord; which when I had declared, Mr. Bridges told me, I had done,
and spoke that for which I must answer, and so commanded silence. When their
meeting was done, the officers carried us again to the ordinary, where being
watched over that night, as thieves and robbers, we were the next morning
carried before Mr. Bridges, who made our mittimus, and sent us to the prison at
Boston It appears that somehow they were permitted to meet again on Monday, and
were sent to prison on Tuesday.
; the words of the mittimus are these:

To the Keeper of the Prison at Boston.

"BY virtue hereof you are required to take into your custody from the
constable of Lynn, or his Deputy, the bodies of John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes and
John Crandal, and them to keep until the next county Court to be held at
Boston, that they may then and there answer to such complaints as may be
alleged against them; for being taken by a constable at a private meeting at
Lynn, upon the Lord's Day, exercising among themselves, to whom diverse of the
(...) repaired, and joined with them, and that in the (...) of the public
exercise of the worship of God; as also for offensively disturbing the peace of
the congregation, at their coming into the public meeting in the time of prayer
in the afternoon, and for saying and manifesting that the church in Lynn was
not constituted according to the order of our Lord, and for such other things
as shall be alleged against them, concerning their seducing and drawing others
after their erroneous judgments and practices, and for suspicion of having
their hands in re-baptizing of one or more among us, as also for neglecting or
refusing to put in sufficient security for their appearance at the said Court.
Hereof fail not at your peril.

22, 5, 51. ROBERT BRIDGES Clarke's Narrative, p. 1 -- 4.
.

ON July 31, Mr. Clarke was brought before the Court, and fined twenty pounds,
or to be well whipped; and the crimes he was charged with, beside what is above
mentioned, were, that he met again the next day after his contempt, as they
call it, of their public worship, at the house of Witters, and in contempt "of
authority; being then in the custody of the law, did there administer the
sacrament of the Lord's supper to one excommunicated person, to another under
admonition, and to a third that was an inhabitant of Lynn, and not in
fellowship with any church, and yet upon answer in open Court did affirm, that
he never rebaptized any, etc. Neal's History of New England, vol. 1, p. 30.
And, says Mr. Clarke, "none were able to turn to the law of God or man by
which we were condemned. At length the Governor stepped up, and told us we had
denied infants baptism, and being somewhat transported, told me, I had deserved
death, and said he would not have such trash brought into their jurisdiction;
moreover he said, "you go up and down, and secretly insinuate into those that
are weak, but you cannot maintain it before our ministers. You may try and
dispute with them. To this I had much to reply, but he commanded the jailer to
take us away. So the next morning, having so fair an opportunity, I made a
motion to the Court in these words following:

To the honorable Court assembled at Boston.

"WHEREAS it pleased this honored Court yesterday to condemn the faith and
order which I hold and practice; and after you had passed your sentence upon me
for it, were pleased to express, I could not maintain the same against your
ministers, and thereupon publicly proffered me a dispute with them: Be pleased
by these few lines to understand, I readily accept it, and therefore desire you
would appoint the time when, and the person with whom, in that public place
where I was condemned, I might with freedom, and without molestation of the
civil power, dispute that point publicly, where I doubt not by the strength of
Christ to make it good out of his last will and testament, unto which nothing
is to be added, nor from which nothing is to be diminished. Thus desiring the
Father of lights to shine forth, and by his power to expel the darkness, I
remain your well-wisher, From the prison, this 1, 6, 52. JOHN CLARKE.

"THIS motion, if granted, I desire might be subscribed by their Secretary's
hand, as an act of the same Court by which we were condemned Cl^^ke Narrative,
p. 7.
."

THIS was presented, and after much ado, one of the magistrates informed Mr.
Clarke, that a disputation was granted to be the next week, but on Monday their
ministers came together and made no small stir about the matter, and near the
close of the day the magistrates sent for Mr. Clarke into their chamber, and
queried with him about this matter, and demanded of him whether he would
dispute upon the things contained in his sentence, and maintain his practice,
for said they, "the Court sentenced you not for your judgment and conscience,
but for matter of fact and practice. To which, says Mr. Clarke, I replied, "you
say the Court condemned me for matter of fact and practice; be it so; I say
that matter of fact and practice was but the manifestation of my judgment and
conscience; and I make account, that man is void of judgment and conscience,
with respect unto God, that has not a fact and practice suitable thereunto. --
If the faith and order which I profess do stand by the word of God, then the
faith and order which you profess must needs fail to the ground; and if the way
you walk in remain, then the way that I walk in must vanish away; they cannot
both stand together; to which they seemed to assent; therefore I told them,
that if they please to grant the motion under the Secretary's hand, I would
draw up the faith and order which I hold, as the sum of that I did deliver in
open Court, in three or four conclusions, which conclusions I will stand by and
defend, until he whom you shall appoint shall by the word of God remove me from
them; in case he shall remove me from them, then the disputation is at an end:
But if not, then I desire like liberty by the word of God to oppose the faith
and order which he and you profess, thereby to try whether I may be an
instrument in the hand of God to remove you from the same. They told me the
motion was very fair, and the way like unto a disputant, saying, because the
matter is weighty, and we desire that what can, may be spoken, when the
disputation shall be, therefore would we take a longer time -- So I returned
with my keeper to prison again, drew up the conclusions, which I was resolved
through the strength of Christ to stand in defense of, and through the
importunity of one of the magistrates, the next morning very early I showed
them to him, having a promise I should have my motion for a dispute granted,
under the Secretary's hand. The conclusions were as follows.

"THE testimony of John Clarke, a prisoner of Jesus Christ at Boston, in behalf
of my Lord, and of his people, is as follows.

"1. I TESTIFY that Jesus of Nazareth, whom God has raised from the dead, is
made both Lord and Christ; this Jesus I say is the Christ, in English, the
anointed one, has a name above every name; he is the anointed priest, none to
or with him in point of atonement; the anointed prophet, none to him in point
of instruction; the anointed King, who is gone unto his Father for his glorious
kingdom, and shall ere long return again; and that this Jesus Christ is also
the Lord; none to or with him by way of commanding and ordering, with respect
to the worship of God, the household of faith, which being purchased with his
blood as priest, instructed and nourished by his spirit as prophet, do wait in
HIS appointments as THE LORD, in hope of that glorious kingdom which shall ere
long appear To confirm this article Mr. Clarke says, "if the nature of the
commanding and ordering power, that suits both with the worship and with the
worshippers, which the Father of spirits seeks for, be considered, which is not
a law of a carnal commandment, seconded with carnal weapons, or an arm of
flesh; but a spiritual law, as the apostle calls it, Romans viii. a law of the
spirit of life from Christ Jesus, spoken unto, or rather written in the heart
of a Christian by the spirit of Christ, by reason whereof he obeys from the
heart readily, willingly and cheerfully, that form of doctrine which is
engraven and laid up therein, Heb. viii. 10. 2 Cor. iii. 3. Romans vi. 17. If
this I say be considered, that the worship is spiritual, such as must begin in,
spring up and rise from, the heart and spirit, and so be directed to the Father
of spirits, and so the commanding power that suits herewith must speak to the
heart and spirit of the man, then is there no Lord in this matter to Christ
Jesus, who speaks to the heart and spirit, and his words are as commands from
the head to the members, which convey spirit and life to obey them, by reason
of which his commands are not grievous, for where the spirit of the Lord is
there is liberty, etc. -- 2 Cor. iii. 17, 18." p. 48, 49.
.

2. "I TESTIFY that baptism, or dipping in water, is one of the commandments of
this Lord Jesus Christ, and that a visible believer or disciple of Christ Jesus
(that is one that manifests repentance toward God, and faith in Jesus
Christ) is the only person that is to be baptized, or dipped with that visible
baptism, or dipping of Jesus Christ in water, and also that visible person that
is to walk in that visible order of his house, and so to wait for his coming
the second time, in the form of a Lord and King, with his glorious kingdom
according to promise, and for his sending down in the time of his absence the
Holy Ghost, or holy Spirit of promise, and all this according to the last will
and testament of that living Lord, whose will is not to be added to or taken
from To confirm the first part of this article Mr. Clarke says, "although there
be frequent mention made of that appointment of Christ in his last will and
testament, yet it is never expressed by the word that may be rendered rantism,
or sprinkling, but by the word that is rendered baptism, or dipping. To which
he adds many proofs, p. 50 -- 52. The other part, which concerns the subjects
of baptism, he confirms by the apostles commission, and by their practice, and
notes in particular, that on the day of Pentecost they baptized none but such
as were called, gladly received his word, were added and continued in the
apostles doctrine and fellowship, etc. p. 54.
.

3. "I TESTIFY or witness, that every such believer in Christ Jesus, that
waits for his appearing, may in point of liberty, yea ought in point of duty,
to improve that talent his Lord has given unto him, and in the congregation
may either ask for information to himself; or if he can, may speak by way of
prophesy for the edification, exhortation and comfort of the whole; and out of
the congregation at all times, upon all occasions, and in all places, as far as
the jurisdiction of his Lord extends, may, yea ought to walk as a child of
light, justifying wisdom with his ways, and reproving folly, whith the
unfruitful works thereof, provided all this be shown out of a good
conversation, as James speaks with meekness of wisdom.

4. "I TESTIFY that no such believer or servant of Christ Jesus has liberty,
much less authority, from his Lord, to smite his fellow servant, nor yet with
outward force, or arm of sl^sh, to constrain, or restrain his conscience, no
nor yet his outward man for conscience sake, or worship of his God, where
injury is not offered to the person, name or estate of others, every man being
such as shall appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and must give an

mind for what he undertakes, because he that doubts is damned if he eat, and
so also if he act, because he does not eat or act in faith, and what is not of
faith is sin Narrative, p. 9, 10.
.

WHEN Mr. Clarke had thus freely given them his testimony, instead of openly
and fairly meeting him as they had talked of, to vindicate their proceedings,
the next news that he hears from them is this:

To the Keeper of the Prison.

"BY virtue hereof you are to release and set at liberty the body of Mr. John
Clarke, and this shall be your discharge for so doing. Given under my hand the
11th of the 6th month, 1651.

WILLIAM HIBBINS Narrative. p. 10, Four year^ after Hibbins's wife was hanged
for a witch.
.

GREAT expectations had been raised in the country of hearing these points
disputed, and Mr. Clarke knowing well how they would try to turn all the blame
upon him, immediately drew up the following address.

"WHEREAS through the indulgency of tender hearted friends, without my consent,
and contrary to my judgment, the sentence and condemnation of the Court at
Boston (as is reported) have been fully satisfied on my behalf, and thereupon a
warrant has been procured, by which I am secluded the place of my
imprisonment, by reason whereof I see no other call for present but to my
habitation, and to those near relations which God has given me there; yet lest
the cause should hereby suffer, which I profess is Christ's, I would hereby
signify, that if yet it shall please the honored magistrates, or General Court
of this colony, to grant my former request under their Secretary's hand, I
shall cheerfully embrace it, and upon your motion shall, through the help of
God, come from the island to attend it, and hereunto I have subscribed my name,
11th 6, 51. JOHN CLARKE."

THIS was the next morning sent to the magistrates, who were met at the
commencement at Cambridge, upon which it was noised abroad that the motion was
granted, and that Mr. Cotton was to be the man, and says Mr. Clarke, best of
all approved "of by myself for that same purpose, he being the inventor and
supporter of that way in these parts wherein they walk. But a little before
their lecture the next Thursday he received the following paper:

Mr. John Clarke,
"WE conceive you have misrepresented the Governor's speech, in saying you were
challenged to dispute with some of our elders, whereas it was plainly
expressed, that if you would confer with any of them, they were able to satisfy
you, neither were you able to maintain your practice to them by the word of
God, all which we intended for your information and conviction privately;
neither were you enjoined to what you were then counseled unto; nevertheless
if you are forward to dispute, and that you will move it yourself to the Court,
or magistrates about Boston, we shall take order to appoint one who will be
ready to answer your motion, you keeping close to the questions to be
propounded by yourself, and a moderator shall be appointed also to attend upon
that service; and whereas you desire you might be free in your dispute, keeping
close to the points to be disputed on, without incurring damage by the civil
justice, observing what has been before written, it is granted; the day may be
agreed, if you yield the premises.

JOHN ENDICOTT, Governor, THOMAS DUDLEY, Dep. Governor, RICHARD BELLINGHAM,

"MY answer follows superscribed. To the honored Governor of the
Massachusetts, and the rest of that honorable Society, these present.

Worthy Senators,
"I RECEIVED a writing, subscribed with five of your hands, by way of answer to
a twice repeated motion of mine before you, which was grounded as I conceive
sufficiently upon the Governor's words in open Court, which writing of yours
does no way answer my expectation, nor yet that motion which I made; and
whereas (waving that grounded motion) you are pleased to intimate, that if I
were forward to dispute, and would move it myself to the Court, or magistrates
about Boston, you would appoint one to answer my motion, etc. be pleased to
understand, that although I am not backward to maintain the faith and order of
my Lord, the King of saints, for which I have been sentenced, yet am I not in
such a way so forward to dispute, or move therein, lest inconvenience should
thereby arise; I shall rather once more repeat my former motion, which if it
shall please the honored General Court to accept, and under their secretary's
hand shall grant a free dispute, without molestation or interruption, I shall
be well satisfied therewith; that what is past I shall forget, and upon your
motion shall attend it; thus desiring the father of mercies not to lay that
evil to your charge, I remain your well wisher,

From Prison this 14, 6, 51.

I HAVE transcribed the whole of these letters with great care, to give the
reader a fair opportunity to judge for himself, whether those rulers and
ministers were not afraid of the light, though they pretended the contrary; for
they knew that they had then laws in force to punish any man who should dispute
against infant baptism, as well as other of their ways, and what they now sent
was no act of Court, but only a writing from some of their rulers met at
commencement; and Mr. Clarke says, it was in Mr. Cotton's hand writing, by
which they would fain have stopped Mr. Clarke's mouth, or else have drawn him
again under the lash of their laws. This he says gave ground for others to
conclude, that "the utmost they can say for themselves, and to stop the mouth
of him that is contrary minded, lies in the sword and power of the magistrate,
which, although it be a good ordinance of God in this present evil world to
restrain the oppressor, and to let the oppressed go free, and so approved and
owned by Christ and all true Christians, in case of wrong and wicked lewdness
-- yet was it never appointed by Christ (to whom all power, not only in earth,
but also in heaven, is committed, and by whom all earthly powers are to be
judged; I say it was never appointed by Christ) to inform and rectify the minds
and consciences of men in the worship of God, in that great mystery of
godliness, and in those mystical matters concerning the kingdom of Christ, that
being a matter that only belongs to the holy spirit of promise, and to the
sword of that spirit, which is the word (not of man, but) of God, to effect,
much less to conform their outward man contrary to their minds and consciences
in the worship of God; and therefore that sword and power ought to take heed
how they meddle herein, lest they attempt to take the place and enter upon the
THRONE and KINGDOM OF CHRIST Narrative, p. 13, 14.


MR. Crandal, who was fined five pounds, only for being with the others, was
released upon promise of appearing at their next Court (though they did not let
him know when it was, till it was over, and they exacted the fine of the
keeper) and he with Mr. Clarke returned home. Mr. Holmes was kept in prison
till their Court met in the beginning of September, and then, after their
public lecture in Boston, the sentence of Court was executed upon him; a
particular account of which we have written with his own hand, as follows:

"UNTO the well beloved brethren, John Spilsbury, William Kiffen, and the rest
that in London stand fast in the faith, and continue to walk steadfastly in that
order of the gospel which was once delivered unto the saints by Jesus Christ:
Obadiah Holmes, an unworthy witness that Jesus is the Lord, and of late a
prisoner for Jesus sake at Boston, sends greeting.

Dearly Beloved and longed after,
"MY heart's desire is to hear from you, and to hear that you grow in grace,
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and that your love
to him, and one unto another, as he has given commandment, abounds, would be
the very joy and great rejoicing of my soul and spirit. Had I not been
prevented by my beloved brethren of Providence, who have wrote unto you,
wherein you have my mind at large; and also by our beloved brother Clarke, of
Rhode Island, who may, if God permit, see you, and speak with you mouth to
mouth, I had here declared myself in that matter, but now I forbear; and
because I have an experimental knowledge in myself, that in members of the same
body, while it stands in union with the head, there is a sympathizing spirit,
which passes through, and also remains in each particular, so that one
member can neither mourn nor rejoice, but all the members are ready to mourn
and rejoice with it; I shall the rather impart unto you some dealings which I
have had therein from the sons of men, and the gracious supports which I have
had from the Son of God, my Lord and yours, that so like members you might
rejoice with me, and might be encouraged, by the same experiment of his tender
mercies, to fear none of those things which you shall suffer for Jesus sake. It
pleased the Father of lights, after a long continuance of mine in death and
darkness, to cause life and immortality to be brought to light in my soul, and
also to cause me to see that this life was by the death of his Son, in that
hour and power of darkness procured, which wrought in my heart a restless
desire to know what the Lord, who had so dearly bought me, would have me to do,
and finding that it was his last will (to which none is to add, and from which
none is to detract) that they which had faith in his death for life, should
yield up themselves to hold forth a lively consimilitude or likeness unto his
death, burial and resurrection, by that ordinance of baptism, I readily yielded
thereto, being by love constrained to follow the Lamb (that takes away the sins
of the world) whithersoever he goes. I had no sooner separated from their
assemblies, and from communion with them in their worship of God, and thus
visibly put on Christ, being resolved alone to attend upon him, and to submit
to his will, but immediately the adversary cast out a flood against us, and
stirred up the spirits of men to present myself and two more to Plymouth Court,
where we met with four petitions against our whole company to take some speedy
course to suppress us; one from our own plantation, with 35 hands to it; one
from the church, as they call it, at Taunton; one from all the ministers in our
colony, except two, if I mistake not, and one from the Court at Boston, in the
Massachusetts, under their Secretary's hand; whereupon the Court straightly
charge us to desist, and neither to ordain officers, nor to baptize, nor to
break bread together, nor yet to meet upon the first day of the week; and
having received these strait charges, one of the three discovers the sand^
foundation upon which he stood, who, when the flood came and the wind blew,
fell, yet it pleased the Father of mercies (to whom be the praise) to give us
strength to stand, and to tell them it was better to obey God than man; and
such was the grace of our God to usward, that though we were had from Court to
Court, yet were we firmly resolved to keep close to the rule, and to obey the
voice of our Lord, come what will come.

"NOT long after these troubles I came upon occasion of business into the
colony of the Massachusetts, with two other brethren, as brother Clarke being
one of the two can inform you, where we three were apprehended, carried to
Boston, and so to the Court, and were all sentenced; what they laid to my
charge, you may here read in my sentence The sentence of Obadiah Holmes, of
Scaconk, the 31st of the 5th m. 1651.

"Forasmuch as you Obadiah Holmes, being come into this jurisdiction about the
21 of the 5 m. did meet at one William Witter's house, at Lynn, and did here
privately (and at other times, being an excommunicate person, did take upon you
to preach and baptize) upon the Lord's day, or other days, and being taken then
by the constable, and coming afterward to the assembly at Lynn, did, in
disrespect to the ordinance of God and his worship, keep on your hat, the
pastor being in prayer, insomuch that you would not give reverence in vailing
your hat, till it was forced off your head, to the disturbance of the
congregation, and professing against the institution of the church, as not
being according to the gospel of Jesus Christ; and that you the said Obadiah
Holmes did upon the day following meet again at the said William Witter's, in
contempt to authority, you being then in the custody of the law, and did there
receive the sacrament, being excommunicate, and that you did baptize such as
were baptized before, and thereby did necessarily deny the baptism that was
before administered to be baptism, the churches no churches, and also other
ordinances, and ministers, as if all were a nullity; and also did deny the
lawfulness of baptizing of infants; and all this tends to the dishonor of God,
the despising the ordinances of God among us, the peace of the churches, and
seducing the subjects of this commonwealth from the truth of the gospel of
Jesus Christ, and perverting the strait ways of the Lord, the Court does fine
you 30 pounds, to be paid, or sufficient sureties that the said sum shall be
paid by the first day of the next Court of Assistants, or else to be well
whipped, and that you shall remain in prison till it be paid, or security given
in for it. By the Court, INCREASE NOWELL."


, upon the pronouncing of which, as I went from the bar, I expressed myself in
these words: I bless God, I am counted worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus,
Whereupon John Wilson (their pastor, as they call him) struck me before the
judgment seat, and cursed me, saying, the curse of God or Jesus go with thee
"Mr. Wilson is represented by his cotemporaries as one of the most humble,
pious and benevolent men of the age. Massachusetts History, vol. 1, p. 258. But
when that darling point, infant sprinkling, was in danger, see how it makes the
most benevolent act like cruel persecutors!
; so we were carried to the prison, where not long after I was deprived of my
two loving friends, at whose departure the adversary stepped in, took hold of my
spirit, and troubled me for the space of an hour, and then the Lord came in,
and sweetly relieved me, causing to look to himself, so was I stayed, and
refreshed in the thoughts of my God; and although during the time of my
imprisonment the tempter was busy, yet it pleased God so to stand at my right
hand, that the motions were but sudden, and so vanished away; and although
there were that would have paid the money if I would accept it, yet I durst not
accept of deliverance in such a way, and therefore my answer to them was, that
although I would acknowledge their love to a cup of cold water, yet could I not
thank them for their money, if they should pay it. So the Court drew near, and
the night before I should suffer according to my sentence, it pleased God I
rested and slept quietly; in the morning my friends come to visit me, desiring
me to take the refreshment of wine, and other comforts; but my resolution was
not to drink wine, nor strong drink that day until my punishment was over: and
the reason was, lest in case I had more strength, courage and boldness than
ordinarily could be expected, the world should either say he is drunk with new
wine, or else that the comfort and strength of the creature has carried him
through; but my course was this: I desired brother John Hazel to bear my
friend' company, and I betook myself to my chamber, where I might communicate
with my God, commit myself to him, and beg strength from him. I had no sooner
sequestered myself, and come into my chamber, but Satan lets fly at me, saying,
Remember thy self, thy birth breeding, and friends, thy wife, children, name
and credit: but as this was sudden, so there came in sweetly from the Lord as
sudden an answer, It Is for my Lord, I must not deny him before the sons of men
(for that were to set men above him) but rather loose all, yea wife, children,
and mine own life also. To this the tempter replies, Oh but that is the
question, is it for him? and for hi^ alone? is it not rather for thy own, or
some other's sake? thou have so professed and prarised, and now art loath to
deny it; is not pride and self in the bottom? Surely this temptation was
strong, and thereupon I made dilligent search after the matter, as formerly I
had done, and after a while there was even as it had been a voice from heaven
in my very soul, bearing witness with my conscience, that it was not for any
man's case or sake in this world, that so I had professed and practiced, but
for my Lord's case and sake, and for him alone; whereupon my spirit was much
refresht; as also in the consideration of these three scriptures, which speak
on this wife, Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? Although I
walk through the valley and shadow of death I will fear no evil, thy rod and
thy staff they shall comfort me. And he that continues to the end, the same
shall be saved.

But then came in the consideration of the weakness of the flesh to bear the
strokes of a whip, though the spirit was willing, and thereupon I was caused to
pray earnestly unto the Lord, that he would be pleased to give me a spirit of
courage and boldness, a tongue to speak for him, and strength of body to suffer
for his sake, and not to shrink or yield to the strokes, or shed tears, lest
the adversaries of the truth should thereupon blaspheme and be hardened, and
the weak and feeble-hearted discouraged, and for this I sought the Lord
earnestly; at length he satisfied my spirit to give up, as my soul so my body
to him, and quietly to leave the whole disposing of the matter to him; and so I
addressed myself in as comely a manner as I could, having such a Lord and
Master to serve in this business. And when I heard the voice of my keeper come
for me, even cheerfulness did come upon me, and taking my testament in my hand,
I went a long with him to the place of execution, and after common salutation
here stood. There stood by also one of the magistrates, by name Increase Nowel,
who for a while kept silent, and spoke not a word, and so did I, expecting the
governor's presence, but he came not. But after a while Mr. Nowel bade the
executioner do his office; then I desired to speak a few words, but Mr. Nowel
answered, it is not now a time to speak. Whereupon I took leave, and said, men,
brethren, fathers and countrymen, I beseech you give me leave to speak a few
words, and the rather because here are many spectators to see me punished, and
I am to seal with my blood, if God give strength, that which I hold and
practice in reference to the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus: that
which I have to say in brief is this, Although I confess I am no disputant, yet
seeing I am to seal what I hold with my blood, I am ready to defend it by the
word, and to dispute that point with any that shall come forth to withstand it.
Mr. Nowel answered me, now was no time to dispute. Then said I, then I desire
to give an account of the faith and order I hold, and this I desired three
times, but in comes Mr. Flint, and says to the executioner, Fellow, do thine
office, for this fellow would but make a long speech to delude the people.
Thomas Flint was chosen one of their magistrates in 164^.
So I being resolved to speak, told the people; that which I am to suffer for
is the word of God, and testimony of Jesus Christ. No, says Mr. Nowel, it is
for you error, and going about to seduce the people. To which I replied, not
for error, for in all the time of my imprisonment, wherein I was left alone (my
brethren being gone) which of all your ministers in all that time came to
convince me of an error; and when upon the governor's words a motion was made
for a public dispute, and upon fair terms so often renewed, and desired by
hundreds, what was the reason it was not granted? Mr. Nowel told me, it was his
fault that went away, and would not dispute; but this the writings will clear
at large. Still Mr. Flint calls to the man to do his office: so before, and in
the time of his pulling off my clothes I continued speaking, telling them, that
I had so learned, that for all Boston I would not give my body into their hands
thus to be bruised upon another account, yet upon this I would not give the
hundredth part of a A wampum peaque, is the sixth part of a penny with us.
wampum peaque to free it out of their hands, and that I made as much
conscience of unbuttoning one button, as I did of paying the L. 30 in reference
thereunto. I told them moreover, the Lord having manifested his love toward
me, in giving me repentance toward God and faith in Jesus Christ, and so to be
baptized in water by a messenger of Jesus into the name of the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, wherein I have fellowship with him in his death, burial and
resurrection, I am now come to be baptized in afflictions by your hands, that
so I may have further fellowship with my Lord, and am not ashamed of his
sufferings, for by his stripes am I healed.

"AND as the man began to lay the strokes upon my back, I said to the people,
though my flesh should fail, and my spirit should fail, yet my God would not
fail. So it pleased the Lord to come in, and so to fill my heart and tongue as
a vessel full and with an audible voice I broke forth, praying unto the Lord
not to lay this sin to their charge; and telling the people, that now I found
he did not fail me, and therefore now I should trust him forever who failed me
not; for in truth, as the strokes fell upon me, I had such a spiritual
manifestation of God's presence as the like thereof I never had nor felt, nor
can with fleshly tongue express; and the outward pain was so removed from me,
that indeed I am not able to declare it to you, it was so easy to me, that I
could well bear it, yea and in a manner felt it not although it was grievous,
as the spectators said, the man ^riking with all his strength (yea spitting in
his hand three times, as many affirmed) with a three-corded whip, giving me
therewith thirty strokes. When he had loosed me from the post, having
joyfulness in my heart and cheerfulness in my countenance, as the spectators
observed, I ^old the magistrates, you have struck me as with roses; and said
moreover, although the Lord has made it easy to me, yet I pray God it may not
be laid to your charge.

"AFTER this many came to me rejoicing to see the power of the Lord manifested
in weak flesh; but sinful flesh takes occasion hereby to bring others in
trouble, informs the magistrates hereof, and so two more are apprehended as for
contempt of authority; their names were John Hazel and John Spur, who came
indeed and ^id shake me by the hand, but did use no words of contempt or
reproach unto any; no man can prove that the first spoke any thing, and for the
second, he only said thus, blessed be the Lord; yet these two for taking me by
the hand, and thus saying after I had received my punishment, were sentenced to
pay 40 shillings, or to be whipped. Both were resolved against paying their fine;
nevertheless after one or two days imprisonment, one paid John Spur's fine, and
he was released; and after six or seven days imprisonment of brother Hazel,
even the day when he should have suffered, another paid his, and so he escaped,
and the next day went to visit a friend about six miles from Boston, where the
same day he fell sick, and within ten days ended his life. When I was come to
the prison, it pleased God to stir up the heart of an old acquaintance of mine,
who with much tenderness, like the good Samaritan, poured oil into my wounds,
and plaistered my sores; In a manuscript of governor Joseph Jencks's, wrote
near 50 years ago, he says, "Mr. Holmes was whipped thirty stripea, and in such
an unmerciful manner, that in many days, if not some weeks, he could take no
rest but as he lay upon his knees and elbows, not being able to suffer any part
of his body to touch the bed whereon he lay. But Mr. Clarke being a scholar
bred, a friend of his, paid his fine."
but there was present information given what was done, and inquiry made who
was the surgeon, and it was commonly reported he should be sent for, but what
was done I yet know not. Now thus it has pleased the Father of mercies so to
dispose of the matter, that my bonds and imprisonments, have been no hindrance
to the Gospel, for before my return, some submitted to the Lord, and were
baptized, and diverse were put upon the way of inquiry. And now being advised to
make my escape by night, because it was reported that there were warrants forth
for me, I departed; and the next day after, while I was on my journey, the
constable came to search at the house where I lodged, so I escaped their hands,
and was by the good hand of my heavenly Father brought home again to my near
relation, my wife and eight children. The brethren of our town, and Providence
having taken pains to meet me four miles in the woods where we rejoiced
together in the Lord. Thus have I given you as briefly as I can, a true
relation of things; wherefore my brethren rejoice with me in the Lord, and give
glory to him, for he is worthy, to whom be praise forevermore; to whom I commit
you, and put up my earnest prayers for you, that by my late experience who have
trusted in God, and have not been deceived, you may trust in him perfectly.
Wherefore my dearly beloved brethren, trust in the Lord, and you shall not be
ashamed nor confounded; so I also rest, Yours in the bond of charity,

OBADIAH HOLMES."* Clarke's narrative, p. 16 -- 23.



THUS I have given the reader his own testimony without adding or diminishing a
single word, that all who understand my judge; for the scriptures assure us,
that the ear tries words, as the mouth tastes meat. You have heard from Mr.
Holmes, that two men were put to trouble for the respect they showed to him
after his sufferings. Mr. Clarke says, it was reported that warrants were sent
forth to the number of 13, but that some through fear were fain to hide
"themselves, and being strangers, to hasten away, or to change their habit.
John Spur, one of their church members, and who was taken, gives us the
following testimony. Says he,

"Mr. Cotton in his sermon immediately before the Court gave their sentence
against Mr. Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandal, affirmed, that denying
infant baptism would overthrow all, and this was a capital offense; and
therefore they were soul-murtherers. When therefore the governor, Mr. John
Endicot, came into the Court to pass sentence against them, he said thus, you
deserve to die, but this we agreed upon, that Mr. Clarke shall pay L. 20 fine,
and Obadiah Holmes L. 30 fine, and John Crandal L. 5 and to remain in prison
until their fines be either paid or security given for them, or else they are
all of them to be well whipped. When Obadiah Holmes was brought forth to
receive his sentence, he desired of the magistrates, that he might hold forth
the ground of his practice; but they refused to let him speak, and commanded
the whipper to do his office; then the whipper began to pull off his clothes,
upon which Obadiah Holmes said, Lord lay not this sin unto their charge; and so
the whipper began to lay on with his whip; upon which Obadiah Holmes said, O
Lord, I beseech thee to manifest thy power in the weakness of thy creature. He
neither moving nor stirring at all for their strokes, brakes out in these
expressions, blessed and praised be the Lord, and thus he carried it to the
end, and went away rejoicingly; I John Spur being present, it did take such an
impression in my spirit to trust in God, and to walk according to the light
that God had communicated to me, and not to fear what man could do unto me,
that I went to the man (being inwardly affected with what I saw and heard) and
with a joyful countenance took him by the hand when he was from the post and
said praised be the Lord; and so I went along with him to the prison; and
presently that day there was information given to the Court what I had said and
done; and also a warrant To the keeper or his deputy.

By virtue hereof you are to take into your custody, and safe keeping the body
of John Spur for a heinous offense by him committed, hereof fail not. Dated the
5th of the 7th month, 1651. Take also into your safe keeping John Hazel.

By the Court. INCREASE NOWEL.


granted out that day to arrest both myself and John Haze^, which was executed
on the morrow morning upon us, and so we were brought to the Court and
examined. The governor asked me concerning Obadiah Holmes, according as he was
informed by old Mr. Cole, and Thomas Buttolph, of my taking of him by the hand,
and smiling, and I did then freely declare what I did, and what I said, which
was this: Obadiah Holmes, said I, I do look upon as a godly man; and do affirm
that he carried himself as did become a Christian, under so sad an affliction;
and his affliction did so affect my soul, that I went to him being from the
post, and said, blessed be the Lord. -- But said the governor, what do you
apprehend concerning the cause for which he suffered? my answer was, that I am
not able to judge of it; then said the governor, we will deal with you as we
have dealt with him. I said unto him again, I am in the hands of God. Then Mr.
Symonds a magistrate said, you shall know that you are in the hands of men. The
governor then said, keeper, take him, and so I was presently carried away to
prison.

"THE next day about one of the clock I was sent for again into the Court; the
governor (being then about to go out of the Court when I came in) delivered his
speech to me; said he, you must pay 40 shillings or be whipped. I said then to
those of the Court that remained, that if any man suffer as a Christian, let
him glorify God in this behalf. Then I desired to know what law I had broken,
and what evil I had done? but they produced no law, only they produced what the
two witnesses had sworn against me. J -- Cole being in the market place, when
Obadiah Holmes came from the whipping-post, John Spur came and met him
presently, laughing in his face, saying, Blessed be God for thee brother, and
so did go with him, laughing upon him up toward the prison, which was very
grievous to me to see him harden the man in his sin, and showing much contempt
of authority by that carriage, as if he had been unjustly punished, and had
suffered as a righteous man under a tyrannical government. Deposed before the
Court, the 5th of the 7th month.

INCREASE NOWEL.

I, Thomas Buttolph, did see John Spur come to Obadiah Holmes, so soon as he
came from the whipping-post, laughing in his face, and going along with him
toward the prison to my great grief to see him harden him in his sin, and to
show such contempt of authority. Deposed the 5th of the 7th month, 1631, before
the Court.

INCREASE NOWEL.


My speech thereto was this; My practice and carriage is allowed by the word of
God, for it is written in Romans 12. Be like affectioned one toward another,
rejoice with them that rejoice; and it is contrary to my judgment and
conscience to pay a penny. Then said Mr. Bendal, I will pay it for him, and
there presented himself. I answered then and said, I thanked him for his love,
but did believe it was no acceptable service for any man to pay a penny for me
in this case; yet notwithstanding the Court accepted of his profer, and bid me
be gone, then came John Hazel to be examined. JOHN SPUR." Narrative p. 26 -- 28.

I find that John Hazel was admitted a freeman at Boston, March 9, 1637, and
John Spur, May 22, 1639. Mass^^reco^o^




MR. Hazel was one of Mr. Holmes brethren of Rehoboth, who, though above
threescore years old, and infirm in body had trevelled near fifty miles, partly
indeed on other business, but chiefly to visit his beloved brother in prison;
and how he was treated there he has given us an account, written and subscribed
with his own hand as follows.

"A relation of my being brought before the magistrates the 6th of the 7th
month, 1651.

I going from place to place, to buy and take up commodities for my use, was
attached or arrested by the marshal, by virtue of a warrant from the Court, to
appear in the Court, and there to answer for a high misdemeanor committed by
me, and coming into the Court (which was then privately kept in the chamber)
they asked me d^vers questions, among which this was one, Whether I did think
that Obadiah Holmes did well or not, in coming among them to baptize, and
administer the sacrament? laying this to my charge, that I was one with him,
and of the same judgment, and, Whether I did think he did well or no, in his so
carrying himself? To which I answered, I had here nothing to do with that which
another man did, but I was here to answer for what I myself had committed
against their law. Then said they, you have offended our law, and have
contemned authority, for you took him by the hand, and did countenance him in
his sin, so soon as he was gone from the post. To which I said, If I have
broken any law of the place, by what I then did, I am willing to submit unto
punishment. Yea, said the governor, you took him by the hand, did you not? and
spoke to him, what said you? did you not say so and so? blessed be God, etc. To
which I said, I shall refer myself unto the testimonies that may or can be
brought against me. Well, said the governor, we shall find testimony enough
against you; take him to you, keeper, and we will call you sorth in public,
for what we do with you we will proceed in public with you, and so I went to
prison. This was the sum and substance of the first time I was called before
them. The next day being the last day of the week, and the last day of their
Court, I was in expectation all the forenoon to be called forth, but was not;
so after dinner, when (as appears) the Court was risen, and some of the
magistrates departed, I was sent for again into the chamber, where was the
governor with three others, setl. Mr. Beilingham, Mr. Hibbens, and Mr. Increase
Nowel. As soon as I was come into the room, the governor read my sentence,
which was, that I must pay 40 s or be well whipped, and so immediately he
departed, and when he was gone (for I could not have time before) I answered,
that I desired the privilege of an English subject, which was to be tried by
the country, to wit, a jury, and to be made to appear (if they can) to be a
transgressor by a law. To which they said, I had contemned authority, and they
had a law to punish such, and said they, you did show your contempt of
authority in that you did take such a person by the hand, as soon as he was
from the post. To which I answered, I could not do that which I did in contempt
to authority, seeing he has satisfied the law to the full, and was departed
from the place suffering; and in the next place, what I did, I did unto him as
my friend; and further I said, if I had taken him by the hand so soon as he was
loosed from the post, and had led him out of the town, I should not have broken
any law eiher of God or man. To this they said, that there was a law in all
Courts of justice, both in Old-England and other countries, to punish contempt
of authority, and so had they such a law among themselves. To which I said,
that in Old-England, and in other places, they had such a law I denied not, but
that law also was both enacted and published, but what law have I broken in
taking my friend by the hand, when he was free, and satisfied the law? To this
they replied, that he had not satisfied the keeper. To this I answered, that he
had talked with the keeper, and there was some agreement between them, and so
in that sense also not under the law, but free. Then said they, If you would
have showed kindness unto your friend, you might have forborne in that place,
and done it more privately. To which I answered, I knew not but that place was
as free as another, he having satisfied the law. The testimony that was given
by Mr. Cole was this, "I saw John Hazel take Obadiah Holmes by the hand, but
what he said I cannot tell." This is the substance of all the proceedings until
the last day at night, and then they said I should be whipped, but said some of
their officers, the whipper cannot be found. Then they commanded that they
should be ready by the second day morning, and then I did expect to be called
forth: but neither that day, nor the third, nor fourth, was I called, but am as
I understand reserved unto the fifth day, to be more public in the view of the
world; and when the fifth day came, as I had many before, so also then, that
would have paid the fine, If I would give my consent, which I denied to do, and
so see myself by the power of Christ to suffer what should be inflicted upon
me; but when noon came I was told I should not suffer whipping, yet not having
a discharge, I did not look to be freed until the keeper told me, I might go
about my business. Then I demanded a discharge (meaning under the magistrates
hands) so he had me go, he would discharge me.

"The strokes I was enjoined by the Court to have, were ten with a three-corded
whip; the very same number I understand, that the worst malefactors that were
there punished had, of which some were guilty of common whoredom, other of
forcing a little child, and one Indian for coining of money. Thus far have you
a relation according to my best remembrance from the first to the last of all
the passages concerning this matter; by me John Hazel, written with mine own
hand in Boston prison, the 13th day of the 7th month, 1651.

" A postscrip. SINCE I wrote, I understand there is report that I was willing
to pay my fine, and that the magistrates would not accept of it without I were
willing. Gentle reader, be pleased to understand that this is false, for it was
without my consent or approbation; and further understand, that the fine was
taken by them, upon the profer of Mr. Bendal for John Spur, it was willingly
accepted by the magistrates. and approved of, although John Spur did to their
faces contradict it, and oppose it; therefore, good reader, believe not such
reports.

By me, JOHN HAZEL." Narrative, p. 29. -- 32. Here note, that Mr. Neal mistakes
in representing that it was the general Court that fined these men; for it was
only the Court of assistants.


THUS far we have attended to those sufferers own testimony, the last of whom
wrote the postcript of his relation on his deathbed, and how much the abusive
treatment he met with was the cause of his death, God only knows. Let us now
hear what others had to say about them. Mr. Clarke went to England in November
1651, and the next year printed the narrative from whence we have taken those
accounts; upon which Sir Richard Saltonstall, one of the Massachusetts first
magistrates, then in our mother country, wrote to Mr. Cotton and Wilson, of
Boston, in this manner.

"REVEREND and dear friends, whom I unfeignedly love and respect.

"IT does not a little grieve my spirit to hear what sad things are reported
daily of your tyranny and persecutions in New England, as that you fine, whip
and imprison men for their consciences. First, you compel such to come into
your assemblies as you know will not join you in your worship, and when they
show their dislike thereof or witness against it, then you stir up your
magistrates to punish them for such (as you conceive) their public affronts.
Truly, friends, this your practice of compelling any in matters of worship to
do that whereof they are not fully persuaded, is to make them sin, for so the
apostle (Romans 14 and 23) tells us and many are made hypocrites thereby,
conforming in their outward man for fear of punishment. We pray for you and
wish you prosperity every way, hoped the Lord would have given you so much
light and love there, that you might have been eyes to God's people here, and
not to practice those courses in a wilderness, which you went so far to
prevent. These rigged ways have laid you very low in the hearts of the saints.
I do assure you I have heard them pray in the public assemblies that the Lord
would give you meek and humble spirits, not to strive so much for uniformity as
to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace." Mass. history vol. III.
p. 401, 402.


Mr. Cotton's answer.

"Honored and dear Sir,

"My brother Wilson and self do both of us acknowledge your love, as otherwise
formerly, so now in the late lines we received from you, that you g^ieve in
spirit to hear daily complaints against us. -- Be pleased to understand we look
at such complaints ^is altogether injurious in respect of ourselves, who ^^d no
hand or tongue at all to promote either the coming of the persons you aim at
into our assemblies, or their punishment for their carriage there. Righteous
judgment will not take up reports, much less reproaches against the innocent.
The cry of the sinners of Sodom was great and loud, and reached up to heaven;
yet the righteous God (giving us an example what to do in the like case) he
would first go down to see whether their crime were altogether according to the
cry, before he proceed to judgment. And when he did find the truth of the cry,
he did not wrap up all alike promiscuously in the judgment, but spared such as
he found innocent. Alas! how often do men act contrary to the good rules they
prescribe for others! How often was Mr. Cotton guilty of censuring others,
without a fair and full hea^^ng! he does it to Mr. Holmes before he has got to
the end of this letter. And where there are some things wrong, yet how little
care has been used by his party to distinguish the innocent fromt he guilty,
among the baptists? So far from such a care, that from his day to ours, it had
been a common trade of that party to ransack Germany, in order to reproach the
English baptists with errors and bad actions, which we never had any more
concern with, than our accusers have with the whoredom of pope Joan!
We are amongst those whom (if you knew us better) you would account, peaceable
in Israel. Yet neither are we so vast in our indulgence or toleration, as to
think the men you speak of, suffered an unjust censure. For one of them
(Obadiah Holmes) being an excommunicate person himself, out of a church in
Plymouth patent, came into this jurisdiction, and took upon him to baptize,
which I think himself will not say he was compelled here to perform. What an
evasion is this? Sir Richard spoke of compelling persons into their worship,
and Cotton here turns it as if he meant a compelling persons out of one
government into another to worship in their own way.
And he was not ignorant that the rebaptizing of an elder person, and that by a
private person out of office and under excommunication, are all of them
manifest contestations against the order and government of our churches,
established (we know) by God's law, and (he knows) by the laws of the
country. As for his whipping, it was more voluntarily chosen by him than
inflicted on him. His censure by the Court was to have paid (as I know) 30
pounds, or else be whipped; his fine was offered to be paid by friends for him
freely, but he chose rather to be whipped; in which case, if his suffering of
stripes was any worship of God at all, surely it could be accounted no better
than will worship "Although the paying of a fine seems to be but a small thing
in comparison of a man's parting with his religion, yet the paying of a fine is
the acknowledging of a transgression; and for a man to acknowledge that he has
transgressed when his conscience tells him he has not, is but little if any at
thing all short of parting with his religion; and it is likely that this might
be the consideration of those sufferers. Governor JENCKS."
The other (Mr. Clarke) was wiser in that point and his offense was less, so
was his fine less, and himself (as I hear) was contented to have it paid for
him, whereupon he was released. If the reader will look back to page 235, he
may see how contrary this is to truth
The imprisonment of either of them was no detriment. I believe they fared
neither of them better at home, and I am sure Holmes had not been so well clad
of many years before.

"BUT be pleased to consider this point a little further. You think to compel
men in matter of worship is to make them sin. If the worship be lawful in
itself, the magistrate compelling him to come to it, compels him not to sin,
but the sin is in his will that needs to be compelled to a christian duty. If
it do make men hypocrites, yet better be hypocrites than profane persons.
Hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man, but the profane person
gives God neither outward nor inward man. You know not, if you think we came
into this wilderness to practice those courses here which we fled from in
England. We believe there is a vast difference between men's inventions and
God's institutions; we fled from men's inventions, to which we else should have
been compelled; we compel none to men's inventions. It our ways (rigid ways as
you call them) have laid us low in the hearts of God's people, yea, and of the
saints (as you style them) we do not believe it is any part of their saintship.
Nevertheless, I tell you the truth, we have tolerated in our church some
anabaptists, some antinomians and some seekers, and do so still at this day. We
are far from arrogating infallibility of judgment to ourselves or affecting
uniformity; uniformity God never required, infallibility he never granted us."
Mass. hist. vol. III. p. 403 -- 406.


HERE I would remark,

1. THAT they were not infalliable, can easily be believed, by all who see what
great absurdities and self-contradictions they were driven to, in trying to
support that way. Mr. Cotton here asserts, that they were far from arrogating
infallibility to themselves, and yet in the same letter had said, our churches
are established, "WE KNOW by God's law," and that in the points Mr. Holmes
contested; and the use of force in religious matters naturally carries men into
this absurdity; for it would sound very odd in any men, to compel others to
their way by the magistrates sword, and yet own at the same time that they
(...) not know but they were compelling them into erro^^. When I first came
into the parish where I now dw^^^, as they were without a minister, their
committed (...) ^quested me to preach to them for some time, w^^^^^ I did. But
in the year following, they got a (...) vote to hire other sort of preaching,
and taxed me with our society thereto. This caused our society to present an
address to that party, dated November 21, 1748, wherein they say, "Pray
consider, would you like it if we were a few more in number than you, to be
forced to help us build a meeting house, and maintain our minister! We doubt it
much." To this the other party, by the help of a neighboring minister,
returned a long answer, the turning point of which was in these words, viz.
"What we demand of you is equal and right; what you demand of us is evil and
sinful; and hence we have the golden rule upon our side, while you are
receeding and departing from it; for if we were in an error and out of the
right way, as we see and know that you are in several respects, and you see and
knew it of us, as we do of you, we think the golden rule would oblige you to
tell us of our error, and not let us alone to go on peacibly in it, that is
without using proper means to recover and reclaim us; whether by the laws of
God, or the good and wholesome laws of the land, as we now treat you."

Now only allow it to be right to join the laws of the land with the laws of
God, in supporting what the majority calls the right way of worship, and then
how can any one fairly withstand this reasoning? for we are required not to
suffer sin upon our neighbor; and if seculiar force be a means that christians
ought to use, to bring their neighbors from error to attend and support the
truth, how can Mr. Cotton's party be condemned for seizing and punishing Mr.
Clarke and his brethren for worshipping in a private house, when they had an
orthodox meeting in the town, established by public authority? And how can the
major party in any parish be blamed for imprisoning men for their ministers
rates (as my neighbors did me) though they never heard him, or received the
least benefit from him? If any think these two are not parallel cases, I ask
what is the difference? Mr. Clarke and Holmes might have gone to the
established worship, if they would; and Mr. Holmes might have had his fine paid
it seems if he would, and so all his devotion under the whip is declared to be
"no better than will worship." According to Mr. Cotton's own words, men might
then be anabaptists, antinomians and what not, if they would but come to hear
the right minister, and join with the right churches; and is not the greatest
complaint they have at this day against the baptists, because they refuse to
commune with pedobaptist churches? They professed to grant liberty of
conscience then, as well as now. Captain Johnson who wrote in the time we are
upon, says of erroneous persons, "They report in all places where they come,
that New England government does persecute the people and churches of Christ;
which to speak truth, they have hitherto been so far from, that they have
endeavored to expel all such beasts of prey (who will not be reclaimed) that
here might be none left to hurt or destroy in all God's holy mountain. --
Neither do they exercise civil power to bring all men under their obedience, to
a uniformity in every point of religion, but to keep them in the unity of the
spirit, and the bond of peace; nor yet have they ever mixed their civil powers
with the authority peculiarly given by Christ to his churches and officers of
them, but from time to time have labored to uphold their privileges, and only
communion one with another." Johnson's history, p. 107.


It is readily granted that the sentiments of Mr. Williams and Mr. Clark, about
religous liberty, have had a great spead since that day, so that men of a
contrary mind cannot carry their oppressive schemes so far now as they did
then: yet, as to such as still hold that they have a right to use secular force
to support worship, I think the chief difference between them and their fathers
in 1651, lies in these two points: Then they gave the church the whole power of
electing and settling ministers; now the world is empowered to control the
church in her choice; then they obliged men to hear, as well as support their
good ministers; now men may hear whom they please, if they will but let the
parish minister have their money; but if that is refused, men are as liable to
imprisonment or confiscation of goods now as then; and whether the compelling
of a man to pay for that which is no benefit to him, be not an action more void
of the very appearance of justice, than the compelling of men to hear what the
compellers esteemed good preaching was, is freely refered to every reader's
conscience: as it also is, whether the real error in both cases does not lie in
blending divine and human laws together, rather than in any mistake about
applying of them then, more than now.

2. We have abundant reason to think that Mr. Clarke's narrative of their
sentiments and sufferings, is a true and just one; for he published it in 1652,
and it greatly concerned the Massachusetts colony to confute the same if they
could, and they did not want for men of ability and inclination to vindicate
themselves in that respect, if they had found matter to work upon. But Captain
Johnson who published his history of that colony in 1654, is silent about this
remarkable affair. Mr John Leverett their agent at the British Court, wrote to
governor Endicot about it; but he in a letter of June 29 1657, says, "I cannot
for the present answer your expectation touching Rhode Island, and Clarke and
Holmes." Mass. hist, vol. III, p. 300.
Mr. Morton printed his New England memorial in 1669, in which he endeavors to
vindicate the country against many other compaints, but leaves this narrative
untouched. Mr. Hubbard wrote a large history of the country in 1680, yet
touches not this affair unless in an obscure hint which confutes nothing. Dr.
Cotton Mather published his folio history of New England in 1702, but passes
over these sufferings in silence; yea, and so does governor Hutchinson, though
his history is the most impartial upon religious disputes of any that has been
written in this country, yet he says, "The first prosecution I find upon record
of any of the people called anabaptists was in the year 1665." Mass. hist. vol.
1. p. 226.
Indeed in his third volume, which is a collection of ancient papers, are a few
references to these sufferers, which I have now made use of, but instead of
confuting, they confirm Mr. Clarke's narrative. Mr. Neal who wrote in London
1720, has from that narrative given a brief account of their sufferings, and
has done them the most honor of any pedobaptist author I ever saw; though he
has made several mistakes about them. As in vol. I. p. 298 he says, "Mr. Newman
admonished Holmes of his offense; but finding him obstinate, and not willing to
give an account of his conduct to the church, he excommunicated him;" for which
he gaves no other proof than Mr. Clarke's narrative, and that informs us, p.
24, that the first occasion of Mr. Holmes's separation was, "That seven of the
brethren should pass an act of admonition upon a brother, without the consent
of the rest, we (says Mr. Holmes) being 23 in number, who might all in one
hour's space, if in health, have come together; so when I heard of it I went to
Mr. Newman, and told him of the evil which he and the other six had done; he
told me they were the church representative, and if four of them had done it,
it had been a church act. When this comes to the congregation, with much ado,
he got five more to himself, and then they were twelve and we eleven, then they
owned themselves to be the church, and began to deal with me for saying, they
had abused the church, and had took from them their power; whereupon I told
them I should renounce them, till either they saw their sin, or I further
light." After which a number more drew off and set up a meeting by themselves,
and there was public notice of the day when they were to be baptized, and many
witnesses of the transaction, yet says he, "not one man or woman of Mr.
Newman's company ever come to deal with me for evil either in judgment or
practice till a long time after." Now is it just to charge Mr. Holmes with
obstinacy, only for his refusing to submit to the other party after this? Again
Mr. Neal, p. 302 charges Mr. Clarke, with standing upon a pun^tilio against
very fair concessions of the Massachusetts rulers, only because he refused to
dispute without an exemption from the lash of their law.


3. BY all that appears, those baptist fathers were sound in the faith and much
acquainted with experimental and practical religion. All that was proved
against them may be summed up in their noble testimony, that there is, "None to
or with Christ the Lord, by way of commanding and ordering with respect to the
worship of God: that baptism or dipping in water is one of his commandments,
and that a visible believer of disciple of Christ is the only person that is to
be baptized; that every such believer, may in point of liberty, yea, ought in
point of duty to improve that talent his Lord has given him with meekness of
wisdom; and that no such believer has any liberty, much less authority from
his Lord, to smite his fellow servants, nor yet with outward force to restrain
his conscience, nor outward man for conscience sake, where injury is not
offered to the person, name or estate of others." This is the sum of all the
principles for which they suffered such cruel things, though their opposites have
constantly accused them of others. The assembly of the Massachusetts begin
their law against the baptists in 1644, with saying, "That since the first
arising of the anabaptists about 100 years since, they have been the
incendiaries of the commonwealths, and the infectors of persons in main matters
of religion, and the troublers of churches in all places where they have been;"
and great pains have been taken by teachers and writers from that day to this,
to connect these odious ideas with the very name of anabaptists. But let the
reader judge whether it be possible with ministers of any denomination, to
visit and worship with any of their brethren, more peacibly than these
ministers did to their brother at Lynn; and whether he can find one of their
martyrs who showed less of a disposition for denying the lawful authority of
magistrates, or more of a christian temper in suffering, under their unlawful
usurpations, than these baptists did. And whether they were hetrodox or not in
main matters of religion, may be partly gathered from the foregoing account,
and still further by the confession of their faith inserted below. Mr. Clarke
less a confession of his says in writing, from whence an extract was inserted
in the records of his church, the main of which here follows.

"The decree of God is that whereby God has from eternity set down with
himself whatsoever shall come to pass in time, Ephesians. i. 11. All things with
their causes, effects, circumstances and manner of being, are decreed by God,
Acts, ii. 23. Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
of God, etc. Acts, iv. 28. This decree is most wise, Romans xi. 32. Most just,
Romans ix. 13.14. Eternal, Ephesians, i. 4.5. 2 Thessalonians. ii. 13. Necessary, Psa. xxxiii.
11. Prove. xix. 21. Unchangable, Heb. vi. 17. Most free, Romans ix. 18. And the
cause of all good, Jam. i. 17. But not of any sin, 1. John, i. 5. The special
decree of God concerning angels and men is called predestination, Romans viii.
30. Of the former. viz. angels, little is spoken in the holy scripture; of the
latter more is revealed, not unprofitable to be known. It may be defined the
wise, free, just, eternal and unchangable sentence or decree of God,
determining to create and govern man for his special glory, viz. the praise of
his glorious mercy and justice, Romans ix. 17, 18, and xi. 36. Election is the
decree of God, of his free love, grace and mercy, choosing some men to faith,
holiness and eternal life, for the praise of his glorious mercy, 1 These. i. 4.
2. These. 11.13. Romans viii. 29.30. The cause which moved the Lord to elect them
who are chosen, was none other but his mere good wiil and pleasure, Luke xii,
32. The end is the manifestation of the riches of his grace and mercy, Rom ix.
23. Ephesians. i. 6. The fending of Christ, faith, holiness, and eternal life, are
the effects of his love, by which he manifests the infinite riches of his
grace. In the same order God does execute this decree in time, he did decree it
in his eternal counsel, 1 These. v. 9. 2 These. ii. 13. Sin is the effect of
man's free will, and condemnation is an effect of justice inflicted upon man
for sin and disobedience. -- A man in this life may be sure of this election, 2
Pet. i. 10. 1 These. i. 4. Yea of his eternal happiness -- but not of his
eternal reprobation; for he that is now profane, may be called hereafter." Thus
far Mr. Clarke.

Mr. Holmes says, "Having had two three requests from my friends and brethren,
in special my brother Robert, to give some information of my present state and
standing with reference to the Lord, and my own soul, shall as briefly as I
can, give account thereof. -- But before! come to speak to the point in hand, I
cannot forget the rock out of which I was hewn, and the sistern out of which I
was dug; who was by nature a child of wrath as well as others, and by actual
transgression added sin to sin, as my conscience and others did know. But God
had mercy for me in store when I neither deserved it nor defired it, for he
knows who are his; and the elect shall obtain it, forever blessed be his holy
name, to whom be glory forever, amen. Now in this faith or belief I stand, not
doubting but it is the faith of God's elect.

1. I believe there is one Essence or Being, even one God, who made heaven and
earth, the waters, and all things therein contained, who governs all things by
the word of his power, and has appointed life and death to men and bounded
their habitations, whose providence extends to the least creature and actions.

2. I believe this God is father to our Lord Jesus Christ. In a special
understanding may be distinguished as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and yet but
one in Essence.

3. I believe that as God made the world, so by his word made he man in his own
image without sin, and gave him a most excellent place and being, giving him
commandment what he should do, and what he should forbear; but through the
malice of Satan working with his wife was deceived; for she did eat, and gave
her husband and he did eat, which was the first cause of the curse to him, and
reached to all his posterity, by which came death natural, and death eternal.

4. I believe in this interim of time the Lord manifested his great love in
that word, the seed of the woman shall break the head of the serpent, but
enmity was between the two seeds.

5. I believe that at and after time the Lord was worshipped by sacrifices,
though darkly held forth to us.

6. I believe after that God in his own time chose a people to himself, and
gave them his laws and statutes in a special manner, though he had always his
chosen ones in every generation.

7. I believe with this people he made a choice covenant to be their God, and
they to be his people: which covenant they brake though he was a father to
them, and was grieved for them, and yet did not only give them his laws, but
sent his prophets early and late, but they would not hear; and in fullness of
time sent his only Son: but as they had abused his prophets, so they killed his
only Son.

8. I believe God in his Son made a new covenant, a sure and everlasting
covenant, not like that he made with Israel, of which Moses that faithful
servant was mediator, but a covenant of grace and peace through his only Son,
that whosoever believed in him shoud not perish, but have everlasting life.

9. I believe that all those that are in this covenant of grace, shall never
fall away nor perish, but shall have life in the prince of life, the Lord Jesus
Christ 10. I believe no man can come to the Son but they that are drawn by the
Father to the Son, and they that come, he in no wise will cast away. 11. I
believe he came to call sinners to repentance, for the whole need him not, but
they that are sick. 12. I believe that by the shedding of his precious blood is
my redemption, and not mine only but all that or shall be saved. 13. I believe
that as he was God so was he man, for he did not take the nature of angels but
the nature of Abraham. 14. I believe God has laid the iniquity of all his
elect and called ones upon him. 15. I believe the Father is fully satisfied,
and the debt is truly paid to the utmost farthing, and the poor sinner is quit,
and set free from all sin past present and to come. 16. I believe the holy
scriptures which testify of Christ in dark shadows and types, and all that was
he was born of a virgin at Bethlehem, and come to his own and they received him
not. 17. I believe he was put to death and hanged upon a tree, called the
cross, and was buried, and the third day rose again according to the
scriptures, and appeared to many 18. I believe he ascended to his Father and
sits at his right hand, having made request for his. 19. I believe that the
Fathers commandment and his declaration of him is to be observed, when the
Father uttered that voice saying, this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
pleased hear ye him. -- 20. I believe there is no salvation but by him alone;
no other name under heaven by which man can be saved. 21. I believe he is sent
unto the world, and to be published to all men; but some, ye many reject the
counsel of God against themselves. 22. I believe none have power to choose
salvation, or to believe in Christ for life; 'its only the gift of God. 23. I
believe although God can bring men to Christ, and cause them to believe in him
for life, yet he has appointed an ordinary way to effect that great work of
faith, which is by means of sending a ministry into the world, to publish
repentance to the sinner, and salvation, and that by Jesus Christ; and they
that are faithful shall save their own souls and some that hear them 24. I
believe that they that are sent of God are not to deliver a mission of their
own brain, but as it is in the scripture of truth, for holy men wrote as they
were inspired by the holy Spirit. 25. I believe the precious gifts of the
Spirit's teaching were procured by Christ's assention and given to men for
begetting of souls to the truth, and for establishment and consolation of those
that are turned to the Lord; for none shall pluck them out of his Father's
hand. 26. I believe no man is to rush into the ministry without a special call
from God, even as ^o^^^^ ministers had of old, which was the call of the Low
Spirit, with some talent or talents to declare the counsel of God to poor
sinners, declaring the grace of God through Jesus Christ, even to those that
are yet in the power of satan: yea, to bring glad tidings by and from the Lord
Jesus Christ. 27. I believe this ministry is to go forth, and he that has
received grace with a talent or talents, as he has received freely, of the
Lord, so he it freely to give, looking for nothing again but the promise of the
Lord. 28. I believe none is to go forth but by commission, and carefully to
observe the same according as Christ gave it fort without adding or
diminishing; first to preach Christ, that is to make disciples, and then to
baptize them, but not to bapatize them before they believe; and then to teach
them what Christ commanded them. For as the Father had his order in the former
dispen^ation, so has the Son. In former times the Lord spoke in diverse ways
and manners, but now has he spoken by his Son. 29. I believe hat as God
prepared a begetting ministry, even so does he also prepa^^ a feeding ministry
in the church, where a called people out of the world, by the word and Spirit
of the Lord, assembling of themselves together in a holy brotherhood,
continuing in the apostles doctrine, fellowship, breaking bread, and prayer.
30. I believe such a church ought to wait for the holy Spirit of promise, on
whom it may fall, and to choose out among themselves either pastor teacher or
elders to rule, or deacons to serve the table, that others may give themselves
to the word and prayer, and to keep them close to the Lord, and their
followship clear and destinct, not to have fellowship with the unfruitful works
or darkness, but rather to reprove them. 31. I believe the church of Christ, or
this company gathered, are bound to wait on the Lord for the Spirit to help
them, and have liberty, and are under duty, that they may prophesy one by one.
32. I believe that the true baptism of the gospel, is a visible believer with
his own content to be baptized in common water, by dying or as it were
drowning, to hold forth death, burial and resurrection, by a messenger of
Jesus, into the name of the Father, Son and holy spirit. 33. I believe the
promise of the Father concerning the return of Israel and Judah, and the coming
of the Lord to raise up the dead in Christ, and to change them that are alive,
that they may reign with him a thousand years, according to the scripture. 34.
I believe the res^rrection of the wicked to receive their just judgment, go ye
cursed to the devil and his angels forever. 35. I believe as eternal judgment
to the wicked, so I believe the glorious declaration of the Lord saying, come
ye blessed of my Father, enter into the joy of your Lord, which joy, eye has
not seen, ear has not heard, neither can it enter into the heart of man to
conceive the glory that God has prepared for them that love and wait for his
appearance; wherefore come Lord Jesus, come quickly.

"For this faith and profession I stand, and have so l^d the same with my blood
in Boston, in New England, and hope through the strength of my Lord, shall be
enabled to witness the same to death, although I am a poor unworthy creature,
and have nothing to plead or sly unto but to grace, grace; and have nothing to
^est on but only the mercy, the free mercy of God in and through Jesus Christ
my Lord and savior; to whom be honor, glory and praise forever and ever, Amen.
Thus have I given you an humble and true account of my standing, and of my dear
wife's standing in our ^^ith and order, that you may consider the same,
comparing what is written by the holy scriptures, which are our rule toward
God and man; committing this and you to the wisdom and counsel of God. Yours
in all love to serve continually having you in our prayers; fareyewell.

"This for Mr. John Angher, and my brother Robert Holmes, and my brother-in
law, and sister, with Mary Nonly, and to them that love and fear the Lord. For
Robert Holmes in the parish of Manchester -- Lancashire." Obadiah Holmes's
manuscript, 1675.




I SHALL close this chapter with an address of Mr. Roger Williams to governor
Endicot, concerning these affairs. The governor having occasion (as they often
had) to write to Mr. Williams about the "peace of the English and Indians," and
having at the entrance of his letter said "We I as free in my spirit as
formerly I have been to write unto you, you should have received another manner
of sa^utation than now, with a good conscience I can express; however God
knows who are his, and what he is pleased to hide from sinful man in this
life, shall in that great day be manifested to all." -- Mr. Williams refering
to the sufferings of Mr. Clarke and Mr. Holmes says, "Sir, at the reading of
this line, the speech of that wise woman of Tekoa unto David come fiesh unto my
thoughts; Speaks not the King this thing as one that is guilty? for will my
honored and beloved friend not know me for fear of being disowned by his
conscience? Shall the goodness and integrity of hi^ conscience to God cause him
to forget me? Does he quiet his mind with this (God knows who are his? God
hides from sinful man; God will reveal before all?) Oh how comes it then that I
have heard so often, heard so lately, and heard so much, that he that speaks so
tenderly for his own, has yet so little respect, mercy or pity to the like
conscientious persuasions of other men! are all the thousands of millions of
millions of consciences at home and abroad, fuel only for a prison, for a whip,
for a stake, for a gallows! are no consciences to breath the air, but such as
suit and sample his! may not the ^^ost High be pleased to hide from his is well
as from the eyes of his fellow servants, fellow-mankind, fellow-English? Who
can shut when he will open? and who can open, when he that has the key of
David will shut? --

"OBJECTION. But what makes this to heretics, blasphemers, seducers, to them
that sin against their conscience (as Mr. Cotton says) after conviction?
First, I answer, he was a tyrant that put an innocent man into a bear's-skin,
and so caused him as a wild beast to be baited to death. Secondly, This is the
common cry of haunters or persecutors. heretics, blasphemers. etc. and why, but
for crossing the persecutors consciences (it may be but their superstitions)
whether Turkish, popish, protestant, etc. This is the outcry of the pope and
prelates, and of the Scotch presbyterians, who would fire all the world, to be
avenged on the sectarian heretics, the blasphemous heretics, the suducing
heretics, etc. had it not pleased the God of heaven who bounds the insolent
rage of the surious ocean to raise up a second Cromwell, to stay the fury of the
oppressor, whether English, Scottish, popish, presbyterian, independent, etc.
--

"LET it not be offensive in your eyes, that I single out a point, a cause of
^y banishment, wherein I greatly fear one or two sad evils have befallen your
soul and conscience. The point is that of the civil magistrates dealing in
matters of conscien^^, and religion, as also of persecuting any for any matter
merely spiritual and religious. The two evils intimated are these: First, I
fear you cannot after so much light, and so much profession to the contrary
(not only to myself often in private, Governor Endicot was once a member of
Salem church, under Mr. William's ministry.
but) before many witnesses; I say, I fear you cannot say and act so much,
against so many several consciences, former and latter, but wit great checks,
great threatenings and inward throws of conscience. Secondly, If you shall thank
God, that it is not so with you, but that you do what conscience bids you in
God's presence, upon God's warrant, I must then be humbly faithful to tell you,
that I fear your underprizing of holy light, has put out the candle, and the
eye of conscience in these particulars, and that delusions, strong dul^sions,
and that from God (by satan's subtilty) has seized upon your very soul's
belief, because you prized not, loved not the persecuted Son of God in his
despised truths and servants -- I desire to say it tremblingly and mournfully,
I know not which way he will please to raise his glory, only I know my duty my
conscience and my love, all which enforce me to knock, to call, to cry at the
gate of heaven, and at yours, and to present you with this loving, though loud
and faithful noise, and sound of a few grounds of deeper examination of both
our souls and consciences, uprightly and impartially at the holy and dreadful
tribunal of him that is appointed the judge of all the living and the dead.

"BE pleased then (honored sir) to remember that the thing which we call
conscience is of such a nature, especially in Englishmen, as once a pope of
Rome at the suffering of an Englishman in Rome himself observed that although
it be groundless, false and deluded, yet it is not by any arguments of torments
easily removed. I speak not of the stream of the multitude of all nations,
which have their ebbings and flowings in religion (as the longest sword, and
strongest arm of flesh carries it The following words are remarkable viz. "It
is made by learned and judicious writes one of the undoubted rights of
sove^ignty to determine what religion shall be publicly professed and
exercised within their dominions. Why else do we in New England that profess
the doctrine of Calvin, yet practice the discipline of them called independent
or congregational churches, but because the authority of the country is
persuaded, that is most agreeable to the mind of God." Mr Hubbard's election
sermon at Boston, May 3, 1676, p. 35.
) but I speak of conscience, a persuasion fixed in the mind and heart of a man,
which inforceth him to judge (as Paul said of himself a persecutor) and to do
so and so with respect to God, his worship, etc. This conscience is found in
all mankind, more or less. -- To this purpose let me freely without offense
remember you (as I did Mr. Clarke, newly come up from his sufferings amongst
you) I say, remember you of the story I did him, of William Hartly in queen
Elizabeth her days, who receiving the sentence of hanging -- spoke confidently
(as afterward he suffered) what tell you me of hanging, if I had ten thousand
millions of lives, I would spend them all for the faith of Rome. Sir, I am far
from glancing the least countenance on the consciences of papists -- all that I
observe is, that boldness and confidence, zeal and resolution, as it is
commendable in a kind when it seriously respects a deity. so also, the greatest
confidence has sometimes need of the greatest search and examination. -- Wise
men use to enquire, what motives, what occasions, what snares, what temprations
were there which moved, allured, etc. -- Surely sir, the baits, the
temptations, the snares laid to catch you were not few nor common. -- It is no
small offer, the choice and applause and rule over so many towns, so many holy,
so many wise, in such a holy way as you believe you are in -- I cannot but fear
and lament, that some of these and others have been too strong and potent with
you. -- Sir, I must be humbly bold to say, it is impossible for any man or men
to maintain their Christ by the sword, and to worship a true Christ! to fight
against all consciences opposite to theirs, and not to fight against God in
some of them, and to hunt after the precious life of the true Lord Jesus
Christ. Oh remember whether your principles and consciences, must in time and
opportunity force you! -- yourself and others have said it, by your principles
such whom you count heretics, blasphemers, seducers, ought to be put to death,
You cannot be faithful to your principles and consciences, if you satisfy them
with but imprisoning, fining, whipping and banishing the heretics, and by
saying that banishing is a kind of death, as some chief with you formerly said
in my case. -- I end with an humble cry to the father of mercies, that you may
take David's counsel, and silently commune with your own heart upon your bed,
reflect upon your own spirit, and believe him that said to his over-zealous
disciples, you know not what spirit you are of. That no sleep may seize your
eyes, nor slumber upon your eyelids, until your serious thoughts have calmly,
and unchangably, through help from Christ, fixed, first on a moderation toward
the spirit and consciences of all mankind, merely differing from, or opposing
yours with only religious and spiritual opposition. -- Secondly, a deep and
cordial resolution to search, to listen, to pray, to fast, and more fearfully,
more tremblingly to enquire what the holy pleasure, and the holy mysteries of
the MOST HOLY are; it whom I humbly desire to be, your poor fellow servant,
unfeignedly, respective, and faithful.

ROGER WILLIAMS." Appendix of his reply to Cotton, 1652, p. 303. -- 313. Mr.
Cotton died the 23d of December that year.


How happy had it been for New England, and for governor Endicot in particular,
if they had then regarded this faithful admonition of their old friend! but
disregarding of it, Mr. Williams's words a few years after were fully verified,
when, under governor Endicot's administration, the blood of the quakers was
shed, which has left an indellible stain upon their characters, and "sullied
the glory of their former sufferings from the bishops; for now it appeared that
the New England puritans were no better friend, to liberty of conscience than
their adversaries, and that the question between them was not, whether one
party of christians should have power to oppress another, but who should have
that power?" Neal's history of N. E. vol. I. p. 320.


CHAP. V. A variety of events, from 1651 to 1664.
A RIVIEW of 1651, presents before us such a dark cloud and threatening gloom,
upon the cause of believers baptism, and true liberty of conscience, as must
affect every heart that is not extremely obdurate. The friends of that cause
had been so cruelly treated in Europe, that a number of them, ^ed into America,
where a persecuting temper followed them, and expelled them out of the
Massachusetts colony; but God gave them favor in the eyes of the heathen, from
whom they obtained a grant of lands, to begin the first civil government upon
that ever allowed equally liberty of conscience since our Savior died for us.
With great hazard and expense M^. Williams had procured a charter for that
purpose, which they had enjoyed about seven years, when alas! Mr. Coddington,
who had the deeds and records of the Islands in his own hands, went to England,
and procured from the council of state a commission, dated April 3. 1651,
signed by J. Bradshaw, constetuting him governor of the islands, to rule them
with a council of six men, nominated by the people and approved by himself;
which split this little colony into two parts, and Mr. Clarke and his brethren
were to submit to a governor that they had no hand in choosing, and their
estates lay at his mercy. This melancholy news arrived just about the time that
he and his brethren had been so cruelly handled in the Massachusetts, only for
visiting and worshipping with an aged brother there. At the same time, a party
both of English and savages were supported in the heart of Mr. Williams's part
of the colony, in opposition to all the good orders that he endeavored to
establish among them. And what could they now do! where could they go for
relief! banished from their mother kingdom, and from neighboring colonies, who
were exerting all their power to divide and conquer them; and a man of the
greatest worldly note among them, seemed as if he was like to do it
effectually. Near the same time the court at Boston imposed a large fine upon
the church in Malden, for calling a man to be their minister, without the
approbation of the rulers and other ministers; and as they had before a law
against gathering churches without their consent, their assembly now made
another wherein they enacted, "That no minister should be called unto office in
any of the churches, without the approbation of some of the magistrates, as
well as the neighboring churches; on which ground in the year 1653, the court
would not allow the north church in Boston to call Mr. Powell, a well gifted
though illetirate person to the stated office of a public teacher or minister;
wherefore the people contented themselves with his being called to the place of
a ruling elder. -- And whereas the plantations of New England had never as yet
been acquainted, with the way of paying tithes for the support of the ministry,
it was now left to be power of the county courts throughout the whole
jurisdiction, to make sufficient provision for the maintenance of the ministry
in the respective towns of the colony."


CAPT. Johnson at that time said, "familists, seekers, antinomians, and
anabaptists, are so ill armed, that they think it best sleeping in a whole
skin, fearing that if the day of battle once go on, they shall fall among
antichrists armies; therefore they cry out like cowards, if you will let me
alone, I will let you alone; but assuredly the Lord Christ has said, he that
is not with us, is against us; there is no room in his army for toleratorists."
Johnson, page 231.
Had this been true, how could Mr. Williams and Mr. Clarke have persevered like
heroes, in the cause of equity and liberty as they did? for being requested by
their injured neighbors, they again crossed the boisterous ocean, and appeared
as advocates for them at the British court; and also published to the world
their pleas for equal liberty of conscience; and where can any writers be found
of so early date, who defended that important right of mankind, so well as they
did? Mr. Locke's excellent letters upon that subject were written near forty
years afterward.

A LITTLE look back will give a more clear and just view of the important
concerns of Mr. Williams's agency at this time. When the commissioners of the
united colonies met at Plymouth September 7, 1648, Mr. Coddington and Capt.
Partridge tried for a confederacy with them, but were denied it, unless they
would come in as part of Plymouth colony. Mr. Henry Bull then complained to
them, that some Narraganset Indians had beat him, and done him other injuries;
and Mr. John Smith assistant for Warwick, sent a writing by Mr. Holden and
Warner, in the behalf of the whole town, "wherein they complain, among other
things, of diverse injuries, insolences and affronts offered them by the Indians
that are about them, and near inhabitants to them, as namely. killing their
cattle, about a hundred hogs, abusing their servants when they take them alone,
sometimes making violent entrance into their houses, and striking the masters
thereof, stealing and purloining their goods; and hereupon do earnestly desire
to know the minds of the commissioners herein, and to receive advice from
them." Upon which the commissioners gave them a writing to the sachems and
others to warn them "to prevent and abstain from all such miscarriges for the
future, and if any of them receive any injury from the English, upon complaint
in due place and order, satisfaction shall be endeavored them according to
justice, as the like will be expected from them." When the commissioners met at
Boston, July 23, 1649: Warwick wrote again to them; but they refused to do any
thing for their defense, till they could find under what colony their
plantation fell, and it was then disputed whether it belonged to the
Massachusetts, or Plymouth, and they advised the latter to take it, When the
commissioners met again at Hartford, September 5th, 1650, they received a
letter from Mr. Easton president, in the name of the council of that colony, in
which he declared, that "Rhode Island and Warwick were combined and bound
mutually to support one another." Upon this the commissioners mention a former
article of advice which they had received from the honorable committee of
parliament, "that in this and like cases the bounds of patents should be first
set out by a jury, of uninterested persons, and that all inhabiting within the
limits so set forth, should fall under the government established by patent."
But instead of following this direction, after mentioning that the inhabitants
of Warwick claimed an interest in Mr. Williams's patent, and refused to be
brought under the Massachusetts government, they advised the authority of
Plymouth "forthwith to resume the right they formerly had by patent to the
place." And that if the inhabitants refused to submit to them then the advice
of said committee should be taken, and if the same was not complied with, "that
real damages duly proved, be levied by legal force, though with as much
moderation and tenderness as the case will permit." Records of the United
Colonies.
This was the treatment that was shown to Warwick; and hearing of what Mr
Coddington had done, they joined with Providence in sending Mr. Williams to
England. William Arnold hired a messenger secretly to carry a letter to Boston,
to apprize their rulers of it, Massachusetts history, vol. 3. Page 237 -- 239.
but they were notified of it in a better way: For at a meeting of the
commissioners of the united colonies at New Haven, September 4, 1651, they
received the following letter, viz.

"MAY it please this honored committee to take knowledge, that we the
inhabitants of Shawomet alias Warwick, having undergone diverse oppressions and
wrongs, amounting to great damage since we first possessed this place; being
forced thereby to seek to that honorable state of Old-England for relief, which
did inevitably draw great charge upon us, to the further impairing of ou^
estates; and finding favor for redress, were willing to wave for that time (in
regard to the great troubles and employment that then lay on that state) all
other lesser wrongs we then underwent, so that we might be replaced in and upon
this our purchased possession, and enjoy it peaceably for time to come, without
disturbance or molestation by those from whom we had formerly suffered. But
since our gracious grant from the honorable parliament, in re-placeing of us in
this place, we have been and daily are pressed with intolerable grivences, to
the eating up of our labors, and waisting of our estates making our lives,
together with our wives and children, bitter and uncomfortable; insomuch, that
groaning under our burdens, we are constrained to make our address to the
honorable parliament and state, once again, to make our just complaint against
our causless molestors, who by themselves and their agents, are the only cause
of this our reuttering of our distressed condition. May it please therefore
this honored assembly, to take notice of this our solemn intelligence (given
unto you as the most public authorized society appertaining unto, and
instituted in the united colonies, whom our complaints do concern) that we are
now preparing ourselves with all convenient speed for Old-England, to make our
grievances known again to the state, which fall upon us by reason that the
order of parliament concerning us has not been observed, nor the enjoyment of
our granted privileges permitted to us, that we are as it were bought and sold
from one patent and jurisdiction to another. In that we have been prohibited
and charged to acquit this place since the order of parliament given out and
known to the contrary. In that we have had warrants sent us, to summon us to
the Massachusetts court, and officers employed amongst us for that purpose. In
that these barberous Indians abouts us, with evil minded English mixed among
us, under pretense of some former personal subjection to the government of the
Massachusetts countenacing of them, cease not to kill our cattle, offer
violence to our familes, vilefy authority of parliament vouchsafed to us,
justifying their practices with many menaces and threatenings, as being under
the protection of the Massachusetts. In that we have been restrained this seven
or eight years past of common commerce in the country, and that only for
matters of conscience. In that our estates formerly taken from us remain yet
unrestored, with these additions thereunto. These and the like are the grounds
of our complaints, with our serious desire that you would be pleased to take
notice of them, as our solemn intelligence given hereof, that as yourselves
shall think meet, you may give further seasonable intelligence to your several
colonies whom it may concern, so that their agent or agents may have seasonable
instructions to make answer, and we hereby shall acquit ourselves, that we
offer not to proceed in thse our complaints, without giving due and seasonable
notice thereof.

By me JOHN GREEN, jun. Clerk.

In behalf of the town of Warwick.

Warwick, the first of September 1651.

THIS brought matters to a close trial among them and the commissioners for the
Massachusetts (who were Mr. Simon Bradstreet, and Mr. William Hathorne,
Esq'rs,) made a long declaration, how Plymouth gave up their right in that land
to them in 1643; which was approved of by all the commissioners, who advised
them to proceed against Gorton and his company; and had silently ass^nted to
what they had done from time to time since; and that when in 1649 they were
advised to return those lands back to Plymouth their court sent two deputies to
the assembly at Plymouth, with orders to offer, to "resign and submit the said
lands, and persons residing thereon to the government of Plymouth; they only
promising to do equal justice both to English and Indians there, according to
our engagements; but the government of Plymonth chose rather to ratify the
asoresaid resignment of their commissioners." After which they had "out of
their own treasury allowed a large gratuity of corn to the Indians under their
government their, to keep them alive, the cattle of Gorton's company having
destroyed most of their, rather than force to compel them, till all other means
and ways of prudence for issuing these and the like differences were used." And
closed with asking what aid the other jurisdictions would afford them, for the
righting their injured and oppressed people, and bringing delinquents to
condign punishment? The Connecticut and New Haven commissioners answered, by
owning that they had their advice in 1643, to proceed against Gorton's company,
and that when Plymouth commissioners yielded up their right to the
Massachusetts, the others, being neither concerned, nor understanding where the
right lay, saw no cause to dessent, etc. The commissioners for Plymouth (who
were Mr. John Brown, and Mr. Timothy Hatherley) declared that what was done by
the commissioners for their colony in 1643, in resigning of said lands to the
Massachusetts, was not at all in their power, neither could the Massachusetts
receive any such resignation without injuring the third and sixth articles of
their confederation; what right the authority of the Massachusetts had to send
for Samuel Gorton and company, "inhabiting so far out of their jurisdiction
they understand not." And as to what the governor of Plymouth and some others
did in 1650, about ratifying that former resignation of Warwick to the
Massachusetts, they said they had "protested against it in the court of
Plymouth, as being directly contrary to the order of the honorable committee of
the parliament of England, and contrary to the articles of confederations with
the rest of the colonies, And whereas we are informed, that the court of the
Massachusetts have lately sent out several warrants to several persons
inhabiting Warwick and Pawtuxet, and have made seizure upon some or their
estates, we do hereby protest against such proceedings if any there be" Records
of the United Colonies.
The Massachusetts were so unwilling to have these things laid before the
parliament, that they put Mr. Williams to great distresses only for attempting
to take his passage through their colony.

THE town of Newport signed an engagement and request to Mr. Clarke in these
words, "We whose names are here under written, This was sig^ed by John Faston,
James Barker, John Cranston, R^^t Cra^^, John Sheldon, S^mu^l Hu^^a^d, John
Allen, Henry Bull, Edward Thurston, Nathaniel West, William Dyre, William
Lytherland, Richard Knight, Thomas Clarke, Thomas Du^gan, etc to the number of
sixty five, who with the six counselors were almost all the free inhabitants
of Newport, as Mr. Clarke said afterword to their general assembly. F^^^ty one
of the inhabitants of Portsmout^ signed a like request. [C^pied from the
original papers now before me]

Many of above men were atterwards noted rulers in that colony; and Mr. Dungan
was member of Mr. Clarke's church till about the your 1684; when he went to
Pennsylvania, and became the h^^ ^^ptist minister in that colony, where he left
a nura^^^^^ poite^^^^ (...) ^^^^ry of the Baptist^s in that colony, pag^ (...).


being resolved to make our address unto the parliament of England, in point of
our lands and liberties, do earnestly desire those six men that were last
chosen, the council of the town of Newport, and such as they shall consult
with, to improve their best abilities for the managing thereof: We also do
earnestly request Mr. John Clarke to do his utmost endeavors in soliciting our
cause in England: And we do hereby engage ourselves to the utmost of our
estates to assist them, being resolved in the mean time peaceably to yield all
due subjection unto the present power set over us. Witness our hands the 15th
of October, in the year of our Lord God, 1651. -- He sailed for England the
next month.

MR. CODDINGTON having gotten the command of the islands, Providence and
Warwick, each chose six deputies, who met at Providence Nov. 4. and unanimously
concluded to stand embodied and incorporated as before, by virtue of their
charter, and as president Faston had given place to Mr. Coddington; they chose
another in his room, and made several laws, one of which was to prohibit any
from purchasing lands of the Indians, without the assemblies approbation, on
penalty of forfeiting the same to the colony. When those two agents arrived in
England, they united in a petition to the council of state, who on April 8th,
1652, refered the same to the committee for foreign affairs. The court of
election at Warwick, May 18, made a law to orbid the Dutch who were not
inhabitants among them, fr^^ trading with the Indians in this colony, upon
penalty of forfeiting both goods and vessel to the colony if they did: and the
president was ordered to give the governor of Manhato's notice of it. When
their assembly met again in the fall at Providence, they wrote the following
letter to Mr. Williams, viz.

" Honored Sir,
"WE may not neglect any opportunity to salute you in this your absence, and
have not a little cause to bless God, who has pleased to select you to such a
purpose, as we doubt not but will conduce to the pence and safety of us all, as
to make you once more an instrument to impart and disclose our cause unto those
noble and grave senators our honorable protectors, in whose eyes God has given
you honor (as we understand) beyond our hopes, and moved the hearts of the wise
to stir on your behalf; we give you hearty thanks for your care and diligence,
to watch all opport^^^^ (...) to promote our peace, for we perceive your

face, being that the cruel begin to stir in these western parts, and to unite
in one again, such as of late have had seeming separation in some respects, to
encourage and strengthen our week and infeebled body to perform its work in
these foreign parts, to the honor of such as take care, have been and are so
tender of our good, though we be unworthy to be had in rememberance by persons
of to noble places, endued with parts of so excellent and honorable and
abundantly beneficial use.

"SIR, give us leave to intimate thus much, that we humbly conceive (so far as
we are able to understand) that if it be the pleasure of our protectors to
renew our charter for the re-establishing of our government, that it might tend
much to the weighing of men's minds, and subjecting of persons who have been
refractory, to yield themselves over as unto a settled government, if it might
be the pleasure or that honorable state to invest appoint and empower yourself
to come over as governor of this colony for the space of one year, and so the
government to be honorably put upon this place, which might seem to add weight
forever hereafter in the constant and successive derivation of the same. We
only present it to your deliberate thoughts and consideration, with our hearty
desires that your time of stay there for the effectual perfecting and finishing
of your so weighty affairs may not seem tedious, nor be any discouragement unto
you; rather than you shall suffer for loss of time here, or expense there, we
are resolved to stretch forth our ha^^^ at you return beyond our strength for
your supply -- Your loving bedfellow is in health, and presents her endeared
affection, so are all your family -- Mr. Sails also and his, with the rest of
your friends throughout the colony, who wish and desire earnestly to see your
face.

"From the general assembly of this colony of Providence-Plantations, assembled
in the town of Providence the 28th of October 1652.

"JOHN GREEN, General recorder." Providence Records.


ON the 2d of October, the council of state gave and order and wrote letters to
vacate Mr. Coddington's commission, and to confirm their former character;
which were sent over by William Dyre. And about the 16th of February 1653, he
brought a letter to Providence, signed by Messrs, Sanford Baulston, Porter and
William Jefferies, requesting the two towns on the main to appoint a time to
meet those on the island, to hear and act upon the states letters. Providence
met upon the affair, and enquired why those letters were not brought to them,
seeing they had continued to act upon the charter, after the island was parted
from them? Dyre told them that the two agents had united in their petition, and
that as it appeared to him that the island was the major part of the colony,
therefore they had the greatest interest in the letters, and he had left them
there. President Smith, William Field, and some others joined with Dyre, and
strove to persuade them to "account themselves a disordered confused rout, as
he acknowledged the islanders were, and to accout all officers orders of court,
laws and cases depending as null, and to come to a popular meeting to lay a new
foundation of government for the colony." This they could not consent to, but
each town chose six commissioners who met at Pawtuxet on February 25th, and
sent four messengers to the island for those letters or a copy of them; and
that if the states orders were for them all to unite again, then to agree upon
a meeting for that purpose. Dyre seeing no other way to carry his own scheme,
assumed the power to himself to call the whole colony together by the following
instrument.

"Loving friends and neighbors, these are to signify unto you, that it has
pleased the right honorable, the council of state, authorized by the supreme
authority of the commonwealth of England, to betrust myself with letter and
orders concerning this colony, and the welfare thereof (...) be pleased
therefore to understand, that upon Tuesday come seven night, at Portsmouth on
Rhode Island, at Mr. Baulston's house, I shall be there (God willing) ready to
attend the communication of the trust committed to my charge, unto all such
free inhabitants as shall there make their personal appearance.

Given under my hand this present 6th day of the week, being the 18th of
February 1652. WILLIAM DYRE."


A COPY of this he sent to each town, and many of the freemen met on the said
March 1st, but instead of throwing all up, they ordered, "That all officers who
were in place when Mr. Coddington's commission obstructed, should stand in
their places, to act according to their former commissions, upon the island;
and the rest in the colony according as they had been annually chosen, until a
new election according to former order." The commissioners met again at
Pawtuxet on March 9th, to receive the answer of their messengers from the
island, who reported what was done, but that they could not obtain so much as a
copy of those letters from England. Upon which they sent again therefore, and
also a proposal of joining with the towns on the island in the next election,
if they would agree to it in their former method, and give them ten days
notice. By some means such notice was not given, therefore the two towns on the
main met at Providence, May 17th, 1653, and elected their officers. And
assembly met at the same time on the island, and chose Mr. Sanford their
president, and some assistant for each town in the colony. And they sent Mr.
James Barker, and Mr. Richard Knight to Mr. Coddington, to demand the statute
book, and book of records. And as it was then a time of war betwixt England and
Holland, and a mention was made of it in the letters which confirmed their
charter, Dyre thought to make his advantage thereby, and procured commissions
for himself, Capt. Underhill, and Edward! lull, to act against the Dutch in
America; and some cannon with twenty men were sent to the English on the east
end of Long Island, to enable them to act against the Dutch who lay to the
westward of them. This alarmed Providence colony, who met again in June, and a
third time at Warwick, on August 13th, when they answered a letter from the
Massachusetts, and remonstrated against being drawn into a war with the Dutch;
and wrote to Mr. Williams an account of Dyre's conduct, and of their being
urged to give up their former actings as null; but say they, "being still in
the same order you left us, and observing two great evils that such a course
would bring upon us. First, the hazard of involving in all the disorders and
blood shed which have been committed on Rhode Island since their separation
from us." Secondly, the invading and frustrating of justice in diverse weighty
causes then orderly depending in our courts, in some of which causes Mr. Smith,
president, William Field, etc. were deeply concerned;" therefore they could not
yield to such a motion. Caliender -- Colony records. To give a clear idea of
their difficulties I would insert the following things.

"The 24th of the first month called March, in the year (so commonly called)
1637-8 Memorandum, that we Canonius and Miantinomo, the two chief sachems of
the Narraganset, by virtue of our general command of this bay, as also the
particular subjecting of the dead sachem of Aquedneck and Kitackamuckqut,
themselves and lands unto us, have sold to Mr. Coddington and his friends
united unto him, the great island of Aquedneck, laying hence eastward in this
bay, as also the marsh or grass upon Quinunnuqut, and the rest of the islands
in this bay (excepting Chibachuwesa [Prudence] formerly sold to Mr. Winthrop,
the now governor of the Massachusetts, and Mr. Williams of Providence) also the
grass upon the rivers and bounds about Kitackamuckqut, and from thence to
Paupusquatch, for the full payment of forty fathom of white beads, to be
equally divided between us; in witness whereof we have here subscribed. Item,
that by giving, by Miantonomo's hands, ten coats twenty hoes to the present
inhabitants, they shall remove themselves from off the island before next
winter.

In presence of, The mark X of Yotuesh, Roger Williams, Randal Holden, The mark
of Assotemust; The mark of Mihammoh; Canonicus his son. Witness our hands, The
mark of Canonicus, The mark of Miantinomo.

"Memorandum, that Osemaquin freely consent that Mr. William Coddington, and
his friends united unto him, shall make use of any grass or trees on the main
land on Pawakasick side, and all my men, to the said Mr. Coddington, and
English, his friends united to him, having received of Mr. Coddington five
fathoms of wampum, as gratuity for himself and the rest.

Witness, Roger Williams, Randal Holden. The mark X of Osamaquin.

Dated the sixth of the fifth month, 1638.

These deeds, with a number of receipts from the Indians, are upon the colony
records which Mr. Coddington had in his power when he obtained a commission to
be their governor without the peoples consent; and when they contended hotly
with him, it seems that he fled to Boston, where they sent after him, and
prevailed with him to sign an engagement on April 14th, 1652, in the presence
of Robert Knight and George Manning, to deliver up said deeds and records to
such men as the majority of the purchasers and freemen should appoint to
receive them, and to claim no more to himself than an equal share with the
other purchasers. And the above record shows that he had those deeds in his
hands till May, 1653. The main instance of bloodshed above refered to, was of
a principle inhabitant of Newport, who was charged with a capital crime before
a town-meeting, and was condemned by them, and carried forth and shot to death
in their presence. History of Providence.




BEFORE we proceed further upon their affairs, some transactions in the
Massachusetts call for our attention. Their ministers have often tried to
persuade people, that ignorance of the original languages that our bible was
wrote in, is the cause why any embrace with their fear of a fair dispute with
the learned Mr. Clarke the reader will judge, and what follows may afford
further light.

CAPT. Johnson, speaking of the first president of Harvard College, says, "He
was fitted from the Lord for the work, and, by those who have skill that way,
reported to be an able proficient both in the Hebrew, Greek and Latin
languages, and orthodox preacher of the truths of Christ, and very powerful
through his blessing to move the affections." Johnson, page 168.
Mr. Hubbard speaking of Mr. Dunstar's being made president in 1640 says,
"Under whom, that which was before but at best schola illustra, grew to the
stature and perfection of a college and flourished in the profession of all
liberal sciences for many years." And Mr. Prince, upon the New England
psalm-book says, "for a further improvement it was committed to the Rev. Mr.
Henry Dunstar, president of Harvard College; one of the greatest masters of the
oriental languages, that has been known in these ends of the earth." Prince's
preface to his own version of the psalms.


THIS eminent man was brought so far this year that, "he not only forebore to
present an infant of his own unto baptism, but also thought himself under some
obligation to bear his testimony in some sermons, against the administration of
baptism to any infant whatsoever." His therefore, as to desire him to cease
preaching there, and procured his removal both from his office and from his
living in the town; and Mr. Jonathan Mitchel, their minister at Cambridge,
wrote December 24th, 1653, "That after I came from him, I had a strange
experience; I found hurrying and pressing suggestions Governor Dudly died, July
31st, 1653, with these lines in his pocket, viz.

"Let men of God in courts and churches watch
"Over such as do a TOLERATION hatch."

against peedo-baptism, and injected scruples and tho'ts whither the other way
might not be right, and infant baptism and invention of men, and whether I
might with good conscience baptize children, and the like. And these thoughts
were darted in with some impression, and left a strange confusion and
sickliness upon my spirit. Yet methought, it was not hard to discern that they
were from the EVIL ONE. First, because they were rather injected, hurrying
suggestions, than any deliberate tho'ts, or bringing nay light with them.
Secondly, because they were unreasonable; interrupting me in my study for the
sabbath, and putting my spirit into confusion, so as I had much ado, to do
ought in my sermon. It was not now a time to study that matter; but when in the
former part of the week, I had given myself to that study, the more I studied
it, the more clear and rational light I saw for peedo-baptism, but now these
suggestions hurried me into scruples. -- It was a check to my former
self-confidence, and it made me fearful to go needlessly to Mr. D. for
methought I found a venum and poison, in his insinuations and discourses
against peedo-baptism. I resolved also on Mr. Hooker's principle, that I would
have an argument, able to remove a mountain, before I would recede from, or
appear against a truth or practice received among the faithful." Michel's life,
page 67 -- 70.


Query, How did he know but that his hurry and darkness was caused by the
opposition of his heart, and the injections of the devil against the truth? Can
any thing be more unreasonable than his conclusion drawn form the time of his
scruples? The fact was just this; in his own study he though it he saw a light for
infant baptism, but when he came to converse with a gentleman who knew more
than he did, it raised scruples in his mind about that practice. But where was
the modesty of a youth not thirty years old, when he accused one of the most
venerable fathers of that age, of having venum and poison in his discourses,
only because his own self-confidence was shocked thereby! Sure I am that if any
baptist minister had told such a story, and that it made him fearful of going
near a learned gentleman, whose arguments had bro't him to scruple whether he
had not been educated in a wrong way, but that he was resolved to have an
argument able to work miracles before he would leave, it, the other party would
then have had such grounds, to charge the baptist with wilfulness and obstinacy
upon, as they never yet had.

RIGEDNESS is a word that both episcopalians and presbyterians have often cast
upon our Plymouth fathers. Yet the Masschusetts now discovered so much more of
that temper than they, that Mr. Dunstar on October 24, 1654, resigned his
office among them, and removed and spent his remaining days at Situate, in
Plymouth colony. And it seems remarkable that Mr. Charles Chauncy, who, though
he allowed believers to bring their infants, yet held that baptism was dipping;
was on the 27th of November following, made president of Harvard College in Mr.
Dunstar's room. Magnali^, ^ook iv. page 128.
Mr. Chauncy was born in Hartfordshire in 1589; wa^ educated in the oriental,
and eminently in the Hebrew; in obtaining whereof, his conversation with (...)
Jew for the space of a year, was no little advantage." He was successful in the
ministry and Wa^^ in England, till being persecuted, and having suffered much
from Laud's party, he came to our Plymouth, in 1638; in which place he preached
about two years, and then, as he has been noted, he removed and settled at
Situate, where, upon his taking the charge of that flock, he preached from
that text, Wisdom has sent forth her maidens! but reflecting in his discourse
upon some compliences with the High commission court that he had been guilty in
his own country, he with tears said, "Alas, christians I am no maiden! my soul
has been defiled with false worship! how wondrous is the free grace of the
Lord Jesus Christ, that I should still be employed among the maidens of
wisdom!" upon an invitation from his old people at Ware, he now came to Boston,
with a design of returning to them, when the overseers of the college, "by
their vehement importunity prevailed with him to accept the government of that
society." Ibid. page 134 -- 136.
Where we will leave him, til we shall have further occasion to mention his
testimony against degeneracy in our land.

MR. Williams had many enemies and difficulties to encounter with, in pleading
for the rights of his colony, but was wonderfully supported and carried through
them all; of which some account is given in the following letter.

From Sir Henry Vane's at Belleau in Lincolnshire. April 1st. 53 (so called.)
"MY dear and loving friends and neigbours of Providence and Warwick; our noble
friend Sir Henry Vane, having the navy of England mostly depending on his care,
and going down to the navy at Portsmouth, I was invited by them both to
accompany his lady to Lincolnshire, where I shall yet stay as I fear until the
ship is gone; I must therefore pray your pardon that by the post I send this to
London. I hope it may have pleased the most high Lord of sea and land to bring
Capt. Ch-rst-n's ship and dear Mr. Dyre unto you, and with him the councils
letters, which answer the petition Sir Henry Vane and myself drew up, and the
council by Sir Henry's mediation granted us, for the confirmation of the
charter, until the determination of the controversy. This determination you may
please to understand is hindered by two main obstructions. The first is the
mighty war with the Dutch, which makes England and Holland and the nations
tremble: This has made the parliament sit Sir Henry Vane and two or three more
as commissioners to manage the war, which they have done with much engaging the
name of God with them, who has appeared in helping sixty of ours against
almost three-hundred of their men of war, and perchance to the sinking and
taking about one-hundred of theirs, and but one of ours which was sunk by our
own men. Our second obstruction is the opposition of our adversaries, Sir
Arther Haselrig and Colonel Fenwicke, who has married his daughter, Mr.
Winslow and Mr. Hopkins, both in great place; Winslow died in the West Indies
in 1655.
and all the friends they can make in the parliament and council, and all the
priests both presbyterian and independent; so that we stand as two armies ready
to engage, observing the motions and postures each of other, and yet shy each
of other. -- Under God the sheet anchor of our ship is Sir Henry, who will do
as the eye of God leads him, and he faithfully promised me that he would
observe the motion of our New England business, while I stayed some ten weeks
with his lady in Lincolnshire. Beside here is great thoughts and preparation
for a new parliament; some of our friends are apt to drink another parliament
will more favor us and our cause than this has done. You may please to put my
condition into your souls cases; remember, I am a father and an husband; I have
longed earnestly to return with the last ship, and with these, yet I have not
been willing to withdraw my shoulders from the burden least it pinch others,
and may fall heavy upon all; except you are pleased to give to me a discharge.
If you conceive it necessary for me still to attend this service, pray you
consider if it be not convenient that my poor wife be encouraged to come over
to me, and to wait together on the good pleasure of God for the end of this
matter. You know my many weights hanging on me; how my own place stands, and
how many reasons I have to cause me to make haste, yet I would not lose their
estates, peace and liberty, by leaving hastily. I write to my dear wife, my
great desire of her coming while I stay; yet left it to the freedom of her
spirit, because of the many dangers; truly at present the seas are dangerous,
but not comparably so much nor likely to be, because of the late great defeat
of the Dutch, and their present sending to us offers of peace. My dear friends
although it pleased God himself, by many favors to encourage me, yet please you
to remember, that no man can stay here as I do, leaving a present employment
there, without much self-denial, which I beseech God for more, and for you
also, that no private respects or gains or quarrels may cause you to neglect
the public and common safety, peace and liberties. I beseech the blessed God to
keep fresh in your thoughts what he has done for Providence-Plantations. My
dear respects to yourselves, wives and children; I beseech the eternal God to
be seen amongst you: -- So prays your most faithful and affectionate friend and
servant.

ROGER WILLIAMS."
P. S. My love to all my Indian friends.




As men of all tempers and sentiments had resorted to that colony, and there
had been from various quarters such interruptions of a regular administration
of government as have been mentioned, it is not to be wondered at if many
disorders appeared among them, of which enemies to their liberties did not fail
to make all the advantage they could. Mr. Williams attended upon the difficult
and important affairs of his agency another year, and then leaving the cause
there with Mr. Clarke and other friends, he came over to take care of things
here; and brought with him the following epistle, viz.

Loving and christ an friends,
I COULD not refuse this bearer. Mr. Roger Williams, my kind friend and ancient
acquaintance, to be accompanied with these few lines from myself to you, upon
his return to Providence colony; though perhaps my private and retired
condition, which the Lord of his mercy has brought me into. might have argued
strongly enough for my silence; but indeed something I hold myself bound to say
to you, out of the christian love I bear you, and for his sake whose name is
called upon by you and engaged on your behalf. How is it that there are such
divisions amongst you? Such headiness, tumults, disorders injustice? The noise
echoes into the cars of all, as well friends as enemies, by every return of
ships from those parts. Is not the fear and awe of God amongst you to restrain?
Is not the love of Christ in you to fill you with earning bowels one toward
another, and constrain you not to live to yourselves but to him that died for
you, yea, and is risen again? Are there no wise men amongst you? No public
self-denying spirits, that at least upon grounds of common safety, equity and
prudence can find out some way or means of union and reconciliation for you
amongst yourselves, before you become a prey to common enemies? Especially
since this state, by the last letter from the council of state, give you your
freedom, as supposing a better use would have been made of it than there has
been. Surely when kind and simple remedies are applied and are ineffectual, it
speaks loud and broadly, the high and dangerous distempers of such a body, as
if the wounds were incurable. But I hope better things from you, though I thus
speak, and shoud be apt to think, that by commissioners agreed on and appointed
on all parts, and on behalf of all interests, in a general meeting, such a
union and common satisfaction might arise, as through God's blessing might put
a stop to your growing breaches and distractions, silence your enemies,
encourage your friends, honor the name of God which of late has been much
blasphemed by reason of you; and in particular refresh and revive the sad heart
of him who mourns over your present evils, as being your affectionate friend,
to serve you in the Lord.

H. VANE." Copied from the original letter.

Belleau, the 8th of February, 1653-4.

WITH this Mr. Williams returned to Providence; but at first met with such
treatment as caused him to address the town in the following manner.

"Well beloved friends and neighbors,
I AM like a man in a great fog; I know not well how to stear. I fear to run
upon the rocks at home, having had trials abroad. I fear to run quite backward
(as men in mist do) and undo all that I have been a long time undoing myself to
do, viz. to keep up the name of a people, a free people, not inslaved to the
bondages and iron yokes of the great (both soul and body) oppressions of the
English and barbarians about us; nor to the divisions and disorders within
ourselves. Since I set the first step of any English ^^^t into these wild
parts, and have maintained a c^a^gable and hazardous correspondance with the
barbarians, and spent almost five years time with the state of England, to keep
off the rage of the English against us, what have I reaped of the root of being
the steping stone to so many families and towns about us, but grief, and
sorrow, and bitterness! I have been charged with folly so, that freedom and
liberty which I have always stood for; I say liberty and equallity both in land
and government. I have been blamed for parting with Mooshawsick, and afterward
Pawtuxet (which were mine own, as truly as any man's coat upon his back)
without reserving to myself a foot of la^^, or an inch of voice in any matter,
more than to my servants and strangers. It has been told me that I labored for
a licentious and contentious people; that I have foolishly parted with town and
colony advantages, by which I might have preserved both town and colony in as
good order as any in the country about us. This and ten times more I have been
censured for, and at this present am called a traitor by one party, against the
state of England, for not maintaining the charter and the colony; and (it is
said) that I am as good as banished by yourselves, and that both sides wished
that I might never have landed, that the fire of contention might have had no
stop in burning. Indeed the words have been so sharp between myself and some
lately, that at last I was forced to say, They might well silence all
complaints if I once began to complain^ who was unfortunately fetched and drawn
from my employment, and sent to so vast distance from my family to do your work
of a high and costly nature, for so many days, and weeks, and months together,
and there left to starve, or steal, or beg, or borrow But blessed be God who
gave me favor to borrow one while, and to work another, and thereby to pay ^our
debts there, and to come over with your credit and honor, as an agent from you,
who had in your name grappled with the agents and friends of all your enemies
round about you. I am told that your opposites thought on me, and provided (as
I may say) a sponge to wipe off your scores and debts in England, but that it
was obstructed by yourselves, who rather meditated on means and new agents to
be sent over to cross what Mr. Clarke and I obtained. But gentlemen, blessed be
God who fails not, and blessed be his name for his wonderful PROVIDENCE by
which alone this town and colony, and that grand cause of TRUTH AND FREEDOM OF
CONSCIENCE has been uph^l^^ to this day. And blessed be his name who has
again quenched so much of our fires hitherto, and has brought your names, and
his own name thus far out of the dirt of scorn, reproach, etc. I ^ind among
yourselves and your opposites that of Solomon true, that the contentions of
brethren (some that lately were so) are the bars of a castle, and not easily
broken; and I have heard some of both sides zealously talking of undoing
themselves by a trial in England. Truly friends I cannot but fear you lost a
fair wind lately, when this town was sent to for its deputies, and you were not
pleased to give an overture unto the rest of the inhabitants about it; yea, and
when yourselves thought that I invited you to some conference tending to
reconciliation, before the town should act in so fundamental a business, you
were pleased to forestal that, so that being full of grief, shame and
astonishment; yea, and fear that all that is now done (especially in our town
of Providence) is but provoking the spirits of men to fury of desparation. I
pray your leave to pray you to remember (that which (...) lately told your
opposites) Only by pride comes contention. If there be humility on the one
side, yet there is pride on the other, and certainly the eternal God will
engage against the proud; I therefore pray you to examine, as I have done them,
your proceedings in this first particular. Secondly, Love covers a multitude
of sins. Surely your charges and complaints each against other have not hid nor
covered any thing, as we use to cover the nakedness of those we love. If you
will now profess not to have disfranchised humanity and love, but that (as
David in another case) you will sacrifice to the common peace, and common
safety, and common credit, that which may be said to cost you something, I pray
your loving leave to tell you that if I were in your souls case, I would send
unto your opposites such a line as this. -- "Neighbors, at the constant
request, and upon the constant mediation which our neighbor Roger Williams,
since his arrival, has used to us, both for pacification and accommodation of
our sad differences, and also upon the late endeavors in all the other towns
for an union, we are persuaded to remove our obstruction, viz. that paper of
contention between us, and to deliver it into the hands of our aforesaid
neighbor, and to obliterate that order which that paper did occasion: This
removed, you may be pleased to meet with, and debate freely, and vote in all
matters with us as if such grievances had not been amongst us. Secondly, If yet
ought remain grievous which we ourselves by free debate and conference cannot
compose, we offer to be judged and censured by four men, which out of any part
of the colony you shall choose two, and we the other."

GENTLEMEN, I only add, that I crave your loving pardon to your bold but true
friend, ROGER WILLIAMS."


THIS address had the desired effect; and when the town came together, and Mr
Williams had a full hearing of the case, he, in the name of the town, drew an
answer to Sir Henry Vane's letter, on August 27th, 16, 4, which now remains on
record in his own hand writing as follows:

"SIR,
ALTHOUGH we are agrieved at your late retirement from the helm of public
affairs, yet we rejoice to reap the sweet fruits of your rest in your pious and
loving lines, most seasonably sent unto us. Thus the sun when he retires his
brightness from the world, yet from under the very clouds we perceive his
persence, and enjoy some light and heat, and sweet refreshings. Sir, your
letters were directed to all and every particular town of this Providence
colony. Surely Sir, among the many providence of the most High, toward this
town of Providence, and this Providence colony, we cannot but see apparently
his gracious hand, providing your honorable self for so noble and true a friend
to an outcast and despised people. From the first beginning of this Providence
colony, (occasioned by the banishment of some in this place from the
Massachusetts) we say ever since to this very day, we have reaped the sweet
fruits of your constant loving kindness and favor toward us. Oh Sir! whence
then is it that you have bent your bow, and shot your sharp and bitter arrows
now against us? Whence is it that you charge us with divisions, disorders,
etc.? Sir, we humbly pray your gentle acceptance of our two fold answer.

"FIRST, we have been greatly disturbed and distracted by the ambition and
covetousness of some amongst ourselves. Sir we were in complete order until
Mr. Coddington (wanting that public selfdenying spirit which you commend to us
in your letter) procured, by most untrue information, a monopoly of part of the
colony, viz. Rhode Island to himself, and so occasioned our general disturbance
and distractions. Secondly, Mr. Dyre, with no less want of a public spirit,
being ruined by party contentions with Mr. Coddington, and being betrusted to
bring from England the letters of the council of state for our re-unitings, he
hopes for a recruit to himself by other men's goods; and (contrary to the
states intentions and expressions) plungeth himself and some others, in most
unnecessary and unrighteous plundering, both of Duch and French, and English
also, to our great grief, who protested against such abuse of our power from
England; and the end of it is to the shame and reproach of himself, and the
very English name, as all these parts do witness."

"SIR, our second answer is (that we may not lay all the load upon other men's
backs) that possibly a sweet cup has rendered many of us wanton and too
active: for we have long drunk of the cup of as great liberties as any people
that we can hear of under the whole heaven. We have not only been long free
(together with all New England) from the iron yoke of wolvish bishops, and
their popish ceremonies (against whose cruel oppressions God raised up your
noble spirit in parliament) When those cruel oppressors had regained their
power in 1662, so as to eject 2000 protestant teachers out of their places,
they wreaked their vengeance on this noble man, so as to have him publicly
beheaded: but he died in an heroic manner.
but we have sitten quiet and dry, from the streams of blood spilt by that war
in our native country. We have not felt the new chains of the presbyterian
tyrants, nor in this colony, have we been consumed with the over-zealous fire
of the (so called) godly christian magistrates. Sir, we have not known what an
excise means; we have almost forgot what tithes are, yea, or taxes either, to
church or common wealth. We could name other special privileges, ingredients of
our sweet cup, which your great wisdom knows to be very powerful (except more
than ordinary watchfulness) to render the best of men wanton and forgetful. But
blessed be your love, and your loving heart and hand, awakening any of our
sleepy spirits by your sweet alarm; and blessed be your noble family, root and
bra^^h, and all your pious and prudent engagements and retirements. We hope you
shall no more complain of the sadning of your loving heart, by the men of
Providence town or Providence colony, but that when we are gone, and rotten,
our posterity and children after us shall read in our town records, your pious
and favorable letters and loving kindness to us, and this our answer, and real
endeavor after peace and righteousness; and to be found Sir, your most
obliged, and most humble servants, the town of Providence, in Providence colony
in New England,

GREGORY DEXTER, Town Clerk."


THEY chose commissioners, who met with those from the other towns on Agust 31:
when they agreed that the affairs that had been transacted by authority in each
town should remain till further orders; and that for the future their
government should be managed acccording to their charter; and that an assembly
of six commissioners from each town, should transact the business of making
laws, and trying their general affairs, and they ordered, "That Mr. Ezekiel
Holiman, and Mr. John Green, jun'r, are to view the general laws of the
colony, and to represent them to the next court of commissioners." And they
appointed a general election at Warwick on Sept. 12. Providence Records. -- The
names of the commissioners who composed and signed this amicable settlement
were, Thomas Ha^is, Gregory Dexter, John Sails, William Wickerden, John Brown
and Henry Brown, for Providence; William Baulston, John Ro^me, Thomas Cornell,
John Briggs and William Hall, for Po^^m^^uth; Benedict Arnold, Richard Jew,
John Coggshall, John Easton, William Lytherland and Thomas Gould, for Newport;
John G^^ene senior, Randal Holden, Ezekiel Holiman, John Green, jun. John
Townsend, for Warwick. Arnold left his father's p^^ty^^^ Pawtuxet and was
received a freeman at Newport in May 1653; after which he was greatly
proa^^^ed^ (...).
At that election Mr. Williams was chosen president of the colony; and the
assembly ordered, "That Mr. Roger Williams, and Mr. Gregory Dexter draw forth
and send letters of humble thanksgiving, to his Highness the Lord Pro^^^tor,
and Sir Henry Vane, Mr. Holland, and Mr. John Clarke, in the name of the
colony, and Mr. Williams is desired to subscribe them by virtue of his office."
Thus far things appeared encouraging; but as tyranny and licentiousness are
equally enemies, both to government and liberty, Mr. Williams often had both of
them to conflict with. Soon after this settlement a person sent a paper to the
town of Providence, That it was blood guiltness, and against the rule of the
gospel, to execute judgment upon transgressors, against the private or public
weal. But said Mr. Williams, "That ever I should speak or write a tiltle that
tends to such an infinite liberty of conscience is a mistake, and which I have
ever disclaimed and abhorred. To prevent such mistakes, I at present shall only
propose this case. There goes many a ship to sea, with many hundred souls in
one ship, whose weal and woe is common; and is a true picture of a
commonwealth, or an human combination, or society. It has fallen out some
times that both Papists and Protestants, Jews and Turks may be embarked into
one ship. Upon which supposal, I affirm that all the liberty of conscience,
that ever I pleaded for, turns upon these two hinges, That none of the Papists,
Protestants, Jews or Turks, be forced to come to the ship's prayers or worship;
nor compelled from their own particular prayers or worship, if they practice
any. I further add, that I never denied, that notwithstanding this liberty, the
commander of this ship ought to command the ship's course; yea, and also
command that justice, peace and sobriety to be kept and practiced, both among
the seamen and all the passengers. If any of the seamen refuse to perform their
service, or passenger to pay their freight; if any refuse to help in person or
purse, toward the common charges or defense; if any refuse to obey the common
laws and orders of the ship, concerning their commong peace or preservation; if
any shall mutiny and rise up against their commanders and officers; if any
should preach or write, that there ought to be no commanders nor officers,
because all are equal in Christ, therefore no masters nor officers, no laws nor
orders, no corrections nor punishments; I say, I never denied but in such
cases, whatever is pretended, the commander or commanders may judge, resist,
compel and punish such transgressors, according to their deserts and merits.
This if seriously and honestly minded, may if it so please the Father of
lights, let in some (...) to such as willingly shut not their eyes. I remain
studious of your common peace and liberty.

ROGER WILLIAMS." History of Providence.


THIS clear description of the difference between civil and ecclesiastical
affairs, and of the ^^derence betwixt good government on the one ha^^d, and
tyranny or licentiousness on the other, confirmed by a correspondant practice
through fi^^y years of incessant labors, are more than a sufficient balance to
all the slanders that various parties have cast upon this ancient witness and
advocate for the rights and liberties of men, against the superstitions and
enthuseasms of his day. Having settled things as well as he could among his own
people, he as presdent of his colony, addressed the general assembly at Boston,
in the following words, directed to their governor.

"Providence 15. 9 month 55 (so called.) Much honored Sir,
IT is my humble and earnest petition unto God any you, that you may be so
pleased to exercise command over your own spirits that you may not mind myself
nor the English of these parts, (unworthy with myself of your eye) but only
that face of equity (English and Christian) which I humbly hope may appear in
these representations following.

"FIRST, May it please you to remember, that concerning the town of Warwick,
there lies a suit of 2000 l. damages against you before his highness and the
lord of the council. I doubt not, if you so please, but that (as Mr. Winslow
and myself had well nigh ordered it) some gentlemen from yourselves and some
from Warwick deputed, may friendly and easily determine that affair between
you. Thus it appears that their invading their neighbors rights at Warwick,
caused troubles for them in England above ten years after, which Mr. Winslow
their agent, and Mr. Williams could not quite settle; and they not complying
with his reasonable proposal now, Gorton entered a complaint against them
before king Charles's commissioners in 1605, in which besides all their other
sufferings, they alleged that the Massachusetts took away and sold eighty head
of their cattle, Massachusetts history vol. 1. page 123.

The controversy not being then settled, drew consequences after it enough to
make our ears to tingle; an account of which I perceive was pres^n^ed to king
Charles the second, in 1679, by Randal Holden and others, as agents from
Warwick, wherein they. after describing their suffering at Boston, say, "and
all this because that we (being without their jurisdiction) would not
relinquish and forsake the sound doctrine and christian principles taught us in
our minority in the church of England" Upon which they go on to relate how that
party disposition against them, after exasperating the Narragansets in Philip's
war, lest Warwick defenseless to the fury of the savages; and that the English
themselves did them other great injuries afterward. How should these things
warn all to leave off contention before it is meddled with!




"SECONDLY, The Indians which pretend your name at Warwick and Pawtuxet (yet
live as barberously if not more than any in the whole colony) please you to
^now their insolences upon ourselves and cattle (unto 20 l. damages per annum)
are insu^ferable by English spirits; and please you to give credance that to
all these they pretend your name, and affirm that they do not (for offending
you) agree with us, nor come to rules of righteous neighborhood, only they know
you favor us not, and therefore send us for redress unto you.

"THIRDLY, Concerning four families at Pawtuxet, may it please you to remember
the two controversies they have long (under your name) maintained with us, to
the constant obstructing of all order and authority amongst us. -- To obey his
highnesses authority in this charter, they say they dare not for your sakes,
though they live not by your laws, nor by your common charges, nor ours, but
evade both under color of your authority. -- Be pleased to consider how
unsuitable it is for yourselves to be the obstructors of all orderly
proceedings amongst us; for I humbly appeal to your own wisdoms and experience,
how unlikely it is for a people to be compelled to order and common charges,
when others in their bosoms are by such (seeming) partiality exempted from
both."

HE then observes, that there were in reality only W. Arnold and W. Carpenter,
"very far in religion from you, if you knew all," who continued this
obstruction; and all their plea for it was a fear of offending the
Massachusetts. And says he, "I conceive your commerce with the people of this
colony is as great as with any in the country, and our dangers (being a
frontier people to the barbarians) When Mr. Williams first began among the
Narragansets, he said they had 5000 fighting men. Callendar, page 70.
are greater than those of other colonies, and the ill consequences to
yourselves would be not few nor small, and to the whole land, were we first
massacred or mastered by them. I pray your equal and favorable reflection upon
that your law, which prohibits us to buy of you all means of our necessary
defense, of our lives and families; yea, in this bloody and massacreing time.
We are informed that tickets have rarely been denied to any English of the
country; yea, the barbarians, though notorious in lies, if they profess
subjection, they are furnished: [See page 125.] only ourselves, by former and
latter denial, seem to be devoted to be the Indian-shambles and massacres. The
barbarians all the land over are filled with artillery and ammunition from the
Dutch, openly and horridly, and from the English all over the country, by
stealth, I know they abound so wonderfully, that their activity and insolences
is grown so high, that they daily consult and hope and threaten to render us
slaves, as they long since have made the Dutch. For myself, as through God's
goodness, I have refused the gain of thousands by such a murderous trade, and
think no law yet extant among yourselves or us, secure enough against such
villainy; so am I loath to see so many hundred, if not some thousands, in this
colony destroyed like fools and beasts without resistance. I grieve that so
much blood should cry against yourselves; yea, and I grieve, that at this
instant by these ships, this cry and the premisis should now trouble his
highness and his council. For the seasonable preventing of which is this humble
address presented to your wisdom, by him who desires to be your unfeigned and
faithful servant,

ROGER WILLIAMS, Of Providence-Plantations, president."


HE then requested them to record an order which the lords of the council gave
him upon his last return from England, for his free taking of ship or landing
at their ports, least, says he, "forgetfulness hereafter again put me upon such
distresses as, God knows, I suffered when I last passed through your colony to
our native country." Massachusetts history vol. 3. page 275 -- 278. -- This
year the church of Charlestown began their dealings with Mr. Gould, which
Issued in his gathering the first baptist church in Boston.


THE above were not all the trying things that he met with this year. No, Mr.
William Harris, to whom he generously gave a share in Providence lands, and who
had professed himself a baptist, " sent his writings to the main and to the
island, against all earthly powers, parliaments, laws, charters, magistrates,
prisons, punishments, rates, yea, against all kings and princes, under the
notion that the people should shortly cry out, No lords, no masters; and in
open court protested, before the whole colony assembly, that he would maintain
his writings with his blood!" This was done at the election at Newport, May
22d, 1655. Upon which the assembly appointed Messrs. Olney, Baulston and Room,
to deal with him; and Mr Williams soon after received the following letter from
the lord protector, viz.

"GENTLEMEN,
YOUR agent here has represented unto us some particulars concerning your
government, which you judge necessary to be settled by us here, but by reason
of the other great and weighty affairs of this common wealth, we have been
necessitated to defer the consideration of them to further opportunity; in the
mean time we are willing to let you know, that you were to proceed in your
government according to the tenor of your charter, formerly granted on that
behalf, taking care of the peace and safety of those plantations, that neither
through intestine commotions or foreign invasions, there do arise any detriment
or dishonor to their commonwealth or yourselves, as far as you by your care
and diligence can prevent. And as for the things that are before us, they
shall, as soon as the other occasions will permit, receive a just and
sufficient determination. And so we bid you farewell and rest,

Your very loving friend, OLIVER, P."
March 29th, 1655.

To our trusty and well-beloved, the president, assistant, and inhabitant of
Rhode Island, together with Narraganset-Bay, in New England.

HEREUPON the assembly met again, June 28th, and enacted that, "Whereas we have
been rent and torn with divisions, and his highness has sent unto us an
express command, under his hand and seal, to provide against intestine
commotions, by which his highness notes, that not only ourselves are
dishonored and endangered, but also dishonor and detriment redounds to the
commonwealth of England: It is ordered, that if any person or persons be
found, by the examination and judgment of the general court of commissioners,
to be a ringleader or ringleaders of factions or divisions among us, he or
they shall be sent over at his or their own charges, as prisoners, to receive
his or their trial or sentence at the pleasure of his highness and the lords of
his council." These means had such effect, that at their assembly at Warwick,
in March following I find it thus recorded.

"I WILLIAM CODDINGTON do freely submit to the authority of his highness in the
colony as it is now united, and that with all my heart.

"WHEREAS there have been differences depending between William Coddington,
Esquire; and Mr. William Dyre, both of Newport, we declare joyfully for ourselves
and heirs by this present record, that a full agreeement and conclusion is made
between us, by our worthy friends, Mr. Baulston, Mr. Gorton, Mr. John Smith of
Warwick, Mr. John Green, jun. of Warwick, and Mr. John Easton; and in witness
whereof we subscribe our hands, and desire this to be recorded, this present
14th of March, 1655, 1656.

In the presence of Roger Williams, president, John Room, Benedict Arnold,
John Green, jun. William Coddington. William Dyre."


AND Harris now turned, and cried up government and magistrates as much as he
had cried them down before. Rhode Island Colony records. -- Williams against
the Quakers, page 11 -- 20.
And being desirous to make thorough work of it, Mr. Williams wrote again to
the Massachusetts governor, and was encouraged by him to come to their assembly
at Boston, which he did, with an address, dated May 12th, wherein he says,
"Honored Sirs, our first request was and is, for your favorable consideration
of the long and lamentable condition of the town of Warwick, which has been
thus. They are so dangerously and so vexatiously intermingled with the
barbarians, that I have long admired the wonderful power of God in restraining
and preventing very great sires, of mutual slaughters, breaking forth between
them. Your wisdoms know the inhuman insultations of these wild creatures, and
you may be pleased also to imagine, that they have not been spareing of your
name as the patron of all their wickedness against our Englishmen, women and
children, and cattle, to the yearly damage of 60, 80 and 100 l. The remedy,
under God is only your pleasure that Pumham shall come to an agreement with the
town or colony, and that some convenient way and time be set for their removal.
And that your wisdoms may see just grounds for such your willingness, be
pleased to be informed of a reality of a solemn covenant between this town of
Warwick and Pumham, unto which, notwithstanding he pleads his being drawn to it
by the awe of his superior sachems, yet I humbly offer that what was done was
according to the law and tenor of the natives (I take it) in all New England
and America, viz. that the inferior sachems and subjects shall plant and remove
at the pleasure of the highest and supreme sachems, and I humbly conceive that
it pleases the most High and only wise to make use of such a bond of authority
over them, without which they could not long subsist in human societies, in
this wild condition wherein they are. Please you not to be insensable of the
slipery and dangerous condition of this their intermingled co-habitation. I am
humbly confident, that all the English towns and plantations in all New England
put together, suffer not such molestation from the natives as this one town and
people. -- Be pleased to review this copy from the lord admiral [See p. 197.]
that this English town of Warwick should proceed, and that if any of yours were
there planted, they should by your authority be removed, And if the English,
whose removes are difficuit and chargeable, how much more these wild ones, who
remove with little more trouble and damage than the wild beasts of the
wilderness? -- This small neck, where, on they keep and mingle fields with the
English, is a very den of wickedness, where they not only practice the horrid
barbarisms of all kinds of whore, doms, idolatries and conjurations, but living
without all exercise of actual authority, and ge^^^ng ^ore of liquors (to our
grief) there is a con^^uence and rendezvous of all the wildest and most
licentious natives and practices of the whole country." He then proceeded to
inculcate his other former requests, which now had their effect. Massachus^tts
history, vol. 3. page 2^8 -- 283.


THE journal of governor Winthrop shows, that before they received Pumham and
his fellows under their protection, the court made them promise to ^^^^p the
sabbath, and to observe oath religious ru^^^; but this account manifest the
pernic^ us evil or invading others rights under the mask of religion; and they
were awfully requited therefore. Beside the manifold troubles that it cost the
Massachusetts before, in Philip's war; they not only "lost more of their
substance as well as inhabitants than both Plymouth and Connecticut colonies
together." M^ss^chusetts history, vol. 3. page 4^3.
But Pumham and his family had so great a hand therein, that the dispatching of
a gran^^ion of his is mentioned among the her^ic exploit of Captain De^i on,
nine months after that war began; and Pumham himself was "accounted the most
warlike and best soldier of all the Narragans^t sachems;" and he was so bloody
and barbar^^^s through the war, that when he was killed a f^^ days before I
Philip, within about fifteen or twenty miles of Boston, he, after he could not
^^^^d "catching hold of an Englishman, that by accident came near him, had done
him a mischief, if he had not been presently rescued." H^bbard's history of
that war, page 68 -- 102.


No sooner had Mr. Williams obtained such a settlement of old controversies in
the country but new ones arose in the following manner. George Fox a very
zealous teacher, had raised a new sect in England, who from his, and his
friends companions quaking and trembling when they were brought before Gervase
Bennet, a justice in Derby, in 1650, were called QUAKERS; though Fox says it
was because, "we bid him and his company tremble at the word of God." William's
dispute with them, p. 27. Fox's answer, p. 20.
In July (this year) a number of his followers arrived at Boston, but were soon
imprisoned. Mr. Gorton wrote to them as I have related page 130, to which they
gave an answer Sept. 28th, wherein they say, "Friend, in that measure which we
have received, which is eternal, we see thee, and behold thee, and have access
with thee, in that which is meek and low, and is not of this world -- and in
that meek and low spirit we salute thee, and own that of God in thee which is
waiting for, and expecting the rising of that which is under the earth -- the
ransomed of the Lord shall come to Zion with joy and gladness, being redeemed
from kindreds, nations, tongues and people, by the blood of Jesus, which is
spirit and life to all those that obey the light, which from the life does
come, for the life is the light of men, and whosoever believes in the light
which they are enlightened with, shall not abide in darkness, which light we
have obeyed in coming into these parts. The Lord is come and coming, to level
the mountains, and to rend the rocks of wisdom and knowledge, and to exalt that
which is low and foolish to the wisdom of the world, and blessed shall thou,
and all those be, who meets him in this his work. From the servants and
messengers of the Lord whom he has sent and brought by the arm of his power
into these parts of the world, for which we suffer bonds and close
imprisonment. -- Known in the world by these names.

Christopher Holden, William Brend, John Copeland, Thomas Thurston,"
To this Gorton wrote a reply recited in page 132, 133, and thereby as well as
by what is in page 141, 142, we may learn that he held with them about inward
power, perfection in this life, and falling from grace received; but when he
came to be acquainted with them, he did not concur with them about thee and
thou, and the names of months and days, nor in the more important articles of
refusing the oath of alliegance to civil government, and a defensive war. After
his return from England, his character as a member of civil society, and as a
ruler, stands unimpeached in their records. And as Fox in his book in folio had
said, "The scriptures are the words of God, but Christ is the word of God in
whom they end. And it is not blasphemy [as an author said it was] to say the
soul is part of God, for it comes out of him, and rejoiceth in him:" which John
Stubs tried to defend against Mr. Williams, from those words, God breathed into
man the breath of lif^; Gorton, desiring liberty to speak, said, "If it be
affirmed that God can be divided, and that man was a part of God the Godhead
was destroyed, and the soul of man. -- It is in the margin, the breath of
lives, which Stubs acknowledged." Williams 1672, page 144, 145.


ON September 2d, 1656, the assembly at Boston, wrote to the commissioners of
the united colonies, and said, "Having heard sometime since, that our neighbor
colony of Plymouth, our beloved brethren in a great part seem to be wanting to
themselves, in a due acknowledgment and encouragement to the ministry of the
gospel, so as many pious ministers (how justly we know not) have deserted their
stations, callings and relations; our desire is, that some such course may be
taken, as that a pious orthodox ministry may be restated among them, that so
the flood of errors and principles of anarchy, may be prevented. Here have
arrived amongst us several presons, professing themselves Quakers, fit
instruments to propagate the kingdom of Satan: for the securing of ourselves
and our neighbors from such pests we have imprisoned them till they be
dispatched away to the place from whence they came -- we hope that some general
rules may be commended to each general court, to prevent the coming amongst us,
from foreign places such notorious heretics as quakers, ranters, etc.

THE commissioners having considered the premises, cannot but acknowledge the
godly care and zeal of the gentlemen of the Massachusetts, to uphold and
maintain those professed ends of coming into these parts, and of combination of
the united colonies, which if not attended in particulars aforesaid will be
rendered wholly frustrate, our profession miserably scandelized, ourselves
become a reproach in the eyes of those that cannot without admiration behold
our sudden defection from our first principles." From whence they went on to
inculcate what the Massachusetts had proposed. Massachusetts history, vol. 3,
page 283 -- 285.


THOUGH the Massachusett rulers knew not whether those ministers had deserted
their stations justly or not, yet they had approved of the settlement of Mr.
John Mayo in Boston, Mr. Edward Bulkley at Concord, Mr. John Reyner at Dover
(who preached in Boston, the winter after he left Plymouth) Mr. Richard
Blinman, at Cape-Ann, etc. all of whom were ministers in Plymouth colony, when
the colonies confederated together in 1643. We learn also that Mr. John Norton
arrived at Plymouth in 1635, where he preached the following winter, and Mr.
Smith their pastor resigned his place to him, "and the church used him with all
respect, and large offers, yet he left them -- alleging that his spirit could
not unite with him." Winthrop -- Hubbard.
He went and settled at Ipswich, but after Mr. Cotton's death removed and took
his place in Boston, where he with his colleague had not a little hand in
spiriting up others to the above described meannes. Another vigorous hand in
the same work was Mr. Cobbet, who arrived at Boston in 1637, wrote against the
baptists in 1645, was minister at Lynn, when they suffered there in 1651, but
upon the death of Mr. Nathaniel Rogers took his place at ^pswich. where the
town on Feb. 25, this year voted to give him an 100 l. to buy or build him a
house, and taxed all the inhabitants to pay it. This being a new thing with
them, several persons would not comply with the scheme: Therefore desiress was
made upon them in 1657. Samuel Symonds. Esquire; descended from an ancient and
honorable family in ^^ssex in England, was then one of the Massachusetts
magistrates, and at last died their deputy governor. Before him George Giddings
prosecuted Edward Brown, for seizing his pewter for said tax: The justice gave
the plantif damage and costs, for which judgment he rendered these reasons; "I
understand this to be about a fundamental law: -- Such a law as that God and
nature has given to a people; so that it is in the trust of their governors in
highest place and others, to preserve, but not in their power to take away from
them. Of this sort are these, viz. 1. Election of the supreme governors. 2.
That every subject shall and may enjoy what he has a civil right unto, so as
it cannot be taken from him, by way of gift or loan, to the use or to be made
the right or property of another man, without his own free consent. 3. That
such laws, (though called liberties) yet more properly may be called rights,
and in this sense this may be added, as a third fundamental law, viz. That no
custom or precedent ought to prevail in any moral case, that may appear to be
sinful in respect of the breach of anylaw of piety against the first table, or
of righteousness against the second. -- I shall add -- that it is against a
fundamental law in nature, to be comp^^led to pay that which others do give;
for then no man has any certainty, or right to what he has; if it be in the
power of others by pretense of authority or without, to give it away (when in
their prudence they conceive it to be for the benefit of the owner) without his
own consent. -- The parliament may tax, and that justly, the whole country to
give a reward to one man for some service, for they are betrusted so to do. The
reason is, it is levied upon the whole country, with their consent, and for the
immediate benefit of the whole. But if they should do it between persons
(though they should do it by power, and the person arranged has no remedy in
this world) yet it would be accounted TYRANNY. Is it not to take from Peter and
give unto Paul?" Then after mentioning the law for ministers saleries in page
98, he says, "yet the law was framed so, as such churches as chose to go in a
voluntary way of weekly contribution, might so continue, as some churches in
the country do to this day." After an appeal to the county court the question,
with the reasons each party had for and against it, was put to the general
court, whether the town vote for giving the said 100 l. bo^^^ the inhabitants,
so that any of them who were unwilling, might be compelled to pay it, or not?
On October 20th, 1657, the deputies resolved it in the negative, which was
non-concurred by the council; and influence enough was made the next day to
bring a majority of the house round to the compelling side. Massachusetts
history, vol 3. page 287 -- 308. -- So in October 1658 the majority of the
house were against the law, to banish Quakers on pain of death; but the
council, with the help of some ministers, at last prevailed to carry it, by the
majority of only one vote; which, when deacon Wozel [or Wisw^d] understood he
went, and though illness caused his ^^scence, yet had notice been given him he
said, "if be had not been able to go, he would have crept upon his hands and
knees, rather than it should have been" Thus those oppressions were carried on
by a few men, against the sense of the best part of the community. End^cot,
Bellingham, Bradstreet and D^ni^on, with the ministers they s^^ under, were as
guilty in this respect as any. Bishop's New England judged. Massachusetts
history, vol. 1. p. 198.


N^^THER could they be content with using compulsion themselves, but the
commissioners of the united colonies, wrote to that of Providence, Sept. 25,
1656, to try draw them into their measures toward the Quakers. To this the
assembly at Portsmouth gave an answer, on March 13th, 1657, wherein they say,
"Whereas freedom of different consciences to be protected from inforcements was
the principal ground of our charter, both with respect to our humble suit for
it, as also to the true intent of the honorable and renowned parliament of
England, in granting of the same to us, which freedom we still prize, as the
greatest happiness that men can possess in this world, therefore we shall for
the preservation of our civil peace and order, the more especially take notice
that those people, and any others that are here, or shall come among us, be
impartially required, and to our utmost, constrained to perform all civil
duties requisite. -- And in case they refuse it, we resolve to make use of the
first opportunity to inform our agent, residing in England," etc. They close
with thankful acknowledgements of the commissioners care they had expressed for
the peace and welfare of the whole country, and saying, "we rest yours, most
affectionately, desirous of your honorable welfare.

JOHN SANFORD, Clerk of Assembly."

THIS did not content those commissioners; but they wrote again the next fall,
to which governor Arnold, and his court returned an answer, October 13th, which
has been published. Massachusetts history, vol. 1. page 526, 527.
And the contention growing more terrible the year after, the assembly at
Warwick, Nov. 5th, 1658, appointed Mr. Olney, Mr. Gorton and Mr. Crandal, who
had suffered from them at Boston, with Mr. Trip, to draw a letter to their
agent in England, which is as follows:

"Worthy Sir, and trusty friend, Mr. Clarke,
WE have found, not only your ability and diligence, but also your love and
care to be such concerning the welfare and prosperity of this colony, since you
have been entrusted with the more public affairs thereof, surpassing the no
small benefit which we had of your presence here at home, that we in all
straits and encumbrances, are emboldned to repair unto you, for further and
continued care, counsel and help, finding that your solid and christian
demeanor has gotten no small interest in the hearts of our superiors, those
noble and worthy senators, with whom you had to do in our behalf, as it has
constantly appeared in our addresses made unto them, we have by good and
comfortable proofs found, having plentiful experience thereof. The last year we
had laden you with much employment, which we were then put upon by reason of
some too refractory among ourselves, wherein we appealed unto you for advice,
for the more public manifestation of it, with respect to our superiors; but our
intelligence fell short in that great loss of the ship, which we concluded here
to be cast away. We have now a new occasion given us by an old spirit, with
respect to the colonies round about us, who seem to be offended with us because
a sort of people, called by the name of Quakers, who are come amongst us, who
have raised up diverse who at present seem to be of their spirit, where at the
colonies about us seem to be offended with us, being the said people have their
liberty with us, are entertained in our houses, or any of our assemblies; and
for the present we have found no just cause to charge them with the breach of
the civil peace; only they are constantly going forth amongst them about us,
and vex and trouble them about their religion and spiritual state, though they
return with many a foul scar in their bodies for the same. Many were whipped,
some were branded, and Holder, C^peland and Rouse, three single young men, had
each his right ear cut off in the prison at Boston, the 16th of September this
year. Grove's abridgment of Bishop, page 64, 91, 92.
And the offense our neighbors take against us, is because we take not some
course against the said people, either to expel them from amongst us, or take
such courses against them as themselves do, who are in fear least their
religion should be corrupted by them. Concerning which displeasure that they
seem to take, it was expressed to us in a solemn letter, written by the
commissioners of the united colonies at their sitting, as though they would
either bring us in to act according to their scantling, or else take some
course to do us a greater displeasure. A copy of which letter we have herewith
sent unto you, wherein you may perceive how they express themselves; as also we
have herewith sent our present answer unto them, to give you what light we may
in the matter. There is one clause in the letter which plainly implies a
threat, though courtly expressed as their manner is; which we gather to be
this, that themselves (as we construe it) have been much awed in point of
continued subjection to the state of England, left in case they should decline,
England might prohibit all trade with them, both in point of exportation and
importation of any commodities, which were an host sufficiently prevalent to
subdue New England, not being able to subsist: even so they seem to threaten
us, by cutting us off from all commerce and trade with them, and thereby to
disable us of any comfortable subsistence, being that the concourse of shiping,
and all other sorts of commodities are universally conversant among themselves;
as also knowing that ourselves are not in a capacity to send out shiping of
ourselves, which in great measure is occasioned by their oppressing of us, as
yourself well knows: as in many other respects so in this for one, that we
cannot have any thing from them, for the supply of our necessities, but in
effect they make the price, both of our commodities and their own. Also,
because we have no English coin, but only that which passes among these
barbarians, and such commodities as are raised by the labor of our hands, as
corn, cattle, tobacco, etc. to make payment in, which they will have at their
own rates, or else not deal with us; whereby, though they gain extraordinarily by
us, yet for the safeguard of their religion, they may seem to neglect
themselves in that respect; for What will not men do for their God? Sir, this
is our earnest and pressing request unto you in this matter, that as you may
perceive by our answer unto the united colonies, we fly as our refuge in all
civil respects to his highness and honorable council, as not being subject to
any other in matters of our civil state, so may it please you to have an eye
and ear open, in case our adversaries should speak, to undermine us in our
privileges granted unto us, and plead our cause in such sort, as that we may
not be compelled to exercise any civil power over men's consciences, so long as
human orders in point of civility are not corrupted and violated, which our
neighbors about us do frequently practice, whereof many of us have absolute
experience, and judge it to be no less than a point of ABSOLUTE CRUELTY.

JOHN SANFORD, Clerk of Assembly." As Oliver Cromwell died Sept. 3, 1653, and
his son Richard was chosen protector in his stead, their assembly of May 17.
1659, sent an address to him, wherein they say, "May it please your highness to
know, that this poor colony of Providence plantations, mostly consists of a
birth and breeding of the providence of the Most High, we being an out cast
people, formerly from our mother nation in the bishops days, and since from the
New-English over-zealous colonies; our whole frame being like unto the present
frame and constitution of our dearest mother England; bearing with the several
judgments and conscience, each of other in all the towns of our colony, which
our neighbor colonies do not, which is the only cause of their great offense.
Against us. -- Sir, we dare not interrupt your high assails with the
part^^^lars of our wilderness condition, only beg your eye of favor to be cast
upon our faithful agent, Mr. John Clarke, and unto what humble addresses he
shall at any time present your ^^ghness with in our behalf." Colony records.



THE commissioners of the colonies who met at Boston, September 2, 1658, and
continued their meeting to the 23d, closed their acts with saying, "Whereas
there is an accursed and pernicious sect of heretics, lately risen up in the
world, who are commonly called Quakers, who take upon them to be immediately
sent of God, and infalliably assisted, who do speak and write blasphemous
things, dispising government, and the order of God in church and commonwealth;
speaking evil of dignities, reproaching and reviling magistrates, and the
ministers of the gospel, seeking to turn the people from the faith, and to gain
proselytes to their pernicious ways: And whereas the several jurisdictions have
made diverse laws to prohibit their coming amongst them; [but they refusing to
obey them, and still making disturbance] it is therefore propounded, and
seriously commended to the several general courts -- to make a law, that all
Quakers formerly convicted and punished as such, shall (if they return again)
be imprisoned, and forthwith banished or expelled out of the said jurisdiction,
under pain of death." All the eight commissioners signed this advice, only the
governor of Connecticut said, "Looking at the last as a query and not an act, I
subscribe, John Winthrop." Records of the United Colonies. -- The other
commissioners (...) and Bradstreet, of Massachusetts; Prince and W^^^^^, of
Plymouth; Taliot, of Connecticut, and New^^^ (...) of (...).
Such a law was made at Boston the next month, but the like was not done in any
of the other colonies. At Plymouth they had prevailed for two years past, with
the majority of the court, to imprison, fine and whip the Quakers, and to send
some of them out of the colony; and the manner of their proceedings take
follows:

MR. John Brown, who had long been one of their magistrates, and often a
commissioner for his colony, took a voyage to England. Capt. James Cudworth of
Situate, was a magistrate these two years; and near the beginning of this year
he entertained Copeland and Brend, two of the Quakers, at his house a night or
two, and says, "I thought it better so to do, than with the blind world, to
censure, condemn and rail at them, when they neither saw their persons, nor
knew any of their principles; but the Quakers and myself cannot close in diverse
things; and so I signified to the court, I was no Quaker, but must bear my
testimony against sundry things that they held, as I had occasion and
opportunity. But withal I told them, that as I was no Quaker, so I would be no
persecutor. This spirit worked in those two years that I was of the magistracy;
during which time, I was on sundry occasions forced to declare my dissent, in
sundry actings of that nature; which although I did with all moderation of
expression, together with respect unto the rest, yet it wrought great
disaffection and prejudice against me." A person took pains to go to Marshfield
to procure a warrant to apprehend the Quakers he had entertained, which Mr.
Hatherly understanding said. Mr. Envy has procured this; and in lieu of it,
gave them a pass under his hand, with which they traveled to Plymouth; but
were there seized and whipped, by order of three other magistrates. And says,
Captain Cudworth, "Truly the whipping of them with that cruelty as some have
been, and their patience under it, has sometimes been the occasion of gaining
more adherence to them, than if they had suffered them openly to have preached
a sermon. -- The Massachusetts, after they have whipped them, and cut their
ears, they have now gone the farthest step they can, they banish them upon pain
of death, if ever they come there again. We expect we must do the like; we must
dance after their pipe; now Plymouth saddle is on the bay-horse, we shall
follow them on the career. -- All these carnal and antichristian ways being not
of God's appointment, effect nothing as to hindering of them in their way or
course. It is only the word and spirit of the Lord, that is able to convince
gainsayers. They are the mighty weapons of the christian warfare, by which
great and mighty things are done and accomplished. -- Our civil powers are so
exercised in things appertaining to the kingdom of Christ, in matters of
religion and conscience, that we can have no time to effect any thing that
tends to the promotion of the civil weal, or prosperity of the place; but now
we must have a state-religion, such as the powers of the world will allow, and
no other; a state-ministry, and a state-way of mainteinance; and we must
worship and serve the Lord Jesus, as the world shall appoint us. We must all go
to the public place of meeting, in the parish where we dwell, or be presented.
I am informed of three or fourscore last court, presented for not coming to
public meetings; and let me tell you how they brought this about. You may
remember a law once made, called Thomas Hinckley's law, That if any neglected
the worship of God, in the place where he lives, and set up a worship contrary
to God, and the allowance of this government, to the public profanation of
God's holy day and ordinance, shall pay ten shillings. This law would not reach
what then was aimed at; because he must do so and so; that is, all things
therein expressed, or else break not the law. In March last, a court of
deputies was called, and some acts touching Quakers were made; and then they
contrived to make this law serviceable to them; and that was by putting out the
word and, and putting in the w^^d or, which is a disjunctive, and makes every
branch become a law. So now, if any neglect, or will not come to the public
meetings ten shillings for every defect. -- And these men altering this law
last March, yet left it dated, June 6th, 1681, [See page 214] and so it stands
as the act of a general court; they to be the authors of it seven years before
it was in being; and so yourselves have your part and share in it, it the
records lie not. But what may be the reason that they should not by another
law, made and dated by that court, as well effect what was intended, as by
altering a word, and so the whole sense of the law; and leave this their act,
by the date of it, charged on another courts account? Surely, the chief
instruments in the business, being privy to an act of parliament for liberty,
should too openly have acted repugnant to a law of England; but if they can do
the thing, and leave it on a court, as making it six years before the act of
parliament, there can be no danger in this. -- If we can but keep the people
ignorant of their liberties and privileges, then we have liberty to act in our
own wills what we please. -- Through mercy we have yet among us worthy Mr.
DUNSTAR, whom the Lord has made boldly to bear testimony against the spirit of
persecution." These things Capt. Cudworth wrote to Mr. Brown, then in England,
who set Bishop publish them, page 168 -- 176. Morton, says Mr. Dunstar, "was
useful and helping in defending the truth against Quakers; and that he fell
asleep in the Lord, in 1659." After Mr. Brown returned from England, he and
Cudworth were called to account for this letter, but were not punished.
Cudworth was restored to the magistracy in 1674, and died their deputy
governor, in 1681. Plymouth records.


For the above things those two magistrates Hatherly and Cudworth were left out
of all their offices, in June, this year. At the same time it is meet that
posterity should know how those Quakers behaved under their sufferings.
Humphery Norton, one of their teachers and authors, was sent out of Plymouth
colony in 1657, for being an extravagrant person; which charge, says Bishop,
could not be proved. On election day June 1st, 1658, he and John Rouse came
again to Plymouth, and were taken up and whipped, Norton twenty-three lashes, and
Rouse fifteen, which Bishop says, "They received for no other thing but for
coming into that colony in the will of God." New England judged, page 163 --
179.
Though the records inform us, that when they were brought before the assembly
June 3d, Norton "said unto the governor sundry times, Thou lie! and said unto
him, Thomas, thou art a malicious man, etc. And that for these things, and for
refusing the oath of allegiance to any civil government, they were then whipped,
and for officers fees were imprisoned till the tenth, when they were released,
and went to Rhode Island, where on the 16th, Norton wrote a letter to Mr.
Alden, one of their magistrates, and another to the governor, with and answer
to Christopher Winter's deposition against them, all which the court ordered to
be recorded. The beginning and end of that to the governor, I took from thence
with my own hand, which is in the words and letters following:

"THOMAS PRINCE, thou who have bent thy heart to work wickedness, and with thy
tongue have thou set forth deceit; thou imaginest mischief upon thy bed, and
hatchest thy hatred in thy cecrett chamber; the strength of darkness is over
thee, and a malliciouse mouth have thou opened against god and his anointed,
and with thy tongue and lips have thou uttered perverse things; thou have
slaundered the innocent by railing, lying and false accusations, and with thy
barborouse heart have thou caused their blood to be shed. Thou have through
all these things broke and transgresed the laws and ways of God, and equity
is not before thy eyes. The curse causles cannot come upon thee, nor the
vengance of God unjustly cannot fetch thee up; thou make thyself merry with
thy cecrett malice. -- The day of thy wailing will be like unto that of a
woman that murders the fruit of her womb; the anguish and pain that will
enter upon thy reigns will be like knawing worms lodging betwixt thy heart and
liver: When these things come upon thee, and thy back bowed down with pain,
in that day and hour thou shall know to thy grief, that prophetts of the Lord
God we are, and the God of vengance is our God. HUMPHERY NORTON.

"I HAVE sent thee here enclosed a reply to C. Winter's deposition, also i
have sent already a true relation of part of thy proceedings toward London,
with a copy of the fines laid on, and levied of the people of God, with a
copy of thy late laws.

Superscribed, For the governer of Plymouth pattent, this with care and speed."

AFTER this prophecy Mr. Prince continued governor of that colony near fourteen
years, and then died in peace (for ought we know.) His son was a justice of
peace in his day, and his grandson was a learned and pious minister at Boston,
whose writings have furnished many valuable materials for our history. It ought
also to be known, that in reading the works of wisdom and knowledge, and
exalting that which is low -- the Quakers meant to have civil as well as
ecclesiastical government managed by the above described power. For in those
times George Fox published a large book in folio, in the 170th page of which he
said, "The magistrate of Christ, the help government for him, he is in the
light and power of Christ; and he is to subject all under the power of Chirst,
into his light, else he is not a faithful magistrate: and his laws here are not
agreeable, and answerable according to that of God in every man; when men act
contrary to it, they do evil: so he is a terror to evildoers, discerns the
precious and the just from the vile; and this is a praise to them that do
well." And when Mr. Williams mentioned this passage, as one proof, that their
spirit tended to arbitrary government, and fiery persecution, they said upon
it, "Is there one word of persecution here? Or can Roger Williams think himself
a christian, and look upon it to be persecution, for Christ's magistrates by
Christ's light and power, to subject all under the power of Christ, and to
bring all into this light of Christ! Or can he think such an one an unfaithful
magistrate? Or are those laws, and the execution of them persecution, that are
agreeable and answerable to that of God in every man? These are George Fox's
words. Such magistrates, such laws, such power, and light, and subjection, is
G. F. for, and NO OTHER." Williams, page 207. Fox's answer, page 229, 230
This opens the plain cause why they militated so hard against other
magistrates and government, (...) in the lamentable instances following:

OUR Lord directed his disciples to depart from any house or city, that they
should travel into, when they refused to receive them; and when the Gadarenes
besought him to depart out of their coasts, he did so; and we have no account
of his forceing himself upon them again; but the Quakers took another course.
Three of them who were banished, on pain of death, yet returned again to
Boston, and were condemned to die; and William Robinson gave in a paper to the
court, which contains the following reason for his conduct therein, viz. "On
the 8th day of the 8th month, 1659, in the after part of the day, in traveling
betwixt Newport in Rhode Island, and Daniel Gould's house, with my dear brother
Christopher Holder, the word of the Lord came expressly to me, which did fill
me immediately with life and power, and heavenly love, by which he constrained
me, and commanded me to pass to the town of Boston, my life to lay down in his
will, for the accomplishing of his service, that he had there to perform at the
day appointed. To which heavenly voice I presently yielded obedience, not
questioning the Lord how he would bring the thing to pass. -- For the Lord had
said unto me, My soul shall rest in everlasting peace, and my life shall enter
into rest, FOR BEING OBEDIENT to the God of my life." Marmaduke Stevenson, gave
in another paper, informing the court, how he heard a voice as he was plowing
in Yorkshire, saying, I have ^rdained thee a prophet unto the nations; and
after he came to Rhode Island, he says, "The word of the Lord came unto me
saying, Go to Boston, with thy brother William Robinson -- This is given forth
to the upon record, that all people may know, who hear it, that we came not in
our own will, but in the will of God." Bishop, page 127 -- 133.
This was their way of following what they called the light; and the clearest
account of what they meant thereby, that I have seen, is contained in the
following sentences directed to Mr. Williams, viz.

"THOU wrongest the Quakers in saying, they confess their light to be
conscience: In this thou pervertest their words, and thou would have it so;
for George Fox's words are, The light which you call conscience, which is the
light of Christ, as you may see all along in his book. -- Thou have read our
books with an evil eye, or else thou might see how often we mention, that
Christ has bought us with a price, which is his blood; and how that all died
in Adam, and how that Christ died for all, that they that live, might live to
him; and that all might believe in him, who died for them; and if they do not,
they are condemned with the light, which they should believe in. -- Christ
lights every man that comes into the world, Williams, says he, believes Fox,
in his book in folio, repeats these words near or quite a thousand times. Page
186.
with life in him, the word, and says, He is the light of the world, and
says, Believe in the light, that ye may become children of light, and he that
believes is saved, and he that does not is condemned. And the condemnation is
the light that is come into the world; which light, is saving to them that
believe in it, and condemning to them that do not believe in it, but hate it,
whose deeds be evil, John 3." Fox against Williams, second part, Page 4 -- 6 --
10
In all which there is a manifest confounding of grace and works, law and
gospel, which the inspired writers took great pains to keep distinct. And since
Christ himself says, "God sent not HIS SON into the world to condemn the world;
but that the world THROUGH HIM might be saved. Think not that I will accuse you
to the Father; there is one that accuses you, even Moses, IN WHOM YE TRUST."
John 3.17. and 5.45; was not the zeal of these men like that we read of in Romans
10.2 -- 4? Did they not trust in the law instead of the gospel? As to the
person of the Savior, Mr. Williams, says, "Fox in all his book cannot endure
to hear of the word human, as being a new name, and never heard of in scipture.
I said in public, many words truly and properly English, are commendably used
that are not in scripture, in English. The word human comes from the Latin
humanus, signifying pertaining, or belonging to man: So a human soul or body is
such as all mankind have. Hence I told them, that the word anthropinos
peirasmos, 1 Cor. 10. might have been turned human, but is truly turned, no
temptation but such as is common to man. G. Fox knows, that if Christ Jesus be
granted to have had such a soul and body as is human, or common to man, down
falls their monstrous idol of a Christ, called light within." To which Fox
answers, "For thee and the priests to give such names to Christ, our Lord and
Savior, which the scriptures do not give, and yet say the scriptures are the
rule, that is abominable. And there is no such word in 1 Cor. 10. that calls
Christ's body and soul human; and whether is Christ's body celestial or
terrestial, or which glory does he bear? -- 1 Cor. 15.14. G.F. does grant, and
all the Quakers, that Christ was made like unto us, sin excepted, and had a
body and soul, or else how could he suffer? And is risen, the same that
decended is ascended, as the apostle says." Williams, page 51. Fox, page 43.
And I have seen other of their writings which hold expressly, that Christ
brought the same body from heaven, that he carried thither again. But they
reckoned it abominable for Mr. Williams to use a word concerning our Savior's
humanity, that is, not in our translation, while he at the same time approved
of the reading as it is; yet when Hebrews 1.3. was brought in those times to
prove the personallity of the Trinity, the Quakers said, "That is fasly
translated, for in the Greek it is not person but substance." Bishop, page 362.
And said Mr. Samuel Hubbard, "They turn the holy scriptures into allegories,
all unless, some which they wrest to their own destruction, as the apostle
Peter says?

THEY expressly held to a power of direction within them, superior to the
scriptures, which carried them into actions that light from thence, or from
reason could not justify; and their only way, was to appeal to an inward motion
or voice. As for instance, George Bishop speaks of Deborah Wilson, as a "modest
woman, of retired life, and sober conversation; and that bearing a great
burden for the hardness and cruelty of the people, she went through the town
of Salem naked, as a sign, which she having in part porformed, was laid hold
of, and bound over to appear at the next court of Salem, where the wicked
rulers sentenced her to be whipped." Lydia Wardwel, a married woman of Hampton,
went in the same manner into the meeting house in Newbury, in time of public
worship; for which she met with the like treatment. Mr. Williams refered the
Quakers to these instances that their own author had published; and told them
they never could persuade souls not bewitched, that the holy spirit would move
them to do so: to which they answer thus. "We do believe thee, in that dark,
persecuting, bloody spirit, that thou and the New England priests are bewitched
in, you cannot believe that you are naked from God and his clothing, and blind:
and therefore has the Lord in his power moved some of his sons and daughters
to go naked; yea, and they did tell them in OLIVER'S days, and the long
parliaments, that God would strip them of their church-profession, and of their
power, as naked as they were. And so they were true prophets and prophetesses
to the nation, as many sober men have confessed since; though thou and the old
persecuting priests in New England remain in your blindness and nakedness. --
As thou did in the dispute, so now, thou make a great ado with our men and
woman going naked: we told them then, we owned no such practice in any, unless
they were called unto it by the Lord. -- He begineth again to upbraid us with
our men and women's going naked, as if it were a thing commonly allowed among
us in their wills, without the motion of God." Fox, page 69 -- 28 -- 3^.


As an impartial historian I thought it duty thus to state these plain facts
and sentiments on both sides; for upon Dr. Mather's saying, some good Men
formerly took that wrong way of reclaiming heretics by persecution; the Quakers
spent seventeen pages in the most striking recital of what they suffered in
those times that their art would admit of, in order to prove, that no good man
could be an actor therein. And to fix this prejudice more lastingly in the
minds of all, they turned it into verse, saying,

"Those that in conscience cannot wrong a worm, Are sinned and whipped because
they cannot conform; And time has been, which never shall be forgot, God's
servants have been hanged none knows for what; Except for serving of their
blessed Lord, For quaking and for trembling at his word. Let these black days,
like the fifth of November, Be writ in red, for ages to remember." Magnalia,
book 7, p. 22, Whiting's answer, ^.11 -- 29.


AND they are remembered in such a manner to this day, that a person can hardly
plead for equal liberty of conscience among the Massachusetts, without having
the disorders of Rhode Island colony brought up against it; nor for the good
doctrine, and family orders of those fathers, among some in the latter colony,
without having hot irons and halters thrown in his teeth! Not only so, but we
have lately seen artful men trying to prevent our union in the cause of our
civil liberties by these means. But from the above facts the reader may judge,
whether an invasion of each others rights, under the name of religion, was not
the real cause of those dreadful broils; which a true acknowledgment thereof,
both as to property and conscience, would have prevented. Whether the grand
error on both sides, was not the assuming a power to govern religion, instead
of being governed by it?

ON October 20th, Robinson, Stevenson and Mary Dyre, received the sentence of
death, which was executed upon the two men, the 27th: the woman was brought
with them to the gallows, but at the intercession of her son of Newport and
others, she was then reprieved, and sent away. Though returning again the next
spring, she was hanged, June 1st, 1660; twelve days after the court of Plymouth
repealed one or more of the sharpest laws they had made against that people.
Charles the second had been restored to the crown of England, on May 29, which
Plymouth could have no knowledge of then. After the news of it arrived,
governor Endicot and his court wrote to him, Dec. 10th, when they said, "Our
liberty to walk in the faith of the gospel, with all good conscience, was the
cause of our transporting ourselves, with our wives, little ones, and our
substance, from that pleasant land over the atlantic ocean, into this vast
wilderness, choosing rather the pure scripture worship with a good conscience,
in this remote wilderness among the heathen, than the pleasures of England with
submission to the then so disposed and so far prevailing hierarchy, which we
could not do without an evil conscience. -- Concerning the Quakers, open and
captial blasphemers, open seducers from the glorious Trinity, our Lord Jesus
Christ, the blessed gospel, and from the holy scripture as the rule of life,
open enemies to the government itself as established in the hands of any but
men of their own principles. -- "The magistrate at last, in conscience both to
God and man, judged himself called for the defense of all, to keep the passage
with the point of the sword held toward them; this could do no harm to him
that would be warned thereby, their wittingly rushing themselves thereupon was
their own act, we with humility conceive a crime bringing their blood upon
their own head." Hubbard -- Massachusetts history, vol, 3. p. 326, 327.


IN like manner they proceeded and hanged William Leddra, March 14th, 1661; but
their friends in England procured and express from White Hall, of Sept. 9th,
which was brought over by Samuel Shattock, of Salem, requiring these rulers to
forbear such things for the future, and to send such Quakers as appeared to
them so obnoxious, over to be tried in England. Soon after the receipt of which
Mr. Norton and Mr. Bradstreet, were sent over as agents, by whom governor
Endicot and his court wrote to the Earl of Manchester, "to beseech his majesty
to tender them in respect of those pestelent heretics the Quakers, who have
lately obtained his majesty's letter, requiring us to forbear their
punishments; in observance whereof we have suspended execution of our laws
against them, respecting death or corporal punishments; but this indulgance
they abuse to insolency and seduction of our people, and unless his majesty
strengthen our hands in the application of some suitable remedy to suppress
these and others, ill affected to our tranquillity, this hopeful plantation is
likely in all probability to be destroyed." They had before said, that allowing
such to have liberty here, would be "so contrary to our consciences to permit,
and no less oppression of us than the destroying both us and ours by the
sword." Ibid. page 331 -- 360.
How justly then did Mr. Williams call the use of force in such affairs, The
bloody tenet!

WE will now return to the affairs of baptism: Mr Hubbard upon the year 1656,
says, "Baptism unto this time had been administered unto those children only,
whose immediate parents were admitted into full communion in the churches where
they lived: but now the country came to be increased, and sundry families were
found, that had children born in them, whose immediate parents had never
attempted to join to any of the churches to which they belonged, and yet were
very much unsatisfied that they could not obtain baptism for their children;
the cause occasioned many debates between the ministers of the country."
Connecticut took the lead therein, and sent a draught of questions about it to
the rulers of the Massachusetts, requesting that the ablest ministers of both
colonies might be called together, to answer the same. Such an assembly was
therefore called by authority at Boston, June 4th, 1657, and sat till the 10th.
Their answers to 21 questions were afterward printed in London, under the
title of A disputation concerning church members, and their children. Therein
they concluded, that the children of professing parents, "are by means of their
parents covenanting, in covenant also, and members of the church by divine
institution. 1. Because they are in that covenant for substance which was made
with Abraham, Genesis 17.7. compared with Deuteronomy. 29.12. etc. 2. Because such
children are, by Christ affirmed to have a place and portion in the kingdom of
heaven. 3. Else no children could be baptized, baptism being a church
ordinance, and a seal of the covenant of grace." And also, that "it is the duty
of infants, who confederate in their parents, when grown up to years of
discretion, though not yet sit for the Lord's supper, to own the covenant they
made with their parents, by entering thereinto in their own persons; and it is
the duty of the church to call upon them for the performance thereof; and if,
being called upon, they shall refuse the performance of this great duty, or
otherwise continue scandalous, they are liable to be censured for the same by
the church. And in case they understand the grounds of religion, are not
scandalous, and solemnly own the covenant in their own persons, wherein they
give up both themselves and their children unto the Lord, and desire baptism
for them, we (with due reverence to any godly learned that may dissent) see not
sufficient cause to deny baptism unto their children."

"As this disputation had its first rise in Connecticut, so was there much
difference and contention raised at Hartford, between Mr. Samuel Stone, their
teacher, and the rest of the church, occasioned at the first on some such
account; insomuch that sundry members of that church, having rent themselves
off, removed to another place higher up the river, where they settled, and
gathered a distinct church in that way of Schism, as the rest of the churches
accounted. This unhappy difference overspread the whole colony of Connecticut,
with such a monstrous enchantment upon the minds of christian brethren that in
all the towns round about, the people generally made themselves parties to one
side or the other of the quarret. -- A world of sin was doubtless committed,
even by pious men on this occasion.

IT came at last to an open breach, which could not be healed, or made up among
themselves, which put them upon a necessity of calling a convention of the
messengers of sundry churches in the Massachusetts, who met at Boston, in 1659,
and made a reconciliation between them -- The practice of church-care, about
the children of our church^s, met with such opposition ascould not be
ene^^^tered with any thing less than a synod, of ^le^^s and messengers from all
the churches of the ^^^ssachusetts colony. Accordingly the general court,
having the necessity of the matter laid before them at their second session, in
the year 1661, issued out their desire and order for the convening of such a
synod at Boston in the spring." After long (...) the majority of them approved
of the above (...) position, and obtained the concurrance of the ^^neral court
thereto, on ^^^o^^ 8th, 1662. Hubbard -- Magnal^^^, (...), and B. 5. p. 63, 64.
(...) Mitchel, who was the chief draughtsman, of that resuit, said, "We make
account that if we keep baptism within the non-excommunicable, and the Lord's
supper within the compass of those that have (unto charity) some what of the
power of goodliness, or grace in exercise, we shall be near about the right
middle-way of church-reformation." His life, p. 76, 80.
And it has been called the halfway covenant ever since; though this halving of
matters in religion has done more mischief in this land, as well as elsewhere,
than tongue can express.

MR. Eleazer Mather, the first minister of Northampton, wrote on July 4, this
year, to Devenport, and said concerning this synod, "There was scarce any of
the congregational principles, but what were lain at by some or other of the
assembly; as relations of the work of grace, power of voting of the fraternity
in admission," etc. Mass. hist, vol. 1. p. 234.
President Chauncey published his testimony against this new scheme; and so did
Mr. Devenport; to the last of which Mr. Increase Mather wrote a preface,
containing a distinct apology for those who dissented from it. Mr. John Allen
of Dedham answered Mr. Chauncey, and Mr. Richard Mather the other, while Mr.
Mitchel was employed to answer his sons preface. Young Mr. Mather in that
preface says, "The synod acknowledged, that there ought be to true saving faith
in the parent, or else the child ought not to be baptized. We entreated and
unged again and again, that this, which themselves acknowledged was a principle
of truth, might be set down for a conclusion, and then we should all agree But
those reverend persons would not consent to this." No; and Mr. Mitchel was so
far from doing it in his answer, that he tells of distinguishing between faith
in its hopeful beginning, and faith in special exercise; initial faith and
exercised faith, and says, "All reformed churches, unanimously grant the
child's right unto baptism, by its being born within the visible church.
Besides, what have infants more than mere membership to give them right unto
baptism? We know of no stronger argument for infant baptism than this, that
church members are to be baptized." Magnalia, book 5. page 77 -- 79.
To which I would say, that the Jewish church indeed was first constituted of
the household of Abraham, and all his offspring were born in the church, of whom
the son of the bond woman was the first that was circumcised; but the christian
church is constituted of the household of God, the children of the free woman,
in distinction from those who were born after the flesh, though from Abraham's
body. Ephesians 2. Gal. 4.

MR Mitchel, by his reasonings drew Mr. I. Mather over to that side; after
which he acted many cruel things against the baptists for near 20 years, till
the same measures were meeted to him again, so as very sensable to convince him
of his error therein. Mr. Hubbard says, "Some think Mr. Devenport's book has
overthrown the propositions of the synod, according to their own principles."
Mr. Devenport was a while in Holland, before he came here, where he testified
against their promiscuous baptisms; and he said, "When a reformation of the
church has been brought about in any part of the world, it has rarely been
afterward carried on any one step farther than the first reformers did succeed
in their first endeavors. He observed, that as easily might the (...) have been
removed from the mountains of Ararat, where it first grounded, as a people get
any ground in reformation, after and beyond the first remove of the reformers.
And this observation quickened him to embark in a design of reformation,
wherein he might have opportunity to drive things in the first essay, as near
to the precept and pattern of scripture as they could be driven." Magnalia,
bo^^ 3. page 53.
We shall presently see other ministers promoting a separation from him for
these attempts.

On the 8th of May, this year, the assembly at Boston wrote to that of
Rhode Island and said, "Our affection to peace and a fair correspondance, puts
us upon a condescension far beneath our own reason, and the justice of our
cause, once more to transmit this our last letter to you, concerning the unjust
molestation and intrusion of some of your inhabitants, upon the undoubted
rights of this jurisdiction, and the inhabitants thereof, in their grants and
possessions in the Pequot and Narraganset country, upon pretense of authority
from your court, and purchase from Indians, but producing no deed, record,
order or commission for warranting the same; wherein, as we conceive, they act
directly against reason, righteousness, precedent, grants from England, clear
conquest, purchase and possession. It is not unknow to yourselves what means
have been used from time to time, both by the commissioners of the United
Colonies, and by the governor and magistrates, general court and council of
this jurisdiction, by their several letters, to desire you to cause your people
to desist such proceedings, and extend your authority for suppressing
injustice; but to this day have received no satisfactory or particular answer
in the premises; which has given us grounds to suppose, that at least you
indulge them in their proceedings. You may hereby have notice, that two of your
people, namely, Tobias Sanders, and Robert Bardick, being long since taken on
the place, and secured by us to answer their trespass, we have now called them
before the court, and find nothing from them to justify their proceedings;
therefore the court has fined them 40 l. for their offense, and toward
satisfaction for the charges expended in carrying them before authority; and
that they stand committed till the fine be satisfied, and security given to the
secretary to the value of 100 l. for their peaceable demeanor toward all the
inhabitants of this jurisdiction for the future. And we hereby signify unto
you, that unless you command off your inhabitants that yet continue their
possession at Sotherton and Pateskomscut before the last of June next, you may
expect we shall not continue to neglect the relief and protection of our people
there molested; and shall account it our duty to secure all such persons and
estates of yours as shall be found within our jurisdiction, until just damages
be satisfied. But this we heartily and earnestly desire may be avoided, by your
prudent care and justice, and that peace and good agreement may for the future
be preserved beween us." Rhode Island records


This reminds me of Mr. Locke's saying, "That dominion is founded in grace, is
an assertion by which those who maintain it do plainly lay claim to the
possession of all things; for they are not so wanting to themselves as not to
believe, or at least as not to profess themselves to be the truly pious and
faithful." On tolleration page 61.
Because Mr. Williams testified against that power when he first came to
Boston, the court wrote to Salem against him; whereupon he did not stay to
contend with them, but peacably withdrew to Plymouth, where his teaching was
well approved as long as Mr. Bradford was governor. But when Mr. Winslow came
into that office, who with the Massachusetts was against a full toleration in
religious matters, Massachusetts history, vol. 3. page. 154
Mr. Williams peaceably retired to Salem, and took the charge of that flock;
but for the churches receiving him without the rulers leave, they took away
some of their possessions, till they would give up Mr. Williams; and, for his
faithful admonitions to them on that account, they expelled him out of their
jurisdiction; but who can tell how far that extends? When he came first into
this country all the Indians from Boston and Plymouth-Bays to Paucatuck river
were tributaries to the chief sachems of Narraganset; and from thence to
Hudson's river, and over all Long Island Sassicus had extended his power, even
over 26 sachems. Connecticut assembly's answer to the king's letter, 1773,
wrote by governor. Trumbull.
The Pequot, being thus powerful, made war upon the Narragansets, who, in April
1632, had a number of their tributaries out of Plymouth and Massachusett
colonies to assist them against him; yet Sassicus prevailed, and extended
Prince's annals, page 58, 59.
his territories ten miles east of Paucatuck river. About the same time
Natuwannute, a sachem of the country about where Hartford now stands, with a
number of his men, "were driven out from thence by the potency of the Pequots,"
and came to our fathers at Plymouth, and requested them to go up and trade
there, though "their end was to be restored to their country again." This motion
was complied with, and a trading house was set up among them. Massachusetts
history, vol, 2. page 469, 470
Which was such an eyesore to the Pequots, that in 1634 they murdered captain
Stone and seven men with him, plundered his goods an sunk his vessel, because
they were going up Connecticut river to trade there. Two years after they
murdered Captain Oldham as I have related, p. 75. And upon the notice which Mr.
Williams gave them of this sad event, Mr. Endicot with an armed force was sent
in Aug. 25, 1636, to try to bring the Pequots to terms; but Johnson says it
proved a bootless voyage, only his leaving some men with Underhill, at Saybrook
fort prevented its being taken. Upon his return Sassicus applied to the
Narragansets for a reconciliation, that they all might join to expel these new
comers; representing, "that if they should help, or suffer the English to
subdue the Pequots, they would thereby make way for their own future ruin; and
that they need not come to open battle with the English; for only to fire their
houses; kill their cattle, lay in ambush and shoot them as they went about
their business, they would quickly be forced to leave the country, and the
Indians not be exposed to any great hazard." Major Mason's history of the
Pequot war and others.


HAD two such politic and potent princes as Sassicus and Miantinomo were,
united in this scheme, when Boston was but six years old; Providence and
Hartford but a few months, and New Haven not begun, what would have become of
all their claims they were now contending for. And it is most evident that Mr.
Williams was the very instrument of preventing the junction of those two great
Indian powers, and so of saving the vast interest we now have in this country;
but how was he requited for it? Why after Warwick men had obtained as fair a
title to that town, as the Massachusetts ever had to Boston yet because they
were not orthodox they were fetched away by force of arms; and the captive
sachem was murdered for fear he should revenge such doings. And when the
orthodox part afterward proclaimed war upon his successors, because they were
for revenging his death, and Mr. Williams, to prevent the further efusion of
blood, had prevalled with them to go down and settle the matter at Boston, how
were they treated? p. 193.195. They were not only compelled to sign an
engagement to pay all damages and costs, and to quit any claim to the Pequot
country, but also to say, "The Narraganset and Nyantick sagamores and deputy,
hereby agree and covenant, to and with the commissioners of the United
Colonies, that henceforward, they will neither give, grant, sell, or in any
manner alienate any part of their country, nor any pa^cel of land therein,
either to any English or others, without consent or allowance of the said
commissioners." And two years after, upon their calling for their pay, Passicus
sent them word, that "when he made this covenant, he did it in fear of the
army, and though the English kept their covenant with him there, and let him go
from them, yet the army, was to go to Narraganset immediately and kill him
there; therefore said the commissioners, Set your hands to such and such
things, or cise the army shall go forth to the Narragansets." In answer to
which the commissioner say, After covenants have been solemnly made, and
hostages given, and a small part of the wampum paid, and all the rest due, now
to pretend fears is a vain and offensive excuse" Records of the United Colonies.
This shows that themselves did not neglect the rule they prescribed to their
general in that expedition, viz. "You are to use your best endeavors to gain
the enemies canoes, or utterly to destroy them, and herein you may make good
use of the Indians our confederates, as you may do upon other occasions, having
due regard to the honor of God, who is both our sword and shield, and to the
distance which is to be observed betwixt christians and barbarians, as well as
in other negociations." Massachusetts history, vol. 3. page 151.


SIXTEEN months before that covenant was made, Passicus and other heads of
their tribes, had by an ample deed resigned over and submitted all those lands
to the supreme authority in England, and Mr. Williams had procured a charter
thereof from thence, extending unto the Pequot river and country, page 148,
192. The Massachusetts records, upon granting Fisher's island to Mr. Winthrop,
p. 115 say it lies against the mouth of Pequot river. What right of
jurisdiction then had those colonies east of that river? and what right had
Passicus to engage any of those lands to them, which he had submitted to
another authority so long before? By repeated endeavors the commissioners had
got all the wampum that was promised in said covenant but 308 fathom, before
they met at Hartford on Sept. 5, 1650; and then captian Atherton was sent, with
twenty armed men, to demand the remainder, with orders to seize their goods if
the Indians refused to pay it; and if resistance should be made so as any life
was lost that a special meeting of the comissioners should then be called to
make war upon them for it. He accordingly went, an placed his men round
Passicus's tent, and going into it, seized the sachem by the hair of his head,
and threatened to shoot him, if any resistance was made. This terrified them so
much, that the wampum was presently paid. On July 25, 1651, at the desire of
the Narraganset sachems, Mr. Williams wrote to the governor at Boston, an
account of sundry complaints they had against Uncas; which letter was laid
before the commissioners when they met at New-Hanven, the 4th of September
following; but though Uncas was present yet they acted nothing upon it, because
the Narragansets had not sent any of their men to support the charge. At the
same time a tribute of 312 fathom of wampum was paid by Uncas, Nincerost and
others, on account of the Pequots they had among them; and upon laying of it
down they demanded, "Why this tribute was required, how long it should
continue. and whether the children to be born hereafter were to pay it? All
which being considered, the commiss^^ners by Thomas Stanton, answered, that the
tribute by agreement has been due yearly from the Pequots since anno 1638, for
sundry murders without provocation committed by them upon several of the
English at several times, as they found opportunity; refusing either to deliver
up the murderers or to do justice upon them; so drawing on a war upon
themselves, to the great charge an inconvenience of the English: which war,
through the good hand of our God, issued first in a conquest over that
treacherous and bloody people, and atter by agreement (to spare as much as
might be even such guilty blood) in a small tribute, to be paid in different
proportions, by, and for their males, according to their different ages yearly;
but has not hitherto been satisfied, though demanded. Wherefore, though twelve
years tribute were due before the year 1650, and though the agreement was for a
yearly tribute to be paid by them and theirs, so long as they continue in this
part of the country; yet the commissioners, something to ease their spirits,
and to engage them to an inoffensive and peacable carriage, declared that the
payment of this tribute shall be limited to ten years, this last year to be
reckoned the first; after which, unless they draw trouble unto themselves, they
shall be free." Records of the United Colonies.


SUCH an uneasiness among the Narragansets was discovered two years after, that
another army was raised and sent against them, which compelled them into
another treaty, which not being otherwise fulfilled, the sachems were brought
on October 13, 1660 to mortgage all their lands, to Major Atherton, and about
twenty associates with him, for 600 fathom fo wampum, said then to be due to
the commissioners of the united colonies. I find also by the records, that the
Massachusetts and Connecticuts could never agree how to divide the Pequot lands
betwixt them, till the commissioners from Plymouth and New Haven had the case
refered to them, and they on Sept. 16, 1658, settled the line betwixt them;
which was to be Mistick river(which runs in betwixt Stonington and G^oton) up
to the pond, by Lanthorn-hill, and thence from the middle of that pond to run a
north course; the Massachusetts to have both property and jurisdiction from
thence to Wecapang-brook, which was the easterly bounds of Sassicus's conquest.
Pataquamscut purchase was made partly in 1657 and partly in 1658, by some
inhabitants of Rhode Island, and John Hull of Boston, who got a great estate by
coining their silver money.) This purchase was about fifteen miles in length,
and seven in breadth, in the heart of the Narraganset country. In 1668 these
purchasers gave three-hundred acres of their best land, for an orthodox person,
to preach God's word to the inhabitants; which has cost much contention in the
law. Dowglass, vol. 2. page 104.

In 1752, Dr. Macsparran said, "I have been eng^ged in a lawsuit about
Glebeland twenty-eight years, and the independent teacher has at last obtained
a decree in council in his favor; so that I am forced to sit down by the loss
of at least 600 l. ste^ling." America disected, page 42.

I am told that Dr. Stennett, a baptist minister in London, had a great hand in
procuring this decree for (...) Torry.




WHEN their assembly met at Newport May 21, 1661, they appointed a committee
upon the letters they had then received from the Massachusetts, "who seriously
considered and debated circumstances, concerning the matter in difference,
betwixt the gentlemen, and some friends with them, that are active in sharing
the Narraganset lands in the colony, without the consent of the colony; and we
find by their letter, that those gentlemen, major Atherton and associates are
not so well informed of the intent of the colony as might be requisite." And
they concluded to write and give them better information, and to offer to leave
the case to referees to settle it; but say, "In case a fair issue cannot be
had, as is desired, then, in a speedy and convenient time and season, to forbid
the said gentlemen, or any of their company, in his majesty's name, from
further proceeding in the said purchase, as to possessing or sharing of any of
the said lands, and to prosecute them, or any of them, in case they still
proceed without consent of the colony, as concluding that such their
proceedings are contrary to the crown and dignity of hsi majesty and to the
peace and well-being of his majesty's subjects in this colony." The 27th of
August following an assembly met at Portsmouth, of which Mr. Williams was a
member. when they sent a commission and letters to Mr. Clarke, to solicit for
a new Charter, April 27th, 1662, the town of Providence gave Mr. Clarke a full
purchase right of land therein as a free gist. The next month came the forgoing
latter from Boston to their assembly, with account of their dealing with men
whom they called trespasers, of whom. Mr. Burdick was then a member of Mr.
Clarke's church. -- He married Mr. Samuel Hubbard's danghter, and has a large
posterity remaining in and about westerly to this day. Mr. Sanford, and Mr.
Green, were now sent to Boston to make another trial for an amicable
settlement of this controversy* It is to be noted, that neither of those
colonies, who had made such a noise about their rights, had ever received any
charter, either from king or parliament, of any lands, to the west of
Providence colony till Connecticut, by the help of Mr. Winthrop, obtained one
dated April 23, 1662, which took New Haven into the same colony. And when the
commissioners met at Boston the 4th of September, they wrote to Rhode Island
rulers in their former strain, and informed them of a warrant they had seen,
signed by Joseph Torry their secretary, in the name of the general court,
"warning Capt. Gookin and others to desist and forbear any further or future
possession of any lands at or about Paucatuck as they shall answer the contrary
at their peril; yet withal expressing your submission to his majesty's
determination, Wherefore [say the commissioners] being earnestly desirous to
prevent any further disturbance of the peace of the colonies, though we have no
doubt of the present right and interest of the Massachusetts to those lands, we
are willing to improve the argument which yourselves have owned and therefore
thought meet to certify you, that we have read and perused a charter of
incorporation, under the broad seal of England, sent over in the last ship,
granted to some gentlemen of Connecticut, wherein the lands at Paucatuck and
Narraganset are contained, which we hope will prevail with you to require and
cause your people to withdraw themselves, and desist from further disturbance."

THE words in said charter which they built this upon, bounded that colony
east, "by the Narraganset river, commonly called Narraganset bay, where the
said rive, falls into the sea." Now it is to be remembered, that Plymouth
patent was bounded westward by Narraganset and bay, and these colonists
pretended that Warwick was included therein, which could not be, unless
Paucatuck was the river meant; and if it was, where is their right now to go
east of it by Connecticut charter? The truth is, names are arbitrary, and those
worthy governors, Bradford and Winslow, took Patucket to be the river intended
in their patent, p. 72, 74. And there was now less room left for this dispute;
for on July 8, 1663 his majesty granted Rhode Island charter, which describes
their west boundaries to be the middle channel of Paucatuck river up to its
head, and thence a north course to the south line of the Massachusetts; which
river says he, "having been yielded after much debate, for the fixed and
certain bounds between these our said colonies, by the agents thereof; who have
also agreed, that the said Paucatuck river shall be also called, alias,
Narraganset river; and to prevent future disputes that otherwise might arise
thereby forever hereafter, shall be construed, deemed and taken to be the
Narraganset river, in our late grant to Connecticut colony, mentioned as the
eastwardly bounds of that colony." This colony of Rhode Island and Providence
plantations, was to extend three English miles east and northeast of the most
eastern and northeastern parts of the Narraganset bay, unto the mouth of
Providence river and thence by the eastwardly bank of it up to Patucket falls,
being the most westwardly line of Plymouth colony; and thence due north to the
Massachusetts line, by which it is bounded on the north, and by the ocean on
the south, including Block-Island, and the other islands within their bay. As
the Indians had formerly sent over a submission of themselves and land, to the
king's father, they had now sent another to him; whereupon he says in this
charter. "It shall not be lawful to, or for the rest of the colonies, to invade
or molest the native Indians, or any other inhabitants inhabiting within they
bounds and limits hereafter mentioned; they having subjected themselves unto
us, and being by us taken into our special protection, without the knowledge
and consent of the governor and company of our colony of Rhode Island, and
Providence-plantations."

This charter appointed that a governor deputy governor, and ten assistants
should be elected annually on the first Wednesday in May, who, with deputies or
representatives from each town, were to make laws, not contrary to the laws of
England, make grants of land, constitute courts of justice, and appoint their
officers both civil and military. Mr. Clarke sent over this charter, and Capt.
Gregory Dexter fetched it from Boston; upon which a large assembly of the
freemen in all the colony, met at Newport November 2, and ordered Capt. Dexter
to take forth the charter and read it before to their view, and then to have it
safely deposited with governor Arnold. "And they voted to pay all Mr. Clarke's
disburstments in going to England, in their service there, and upon his
intended return; as also one hundred pounds sterling. as a free gratuity to him,
beside those expenses: yea, and to give Capt. Dexter twenty-five pounds sterling.
for his service and faithfulness in bringing the charter from Boston. Mr.
Clarke's letters were read; upon which letters of thanks were ordered to be
sent to the king, and to lord Clarendon, for these great savors they had
received by their means. The next day (after the governor, duputy-governor, and
six assistants had taken their engagements) they called the sachems of the
Narragansets, and Nianticks before them, and let them know what the king had
done for them; upon which they said, "they return his majesty great thanks for
his gracious relief, in releasing their lands from those forced purchases and
mortgages by some of the other colonies." But another thing which is by no
means to be omitted is, that the king says, in their petition for the charter
they declared, "That it is much on their hearts, if they may be permitted, to
hold forth a lively experiment, that a most flourishing civil state may stand
and best be maintained, and that among our English subjects, with a FULL
LIBERTY IN RELIGIOUS CONCERNMENTS, and that true piety rightly grounded upon
gospel principles, will give that best and greatest security to the
sovereignty, and will lay in the hearts of men, the strongest obligation to
true loyalty. This petition was therefore fully granted: and above a hundred
years after, a worthy gentleman well says, "This great experiment has been
made, and it has fully appeared, that a flourishing civil state, and the most
unstained loyalty, may stand without the help of any religious party tests to
support them, and the christian religion is as little indebted to human laws
for its support, as it is to human inventions, for the purity of its morals,
and the sublimity of its doctrines." History of Providence


For seven years past there had been many contentions about lands, and
strivings to strain Indian purchases, beyond their just limits, in Providence,
Newport, and other parts of the colony, which Mr. Williams had a great hand in
composing and settleing; the particulars of which would be very instructive,
had we room for them And his HOPE in 1647; that government, held forth through
love, union and order, though by few in number, and mean in condition, yet
would withstand and overcome mighty opposers, [page 200] was wonderfully
granted and confirmed; the memory of which, in the figure of an ANCHOR with
this word for its motto, in their colony seal, has been continued from that
time to this. Mr. Clarke returned, June 7th, 1664, after he had served his
colony at the British court twelve years. In October following the assembly
appointed him, Mr. Williams and others, to inspect their laws, to see if any of
them were contrary to their charter, and to make a table of them. A committee
was also appointed to consider of their eastern and western boundaries, and to
write to the other colonies concerning them. Connecticut still contended for
power and jurisdiction in Narraganset, and offered to leave the case to the
colonies to Massachusetts and Plymouth; which Rhode Island would not do. The
king's commissioners who were now sent over, heard the complaints of the
sachems and others, and entered upon the Narraganset country in the king's
name, and called it the king's province. But on the east line they allowed
Plymouth colony to come to the the water, till his majesty's pleasure should be
further known. Massachusetts history, vol. 3. page 382 -- 414, 415.
And so the line continued, till other commissioners in 1741, settled the line
according to to Rhode Island charter, which gave them the towns of Bristol,
Warren, Barrington, Tiverton and Littlecompton, which Plymouth and the
Massachusetts had held till then.

THE first baptist church within that which is now the Massachusetts state, was
constituted in Rehoboth this year; Mr. Holmes and his friends having only held
a meeting there for a while, and then removed to Newport. For a more clear idea
of of its original we must look over into Wales, where at Ilston in
Glamorganshire a baptist church was formed, October 1st, 1649; the beginning
whereof their records describe thus, viz. "We cannot but admire at the
unsearchable wisdom, power and love of God, in bringing about his own designs,
far above, and beyond the capacity and understanding of the wisest of men.
Thus, to the glory of his own great name, has he dealt with us; for when there
had been no company or society of people, holding forth and professing the
doctrine, worship, order and discipline of the gospel, according to the
primative instiution, that ever we heard of in all Wales, since the apostasy,
it pleased the Lord to choose this dark corner to place his name in, and honor
us, undeserving creatures, with the happiness of being the first in all these
parts, among whom was practiced the glorious ordinance of baptism, and here to
gather the first church of baptized believers." From whence they go on to
relate, how Mr John Miles and Mr. Thomas Proud, went up to London the next
preceding spring, and by the direction of Providence, came into the baptist
society at the Glass-house in Broadstreet, under the care of Mr. William
Consett, and Mr. Edward Draper, "immediately after they had kept a day to seek
the Lord, that he would send laborers into the dark corners of the land." These
travelers were well received, and were soon sent back into their own country
again, and were instrumental of gathering a baptist church at the time above
mentioned; and which, by a blessing upon their labors, increased by the close
of the next year to fifty-five members. In 1651, forty more joined to it;
forty-seven in 1652, and by the end of 1660, two hundred and sixty-three
persons had joined to that church, whose names all now stand in a neat book of
records which they kept; which contain a distinct account of the means and
methods they took to promote vital and practical religion among the several
branches of their society; as also letters of correspondence to and from their
brethren in various parts of England and Ireland

BUT here another scene opens.

THE presbyterians had been as much against equal religious liberty as the
episcopalians, and manifested as great bitterness against those who broke their
power in the long parliament; and these two parties joined in restoring the
second Charles to the throne, who came in with plausable promises of indulgence
to tender consciences; and great pains were taken to accommodate matters
between them, without any good effect. The episcopalians having got the power
into their hands, determined to crush all that opposed it. Among the rest they
wreaked their vengance on Sir Henry Vane, whom they beheaded in August 1662."
His indiscretion and insolence (says a great author) as well on his trial as
his execution, have been extremely aggravated; but it is easy to see, it was
only to save the king's honor, who having positivly promised a pardon to all
except the king's judges, could not avoid granting a pardon to Vane, without
violating his promise." And when Vane's friends persuaded him to make some
submission in order to save his life, he said, "If the king does not think
himself more concerned for his honor and word, than I do for my life, I am very
willing they should take it. Nay, I declare that I value my life less in a good
cause, than the king can do his promise." Rapin, vol. 2. page 631.
A presbyterian author who writes very bitterly against him, yet owns that,"
the two things in which he had most success, and spoke most plainly, were his
earnest plea for universal liberty of conscience, and against the magistrates
intermeddling with religion, and his teaching his followers to revile the
ministry, calling them ordinarily black coats, priests, and other names which
savoured of reproach." And he says, "No man could die with greater appearance
of a gallant resolution, and fearlessness than he did, though before supposed a
timorous man; insomuch, that the manner of his death procured him more applause
than all the actions of his life." Calamy's abridgment, page 99, 101.
On the 24th of that month, called St. Bartholomew's day, and act of parliament
took place, which ejected all teachers, both of churches and schools, out of
their places, who would not declare their assent or consent to all the forms
and ceremonies of the church of England. About 2000 were turned out by it; and
the method the church party took to procure this act, was secretly to foment
disturbances and tumults in different parts of England, and then to persuade
the parliament that the presbyterians did it, and that no peace could be had
with them till dissenters were all turned out of place. And among those so
ejected was our Mr. Miles. Ibid. p. 178 -- 181. and vol. 2. p. 7^^.
Upon which he and some of his friends came over to our country, and brought
their church records with them. And at Mr. Butterworth's house in Rehoboth, in
1663, John Miles, elder, James Brown, Nicholas Tanner, Joseph Carpenter, John
Butterworth, Eldad Kingsley, and Benjamin Alby, joined in asolemn covenant
together.

THIS church was then in Plymouth colony, concerning whom Dr. Mather says,
"there being many good men among those -- I do not know that they have been
persecuted with any harder means, than those of kind conferences to reclaim
them." Magnalia, Book 1. p. 14.
I suppose it was so for some years, and that because Mr. Newman, who
persecuted Mr. Holmes, died this year; but four years after I find it thus
recorded, viz. "At the court holden at Plymouth the 2d of July, 1667, before
Thomas Prince, governor, John Alden, Josiah Winshow, Thomas Southworth, William
Bradford, Thomas Hinckley, Nathniel Bacon, and John Freeman, assistants -- Mr.
Miles, and Mr. Brown, for their breach of order, in setting up of a public
meeting without the knowledge and approbation of the court, to the disturbance
of the peace of the place, are fined each of them 5 l. and Mr. Tanner the sum
of 1 l. and we judge that their continuance at Rehoboth, being very projudicial
to the peace of that church and that town, may not be allowed; and do therefore
order all persons concerned therein, wholly to desist from the said meeting in
that place or township, within this month. Yet in case they shall remove their
meeting unto some other place, where they may not prejudice any other church,
and shall give us any reasonable satisfaction respecting their principles, we
know not but they may be permitted by this government so to do." And it was no
longer than the 30th of October following, before the court made them an ample
grant of Wannamoiset which they called Swanzey. It then included what is now
Warren and Barrington, and the district of Shawomet, as well as the present
town of Swanzey. Plymouth records -- Note, this town was named on March 1st,
1667 -- 8. when by to stake the first grant is dated, in Swanzey town records;
but the above I took from the court records
There they made a regular settlement, which has continued to this day. The
families also of Luther, Cole, Bowen, Wheaton, Martin, Barnes, Thurber,
Bozworth, Mason, Child and others, which are numerous in those parts, sprang
from the early planters of that town and church. There first meeting house was
built a little west of Kelly's ferry, against Warren, but Mr. Miles settled the
west side of the great bridge which still bears his name.

CHAP. VI. An account of the constitution of the first baptist church in
Boston, in 1665, and of their sufferings down to 1675.
MR. Hubbard says,"As some were studying how baptism might be enlarged and
extended to the seed of the faithful in their several generations, there were
others as studious to deprive all unadult children thereof, and to restrain the
privilege inly to adult believers." And Dr. Mather, after confessing that very
odious and unjust things had been published against anabaptists ever since
Luther's time, says, "Infant baptism has been scrupled by multitudes in our
day, who have been in other points most worthy christains, and as holy,
whatchful, fruitful and heavenly people as perhaps any in the world. Some few
of these people have been among the planters of New England from the beginning,
and have been welcome to the communion of our churches, reserving their
particular opinion unto themselves -- At last some of our churches used, it may
be, a little too much cogency toward the brethren, who would weakly turn their
backs when infants were brouht forth to be baptized." Magnalia, Book 7. p. 27.
Seth Sweetser, who came over to Charlestown in 1638, from Tring in
Hardfordshire, was one of those early baptists. I find by the records that he
was received a free man that year. His son Benjamin was long a useful member of
the baptist church in Boston, and he has left a numerous posterity, one of whom
has been School-Marster and Town Clerk in Charlestown for sund^y years past.
Twenty years before Mr. Cobbet had called their so doings a profane trick:
And what their dealings were, which are here covered under the obscure term
cogency, will presently be seen. It was such that a number drew off and met by
themselves in Charlestown, till on May 28th, 1665; Thomas Gould, Thomas
Osburne, Edward Drinker, and John George, were baptized, and joined with
Richard Goodall, William Turner, Robert Lambert, Mary Goodall, and Mary Newel,
"in a solemn covenant, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to walk in
fellowship and communion together, in the practice of all the holy appointments
of Christ, which he had, or should further make known to them." Goodall came
recommended from Mr. Kiffen's church in London; Turner and Lambert from Mr.
Stead's church in Dartmouth, having been regular walkers in the baptist order
before they came to this country. Gould and Osburne separated from the church
in Charlestown; Drinker and George had lived many years in this country, but
had not joined to any of their churches. Their church records -- Russell's
narrative, p. 1, 2.


THE king's commissioners being here, caused the court not to lay hold of these
people so soon as otherwise they might have done. But in August a note was
entered in Roxbury church records, and published in an Almanac, which has been
communicated to me in these words, "The anabaptists gathered themselves into a
church, prophesied one by one, and some one among them administered the
Lord's Supper after he was regularly excommunicated by the church at
Charlestown, they also set up a lecture at Drinker's house once a fortnight."
As great noise was made about their receiving excommunicate members and
officers, it is proper to give that matter a distinct consideration here. Dr.
Mather tells of this church being formed, "not only with a manifest violation
of the laws in the commonwealth, relating to the orderly manner of gathering a
church, but also with a manifold provocation unto the rest of our churches, by
admitting into their own society such as our churches had excommunicated for
moral scandals, yea, and employing such persons to be administrators of the two
sacraments among them." Magnalia, Book 7. p. 27.


THEY would thus represent as though that church had many such members and
officers, whereas in fifteen years, among fourscore baptist members, they have
not named but four excommunicate persons, and but one of them an officer, viz.
Thomas Gould, who with Thomas Osburne were of the first members; and as the
impartial reader would be willing to hear both sides upon it, I will give him
their story in their own words.

MR. Samuel Willard of Boston, who wrote against this church, says of Thomas
Gould, "1 Though he was first called to an account about witholding his child
from baptism, yet that was not the reason of his being admonished, nor because
he could not be convinced of error; nor yet did the church proceed to
admonition, till such time as he (not only spoke contemptuously and
irreligiously of the emptiness and nullity of that ordinance, but also) used
unbecoming gestures in the time of administration, of which (being asked the
reason) he (before the congregation) acknowledged they were to cast disrespect
upon it: nor then neither till after much patience. 2 At his first admonition
he was not sententially suspended, but only desired, for preventing of the
offense of some, to abstain from coming to the other sacrament. 3 Upon this
Thomas Gould took up a trade of absenting himself from the meetings of the
church to worship God on the sabbath, which made a new offense. 4 The church in
much tenderness waited upon him, and proceeded not to excommunication, but
tried with admonition upon admonition, and that by the space of seven or eight
years: nor was he excommunicated, till (having left his own) he joined to
another society, without the churches leave, or once asking it: and now also
being twice sent for by the church, he disclaimed their authority over him. 5
Thomas Gould did not leave the church at Charlestown on the account of the
anabaptists new church (as is pretended) but had many years before renounced
his submission to that church. 6 He did (while under admonition) neglect public
worship, and gather a private meeting on the sabbath to his house. 7 He did
wickedly slight the admonition of the church, declaring that they had by it,
discharged him of all relation to them.

"FOR Thomas Osburne; the churches proceedings with him were with the like
patience as to Thomas Gould: only it is to be observed, that his first offense
was this; whereas it is one thing which church members engage to upon admission
to walk with the church in constant attendance upon public worship, he (without
notifying any offense) did withdraw and separate, frequenting those schismatic
meetings at Gould's on the sabbath: this was the offense, nor did he when first
dealt with pretend any dislike of infant baptism, but that the church gave no
liberty to private brethren to prophecy, that they limited the ministry to
learned men, and that he did not find his own spirit free to come; though
afterward he spoke both of that, and of their severity to the Quakers, though
that church meddled not with them, but to preach against their errors. In this
practice he con^umaciously persisted many years, denying himself to be subject
to that church, or bound to assembl^ with them, slighting many admonitions; and
afterward (with Thomas Gould) went off to, and became a worthy pillar of an
anabaptist church." Willard's answer to Russell, p. 13, 14. Note, Richard
Russell, says one of their magistrates, was a member of Charlestown church, and
did not he act against the Quaker^s.
This is the pedobabtist's story; Mr. Gould has given us his in the words
following

"IT having been a long time a scruple to me about infant baptism, God was
pleased at last to make it clear to me by the rule of the gospel, that children
were not capable nor fit subjects for such an ordinance, because Christ gave
this commission to his apostl^s, first to preach, to make them disciples, and
then to baptize them, which infants were not capable of; so that I durst not
bring forth my child to be partaker of it; so looking that my child had no
right to it, which was in the year 1655 when the Lord was pleased to give me a
child; I staid some space of time and said nothing to see what the church would
do with me. On a third day of the week when there was a meeting at my house, to
keep a day of thanksgiving to God for his mercy shown to my wife, at that time
one coming to the meeting, brought a note from the elders of the church to this
effect, that they desired me to come down on the morrow to the elders house,
and to send word again what time of that day I would come, and they would stay
at home for me; and if I could not come that day to send them word. I looking
on the writing with many friends with me, I told them I had promised to go
another way on the morrow. Master Dunstan I suppose Mr. Henry Dunstar.
being present desired me to send them word, that I could not come on the
morrow, but that I would come any other time that they would appoint me; and so
I sent word back by the same messenger. The fifth day, meeting with elder Green
I told him how it was; he told me it was well, and that they would appoint
another day when he had spoken with the pastor, and then they would send me
word. This lay about two months, before I heard any more from them. On a first
day in the afternoon one told me I must stop for the church would speak with
me. They called me out, and master Sims told the church, that this brother did
withhold his child from baptism, and that they had sent unto him to come down
on such a day to speak with them, and if he could not come on that day to set a
day when he would be at home, but he refusing to come, would appoint no time,
when we writ to him to take his own time, and send us word.

"I REPLIED, That there was no such word in the letter, for me to appoint the
day; but what time that day I should come. Mr. Sims stood up and told me, I aid
lie, for they sent to me to appoint the day. I replied again that there was no
such thing in the letter. He replied again, that they did not set down a time,
and not a day, therefore he told me it was a lie, and that they would leave my
judgment, and deal with me for a lie; and told the church that he and the
elder agreed to write, that if I could not come that day, to appoint the time
when I could come, and that he read it, after the elder writ is, and the elder
affirmed it was so, but I still replied, there was no such thing in the letter,
and thought I could produce the letter. They bid me let them see the letter, or
they would proceed against me for a lie. Brother Thomas Wilder, sitting before
me, stood up and told them, that it was so in the letter as I said, for he read
it when it came to me. But they answered, it was not so, and bid him produce
the letter, or they would proceed with me. He said, I think I can produce the
letter, and forthwith took it out of his pocket, which I wondered at; and I
desired him to give it to Mr. Russell to read, and so he did, and he read it
very faithfully, and it was just as I had said, that I must send them word what
time of that day I would come down: so that their mouths were stoped, and
master Sims put it off, and said he was mistaken, for he thought he had read it
otherwise; but the elder said, this is nothing, let us proceed with him for
his judgment. Now let any man judge what a fair beginning this was, and if you
wait a while you may see as fair an ending. They called me forth to know why I
would not bring my child to baptism. But before I speak to that, observe the
providence of God in the carriage of this letter-Brother Wilder was with us
when their letter come to my house, and after Mr. Dunstan had read it, he gave
it to brother Wilder, and he put it into his pocket, and it lay there eight or
nine week's, till that day, I was called forth, going a good space from his
house, finding it too cold to go in the clothes he had on, returned again and
put on another pair of breeches which were warmer, and when he had so done, put
his hand into his pocket to see if he had any paper to write with, and there
found that letter, and put it in again and went to meeting, yet not knowing
what would be done that day concerning me. God had so appointed it, to stop
their sirece proceedings against me for a lie, which they sought to take me in.
Then asking me why I did not bring my child to baptism, my answer was, I did
not see any rule of Christ for it, for that ordinance belongs to such as can
make profession of their faith, as the scripture does plainly hold forth. --
They answered me that was meant of grown persons and not of children: but that
which was most alleged by them was, that children were capable of circumcision
in the time of the law, and therefore as capable in the time of the gospel of
baptism; and asked me why children were not to be baptized in the time of the
gospel, as well as children were circumcised in the time of the law? My answer
was, God gave a strict command in the law for the circumcision of children; but
we have no command in the gospel, nor example, for the baptizing of children.
Many other things were spoken, then a meeting was appointed by the church the
next week at Mr Russel's.

"BEING met at Mr. Russel's house, Mr. Sims took a writing out of his pocket
wherein he had drawn up many arguments for infants baptism, and told the church
that I must answer those arguments, which I suppose he had drawn from some
author; and told me I must keep to those arguments. My answer was, I thought
the church had met together to answer my scruples, and to satisfy my conscience
by a rule of God, and not for me to answer his writing. He said he had drawn it
up for the help of his memory, and desired we might go on. Then I requested
three things of them. 1st That they should not make me offender for a word. 2d.
They should not drive me faster than I was able to go. 3d. That if any present
should see cause to clear up any thing that is spoken by me, they might have
their liberty without offense; because here are many of you that have their
liberty to speak against me if you see cause. But it was denied, and Mr. Sim's
was pleased to reply, that he was able to deal with me himself, and that I know
it. So we spent four or five hours speaking to many things to and again; but so
hot both sides that we quickly forgot and went from the arguments that were
written. At last one of the company stood up and said, I will give you one
plain place of scripture where children were baptized. I told him that would
put an end to the controversy. That place in the second of the Acts 39th, 40th
verses. After he had read the scripture, Mr. Sims told me that promise belonged
to infants, for the scripture says, The promise is to you and your children,
and to all that are af^^r off; and he said no more: to which I replied, Even so
many as the Lord our God shall call. Mr. Sims replied, that I spoke
blasphemously in adding to the scriptures. I said, pray do not comdemn me, for
if I am deceived, my eyes deceive me. He replied again, I added to the
scripture which was blasphemy. I looking into my bible read the words again,
and said it was so. He replied the same words the third time before the church.
Mr. Russell stood up and told him it was so as I had read it. Ay, it may be so
in your bible, says Mr. Sims. Mr. Russell answered, yea in yours too if you
will look into it. Then he said he was mistaken, for he thought on another
place; so after many other words we broke up for that time.

"AT another meeting the church required me to bring out my child to baptism. I
told them I durst not do it, for I did not see any rule, for it in the word of
God. They brought many places of scripture in the old and new testament, as
circumcis^on and the promise to Abraham, and that children were holy, and they
were disciples. But I told them that all these places made nothing for infants
baptism. Then stood up W. D. in the church and said, Put him in the court! Put
him in the court! But Mr. Sims answered, I pray forbear such words; but it
proved so, for presently after they put me in the court, and put me in seven or
eight courts, whilst they looked upon me to be a member of their church. The
elder pressed the church to lay me under admonition, which the church was
backward to do. Afterward I went out at the sprinkling of children which was a
great trouble to some honest hearts, and they told me of it. But I told them I
could not stay, for I looked upon it as no ordinance of Christ. They told me
that now I had made known my judgment I might stay, for they know I did not
join with them. So I stayed and sat down in my seat when they were at prayer
and administering that service to infants. Then they dealt with me for my
unreverent carriage -- one stood up and accused me, that I stoped my cars; but
I denied it.

"AT another meeting they asked me if I would suffer the church to fetch my
child and baptize it? I answered, if they would fetch my child and do it as
their own act they might do it; but when they should bring my child I would
make known to the congregation that I had no hand in it: then some of the
church were against doing of it. A brother stood up and said, Brother Gould,
you were once for childrens baptism, why are you fallen from it? I answered, It
is true, and I suppose you were once for crossing in baptism, why are you
fallen from that? the man was silent: But Mr. Sims stood up in a great heat,
and desired the church to take notice of it, that I compared the ordinance of
Christ to the cross in baptism! this was one of the great offenses they dealt
with me for. After this the deputy governor Mr. Bellingham, who was chief
governor, when Mr. Gould was banished, in 1663.
meeting me in Boston, called me to him and said, Goodman Gould, I desire you
that you would let the church baptize your child. I told him that if the church
would do it upon their own account they should do it, but I durst not bring out
my child. So he called to Mrs. Norton of Charlestown and prayed her to fetch
Goodman Gould's child and baptize it. So she spoke to them, but not rightly,
informing them, she gave them to understand that I would bring out my child.
They called me out again and asked me if I would bring forth my child? I told
them no, I durst not do it, for I see no rule for it. One of the brethren stood
up and said, If I would not let my child partake of one ordinance, it was meet
I should not partake of the other; so many of the church concluded to lay me
under admonition; but before they did it Mr. Sims told me, It was more
according to rule for me to withdraw from the ordinance, than for them to put
me by; bringing that place of scripture, If thou bring thy gift to the alter,
and there rememberest that thy brother has ought against thee, leave there thy
offering and he reconciled first to thy brother. But I told them, I did not
know that my brother had any thing justly against me; for they had not shown me
any rule of Christ that I had broken, therefore durst not withdraw from that
ordinance that I had found so much of God in; but if they would put me by I
hoped God would feed my soul another way. So they proceeded to admonition.
Elder Green Mr. Green as I take it, was ruling elder; Mr. Zechariah Sims, was
teaching elder.
said, Brother Gould you are to take notice that you are admonished for three
things; the first is, that you refused to bring your child to be baptized; the
second is, for your contentious words, and unreverent carriage in the time of
that ordinance; the third is, for a late lie you told, and therefore you are to
take notice, that you are not to partake any more of the ordinance of Christ
with us, till you give satisfaction for these things. But when that late lie
was told I know not, except it was when the letter was found in brother
Wilder's pocket. This admonition was between seven and eight years before they
cast me out. After this I went to Cambridge meeting, which was as near to my
house as the other; upon that they put me into the court, that I did not come
to hear; but many satisfied the court that I did come constantly to Cambridge;
so they cleared me. Then the church called me to account and dealt with me for
schism, that I rent from the church. I told them, I did not rend from them, for
they put me away. Master Sims was very earnest for another admonition for
schism, which most of the church were against; but it seems he set it down for
an admonition on a bit of paper. This continued for a long time before they
called me out again. In the mean time, I had some friends who came to me out of
old England, who were baptists, and desired to meet at my house of a first day,
which I granted: Of these was myself, my wife and Thomas Osburne, that were of
their church. Afterward they called me forth and asked why I kept the meeting
in private on the Lord's day, and did not come to the public? My answer was, I
know not what reason the church had to call me forth. They asked me if I was
not a member of that church? I told them they had not acted toward me as a
member, who had put me by the ordinances of Christ seven years ago -- they had
denied me the privileges of a member. They asked whether I looked upon
admonition as an appointment of Christ? I told them, yes, but not to lie un^er
it above seven years, and to be put by the ordinances of Christ in the church;
for the rule of Christ is first to deal with men in the first and in the second
place, and then in the third place before the church; but the first time that
ever they dealt with me, they called me before the whole church. Many meetings
we had about this thing, whether I was a member or not, but could come to no
conclusion; for I still affirmed that their actings rendered me no member. Then
Mr. Sims told the church that I was ripe for excommunication, and was very
earnest for it; but the church would not consent. Then I desired that we might
send to other churches for their help to hear the thing betwixt us; but master
Sims made me this answer, We are a church of Christ ourselves, and you shall
know that we have power to deal with you ourselves. Then said Mr. Russell, We
have not gone the right way to gain this our brother, for we have dealt too
harshly with him. But still master Sims pressed the church to excommunicate me.
Mr. Russell said, There were greater errors in the church in the apostles time
and yet they did not so deal with them. Mr. Sims asked him what they were? He
said, How say some of you that there is no resurrection of the dead? Mr. Sims
was troubled and said, I wonder you will bring this place of scripture to
encourage him in his error! Mr. Sims was earnest for another admonition; then
stood up Solomon Phips and said, you may clap one admonition on him upon
another, but to what end, for he was admonished about seven years ago? Mr. Sims
said, Brother! do you make such a light matter of admonition, to say, Clap them
one upon another! does not the apostle say, After the first and second
admonition reject an heretic? therefore there might be a second admonition. It
was answered, it was a hard matter to prove a man an heretic, for every error
does not make a man a heretic. Mr. Sims said, it was not seven years ago, nor
above three since I was admonished, and that was for schism. A brother replied
and said, it was seven years since I was admonished. On that there was some
difference in the church what I was admonished for. Mr. Sims then pulled a bit
of paper out of his pocket and said, This is that he was admonished for, and
that was but three years since. Brother Phips asked him when that paper was
writ, for he never heard of that admonition before? He answered, he set it down
for his own memory; then he read it, that it was for schism, and rending from
the church. I told him I did not rend from the church, but the church put me
away from them, and that was four years before this. Then there was much
aggitation when the admonition was given, and what it was for? And this was all
the church records that could be found, which was about seven years after, the
admonition was given; so after many words we broke up, which was the last time
we met together. Now let any man judge of the church records that were drawn up
against me, and read at the dispute in Boston, which contained three or four
sheets of paper; read by Mr. Shepard, Son to Mr. Thomas Shepard, formerly of
Cambridge.
and drawn up by him, a little while before the dispute, who was not an eye nor
ear witness to the churches actings, not above half the time.

"Now after this, considering with myself what the Lord would have me to do;
not likely to join with any of the churches of New England any more, and so to
be without the ordinances of Christ; in the mean time God sent out of Old
England who were baptists; we consulting together what to do, sought the Lord
to direct us, and taking counsel of other friends who ^dwelt among us, who were
able and godly, they gave us counsel to congregate ourselves together; and so
we did, being nine of us, to walk in the order of the gospel according to the
rule of Christ, yet knowing that is was a breach of the law of this country;
that we had not the approbation of magistrates and ministers, for that we
suffered the penalty of that law, when we were called before them. After we had
been called into one or two courts, the church understanding that we were
gathered into church order, they sent three messengers from the church to me,
telling me the church required me to come before them the next Lord's Day. I
replied, The church had nothing to do with me, for they had put me from them
eight years before. They replied, that they had nothing to do with that, but
were sent by the church to tell me it was the mind of the church to speak with
me. I told them I was joined to another church, and that church was not willing
I should come to them, they having nothing to do with me, therefore I would not
come without the churches consent; then they departed. The next week they sent
three messengers more, who came to my house and told me that the church had
sent them to require me to come to the church the next Lord's Day after. I told
them that the church had nothing to do to require me to come, who had put me
from them eight years, and the church I now walked with would not let me come.
They told me again that if I did not come, the church would proceed against me
the next Lord's Day. I told them that I could not come for we were to break
bread the next Lord's Day. They told me they would return my answer to the
church. One of them asked if I would come the next Lord's Day after? But
another presently said, We have no such order from the church; so they
departed. The last day of that week three loving friends coming to me of their
own account, one of them was pleased to say to me, Brother Gould, though you
look upon it as unjust for them to cast you out, yet there be many that are
godly among them that will act with them through ignorance, which will be a few
of them, and you are persuaded I believe that it is your duty to prevent any
one from any sinful act; for they will cast you out for not hearing the church;
now your coming will stop them from acting against you, and so keep many from
that sin. Upon these words I was clearly convinced that it was my duty to go,
and replied, Although I could not come the next day, yet I promised them that
if I was alive and well I would come the next Lord's Day if the Lord permit. He
replied, What if the church I was joined to was not willing? I told him I did
not question that any one would be against it upon this ground. After I had
propounded it to the church, not one was against it. I entreated these friends
to make it known to the elders that I would come to them the next Lord's Day
after: Yet though they knew of it, they proceeded against me that day, and
delivered me up to Satan for not hearing the church."

THIS narrative I met with among Mr. Callender's papers, and have good reason
to think it genuine, and that the manuscript now in my hands was written above
a hundred years ago, which I have copied that the public may be better able to
judge of what those excomunications were. It appears by Mr. Willard, that the
first charge they had against Mr Osburne, was his going to meeting with that
schismatical Gould; therefore, as the reader judges of the one, so likely he
will of the other. Only it ought to be noted, that neither of them were
excommunicate persons, when they formed that baptist church, but had that
sentance pronounced upon them, and afterward for refusing to return to those,
who had treated them so ill. And before that act, viz on August 20, 1665.
Richard Russell, Esquire; issued a warrant to the constable of Charlestown, the
original whereof is now before me, requiring him in his majesty's name, to
labor to discover where these people were assembled, and to require them to
attend the established worship, which if they refused, he was to return their
names and places of abode to the next magistrate. In consequence whereof they
were brought before the court of assistants in September: to whom they
exhibited a confession of their faith, which is copied into their records. The
only article of which, that I find objected against is in these words, viz.
"Christ's commission to his disciples is to teach and baptize, and those who
gladly receive the word and are baptized, are saints by calling, and fit matter
for visible church. This was complained of as excluding all from a visible
saint-ship but baptized persons, which we shall hereafter see they had no
thought of. But their grand crime lay in not obeying the fuling party in their
religious affairs.

THE court of assistants charged them to desist from what they called their
schismatical practice; and because they would not, the general court that met
Oct. 11, convented Gould, Turner, Osburne, Drinker and George before them, to
whom these baptists exhibited the same confession as they had to the court of
assistants, which was closed with saying, "If any take this to be heresy, then
do we with the apostle confess, that after the way which they call heresy, we
worship God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, believing all things that are
written in the law and the prophets and apostles." Which the court called a
"contemning the authority and laws here established, for the maintenance of
godliness and honesty, as well as continuing in the profanation of God's holy
ordinances; (and said) This court taking the premises into their serious
consideration, do judge meet to declare, that the said Gould and compa^y, are
no orderly church assembly, and that they stand justly convicted of high
presumption against the Lord and his holy appointment, as also the peace of
this government, against which this court ^^th account themselves bound to God,
his truth and his churches here planted, to bear their testimony, and do
therefore sentence the said Thomas Gould, William Turner, Thomas Osburne,
Edward Drinker and John George, such of them as are freemen, to be
dissfranchied, and all of them, upon conviction before any one magistrate or
court, of their further proceeding herein, to be committed to prison until the
general court shall take further order with them. Zechariah Rhodes, being in
court when they were proceeding against Thomas Gould and company, and saying in
court, The court has not to do in matters of religion: he was committed; being
sent for he acknowledged his fault, declaring he was sorry he had given them
offense. The court judged meet to discharge him, the governor giving him an
admonition for his said offense." Massachusett's records. Rhodes was a baptist,
but ^ad ^een of Ar^^^^^ p^^ty at Pawtu^et. Massachusett's history vol. 3, p.
277,


CAN any man believe that these were measures to promote either godliness or
honesty, in Rhodes, o^ in any one else? rather did not the court take Jehovah's
name in vain in this act! The forementioned excuse, made by Dr. Mather, for
this severity, viz. their joining in church fellowship without the approbation
of other (...) and their rulers, says Mr. Neal, "conditions all the dissenting
congregations that have b^^^ gathered in England, since the act of uniformity
in the year 1662 -- Let the reader judge, who had most reason to complain; the
New England churches, who would neither suffer the baptists to live quietly in
their communion, nor separate peacably from it? or these unhappy persons who
were treated so unkindly for following the light of their consciences." Neal's
History of New England, vol 1. P. 304, ^^^.
Yet because they still followed that light, they were presented to the county
court at Cambridge, April 17, 1666, "for absenting themselves from the public
worship." And when they asserted that they did steadi^y attend such worship,
the forgoing act of the assembly was produced to prove that it was not in a
lawful way; and Gould, Osburne and George, were each or them fined four pounds
therefore, and ordered to bind themselves in a bond of twenty pounds apiece, for
their appearance at the next court of assistants; and refusing so to do were
committed to prison. Mass. hist. vol. 3, p. 400, 401.
When the court of assistants came they gave sentance that they should pay
their sines and court charges; and when the assembly sat on Sept. 11, they
ordered, that if they would pay the same, they should be set at liberty; but
added that, "the order of court of October 1665, refering to the said
schismatical assembly, shall be, and hereby is declared to stand in full
force." Mass. Records.
Thus they went on from time to time, till the court of assistants at Boston,
March 3, who adjourned to May 1, 1668, passed the following act, a copy of
which I find among their church papers, exactly in these words, viz.

"Thomas Gould plaintiff, on appeal from the judgment of the last county court
at Charlestown. After the courts judgment reasons of appeal, and evidences in
the case produced were read, committed to the jury, and remain on files with
the records of this court. The jury brought in their verdict, they found for
the plaintiff, reversion of the former judgment. The court not accepting this
verdict, commended it to the jury's further consideration, and sent them out
again. And at the adjournment, on the further consideration, they brought in a
special verdict, i. e. If the intent of this law, that the appallent is accused
of the breach of, be that the presentment of the grand jury, without their
certain knowledge, or other evidence, or the person so complained of is legally
convicted of the breach of the law, thereby he not making it appear he had done
his duty; then they confirmed the judgment of the former court at Charlestown,
but if otherwise they acquit the appellant. The court, on a due consideration
of this special verdict, do confirm the judgment of the county court at
Charlestown. This judgment was declared, and on the plaintiff's refusal to pay
the fine imposed, was committed to prison."

ON the 7th of this March, they also said, "The governor and council,
accounting themselves bound by the law of God, and of this commonwealth, to
protect the churches of Christ here planted, from the intrusion thereby made
upon their peace in the ways of godliness, yet being willing by all christian
candor to endeavor the reducing of the said persons from the error of their
way, and their return to the Lord and the communion of his people from whence
they are fallen, do judge meet to grant unto Thomas Gould, John Fa^num, Thomas
Osburne and company, yet further an opportunity of a full and full and free
debate, of their grounds for their practice; and for that end this court does
nominate and request the Rev. Mr. John Allen, Mr. Thomas Cobbet, Mr. John
Higginson, Mr. Samuel Danforth, Mr. Jonathan Mitchel, and Mr Thomas Shepard, to
assemble with the governor and magistrates upon the 14th day of the next month,
in the meeting house at Boston, at nine in the morning; before whom, (...) so
many of them, with any other the Reverend elders or ministers, as shall then
assemble, the abovesaid persons and their company shall have liberty, freely
and fully in open assembly, to present their grounds as abovesaid, in an
orderly debate of this following question: whether it be justifiable by the
word of God, for these persons and their company to depart from the communion
of these churches, and to set up an assembly here in the way of anabaptism, and
whether such a practice is to be allowed by the government of this
jurisdiction? -- To Thomas Gould: you are hereby required in his majesty's
name, according to the order of the council above-written, to give notice
thereof to John Farnum, Senior, Thomas Osburne, and the company, and you and
they are alike required to give your attendance, at the time and place,
abovementioned, for the end therein expressed.

EDWARD RAWSON, Secratary." Copied from the warrant now before (...) Mr.
Rawson's hand writing.


MR. Clarke's church in Newport, hearing of this appointment, sent to the
assistance of their brethren, Mr. William Hiscox, Mr. Joseph Tory and Mr.
Samuel Hubbard, who arrived at Boston three days before the dispute. The author
o^ Mr. Mitchel's life says, "when the churches were troubled by a strong
attempt upon them from the the spirit of anabaptism, there was a public
disputation appointed at Boston, two days together, for the clearing of the
faith in that article; this worthy man was he, who did most service in this
disputation; whereof the effect was, that although the erring brethren, as is
usual in such cases, made this their last answer to the arguments, which had
cast them into much confusion, say what you will, we will hold our minds! Yet
others were happily established in the right ways of the Lord." How well this
corresponds with the preceding pages, the reader may judge. For therein we are
informed, that Mr. Mitchel was fearful of going to a learned gentleman who had
renounced infant baptism; and that he resolved that he would have an argument
able to remove a mountain, before he would recede from that principle, His
life, p. 69, 79, 72. The dispute was held both the 1^th and 15th of April.
And a look back to our p. 226, will show what fear the ruling party had, of
disputing upon their way with another learned baptist; but the whole power of
the country now adventured to enter the list with a few honest mechanics.

WHEN the assembly met at Boston in May following, they proceeded to the next
argument, and said, -- "Whereas the council in March last did, for their
further conviction, appoint a meeting of diverse elders, and required the said
persons to attend the said meeting, which was held in Boston with a great
concourse of people. -- This court, being sensible of their duty to God and the
country, and being desirous that their proceedings in this great cause might be
clear and regul^^^, do order that the said Gould and company he required to
appear before this court, on the seventh instant, at eight in the morning, that
the court may understand from themselves, whether upon the means used, or other
considerations, they have altered their former declared resolution, and are
willing to desist from their former offensive practice, that accordingly a mete
effectual remedy may be applied to 10 dangerous a malady, At the time they made
their appearance and after the court had heard what they had to say for
themselves, proceeded. Whereas Thomas Gould, William Turner, and John Farnum,
Senior, obstinate and turbulent anabaptists, have some time since combined
themselves with others in a pretended church estate, without the knowledge and
approbation of the authority here established, to the great grief and offense
of the godly orthodox; the said persons did in open court, assert their former
practice to have been according to the mind of God, that nothing that they had
heard convinced them to the contrary; which practice, being also otherwise
circumstanced with making infant baptism a nullity, and thereby making us all
to be unbaptized persons, and so consequently no regular churches, ministry or
ordinances; as also renouncing all our churches, as being so bad and corrupt
that they are not fit to be held communion with; denying to submit to the
government of Christ in the church, and entertaining of those who are under
church censure, thereby making the discipline of Christ to be of none effect,
and manifestly tending to the disturbance and destruction of these churches --
opening the door for all sorts of abominations to come in among us, to the
disturbance not only of ecclesiastical enjoyments, but also contempt of our
civil order, and the authority here established -- which duty to God and the
country does oblige us to prevent, by using the most compassionate effectual
means to attain the same; all which considering, together with the danger of
disseminating their errors, and encourageing presumptuous irregularities by
their example, should they continue in this jurisdiction; this court do judge
it necessary that they be removed to some other part of this country, or
elsewhere, and accordingly does order, that the said Thomas Gould, William
Turner and John Farnum, Senior, do before the 20th of July next remove
themselves out of this jurisdiction, and that if after the said 20th of July
either of them be found in any part of this jurisdiction, without license had
from this court or the council, he or they shall be forthwith apprehended and
committed to prison by warrant from any magistrate, and there remain without
bail or main prise, until he or they shall give sufficient security to the
governor or any magistrate, immediately to depart the jurisdiction, and not to
return as abovesaid. And all constables and other officers, are required to be
faithful and diligent in the execution of this sentance. And it is further
ordered, that the keepers of all prisons whereto the said Thomas, or any of
them shall be committed, shall not permit any resort of companies of more than,
two at one time to any of the said persons. And our experience of their high
obstinate and presumptuous carriage, does engage us to prohibit them any
further meeting together, on the Lord's day, or other days, upon pretense of
their church estate, or for the administration or exercise of any pretended
ecclesiastical functions, or dispensation of the seals or preaching; wherein,
if they shall be taken offending, they shall be imprisoned until the tenth of
July next, and then left at their liberty within ten days to depart the
jurisdiction upon penalty as aforesaid. And whereas Thomas Gould is committed
to prison in the county of Middlesex, by the last court of assistants, for
nonpayment of a fine imposed, this court judges it meet, after the sentance of
this court is published this day after the lecture to them, that the said Gould
shall be discharged from imprisonment in Middlesex as to his fine, that so he
may have time to prepare to submit to the judgment of this court." Mass.
Records.


THIS looked like a powerful way of arguing; but the baptists were not
convinced by it, either of its being duty to return into fellowship with those
who managed the argument, or to quit their stations and enjoyments at their
command. I find by the colony records, that John Farnum was admitted a freeman
of that colony May 13, 1640; Thomas Gould, June 2, 1641; in which year John
George bound himself to governor Winthrop, I suppose to pay for his passage
over to this country. And I have a copy before me of a warrant for the
commitment of Turner and Farnum to Boston Goal, dated July 30 this year, signed
by governor Bellingham, Eleazer Lusher and Edward Tyng. When the assembly met
again in the fall, a petition was presented to them whereof a copy found among
their church papers, is before me, in these words.

"WHEREAS by the censure of this honorable court Thomas Gould, William Turner
and John Farnum, now lie in prison deprived of their liberty, taken off from
their callings, separated from their wives and children, disabled to govern or
to provide for their families, to their great damage and hastening ruin, how
innocent soever; beside the hazard of their own lives, being aged and weakly
men, and needing that succor a prison will not afford; the sense of this,
their personal and family most deplorable and afflicted condition, has sadly
affected the hearts of many sober and serious christians, and such as neither
approve of their judgment or practice; especially considering that the men are
reputed godly, and of a blameless conversation; and the things for which they
seem to suffer seem not to be moral, unquestioned, scandalous evils, but
matters of religion and conscience; not in things fundamental, plain and clear,
but circumstantial, more dark and doubtful, wherein the saints are wont to
differ, and to forbear one another in love, that they be not exposed to sin, or
to suffer for conscience sake. We therefore most humbly beseech this honored
court, in their christian mercy and bowels of compassion, to pity and relieve
these poor prisoners; whose sufferings (also being doubtful to many, and some
of great worth among ourselves, and grievous to sundry of God's people at home
and abroad, may crave a further consideration) whereby perceiving this court
not likely to effect the end desired, but rather to grieve the hearts of God's
people: Now your wisdoms may be pleased to think of some better expedient, and
seriously consider whether an indulgence, justifiable by the word of God,
pleaded for and practiced by congregational churches, may not, in this day of
suffering to the people of God, be more effectual, safe and inoffensive than
other ways, which are always grievous, and seldom find success. We in all
humility hope, hereby occasions of difference being removed, that love and
communion among all saints, which our dying Lord so weightily charged and
earnestly prayed for, will more easily be preserved and practiced, to the glory
of God, honor of the gospel, peace and welfare of all the churches, which this
honored court being the happy instruments of effecting, will oblige your poor
petitioners, as in duty bound, to pray for your happiness both in this life and
in that to ^ome, and that your authority may be long continued as an unparalled
blessing to this commonwealth."

WE are informed that Capt. Edward Hutchinson, Capt. Oliver, and many others
signed this petition; but the Court were so far from granting it, that the
chief promoters of it were fined, and others compelled to an acknowledgment of
their fault in reflecting upon the Court herein. We are also told, that the
Hon. Francis Willoughby, who was their deputy Governor from 1665, till he died
on April 4, 1671, "was a great opposer of these persecutions against the
baptists." Mass. hist. vol. p. 227, 269.
Leveret and Symonds, his successors in that office, appear also to have been
on that side of the question. The ruling party printed their sentance against
those baptists, and answer to which I find among their church papers, which is
closed with these words. "This my husband would entreat of you, to take counsel
of master Bennet, and if he and you judge (...) mete, to send it to England,
and the printed sentance with it. It is desired that no man see it but goodman
Sweetser, and that Josiah write it fair and plain." I conclude the person here
speaking is elder Gould's wife; and the most material points of her answer are
as follows:

"FIRST, They call them obstinate and turbulent anabaptists. 1. I desire to
know wherein their obstinacy does appear? They desired the court to show them,
from the rule of Christ, of any point that they were out of the way of God; and
if the Lord was pleased to show them wherein they were out, they would freely
lay it down; but they showed them no other rule than their own law; and
sentanced them to be fined and imprisoned; and this was all the rule they could
give, which did not convince them. 2. They say they were turbulent: I desire
them to prove wherein they were turbulent, when they did not disturb neither
churches nor courts, neither by word nor by action; but desired to live quietly
and peaceably among them, and they cannot tell of any one thing that they
disturbed them in, but desired they might enjoy that liberty that Christ has
purchased for them. They know not that they spoke any word that gave offense to
the court, unless it was those few words, when master Bradstreet pronounced
that sentance against them, and charged them no more to meet together, whether
on the Lord's day or on the weekdays, in their conventicles; those words were
returned by them, We ought to obey God rather than man; we cannot but do the
things that we have heard and learned. 3. As for anabaptists, they do not own
that name, except they will be pleased to explain what they mean by it; for
they own them to be of the baptized. Again they say, they combined together in
a pretended church estate. They need not have said so, unless they could have
proved they set up their church contrary to a rule of Christ. Beside, they gave
them in a writing wherein they gave a brief account of their faith, where they
declared what they owned to be a church of Christ, and the order of it
according to the rule of the scripture, which neither the court nor the elders
ever answered to this day. They say it was without the knowledge or approbation
of the authority here established as the law required. Answer, 1. If the
apostles had not set up churches in their time, without the approbation of the
authority and their priests, there had been few or no churches in their time.
2. Christ is Lord and King of his church, and he will set up his government
therein, and has given them rules from himself, how to set it up and to carry
it along according to his appointment, and not to ask leave of the powers of
the word to set up his church; for Christ's jurisdiction is the reatest
jurisdiction ^n the world. 3. They had askged leave, had they found a command
of Christ for it, but finding no rule of Christ they did not do it.

"AGAIN, they say some of themselves were excommunicated persons. First, it is
true what they say, yet that some was but two that were cast out, and that
after they were gathered into this pretended church, as they call it, a good
space of time. But consider for what it was, and how it was? [Hear the
foregoing account of Mr. Gould and Osburne is confirmed. And of the day they
were cast out she says,] The word was carried to the elder, that if they were
alive and well they would come the next day, yet they were so hot upon it that
they would not stay, but master Sims, when he was laying out the sins of these
men, before he had propounded it to the church, to know their mind, the church
having no liberty to speak, he wound it up in his discourse, and delivered them
up to satan, to the amazment of the people, that ever such an ordinance of
Christ should be so abused, that many of the people went out: and these were
the excommunicated persons. They say, after long forbearence to use the utmost
mean^ convince and reduce them, entreated the assistance of to diverse elders.
Answer 1. It is true there were seven elders appointed to discourse with them,
and there were a few plowman and tailors to come before: but how they were
served with a warrant to appear before these elders in his Majest'ys name! 2.
When they were met, there was a long speech made by one of them, of what vile
persons they were and how they acted against the churches and government here,
and stood condemned by the court. The other desiring liberty to speak, they
would not suffer them, but told them they stood there as delinquents, and ought
not to have liberty to speak. Then they desired they might choose a moderator
as well as they: they denied them. Two days were spent to little purpose -- in
the close, master Jonathan Mitchel pronounced that dreadful sentance against
them in Deuteronomy. xvii, 8. to the end of the 12th, and this was the way they took
to convince them, and you may see what a good effect it had -- There was
nothing spoken from the rule of Christ, neither from the court nor the elders,
but such sentances as these, fineing, and whipping, and prisoning, and
banishing, and master Mitchel's sentance, and all these are not the weapons of
Christ, but carnal weapons that never did convince any soul of the error of his
ways.

"WHEREAS they say, which practice making infant baptism a nullity, etc. I
answer, it is good for every one to be sure that they are upon good ground
whatsoever the practice of others may seem to condemn -- They say, tending to
the disturbance and destruction of these churches. For answer, 1. If eight or
nine poor anabaptists, as they call them, should be the destruction of their
churches, then let any seeing man judge what their churches are built upon;
then we may think they are built upon a sandy foundation; for the church of
Christ is built upon himself, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against
it. 2. If they be the churches of Christ, and think they shall be overthrown by
them, it is from the weakness of their faith, looking more to an arm flesh and
powers of the world to uphold them, than to Christ and his faithful promise. 3.
If they fear they will be the destruction of their churches, now all the power
of the country is for them and have an arm of flesh to help them, what will
they do when all the powers of the country are against them, as are against the
other, as you say yourselves of them, that when they were in examination before
the court, they professed themselves resolved to adhere to the same practice;
and now suffer willingly for it. But for the men, what they are I shall say
nothing, for the sixty-five hands to the petition that was put into the general
Court, does plainly declare to their best discerning, that they have been
honest and godly, and lived quietly and peacably among them a good length of
time. Again they say, by using the most compassionate and effectual means to
attain the same. Answer, 1. The Lord keep every gracious soul from such
compassionate means for the truth of the gospel! 2. For what compassionate
means were used with them, let men fearing God judge; for one of them was
called from prison when this sentance of banishment was read against them; and
if any man desires to inform himself wherein their compassion appears, let him
read their printed sentance against them, which was executed upon them; for not
moving themselves, they sent the constaable, and fetch them away to prison on a
public lecture day at Boston, when the said Thomas Gould, William Turner and
John Farnum, had been all there, and newly come home to their houses, and they
remain in prison to this day."

How any that feared God, could be ensnared and held in such a way of treating
their follow servants, may doubtless appear unaccountable to many; but a
careful search will help us to discover the nature of this mystery. The
establishment of christian commonwealth, was the grand object that had been
before those leaders for forty years, and it continued so to their last hours.
Mr. Wilson, the first minister of Boston, had been famed for a gist of
prophecy, or foreteling future events; and as his dissolution appeared near, a
large number (...) ministers came round him on May 16, 166^, and desired him to
declare unto them, what he conceived to be the sins among them that caused the
displeasure of God against the country, he told them he had long feared the
following sins as chief among others, which greatly provoked God, viz. " 1
Separation. 2. Anabaptism. 3. Corahism, when people rise up as Corah, against
their ministers or elders, as if they took too much upon them, when indeed they
do but rule for Christ, and according to Christ; yet (said he) it is nothing
for a brother to stand up, and oppose without scripture or reason, the doctrine
and word of the elder, saying I am not satisfied, etc. and hence, if he do not
like the administration, be it baptism or the like, he will turn his back upon
God and his ordinances, and go away. And for our neglect or baptising the
children of the church, those that some call grandchildren, I think God is
provoked by it. 4. Another sin I take to be the making light of, not subjecting
to the authority of synods without which, the churches cannot long subsist. And
so for the magistrates being Gallio like, either not careing for these things,
or else not using their power and authrity for the maintenance of the truth,
gospel and ordinances of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and for bearing
thorough witness against the contrary: should the Lord leave them hereunto, how
miserable a people should we be! [And at night he blessed them upon their
parting] with great affection, and with tears, and all the m^nisters wept with
him, and took their leave of him, even as children of their father, who having
blessed them was about to die."
And did so the the 7th of August following. Morron, p. 195, 196.
These things affected their minds in such a manner, that upon his church's
obtaining Mr. Devenport from New Haven to succeed him, who had printed his
testimony against the result of the late synod about the halfway covenant, a
minor part of the church drew off from the rest, and in May 1669 other
ministers assisted in forming them into a new church, in open separation from
the first church in Boston, which schism continued about fourteen years, till
an episcopal invader of their rights drove them together again. Magnalia, b. 5,
p 82, 83. "There was a great difference betwixt the old church and the members
of the new church, about b^ptism, and their members joining in full communion
with either church; this was so high that there was imprisoning of parties, and
great disturbances; but now hearing of my proposals for ministers to be sent
over, they are joined together, about a fortnight ago, and pray to God to
confound the devices of all who disturb their peace and liberties." Randolph's
letter to the bish^p of London, May 29, 1682. Mass. hist. v^l. 3, p. 532. That
(...) church is since called The old S^^th.
Hence see what a schismatical doctrine that is, of infants church membership,
and of using secular force in religious affairs. What divisions and contentions
did it produce both in Counecticut and the Massachusetts? And is it not evident
that they proceeded from a confounding of the Jewish and Christian churches
together? for a right to membership and to office, in the former, proceeded in
a natural, in the latter, in a spiritual line. The gainsaying of Korah was
after an infalliable authority had fixed the priesthood in the line of Aaron
and his seed, who were types of Christ and his saints; but officers in
distinction from the rest of the lively stone whereof his house is built, are
never called priests in the new testament: yea, we have seen ministers
resenting others calling of them by that name, and yet they in the above
instance and down to this day, have applied the case of Korah to those who
refuse practically to own them as such. And they have often told us of David's
error, in carrying the ark upon a new cart, instead of the priests shoulders;
but that error is theirs, not ours; and had they been as ready to immitate
David in reformation as they were in transgression what happy times might we
have seen before now? The oracles of God were then carried in the ark, but now
his church is the pillar and ground of the truth. 1 Timothy 13, 15, 1 Peter 2, 5.
Upon Uzza's being struck dead, David was turned to search the divine rules,
which taught him to rest the cause of truth upon living shoulders, instead of
an earthly machine drawn by beastly force: 1 Cor. 15, 2. But when the rulers of
the Massachusetts were moved by their ministers to exert such force against the
baptists, though they saw the chief procurers of that sentance struck dead
before the time came for its execution, and many more of them about that time,
yet their posterity have approved their sayings even to this day. Mr. Henry
^lint of Braintree, and Mr. Samuel Shepard of Rowley, died about the time of
their dispute with the baptists in Boston. Mr. Mitchel, who was most active in
procuring the sentance against them, died July 9, aged 43, an^ Mr John Eliot
jun'r, October 13, 1668, aged 35, both of Cambridge, Mr. John Reyner of Dover,
and Mr. Richard Mather of Dorchester both died in April, and Eleazer Mather of
Northampton on July 24, 1669, aged 32. Mr. Sims, who had treated the baptists
so ill, and Mr. John Allen of Dedham, one of the disputants against them, both
died within two years after, as well as many others.
I am well sensible that the divine judgments are a great deep, and that love
or hatred is not to be known merely by such outward events; yet they ought to
put us all upon searching and trying our ways (as David did) by the revealed
will of God; which duty was excellently inculcated upon them at that time in a
letter to Capt. Oliver of Boston, in the words following.

My dear Brother,
"The ardent affection and great honors that I have for New England transport
me, and I hope your churches shall ever be to me as the gates of heaven. I have
ever been warmed with the apprehension of the grace of God toward me in
carrying me thither. I have always thought that of the congregational churches
of N. E. ^n our days. But now it is otherwise, with joy as to ourselves and
grief as to you be it spoken. Now the greater my love is to N. E. the more am I
grieved at their failings. It is frequently said here, that they are swerved
aside toward presbetery: if so, the Lord restore them all. But another sad
thing that much effects us is, to hear that you even in N. England persecute
your brethren; men sound in the faith; of holy life; agreeing in worship and
discipline with you; only differing in the point of baptism. Dear brother, we
here do love and honor them, hold familiarity with them and take sweet council
together; they lie in the bosom of Christ and therefore they ought to be laid
in our bosoms. In a word, we freely admit them into churches; few of our
churches but many of our members are anabaptists: I mean baptized again. This
is love in England; this is moderation; this is a right new testament spirit.
But do you now (as is abovesaid) bear with, yea, more than bear with, the
Presbyterians? yea, and that the worst sort of them, viz. those who are the
corruptest, rigedst; whose principles tend to corrupt the churches; turning the
world into the church, and the church into the world; and which does no less
than bring a people under mere slavery. It is an iron yoke which neither we nor
our congregational brethren in Scotland were ever able to bear. I have heard
them utter these words in the pulpit, that it is no wrong to make the
independants sell all they have, and depart the land; and many more things I
might mention of that kind; but this I hint only, to show what cause there is
to withstand that wicked tyranny which was once set up in poor miserable
Scotland, which I verily believe was a great wrong and injury to the
reformation. The generality of them here, even to this day, will not freely
consent to our enjoyment of our liberty; though through mercy the best and most
reformed of them do otherwise. How much more therefore would it concern dear N.
E. to turn the edge against [those] who, if not prevented, will certainly
corrupt and enslave, not only their own, but also your churches? Whereas
anabaptists are neither spirited nor principled to injure nor hurt your
government nor your liberties; but rather these be a means to preserve your
churches from apostasy, and provoke them to their primitive purity, as they
were in the first planting, in admission of members to receive none into your
churches but visible saints, and in restoring the entire jurisdiction of every
congregation complete and undisturbed. We are hearty and full for our
presbyterian brethren's enjoying equal liberty with ourselves, oh that they had
the same spirit toward us! but oh how it grieves and affects us that
New England should persecute! will you not give what you take? is liberty of
conscience your due? and is it not as due unto others that are sound in the
faith? Read the preface to the declaration of the faith and order, owned and
practiced in the congregational churches in England, p. 6, 7. Amongst many
others scriptures, that in the 14th of Romans much confirms me in liberty of
conscience thus stated; To him that esteems any thing unclean, to him it is
unclean, verse 13. Therefore though we approve of the baptism of the immediate
children of church members, and [of] their admission into the church when they
evidence a real work of grace; yet to [those] that in conscience believe the
said baptism to be unclean it is unclean. Both that and mere ruling elders,
though we approve of them, yet our grounds are mere interpretations of, and not
any express scripture. I cannot say so clearly of any thing else in our
religion, neither as to faith or practice. Now must we force our
interpretation, upon others Pope-like! In verse 5 of that chapter the spirit of
God says, Let every one be fully persuaded in his own mind; therefore this
being the express will of God, who shall make a contrary law, and say,
persuaded or not persuaded you shall do as we say, and as we do! and verse 23,
what is not of faith is sin; therefore there must be a word for what we do, and
we must see and believe it, or else we sin if we do it. And Deuteronomy. 12 and last,
as we must not add, nor may we deminish: what is commanded we must do. Also
28th of Matthew. And what principles is persecution grounded upon? Dominiation
and infallibility: this we teach is the truth. But are we infallible, and have
we the government? God made none, no not the apostles who could not err, to be
lords over faith; therefore what monstrous pride is this! At this rate any
persuasion geting uppermost may command, and persecute them that obey them not;
all non-conformists must be ill-used. Oh wicked and monstrous principle! What
ere you can plead for yourselves against those that persecute you, those whom
ye persecute may plead for themselves against you. Whatever they can say
against the poor men, your enemies say against you: and what! is that horrid
principle crept into precious New England, who have felt what persecution is,
and have always pleaded for liberty of conscience; Have not those run equal
hazards with you for the enjoyment of their liberties; and how do you cast a
reproach upon us, that are congregational in England, and furnish our
adversaries with weapons against us? We blush and are filled with shame and
confusion of face, when we hear of these things. Dear brother! we pray that God
would open your eyes and persuade the hearts of your magestrates, that they may
no more finite their fellow servants, nor thus greatly injure us their
brethren; and that they may not thus dishonor the name of God and cause his
people to be reproached, nor the holy way of God (the congregational way) to be
evil spoken of. My dear brother! pardon my plainness and freedom, for the zeal
of God's house constrains me. What cause have we to bless God who gives us to
find favor in the eyes of his Majesty? and to pray God to continue him, and to
requite it graciously to him in spiritual blessings. Well, strive I beseech you
with God by prayers, and use all lawful ways and means, even to your greatest
hazard, that those poor men may be set free. For be assured, this liberty of
conscience, as we state it, is the cause of God; and hereby you may be a means
to divert the judgments of God from falling upon dear New England, for our
Father in faithfulness will afflict us if we repent not. Does not the very
gospel say, what measure we mete to others shall be measured to us? God is not
unrighteous: what is more provoking to him than the persecuting of his saints!
Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm; did he not reprove kings
for their sake? Those who have the unction the apostle John speaks of, and the
spirit and gift of prophesies. With what mavelous strength did holy Mr.
Buroughs urge that place against persecution? Persecution is bad in wicked
men, but it is most abominable in good men, who have suffered and pleaded for
liberty of conscience themselves. Discountenance men that certainly err, but
persecute them not. I mean gross errors. Well, we are traveling to our place
of rest: with joy we look for new heavens and new earth. We shall ere long be
in the fullness of bliss, holy, harmless in the bosom of Christ. Let us pray,
the earth may be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, that they may not hurt
nor destroy in all his holy mountain. The Lord grant we may by the next hear
better things of the government of New England. My most hearty love to your
brother, and to all our brethren. My respects and service to my dear cousin
Leveret, and to Mr. Francis Willonghby. The Lord make them instrumental, for
his glory, in helping to reform things among you. I shall be glad to hear from
you. I remember our good old sweet communion togeher. My dear brother, once
again pardon me, for I am affected! I speak for God, to whose grace I commit
you all in New England; humbly craving your pryers for us here, and remain,

Your affectionate brother. ROBERT MASCALL." S. Hubbard's collection.

Finsbury near Morefield, the 25th of March. 1669.

NEVER did I see the true nature of these controversies better stated by any on
that side. Our apponents have no better grounds for accusing us of denying
scripture consequences, than because we refuse to yield to their
interpretations, which appear to us unsound. Neither are we any more rigid than
themselves; though because they hold to two or three ways of baptizing, while
we believe our Lord has instituted but one baptism, they accuse us with it, if
we cannot act with them as baptized persons, who appears to us not to be such.
The plain question is, whither each one shall be allowed to act the full
persuasion of his own mind, according to God's law, or whether the ruling party
in the state shall make that law void by their traditions? The learned and much
esteemed Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Owen, Mr. Nigh, Mr. Caryl and nine other noted
dissenting ministers in London wrote to the Massachusetts governor, upon these
things at the same time, and said,

"WE shall not here undertake to make any apology for the persons, opinions and
practices of those who are censured among you. You know our judgment and
practice to be contrary unto theirs, even as yours; wherein (God assisting) we
shall continue to the end. Neither shall we return any answer to the reason of
the Reverend elders, for the justification of your proceedings, as hot being
willing to engage in the management of any the least difference with persons
whom we so much love and honor in the Lord. But the sum of all which at present
we shall offer to you is, that though the court might apprehend, that they had
grounds in general warranting their procedure (in such cases) in the way
wherein they have proceeded; yet that they have any rule or command rendering
their so proceeding indispen^^uly necessary, under all circumstances of fines
and places, we are altogher unsatisfied; and we heed not represent unto you how
the case stands with ourselves, and all your brethren and companions in the
services of these latter days in these nations. We are sure you would be
unwilling to put an advantage into the hands of some, who seek pretenses, and
occasions against own liberty, and to reinforce the ^^^mer rigor. Now we
cannot deny but this has already in some measure been done, in that it has
been vogued, that persons of your way, principles and spirit, cannot bear with
dissenters from them. And as this greatly reflects on us, so some of us have
observed how already it has turned unto your own disadvantage. We leave it to
your wisdom to determine, whether under all these circumstances, and sundry
others of the like nature that might be added, it be not advisable at present
to put an end unto the sufferings and con^^nements of the persons censured, and
to restore them to their former liberty. At a court of assistants held at
Boston March 2, 1669, the governor and magistrates being assembled in council
and motion being ^^de by Thomas Gould, in behalf of himself and William Turner,
now in durance by the sentance of the general court; the keepers of the
prisons, under whose custody they now are, ^^e ordered to permit them liberty
for three days, to visit their families, as also to apply themselves to any
that are able and orthodox, for their further convinement of their many
irregularities in those practices for which they were sentanced; the said
keepers taking the e. g gements of the said Gould and Turner, or other
sufficient ^^ution, for their return again to prison at the end of the said
three days. By the council, Edward Rawson secretary."
You have the advantage of truth and order; you have the gifts and learning of
an able ministry to manage and defend them; you have the care and vigilency of
a very worthy magistracy to countenance and protect them, and to preserve the
peace; and above all, you have a blessed Lord and Master, who has the keys of
David, who opens and no man shuts, living forever to take care of his own
concernments among his saints; and assuredly you need not be disquieted,
through some few persons (though their own infirmity and weakness, or through
their ignorance, darkness and prejudices) should to their disadvantage turn out
of the way, in some lesser matters, into by paths of their own. We only make it
our hearty request to you, that you would trust God with his truths and ways so
far, as to suspend all rigorous proceedings in corporal restraints or
punishments, on persons that dissent from you, and practice the principles of
their dissent without danger, or disturbance to the civil peace of the place.
Dated March 25, 1669."

We may reasonably conclude that this address did not reach Boston till May or
June, and Dr. Mather says, "I cannot say that this excellent letter had
immediately all the effect it should have had." So that though he allo^s that
some of those baptists were "truly godly men," Magnalia, b. 7, p. 27, 28.
yet it is likely that they were imprisoned a year or more, only for not
banishing themselves for their religion. After their release, elder Gould went
and lived upon an Island in the harbor; where they held their meeting for some
years. But this could not make the ruling party easy, as the following letter
to Mr. Clarke and his church at Newport plainly shows.

"BELOVED brethren and sisters, I most heartily salute you all in our dear
Lord, who is our alone Savior in all our troubles, that we his poor members
are exerci^ed with for his name sake. And blessed be God our father that has
given us such a high priest, that was touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, which is no small comfort to the souls of his poor suffering ones;
the which through grace the Lord has been pleased to make us in some measure
pertakers of. And at this present our dear brother William Turner, a prisoner
for the Lord's cause in Boston, has some good experience of, both of that which
Paul desired, to be conformable to our Lord in his sufferings, and also of the
promises of our Lord, in the giving forth the comfort of his spirit, to uphold
us all, for that he is sensible of the sufferings of his poor members, and is
ready to give forth supplies as are most ^suitable to such a condition as he
calls his to. Friends I suppose you have heard that both he and brother Gould
were to be taken up; but only brother Turner is yet taken and has been about a
month in prison. Warrants are in two marshal's hands for brother Gould also,
but he is not yet taken, because he lives on Noddles-Island, and they wait to
take him at town. The cause why they are put in prison is the old sentance of
the general court in 68, because they would not remove themselves. There were
six magistrates hands to the warrant to take them up, viz. Mr. Bradstreet,
major Denison, Thomas Danforth, captain Gookin, major Willard and Mr. Pinchon.
But all the deputies of the court voted their liberty, except one or two at
most, but the magistrates carry against all; and because some others of the
magistrates were absent, and some that were there were Gallio like, as one Mr.
R. B. G. I suppose Richard Bellingham governor. Thus a few men at the he^d of
the government, by the clergy's help, carried on their oppre^^^ons against the
minds of those worthy rulers, Willoughby, Symonds and Leveret; a whole house of
deputies, and the best part of the whole community. "That magistrates sh^^ld
thus suffer these incendiaries, and disturbers of the public peace, might
justly he wonde^ed at, if it did not appear that they have been invited by them
unto a participation of the spoil, and have therefore thought fit to make use
of their ^oveteousness and pride, as a means whereby to increase their own
power. For who does not see that these good men are indeed more ministers of
the government, then ministers of the gospel." Looks on toleration, p. 71, 72.
But blessed be the Lord who takes notice of what is done to his poor servants,
though men little regard. The town and country is very much troubled at our
troubles; and especially the old church in Boston, and their elders, both Mr.
Oxonbrige and Mr. Allen have labored abundantly, I thinks as if it had been for
their best friends in the world. Mr Deve^port died March 15, 1670, aged 72; and
Mr. John Oxonbridge, who left England after the cruel Bartholomew a^t in 1662,
was settled in his ^^ead, colleague with Mr. James Allen, who came from thence
about the same time.
Many more gentlemen and solid christians are for our brothers deliverance; but
it cannot be had; a very great trouble to the town; and they had gotten six
magistrates hands for his deliverance, but could not get governors hand to it.
Some say one end is, that they may prevent others coming out of England;
therefore they would discourage them by dealing with us; a sad thing if so;
when God would have Moab be a re^^ge for his banished ones, and that christians
will not. But God will be a refuge for his, which is our comfort. We keep our
meeting at Noddles-island every first day, and the Lord is adding some ^ouls to
us still, and is enlightening some others; the priests are much enraged. The
Lord has given us another elder, one John Russell senior, a gracious wise and
holy man that lives at Woburn, where we have five brethren near that can meet
with him; and they meet together a first days when they cannot come to us, and
I hear there are some more there looking that way with them. Thus dear friends
I have given you an account of our troubles, that you may be directed in your
prayers to our God for us; as also of the goodness of God to us, and the
proceedings of his good work in our hands, both to our, and I doubt not to your
joy and comfort. That God may be glorified in all, is our earnest desire and
prayer to God in all his dispensations to us. Brother Turner's family is very
weakly, and himself too. I fear he will not trouble them long; only this is our
comfort, we hear if he dies in prison, they say they will bury him. And thus my
dear friends. I desire we may be remembered in your prayers to our heavenly
father, who can do abundantly above what we can ask or think: to whom I commend
you all, and rest, your friend and brother,

EDWARD DRINKER."
No. 30, 1670.

THIS occasioned the following epistle to them, viz.

"UNTO to the church of Jesus Christ, meeting on Noddles-island in New England;
grace, mercy and peace be mightily showered down upon you all, with such daily
supplies to every one of you, according to your various conditions,
strengthening the weak, and making you to press forward with life and courageous
hearts, being valliant for the Lord and his holy truths, holding out to the end
in what ye have received; not to look back, but pressing forward to know more
of his holy will, like children desiring the sincere milk of the word, to grow
up therein. -- Samuel Hubbard, a very poor and unworthy one, yet by great grace
found in my sinful estate, among the sinners in a sinful world, in a sinful
age, and by free grace called by a divine call or power, being not able to
resist it, but by grace showed that it was his will to call sinners that were
weary and heavy laden to come unto him, making a gracious promise, that they
should find rest to their souls. Mat. 11. And by his grace has made me
willing, in my very weak measure, to be going on in what he has showed me;
though I find a law in my members, contrary to God's holy law, which is written
in my heart, leading me captive both in thoughts words and deeds, which is a
great burden, and makes me go heavily. But blessed be God my rock, who has
showed me that it is not by my works, but by faith in our precious Redeemer, I
am accepted with the Father. Not thereby taken off from endeavoring to keep
all his holy commandments and ordinances, but with righteous Zacharias and
Elizabeth, desirous to be found blamless when our Lord and King Jesus shall
come, and by him enabled with joy to say, This is my Lord, I have waited for
him; when you with others shall meet and sing the song of Moses and the Lamb,
Halalujah to God most High, etc. Dear and precious hearts, my love is such
toward you, for what of God is in you, and what great grace has appeared
toward you, in bearing you up to stand in this hour of temptation, that your
feet are not moved, and your arms are made strong by the mighty God of Jacob;
yea, not only so, but has crowned your endeavors with a blessing of increase
of such precious helps, as I hear you have, in which I rejoice, desiring
greatly of the Lord that he would be still with you to the end of your race,
Dear friends, it was upon my heart to have given you a visit, whereby I might
have been refreshed by your mutual love, as I have been to see your precious
order in the gospel; but it has pleased our havenly Father to visit me and my
dear wife, by a sore stroke in taking away our only son Samuel; He was in his
21st year, a very promising youth. Mr. Hubbard's daughter Ruth, m^rried to
Robert Burdick, and Bethia married to Joseph Clarke jun'r, have left a large
posterity at Westerly; and R^chel married to Andrew Langworthy, left a large
family in Newport, and he hoped that all his children, and some of his
grandchildren were savingly converted.
all we had; a man grown (whose we are also.) But God of his grace has born us
up, blessed be his name: by which I have been very much disappointed as in
coming to you, so in many other things, and am learning in every condition to
be content; a hard lesson to learn I find. Dear brethren and sisters, what am I
poor worm, to inform you! but to stir up your pure minds that you would be
holding fast what you have received, that you may not loose your rewards, for
this is a declining day. But know the reward is laid up in most sure hands, for
those who hold out to the end. I beseech you pray with all manner of prayers,
and for me poor one, that I may have such fresh supplies of grace, that I may
stand fast in what I have received of God, and not deny his name, knowing of
whom I have received it. Pray for me that I may have more of the spirit of
adoption, to cry in faith Abba, Father; more of faith in those precious
promises made to his in the holy scriptures, and more strength to run the ways
of his holy commandments with more delight and largness of heart without
partiality. Oh! my dear friends, pray for Sion! they that love her shall
prosper. Oh! my brethren and sisters! pardon my boldness, and accept in love my
weak endeavors, and let me have from you a few lines, which would be as a dew
upon my poor weak heart, which needs information, instruction and comfort. --
Thus desiring your prosperity in your inward man, and outward man also, knowing
that if ye seek first the kingdom of God, we have our Lords word for it, that
all other things shall be added -- Commiting you to the Almighty to bless you
with spiritual blessings, with such daily fresh supplies as you stand in need
of, whereby ye may abound for his names praise, the good of sinners,
strengthening of saints, comforting one another, drawing in love in all your
ways which is as precious ointment, giving forth such a precious favor as that
all Christ's virgins may love and rejoice in you, and bless God on your behalf.
The God of all grace be with you all, Amen. My wife desires to have her
affectionate entire love to you all remembered. Your poor weak brother in the
best relation.

SAMUEL HUBBARD."
Newport, this 4th day of the 9th Month, 1671.

"DEAR brother and sister, my kind love and respect with my wife's, be
remembered to your with all the rest of our dear friends, hoping you welfare.
These few lines are to let you understand, that your loving christian letter
you sent me I received, for which I give you hearty thanks. I delivered your
letter according to your desire, and it was read in the church, wherein we
understand the Lord has been pleased to take away your son, that was dear unto
you. God sometimes tries his people in that which is most near and dear to
them, even in their Isaac's. Jacob must part with his Benjamin, and say, all
these things are against me; yet the Lord turned it about for good; and he has
promised that all shall work for good unto those that love and fear him; and
what he deprives us of in the creature, he is able to make up abundantly in
himself. The good Lord grant it may be so with you! -- Brother Turner has been
near to death, but through mercy is revived, and so has our pastor Gould. The
Lord make us truly thankful, and give us hearts to improve them, and those
liberties we yet enjoy that we know not how soon may be taken from us. The
persecuting spirit begins to stir again. Elder Russel and his son, and brother
Foster are presented to the court that is to be this month. We desire your
prayers for us, that the Lord would keep us, that we may not dishonor that
worthy name we have made prosession of, and that the Lord would still stand by
us, and be seen amongst us, as he has been in a wonderful manner in preserving
of us until this day. We should be glad to hear how it is with you, and desire
if it be the will of God, that love and peace may be conti^^ed betwixt you and
the other society; although you may differ in some things, yet that there may
be endeavors to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, and as far
as we have attained to walk by the same rule. I shall not trouble you any
further, but commit you to the guidance and protection of the Almighty, and
remain your unworthy brother in the best relation.

BENJAMIN SWEETSER."
Charlestown, the first 10th month 71.

THE next news from them is as follow. "I perceive you have heard as if our
brother Russel had died in prison. Through grace he is yet in the land of the
living, and out of prison bonds; but is in a doubtful way as to recovery of his
outward health; but we ought to be quiet in the good will and pleasure of our
God, who is only wise. -- I remain your loving brother,

WILLIAM HAMLIT."
Boston, 14, of the 4th month, 1672.

We will now look a little back, and see how their oppressors got along. The
breach in Boston church affected many; and the governor appeared against the
new party, and in July 1669 called his council together, fearing he said, "a
sudden tumult, some persons attempting to set up an edifice for public worship,
which was apprehended by authority to be detrimental to the public peace." But
the majority of the council were for not hindering their proceeding. On May 11,
1670, Mr. Danforth of Roxbury, who was one of those that had been called to the
baptist dispute two years before, said to the assembly in his election sermon,
"Is not the temper, complexion and countenance of the churches strangely
altered? Does not a careless, (...), flat, dry, cold, dead frame of spirit grow
upon us secretly, strongly, prodigiously? they that have ordinances are as
though they had none; they that hear the word as though they heard it not; and
they that pray as though they prayed not; and they that recceive sacraments as
though they received them not; and they that are exercised in holy things, use
them by the by as matters of custom and ceremony. Pride, contention,
worldliness, coveteousness, luxury, drunkenness and uncleanness break in like a
flood upon us; and good men grow cold in their love to God, and one another."
Prince's Christian hist. vol. 1, p. 97,
Upon which the house of deputies appointed a committee, to enquire into the
prevailing evils that had procured the divine displeasure against the land; and
they reported these among other causes, viz. "Declension from the primative
foundation work, innovation in doctrine and worship, opinion and practice; an
invasion of the rights, liberties and privileges of churches, an usurpation of
a lordly and prelatical power over God's heritage, subversion of gospel order,
etc." They then go on to speak of the late transaction of the elders, in
constituting the third church in Boston, as "irregular, illegal and
disorderly." But the effect was such, that among fifty deputies in their next
assembly, there were but twenty of those who were in this; and then fifteen
ministers presented an address to the new modled house, wherein they mention
their former connection with rulers like Moses and Aaron, and then call the
sitting up of said church in Boston, "That weighty and worthy transaction." And
prevailed with this house to correct and declare against what the preceding
house had done to the contrary. Mass. hist. vol. ^, p. 272, 274.
Such was the ministerial influence of that day. On May 15, 1672, the assembly
ordered their law-book to be revised and reprinted; and therein they say.

"ALTHOUGH no human power be Lord over the faith and consciences of men, yet
because such as bring in damnable heresies, tending to the subversion of the
christian faith, and destruction of the souls of men, ought duly to be
restained from such notorious impietis; it is therefore ordered and declared by
the court, that if any christian within this jurisdiction, shall go about to
subvert and destroy the christian faith and religion, by broaching and
maintaining any damnable heresies; as denying the immortallity of the soul, or
resurrection of the body, or any sin to be repented of in the regenerate, or
any evil done by the outward man to be accounted sin, or denying that Christ
gave himself a ransom for our sins, or shall assirm that we are not justified
by his death and righteousness, but by the perfection of our own works, or
shall deny the morality of the fourth commandment, or shall openly condemn or
oppose the baptizing of infants, or shall purposely depart the congregation at
the administration of that ordinance, or shall deny the ordinance of
magistracy, or their lawful authority to make war, or to punish the outward
breaches of the first table, or shall endeavor to seduce others to any of the
errors and heresies abovementioned; every such person continuing obstinate
therein after due means of conviction, shall be sentanced to banishment." Mass.
law-book printed 1672. p. 58, 59.


THE reader may here observe what advances they had made since the year 1644,
p. 150. The two articles which the baptists own, are now fenced with a much
more formidable catalogue of heresies and errors, than were then inserted in
their law against them. Though they still fall far behind their mother, the
church of England; for the last man that she burnt for religion was a baptist,
and in the warrant for his burning, the King says, "Whereas the reverend father
in God, Richard, bishop of Coventry and Litchfield, having judicially proceeded
in the examination, hearing and determining of a cause of heresy against
Edward Wigh^m^^, of the parish of Burton upon Trent, in the diocese of Coventry
and Litchfield, concerning the wicked heresies of the Ebionites, Cerenthians,
Valentinians, Arrians, Macedonians, of Simon Magus, of Manes, Manichees, of
Photinus, and Anabaptists, and of other heretical, execrable and unheard of
opinions, by the instinct of satan, by him excogitated and holden," of which
they went on to name sixteen articles, many of them so foolish and
inconsistant, that as the historian observes, he must be an idiot or a madman
to hold them all. But three of them are in these words, viz. "13 That the
baptizing of infants is an abominable custom. 14. That there ought not in the
church the use of the Lord's supper to be celebrated in the elements of bread
and wine; and the use of baptism to be celebrated in the element of water, AS
they are now practiced in the church of England; but the use of baptism is to
be administered in water, only to converts of sufficient age and understanding,
converted from infidelity to the faith. 16. That christianity is not wholly
professed and preached in the church of England but only in part." For these
things Mr. Wightman was burnt at Litchfield, April 11, 1611, by a warrant from
that King, who in the preface to our bible is compared to the rising sun,
Crosby's hist. vol. 1, p. 108, and appendix, p. 1, 3.
and whose tyranny drove our fathers into New England.

THE above clearly shows that the church of England far exceeded her daughters
in this land, both in the number of hard names they imposed upon the baptists,
and also in their degree of cruelty toward them; though a lamentable imitation
of those evils appear in this history. And to enforce the forecited law among
the rest, the Massachusetts placed the following motto in the title page of
their law book; whosoever resists the power, resists the ordinance of God,
and they that resist receive to themselves damnation. But whether the assuming
and exerting of such power in religious affairs, be not the way to damnation,
rather than the resistance of it, deserves the serious consideration of all?
Some years ago, when the presbyterians had the upper hand in England [See p.
174] Mr. Samuel Oats, a noted and successful baptist minister, was imprisoned,
put in irons and tried for his life as a murderer, at Chelmsford assize, only
because Ann Martin, a young woman that he had baptized, happened to die a few
weeks after. But when his case came to be tried, her mother and others declared
upon oath, "that she was in better health for several days after her baptism
than she had been for some years before; and was seen to walk abroad very
comfortably,' so that he was acquitted. Ibid: p. 237, 238.


AND now when the episcopalians had gotten the power again into their hands,
Mr. Neal truly observes, that the enemies to the baptists tried to ruin them,
"by as unparalled a piece of villainy as ever was heard of. A pamphlet was
published in London in 1673, entitled, Mr. Baxter baptized in blood; or, a sad
history of the unparalled cruelty of the ANABAPTISTIS in NEW ENGLAND;
faithfully relating the cruel, barbarous and bloody murder of Mr. Josiah
Baxter, an othodox minister, who was killed by the ANABAPTISTS, and his skin
most cruelly flead off from his body. Published by his mournful brother
Benjamin Baxter, living in Fenchurch-street, London. This pamphlet was licenced
by Dr. Parker, the archbishops chaplain, and cried about streets by the
hawkers. Yea, it went off so current that a second edition was got into the
press in a few weeks. Parker was thought to be in author, Crosby
The author represents his brother as worsting the anabaptists in a public
disputation at Boston; for which, by way of revenge, they sent four ruffins in
vizors to his house a little way out of town, who after they had bound his wife
and three children, first whipped, and then stead him alive The author
concludes, I have published this narrative in perpetuam rei memoriam, that the
world may see the spirit and temper of those men, and that it may stand as an
eternal memorial of their hatred to all orthodox ministers." But when search
was made by authority, they could find no account of such a minister as Josiah
Baxter in New England, nor of his brother Benjamin in London. The whole story
was a naked and malicious forgery, Neal's history of N. E. vol. 1, p. 374, 375.
and verifired the words of Lactantious, in the next century after Constantine
first introduced the custom, of supporting such ministers by force as the court
called orthodox. Said he, "among those, who seek power and gain from their
religion, there will never be wanting an inclination to forge and lie for it."
Middleton's letter from Rome. p. 97.


As a contrast to the above, I will give a further taste of the spirit of those
men who have often been accused of hatred to orthodox ministers. In the
beginning of 1665 Mr. Stephen Mumford, a seventh day baptist, arrived from
London at Newport, and Mr. Hiscox, Mr. Hubbard, and other members of Mr.
Clarke's church soon embraced the keeping of that day; but in 1671, two or
three men who had so done, turned back to the observation of the first day,
which Mr. Hubbard and others called apostasy, though many accounted it a
reformation; and in June that year Mr. Holmes preached smartly against the
others sentiments; and the contention increased, till in December it caused an
open separation; upon hearing of which our suffering fathers in the
Massachusetts wrote the following letter.

"To brother William Hiscox, and the rest of our beloved brethren and sisters,
that observe the seventh day sabbath with him. The church of Christ in or near
Boston sends greeting. Brethren, beloved of the Lord, we having had a view of
the proceedings between yourselves and the church, cannot but be grieved to see
how busy the adversary has been, and how easily he has prevailed upon the
corruptions of our nature, to make breaches and divisions among those whom we
dare not but judge, are united unto one head, even Christ Jesus. And although
we dare not judge your consciences in the observation of a day or days to the
Lord, yet brethren, your judging them that have so done, and we hope have not
unadvisedly changed their minds, to be apostates, seems to our understandings
to savor too much a censorious spirit. And we, as brethren, made pertakers of
the same grace of God through the influence of his holy spirit, not being
enlightened in the observation of the seventh day as a sabbath to the Lord,
shall humbly beseech you all, to put on bowels of mercy, and not be so strait
in your spirits toward others; but consider, the only wise God gives to each
soul what measure of light and knowledge he pleases; and it is he must give
wisdom to improve that measure of knowledge so given, or else we shall make a
bad improvement thereof. Now brethren we dare not justify your action, nor the
manner of the actions that have been between you and the church; but should
have been glad, if it had been the good pleasure of the Lord, that you could
have borne each with other in the matter of difference, and so have left it for
the Lord to reveal more light and knowledge to those that are yet in the dark.
But may we not say, we are all in the dark, and see and know but in part? and
the little part that any one knows, he is ready to conceive is the will of
God, and so would have all to see with his eyes, and understand with his
understanding; and cannot patiently wait on the Lord till he shall make
discoveries of it to his brethren; so that our quick, narrow and impatient
spirits are the cause of so many breaches and divisions amongst the citizens of
Sion at this day. By all which we humbly desire the Lord may make you and us,
and all the Lord's people, to see the corruption of our natures that is yet
unsubdued, that so we may all with sincerity of soul, wait on him according to
that measure of light and knowledge that each of us have received from him. And
now brethren, our desire is, if it may be the good pleasure of God, that this
breach may be healed between you and the church. Our prayers shall be to the
Lord for you, that each one of you may be truly sensible, wherein you have so
far departed from the law of brotherly love, as to be an occasion of grief one
to another, and to the Israel of God, and have given an occasion to the enemies
to speak reproachfully of the ways of God; not doubting but you will be willing
to look back over all those actions past in these differences, and if you find
any thing contrary to the mind and will of God, be willing to own it both to
God and his people. We shall leave you to his care and guiding, who is able to
comfort you in all your tribulations, and to establish, strengthen and settle
you; to whom we leave you, and remain your poor unworthy brethren, who should
rejoice in your prosperity, both in spirituals and temporals. By the apointment
of the church assembled.

THOMAS GOULD, WILLIAM TURNER, JOHN WILLIAMS."
Church assembled, Noddle's island. Sep. 1, 1672.

THIS sweet letter, Mr. Hubbard has preserved, and it caused no alianation of
mind, but there remained a great nearness between them as long as they lived. I
find him in a letter the next year to his brother Hamlit, "desiring the welfare
of the whole Sion, and the brethren with you; brother Foster, brother Farlow,
elder Russell and his son; yea to all the church, with thanks for their love to
me and my wife." Mr. Hamlit wrote on June 19, 1673, that the baptists were
still persecuted for their withdrawing from the public meetings, and said,
"Brother Trumbel and brother Osborne were fined last court at Charlestown
twenty shillings a piece; they have appealed to the court of assistants." But
Mr. Bellingham dying, and Mr. Leveret being chosen governor, and Mr. Symonds
deputy governor; things took another turn, so that Mr. Hamlit wrote to his
brother Hubbard on Jan. 9, 1674, and said, "Brother Drinker has been very sick
near unto death, but the Lord has restored him to health again. The church of
the baptized to peacably enjoy their liberty. Brother Russell, the elder and
the younger, have good remembrance of you." And while those governors lived,
that church enjoyed the greatest liberty that ever they did under their first
charter. After governor Leveret's death, I find Mr. Russell and his church, in
a appointment of a day of thanksgiving, expressing their sense of "the Lord's
goodness in preserving our peace and liberty beyond all expectation; God having
removed him, who was a friend to us in the authority, by reason of which our
opposites have the greater advantage against us, who have not been wanting to
do their endeavor to suppress us." When shall soon find how that advantage was
improved. We are informed by their records, that the next members that were
added, after the first constitution of the church, were Isaac Hull, John
Farnum, Jacob Barney, John Russell, junior, John Johnson, George Farlow,
Benjamin Sweetser, all before Ellis Callender, who was received, Nov. 9, 1669.
Mr. Hull was called also to be an elder in the church in the time of their
sufferings. The next on the list are Joshua Turner, Thomas Foster, John
Russell, senior, (afterward their pastor) William Hamlit, James Landon. Thomas
Skinner, John Williams, Philip Squire, Mary Gould, Susanna Jackson, Mary
Greenleaf, etc. Elder Gould died Oct. 27, 1675, having been a man, "in some
good measure fitted and qualified (says elder Russell) for such a work; and
proved an eminent instrument in the hand of the Lord, for the carrying on this
good work of God in its low and weak beginnings" And including the other first
constitutors with him, says, "Their trouble and temptations followed, one upon
the neck of another, like the waves of the sea; but these precious servants of
the Lord, having in some good measure counted the cost beforehand, were
cheerfully carried on by the hand of the Lord upon them, through all the
afflictions and reproaches they met with; and are the most of them now at rest
with the Lord, having served the will of God in their generation." Hubbard --
Russell's narrative 1680, p. 1. 2. 6.


CHAP. VII. An account of Philip's war, of the baptist's further sufferings,
and other events down to 1690.
THE forgoing history may give the reader some idea, of the nature and causes
of the contentions that long labored in the country, between the natives and
the English. Mr. Samuel Hubba^d in the close of that war, wrote to a minister
in England and said, "God has been long waiting with patience, by several signs
and warnings these forty years as I can witness; but we in our turnings have
not so turned to the Lord as ought to be, and his displeasure is broke forth in
the country by the ^atives, who were forced thereto to, as some of them said
(and in very deed I judge truly.") I find by their records, that the
commissioners of the united colonies, in September 1662, appointed Capt. George
Denison, Thomas Stanton and James Averell, to manage their affairs at
Paucatuck, to govern the Indians, and collect the tax imposed upon them on
account of the Pequots; and then say, "They are also hereby authorized to act
and do, or cause to be done, what in their discretion may best conduce, to
reduce them to civility and the knowledge of God, as well by causing due
punishment to be inflicted on disorderly persons according to their demirits,
as by encouraging such as shall be sent to instruct them by order of the
commissioners, and by causing them to attend thereunto." And nothing has been
more common with their party ever since, than to represent the Rhode-Islanders
as an irreligious people: but I trust the forgoing facts show that they were
not all so, to which I shall add, that Mr. S. Hubbard's daughter Ruth was
converted and joined to Mr. Clarke's church in 1652, when she was not 13 years
old, and on August 4, 1666, she wrote from Westerly thus,

"MOST loving and dear father and mother, my duty with my husband and children
presented unto you, with all my dear friends, -- My longing desire is to hear
from you, how your hearts are borne up above these troubles which are come upon
us, and are coming as we fear; for we have the rumors of war, and that almost
every day. Even now we have heard from your Island by some Indians who declared
unto us, that the French have done some mischief upon the coast, and we have
heard that 1200 Frenchmen have joined with the Mohawks, to clear the land both
of English and Indians. But I trust in the Lord, if such a thing be intended,
that will not suffer such a thing to be. My desire and prayer to God is, that
he will be pleased to fulfill his promise to us, that is, that as in the world
we shall have troubles, so in him we shall have peace. The Lord of comfort,
comfort your and our hearts, and give us peace in believing, and joy in the
Holy Ghost. Oh that the Lord would be pleased to fill our hearts with his good
spirit, that we may be carried above all these things! and that we may remember
his saying, When ye see these things come to pass, list up your heads, knowing
that your redemption draws nigh. Then if these things be the certain sign of
our Lord's return, let us mind his command, that is, pray always that ye may be
counted worthy to escape all these things, and to stand before the son of man.
Let us have boldness to come unto him in the new and living way, which he has
prepared for us. Through grace I find the Lord does bear up the spirits of his
in this place, in some comfortable measure, to be looking above these things,
the Lord increase it more and more unto the day of his appearing, which I hope
is at hand. Dear father and mother, the Lord has been pleased to give us here
many sweet and comfortable days of refreshing, which is great cause of
thankfulness, and my desire is, that we may highly prise it, and you with us
give the Lord the praise for this benefit. I pray remember my love to all my
dear friends with you in fellowship. Sister Sanders desires to be remembered to
you all: so does sister Clarke. Your loving daughter to my power, RUTH BURDICK."

PHILIP was son to Osamaquin and succeeded him as the chief sachem on the east
side of Narraganset Bay. He had this name given him by Plymouth court in 1660.
Such rumors spread of his preparing for war, as brought governor Prince, and
two of his assistants to Taunton, April 13, 1671, to meet three gentlemen from
the Massachusetts, to examine into the matter. Philip kept at a distance, and
sent to them to come to him at three mile river. Which runs from Norton through
the west part of Taunton, and falls into the great river betwixt that town und
Dighton.
The governor sent again for him to come to them, but he refused, till old Mr.
Roger Williams and Mr. Brown, [I suppose of Swanzey] offered to remain there as
hostages; by which means he was brought forward and prevailed with to deliver
up about 70 guns he had got, and to promise future fidelity, which suspended
the war four years. Mass. hist. v^l. 1, p. 278, 279.
And then it was brought on in the following manner. John Sasaman, and Indian
that the English had given considerable instruction to, both as to human
learning ^^d religious affairs, being with Philip at Namasket, discovered that
he was preparing for war, and informed the English of it; for which he was
murdered upon a pond at Assawamset, both of which places are in Middleborough.
Three Indians were apprehended for that murder, and were executed at Plymouth.

Mr. John Tracy of Norwich had married Mrs. Mary Winslow from Marshfield five
years before, and returning from a visit there at this time, happened to fall
in among a party of Indians in arms, waiting to hear whether their friends
would be executed or not. They brought him to Philip, whom he satisfied that he
was only a traveller and upon no ill design, so that he sent him away in peace.
Callender's century sermon, p. 73. Mr. Tra^y was my mother's grand^ather.
But hearing soon after that those Indians were executed, they broke out on
June 24, 1675, and killed nine men in different parts of Swanzey, and fired
upon one in Rehoboth; which alarmed the country, and in four days an army was
collected there, and made Mr. Miles's house their head quarters. Philip soon
left his station at Mount Hope, now Bristol, and retired to a great swamp east
of the great river. The Massachusetts part of the army went into the
Narraganset country, and brought those Indians to promise not to join in the
war, and then returned, and with the other forces, attacked Philip at the swamp
on July 18, but had little success therein. Soon after which, Philip and many
of his men repassed the river, and crossing Seaconk plain, made his way up to
the Nepmuck Indians in Worcester county, who had begun the war on July 14.

THESE alarms caused Mr. Joseph Tory and Mr. Hubbard to send a boat which
brought their friends from Westerly to Newport this month, who continued on the
island till the war was over. Soon after Philip had joined the Nepmucks, they
violently assaulted a small English plantation at Brookfield, and at Capt.
Hutchinson with a company went to relieve them on August 2, they from an ambush
gave him a mortal wound. But Major Willard came two days after with 48 men, and
slew many of the enemy, and delivered his friends. Upon which the enemy steered
further westward, and on Sept. I, burnt most of the houses in Deerfield, and
killed 8 men the next day at Northfield; and Capt. Beers going with 36 men to
fetch off the inhabitants there, had a terrible fight with the enemy, wherein
he and above half of his men fell. September 18, sundry teams went to bring off
a large quantity of grain from Deerfield, and Capt. Lothrop went with about 80
men to guard them; but not seeing any of the enemy, they on their return, got
to picking grapes by Muddy-brook, when the enemy got a dreadful advantage of
them. I have seen the stone over the place where they tell me about 70 of them
were buried in one grave. Presently after an assault was made upon Springfield,
where the minister's house and library was burnt, with 31 houses beside. But a
large body of Indians making an onset upon Hadly, Oct. 19, and having killed
one man, were so bravely repulsed by the English, that in their flight some of
them were drowned in Connecticut river, and others who escaped retired into
Narraganset. In that country on a small tract of upland within a great swamp,
seven miles west from the south ferry that goes over from Newport, the Indians
built and stored the strongest fort they ever had in this country. Therefore
the colonies gathered an army of a thousand men, under the command of governor
Winslow, and after a fierce con^^ct, ^oo^ and destroyed it on Dec. 19. They
supposed that a thousand of the enemy were cut off; but it cost on our side the
lives of six Captains, and 170, some said 210 men killed or wounded. They
marched 16 or 18 miles from Major Smith's to that fight, and returned through a
terrible snow-storn the same night. I have met with the original of a testimony
concerning that family, and that affair, which I will give a copy of here, and
is as follows.

Narraganset, 21, July, 1679, (ut vulgo.)

"ROGER WILLIAMS of Providence in the Narrganset Bay, in New England, being (by
God's mercy) the first beginner of the mother town of Providence, and of the
Colony of Rhode Island and Providence plantations, being now near to fourscore
years of age, yet (by God's mercy) of sound understanding and memory! do humbly
and faithfully declare, that Mr. Richard Smith, senior, who for his conscience
to God left fair possessions in GI cestershire, and adventured, with his
relations and estate to New England, and was a most acceptable inhabitant, and
a prime leading man in Taunton in Plymouth Colony; for his conscience sake,
many difference arising, he left Taunton and came to the Narraganset country,
where (by God's mercy and the favor of the Narraganset sachems) he broke the
ice at his great charge and hazard, and put up in the thickets of the
barbarians, the first English house amongst them. 2 I humbly testify that about
40 years from this date, he kept possession, coming and going himself, children
and servants, and he had quiet possession of his housing, lands and meadow; and
there in his own house, with much serenity of soul and comfort, he yield up his
spirit to God, (the father of spirits) in peace. 3. I do humbly and faithfully
testify as abovesaid, that since his departure his honored son, Capt. Richard
Smith, has kept possession (with much acceptance with English and Pagans) of
his fathers housing, lands and meadows, with great improvement, also by his
great cost and industry, And in the late bloody Pagan war, I knowingly testify
and declare, that it pleased the Most High to make use of himself in person,
his housing, goods, corn, provisions and cattle, for a garrison and supply for
the whole army of New England, under the command of the ever to be honored
general Winslow, for the service his Majesty's honor and country of
New England. 4 I do also humbly declare, that the said Capt Richard Smith,
jun'r ought by all the rules of equity, justice and gratitude (to his honored
father and himself) to be fairly treated with, considered, recruited, honored,
and by his Majesty's authority, confirmed and established in a peaceful
possession of his fathers and his own possessions in this Pagan wilderness, and
Narraganset country. The premises I humbly testify, as now leaving this country
and this world. ROGER WILLIAMS."

It appears by governor Winthrop's journal that Taunton was firn planted in
1637, so that Mr. Smith came there soon after. We are told that the mansion
house of the Updike family in North Kingston stands where he begin among the
Narragansets.




GREAT stores of corn were destroyed in that fort, which reduced the Indians to
terrible distress. But a thaw in January enabled them to get some sustenance
out of the earth, upon which they burnt the deserted houses in Mendon, and on
Feb, 10, 1676, made and onset upon Lancaster, burnt their habitations, and
killed or captivated 40 persons one of whom was Mrs. Rowlandson, wife to the
minister, who was then gone to Boston to procure help against the enemy. The
narrative she gave of her captivity has lately been reprinted. Like mischiefs
were done at Groton, Marlborough, Sudbury and Chelmsford; and on Feb. 21 the
enemy wheeled round and came down upon Medfield, (twenty miles from Boston) and
burnt half their house, and slew eighteen men, notwithstanding two or three
hundred soldiers that they then had in the town, Feb. 25 they did considerable
damage in Weymouth, still nearer to Boston; and the like at Groton and Sudbury
on March 10. The 12th they cut off two families in Clark's garrison at
Plymouth; and the next day burnt almost all Groton [in Middlesex] to the ground.

HERE I must open something that has been surprizingly concealed from this
country. It has been the constant practice of all parties who are fond of an
ecclesiastical establishment by human laws, to accuse the baptists of
disobedience to government, especially in the point of a defensive war. This the
reader may see inserted in a law of the Massachusetts, but three years before
this war began. Mr. Callender was then a member of the baptist church in
Boston, and was continued a great blessing to them for more than fifty years.
The copy of Mr. Russell's narrative that I am favored with came out of his
family, and in it is a manuscipt note in the margin, against Mr. Russell's
account of Mr. Turner, which says, " In the beginning of the war, William
Turner gathered a company of volunteers, but was denied a commission and
discouraged, because the chief of the company were anabaptists. Afterward when
the war grew more general and distructive, and the country in very great
distress, having diverse towns burnt, and many men slain, then he was desired to
accept a commission. He complained it was too late, his men on whom he could
confide being scattered; however was moved to accept." They made him Captain,
and his brother Drinker Lieutenant of a company that marched up with others in
the beginning of this month, to relieve the western towns, under Major Savage
as chief commander; and by them the Indians were repulsed and driven off from
Northampton on March 14. The 17th they burnt all but one of the houses in
Warwick, most of the inhabitants being gone to Rhode Island. On Lord's day,
March 26, Capt. Pierce being at Rehoboth, with fifty English soldiers, and
twenty friend Indians, heard of a body of the enemy up Patucket river, and
wrote to Capt. Andrew Edmunds of Providence, to meet him there with his company
to attack them. He sent the letter by a person who was going over to Providence
meeting, but who did not deliver it till their worship was done at noon. As
soon as Capt. Edmunds had read the letter, he gave the bearer a sharp
reprimand, for not delivering it before, and expressed his fear of the
consequence as it proved; for Capt. Pierce engaging the enemy alone, who were
also more numerous than he expected, he was surrounded and cut off; with all
but 13 of his men, only one of whom was of the English; and it is said he
escaped by a friend Indian's turning and running after him with a weapon, as if
he was an enemy, which others seeing did not pursue him. They tell us that
another of those friends escaped in this manner; being persued by an enemy, he
took shelter behind a rock, where as each waited for an opportunity to shoot
the other, our friend gently raising his hat above the rock upon a stick, the
enemy discharged his gun at it, on which the other shot him down and escaped.
It is reported, that Capt. Pierce and his men slew 140 of the enemy in the
conflict. The people both of Marlborough and Springfield suffered considerably
the same day. March 28, forty houses were burnt in Rehoboth, and twenty-nine
the next day at Providence, the people returning into garrisons.

IN the clerk's office in that town is a paper, in which Mr. Williams said. "I
pray the town, in the sense of the late bloody practices of the natives to give
leave to so many as can agree with William Field, to bestow some charge upon
fortifying his house, for security to women and children; also to give me leave
and so many as shall agree, to put up some defense on the hill, between the
mill and the highway, for the like safety of the women and children in that
part of the town." To this eleven principal inhabitants subscribed, the highest
whereof was two pounds six shillings, except Mr. Williams who subscribed ten
pounds. Tradition says, that when the Indians appeared on the high lands north
of their great cove, Mr. Williams took his staff and walked over toward them,
hoping likely to pacify them as he had often done; but when some of their aged
men saw him, they came out and met him, and told him that though those who had
long known him would not hurt him, yet their young men were so enraged that it
was not safe for him to venture among them; upon which he returned to the
garrison. The house where their records were kept was plundered, and they
thrown into the mill-pond, but were recovered, though by that means some
passages are not legible, and likely many articles were lost.

IN April Capt. George Denison of Stonington, with a number of English and
Mohegan Indians, performed two great exploits. They penetrated into the
Narraganset country, and slew forty-four of the enemy at one time, and
sixty-six at another, without the loss of a man. Though in the mean time the
Massachusetts met with a dreadful blow Capt. Wadsworth and Lieut. Bruttlebank,
with above thirty men, were cut off as they were going to relieve Sudbury, on
April 18. Bridgewater, which was planted in 1652, was now assaulted by a great
body of the enemy on May 8, when twelve deserted houses were burnt, but there
was never one of their people killed in that war; neither can we learn that any
English person who was born in that town, was ever slain by the sword for
eighty years after. Major Savage and most of his men returning, he left Capt.
Turner to command in that quarter. Hereupon the enemy, thinking themselves more
out of danger, resorted seven or eight hundred of them to to the great falls
above Deerfield, on the fishing design. Two captive lads made their escape, and
gave information of their secure state, whereupon Capt. Turner and young Capt.
Holioke of Spring-field, collected what force they could on a sudden, being not
much more than a hundred and fifty men, and went up silently in the night, tied
their horses at some distance, and a little before day break, May 13, 1676,
came unawares upon the enemy, "fired amain into their very wigwams, killing
many upon the place, and frighting others with the sudden alarm of their guns,
made them run into the river, where the swiftness of the stream carrying them
down a steep fall, they perished in the waters; some getting into canoes, sank
or overset by the shooting of our men; others creeping for shelter, under the
banks of the great river, were espied by our men and killed with their swords.
-- Some of their prisoners afterward owned that they lost above three hundred,
some whereof were principal men, sachems and some of their best fighting men
that were left. -- Nor did they seem ever to have recovered themselves after
this defeat, but their ruin immediately followed upon it" When our people first
fired upon them they cried out, Mohawks! but in the morning discovering their
mistake, they rallied their scattered men, and Capt. Turner being unwell, and
so "not able for want of bodily strength (no ways defective for want of skill
or courage) to assist or direct in making a retreat; some of the enemy fell
upon the guards that kept the horses, others persued them in the rear, so as
our men sustained pretty much damage as they retired, missing after their
return thirty-eight of their men." One of whom was Capt. Turner, who was
afterward found and buried. Hubbard's history of that war. p. 88, 94.
Dr. Stephen Williams says, "There were many remarkables in this affair (as
related by Jonathan Wells, Esquire; who was present) which are taken notice of by
Mr. Hubbard, or Dr. Mather." Appendix to his father and Deerfield's captivity.
p. 66.
Mr. Hubbard's account was examined and approved by three gentlemen of the
council, and so was published by authority. All the rest of the baptists who
were in that action, but their Captain were preserved and returned. And as they
again meet with cruel treatment four years after, both from rulers and
ministers, and the old charge of denying magistracy was revived, they said in
answer thereto.

1st. "IT is directly against our principles, and contrary to what we asserted
in a confession of our faith, that we gave into the court, as also to that
confession of our faith lately set forth by our brethren in Old-England, which
confession we own in every particular. The confession published in London, in
1677, and revised in 1689.
2. Our continual prayer to God for them, according to 1 Timothy ii. 1, 2, will
witness against this charge. 3. Our constant subjection and obedience to their
laws, both actively, as far as we can with a good conscience, and where we
could not actively, there have we been passively obedient; in suffering what
they inflicted on us, without seeking any revenge in the least. 4. In paying
all due demands whatsoever; not being desirous to withhold from Caesar at any
time, any of his dues. In a word, both our persons and estates are always ready
at command to be serviceable in the defense of the country; yea and have been
voluntarily offered on the high places of the field, in the time of the
country's greatest extremity. -- Among whom was William Turner, whom they
pleased to make Captain of that company, who had been one of the greatest
sufferers among us, for the profession of religion. He was a very worthy man
for soldiery; and Edward Drinker, who had been another sufferer, whom they
pleased to make Lieutenant; and by the presence of the Lord with them, they
were made instruments of the preservation of one town from the rage of the
heathen, who violently broke into it, but they being there beat them out. And
after that by Capt. Turner, who was then commander in chief, as an instrument
in the hand of the Lord, was the greatest blow struck to the Indians of any
they had received; for after this they were broken and scattered, so that they
were overcome and sudd^ed with ease. Here it is to be observed that those who
had suffered so much from the country, and scandalized as enemies to the
country, and their privileges, freely offering themselves in their service have
been (through the Lord's presence with them) some of the principal instruments
to subdue the barbarous heathen, and to deliver the country from its greatest
distress; which may stand as a witness of our fidelity to the government to the
world's end. We have been vilified and greatly reproached, and are at this day,
it being without any just reason laid to us, that we are one chief cause of all
the judgments of God on the land. We do not excuse ourselves, as not having a
share or part in many of the sins that have provoked the Lord against poor
New England; neither have we been freed from having part with others in the
general calamities that God has brought on this poor place. Yet it is
observable bow graciously the Lord has dealt with us; that in the time of
great mortallity by the smallpox, when so many hundreds died, though many of
us were visited with that visitation, yet not one of our society was removed by
it; but it was not for any thing in us, that the Lord spared us, but for his
names sake, that the mouth of our adversaries might be silent." Russell's
narrative, p. 11, 12.
But in answer to this Mr. Willard said,

"THE German anabaptists were enemies to civil government, we hope these
(though they have shown too much contempt of authority) are not so far gone.
But for his so gloriously emblazoning their service in the late wars, it is
neither to the purpose, nor of much moment. That they did join against the
common enemy is true. Swanzey (a place chiefly consisting of anabaptists, and
where they had a church) was the place where the enemy made the first onset. --
Besides, any man would fight, rather than have his throat cut; it was not for
religion, nor civil government, but for lives and estates. -- Nor did the
Indians receive the greatest blow at that time; nor it is the anabaptists true,
but vain glory, to set such an encomium upon their own deeds. -- We have
dismissed the charge, now comes a strong argument of their orthodoxy, a witness
from Heaven, viz. their happy preservation in the time of the smallpox. Let it
be remembered, that one of their perswation died of it at Woborn, (where John
Russell lived, and should have observed it) and many of their children. But be
it so; their society is small, and scattered from Dan to Beersheba. And who
knows, but God might spare them in judgment, to harden them? These are too high
things for us; only when God comes to chasten his people, those that are not
chastened, may ask whether they are not bastards?" He had before said, "As the
honored magistrates here are christians, so have they judged it their duty to
maintain the ways of Christ, and strengthen them by civil laws, which has not
only been the practice of reformers of old, but the constant judgment of the
church of Christ ever since the apostles. -- On this principal our worthy
rulers have made laws against many sects and intruders, and among the rest the
anabaptists. That in quelling the anabaptists they do not oppose the truth, but
suppress error, they are fully persuaded; and although they never pretended to
a lordship over men's consciences, yet they account the outward man is subject
to them: and if they must tarry till all men are agreed about what is truth,
before we oppose error, we shall stay till there is no need of it." Ne suitor.
p. 23, 24.


ACCORDING to this, we are not to imagine that those ministers ever intended to
lord it over Thomas Gould's conscience, when they censured him for not standing
up, and looking on when they sprinkled infants in the sacred name. He might
have thought what he pleased of it inwardly, if he would but have honored them
before the people; 1 Samuel xv, 30.
and though for refusing so to do, they excluded him from the ordinance of the
supper for seven years, and then for taking another method to enjoy it, they
moved the rulers to di^franchize, fine, imprison and banish him, yet all this
was for error in his outward man, not in his conscience! neither must it be
supposed, that vain glory had any influence in the emblazoning of things on
their side; for all these things were done by orthodox ministers, and christian
rulers. But let the anabaptists offer themselves ever so willingly, and at a
time when the main of the enemy were remote from their churches, both of Boston
and Swanzey; and let them do ever so great public service, yet it must not be
thought that they were moved thereto, either by religion or loyalty. No, all
proceeded either from love to the world, or else fear of having their throats
cut by the Indians in Boston, if they had not gone a hundred miles into the
country to meet them! Which is spoken, not in contempt to any man's person, but
to expose and detect that self-flatiery which so often deceives mankind. The
above is all the mention I ever saw, in any publication from that party, that
shows the chief commander in the fall-fight to have been a baptist. Most of
their histories of that war mention his name, but not a word of his being the
man who had before suffered in the baptists cause. And lest it should detect
the slanders they still were casting upon our denomination, they having gained
his son to their party, entirely concealed this fact from his numerous
posterity. For though his grandson, Capt. William Turner of Swanzey embraced
our principals, which he continued in after he removed to Newport, where he
died in 1759, bequeathing, among other legacies in his will, his lands in
Fall-town, adjoining to the place where his grandfather was slain; yet in June
1774, I was conversing with one of his daughters, together with her son,
William Turner Millar, Esquire; both members of the baptist church in Warren, and
they told me, they had often heard of their ancestors exploits and death in
Philip's war, but never a word before of his being a baptist, or of his
sufferings in that cause. Neither have any of their historians ever ventured to
publish a particular account of the baptist sufferings, as they have of the
Quakers. For which I can give no better reason than, because they could find
encroachments upon their rights in the batter to found a plea upon, which they
could not in the former. And the author of the Magnalia plainly expressed his
unwillingness, that the records thereof should be kept any where.

CAPTAIN Benjamin Church of Duxbury near Plymouth, who had made some beginning
at Sokonet, now Little-Compton, east of Rhode Island, the year before the war,
carried his family on that Island after it began, as a place in his opinion of
greater safety than Duxbury or Plymouth; and he was an active and successful
commander through the war. As he knew that Philip had forced the Sokonet
Indians into the war, contrary to the minds of the leading part of them, he
against his friends advice, went over in a canoe, and adventered himself among
them in June this year, and gained them over to our side, by whose help he took
great numbers of the enemy from day to day, who had now lost all their courage.
At length returning to visit his wife, whose anxious mind fainted to see him
again well; he was immediately informed by Major Sanford and Capt. Golding,
that one of Philip's men had fled from him (then at the foot of Mount-Hope) and
was come over to the Island. Hereupon they all put spurs to their horses, and
having heard the Indian's account, crossed the ferry in the night with a few
men, and after Capt. Church had stationed his ambush, of the Rhode Island
gentlemen, beat up Philip's headquarters, upon which he set out to flee
through a little swamp, but after an English man had snapt his gun at him
without effect, Alderman, an Indian, fired a bullet through his heart on August
12, 1676, a little before the break of day; after which the war was soon
brought to a close.

THIS summary of that bloody war I have carefully collected from a great variety
of histories and accounts. And upon the whole, it was said, that in this war
were slain, twelve Captians and about six hundred men. That about one thousand,
two hundred houses were burnt, eight thousand head of cattle, and many thousand
bushels of grain destroyed; and also three thousand Indians. The loss to the
English colonies, was computed at L 150,000 sterling, and Capt. Tom, with
another chief of the christian Indians at Natick, were taken and hanged at
Boston, for being active instruments of those mischiefs. Mast. history, vol. 3,
p. 493.
Though many others were faithful. Of those twelve Captains, Gallop, Seily and
Marshall, (who were slain at the Narraganset fort) were of Connecticut;
Hutchinson, Beers, Lothrop, Devenport, Gardner, Johnson, Wadsworth and Turner,
were of the Massachusetts, and Pierce was of Situate in Plymouth colony; from
whence one baptist elder of that name, and many members of the baptist churches
of Swanzey, Rehoboth and other places have sprung.

ON November 29, this year Mr. Samuel Hubbard wrote to Mr. Edward Stennett, in
England. Whose son and grandson, named Joseph, and great-grand son named
Samuel, have been noted baptist ministers in London, (...) two latter, Doctor's
of divintity.
and after what is recited in the beginning of this Chapter, he further said of
the Indians, "They have done much harm in our bordering towns, as Warwick,
destroyed by fires; only most of the people are here and their goods, and some
of their cattle; and the like at Pawtuxet and Providence, though not altogether
desstroyed, for a garrison remains there to this day. And for the other side
over against us on the main, which once was ours, and is I judge by charter,
many are killed by the Indians, the rest came to us with what they could bring.
Connecticut army, Plymouth and Bay armies being there, wasted very much; when
they left it, the Indians burnt near all that was left. In Plymouth the wars
began, and are sore wasted; the Bay lost very many men. Connecticut did most
service, and I have not heard of one town destroyed or fired in that colony. In
the beginning of these troubles of the wars, Lieutenant Joseph Tory, elder of
Mr. Clarke's church, having but one daughter living at Squamicot [Westerly] and
his wife being there, he said unto me, come let us send a boat to Squamicot, my
all is there and part of yours. We sent a boat so as his wife, his daughter,
and son-in-law, and all their children, and my two daughters and their children
(one had eight, the other three, with an apprentice boy) all came, and brother
John Crandal and his family, with as many others as could possibly come. My son
Clarke came afterward before winter, and my other daughter's husband came in
the spring, and they all have been at my house to this day. Now dear brother,
although we are not destroyed by the Indians, God has visited this land by
taking away many by death; and in this place, of all sorts. Of the old church
first Mr. Joseph Tory, then my dear brother John Crandal, then Mr. John Clarke,
then William Weeden, a deacon, then John Salmon: a sad stroke in very deed:
young men and maids to this day, I never knew or heard the like in New England.
Last week four or five were buried in this town -- Brother Turner went to war,
and God prospered him for a time, but he is now killed by the Indians; the rest
are well and enjoy their liberty. Mr. Miles that was at Swanzey, is now with
them. Brother William Gibson, who came from Old-England with brother Mumford,
is now gone to New London to visit our brethren there." Mr. Mumford had been
over to London, and he with Mr. Gibson returned to Boston, in October 1675; who
afterward succeeded elder Hiscox in the pastoral office at Newport.

THE above account of the preservation of Connecticut, as well as the other
articles expressed are just, as far as I can learn. The Mohegan Indians, under
Uncas, did the English great service in that war. I have seen scarce any
account of any other damages in Swanzey and Rehoboth, beside what have been
recited, except the Indians killing Capt. Willet's son near the garrison in
Swanzey this year. Middleborough and Dartmouth were but just begun before the
war, and when it came on, the English and part of the Indians therein, removed
to Plymouth and other places of greater safety; and the large body of natives
near to and upon Cape-Cod, continued in amity with the English, as those on the
Islands south of it also did; and of the latter I have met with the following
entertaining account.

THOMAS MAYHEW, Esquire; obtained agrant of Martha's-Vineyard, with the islands
adjacent, and began a settlement at Edgarton on the east part of the Vineyard,
in 1642, where he was their chief ruler, and his son their minister In 1646,
the son began to preach to the Indians with success; to promote which cause his
father told them, "That by order from the crown of England, he was to govern
the English who should inhabit those Islands; that his royal master was in
power far above any of the Indian monarchs; but that as he was great and
powerful, so he was a lover of justice; and that therefore he would in no
measure invade their jurisdictions, but on the contrary assist them if need
required; that religion and government were distinct things, and their sachems
might retain their just authority, though their subjects were christians." And
he practiced according to his profession; "for he would not suffer any to
injure them, either in their goods, lands or persons. They always found a
father and protector in him; and he was so far from introduceing any form of
government among them against their wills, that he first convinced them of the
advantage of it, and even brought them to desire him to introduce and settle
it." This wise conduct and the gospel means that were used with them, produced
such happy effects, that a christian church was formed and organized among them
five years before this war. And now in the time of it, the government furnished
those christian Indians with arms and ammunition, and employed them to defend
the Islands against the enemy. "And so faithful were they, that they not only
resolutely rejected the strong solicitations of the natives on the
neighboring Main, but, in observance of the gerneral orders given them, when
any landed to solicit them though some were nearly related by marraige and
others by blood, yet the Island Indians would immediately bring them before the
governor to attend his pleasure." By the divine blessing on these means, though
the Indians there were twenty to one of the English, yet through this extensive
and bloody war, "These Islands enjoyed a perfect calm of peace; and the people
wrought and dwell secure and quiet." Prices's appendix to Mayhew's Indian
converts, p 293 -- 296. In that performance I find that Mr. Peter Foulger was
early employed as a "schoolmaster among those Indians, and when young Mr.
Mayhew went for England, in 1667, Mr. Prince says, they had not only several
Indian teachers on the Island but also "and able, godly Englishman named Peter
Foulger, employed in teaching the youth in reading, writing and the principles
of religion by catechizing; being well learned likewise in the scripture, and
capable of helping them in religious matters" p. 291. I find by Mr. Samuel
Hubbard, that M. Foulger became a baptist, and joined Mr. Clarke's church about
the time of this war; as Thomas Weft an English man, and some Indians from
thence did to Mr. Hiscox's church, in 1680. And Mr. Foulger promoted the
baptist priciples among the Indians. Though one of them named Japeth, who had
been his scholar, and now was got to be a noted teacher, reminded him that he
had formerly warned them against false teachers that would come, and said he,
"Now sir, I find your prediction true for you yourself are become one of these
teachers, you cautioned us against; I am therefore fully resolved to take your
good counsel, and not believe you, but will continue steadfast in the truths
wherein you formerly instructed me." Mayhew, p. 49.50. However he found others
no to be so resolute, for by the time that their governor Mayhew died, in 1681,
the baptist principles had prevailed considerably among them; and by the year
1694, they had one baptist church on the Vineyard among the christian Indians,
and another on Nantucket. Magnalia, b. 6, p. 56. The first Indian pastor over
those baptists on the Vineyard, that I have seen any account of, was S^ephen
Tackamason. He first joined to a church of the other denomination, in or about
1690. Mr. Mayhew informs us, that he was rebaptized some years after, and
became a member and a teacher of that church, but says, "However, he appeared
to be so serious a man, that I cannot but judge, that he acted according to the
dictates of his conscience in what he did, and not out of any base or fordid
ends." He died in Chilmark, in 1708; and our author says, "I had frequent
conversation with him while he was in health, and sometimes -- in the time of
that long sickness whereof he died; and never from first to last saw any thing
by him, that made me any ways suspect he integrity of his heart, but did ever
think him to be a godly and disc^eet man. The last time I went to see him, he
professed his good opinion of those people and churches, from whom he differed
in his apprehensions about the subjects and mode of baptism, and blamed some of
his brethren for being too uncharitable and censorious toward them; and he on
other subjects, discoursed like a good christian. -- He seemed not to be at all
terrified at the approaches of death toward him, of which he was very
sensible, but appeared to enjoy that peace in his soul which passes
understanding." P. 42. -- 44. These are the words of Mr. Experience Mayhew, in
his Indian converts, published in 1727. His worthy son who succeeds him in the
ministry among the Indians on the Island, treated one of my brethren in the
ministry, very friendly when he was over and preached among those baptists,
near three years ago. I had requested my friend to collect some account of
those baptists, and he applied to Mr. Mayhew for that purpose; who promised he
would get the best intelligence he could concerning them, from an aged Aunt of
his, who retained her mental powers remarkably and others. And he sent the same
in the following letter.

"REVEREND SIR,
In compliance with your request I have got the best information I could, with
respect to the origin of antipedobaptists at Martha's-Vineyard. My aged Aunt
informs me, that the first baptist minister among the Indians on the Island,
that she knew or heard of, was one Isaac Decamy, who came from the Main-land
with his family, and preached and administered the ordinances of baptism and
the Lord's Supper, a number of years: she is uncertain what year he came, but
according to the best of her memory the said Decamy died near sixty years
agone: she says further, that he was a man of a sober life and conversation.
The next Indian minister of this denomination, by the best intelligence I can
get, was Jonas Horswet, who preached and administered the ordinances to a small
society of baptists at Gayhead. The next was Ephraim Abraham, originally of
Chappaquidick, at the east end of the Island, who had the charge of the society
at Gayhead, as also of one, which about this time was formed at said
Chappequidick. The next ordained minister was Samuel Kakenchew, whom I had a
personal acquaintance with: he lived at Chappaquidick, was esteemed by such as
knew him, to be a man of sense, and of a regular and christian life and
conversation. There were several other preachers among them, but not ordained;
except Silas Paul, who is now living, and is an ordained pastor of the baptist
church at Gayhead, and who also takes upon him the care of the small society of
that denomination at Chappaquidick; preaching occasionally and administering
the ordinanoes to them. He is the only Indian minister of this denomination now
upon this Island.

THIS is the best information that can be obtained by your friend and
fellow laborer in the work of the ministry.

ZECHARIAH MAYHEW."
Chilmark, 27 August, 1774.

THIS was directed to elder Hunt. who says the said Paul informed him, that he
was then 34 years old, was baptized in 1758, ordalned in 1763; that the church
at Gayhead had 13 members, and the other 16.




NINEGRET and his Nyantick subjects, who dwelt from Point Judith up to
Westerly, on the shore south of the Narragansets, did not join in that war; and
a considerable number of their descendants now live there in Charlestown; and
in 1741 a great reformation took place among them; a baptist church was formed
there some years after over whom James Simons was ordained; and since that
Samuel Niles, both of their own nation; and a considerable number of them have
given lasting evidence of their being pious christians.

It may be proper to take some particular notice here of Mr. Clarke, who left
as spotless a character as any man I knew of, that ever acted in any public
station in this coutry. He was born October 8, 1609; married Elizabeth,
daughter of John Harges, Esquire; of Bedfordshire. In a power of attorney signed by
them, May 12, 1656, he styles himself John Clarke, physician of London. It was
for the recovery of a legacy of L20 per annum during her life, that was given
her by her father out of the manor of Wresling worth Bedfordshire. Where he
had his education I know not; but the following clause in his will may give
some idea of his learning, viz "Item, unto my loving friend Richard Baily, I
give and bequeath, my concordance and lexicon to it belonging, written by
myself, being the fruit of several years study; my Hebrew Bibles, Buxtorss's
and Passor's lexicon, Cotton's conccidance, and all the rest of my books." His
first wife died at Newport without an issue, and Feb. 1. 1671, he married Mrs.
Jane Fletcher, by whom Feb 14, 1672, he had a daughter born; but the mother
died the 19th of April following, and the daughter May 18, 1673. His third wife
was the widow Sarah Davis, who survived him, he gave some legacies, both to her
and to the children she had by her former husband, Mr. Baily came from London
with him, in 1664.
The Massachusett writers have been so watchful and careful, to publish
whatever they could find, which might seem to countenance the severities, they
used toward dissenters from their way, that I expected to find some thing of
that nature against Mr. Clarke; but have happily been disappointed. Though he
was disarmed by them, in 1637, and imprisoned and fined at Boston, in 1651, and
he exposed their injustice and cruelty, to him and his berthren, in print the
next year, and continued in England, to oppose and defeat all their attempts at
the court there against his colony, till he obtained their present charter; yet
among all their authors or records, that I have searched, I have not met with a
single reflection cast upon him by any one; which I think is very
extraordinary. There was doubtless enough said against him, for his principles
of believers baptism, and liberty of conscience, to secure him from the woe, of
being spoken well of by all men; yet, like Daniel, it seems as if his enemies
could find no fault in him in matter of the kingdom, but only concerning the
law of his God.

FEW men ever merited the title of a Patriot more than he did; for he was a
principal procurer of Rhode Island, for sufferers and exiles. And when their
rights and liberties were grossly invaded, he crossed the boistrous ocean, and
exerted all his influence, in twelve years watchful and diligent labors, for
his colony at the British court, till he obtained a new charter for them, of
great and distinguishing privileges; for the accomplishment of which, he
mortgaged his own estate in Newport, willing to venture his all, in so good a
cause, though he was not insensable of the coveteousness and ingratitude of
some great pretenders to liberty in that colony; whose influence had caused a
great deal of trouble and expense to Mr. Williams, without any suitable
recompense. Six years after Mr. Williams obtained their first charter, viz --
On March 22, 1650, he presented a paper to the deputies and inhabitants of
Providence, which contained four request for others, and a fifth for himself,
wherein he says. "I cannot be so unthankful to you, and so insensible of my own
families comfort, as not to take notice of your continued and constant love and
care, in your many public and solemn orders for the payment of that money due
unto me about the charter. It is true, I have never demanded it; yea, I have
been truly desirous, that it might have been laid out for some further public
benefit in each town; but observing your loving resolution to the contrary, I
have at last resolved to write unto you (as I have also lately done to
Portsmouth and Newport) about the better ordering of it to my advantage I have
here, through God's providence, convenience of improving some goats; my request
is therefore that, if it may be without much trouble, you would please to order
the payment of it in cattle of that kind. I have been solicited, and have
promised my help about iron works, when the matter is ripe; earnestly desirous
every way to further the good of the town of Providence, to which I am so much
engaged, and to yourselves the loving inhabitants thereof, to whom I desire to
be your truly loving and ever faithful ROGER WILLIAMS."

YET he never received all his pay for that first charter. And though the first
assembly that met after they received the second, voted Mr. Clarke the reward
that has been mentioned, yet they were very backward about fulfilling their
promise. Their general assemblies from year to year, wrote to stir up the towns
thereto; but at the assemb;y of April 2, 1672, an account was exhibited,
examined, approved and attested by governor Arnold and three assistants, which
is now extant under their own hands, wherein it appears, that when Mr. Clarke
obtained said charter, he had received but L. 2^^ 3 s though the charter with
his time and pains, cost L. 6^1, 17 s 10 d. an ^ool of which was then due to
him, and was ordered to be paid in provision pay, two pounds for one; but he
never received any of it in his lifetime. By his papers I find that he
mortgaged his estate in Newport, to Capt. Richard Deane of London, the same
month that he procured the charter; and that it was not taken up till Sept. 5,
1699, when the last payment of L 115, was made to Capt. Deane's beirs


The inventions of men are scarce ever more fruitful, than in finding out ways
to get money, and excuses to keep it; but how few have parted with it for
public good, so freely as Mr. Williams and Mr. Clarke did?

AFTER Mr. Clarke's return, he was improved in various public offices; was
elected deputy governor three years successively, in two of which he accepted
the office; but all the concern of the state did not prevail with him, as it
has done with many, to neglect the affairs of religion. His church records and
other writings prove, the continuance of his pastoral relation to the first
church in Newport, and his care and labors to uphold gospel worship, and
discipline therein. And the instrument by which he settled his last concerns in
this world, shows what his faith and hope were, as to that which is to come;
for therein he says, "Whereas I John Clarke of Newport, in the colony of
Rhode Island, and Providence plantations in New England, physician, am at this
present, through the abundant goodness and mercy of my God, though weak in my
body, yet sound in my memory and understanding, and being sensible of the
inconveniences that may ensue in case I should not set my house in order,
before this spirit of mine be called by the Lord to remove out of this
tabernacle, do therefore make and declare this my last will and testament, in
manner following; willing and readily resigning up my soul unto my merciful
Redeemer, through faith in whose death I firmly hope and believe, to escape
from that second hurting death, and through his resurrection and life, to be
glorified with him in life eternal. And my spirit being returned out of this
frail body, in which it has conversed for about sixty-six years my will is,
that it be decently intered, without any vain ostentation, between my loving
wives Elizabeth and Jane, already deceased, in hopeful expectation, that the
same Redeemer who has laid down a price both for my soul and body, will raise
it up at the last day a spiritual one, that they may together be singing
hallelujah unto him to all eternity." Copied from the original will, dated
April 20, 1676; and he quitted our world the same day. As he left no child, he
gave many legacies to his relations and friends, both in that colony and the
Massachusetts. His brother Joseph Clarke was early a member of the church in
Newport with him, and was often a magistrate of the Colony; whose son Joseph
was also a member of that church, and then of the church in Westerly, where his
posterity are numerous and respectable to this day. Elder Clarke, gave a
particular lot of land in Newport, to his brother's son John, whose posterity
have also been respectable among the baptists ever since, one of whom is Mr.
Edward Clarke, now a gospel preacher near Providence. Then after giving a small
lot in town to his church, and giving his wife the use of his house and farm,
containing more than a 150 acres, of upland and marshes, together with ten
acres in a part of Newport, called the neck, during her life, he gave said farm
and neck to his friends, William Weeden, Philip Smith and Richard Baily, and to
their assigns, "qualified and chosen in manner following forever; that is to
say, that when it shall happen that either of them three decease, the two
surviving shall make choice of an understanding person, fearing the Lord, to
succeed in the place of him so deceased; and in case the two surviving differ
in their choice of the person to succeed in the room of him so deceased, that
then the choice shall be decided by lot; which person so chosen shall be the
assignees of the said persons abovementioned, and shall have equal power to
act with them in all matters relating to the disposal of the profit or rent of
the said land and farm, from time to time; and so all persons chosen as
abovesaid to make good the said number of three, shall be deemed and taken to
be the assigns of the said William Weeden, Philip Smith and Richard Baily, and
none other; which said persons and their assigns, from time to time, chosen and
succeeding as above said, shall be seized of the said farm and land called the
neck, to the use and uses following forever; that is to say faithfully and
truly to distribute and dispose of the rent and profit of my said farm and
land, for the relief of the poor, or bringing up children unto learning, from
time to time forever, according to such instructions as I shall give unto them,
bearing even date with these presents." Which instructions are in these words,
viz "That in the disposal of that which the Lord has bestowed on (...) and I
have now betrusted you with, and you and your successors, shall have special
regard and care, to provide for those that fear the Lord; and in all things,
and at all times, so to discharge the trust which I have reposed in you, as may
be most for the glory of the Most High, and the good and benefit of those for
whom it is by me expressly designed.

JOHN CLARKE."

His estate was appraised at 1080 l. 12 s. by James Barkers, Thomas Ward, and
Philip Edes, who made oath to the inventory May 17, 1676. Said farm and neck
they appraised at 530 l. and its late annuel income has been 220 dollars, as me
honorable Jo^^^s Lyndon, Esquire one of the assigns, informs me; who says the first
assigns being Mr. Clarke's intimate friends, were informed by him, that his
intent was to provide for religious as well as civil instruction, though he did
not insert the word ministry, lest the national clergy should lay claim to it.
Therefore part of said profits have been improved to maintain religious
teaching in that church ever since. Complaint was made in 1721, that one of
these assigns was unfaithful in his trust, which caused the assembly to take
the ease in hand; who at length made a law to empower the town-council in each
town to enquire how all charitable donations therein were managed, and by a
jury of twelve men, upon oath, to assess damages upon delinquents; to whom
therefore the assigns abovesaid have annually been accountable ever since.


Oh! what miserable things are all earthly pleasures or glories, when compared
with such a life, and such a death! Mark the perfect man, and behold the
upright; for the end of that man is peace.

IT has often been observed, that when one heavy affliction comes upon a person
or people, others soon follow; which observation was remarkaly verefied this
year. For beside those already named, Mr. Mark Luker, an ancient member, and a
ruling elder of Mr. Clarke's church, died the December after him, leaving the
character of a very worthy walker.

ABOUT the beginning of 1677, came out Mr. Williams's account of his dispute
with the Quakers, upon which M. Cordington wrote over to his friend Fox and
said, "Here is a lying scandalous book of Roger Williams of Providence, printed
at Cambridge in New England -- I have known him about fifty years a mere
weathercock, constant only inconstancy: poor man! that does not know what
should become of his soul, if this night it should be taken from him. He was
for the priests, and took up their principles to fight against the truth, and
to gratify them and bad magistrates, that licked up his vomit, and wrote the
said scurrilous book; and so has transgressed for a piece of bread. And so are
all joined with the red dragon to pour out their flood against the man-child.
Into their secrets let not my soul come; my honor be not thou united. Dear G.
F. I may yet more prove what I have said. One while he is a separatest at
New-Plymouth, joining with them till they are weary of him (as from Morton's
memorial in print does appear;) another time you may have him a teacher or a
member of the church at Salem. O! then a great deal of devotion is pleaded in
women wearing of vails in their assemblies, as if the power of godliness was in
it; and to have the cross out of the colors; and then to be against the King's
patent and authority, and writes a large book in quarto against it. And
another time he is hired for money, and gets a patent from the long parliament,
so that it is not long, but he is off and on it again. One time for men's
wearing caps, and not hats for covering their faces; and again, hats and no
caps; one time for water baptism, men and women must be plunged into the water;
and then throw it all down again so that Cotton (who in his day did know the
power of God to salvation) said of him, that he was a h^rberdasher of small
questions against the power. So they ought to have fe^^ed God and the King,
that is to punish evildoers; and therefore not to meddle to their hurt, with
him that is given to change." And goes on to say he was credibly informed that
governor Leveret said he would give 20 l. and governor Winslow 5 l. rather than
that book should not be printed. Scott's letter which is mentioned in p. 108,
was also wrote on this occasion, wherein after accusing Mr. Williams of acting
contrary to his own principle of liberty of conscience, he says, "Witness his
presenting of it to the court at Newport; and when this would not take effect,
afterward when the commissioners were two of them at Providence, being in the
house of Thomas Olney; senior, Roger Williams propounded this question to them;
we have a people here among us, who will not act in our government with us,
what course shall we take with them? George Cartwright, one of the
commissioners, asked him what manner of persons they were? do they live quietly
and peaceably amongst you? This they could not deny; then he made this answer,
if they can govern themselves, they have no need of your government; at which
they were silent. This was told again by a women of the the house where the
speech was spoken, to another women, whom the complaint with the rest was made
against, who related it to me; but they are both dead, and cannot bear witness
with me to what was spoken there." Fox, part second, p. 245, 248.


THESE letters being sent over with the book to Fox, he with John Burnyeat
published them, with an answer to Williams, in 1678, which they entitled, A
New England firebrand quenched. Fox's former book in folio Williams says was
wrote against about six score authors and papers, to which Edward Buroughs
wrote a preface; and some things that they said in the dispute, turned his
thoughts so, as from those names he called his work, George Fox dug out of
his Buroughs. Such titles were more common in that day than ours, but I have
nothing to say to justify them, nor a great deal of the language that was used
on both sides. What I am concerned with is fact and not dialect. As Mr.
Williams had occasion to vindicate many things in the writings of Mr. Richard
Baxter, Dr. John Owen, and others that Fox had written against, whom Williams
call pious and learned men; he prefixed a particular address to them, in which
he says, "As to matters in difference between your selves and me, I have
willingly omitted them as knowing that many able and honest seamen in their
observations of the sun (one picture of Christ Jesus) differ sometimes in their
reckings, though uprightly aiming at, and bound for one port and harbor, I
humbly beg of you, 1. That you will more and more earnestly, heartily and
christianly study the things that differ without reflecting upon credit,
maintenance, liberty, and life itself remembering who it was that said, He that
loves his life shall lose it. 2. More and more study the prophesies and the
signs of the times: you know when it was that sive bishops, twenty-two
ministers, and almost three hundred other precious believers in the true Lord
Jesus, were sacrificed in the flames, for his ever blessed sake, against that
monstrous man of sin and bloody whore of Rome. These Foxians fancy is but a
feather to those high Pico^s and Tenariffs, the Pope and Mahomet; whom some of
you may live to see flung into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone." To
this they answer and say,

"HERE you may see, though there is, and has been great difference betwixt R.
W. R. B. and J. O. yet all these have written against God's people, that are in
the truth. -- But it is well if they come to repentance for what they have
done, for imprisoning and persecuting us, when they had both the sword and the
bag. And so R. W. and the rest of the New England priests, have been one with
them in the spirit of envy and malice against the people of God, like the wily
foxes, whose blood lies at all your doors. -- All may see what a devilish and
unchristian mind is in this R. W. whose desires are to. R. B. And J. O. that
they may see Mahomet, and the Turk, and the whore of Rome, and us (that he
joins with them) flung into the lake of fire." Fox, p. 11, 12^
And in answer to his attempt to prove that pride about spiritual matters was
the root and branch of their religion they say, "Roger, this is their
condition, and the New England priests and professors. Oh! that your eyes were
open that you might see it! and so what thou measurest to others, it will be
measured to thee again, pressed down and running over; and the god of the world
will fail thee in thy proofs, and has failed thee; as he did thy mother Eve,
and thy father Adam. Why not mine?
For this is the mouth of the pit, that thou speak of, and Lucifers boast in
thee against the children of the Lord, that are daily in jeopardy of their
lives, and some of them have lost their lives amongst you in New England, in
obedience to the command of Christ their savior. And we know, they hated
Christ our Lord and Master without a cause, and so you do as. But R. W. may
say, he does not persecute with his hands, but let him read p. 200 of his book,
wherein he declares himself, that a due and moderate restraint he would have
inflicted upon us, yea, through pretending conscience; and he would not have
this called persecution. But would R. W. be so served himself? No; but now he
lives in a peaceable government, where he cannot exercise his cruelty, and he
has not the sword in his hand, but is in a restless spirit, who grudgeth at
the liberty of others, and cannot be content with his own." Again they mention
his plea for liberty against the bloody tenet in 1652, and says, "But R. W. is
fallen from that plea, who now desires the magistrates to persecute us, etc.
and it must not be called persecution neither, as in p. 200; and many things we
would bring out of his former books, which would render him very uncertain; but
we shall forbear at the present, and leave him to the Lord, for his books
declare themselves, what he said then, and what he says now; but the reader
may see how R. W. has invented and forged many words against us, the people of
God in scorn called Quakers, which we never spoke nor wrote." Fox p. 10, 11
Part second, p. 212. In p. 241, and 242 they (...) their reference to that
page, in like manner.


THEY refer to that page, from one end to the other if their book, to prove him
a persecutor; and when the Magnalia came out in 1702, John Whiting wrote and
answer the next year, wherein he said of the author, "He compares Roger
Williams to a windmill, that by his rapid motion was like to set the whole
country on fire -- yet commends him, though such a windmill, for his
opposition against the Quakers -- but that haberdasher of small questions
against the power of godliness, as their great Cotton called him, was answered
by George Fox and John Burnyeat, in another book entitled, A New England
firebrand quenched." Whiting against Mather, p. 55, 56.
Joseph Grove published his abridgment of bishop with notes, the same year. And
against where bishop had mentioned Mr. Norton, Grove says, "This is that priest
Norton, whom Cotton Mather, in his late history of New England, so much
comm^nds, and with his brother in iniquity, John Wilson, ranks with John
Cotton, a man of a better spirit in his day." Bishop, p. 124.


THUS both parties could extol Mr. Cotton, while they vented their resentment
against Mr. Williams at a high rate; and by these means, and by some connection
with the Coddington family, Mr. Callender in his century sermon scrupled to own
him for a baptist, and in the dedication of it, set Mr. Coddington up as the
main founder and supporter of that colony. Though by his papers, I find he was
afterward convinced of his error herein; and let us now examine the evidences
refered to, to prove those dreadful charges again? Mr. Williams.

1. MORTON does not represent that the people were weary of him at Plymouth,
but that they were backward to grant his request of a dismission to Salem,
though their elder prevailed with them to do it; and governor Bradford blessed
God for the good effects of his ministry many years after he was banished, p.
54. 2. Like those he calls New England priests, Coddington tries to draw women's
vails, and men's hats and caps over people's eyes, to prevent a just view of
those affairs; Mr. Hubbard speaks of those vails, as the first article in his
account of the causes of Mr. Williams's banishment, though he is so honest as
to let us know, that it was Mr. Skeleton who introduced the custom at Salem,
which Mr. Williams only concurred with; and governor Hutchinson shows, that Mr.
Cotton had spoken in saver of that mode of dress it. England; but now he went
to Salem, and preached the people out of conceit of it. And among all Mr.
Williams's numerous writings, I have not met with any thing about it; no, nor
about his hat or cap though in the Massachusett records, I find that the year
before they banished him, when Coddington was both a magistrate and their
treasurer, they made a law against superfluous and expensive fashions, wherein
they prohibited the making or wearing of beaver hats upon penalty of forfeiting
of them if they did. 3. As to the cross in the military colors, which
Hutchinson also names as a sufficient ground for the authority to take hold of
Mr. Williams, it is certain from Winthrop Hubbard, and the colony records, that
the assembly took hold of Endicot and not Williams for that act, and put him
out of all office for one year therefore; and the Magnalia assures us, that the
scruple about that Popish sign prevailed in their colony, after Mr. Williams
was gone out of it. Book 7, p. 11.
4. Upon the affairs of the patent, Coddington artfully slips in the word
authority, willing with his friend Cotton, to have Williams appear as a rebel
against the king. We learn from governor Winthrop, that Mr. Williams first
wrote upon that subject at Plymouth, and after he came to Salem, the court
called for a copy of it, which he granted them, and then near the close of
1633, they had him before them; but he gave them such satisfaction about it,
that they disimissed him; yet they afterward brought in and re-examined that
matter, as one cause of his banishment. Williams's reply to Cotton, p. 277.
5. By the foregoing history, the reader may see with what grace the Quakers
could accuse Mr. Williams, of being mercinary or hired for money, in procuring
their first charter. And I find that when he was setting off upon his second
agency, to get Mr. Coddington's commission revoked, he, on Sept. 3, 1651, sold
his trading house and interest in Narragganset, for 50 l. to Mr. Richard Smith.
Newport Records
His great crime therefore, was his advancing such questions as he did, against
the power; which in plain terms, was a power to frame to themselves a gospel
and a Christ without the cross. A power to suspend obedience to what they
looked upon to be truth in England, and to compel others to their judgments,
when they had got out of the prelates reach. Yea, a power to confirm and
support such corruptions by oaths, both there and here. p. 71.

MR. Williams says, "cases have befallen myself in the chancery in England,
etc. of the loss of great sums, which I chose to bear through the Lord's help,
rather than yield to the formality (then and still in use) in God's worship,
though I offered to swear in weighty cases, by the name of God, as in the
presence of God, and to attest or call God to witness: and the judges told me
they would rest in my testimony, and way of swearing, but they could not
dispense with me without an act of parliament." Against the Quakers, appendix
p. 59. 60.
And in the face of all their reproaches, I am bold in it, that I know not of
one. Pedobaptist or Quaker, that came to this country in that age, who acted so
consistantly and steadily upon right principles about government and liberty,
as Mr. Williams did; neither do I think that they had, or have any cause to
glory over him as to religion. Though Mr. Cotton represented it as a mere
pretense for him to tell of church government, when he did not join fully with
any church that was then extant, yet he replies and says, "The institution of
any government and order is one thing, and the administration and execution,
which may be interrupted and eclipsed, in another Jeremiah could not rightly
have been judged a pretender, when he mourned for, and lamented the desolations
of the temple, priests, elders, altar and sacrifices; and neither he nor
Daniel, nor any of God's servants, could, during the desolation and captivity,
acknowledge either temple, altar of sacrifice aright, extant upon the face of
the earth, -- Although the discussor be not satisfied in the period of the
times and the manner of Christ's glorious appearing, yet his soul uprightly
desires to see and adore, and to be thankful to master Cotton, yea to the least
of the disciples of Christ, for any coal or spark of true light, among so many
false and pretended candles and candle sticks." Reply to Cotton, p, 1^6, 107.
Now as no man was permitted by Ezra, to officiate as a priest at God's altar,
but those who would find their register of a lawful descent from Aaron, and the
church had been through a more terrible captivity in mystical Babylon, between
the apostolic age and that we are upon, than the Jews had in Chaldea; how could
a man, so honest as Mr. Williams was, receive any man to administer the
ordinance of the supper to him, who could not produce a register of his
succession from the apostles? p. 110. I know of no other consistant way, to get
over this difficulty but this; that as the lawful seed of Aaron were to govern
in the Jewish church, so are the spiritual seed of Christ to govern in his
church, into which none ought to be admitted, without gospel evidence of their
being such; and it seems that Mr. Williams had not attained to a clear
settlement in this point. But in my opinion his greatest mistake, when he first
came to this country was, his blending the duties of natural and revealed
religion too much together. The light of nature teaches the importance of
seeking to God for what we need, and of praising him for what we receive; which
duties ought to be inculcated upon all men, as much as love to God or our
neighbors; while the revealed institutions of baptism and the supper, are
tokens of fellowship with Christ, and therefore cannot be our duty to perform
before we are united to him. Pasalms, 107, Acts 17, 27. Romans 1, 20, 21. and 6.3
-- 5.^ Cor. 10, 16. But for a while, Mr. Williams seemed to limit these two
kinds of duties alike to the regenerate. It is also well known, that the divine
ruler is perfect, but that the best of men in this state are imperfect, and how
far we are to exercise forbearance, and how not, has not been an easy ^^^stion
to the most enlightened saints; yet Mr. Williams's grand crime in the view of
both of these parties, was because he would not yield to their power in this
matter. And the passage the Quakers so often appealed to, as an evidence of his
being a bloody persecutor, is as follows.

AN author had said, the Quakers spirit does teach them to honor no man, Upon
which Fox said, "That is a lie; for it teaches them to have all men in esteem
and to honor all men in the Lord; yet they are convinced by the law as
transgressors if they respect men's persons as you do. In reply to which Mr. W.
says, "All men may see how truly they honor all in the Lord, and what Lord they
mean, when his first word to his opposite is that most provoking term, that is
a lie. It is true that Christ Jesus and his servants, used sharp reproofs,
similitudes, etc. but thus suddenly at the first dash to give fire, thou lie,
that is a lie, etc. Shows neither religion nor civility, but a barbarous
spirit, for they that know the barbarians, know how common that word is in all
their mouth's -- The most Holy and only Wise knows how proudly and simply, and
barbarously they have run into uncivil and inhuman behavior toward all their
superiors, the eldest and highest, how they have declared by principle and
practice, that there are no men to be respected in the world but themselves, as
being God's and Christ's. It is true our English bibles and grammar (as Fox in
his great learning often objects) makes thou to a single person, and thou in
holy scripture is used in a grave and respective way unto superiors, unto kings
and patents, and God himself. But 1. the Hebrew and Greek signify no more thou
than you, and so may be truly turned. 2. Every nation, every shire, every
calling have their particular properties or idioms of speech, which are
improper and ridiculuos with others. Hence these simple reformers are extremely
ridiculous in giving thou and thee to every body, which our nation commonly
gives to familiars only; and they are insufferably proud and contemptuous unto
all their superiors in using thou to every body, which our English idiom of
propriety of speech, uses in a way of familiarity, or anger, scorn and
contempt. I have therefore publicly declared myself, that a due and moderate
restraint, and punishing of these incivilities (though pretending conscience)
is so far from persecution, (properly so called) that it is a duty and command
of God unto all mankind, first in families, and thence into all human
societies." Williams, p. 199, 200.


THIS is all the passage in his whole book that speaks in favor of punishing
Quakers; and compared with the instance of Norton's incivilities to governor
Prince and others, and observing that the emphesies lies upon their manner of
using those words, the reader will judge, whether a moderate punishing of the
same, is any ways inconsistant with Mr. William's plea for liberty against Mr.
Cotton. And as to his practice, we learn expreslly that the instance Scott
refers to at Newport, was that of Harris's at the election, in 1655. And though
he and Mr. Coddington submitted to Mr. William's government the next year, (a
few months before the Quakers arrived) yet after that they and others became so
spiritual as to refuse to act therein. This is seems caused Mr. Williams to ask
Mr. Cartwright what they should do with them, which in their view was another
proof of his persecuting disposition. In 1665 their assembly framed an
engagment to the government, which they hoped those men would have taken, and
so have come in to act with them again; but in March 1666 they pleaded that
they could not in conscience do it, and prevailed with the assembly to make a
law, to allow those who pleaded, that they could not in conscience take either
that engagment, nor the oath of alliegence in England, to make their submission
to the government, either before the court or before two magistrates, in their
own words, instead of any that others could frame for them. And no sooner was
this point gained, than at the election in May ensuing, they got in a Quaker
deputy governor, and three magistrates; two of the latter being Coddington and
Harris. Harris was in the same office in 1667, when on July 2, he procured an
extraordinary meeting of the assembly, to try Mr. Fenner, (another magistrate)
for a rout which Harris charged him with making in Providence on June 3. But
the assembly acquitted Fenner, and fined Harris 50 l. and put him out of office,
choosing Stephen Arnold in his stead. The next fall lie was fined 10 s. for
breach of peace, and bound to his good behavior. Yet he had influence enough
in May 1668, to get again into the magistracy, and in the fall to have his 50
l. remitted. He was likewise in the same office in 1669; and as Connecticut
then revived their claim to the Narraganset country, he eagerly turned to
assist them, hoping doubtless, to share largely therein, if they prevailed.

IT seems that the agents who procured their charters, agreed that some persons
living near Mr. Smith's trading house in Narraganset, should have liberty to
choose which government they would be under; therefore from thence, and from
the words of Connecticut charter, they set out afresh to grasp all that country
to themselves. And for that end would come over from Stonington and knock
Westerly people down, and carry them off to goal, and persisted long in those
encroachments against the remonstrances of the authority of Rhode Island
colony; one of which they sent by Mr. John Crandal to Hartford, in May 1671.
The assembly at the same time made choice of Mr. Clarke as their agent, to go
again to England upon the affair; though after repeated applications to
Connecticut court, such a prospect appeared of having the matter settled by
treaty, that they revoked that appointment the next year. But Harris, finding
that the King's words in their charter had most explicitly fixed Paucatuck
river as the bounds betwixt the two colonies, openly attacked the validity of
the charter, because therein the King had granted full religious liberty,
notwithstanding the penal laws in England: Upon which Harris declared, "That
the King cannot dispense with the penal laws on the consciences of his
subjects, Papists or Protestants, at home or abroad." Their rulers then were
Benedict Arnold, governor John Clarke, deputy governor, John Cranston, John
Coggshall, James Barker, William Carpenter, Thomas Harris, Roger Williams,
William Baul^ton, John Albro, John Green, Benjamin Smith, assistants; John
Sanford recorder, James Rogers, general Sergeant, and Joseph Tory, attorney
general. And they committed Harris to prison for denying the King's authority
and prerogative. And when the assembly met at Newport, April 2, 1672, he
presented a petition to them by the hand of a Quaker, but, because not directed
in those words which his majesty, in his gracious charter has pleased to give
the title unto the corporation," the assembly voted not to take cognizance of
it. Colony Records.
At their election the next month they chose the first Quaker governor they
ever had in that colony; and Mr. Williams says, the Quakers prevailing, Harris,
by their means gets loose. Williams, p. 14, 206, 207.
These facts I have carefully collected from their colony records, compared
with Mr. Williams's account; to which they return no better answer than to say,
"It is like he does belie W. H. as he has done us; and, for thy story and
anger against William Harris, he is of age and able enough to speak for
himself." Fox, p. 21, 229.


FOX and other noted teachers of theirs were now come over, and gained many
proselytes; upon which Mr. Williams went to a general meeting they had at
Newport, and began to present to them some considerations concerning the true
Christ and the false, the true spirit and the false, but says I was cut off in
the midst, by the sudden prayer of one, and singing of another, etc. which is
afterward explained thus, viz. "I was stopped by the sudden praying of the
governor's wife, who also told me of her asking her husband at home, (meaning
Christ which I had touched upon) I rose and said, if a man had so alleged, I
would have answered him; but I would not countenance the violation of God's
order so much in making a reply to a woman in public. Hereupon J. Nicols stood
up and said, in Christ Jesus neither male nor female. I was replying to him and
to J. Burnyeats speech concerning their spirit, but was stopped by Burnyeats
sudden falling into prayer, and dismising the assembly. I resolved, with God's
help, to be patient and civil, and so ceased, not seeing a willingness in them
for me to proceed; which experience, made me not trouble G. Fox and the
assembly at Providence, but rather to make a fair and solemn offer of a dispute
about these matters." Williams, p. 2, 12.
To which they answer and say, "So here thou may see, it was thy spirit that
was cut by the spirit of God, that lead them to pray and sing in order; and
this thou call confusion; and thus thou judg^^t of things, thou know not,
with thy doting spirit. For the true Christ we know, who is our shepherd; and
the false spirit of Christ is eastly savoured in thee, which was cut off by the
spirit of prayer, and the spirit of singing, from the true spirit of Christ."
Fox, p. 17.


THUS each party call their own way order; but the order and decency which the
inspired apostle enjoined upon the church of Corinth, concerned the behavior
of their women, as distinguished from men; their women who had husbands, in the
plural number, who had each a distinct part to act in divine worship, which
they ought to know and attend unto. As all saints are one in Christ, there is
but one husband and one bride; and viewing things in this distinct light, tends
both to purity and peace; but the confounding of literal women with mystical
husbands, has often produced the grapes of Sodom and clusters of Gomorrah. And
among the many instances of the Quakers asuming a power to govern the
scriptures instead of being governed by them, take the following. The baptist
churches in Wales, gathered by our Mr. Miles and others, published a confession
of their faith, wherein they adopted the words of David in Psalm. 51, 5. To
which Fox, in p. 214 of his former book said, "David does not say, you were
conceived in sin, but I. John was sanctified from the womb, and the scriptures
speak of children that are clean. And so you do not speak as elders and
messengers of true churches, or men dividing the word aright, but you are one
against another, though you are all against them you call Quakers, that be in
the truth" In which passage says Mr. Williams, he discovers a strong
presumption that he never felt what the woeful estate of all mankind by nature
is. Appendix, p. 66, 67.
To which they reply and say, "Paul says, I am crucified with Christ (mark I
AM) and Christ lives in me: and the life that I live in the flesh, is by the
faith of the son of God, etc. is not the says victory? and thou fallest a
railing, and speaking of our conditions, which thou art ignorant of, and thy
own, and have abused both the scriptures and us." Fox, second part, p. 136.


IN July 1672, Mr. Williams drew up fourteen propositions, and enclosed them in
a letter to deputy governor Cranston, whom he styles, My kind friend, for him
to deliver them to Fox or his friends; in which Mr. Williams proposed a fair
dispute upon those points with any of them, seven propositions to be handled at
Newport, and the other at Providence, on the days they should appoint. By some
means the matter was delayed till Fox had sailed for England; after which John
Stubs, John Burnyeat and William Edmundson, engaged in the affair, and with
them Williams held the dispute at Newport, on the 9th, 10th and 12th of August,
and at Providence the 17th. When they began at Newport, he publicly declared
his motives to be these. "1. The vindicating HIS most holy name, which my soul
saw trodden in the dirt by satan clothed in Samuel's mantle, and the bright
garment of an angel of light, which once he was, but pride deceived him. 2. I
had in my eye the vindicating this colony for receiving such persons whom
others would not; we suffer for their sakes, and are accounted their abettors,
that therefore together with the improvement of our liberties which the God of
Heaven, and our King's majesty have graciously given us, I might give a public
testimony against their opinions in such a way and exercise, I judged it
incumbent upon my spirit and conscience to do (in some regards) more than most
in the colony. I may also truly says, 3. That I had it in my eye, that this
exercise might occasion some soul-consideration in many." William, p. 25, 26.
And as they dwelt so much upon the word light, and upon its coming into the
world with all mankind, he asked them in public,

"WHETHER it comes into them at the conception, or at the birth, or when else?
whether it was in all mankind before the coming and death of Christ or to those
since his coming, or both? whether it be in the understanding, will, memory,
affections, in any of them severally, or lodged in all of them jointly.?
Williams, p. 35.
In answer to which they say, "As to his unlearned questions, whether the light
comes into mankind at the conception, or at the birth, or when else? we leave
him to what is written John 1, 9. Christ is the true light, that lights every
man that comes into the world. So it is evident, ALL ARE LIGHTED that come
into the world; and the believers witnessed it to shine in their hearts; and
Abraham saw his light, or day; and in it David saw more light, which was before
Christ came in the flesh, John says, in the word which was in the beginning
was life, and the life was the light of men." Fox, p. 32.
Mr. Williams says, "The hinge and pinch of the difference lies in the
opposition which the Quakers make against the manhood of Christ Jesus to be yet
extent -- Who questions but Christ Jesus, as the sun in the Heavens,
influenceth all parts of the world in several respects, and nothing is hid from
his heart? He is felt in the bruised reed and smoking flax; in the poor in
spirit, in the hungry and thirsty after righteousness; sometimes in the hope of
glory to come, yea, in present joy unutterable and glorious: sometimes the
Lamb's wife is visibly asleep though her heart wakes; sometimes she is alarmed
by his knocking and is slugishly unwilling to open to him; sometimes she rises
and opens but he is gone, and she seeks for him by day and night and cannot
find him." But says he, "The Papists, Arminians and Quakers are one: 1. As to
the power of nature and free will in heavenly and spiritual matters. 2. As to
the loosing of true saving grace. 3. As to election and predestination in time,
upon obedience, and rejection, and reprobation upon rebellion and disobedience.
-- 4. The Quakers are brethren with the Socinians, in making Christ a type and
figure, a pattren and example how christians ought to walk; not that the blood
which he shed upon the cross at Jerusalem, was a sufficient price and
satisfaction unto God for the sins of the whole world." Williams, p. 137;
Appendix, p. 56.

To which they say, "This is like the rest of thy false charges and
comparisons; what do thou talk of election and predestination, etc. when thou
call the light of Christ an idol? for these are mystries to thee, who art
not come to take heed unto the light that shines in a dark place." Fox, p. 154.
See 2 Cor. 10, 1.

HIS last proposition was, that their spirit tended to arbitrary government and
firery persecution; upon which he said, "By an arbitrary government I do not
intend a ruling by force, for there could be no government in the world without
the sword; but arbitrary. I said came from arbitrium, which signifies will or
pleasure: and so my argument is, that persons immediately speaking from God, it
is impertinent and profane to clog and cumber them with laws, for the voice of
God, the law of laws, proceeds out of their mouth; than which there could be
none more just, wise or holy -- I told them I must crave their patience while I
must profess my fears, left the spirit by which they were guided, might run
them upon their own and others temporal destruction. I told them I thought they
had no such thing in their eye at present; but if power of the sword came into
their hands, it was easy to imagine, that whom the spirit (infaliable) decreed
to death, pesant or ^^^ce if it were possible, he must be executed." Williams,
p. 204.
To this they say, "Where there is no force there is no fear of slavery, and
such an arbitrary government no body was ever afraid of. -- But Roger, do
thou not accuse the people called Quakers of holding, that they are acted by
the spirit of God, and not by their own spirits? if so it is the arbitrium, or
will and pleasure of their God, and not their own wills and spirits that they
are acted by, and what harm is this to just government? or how does this set up
men's will and power? O thy blindness! thy darkness! and thy confusion!" Fox. P.
226.


HE then refered them to the passage before recited about the magistrates
subjecting all into his light; and closed that head with observing, that Christ
says, out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, and asks if any
professors of the christian name except Papists, were ever so sharp and cutting
with their tongue, as they, even to knowing and conscientious persons? From
whence he questions, what might be expected if whips, swords and halters were
permitted to fall into their hands? To which they say, "The tongues of God's
people have in all ages been as a fire and a sword to the wicked. -- It may be
as rationally questioned of the people of God in this age, as in former ages;
and God will reckon with thee, thou ungodly, unjust man, that insinuatest these
wicked things against a suffering, as well as harmless people! This spirit thou
art lead by in writing against us, would BURN us, as it lead thy forefathers to
burn the martyers in Smithfield; for ye are all of CAIN's race, and are found
in his steps, and shall have Cain's reward, if you repent not." Fox, p. 232.
This was their way of quenching a firebrand. --

THE Quakers prevailed so far, that in 1675, Mr. Coddington was governor, and
Mr. John Easton deputy governor; when finding that their spiritual power would
not secure them against the Indians, they gave out military commissions under
their hands and seals to arm both vessels and garrisons against them.
Callender, p. 80 -- Colony Records.
Harris was again chosen an assistant in the years 73, 74 and 76, in the last
of which Mr. S. Hubbard said in a letter to Boston, "The Quakers are still
upermost in government among us, I mean in outward rule, though we have put out
the chief, Mr. John Cranston is deputy governor." Mr. Williams book came out
soon after, and at their next election, May 2, 1677, the Quakers were left out
of office; and on June 28, Mr. Coddington wrote the forecited letter to his
friend Fox; which facts may enable us to account for the spirit of it. Mr.
Williams was again chosen a magistrate, but excused himself from that service;
yet he wrote thus to Providence, viz. "I pray the town that the place of
meeting be certain, and some course settled for payment, that the clerk and
sergeant be satisfied according to moderation* that the town business may go on
cheerfully, that the business of the rate (paid by so many already) be
finished, that the old custom of order be kept in our meetings, and those
unruly be reproved, or upon obstanacy, cast out from sober and freemens
company, that our ancient use of arbitration be brought into esteem again, that
(it being constantly reported that Connecticut is upon the gaining his
majesty's consent to enslave us to their parish worship) we consider what we
ought to do"

A SPECIAL court of commissioners met at Providence, October, 3, 1677, procured
by Harris; who by a jury gave his party five verdicts for land, the first of
which was against Gregory ^exter. Arthur Fenner, and the town of Providence,
wherein they gave, "two pounds in money damage and cost of court; and also that
the said defendants run the line equally between Pawtuxet river and
Wenasquatucket river, till they meet with a thwart line from the head of
Wenasquatucket river, directly running to Pawtuxet river." The two next verdicts
gave that party 30 l. damages in each, with lands further southward; of which
the town of Warwick, by the hands of Mr. Holden and Mr. Green, gave an account
two years after to the King, wherein they mention the former ill treatment they
had met with at Boston, and represent, that the late war was wholly caused by
the arbitrary conduct of the neighboring colonies, who after the Narraganset
fight in December, 1675, they say, "withdrew their forces from us, leaving our
unguarded towns to the destroyer, whereby the town of Warwick was wholly burnt,
great part of our goods and cattle lost and consumed, but the lives of most of
us reserved as a prey, supported with hope that yet in time of peace, we might
be enabled to re-build and provide for our distressed families and succeeding
generations -- But William Warris of Pautuxet, came over in 1674, and claimed
land in Narraganset by Indian purchase, and the King appointed the case to be
heard by commissioners, chosen out of the several colonies of New England. We
attended time and place according to summons, but the major part of the
commissioners, elected out of our professed and mortal enemies, out-voted those
of Rhode Island, granting and awarding to him the lands brought and improved by
your petitioners, also giving him great damages, notwithstanding the testimony
of one Mr. Williams, the first Indian perchaser of those lands, and other
material witnesses in our behalf, whereby above 5000 acres of land and medows,
belonging to the poor town of Warwick, and parts adjacent are taken away, and
we prohibited to rebuild, or attempt any thing for the support of our
dependances," and so went on to pray for relief, p. 299.

CONNECTICUT in the mean time had continued their encroachments upon the west
part of that colony, till a letter was obtained from the King dated July 9,
1679, confirming Rhode Island charter; upon which the assembly wrote to warn
them off their lands, and to charge their own people not to obey them. But at
the same time Harris had procured an order from the King to the authority of
the colony, to levy the aforesaid executions. In consequence whereof I have
seen warrants issued to John Smith of Newport, appointing him magistrate to
levy three of them, signed Nov. 24, 1679, by John Cranston, governor, Caleb
Carr, Joseph Clarke, Arthur Fenner and John Sanford, assistants. But this not
satisfying Harris, he soon set off again for England with new complaints. Mr.
Samuel Hubbard wrote to his children at Westerly the 7th of February following,
informing them or a rumor he heard of turning their governor out of his place,
and of putting a Quaker into it and of seting Narraganset, which they called the
King's province off by itself; and said he, "William Harris is gone for
Old-England, displeased at our courts act, and will not accept, though offered
it is said, to be Connecticut agent's attorney. God can have Ahithophel's
counsel to fall, and to hang himself." Poor man! he was taken and carried into
Turkish slavery, from whence he never returned. Thus ended the controversy with
him, whose first title to any of those lands was a free gift from Mr. Williams.

TWO considerations have moved me to be much larger and more particular upon
these unhappy affairs, than I had any thoughts of at first. One is, that
harrangues have often been made from pulpits, and in courts of justice, from
that time to ours, upon the great disorders of Rhode Island colony, to prove
that an established religion by human laws is exceeding necessary in every
government. I thought it duty, therefore to give the public a fair and full
state of those facts, to enable them to judge righteously concerning such
addresses. The other is, that I might plainly de^ect and expose the pernicious
nature, of imagining that dominion is founded in grace, or that religon endows
the subjects of it with a right to act as lawgivers and judges over others. In
the assembly that banished Mrs. Hutchinson, in 1637, Mr. Coddington said, "I do
not see any clear witness against her; and you know it is a rule of the court,
that no man may be a judge and accuser too." Mass. hist. vol. 2, p. 516.
But where was that rule when he, in his letter to Fox, acted the part of an
accuser, witness and judge against Mr. Williams, even as to the in ward state
of his soul! with all their talk about light, Mr. Cotton formerly (p. 159) and
the Quakers now, accused Mr. Williams of counteracting his own principles about
liberty of conscience, only for examining and bringing to light the nature of
their principles and behavior; and the word of truth tells us what light that
is, Mat. 6. 23. John 3.19, 21. The Quakers have had a fame among many for
honestly and liberty, and far be it from me to detract in the least from what
has truly been among them of that nature; and I readily grant that not only in
those respects, but also in their moderation in dress, and solemnity in
worship, (though not singularity) and hospitality to strangers they have
merited high commendation, and more so for their zeal against the slave trade.
Yet what a bondage is it to be under such a power as their first leaders
assumed? What pope ever spoke more haughtily than to say, "He lives in a
peaceable government, but is in a restless spirit, grudgeth at the liberty of
othrs, and cannot be content with his own," only because he sought in a
peaceable way to discharge his conscience, by bearing a plain testimony against
what appeared to him to be very corrupt and dangerous? And what sentence was
ever more unjust t^^n that which is delivered in their martyrbook? Grove tells
us the first part of it was published in 166^, the other in 1667, by that
zealous servant of the ^o^d, George Bishop. He lived in the city of ^ri^tol,
and he entitled his work, "New England judged, not by man's, but the spirit of
the Lord." And after his account of the whipping of Humphrey Norton and Deborah
Wilson, among the rest, he reads off his sentence thus -- "Whether they will
hear or forbear, they shall know that his prophets have been amongst them. --
So, see where you are, and in what case, ye blood thirsty enemies of God; ye
men of Boston, of Plymouth, patent, and New Haven; ye rulers of Sodom, and
inhabitants of Gomorrah, who are hardened against the hour of your visitation;
whose day is over; who delight in blood, in the blood of the saints of the Most
High God, to whom blood will be given, for ye are worthy; the Lord will come
upon ye, you that put his day afar off, and say, he delays his coming; I say,
He will come upon you, in a day that ye think not of, and in an hour of which
ye are not aware; and will cut you asunder, and appoint you your portion with
hypocrites and sinners; and ye shall be cast into the lake that burns with
fire and brimstone, there to be tormented with the devil and his angels, which
is the second death." And in 1703, in the margin against this sentence, Grove
said, This was fulfilled in the Indian wars, wherein many of them were cut to
pieces. Bishop, p. 206, 207.


NOW, if in Fox's view Mr. Williams discovered a devilish spirit, in telling
the ministers he wrote to, that perhaps some of them might live to see the Pope
and Mahomet cast into that lake, what a spirit did this great writer of theirs
discover? and what God did he worship, if this sentence came immediately from
him! The evident reason of their favorable opinion of Mr. Cotton above his
colleague, was his countenancing the power, by which Mrs. Hutchinson declared
that she should be delivered, and the court ruined with their posterity." P.
103. A gentleman of that assembly said she told him in London, that she had
never any great thing done about her, but it was revealed to her before hand:
to which she, before the court, replied, "I say the same thing again." Mass.
hist. vol. 2. p. 510.
And how was that revelation fulfilled? why Bishop says, "some of your patents
endeavored to get Rhode Island under some of your governments, which
occasioned some to remove under the Dutch, where Anne Hutchinson, and her son
Francies, and W. Collin's her son-in-law, with others, were murdered by the
Indians; the guilt and weight of whose blood lies upon you, as done by you; who
were people of an honest life, and good behavior, only differing from you"
Bishop, p. 225, 226.
See p. 118. And the first legislator and captain that was slain in Philip's
war was her son Edward, who, as Bishop tell's us, entered his protest at
Boston, in 1658, against their making a law to banish Quakers on pain of death.
Neither can I learn that any man who had ever been an assistant in their colony
was then slain by the Indians, except Mr. John Wickes, of Warwick who had been
a sufferer with Gorton; he was then killed in a very advanced age. Call^nder,
p. 93.
Put all these things together and shall we not say with Solomon, That which is
crooked cannot be made straight?

MR. Williams's zeal appeared to be directed, not against the person of any
man, but only against their errors. In the preface to his reply to Mr. Cotton
he says, "Since it pleased God to ^^y a command upon my conscience, to come in
as his poor witness in this great cause, I rejoice that it pleased him to
appoint so able and excellent an instrument to bolt out the truth to the bran;
though I can humbly say in God's holy presence, it is my constant heaviness and
soul's grief to differ from any fearing God; much more from Mr. Cotton, whom I
have ever desired, and still desire highly to esteem, and dearly to respect,
for so great a portion of mercy and grace vouchsafed unto him, and so many
truths of Christ maintained by him. Therefore (notwithstanding some of no
common judgment and respect to him, have said, he wrote his washings of the
bloody tenet in blood against Christ, and gall against me, yet) if upon so
slippery and narrow a passage, I have slipped into any term or expression
unbeseeming his person, or the cause of the Most High in hand, I humbly crave
pardon of God, and Mr. Cotton also." And though he could not say the like of
the chief teachers among the Quakers, yet he said, "Many truly humble souls may
be captivated among them. -- And many of the Quakers I love and honor." And he
said, "He that shall ponder the fathers polligamy, the best kings of Judah
suffering the high places, David's slaying Uriah, Asia's imprisoning the
prophet, Peter's rash using the sword, the disciples calling for fire from
Heaven, shall see cause to reprove the Quakers for their rash damning of others
from whom they have suffered." Williams, p. 1, 25, 71, 178.
But when they came to answer him, they were so far from regarding this
admonition, that where he spoke of the matter of the christian churches, viz.
true converts (see p. 144) and said in the margin, "this was and I hope is, the
principle of the New-English churches;" they spent three pages full of capitals
about their ^ufferings, to prove that it could not be ^o, and ^^l^st said, "So
it is clear, you that have destroyed men's lives, are not of God, but the devil"
Fox, p. 63, 66.
This was the temper of their teachers; but of others the two Easton's father
and son. Walter Clarke, and Henry Bull, were all worthy governors of that
denomination, and I find Mr. S. Hubbard expressing a considerable esteem also
for Mr. Coddington after his death, in a letter to a friend. Neither have I
found one reflection upon his person in all Mr. Williams's writings, unless a
plain recital of facts may be so called.

A NEW sect came out from among the Baptists about this time, who have caused
not a little trouble to themselves and others, of whom I have collected the
following brief account, chiefly from the letters preserved by Mr. Samuel
Hubbard. In the close of the year 1674, the family of Mr. James Rogers of
New London, called Mr. Crandal over from Westerly, who preached among them, and
baptized his sons John and James, and an Indian named Japheth. This alarmed the
other denomination and Mr. Bradstreet, minister at New London said he hoped the
next court would ta^^e a course with them. They sent to Newport, and elder
Hiscox, Mr. Hubbard and his s^n Clarke were sent to visit them in March 167^,
when Jonathan Rogers was also baptized, and all four of them were received as
members of their church, by prayer and laying on of hands. Hereupon John
Rogers's father-in-law, took his wife and children from him; and, upon her
complaints against him, he was carried before their deputy governor, and
committed to Hartford goal, from whence he wrote to Mr. Hubbard April 6, 1675.
How long he continued there I do not find, only he visited the church at
Newport the next September. In September 18, 1676, those four members went with
a boat, and brought elder Hiscox and Mr. Hubbard to New London again, when old
Mr. Rogers, his wife and daughter were all baptized and received into that
church; whereupon they were called before the magistrate, but were soon
released; though from that time they began to imprison the Rogers's for working
on the first day of the week. And when Mr. Hiscox and Mr. Hubbard visited them
again, and held worship with them two miles out of town on their sabbath Nov.
23, 1677, and Joseph Rogers's wife had next morning given them a satisfying
account of her experiences, John must needs have them go up to town to baptize
her there. Mr. Hubbard opposed it, but John carried the day; and while Mr.
Hiscox was preaching at town the constable came and took him, and they all went
before the magistrate; where also was the minister, Mr. Bradstreet, who had
much to say, about the good way that their fathers had set up. Upon which Mr.
Hubbard, obtaining leave to speak, said, "You are a young man, but I am an old
planter of about forty years, a beginner of Connecticut, and have been
persecuted for my conscience from this colony, and I can assure you, that the
old beginners were not for persecution, but we had liberty at first." After
further discourse the magistrate said, Could you not do it else whore? "A good
answer," says Mr. Hubbard; and so they were released and went to Samuel
Rogers's house, where his brother John put himself forward, prayed, and then
went out to the water and baptized his sister; upon which Mr. Hiscox was seized
again, as supposing he had done it, but John came before the magistrate, and
was forward to make known his act therein; so the others were released and
returned home.

JONATHAN ROGERS, had married Naomi Burdick, grand daughter, to Mr. Hubbard,
and on March 2, 1678, elder Hiscox baptized her at Westerly, together with
James Babcock, George Lamphere, and two others; and on the 5th of May following
Joseph Clarke wrote from thence to his father Hubbard, that John and James
Rogers with their father were in prison; having previously excommunicated
Jonathan, chiefly because he did not retain their judgment, of the unlawfulness
of using medicines, nor accuse himself before authority, for working on the
first day of the week." Hereupon the church at Newport, sent messengers to
New London about this matter, who re^orted on their return that, "a practice
was started up, (out of conscience) that because the world, yea, most
professors, pray in their families mornings and nights, and before meats and
after, in a customary way, therefore to forbear prayer in their families or at
meats publicly, except some are lead forth upon some special occasion; saying,
they find no command in the word of God for it." About this time, elder
Hiscox's church received letters from Dr. Chamberlain, whereof one was directed
to their church, he being of the same faith and order with them, the other was
directed as follows.

"PETER CHAMBERLAIN, senior, Doctor of both universities, and first and eldest
physician in ordinary to his majesty's person, according to the world, but
according to grace, a servant of the word of God; to the excellent and noble
governor of New England; grace, mercy, peace and truth, f^^m God our father,
and from our Lord Jesus Christ; praying for you, that you may abound in
heavenly graces and temporal comforts. I have always had a love to the intended
purity, and unspotted doctrine of New England; for Mr. Cotton was of the same
college and university, of Emanuel in Cambridge, as I was, and so was Mr.
Hooker and others with whom we were all contemporary; and I never knew them,
but of a holy life and conversation. I also knew Colonel Humfrey, sir Richard
Saltonstall and Mr. Peter's, who were of note among you, and sir Henry Vane, who
all had some share in the foundation of your government. But certainly the
first intentions were never to debar the truths of scripture, and liberty of
conscience guided thereby; but to suppress sin and idolatry, and prevent all
the adulteries of Rome, to whom all things are lawful, especially lies in
hipocrisy, to promote their most damnable doctrines, coveteous superstitions,
and blasphemous supremacy. It is great wisdom to suppress sin, but not oppress
the liberty of a good conscience; and whilst men grant liberty of conscience
not to admit liberty of sin. All magistrates have not attained to this wisdom,
else England had been long since freed from popery and perjury. Whatsoever is
against the ten commandments is sin. Romans 3, 20. 1. John 3, 4. and he that
sins in one point is guilty of all, because he that spoke one word of them
spoke all, and he added no more. Jam. 2, 10, 11. Exo. 20, 1. While Moses and
Solomon caution men, so much against adding to, or taking from Deuteronomy. 4, 2.
Prove. 30, 5, 6, and so does the beloved apostle, Rev. 22, 18, 19, what shall we
say of those that take away of those ten words, or those that make them void,
and teach men so? Nay, they dare give the lie to JEHOVAH, and make Jesus Christ
not only a breaker of the law, but the very author of sin in others, also
causing them to break them. Has not the little horn played his part lustily in
this, and worn out the saints of the Most High, so that they become little horn
men also! If you are pleased to enquire about these things, and to require any
instances or informations, be pleased by your letters to command it from your
humble servant in the Lord Jesus Christ.

PETER CHAMBERLAIN."

Most worthy Governor, Sep. 1, 1677.

COPIES hereof were sent to those whom it was directed to; and the church sent
a letter therewith to Connecticut, from whence this answer was returned.

Hartford, 8, 8, 58.

"FRIENDS of Newport on Rhode Island, William Hiscox, etc. yours of 9, 4, 78,
was received the 7th instant, with one enclosed from another Peter Chamberlain,
senior. The advice in both is readily complied withal and thankfully accepted.
To be minded of any parts of the scriptures of truth is greatfully received,
and were it not for a seducing devil, and a deceitful heart, they would be a
rule of life unto all that have senses exercised therein, and make due
application thereof. What yourselves, or that worthy gentleman intend, or who
or what he refers to, is not so easy to guess at. We have of late had to deal
with Rogers and his of New London, toward whom the authority have shown all
condescension imaginable to us; that if they would forbear to offend our
consciences, we should indulge them in their persuasion, and give them no
offense in the seventh day, in worshipping God by themselves. We may doubt (if
they were governors in our stead) they would tell us, that their consciences
would not suffer them to give us so much liberty; but that they must bear
witness to the truth, and beat down idolatry, as the old good kings did in
scripture; they judging so of our Lord's day worshipping. It may be that your
counsel may be more taking with them, to make them forbear, than ours: which is
all at present, with respects,

From your friend and servant in Christ. WILLIAM LE^TE"

THE church repeatedly sent and labored with them but to little effect. Mr.
Gibson went and lived and preached a while among them at New London; but Mr.
Hubbard wrote to their aged brother Thorton (who had removed from Newport to
Providence) on Nov. 8, 1679, informing him of his late visit to that people,
when he found that old Mr. Rogers, had the wheel of a loaded cart went over his
leg a little below his knee, bruising it much, and had been so six weeks, but
now could move it: their judgment is not to use any means." And said he, "pray
remember my respects to Mr. Roger Williams; I should be glad to hear of him and
his wife;" a great respect to whom was shown in all their letters as long as he
lived. But on June 7, 1685, Mr. Hubbard wrote to Mr. Henry Reeve of Jamaica,
and informed him that messengers were then gone from their church to
New London, "to declare against two or more of them that were of us, who are
declined to Quakerism, I might say more; of whom be thou aware, for by their
principles, they will travel by land and sea to make disciples, yea, sorry ones
too. Their names are John and James Rogers, and one Donham."

FROM this beginning proceeded a sect which has continued to this day, who from
their chief leader have been called ROGERENES. In their dialect, and many other
things, they have been like the first Quakers in this country? though they have
retained the external use of baptism and the supper, and have been singular in
refusing the use of means and medicines for their bodies. Their greatest zeal
has been discovered going from meeting to meeting, and from town to town, as
far as Norwich and Lebanon, (the one 14, the other 24 miles) to testify against
hireling teachers, and against keeping the first day of the week as a sabbath,
which they call the idol-sabbath. And when the authority have taken them up and
fined them therefore, and have sometimes whipped them for refusing to pay it they
have soon published accounts of all such persecutions, which has been the very
means of keeping their sect alive. When the smallpox was very terrible in
Boston, in 1721, and great fear of it was discovered in the country, John
Rogers their founder, was confident he could go in where it was and not catch
it; and to prove his faith, went 100 miles to Boston, but catched the
distemper, came home and died with it, and scattered it in his family: yet his
successors still kept on in their way. So late down as 1763, some of them
repeatedly came and clapped shingles and pieces of boards together around the
meeting house in Norwich town, as well as delivered messages to the
worshippers, against their keeping of the Lord's day. But as the rulers had
learned so much wisdom as only to remove them away from disturbing others
without inflicting either fine, or corporal punishment upon them, they have
ceased from such things since in a great measure, and as they never were a
large society, there is hope of a true reformation among them. Besides these,
there have been some sabbatarian baptists in that place from the beginning to
the present time, though not a distinct church.

WE must now return to our baptist fathers at Boston. The liberty they had
enjoyed, with a blessing upon the ministry of Mr. Miles and others, had caused
such an increase of members, that in February 1677, they agreed to divide into
two churches; but in January 1678, they revoked that act, and concluded to
build them a meeting house, in Boston, and to defer the affair of dividing,
till they could obtain the settlement of an able sufficient ministry there.
They first nominated Mr. Russell for that end, and then talked of his going to
Swanzey in Mr. Miles's room; but in conclusion Mr. Miles returned to his old
flock, and Mr. Russell was ordained their pastor in Boston, July 28, 1679, and
removed there. Before which time governor Leveret was deceased, and Mr.
Bradstreet chosen in his stead; in consequence of which this church wrote to
their brethren at Newport the 25th of January this year, that several of their
brethren and sisters had been called to court, censured, fined twenty shillings
a piece, and to pay court charges, and others only admonished and to pay court
charges, which had not then been paid, and the constables were backward to make
distress upon them if they could shift it off. Feb. 9, the church met, and
purchased their meeting house with the land it was built upon, of Philip
Squire, and Ellis Callender, for 60 l.; and they met in it for worship the
15th. They had built with so much caution as not openly to call it by that name
till it was done. They had been often censured and reproached for meeting in
private houses, but now say, "since we have for our convenience obtained a
public house on purpose for that use, we are become more offensive than
before." Russell, p. 10.
The leaders of the society were convented before the general court of May 10,
who not finding any old law to suit their turn then made a new one, in these
words.

"IT is ordered by the court and the authority thereof, that no person
whatever, without the consent of the freemen of the town where they live, first
orderly had, and obtained, at a public meeting assembled for that end, and
license of the county court, or in defeat of such consent, a license by the
special order of the general court, shall erect or make use of any house as
abovesaid; and in case any person or persons shall be convicted or
transgressing this law, every such house or houses wherein such persons shall
so meet more than three times, with the land whereon such house or houses
stand, and all private ways leading thereto, shall be forfeited to the use of
the county, and disposed of by the county treasurer, by sale or demolishing, as
the court that gives judgment in the case shall order." Mass. Record.


HOW different is this from the above language of governor Leete? But instead
of seeking for porsecution as Rogers did, this peaceable people refrained from
meeting in their own house for the present, waiting to see what God would do
for them. And he who has the hearts of kings in his hand, moved their king to
write to the Massachusetts rulers on July 24, requiring that liberty of
conscience should be allowed to all protestants, so as they might not be
discountenanced from sharing in the government, much less that no such good
subjects of his, for not agreeing in the congregational way, should by law, "be
subjected to fines or forfeitures, or other incapacities for the same; which is
a severity to be the more wondered at, whereas liberty of conscience was made a
principle motive for your first transportation into those parts." Mass. hist.
vol. 3, p. 520.
Deplorable indeed was their case at this time. Their all was in great danger,
for doing so much of that which they thought Heaven frowned upon them for not
doing more of; and it was evidently the two errors I have mentioned at the foot
of p. 48, which brought them into this dilemma. Mr. William Hubbard, whom I
have so often quoted, who was a minister at Ipswich, preached at their election
in Boston May 3, 1676; and as the permission of quaker meetings had been
declard by many ministers, to be one great cause of God's judgments then upon
them, which had stirred up the court to severity against that people, he
plainly gave his mind to the contrary; and that pride and woridlymindedness
were the greatest evils then among them: yet least governor Leveret and his
court should be too favorable to the baptists, he in his dedication of that
sermon to them, p. 6, said, "If he were not much mistaken who said it is
morally impossible to rivit the christian religion into the body of a nation
without infant baptism, by proportion it will as necessarily follow, that the
neglect or difuse thereof, will as directly tend to root it out." And Dr.
Increase Mather, who yielded to Mr. Mitchel's reasonings about the
Massachusetts ministers after his death, he in that capacity now moved the
assembly to convene, what they called The reforming synod. First they kept a
general fast in their churches, and then the synod met at Boston, Sept. 20,
1679, to answer these two questions. 1st. What are the evils that have provoked
the Lord to bring his judgments on New England? 2d. What is to be done, that
so these evils may be reformed?

THEY had not gone far in their answer before they said, "men have set up their
thresholds by God's thresholds, and their post "by his post. Quakers are false
worshippers; and such anabaptists as have risen up among us, in opposition to
the churches of the Lord Jesus, receiving into their society, those that have
been for scandal delivered unto satan; yea, and improving those as
administrators of holy things, who have been (as does appear) justly under
censure, do no better than set up altar against the Lord's altar. Wherefore it
must needs be provoking to God, if these things be not duly and fully testified
against, by every one in their several capacities." Their result was approved
of by the general court on Oct. 15, who commended it to all their churches,
"enjoining and requiring all persons in their respective capacities to a
careful and diligent reformation of all those provoking evils mentioned
therein, according to the true intent thereof, that so the anger and
displeasure of God many ways manifested, might be averted; and his favor and
blessing obtained." Magnalia, b, 5. p. 87.89. I. Mather's life p. 84. Mr.
Stoddard informs us, that in this Synod they had a dispute about persons
giving, a relation of the work of God's spirit upon their hearts, in order to
coming to communion. -- The result was, that they blotted out that clause --
and put in the room of it, the making a profession of their faith and
repentance; and so I voted with the rest, and am of the same judgment still."
That they come to communion. Stoddard's appeal, p. 94. Was this reformation? or
was it not apostasy?


THIS dreadful charge, coming out from the whole power of the colony against
one small society, put them upon a critical review of their past conduct; and
they found that among about eighty members that they had received, there were
but two who had been censured in those other churches (since Mr. Gould and Mr.
Osborne, of whom we have before spoken) one of whom was Mr. Thomas Foster of
Biderica who for turning and going away, when infants were sprinkled, and for
going at last and joining with the baptist, and refusing, after they had
presented him to court, to return to the other church, was censure and
excommunicated by them. The other was Mr. Farnum, who was the only one that the
baptist had received, after others had cast him out; which was from the north
church in Boston, where Mr. Mayo and Dr. Mather was ministers. The baptists now
seat and obtained copies of the proceedings of that church against him, whereby
it appeared, that they were in the height of their dealings with him, the same
month that the assembly disfranchised Gould and Osborne for constituting that
baptist church, viz. in October 1665; and that Farnum got his temper up, and in
sundry instances spoke and acted very unadvisedly; for which the baptist now
required him to offer satisfaction to that church, before they would commune
with him again. This he soon after did. Mr. Willard owns that he offered a
confession therefore both orally and in writing; but because he refused to
return into their communion they judged it not to be sincere. The baptists say
that some who had been baptized among them had afterward been refused communion
by the other churches, when they had desired it. To which Mr. Willard says,
"They know that our churches have received some that were scrupelous about
infant baptism, who were willing to carry inoffensively: that we have refused
such as were rebaptized among those excommunicate anabaptists, is true
hypothetically, viz. except they would acknowledge and repent of that act;
because we judge it scandalous." Russell, p. 10. Willard, p. 22.
Upon which I would only remark, that God says. He that doubts is damned if
he eat; but the Massachusetts were willing to admit persons to cat with
scruples, but excommunicated such as put their full persuasion about baptism
into practice, and judged those not to be sincere, who would not repent of that
act! A letter at this time to their governor deserves notice, which is as
follows.

Honored Sir,
"I HAVE often heard of your name by Col. Eyers, whose first wife's name was
Bradstreet; and the character I have of you, if you were her son relates you a
wise and understanding man. But your report gives you as though some Laderdales
counsel had possessed you, which set all Scotland in an uproar. God is wiser
than man; more just and righteous: his counsel must stand. Bewere of smiting
your brethren, lest the ecclesiastical power of England invade you. A
parliament is near at hand, when just grievances will be previously resented: I
hope there shall be none during your government. Sampson plucked a house on his
head, and fell in it. If I can serve you in any honorable way, command your
humble servant,

PETER CHAMBERLAIN, His Majesty's physician in ordinary to his Royal Person."
September 2, 1679.

MR. Samuel Hubbard sometime after sent a letter, with a copy of this to
governor Leete, to check their imprisoning the Rogers's at New London. Notice
being received by the baptists in Boston, of the king's letter in their favor,
they met again in their house; but had not so done above four times before the
court met, and issued a warrant to the constable of Boston, requiring him, "in
his Majesty's name, forthwith to summons Philip Squire, Thomas S^^^ner and Mr.
Drinker, to make their appearance before the court of assistants now sitting,
having liberty to bring with them three or four more of their friends, to give
an account of their breach of the law in erecting a meeting house, and that
they appear at three of the clock this instant, 5th March 1680." They appeared
accordingly, and the court required a positive answer to the question, whether
they would engage, either for the whole society, or for themselves in
particular, to desist from meeting in said house till the next general court?
They said they were not prepared to answer it, and desired time to consult
their brethren. This was then denied them, but upon renewing the request next
morning, they were allowed so much time as from Saturday till Monday. The
church met on Monday, and presented the following address, viz.

"To the honorable the governor and magistrates now assembled at Boston, at the
court of assistants the 8th of March 1680, the petition and declaration of the
society of people commonly known or distinguished by the name of baptists,
residing in and about Boston, humbly shows,

IN primum, that whereas the only wise God, having by his providence led us
into that order and way of the gospel of gathering into church fellowship, we
do hereby confess, that what we did was not out of opposition to, or contempt
of the churches of Christ in New England, but in a holy imitation merely for
the better enjoyment of the liberty of our consciences, the great motive to
their removal at first into this wilderness 2. That the building a convenient
place for our public church assembly, was ^ot thought of affronting authority,
there being no law in the country against any such practice at the erecting of
this house, and did therefore think as the apostle says, where there is no
law, there is no transgression. The dictates of nature, or common prudence
belonging to mankind, and the example or practice of the country throughout
lead to the seeking of this convenience. 3. There being a law made in May last
against meeting in the place built, we submitted to the same, until we fully
understood by letters from several in London, that it was his majesty's
pleasure and command (the common supersedus to all corporation laws in the
English nation, that have not the royal assent Their charter was originally
designed for a corporation in England, to be executed only by a deputation in
this country, as the king's observes in the letter refered to Mass. hist. vol.
3 p. 5^9.
) that we should enjoy liberty of our meetings in the manner as other of his
protestant subjects; and the general court at their last meeting not having
voted a non-concurrence. 4. As therefore the two tribes and half did humbly and
meekly vindicate themselves, upon the erecting of their altar, when challanged
for it by Eleazer, and the messengers of the ten tribes, so do we hereby
confess in like manner, that we have not designed by this act any contempt of
authority, nor any departing from the living God, or churches of his worship,
the Lord God of gods he knows it, Joshua xxii, 22. Though it be our lot, with
the apostles, in the way that some call heresy so to worship the God of our
fathers. Your petitioners therefore, having no design against the peace of this
place, but being still as ready as ever to hazard our lives for the defense of
the people of God here, do humbly request that this our profession and
declaration may find acceptance with this honorable court, as that of the two
tribes did with Eleazer; and that we may still, through your allowance and
protection, enjoy the liberty of God's worship, in such places as God has
afforded us, which will greatly oblige your petitioners, as in duty bound,
humbly to pray.

Signed by us in the name and with the consent of the church.

BUT instead of having any ears to hear this loyal and christian address, their
marshal was sent, and finding their gate locked, forced his way through Mr.
Squire's ground, and nailed up their meeting house doors, putting a paper
thereon which said, "All persons are to take notice, that by order of the court
the doors of this house are shut up, and that they are inhibited to hold any
meeting therein, or to open the doors thereof, without license from authority,
till the general court take further order, as they will answer the contrary at
their peril.

Dated in Boston, 8th March, 1680, By order of the council, EDWARD RAWSON,
sec'ry,"

THE Baptists required a copy of the Marshal's warrant, but he refused it; they
then went to the secretary for one, who plainly told them, "he was not to let
them have any." They met the next Lord's Day in their yard, and in the week
ensuing prepared a shed therein for the purpose; but when they came together
the second Lord's Day, they found the doors open; and considering say they,
"that the court had not done it legally, and that we were denied a copy of the
constables order and Marshal's warrant, we concluded to go into our house, it
being our own, having a civil right to it." And they met therein till the
assembly sat, before whom they were convented on May 11. When they gave in
these pleas, "1. The house was our own, 2. It was built before the law was
made, therefore no transgression. 3. The express will and pleasure of the king,
that we should enjoy our liberty. After some debate of the matter (in which we
met with some hard and reviling speeches from some of them) we were dismissed
for that time. Next morning we put up a humble petition, (being blamed by some
in the court that we had not done it before) that there might be a suspension
of any proceedings against us." These accounts I have taken from their church
records and papers. On the colony records under May 19, I find it thus written,
viz.

"AFTER the court had heard their answer and plea^ perused, their petition and
what else was produced, the parties were called in, the courts sentence in the
name of the court was published to them; that the court in answer to their
petition judged it meet and ordered, that the petitioners be admonished by the
present honored governor for their offense, and so granted them their petition,
so far as to forgive them their offense past, but still prohibited them as a
society of themselves, or joined with others, to meet in that public place they
have built, or any public house except such as are allowed by lawful authority:
and accordingly the governor in open court gave them their admonition."

DR. Mather had published a piece the proceeding March, entitled The divine
right of infant baptism, containing some injurious reflections upon this
people; which, with others, were briefly answered in Mr. Russell's narrative,
dated from Boston, the 20th of this month, with the consent of the whole
church, and sent to London, where Mess'rs William Kissens Daniel Dyke, William
Collins, Hanserd Knollys, John Harris and Nehemiah Cox, noted baptist minister,
wrote a preface to it, in which they say, "As for our brethren of the
congregational way in Old-England, both their principles and practice do
equally plead for our liberties as for their own; and it seems strange that
such of the same way in New England, yea, even such (a generation not yet
extinct, or the very next successors of them) who with liberal estates chose
rather to depart from their native soil into a wilderness, than be under the
imposition and lash of those, who upon religious pretenses took delight to
smite their fellow servants, should exercise toward others the like severity
that themselves with so great hazard and hardship sought to avoid; especially
considering that it is against their brethren, who avowedly profess and appeal
to the same rule with themselves for their guidance in, and decision of all
matters relating to the worship of God, and the ordering of their whole
conversation -- For one protestant congregation to persecute another, where
there is no pretense to infallibility in the decision of all controversies,
seems much more unreasonable than the cruelties of the church of Rome toward
them that depart from their superstitions; and if prejudices were removed and
oppertunities of power not abused, but the golden rule of our Savior were duly
attended unto and rightly applied in the present case, certainly more
moderation, yea, even compassion would be exercised toward these our christian
friends by such as now give them trouble." They close with observing That Dr.
Stillingstreet had already declared, in his Mischief of separation, that their
rigorous course against congregationalists in England, was justified by the
process of the rulers here, against dissenters from themselves; and pray that
the governors of New England would regard their brethren there, so much as to
remit these proceedings. What was said in answer thereto, we shall see
presently, after I have observed, that elder Russell was taken from his beloved
^lock by death, Dec. 21, 1680: Upon which the church met the next day, and
agreed that their brother Callender, should be helpful in earrying on their
worship in Boston, on Lord's-days in the forenoon, and brother Drinker in the
afternoon, in the absence of elder Hull. It is evident, that the gifts and
graces of elder Russell were not small; and his memory is precious. His
granddaughter Brooks, married into Swanzey, whose sons, Job, Elder Job Mason
died, since this history was in the pres, aged 80.
Russell, and John Mason have been, and the two latter still are useful gospel
preachers in the second Baptist church in that town: Also Mess'rs Joseph,
William and Jonathan Russell, now noted traders in Providence, are of his
posterity.

IN 1681, a minister of the church in Boston, which was formed in a
schismatical way, in 1669, published an answer to the Baptist's narrative; and
though it is author was deceased, yet he entitled it, " Ne suitor ultra crepidam:
Cobbler keep to your last.
or brief animadversions upon the New England anabaptists late fallacious
narrative; wherein the notorious mistakes and falsehoods by them published, are
detected; by Samuel Willard, etc." To which he adds as a motto, Romans 16, 17,
18. Dr. Increase Mather, wrote a preface to this work, wherein he says, "Many
are of the mind, that it is not worth the while, to take notice of what is
emitted, by men so obscure and inconsiderable. -- It seems to me, that the
reverend author of the following animadversions, has showed much humility, in
condescending to take persons in hand, between whom and himself there is such
an impar congressus. -- As for the brethren, that have thought good to prefix
an epistle to such a narrative, and therein declare, that molestation is given
and severity is exercised toward antipedobaptists in New England, merely for a
supposed error about the subject of baptism, controverted amongst learned and
holy men, they are marvelously deceived in that their supposition. Protestants
ought not to persecute any, yet, that protestants may punish protestants; and
as the case may be circumstanced, a congregation of such as call themselves
protestants, cannot rationally be denied. Those of the congregational way,
fully concur with the old puritan non-conformists, such as Cartwright, Rainold,
Whitaker, Bains, Parker, etc. in whose writings congregational principles,
about church government, are to be seen. These are the men refered to in our p.
12, 13, who opened a door for Mr. Robinson and his brethren, by which
themselves entered not. Their first admonition to the parliament, was presented
thereto by Mr. John Field and Mr. Wilcox; for which they were committed to
Newgate prison; on Oct. 2, 1672. This caused Mr. Thomas Cartwright, to right
the second admonition to parliament, quoted by Mr. Robinson, and also to answer
what Dr. Whitgift had written against the first. And Mr. Neal says, the reason
why they could not settle the controversy, was because Cartwright was for
making his bible the only standard of doctrine, discipline and government; but
Whitgift held the latter of these to be changeable, to accommodate the civil
governments we live under. History of the Puritans, vol. 1, p. 190 -- 197.
Now the old non-conformists (notwithstanding their sufferings from those that
took delight to smite their fellow servants) did believe that disorders in
whole congregations were liable to the civil magistrates censure. -- Our famous
Cotton was another Moses, in respect of meekness and christian forbearance, as
to dissenters from his judgment in matters of a lesser concernment, yet would
he sometimes make a zealous protestation, that if magistrates in New England
should tolerate transgressors against the rules of godliness (as well as
offenses contrary to what the rules of honesty require) he believed that God
would not long tolerate them. -- I would entreat the brethren that have
subscribed the epistles seriously to consider; 1. That the place may sometimes
make a great alteration as to indulgence to be expected. It is evident, that
that toleration is in one place, not only lawful; but a necessary duty, which
in another place would be destructive; and the expectation of it irrational.
That which is needful to ballast a great ship, will sink a small boat. -- 2.
Let them consider, that those of their persuasion in this place have acted with
so much irregularity and prophanness, that should men of any persuasion
whatsoever have done the like, the saine severity would have been used toward
them." This hard sentence his son has propogated to posterity. Magnalia, B. 7.
p. 28.


BUT, search through all they have said against those people, and I am
confident that the greatest real disorder they have produced, was the churches
receiving Farnum as they did; which when they had proper knowledge of, they
rectified. But is this comparable to the disorders at Hingham, 20 years before:
Where Lieut. Eames was regularly chosen their captain, and presented to the
court for a commission; but soon upon it, a notion was started to choose
another man, related to the minister, into that office, who accordingly was
chosen and presented. And when the reason of it was asked for, they said Eames
had resigned; but he said he had not. Hereupon the minister censured him for
lying; and this cost three or four days tedious labors of a council, without
being able to settle it; and occasioned the petition of Dr. Child and others,
with much trouble to governor Winthrop and the assembly. Seep. 139, 140. Yet
the issue of all was, that the minister of Hingham excommunicated captain
Eames, contrary to the minds of other ministers, and by their advice, "Those
that were without just cause cast out at Hingham, were received into the church
of Weymouth, the next town, and the matter so continued through the stifness of
their minds, and their selfwilled resolutions." Winthrop -- Hubbard -- Neal,
vol. 1, p. 233. And how just also was it for both ministers and courts to
accuse that baptist, church, of having excommunicated officers in the plural
when they never had but one?


IN the piece upon infant baptism, which Dr. Mather had published, he accused
those baptists of the sin of Jeroboam, who made priests of the lowest of the
people; in which says Mr. Russell, "we easily understand" what he means; our
evil in this respect, is our calling to office those who have not been bread up
in colleges, and taught in other languages, but have been bread to other
callings. It is not because we are against learning, for we esteem it, and
honor it in its place; and if we had such among us and that they were together
with that, otherways duly qualified for the work of the ministry, we should
readily choose them. But we do not think the spirit of God is locked up so in
the narrow limits of college learning, that none are to be called to office in
a church but such, nor that all such are fit for that work, be they never so
great scholars; neither do we think that all those who have not that learning,
are to be accounted the lowest of the people. Indeed the priesthood was bounded
to the tribe of Levi by divine institution, but we cannot find that the Lord
has, by divine institution, given the work of the ministry to men of such
learning only. Whom he will he fits and quallifies for that work; neither are
we left without a plain rule in the new testament to direct us in this matter
Russell. p. 14.
In these plain gospel sentements have the baptists, on both sides of the
Atlantic, persevered to this day. But his apponent said of the text refered to,
"The Belgic and others read it, of both ends of the people. If a fit man would
except it so; if not, to the other end, and take one unfit. The anabaptists
would have a learned man if they could get one of their mind; if not, John
Russell the shoemaker -- Truly, if goodman Russell was a fit man for a
minister, we have but fooled ourselves in building colleges, and instructing
children in learing." Willard, p. 26.
Here is a plain specimen of what many call learning, though the truly learned
apostle Paul, renounced it with abhorrance. 2 Cor. 4, 2. Either those who have
a college education, are thereby made the head of the people, and the rest are
to be ranked to the other end, or else this is a handling the word of God
deceitfully; and God says. The prophet that teaches lies, he is the tail.

AGAIN, the baptists had said in their confession of faith, that those who
gladly receive the word and are baptized, are saints by calling, and fit matter
of a visible church. This Dr. Mather called a pernicious principle. But says
Mr. Russell, "who dare deny this to be a sound truth? as for the conclusion he
draws from thence, viz. that there are no visible believers but those that are
baptized, is his own, not ours; the improvement he makes of it, not what we
make of it. Far be it from us to judge all that are not baptized, not to be
visible saints, for we judge that the Lord has many precious people in the
world that are not baptized, according to, or in the manner we baptize; and
further we judge they should be visible saints, before baptized, or else they
have no right to baptism, for it is not baptism that can make saints. And as
for looking upon infant baptism as nothing, or a nullity, that is true; and we
can look on it no otherwise, till we see right to own it to be that which he
thinks of it, viz. of divine right, which we cannot see grown from the word to
do; and as for not owning their churches -- we never yet denied them to be
churches of Christ. It is enough for every one to prove his own work; but we
have owned them as such; for where there is true matter joined together in the
bond of a holy covenant they may be looked at as a true church, though not in
due order," Russel, p. 14.
This was not enough for the other party, but their cry still was, "they say
baptized persons are true matter of a visible church, and they say those that
were only sprinkled in their infancy, were never baptized; and will not this
undermine the foundation of all the churches in the world but theirs? and what
more pernicious! they had even as good cry with Edom's sons, raise it, raise it
to the foundation! -- Experience tells us that such a rough thing as a
New England anabaptist is not to be handled over-tenderly; the spirit which
they have at all times discovered under the greatest disadvantages (and God
grant that they may never have more advantage over us) easily tells us what
they would have been if circumstanced as those whom they accuse." Willard, p,
10, 27.


MR. Hubbard got the most out of temper upon this occasion that he ever did in
a whole volume in folio, and said, "one John Russell, a wedder-drop'd
shoemaker -- stiched up a small phamphet, wherein he endeavors to clear the
innocence of those, commonly (though falsely he says) called anabaptists. Surely
he was not well aware of the old adage, Ne suitor ultra crepidam, It was truly
of some age; for after James I. had preached in the star chamber, "That the
mystery of the King's power, is not lawful to be disputed; for that is to wade
into the weakness of princes, and to take away the Mystical reverence that
belongs to those who sit in the THRONE OF GOD. -- It is atheism and blasphemy
to dispute what God can do -- So is it presumption and high contempt in a
subject to dispute what a King can do or say:" He, the year after our fathers
first came to Plymouth, repremanded his parliament for petitioning against his
taking a Popish wise for his son Charles, and said, "A small mistaking of
matters of this nature, may produce more effects than can be imagined:
therefore, Ne suitor ultra crepidam." Rapin, vol. 2, p. 192, 211.
or else he would not have made such botching work." -- And goes on to recite
what you may see of the simple cobbler, in p, 183, 184, which he calls honest
stitches used to much better purpose. But having taken the old round to
Germany, he recovers his senses again, and then says, "To return to what was in
hand, and give this gospel ordered church (as John Russell terms them) what is
their due, from an historian; as for the persons of those seven [first males of
the church] he apologizes for, it may be more easily granted that they were
good in the main, than that it was a good work for God, they were engaged in --
Good men may be found to be ill employed; as Peter was* when Christ rebukes and
calls satan, and bids him get behind him. Whether any of them did absolutely
deserve to be delivered to satan, for their obstinacy in their opinions, or
other miscarriages, which either through weakness of their judgments, or
strength of their passions, which in defense of their opinions or practices
they run into; or whether there were not more acrimony of the salt, than
sweetness of the gospel spirit of peace, in those that managed the discipline
of the church against some of them, must not be here discussed -- Yet that can
give no color to a few giddy sectaries, that fondly conceit themselves to be
an orderly church, when their very constitution is explicitly, not only
without, but against the consent of all the rest of the churches in the places,
as well as the order of the civil authority."

I LOVE to see honesty if persons are erroneous; for then we have an advantage
to judge for ourselves, and to know the better how to deal with them. And I
must say that governor Winthrop, from whom Mr. Hubbard took many things,
exceeded him in that noble quality; and that Mr. H. exceeded all the historians
I have seen who have copied from him, except the pious Mr. Prince. Others have
often given us hard names without explaining what they meant by them; but Mr.
Hubbard plainly tells us soon after Mr. Cotton's arrival at Boston, that the
ministers, "used to meet once a fortnight at one of their houses in course,
where some question of momeant was debated: Mr. Skilton, pastor of Salem, and
Mr. Williams (as yet not ordained an officer there) out of a rigid
seperation-jealousy, took exception at; prognosticating that it might in time
bring forth a presbytery, or superintendancy, to the prejudice of the churches
liberties. (A spirit of rigid separation had it seems so early fly-blown their
understandings) -- the venum of which spirit had soon after infected so many of
that church and people at Salem, as will appear in the next chapter. But this
fear was without cause; nor did it spring from a godly jealousy, but from the
bitter root of pride, that venteth itself above order, and against love and
peace. No such spirit was ever observed to appear in Mr. Cotton's days, but a
spirit of love and meekness, nor since his time, to the present year." And
though the author of the Massachusetts history, approves of Mr. William's
opinion about liberty of conscience, and fixes upon his moving Mr. Endicot to
cut the cross out of the training colors, as the best plea he could make for
their banishing of him; yet Mr. Hubbard honestly says, "This essay did but tick
at some of the upper branches, whereas Mr. Williams laid his ax at the very
root of the magisterial power in matters of the first table, which he drove on
at such a ^ate, so as many agitations were occasioned thereby, that pulled down
ruin upon himself, friends and his poor family." Now if the reader will look
back to p. 156 -- 175, and compare that with their actings down to this time,
he will have a fair opportunity to know the meaning of the terms,
rigid-separation, turbulent anabaptists, giddy sectaries, etc. as they were
often used by that party.

MR. Williams closed his second plea for religious liberty, with an address to
the popish, prelatical presbyterian and independent clergy of the whole
kingdom, wherein he makes use of the "fable or similitude of a wolf and a poor
lamb coming down to drink at the same stream together: the wolf cruel and
strong drinks above and aloft; the lamb innocent and weak, drinks upon the
stream below: the wolf questions and quarrels the lamb for corrupting and
defiling the waters: the lamb (not daring to plead how easily the wolf drinking
higher might transfer defilement downward, but) pleads improbability and
impossibility, that the waters descending could convey defilement upwards: this
is the controversy, this the plea: but who shall judge? Be the lamb never so
innocent, his plea never so just, his adversary the wolf, will be his judge,
and being so cruel and so strong, soon tears the lamb in pieces. Thus the cruel
beast, armed with the power of the kings. Rev. 17, fits judge in his own
quarrels against the lamb, about the drinking at the waters. And thus (says
Mr. Cotton) the judgment ought to pass upon the heretic, not for matter of
conscience but for sinning against his conscience."

"OBJECTION, methinks I hear, the great charge against the independent party to
be great pleaders for liberty of conscience, etc. Answer, oh the horrible
deceit of the hearts of the sons of men! And, what excellent physic can we
prescribe to others, till, as Job said, our soul comes to be in their souls
cases? What need have we to be more vile, with Job, before God, to walk in a
holy sense of self-insufficiency, to cry for the blessed leadings of the holy
spirit of God, to guide and lead our heads and hearts uprightly!' He then goes
on to show, that each of these denominations had been sufferers in their turns,
and when so had always complained of it, and pleaded for liberty to their own
consciences; and then says, "New England laws, lately published in Mr. Clarke's
narrative, tell how free it shall be for people together themselves into
church estate, how free to choose their own ministers, how free to enjoy all
the ordinances of Christ: but yet, provided (so and so) upon the point, that
the civil state must judge of the spiritual, to wit, whether persons be fit for
church estate, whether the gathering be right, whether the people's choice be
right, doctrines right, and what is this in truth, but to swear that
blasphemous oath of supremacy again, to the king's and queen's and magistrates
of this and other nations, instead of the pope! Into these prisons and cages,
do those, otherwise excellent men, the independents, put the children of God,
and all the children of men, and then bid them fly and walk at liberty (to wit
within the conjured circle) so far as they please." Reply to Cotton, p. 315 --
318.


TOWARD the close of this year Mr. Miles came again and ministered a while to
his brethren in Boston. And Mr. Sprague, who in those times joined to the
baptist church in Providence, in writing to the Massachusetts many years afters
says, "Why do you strive to persuade the rising generation, that you never
persecuted nor hurt the baptists, which is so apparently false? -- Did you not
barbarously scourge Mr. Baker in Cambridge, the chief mate of a London ship?
where also you imprisoned Mr. Thomas Gould, John Russell and Benjamin Sweetser,
and many others, and fined them 50 l. a man. -- And did you not nail up the
baptist meeting house doors, and fine Mr. John Miles, Mr. James Brown and Mr.
Nicholas Tanner?" etc. I find also that a number of people from Kittery on
Piscataqua river, in the province of Maine, were baptized this year, and in the
beginning of the next sent their most gifted brother to Boston with a letter of
recommendation and request; in consequence of which the church there wrote thus
on Jan. 11, 1682. "To all whom it may concern; these are to certify, that our
beloved brother William Screven is a member in communion with us, and having
had trial of his gifts among us, and finding him to be a man whom God has
qualified and fiurnished with the gifts of his holy spirit and grace, enabling
him to open and apply the word of God, which through the blessing of the Lord
Jesus may be useful in his hand, for the begeting and building up of souls in
the knowledge of God, do therefore appoint, approve and encourage him, to
exercise his gift in the place where he lives, or elsewhere as the providence
of God may cast him; and so the Lord help him to eye his glory in all things,
and to walk humbly in the fear of his name.

Signed by us in behalf of the reft.

Isaac Hull, John Farnum."

BUT no sooner was this design heard of in their town, than Mr. Woodbridge the
minister, and Hucke the magistrate began to bestir themselves, and not only
spread the slanders we have heard so much of against the baptists at Boston,
but the magistrate repeatedly summoned those people before him who had been to
the baptist meetings, and threatened them with a fine of five shillings for
every such offense for the future. On Jan. 23, he convented Humphrey
Churchwood, a baptized member of Boston church, before him, where was the said
minister, who after casting those old stories upon him, said, "Behold your
great doctor, Mr. Miles of Swanzey, for he now leaves his profession and is
come away, and will not teach his people any more, because he is like to perish
for want, and his gathered church and people will not help him." Churchwood
told them it was a great untruth; and directly wrote to Boston upon it, which
letter is now before me. Several others from that place were baptized soon
after, but to hinder their proceedings, their general court took the matter in
hand as follows, viz.

"WILLIAM SCREVEN, appearing before this court, and being convicted of the
contempt of his majesty's authority, and refusing to submit himself to the
sentence of the court, prohibiting his public preaching, and upon examination
before the court, declaring his resolution still to persist therein, the court
tendered him liberty to return home to his family; in case he would forbear
such turbulent practices and amend for the future; but he refusing, the court
sentanced him to give bond for his good behavior, and to forbear such
contentious behavior for the future, and the delinquent to stand committed
until the judgment of this court be fulfilled.

VERA copia, transcribed, and with the records compared this 17th of August,
1682.

per EDWARD RISHWORTH, recorder."

To this is added a copy of the same date by the same hand, of an act of their
executive court which says, "This court having considered the offensive
speeches of William Screven, viz. his rash and inconsiderate words tending to
blasphemy do adjudge the delinquent, for his offense to pay ten pounds into the
treasury of the county or province. And further, the court does forbid and
discharge the said Screven, under any pretense, to keep any private exercise at
his own house or elsewhere, upon the Lord's-days, either in Kittery or any
other place within the limits of this province, and is for the future enjoined
to observe the public worship of God in our public assemblies upon the
Lord's-days, according to the laws here established in this province, upon such
penalties as the law requires upon such neglect of the promises." But he was so
far from yielding to such sentences, that on Sept. 13, he with the rest sent a
request to Boston that elder Hull and others might visit and form them into a
church, which was granted, so that a covenant was solemnly signed on Sept. 25,
1682, by William Screven, elder, Humphrey Churchwood, deacon, Robert Williams,
John Morgandy, Richard Cut, Timothy Davis, Leonard Drown, William Adams,
Humphrey Azell, and George Litten, and a number of sisters. A baptist church
was also formed this year from that of Boston, at Newbury, by William and John
Sayer, Benjamin Morse, Edward Woodman and others, to whom I find elder Hull and
elder Emblen writing as a sister church, on March 25, 1689; though how much
longer they continued a distinct church I do not find.

MR. Philip Edes, a member of the first baptist church in Newport, died this
year on March, 16, of whom Mr. Samuel Hubbard says in a letter to governor
Leete, "This friend of yours and mine, one in office in OLIVER's house, was for
liberty of conscience; a merchant, a precious man, of a holy life and
conversation, beloved of all sorts of men, his death much bewailed by all." Mr.
Thomas Oleny, senior, also died this year. He was next to Mr. Williams in the
pastoral office at Providence, and continued so to his death, over that part of
the church who were called five principal baptists, in distinction from those
who parted from their brethren about the year 1653, under the leading of elder
Wickenden, holding to the laying on of hands upon every church member. The
greatest fault that I find Mr. Olney charged with is, that he was for extending
the first deed of Providence up to the head of the two great rivers it lay
between, or at least as far as their charter reached, from the words without
limits, in p. 90. In this he was opposed by our elders, Wickenden and Dexter,
the latter of whom informs us that Mr Williams said, the only intent of the
expression was to prevent the Indians hurting their cattle if they wandered far
into the woods. Their writings on both sides are yet extant in their
town-clerks office. They tell me at Swanzey that elder Miles permitted Mr.
Brown's wife, who was not a baptist, to commune with their church, till by
elder Olney's influence ^he was dismissed to Mr. Angier's church in Rehoboth.
It is very evident that Mr. Olney was a capable and very useful man, both in
church and state for forty four years after he left the Massachusetts; as his
son also was for many years; and his posterity are respectable in that town and
state to this day. Mr. Holmes, of whom much has been said, who wrote the
account of himself in 16^5, that you have p. 208 -- 212, 256, etc. and
succeeded Mr. Clarke in the pastoral office at Newport, died there October 15,
1682, aged 76. He has a large posterity now remaining in New England and
New Jersey.

The learned and pious Mr. Miles having returned to his flock in Swanzey, fell
asleep in Jesus on Feb. 3, 1683; and his memory is still precious among us. We
are told that being once brought before the magistrates he requested a bible,
and upon obtaining it he turned to those words, ye should say, Why persecute we
him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me. Job 19, 28. which having
read he sat down; and the word had a good effect upon their minds, and moved
them to treat him with moderation if not kindness. His son went back to
England, and his grandson Mr. Samuel Miles was an episcopal minister at our
Boston in 1724. Though Mr. Willard, and the Magnalia from him, accused the
baptists of Boston, of separating because they wanted to be teachers, yet that
was so far from truth, that on June 27, 1681, they wrote to London for a
minister, giving this as one reason for it that, "our minister is very aged and
feeble, and often incapable of his ministerial work;" and as another motive
they say, "We conceive there is a prospect of good encouragment for an able man
to come over, in that there seems to be an apparent and general apostasy among
the churches who have professed themselves congregational in this land; whereby
many have their eyes opened, by seeing the declention and confusion that is
among them." A kind answer hereto was retured by eleven baptist minsters, which
is before me.

AND now as some singular and curious things are generally expected from a new
country, I shall relate the closing part of one of the greatest curiosities I
have met with in modern history; the sum whereof is this. A large number of
people fled out of the old world into this wilderness for religious liberty;
but had not been here long before some put in high claims for power, under the
name of orthodoxy; to whom others made fierce opposition professedly from the
light within; and their clashings were so great that several lives were lost in
the fray. This made a terrible noise on the other side of the water. But as
self-defence is a natural principal, each party wrote volume after volume to
clear themselves from blame; and they both conspired to cast a great part of it
upon one singular man, whom they called a weather cock, and a windmill. Now
let the curious find out if they can, First, how men of university-learning, or
of divine inspiration, came to write great volumes against a windmill and a
weathercock? Secondly, how such a strange creature came to be an over-match
for them all, and to carry his point against the arts of pr^est-cra^t, the
intrigues of court, the slights or enthuseasm and the power of factions, so as
after he had pulled down ruin upon himself and his friends, yet to be able, in
the midst of heathen savages, to erect the best form of civil government that
the world had soen in 1600 years? Thirdly, how he and his ruined friends came
to lie under those reproaches for a hundred years, and yet that their plan
should then be adopted by thirteen colonies, to whom these despised people
could afford SENATORS of principal note, as well as COMMANDERS by sea and land?
The excellency of this scene above those which many are bewitched with,
consists in its being founded upon facts and not fictions; being not the
creature of distempered brains, but of an unerring Providence

ACCORDING to Mr. Williams's own testimony, (p. 143) his soul was renewed by
divine grace when he was not more than ten or twelve years old. And the mystery
of his being rigidly set in his way, and yet given to change, is to be
explained thus. Neither frowns nor flatteries could move him to part with what
he judged to be truth, or to assent to any thing contrary thereto. As he
scrupled the exactness of the calendar then in use, so he discovered it in all
his dates. Even when dedicating his quaker dispute to the King, he dated it
March 10, 1672, 3, (ut vulgo.) On the other hand he was ever ready to change,
when he could obtain light for it from any quarter. While he ministered to his
brethren at Plymouth, he objected against their custom of giving their
neighbors the tittle of goodman, if they were not judged to be godly persons.
When governor Winthrop paid them a visit in 1632, (p, 56,) and his advice was
asked upon it, he showed them that they ought to distinguish betwixt
theological and moral goodness, and observed that when trials by jury was first
introduced in England, after the names of fit persons for the purpose were
called over, the crier called them to attend, good men and true, from whence
proceeded the custom then in question; and he thought it a pity to make a stir
about a custom so innocently introduced. Magnalia, b. 2, p. 14.
Mr. Williams readily embraced this advice, and made a very good use of it
afterward, in exposing the mischiefs that arose from a confounding of those two
sorts of goodness together, as Mr. Cotton and many others had done. And because
he was earnestly looking for a better church-establishment than he had then
seen, they imposed the name of seeker upon him. The great Mr. Baxter calls him
The father of the seekers in London. Crosby, vol. 1 p. 118.
When he went there in 1643, and published his testimony against the bloody
tenet, Mr. Cotton, among other reflections said, "Thus men that have time and
leisure at will, will set up images of clouts, and then shoot at them." Tenet
washed, p. 31.
In answer to which Mr. Williams appealed to the people of Plymouth, Salem and
Providence, that he had not lead such a life in this country; and as to the
other he says, "I can tell that when these discussions were prepared for the
public in London, his time was eaten up in attendance upon the service of the
parliament and city, for the supply of the poor of the city with wood, during
the stop of coal from Newcastle, and the mutinies of the poor for sir^ing --
these meditations were fitted for public view in change of rooms and corners,
yea, in a variety of strange houses, sometimes in the fields in the midst of
travel; -- for which service, through the hurry of the times, and the necessity
of his departure he lost his recompense to this day -- Well, notwithstanding
master Cotton's bitter censure, some persons of no contemptable note nor
intelligence, have by letters from England, informed the discusser, that by
these images of clouts it has pleased God to stop no small leaks of
persecution, that lately began to flow in upon dissenting consciences, and,
among others, to master Cotton's own, and to the peace and quietness of the
independants, which they have so long, and so wonderfully enjoyed." Reply to
Cotton, p. 38.
See p. 155, 174, 175, 187, etc.

AND as to his later services, he was so far from being meanly hired, as they
said, for a piece of bread, to write against the quakers, that after he had
done it, he wrote thus to Newport. "My dear friend Samuel Hubbard, to yourself
and aged companion my loving respects in the Lord Jesus, who ought to be our
hope of glory, begun in this life and enjoyed to all eternity. I have herein
returned your little, yet great, remembrance of the hand of the Lord to
yourself and your son late departed. I praise the Lord for your humble kissing
of his holy rod, and acknowledging his just and righteous, together with his
gracious and merciful dispensation to you. I rejoice also to read your heavenly
desires and endeavors, that your trials may be gain to your own souls, and the
souls of the youth of the place, and all of us. You are not unwilling I judge
that I deal plainly and friendly with you -- After all that I have seen and
read and compared about the seventh day (and I have earnestly and carefully
read and weighed all I could come at in God's holy presence.) I cannot be
removed from Calvin's mind, and indeed Paul's mind, Col. 2. that all those
sabbaths of seven days were figures, types and shadows, and forerunners of the
Son of God, and that the change is made from the remembrance of the first
creation, and that (figurative) rest on the seventh day, to the remembrance of
the second creation on the first, on which our Lord arose conqueror from the
dead Accordingly I have read many, but see no satisfying answer to those three
scriptures chiefly Acts 20, 1 Cor. 16. Rev. 1, in conscience to which I make
some poor conscience to God as to the rest day. -- As for thoughts for England,
I humbly hope the Lord has hewed me to write a large narrative of all those
four days agitation between the quakers and myself: if it please God I cannot
get it printed in New England, I have great thoughts and purposes for old. --
Mine age, lameness and many other weaknesses, and the dreadful hand of God at
sea, calls for deep consideration. What God may please to bring forth in the
spring his holy wisdom knows. If he please to bring to an absolute purpose I
will send you word, and my dear friend Obediah Holmes, who sent me a message to
the same purpose. At present I pray salute respectivly Mr. John Clarke and his
brothers, Mr. Tory, Mr. Edes, Edward Smith, William Hiscox, Stephen Mumford and
other friends, whose preservation, of the island, and this country, I humbly
beg of the father of mercies, in whom I am yours unworthy.

R. W."

IF the reader reviews Dr. Chamberlain's first letter, and is informed that he
with his brethren he wrote to, took the whole of the ten commendments to be
moral and immutable, and held that it was the little horn that changed the time
from the seventh to the first day: but that Mr. Olney and his church observed
to their brethren, that Paul speaks of a glory which was done away that was
written and engraven in stones, 2 Cor. 3, 7, compared with this letter, he will
then have a plain idea of the nature of that controversy on both sides, as it
was managed in that day. And to go on; it is to be remembered, that some
persons in different parts of that colony had such a conceit of liberty, as
that officers should manage the government without any reward from them; by
which means Mr. Clarke received but part of his pay for procuring their charter
as long as he lived; and occasioned a remonstrance from his executors to the
assembly upon it soon after his death. And a clause from Mr. Williams upon it,
I have already recited; to which I now add the following. In August 1678, he
was appointed to assist Mr. Daniel Abbot in setting their town records in
order, the latter being then chosen their clerk. Three years after Mr. Williams
wrote to him thus. "My good friend, loving remembrance to you. It has pleased
the Most High and only wise, to stir up your spirit to be one of the chiefest
stakes in our poor hedge. I therefore, not being well able to come to you,
present you with a few thoughts about the great stumbling block, to them that
are willing to stumble and trouble themselves our rates. James Matison had one
copy of me, and Thomas Arno^d another. This I send to yourself and the town
(for it may be I shall not be able to be at meeting). I am grieved that you do
so much service for so bad recompense; but I am persuaded you shall find cause
to say, the Most High God of recompense, who was Abraham's great reward, has
paid me.

Considerations presented, touching rates,

"1 Government and order in families, towns, etc. is the ordinance of the Most
High, Romans 13, for the peace and good of mankind 2. Six things are written in
the hearts of all mankind, yea, even in Pagans. 1st. That there is a Deity. 2d.
That some actions are naught. 3d. That the Deity will punish. 4th. That there
is another life. 5th. That marriage is honorable. 6th. That mankind cannot keep
together without some government. 3. There is no Englishman in his majesty's
dominions, or elsewhere, who is not forced to submit to government. 4. There is
not a man in the world, except robbers, pirates and rebels, but does submit to
government. 5. Even robbers, pirates and rebels themselves cannot hold together
but by some law among themselves, and government. 6. One of these two great
laws in the world must prevail, either that of judges and justices of peace in
courts of peace, or the law of arms, the sword and blood. 7. If it comes from
the courts of trials in peace, to the trial of the sword and blood, the
conquered is forced to seek law and government. 8. Till matters come to a
settled government no man is ordinarily sure of his house, goods, lands,
cattle, wife, children or life. 9. Hence is that ancient maxim, It is better to
live under a tyrant in peace, than under the sword, or where every man is a
tyrant. 10 His majesty sends governors to Barbados, Virginia, etc. but to us he
shows greater favor in our charter, to choose whom we please. 11. No charters
are obtained without great suit, favor or charges. Our first cost an hundred
pounds (though I never received it all) our second about a thousand,
Connecticut about six thousand, etc. 12 No government is maintained without
tribute, custom, rates, taxes, etc. 13. Our charter excells all in New England,
or in the world, as to the souls of men. 14. It pleases God, Romans 13, to
command tribute, custom and consequently rates, not only for fear, but for
conscience sake. 15. Our rates are the least by far of any colony in
New England 16. There is no man that has a vote in town or colony, but he has
a hand in making the rates by himself or his deputies. 17. In our colony the
general assembly, governor, magistrates, deputies, towns, townclerks, raters,
constables, etc. have done their duties, the failing lies upon particular
persons. 18. It is but folly to resist, (one or more, and if one why not more?)
God has stirred up the spirit of the governor, magistrates and officers,
driven to it by necessity, to be unanimously resolved to see the matter
finished; and it is the duty of every man to maintain, encourage and strengthen
the hand of authority. 19. Black clouds (some years) have hung over Old and
New England heads. God has been wonderfully patient and long-suffering to us:
but who sees not changes and calamities hanging over us? 20. All men fear that
this blazing herald from heaven denounces from the Most High, wars,
pestilence, famines: is it not then our wisdom to make and keep peace with God
and man?

Your old unworthy servant, ROGER WILLIAMS." These excellent observations are
still extant in his own hand writing. The last article refers to a remarkable
blazing star that appeared in those times.


Providence 15th Jan. 1680, 1 (so called)

The last act that I have found upon record, performed by this eminent
peacemaker, was on January 16, 1683, when he, with Mr. Carpenter, and the
heirs or assigns of the other eleven original proprietors, signed a full
settlement of the long-continued controversy about Pawtuxet lands. On the 10th
of May following Mr. John Thorton, wrote to Mr. Hubbard and said, "Dear
brother, you gave me an account of the death of diverse of our ancient friends;
since that time the Lord has arrested by death our ancient and approved friend
Mr. ROGER WILLIAMS, with diverse others here. The good Lord grant that we may be
stirred up, with the wise virgins, to be triming our lamps, and getting them
full of the spiritual oil, and standing with wise Habbakuk upon our watchtowers
till our appointed change." Thus lived and thus died the first baptist minister
in New England, and the first founder and supporter of any truly free civil
government upon earth, since the rise of antichrist; "and he was buried with
all the solemnity the colony was able to show." Callendar, p. 93. In 1686 Mr. S
Hubbard wrote that Mr. Thornton, and Mr. Joseph Clarke, were all that were then
living who were baptized in N. E. before him.
This was in the 84th year of his age, being 52 years after his arrival in this
country.

His wife, whose name was Mary, came with him from England; their children were
1 Mary, born at Plymouth the first week in August 1633. 2. Freeborn, at Salem
in October 16^5. 3. Providence, born at the place he so called in September
1638, said to be the first English male born there. 4. M^rcy, born July 15,
1640. 5. Daniel, born Feb. 13, 1642. 6. Joseph, born in Dec. 1643.
The last of these, and a grandson of the same name, were magistrates in the
colony and some of great knowledge, compute his present posterity at near 2000.
Thomas Ward, Esquire who was a baptist before he came out of Cromwell's ^^my, and
was a very useful man in this colony, was ancestor to two late governors, and
to the present secretary of it, in the male line, as Mr. Williams was in the
female; one of them was the honorable SAMUEL WARD, Esquire who died a member of the
Continental Congress at Philadelphia, on March 26, 1776, aged 52. The family o^
HOPKINS in Providence, which has afforded an honorable member of that assembly,
and two commanders for the continental flee^, descended in the male line from
Mr. Thomas Hopkins, who followed Mr Williams from Plymouth, and in the female
from Mr. Wickend^n, an early member, and long a teacher of the baptist church
there. The noted family of BROWN, in Providence, sprung from Mr. Chad Brown on
the one side, and from Mr. Williams on the other. And our generals, GREEN and
ARNOLD, sprang from two of the twelve first proprietors of those lands, which
were given for a place of refuge for such as were DISTRESSED FOR CONSCIENCE
SAKE ELSEWHERE; and may that great design never be forgotton by us or ours!
Some have been ready to make those religious contentions and oppressions an
argument against all revealed religion, but if they duly consider the following
things, compared with the forgoing, perhaps it may alter their minds. To guard
against evil biases in our dealings, the great AUTHOR of our religion said,
With what judgment ye judge^y shall be judged; and with what meas^r^ ye m^^e,
it shall be measured to you again. And was not his word verified in the
following instances?

1. The ruling party in the Massachusetts, had not only ra^ed up the real
faults of the baptists, and exposed them in their worst colors, but also
slande^ed them in many particulars. And now Edward R^ndolph went eight vo^ages
to England in nine years, and treated them in the same manner at the British
court, on purpose to get away their charter, M^ss hist vol 1. p, 3^9, 335, vol.
3, p. 480, 490. etc.
2 Ly^^ plea from the kings grant in ^^at charter, they had cruelly oppressed
their brethren and neighbors in many instances: now in 1684 the charter was
vacated by a decree in chauncery, without giving them opportunity to answer for
themselves; "and those who were in condfederacy with Sir Edmund And^os, for the
enriching themselves on the spoils of New England, did invade the property as
well as liberty of the subject; and gave out, that now their charter wa^ gone
all their lands were the king's; that themselves did represent the king, and
therefore men that would have any legal title to their lands must take patents
of them, on such terms as they should see mete to impose. What people that had
the spirits of Englishmen could endure this?" R^^^^^t^on (...) N. E. ju^t^^^^,
printed 1691, and re printed 3773, p. 1^.
3. Their charter never gave them any right to establish their mode of worship
by force; but in order to do it they presumed to leave the word lawful out of
their oaths. p. 61, 63; and Ipswich gave an early example of seizing their
neighbors property in that illegal way, against the weighty arguments of judge
Symonds. Now the scale was turned, so that an arbitary governor and council
made laws and imposed taxes upon all, without any house of representatives; and
for refusing to carry an order for such a tax into execution in Ipswich, Mr.
John Wise a minister who spoke upon it in their town-meeting was imprisoned,
and denied the benefit of the Habus Corpus act; and when he upon his trial
plead the Magna Charta, and laws of England, he was told by one of the judges,
that "he must not think the laws of England followed them to the ends of the
earth -- Mr. Wise, you have no more privilege left you, than not to be sold for
slaves" The honorable John Appleton, Esquire was treated in the same manner; and
both were put from office, sined 50 l. a piece, and ordered to give bonds of
1000 l. each, for their good behavior for one year. Four other men of that town
received like sentences, only in less sums. Ibid, p. 16.
Was not this a teaching by cudgel instead of argument! p. 100. To justify or
excuse their making the law against the baptists in 1644, Mr. Hubbard said, "It
were well if those who cannot comply with the religion of the state or place
where they live, yet had so much manners as not to justle against, nor openly
practice that that is inconsistant therewith, as if they would bid a kind of
defiance thereunto. Moses would not do that in Egypt, upon account of religious
worship, that might seem a matter of abomination to them who were lords of the
place." And Dr. Mather had lately said, "If a considerable number of
antipedobaptists should (as our fathers here did) obtain liberty from the
state, to transport themselves and families, into a waste American wilderness,
that so they might be a peculiar people by themselves; practicing all, and only
the institutions of Christ: if now pedobaptists should come after them, and
intrude themselves upon them -- surely they would desire such persons, either
to walk orderly with them, or to return to the place from whence they came. Let
them then do as they would be done by." Preface to N^ suitor, p. 5.
Now John Palmer, one of Andros's council, to vindicate their conduct said, "It
is a fundamental point, consented to by all christian nations, that the first
discoverer of a country inhabited by infidels, gives right and dominion of that
country to the prince in whose service the discoverers were sent." But the
Massachusetts say, "we affirm that this fundamental point, as he calls it, is
not a christian, but an unchristian principle" Revolution justified, p. 44.
Yes, and it was as much so when they banished Mr. Williams as it is now. 4. We
have seen how Dr. Mather treated the characters of the baptists; now a letter
is forged in his name, full of ridiculous and treasonable expressions, which
being pretendedly detected in its way to Holland, was laid before the British
ministry, and then was printed and spread through the nation to expose him.
When he came to know it he said, "That which troubled me was, that I was like
to suffer as an evil-doer, through the malice and falsehood of wicked men. Might
I have suffered for any truth which I had born witness to, I could have
rejoiced in it." His life p. 93, 94:
Yes; but his persecutors were as little inclined to give him that honor, as he
was the baptist. 5. Governor Bradstreet who helped to banish Mr. Williams, for
opposing an oath that was contrary to his conscience, lived to feel and see
what such impossitions meant upon themselves. For refusing to swear on the book,
many were not only put by from serving on jurys, but were fined and imprisoned,
and says the Historian, "the faithful of New England chose rather to suffer
affliction, than to use a rite in the worship of God, which they suspected
sinful." Magnalia, B. 7 p. 8, 10, 13.
And Dr. Increase Mather took pains to publish a discourse upon "The
unlawfulness of using common prayer; and of swearing on the book." 6. Andros
carried his episcopal worship into Mr. Williard's meeting house, after their
exercise was over, and threatened, "To shut up their doors if he was refused,
and to punish any man ^ho gave two pence toward the support of nonconformist
ministers; and that public worship in the congregational way, should not be
tolerated." This felt so to them, that when king James sent over his
proclamation, of indulgence and ^iberty, of conscience, "The ministers of
Boston proposed unto their congregations to keep a day of thangsgiving, to
bless God for what they enjoyed; [but the governor assured them] that if they
did, he would clap^ a guard on their persons and their churches too," and so
prevented it. Hereupon they thought proper to send Dr. Mather as their agent to
England. He had accused Randolph or his brother, of forging the aforesaid
letter to expose him; upon which Randolph prosecuted him for defamation: and
though he was acquitted upon trial, yet to prevent his going to England
Ruadolph designed by another writ to seize, and clap him up in prison; to avoid
which Dr. Mather escaped out of town in disguise, and was carried on board a
ship in the night, April 7, 1688; and upon his arrival at London, he with
others petitioned the king, "That there might be liberty of conscience in
matters of religion, -- and that all their meeting houses may be set free to
them, according to the intention of the builders thereof, but this application
met with no success: His life, p. 103, -- 111 Mass. hist. vol. 1. p. 368


Do not these things verify the truth of the christian reveration? They brought
Dr. Mather over to acknowledge, that the parable of the fares was a declaration
of our Savior's will for a toleration; and that, a good neighbor and a good
subject has a claim to all his temporal enjoyments before he is a christian;
and he thought it very odd, that the man should lose his claim, from his
embracing of christianity, because he does not happen to be a christian of the
uppermost party among the subdivisions. For an uppermost party of christians,
to punish men, it then temporal enjoyments, because in some religious opinions
they dissent from them, or with an exclusion from the temporal enjoyments,
which would justly belong unto them, is a robbery. His Life, p. 53. 59. See
Isai. 61, 8.
And how were the baptists treated after this?

THEIR church at Boston had received elder John Emblen from England, July 20,
1684. Mr Richard Dingley was received a member there the same year, and soon
after succeeded Mr. Holmes in the pastoral office at Newport, where he
continued about ten years, and then went to Carolina, Mr. Samuel Luther
succeeded Mr. Miles at Swanzey, where he was ordained by our elders, Hull and
Emblen, on July 22, 1685, and he was continued a great blessing to them 32
years. But elder Emblen dying about 1699, that church remained in destitute
circumstances for some years, and then chose Mr. Callender in his room; to whom
the following letter was directed, the original of which is now before me.

16d. 1m. 1714. Sir,
As in the distresses of the winter, we did with the solemnities of
humiliation, call upon our gracious God, so, since he has graciously recovered
so many of our people and sent in such seasonable provisions for our
necessities, it has been proposed among the ministers of the town, that our
good people may acknowledge these favors of our prayer-hearing Lord, with the
solemnity of a thanksgiving, in our several congregations; for which also we
have had the encouragement of the government. The time we would propose for
such a service is Thursday, the first of April, if the churches have no
objection against it. And it was desired that you might be seasonably apprised
of this proposal, because we are well assured of the welcome, which a motion of
such a nature will find with you, and the people of God unto whom you stand
nearly related. Having thus discharged the duty in this matter incumbant on me,
I take leave to subscribe,

Sir, your brother and servant, COTTON MATHER."


To my worthy friend, Mr. Ellis Callender, elder of a church of Christ in
Boston.

HIS son Elisha had joined to that church the 10th of August preceding, and he
gave him an education at Cambridge; and Dr. Increase Mather having signified
his willingness for such a thing, the church called him, his son, and Mr. John
Webb to assist in ordaining the said Mr. Elisha Callender then pastor on May
21, 1718; and in the preface to that ordination Sermon, the old gentlemen says,
"It was a grateful surprise to me, when several of the brethren of the
antipedobaptist persuasion came to me, desiring that I would give them the
right hand of fellowship in ordaining one whom they had chosen to be their
pastor. I did (as I believe it was my duty) readily consent to what they
proposed: considering the young man to be ordained is serious and pious, and of
a candid spirit, and has been educated in the college at Cambridge; and that
all of the brethren of that church with whom I have any acquaintance (I hope
the like concerning others of them) are in the judgment of rational charity
godly persons." Two of whom were old elder Callender and deacon Sweester, who
were principal members when their meeting house was formerly nailed up. Dr.
Cotton Mather preached the Sermon, which he entitled Good men united. And after
opening the nature and importance of such a union he says, "It is very sadly
true, that many ecclesiastical communities, wherein piety has its votaries, yet
are guilty of this evil, that they impose terms of communion which many that
have the fear of God, are by just exceptions kept from complying withal. Now in
this unhappy case what is to be done? do this, let good men go as far as they
can without sin in holding communion with one another. But where sinful terms
are imposed, there let them make their stops; there a separation becomes a
duty; there the injunction of heaven upon them is, Be ye separate says the
Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you. The imp^^^rs are
the schismatics. -- The unity which beautifies the true people of God, is
ca^^ed the unity of the spirit. Ephesians. 4, 3. The right basis for an union among
us, is the holy Spirit inclining us to glorify God, with an obedience to his
will revealed in his word; and to glorify our Savior with a dependence on him
for all the blessings goodness; and to love our neighbor as ourselves. There
have been many attempts to unite people in forms and terms, that are not the
pure maxims of living unto God; and so to build the tower of Zion, on a
foundation which is not the tr^ed stone and the precious, and so not the su^e
foundation. There has hitherto been a blast from heaven upon all those
attempts; they have miscarried, as being rather calculated for the tower of
Babel. -- We are sometimes fearful of paying the respects which we really owe
to a people of true piety (such a people as we this day meet withal) forsooth,
lest we confirm them in what we take to be an error, or mislead others into it;
I hope it is needless fear -- O you who cannot but own yourselves brethren to
one another, and bound up in one bundle of life; how is it possible for you to
require of one another submission to terms which you cannot but think, that men
may be good men, and have the evident tokens of salvation upon them, whithout
submitting to! And the terms which you have so pitched upon, how can you
proceed so far, as not only to withdraw your fellowship from the good men to
whom they do not appear so necessary, but also inflict uneasy circumstances
upon them, under the wretched notion of wholesome severities! Cursed the anger,
for it is fierce; and the wrath, for it is cruel! good for nothing but only to
make divisions in Jacob, and dispersions in Israel. Good men, alas! good men
have done ^uen ill things as these; yea, few churches of the reformation have
been wholly clear of these iniquities. New England also has in some former
times done something of this aspect, which would not now be so well approved
of; in which, in the brethren, in whose house we are ^^^y convened, met with
any thing too unbrotherly, they now with ^atisfaction hear us expressing our
dislike of every thing that has looked like persecution in the days that have
passed over us." Mather's sermon at Callender's ordination, p. 18, 25, 34 38,
39.


I THOUGHT it best thus to collect these passages into one view, which may
remind us of the apostles words, Happy is he that condemns not himself in
that thing which he allows. After the v^^a^^on of the Massachusetts charter,
Mr. Joseph D^dley was appoined president of the colony, till governor Andros
arrived in December 1686, who had all New England and New York included in his
commission. Randolph brought a quo warranto against Rhode Island charter, June
22 1680, upon which the freemen met, and gave their opinion to the general
assembly, and then lest the affair with them, who on June 29 concluded not to
stand suit with his Majesty, but sent a humble address to him, "to continue
their privileges according to charter." Andros's commission was published among
them the 12th of January following and he with a few mandamous counselors,
tyra^ised over all these colonies, till John Winslow brought a copy of King
William's proclamation to Boston, and Andros imprisoned him therefore; upon
which the people arose April 18, 1689, and seized him and his council, and
resumed their former order of government; which being heard of in Rhode Island
colony, their freemen met at Newport May 1, and voted to resume their charter,
and to have their former rulers take their places again. They met again Feb.
20, 1690, and elected new rulers in the place of some who declined serving, and
they with Connecticut have enjoyed their privileges to the present times.

I SHALL close this chapter with a list of New England rulers, and a few
remarks thereon. Plymouth never had any charter but only from the council for
New England that was established at Plymouth in Dovenshire. Their form of
government was settled by voluntary agreement among themselves. At first they
only chose a governor; the next year, one assistant with him; in 1624, they
chose five, and in 1633, seven assistants, and kept to that number to the end
of their colony. Mr. Bradford was always an assistant when he was not governor,
as long as he lived: his son was assistant and then deputy governor till the
revolution; and he and several of his posterity have been counselors in this
province; and one of his descendants is now deputy governor of the state of
Rhode Island. In 1639, they began to have a house of deputies in their general
court; and about 1662, they agreed that their eldest assistant should have the
power of a deputy governor, to act in the governor's place when he was absent.
This continued till 1680, when by reason of Mr. Alden's age, though they
continued him an assistant, they began to choose other deputy governors.

THEIR charter appointed 18 assistants, but they had scarce ever chosen above
half so many, till by the King's order they chose the full number in 1680.

RHODE ISLAND Rulers.

ROGER WILLIAMS, was truly the founder of that Colony, and a principal ruler
among them, as we have seen, from the beginning. Those who began upon the
island a different notion about government from him at first, and as their
covenant p. 96, was printed from an imperfect copy, I shall here insert it
exactly from their records as follows:

"We whose names are underwritten do here solemnly, in the presence of
JEHOVAH, incorporate Exodus 34.3, 4. 2 Chronicles. 11.3 2 Kings 11.17
ourselves into a body polity, and as he shall help, will submit our persons,
lives and estates, unto our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings, and Lord of
lords, and to all those perfect and most absolute laws of his, given us in his
holy word of truth, to be guided and judged thereby." And they then appointed
Mr. CODDINGTON as judge, and Mr. Aspinwall secret'y, to rule them according to
this covenant; till on Jan 2, 1639, an assembly of the freemen said, "By the
consent of the body it is agreed, that such who shall be chosen to the place of
Eldership, they are to assist the judge in the execution of justice and
judgment, for the regulating and ordering of all offenses and offenders, and
for the drawing up and determining of all such rules and laws as shall be
according to God, which may conduce to the good and welfare of the commonweal;
and to them is committed by the body the whole care and charge of all the
affairs thereof; and that the judge together with the elders, shall rule and
govern according to the general rules of the word of God, when they have no
particular rule from God's word, by the body prescribed as a direction unto
them in the case. And further it is agreed and consented unto, that the judge
and elders shall be accountable unto the body once every quarter of the year,
(when as the body shall be assembled) of all such cases, actions or rules which
have passed through their hands, by them to be scanned and weighed by the word
of Christ; and ^^^y the body or any of them, the Lord shall be p^^^ed to
dispense light to the contrary of what by the judge or elders has been
determined formerly, that then and there it shall be repealed as the act of the
body; and if it be otherwise, that then it shall stand (till further light
concerning it) for the present to be according to God, and the tender care if
indulging fathers.

William Dyre, clerk."

THEY then chose the elders named in p. 97, and went on as is there mentioned,
till March 16, 1641, when they distranc^^^^ed Carder, Holden, S^atton and
Potter, and suspended from voteing George Parks, John Briggs, and Mr. Lentha^,
who was gone for England; and then said, "It is ordered by the authority of
this present court, that none be accounted a delinquent for doctrine, provided
it be not directly repugnant to the government and laws established." And in
September following they said, "The law concerning liberty of conscience in
point of doctrine is perpetuated." After they received their charter, their
rulers were as follows:

BRIEF REMARKS.

1 THESE facts may teach us what to think of the exclamations that have often
been made against a free government, whose each freeman may have a voice in
choosing their chief rulers. Plymouth had this liberty in its full extent:
having full power to lay the plan of their government as they pleased, and to
elect whom they would into office. Each freeman in that colony had their equal
vote in the annual choice of their governor; and had not governor Bradford
requested them sometimes to elect others into that office, it is probable that
in the whole 73 years of their continuance as a distinct colony, they would
never have changed it into any more hands than death obliged them to; and in
fact they never did but five times in all those years; and (...) New Haven made
no such change whit^ they (...) a distinct government. And we have (...)
evidence that even a sergant in Plymouth (...) treated with more honorable
(...) captains have now been for these many years past. In Connecticut where
their governors have always been elected annually, by votes of the ^^cemen sent
in from every town in the colony, they have chosen but to men in 140 years, and
but ten in a hundred years, only two or three of whom were left out of office
till they died. And the Massachusetts chose but eight governors in 63 years.
But since this fickle popularity (as some call such government) was taken away,
and the power was vested in a crowned head, to fix, governors over us by a
steady commission, in which the people had no voice, the province in 82 years
has had a Phips, Stoughton, Bellamont, Dudley, Tailor, Shute, Dummer, Burnet,
Belcher, Shirley, Phips, Pownal, Bernard, Hutchinson, and Gage, for commanders
in chief, who have each in their turns been invested with power, to negative
our counselors when elected, and to negative any and every act that our
assembly could pass, and to dissolve them when they pleased. All these in a
space when Connecticut had but about half so many governors, and in 34 years of
the time Rhode Island had but two. And the evil effects afterward of a
depreciating currency, and of party influence in elections, all need to beware
of at this day. Hence, 2 Learn the importance of viewing persons and actions in
their distinct light, so as not to confound good and evil, truth and falsehood
together. God says, only by pride comes contention; but with the ^^^^-advised
is wisdom Pride caused a contention about who should be greatest, even among
the apostles, and made them think of calling for fire from heaven to consume
such as would not receive them. And Dr. Owen well says, "Gospel constitutions,
in the case of heresy or error, seem not to favor any course of violence, I
mean of civil penalties. Fortold it is, that heresies must be, 1 Cor. 11, 19,
but this for the manifesting of those who are approved, not the destroying of
those that are not. -- Perhaps those who call for the sword on earth, are as
unacquainted with their own spirits, as those that called for fire from heaven,
Luke 11. And perhaps the parable of the tares gives in a positive rule as to
this whole business." Collection of his tracts, 1721, p. 314.
These sentiments were inculcated upon our Plymouth fathers before they came to
this country, see p. 26 -- 32. And governor bradford was the owner of the book
which contained them that I am now favored with; and while he continued
governor Mr. Williams could be comfortable at Plymouth; but when Mr. Winslow
came into that office in 163^, he requested a submission to Salem. And the
second time Mr. Winslow was governor he wrote to Mr. Williams to remove out of
that jurisdiction, p. 72, and a law was made that year to forbid the gathering
of any church therein without the rulers leave. He and Mr. Colliar were the
commissioners for Plymouth who on Sept. 7, 1643, signed the articles of
confederation that the other three colonies had entered into the May before;
and who then concured in the delivery of Miantinomo to Uncas to be slain
(though without torture) and in advising the Massachusetts to send an armed
force to Warwick. He was again a commissioner in their meeting at Hartford
Sept. 1, 1644, when they wrote to each colony, to enter upon a method of rating
all persons by authority, that refused or neglected to give what the rulers
judged to be their meet proportion toward ministers maintenance; against which
Mr. John Brown, the other Plymouth commissioner, entered his dissent. In
October 1645, in a thin assembly at Plymouth, Mr. Winslow propounded, "and
after a whole days agitation" got something of this nature allowed and entered
upon their waste book: but when a full assembly met the next week Mr. Brown and
other magistrates, "excepted against the entry of that order, as pernicious and
destructive to the weal of the government, and tendered a proposition, to allow
and maintain full and free tollerance of religion, to all men that would
preserve the civil peace, and submit to government." But Mr. Winslow had
influence enough to prevent the putting of that matter to vote. When the
commissioners met at New Haven Sept. 9, 1646, they said, "upon information of
what petitions have been lately put up in some of the colonies against the good
and straight ways of Christ, both in the churches and in the commonwealth, the
commissioners, remembering that these colonies, for themselves and their
posterity, did unite into this form of perpetual league, as for other respects,
so for mutual advice, that the truth and liberties of the gospel might be
preserved and perpetuated, thought it their duty seriously to commend it to the
care and jurisdiction of each general court within these united colonies, that
as they have laid their foundations and measured the house of God, the worship
and worshippers, by the rod God has put into their hands, so they would walk
on and build up (all discouragements and difficulties notwithstanding) with an
undaunted heart and unwearied hand, according to the sure rules and patterns --
That anabaptism, familism, antinomianism, and generally all errors of like
nature, which oppose, undermine and slight either the scriptures, the sabbath
or other ordinances of God and bring in and cry up unwarrantable revelations,
inventions of men, or any carnal liberty, under a deceitful color of liberty
of conscience, may be seasonably and duly suppressed; though they wish as much
forbearance and respect may be had of tender consciences, seeking light, as may
stand with the purity of religion and peace of the churches." The commissioners
for Plymouth, Brown and Hatherly, did not concur with this. Mass. hist, vol. 3,
p. 153, 154 -- Records of the United Colonies.


MR. Winslow was then gone to England, from whence he never returned; and not
having his influence, all the ministers in Plymouth colony, and the
Massachusetts court to help them, could not prevail in 1650, with governor
Bradford, and his court, to inflict so much as a fine upon Mr. Holmes; who was
most cruelly whipped at Boston the next year, p. 213, etc. Said ministers were
not of the original planters of Plymouth colony, and because their court would
not be governed by them, the most of them left it, and carried their complaints
to Boston, from whence fresh exertions were made, which then in a measure
introduced a state-worship, and state-ways of maintenance into Plymouth colony.
Though the bloody work that followed at Boston, gave such a shock to it as
turned them back again in a great measure. Mr. John Brown had been a magistrate
17 years, and a commissioner for his colony 11 years, even down to 1656. And we
are told that he was, "well accomplished with abilities both civil and
religious, and attained, through grace, unto a comfortable persuasion of the
love and favor of God to him; he falling sick of a fever, with much serenity
and spiritual comfort fell asleep in the Lord, at Wannamoiset near Rehoboth, in
the spring of the year 1662." Marton, p. 175, 176.
His son James joined the next year informing a baptist church there, and both
in 1665, and 1666, the freemen through the colony elected him for one of their
magistrates, at the same time that the Massachusetts court disfranchised two of
their ancient freemen, for no worse crime than Mr. Brown then lived in. And
though he did not see cause then to accept of that office, yet being chosen
again in 1673, he accepted it, and served his colony therein eleven years; in
the midst of which time persecution was again revived at Boston, and Mr. Brown
and his minister were fined for visiting their afflicted brethren there. With
what face then can any man reproach New England in general, with the
persecutions which its first founders, and many of its best members afterward
abhorred! And of all men how inexcusable are episcopalians in so doing, when it
was the errors the Massachusetts brought out of their church that produced all
those mischiefs, of which they were then, and have been ever since, much more
guilty than those they complain of here! In England and Scotland they in that
day destroyed more hundreds of lives, in trying to establish their supremacy
over the consciences of men, than the Massachusetts hanged persons. And they
have not only always taxed dissenters to their ministers wherever they could
get power to do it, but also in Virginia they have sined and imprisoned our
ministers only for preaching without their license; and continued this cruel
trade till the present rapture put a stop to it. 3. Hence see the pernicious
evil of using carnal weapons in religious affairs. Papists, episcopalians,
presbyterians and congregationalists have all tried it in their turns; but
instead of giving up the root of this mischief, they have each of them tried to
cast all the reproach of it, upon the bad dispositions of their neighbors; and
so it has been a constant source of raillarly and slander. But where can a
better set of men be found upon earth, since Constantine first brought the
carnal weapon into the church, who concured in using of it there, than the
fathers of the Massachusetts? Look back to p. 138 -- 141, and then tell me
where you can find a more excellent ruler than governor Winthrop, that ever
traveled in that path? And Mr. Shepard of Cambridge, who died five months
after him, said, "Surely all the persons, whose hearts the Lord stirred up in
this business, were not rash, weak-spirited, inconsiderate of what they left
behind, or what it was to go into a wilderness. But if we were able to recount
the singular workings of divine providence, for the bringing on this work, to
what it is come unto, it would stop the mouths of all. Whatever many may say or
think, we believe after times will admire and adore the Lord herein, when all
his holy ends, and the ways he has used to bring them about shall appear. --
What shall we say of the singular providence of God, in bringing so many
ship-load of his people through so many dangers, with so much safety from year
to year It was computed that from 1628 to 1643 (when the times turned in
England, and some went back) that the number of ships which brought them over
were 298; the men, women and children who came in them 21,200 or thereabout.
That the passage of the persons cost 95,000 l. the live stock, 12,000 l. Beside
the price o^ them in England; procuring food till they could raise it here,
45,000, nails, glass and other material for building, 18,000 l, arms and
ammunition, 22,000, in all 192,000, beside much more which the adventures laid
out in England for their use. Johnson, p. 28 -- 31.
The fatherly care of our God, in feeding and clothing so many in a
wilderness, giving such healthiness and great increase of posterity? -- But
above all we must acknowledge the singular pity and mercies of our God, that
has done all this, and much more, for a people so unworthy, so sinful, that by
murmurings of many, unfaithfulness in promises, oppressions, and other evils
that are found among us, have so dishonored his majesty, exposed his work here,
to much scandal and obliquy, for which we have cause forever to be as^^med,
that the Lord should yet own us, and rather correct us in measure, than cast us
off in displeasure, and scatter us in this wilderness." Magnalia, B. 3 p. 83.
We are informed that when governor Winthrop lay on his death bed, Mr. Dudley
requested him to sign a warrant to banish Mr. Mathews a Welsh minister, but
that he refused, saying, "I have had my hand too much in such things already."
Bishop, p 157.


CAPTAIN Roger Clap, one of the first planters of Dorchester, the commander of
Castle-William for 20 years, and who bore several other offices in the state
with honor, and died in Boston in 1691, in such esteem that the whole general
assembly attend his funeral, wrote some memorials of those early times, with
his fatherly advice to his children. And observing that their straits were
sometimes so great that the very crusts of his father's table in England would
have been as a dainty in this wilderness he says, "I took notice of it, as a
great favor of God unto me, not only to preserve my life, but to give me
contentedness in all these straits: insomuch that I do not remember that I ever
wished in my heart that I had not come into this country, nor wished myself
back again. Yea, I was so far from that, that I wished and advised some of my
dear brethren to come hither also; which accordingly one of my brothers, and
those who married my two sisters, sold their means, and came hither. The Lord
Jesus Christ was so plainly held out in the preaching of the gospel unto poor
lost sinners, and the absolute necessity of the new birth, and God's holy
spirit in those days accompanied the word with such efficacy upon the hearts of
many, that our hearts were taken off from Old-England, and set upon HEAVEN.
Many were converted, and others established in believing. Many joined unto the
several churches where they lived, confessing their faith publicly, and
showing before all the assembly, their experiences of the workings of God's
spirit in their hearts, to bring them to Christ; which many hearers found very
much good by, to help them to try their own hearts, and to consider how it was
with them; -- Oh the many tears that have been shed in Dorchester meeting house
at such times, both by those that have declared God's work on their souls, and
also by those who heard them! in those days God, even our own God, did bless
New England." Prince's Christian history, vol. 1. p. 70 -- 72.


ANOTHER of their Captains who came over in 1630, says, "Those honored persons
who were now in place of government, having the propagation of the churches of
Christ in their eye, labored by all means to make room for inhabitants, knowing
well that where the carcass is, thither will the eagle resort. But herein they
were opposed by certain persons, whose greedy desire for land, much hindered the
work for a time; as indeed such persons do to this day; and let such take
notice how these were cured of this distemper. Some were taken away by death,
and then besure they had land enough. Others fearing poverty and famishment,
supposing the present scarcity would never be turned into plenty, removed
themselves away, and so never beheld the great good the Lord has done for his
people. But the valiant of the Lord waited with patience, and in the miss of
beer, supplied themselves with water; even the most honored as well as others,
contentedly rejoicing in a cup of cold water; blessing the Lord that had given
them to taste of that living water, and that they had not the water that slakes
the thirst of their natural bodies, given them by measure, but might drink to
the full; as also in the absence of bread, they pleased themselves with fish.
The women once a day, as the tide served, resorted to the muscles and
clam-banks, where they daily gathered their families food, with much heavenly
discouse of the provisions Christ formerly made for many thousands of his
followers in the wilderness. Quoth one, my husband has traveled as far as
Plymouth, [about 40 miles] and has with great toil brought a little corn home,
and before that is spent the Lord will assuredly provide: quoth the other, Our
last peck of meal is in the oven at home a baking, and many of our godly
neighbors have quite spent all, and we owe one loaf of that little we have.
Then spoke a third, My husband has ventered himself among the Indians for
corn, and can get none, as also our honored governor has distributed his so
far, that a day or two more will put an end to his store and all the rest; and
yet methink our children are cheerful, fat and lusty, with feeding upon these
muscles, clams and other fish, as they were in England, with their fill of
bread, which makes me cheerful in the Lord's providing for us; being further
confirmed by the exortation of our pastor to trust in the Lord, whose is the
earth, and the fullness thereof. As they were encouraging one another in
Christ's careful providing for them, they lift up their eyes and saw two ships
coming in, and presently this news comes to their cars, that they were come
from Ireland full of victuals." In one of those ships came Mr. Roger Williams.
Johnson, p. 48, 49 Prince's annuals. p. 18, 47. We are told that one of the
fathers of that day, having dired with his friends on clams without bread,
devotly returned thanks, that God had caused them to s^ck of the abundance of
the sea, and of treasures hid in the sand, Magnalia, B. 1. p. 22.


Oh! how gloriously do they shine, and how manfully do they talk, when
exercising themselves in the gospel armor, to what they do when they come down
to the use of earthly weapons in heavenly concernments! In 1645 they compared
the baptists opposition to such conduct, to what Amelek did to Israel when they
were weak. And the erecting of a small baptist church in 1665, was called a
strong attempt against them from the spirit of anabaptism; the permission of
which among them they said, manifestly tended to the destruction of their
churches, though they had above forty of them then in their colony, in joint
communion with about as many more in neighboring colonies. Christian hist.
vol. 1, p. 64.
And in 1681 they compared their ecclesiastical establishment to a small boat,
and those few illetirate baptists to the ballast of a great ship, which was
like to sink it. Hence it was their weakness, and not their strength, that
caused them to treat the baptists so cruelly. The extending of the gospel
ordinance of baptism to subjects who are in a state of nature; the limitting
the church of Christ to human schools for ministers, and compelling all to
support such and only such, are points which had but a weak bottom to stand
upon in that day, when the power of godliness was so well known in the country.

APPENDIX, CONTAINING A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS OF THIS
COUNTRY, DOWN TO THE PRESENT TIME.
FOUR principles have, in different ages and countries, been proposed to found
government upon, viz. nature, grace, power and compact. James the first took
much pains to persuade his people, that he was born to rule them; even so that
the privileges he was pleased to allow them, were rather favors from him, than
original rights in them. And his flattering courtiers, perceiving his humor,
gave him the title of sacred majesty, which the kingdom was very little
acquainted with before. His high claims occasioned perpetual troubles to
himself, and cost his son his crown and the head that wore it. And when facts
are examined it appears, that Henry VII, from whom came their hereditary title,
had as little right by birch to the crown of England, as any man that had worn
it in 500 years; and he made his way to it through blood and slaughter, Rapin,
vol. 2, p. 160, 161.
The Pope has been the most notable advocate for founding dominion in grace;
and by deceitful reasonings from the Jewish handwriting, he has usurped the
seat of (...) who is HEAD OF ALL PRINCIPALLITY AND POWER. Henry VIII took
offense at the pope's conduct, and rejecting his power assumed it to himself;
and many others, not holding THE HEAD, have subjected souls to slavish
ordinances, after the doctrines and commandments of men. Col 2. Cromwell was a
notable actor upon the third principle, who having gotten the power into his
hands, pleaded that he ought to use it for the good of the nation: and his
enemies acknowledge the excellency of his tallants for government, if he had
but obtained his power in a righteous way. But he dying left the nation in
great confusion; to get relief from which they restored the second Charles,
with good words and fair speeches, without settling any fixed and certain
conditions with him. Soon after which, prie^c^a^t was (...) ^o stir up tumults
in different parts of the (...) ^^^^y, and then to cry, The church is in
dange^! which moved the parliament to make laws to exc^ude all persons from
teaching either in churches or schools, who refused an assent and comment to
their ordinances of men, and also to decl^re it to be unlawful to take up arms
against the king, upon any pretense whatsoever. And, as Dr. Calamy observes,
passive obedience and non-resistance, was the doctrine that for 25 years made
their pulpits ring and presses groan. Yet no sooner was this doctrine turned
against the episcopalians than behold! they called in the prince of Orange,
with an armed force to drive their king from his throne! And now the fourth
principles is prefered, and a compact, containing a large BILL OF RIGHTS, is
made with William before his coronation; and he and his queen were brought,
"solemnly to promise and swear to govern the people of the kingdom of England,
and the dominions thereto belonging, according to the statutes in parliament
agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same; and to their power to cause
law and justice to be executed in mercy, in all their judgments." And enacted
that (...) oath should be taken by all their successors in that office.

NOW the word of God plainly shows, that this way of mutual compact of
covenant, is the only righteous foundation for civil government. For when ^^^el
must needs have a king like the rest of the nations and he indulged them in
that request, yet (...) Sa^l nor David, who were anointed by his immediate
direction, ever assumed the regal power over the people, but by their free
consent. And though the family of David had the clearest claim to hereditary
succession, that any family on earth ever had, yet when ten of the twelve
tribes revolted from his grandson, because he refused to comply with what they
esteemed a reasonable proposal, and he had collected an army to bring them back
by force, God warned him not to do it, and he obeyed him therein. Had these
p^a^ precedents been regarded in later times, what woes and miseries would they
have prevented! But the history of all ages and nations shows, that when men
have got the power into their hands, they often use it to gratify their own
lusts, and recur to nature, religion or the constitution (as they think will
best serve) to carry and yet cover their wretched designs; a lamentable proof
of which is now before us.

DR. Mather, as a capable and faithful friend to his country, labored
unweariedly to have the rights and privileges of it restored and enlarged; in
order to which he prevailed with archbishop Tillotson to tell the king that.
"it would by no means do well for him to take any of those privileges from the
people of New England, which king Charles the first had granted them." And
obtained a promise from bishop Burnet that, "On the first opportunity he would
declare openly in the house of lords, that there was a greater SACREDNESS in
the CHARTER of New England, than in those of the corporations in England;
because those were only acts of grace, whereas the charter of New England was a
CONTRACT between the king and the first patentees. They promised the king to
enlarge his dominions on their own charges, provided they and their posterity
might enjoy such and such privileges; they had performed their part, now for
the king to deprive their posterity of the privileges therein granted unto
them, would carry a face of injustice in it." This had some effect upon the
king's mind, and caused a scruple whether he might lawfully take from us the
privilege of choosing our chief rulers or not. To this some of his arbitary
counselors said, "Whatever might be the merit of the cause inasmuch as the
charter of the Massachusetts stood vacated by a judgment against it, it was in
his power to put them under what form of government he should think best for
them." Mathers life, p. 126, 127, 132.
This was so flattering and plausible that it took with William, who had often
heard of there persecutions here, and thought that by reserving to himself a
power to negative all their acts, he should prevent the like for the future.

Accordingly a new charter was drawn dated Oct. 7, 1691 which included Plymouth
colony, consisting of the counties of Plymouth, Barnstable and Bristol; the
Massachusett colony, which contained the counties of Suffolk, Middlesex, Essex,
Worcester, Hampshire and Berkshire: the province of Maine, viz. the counties of
York and Cumberland; and Sagadehock, which, with lands annexed in the county of
Lincoln, extends to Nova Scotia. The islands also south of Cape-Cod were
included in this charter of The Province of the Massachusett's-Bay in
New England, which reserved an arbitary power in the crown, to appoint our
governor, lieutenant governor and secretary; but that the people might choose a
house of representatives annually, to meet upon the last Wednesday in May; when
they were to elect 28 counselors, which was to be their legislature; the
council and house to have a negative on each others acts, and after both were
agreed therein, yet the governor, or in his absence the lieutenant governor,
might negative any act they could pass, and also negative the election of as
many councillors as he pleased. Upon all times except election day, he could
call, adjourn, prorogue or dissolve the assembly at pleasure. He had the sole
power of appointing military officers; and was to appoint all officers of the
courts of justice with the consent of the council; other civil officers were
elected by the two houses, where he had his negative; and no money could issue
out of the treasury but by his warrant by the advice and consent of the
council. And after all, the king in council could, at any time within three
years, disannul any act or law that all three branches here could make. Now
from whence came this arbitrary power in the crown of England over this
country? Their plea founded upon the vacation of the former contract, would
disannul any contract that could possibly be made with any distant people in
the world; for a complaint against us was entered and judgment was passed,
before we could possibly have opportunity to answer for ourselves. The charter
of the city of London was vaca^^^ by the same court, where they had opportunity
to answer; but they would not crown (...) and Mary, till that judgment was
^^versed and all the charters in England ^e^^o^ed, and their privileges
en^^^ged much beyond what they were when the contract was made with
New England. And in t^^ the king engaged for himself his heirs and successors,
that we should hold our ^ands, in free and common soc^age and not in capite,
nor by knights service, we yielding and paying to him his heirs and successors
the fifth part a^^y of all ore of gold and silver, which from time to time and
at all times hereafter shall be gotten, had or obtained, for all services,
exactions and demands whatsoever." Mass. hist. vol. 3. p. 8, 9.
And let our oppressors show if they can that we ever violated this contract.

AND as to affairs here the charter declared, "Liberty of conscience in the
worship of God to all christians, except papists, inhabiting or which shall
inhabit or be resident within our said province or territory." But this most
important article was cons^ured by the ministers as meaning, "That the general
court might, by law, encourage and protect that religion which is the general
profession of the inhabitants." Mass. hist. vol. 2. p. 1^.


AND accordingly they in October this year began the practice, which a noted
author described 34 years after, in the following man^^^. After reciting an old
saying, that ministers of the gospel would have a poor time of it, if they m^st
rely on a ^ee contribution of the people for their m^i^^enance, he says, "The
laws of the province having had the royal approbation ^o ratify them, they are
the kings laws, By these laws it is enacted that there shall be a public
worship of God in every plantation; that the person elected by the majority of
the inhabitants to be so, shall be looked upon as the minister of the place;
that the salery for him which they shall agree upon, shall be ^evied by a rate
upon all the inhabitants. In consequence of this, the minister thus chosen by
the people is (not only Christ's but also) in ^ea^^li^y the King's minister;
and the salery for him is raised in the King's name, and is the King's
allowance unto him. If the most of the inhabitants in a plantation are
episcopalians, they will have a minister of their own persuasion; and the
^issentors, if there be any in the place, must pay their proportion of the tax
for the support of this legal minister In a few of the towns, a few of the
people in hope of being released from the tax for the legal minister, sometimes
profess themselves episcopalians; but when they plead this for their exemption,
their neighbors tell them, they know in their consciences, they do not as they
would be done unto. And if a governor go by his arbitary power to superceed the
execution of the law, and require the justices and constables to leave the
episcopalians out of the tax, the people wonder he is not aware, that he is all
this while forbidding that the King should have his dues paid unto him; and
forbi^ding the King's minister to receive what the King has given him. --
Sometimes the quakers also have given some occasion for uneasiness; but where
quakerism is troublesome, some towns are so wise as to involve the salery for
the ministry in a general rate for all town charges, and so the cavils of
those, who would else refuse to pay the rate for the ministry, are obviated."
Mather's Ratio disciplinae, p. 20 -- 22.


A FEW facts may help to explain this, and to show how much greater liberty of
conscience we have enjoyed since the revolution than before. Before that
memorable event, no man in the Massachusett colony was allowed a vote, in
^^^^^ing either minister or ruler, but members in full communion in their
churches. And the skill of knowing, that those who dissented from their
judgments sinned against their own consciences, was then limited to such good
men; but now, having forty pounds worth of personal estate, or a freehold worth
forty shillings a year, intitles every inhabitant to a vote in all such
affairs, and to a power of judging that their neighbors sin against the golden
rule, if they will not put into the mouths of him whom the majority has
declared to be the legal minister. And from that day to this, it is made a
doubt among our lawyers and judges, whether a church of Christ be a society
known in law, so as to be capable of holding a meeting house or other estates,
without having other persons to be trustees or guardians for them. And the
honorable Edward Goddard, Esquire of Framingham, who had been a member, both of the
lower and upper house in our legislature, described this matter to the li^e, in
a piece he published in 1753, wherein he says.

Good conscience men allow (they say)
But must be understood,
To say as they say themselves do say,
Or else it cannot be good.
FOR 36 years after the Massachusetts received their last charter, they exerted
all their power, both in their legislative and executive courts, with every art
that ministers could help them to, in attempts to compel every town to receive
and support such ministers as they called orthodox. They made two attempts of
this nature upon Swanzey and in 1722, they added the sum of 172 l. 11 s. to the
province taxes upon Dartmouth and Tiverton, for such ministers, intending that
they should draw it out of the province treasury. And for refusing to assess
the same, Joseph Anthony, John Sission, John Akin (quakers) and Philip Tabor (a
baptist minister) select-men of those towns, were seized and confined in
Bristol goal, till the case was carried to England, and those taxes were
disannulled by the king in council, and an express order was sent over to
release them. And the first act that was made in our province, to exempt either
baptists or quakers from taxes to pedobaptist ministers was in 1728; which
says, "That from and after the publication of this act, none of the persons
commonly called anabaptists, nor any of those called quakers, that are or shall
be enrolled or entered in their several societies as members thereof and who
allege a scruple of conscience as the reason of their refusal to pay any part
or proportion of such taxes, as are from time to time assessed for the support
of the minister or ministers of the churches established by the laws of this
province, in the town or place where they dwell, shall have their polls taxed
toward the support of such minister or ministers, nor shall their bodies be at
any time taken in execution to satisfy any such ministerial rate or tax,
assessed upon their estates or faculty. Provided, that such persons do usually
attend the meetings of their respective societies, assembling upon the
Lord's Day for the worship of God, and that they live within five miles of the
place of such meeting." Here we may see that tyranny is always the same. Go ye
serve the Lord; only ^^et your slo^^ and your herds be stayed, said Pharaoh.
Let their bodies be exempted, but their estates and faculties be taxed said the
Massachusetts. I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the Lord your God,
in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. said Pharaoh. Go but
five miles, said the Massachusetts. Mr. Thomas Hollis of London, had received
such accounts of their catholic temper at Harvard-college, confirmed by the
ordination of a pious youth in Boston who was educated there, p. 523, that he
became the greatest benefactor to that college that they ever had. And I have a
letter which he wrote to Mr. Ephraim Wheaton, pastor of the first church in
Swanzey, dated March 23, 1723, wherein he says, "you have heard, or may be
informed by Mr. Callender, of my foundation in Harvard-college, and the
provision I have made for baptist youth to be educated for the ministry, and
equally regarded with pedobaptists. It you know any as may be duly qualified,
inform me, and I shall be glad to recommend them for first vacancy." But what
heart could he have to sendany youths there, while a large number of his
brethren, who, with himself, lived within the bounds of Rehoboth, were taxed
from year to year to presbyterian ministers? And after the above exempting act
was made, they were told by their county court, that it did not take place that
year. And for refusing to pay such taxes any longer, older Wheaton's son, and
27 more of his people were seized on March 3, 1729, and confined in Bristol
^^al. And more or less of such things, which by their eminent fathers are
called tyranny and robbery, p. 311, 52^, have been practiced to this day under
the mask of religion.

AND my dear country men, I must here solemnly ^all you to review the text
which has often been cast upon us; viz, Mark them who cause divisions and
offenses, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them: for
they that are such, serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and
by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of (...) ^^^ple. The
uppermost party in every state have always been ready to apply this word to
those who refuse a submission and conformity to them in religious matters. But
the mark is set upon them who cause divisions, not merely upon such as are
divided. Joseph was separated from his brethren, without his being the faulty
cause of it. Again the mark is put upon such as cause divisions contrary to
Christ's doctrine; otherwise he declares himself, that he came to send
divisions upon earth, and even betwixt near relations. This matter is justly
stated in p. 523 -- 525. The inspired apostle commands us in the name of Christ
to withdraw from every brother that walks disorderly ^ -- for we behaved not
ourselves disorderly among you, neither did we EAT ANY MAN'S BREAD FOR NAUGHT,
yet this great disorder has long been practiced under good words and fair
speeches. A PAGAN minister who loved the wages of unrighteousness once
cudgelled his beast most cruelly for not carrying him forward against a drawn
sword, whereby he would have been slain: and though the dumb ass, speaking with
man's voice, forbad the madness of the prophet, yet the above practice which
never had any better support than the cudgel (p. 100.) is madley persued by
many who call themselves christians to this day.

A convention of ministers published a discourse among us five years ago,
entitled Catholicism; or christian charity; wherein after saying many excellent
things about charity, they in p. 38, accuse those who separated from their
constitution in 1744, of zeal, yea rather fury against "giving and receiving
ministerial support;" and with a want of "consistancy and honesty," for now
coming into that practice themselves. And it is well known that this censure is
levelled against me and many of my brethren. I readily confess that I separated
from their constitution about the close of that year; but positively deny that
ever I appeared against giving and receiving ministerial support, and know not
that any of my brethren in the ministry who separated from them ever did so.
Had they said that we were zealous against assessing and forcing in such cases,
they would not have wronged the truth, and their neighbors, as they have now
done. The constitution that we separated from, was formed at Saybrook in 1708,
which says, "That the churches which are neighboring to each other shall
consociate for mutual affording to each other such assistance, as may be
requisite, UPON ALL OCCASIONS ECCLESIASTICAL." And their first proof to support
this article is Psalm 122, 3, -- 5, which speaks of the thrones of judgment
that were set in Jerusalem for the house of David. A crafty ministerial
governor, son to a Massachusett magistrate prevailed with Connecticut
legislature to approbate this platform the next year. Another Cambridge
scholar was then minister of Norwich, and was resolute to introduce the scheme
there. The law whereby it was approbated said, "Provided, that nothing herein
shall be intended or construed to hinder any society or church that is or shall
be allowed by the laws of this government, from exercising worship and
discipline in their own way according to their consciences." Yet because
Richard Bushnel and Joseph Backus Esq'rs representatives for Norwich (with
other fathers of the town) withdrew from the ministers party, rather than come
under that yoke, they laid them under church censure, and by that means
procured their expultion out of the next assembly when they met. About the same
time Mr. Stoddard publicly advanced his scheme of the Lord's Supper being a
converting ordinance, p. 484, And tho with much labor Norwich got rid of said
minister, and settled another upon their former principles, yet before I left
this latter minister, he not only plainly discovered his fondness for Saybrook
platform, but actually procured a vote of the church to receive members without
so much as a written account of any inward change; and they practice so to this
day. A few months before I separated Mr. Elisha Williams, a former president of
Yale-college, published a seasonable plea for the rights of conscience, wherein
he says, "The fountain and original of all civil power is from the people, and
is certainly instituted for their sakes; the great end of civil government, is
the preservation of their persons, their liberties, and their property. A
christian is to receive his christianity FROM CHRIST ALONE; for what is it
which is necessarily implied and supposed in the very notion of a CHIRISTIAN
but this, that he is a follower and disciple of CHRIST! As Christ's officers
have authority to teach men his mind in things pertaining to his kingdom; so
they have no authority to teach men any thing but the mind and will of Christ.
It is a truth that shines with a meridian brightness, that whatever is not
contained in a commission, is out of it and excluded by it; and the teaching
HIS LAWS ONLY being contained in the commission, what is not his law is out of
it, and by that commission they are excluded from teaching it, or forbid by it."

BUT what can be more contrary hereto than for a civil legeslature to form
every town and parish into religious societies, and to force every inhabitant
therein either to support the minister which the majority have chosen, or else
to pay a yearly acknowledgment to that usarped power ^^rer their consciences!
And which is as real a breach of public faith in our charter, as ever it was
for the British court to take from us the right of choosing our own governors,
and then to burn our towns and cut our throats for not paying them as much
money as they demanded. I have the express testimony of the elders and brethren
of seventeen of our baptist churches, who met last year at Grafton, that they
entirely agree with the sentiments and principles receited in our history. p.
14 -- 32, excepting that of infant baptism; yet great numbers of them have been
taxed to pedobaptists ministers since that time only because we refuse to pay
any further acknowledgment to the abovesaid usurped power over our consciences.
And since it is abundantly evident that, our former sufferings would have been
greater from the ruling party here than they were, if it had not been for
^^straints from the British court; and as it is also certrin that attempts have
been made from thence to prevent our un^ing now with our country against their
invasions, how can those who still incline to oppress us ever expect to
prosper, if they view the matter either in a natural, or a judicial light? --
Considered in a natural light; when we know and can prove that several thousand
dollars worth of estates have been wrasted from us on religious accounts, since
the present contest for civil liberty commenced, with what heart can we obey or
support the power which still denies us equal liberty of conscience with
themselves. And considering things judicially, let such read the warnings their
fathers had, with their effects, p. 261 -- 265, 390 -- 395, 517 -- 521, and
then venture on further in that way if they dare.

IT is to be noted, that a very large number of our countrymen of various
denominations are for the equal liberty we speak of; and I desire all to act in
the case by the rule Mr. Robinson prescribes p. 12, 13. and shall close with
the words of the aforesaid Mr. Goddard, viz.

In ancient ages, when the English realm
And popish zelots, placed at the h^^m
To stablish that religion: tithes were fixed
By cannon laws, with civil intermixed.
Which formed the English constitution so,
That after-ages ca^^^ the tithes forego:
And hence dissenters are obliged there,
To pay incumbants, whom they never hear,
Which some condemn, as a prelatic game,
Who yet, by MAJOR VOTE would play the same;
And LORD MAJORITY would claim the purse
For his incumbants; than which nothing worse
LORDLY diocesan, himself, can claim:
So these two LORDS do differ, but in name,
One pleading English laws, for his support;
The other feigning acts of our own court;
Alleging law, in a preverted sense
To render CHARTER grant, a mere pretense;
And as if law and charter both intend
To crush one church, another to befriend:
They Would make them mean, the same that Pharoh said,
Go serve the Lord, but let your flocks be slay'd.
But if one church be taxed, to serve another,
No matter whether, done by this or the other.
