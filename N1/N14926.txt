HARTFORD: PRINTED BY BARLOW AND BABCOCK,

M, DCC, LXXXV.

AT a meeting of the General Association of the State of Connecticut in June
last, it was thought expedient, that a number of the Psalms in Doctor Watts's
version, which are locally appropriated, should be altered and applied to the
state of the Christian Church in general, and not to any particular country;
and finding some attempts had been made to alter and apply those Psalms to
America, or particular parts of America, tending to destroy that uniformity in
the use of Psalmody, so desirable in religious assemblies; they appointed the
Rev. Messrs. Timothy Pitkin, John Smally and Theodore Hinsdale, a Committee to
confer with and apply to Mr. Joel Barlow, of Hartford, to make the proposed
alterations. These, together with the additions and the collection of Hymns
annexed to this Edition, we have carefully examined and approved; and we
therefore recommend them to the use of the Church of Christ, for the purposes
of public worship and private devotion.

TIMOTHY PITKIN, JOHN SMALLY, THEODORE HINSDALE,
The following gentlemen, appointed by particular Associations, to examine and
revise, concur in the above recommendation.

PREFACE.
THE reasons for undertaking the Corrections and Additions, contained in this
Edition of the Psalms are sufficiently explained in the foregoing Narrative of
the General Association's Committee. Yet the difficulty of giving general
satisfaction in attempts of this kind, cannot be realized till the experiment
be made. Among the many Versions which have been given of these Divine Songs,
in order to adapt them to the christian State and Worship, that of DOCTOR WATTS
is undoubtedly in many respects to be preferred. His Application of the
prophetic passages; his easy and natural explication of parts that are in any
measure obscure; his pure and elevated strains of devotion, so pleasing to
every pious and attentive Reader, have perhaps never been equalled in our
Language: And with respect to his style and manner of versification, they are
not only better adapted to the capacities of common, assemblies and the easy
solemnity of church music, than any other that have yet appeared; but it may be
presumed that no Poet after him will succeed in composing devotional songs,
without taking his model of style and versification from Doctor Watts. Were it
not for his local appropriation of some Psalms, and his omission of a few
others, his Version would doubtless have been used for many ages without an
amendment. But as the author of these corrections is employed, directed and
supported by so respectable a Body as the whole Clergy of the State; and as it
is an object of great importance that harmony and uniformity should be
established as extensively as possible in the use of Psalmody, he has not only
avoided all local applications, but has made some slighter corrections in point
of elegance, where the rules of grammar, established since the time of Doctor
Watts, have made it necessary.

The Psalms considerably altered are the 21st, 60th, 67th, 75th, 124th, 147th;
those omitted by Doctor Watts, are the 28th, 43d, 52d, 54th, 59th, 64th, 70th,
79th, 88th, 108th, 137th, 140th.

The Hymns are selected chiefly from Doctor Watts; some are entirely new. It
was thought advisable to bind them in the same volume, that sacramental and
other particular occasions, not provided for in the Book of Psalms, might be
supplied with suitable songs of devotion.

IMITATION OF THE PSALMS OF DAVID.
PSALM I. Common Meter. The Way and End of the Righteous and the Wicked.
BLESSED is the man who shuns the place,
Where sinners love to meet;
Who fears to tread their wicked ways,
And hates the scoffer's seat.
2
But in the statutes of the Lord,
Has placed his chief delight;
By day he reads or hears the word,
And meditates by night.
3
[He like a plant of generous kind
By living waters set,
Safe from the storms and blasting wind,
Enjoys a peaceful state.]
4
Green as the leaf, and ever fair
Shall his Profession shine;
While fruits of holiness appear
Like clusters on the vine.
5
Not so the impious and unjust;
What vain designs they form!
Their hopes are blown away like dust,
Or chaff before the storm.
6
Sinners in judgment shall not stand
Among the sons of grace,
When Christ the judge at his right hand
Appoints his saints a place.
7
His eye beholds the path they tread,
His heart approves it well;
But crooked ways of sinners lead
Down to the gates of hell.
PSALM I. Short Meter. The Saint happy, the Sinner miserable.
1
THE man is ever blessed,
Who shuns the sinners' ways,
Among their councils never stands,
Nor takes the scor^er's place:
2
But makes the law of GOD
His study and delight*
Amidst the labors of the day,
And watches of the night.
3
He like a tree shall thrive,
With waters near the root;
Fresh as the leaf his name shall live,
His works are heavenly fruit.
4
Not so the ungodly race,
They no such blessings find:
Their hopes shall flee like empty chaff
Before the driving wind.
5
How will they bear to stand
Before that judgment seat,
Where all the saints at Christ's right hand
In full assembly meet?
6
He knows and he approves
The way the righteous go:
But sinners and their works shall meet
A dreadful overthrow.
PSALM I. Long Meter. The Difference between the Righteous and the Wicked.
1
HAPPY the man, whose cautions foe*
Shun the broad way where sinners go,
Who hates the place where Atheists meet,
And fears to talk as scoffers do.
2
He loves t'employ his morning-light
Among the statutes of the Lord;
And spends the wakeful hours of night,
With pleasure pond'ring over the word.
3
He, like a plant by gentle streams,
Shall flourish in immortal green;
And Heaven will shine with kindest beams,
On every work his hands begin.
4
But sinners find their counsels crossed;
As chaff before the tempest flies;
So shall their hopes be blown and loft,
When the last trumpet shakes the skies.
5
In vain the rebel seeks to stand
In judgment with the pious race;
The dreadful Judge with stern command
Divides him to a different place.
6
"Strait is the way my saints have tred,
"I blessed the path, and drew it plain;
"But you would choose the crooked road;
"And down it leads to endless pain.
PSALM II. Short Meter. Translated according to the Divine Pattern, Acts iv.24,
etc. Christ Dying, Rising, Interceding, and Reigning.
1
[MAKER and Sovereign Lord
Of heaven and earth and seas,
Thy providence confirms thy word,
And answers thy decrees.
2
The things so long foretold
By David, are fulfilled;
When Jews and Gentiles join to slay
Jesus, thine holy Child.]
3
Why did the Gentiles rage,
And Jews with one accord
Join all their councils to destroy
The Anointed of the Lord?
4
Rulers and kings agree
To form a vain design;
Against the Lord their powers unite,
Against his Christ they join.
5
The Lord derides their rage,
And will support his throne;
He that has raised him from the dead,
Has owned him for his Son.
PAUSE.

6
Now he is ascended high,
To rule the subject earth;
The merit of his blood he pleads,
And pleads his heavenly birth.
7
Beneath his sovereign sway
The Gentile nations bend;
Far as the world's remotest bounds,
His kingdom shall extend.
8
The nations that rebel,
Must feel his iron rod;
He Will vindicate those honors well
Which he received from God.
9
[Be wise, ye rulers, now,
And worship at his throne;
With trembling joy, ye people bow,
To God's exalted Son.
10
If once his wrath arise,
Ye perish on the place;
Then blessed is the soul that flies
For refuge to his grace.]
PSALM II. Common Meter.
1
WHY did the nations join to slay
The Lord's anointed Son
Why did they cast his laws away,
And tread his gospel down?
2
The Lord that sits above the skies,
Derides their rage below,
He speaks with vengeance in his eyes,
And strikes their spirits through.
3
"I call him my eternal Son,
"And raise him from the dead;
"I make my holy hill his throne,
And wide his kingdom spread.
4
"Ask me, my Son, and then enjoy
"The utmost heathen lands;
"Thy rod of iron shall destroy
"The rebel that withstands."
5
Be wise, ye rulers of the earth,
Obey the anointed Lord,
Adore the King of heavenly birth,
And tremble at his word.
6
With humble love address his throne,
For if he frown, ye die:
Those are secure, and those alone
Who on his grace rely.
PSALM II. Long Meter. Christ's Death, Resurrection, and Ascension.
1
WHY did the Jews proclaim their rage?
The Romans why their swords employ?
Against the Lord their powers engage,
His dear Anointed to destroy?
2
"Come, let us break his bands, they say,
"This man shall never give us laws;"
And thus they cast his yoke away,
And nall'd the Monarch to the cross.
3
But God, who high in glory reigns,
Laughs at their pride. their rage controls:
He Will smite their hearts with inward pains,
And speak in thunder to their souls.
4
"I will maintain the King I made
"On Zion's everlasting hill,
"My hand shall bring him from the dead,
"And he shall stand your Sovereign still.
5
[His wondrous rising, from the earth
Makes his eternal God head known;
The Lord declares his heavenly birth:
"This day have I begot my Son.
6
"Ascend, my Son, to my right hand,
"There thou shall. as^, and I bestow
"The utmost bounds of heathen lands;
"To thee their suppliant tribes shall bow."]
7
But nations that resist his grace
Shall fall beneath his lifted rod;
His arm shall crush the impious race,
That dare provoke the avenging GOD.
PAUSE.

8
Now ye that sit un earthly thrones,
Be wise, and serve the Lord, the Lamb:
Now to his feet submit your crowns,
Rejoice and tremble at his name.
9
With humble love address the Son,
Lest he grow angry, and ye die;
His wrath will burn to worlds unknown,
His love gives life above the sky.
10
His storms shall quell the stubborn foe,
And sink his honors in the dust:
Happy the souls, their God that know,
And make his grace their only trust.
PSALM III. Common Meter. Doubts and Fears suppressed; or, God our Defi^ from
Sin and Satan.
1
MY GOD, how many are my fears?
How fast my foes increase?
Conspiring my eternal death,
They break my present peace.
2
The lying tempter would persuade
There Is no relief in heaven,
And all my growing sins appear
Too great to be forgiven.
3
But thou, my glory, and my strength,
Shall on the tempter tread,
Shall silence all my threatening guilt,
And raise my drooping head.
4
[I cried, and from his holy hill
He bowed a listening ear;
I called my Father, and my GOD,
And he subdued my fear.
5
He shed soft slumbers on mine eyes,
In spite of all my foes;
I woke and wondered at the grace
That guarded my repose.]
6
What though the hosts of death and hell
All armed against me stood;
Terrors no more shall shake my soul;
My refuge is my GOD.
7
Arise, O Lord, fulfill thy grace,
While I thy glory sing;
My God has broke the serpent's teeth,
And death has lost his sting.
8
Salvation to the Lord belongs,
His arm alone can save;
Blessings attend thy people here,
And reach beyond the grave.
PSALM III.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8. Long Meter. A Morning Psalm.
O Lord, how many are my foes,
In this weak state of flesh and blood?
My peace they daily discompose,
But my defense and hope is God.
2
Tired with the burdens of the day,
To thee I raised an evening cry;
Thou heardst when I began to pray,
And thine almighty help was nigh.
3
Supported by thine heavenly aid
I laid me down and slept secure;
Not death should make my heart afraid,
Though I should wake and rise no more.
4
But God sustained me all the night;
Salvation does to GOD belong:
He raised my head to see the light,
And makes his praise my morning song.
PSALM IV.1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. Long Meter. Hearing of Prayer; or GOD our Portion,
and Christ our Hope.
1
O God of grace and righteousness,
Hear and attend when I complain:
Thou have enlarged me in distress,
Bow down a gracious ear again.
2
Ye sons of men in vain ye try
To turn my glory into shame;
How long will scoffers love to lie,
And dare reproach my Savior's name?
3
Know that the Lord divides his saints
From all the tribes of men beside;
He hears and pities their complaints,
For the dear sake of Christ that died.
4
When our obedient hands have done
A thousand works of righteousness,
We put our trust in God alone,
And glory in his pard'ning grace.
5
Let the unthinking Many say,
"Who will bestow some earthly good?
But, Lord, thy light and love we pray;
Our souls desire this heavenly food.
6
Then shall my cheerful powers rejoice
At grace divine, and love so great;
Nor will I change my happy choice
For all their wealth and boasted state.
PSALM IV. Ver. 3, 4, 5, 8. Common Meter. An Evening Hymn.
1
LORD, thou will hear me when I pray;
I am for ever thine;
I fear before thee all the day,
Nor would I dare to sin.
2
And while I rest my weary head,
From cares and business free,
It Is sweet conversing on my bed,
With my own heart and thee.
3
I pay this evening sacrifice;
And when my work is done,
Great God, my faith and hope relies
Upon thy grace alone.
4
Thus with my thoughts composed to peace,
I Will give mine eyes to sleep:
Thy hand in safety keeps my days,
And will my slumbers keep.
PSALM V. Common Meter. For the Lord's Day Morning.
1
LORD, in the morning thou shall hear
My voice ascending high;
To thee will I direct my prayer
To thee lift up mine eye.
2
Up to the hills where Christ is gone
To plead for all his saints,
Presenting at his Father's throne
Our songs and our complaints.
3
Thou art a God, before whose sight
The wicked shall not stand;
Sinners shall never be thy delight,
Nor dwell at thy right hand.
4
But to thy house will I resort,
To ^^ste thy mercies there;
I will frequent thine holy court,
And worship in thy fear.
5
O may thy Spirit guide my feet
In ways of righteousness!
Make every path of duty strait,
And plain before my face.
PAUSE.

6
My watchful enemies combine
To tempt my feet astray;
They flatter with a base design,
To make my soul their prey.
7
Lord, crush the serpent in the dust,
And all his plots destroy;
While those that in thy mercy trust,
For ever shout for joy.
8
The men that love and fear thy name,
Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
The mighty God will compass them
With favor as a shield.
PSALM VI. Common Meter. Complaint in Sickness; or, Diseases healed.
1
IN Anger, Lord, do not chastise,
Withdraw the dreadful storm;
Nor let thine awful wrath arise
Against a feeble worm.
2
My soul bowed down with heavy cares,
My flesh with pain oppressed,
My couch is witness to my tears.
My tears forbid my rest.
3
Sorrow and grief wear out my days;
I waste the night with cries,
And count the minutes as they pass,
'Till the slow morning rise.
4
Shall I be still tormented more?
My eyes consumed with grief?
How long, my God, how long, before
Thine hand afford relief?
5
He hears his mourning children speak,
He pities all our groans,
He saves us for his mercy's sake,
And heals our broken bones.
6
The virtue of his sovereign word,
Restores our fainting breath;
For silent graves praise not the Lord,
Nor is he known in death.
PSALM VI. Long Meter. Temptations in Sickness overcome.
1
LORD, I can suffer, thy rebukes,
When thou with kindness do chastise;
But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear,
O let it not against me rise!
2
Pity my languishing estate,
And ease the sorrows that I feel;
The wounds thine heavy hand has made,
O let thy gentler touches heal!
3
See how in sighs I pass my days,
And waste in groans the weary night:
My bed is watered with my tears;
My grief consumes, and dims my sight.
4
Look how the powers of nature mourn!
How long, Almighty GOD, how long?
When shall thine hour of grace return?
When shall I make thy grace my song?
5
I feel my flesh so near the grave,
My thoughts are tempted to despair:
But graves can never praise the Lord,
For all is dust and silence there.
6
Depart, ye tempters, from my soul,
And all despairing thoughts depart;
My God, who hears my humble moan,
Will ease my flesh, and cheer my heart.
PSALM VII. Common Meter. God's Care of his People, and Punishment of
Persecutors.
1
My trust is in my heavenly Friend,
My hope in thee, my GOD:
Rise and my helpless life defend,
From those that seek my blood,
2
With insolence and fury they
My soul in pieces tear,
As hungry lions rend the prey
When no deliverer's near.
3
If ever my pride provoked them first,
Or once abused my foe,
Then let them tread my life to dust,
And lay my honor low.
4
If there be malice found in me,
I know thy piercing eyes;
I should not dare appeal to thee,
Nor ask my God to rise.
5
Arise, my God, lift up thy hand,
Their pride and power control;
Awake to judgment, and command
Deliverance for my soul.
PAUSE.

6
[Let sinners, and their wicked rage
Be humbled to the dust;
Shall not the God of truth engage
To vindicate the just!
7
He knows the heart, he tries the reins,
He will defend the upright:
His sharpest arrows he ordains
Against the sons of spite.
8
Though leagued in guile their malice spread,
A s^are before my way;
Their mischiefs on their impious head,
His vengeance shall repay.
That cruel persecuting race
Must feel his dreadful sword:
wake my soul, and praise the grace
And justice of the Lord.
PSALM VIII. Short Meter. God's Sovereignty and Goodness; and Man's Dominion
over the Creatures.
1
O Lord, our heavenly King,
Thy name is all divine;
Thy glories round the earth are spread,
And over the heavens they shine*
2
When to thy works on high
I raise my wondering eyes,
And see the moon complete in light
Adorn the darksome skies:
3
When I survey the stars
And all their shining forms,
Lord, what is man, that worthless thing,
Akin to dust and worms?
4
Lord, what is worthless man,
That thou should love him so!
Next to thine angels is he placed,
And lord of all below.
^
Thine honors crown his head,
While beasts, like slaves obey,
And birds that cut the air with wings,
And fish that cleave the sea.
6
How rich thy bounties are!
And wondrous are thy ways:
Of dust and worms thy power can frame
A monument of praise.
^
From mouths of fee^^e babes
And Sucklings, thou can draw
Surprising honors to thy name,
And strike the world with awe.
^
O Lord, our heavenly King,
Thy name is all divine:
Thy glories round the earth is spread,
And over the heavens they shine.]
PSALM VIII. Common Meter. Christ's Condescension and Glorification; or, God
made Man.
^
O Lord, our Lord, how wondrous great
Is thine exalted name!
The glories of thy heavenly state
Let men and babes proclaim.
2
When I behold thy works on high,
The moon that rules the night,
And shining stars that grace the sky,
Those moving worlds of light;
3
Lord, what is man, or all his race,
Who dwells so far below,
That thou should visit him with grace,
And love his nature so?
4
That thine eternal Son should bear
To take a mortal form,
Made lower than his angels are,
To save a dying worm.
5
[Yet while he lived on earth unknown,
And men would not adore,
Behold obedient nature own,
His Godhead and his power.
6
The waves lay spread beneath his feet,
And fish, at his command,
Bring their large shoals to Peter's net,
Bring tribute to his hand.
7
These smaller glories of the Son
Shone through the fleshly cloud;
Now we behold him on his throne,
And men confess him GOD.]
8
Let him with majesty be crowned,
Who bowed his head to death;
And his eternal honors sound,
From all things that have breath.
9
Jesus, our Lord, how wondrous great
Is thine exalted name!
The glories of thy heavenly state
Let the whole earth proclaim.
PSALM VIII. Ver. 1, 2. Paraphrased. First Part. Long Meter. The Hosanna of the
Children; Or, Insa^i^ praising God
1
ALMIGHTY Ruler of the skies,
Through the wide earth thy name is spread,
And thine eternal glories rise
Over all the heavens thy hands have made.
2
To thee the voices of the young,
There sounding notes of honor raise;
And babes, with uninstructed tongue,
Declare the, wonders of thy praise.
3
Thy power assists their tender age
To bring proud rebels to the ground,
To still the bold blasphemer's rage,
And all their policies confound.
^
Children amidst thy temple throng
To see their great Redeemer's face;
The Son of David, is their song,
And loud Hosannas till the place.
5
The frowning scribes and angry priests
In vain their impious cavils bring;
Revenge sits silent in their breasts,
While Jewish babes proclaim their King.
PSALM VIII. Ver. 3, etc. Paraphrased. Second Part. Long Meter. Adam and
Christ, Lords of the Old and New Creation.
^
LORD, what was man when made at first,
Adam the Offspring of the dust,
That thou should set him and his race
But just below an angel's place?
^
That thou should raise his nature so,
And make him lord of all below,
Make every beast and bird submit,
And lay the fishes at his feet?
^
But O! what brighter glories wait
To crown the second Adam's state!
What honors shall thy Son adorn,
Who condescended to be born?
^
See him below his angels made;
Behold him numbered with the dead,
To save a ruined world from sin:
But he shall reign with power divine.
5
The world to come, redeemed from all
The mis'ries that attend the fall,
New made and glorious, shall submit
At our exalted Savior's feet.
PSALM IX. First Meter. Wrath and Mercy from the Judgment Seat.
1
WITH my whole heart I Will raise my song,
Thy wonders I Will proclaim;
Thou sovereign judge of right and wrong
Wilt put thy foes to shame.
2
I Will sing thy majesty and grace;
My God prepares his throne
To judge the world in righteousness,
And make his vengeance known.
3
Then shall the Lord a refuge prove
For all the poor oppressed;
To save the people of his love,
And give the weary rest.
4
The men that know thy name will trust
In thy abundant grace;
For thou have never forsook the just,
Who humbly seek thy face.
5
Sing praises to the righteous Lord,
Who dwells on Zion's Hill,
Who executes his threatening word,
Whose works his grace fulfill.
PSALM IX. Ver. 12. Second Part. The Wisdom and Equity of Providence.
1
WHEN the great Judge supreme and just,
Shall once enquire for blood,
The humble souls that mourn in dust,
Shall find a faithful GOD.
2
He from the dreadful gates of death
Does his own children raise;
In Zion's gates, with cheerful breath,
They sing their Father's praise.
^
His foes shall fall, with heedless feet,
Into the pit they made;
And sinners perish in the net
That their own hands have spread.
^
Thus by thy judgment, mighty GOD,
Are thy deep counsels known;
When men of mischief are destroyed,
In snares that were their own.
PAUSE.

^
The wicked shall sink down to hell;
Thy wrath devour the lands,
That dare foget thee, or rebel
Against thy known commands.
6
Though saints to sore distress are brought,
And wait and long complain,
Their cries shall never be forgot,
Nor shall their hopes be vain.
7
[Rise, great Redeemer, from thy seat,
To judge and save the poor;
Let nations tremble at thy feet,
And man prevail no more.
^
Thy thunder shall affright the proud,
And put their hearts to pain,
Make them confess that thou art GOD,
And they but feeble men.
PSALM X. Common Meter. Prayer heard, and Saints saved; or Pride, Atheism and
Oppression punished. For a Humiliation Day.
^
WHY does the Lord depart so far,
And why conceal his face,
When great calamities appear,
And times of deep distress?
^
Lord, shall the wicked still deride
Thy justice and thy laws?
Shall they advance their heads in pride,
And slight the righteous cause.
3
They cast thy judgments from their sight,
And then insult the poor,
They boast in their exalted height,
That they shall fall no more.
4
Arise, O GOD, lift up thine hand,
Attend our humble cry;
No enemy shall dare to stand
When GOD ascends on high.
PAUSE.

5
Why do the men of malice rage,
And say with foolish pride,
"The GOD of Heaven will never engage
" To fight on Zion's Side.
6
But thou for ever art our Lord;
And powerful is thine hand,
As when the heathens felt thy sword,
And perished from thy land.
7
Thou will prepare our hearts to pray,
And cause thine ear to hear;
Accept the vows thy children pay,
And free thy saints from fear.
8
Proud tyrants shall no more oppress,
No more despise the just;
And mighty sinners shall confess
They are but earth and dust.
PSALM XI. God loves the Righteous, and hates the Wicked.
1
MY refuge is the God of love,
Why do my foes insult and cry,
"Fly like a timorous trembling dove,
"To distant woods or mountains fly.
2
If government be once destroyed,
(That firm foundation of our peace)
And violence make justice void,
Where shall the righteous seek redress?
3
The Lord in heaven has fixed his throne,
His eye surveys the world below;
To him all mortal things are known,
His eyelids search our spirits through.
4
If he afflicts his saints so far,
To prove their love, and try their grace,
What may the bold transgressors fear?
His soul abhors their wicked ways.
5
On impious wretches he shall rain
Sulphurous flames of wasting death,
Such as he kindled on the plain
Of Sodom, with his angry breath.
6
The righteous Lord loves righteous souls,
Whose thoughts and actions are sincere,
And with a gracious eye beholds
The men that his own image bear.
PSALM XII. Long Meter. The Saint's Safety and Hope in evil Times: Or, Sins of
the Tongue complained of, viz. Blasphemy, Falsehood, etc.
ALMIGHTY GOD, appear and save!
For vice and vanity prevail:
The godly perish in the grave,
The just depart, the faithful fail.
2
The whole discourse, when crowds are met,
Is filled with trifles loose and vain;
Their lips are flattery and deceit,
And their proud language is profane.
3
But lips that with deceit abound
Shall not maintain their triumph long:
The God of vengeance will confound
The flattering and blaspheming tongue.
4
" Yet shall our words be free, they cry;
"Our tongues shall be controlled by none:
"Where is the Lord, will ask us why?
"Or say, our lips are not our own?"
5
The Lord, who sees the poor oppressed,
And hears the oppressor's haughty strain,
Will rise to give his children rest,
Nor shall they trust his word in vain.
6
Thy word, O Lord, though often tried,
Void of deceit shall still appear;
Not silver, seven times purified
From dross and mixture, shines so clear.
6
Thy grace shall in the darkest hour
Defend from danger and surprise;
Though when the vilest men have power,
On every side oppressors rise.
PSALM XII. Common Meter. Complaint of a general Corruption of Manners: Or, The
Promise and Signs of Christ's coming to Judgment*
1
HELP, Lord, for men of virtue fail,
Religion loses ground;
The sons of violence prevail,
And treacheries abound.
2
Their oaths and promises they break,
Yet act the flatterer's part;
With fair deceitful lips they speak,
And with a double heart.
3
If we reprove some hateful lie,
They scorn our faithful word:
" Are not our lips our own," they cry,
"And who shall be our Lord?"
4
Scoffers appear on every side,
Where a vile race of men
Is raised to feats of power and pride,
And bears the sword in vain.
PAUSE.

5
Lord, when iniquities abound,
And blasphemy grows bold,
When faith is rarely to be found,
And love is waxing cold;
6
Is not thy chariot hastening on?
Have thou not given the sign?
May we not trust and live upon
A promise so divine?
7
"Yes, says the Lord, now will I rise,
"And make the oppressors flee;
"I shall appear to their surprise,
"And set my servants free."
8
Thy word, like silver seven times tried,
Through ages shall endure;
The men that in thy truth confide
Shall find thy promise sure.
PSALM XIII. Common Meter. Complaint under the Temptation of the Devil.
HOW long will thou conceal thy face?
My GOD, how long delay?
When shall I feel those heavenly rays
That chase my fears away?
^
How long shall my poor laboring soul
Wrestle and toil in vain?
Thy word can all my foes control,
And ease my raging pain.
^
See how the Prince of darkness tries
All his malicious arts;
He spreads a mist around my eyes,
And throws his firey darts.
^
Be thou my sun, and thou my shield,
My soul in safety keep;
Make haste before mine eyes are sealed
In death's eternal sleep.
^
How would the tempter boast aloud,
Should I become his prey!
Behold the sons of hell grow proud
To see thy long delay.
6
But they shall fly at thy rebuke,
And Satan hide his head;
He knows the terrors of thy look*
And hears thy voice with dread.
7
Thou will display that sovereign grace
Whence all my comforts spring.
I shall employ my lips in praise,
And thy salvation sing.
PLALM XIV. First Part. Com. Meter. By Nature all Men are sinners.
1
FOOLS in their hearts believe and say,
"That all religion's vain,
"There is no God that reigns on high,
"Or minds the affairs of men."
2
From thoughts so dreadful and profane
Corrupt discourse proceeds;
And in their impious hands are found
Abominable deeds.
3
The Lord from his celestial throne
Looked down on things below,
To find the man that sought his grace,
Or did his justice know.
4
By nature all are gone astray,
Their practice all the same;
There Is none that fears his Maker's hand,
There Is none that loves his name.
5
Their tongues are used to speak deceit,
Their slanders never cease;
How swift to mischief are their feet;
Nor know the paths of peace.
6
Such seeds of sin (that bitter root)
In every heart are found;
Nor can they bear diviner fruit,
Till grace refine the ground.
PSALM XIV. Second Part. Com. Meter. The folly of Persecutors.
1
ARE sinners now so senseless grown
That they the saints devour?
And never worship at thy throne,
Nor fear thine awful power?
2
Great God, appear to their surprise,
Reveal thy dreadful name;
Let them no more thy wrath despise,
Nor turn our hope to shame.
3
Do thou not dwell among the just?
And yet our foes deride,
That we should make thy name our trust:
Great God, confound their pride.
4
Oh that the joyful day were come
To finish our distress!
When GOD shall bring his children home,
Our songs shall never cease.
PSALM XV. Common Meter. Characters of a Saint; Or, A Citizen of Zion; Or, The
Qualifications of a Christian.
1
WHO shall inhabit in thy hill,
O GOD of holiness?
Whom will the Lord admit to dwell
So near his throne of grace?
2
The man that walks in pious ways,
And works with righteous hands;
That trusts his Maker's promised grace
And follows his commands.
3
He speaks the meaning of his heart,
Nor slanders with his tongue;
Will scarce believe an ill report,
Nor do his neighbor wrong.
4
The wealthy sinner he contemns,
Loves all that fear the Lord;
And though to his own hurt he swears,
Still he performs his Word.
5
His hands disdain a golden bribe,
And never wrong the poor,
This man shall dwell with God on earth,
And find his heaven secure.
PSALM XV. Long Meter. Religion and Justice, Goodness and Truth; or, duties to
GOD and Man; or, the Qualification of a Christian.
1
WHO shall ascend thy heavenly place,
Great God, and dwell before thy face?
The man that minds religion now,
And humbly walks with God below:
2
Whose hands are pure, whose heart is clean;
Whose lips still speak the thing they mean;
No slanders dwell upon his tongue;
He hates to do his neighbor wrong.
3
[Scarce, will he trust an ill report,
Or vent it to his neighbor's hurt:
Sinners of state he can despise,
But saints are honored in his eyes.
4
[Firm to his word he ever stood,
And always makes his promise good
Nor dares to change the thing he swears,
Whatever pain or loss he bears.]
5
[He never deals in bribing gold,
And mourns that justice should be sold:
While others scorn and wrong the poor,
Sweet charity attends his door.
6
He loves his enemies, and prays
For those that curse him to his face;
And does to all men still the same
That he would hope or wish from them.
7
Yet, when his holiest works are done,
His soul depends on grace alone:
This is the man thy face shall see,
And dwell for ever, Lord, with thee.
PSALM XVI. First Part. Long Meter. Confession of our Poverty; and, Saints the
best Company: or, Good Works profit Men, not GOD.
1
PRESERVE me, Lord, in time of need,
For succor to thy throne I flee,
But have no merits there to plead;
My goodness cannot reach to thee.
2
Often have my heart and tongue confessed
How empty and how poor I am;
My praise can never make thee blessed,
Nor add new glories to thy name.
3
Yet, Lord, thy saints on earth may reap
Some profit by the good we do;
These are the company I keep.
These are the choicest friends I know.
4
Let others choose the sons of mirth
To give a relish to their wine;
I love the men of heavenly birth,
Whose thoughts and language are divine.
PSALM XVI. Second Part. Long Meter. Christ's Allsufficiency.
^
HOW fast their guilt and sorrows rise,
Who haste to seek some idol god!
I will not taste their sacrifice,
Their offerings of forbidden blood.
^
My GOD provides a richer cup,
And nobler food to live upon;
He for my life his offered up
Jesus, his best beloved Son.
^
His love is my perpetual feast;
By day his counsels guide me right;
And be his name forever belst,
Who gives me sweet advice by night.
4
I set him stiil before mine eyes;
At my right hand he stands prepared
To keep my soul from all surprise,
And be my everlasting guard.
PSALM XVI. Third Part. Long Meter. Courage in Death, and Hope of the
Resurrection.
1
WHEN GOD is nigh, my faith is strong,
His arm is my almighty prop.
Be glad, my heart, rejoice, my tongue,
My dying flesh shall rest in hope.
2
Though in the dust I lay my head,
Yet, gracious GOD, thou, wilt not leave
My soul for ever with the dead,
Nor lose thy children in the grave.
3
My flesh shall thy first call obey,
Shake off the dust, and rise on high;
Then shall thou lead the wondrous way
Up to the throne above the sky.
4
There streams of endless pleasure flow;
And full discoveries of thy grace
[Which we but tasted here below]
Spread heavenly joys through all the place.
PSALM XVI.1 -- 8. First Part. Com. Meter. Support and Counsel from GOD without
Merit.
1
SAVE me, O Lord, from every foe;
In thee my (...) I place,
Though all the good that I can do
Can never de^erve thy grace;
2
Yet if my God prolong my breath,
The saint^ ^o^y still rejoice,
The saints, the glory of the earth,
The people of my choice.
3
Let heathens to their idols haste,
And worship wood or stone;
But my delightful lot is cast
Where the true God is known.
4
His hand provides my constant food,
He fills my daily cup;
Much am I pleased with present good,
But more rejoice in hope.
5
God is my portion and my joy;
His counsels are my light:
He gives me sweet advice by day,
And gentle hints by night.
6
My soul would all her thoughts approve.
To his all-seeing eye;
Not death nor hell my hope shall move
While such a friend is nigh.
PSALM XVI. Second Part. Common Meter. The Death and Resurrection of Christ.
1
"I Set the Lord before my face,
"He bears my courage up:
"My heart, my tongue their joys express,
"My flesh shall ^est in hope.
2
"My spirit, Lord, thou will not leave
"Where souls departed are;
"Nor quit my body to the grave
"To see corruption there.
^
"Thou will reveal the path of life,
"And raise me to thy throne:
"Thy courts immortal pleasure give,
"Thy presence joys unknown."
^
[Thus in the name of Christ the Lord,
The holy David sung,
And Providence fulfils the word
Of his prophetic tongue.
5
Jesus, whom every saint adores,
Was crucified and slain;
Behold the tomb its prey restores.
Behold he lives again.
9
When shall my feet arise and stand
On heaven's eternal hills?
There sits the Son at God's right hand,
And there the Father smiles.]
PSALM XVII. Ver. 13, etc. Short Meter. Portion of Saints and Sinners; or, Hope
and Despair in Death.
1
ARISE, my gracious God,
And make the wicked flee;
They are but thy chastising rod
To drive thy saints to thee.
2
Behold the sinner dies,
His haughty words are vain;
Here in this life his pleasure lies,
And all beyond is pain.
3
Then let his pride advance,
And boast of all his store;
The Lord is my inheritance,
My soul can wish no more.
4
I shall behold the face
Of my forgiving God;
And stand complete in righteousness,
Washed in my Savior's blood.
5
There Is a new heaven begun
When I awake from death,
Dressed in the likeness of thy Son,
And draw immortal breath.
PSALM XVII. Long Meter. (...) ^^nner's Portion and Saint's Hope; or, the
Heaven of separate Souls, and the Resurrection.
^
LORD, I am thine; but thou will prove
My faith my patience and my love;
When men of spite against me join,
They are the sword, the hand is thine.
^
Their hope and portion lie below;
It Is all the happiness they know,
It Is all they seek; they take their shares;
And leave the rest among their heirs.
^
What sinners value, I resign;
Lord it is enough that thou art mine^
I shall behold thy blissful face,
And stand complete in righteousness.
4
This life's a dream, an empty show;
But the bright world, to which I go,
Has joys substantial and sincere;
When shall I wake and find me there?
5
O glorious hour! O blessed abode!
I shall be near, and like my God;
And flesh and sin no more control
The sacred pleasures of the soul.
^
My flesh shall slumber in the ground,
Till the last trumpet's joyful sound:
Then burst the chains with sweet surprise
And in my Savior's image rise.
PSALM XVIII. First Part. Long Meter. Ver. 1 -- 9, 15 -- 18. Deliverance from
Despair; or, Temptation overcome
^
THEE will I love, O Lord, my strength,
My rock, my tower, my high defense;
Thy mighty arm shall be my trust,
For I have found salvation thence,
2
Death, and the terrors of the grave,
Stood round me with their dismal shade;
While floods of high temptation rose,
And made my sinking soul afraid.
3
I saw the opening gates of hell
With endless pains and sorrows there,
(Which none but they that feel can tell)
While I was hurried to despair.
4
In my distress I called my God,
When I could scarce believe him mine;
He bowed his ear to my complaint;
And proved his saving grace divine.
5
[With speed he flew to my relief,
As on a cherub's wing he rode;
Awful, and bright as lightning, shone
The face of my deliverer God.
6
Temptations fled at his rebuke,
The blast of his Almighty breath:
He sent salvation from on high,
And drew me from the deeps of death.]
7
Great were my fears, my foes were great,
Much was their strength, and more their rage;
But Christ, my Lord, is conqueror still
In all the wars the proud can wage.
8
My song for ever shall record
That terrible, that joyful hour;
And give the glory to the Lord
Due to his mercy and his power.
PSALM XVIII. Second Part. Ver. 20 -- 26. Long Meter. Sincerity proved and
rewarded.
1
LORD, thou have seen my soul sincere,
Have made thy truth and love appear:
Before mine eyes I set thy laws,
And thou have owned my righteous ca^^
2
Since I have learned thy holy ways,
I Have walked upright before thy face:
Or if my feet did ever depart,
Thy love reclaimed my wandering heart.
3
What sore temptations broke my rest!
What wars and strugglings in my breast!
But through thy grace that reigns within,
I guard against my darling sin.
4
That sin that close besets me still,
That works and strives against my will;
When shall thy spirit's sovereign power
Destroy it, that it rise no more?
5
With an impartial hand, the Lord
Deals out to mortals their reward:
The kind and faithful souls shall find
A God as faithful and as kind.
6
And men that love revenge shall know,
God has an arm of vengeance too.
The just and pure, shall ever say,
Thou art more pure, more just than they.
PSALM XVIII. Third Part. Long Meter. Ver. 30, 31, 34, 35, 46, etc.
1
JUST are thy ways, and true thy word,
Great Rock of my secure abode:
Who is a God beside the Lord?
Or where is a refuge like our God?
2
It Is he that girds me with his might,
Gives me his holy sword to wield;
And while with sin and hell I fight,
Spreads his salvation for my shield.
3
He lives, and blessings crown his reign,
The God of my salvation lives,
The dark designs of hell are vain;
While heavenly peace my Father gives.
4
Before the scoffers of the age,
I will exalt my Father's name,
Nor tremble at their mighty rage,
But meet reproach, and bear the shame.
5
To David and his royal seed
Thy grace forever shall extend;
Thy love to saints, in Christ their head,
Knows not a limit, nor an end.
PSALM XVIII. First Part. Common Meter. Victory and Triumph over Temporal
Enemies.
1
WE love thee, Lord, and we adore,
Now is thine arm revealed;
Thou art our strength, our heavenly tower,
Our bulwark and our shield.
2
We fly to our eternal Rock,
And find a sure defense;
His holy name our lips invoke,
And draw salvation thence.
3
When God our leader shines in arms,
What mortal heart can bear
The thunder of his loud alarms?
The lightning of his spear?
4
He rides upon the winged wind,
And angels in array
In millions wait to know his mind,
And swift as flames obey.
5
He speaks, and at his fierce rebuke
Whole armies are dismayed;
His voice, his frown, his angry look
Strikes all their courage dead.
6
He forms our generals for the field,
With all their dreadful skill;
Gives them his awful sword to wield,
And makes their hearts of steel.
7
Often has the Lord whole nations blessed
For his own church's sake;
The powers that give his people rest,
Shall of his care partake.
PSALM XVIII. Second Part. Com. Meter. The Conquerors Song.
1
TO thine almighty arm we owe
The triumphs of the day;
Thy terrors, Lord, confound the foe,
And melt their strength away.
2
It Is by thy aid our troops prevail,
And break united powers,
Or burn their boasted fleets, or scale
The proudest of their towers.
3
How have we chased them through the field,
And trod them to the ground,
While thy salvation was our shield,
But they no shelter found!
4
In vain to idol saints they cry,
And perish in their blood;
Where is a rock so great so high,
So powerful as our God?
5
The God of Israel ever lives;
His name be ever blessed;
It Is his own arm the victory gives,
And gives his people rest.
PSALM XIX. First Part. Short Meter. The Book of Nature and Scripture. For a
Lord's Day Morning.
1
BEHOLD the lofty sky
Declares its maker God,
And all the starry works on high
Proclaim his power abroad.
2
The darkness and the light
Still keep their course the same;
While night to day and day to night
Divinely teach his name.
3
In every different land
Their general voice is known;
They show the wonders of his hand,
And orders of his throne.
4
Ye christian lands, rejoice,
Here he reveals his word;
We are not left to nature's voice
To bid us know the Lord.
5
His statutes and commands
Are set before our eyes,
He puts his gospel in our hands,
Where our salvation lies.
6
His laws are just and pure,
His truth without deceit,
His promises forever sure,
And his rewards are great.
7
[Not honey to the taste
Affords so much delight,
Nor gold that has the furnace passed
So much allures the sight.
8
While of thy works I sing,
Thy glory to proclaim,
Accept the praise, my God, my King,
In my Redeemer's name.]
PSALM XIX. Second Part. Short Meter. GOD's word most Excellent: Or, Sincerity
and Watchfulness. For a Lord's Day Morning.
1
BEHOLD the morning sun
Begins his glorious way;
His beams through all the nations run,
And life and light convey.
2
But where the gospel comes
It spreads diviner light,
It calls dead sinners from their tombs,
And gives the blind their sight.
3
How perfect is thy word!
And all thy judgments just,
Forever sure thy promise, Lord,
And men securely trust.
4
My gracious God, how plain
Are thy directions given!
Oh may I never read in vain,
But find the path to heaven!
PAUSE.

5
I heard thy word with love,
And I would fain obey;
Send thy good spirit from above
To guide me, lest I stray.
6
Oh who can ever find
The errors of his ways?
Yet with a bold presumptuous mind
I would not dare transgress.
7
Warn me of every sin,
Forgive my secret faults,
And cleanse this guilty soul of mine,
Whose crimes exceed my thoughts.
8
While with my heart and tongue
I spread thy praise abroad;
Accept the worship and the song,
My Savior and my God.
PSALM XIX. Long Meter. The Books of Nature, and Scripture compared. Or, The
Glory and Success of the Gospel.
1
THE heavens declare thy glory, Lord,
In every star thy goodness shines;
But when our eyes behold thy word,
We read thy name in fairer lines.
2
The rolling sun, the changing light,
And nights and days thy power confess;
But the blessed volume thou have writ,
Reveals thy justice and thy grace.
3
Sun, moon and stars convey thy praise
Round the whole earth, and never stand;
So when thy truth began its race.
It touched and glanced on every land.
4
Nor shall thy spreading gospel rest
Till through the world thy truth has run;
Till Christ has all the nations blessed,
That see the light, or feel the sun.
5
Great Sun of Righteousness, arise,
Bless the dark world with heavenly light;
Thy gospel makes the simple wise,
Thy laws are pure, thy judgments right.
6
Thy noblest wonders here we view,
In souls renewed and sins forgiven,
Lord, cleanse my sins, my soul renew,
And make thy word my guide to heaven.
PSALM XIX. The Book of Nature and Scripture.
To the tune of the 113th Psalm
1
GREAT GOD, the heaven's well ordered frame
Declares the glories of thy name:
There thy rich works of wonder shine,
A thousand starry beauties there,
A thousand radiant marks appear
Of boundless power, and skill divine.
2
From night to day, from day to night,
The dawning and the dying light,
Lectures of heavenly wisdom read;
With silent eloquence they raise
Our thoughts to our Creator's praise,
And neither sound nor language need.
3
Yet their divine instructions run
Far as the journeys of the sun,
And every nation knows their voice:
The sun, like some young bridegroom dressed,
Breaks from the chambers of the east,
Rolls round, and makes the earth rejoice.
4
Where ever he spreads his beams abroad,
He smiles, and speaks his maker GOD:
All nature joins to show thy praise:
Thus God in every creature shines;
Fair is the book of nature's lines,
But fairer is the book of grace.
PAUSE.

5
I love the volumes of thy word;
What light and joy those leaves afford
To souls benighted and distressed!
Thy precepts guide my doubtful way,
Thy fear forbids my feet to stray,
Thy promise leads my heart to rest.
6
From the discoveries of thy law
The perfect rules of life I draw:
These are my study and delight;
Not honey so invites the taste,
Nor gold that has the furnace past
Appears so pleasing to the sight.
7
Thy threatenings wake my slumbering eyes,
And warm me where my danger lies;
But it is thy blessed gospel, Lord,
That makes my guilty conscience clean,
Converts my soul, subdues my sin,
And gives a free, but large reward.
8
Who knows the errors of his thoughts?
My God, forgive my secret faults,
And from presumptuous sins restrain;
Accept my poor attempts of praise,
That I have read thy book of grace
And book of nature not in vain.
PSALM XX. Prayer and Hope of Victory. For a Day of Prayer in Time of War.
1
NOW may the GOD of power and grace
Attend his people's humble cry!
Jehovah hears when Israel prays,
And brings deliverance from on high.
2
The name of Jacob's God defends,
When bucklers fail and brazen walls;
He from his sanctuary sends
Succor and strength when Zion calls.
3
Well he remembers all our sighs,
His love exceeds our best deserts;
His love accepts the sacrifice
Of humble groans and broken hearts.
4
In his salvation is our hope,
And in the name of Israel's GOD,
Our troops shall lift their banners up,
Our navies spread their flags abroad.
5
Some trust in horses trained for war,
And some of chariots make their boasts;
Our surest expectations are
From thee, the Lord of heavenly hosts.
6
[O may the memory of thy name
Inspire our armies for the fight!
Our foes shall fall and die with shame,
Or quit the field with coward flight.]
7
Now save us, Lord, from slavish fear,
Now let our hopes be firm and strong,
Till thy salvation shall appear,
And joy and triumph raise the song.
PSALM XXI. Common Meter. National Blessings acknowledged.
IN thee great God, with songs of praise,
Our favored realms rejoice;
And, blessed with thy salvation, raise
To heaven their cheerful voice.
2
Thy sure defense, through nations round,
Has spread our rising name,
And all our feeble efforts crow'd
With freedom and with fame.
3
In deep distress our injured land
Implored thy power to save;
For life we prayed; thy bounteous hand
The timely blessing gave.
4
Thy mighty arm, eternal Power.
Opposed their deadly aim,
In mercy swept them from our shore,
And spread their sails with shame.
5
On thee, in want, in woe or pain,
Our hearts alone rely;
Our rights thy mercy will maintain,
And all our wants supply.
6
Thus, Lord, thy wondrous power declare,
And still exalt thy fame;
While we glad songs of praise prepare,
For thine Almighty name.
PSALM XXI.1 -- 9. Long Meter. Christ exalted to the Kingdom.
1
DAVID rejoiced in GOD his strength,
Raised to the throne by special grace,
But Christ the son appears at length,
Fulfils the triumph and the praise.
2
How great the blessed Messiah's joy
In the salvation of thy hand!
Lord, thou have raised his kingdom high,
And given the world to his command.
3
Thy goodness grants what-e'er he will,
Nor does the least request withold:
Blessings of love prevent him still,
And crowns of glory, not of gold.
4
Honor and majesty divine
Around his sacred temples shine:
Blessed with the favor of thy face,
And length of everlasting days.
5
Thine hand shall find out all his foes;
And as a firey oven glows
With raging heat and living coals,
So shall thy wrath devour their souls.
PSALM XXII.1 -- 16. First Part, Common Meter. The Sufferings and Death of
CHRIST.
1
WHY has my God my soul forsook,
Nor will a smile afford?
(Thus David once in anguish spoke,
And thus our dying Lord.)
2
Though it is thy chief delight to dwell
Among thy praising saints,
Yet thou can hear our groan as well,
And pity our complaints.
3
Our fathers trusted in thy name,
And great deliverance found;
But I Am a worm despised of men,
And trodden to the ground.
4
With shaking head they pass me by,
And laugh my soul to scorn;
" In vain he trusts in God, they cry,
"Neglected and forlorn."
5
But thou art he, who formed my flesh,
By thine almighty word;
And since I hung upon the breast
My hope is in the Lord.
6
Why will my father hide his face
When foes stand threatening round
In the dark hour of deep distress,
And not an helper found?
PAUSE.

7
Behold thy darling left among
The cruel and the proud,
By foes encompassed fierce and strong,
As lions roaring loud.
^
From earth and hell my sorrows meet,
To multiply the smart;
They nail my hands, they pierce my feet,
And try to vex my heart.
^
Yet if thy sovereign hand let loose
The rage of earth and hell,
Why will my heavenly father bruise
The son he loves so well?
10
My God, if possible it be,
Withold this bitter cup;
But I resign my will to thee,
And drink the sorrows up.
11
My heart dissolves with pangs unknown,
In groans I waste my breath:
Thy heavy hand has brought me down,
Low as the dust of death.
12
Father, I give my spirit up,
And trust it in thy hand;
My dying flesh shall rest in hope,
And rise at thy command.
PSALM XXII.20, 21, 27, -- 31. Second Part. Common Meter.
1
"NOW from the roaring lion's rage,
"O Lord, protect thy Son,
"Nor leave thy darling to engage
"The powers of hell alone."
^
Thus did our suffering Savior pray
With mighty cries and tears,
GOD heard him in that dreadful day,
And chased away his fears.
^
Great was the victory of his death
His throne exalted high;
And all the kindreds of the earth
Shall worship or shall die.
^
A numerous offspring must arise
From his expiring groans;
They shall be reckoned in his eyes
For daughters and for sons.
5
The meek and humble souls shall see
His table richly spread;
And all that seek the Lord shall be
With joys immortal fed.
6
The isles shall know the righteousness
Of our incarnate GOD,
And nations yet unborn profess
Salvation in his blood.
PSALM XXII. Long Meter. Christ's Sufferings and Exaltation.
1
NOW let our mournful songs record
The dying sorrows of our Lord,
When he complained in tears and blood,
As one forsaken of his God.
2
The Jews behold him thus forlorn,
And shake their heads and laugh in scorn;
"He rescued others from the grave;
"Now let him try himself to save.
3
"This is the man did once pretend
"God was his father and his friend;
"If God the blessed loved him so,
"Why does he fail to help him now?"
4
Oh savage people! cruel priests!
How they stood round like raging beasts;
Like lions gaping to devour,
When God had left him in their power.
5
They wound his head, his hands, his feet,
Till streams of blood each other meet;
By lot his garments they divide,
And mock the pangs in which he died.
6
But God his father heard his cry;
Raised from the dead he reigns on high;
The nations learn his righteousness,
And humble sinners taste his grace.
PSALM XXIII. Long Meter. GOD our Shepherd.
1
MY shepherd is the living Lord;
Now shall my wants be well supplied;
His providence and holy word
Become my safety and my guide.
2
In pastures where salvation grows
He makes me feed, he makes me rest,
There living water gently flows,
And all the food divinely blessed.
3
My wandering feet his ways mistake;
But he restore my soul to peace,
And leads me, for his mercy's sake,
In the fair paths of righteousness.
4
Though I walk through the gloomy vale,
Where death and all its terrors are,
My heart and hope shall never fail,
For God, my shepherd's with me there.
5
Amidst the darkness and the deeps
Thou art my comfort, thou my ^^ay;
Thy staff supports my feeble steps,
Thy rod directs my doubtful way.
6
The sons of earth and sons of hell
Gaze at thy goodness, and repine
To see my table spread so well
With living bread and cheerful wine.
7
[How I rejoice, when on my head
Thy Spirit condescends to rest!
It Is a divine anointing shed,
Like oil of gladness at a feast.
8
Surely the mercies of the Lord
Attend his household all their days;
There will I dwell to hear his word,
To seek his face, and sing his praise.]
PSALM XXIII. Common Meter.

MY Shepherd will supply my need,
Jehovah is his name;
In pastures fresh he makes me feed,
Beside the living stream.

He brings my wandering spirit back
When I forsake his ways,

In paths of truth and grace.

When I walk through the shades of death,
Thy presence is my stay;
One word of thy supporting breath
Drives all my fears away.

Thy hand in sight of all my foes
Does still my table spread;
My cup with blessings overflows,
Thine oil anoints my head.
5
The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days;

No m^^^ a stranger or a guest,
But like a child at home.
PSALM XXIII. Short Meter.

THE Lord my shepherd is,
I shall be well supplied;
Since he is mine and I am his,
What can I want beside?

He leads me to the place,
Where heavenly pasture grows,
Where living waters gently pass,
And full salvation flows.
3
If ever I go astray,
He does my soul reclaim,
And guides me in his own right way,
For his most holy name.
4
While he affords his aid,
I cannot yield to fear;
Though I should walk through death's dark shade,
My Shepherd's with me there.
5
Amid surrounding foes
Thou do my table spread,
My cup with blessings overflows,
And joy exalts my head.

The bounties of thy love
Shall crown my following days;
Nor from thy house will I remove,
Nor cease to speak thy praise.
PSALM XXIV. Common Meter. Dwelling with GOD.
1
THE earth forever is the Lord's
With Adam's numerous race;
He raised its arches over the floods,
And built it on the seas.
2
But who among the sons of men
May visit thine abode?
He that has hands from mischief clean*
Whose heart is right with GOD.
3
This is the man may rise and take
The blessings of his grace;
This is the lot of those that seek
The GOD of Jacob's face.
4
Now let our soul's immortal powers,
To meet the Lord prepare,
Lift up their everlasting doors,
The king of glory's near.
5

The wonders of his might?
He rules the nations; but to dwell
With saints is his delight.
PSALM XXIV. Long Meter. Saints dwell in Heaven; or Christ's Ascension.
1
THIS spacious earth is all the Lord's,
And men and worms, and beasts and birds*
He raised the building on the seas,
And gave it for their dewlling place.
2
But there is a brighter world on high,
Thy palace, Lord, above the sky;
Who shall ascend that blessed abode,
And dwell so near his Maker GOD?
3
He that abhors and fears to sin,
Whose heart is pure, whose hands are clean,
Him shall the Lord, the Savior bless,
And clothe his soul with righteousness.
4
These are the men, the pious race,
That seek the God of Jacob's face;
These shall enjoy the blissful sight
And dwell in everlasting light.
PAUSE.

5
Rejoice, ye shining worlds on high,
Behold the king of glory nigh;
Who can this king of glory be?
The mighty Lord, the Savior's he.
6
Ye heav^^^^ gates, your leaves display,
To make the Lord, the Savior way:
^^den with spoils from earth and hell,
The Conqueror comes with God to dwell.
7
Raised from the dead in royal state,
He opens heaven's eternal gate,
To give his saints a blessed abode,
Near their Redeemer and their God.
PSALM XXV.1 -- 11. First Part. Waiting for Pardon and Direction.
1
I LIFT my soul to God,
My trust is in his name;
Let not my foes that seek my blood
Still triumph in my shame.
^
Sin and the power's of hell
Persuade me to despair;
Lord, make me know thy covenant well,
That I may 'scape the snare.
3
From gleams of dawning light
Till evening shades arise,
For thy salvation, Lord, I wait,
With ever longing eyes.
4
Remember all thy grace,
And lead me in thy truth;
Forgive the sins of riper days,
And follies of my youth.
5
The Lord is just and kind,
The meek shall learn his ways,
And every humble sinner find
The methods of his grace.

For his own goodness sake
He saves my soul from shame;
He pardons (though my guilt be great)
Through my Redeemer's name.

That loves the gospel's joyful sound*
And trembles at the rod?
2
The Lord shall make him know
The secrets of his heart,
The wonders of his covenant show,
And all his love impart.
3
The dealings of his power
Are truth and mercy still,
With such as keep his covenant sure,
And love to do his will.

Their souls shall dwell at ease
Before their Maker's face,
Their seed shall taste the promises
In their extensive grace.

Bring thy salvation near;
When will thy hand assist my feet
To 'scape the deadly snare?
3
When shall the sovereign grace
Of my forgiving GOD
Restore me from those dangerous ways
My wandering feet have trod?
4
The tumult of my thoughts
Does but enlarge my woe;
My spirit languishes, my heart
Is de^ and low.
5
With every morning light
My sorrow new begins;
Look on my anguish and my pain,
And pardon all my sins.
PAUSE.

6
Behold the hosts of hell,
How cruel is their hate!
Against my life they rise, and join
Their fury with deceit.
7
Oh, keep my soul from death,
Nor put my hope to shame,
For I have placed my only trust
In my Redeemer's name.
8
With humble faith I wait
To see thy face again;
Of Israel it shall never be said,
He sought the Lord in vain.
PSALM XXVI. Long Meter. Self-Examination; or, Evidences of Grace.
1
JUDGE me, O Lord, and prove my ways,
And try my reins, and try my heart;
My faith upon thy promise stays,
Nor from thy law my feet depart.
2
I hate to walk, I hate to sit
With men of v^nity and lies;
The scoffer and the hypocrite
Are the abhorrence of mine eyes.
3
Amongst thy saints will I appear
Arrayed in robes of innocence;
But when I stand before thy bar,
The blood of Christ is my defense.
4
I love thy habitation, Lord,
The temple where thine honors dwell*
There shall I hear thy holy word,
And there thy works of wonder tell.
5
Let not my soul be joined at last
With men of treachery and blood,
Since I my days on earth have past
Among the saints, and near my God.

Oh grant me mine abode
Among the churches of thy saints,
The temples of my God.
3
There shall I offer my requests
And see thy beauty still;
Shall hear thy messages of love,
And there enquire thy will.
4
When troubles rise and storms appear,
There may his children hide;
God has a strong pavilion, where
He makes my soul abide.
5
Now shall my head be lifted high
Above my foes around,
And songs of joy and victory
Within thy temple sound.
PSALM XXVII.8, 9, 13, 14. Second Part. Common Meter. Prayer and Hope.
1
SOON as I heard my Father say,
"Ye childern, seek my grace,
My heart replied without delay,
"Ill seek my Father's face.
2
Let not thy face be hid from me,
Nor frown my soul away;
GOD of my life, I fly to thee
In a distressing day.
3
Should friends and kindred near and dear
Leave me to want or die,
My GOD would make my life his care,
And all my need supply.
4
My fainting flesh had died with grief,
Had not my soul believed,
To see thy grace provide relief,
Nor was my hope deceived.

Wait on the Lord, ye trembling saints,
And keep your courage up;
He Will raise your spirit when it faints,
And far exceed your hope.
PSALM XXVIII. Long Meter. God the Refuge of the Afflicted.
1
TO thee, O Lord, I raise my cries;
My fervent prayer in mercy hear;
For ruin waits my trembling soul,
If thou refuse a gracious ear.
^
When suppliant towered thy holy hill,
I lift my mournful hands to pray,
Afford thy grace, nor drive me still,
With impious hypocrites away.
^
To sons of falsehood, that despise
The works and wonders of thy reign,
Thy vengeance gives the due reward,
And sinks their souls to endless pain.
^
But, ever blessed be the Lord,
Whose mercy hears my mournful voice,
My heart, that trusted in his word,
In his salvation shall rejoice.
5
Let every saint, in sore distress,
By faith approach his Savior God;
Then grant, O Lord, thy pardoning grace,
And feed thy church with heavenly food.
PSALM XXIX. Long Meter. Storm and Thunder.
^
GIVE to the Lord, ye sons of fame,
Give to the Lord renown and pow^^*
Ascribe due honors to his name,
And his eternal might adore.
^
The Lord proclaims his power aloud
Through every ocean, every land;
His voice divides the watery cloud,
And lightnings blaze at his command.
3
He speaks, and tempest, hail and wind,
Lay the wide forest bare around;
The fearful heart and frighted hind,
Leap at the terror of the sound.
4
To Lebanon he turns his voice,
And lo, the stately cedars break:
The mountains tremble at the noise,
The valleys roar the deserts quake.
5
The Lord sits sovereign on the flood,
The thunderer reigns forever king;
But makes his church his blessed abode,
Where we his awful glories sing.
6
In gentler language, there the Lord
The counsel of his grace imparts:
Amidst the raging storm, his word
Speaks peace and courage to our hearts.

Sing to the Lord, ye saints, and prove
How large his grace, how kind his love,
Let all your powers rejoice, and trace
The wondrous records of his grace.

His anger but a moment stays;
His lo^^ is life and length of days:
Though grief and tears the night employ,
The morning (...) restores the joy.
PSALM XXX. ver. 6. Second Part. Long Meter. Health, Sickness, and Recovery.
1
FIRM was my health, my day was bright,
And I ^^^sum'd 'twould never be night
Fondly I said within my heart,
"Pleasure and peace shall never depart.
2
But I forgot thine arm was strong,
Which made my mountain stand so long;
Soon as thy face began to hide,
My health was gone, my comforts died.
3
I cried aloud to thee my God;
"What can thou profit by my blood?
"Deep in the dust can I declare
"Thy truth, or sing thy goodness there?
4
"Hear me, O God of grace, I said,
"And bring me from among the dead:"
Thy word rebuked the pains I felt,
Thy pardoning love removed my guilt.
5
My groans, and tears, and forms of woe,
Are turned to joy and praises now;
I throw my sackcloth on the ground,
And ease and gladness gird me round.
6
My tongue, the glory of my frame,
Shall never be silent of thy name;
Thy praise shall sound through earth and heaven,
For sickness healed, and sins forgiven.

Death.
1
TO thee, O GOD of truth and love
My spirit I commit;
Thou have redeemed my soul from death,
And saved me from the pit.
2
Despair and comfort, hope and fear
Maintained a doubtful strife;
While sorrow, pain, and sin conspired
To take away my life.
3
" My time is in thy hand, I cried,
"Though I draw near the dust*
Thou art the refuge where I hide,
The GOD in whom I trust.
4
Oh make thy reconciled face
Upon thy servant shine,
And save me for thy mercy's sake,
For I Am entirely thine.
PAUSE.

5
'Twas in my haste, my spirit said,
"I must despair and die,
"I am cut off before thine eyes;
But thou have heard my cry.
6
Thy goodness how divinely free!
How sweet thy smiling face,
To those that fear thy majesty,
And trust thy promised grace.
7
Oh love the Lord, all ye his saints,
And sing his praises loud;
He Will bend his ear to your complaints,
And recompense the proud.
PSALM XXXI.7, -- 33, 11, -- 21. Second Part. Common Meter. Deliverance from
Slander and Reproach.
1
MY heart rejoices in thy name,
My GOD, my heavenly trust;
Thou have preserved my face from shame,
Mine honor from the dust.
2
"My life is spent with grief, I cried,
"My years consumed in groans,
"My strength decays, mine eyes are dried,
"And sorrow wastes my bones.
3
Among mine enemies my name
A proverb vile was grown,
While to my neighbors I became
Forgotten and unknown.
4
Slander and fear on every side,
Seized and beset me round,
I to thy throne of grace applied,
And speedy rescue found.
PAUSE.

5
How great deliverance thou have wrought
Before the sons of men!
The lying lips to silence brought,
And made their boasting vain!
6
Thy children from the strife of tongues
Shall thy pavilion hide,
Guard them from infamy and wrongs,
And crush the sons of pride.
7
Within thy secret presence, Lord,
Let me for ever dwell;
No fenced city walled and barred
Secures a saint so well.
PSALM XXXII. Short Meter. Forgiveness of Sins upon Confession.
1
OH blessed souls are they
Whose sins are covered over!
Divinely blessed, to whom the Lord
Imputes their guilt no more.
2
They mourn their follies past,
And keep their hearts with care;
Their lips and lives without deceit
Shall prove their faith sincere.
While I concealed my guilt,
I felt the festering wound,
Till I confessed my sins to thee,
And ready pardon found.
4
Let sinners learn to pray,
Let saints keep near the throne;
Our help in times of deep distress
Is found in GOD alone.
PSALM XXXII. Common Meter. Free Pardon and sincere Obedience; or, Confession
(...) Forgiveness.
1
HOW blessed the man to whom his GOD
No more imputes his sin,
But washed in the Redeemer's blood
Has made his garments clean!

And blessed beyond expression he,
Whose debts are thus discharged;
While from the guilty bondage free
He feels his soul enlarged.
3
His spirit hates deceit and lies,
His words are all sincere:
He guards his heart, he guards his eyes,
To keep his conscience clear.
4
While I my inward guilt suppressed,
No quiet could I find;
Thy wrath lay burning in my breast,
And racked my tortured mind.
5
Then I confessed my troubled thoughts*
My secret sins revealed,
Thy pardoning grace forgave my faults*
Thy grace my pardon sealed.
6
This shall invite thy saints to pray;
When like a raging flood
Temptations rise, our strength and stay
Is a forgiving GOD.

Justification and Sanctification.
1
BLESSED is the man, forever blessed,
Whose guilt is pardoned by his GOD,
Whose sins with sorrow are confessed,
And covered with his Savior's blood.
2
Before his judgment seat the Lord
No more permits his crimes to rise;
He pleads no merit of reward,
And not on works but grace relies.
3
From guile his heart and lips are free,
His humble joy, his holy fear,
With deep repentance well agree,
And join to prove his faith sincere.
4
How glorious is that righteousness
That hides and cancels all his sins!
While a bright evidence of grace
Through all his life appears and shines.
PSALM XXXII. Second Part. Long Meter. A guilty Conscience eased by Confession
and Pardon.
1
WHILE I keep silence and conceal
My heavy guilt within my heart,
What torments does my conscience feel!
What agonies of inward smart!
2
I spread my sins before the Lord,
And all my secret faults confess;
Thy Gospel speaks a pardoning word,
Thine holy spirit seals the grace.
3
For this shall every humble soul
Make swift addresses to thy seat:
When floods of huge temptations roll,
There shall they find a blessed retreat.
4
How safe beneath thy wings I lie,
When days grow dark, and storms appear?
And when I walk, thy watchful eye
Shall guide me safe from every snare.

Let heaven and earth proclaim;
His works of nature and of grace
Reveal his wondrous name.
3
His word, with energy divine,
Those heavenly arches spread,
Bade starry hosts around them shine,
And light the heavens pervade.
4
He taught the swelling waves to flow
To their appointed deep;
Bade raging seas their limits know,
And still their station keep.
5
Ye tenants of the spacious earth,
With fear before him stand;
He spoke, and nature took its birth,
And rests on his command.
6
He scorns the angry nations' rage,
And breaks their vain designs;
His counsel stands through every age,
And in full glory shines.
PSALM. XXXIII. Second Part. Common Meter. Creatures vain, and GOD
All-sufficient.
1
BLESSED is the nation, where the Lord
Has fixed his gracious throne;
Where he reveals his heavenly word,
And calls their tribes his own.
2
His eye, with infinite survey,
Does the whole world behold;
He formed us all of equal clay,
And knows our feeble mould.
3
Kings are not rescued by the force
Of armies from the grave;
Nor speed nor courage of an horse
Can his bold rider save.
4
Vain is the strength of beasts or men,
Nor springs our safety thence;
But holy souls from GOD obtain
A strong and sure defense.
5
GOD is their fear, and GOD their trust:
When plagues or famine sp^^ad,
His watchful eye secures the just,
Among ten thousand dead.
6
Lord, let our hearts in thee rejoice,
And bless us from thy throne;
For we have made thy word our choice,
And trust thy grace alone.

How wise and holy, just and true!
2
Behold, to earth's remotest ends,
His goodness flows, his truth extends;
His power the heavenly arches spread;
His word, with energy divine,
Bade starry hosts around them shine,
And light the circling heavens pervade.
3
His hand collects the flowing seas;
Those watery treasures know their place,
And fill the storehouse of the deep:
He spoke, and gave all nature birth;
And fires and seas, and heaven and earth,
His everlasting orders keep.
4
Let mortals tremble and adore
A GOD of such resistless power,
Nor dare indulge their feeble rage:
Vain are your thoughts, and weak your hands,
But his eternal counsel stands,
And rules the world from age to age.
PSALM XXXIII. As the 113th Psalm. Second Part. Creatures vain, and GOD
All-sufficient.
1
OH happy nation, where the Lord
Reveals the treasure of his word,
And builds his church, his earthly throne!
His eye the heathen world surveys,
He formed their hearts, he knows their ways,
But God their maker is unknown.
2
Let Kings rely upon their host,
And of his strength the champion boast;
In vain they boast* in vain rely;
In vain we trust the brutal force,
Or speed or courage of an horse,
To guard his rider, or to fly.
3
The arm of our almighty Lord,
Does more secure defense afford,
When deaths or dangers threatening stand:
Thy watchful eye preserves the just,
Who make thy name their fear and trust,
When wars or famine waste the land.
4
In sickness or the bloody field,
Our great physician and our shield,
Shall send salvation from his throne;
We wait to see thy goodness shine;
Let us rejoice in help divine,
For all our hope is GOD alone.

2
Come, magnify the Lord with me,
Let every heart exalt his name;
I sought the eternal GOD, and he
Has not exposed my hope to shame.
3
I told him all my secret grief,
My secret groaning reached his ears;
He gave my inward pains relief,
And calmed the tumult of my fears.
4
To him the poor lift up their eyes,
With heavenly joy their faces shine,
A beam of mercy from the skies
Fills them with light and love divine.
5
His holy Angels pitch their tents
Around the men that serve the Lord;
Oh fear and love him, all his saints,
Taste of his grace, and trust his word.
6
The wild young lions, pinched with pain
And hanger, roar through all the wood;
But none shall seek the Lord in vain,
Nor want supplies of real good.

And peace to crown your mortal state,
Restrain your feet from impious ways,
Your lips from slander and deceit.
3
The eyes of GOD regard his saints,
His ears are open to their cries;
He sets his frowning face against
The sons of violence and lies.
4
To humble souls and broken hearts
GOD with his grace is ever nigh;
Pardon and hope his love imparts
When men in deep contrition lie.
5
He tells their tears, he counts their groans,
His Son redeems their souls from death;
His spirit heals their broken bones,
His praise employs their tuneful breath.
PSALM XXXIV.1, -- 10. First Part. Common Meter. Prayer and Praise for eminent
Deliverance.

I WILL bless the Lord from day to day;

Ye humble souls that use to pray,
Come, help my lips to praise.
2
Sing to the honor of his name,
How a poor sufferer cried,
Nor was his hope exposed to shame,
Nor was his suit denied.
3
When threatening sorrows round me stood,
And endless fears arose,
Like the loud billows of a flood,
Redoubling all my woes.
4
I told the Lord my sore distress,
With heavy groans and tears;
He gave my sharpest torments ease,
And silenced all my fears.
PAUSE.

5
[Oh sinners, come and taste his love,
Come, learn his pleasant ways,
And let your own experience prove
The sweetness of his grace.
6
He bids his angels pitch their tents
Round where his children dwell;
What ills their heavenly care prevents
No earthly tongue can tell.]
^
[Oh love the Lord, ye saints of his;
His eye regards the just,
How richly blessed their portion is,
Who make the Lord their trust!
^
Young lions pinched with hunger roar,
And famish in the wood:
But GOD supplies his holy poor
With every needful good.]
PSALM XXXIV.11, -- 22. Second Part. Common Meter. Exhortation to Peace and
Holiness.
^
COME, children, learn to fear the Lord,
And that your days be long,
Let not a false or spiteful word
Be found upon your tongue.
^
Depart from mischief, practice love,
Pursue the works of peace;
So shall the Lord your ways approve,
And set your souls at ease,
^
His eyes awake to guard the just,
His ears attend their cry;
When broken spirits dwell in dust,
The GOD of grace is nigh.
^
What though the sorrows here they taste
Are sharp and tedious too,
The Lord who saves them all at last,
Is their supporter now.
^
Evil shall smite the wicked dead;
But GOD secures his own,
Prevents the mischief when they slide,
Or heals the broken bone.
6
When desolation like a flood
Over the proud sinner rolls,
Saints find a refuge in their GOD,
For he redeemed their souls.
PSALM XXXV. Ver. 12, 13, 14. Love to Enemies; or, the Love of Christ to
Sinners typified in David
1
BEHOLD the love, the generous love
That holy David shows;
Behold his kind compassion move
For his afflicted foes!
2
When they are sick, his soul complains,
And seems to feel the smart;
The spirit of the gospel reigns,
And melts his pious heart.
3
How did his flowing tears condo^^.
As for a brother dead!
And fasting mortified his soul,
While for their life be prayed.
4
They groaned, and cursed him on their bed,
Yet still he pleads and mourns;
And double blessings on his head
The righteous GOD returns.
5
Oh glorious type of heavenly grace!
Thus Christ the Lord appears;
While sinners curse, the Savior prays,
And pities them with tears.
6
He, the true David, Israel's king,
Blessed and beloved of GOD,
To save us rebels dead in sin
Paid his own dearest blood.

Thy providence is kind and large,
Both man and beast thy bounty share;
The whole creation is thy charge,
But saints are thy peculiar care.

Whence all our hope and comfort springs;
The sons of Adam in distress
Fly to the shadow of thy wings.

From the provisions of thy house
We shall be fed with sweet repast

Life, like a fountain rich and free,

Being and Attributes of GOD asserted.
1
WHILE men grow bold in wicked ways,
And yet a GOD they own,
My heart within me often says,
"Their thoughts believe their's none.
2
Their thoughts and ways at once declare
(What ever their lips profess)
GOD has no wrath for them to fear,
Nor will they seek his Grace.
3
What strange self-flattery blinds their eyes!
But there is a hastening hour,
When they shall see with sore surprise
The terrors of thy power.
4
Thy justice shall maintain its throne,
Though mountains melt away;
Thy judgments are a world unknown,
A deep, unfathomed sea.
5
Above these heavens' created rounds,
Thy mercies, Lord, extend;
Thy truth out-lives the narrow bounds,
Where time and nature end.
6
Safety to man thy goodness brings,
Nor overlooks the beast;
Beneath the shadow of thy wings
Thy children choose to rest.
7
[From thee, when creature-streams run low,
And mortal comforts die.
Perpetual springs of life shall flow,
And raise our pleasures high.
8
Though all created light decay,
And death close up our eyes,
Thy presence makes eternal day
Where clouds can never rise.]
PSALM XXXVI.1 -- 7. Short Meter. The Wickedness of Man, and the Majesty of
GOD; a Practical Atheism exposed.
1
WHEN man grow bold in sin,
My heart within me cries,
"He has no faith of GOD within,
"Nor fear before his eyes.
2
[He walks a while concealed
In a self-flattering dream,
'Till his dark crimes, at once revealed,
Expose his hateful name.]
3
His heart is false and soul,
His words are smooth and fair;
Wisdom is banished from his soul,
And leaves no goodness there.
4
He plots upon his bed
New mischiefs to fulfill;
He sets his heart, and hand, and head
To practice all that is ill.
5
But there is a dreadful GOD,
Though men renounce his fear;
His justice, hid behind the cloud,
Shall one great day appear.
6
His truth transcends the sky,
In heaven his mercies dwell;
Deep as the sea his judgments lie,
His anger burns to hell.
7
How excellent his love,
Whence all our safety springs!
Oh never let my soul remove
From underneath his wings.
PSALM XXXVII.1 -- 15. First Part. The Cure of Envy, Fretfulness, and Unbelief;
or, The Rewards of the Righteous and the Wicked.
1
WHY should I vex my soul, and fret
To see the wicked rise?
Or envy sinners waxing great,
By violence and lies?
2
As flowery grass cut down at noon,
Before the evening fades,
So shall their glories vanish soon,
In everlasting shades.
3
Then let me make the Lord my trust,
And practice all that is good;
So shall I dwell among the just,
And He provide me Food.
4
I to my GOD my ways commit,
And cheerful wait his will;
Thy hand, which guides my doubtful feet,
Shall my desires fulfill.
5
Mine innocence shall thou display,
And make thy judgments known,
Fair as the light of dawning day,
And glorious as the noon.
6
The meek at last the earth possess,
And are the heirs of heaven;
True riches, with abundant peace,
To humble souls are given.
PAUSE.

7
Rest in the Lord, and keep his way,
Nor let your anger rise,
Though providence should long delay.
To punish haughty vice.
8
Let sinners join to break your peace,
And plot, and rage, and foam;
The Lord derides them, for he sees
Their day of vengeance come.
9
They have drawn out the threatening sword,
Have bent the murderous bow,
To slay the men that fear the Lord,
And bring the righteous low.
10
My GOD shall break their bows, and burn
Their persecuting darts,
Shall their own swords against them turn,
And pierce their stubborn hearts.
PSALM XXXVII.16, 21, 25 -- 31. Second Part. Charity to the poor; or Religion
in Words and Deeds.
1
WHY do the wealthy wicked boast,
And grow profanely bold?
The meanest portion of the just
Excels the sinners gold.
2
The wicked borrows of his friends,
But never designs to pay;
The saint is merciful and lends,
Nor turns the poor away.
3
His alms with liberal heart he gives
Amongst the sons of need;
His m^^n^^y to long ages lives,
And blessed is his seed.
4
His lips abhor ^^^^k profane,
To slander or defraud;
His ready tongue declares to men
What he has learned of GOD.
5
The law and gospel of the Lord
Deep in his heart abide;
Led by the spirit and the word
His feet shall never slide.
6
When Sinners fall, the righteous stand,
Preserved from every snare;
They shall possess the promised land,
And dwell forever there.
PSALM XXXVII. Ver. 23 -- 37. Third Part. The Way and End of the Righteous and
the Wicked.
1
MY GOD, the steps of pious men
Are ordered by thy will:
Though they should fall, they riase again,
Thy Hand supports them still.
2
The Lord delights to see their ways,
Their virtue he approve;:
He Will never deprive them of his grace,
Nor leave the men he loves.
3
The heavenly heritage is theirs,
Their portion and their home;
He feasts them now, and makes them heirs
Of blessings long to come.
4
Wait on the Lord, ye sons of men,
Nor fear when tyrants frown;
Ye shall confess their pride was vain,
When justice casts them down.
PAUSE.

5
The haughty sinner have I seen
Not fearing man nor GOD,
Like a tall bay tree fair and green,
Spreading his arms abroad.
6
And lo, he vanished from the ground,
Destroyed by hands unseen;
Nor root, nor branch, nor leaf was found
Where all that pride had been.
7
But mark the man of righteousness,
His several steps attend;
True pleasure runs through all his ways,
And peaceful is his end.
PSALM XXXVIII. Guilt of Conscience and Relief; or Repentance and Prayer for
Pardon and Health. Com. Meter.
1
AMIDST thy wrath remember love,
Restore thy servant, Lord,
Nor let a Father's chastening prove
Like an avenger's sword.
2
Thine arrows stick within my heart,
My flesh is sorely pressed;
Between the sorrow and the smart
My spirit finds no rest.
3
My sins a heavy load appear,
And over my head are gone;
Too heavy they for me to bear,
Too hard for me to atone.
4
My thoughts are like a troubled sea
That sinks my comforts down;
And I go mourning all the day
Beneath my Father's frown.
5
Lord I am weakened and dismayed,
None of my powers are whole;
My wounds with piercing anguish bleed,
The anguish of my soul.
6
All my desires to thee are known,
Thine eye counts every tear,
And every sigh and every groan
Is notic'd by thine ear.
7
Thou are my GOD, my only hope;
My GOD will hear my cry,
My GOD will bear my spirit up
When Satan bids me die.
8
My foes rejoice whenever I slide,
To see my virtue fail;
They raise their pleasure and their pride,
Whenever their wiles prevail.
9
But I Will confess my guilty ways,
And grieve for all my sin;
I Will mourn how weak the seeds of grace,
And beg support divine.
10
My GOD, forgive my follies past*
And be forever nigh;
O Lord of my salvation haste;
Before thy servant die.
PSALM XXXIX, 1, 2, 3. First Part. Common Meter. Watchfulness over the Tongue;
or Prudence and Zeal.
1
THUS I resolved before the Lord,
"Now will I watch my tongue,
"Lest I let slip one sinful word,
"Or do my neighbor wrong.
2
When'er constrained a while to stay
With men of lives profane,
I Will set a double guard that day,
Nor let my talk be vain.
3
I Will scarce allow my lips to speak
The pious thoughts I feel,
Left scoffers should the occasion take
To mock my holy zeal.
4
Yet if some proper hour appear,
I Will not be overaw'd,
But let the scoffing sinners hear
That we can speak for GOD.
PSALM XXXIX.4, 5, 6, 7. Second Part, The vanity of Man as mortal.
TEACH me the measure of my days,
Thou maker of my frame;
I would survey life's narrow space,
And learn how frail I am.
2
A span is all that we can boast.
An inch or two of time;
Man is but vanity and dust
In all his flower and prime.
3
See the vain race of mortals move
Like shadows over the plain;
They rage and strive, desire and love,
But all the noise is vain.
4
Some walk in honor's gaudy show,
Some dig for golden ore,
They toil for heirs, they know not who,
And strait are seen no more.
5
What should I wish or wait for then
From creatures, earth and dust?
They make our expectations vain,
And disappoint our trust.
6
How I forbid my carnal hope
My fond desires recall;
I give my mortal interest up,
And make my GOD my all.
PSALM XXXIX. Ver. 9. -- 13. Third Part. Sickbed Devotion; or Pleading without
Repining.
1
GOD of my life, look gently down,
Behold the pains I feel;
But I am dumb before thy throne,
Nor dare dispute thy will.
2
Diseases are thy servants, Lord,
They come at thy command;
I Will not attempt a murmuring word,
Against thy chastening hand.
3
Yet I may plead with humble cries,
Remove thy sharp rebukes:
My strength consumes, my spirit dies,
Through thy repeated strokes.
4
Crushed as a moth beneath thy hand,
We moulder to the dust;
Our feeble powers can never withstand,
And all our beauty's lost.
5
I Am but a stranger here below,
As all my fathers were;
May I be well prepared to go,
When I thy summons hear!
6
But if my life be spared a while
Before my last remove,
Thy praise shall be my business still,
And I Will declare thy love.
PSALM XL. Ver. 1, 2, 3, 5, 17. First Part. Common Meter. A Song of Deliverance
from great Distress.
1
I Waited patient for the Lord,
He bowed to hear my cry;
He saw me resting on his word,
And brought salvation nigh.
2
He raised me from a horrid pit,
Where mourning long I lay,
And from my bonds released my feet,
Deep bonds of mirey clay.
3
Firm on a rock he, made me stand,
And taught my cheerful tongue
To praise the wonders of his hand,
In a new thankful song.
4
I Will spread his works of grace abroad;
The saints with joy shall hear.
And sinners learn to make my GOD
Their only hope and fear,
5
How many are thy thoughts of love;
Thy mercies, Lord, how great!
We have nor words nor hours enough
Their numbers to repeat,
6
When I Am afflicted, poor and low,
And light and peace depart,
My GOD beholds my heavy woe,
And bears me on his heart.
PSALM XL.6. -- 9. Second Part. Com. Meter. The Incarnation and Sacrifice of
Christ.
1
THUS says the Lord, "your work is vain,
"Give your burnt-offerings over,
"In dying goats and bullocks sla^n
"My soul delights no more."
2
The^ ^^^ke the Savior, "Lo, I Am here,
"My GOD, to do thy will;
"What e'erthy (...) books declare
"Thy servant shall fulfill.
3
"Thy law is ever in my sight,
"I keep it near my heart:
"Mine eyes are opened with delight
"To what thy lips impart."
4
And see the blessed Redeemer comes,
The eternal Son appears,
And at the appointed time assumes
The body GOD prepares.
5
Much he revealed his Father's grace,
And much his truth he showed,
And preached the way of righteousness
Where great assemblies stood.
6
His Father's honor touched his heart.
He pitied sinners' cries,
And to fulfill a Savior's part
Was made a sacrifice.
PAUSE.

7
No blood of beasts on altars shed
Could wash the conscience clean,
But the rich sacrifice he paid
Atones for all our sin.
8
Then was the great salvation spread,
And Satan's kingdom shook;
Thus by the woman's promised seed
The Serpent's head was broke.
PSALM XL.5 -- 10- Long Meter, Christ our Sacrifice.
THE wonders, Lord, thy Love has wrought,
Exceed our praise, surmount our thought;
Should I attempt the long detail,
My speech would faint, my numbers fail.
2
No blood of beasts on altars spilt,
Can cleanse the souls of men from guilt;
But thou have set before our eyes
An all-sufficient sacrifice.
3
Lo thine eternal Son appears,
To thy designs he bows his ears;
Assumes a body well prepared,
And well performs a work so hard.
4
"Behold I come (the Savior cries,
"With love and duty in his eyes,)
"I come to bear the heavy load
"Of sins, and do thy will, my GOD.
5
"'It Is written in thy great decree,
"'It Is in thy book foretold of me,
"I must fulfill the Savior's part.
"And lo! thy law is in my heart.
6
"I Will magnify thy holy law,
"And rebels, to obedience draw,
"When on my cross I Am lifted high,
"Or to my crown above the sky.
7
"The spirit shall descend and show
"What thou have done and what I do;
"The wondering world shall learn thy grace,
"And all creation tune thy praise.
PSALM XLI.1, 2, 3. Charity to the Poor; or Pity to the Afflicted.
1
BLESSED is the man, whose breast can move,
And melt with pity to the poor,
Whose soul, by sympathizing love,
Feels what his fellow-saints endure.
2
His heart contrives for their relief
More good than his own hands can do;
He in the time of general grief
Shall find the Lord has mercy too,
3
His soul shall live secure on earth,
With secret blessings on his head,
When drought, and pestilence, and dearth,
Around him multiply their dead.
4
Or if he languish on his couch
GOD will pronounce his sins forgiven,
Will save him with a healing touch,
Or take his willing soul to heaven.
PSALM XLII.1 -- 9. First Part. Desertion and Hope; or, Complaint of Absence
from Public Worship.
1
WITH earnest longings of the mind,
My God, to thee I look;
So pants the hunted heart to find,
And taste the cooling brook.
2
When shall I see thy courts of grace,
And meet my God again?
So long an absence from thy face
My heart endures with pain.
3
Temptations vex my weary soul,
And tears are my repast;
The foe insults without control,
"And where is your God at last?
4
It Is with a mournful pleasure now
I think on ancient days:
Then to thy house did numbers go,
And all our work was praise.
5
But why, my soul, sink down so far
Beneath this heavy load?
My spirit, why indulge despair,
And sin against my GOD?
6
Hope in the Lord, whose mighty hand
Can all thy woes remove;
For I shall yet before him stand,
And sing restoring love.
PSALM XLII 6 -- 11. Second Part. Melancholy Thoughts reproved; or, Hope in
Affliction
^
MY spirit sinks within me, Lord,
But I will call thy name to mind,
And times of pass distress record,
When I have found my GOD was kind.
2
Huge troubles with tumultuous noise
Swell like a sea, and round me spread,
The rising waves drown all my joys,
And roll tremendous over my head.
3
Yet will the Lord command his love,
When I address his throne by day,
Nor in the night his grace remove;
The night shall hear me sing and pray.
4
I Will cast my self before his feet,
And say, "my GOD, my heavenly rock,
"Why does thy love so long forget
"The soul that groans beneath thy stroke?
5
I Will chide my heart that sinks so low,
Why should my soul indulge her grief;
Hope in the Lord, and praise him too;
He is my rest, my sure relief.
6
My GOD, my most exceeding joy.
Thy light and truth shall guide me still,
Thy word shall my best thoughts employ,
And lead me to thine heavenly hill.
PSALM XLIII. Common Meter. Safety in Divine Protection.
1
JUDGE me, O GOD, and plead my cause,
Against a sinful race;
From vile oppression and deceit
Secure me by thy grace.
2
On thee my steadfast hope depends,
And am I left to mourn?
To sink in sorrows, and in vain,
Implore thy kind return?
3
Oh send thy light to guide my feet,
And bid thy truth appear,
Conduct me to thy holy hill,
To taste thy mercies there.
4
Then to thy altar, oh my GOD,
My joyful feet shall rise,
And my triumphant songs shall praise,
The GOD that rules the skies.
5
Sink not, my soul, beneath thy fear,
Nor yield to weak despair;
For I shall live to praise the LORD,
And bless his guardian care.
PSALM XLIV. Ver. 1, 2, 3, 8, 15, 26. The Church's Complaint in Persecution.
1
LORD, we have heard thy works of old,
Thy works of power and grace,
When to our ears our fathers told,
The wonders of their days.
2
They saw thy beauteous churches rise,
The spreading gospel run;
While light and glory from the skies
Through all their temples shone.
3
In GOD they boasted all the day,
And in a cheerful throng
Did thousands meet to praise and pray,
And garce was all their song.
4
But now our souls are seized with shame,
Confusion fills our face,
To hear the enemy blaspheme,
And fools reproach thy grace.
5
Yet have we not forgot our God,
Nor falsely dealt with heaven,
Nor have our steps declined the road
Of duty thou have given.
6
Though dragons all around us roar
With their destructive breath,
And thine own hand has bruised us sore
Hard by the gates of Death.
PAUSE.

7
We are exposed all day to die,
As martyrs for thy name;
As sheep for slaughter bound we lie,
And wait the kindling flame.
8
Awake, arise, Almighty Lord,
Why sleeps thy wonted Grace?
Why should we seem like men abhorred,
Or banished from thy face?
9
Will thou forever cast us off,
And still neglect our cries?
Forever hide thine heavenly love
From our afflicted eyes?
10
Down to the dust our soul is bowed,
And dies upon the ground;
Rise for our help, rebuke the proud,
And all their powers confound.
11
Redeem us from perpetual shame,
Our Savior and our GOD;
We plead the honors of thy name,
The merits of thy blood.
PSALM XLV. Short Meter. The Glory of CHRIST. The success of the Gospel, and
the Gentile Church.
1
MY Savior and my King,
Thy beauties are divine;
Thy lips with blessings overflow,
And every grace is thine.
2
Now make thy glory known,
Gird on thy dreadful sword,
And rise in majesty to spread
The Conquests of thy word.
3
Strike through thy stubborn foes,
Or make their hearts obey,
While justice, meekness, grace and truth
Attend thy glorious way.
4
Thy laws, O GOD, are right,
Thy throne shall ever stand;
And thy victorious gospel prove
A scepter in thy hand.
5
[Thy Father and thy GOD
Has without measure shed
His spirit like a grateful oil
TO anoint thy sacred head.]
6
[Behold, at thy right hand
The Gentile church is seen,
A beauteous bride in rich attire,
And princes guard the Queen.]
7
Fair bride, receive his love,
Forget thy father's house,
Forsake thy gods, thy idol gods,
And pay thy Lord thy vows.
8
Oh let thy GOD and King
Thy sweetest thoughts employ;
Thy children shall his honor sing
And taste the heavenly joy.
PSALM XLV. Common Meter. The Personal Glories and Government of Christ.
1
I WILL speak the honors of my King,
His form divinely fair;
None of the sons of mortal race
May with the Lord compare.
2
Sweet is thy speech, and heavenly grace
Upon thy lips is shed;
Thy GOD with blessings infinite
Has crowned thy sacred head.
3
Gird on thy sword, victorious prince,
Ride with majestic sway;
Thy terror shall strike through thy foes,
And make the world obey.
4
Thy throne, O GOD, forever stands,
Thy word of grace shall prove
A peaceful scepter in thy hands,
To rule thy saints by love.
5
Justice and truth attend thee still,
But mercy is thy choice:
And GOD, thy GOD thy soul shall fill
With most peculiar joys.
PSALM XLV. First Part. Long Meter The Glory of Christ, and Power of his Gospel.
1
NOW be my heart inspired to sing
The glories of my Savior King,
Jesus the Lord; how heavenly fair
His form! how bright his beauties are!
2
Over all the sons of human race
He shines with far superior grace,
Love from his lips divinely flows,
And blessings all his state compose.
3
Dress thee in arms, most mighty Lord,
Gird on the terror of thy sword,
In majesty and glory ride
With truth and meekness at thy side.
4
Thine anger, like a pointed dart,
Shall pierce the foes of stubborn heart;
Or words of mercy kind and sweet
Shall melt the rebels at thy feet.
5
Thy throne, O God, for ever stands,
Grace is the scepter in thy hands;
Thy laws and works are just and right,
But grace and justice thy delight.
6
GOD, thine own God has richly shed
His oil of gladness on thy head;
And with his sacred spirit blessed
His first born Son above the rest.
PSALM XLV. Second Part. Long Meter. Christ and his Church; or, The Mystical
marriage.
1
THE King of saints, how fair his face,
Adorned with majesty and grace!
He comes with blessings from above,
And wins the nations to his love.
2
At his right hand our eyes behold
The queen arrayed in purest gold;
The world admires her heavenly dress;
Her robes of joy and righteousness.
3
He forms her beauties like his own,
He calls and seats her near his throne;
Fair stranger, let thine heart forget
The idols of thy native state.
4
So shall the king the more rejoice
In thee the favorite of his choice;
Let him be loved, and yet adored,
For he is thy Maker and thy Lord.
5
Oh happy hour, when thou shall rise
To his fair palace in the skies,
And all thy sons (a numerous train)
Each like a prince in glory reign.
6
Let endless honors crown his head;
Let every age his praises spread;
While we with cheerful songs approve
The condescension of his love.
PSALM XLVI. First Part. The Church's Safety and Triumph among National
Desolations.
1
GOD is the refuge of his saints,
When storms of sharp distress invade;
Ere we can offer our complaints
Behold him present with his aid.
2
Let mountains from their seats be hurled
Down to the deep, and buried there,
Convulsions shake the solid world,
Our faith shall never yield to fear.
3
Loud may the troubled ocean roar,
In sacred peace our souls abide,
While every nation, every shore
Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide.
4
There is a stream whose gentle flow
Supplies the city of our GOD!
Life, love and joy still gliding through
And watering our divine abode.
5
That sacred stream, thine holy word,
Supports our faith, our f^ar controuls,
Sweet peace thy promises afford,
And give new strength to fainting souls.
6
Sion enjoys her monarch's Love,
Secure against a threatening hour;
Nor can her firm foundation move,
Built on his truth, and armed with power.
PSALM XLVI. Second Part. GOD fights for his Church.
1
LET Sion in her king rejoice,
Though tyrants rage, and kingdoms rise;
He utters his almighty voice,
The nations melt, the tumult dies
2
The LORD of old for Jacob fought,
And Jacob's GOD is still our aid;
Behold the works his hand has wrought,
What desolations he has made.
3
From sea to sea, through all the shores
He makes the noise of battle cease;
When from on high his thunder roars,
He awes the trembling world to peace.
4
He breaks the bow, he cuts the spear,
Chariots he burns with heavenly flame;
Let earth in silent wonder hear
The sound and glory of his name.
5
"Be still, and learn that I am GOD,
"I reign exalted over the lands,
"I will be known and feared abroad,
"But still my throne in Sion stands.
6
O Lord of hosts, Almighty king,
While we so near thy presence dwell,
Our faith shall sit secure, and sing,
Nor fear the raging powers of hell.
PSALM XLVII. Christ Ascending and Reigning.
1
OH For a shout of sacred joy
To GOD the sovereign king!
Let every land their tongues employ,
And hymns of triumph sing.
2
Jesus our GOD ascends on high;
His heavenly guards around
Attend him rising through the sky,
With trumpet's joyful sound.
3
While angels shout and praise their king,
Let mortals learn their strains;
Let all the earth his honors sing;
Over all the earth he reigns.
4
Rehearse his praise with awe profound,
Let knowledge guide the song;
Nor mock him with a solemn sound
Upon a thoughtless tongue.
5
In Israel stood his ancient throne,
He loved that chosen race;
But now he calls the world his own,
And heathens taste his gra^^.
6
The Gentile nations are the Lord's,
There Abraham's GOD is known;
While powers and princes, shields and swords
Submit before his throne.
PSALM XLVIII.1, -- 8. First Part. The Church is the Honor and Safety of a
Nation.
1
[GREAT is the Lord our GOD,
And let his praise be great;
He makes his churches his abode,
His most delightful seat.
2
These temples of his grace,
How beautiful they stand?
The honors of our native place,
And bulwarks of our land.]
3
In Sion GOD is known
A refuge in distress;
How bright has his salvation shone,
How fair his heavenly grace?
4
When kings against her joined,
And saw the Lord was there,
In wild confusion of the mind
They fled with hasty fear.
5
When navies tall and proud
Attempt to spoil our peace,
He sends his tempest roaring loud,
And sinks them in the seas.
6
Often have our fathers told,
Our eyes have often seen,
How well our GOD secures the fold
Where his own flocks have been.
7
In every new distress
We'll to his house repair,
Recall to mind his wondrous grace,
And seek deliverance there.
PSALM XLVIII 10, -- 14. Second Part. The Beauty of the Church; or, Gospel
Worship and Order.
1
FAR as thy name is known
The world declares thy praise;
Thy saints, O Lord, before thy throne
Their songs of honor raise.
2
With joy thy people stand
On Sion's chosen hill,
Proclaim the wonders of thy hand,
And counsels of thy will.
3
Let strangers walk around
The city where we dwell,
Compass and view thine holy ground,
And mark the building well.
4
The orders of thy house,
The worship of thy court,
The cheerful songs, the solemn vows,
And make a fair report.
5
How decent and how wise!
How glorious to behold!
Beyond the pomp that charms the eyes,
And rites adorned with gold.
6
The GOD we worship now
Will guide us 'till we die;
Will be your GOD while here below,
And ours above the sky,
PSALM XLIX.6 -- 14. First Part Com. Meter. Pride and Death; or, The Vanity of
Life and Riches.
1
WHY does the man of riches grow
To insolence and pride,
To see his wealth and honors flow
With every rising tide?
2
[Why does he treat the poor with scorn,
Made of the self-same clay,
And boast as though his flesh were born
Of better dust than they?]
3
Not all his treasures can procure
His soul a short reprieve,
Redeem from death one guilty hour,
Or make his brother live.
4
Eternal life can never be sold,
The ransom is too high;
Justice will never be bribed with gold,
That man may never die.]
5
He sees the brutish and the wise,
The timorous and the brave
Quit their possessions, close their eyes,
And hasten to the grave.
6
Yet it is his inward thought and pride,
"My house shall ever stand;
"And that my name may long abide
"I Will give it to my land.
7
Vain are his thoughts, his hopes are lost,
How soon his memory dies!
His name is buried in the dust,
Where his own body lies.]
PAUSE.

8
This is the folly of their way;
And yet their sons as vain
Approve the words their fathers say,
And act their works again.
9
Men void of wisdom and of grace,
Though honor raise them high,
Live like the beast, a thoughtless race,
And like the beast they die.
10
[Laid in the grave like silly sheep,
Death triumphs over them there,
Till the last trumpet breaks their sleep,
And wakes them in despair.
PSALM XLIX. Ver. 14, 15. Second Part. Common Meter. Death and the Resurrection.
^
YE sons of pride, that hate the just,
And trample on the poor,
When death has brought you down to dust
Your pomp shall rise no more.

The last great day shall change the scene;
When will that hour appear?
When shall the just revive, and reign
Over all that scorned them here?
^
GOD will my naked soul receive,
Called from the world away,
And break the prison of the grave,
To raise my mouldering clay.
^
Heaven is my everlasting home,
The inheritance is sure;
Let men of pride their rage resume,
But I Will repine no more.
PSALM XLIX. Long Meter. The rich Sinner's Death, and the Saint's Resurrection.
^
WHY do the proud insult the poor,
And boast the large estates they have!
How vain are riches to secure
Their haughty owners from the grave!
^
They cannot redeem an hour from death
With all the wealth in which they trust;
Nor give a dying brother breath,
When GOD commands him down to dust.
^
There the dark earth and dismal shade
Shall clasp their naked bodies round;
That flesh so delicately fed
Lies cold, and moulders in the ground.
^
Like thoughtless sheep the sinner dies,
And leaves his glories in the tomb:
The saints shall in the morning rise,
And hear the oppressor's awful doom.
5
His honors perish in the dust,
And pomp and beauty, birth and blood:
That glorious day exalts the just
To full dominion over the proud.
6
My Savior shall my life restore,
And raise me from my dark abode;
My flesh and soul shall part no more,
But dwell forever near my GOD.
PSALM L. Ver. 1 -- 6. First Part. Com. Meter. The last Judgment; or, The
Saints Rewarded.
1
THE Lord, the judge, before his throne,
Bids the whole earth draw nigh,
The nations near the rising sun,
And near the Western sky.
2
No more shall bold blasphemers say,
Judgment will never begin;
No more abuse his long delay
To impudence and sin.
3
Throned on a cloud our GOD shall come,
Bright flames prepare his way,
Thunder and darkness, fire and storm
Lead on the dreadful day.
4
Heaven from above his call shall hear,
Attending angels come,
And earth and hell shall know, and fear,
His justice and their doom.
5
"But gather all my saints (he cries)
"That made their peace with GOD,
"By the Redeemer's sacrifice,
"And sealed it with his blood.
6
"Their faith and works, brought forth to light,
"Shall make the world confess
"My sentence of reward is right,
"And heaven adore my grace.
PSALM L. Ver. 10, 11, 14, 15, 23. Second Part. Common Meter. Obedience is
better than Sacrifice.
THus says the Lord, "the spacious fields
"And flocks and herds are mine,
"Over all the cattle of the hills
"I claim a right divine.
2
"I ask no sheep for sacrifice,
"Nor bullocks burnt with fire;
"To hope and love, to pray and praise,
"Is all that I require.
3
"Invoke my name when trouble's near,
"My hand shall set thee free;
"Then shall thy thankful lips declare
"The honor due to me.
4
"The man that offers humble praise,
"Declares my glory best:
"And those that tread my holy ways,
"Shall my salvation taste.
PSALM L. Ver. 1, 5, 8, 16, 21, 22. Third Part. Common Meter. They Judgment of
Hypocrites.
WHEN Christ to judgment shall descend,
And saints surround their Lord,
He calls the nations to attend,
And hear his awful word.
2
"Not for the want of bullocks slain
"Will I the world reprove;
"Altars and rites, and forms are vain
"Without the fire of love.
3
"And what have hypocrites to do
"To bring their sacrifice?
"They call my statutes just and true,
"But deal in theft and lies.
4
"(...) you expect to 'scape my sight,
"(...) without (...)
"But, I shall bring your crimes to light,
"With anguish in your soul.
5
Consider, ye, that slight the Lord,
Before his wrath appear;
If once you fall beneath his sword,
There Is no deliverer there.
PSALM L. Long Meter. Hypocricy exposed.
1
THE Lord, the judge his churches warns,
Let hypocrites attend and fear,
Who place their hope in rites and forms,
But make not faith nor love their care.
2
Vile wretches dare rehearse his name
With lips of falsehood and deceit;
A friend or brother they defame,
And sooth and flatter those they hate.
3
They watch to do their neighbors wrong,
Yet dare to seek their Maker's face;
They take his covenant on their tongue,
But break his laws, abuse his grace.
4
To heaven they lift their hands unclean
Defiled with lust, defiled with blood;
By night they practice every sin,
By day their mouths draw near to GOD.
5
And while his judgments long delay,
They grow secure and sin the more;
They think he sleeps as well as they,
And put far off the dreadful hour.
6
Oh dreadful hour! when GOD draws near,
And sets their crimes before their eyes!
His wrath their guilty souls shall tear,
And no deliverer dare to rise.
PSALM L. The last Judgment.
To a new Tune.
THE Lord, the sovereign sends his summons forth,
Calls the south nations, and awakes the north;
From East to West the sounding orders spread
Through distant worlds and regions of the dead;
No more shall atheists mock his long delay;
His vengeance sleeps no more; behold the day.
2
Behold the judge descends; his guards are high,
Tempest and fire attend him down the sky*
Heaven, earth and hell, draw near; let all things come
To hear his justice and the sinners doom;
But gather first my saints (the judge commands)
Bring them, ye angels, from their distant lands.
3
Behold my covenant stands forever good,
Sealed by the eternal sacrifice in blood,
And signed with all their names; the Greek the Jew,
That paid the ancient worship or the new,
There Is no distinction here* prepare their thrones,
And near me seat my favorites and my sons.
4
I, their almighty savior and their GOD,
I am their judge; Ye heavens proclaim abroad
My just, eternal sentence, and declare
Those awful truths, that sinners dread to hear;
Sinners in Zion, tremble and retire;
I doom the painted hypocrite to fire.
5
Not for the want of goats or bullocks (...)
Do I condemn thee; bulls and goats are vain,
Without the flames of love; in vain the store
Of brutal offerings that were mine before;
Mine are the tamer beasts and savage breed,
Flocks, herds, and fields, and forests where they feed.
6
If I were hungry, would I ask thee food?
When did I thirst, or taste the victims blood?
Can I be flattered with thy cringing bows,
Thy solemn chatterings and fantastic vows?
Are my eyes charmed thy vestments to behold,
Glaring in gems, and gay in woven gold?
7
Unthinking wretch! how could thou hope to please
A GOD, a spirit, with such toys as these?
While with my grace and statutes on thy tongue
Thou love deceit, and do thy brother wrong;
In vain to pious forms thy zeal pretends,
Thieves and adulterers are thy chosen friends.
8
Silent I waited with long suffering love,
But did thou hope that I should never reprove?
And cherish such an impious thought within,
That GOD the righteous would indulge thy sin?
Behold my terrors now; my thunders roll,
And thy own crimes affright thy guilty soul.
9
Sinners, awake betimes; ye fools, be wise;
Awake before this dreadful morning rise;
Change your vain thoughts, you sinful works amend;
Fly to the savior, make the judge your friend;
Lest like a lion his last vengeance tear
Your trembling souls and no deliverer near.
PSALM L. To the old proper tune. The Last Judgment.

PSALM LI. First Part. Long Meter. A Penitent pleading for Pardon.
1
SHOW pity, Lord, O Lord, forgive,
Let a repenting rebel live;
Are not thy mercies large and free?
May not a sinner trust in thee?
2
My crimes are great but cannot surpass
The power and glory of thy grace:
Great GOD, thy nature has no bound,
So let thy pardoning love be found.
3
Oh wash my soul from every sin,
And make my guilty conscience clean;
Here on my heart the burden lies,
And past offenses pain mine eyes.
4
My lips with shame my sins confess
Against thy law, against thy grace;
Lord, should thy judgment grow severe,
I am condemned but thou art clear.
5
Should sudden vengeance seize my breath,
I must pronounce thee just in death:
And if my soul were sent to hell,
Thy righteous law approves it well.
6
Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,
Whose hope, still hovering round thy word,
Would light on some sweet promise there,
Some sure support against despair.
PSALM LI. Second Part. Long Meter. Original and actual sin confessed.
1
LORD, I am vile, conceived in sin,
And born unholy and unclean;
Sprung from the man whose guilty fall
Corrupts the race, and taints us all.
2
Soon as we draw our infant-breath,
The seeds of sin grow up for death;
The law demands a perfect heart;
But we are defiled in every part.
3
[Great GOD, create my heart anew,
And form my spirit pure and true;
Oh make me wise betimes to spy
My danger and my remedy.]
4
Behold I fall before thy face;
My only refuge is thy grace;
No outward forms can make me clean;
The leprosy lies deep within.
5
No bleeding bird, nor bleeding beast,
Nor hysop-branch, nor sprinkling priest,
Nor running brook, nor flood, nor sea,
Can wash the dismal stain away.
6
Jesus, my GOD, thy blood alone
Has power sufficient to atone;
Thy blood can make me white as snow;
No Jewish types could cleanse me so.
7
While guilt disturbs and breaks my peace,
Nor flesh nor soul has rest or ease;
Lord, let me hear thy pardoning voice,
And make my broken heart rejoice.
PSALM LI. Third Part. Long Meter. The Backslider restored; or, Repentance and
Faith in the Blood of Christ.
1
O Thou that hear'st when sinners cry,
Though all my crimes before thee lie,
Behold them not with angry look,
But blot their memory from thy book.
2
Create my nature pure within,
And form my soul averse to sin:
Let thy good spirit never depart,
Nor hide thy presence from my heart.
3
I cannot live without thy light,
Cast out and banished from thy fight:
Thine holy joys, my GOD, restore,
And guard me, that I fall no more.
4
Though I have grieved thy spirit, Lord,
Thy help and comfort still afford:
And let a wretch come near thy throne,
To plead the merits of thy son.
5
A broken heart, my GOD, my king,
Is all the sacrifice I bring;
The GOD of grace will never despise
A broken heart for sacrifice.
6
My soul lies humbled in the dust,
And owns thy dreadful sentence just;
Look down, O Lord, with pitying eye,
And save the soul condemned to die.
7
Then will I teach the world thy ways;
Sinners shall learn thy sovereign grace;
I Will lead them to my savior's blood,
And they shall praise a pardoning GOD.
8
O may thy love inspire my tongue!
Salvation shall be all my song;
And all my powers shall join to bless
The Lord my strength and righteousness.
PSALM LI.3 -- 13. First Part. Com. Meter. Original and Actual Sin confessed
and pardoned.
1
LORD, I would spread my sore distress
And guilt before thine eyes;
Against thy laws, against thy grace,
How high my crimes arise!
2
Should thou condemn my soul to hell,
And crush my flesh to dust,
Heaven would approve thy vengeance well,
And earth must own it just.
3
I from the stock of Adam came,
Unholy and unclean;
All my original is shame,
And all my nature sin.
4
Born in a World of guilt, I drew
Contagio^ with my breath;
And as my days advanced, I grew
A juster prey for death.
5
Cleanse me, O Lord, and cheer my soul
With thy forgiving love;
Oh make my broken spirit whole,
And bid my pains remove.
6
Let not thy spirit ever depart,
Nor drive me from thy face;
Create a new my vicious heart,
And fill it with thy grace.
7
Then will I make thy mercy known
Before the sons of men;
Backsliders shall address thy throne,
And turn to GOD again.
PSALM LI.14 -- 17. Second Part Com. Meter Repentance and Faith in the Blood of
Christ.
1
O GOD of mercy, hear my call,
My loads of guilt remove,
Break down this separating wall
That bars me from thy love.
2
Give me the presence of thy grace,
Then my rejoicing tongue
Shall speak aloud thy righteousness,
And make thy praise my song.
3
No blood of goats nor heifer slain
For sin could ever atone;
The death of Christ shall still remain
Sufficient and alone.
4
A soul oppressed with sin's desert
My GOD will never despise;
A humble groan, a broken heart
Is our best sacrifice.
PSALM LII. Common Meter. The disappointment of the wicked.
^
WHY should the mighty make their boast,
And heavenly grace despise?
In their own arm they put their trust,
And fill their mouth with lies.
^
But God in vengeance shall destroy,
And drive them from his face;
No more shall they his church annoy,
Nor find on earth a place.
^
But like a cultured olive grove,
Dressed in immortal green,
Thy children, blooming in thy love,
Amid thy courts are seen.
^
On thine eternal grace, O Lord,
Thy saints shall rest secure,
And all, who trust thy holy word,
Shall find salvation sure.
PSALM LII. Long Meter. The folly of self-dependence.
1
WHY should the haughty hero boast,
His vengeful arm, his warlike host?
While blood defiles his cruel hand,
And desolation wastes the land.
2
He joys to hear the captive's cry,
The widow's groan, the orphan's sigh;
And when the wearied sword would spare,
His falsehood spreads the fatal snare.
3
He triumphs in the deeds of wrong,
And arms with rage his impious tongue;
With pride proclaims his dreadful power,
And bids the trembling world adore.
4
But God beholds, and with a frown,
Casts to the dust his honors down;
The righteous freed, their hopes recall,
And hail the proud oppressors fall.
5
How low the insulting tyrant lies,
Who dared the eternal power despise;
And vainly deemed with envious joy,
His arm almighty to destroy.
6
We praise the Lord, who heard our cries,
And sent salvation from the skies;
The saints, who saw our mournful days,
Shall join our grateful songs of praise.
PSALM LIII.4 -- 6. Victory and Deliverance from persecution.
1
ARE all the foes of Sion fools,
Who thus destroy her saints?
Do they not know her Savior rules,
And pities her complaints?
2
They shall be seized with sad surprise;
For GOD's avenging arm
Shall crush the hand that dares arise,
To do his children harm.
3
In vain the sons of satan boast
Of armies in array;
When GOD has first despised their host,
They fall an easy prey.
4
Oh for a word from Sion's king,
Her captives to restore!
Thy joyful saints thy praise shall sing,
And Israel weep no more.
PSALM LIVE. Common Meter.
1
BEHOLD us, Lord, and let our cry
Before thy throne ascend,
Cast thou on us a pitying eye,
And still our lives defend.
2
For slaughtering foes insult us round,
Oppressive, proud and vain,
They cast thy temples to the ground,
And all our rites profane.
3
Yet thy forgiving grace we trust,
And in thy power rejoice;
Thine arm shall crush our foes to dust,
Thy praise inspire our voice.
4
Be thou with those whose friendly hand
Upheld us in distress,
Extend thy truth through every land,
And still thy people bless.
PSALM LV.1 -- 8, 16, 17, 18, 22. Com. Meter. Support for the afflicted and
tempted Soul.
1
O GOD, my refuge, hear my cries,
Behold my flowing tears,
For earth and hell my hurt devise,
And triumph in my fears.
2
Their rage is levelled at my life,
My soul with guilt they load,
And fill my thoughts with inward strife,
To shake my hope in GOD.
3
What inward pains my heart strings wound,
I groan with every breath
Horror and fear beset me round
Amongst the shades of death.
4
Oh were I like a feathered dove,
And innocence had wings;
I Would fly, and make a long remove
From all these restless things.
5
Let me to some wild desert go,
And find a peaceful home,
Where storms of malice never blow,
Temptations never come.
6
Vain hopes, and vain inventions all
To 'scape the rage of hell!
The mighty GOD, on whom I call,
Can save me here as well.
PAUSE.

7
By morning light I Will seek his face,
At noon repeat my cry,
The night shall hear me ask his grace*
Nor will he long deny.
8
GOD shall preserve my soul from fear,
Or shield me when afraid;
Ten thousand angels must appear
If he command their aid.
9
I cast my burdens on the Lord,
The Lord sustains them all;
My courage rests upon his word,
That saints shall never fall.
10
My highest hopes shall not be vain,
My lips shall spread his praise;
While cruel and deceitful men,
Scarce live out half their days.
PSALM LV.15, 16, 17, 19, 22, Short Meter.
1
LET sinners take their course,
And choose the road to death;
But in the worship of my GOD
I Will spend my daily breath.
2
My thoughts address his throne,
When morning brings the light;
I seek his blessing every noon,
And pay my vows at night.
3
Thou will regard my cries,
O my eternal GOD,
(...) sinners perish in surprise
(...) rod.
^
^
^
They neither fear nor trust thy name,
Nor learn to do thy will.
5
But I with all my cares,
Will lean upon the Lord;
I Will cast my burdens on his arm,
And rest upon his word.
6
His arm shall well sustain
The children of his love;
The ground on which their safety stands,
No earthly power can move.
PSALM LVI. Deliverance from Oppression and Falsehood; or GOD's Cure of his
People in Answer to Faith and Prayer.
1
O Thou, whose justice reigns on high,
And makes the oppressor cease,
Behold how envious sinners try
To vex and break my peace.
2
The sons of violence and lies
Join to devour me, Lord;
But as my hourly dangers rise,
My refuge is thy word.
3
In GOD most holy, just, and true,
I have reposed my trust;
Nor will I fear what flesh can do,
The offspring of the dust.
4
They wrest my words to mischief still,
Charge me with unknown faults;
For mischiefs all their counsels fill,
And malice all their thoughts.
5
Shall they escape without thy frown?
Must their devices stand?
Oh cast the hanghty sinner down,
And let him know thy hand!
PAUSE.

6
GOD sees the sorrows of his saints,
Their groans affect his ears,
Thy mercy counts my just complaints,
And numbers all my tears.
7
When to thy throne I raise my cry
The wicked fear and flee:
So swift is prayer to reach the sky,
So near is GOD to me.
8
In thee, most holy, just, and true,
I have reposed my trust;
Nor will I fear what man can do,
The offspring of the dust.
9
Thy solemn vows are on me, Lord,
Thou shall receive my praise;
I Will sing, how faithful is thy word!
How righteous all thy ways!
10
Thou have secured my soul from death,
Oh set thy prisoner free,
That heart and hand, and life and breath
May be employed for thee.
PSALM LVII. Praise for Protection; Grace and Truth.
1
MY GOD, in whom are all the springs,
Of boundless love and grace unknown,
Hide me beneath thy spreading wings,
Till the dark cloud is overblown.
2
Up to the heavens I send my cry,
The Lord will my desires perform;
He sends his angel from the sky,
And saves me from the threatening storm.
3
Be thou exalted, O my GOD,
Above the heavens, where angels dwell;
Thy power on earth be known abroad,
And land to land thy wonders tell.
4
My heart is fixed; my song shall raise
Immortal honors to thy name;
Awake, my tongue, to sound his praise,
My tongue, the glory of my frame.
5
High over the earth his mercy reigns,
And reaches to the utmost sky;
His truth to endless years remains,
When lower worlds dissolve and die.
6
Be thou exalted, O my God,
Above the heavens, where angels dwell;
Thy power on earth be known abroad,
And land to land thy wonders tell.
PSALM LVIII. As the 113 Psalm. Warning to Magistrates.
1
JUDGES, who rule the world by laws,
Will ye despise the righteous cause,
When vile oppression wastes the land?
Dare ye condemn the righteous poor,
And let rich sinners 'scape secure.
While gold and greatness bribe your hand!
2
Have ye forgot, or never knew
That GOD will judge the judges too!
High in the heavens his justice reigns;
Yet you invade the rights of GOD;
And send your bold decrees abroad
To bind the conscience in your chains.
3
A poisoned arrow is your tongue,
The arrow sharp, the poison strong,
And death attends where ever it wounds;
You hear no counsels, cries or tears;
So the deaf adder stops her ears!
Against the power of charming sounds.
4
Break out their teeth, eternal GOD,
Those teeth of lions died in blood;
And crush the serpents in the dust:
As empty chaff, when whirlwinds rise,
Before the sweeping tempest flies,
So let their hopes and names be lost.
5
The Almighty thunders from the sky,
Their grandeur melts, their titles die,
As hills of snow dissolve and run,
Or snails that perish in their slime,
Or births that come before their time,
Vain births that never see the sun.
6
Thus shall the vengeance of the Lord
Safety and joy to saints afford;
And all that hear shall join and say,
"Sure there is a GOD that rules on high,
"A God that hears his children cry,
"And will their sufferings well repay.
PSALM LIX. Short Meter. Prayer for national deliverance.
1
FROM foes, that round us rise,
O GOD of heaven, defend,
Who brave the vengeance of the skies,
And with thy saints contend.
2
Behold, from distant shores,
And desert wilds they come,
Combine for blood their barbarous force,
And through thy cities roam.
3
Baneath the silent shade,
Their secret plots they lay,
Our peaceful walls by night invade,
And waste the fields by day.
4
And will the GOD of grace,
Regardless of our pain,
Permit secure that impious race,
To riot in their reign!
5
In vain their secret guile,
Or open force they prove;
His eye can pierce the deepest veil,
His hand their strength remove.
6
Yet save them, Lord, from death,
Lest we forget their doom;
But drive them (...) thine angry breath,
Through distan^ ^^ds to roam.
7
Then shall our grat^^ul voice
Proclaim our guardian GOD;
The nations round the earth rejoice,
And sound the praise abroad.
PSALM LX. Common Meter. Looking to God in the distress of war.
1
LORD thou has scourged our guilty land,
Behold thy people mourn;
Shall vengeance ever guide thy hand?
And mercy never return?
2
Beneath the terrors of thine eye,
Earth's haughty towers decay;
Thy frowning mantle spreads the sky,
And mortals melt away.
3
Our Sion trembles at thy stroke,
And dreads thy lifted hand!
Oh, heal the people thou have broke,
And save the sinking land.
4
Exalt thy banner in the field,
For those that fear thy name;
From barbarous hosts our nation shield,
And put our foes to shame.
5
Attend our armies to the fight,
And be their guardian GOD;
In vain shall numerous powers unite,
Against thy lifted rod.
6
Our troops, beneath thy guiding hand,
Shall gain a glad renown:
It Is GOD who makes the feeble stand,
And treads the mighty down.
PSALM LXI.1 -- 6. Safety in GOD.
1
WHEN overwhelmed with grief,
My heart within me dies,
Helpless and far from all relief
To heaven I lift mine eyes.
2
Oh lead me to the rock
That Is high above my head,
And make the covert of thy wings
My shelter and my shade.
3
Within thy presence, Lord,
Forever I Will abide;
Thou art the tower of my defense,
The refuge where I hide.
4
Thou give me the lot
Of those that fear thy name;
If endless life be their reward,
I shall possess the same.
PSALM LXII.5 -- 12. No Trust in the Creatures; or, Faith in divene (...) and
Power.
1
MY sprit looks to GOD alone;
My rock and refuge is his throne;
In all my fears, in all my straits,
My soul on his salvation waits.
2
Trust him, ye saints, in all your ways,
Pour out your hearts before his face;
When helpers fail, and foes invade,
GOD is our all-sufficient aid.
3
False are the men of high degree,
The baser sort are vanity;
Laid in the balance both appear
Light as a puff of empty air.
4
Make not increasing gold your trust,
Nor set your hearts on glittering dust;
Why will you grasp the fleeting smoke,
And not believe what GOD has spoke?
5
Once has his awful voice declared,
Once and again my ears have heard,
"All power is his eternal due;
He must be feared and trusted too.
6
For sovereign power reigns not alone,
Grace is a partner of the throne:
Thy grace and justice, mighty Lord,
Shall well divide our last reward.
PSALM LXIII.1, 2, 5, 3, 4. First Part. Common Meter. The Morning of a Lord's
Day.
1
EARLY, my GOD, without delay,
I haste to seek thy face;
My thirsty spirit faints away
Without thy cheering grace.
2
So pilgrims on the scorching sound
Beneath a burning sky,
Long for a cooling stream at hand,
And they must drink or die.
3
I Have seen thy glory and thy power
Through all thy temple shine;
My GOD, repeat (...) heavenly hour,
That vision so (...).
4
Not all the blessings of a feast
Can please my soul so well,
As when thy richer grace I taste,
And in thy presence dwell.
5
Not life itself, with all its joys,
Can my best passions move,
Or raise so high my cheerful voice,
As thy forgiving love.
6
Thus till my last expiring day
I Will bless my GOD and king;
Thus will lift my hands to pray,
And tune my lips to sing.
PSALM LXIII.6 -- 10. Second Part. Common Meter. Midnight Thoughts Recollected.
1
'TWAS in the watches of the night
I thought upon thy power,
I kept thy lovely face in sight
Amidst the darkest hour.
2
My flesh lay resting on my bed,
My soul arose on high;
" My GOD, my Life, my Hope, I said,
"Bring thy Salvation nigh.
3
My spirit labors up thine hill,
And climbs the heavenly road;
But thy right hand upholds me still,
While I pursue my GOD.
4
Thy mercy stretches over my head
The shadow of thy wings;
My heart rejoices in thine aid,
My tongue awakes and sings.
5
But the destroyers of my peace
Shall fret and rage in vain;
The tempter shall forever-cease,
And all my sins be slain.
6
Thy sword shall give my foes to death.
And send them down to dwell
In the dark caverns of the earth,
Or in the deeps of hell.
PSALM LXIII. Long Meter. Longing after GOD, or, The Love of GOD better than
Life.
1
GREAT GOD, indulge my humble claim,
Thou art my hope, my joy, my rest;
The glories that compose thy name
^^and all engaged to make me blessed.
2
Thou great and good, thou just and wise,
Thou art my father and my GOD;
And I am thine by sacred ties;
Thy son, thy servant bought with blood.
^
With heart and eyes and lifted hands
For thee I long, to thee I look,
As travelers in thirsty lands
Pant for the cooling-water brook.
4
With early feet I love t'appear
Among thy saints, and, seek thy face,
Often have I seen thy glory there,
And felt the power of sovereign grace.
5
Not fruits nor wines that tempt our taste,
No pleasures that to sense belong,
Could make me so divinely blessed,
Or raise so high my cheerful song.
6
My life itself without thy love
No taste or pleasure could afford;
'Twould but a tiresome burden prove,
If I were banished from the Lord.
7
Amidst the wakeful hours of night,
When busy cares afflict my head,
One thought of thee gives new delight,
And adds refreshment to my bed.
8
I Will lift my hands, I Will raise my voice,
While I have breath to pray or praise;
This work shall make my heart rejoice,
And bless the remnant of my days.
PSALM LXIII. Short Meter. Seeking GOD.
1
MY GOD, permit my tongue
This joy, to call thee mine;
And let my early cries prevail
To taste thy love divine.
2
My thirsty fainting soul
Thy mercy does implore:
Not travelers in desert lands
Can pant for water more.
3
Within thy churches, Lord,
I long to find my place,
Thy power and glory to behold,
And feel thy quickening grace.
4
For life without thy love
No relish can afford;
No joy can be compared with this,
To serve and please the Lord.
5
To thee I Will lift my hands,
And praise thee while I live;
Not the rich dainties of a feast
Such food or pleasure give.
6
In wakeful hours of night,
I call my GOD to mind;
I think how wise thy counsels are,
And all thy dealings kind.
7
Since thou have been my help,
To thee my spirit flies,
And on thy watchful providence;
My cheerful hope relies.
8
The shadow of thy wings,
My soul in safety keeps:
I follow where my father leads,
And he supports my steps.
PSALM LXIV. Long meter.
1
GREAT GOD attend to my complaint,
Nor let my drooping spirit faint;
When foes in se^^^^ spread the snare,
Let my salvation (...) thy care.
2
Shield me without ^^d guard within,
From treacherous foes and deadly sin;
May envy, lust and pride depart,
And heavenly grace expand my heart.
3
Thy justice and thy power display,
And scatter far thy foes away;
While listening nations learn thy word,
And saints triumphant bless the Lord.
4
Then shall thy church exalt her voice,
And all that love thy name rejoice;
By faith approach thine awful throne,
And plead the merits of thy Son.
PSALM LXV.1 -- 5, First Part, Long Meter. Public Prayer and Praise.
1
THE praise of Sion waits for thee,

To save when humble sinners pray;
All lands to thee shall lift their eyes,
And every yielding heart obey.
3
Against my will my sins prevail,
But grace shall purge away the stain:
The blood of Christ will never fail
To wash my garments white again.
4
Blessed is the man whom thou shall choose,
And give him kind access to thee;
Give him a place within thy house,
To taste thy love divinely free.
PAUSE.

5
Let Babel fear when Sion prays;
Babel, prepare for long distress,
When Sion's GOD himself arrays
In terror and in righteousness.
6
With dreadful glory GOD fulfils
What his afflicted saints request;
And with Almighty wrath reveals
His love to give his churches rest.
7
Then shall the flocking nations run
To Sion's hill and own their Lord;
The rising and the setting sun
Shall see the Savior's name adored.
PSALM LXV.5 -- 13. 2 d. Part Long Meter. Divine Providence in Air, Earth and
Sea; or, The GOD of Nature and Grace.
1
THE GOD of our salvation hears
The groans of Sion mixed with tears;
Yet when he comes with kind designs,
Through all the way his terror shines.
2
On him the race of man depends,
Far as the earth's remotest ends,
Where the Creator's name is known,
By nature's feeble light alone.
3
Sailors that travel over the flood,
Address their frighted souls to GOD,
When tempests rage and Billows roar
At dreadful distance from the shore.
4
He bids the noisy tempests cease;
He calms the raging crowd to peace,
When a tumultuous nation raves,
Wild as the winds, and loud as waves.
5
Whole kingdoms shaken by the storm,
He settles in a peaceful form;
Mountains established by his hand
Firm on their old foundations stand.
6
Behold his ensigns sweep the sky,
New comets blaze and lightnings fly;
The Heathen lands with swift surprise,
From the bright horrors turn their eyes.
7
At his Command the morning ray
Smiles in the East, and leads the day,
He guides the sun's declining wheels
Over the tops of western hills.
8
Seasons and times obey his voice;
The evening and the morn rejoice
To see the earth made soft with showers,
Laden with fruit and dressed in flowers,
9
It Is from his watery stores on high,
He gives the thirsty ground supply;
He walks upon the clouds, and thene
Does his enriching drops dispense.
10
The desert grows a fruitful field,
Abundant fruit the valleys yield;
The valleys shout with cheerful voice,
And neighboring hills repeat their joys.
11
The pastures smile in green array,
There lambs and larger cattle play;
The larger cattle and the lamb,
Each in his language speaks thy name.
12
Thy works pronounce thy power divine;
Over every field thy glories shine;
Through every month thy gifts appear;
Great GOD, thy goodness crowns the year.

But pardoning grace is thine,
And thou will grant us power and skill
To conquer every sin.
3
Blessed are the men whom thou will choose
To bring them near thy face,
Give them a dwelling in thine house,
To feast upon thy grace.
4
In answering what thy church requests*
Thy truth and terror shine,
And works of dreadful righteousness,
Fulfill thy kind design.
5
Thus shall the wondering nations see
The Lord is good and just;
And distant islands fly to thee,
And make thy name their trust.
6
They dread thy glittering tokens, Lord,
When signs in heaven appear;
But they shall learn thy holy word,
And love as well as fear.
PSALM LXV. Second Part. Common Meter. The Providence of God in Air, Earth and

Thy morning light and evening shade,
Successive comforts bring:
Thy plenteous fruits make harvest glad,
Thy flowers adora the spring.
3
Seasons and times, and moons and hours,
Heaven, earth and air are thine;
When clouds distill in fruitful showers,
The Author is divine:
4
Those wandering cisterns in the sky
Borne by the winds around,
Whose watery treasures well supply
The furrows of the ground.

The thirsty ridges drink their fill,
And ranks of corn appear;
Thy ways abound with blessings still,
Thy goodness crowns the year.

The clouds like rivers raised on high,
Pour out at his command
Their watery blessings from the sky,
Th cheer the thirsty land.
3
The softened ridges of the field
Permit the corn to spring:
The valleys rich provision yield,
And the poor laborers sing.
4
The little hills on every side
Rejoice at falling showers*
The meadows dressed in beauteous pride
Perfume the air with flowers.
5
The barren clods refreshed with rain
Promise a joyful crop;
The parched grounds look green ^^^in,
And raise the reaper's hope.

How bounteous are thy ways!
The bleating flocks spread over the downs,
And shepherds shout thy praise.

"Sinners before thy presence sly,
"Or at thy feet they bow."
3
[Come see the wonders of our God,
How glorious are his ways?
In Moses hand he put the rod?
And clave the frighted seas.
4
He made the ebbing channel dry,
While Israel passed the flood;
There did the church begin their joy,
And triumph in their God.]
5
He rules by his resistless might:
Will rebel mortals dare
Provoke the Eternal to the fight,
And tempt that dreadful war.

Oh bless our God, and never cease;
Ye saints, fulfill his praise;
He keeps our life, maintains our peace,
And guides our doubtful ways.
7
Lord, thou have proved our suffering souls,
To make our graces shine;
So silver bears the burning coals,
The metal to refine.

Through watery deeps and firey ways
We march at thy command,
Led to possess the promised place
By thine unerring hand.
PSALM LXVI.13 -- 20. Second Part, Praise to GOD for hearing Prayer.

That heard the long requests I made
In my distressful hour.

My lips and cheerful heart prepare
To make his mercies known;
Come ye that fear my GOD, and hear
The wonders he has done.
3
When on my head huge sorrows fell,
I sought the heavenly aid;
He saved my sinking soul from hell,
And death's eternal shade.
4
If sin lay covered in my heart
While prayer employed my tongue;
The Lord had shown me no regard,
Nor I his praises sung.
5
But GOD (his name be ever blessed)
Has set my spirit free;
Nor turned from him my poor request,
Nor turned his heart from me.
PSALM LXVII. The Nation's Prosperity, and the Church 's Increase

Surround the favorite land.]

Sound all the earth abroad;
And distant nations know and love

Sing to the Lord, ye distant lands,
Sing loud with solemn voice;
Let every tongue exalt his praise,
And every heart rejoice.

In wisdom rules the worlds he made
And bids them taste his love.

With fruitfulness and peace.

Behold his fainting foes expire
Like melting wax before the fire.]

Ye saints rejoice before his face.

Fly to his aid in sharp distress;
In him the poor and helpless find
A judge that is just, a father kind.

And prisoners see the light again;
But rebels that despute his will,
Shall dwell in chains and darkness still.

More glorious when the Lord was there;
While he pronounced his dreadful law,
And struck the chosen tribes with awe.
3
How bright the triumph none can tell,
When the rebellious powers of hell,
That thousand souls had captive made,
Were all in chains like captives led.
4
Raised by his father to the throne,
He sent his promised spirit down,
With gifts and grace for rebel-men,
That GOD might dwell on earth again.

He sends his sun his circuit round,
To cheer the fruits, to warm the ground;
He bids the clouds with plenteous rain
Refresh the thirsty earth again
3
It Is to his care we owe our breath.
And all our near escapes from death:
Safety and health to GOD belong;
He heals the weak, and guards the strong.
4
He makes the saint and sinner prove
The common blessings of his love;
But the wide difference that remains
Is endless joy or endless pains.
5
The Lord that bruised the serpent's head,
On all the serpent's seed shall ^r^ad,
The stubborn sinner's hope confound,
And smite him with a lasting wound.
5
But his right hand his saints shall raise
From the deep earth, or deeper seas,
And bring them to his court above;
There shall they taste his special love.

"SAVE me, O GOD, the swelling floods
"Break in upon my soul;

"In tears I waste the day;
"My GOD, behold my longing eyes,
"And shorten thy delay.
3
"They hate my soul without a cause,
"And still their number grows
"More than the hairs around my head,
"And mighty are my foes.
4
"'It Was then I paid that dreadful debt
"That men could never pay,
"And gave those honors to thy law
"Which sinners took away.

"Thus in the great Messiah's name,
"The royal prophet mourns;
"Thus he awakes our hearts to grief,
"And gives us joy by turns.
6
"Now shall the saints rejoice and find
"Salvation in thy name,
"For I have borne their heavy load
"Of sorrow, pain, and shame.
7
"Grief like a garment clothed me round,
"And sackcloth was my dress,
"While I procured for naked souls
"A robe of righteousness.
8
"Amongst my brethren and the jews
"I like a stranger stood,
"And bore their vile reproach to bring
"The gentiles near to GOD.
9
"I came in sinful mortals stead
"To do my father's will:
"Yet when I cleans'd my father's house,
"They scandalized my zeal.
10
"My fastings and my holy groans
"Were made the drunkard's song;
"But GOD from his celestial throne
"Heard my complaining tongue.
11
"He saved me from the dreadful deep,
Where fears beset me round;
"He raised and fixed my sinking feet
"On well-establish'd Ground.
12

While to his heavenly father's ear
He sends perpetual cries.
3
"Hear me O Lord, and save thy Son,
"Nor hide thy shining face;
"Why should thy favorite look like one
"Forsaken of thy grace?
4
"With rage they persecute the man
"That groans beneath thy wound,
"While for a sacrifice I pour
"My life upon the ground.
5
"They tread my honor to the dust,
"And laugh when I complain;
"Their sharp insulting slanders add
"fresh anguish to my pain.
6
"All my reproach is known to thee,
"The scandal and the shame;
"Reproach has broke my bleeding heart,
"And lies defiled my name.
7
"I looked for pity, but in vain;
"My kindred are my grief;
"I ask my friends for comfort round,
"But meet with no relief.
8
"With vinegar they mock my thirst,
"They give me gall for food;
"And sporting with my dying groans,
"They triumph in my blood.
9
"Shine into my distressed soul,
"Let thy compassion save;
"And though my flesh sink down to death,
"Redeem it from the grave.

"Shall reign in worlds unknown;
"And thy salvation, O my GOD,
"Shall seat me on thy throne.

His deep distress has raised us high,
His duty and his zeal
Fulfilled the law which mortals broke,
And finished all thy will.
3
His dying groans, his living songs
Shall better please my GOD,
Than harp or trumpet's solemn sound,
Than goat's or bullock's blood.
4
This shall his humble followers see,
And set their hearts at rest;
They by his death draw near to thee,
And live forever blessed.

1
DEEP in our hearts let us record

Behold the rising billows roll
To overwhelm his holy soul.
2
In long complaints he spends his breath,
While hosts of hell, and powers of death,
And all the sons of malice join
To execute their cursed design.
3
Yet, gracious God, thy power and love
Has made the curse a blessing prove;
Those dreadful sufferings of thy Son
Atoned for crimes which we had done.
4

The honors of thy law restored:
His sorrows made thy justice known
And paid for follies not his own.

And let the mourning sinner live:
The Lord will hear us in his name,
Nor shall our hope be turned to shame.

IT WAS for our sake, eternal God,
Thy son sustained that heavy load
Of base reproach and sore disgrace,
While shame defiled his sacred face.
2
The Jews his brethern and his kin,
Abused the man that checked their sin:
While he fulfilled thy holy laws,
They hate him, but without a cause.
3
[ My father's house, said he, was made
A p^ace for worship, not for trade,
Then scattering all their gold and brass,
He scourged the merchants from the place.]
4
[Zeal for the temple of his GOD
Comsum'd his life, exposed his blood:
Reproaches at thy glory thrown
He felt and mourned them as his own,]
5
[His friends forsook, his followers fled,
While foes and arms surround his head;
They curse him with a slanderous tongue,
And the false judge maintains the wrong.]
6
His life they load with hateful lies,
And charge his lips with blasphemies:
They nail him to the shameful tree;
There hung the man that died for me.
7
But GOD beheld, and from his throne
Marks out the men that hate his Son;
The hand that raised him from the dead,
Shall pour the vengeance on their head.

And leave a savor of thy name

His justice shall avenge the poor,
And pride and rage prevail no more.
3
With power he vindicates the just,
And treads the oppressor in the dust;
His worship and his fear shall last,
Till hours, and years, and time be past.
4
As rain on meadows newly mown,
So shall he send his influence down:
His grace on fainting souls distills,
Like heavenly dew on thirsty hills.
5
The heathen lands that lie beneath
The shades of overspreading death,
Revive at his first dawning light,
And deserts blossom at the sight.
6
The saints shall flourish in his days,
Dressed in the robes of joy and praise;
Peace, like a river from his throne
Shall flow to nations yet unknown.
PSALM LXXII. Second Part. Christ's Kingdom among the Gentiles.
1
JESUS shall reign wherever the sun
Does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
2
[Behold the nations with their kings;
There Europe her best tribute brings;
From north to south the princes meet
To pay their homage at his feet.
3
There Persia, glorious to behold,
And India shines in eastern gold;
While western empires own their Lord
And savage tribes attend his word.
4
For him shall endless prayer be made,
And endless praises crown his head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.
5
People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on his love with sweetest song;
And infant-voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on his name.
6
Blessings abound wherever he reigns
The joyful prisoner bursts his chains;
The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blessed.
7
[Where he displays his healing power,
Death and the curse are known no more;
In him the tribes of Adam boast
More blessings than their father lost.
8
Let every creature rise and bring,
Peculiar honors to our king:
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the land amen.]
PSALM LXXIII. First Part. Common Meter. Afflicted Saints happy, and prosperous
Sinners caused.
1
NOW I Am convinced, the Lord is kind
To men of heart sincere,
Yet once my foolish thoughts repined,
And bordered on despair.
2
I grieved to see the wicked thrive,
And spoke with angry breath,
"How pleasant and profane they live!
"How peaceful is their death!
3
"With well fed flesh and haughty eyes
"They lay their fears to sleep;
"Against the heavens their slanders rise,
"While saints in silence weep.
4
"In vain I lift my hands to pray,
"And cleanse my heart in vain;
"For I am chastened all the day,
"The night renews my pain."
5
Yet while my tongue indulged complaints,
I felt my heart reprove;
"Sure I shall thus offend thy saints,
"And grieve the men I love."
6
But still I found my doubts too hard,
The conflict too severe,
'Till I retired to search thy word,
And learn thy secrets there.
7
There, as in some prophetic glass,
I saw the sinner's feet
High mounted on a slippery place
Beside a firey pit.
8
I heard the wretch profanely boast,
'Till at thy frown he fell;
His honors in a dream were lost,
And he awakes in hell.
9
Lord, what an envious fool I was!
How like a thoughtless beast!
Thus to suspect thy promised grace,
And think the wicked blessed.
10
Yet I was kept from full despair,
Upheld by power unknown:
That blessed hand that broke the snare
Shall guide me to thy throne.
PSALM LXXIII.23 -- 28. 2d Part. Com. Meter. GOD our Portion here and hereafter.
1
GOD, my supporter and my hope.
My help forever near,
Thine arm of mercy held me up
When sinking in despair.
2
Thy counsels, Lord, shall guide my feet
Through life's bewildered race;
Thine hand conduct me near thy seat,
To dwell before thy face.
3
Were I in heaven without my GOD,
'Twould be no joy to me;
And whilst this earth is my abode,
I long for none but thee.
4
What if the springs of life were broke,
And flesh and heart should faint,
GOD is my soul's eternal rock,
The strength of every saint.
5
Behold the sinners that remove
Far from thy presence die;
Not all the idol gods they love
Can save them when they cry.
6
But to draw near to thee, my GOD*
Shall be my sweet employ;
My tongue shall sound thy works abroad.
And tell the world my joy.
PSALM LXXIII.22, 3, 6, 17 -- 20. Long Met^^ The Prosperity of Sinners cursed.
1
LORD, what a thoughtless wretch was I,
To mourn, and murmur, and repine
To see the wicked placed on high,
In pride and robes of honor shine.
2
But, Oh their end, their dreadful end!
Thy sanctuary taught me so:
On slippery rocks I see them stand,
And firey billows roll below.
3
Now let them boast how tall they rise,
I Will never envy them again,
There they may stand with haughty eyes*
Till they plunge deep in endless pain.
4
Their fancied joys how fast thy flee!
Like dreams, as fleeting and as vain*
Their songs of softest harmony,
Are but a preface to their pain.
5
Now I esteem their mirth and wine,
Too dear to purchase with my blood;
Lord, tis' enough that thou art mine,
My life, my portion and my GOD.
PSALM LXXIII. Short Meter. The Mystery of Providence unfolded.
1
SURE there is a righteous GOD,
Nor is religion vain;
Though men of vice may boast aloud,
And men of grace complain.
2
I saw the wicked rise,
And felt my heart repine,
While haughty fools with scornful eyes,
In robes of honor shine.
^
Pampered with wanton ease,
Their flesh looks full and fair,
Their wealth rolls in like flowing seas,
And grows without their care.
^
Free from the plagues and pains
That pious souls endure,
Through all their life oppression reigns,
And racks the humble poor.
^
Their impious tongues blaspheme
The everlasting GOD:
Their Malice blasts the good man's name,
And spreads their lies abroad.
^
But I with flowing tears
Indulged my doubts to rise;
"Is there a GOD that sees or hears
"The things below the skies?]
^
The tumult of my thought
Held me in hard suspense,
Till to thy house my feet were brought
To learn thy justice thence.
^
Thy word with light and power,
Did my mistake amend;
I viewed the sinner' life before,
But here I learnt their end.
^
On what a slippery steep
The thoughtless wretches go;
And Oh that dreadful firey deep
That waits their fall below!
^0
Lord, at thy feet I bow,
My thoughts no more repine:
I call my GOD my portion now,
And all my powers are thine.
PSALM LXXIV. The Church Pleading with GOD under sore Persecution.
^
WILL GOD forever cast us off!
His wrath forever smoke
Against the people of his love,
His little chosen flock?
2
Think of the tribes so dearly bought
With their Redeemer's blood;
Nor let thy Sion be forgot,
Where once thy glory stood.
3
Lift up thy feet, and march in haste,
Aloud our ruin calls;
See what a wide and fearful waste
Is made within thy walls.
4
Where once thy churches prayed and sang
Thy foes profanely rage;
Amid thy gates their ensigns hang,
And there their hosts engage.
5
How are the seats of worship broke?
They tear the buildings down,
And he that deals the heaviest stroke,
Procures the chief renown.
6
With flames they threaten to destroy
Thy children in their rest;
Come let us burn at once, they cry,
The temple and the priest.
7
And still to heighten our distress,
Thy presence is withdrawn;
Thy wonte^ signs of power and grace,
Thy power and grace are gone.
8
No prophet speaks to calm our grief,
But all in silence mourn;
Nor know the times of our relief
The hour of thy return.
PAUSE.

9
How long, eternal GOD, how long,
Shall men of pride blaspheme;
Shall saints be made their endless song,
And bear immortal shame.
10
Can thou forever sit and hear
Thine holy name profaned?
And still thy jealousy forbear,
And still withold thine hand?
11
What strange deliverance have thou shown
In ages long before!
And now no other GOD we own,
No other GOD adore.
12
Thou did divide the raging sea
By thy resistless might,
To make thy tribes a wondrous way,
And then secure their flight.
13
Is not the world of nature thine,
The darkness and the day?
Did thou not bid the morningshine,
And mark the sun his way?
14
Has not thy power formed every coast,
And set the earth its bounds,
With summer's heat, and winter's frost,
In their perpetual rounds?
15
And shall the sons of earth and dust
That sacred power blaspheme?
Will not thy hand that formed them first
Avenge thine injured name?
16
Think on the covenant thou have made,
And all thy words of love;
Nor let the birds of prey invade
And vex thy trembling dove.
17
Our foes would triumph in our blood,
And make our hope their jest;
Plead thine own cause, Almighty GOD,
And give thy children rest.
PSALM LXXV (...)
1
TO (...)
^
^
^
2
To slavery doomed, thy chosen sons
Beheld their foes triumphant rise;
And sore oppressed by earthly thrones,
They sought the sovereign of the skies.
3
'Twas then, great GOD, with equal power,
Arose thy vengeance and thy grace,
To scourge their legions from the shore,
And save the remnant of thy race.
4
Thy hand, that formed the restless main,
And reared the mountain's awful head,
Bade raging seas their course restrain,
And desert wilds receive their dead.
5
Such wonders never come by chance,
Nor can the winds such blessings blow*
It Is GOD the judge does one advance,
It Is GOD that lays another low.
6
Let haughty tyrants sink their pride,
Nor lift so high their scornful head;
But lay their impious thoughts aside,
And own the empire GOD has made.
PSALM LXXVI. Israel saved, and the Assyrians destroyed; or GOD's Vengeance
against his enemies proceeds from his Church.
1
IN Judah GOD of old was known;
His name in Israel great;
In Salem stood his holy throne,
And Zion was his seat.
2
Among the praises of his saints,
His dwelling there he chose;
There he received their just complaints,
Against their haughty foes.
3
From Zion went his dreadful word,
And broke that threatening spear;
The bow, the arrows, and the sword,
And crushed the Assyrian war.
4
What are the earth's wide kingdoms else
But mighty hills of prey?
The hill on which Jehovah dwells
Is glorious more than they.
5
'Twas Zion's king that stopped the breath
Of captains and their bands:
The men of might sleep fast in death,
That quells their warlike hands.
6
At thy rebuke, O Jacob's GOD,
Both horse and chariot fell:
Who knows the terrors of thy rod?
Thy vengeance who can tell?
7
What power can stand before thy sight
When once thy wrath appears?
When heaven shines round with dreadful light,
The earth adores and fears.
8
When GOD in his own sovereign ways
Comes down to save the oppressed,
The wrath of man shall work his praise,
And he will restrain the rest.
9
[Vows to the Lord, and tribute bring,
Ye princes, fear his frown:
His terrors shake the proudest king,
And smite his armies down.
10
The thunder of his sharp rebuke
Our haughty foes shall feel;
For Jacob's GOD has not forsook,
But dwells in Zion still.]
PSALM LXXVII. First Part. Melancholy assaulting, and Hope prevailing.
1
TO GOD I cried with mournful voice,
I sought his gracious ear,
In the sad hour, when trouble rose,
And filled my heart with fear.
2
Sad were my days, and dark my nights,
My soul refused relief;
I thought on GOD, the just and wise,
But thoughts increased my grief.
3
Still I complained and still oppressed,
My heart began to break;
My GOD, thy wrath forbade my rest,
And kept my eyes awake.
4
My overwhelming sorrows grew,
'Till I could speak no more;
Then I within myself withdrew.
And called thy judgments over.
5
I called back years and ancient times
When I beheld thy face;
My spirit searched for secret crimes
That might withold thy grace.
6
I called thy mercies to my mind,
Which I enjoyed before;
And will the Lord no more be kind;
His face appear no more?
7
Will he forever cast me off?
His promise ever fail?
Has he forgot his tender love?
Shall anger still prevail?
8
But I forbid this hopeless thought,
This dark, despairing frame,
Rememb'ring what thy hand has wrought;
Thy hand is still the same.
9
I Will think again of all thy ways,
And talk thy wonders over,
Thy wonders of recovering grace,
When flesh could hope no more.
10
Grace dwelt with justice on the throne;
And men that love thy word,
Have in thy sanctuary known
The counsels of the Lord.
PSALM LXXVII. Second Part. Comfort derived from ancient Providence; or Israel
delivered from Egypt, and brought to Canaan.
1
"HOW awful is thy chastening rod!
"(May thy own children say)
"The great, the wise, the dreadful GOD!
"How holy is his way!
2
I Will meditate his works of old,
Who reigns in heaven above,
I Will hear his ancient wonders told,
And learn to trust his love.
3
He saw the house of Joseph lie
With Egypt's yoke oppressed;
Long he delayed to hear their cry,
Nor gave his people rest.
4
The sons of pious Jacob seemed
Abandoned to their foes;
But his Almighty arm redeemed
The nation whom he chose.
5
From slavish chains he sets them free:
They follow where he calls;
He bade them venture through the sea,
And made the waves their walls.
6
The waters saw thee, mighty GOD,
The waters saw thee come;
Backward they fled, and frighted stood,
To make thine armies room.
7
Strange was thy journey through the sea,
Thy footsteps, Lord unknown;
Terrors attend the wondrous way
That brings thy mercies down.
8
[Thy voice with terror in the sound
Through clouds and darkness broke;
All heaven in lightning shone around,
And earth with thunder shook.
9
Thine arrows through the skies were hurled,
How glorious is the Lord!
Surprise and trembling seized the world,
And all his saints adored.
10
He gave them (...) from the rock;
And safe by Mo^^^ hand,
Through a dry desert ^is flock
To Canaan's promised land.]
PSALM LXXVIII. First Part. Providence of GOD recorded; or, pious Education and
Instruction of Children.
1
LET children hear the mighty deeds
Which GOD performed of old;
Which in our younger years we saw,
And which our fathers told.
2
He bids us make his glories known;
His works of power and grace;
And we'll convey his wonders down.
Through every rising race.
3
Our lips shall tell them to our sons,
And they again to theirs,
That generations yet unborn
May teach them to their heirs.
4
Thus shall they learn, in GOD alone
Their hope securely stands,
That they may never forget his works,
But practice his commands.
PSALM LXXVIII. Second Part. Israel's Rebellion and Punishment; or, The Sins
and Chastisements of GOD's People.
1
OH what a stiff rebellious house
Was Jacob's ancient race!
False to their own most solemn vows,
And to their Maker's grace.
2
They broke the covenant of his love,
And did his laws despise,
Forgot the works he wrought to prove
His power before their eyes.
3
They saw the plagues on Egypt light
From his avenging hand:
What dreadful tokens of his might
Spread over the stubborn land.
4
They saw him, cleave the mighty sea.
And marched with safety through,
With watery walls to guard their way,
'Till they had 'scap'd the foe.
5
A wondrous pillar marked the road,
Composed of shade and light;
By day it proved a sheltering cloud,
A leading fire by night.
6
He from the rock their thirst supplied;
The gushing waters flowed,
And ran in rivers by their side,
Along the desert road.
7
Yet they provoked the Lord most high,
And dared distrust his hand;
"Can he with bread our host supply
"Amidst this barren land?"
8
The Lord with indignation heard,
And caused his wrath to flame:
His terrors ever stand prepared
To vindicate his name.
PSALM LXXVIII. Second Part. The Punishment of Luxury and Intemperance; or,
Chastisement and Salvation.
1
WHEN Israel sinned, the Lord reproved,
And filled their heart with dread;
Yet (...) the men he loved,
And sent them heavenly bread.
2
He fed them with a liberal hand,
And made his treasure, known:
He gave the midnight-clouds command
To pour provision down.
3
The manna like a morning shower
Lay thick around their feet;
The food of heaven, so light, so pure;
As though 'twere angels meat.
4.
But they in murmuring language said,
"Is manna all our feast?
"We loath this light, this airy bread;
"We must have flesh to taste."
5.
"Ye shall have flesh to please your lust,"
The Lord in wrath replied,
And sent them quails like sand or dust,
Heaped up on every side.
6.
He gave them all their own desire;
And greedy as they fed,
His vengeance burnt with secret fire,
And smote the rebels dead.
7
When some were slain the rest returned,
And sought the Lord with tears;
Under the rod they feared and mourned,
But soon forgot their fears.
8.
Often he chastis'd, and still forgave,
'Till by his gracious hand
The nations he resolved, to save
Possessed the promised land.
PSALM LXXVIII. Ver. 32, etc. Fourth Part. Backsliding and Forgiveness; or, Sin
punished and Saints saved.
1.
GREAT GOD, how often did Israel prove
By turns thine anger, and thy love?
There is a glass our hearts may see:
How fickle and how false they be.
2
How soon the faithless Jews forgot
The dreadful wonders GOD had wrong
Then they provoke him to his face,
Nor fear his power, nor trust his grace.
3
The Lord consumed their years in pain,
And made their travels long and vain;
A tedious march through unknown ways
Wore out their strength, and spent their days.
4
Often when they saw their brethren slain,
They mourned, and sought the Lord again;
Called him the rock of their abode,
Their high Redeemer, and their GOD.
5
Their prayers and vows before him rise
As flattering words or solemn lies,
While their rebeliious tempers prove
False to his covenant and his love.
6
Yet could his sovereign grace forgive
The men who never deserved to live;
His anger often away he turned,
Or else with gentle flame it burned.
7
He saw their flesh was weak and frail,
He saw temptations still prevail;
The GOD of Abraham loved them still,
And led them to his holy hill.
PSALM LXXIX. Long Meter. For the distress of War.
1
BEHOLD, O GOD, what cruel foes,
Thy peaceful heritage invade;
Thy holy temple stands defiled,
In dust thy sacred walls are laid.
2
Wide over the valleys, drenched in blood,
Thy people fallen in death remain;
The fowls of heaven their flesh devour,
And savage beasts divide the slain.
3
The insulting foes, with impious rage,
Reproach thy children to their face;
"Where is your GOD of boasted power,
"And where the promise of his grace."
4
Deep from the prison's horrid glooms,
Oh hear the mournful captives sigh,
And let thy sovereign power reprieve,
The trembling souls condemned to die.
5
Let those, who dared insult thy reign,
Return dismayed with endless shame,
While heathens, who thy grace despise,
Shall from thy vengeance learn thy name.
6
So shall thy children, freed from death,
Eternal songs of honor raise,
And every future age shall tell,
Thy sovereign power and pardoning grace.
PSALM LXXX. The Church's Prayer under Affliction; or, The Vineyard of GOD
wasted.
1
GREAT shepherd of thine Israel,
Who did between the cherubs dwell,
And lead the tribes, thy chosen sheep,
Safe through the desert and the deep:
2
Thy church is in the desert now,
Shine from on high, and guide us through;
Turn us to thee, thy love restore,
We shall be saved and sigh no more.
3
Great GOD, whom heavenly hosts obey,
How long shall we lament and pray?
And wait in vain thy kind return?
How long shall thy fierce anger burn?
4
Instead of wine and cheerful bread,
Thy saints with their own tears are fed;
Turn us to thee, thy love restore,
We shall be saved and sigh no more.
PAUSE I.

5
Have thou not planted with thy hands
A lovely vine in heathen lands?
Did not thy power defend it round,
And heavenly dews enrich the ground?
6
How did the spreading branches shoot,
And bless the nations with the fruit;
But now, dear Lord, look down and see
Thy mourning vine, that lovely tree.
7
Why is her beauty thus defaced;
Why have thou laid her fences waste?
Strangers and foes against her join,
And every beast devours the vine.
8
Return, Almighty GOD, return;
Nor let thy bleeding vineyard mourn:
Turn us to thee, thy love restore,
We shall be saved and sigh no more.
PAUSE II.

9
Lord, when this vine in Canaan grew,
Thou wast its strength and glory too?
Attacked in vain by all its foes,
Till the fair branch of promise rose.
10
Fair branch, ordained of old to shoot
From David's stock, from Jacob's root;
Himself a noble vine, and we
The lesser branches of the tree:
11
It Is thy own son; and he shall stand
Girt with thy strength at thy right hand;
Thy firstborn son, adorned and blessed
With power and grace above the rest.
12
Oh! for his sake attend our cry,
Shine on thy churches lest they die:
Turn us to thee, thy love restore,
We shall be saved, and sigh no more.
PSALM LXXXI.1, 8 -- 16. The Warning of GOD to his People; or Spiritual
Blessings and Punishments.
1
SING to the Lord aloud,
And make a joyful noise;
GOD is our strength, our Savior GOD:
Let Israel hear his voice.
2
"From idols false and vain,
"Preserve my rites divine;
"I am the Lord who broke thy chain
"Of slavery and of sin.
3
"Stretch thy desires abroad,
"And I Will supply them well;
"But if we will refuse your GOD,
"If Israel will rebel:
4
"I Will leave them, says the Lord,
"To their own lusts a prey,
"And let them run the dangerous road,
"'It Is their own chosen way.
5
"Yet Oh! that all my saints
"Would hearken to my voice!
"Soon I would ease their sore complaints,
"And bid their hearts rejoice.
6
"While I destroy their foes,
"I Will richly feed my flock,
"And they shall taste the stream that flows
"From their eternal rock."
PSALM LXXXII. GOD the supreme Governor; or Magistrates warn^^
1
AMONG the assemblies of the great
A greater ruler takes his seat;
The GOD of heaven as judge surveys
Those gods on earth and all their ways.
2
Why will ye frame oppressive laws?
Or why support the unrighteous cause?
When will ye once defend the poor,
That foes may vex the saints no more?
3
They know not, Lord, nor will they know:
Dark are the ways in which they go;
Their name of earthly gods is vain,
For they shall fall and die like men.
4
Arise, O Lord, and let thy son
Possess his universal throne,
And rule the nations with his rod;
He is our judge, and he our GOD.
PSALM LXXXIII. A Complaint against Persecutors.
1
AND will the GOD of grace
A Perpetual silence keep?
The GOD of justice hold his peace,
And let his vengeance sleep?
2
Behold what cursed snares
The men of mischief spread:
The men that hate thy saints and thee,
Lift up their threatening head.
3
Against thy hidden ones,
Their counsels they employ,
And malice with her watchful eye
Pursues them to destroy.
4
"Come, let us join they cry,
"To root them from the ground,
"Till not the name of saints remain,
"Nor memory shall be found."
5
Awake, Almighty GOD,
And call thy wrath to mind;
Give them like forests to the fire,
Or stubble to the wind.
6
Convince their madness, Lord,
And make them seek thy name;
Or else their stubborn rage confound,
That they may die in shame.
7
Then shall the nations know
Thy glorious, dreadful word,
Jehovah is thy name alone,
And thou the sovereign Lord.
PSALM LXXXIV. First Part. Long Meter. The Pleasure of Public Worship.
1
HOW pleasant, how divinely fair,
O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are!
With long desire my spirit saints
To meet the assemblies of thy faints.
2
My flesh would rest in thine abode;
My panting heart cries out for GOD;
My God! my king! why should I be
So far from all my joys and thee.
3
The sparrow chooses where to rest,
And for her young provides her nest;
But will my God to sparrows grant
That pleasure which his children want?
4
Blessed are the saints who sit on high,
A^ound thy throne above the sky;
Thy brightest glories shine above,
And all their work is praise and love.
5
Blessed are the souls who find a place
Within the temple of thy grace;
There they behold thy gentler rays,
And seek thy face and learn thy praise.
6
Blessed are the men whose hearts are set
To find the way to Zion's gate;
GOD is their strength; and through the road
They lean upon their helper God.
7
Ch^erful they walk with growing strength,
Till all shall meet in heaven at length
Till all before thy face appear,
And join in nobler worship there.
PSALM LXXXIV. Second Part. Long Meter. GOD and his Church, or, Grace and Glory.
1
GREAT GOD, attend while Zion sings
The joy that from thy presence springs;
To spend one day with thee on earth
Exceeds a thousand days of mirth.
2
Might I enjoy the meanest place
W^thin thy house, O GOD of grace,
Not tents of ease, nor thrones of power
Should tempt my feet to leave thy door.
3
GOD is our sun, he makes our day*
GOD is our shield, he guards our way
From all the assults of hell and sin,
From foes without and foes within.
4
All needful grace will GOD bestow,
And crown that grace with glory too:
He gives us all things, and withholds
No real good from upright souls.
5
O GOD, our king, whose sovereign sway
The glorious hosts of heaven obey,
And devils at thy presence flee,
Blessed is the man that trusts in thee.
PSALM LXXXIV. Ver. 1, 2, 3, 10. Paraphrased in Common Meter. Delight in
ordinances of Worship; or, GOD present in his churches.
1
MY Soul, how lovely is the place
To which thy GOD resorts!
It Is heaven to see his smiling face,
Though in his earthly courts.
2
There the great monarch of the skies
His saving power displays,
And light breaks in upon our eyes,
With kind and quickening rays.
3
With his rich gifts the heavenly Dove
Descends and fills the place,
While Christ reveals his wondrous love,
And sheds abroad his grace.
4
There, mighty GOD, thy words declare
The secrets of thy will:
And still we seek thy mercies there,
And sing thy praises still.
PAUSE.

5
My heart and flesh cry out for thee,
While far from thine abode;
When shall I tread thy courts and see
My Savior and my GOD?
6
The sparrow builds her self a nest,
And suffers no remove;
Oh make me like the sparrows, blessed,
To dwell but where I love.
7
To set one day beneath thine eye,
And hear thy gracious voice,
Exceeds a whole eternity
Employed in carnal joys.
8
Lord, at thy threshold I would wait,
While Jesus is within,
Rather than fill a throne of state,
Among the tents of sin.
9
Could I command the spacious land,
And the more boundless sea,
For one blessed hour at thy right hand
I Would give them both away.
PSALM LXXXIV. As the 148th Psalm. Longing for the House of GOD.
1
LORD of the worlds above,
How pleasant and how fair
The dwellings of thy love,
Thy earthly temples are;
To thine abode
My heart aspires
With warm desires
To see my God.
2
The sparrow for her young
With pleasure seeks a nest*
And wandering swallows long
To find their wonted ^est:
My spirit faints
With equal zeal
To rise and dwell
Among thy saints.
3
O happy souls that pray,
Where God appoints to hear;
O happy men that pay
Their constant service there
They praise thee still;
And happy they
That love the way
To Zion's hill.
4
They go from strength to strength,
Through this dark vale of tears,
'Till each arrives at length,
'Till each in heaven appears;
O glorious seat,
When GOD our king
Shall thither bring
Our willing feet!
5
To spend one sacred day,
Where GOD and saints abide,
Affords diviner joy
Than thousand days beside:
Where GOD resorts,
I love it more
To keep the door
Than shine in courts.
6
GOD is our sun and shield,
Our light and our defense;
With gifts our hands are filled
We draw our blessings thence;
He shall bestow
On Jacob's race
Peculiar grace
And glory too.
7
The Lord his people loves;
His hand no good withholds
From those his heart approves,
From pure and pious souls:
Thrice happy he,
O GOD of hosts,
Whose spirit trusts
Alone in thee.
PSALM LXXXV. Ver. 1 -- 8. First Part. Waiting for an Answer to Prayer; or,
Deliverance begun and completed.
1
LROD, thou have called thy grace to mind,
Thou have reversed our heavy doom:
So GOD forgave when Israel sinned,
And brought his wandering captives home.
2
Thou have begun to set us free,
And made thy fiercest wrath abate:
Now let our hearts be turned to thee,
And thy salvation be complete.
3
Revive our dying graces, Lord,
And let thy saints in thee rejoice;
Make known thy truth, fulfill thy word:
We wait for praise to tune our voice.
4
We wait to hear what GOD will say;
He Will speak, and give his people peace:
But let them run no more astray,
Lest his returning wrath increase.
PSALM LXXXV. Ver. 9. etc. Second Part. Salvation by Christ.
1
SALVATION is forever nigh
The souls that fear and trust the Lord;
And grace descending from on high
Fresh hopes of glory shall afford.
2
Mercy and truth on all are met,
Since Christ the Lord came down from heaven:
By his obedience so complete
Justice is pleased, and peace is given.
3
Now truth and honor shall abound,
Religion dwell on earth again,
And heavenly influence bless the ground
In our Redeemer's gentler rain.
4
His righteousness is gone before,
To give us free access to GOD;
Our wandering feet shall stray no more,
But mark his steps, and keep the road.
PSALM LXXXVI. Ver, 8 -- 13. A general Song of Praise to GOD.
1
AMONG the princes, earthly gods,
There Is none has power divine;
Nor is there nature, mighty Lord,
Nor are their works like thine.
2
The nations, thou have made shall bring
Their offerings round thy throne;
For thou alone do wondrous things,
For thou art GOD alone.
3
Lord, I would walk with holy feet,
Teach me thine heavenly ways,
And all my wandering thoughts unite
In GOD my father's praise.
4
Great is thy mercy, and my tongue.
Shall those sweet wonders tell,
How by thy grace my sinking soul
Rose from the deeps of hell.
PSALM LXXXVII. The Church the Birth Place of the Saints; or Jews and Gentiles
united in the Christian Church.
1
GOD in his earthly temple lays
Foundation for his heavenly praise;
He liked the tents of Jacob well,
But still in Sion loves to dwell.
2
His mercy visits every house
That pay their night and morning vows;
But makes a more delightful stay,
Where churches meet to praise and pray.
3
What glories were described of old
What wonders are in Sion told!
Thou city of our GOD below,
Thy fame shall Tire and Egypt know*
4
Egypt and Tire, and Greek and Jew,
Shall there begin their lives anew:
Angels and men shall join to sing
The hill where living waters spring.
5
When GOD makes up his last account
Of natives in his holy mount,
'Twill be an honor to appear
As one newborn and nourished there.
PSALM LXXXVIII. As the 113th. Loss of Friends, and absence of Divine Grace.
1
O GOD of my salvation, hear
My nightly groan, my daily prayer,
That still employ my wasting breath;
My soul, declining to the grave,
Implores thy sovereign power to save
From dark despair and lasting death.
2
Thy wrath lies heavy on my soul,
And (...) of sorrows over me roll,
While dust and silence spread the gloom:
My friends, beloved in happier days,
The dear companions of my ways,
Descend around me to the tomb.
3
As, lost in lonely grief, I tread
The mournful mansions of the dead,
Or to some th^ong'd assembly go;
Through all alike I rove alone,
While, here for, ^ot and there unknown,
The change r^^ews my piercing woe.
4
And why will GOD neglect my call?
Or who shall profit by my fall,
When life departs and love expires?
Can dust and darkness praise the Lord?
Or wake, or brighten at his word,
And tune the harp with heavenly quires?
5
Yet through each melancholy day,
I Have prayed to thee, and still will pray,
Imploring still thy kind return --
But oh! my friends, my comforts, sted,
And all my kindred of the dead
Recall my wandering thoughts to mourn.
PSALM LXXXIX. First Part. Long Meter. The Covenant made with Christ; or, The
true David.
1
FOREVER shall my song record
The truth and mercy of the Lord;
Mercy and truth, forever stand
Like heaven established by his hand.
2
Thus to his Son he swear and said,
"With thee my covenant first is made;
"In thee shall dying sinners live;
"Glory and grace are thine to give.
3
"Be thou my prophet thou my priest;
"Thy children shall be ever blessed;
"Thou art my chosen king, thy throne
"Shall stand eternal like my own.
4
"There Is none of all my sons above
"So much my image or my love;
"Celestial powers thy subjects are,
"Then what can earth to thee compare?
5
" David, my servant, whom I chose,
"To guard my flock, to crush my foes;
"And raised him to the Jewish throne,
"Was but a shadow of my son.
6
Now let the church rejoice and sing
Jesus her savior and her king:
Angels his heavenly wonders show,
And saints declare his works below.
PSALM LXXXIX. First Part. Common Meter. The Faithfulness of GOD.
1
MY never-ceasing song shall show
The mercies of the Lord;
And make succeeding ages know
How faithful is his word.
2
The sacred truths his lips pronounce
Shall firm as heaven endure;
And if he speak a promise once,
The eternal grace is sure.
3
How long the race of David held
The promised Jewish throne!
But there is a nobler covenant sealed
To David's greater son.
4
His seed forever shall possess
A throne above the skies;
The meanest subjects of his grace
Shall to that glory rise.
5
Lord GOD of hosts, thy wondrous ways
Are sung by saints above;
And saints on earth their honors raise
To thy unchanging love.
PSALM LXXXIX.7, etc. Second Part. The Power and Majesty of GOD; or,
Reverential Worship.
^
WITH reverence let the saints appear,
And bow before the Lord,
His high commands with reverence hear,
And tremble at his word.
^
How terrible thy glories rise!
How bright thine armies shine!
Where is the power with thee that vies,
Or truth compared with thine?
3
The Northern pole and Southern rest
On thy supporting hand;
Darkness and day from East to West
Move round at thy command.
4
Thy word the raging winds control,
And rule the boisterous deep;
Thou make the sleeping billows roll,
The rolling billows sleep.
5
Heaven, earth, and air, and sea are thine,
And the dark world of hell;
They saw thine arm in vengeance shine
When Egypt durst rebel,
6
Justice and judgment are thy throne,
Yet wondrous is thy grace!
While truth and mercy joined in one,
Invite us near thy face.
PSALM LXXXIX.15, etc. Third Part. A Blessed Gospel
1
BLESSED are the souls who hear and know
The gospel's joyful sound!
Peace shall attend the path they go,
And light their steps surround.
Their joy shall bear their (...)
Through their Redeemer's name;
His righteousness exalts their hope,
And fills their foes with shame.
3
The Lord our glory and defense
Strength and salvation gives:
Israel, thy king forever reigns,
Thy GOD forever lives.
PSALM LXXXIX.19, etc. Fourth Part. Christ's Mediatorial Kingdom; or, His
divine and human Nature.
1
HEAR what the Lord in vision said,
And made his mercy known:
"Sinners, behold, your help is laid
"On my almighty son.
2
Behold the man my wisdom chose
Among your mortal race:
His head my holy oil overflows,
With full supplies of grace.
3
High shall he reign on David's throne,
My people's better king;
My arm shall beat his rivals down,
And still new subjects bring.
4
My truth shall guard him in his way
With mercy by his side;
While in my name over earth and sea
He shall in triumph ride.
5
Me for his father and his GOD,
He shall forever own,
Call me his rock, his high abode,
And I Will support my son.
6
My firstborn son arrayed in grace,
At my right hand shall sit,
Beneath him angels know their place,
And monarchs at his feet.
7
My covenant stands forever fast,
My promises are strong;
Firm as the heavens his throne shall last,
His seed endure as long.
PSALM LXXXIX, 30, etc. Fifth Part. The Covenant of Grace unchangeable; or,
Affliction without Rejection.
1
YET (says the Lord) if David's race,
The children of my son,
Should break my laws, abuse by grace
And tempt mine anger down;
2
Their sins I Will visit with the rod,
And make their folly smart;
But I Will not cease to be their GOD,
Nor from my truth depart.
3
My covenant I will never revoke,
But keep my grace in mind:
And what eternal love has spoke,
Eternal truth shall bind.
4
Once have I sworn, (I need no more)
And pledged my holiness,
To seal the sacred promise sure
To David and his race.
5
The sun shall see his offspring rise
And spread from sea to sea,
Long as he travels round the skies
To give the nations day.
6
Sure as the moon that rules the night
His kingdom shall endure,
Till the fixed laws of shade and light
Shall be observed no more.
PSALM LXXXIX.47, etc. Sixth Part. Long Meter. Mortality and Hope. A Funeral
Psalm.
1
REMEMBER, Lord, our mortal state,
How frail our life, how short our date!
Where is the man that draws his breath
Safe from disease, secure from death.
2
Lord, while we see whole nations die,
Our flesh and strength repine and cry,
"Must death forever rage and reign!
"Or have thou made mankind in vain?"
3
Where is thy promise to the just?
Are not thy servants turned to dust?
But faith forbids these mournful sighs,
And sees the sleeping dust arise.
4
That glorious hour, that dreadful day
Wipes the reproach of saints away,
And clears the honor of thy word:
Awake, our souls, and bless the Lord.
PSALM LXXXIX.47, etc. Last Part. As the 113 th Psalm. Life, Death, and the
Resurrection.
1
THINK, mighty GOD, on feeble man,
How few his hours, how short his span!
Short from the cradle to the grave:
Who can secure his vital breath
Against the bold demands of death
With skill to fly, or power to save?
2
Lord, shall it be forever said,
"The race of man was only made
"For sickness, sorrow and the dust"?
Are not thy servants day by day
Sent to their Graves, and turned to clay?
Lord, where is thy kindness to the just?
3
Have thou not promised to thy son,
And all his seed a heavenly crown?
But flesh and sense indulge despair;
Forever blessed be the Lord,
That faith can read his holy word,
And find a resurrection there.
4
Forever blessed be the Lord,
Who gives his saints a long reward,
For all their toil, reproach and pain;
Let all below, and all above,
Join to proclaim thy wondrous love,
And each repeat their loud Amen.
PSALM XC. Long Meter. Man Mortal, and GOD Eternal, A mournful Song at a
Funeral,
1
THROUGH every age, eternal GOD,
Thou art our rest, our safe abode:
High was thy throne ere heaven was made,
Or earth thy humble footstool laid
2
Long had thou reigned ere time began,
Or dust was fashioned to a man;
And long thy kingdom shall endure
When earth and time shall be no more*
3
But man, weak man, is born to die,
Made up of guilt and vanity:
Thy dreadful sentence, Lord, was just,
"Return ye sinners, to your dust."
4
[A thousand of our years amount
Scarce to a day in thine account.
Like yesterday's departed light;
Or the last watch of ending night.
PAUSE.

Death, like in overflowing stream,
Sweeps us away; our life's a dream*
An empty tale; a morning flower,
Cut down and withered in an hour.]
6
[Our age to seventy years is set;
How short the time! how frail the state!
And if to eighty we arrive,
We rather sigh, and groan than live.
7
But oh how often thy wrath appears,
And cuts off our expected years!
Thy wrath awakes our humble dread!
We fear the power that strikes us dead.]
8
Teach us, O Lord, how frail is man;
And kindly lengthen out the span,
'Till a wise care of piety
Fit us to die, and dwell with thee.
PSALM XC, 1 -- 5 First Part. Common Meter. Man frail, and GOD eternal.
1
OUR GOD, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.
2
Beneath the shadow of thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is thine arm alone,
And my defense is sure.
3
Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting thou art GOD,
To endless years the same.
4
Thy word commands our flesh to dust,
Return ye sons of men;
All nations rose from earth at first,
And turn to earth again.
5
A thousand ages in thy sight
Are like an evening gone*
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising dawn.
6
[The busy tribes of flesh and blood,
With all their lives and ears,
Are carried downwards by the flood,
And lost in following years.
7
Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
They fly, forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
8
Like flowery fields the nations stand
Pleased with the morning light;
The flowers beneath the mower's hand
Lie withering ere it is night.]
9
Our GOD, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be thou our guard while troubles last,
And our eternal home.
PSALM XC.8, 11, 2, 10, 12. Second Part. Common Meter. Infirmities and
Mortality the effect of sin; or, Life, old Age, and Preparation for Death.
1
LORD, if thine eyes survey our faults,
And justice grow severe,
Thy dreadful wrath exceeds our thoughts,
And burns beyond our fear.
2
Thine anger turns our frame to dust;
By one offense to thee,
Adam, with all his sons, have lost
Their immortality.
3
Life, like a vain amusement flies,
A fable or a song;
By swift degrees our nature dies,
Nor can our joys be long.
4
It Is but a few whose days amount
To threescore years and ten;
And all beyond that short account
Is sorrow, toil, and pain.
5
[Our vitals with laborious strife
Bear up the crazy load,
And drag these poor remains of life
Along the tiresome road.]
6
Almighty GOD; reveal thy love,
And not thy wrath alone:
Oh let our sweet experience prove
The mercies of thy throne.
7
Our Souls would learn the heavenly art
TO improve the hours we have,
That we may act the wiser part,
And live beyond the grave.
PSALM XC. Ver. 13, etc. Third Part. Common Meter. Breathing after Heaven.
1
RETURN, O GOD of love, return;
Earth is a tiresome place:
How long shall we thy children mourn
Our absence from thy face?
2
Let heaven succeed our painful years,
Let sin and sorrow cease,
And in proportion to our tears
So make our joys increase.
3
Thy wonders to thy servants show,
Make thy own work complete;
Then shall our souls thy glory know,
And own thy love was great.
4
Then shall we shine before thy throne
In all thy beauty, Lord:
And the po^^ ^e^vice we have done
Meet a divine reward.
PSALM XC. Ver. 5, 10.12, Short Meter. The Frailty and Shortness of Life.
1
LORD, what a feeble piece
Is this our mortal frame!
Our life how poor a trifle it is,
That scarce deserves the name!
2
Alas, the brittle clay
That built our body first!
And every month and every day
It Is mouldering back to dust.
3
Our moments fly apace,
Our feeble powers decay,
Swift as a flood our hasty days
Are sweeping us away.
4
Yet, if our days must fly,
We'll keep their end in sight,
We'll spend them all in wisdom's way,
And let them speed their flight.
5
They Will wast us sooner over
This life's tempestuous sea;
Soon we shall reach the peaceful shore
Of blessed eternity.
PSALM XCI.1 -- 7. First Part: Safety in public Diseases and Dangers
1
HE that has made his refuge GOD,
Shall find a most secure abode;
Shall walls all day beneath his shade,
And there at night shall rest his head.
2
Then will I say, "my GOD, thy power
"Shall be my fortress and my tower:
"I that am formed of feeble dust
"Make thine Almighty arm my trust."
3
Thrice happy man! thy Maker's care
Shall keep thee from the fowler's snare;
From Satan's wiles, who still betrays
Unguarded souls a thousand ways.
4
Just as a hen protects her brood,
From birds of prey that seek their blood,
The Lord his faithful saints shall guard,
And endless life be their reward.
5
If burning beams of noon conspire
To dart a pestilential fire;
GOD is their life, his wings are spread
To shield them with an healthful shade.
6
If vapors with malignant breath
Rise thick, and scatter midnight death,
Israel is safe: the poisoned air
Grows pure, if Israel's GOD be there.
PAUSE.

7
What though a thousand at thy side,
Around thy path ten thousand died,
Thy GOD his chosen people saves
Amongst the dead, amidst the graves.
8
So when he sent his angel down
To make his wrath in Egypt known,
And slew their sons, his careful eye
Past all the doors of Jacob by.
9
But if the fire, or plague, or sword,
Receive commission from the Lord,
To strike his saints among the rest,
Their very pains and deaths are blessed.
10
The sword, the pestilence, or fire
Shall but fulfill their best desire;
From sins and sorrows set them free,
And bring thy children, Lord, to thee.
PSALM XCI.9 -- 16. Second Part. Protection from Death, Guard of Angels,
Victory and Deliverance.
1
YE sons of men, a feeble race,
Exposed to every snare,
Come make the Lord your dwelling place
And try, and trust his care.
2
No ill shall enter where you dwell;
Or if the plague come nigh,
And sweep the wicked down to hell,
'Twill raise the saints on high.
3
He Will give his angels charge to keep
Your feet in all their ways;
To watch your pillow while you sleep,
And guard your happy days.
4
Their hands shall bear you, lest you fall
And dash against the stones;
Are they not servants at his call,
And sent to attend his sons?
5
Adders and lions ye sha'l tread;
The tempter's wiles defeat:
He that has broke the serpent's head
Puts him beneath your feet.
6
"Because on me they set their love,
"I Will save them, says the Lord;
"I Will bear their joyful souls above,
"Destruction and the sword.
7
"My grace shall answer when they call
"In trouble I Will be nigh:
"My power shall help them when they fall,
"And raise them when they die.
8
"Those that on earth my name have known,
"I Will honor them in heaven;
"There my salvation shall be shown,
"And endless life be given."
PSALM XCII. First Part. A Psalm for the Lord's Day.
1
SWEET is the work, my GOD, my king,
To praise thy name give thanks and sing,
To show thy love by morning light,
And talk of all thy truth at night.
2
Sweet is the day of sacred rest,
No mortal care shall seize my breast,
Oh may my heart in tune be found,
Like David's harp of solemn sound.
3
My heart shall triumph in my Lord,
And bless his works, and bless his word;
Thy works of grace how bright they shine!
How deep thy counsels! how divine!
4
Fools never raise their thoughts so high;
Like brutes they live, like brutes they die;
Like grass they flourish, 'till thy breath
Blast them in everlasting death.
5
But I shall share a glorious part
When grace has well refined my heart,
And ^^esh supplies of joy are shed
Like holy oil to cheer my head.
6
Sin (my worst enemy before)
Shall vex my eyes and ears no more:
My inward foes shall all be slain,
Nor satan break my peace again.
7
Then shall I see and hear and know
All I desired, or wished below;
And every power find sweet employ
In that eternal world of joy.
PSALM XCII. Ver. 12, etc. Second Part. The Church is the Garden of GOD.
1
LORD, it is a pleasant thing to stand
In gardens planted by thine hand;
(...) ^e within thy courts be seen
Like a young cedar, fresh and green.
2
There grow thy saints in faith and lo^^
Blessed with thine influence from above*
Not Lebanon with all its trees
Yields such a comely sight as these.
3
The plants of grace shall ever live;
(Nature decays, but grace must thrive)
Time, that does all things else impair,
Still makes them flourish strong and fair.
4
Laden with fruits of age they show,
The Lord is holy just and true;
None that attend his gates shall find
A God unfaithful or unkind.
PSALM XCIII. 1st Meter. As the 100th Psalm. The Eternal and the Sovereign GOD.
1
JEHOVAH reigns: he dwells in light,
Girded with majesty and might:
The world created by his hands
Still on its first foundation stands.
2
But ere this spacious world was made
Or had its first foundation laid,
Thy throne eternal ages stood,
Thy self the ever-living GOD.
3
Like floods the angry nations rise,
And aim their rage against the skies
Vain floods, that aim their rage so high!
At thy rebuke the billows die.
4
Forever shall thy throne endure;
Thy promise stands forever sure;
And everlasting holiness
Becomes the dwellings of thy grace.
PSALM XCIII. 2d Meter. As the old 50th Psalm.
1
THE Lord of glory reigns, he reigns o^ (...);
His robes of state are strength and m^
This wide creation rose at his command,
Built by his word and stablish'd by his hand.
Long stood his throne ere he began creation,
And his own godhead is the firm foundation.
2
GOD is the eternal king; Thy foes in vain
Raise their rebellions to confound thy reign;
In vain the storms, in vain the floods arise,
And roar, and toss their waves against the skies;
Foaming at heaven they rage with wild commotion
But heaven's high arches scorn the swelling ocean.
3
Ye tempests rage no more; ye floods be still,
And the mad world submissive to his will:
Built on his truth his church must ever stand:
Firm are his promises, and strong his hand;
See his own sons, when they appear before him,
Bow at his footstool, and with fear adore him.
PSALM XCIII. 3 d. Meter. As the Old 122d Psalm.
1
THE Lord Jehovah reigns,
And royal state maintains,
His head with awful glories crowned;
Aray'd in robes of light,
Begirt with sovereign might,
And rays of majesty around.
2
Upheld by thy commands
The world securely stands,
And skies and stars obey thy word;
Thy throne was fixed on high
Ere stars adorned the sky.
Eternal is thy kingdom, Lord.
3
In vain the noisy crowd,
Like billows fierce and loud.
Against thine empire rage and roar;
In vain with angry spite
The surly nations fight,
And dash like waves against the shore.
4
Let floods and nations rage.
And all their power engage,
Let swelling tides assault the sky;
The terrors of thy frown
Shall beat their madness down;
Thy throne forever stands on high.
5
Thy promises are true,
Thy grace is ever new,
There fixed thy church shall never remove;
Thy saints with holy fear
Shall in thy courts appear,
And sing thine everlasting love.
Repeat the fourth Stanza to complete the Tune.

PSALM XCIV.1, 2, 7, -- 14. First Part. Saints chastised, and Sinners
destroyed; or, Instructive Afflictions.
1
O GOD! to whom revenge belongs,
Proclaim thy wrath aloud;
Let sovereign power redress our wrongs,
Let justice smite the proud.
2
They say, " The Lord nor sees nor hears;"
When will the vain be wise?
Can he be deaf, who formed their ears?
Or blind, who made their eyes?
3
He knows their impious thoughts are vain,
And they shall feel his power:
His wrath shall pierce their souls with pain
In some surprising hour.
4
But if thy saints deserve rebuke,
Thou have a gentler rod;
Thy providence, thy sacred book
Shall make them know their GOD.
5
Blessed is the man thy hands chastise,
And to his duty draw;
Thy scourges make thy children wise
When they forget thy law.
6
But GOD will never cast often his saints,
Nor his own promise break;
He pardons his inheritance
For their Redeemer's sake.
PSALM XCIV. Ver. 16 -- 23. Second Part. GOD our Support and Comfort; or
Deliverance from Temptation and Persecution.
1
WHO will arise and plead my right
Against my numerous foes?
While earth and hell their force unite,
And all my hopes oppose.
2
Had not the Lord, my rock, my help,
Sustained my fainting head,
My life had now in silence dwelt,
My soul amongst the dead.
3
Alas! my sliding feet! I cried,
Thy promise bore me up
Thy grace stood constant by my side,
And raised my sinking hope.
4
While multitudes of mournful thoughts
Within my bosom roll,
Thy boundless love forgives my faults,
Thy comforts cheer my soul.
5
Powers of iniquity may rise,
And frame pernicious laws;
But GOD my refuge rules the skies,
He will defend my cause.
6
Let malice vent her rage aloud,
Let bold blasphemers scoff;
The Lord our GOD shall judge the proud,
And cut the sinners off.
PSALM XCV. Common Meter. A Psalm before Prayer.
1
SING to the Lord, Jehovah's name,
And in his strength rejoice;
When his salvation is our theme,
Exalted be our voice.
2
With thanks approach his awful sight,
And psalms of honor sing;
The Lord's a GOD of boundless might,
The whole creation's King.
3
Let princes hear, let angels know,
How mean their natures seem,
Those gods on high, and gods below,
When once compared with him.
4
Earth, with its caverns dark and deep,
Lies in his spacious hand;
He fixed the seas what bounds to keep*
And where the hills must stand.
5
Come, and with humble souls adore,
Come, kneel before his face;
Oh may the creatures of his power
Be children of his grace!
6
Now is the time, he bends his ear,
And waits for your request;
Come, lest he rouse his wrath, and swear,
"Ye shall not see my rest."
PSALM XCV, Short Meter. A Psalm before Sermon.
1
COME, sound his praise abroad,
And hymns of glory sing:
Jehovah is the sovereign GOD,
The universal King.
2
He formed the deeps unknown;
He gave the seas their bound;
The watery worlds are all his own,
And all the solid ground.
3
Come, worship at his throne,
Come, bow before the Lord;
We are his works, and not our own;
He formed us by his word.
4
To day attend his voice,
Nor dare provoke his rod;
Come, like the people of his choice,
And own your gracious GOD.
5
But if your ears refuse
The language of his grace,
And hearts grow hard like stubborn Jews,
That unbelieving race;
6
The Lord in vengeance dressed
Will lift his hand, and swear,
"You that despise my promised rest,
"Shall have no portion there."
PSALM XCV.1, 2, 3, 6 -- 11. Long Meter* Canaan lost through Unbelief; or, a
Warning to delaying Sinners.
1

A sacred song of solemn praise:
GOD is a sovereign King; rehearse
His honor in exalted verse.
2
Come, let our souls address the Lord,
Who frain'd our natures with his word,
He is our shepherd; we the sheep
His mercy chose, his pastures keep.
3
Come, let us hear his voice today,
The counsels of his love obey,
Nor let our hardened hearts renew
The sins and plagues that Israel knew.
4
Israel, that saw his works of grace
Yet tempt their Maker to his face;
A faithless unbelieving brood,
That tired the patience of their GOD.
5
Thus says the Lord, " How false they prove!
"Forget my power, abuse my love;
"Since they despise my rest, I swear,
"Their feet shall never enter there."
6
[Look back, my soul, with holy dread,
And view those ancient rebels dead;
Attend the offered grace to day,
Nor lose the blessings by delay.
7
Seize the kind promise while it waits,
And march to Zion's heavenly gates;
Believe, and take the promised rest;
Obey, and be forever blessed.]
PSALM XCVI.2, 10, etc. Common Meter. CHRIST'S first and second Coming.
1
SING to the Lord, ye distant lands,
Ye, tribes of every tongue;
His new discovered grace demands
A new and nobler song.
2
Say to the nations, Jesus reigns,
GOD's own Almighty Son;
His power the sinking world sustains,
And grace surrounds his throne.
3
Let heaven proclaim the joyful day,
Joy through the earth be seen;
Let cities shine in bright array,
And fields in cheerful green.
4
The joyous earth, the bending skies
His glorious train display;
Ye mountains sink, ye valleys rise,
Prepare the Lord his way.
5
Behold he comes, he comes to bless
The nations as their GOD;
To show the world his righteousness,
And send his truth abroad.
6
His voice shall raise the slumbering dead,
And ^id the world draw near;
But how will guilty nations dread,
To see their judge appear!
PSALM XCVII. As the 113th Psalm. The GOD of the Gentiles,
1
LET all the earth their voices raise,
To sing the choicest psalm of praise,
To sing and bless Jehovah's name:
His glory let the heathens know
His wonders to the nations show
And all his saving works proclaim.
2
The heathens know thy glory, Lord,
The wondering nations read thy word,
But here Jehovah's name is known:
Nor shall our worship ever be paid
To gods which mortal hands have made*
Our Maker is our GOD alone.
3
He framed the globe, he built the sky,
He made the shining worlds on high,
And reigns complete in glory there
His beams are majesty and light;
His beauties how divinely bright!
His temple how divinely fair!
4
Come the great day, the glorious hour,
When earth shall feel his saving power,
And barbarous nations fear his name:
Then shall the race of men confess
The beauty of his holiness,
And in his courts his grace proclaim.
PSALM XCVII..1 -- 5 First Part. Christ reigning in Heaven, and coming to
Judgment.
1
HE reigns; the Lord, the Savior reigns!
Praise him in evangelic strains:
Let the whole earth in songs rejoice,
And distant islands join their voice.
2
Deep are his counsels and unknown;
But grace and truth support his throne:
Though gloomy clouds his ways surround:
Justice is their eternal ground.
3
In robes of judgment, lo, he comes,
Shakes the wide earth and cleaves the tombs;
Before him burns devouring fire,
The mountains melt, the sea^ retire.
4
His enemies with sore dismay,
Fly from the sight, and shun the day;
Then lift your heads, ye saints, on high,
And sing, for your redemptions's nigh.
PSALM XCVII.6 -- 9. Second Part. Christ's Incarnation.
1
THE LORD is come; the heavens proclaim
His birth; the nations learn his name;
An unknown star directs the road
Of eastern sages to their GOD.
2
All ye bright armies of the skies,
Go, worship where the Savior lies:
Angels and kings before him bow,
Those gods on high, and gods below.
3
Let idols totter to the ground,
And their own worshipers confound:
But Zion shall his glories sing,
And earth confess her sovereign king.
PSALM XCVII. Third Part. Grace and Glory.
1
THE Almighty reigns exalted high
Over all the earth, over all the sky;
Though clouds and darkness veil his feet,
His dwelling is the mercy-seat.
2
O ye that love his holy name,
Hate every work of sin and shame:
He guards the souls of all his friends,
And from the snares of hell defends.
3
Immortal light, and joys unknown,
Are for the saints in darkness sown;
Those glorious seeds shall spring and rise,
And the bright harvest bless our eyes.
4
Rejoice, ye righteous, and record
The sacred honors of the Lord;
None but the soul that feels his grace*
Can triumph in his holiness.
PSALM XCVII.3.5, -- 7, 11. Common Meter. Christ's Incarnation and the last
Judgment.
1
LET earth, with every isle and sea
Rejoice, the Savior reigns:
His word like fire prepares his way,
And mountains melt to plains.
2
His presence sinks the proudest hills,
And makes the valleys rise;
The humble soul enjoys his smiles,
The haughty sinner dies.
3
The heavens his rightful power proclaim;
The idol-gods around
Fill their own worshipers with shame,
And totter to the ground.
4
Adoring angels at his birth
Make the Redeemer known;
Thus shall he come to judge the earth,
And angels guard his throne.
5
His foes shall tremble at his sight,
And hills and seas retire:
His children take their unknown flight,
And leave the ^orld in fire.
6
The seeds of joy and glory sown
For saints in darkness here,
Shall rise and spring in worlds unknown,
And a rich harvest bear.
PSALM XCVIII. First Part. Praise for the Gospel.
1
TO our Almighty Maker, GOD,
New honors be addressed;
His great salvation shines abroad,
And makes the nations blessed.
2
To Abraham first he spoke the word,
And taught his numerous race;
The gentiles own him sovereign Lord,
And learn to trust his grace.
3
Let the whole earth his love proclaim
With all her different tongues;
And spread the honor of his name
In melody and songs.
PSALM XCVIII. Second Part. The Messiah's Coming and Kingdom.
1
JOY to the world; the Lord is come;
Let earth receive her King:
Let every heart prepare him room,
And heaven and nature sing.
2
Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains,
Repeat the sounding joy.
3
No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make his blessings flow,
Far as the curse is found.
4
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness,
And wonders of his love.
PSALM XCIX. First Part. Christ's Kingdom and Majesty.
1
THE GOD Jehovah reigns,
Let all the nations fear;
Let sinners tremble at his throne,
And saints be humble there.
2
Jesus the Savior reigns,
Let earth adore its Lord;
Bright cherubs his attendants stand,
Swift to fulfill his word.
3
In Zion stands his throne,
His honors are divine,
His church shall make his wonders known,
For there his glories shine.
4
How holy is his name!
How terrible his praise!
Justice and truth, and judgment join
In all his works of grace.
PSALM XCIX. Second Part. A holy GOD worshipped with Reverence.
1
EXALT the Lord our GOD,
And worship at his feet,
His nature is all holiness,
And mercy is his seat.
2
When Israel was his church,
When Aaron was his priest,
When Moses cried, when Samuel prayed,
He gave his people rest.
3
Often he forgave their sins;
Nor would destroy their race;
And often he made his vengeance known
When they abused his grace.
4
Exalt the Lord our GOD,
Whose grace is still the same;
Still he is a GOD of holiness,
And jealous for his name.
PSALM C. First Meter. A plain Translation* Praise to our Creator.
1
YE nations, round the earth, rejoice
Before the Lord, your sovereign King:
Serve him with cheerful heart and voice,
With all your tongues his glory sing.
^
The Lord is GOD: it is he alone
Does life and breath, and being give:
We are his work, and not our own;
The sheep that on his pastures live.
^
Enter his gates with songs of joy,
With praises to his courts repair;
And make it your divine employ
To pay your thanks and honors there.
4
The Lord is good, the Lord is kind;
Great is his grace, his mercy sure,
And the whole race of man shall find
His truth from age to age endure.
PSALM C. Second Meter. A Paraphrase.
1
BEFORE Jehovah's awful throne,
Ye nations, bow with sacred joy:
Know that the Lord is GOD alone;
He can create, and he destroy.
2
His sovereign power without our aid
Made us of clay, and formed us men:
And when like wandering sheep we strayed,
He brought us to his fold again.
3
We are his people, we his care,
Our souls, and all our mortal frame:
What lasting honors shall we rear,
Almighty Maker, to thy name?
4
We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,
High as the heaven, our voices raise;
And earth with her ten thousand tongues
Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.
5
Wide as the world is thy command,
Vast as eternity thy love?
Firm as a rock thy truth must stand,
When rolling years shall cease to move.
PSALM CI. Long Meter. The Magistrate's Psalm.
1
MERCY and judgment are my song;
And since they both to thee belong,
My gracious GOD, my righteous King,
To thee my songs and vows I bring.
2
If I am raised to bear the sword,
I Will take my counsel from thy word,
Thy justice and thy heavenly grace
Shall be the pattern of my ways.
3
Let wisdom all my actions guide,
And let my GOD with me reside:
No wicked thing shall dwell with me,
Which may provoke thy jealousy.
4
No sons of slander, rage and strife
Shall be companions of my life;
The haughty look, the heart of pride
Within my doors shall never abide
5
[I'll search the land and raise the just
To posts of honor, wealth and trust:
The men that work thy holy will
Shall be my friends and favorites still.]
6
In vain shall sinners hope to rise
By flattering or malicious lies:
Nor, while the innocent I guard,
Shall bold offenders ever be spared.
7
The impious crew (that factions band)
Shall hide their heads, or quit the land;
And all that break the public rest,
Where I have power shall be suppressed;
PSALM CI. Common Meter. A Psalm for a Master of a Family.
1
OF justice and of grace I sing,
And pay my GOD my vows,
Thy grace and justice, heavenly King,
Teach me to rule my house.
2
Now to my tent, O GOD, repair,
And make thy servant wise;
I Will suffer nothing near me there
That shall offend thine eyes.
3
The man that does his Neighbor wrong
By falsehood or by force,
The scornful eye, the slanderous tongue,
I Will thrust him from my doors.
4
I Will seek the faithful and the just,
And will their help enjoy;
These are the friends that I shall trust,
The servants I Will employ.
5
The wretch that deals in sly deceit
I Will not endure a night;
The liar's tongue I ever hate,
And banish from my sight.
6
I Will purge my family around,
And make the wicked flee;
So shall my house be ever found
A dwelling fit for thee.
PSALM CII.1, -- 13, 20.21. First Part. A Prayer of the Afflicted.
1
HEAR me, O God, nor hide thy face,
But answer, lest I die:
Have thou not built a throne of grace.
To hear when sinners cry?
2
My days are wasted like the smoke
Dissolving in the air;
My strength is dried, my heart is broke.
And sinking in despair.
3
My spirits flag like withering grass
Burnt with excessive heat:
In secret groans my minutes pass,
And I forget to eat.
4
As on some lonely building's top,
The sparrow tells her moan,
Far from the tents of joy and hope
I sit and grieve alone.
5
My soul is like a wilderness,
Where beasts of midnight howl;
Where the sad raven finds her place,
And where the screaming owl.
6
Dark dismal thoughts and boding fears
Dwell in my troubled, beast;
While sharp reproaches wound my ears,
Nor give my spirit rest.
7
My cup is mingled with my woes,
And tears are my repast:
My daily bread like ashes grows
Unpleasant to my taste.
8
Sense can afford no real joy
To souls that feel thy frown;
Lord 'twas thy hand advanced me high,
Thy hand has cast me down.
9
My looks like withered leaves appear;
And life's declining light
Grows faint as evening-shadows are,
That vanish into night.
10
But thou forever art the same,
O my eternal GOD;
Ages to come shall know thy name,
And spread thy works abroad.
11
Thou will arise, and show thy face,
Nor will my Lord delay,
Beyond the appointed hour of grace,
That long expected day.
12
He hears his saints* he knows their cry,
And by mysterious ways,
Redeems the prisoners, doomed to die,
And fills their tongues with praise.
PSALM CII.133 -- 21. Second Part. Prayer heard, and Zion restored.
1
LET Zion, and her sons rejoice,
Behold the promised hour:
Her GOD has heard her mourning voice,
And comes to exalt his power.
2
Her dust and ruins that remain,
Are precious in our eyes;
Those ruins shall be built again,
And all that dust shall rise.
3
The Lord will raise Jerusalem,
And stand in glory there;
Nations shall bow before his name,
And kings attend with fear.
4
He fits a sovereign on his throne,
With pity in his eyes:
He hears the dying prisoners' groan,
And sees their sighs arise.
5
He frees the souls condemned to death,
And when his saints complain,
It shall not be said, "That praying breath
"Was ever spent in vain."
6
This shall be known when we are dead,
And left on long record;
That ages yet unborn may read,
And trust, and praise the Lord.
PSALM CII.23 -- 28. Third Part. Man's Mortality, and Christ's Eternity; or,
Saints die, but Christ and the Church live.
1
IT is the Lord our Savior's hand
Weakens our strength amidst the race;
Disease and death at his command
Arrest us, and cut short our days.
2
Spare us, O Lord, aloud we pray,
Nor let our sun go down at noon;
Thy years are one eternal day,
And must thy children die so soon?
3
Yet in the midst of death and grief
This thought our sorrow shall assuage;
"Our Father and our Savior live;
"Christ is the same through every age."
4
'Twas he this earth's foundation laid;
Heaven is the building of his hand;
This earth grows old, these heavens shall fade;
And all be changed at his command.
5
The starry curtains of the sky
Like garments shall be laid aside:
But still thy throne stands firm and high;
Thy church forever must abide.
6
Before thy face thy church shall live;
And on thy throne thy children reign;
This dying world shall they survive,
And the dead saints be raised again.
PSALM CIII.1 -- 7. First Part. Long Meter. Blessing GOD for his Goodness to
Soul and Body.
1
BLESS, O my soul, the living GOD,
Call home thy thoughts that rove abroad
Let all the powers within me join
In work and worship so divine.
2
Bless, O my soul, the GOD of grace;
His favors claim thy highest praise:
Why should the wonders he has wrought
Be lost in silence, and forgot?
3
It Is he, my soul, that sent his Son
To die for crimes, which thou have done:
He owns the ransom, and forgives
The hourly follies of our lives.
4
The vices of the mind he heals,
And cures the pains that nature feels
Redeems the soul from hell, and saves
Our wasting life from threatening graves.
5
Our youth decayed his power repairs;
His mercy crowns our growing years:
He fills our store with every good,
And feeds our souls with heavenly food.
6
He sees the oppressor and the oppressed,
And often gives the sufferers rest:
But will his justice more display
In the last great rewarding day.
7
[His power he showed by Moses' hands,
And gave to Israel his commands;
But sent his truth and mercy down
To all the nations by his Son.]
8
Let the whole earth his power confess,
Let the whole earth adore his grace;
The Gentile with, the Jew shall join
In work and worship so divine.
PSALM CIII. Second Part. Long Meter. GOD's gentle Chastisement; or, his tender
Mercy to his People.
1
THE Lord, how wondrous are his ways!
How firm his truth! how large his grace!
He takes his mercy for his throne,
And thence he makes his glories known.
2
Not half so high his power has spread
The starry heavens above our head,
As his rich love exceeds our praise,
Exceeds the highest hopes we raise.
3
Not half so far has nature placed
The rising morning from the west
As his forgiving grace removes
The daily guilt of those he loves.
4
How slow his awful wrath to rise!
On swifter wings salvation flies;
And if he lets his anger burn,
How soon his frowns to pity turn!
5
Amidst his wrath compassion shines;
His strokes are lighter than our sins:
And while his rod corrects his saints,
His ear indulges their complaints.
6
So fathers their young sons chastise;
With gentle hands and melting eyes:
The children weep beneath the smart,
And move the pity of their heart.
PAUSE.

7
The mighty GOD, the wise and just,
Knows that our frame is feeble dust;
And will no heavy loads impose
Beyond the strength that he bestows.
8
He knows how soon our nature dies,
Blasted by every wind that flies;
Like grass we spring, and die as soon,
Or morning flowers that fade at noon.
9
But his eternal love is sure
To all the saints, and shall endure:
From age to age his truth shall reign,
Nor children's children hope in vain.
PSALM CIII, 1 -- 7. First Part. Short Meter. Praise for Spiritual and Temporal
Mercies.
1
OH Bless the Lord, my soul!
Let all within me join,
And aid my tongue to bless his name,
Whose favors are divine.
2
Oh bless the Lord, my soul;
Nor let his mercies lie,
Forgotten in unthankfulness;
And without praises die.
3
It Is he forgives thy sins,
It Is he relieves thy pain,
It Is he that heals thy sicknesses,
And makes thee young again.
4
He crowns thy life with love,
When ransomed from the grave;
He that redeemed my soul from hell
Has sovereign power to save.
5
He fills the poor with good;
He gives the sufferers rest;
The Lord has judgments for the proud,
And justice for the oppressed.
6
His wondrous works and ways.
He made by Moses known;
But sent the world his truth and grace
By his beloved son.
PSALM CIII.8 -- 18. Second Part. Short Meter. Abounding Compassion of GOD; or,
Mercy in the midst of Judgment.
1
MY soul, repeat his praise,
Whose mercies are so great;
Whose anger is so slow to rise,
So ready to abate.
2
GOD will not always chide;
And when his strokes are felt,
His strokes are fewer than our crimes,
And lighter than our guilt.
3
High as the heavens are raised.
Above the ground we tread,
So far the riches of his grace
Our highest thoughts exceed.
4
His power subdues our sins,
And his forgiving love
Far as the east is from the west,
Does all our guilt remove.
5
The pity of the Lord
To those that fear his name,
Is such as tender parents feel;
He knows our feeble frame.
6
He knows we are but dust,
Scattered with every breath:
His anger like a rising wind
Can send us swift to death.
7
Our days are as the grass,
Or like the morning flower!
If one sharp blast sweep over the field,
It withers in an hour.
8
But thy compassions, Lord,
To endless years endure;
And children's children ever find
Thy words of promise sure.
PSALM CIII.^^ -- 22. Third Part. Short Met^^. God's universal Dominion; or,
Angels praise the Lord.
1
THE Lord, the sovereign king,
Has fixed his throne on high,
Over all the heavenly world he rules,
And all beneath the sky.
2
Ye angels, great in might,
And swift to do his will,
Bless ye the Lord, whose voice ye hear,
Whose pleasure ye fulfill.
3
Let the bright hosts, who wait
The orders of their king,
And guard his churches when they pray,
Join in the praise they sing.
4
While all his wondrous works,
Through his vast kingdom, show
Their Maker's glory, thou, my soul,
Shall sing his graces too.
PSALM CIV. The Glory of God in Creation and Providence*
1
MY soul, thy great Creator praise;
When clothed in his celestial rays,
He in full majesty appears,
And like a robe his glory wears.
Note, This Psalm may be sung to the Tune of the Old 112th or 127th Psalm, by
adding these two Lines to every Stanza, (viz.)

Great is the Lord; what tongue can frame
An equal honor to his name?
[Otherwise it must be sung as the 100th Psalm.]

2
The heavens are for his curtains spread;
The unfathomed deep he makes his bed;
Clouds are his chariot when he flies.
On winged storms across the skies.
3
Angels, whom his own breath inspires*
His ministers, are flaming fires;
And swift as thought their armies move
To bear his vengeance or his love.
4
The world's foundation by his hand
Are poised and shall forever stand:
He binds the ocean in his chain,
Lest it should drown the earth again.
5
When earth was covered with the flood,
Which high above the mountains stood,
He thundered and the ocean fled*
Confined to its appointed bed.
6
The swelling billows know their bound,
And in their channels walk their round;
Yet thence conveyed by secret veins,
They spring on hills, and drench the plains.
7
He bids the crystal fountains flow,
And cheer the valleys as they go;
There gentle herds their thirst allay,
And for the stream wild asses bray.
8
From pleasant trees which shade the brink,
The lark and linnet light to drink;
Their songs the lark and linnet raise,
And chide our silence in his praise.
PAUSE I.

9
GOD from his cloudy cistern pours
On the parched earth enriching showers;
The grove, the garden, and the field,
A thousand joyful blessings yield.
10
He makes the graffy food arise,
And gives the cattle large supplies;
With herbs for man of various power,
To nourish nature, or to cure.
11
What noble fruit the vines produce!
The olive yields a pleasing juice;
Our hearts are cheered with generous wine,
His gifts proclaim his love divine.
12
His bounteous hands our table spread,
He fills our cheerful stores with bread;
While food our vital strength imparts,
Let daily praise inspire our hearts.
PAUSE II.

13
Behold the stately cedar stands
Raised in the forest by his hands;
Birds to the boughs for shelter fly,
And build their nests secure on high.
14
To craggy hills ascends the goat;
And at the airy mountain's foot
The feebler creatures make their cell;
He gives them wisdom where to dwell.
15
He sets the sun his circling race,
Appoints the moon to change her face;
And when thick darkness veils the day,
Calls out wild beasts to hunt their prey.
16
Fierce lions lead their young abroad,
And roaring ask their meat from GOD;
But when the morning-beams arise,
The savage beast to covert flies.
17
Then man to daily labor goes;
The night was made for his repose:
Sleep is thy gift, that sweet relief
From tiresome toil and wasting grief.
18
How strange thy works! how great thy skill!
While every land thy riches fill:
Thy wisdom round the world we see,
This spacious earth is full of thee.
19
Nor less thy glories in the deep,
Where fish in millions swim and creep,
With wondrous motions, swift or slow,
Still wandering in the paths below.
20
There ships divide their watery way,
And flocks of scaly monsters play;
The huge Leviathan resides,
And fearless sports amid the tides.
PAUSE III.

21
Vast are thy works, Almighty Lord,
All nature rests upon thy word,
And the whole race of creatures stands,
Waiting their portion from thy hands.
22
While each receives his different food,
Their cheerful looks pronounce it good:
Eagles and bears, and whales and worms
Rejoice and ^raise in different forms.
23
But when thy face is hid they mourn,
And dying to their dust return;
Both man and beast their souls resign:
Life, breath and spirit, all are thine.
24
Yet thou can breathe on dust again,
And fill the world with beasts and men;
A word of thy creating breath
Repairs the wastes of time and death.
25
His works, the wonders of his might,
Are honored with his own delight:
How awful are his glorious Ways!
The Lord is dreadful in his praise.
26
The earth stands trembling at thy stroke,
And at thy touch the mountains smoke;
Yet humble souls may see thy face,
And tell their wants to sovereign grace.
27
In thee my hopes and wishes meet,
And make my meditations sweet;
Thy praises shall my breath employ
Till it expire in endless joy.
28
While haughty sinners die accursed,
Their glory buried with their dust,
I to my GOD, my heavenly King
Immortal Hallelujahs sing.
PSALM CV. Abridged. God's Conduct of Israel, and the Plagues of Egypt.
1
GIVE thanks to GOD, invoke his name,
And tell the world his grace;
Sound through the earth his deeds of fame,
That all may seek his face.
2
His covenant which he kept in mind
For numerous ages past,
To numerous ages yet behind
In equal force shall last.
3
He swear to Abraham and his seed,
And made the blessing sure:
Gentiles the ancient promise read,
And find his truth endure.
4
"Thy seed shall make all nations blessed,
(Said the Almighty voice)
"And Canaan's land shall be their rest,
"The type of heavenly joys.
5
[How large the grant! how rich the grace!
To give them Canaan's land,
When they were strangers in the place,
A small and feeble band!
6
Like pilgrims through the countries round
Securely they removed:
And haughty kings that on them frowned
Severely he reproved.
7
"Touch mine anointed, and mine arm
"Shall soon avenge the wrong:
"The man that does my prophets harm
"Shall know their GOD is strong."
8
Then let the world forbear its rage,
Nor put the church in fear:
Israel must live through every age,
And be the Almighty's care.
PAUSE I.

9
When Pharaoh dared to vex the saints,
And thus provoked their GOD,
Moses was sent at their complaints,
Armed with his dreadful rod.
10
He called for darkness: darkness came
Like an o'erwhelming flood;
He turned each lake and every stream
To lakes and streams of blood.
11
He gave the sign, and noisome flies
Through the whole country spread;
And frogs in baleful armies rise
About the monarch's bed,
12
Through fields and towns and palaces
The tenfold vengeance flew;
Locusts in swarms devoured their trees
And hail their cattle slew.
13
Then by an Angel's midnight stroke
The flower of Egypt died;
The strength of every house was broke,
Their glory and their pride.
14
Now let the world forbear its rage,
Nor put the church in fear;
Israel must live through every age,
And be the Almighty's care.
PAUSE II.

15
Thus were the tribes from bondage freed,
And left the hated ground;
Rich with Egyptian spoils they fled,
Nor was one feeble found.
16
The Lord himself chose out their way,
And marked their journeys right,
Gave them a leading cloud by day,
A firey guide by night.
17
They thirst; and waters from the rock
In rich abundance flow,
And following still the course they took
Ran all the desert through.
18
O wondrous stream! O blessed type
Of ever-flowing grace!
So Christ our rock maintains our life
And aids our wandering race.
19
Thus gaurded by the Almighty hand,
The chosen tribes possessed
Canaan the rich, the promised land,
And there enjoyed their rest.
20
Then let the world forbear its rage,
The church renounce her fear;
Israel must live through every age,
And be the Almighty's care.
PSALM CVI.1, -- 5. First Part. Praise to GGD; or, Communication with Saints.
1
TO GOD, the great, the ever blessed,
Let Songs of honor be addressed;
His mercy firm forever stands;
Give him the thanks his love demands.
2
Who knows the wonders of thy ways?
Who shall fulfill thy boundless praise?
Blessed are the souls that fear thee still,
And pay their duty to thy will.
3
Remember what thy mercy did
For Jacob's Race, thy chosen seed;
And with the same salvation bless
The meanest suppliant of thy grace.
4
Oh may I see thy tribes rejoice,
And aid their triumphs with my voice!
This is my glory, Lord, to be
Joined to thy saints, and near to thee.
PSALM CVI. Second Part. Ver. 7, 8, 12, 14, 43, -- 48. Israel punished and
pardoned; or, GOD's unchangeable Love..
1
GOD of eternal love,
How fickle are our ways!
And yet how often did Israel prove
Thy constancy of grace!
2
They saw thy wonders wrought,
And then thy praise they sung;
But soon thy works of power forgot,
And murmured with their tongue.
3
Now they believe his word,
While rocks with rivers flow;
Now with their lusts provoke the Lord,
And he reduced them low.
4
Yet when they mourned their faults,
He hearkened to their groans;
Brought his own covenant to his thoughts,
And called them still his sons.
5
Their names were in his book,
He saved them from their foes;
Often he chastis'd, but never forsook
The people that he chose.
6
Let Israel bless the Lord,
Who loved their ancient race;
And Christians join the solemn word,
Amen to all the praise.
PSALM CVII. First Part. Israel led to Canaan, and Christians to Heaven.
1
GIVE thanks to God, he reigns above,
Kind are his thoughts, his name is love:
His mercy ages past have known,
And ages long to come shall own.
2
Let the redeemed of the Lord
The wonders of his grace record;
Israel, the nation whom he chose,
And rescued from their mighty foes.
3
[When GOD's Almighty arm had broke
Their fetters and the Egyptian yoke,
They traced the desert wandering round;
A wild and solitary ground!
4
There they could find no leading road,
Nor city for their fixed abode;
Nor food, nor fountain to assuage
Their burning thirst, or hunger's rage.]
5
In their distress to God they cried,
GOD was their Savior and their guide;
He led their wandering march around:
And brought their tribes to Canaan's ground.
6
Thus when our first release we gain
From sin's old yoke, and satan's chain,
We have this desert world to pass,
A dangerous and a tiresome place.
7
He feeds and clothes us all the way,
He guides our footsteps lest we stray,
He guards us with a powerful hand,
And brings us to the heavenly land.
8
Oh let the saints with joy record
The truth and goodness of the Lord!
How great his works! how kind his ways!
Let every tongue pronounce his praise.
PSALM CVII. Second Part. Corrections for Sin, and release by Prayer.
1
FROM age to age exalt his name,
GOD and his grace are still the same:
He fills the hungry ^oul with food,
And feeds the poor with every good.
2
But if their hearts rebel and rise
Against the GOD that rules the skies;
If they reject his heavenly word,
And slight the counsels of the Lord;
3
He Will bring their spirits to the ground,
And no deliverance shall be found;
Laden with grief they waste their breath
In darkness and the shades of death.
4
Then to the Lord they raise their cries,
He makes the dawning light arise,
And scatters all that dismal shade
That hung so heavy round their dead,
5
He cuts the bars of brass in two,
And lets the smiling prisoners through
Takes off the load of guilt and grief,
And gives the laboring soul relief.
6
Oh may the sons of men record
The wondrous goodness of the Lord!
How great his works! how kind his ways!
Let every tongue pronounce his praise.
PSALM CVII. Third Part. Intemperance punished and pardoned; or, A Psalm for
the Glutton and the Drunkard.
1
VAIN man on foolish pleasures bent,
Prepares for his own punishment;
What pains, what loathsome meladies
From luxury and lust arise!
2
The drunkard feels his vitals waste;
Yet drowns his health to please his taste;
'Till all his active powers are lost,
And fainting life draws near the dust.
3
The glutton groans, and loathes to eat,
His soul abhors delicious meat;
Nature with heavy loads oppressed
Would yield to death to be released.
4
Then how the frightened sinners fly
To GOD for help with earnest cry!
He hears their groans, prolongs their breath;
And saves them from approaching death.
5
No medicines could effect the cure
So quick, so easy, or so sure:
The deadly sentence GOD repeals,
He sends his sovereign word, and heals.
6
Oh may the sons of men record
The wondrous goodness of the Lord!
And let their thankful offering prove
How they adore their Maker's love.
PSALM. CVII. Fourth Part. Long Meter. Deliverance from Storms and Shipwreck;
or, The Seaman's Song.
1
W0ULD you behold the works of GOD,
His wonders in the world abroad,
With the bold mariner, survey
The unknown regions of the sea.
2
They leave their native shores behind,
And seize the favor of the wind!
'Till God command, and tempests rise
That heave the ocean to the skies.
3
Now to the heavens they mount amain,
Now sink to dreadful deeps again;
What strange affrights young sailors feel,
And like a staggering drunkard reel!
4
When land is far, and death is nigh,
Lost to all hope, to GOD they cry:
His mercy hears the loud address,
And sends salvation in distress.
5
He bids the winds their wrath assuage,
And stormy tempests cease to rage;
The gladsome train their fears give over
And hail with joy their native shore.
6
Oh may the sons of men record
The wondrous goodness of the Lord!
Let them their private offerings bring,
And in the church his glory sing.
PSALM CVII. Fourth Part. Common Meter. The Mariner's Psalm.
1
THY works of glory, mighty Lord,
That rule the boisterous sea,
The sons of courage shall record,
Who tempt that dangerous way,
2
At thy command the winds arise,
And swell the towering waves!
The men astonished mount the skies,
And sink in gaping graves.
3
[Again they climb the watery hills,
And plunge in deeps again;
Each like a tottering drunkard reels,
And finds his courage vain.
4
Frighted to hear the tempest roar,
They pant with fluttering breath;
And hopeless of the distant shore
Expect immediate death.]
5
Then to the Lord they raise their cries;
He hears the loud request,
And orders silence through the skies,
And lays the floods to rest.
6
Sailors rejoice to lose their fears,
And see the storms allayed:
Now to their eyes the port appears;
There let their vows be paid.
7
It Is GOD that brings them safe to land;
Let stupid mortals know,
That waves are under his command,
And all the winds that blow.
8
Oh that the sons of men would praise
The goodness of the Lord!
And those that see thy wondrous ways
Thy wondrous love record.
PSALM CVII. Last Part. Colonies planted; or, Nations blessed and punished.
1
WHEN GOD, provoked with daring crimes,
Scourges the madness of the times,
He turns their fields to barren sand,
And dries the rivers from the land.
2
His word can raise the springs again,
And make the withered mountains green,
Send showery blessings from the skies;
And harvests in the desert rise.
3
[Where nothing dwelt but beasts of prey,
Or men as fierce and wild as they,
He bids the oppressed and poor repair,
And builds them towns and cities there.
4
They sow the fields, and trees they plant,
Whose yearly fruit supplies their want;
Their race grows up from fruitful stocks,
Their wealth increases with their flocks.
5
Thus they are blessed; but if they sin,
He lets the heathen nations in,
A savage crew invades their lands,
Their princes die by barbarous hands.
6
Their captive sons, exposed to scorn,
Wander unpitied and forlorn;
The country lies unfenc'd, untilled,
And desolation spreads the field.
7
Yet if the humbled nation mourns,
Again his dreadful hand he turns:
Again he makes their cities thrive,
And bids the dying churches live]
8
The righteous with a joyful sense
Admire the works of providence;
And tongues of atheists shall no more,
Blaspheme the GOD that saints adore.
9
How few with pious care record
These wondrous dealings of the Lord!
But wise observers still shall find
The Lord is holy, just and kind.
PSALM CVIII. Common Meter. A Song of Praise.
1
AWAKE, my soul, to sound his praise,
Awake my harp to sing;
Join all my powers the song to raise,
And morning incense bring.
2
Among the people of his care,
And through the nations round;
Glad songs of praise will I prepare,
And there his name resound.
3
Be thou exalted, O my GOD,
Above the starry train;
Diffuse thy heavenly grace abroad,
And teach the world thy reign.
4
So shall thy chosen sons rejoice,
And throng thy courts above;
While sinners hear thy pardoning voice,
And taste redeeming love.
PSALM CIX. Ver. 1 -- 5, 31. Love to Enemies from the Example of Christ.
1
GOD of my mercy and my praise,
Thy glory is my song;
Though Sinners speak against thy grace
With a blaspheming tongue.
2
When in the form of mortal man,
Thy son on earth was found;
With cruel slanders false and vain.
They compassed him around.
3
Their mis'ries his compassion move,
Their peace he still pursued;
They render hatred for his love,
And evil for his good.
4
Their malice raged without a cause,
Yet with his dying breath
He prayed for murd'rers on his cross,
And blessed his foes in death.
5
Lord shall thy bright example shine
In vain before my eyes;
Give me a soul akin to thine,
To love mine enemies.
6
The Lord shall on my side engage,
And in my Savior's name
I shall defeat their pride and rage,
Who slander and condemn.
PSALM CX. First Part. Long Meter. Christ exalted, and Multitudes converted;
or, The Success of the Gospel.
^
THUS GOD the eternal Father spoke
To Christ the Son; "Ascend and sit
"At my right hand, 'till I shall make
"Thy foes submissive at thy feet.
^
"From Zion shall thy word proceed,
"Thy word, the scepter in thy hand,
"Shall make the hearts of rebels bleed,
"And bow their wills to thy command.
^
"That day shall show thy power is great,
"When saints shall flock with willing minds,
"And sinners crowd thy temple-gate,
"Where holiness in beauty shines."
^
O blessed power! O glorious day!
"What a large victory shall ensue;
"And converts, who thy grace obey,
"Exceed the drops of morning dew.
PSALM CX. Second Part. Long Meter. The Kingdom and Priesthood of Christ
1
THUS the great Lord of earth and sea
Spoke to his Son, and thus he swore;
"Eternal shall thy priesthood be,
"And change from hand to hand no more.
2
"Aaron, and all his sons, must die:
"But everlasting life is thine,
"To save forever those that fly
"For refuge from the wrath divine.
^
"By me Melchisedec was made
"On earth a king and priest at once;
"And thou, my heavenly priest shall plead,
"And thou, my king shall rule my sons."
4
Jesus the priest ascends his throne,
While counsels of eternal peace,
Between the father and the son,
Proceed with honor and success.
5
Through the whole earth his reign shall spread,
And crush the powers that dare rebel:
Then shall he judge the rising dead,
And send the guilty world to hell.
6
Though while he treads his glorious way,
He drinks the cup of threats and blood,
The sufferings of that dreadful day
Shall but advance him near to GOD.
PSALM CX. Common Meter. Christ's Kingdom and Priesthood.
1
JESUS, out Lord ascend thy throne
And near thy Father sit;
In Zion shall thy power be known,
And make thy foes submit.
2
What wonders shall thy gospel do!
Thy converts shall surpass
The numerous drops of morning-dew,
And own thy sovereign Grace.
3
GOD has pronounced a firm decree,
Nor changes what he swore;
"Eternal shall thy priesthood be,
"When Aaron is no more.
4
"Melchisedec, that wondrous priest,
"That king of high degree,
"That holy man who Abraham blessed
"Was but a type of thee."
5
Jesus our priest forever lives
To plead for us above;
Jesus our King forever gives
The blessings of his love.
^
GOD shall exalt his glorious head,
And his high throne maintain,
Shall strike the powers and princes dead,
Who dare oppose his reign.
PSALM CXI. First Part. The Wisdom of GOD in his Works.
1
SONGS of immortal praise belong
To my almighty GOD;
He has my heart, and he my tongue
To spread his name abroad.
2
How great (...) works his hand has wrought!
How glorious in our sight!
And men in every age have sought
His wonders with delight.
3
How fair and beauteous nature's frame!
How wise the eternal mind!
His counsels never change the scheme
That his first thoughts designed.
4
When he redeemed his chosen sons,
He fixed his covenant sure:
The orders that his lips pronounce
To endless years endure.
5
Nature and time, and earth and skies,
Thy heavenly skill proclaim;
What shall we do to make us wise,
But learn to read thy name?
6
To fear thy power, to trust thy grace,
Is our divinest skill!
And he is the wisest of our race
That best obeys thy will.
PSALM CXI. Second Part. The Perfections of GOD.
1
GREAT is the Lord; his works of might
Demand our noblest songs;
Let his assembled saints unite
Their harmony of tongues.
2
Great is the mercy of the Lord,
He gives his children food;
And ever mindful of his word,
He makes his promise good.
3
His Son, the great Redeemer, came
To feal his covenant sure:
Holy and reverend is his name,
His ways are just and pure.
4
They that would grow divinely wise,
Must with his fear begin;
Our fairest proof of knowledge lies
In hating every in.
PSALM CXII. As the 113th Psalm. The Blessings of the liberal Man.
1
THAT man is blessed who stands in awe
Of GOD, and loves his sacred law:
His seed on earth shall be renowned;
His house the seat of wealth shall be,
An unexhausted treasury,
And with successive honors crowned.
2
His liberal favors he extends,
To some he gives, to others lends;
A generous pity fills his mind:
Yet what his charity impairs,
He saves by prudence in affairs,
And thus he is just to all mankind.
3
His hands, while they his alms bestowed,
His glory's future harvest sowed;
The sweet remembrance of the just
Like a green root revives and bears
A train of blessings for his heirs,
When dying nature sleeps in dust,
4
Beset with threatening dangers round,
Unmov^d shall he maintain his ground;
His conscience holds his courage up:
The soul that is filled with virtue's light,
Shines brightest in affliction's night:
And sees in darkness beams of grace.
PAUSE.

5
[Ill tidings never can surprise
His heart that fixed on GOD relies,
Though waves and tempests roar around:
Safe on a rock he fits, and sees
The shipwreck of his enemies,
And all their hope and glory drowned.
6
The wicked shall his triumph see,
And gnash their teeth in agony,
To find their expectations crossed:
They and their envy, pride and spite,
Sink down to everlasting night,
And all their names in darkness lost,]
PSALM CXII. Long Meter. The Blessings of the Pious and Charitable,
1
THRICE happy man who fears the Lord,
Loves his commands, and trusts his word;
Honor and peace his days attend,
And blessings to his seed descend.
2
Compassion dwells upon his mind,
To works of mercy still inclined:
He lends the poor some present aid,
Or gives them, not to be repaid.
^
When times grow dark, and tidings spread
That fill his neighbors round with dread,
His heart is armed against the fear,
For GOD with all his power is there.
^
His spirit fixed upon the Lord
Draws heavenly courage from his word;
Amidst the darkness light shall rise,
To cheer his heart and bless his eyes.
5
He has dispersed his alms abroad,
His works are still before his GOD;
His name on earth shall long remain,
While envious sinners rage in vain.
PSALM CXII. Common Meter. Liberality rewarded.
1
HAPPY is he that fears the Lord,
And follows his commands,
Who lends the poor without reward,
Or gives with liberal hands.
2
As pity dwells within his breast
To all the sons of need;
So GOD shall answer his request
With blessings on his seed.
3
No evil tidings shall surprise
His well-establish'd mind;
His soul to GOD, his refuge flies,
And leaves his fears behind.
4
In times of danger and distress
Some beams of light shall shine,
To show the world his righteousness,
And give him peace divine.
5
His works of piety and love
Remain before the Lord;
Honor on earth and joys above
Shall be his sure reward.
PSALM CXIII. Proper Tune. The Majesty and Condescension of GOD.
1
YE that delight to serve the Lord,
The honors of his name record,
His sacred name forever bless:
Wherever the circling sun displays
His rising beams or setting rays,
Let lands and seas his power confess.
2
Not time, nor nature's narrow rounds,
Can give his vast dominion bounds;
The heavens are far below his height;
Let no created greatness dare
With our eternal GOD compare,
Armed with his uncreated might.
3
He bows his glorious head to view
What the bright hosts of angels do,
And bends his care to mortal things:
His sovereign hand exalts the poor,
He takes the needy from the door,
And seats them on the throne of kings.
4
When childless families despair,
He sends the blessings of an heir,
To rescue their expiring name;
The mother with a thankful voice
Proclaims his praises and her joys;
Let every age advance his praise.
PSALM CXIII. Long Meter. GOD sovereign and gracious.
1
YE servants of the almighty King,
In every age his praises sing;
Where ever the sun shall rise or set,
The nations shall his praise repeat.
2
Above the earth, beyond the sky
His throne of glory stands on high:
Nor time nor place his power restrain,
Nor bound his universal reign.
3
Which of the sons of Adam dare,
Or angels with their GOD compare?
His glories how divinely bright!
Who dwells in uncreated light;
4
Behold his love, he stoops to view
What saints above and angels do;
And condescends yet more to know
The mean affairs of men below.
5
From dust and cottages obscure
His grace exalts the humble poor!
Gives them the honor of his sons,
And fits them for their heavenly thrones.
6
[A word of his creating voice
Can make the barren house rejoice:
Though Sarah's ninety years were past,
The promised seed is born at last.
7
With joy the mother views her son,
And tells the wonders GOD has done;
Faith may grow strong when sense despairs:
If nature fails the promise bears.]
PSALM CXIV. Miracles attending Israel's Journey.
1
WHEN Israel, freed from Pharaoh's hand,
Left the proud tyrant and his land,
The tribes with cheerful homage own
Their king, and Judah was his throne.
2
Across the deep their journey lay;
The deep divides to make them way;
Jordan beheld their march, and fled
With backward current to his head.
3
The mountains shook like frighted sheep,
Like lambs the little hillocks leap!
Not Sinai on her base could stand,
Conscious of sovereign power at hand.
4
What power could make the deep divide?
Make Jordan backward roll his tide?
Why did ye leap, ye little hills?
And whence the dread that Sinai feels?
5
Let every mountain, every flood
Retire and know the approaching GOD,
The king of Israel: see him here;
Tremble thou earth, adore and fear.
6
He thunders, and all nature mourns,
The rock to standing pools he turns;
Flints spring with fountains at his word,
And fires and seas confess the Lord.
PSALM CXV. First Meter. The true GOD our Refuge. or, Idolatry reproved.
1
NOT to ourselves, who are but dust,
Not to ourselves is glory due,
Eternal GOD, thou only just,
Thou only gracious, wise and true.
2
Display to earth thy dreadful name;
Why should a heathen's haughty tongue
Insult us, and to raise our shame,
Say, " Where Is the GOD you have served so long?
3
The GOD we serve maintains his throne,
Above the clouds, beyond the skies;
Through all the earth his will is done,
He knows our groans, he hears our cries.
4
But the vain idols they adore
Are senseless shapes of stone and wood:
At best a mass of glittering ore,
A silver saint, or golden god.
5
[With eyes and ears, they carve the head;
Deaf are their ears, their eyes are blind;
In vain are costly offerings made,
And vows are scattered in the wind.
6
Their feet were never made to move,
Nor hands to save when mortals pray:
Mortals that pay them fear or love,
Seem to be blind and deaf as they.]
7
O Israel, make the Lord thy hope,
Thy help, thy refuge, and thy rest;
The Lord shall build thy ruins up,
And bless the people and the priest.
8
The dead no more can speak thy praise*
They dwell in silence in the grave;
But we shall live to sing thy grace,
And tell the world thy power to save.
PSALM CXV. Second Meter. As the New Tune of the 50th Psalm. Idolatry reproved.
1
NOT to our names, thou only just and true,
Not to our worthless names is glory due:
Thy power and grace, thy truth and justice claim
Immortal honors to thy sovereign name;
Shine through the earth from heaven thy blessed abode;
Nor let the heathens say: And where is your God?
2
Heaven is thine higher court: There stands thy throne
And through the lower worlds thy will is done:
GOD framed this earth, the starry heavens he spread,
But fools adore the gods their hands have made;
The kneeling crowd, with looks devout behold
Their silver-saviours, and their saints of gold.
3
[Vain are those artful shapes of eyes and ears;
The molten image neither sees nor hears:
Their hands are helpless, nor their feet can move,
They have no speech, nor though, nor power, nor love
Yet sottish mortals make their long complaints
To their deaf idols, and their moveless saints.
4
The rich have statues well adorned with gold;
The poor content with gods of coarser mould,
With tools of iron carve the senseless stock
Lopt from a tree, or broken from a rock:
People and priest drive on the solemn trade,
And trust the gods that saws and hammers made.]
5
Be heaven and earth amazed! It Is hard to say
Which are more stupid, or their gods, or they.
O Israel, trust the Lord: He hears and sees,
He knows thy sorrows and restores thy peace*
His worship does a thousand comforts yield,
He is thy help, and he thine heavenly shield.
^
In GOD we trust; our impious foes in vain
Attempt our ruin and oppose his reign;
Had they prevailed darkness had closed our days,
And death and silence had forbid his praise:
But we are saved, and live: Let songs arise,
And Zion bless the GOD that built the skies.
PSALM CXVI. First Part. Recovery from Sickness.
1
I Love the Lord: He heard my cries,
And pitied every groan,
Long as I live, when troubles rise,
I Will hasten to his throne.
2
I love the LORD: He bowed his ear,
And chased my griefs away:
Oh let my heart no more despair,
When I have breath to pray!
3
My flesh declined, my spirits fell,
And I drew near the dead,
While inward pangs and fears of hell
Perplexed my wakeful head.
4
"My GOD, I cried, thy servant save,
"Thou ever good and just;
"Thy power can rescue from the grave,
"Thy power is all my trust.
5
The Lord beheld me sore distressed,
He bade my pains remove:
Return, my soul, to GOD thy rest,
For thou have known his love.
6
My GOD has saved my soul from death,
And dried my falling tears:
Now to his praise I Will spend my breath.
And my remaining years.
PSALM CXVI.11, etc. Second Part. Thanks for private Deliverance.
1
WHAT shall I render to my GOD
For all his kindness shown?
My feet shall visit thine abode,
My songs address thy throne.
2
Among the saints that fill thine house
My offerings shall be paid;
There shall my zeal perform my vows
My soul in anguish made.
3
How much is mercy thy delight,
Thou ever-blessed GOD!
How dear thy servants in thy sight?
How precious is their blood?
4
How happy all thy servants are!
How great thy grace to me!
My life which thou have made thy care,
Lord, I devote to thee.
5
Now I am thine, forever thine,
Nor shall my purpose move;
Thy hand has loosed my bonds of pain,
And bound me with thy love.
6
Here in thy courts I leave my vow,
And thy rich grace record:
Witness, ye saints, who hear me now,
If I forsake the Lord.
PSALM CXVII. Common Meter. Praise to GOD from all Nations.
1
O All ye nations, praise the Lord,
Each with a different tongue;
In every language learn his word,
And let his name be sung.
2
His mercy reigns through every land:
Proclaim his grace abroad;
Forever firm his truth shall stand;
Praise ye the faithful GOD.
PSALM CXVII. Long Meter.
^
FROM all that dwell below the skies
Let the Creator's praise arise:
Let the Redeemer's name be sung
Through every land, by every tongue.
^
Eternal are thy mercies, Lord;
Eternal truth attends thy word;
Thy praise shall found from shore to shore,
Till suns shall set and rise no more.
PSALM CXVII. Short Meter.
^
THY name, almighty Lord,
Shall sound through distant lands:
Great is thy grace, and sure thy word:
Thy truth forever stands.
^
Far be thine honor spread,
And long thy praise endure,
Till morning light and evening shade
Shall be exchanged no more.
PSALM CXVIII. First Part. Ver. 6 -- 15. Deliverance from a Tumult.
^
THE Lord appears my helper now,
Nor is my faith afraid
What all the sons of earth can do,
Since heaven affords its aid.
^
It Is safer, Lord, to hope in thee,
And have my GOD my friend,
Than trust in men of high degree,
And on their truth depend.
^
It Is through the Lord my heart is strong,
In him my lips rejoice;
While his salvation is my song,
How cheerful is my voice!
4
Like angry bees they girt me round;
When GOD appears they fly:
So burning thorns with crack'ling sound
Make a fierce blaze, and die.
5
Joy to the saints and peace belongs;
The Lord protects their days:
Let Israel tune immortal songs
To his Almighty grace.
PSALM CXVIII. Second Part. Ver. 17 -- 21* Public Praise for Deliverance from
Death.
1
LORD, thou have heard thy servant cry,
And rescued from the grave;
Now shall he live: (and none can die,
If GOD resolve to save.)
2
Thy praise more constant than before,
Shall fill his daily breath;
Thy hand that has chastis'd him sore
Defends him still from death.
3
Open the gate of Zion now,
For we shall worship there,
The house where all the righteous go
Thy mercy to declare.
4
Among the assemblies of thy saints
Our thankful voice we raise;
There we have told thee our complaints,
And there we speak thy praise.
PSALM CXVIII. Third Part. Ver. 22, 23 Christ the Foundation of the Church.
1
BEHOLD the sure foundation stone
Which GOD in Zion lays,
To build our heavenly hopes upon,
And his eternal praise.
2
Chosen of God, to sinners dear,
And saints adore the name,
They trust their whole salvation here,
Nor shall they suffer shame.
^
The foolish builders, scribe and priest,
Reject it with disdain;
Firm on this rock the church shall rest,
And envy rage in vain.
^
What though the gates of hell withstood?
Yet must this building rise:
It Is thy own work, Almighty GOD,
And wondrous in our eyes.
PSALM CXVIII. Fourth Part. Ver. 24, 25, 26. Hosannah; the Lord's-Days; or,
Christ's Resurrection, and our Salvation.
1
THIS is the day the Lord has made,
He calls the hours his own;

And Satan's empire fell;
To day the saints his triumph spread,
And all his wonders tell.

To David's holy son,
Help us, O Lord; descend and bring
Salvation from thy throne.

With messages of grace:

To save our sinful race.

The Church on earth can raise;
The highest heavens, in which he reigns,
Shall give him nobler praise.

A new song of Salvation by Christ.
1
SEE what a living stone
The builders did refuse;
Yet GOD has built his church thereon
In spite of envious Jews.
2
The scribe and angry priest
Reject thine only Son;
Yet on this rock shall Zion rest,
As the chief cornerstone.
3
The work, O Lord, is thine,
And wondrous in our eyes:
This day declares it all divine,
This day did Jesus rise.

This is the glorious day
That our Redeemer made;"

Let all the church be glad.

The joy and wonder of our eyes;
This is the day that proves it thine,
The day that saw our Savior rise.

Sinners rejoice, and saints be glad;
Hosannah, let his name be blessed;
A thousand honors on his head,
With peace and light and glory rest!
4
In God's own name he comes to bring
Salvation to our dying race;
Let the whole church address their king
With hearts of joy, and songs of praise.
PSALM CXIX.
[I have collected and disposed the most useful Verses of this Psalm under
eighteen different Heads, and formed a Divine Song upon each of them. But the
Verses are much transposed, to attain some Degree of Connection.

In some places, among the Words Law, Commands, Judgments, Testimonies, I have
used Gospel, Word, Grace, Truth, Promises, etc. as more agreeable to the New
Testament, and the common Language of Christians, and it equally answers the
Design of the Psalmist, which was to recommend the holy Scripture.]

PSALM CXIX First Part. The Blessedness of Saints, and Misery of Sinners.
Ver. 1, 2, 3.
1
BLESSED are the undefiled in heart,
Whose ways are right and clean:
Who never from thy law depart,
But fly from every sin.

Blessed are the men that keep thy word,
And practice thy commands;
With their whole heart they seek the Lord
And serve thee with their hands.
Ver. 165.

Great is their peace who love thy law;
How firm their souls abide;
Nor can a bold temptation draw
Their steady feet aside.
Ver. 21.118.
4
Then shall my heart have inward joy,
And keep my face from shame,
When all thy statutes I obey
And honor all thy name.
5
But haughty sinners GOD will hate,
The proud shall die accursed;
The sons of falsehood and deceit
Are trodden to the dust.
Ver. 119, 153.
6
Vile as the dross the wicked are;
And those that leave thy ways
Shall see salvation from afar,
But never taste thy grace.

Soon as I know thy way,
My heart makes haste to obey thy word,

I choose the path of heavenly truth,
And glory in my choice;
Not all the riches of the earth

Thence I derive my daily strength,
And there my comfort lies.

That guides us all the day;
And through the dangers of the night,
A lamp to lead our way.

And meditate thy word,
Grow wiser than their teachers are,
And better know the Lord.

6
[The starry heavens thy rule obey,
The earth maintains her place;
And these thy servants night and day
Thy skill and power express.

But still thy law, and gospel, Lord,
Have lessons more divine:
Not earth stands firmer than thy word,
Nor stars so nobly shine.]

OH how I love thy holy law!
It Is daily my delight;
And thence my meditations draw
Divine advice by night.

My waking eyes prevent the day
To meditate thy word:
My soul with longing melts away
To hear thy gospel, Lord.
Ver. 3, 13, 44.
3
Thy heavenly words my heart engage,
And well employ my tongue,
And in my tiresome pilgrimage
Yield me a heavenly song.
Ver. 19, 103.
4
Am I a stranger, or at home,
It Is my perpetual feast;
Not honey dropping from the comb
So much allures the taste.
Ver. 72, 127.

No treasures so enrich the mind;
Nor shall thy word be sold
For loads of silver well refined,
Nor heaps of choicest gold.

When nature sinks, and spirits droop,
Thy promises of grace
Are pillars to support my hope,
And there I write thy praise.

Thence I maintain a constant fight
With every flattering lust.

Ver. 96. paraphrased
^
LET all the heathen writers join
To form one perfect book,
Great GOD, if once compared with thine,
How mean their writings look.
^
Not the most perfect rules they gave
Could show one sin forgiven:
Nor lead a step beyond the grave,
But thine conduct to heaven.
3
I Have seen an end to what we call
Perfection here below;
How short the powers of nature fall,
And can no farther go.
4
Yet man would fain be just with GOD,
By works their hands have wrought*
But thy commands, exceeding broad,
Extend to every thought.
5
In vain we boast perfection here.
While sin defiles our frame:
And sinks our virtues down so far,
They scarce deserve the name.
6
Our faith, and love, and every grace
Fall far below thy word;
But perfect truth and righteousness
Dwell only with the Lord.
PSALM CXIX. Eighth Part. Excellency and Variety of Scripture.
Ver. 111. Paraphrased.

LORD, I have made thy word my choice,
My lasting heritage;
There shall my noblest powers rejoice,
My warmest thoughts engage.

I Will read the histories of thy love,
And keep thy laws in sight,
While through the promises I rove,
With ever-fresh delight.
3
It Is a broad land of wealth unknown,
Where springs of life arise,
Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,
And hidden glory lies;

The best relief that mourners have,
It makes our sorrows blessed;
Our fairest hope beyond the grave,
And our eternal rest.
PSALM CXIX. Ninth Part. Desire of Knowledge.

My heart was fashioned by thy hand,
My service is thy due,
Oh make thy servant understand
The duties I must do.

Since I Am a stranger here below,
Let not thy path be hid,
But mark the road my feet should go,
And be my constant guide.

When I confessed my wandering ways,
Thou heardst my soul complain;
Grant me the teachings of thy grace,

If GOD to me his statutes show,
And heavenly truth impart,
His work forever I Will pursue,
His law shall rule my heart.

Variety of grief:
It made me learn thy word the more,
And fly to that relief.

I Will never forget thy law,
Nor let that blessed gospel go
Whence all my hopes I draw.

I Will teach the world his ways;
My thankful lips, inspired with zeal,
Shall sing aloud his praise.]

BEHOLD thy waiting servant, Lord,
Devoted to thy fear;
Remember and confirm thy word,
For all my hopes are there.

2
Have thou not sent salvation down,
And promised quickening grace?
Does not my heart address thy throne?
And yet thy love delays.
Ver. 123, 42.
3
Mine eyes for thy salvation fail;
Oh bear thy servant up;
Nor let the scoffing lips prevail,
Who dare reproach my hope.
Ver. 49, 74.
4
Did thou not raise my faith, O Lord?
Then let thy truth appear:
Saints shall rejoice in my reward,
And trust as well as fear.
PSALM CXIX. Eleventh Part. Breathing after holiness.
1
OH that the Lord would guide my ways
To keep his statutes still!
Oh that my GOD would grant me grace
To know and do his will!

2
Oh send thy Spirit down to write
Thy law upon my heart,
Nor let my tongue indulge deceit,
Nor act the liar's part.

From vanity turn off my eyes;
Let no corrupt design,
Nor covetous desires arise
Within this soul of mine.

Order my footsteps by thy word,
And make my heart sincere;
Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
But keep my conscience clear.

My soul has gone too far astray,
My feet too often slip;
Yet since I Have not forgot thy way
Restore thy wandering sheep.

Make me to walk in thy commands,
It Is a delightful road;
Nor let my head, or heart, or hands,
Offend against my GOD.
PSALM CXIX. Twelvth Part. Breathing after Comfort and Deliverance.

Let mercy plead my cause;

Forbid, forbid the sharp reproach,
Which I so justly fear;
Uphold my life, uphold my hopes,
Nor let my shame appear.
Ver. 122, 135.
3
Be thou a surety, Lord, for me,
Nor let the proud oppress;
But make thy waiting servant see
The shinings of thy face.
Ver. 81.
4
My eyes with expectation fail;
My heart within me cries,
"When will the Lord his truth fulfill,
"And bid my comforts rise."
Ver. 132.
3
Look down upon my sorrows, Lord,
And show thy grace the same;
Thy tender mercies still afford
To those that love thy name.

WITH my whole heart I Have sought thy fa^^,
Oh let me never stray

To keep my conscience clean,
And be an everlasting guard
From every rising sin.

My sorrows rise, my nature faints,
When men transgress thy word.

My spirit stands in awe;
My soul abhors a lying tongue,
But loves thy righteous law.

My heart with sacred reverence hears
The threatenings of thy word;
My flesh with holy trembling fears
The judgments of the Lord.

For thy salvation still;
While thy whole law is my delight,
And I obey thy will.

And thy deliverance send;
My soul for thy salvation faints,
When will my troubles end!
Ver. 71.
2
Yet I have found it is good for me
To bear my Father's rod;
Afflictions make me learn the law,
And live upon my GOD.
Ver. 50.
3
This is the comfort I enjoy
When new distress begins:
I read thy word, I run thy way,
And hate my former sins.
Ver. 92.
4
Had not thy word been my delight
When earthly joys were fled,
My soul, oppressed with sorrow's weight,
Had sunk amongst the dead.
Ver. 75.
5
I know thy judgments, Lord, are right,
Though they may seem severe;
The sharpest sufferings I endure,
Flow from thy faithful care.

Before I knew thy chastening rod,
My feet were apt to stray;

Nor wander from thy way.

My soul shall never forget thy word,
Thy word is all my joy.

How would I run in thy commands,
If thou my heart discharge
From sin and Satan's hateful chains,
And set my feet at large!
Ver, 13, 46.
4
My lips with courage shall declare
Thy statutes and thy name;
I Will speak thy word though kings should hear,
Nor yield to sinful shame.
Ver. 61, 69, 70.

Let bands of persecutors rise
To rob me of my right,
Let pride and malice forge their lies,

And must obey his will.

To run the heavenly road?

To draw me near the Lord.

All my support is from thy word:
My soul dissolves for heaviness;
Uphold me with thy strengthening grace.
Ver. 51, 69, 110.
2
The proud have framed their scoffs and lies.
They watch my feet with envious eyes,
They tempt my soul to snares and sin;
Yet thy commands I never decline.

Foolish and vain, I went astray,
Ere I had felt thy scourges, Lord,
I left my guide, and lost my way:
But now I love and keep thy word.
Ver. 71.

The law that issues from thy mouth
Shall raise my cheerful passions more
Than all the treasures of the south,
Or richest hills of golden ore.

For I have trusted in thy word,
And made thy grace my only choice.
PSALM CXX. Complaint of quarrelsome Neighbors; or, A devout Wish for Peace.
1
THOU GOD of love, thou ever-blest,
Pity my suffering state;
When will thou set my soul at rest,
From lips that love deceit?
2
Hard lot of mine! My days are cast
Among the sons of strife,
Whose never ceasing quarrels waste
My golden hours of life.
3
Oh might I fly to change my place,
How would I choose to dwell
In some wide lonesome wilderness,
And leave these gates of hell!
4
Peace is the blessing that I seek,
How lovely are its charms!
I am for peac^; but when I speak,
They all declare for arms.
5
New passions still their souls engage,
And keep their malice strong:
What shall be done to curb thy rage,
O thou devouring tongue!
6
Should burning arrows smite thee through,
Strict justice would approve;
But I would rather spare my foe,
And melt his heart with love.
PSALM CXXI. Long Meter. Divine Protection.
1
UP to the hills I lift mine eyes,
The eternal hills beyond the skies;
Thence all her help my soul derives;
There my almighty refuge lives.
2
He lives; the everlasting GOD,
That built the world, that spread the flood;
The heavens, with all their host he made,
And the dark regions of the dead.
3
He guides our feet, he guards our way;
His morning smiles adorn the day:
He spreads the evening veil, and keeps
The silent hours while Israel sleeps.
4
Israel, a name divinely blessed,
May rise secure, securely rest;
Thy holy guardian's wakeful eyes
Admit no slumber, nor surprise.
5
No sun shall smite thy head by day,
Nor the pale moon with sickly ray
Shall blast thy couch; no baleful star
Dart his malignant fire so far.
6
Should earth and hell with malice burn,
Still thou shall go, and still return;
Safe in the Lord! his heavenly care
Defends thy life from every snare.
^
On thee foul spirits have no power;
And in thy last departing hour
Angels that trace the airy road,
Shall bear thee homeward to thy GOD.
PSALM CXXI. Common Meter. Preservation by Day and Night.
^
TO heaven I lift my waiting eyes,
There all my hopes are laid:
The Lord that built the earth and skies
Is my perpetual aid.
2
Their steadfast feet shall never fall,
Whom he designs to keep;
His ear attends the softest call;
His eyes can never sleep,
3
He will sustain our weakest powers
With his almighty arm,
And watch our most unguarded hours
Against surprising harm.
4
Israel rejoice, and rest secure,
Thy keeper is the Lord;
His wakeful eyes employ his power
For thine eternal guard.
5
Nor scorching sun, (...) sickly moon
Shall have its leave to smite:
He shields thy head from burning noon,
From blasting damps at night.
6
He guards thy soul, he keeps thy breath,
Where thickest dangers come;
Go and return, secure from death,
Till GOD commands thee home.
PSALM CXXI. As the 148th Psalm. God our Preserver.
1
UPWARD I lift mine Eyes,
From GOD is all my ^^d;
The GOD that built the skies,
And earth and nature made;
GOD is the tower
To which I fly;
His grace is nigh
In every hour.
2
My feet shall never slide,
And fall in fatal snares,
Since GOD my guard and guide*
Defends me from my fears.
Those wakeful eyes
That never sleep,
Shall Israel keep
When dangers rise.
3
No burning heats by day,
Nor blasts of evening air,
Shall take my health away,
If GOD be with me there:
Thou art my sun,
And thou my shade,
To gaurd my head
By night or noon.
4
Have thou not given thy word
To save my soul from death?
And I can trust my Lord
To keep my mortal breath;
I Will go and come,
Nor fear to die,
Till from on high
Thou call me home.
PSALM CXXII. Common Meter. Going to Church.
1
HOW did my heart rejoice to hear
My friends devoutly say,
"In Zion let us all appear
"And keep the solemn day.
^
I love the gates, I love the road;
The church, adorned with grace,
Stands like a palace built for GOD
To show his milder face.
^
Up to her courts with joy unknown
The holy tribes repair;
The son of David holds his throne
And fits in judgment there.
^
He hears our praises and complaints;
And while his awful voice
Divides the sinners from the saints,
We tremble and rejoice.
^
Peace be within this sacred place,
And joy a constant guest!
With holy gifts and heavenly grace
Be her attendants blessed!
^
My soul shall pray for Zion still,
While life or breath remains;
There my best friends, my kindred dwell,
There GOD my Savior reigns.
PSALM CXXII. Proper Tune. Going to Church
1
HOW pleased and blessed was I,
To hear the people cry,
Come, let us seek our GOD to day!
Yet with a cheerful zeal
We haste to Zion's hill,
And there our vows and honors pay.
2
Zion, thrice happy place,
Adorned with woudrous grace,
And walls of strength embrace thee round;
In thee our tribes appear
To pray, and praise, and hear
The sacred gospel's joyful sound.
3
There David's greater son
Has fixed his royal throne,
He sits for grace and judgment there;
He bids the saints be glad,
He makes the sinner sad,
And humble souls rejoice with fear.
4
May peace attend thy gate,
And joy within thee wait
To bless the soul of every guest;
The man that seeks thy peace,
And wishes thine, increase,
A thousand blessings on him rest!
5
My tongue repeats her vows,
Peace to this sacred house!
For here my friends and kindred dwell;
And since my glorious GOD
Makes thee his best abode,
My soul shall ever love thee well.
Repeat the 4th Stanza to complete the Tune.

PSALM CXXIII. Pleading with Submission.
1
O Thou whose grace and justice reign
Enthroned above the skies,
To thee our hearts would tell their pain,
To thee we lift our eyes.
2
As servants watch their master's hand,
And fear the angry stroke!
Or maids before their mistress stand,
And wait a peaceful look:
3
So for our sins we justly feel
Thy discipline, O GOD;
Yet wait the gracious moment still,
Till thou remove the rod.
4
Those that in wealth and pleasure live,
Our daily groans deride,
And thy delays of mercy give
Fresh courage to their pride.
^
Our foes insult us, but our hope
In thy compassion lies;
This thought shall bear our spirits up,
That GOD will not despise.
PSALM CXXIV. Common Meter. GOD gives Victory.
HAD not the GOD of truth and love,
When hosts against us rose,
Displayed his vengeance from above,
And crushed the conquering foes.
2
Their armies like a raging flood
Had swept the guardless land,
Destroyed on earth his blessed abode,
And whelmed our feeble band.
3
But safe beneath his spreading shield
His sons securely rest,
Defy the dangers of the field,
And bare the fearless breast.
4
And now our souls shall bless the Lord,
Who broke the deadly snare;
Who saved us from the murdering sword,
And made our lives his care.
5
Our help is in Jehovah's name,
Who formed the heaven above;
He that supports their wondrous frame
Can guard his church by love.
PSALM CXXV. Common Meter. The Saint's trial and safety.
1
UNSHAKEN as the sacred hill,
And firm as mountains stand,
Firm as a rock the soul shall rest
That trusts the almighty hand.
2
Not walls nor hills could guard so well
Old Salem's happy ground,
As those eternal arms of love
That every saint surround.
3
While tyrants are a smarting scourge
To drive them near to GOD,
Divine compassion will assuage
The fury of the rod.
4
Deal gently, Lord, with souls sincere,
And lead them safely on
To the bright gates of paradise,
Where Christ their Lord is gone.
5
But if we trace those crooked ways
That the old serpent drew,
The wrath that drove him first to hell,
Shall smite his followers too.
PSALM CXXV. Short Meter. The Saints Trial and Safety; or, Moderated Affictions.
1
FIRM and unmoved are they
That rest their souls on GOD;
Firm as the mount where David dwelt,
Or where the ark abode.
2
As mountains stood to guard
The city's sacred ground,
So GOD and his almighty love
Embrace his saints around.
3
What though the Father's rod
Drop a chastising stroke,
Yet lest it wound their souls too deep,
Its fury shall be broke.
4
Deal gently, Lord* with those
Whose faith and pious fear,
Whose hope, and love, and every grace
Proclaim their hearts sincere.
5
Nor shall the tyrant's rage
Too long oppress the saints;
The GOD of Israel will support
His children, lest they faint.
6
But if our slavish fear
Will choose the road to hell,
We must expect our portion there
Where bolder sinners dwell.
PSALM CXXVI. Long Meter. Surprising Deliverance.
1
WHEN GOD restored our captive state,
Joy was our song, and grace our theme;
The grace beyond our hopes so great,
That joy appeared a pleasing dream.
2
The scoffer owns thy hand, and pays
Unwilling honors to thy name;
While we with pleasure shout thy praise,
Which cheerful notes thy love proclaim.
3
When we review our dismal fears,
'Twas hard to think they will vanish so;
With GOD we left our slowing tears,
He makes our joys like rivers flow.
4
The man that in his furrowed field,
His scattered seed with sadness leaves,
Will shout to see the harvest yield
A welcome load of joyful sheaves.
PSALM CXXVI. Common Meter. The joy of a remarkable Conversion; or, Melancholy
removed.
1
WHEN GOD revealed his gracious name,
And changed my mournf^l state,
My rapture seemed a pleasing dream,
The grace appeared so great.
2
The world beheld the glorious change,
And did thy hand confess;
My tongue broke out in unknown strains,
And sung surprising grace.
3
" Great is the work, my neighbors cried,
And owned the power divine;
" Great is the work, my heart replied,
"And be the glory thine."
4
The Lord can clear the darkest skies,
Can give us day for night;
Make drops of sacred sorrow rise
To rivers of delight.
5
Let those that sow in sadness wait
Till the fair harvest come,
They shall confess their sheaves are great,
And shout the blessings home.
6
Though seed die buried long in dust,
It shall not deceive their hope;
The precious grain can never be lost,
For grace insures the crop.
PSALM CXXVII. Long Meter. The Blessing of GOD on the Business and Comfort of
Life.
1
IF GOD succeed not, all the cost
And pains to build the house are lost,
If GOD the city will not keep,
The watchful guards as well may sleep.
2
What though we rise before the sun,
And work and toil when day is done,
Careful and sparing eat our bread,
To shun that poverty we dread.
3
It Is all in vain till GOD has blessed,
He can make rich, yet give us rest:
On GOD, our sovereign, still depends
Our joy in children and in friends.
4
Happy the man to whom he sends
Obedient children, faithful friends!
How sweet our daily comforts prove
When they are seasoned with his love!
PSALM CXXVII. Common Meter. GOD all in all.
1
IF GOD to build the house deny,
The builders work in vain;
And towns without his wakeful eye
An useless watch maintain.
2
Before the morning beams arise,
Your painful work renew,
And till the stars ascend the skies
Your tiresome toil pursue.
3
Short be your sleep, and coarse your fare;
In vain till GOD has blessed;
But if his smiles attend your care,
You shall have food and rest.
4
Nor children, relatives, nor friends,
Shall real blessings prove,
Nor all the earthly joys he sends,
If sent without his love.
PSALM CXXVIII. Family Blessings
1
O Happy man, whose soul is filled
With zeal and reverent awe!
His lips to GOD their honors yield,
His life adorns the law.
2
A careful providence shall stand
And ever guard thy head,
Shall on the labors of thy hand
Its kindly blessings shed.
3
Thy wife shall be a fruitful vine;
Thy children round thy board,
Each like a plant of honor shine,
And learn to fear the Lord.
4
The Lord shall thy best hopes fulfill
For months and years to come;
The Lord who dwells on Zion's hill
Shall send thee blessings home.
5
This is the man whose happy eyes
Shall see his house increase,
Shall see the sinking church arise,
Then leave the world in peace.
PSALM CXXIX. Persecutors punished.
1
UP from my youth, may Israel say,
Have I been nursed in tears;
My grief^ ^^re constant as the day,
And ^^dious as the years.
2
Up from my youth I bore the rage,
Of all the sons of strife;
Often they assailed my ripe^^age,
But GOD preserved my life.
3
Over all my frame their cruel dart
Its painful wounds impressed;
hourly they vexed my painful heart,
Nor let their sorrows rest.
4
The Lord grew angry on his throne,
And with impartial eye,
Measured the mischiefs they had done,
Then let his arrows fly.
5
How was their insolence surprised
To hear his thunders roll!
And all the foes of Zion seized
With horror to the soul.
6
Thus shall the men that hate the saints
Be blasted from the sky;
Their glory fades, their courage faints,
And all their prospects die.
^
[What though they flourish tall and fair,
They have no root beneath;
Their growth shall perish in despair,
And lie despised in death.
^
[So corn that an the housetop stands,
No hope of harvest give;
The reaper never shall fill his hands,
Nor binder fold the sheaves.
PSALM CXXX. Common Meter. Pardoning Grace.
1
OUT of the deeps of long distress,
The borders of despair,
I sent my cries to seek thy Grace,
My groans to move thine ear.
2
Great GOD, should thy severer eye,
And thine impartial hand,
Mark and revenge iniquity,
No mortal flesh could stand.
3
But there are pardons with my God
For crimes of high degree:
Thy Son has bought them with his blood
To draw us near to thee.
4
[I wait for thy salvation, Lord,
With strong desires I wait;
My soul invited by thy word
Stands watching at thy gate.]
5
[Just as the guards that keep the night
Long for the morning skies,
Watch the first beams of breaking light,
And meet them with their eyes;
6
So waits my soul to see thy grace
And more intent than they,
Meets the first openings of thy face,
And finds a brighter day.]
7
Then in the Lord let Israel trust,
Let Israel seek his face;
The Lord is good as well as just,
And plenteous in his grace.
8
There Is full redemption at his throne
For sinners long enslaved;
The great Redeemer is his Son:
And Israel shall be saved.
PSALM CXXX. Long Meter. Pardoning Grace
1
FROM deep distress and troubled thoughts,
To thee, my GOD, I raised my cries:
If thou severely mark our faults,
No flesh can stand before thine eyes.
2
But thou have built thy throne of grace
Free to dispense thy pardons there,
That sinners may approach thy face,
And hope, and love, as well as fear.
3
As the benighted pilgrims wait,
And long and wish for breaking day
So waits my soul before thy gate;
When will my GOD his face display!
4
My trust is fixed upon thy word,
Nor shall I trust thy word in vain:
Let mourning Souls address the Lord,
And find relief from all their pain.
5
Great is his love, and large his grace,
Through the redemption of his Son:
He turns our feet from sinful ways,
And pardons what our hands have done.
PSALM CXXXI. Humility and Submission.
1
IS there ambition in my heart?
Search, gracious GOD, and see;
Or do I act a haughty part?
Lord, I appeal to thee.
^
I charge my thoughts, be humble still,
And all my carriage mild,
Content, my Father, with thy will,
And peaceful as a child.
^
The patient soul, the lowly mind
Shall have a large reward:
Let saints in sorrow lie resigned,
And trust a faithful Lord.
PSALM CXXXII.5, 13 -- 18. Long Meter. (...) the Settlement of a Church; or,
The Ordination of a Minister,
1
WHERE shall we go to seek and find
An habitation for our GOD,
A dwelling for the eternal Mind
Among the sons of flesh and blood!
2
The GOD of Jacob chose the hill
Of Zion for his ancient rest;
And Zion is his dwelling still,
His church is with his presence blessed.
3
Here I will fix my gracious throne,
And reign forever, says the Lord;
Here shall my power and love be known,
And blessings shall attend my word.
4
Here will I meet the hungry poor,
And fill their souls with living bread;
Sinners that wait before my door
With sweet provisions ^^all be fed.
5
Girded with truth, and clothed with grace
My priests, my ministers shall shine;
Not Aaron in his costly dress
Appears so glorious and divine.
6
The saints, unable to contain
Their inward joy, shall shout and sing,
The son of David here will reign,
And Zion triumph in her King.
7
[Jesus shall see a numerous seed
Born here to uphold his glorious name;
His crown shall flourish on his head,
While all his foes are clothed with shame.
PSALM CXXXII.4, 5, 7, 8, 15 -- 17. Com. Me^^^ A Church established.
1
[NO sleep nor slumber to his eyes
Good David would afford,
Till he had found below the skies
A dwelling for the Lord.
2
The Lord in Zion placed his name,
His ark was settled there:
And there the assembled nation came
To worship thrice a year.
3
We trace no more those toilsome ways,
Nor wander far abroad;
Where ever thy people meet for praise,
There is a house for GOD.
PAUSE.

4
Arise, O King of grace, arise,
And enter to thy rest.
Lo! thy church waits with longing eyes
Thus to be owned and blessed.
5
Enter with all thy glorious train.
Thy spirit and thy word;
All that the ark did once contain
Could no such grace afford.
6
Here, mighty GOD, accept our vows,
Here let thy praise be spread;
Bless the provisions of thy house,
And fill thy poor with bread.
7
Here let the Son of David reign,
Let GOD's anointed shine;
Justice and truth his court maintain,
With love and power divine.
^
Here let him hold a lasting throne,
And as his kingdom grows,
Fresh honors shall adorn his crown,
And shame confound his foes.
PSALM CXXXIII. Common Meter. Brotherly Love.
^
LO, what an entertaining sight
Those freindly brethren prove,
Whose cheerful hearts in bands unite
Of harmony and love.
^
Where streams of bliss from Christ the spring
Descend to every soul,
And heavenly peace with balmy wing
Shades and bedews the whole.
^
It Is like the oil divinely sweet
On Aaron's reverend head,
The trickling drops perfumed his feet,
And over his garments spread.
^
It Is pleasant as the morning dews
That fall on Sion's hill,
Where GOD his mildest glory shows,
And makes his grace distill.
PSALM CXXXIII. Short Meter. Communion of Saints: or, Love and Worship in a
Family
^
BLESSED are the sons of peace,
Whose hearts and hopes are one,
Whose kind designs to serve and please
Through all their actions run.
^
Blessed is the pious house
Where zeal and friendship meet,
Their songs of praise, their mingled vows
Make their communion sweet.
3
Thus when on Aaron's head
They poured the rich perfume,
The oil through all his raiment spread,
And pleasure filled the room.
4
Thus on the heavenly hills
The saints are blessed above,
Where joy like morning dew distills,
And all the air is love.
PSALM CXXXIII. As the 122d Psalm. The Blessings of Friendship.
1
HOW pleasant it is to see
Kindred and friends agree,
Each in his proper station move,
And each fulfill his part
With sympathising heart,
In all the cares of life and love.
2
It Is like an ointment shed
On Aaron's sacred head,
Divinely rich, divinely sweet*
The oil through all the room
Diffused a choice perfume,
Ran through his Robes, and blessed his feet.
3
Like fruitful showers of rain
That water all the plain,
Descending from the neighboring hills;
Such streams of pleasure roll
Through every friendly soul,
Where love like heavenly dew distills.
Repeat the first Stanza to complete the Tune.
PSALM CXXXIV. Daily and Nightly Devotion.
1
YE that obey the immortal King,
Attend his holy place;
Bow to the glories of his power,
And bless his wondrous grace.

Lift up your hands by morning-light,
And send your souls on high;
Raise your admiring thoughts by night
Above the starry sky.

The GOD of Zion cheers our hearts
With rays of quickening grace;
The GOD that spreads the heavens abroad,
And rules the swelling seas.
PSALM CXXXV.1 -- 4, 14, 19 -- 21, First Part. Long Meter. The Church is GOD's
House and Care.
1
PRAISE ye the Lord, exalt his name.
While in his earthly courts ye wait.
Ye saints that to his house belong,
Or stand attending at (...) gate.
2
Praise ye the Lord, the Lord is good;
To praise his name is sweet employ:
Israel he chose of old, and still
His church is his peculiar joy.
3
The Lord himself will judge his saints;
He treats his servants as his friends;
And when he hears their sore complaints,
Repents the sorrows that he sends.
4
Through every age the Lord declares
His name, and breaks the oppressor's rod*
He gives his suffering servants rest,
And will be known the Almighty GOD.
5
Bless ye the Lord, who taste his love,
People and priests exalt his name:
Amongst his saints he ever dwells
His church is his Jerusalem.
PSALM CXXXV. Ver. 5 -- 12. Second Part. The Works of Creation, Providence,
Redemption of Israel, and Destruction of Enemies.
1
GREAT is the Lord, exalted high
Above all powers and every throne;
What ever he please in earth and sea,
Or heaven, or hell, his hand has done.
2
At his command the vapors rise,
The lightnings flash, the thunders roar;
He pours the rain, he brings the wind
And tempest from his airy store.
3
'Twas he those dreadful tokens sent,
O Egypt, through thy stubborn land;
When all thy firstborn, beasts and men,
Fell dead by his avenging hand.
4
What mighty nations, mighty kings
He slew, and their whole country gave
To Israel, whom his hand redeemed,
No more to be proud Pharaoh's slave.
5
His power the same, the same his grace,
That saves us from the hosts of hell:
And heaven he gives us to possess,
Whence those apostate angels fell.
PSALM CXXXV. Common Meter. Praise due to GOD, not to Idols.
1
AWAKE, ye saints: To praise your King
Your sweetest passions raise,
Your pious pleasure, while you sing,
Increasing with the praise.
2
Great is the Lord; and works unknown
Are his divine employ:
But still his saints are near his throne,
His treasure and his joy.
3
Heaven, earth, and sea confess his hand;
He bids the vapors rise;
Lightning and storm at his command
Sweep through the sounding skies.
4
All power that Gods or kings have claimed
Is found with him alone;
But heath^n gods should never be named
Where o^ ^ehovah's known.
5
Which of the stocks and stones they trust
Can give them showers of rain?
In vain they worship glittering dust,
And pray to GOD in vain.
6
[Their gods have tongues that speechless prove,
Such as their makers gave:
Their feet were never formed to move
Nor hands have power to save.
7
Blind are their eyes, their ears are deaf,
Nor hear when mortals pray;
Mortals that wait for their relief,
Are blind and deaf as they.]
8
Ye nations, know the living GOD,
Serve him with faith and fear;
He makes the churches his abode,
And claims your honors there.
PSALM CXXXVI. Common Meter. GOD's Wonders of Creation, Providence, Redemption

How gracious is our GOD!
5
He cleft the swelling sea in two;
His arm is great in might:
And gave the tribes a passage through;
His power and grace unite.
6
But Pharaoh's army there he drowned;
How glorious are his ways!
And brought his saints through desert ground:
Eternal be his praise.
7
Great monarchs fell beneath his hand;
Victorious is his sword;

He saw the nations dead in sin;
He felt his pity move*
How sad the state the world was in!
How boundless was his love!

He sent to save us from our woe;
His goodness never fails;
From death and hell, and every foe;
And still his grace prevals.

He formed the earth and seas,
And spread the heavens alone.
Thy mercy, Lord,
Shall still endure;

To cheer the darksome night.
His power and grace

The flower of Egypt, dead:
And thence his chosen tribes
With joy and glory led.
Thy mercy, Lord,
Shall still endure;
And ever sure
Abides thy Word.
5.
His power and lifted rod
Cleft the red sea in two;
And for his people made
A wondrous passage through.
His power and grace:
Are still the same;
And let his name
Have endless praise.
6
But cruel Pharaoh there
With all his host he drowned;
And brought his Israel safe
Through a long desert ground.
Thy mercy, Lord,
Shall still endure,
And ever sure
Abides thy word.
PAUSE.

7
The kings of Canaan sell
Beneath his dreadful hand;
While his own servants took
Possession of their land.
His power and grace
Are still the same;
And let his name
Have endless praise.]
8
He saw the nations lie,
All perishing in sin,
And pitied the sad state
The ruined world was in.
Thy mercy, Lord,
Shall still endure;
And ever sure
Abides thy word.
9
He sent his only Son
To save us from our woe,
From Satan, sin and death,
And every hurtful foe.
His power and grace
Are still the same;
And let his name
Have endless praise.
10
Give thanks aloud to God,
To GOD the heavenly king:
And let the spacious earth
His works and glories sing.
Thy mercy Lord,
Shall still, endure,
And ever sure
Abides thy word.
PSALM CXXXVI, Abridged. Long Meter.

2
Give to the Lord of lords renown,

When lords and kings are known no more.
3
He built the earth, he spread the sky,
And fixed the starry lights on high:
Wonders of grace to God belong
Repeat his mercies in your song

He fills the sun with morning light,
He bids the moon direct the night:
His mercies ever shall endure,
When suns and moons shall shine no more.
5
The Jews he freed from Pharaoh's hand.
And brought them to the promised land:
Wonders of grace to God belong
Repeat his mercies in your song.
6
He saw the Gentiles dead in sin,
And felt his pity move within:
His mercies ever shall endure
When death and sin shall reign no more.
7
He sent his Son with power to save
From guilt, and darkness, and the grave
Wonders of grace to God belong
Repeat his mercies in your song.
8
Through this vain world he guides our feet,
And leads us to his heavenly seat:

PSALM CXXXVII. The Babylonian Captivity.
1
ALONG the banks where Babel's current flows,
Our captive bands in deep dispondence stray'^
While Zion's fall in sad remembrance rose,
Her friends, her children mingled with the dead.
2
The tuneless harp, that once with joy we strung
When praise employed and mirth inspired the lay,
In mournful silence on the willows hung;
And growing grief prolonged the tedious day.
3
The barbarous tyrants, to increase the woe,
With taunting smiles a song of Zion claim;
Bid sacred praise in strains melodious flow,
While they blaspheme the great Jehovah's name.
4
But how, in heathen chains and lands unknown,
Shall Israel's sons, a song of Zion raise?
O hapless Salem, GOD's terrestial throne,
Thou land of glory, sacred mount of praise,
5
If ever my memory lose thy lovely name,
If my cold heart neglect my kindred race,
Let dire destruction sieze this guilty frame;
My hand shall perish and my voice shall cease.
6
Yet shall the Lord, who hears when Zion calls,
Overtake her foes with terror and dismay,
His arm avenge her desolated walls,
And raise her children to eternal day.
PSALM CXXXVIII Restoring and Preserv^ (...)
1

Angels shall hear the notes I raise,
Approve the song, and join the praise.

[Angels that make thy church their care
Shall witness my devotions there,
While holy zeal directs my eyes
To thy fair temple in the skies.]
3
I Will sing thy truth and mercy, Lord,
I Will sing the wonders of thy word;
Not all the works and names below
So much thy power and glory show.
4
To GOD I cried when troubles rose;
He heard me, and subdued my foes:
He did my rising fears control,
And strength diffused through all my soul.
5
The GOD of heaven maintains his state,
Frowns on the proud, and scorns the great,
But from his throne descends to bless
The humble souls that trust his grace.
6
Amidst a thousand snares I stand
Upheld and guarded by thy hand;
Thy words my fainting soul revive,
And keep my dying faith alive.
7
Grace will complete what grace begins,
To save from sorrows or from sins;
The work that wisdom undertakes,]
Eternal mercy never forsakes.
PSALM CXXXIX First Part Long Meter. The All-Seeing GOD.

LORD, thou have searched and seen me through;
Thine eye commands with piercing view

Are to my GOD distinctly known;
He knows the words I mean to speak
Ere from my opening lips they break.
3
Within thy circling power I stand,
On every side I find thy hand;
Awake, asleep, at home, abroad,
I am surrounded still with GOD.
4
Amazing knowledge, vast and great!
What large extent! what lofty height!
My soul with all the powers I boast,
Is in the boundless prospect lost.
5
Oh may these thoughts possess my breast,
Wherever I rove, wherever I rest;
Nor let my weaker passions dare
Consent to sin, for God is there.
PAUSE I.

6
Could I so false, so faithless prove,
To quit thy service and thy love,
Where, Lord, could I thy presence shun,
Or from thy dreadful glory run?
7
If up to heaven I take my flight,
It Is there thou dwell'st enthroned in light;
Or dive to hell, there vengeance reign^,
And Satan groans beneath thy chains.
8
If mounted on a morning ray
I fly beyond the Western sea,
Thy swifter hand would first arrive,
And there arrest thy fugitive.
9
Or should I try to shun thy sight
Beneath the spreading veil of night,
One glance of thine, one piercing ray
Would kindle darkness into day.
10
Oh may these thoughts possess my breast,
Wherever I rove, wherever I rest!
Nor let my weaker passions dare
Consent to sin, for God is there.
PAUSE. II.

1
The veil of night is no disguise,
No screen from thy All-searching eyes;
Thy hand can seize thy foes as soon
Through midnight shades as blazing noon.
2
Midnight and noon in this agree.
Great GOD they 're both alike to thee,
Not death can hide what GOD will spy,
And hell lies naked to his eye.
3
Oh may these thoughts possess my breast,
Wherever I rove, wherever I rest!
Nor let my weaker passions dare
Consent to sin, for God is there.
PSALM CXXXIX. Second Part. Long Meter. The wonderful Formation of Man.

'TWAS from thy hand, my GOD, I came,
A Work of such a curious frame;
In me thy fearful wonders shine.
And each proclaim thy skill divine.
^
Thine eyes could all my limbs survey,
Which yet in dark confusion lay:
Thou saw the daily growth they took,
Formed by the model of thy book.
^
By thee my growing parts were named,
And what thy sovereign counsels framed,
The breathing lungs, the beating heart.
Was copied with unerring art.
^
At last to show my Maker's name,
GOD stamped his Image on my frame,
And in some unknown moment joined
The finished members of the mind.
5
There the young seed^ of thought began,
And all the passions of the man,
Great GOD, our infant nature pays
Immortal tribute to thy praise.
PAUSE.

6
Lord, since in my advancing age
I Have acted on life's busy stage,
Thy thoughts of love to me surmount
The power of numbers to recount.
7
I could survey the ocean over,
And count each sand that makes the shore,
Before my swiftest thoughts could trace
The numerous wonders of thy grace.
8
These on my heart are still impressed,
With these I give my eyes to rest;
And at my waking hour I find
GOD and his love possess my mind.
PSALM CXXXIX. Third Part. Long Meter. Sincerity professed, and Grace tried; or,

1
MY GOD, what inward grief I feel,
When impious men transgress thy will!
I mourn to hear their lips profane,
Take thy tremendous name in vain.
2
Does not my soul detest and hate
The sons of malice and deceit?
Those that oppose thy laws and thee,
I count for enemies to me.
3
Lord, search my soul, try every thought
Though my own heart accuse me not,
Of walking in a false disguise,
I beg the trial of thine eyes.
4
Does secret mischief lurk within?
Do I indulge some unknown sin?
Oh turn my feet whenever I stray,
And lead me in thy perfect way.
PSALM CXXXIX. First Part. Common Meter. GOD is every where.
1
IN all my vast concerns with thee,
In vain my soul would try
To shun thy presence, Lord, or flee
The notice of thine eye.
2
Thy all-surrounding sight surveys
My rising and my rest,
My public walks, my private ways,
And secrets of my breast.
3
My thoughts lie open to the Lord
Before they are formed within;
And ere my lips pronounce the word,
He knows the sense I mean.
4
Oh wondrous knowledge, deep and high?
Where can a creature hide?
Within thy circling arms I lie,
Enclosed our every side.
5
So let thy grace surround me still,
And like a bulwark prove,
To guard my soul from every ill,
Secured by sovereign love,
PAUSE.

6
Lord, where shall guilty souls retire
Forgotten and unknown?
In hell they meet thy dreadful fire,
In heaven thy glorious throne.
7
Should I supp^ (...) vital breath
To 'scape the ^^ath divine,
Thy voice would break the bars of death,
And make the grave resign.
8
If winged with beams of morning-light
I fly beyond the west,
Thy hand, which must support my flight,
Would soon betray my rest.
9
If over my sins I think to draw
The curtains of the night,
The flaming eyes that guard thy law
Would turn the shades to light.
10
The beams of noon, the midnight-hour
Are both alike to thee:
Oh may I never provoke that power
From which I cannot flee.
PSALM CXXXIX. Second Part. Common Meter. The Wisdom of GOD in the Formation of
Man.
1
WHEN I with pleasing wonder stand,
And all my frame survey,
Lord, it is thy work; I own thy hand
Thus built my humble clay.
2
Thy hand my heart and reins possessed
Where unborn nature grew;
Thy wisdom all my features traced,
And all my members drew.
3
Thine eye with nicest care surveyed
The growth of every part;
Till the whole scheme thy thoughts had laid
Was copied by thy art.
4
Heaven, earth, and sea, and fire and wind
Show me thy wondrous skill;
But I review myself, and find
Diviner wonders still.
5
Thy awful glories round me shine,
My flesh proclaims thy praise;
Lord, to thy works of nature join
Thy miracles of grace.
PSALM CXXXIX.14, 17, 18. Third Part. Common Meter. The Mercies of GOD
innumerable. An Evening Psalm.
1
LORD, when I count thy mercies over,
They strike me with surprise;
Not all the sands that spread the shore,
To equal numbers rise.
2
My flesh with fear and wonder stands,
The product of thy skill,
And hourly blessings from thy hands
Thy thoughts of love reveal.
3
These on my heart by night I keep;
How kind, how dear to me!
Oh may the hour that ends my sleep
Still find my thoughts with thee.
PSALM CXL. Common Meter,
1
PROTECT us, Lord, from fatal harm;
Behold our rising woes;
We trust alone thy powerful arm,
To scatter all our foes.
2
Their tongue is like a poisoned dart*
Their thoughts are full of guile,
While rage and carnage swell their heart,
They wear a peaceful smile.
3
O GOD of grace, thy guardian care,
When foes without invade,
Or spread within a deeper snare,
Supplies our constant aid.
4
Let falsehood flee before thy face,
Thy heavenly truth extend,
All nations taste thy heavenly grace,
And all delusion end.
5
With daily bread the poor supply,
The cause of justice plead,
And be thy church exalted high,
With Christ the glorious head.
PSALM CXLI. Ver. 2, 3, 4, 5. Watchfulness and Brotherly Love. A Morning or
Evening Psalm.
1
MY GOD, accept my early vow^,
Like morning incense in thine house,
And let my nightly worship rise
Sweet as the evening sacrifice.
2
Watch over my lips, and guard them, Lord,
From every rash and heedless word;
Nor let my feet incline to tread
The guilty path where sinners lead.
3
Oh may the righteous, when I stray,
Smite and reprove my wandering way!
Their gentle words, like ointment shed,
Shall never bruise, but cheer my head.
4
When I behold them pressed with grief,
I Will cry to heaven for their relief;
And by my warm petitions prove
How much I prize their faithful love.
PSALM CXLII. GOD is the Hope of the Helpless.
1
TO GOD I made my sorrows known,
From GOD I sought relief;
In long complaints before his throne
I poured out all my grief.
2
My soul was overwhelmed with woes,
My heart began to break;
My GOD, who all my burdens knows,
Beholds the way I take.
3
On every side I cast mine eye,
And found my helpers gone,
While friends and strangers past me by
Neglected or unknown.
4
Then did I raise a louder cry,
And called thy mercy near,
"Thou art my portion when I die,
"Be thou my refuge here."
^
Lord, I am brought exceeding low,
Now let thine ear attend,
And make my foes who vex me know
I Have an almighty Friend.
^
From my sad prison set me free,
Then shall I praise thy name,
And holy men shall join with me,
Thy kindness to proclaim.
PSALM CXLIII. Complaint of heavy Afflictions in Mind and Body.
1
MY righteous Judge, my gracious GOD,
Hear when I spread my hands abroad,
And cry for succor from thy throne,
Oh make thy truth and mercy known.
2
Let judgment not against me pass;
Behold thy servant pleads thy grace
Should justice call us to thy bar,
No man alive is guiltless there.
3
Look down in pity, Lord, and see
The mighty woes that burden me;
Down to the dust my life is brought,
Like one long buried and forgot.
4
I dwell in darkness and unseen,
My heart is desolate within:
My thoughts in musing silence trace
The ancient wonders of thy grace.
5
Thence I derive a glimpse of hope
To bear my sinking spirits up;
I stretch my hands to GOD again,
And thirst like parched lands for rain.
6
For thee I thirst, I pray, I mourn;
When will thy smiling face return?
Shall all my joys on earth remove,
And GOD forever hide his love?
7
My GOD, thy long delay to save,
Will sink thy prisoner to the grave;
My heart grows faint, and dim mine eye;
Make haste to help before I die.
8
The night is witness to my tears,
Distressing pains, distressing fears;
Oh might I hear thy morning voice,
How would my wearied powers rejoice!
9
In thee I trust, to thee I sigh,
And lift my weary soul on high;
For thee sit waiting all the day,
And wear the tiresome hours away.
10
Break off my fetters, Lord, and show,
The path in which my feet should go:
If snares and foes beset the road,
I flee to hide me near my GOD.
11
Teach me to do thy holy will,
And lead me to thy heavenly hill:
Let the good spirit of thy love
Conduct me to thy courts above.
12
Then shall my soul no more complain,
The tempter then shall rage in vain;
And flesh, that was my foe before,
Shall never vex my spirit more.
PSALM CXLIV. First Part. Ver. 1, 2. Assistance and Victory in the spiritual
Warfare.
1
FOR ever blessed be the Lord,
My Savior and my shield;
He sends his spirit with his word,
To arm me for the field.
^
When sin and hell their force unite,
He makes my soul his care,
Instructs me in the heavenly fight,
And guards me through the war.
^
A friend and helper so divine
My fainting hope shall raise;
He makes the glorious victory mine,
And his shall be the praise.
PSALM CXLIV. Second Part. Ver. 3, 4, 5, 6. The Vanity of Man, and
Condescension of GOD.
^
LORD, what is man* poor feeble man,
Born of the earth at first?
His life a shadow, ^ight and vain,
Still hasting to the dust.
^
Oh what is feeble dying man,
Or all his sinful race,
That GOD should make it his concern
To visit him with grace?
3
That GOD who darts his lightnings down*
Who shakes the worlds above,
What terrors wait his awful frown,
How wondrous is his love!
PSALM CXLIV. Third Part. Ver. 12 -- 15 Grace above Riches; or, The happy
Nation.
^
HAPPY the city, where their sons
Like pillars round a palace set,
And daughters bright as polished stones
Give strength and beauty to the state.
^
Happy the land in culture dressed,
Whose stocks and corn, have large increase;
Where men securely work or rest,
Nor sons of plunder break their peace.
3
Happy the nation thus endowed,
But more divinely blessed are those
On whom the all-sufficient GOD
Himself with all his grace bestows.
PSALM CXLV. Long Meter. The Greatness of GOD.
1
MY GOD, my King, thy various praise
Shall fill the remnant of my days;
Thy grace employ my humble tongue
Till death and glory raise the song.
2
The wings of every hour shall bear
Some thankful tribute to thine ear*
And every setting sun shall see
New works of duty done for thee.
3
Thy truth and justice I Will proclaim;
Thy bounty flows, an endless stream;
Thy mercy swift; thine anger slow,
But dreadful to the stubborn foe.
4
Thy works with sovereign glory shine;
And speak thy Majesty divine;
Let every realm with joy proclaim
The sound and honor of thy name.
5
Let distant times and nations raise
The long succession of thy praise:
And unborn ages make my song
The joy and triumph of their tongue.
6
But who can speak thy wondrous deeds
Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds;
Vast and unsearchable thy ways,
Vast and immortal be thy praise.
PSALM CXLV.1 -- 7, 11 -- 13. First Part. The Greatness of GOD.
1
LONG as I live I Will bless thy name,
My king, my GOD of love;
My work and joy shall be the same,
In the bright world above.
^
Great is the Lord, his power unknown,
And let his praise be great;
I Will sing the honors of thy throne,
Thy works of grace repeat.
^
Thy grace shall dwell upon my tongue;
And while my lips rejoice,
The men that hear my sacred song
Shall join their cheerful voice.
^
Fathers to sons shall teach thy name,
And children learn thy ways;
Ages to come thy truth proclaim,
And nations sound thy praise.
^
Thy glorious deeds of ancient date
Shall through the world be known;
Thine arm of power, thy heavenly state*
With public splendour shown.
^
The world is managed by thy hands,
Thy saints are ruled by love;
And thine eternal kingdom stands,
Though rocks and hills remove.
PSALM CXLV. Second Part. Ver. 7, etc. The Goodness of God.
1
SWEET is the memory of thy grace,
My GOD, my heavenly king;
Let age to age thy righteousness
In sounds of glory sing.
2
GOD reigns on high, but never confines
His goodness to the skies;
Through the whole earth his bounty shine*
And every want supplies.
3
With longing eyes thy creatures wait
On Thee for daily food,
Thy liberal hand provides their mea
And fills their mouths with good.
4
How kind are thy compassions, Lord!
How slow thine anger moves!
But soon he sends his pardoning word
To cheer the souls he loves.
5
Creatures with all their endless race
Thy power and praise proclaim;
But saints that taste thy richer grace
Delight to bless thy name.
PSALM CXLV.14, 17, etc. Third (...) Mercy to Sufferers; or, GOD hearing Prayer.
1
LET every tongue thy goodness speak,
Thou sovereign Lord of all;
Thy strengthening hands uphold the weak*
And raise the poor that fall.
2
When sorrow bows the spirit down,
Or virtue lies distressed
Beneath some proud oppressor's frown,
Thou giv'st the mourners rest.
3
The Lord supports our sinking days,
And guides our giddy youth:
Holy and just are all his ways,
And all his words are truth.
4
He knows the pain his servants feel,
He hears his children cry*
And their best wishes to fulfill
His grace is ever nigh.
5
His mercy never shall remove
From men of heart sincere;
He saves the souls, whose humble love
Is joined with holy fear.
6
[His stubborn foes his sword shall slay,
And pierce their hearts with pain;
But none that serve the Lord shall say,
"They sought his aid in vain]
^
[My lips shall dwell upon his praise,
And spread his fame abroad;
Let all the sons of Adam raise
The honors of their GOD.]
PSALM CXLVI. Long Meter. Praise to GOD for his Goodness and Truth.
^
PRAISE ye the Lord, my heart shall join
In works so pleasant, so divine;
Now while the flesh is mine abode,
And when my soul ascends to GOD.
^
Praise shall employ my noblest powers,
While immortality endures;
My days of praise shall never be past,
While life and thought and being last.
^
Why should I make a man my trust?
Princes must die and turn to dust;
Their breath departs, their pomp and power,
And thoughts all vanish in an hour.
^
Happy the man, whose hopes rely
On Israel's GOD: He made the sky,
And earth, and seas, with all their train,
And none shall find his promise vain.
^
His truth forever stands secure:
He saves the oppressed, he feeds the poor;
He sends the laboring conscience peace,
And grants the prisoner sweet release.
^
The Lord to sight restores the blind;
The Lord supports the sinking mind;
He helps the stranger in distress,
The widow and the fatherless.
^
He loves the saints, he knows them well;
But turns the wicked down to hell:
Thy GOD, O Zion, ever reigns;
Praise him in everlasting strains.
PSALM CXLVI. As the 113th Psalm. Praise to GOD for his Goodness and Truth.
1
I WILL praise my Maker with my breath;
And when my voice is lost in death
Praise shall employ my nobler powers:
My days of praise shall never be past,
While life and thought and being last,
Or immortality endures.
2
Why should I make a man my trust?
Princes must die and turn to dust;
Vain is the help of flesh and blood;
Their breath departs, their pomp and power
And thoughts all vanish in an hour,
Nor can they make their promise good.
3
Happy the man, whose hopes rely
On Israel's GOD; he made the sky,
And earth and seas with all their train;
His truth forever stands secure:
He saves the oppressed, he feeds the poor,
And none shall find his promise vain.
4
The Lord has eyes to give the blind:
The Lord supports the sinking mind;
He sends the laboring conscience peace,
He helps the stranger in distress,
The widow and the fatherless,
And grants the prisoner sweet release.
5
He loves his saints, he knows them well,
But turns the wicked down to hell;
Thy GOD, O Zion, ever reigns;
Let every tongue, let every age,
In this exalted work engage:
Praise him in everlasting strains*
^
I Will praise him while he lends me br^ath,
And when my voice is lost in death
Praise shall employ my nobler powers:
My days of praise shall never be past,
While life and thought and being last,
Or immortality endures.
PSALM CXLVI. First Part. The Divine Nature, Providence, and Grace.
^
PRAISE ye the Lord; it is good to raise
Our hearts and voices in his praise:
His nature and his works invite
To make this duty our delight.
^
The Lord builds up Jerusalem,
And gathers nations to his name:
His mercy melts the stubborn soul,
And makes the broken spirit whole.
3
He formed the stars, those heavenly flames.
He counts their numbers, calls their names,
His sovereign wisdom knows no bound,
A deep where all our thoughts are drowned.
4
Great is our Lord, and great his might;
And all his glories infinite:
He crowns the meek, rewards the just,
And treads the wicked to the dust.
PAUSE.

^
Sing to the Lord, exalt him high,
Who spreads his clouds around the (...);
There he prepares the fruitful rain,
Nor lets the drops descend in vain.
6
He makes the grass the hills adorn,
And clothes the smiling fields with corn;
The beasts with food his hands supply,
And feeds the ravens when they cry.
7
What is the creature's skill or force?
The vigorous man, the warlike (...),
The sprightly wit, the active limb
All are too mean delights for him.
8
But saints are lovely in his sight:
He views his children with delight:
He sees their hope, he knows their fear,
And finds and loves his image there.
PSALM CXLVII. Second Part. Summer and Winter.
1
LET Zion praise the mighty GOD,
And make his honors known abroad;
For sweet the joy, our songs to raise
And glorious is the work of praise.
2
Our children live secure and blessed;
Our shores have peace, our cities rest;
He feeds our sons with finest wheat,
And adds his blessing to their meat.
3
The changing seasons he ordains,
The early and the latter rains;
His flakes of snow like wool he sends,
And thus the springing corn defends.
4
With hoary frost he strews the ground;
His hail descends with dreadful sound:
His icy bands the rivers hold,
And terror arms his wintry cold.
5
He bids the warmer breezes blow;
The ice dissolves the waters flow;
But he has nobler works and ways
To call his people to his praise.
6
Through all our realm his laws are shown;
His gospel through the nation known;
He has not thus revealed his word
To every land: praise ye the Lord.
PSALM CXLVII.7 -- 9, 13 -- 18. Common Meter. The Seasons of the Year.
1
WITH songs and honors sounding loud,
Address the Lord on high;
Over the heavens he spreads his cloud,
And waters veil the sky.
2
He sends his showers of blessings down
To cheer the plains below;
He makes the grass the mountains crown,
And corn in valleys grow.
3
He gives the grazing ox his meat,
He hears the ravens cry;
But man who tastes his finest wheat
Should raise his honors high.
4
His steady counsels change the face
Of the declining year;
He bids the sun cut short his race,
And wintery days appear.
5
His hoary frost, his fleecy snow
Descend and clothe the ground;
The liquid streams forbear to flow,
In icy fetters bound.
6
When from his dreadful stores on high
He pours the sounding hail,
The wretch that dares his GOD defy
Shall find his courage fail.
7
He sends his word and melts the snow,
The fields no longer mourn;
He calls the warmer gales to blow,
And bids the spring return.
8
The changing wind, the flying cloud,
Obey his mighty word:
With songs and honors sounding loud
Praise ye the sovereign Lord.
PSALM CXLVIII. Proper Meter. Praise to GOD from all Creatures.
YE tribes of Adam, join
With heaven, and earth, and seas,
And offer notes divine
To your Creator's praise.
Ye holy throng
Of angels bright,
In worlds of light
Begin the song.
2
Thou sun with dazzling rays,
And moon that rules the night,
Shine to your Maker's praise,
With stars of twinkling light.
His power declare,
Ye floods on high,
And clouds that fly
In empty air.
3
The shining worlds above
In glorious order stand,
Or in swift courses move,
By his supreme command.
He spoke the word,
And all their frame
From nothing came
To praise the Lord,
4
He moved their mighty wheels
In unknown ages past,
And each his word fulfils
While time and nature last.
In different ways
His works proclaim
His wondrous name,
And speak his praise.
PAUSE.

5
Let all the earth-born race,
And monsters of the deep
The fish that cleave the seas,
Or in their bosom sleep,
From sea and shore
Their tribute pay,
And still display
Their Maker's power.
6
Ye vapors, hail, and snow,
Praise ye the Almighty Lord,
And stormy winds that blow
To execute his word.
When lightnings shine
Or thunders roar,
Let earth adore
His hand divine.
7
Ye mountains near the skies,
With lofty cedars there,
And trees of humbler size
That fruit in plenty bear;
Beasts wild and tame,
Birds, flies and worms,
In various forms
Exalt his name.
8
Ye kings and judges, fear
The Lord the sovereign king;
And while you rule us here,
His heavenly honors sing:
Nor let the dream
Of power and state
Make you forget
His power supreme.
9
Virgins and youths engage
To sound his praise divine,
While infancy and age
Their feeble voices join:
Wide as he reigns
His name be sung
By every tongue
In endless strains.
10
Let all the nations fear
The GOD that rules above;
He brings his people near,
And makes them taste his love:
While earth and sky
Attempt his praise
His saints shall raise
His honors high.
PSALM CXLVIII. Paraphrased in Long Meter. Universal Praise to GOD.
1
LOUD Hallelujahs to the Lord
From distant worlds where creatures dwell:
Let heaven begin the solemn word,
And sound it dreadful down to hell.
Note. This Psalm may be sung to the Tune of the old 112th or 127th Psalm if
these two lines be added to every Stanza (viz)

Each of his works his name displays.
But they can never complete the praise
Otherwise it must be sung to the usual Tunes of the Long Meter.

2
The Lord, how absolute he reigns
Let every angel bend the knee;
Sing of his love in heavenly strains,
And speak how fierce his terrors be.
3
High on a throne his glories dwell,
An awful throne of shining bliss:
Fly through the world, O sun and tell,
How dark thy beams compared to his.
4
Awake ye tempests and his fame
In sounds of dreadful praise declare;
Let the sweet whisper of his name
Fill every gentler breeze of air.
5
Let clouds, and winds, and waves agree
To join their praise with blazing fire;
Let the firm earth and rolling sea
In this eternal song conspire.
6
Ye flowery plains, proclaim his skill;
Ye valleys sink before his eye;
And let his praise from every hill
Rise tuneful to the neighboring sky.
7
Ye stubborn oaks, and stately pines,
Bend your high branches and adore:
Praise him, ye beasts, in different strains;
The lamb must bleat, the lion roar.
8
Ye birds, his praise must be your theme,
Who formed to song your tuneful voice;
While the dumb fish that cut the stream
In his protecting care rejoice.
9
Mortals, can you refrain your tongue,
When nature all around you sings?
Oh for a shout from old and young,
From humble swains and lofty kings!
10
Wide as his vast dominion lies
Make the Creator's name be known;
Loud as his thunder shout his praise,
And sound it lofty as his throne.
11
Jehovah! it is a glorious word!
Oh may it dwell on every tongue!
But saints who best have known the Lord
Are bound to raise the noblest song.
12
Speak of the wonders of that love
Which Gabriel plays on every chord:
From all below and all above,
Loud Hallelujah's to the Lord.
PSALM CXLVIII. Short Meter. Universal Praise.
1
LET every creature join
To praise the eternal GOD;
Ye heavenly hosts, the song begin,
And sound his name abroad.
2
Thou sun with golden beams,
And moon with paler rays,
Ye starry lights, ye twinkling flames,
Shine to your Maker's praise.
3
He built those worlds above,
And fixed their wondrous frame;
By his command they stand or move,
And ever speak his name.
4
Ye vapors, when ye rise,
Or fall in showers or snow,
Ye thunders murmuring round the skies,
His power and glory show.
5
Wind, hail, and flashing fire,
Agree to praise the Lord,
When ye in dreadful storms conspire
To execute his word.
6
By all his works above
His honors be expressed;
But saints that taste his saving love
Should sing his praises best.
PAUSE I.

7
Let earth and ocean know
They owe their maker praise;
Praise him, ye watery worlds below,
And monsters of the seas.
8
From mountains near the sky
Let his high praise resound,
From humble shrubs and cedars high,
And vales and fields around.
9
Ye lions of the wood,
And tamer beasts that graze,
Ye live upon his daily food,
And he expects your praise.
10
Ye birds of lofty wing,
On high his praises bear;
Or sit on flowery boughs and sing
Your Maker's glory there.
11
Ye reptile myrlads join,
TO exalt his glorious name,
And flies in beauteous forms that shine,
His wondrous skill proclaim.
12
By all the earth-born race,
His honors be expressed,
But saints that knew his heavenly grace,
Should learn to praise him best.
PAUSE II.

13
Monarchs of wide command,
Praise ye the eternal king,
Judges, adore that sovereign hand,
Whence all your honors spring.
14
Let vigorous youth engage
To sound his praises high;
While growing babes and withering age
Their feebler voices try.
15
United zeal be shown
His wondrous same to raise;
GOD is the Lord; his name alone
Deserves our endless praise.
16
Let nature join with art,
And all pronounce him blessed.
But saints that dwell so near his heart
Should sing his praises best.
PSALM CXLIX. Praise GOD, all his Saints; or, The Saints judging the World.

ALL ye that love the Lord, rejoice,
And let your songs be new;
Amidst the church with cheerful voice
His later wonders show.
2
The Jews the people of his grace,
Shall their Redeemer sing;
And Gentile nations join the praise
While Zion owns her king.
3
The Lord takes pleasure in the just,
Whom sinners treat with scorn:
The meek that lie despiss'd in dust
Salvation shall adorn,
4
Saints should be joyful in their king
Even on a dying bed:
And like the souls in glory sing,
For GOD shall raise the dead.
5
Then his high praise shall fill their tongues,
Their hand shall wield the sword:
And vengeance shall attend their songs,
The vengeance of the Lord.
6
When Christ his judgment seat ascends,
And bids the world appear,
Thrones are prepared for all his friends
Who humbly loved him here.
7
Then shall they rule with iron-rod
Nations that dared rebel:
And join the sentence of their GOD,
On tyrants doomed to hell.
8
The royal sinners bound in chains
New triumph shall afford:
Such honor for the saints remains:
Praise ye and love the Lord.
PSALM CL.1, 2, 6. A Song of Praise.
1
IN GOD's own house pronounce his praise,
His grace he there reveals;
To heaven your joy and wonder raise,
For there his glory dwells.
2
Let all your sacred passions move,
While you rehearse his deeds;
But the (...) work of saving love
Your highest praise exceeds.
3
All that have motion, life and breath,
Proclaim your Maker blessed;
Yet when my voice expires in death,
My soul shall praise him best.

HYMNS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS.
HYMN I. A Song to the Lamb that was slain. Rev.
^
BEHOLD the glories of the Lamb,
Amidst the Father's throne;
Prepare new honors for his name,
And songs before unknown.
^
While angels worship at his feet,
And saints around him throng,
The church on earth with joy shall meet,
And join the heavenly song.
^
Eternal Father, who shall look
Through all thy secret will?
Who but the Son shall take the book,
And open every seal?
^
He shall accomplish thy decrees,
And all thy wonders tell;
Lo! in his sovereign hand, the keys
Of heaven, and death, and hell.
^
He has redeemed our souls with blood,
Has broke the prisoners chain;
Has made us kings and priests with GOD,
And we with him shall reign.
6
Now, to the Lamb, that once was slain,
Be endless blessings paid;
While saints and angels fill his train,
And glories crown his head.
HYMN II. The nativity of Christ. Luke i.30. etc. ii.10.
^
BEHOLD, the grace appears!
The promise is fulfilled;
Mary, the wondrous virgin, bears,
And Jesus is the child!
2
To bring the glorious news,
A heavenly form appears:
He tells the shepherds of their joys,
And banishes their fears.
3
Go humble swains; (said he)
To David's city fly;
The promised infant, born today,
Does in a manger lie.
4
With looks and hearts serene.
Go, visit Christ, your king;
And straight a flaming t^^op was seen;
The shepherds heard them sing --
5
Glory to God on high!
And heavenly peace on earth:
Good will to men, to angels joy,
At the Redeemer's birth!
6
In worship so divine,
Let saints employ their tongues;
With the celestial hosts we join,
And loud repeat their songs.
7
Glory to God on high!
And heavenly peace on earth,
Good will to men, to angels joy,
At our Redeemer's birth.
HYMN, III. Submission to afflictive providence, Job. i.21.
1
NAKED, as from the earth we came,
And rose to life at first,
We to the earth return again,
And mingle with our dust.
2
The dear delights we here enjoy,
And fondly call our own,
Are but short favors borrowed now,
To be repaid anon.
3
It Is GOD who lifts our comforts high
Or sinks them in the grave;
He gives, and (blessed be his name!)
He takes but what he gave.
4
Peace, all our angry passions then;
Let each rebellious sigh,
Be silent at his sovereign will,
And every murmur die.
5
If smiling mercy crown our lives,
Its praises shall be spread,
And we'll adore the justice too,
Which strikes our comforts dead.
HYMN IV. The invitation of the gospel, Isa. iv.12, etc.
1
LET every mortal ear attend,
And every heart rejoice,
The trumpet of the gospel sounds
With an inviting voice.
2
Come all ye hungry starving souls,
Who feed upon the wind,
And vainly strive with earthly toys,
To fill the immortal mind;
3
Eternal wisdom has prepared
A soul-reviving feast,
And bids your longing appetites
The rich provision taste.
4
Come, ye who pant for living streams,
And pine away, and die;
Here you may quench your raging thirst
With springs that never dry.
5
Rivers of love and mercy here
In spreading oceans join;
Salvation in abundance flows
Like floods of milk and wine.
6
Great GOD, the treasures of thy love
Are everlasting mines,
Deep as our helpless miseries are,
And boundless as our sins.
HYMN V. Blessedness of gospel time. Isa. v.2, 7, etc.
1
HOW beauteous are their ^ee^
Who stand on Zion's hill,
Who bring salvation on their tongues,
And words of peace reveal!
2
How charming is their voice!
How sweet the tidings are!
"Zion, behold thy Savior king,
"He reigns and triumphs here.
3
How happy are our ears,
That hear this joyful sound,
Which kings and prophets longed to know
And sought, but never found!
4
How blessed our ravished eyes,
That see this heavenly light;
Prophets and kings desired it long,
But died without the sight!
5
The watchmen join their voice,
And tuneful notes employ;
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
And deserts learn the joy.
6
The Lord displays his arm
Through all the earth abroad;
Let every nation now behold
Their Savior and their GOD.
HYMN VI. The triumph of Faith, Romans viii.33.
1
WHO shall the Lord's elect condemn,
It Is God who justifies their souls,
And mercy, like a mighty stream,
Over all their sins divinely rolls.
2
Who shall adjudge the saints to hell?
It Is Christ who suffered in their stead;
And, the salvation to fulfill,
Behold him rising from the dead.
3
He lives! He lives! and fits above,
Forever interceding there:
Who shall divide us from his love,
Or what shall tempt us to despair?
4
Shall persecution, or distress,
Famine, or sword or nakedness?
He who has loved us, bears us through,
And makes us more than conqu'rors too.
5
Faith has an overcoming power,
It triumphs in the dying hour:
Christ is our life, our joy, our hope,
Nor can we fink with such a prop.
6
Not all that men on earth can do,
Nor powers on high, nor powers below,
Shall cause his mercy to remove,
Or wean oar hearts from Christ our love.
HYMN VII. Christ our strength. 2 Cor XII.7, 9, 10.
1
OH, let me hear my Savior say,
Thy strength be equal to thy day,
Then I Will rejoice in deep distress,
And trust secure his sovereign grace.
2
My weakness shall my glory prove,
That power may aid me from above;
When flesh is weak, my soul is strong;
Be grace my shield and Christ my song.
3
All things I do, all sufferings bear,
While God, my strength is with me here;
But, he withdrawn, temptations reign,
And pains and weakness rise again.
4
So Sampson, when his locks were lost,
First bowed beneath Philistia's host;
Shook his vain limbs with sore surprise,
Made feeble sight, and lost his eyes.
HYMN. VIII. Hosannah to Christ. Ma. xxi.9. Luke xix 33
1
HOSANNA to the royal Son,
Of David's ancient line
His natures two, his person one,
Mysterious and divine.
2
The root of David here we find
And offspring is the same;
Eternity and time are joined
In our Emanuel's name.
3
Blessed he who comes to wretched men
With peaceful news from heaven!
Hosannah in the highest strain
To Christ the Lord be given!
4
Let mortals never refuse to take
Hosannah on their tongues*
Lest rocks and stones should rise, and break
Their silence into songs.
HYMN IX. Hope of Heaven, by the Resurrection of Christ. 1st Pet. 1, 3, 4, 5.
1
BLESSED be the everlasting GOD,
The Father of our Lord;
Be his abounding mercy praised,
His majesty adored.
2
When from the dead he raised his Son,
And called him to the sky,
He gave our souls a lively hope
That they should never die.
3
What though our sins have doomed our flesh
Awhile with dust to blend,
Yet as the Savior rises first,
His followers shall ascend.
4
There Is an inheritance divine
Reserved against ^^at day,
It Is uncorrupted, undefiled,
And cannot waste away.
5
Saints by the power of GOD are kept,
Till full salvation come:
We walk by faith, as strangers here,
Till Christ shall call us home.
HYMN X. Adoption, 1 John, iii. etc. Gal. vi.^.
1
BEHOLD, what wondrous grace
The Father has bestowed
Oh sinners, of a mortal race,
To call them -- sons of God!
2
It Is no surprising thing
That we should be unknown;
The Jewish world knew not their king,
God's everlasting Son:
3
Nor can it yet appear
How great we must be made;
But, when we see our Savior near,
We shall be like our head.
4
We shall no longer lie
Like slaves, beneath the throne
Our faith shall Abba Father cry,
And he the kindred own.
HYMN XI. Salvation, Righteousness, and Strength in Christ, Isa. xiv.21 -- 25.
1
JEHOVAH speaks -- let Israel hear!
Let all the earth rejoice and fear;
While God's eternal Son proclaims
His sovereign honors, and his names:
2
"I am the last, and I the first,
"The Savior God, and God the just;
"Look up to me, from distant lands,
"Light, life, and heaven, are in my hands.
3
"I by my holy name have sworn,
"Nor shall the word in vain return;
"To me, shall all things bend the knee,
"And every tongue shall swear to me.
4
"In me alone, shall men confess
"Lies all their strength and righteousness;
"But such as dare despise my name,
"I Will clothe with everlasting shame.
5
"In me, the Lord, shall all the seed
"Of Israel, from their sins be freed;
"And, by their shining graces prove,
"Their interest in my pardoning love."
HYMN XII. Youth and Judgment. Eccl. xi.
1
YE sons of Adam, vain and young,
Indulge your eyes, indulge your tongue,
Taste the delights your souls desire,
And give a loose to all your fire.
2
Pursue the pleasures you design,
And cheer your hearts with songs and wine;
Enjoy the day of mirth -- but know
There is a day of judgment too!
3
God, from on high, beholds your thoughts,
His book records your secret faults;
The works of darkness you have done,
Must rise unveiled before his throne.
4
The vengeance, to your follies due,
Should strike your hearts with terror through;
How will you stand before his face,
Or answer for his injured grace?
5
Almighty God, turn off their eyes
From works of vanity and lies;
And let the terrors of thy word
Awake their souls to fear the Lord.
HYMN XIII. Advice to Youth, Eccl. xii, 1, 7.
1
NOW, in the heat of youthful blood.
Remember your Creator God:
Behold, the months come hastening on,
When you shall say -- my joys are gone!
2
Behold, the aged sinner goes,
Laden with guilt and heavy woes,
Down to the regions of the dead,
With endless curses on his head.
3
The dust returns to dust again;
The soul, in agonies of pain,
Ascends to God; not there to dwell,
But hears her doom, and sinks to hell.
4
Eternal king! I fear thy name:
Teach me to know -- now frail I am --
And when my soul must hence remove,
Give me a mansion in thy love.
HYMN XIV. Justification by Faith, not by Works. Romans iii.19 -- 22.
1
VAIN are the hopes, the sons of men
On their own works have built;
Their hearts, by nature, all unclean,
And all their actions guilt.
2
Let Jew and Gentile stop their mouths,
Without a murmuring word,
And all the race of Adam stand
In guilt before the Lord.
3
In vain, we ask GOD's righteous law
To justify us now;
Since -- to convince, and to condemn --
In all the law can do.
4
Jesus, how glorious is thy grace,
When in thy name we trust!
Our faith receives a righteousness
Which makes the sinner just.
HYMN XV. Regeneration, John 1.13. and iii.3 etc.
1
NOT all the outward forms on earth,
Nor rites which GOD has given,
Nor will of man, nor blood, nor birth,
Can raise a soul to heaven.
2
The sovereign will of GOD, alone
Creates us heirs of grace;
Born in the image of his Son,
A new peculiar race.
3
The spirit, like some heavenly wind,
Breathes on the sons of flesh;
Creates anew the carnal mind,
And forms the man afresh.
4
Our quickened souls awake -- and rise
From the long sleep of death;
On heavenly things we fix our eyes.
And praise employs our breath.
HYMN XVI. Heaven invisible and holy, 1 Cor. ii.9, 10. Rev. xxi.27.
1
NOR eye has seen, nor ear has heard,
Nor sense, nor reason known,
What joys the Father has prepared
For those who love the Son.
2
But the good spirit of the Lord
Reveals a heaven to come;
The beams of glory, in his word,
Allure and guide us home.
3
Pure are the joys above the sky,
And all the regions peace;
No wanton lips or envious eye,
Can see or taste the bliss.
4
Those holy gates forever bar
Pollution, sin, and shame;
None shall obtain admittance there,
But followers of the Lamb.
5
He keeps the Father's book of life,
There all the names are found
The hypocrite in vain shall strive
To tread the heavenly ground.
HYMN XVII. The Fall and Recovery of Man: Or, Christ and Satan at enmity. Genesis
iii.1.15, 17, Gal. iv.4, Col. ii.15.
1
DECEIVED by subtle snares of hell,
Adam, our head, our father, fell;
His unborn race received the wound,
And heavy curses smote the ground.
2
Thus says the vengeance of the Lord --
But satan found a worse reward;
"Let everlasting hatred be
"Betwixt the woman's seed and thee.
3
"The woman's seed shall be my Son;
"He shall destroy what thou have done --
"Shall break thy head -- and only feel
"Thy malice raging at his heel."
4
He spoke -- and bade four thousand years
Roll on -- at length his Son appears;
Angels, with joy descend to earth,
And sing the blessed Redeemer's birth.
5
Lo, by the sons of hell he dies!
But, as he hung 'twixt earth and skies,
He gave their prince a fatal blow,
And triumphed over the powers below.
HYMN XVIII. Conviction of sin by the law, To. vii, 8, etc.
1
LORD, how secure my conscience lay,
And felt no inward dread;
I lived awhile without the law,
And thought my sins were dead.
2
My hopes of heaven were firm and bright,
But since the precept came
I stand convicted by its light,
And find how vile I am.
3
I Am like a helpless captive sold,
Beneath the power of sin;
I cannot do the good I would,
Nor keep my conscience clean.
4
My God, I Will cry with every breath,
For some kind power to save,
To break the yoke of sin and death,
And thus redeem the slave.
HYMN XIX. Love to God and our Neighbor. Mat. xxii.
1
THUS says the first, the great, command,
Let all thy powers unite,
To love thy Maker and thy God,
With vigor and delight.
2
Then shall thy neighbor, next in place,
Thy warm affections prove;
And be thy kindness to thyself
The measure of thy love.
3
This Moses and the prophets spoke,
And Jesus from above;
For want of this the law is broke,
And all the law is love.
4
But oh, how base our passions are!
How cold our blinded zeal!
Lord, fill our hearts with warm desires,
To learn and do thy will.
HYMN XX. Election, sovereign and free, To. ix.21.
1
THE potter moulds the pliant clay,
And forms to various shapes with ease;
Such is our God, and such are we,
The subjects of his high decrees.
2
May not the sovereign Lord on high
Dispense his savours as he will,
Choose some to life, while others die,
And yet be just and gracious still?
3
Shall man reply against the Lord,
And call his Maker's ways unjust,
The thunder of whose dreadful word
Can crush a thousand worlds to dust?
4
But, O my soul, if truth so bright
Should dazzle and confound thy sight,
Yet still his written will obey,
And wait the great decisive day.
5
Then shall he make his justice known,
And the whole world, before his throne,
With joy or terror, shall confess
His sovereign power and pardoning grace.
HYMN XXI. Moses and Christ; or, sin against the law and gospel, Joh. i.17. He.
iii.3, 5, 6, x.28.
1
THE law by Moses came,
But peace, and truth, and love,
Were brought by Christ (a nobler name)
Descending from above.
2
Amidst the house of God
Their different works were done;
Moses a faithful servant stood,
But Christ -- a faithful Son. --
3
Then to his new commands
Be strict obedience paid;
Over all his Father's house he stands
The sovereign and the head.
4
The man who durst despise
The law which Moses brought,
Behold! how terribly he dies
For his presumptuous fault:
5
But sorer vengeance falls
On that rebellious race,
Who hate to hear when Jesus calls
And dare resist his grace.
HYMN XXII. The different Success of the Gospel, 1 Cor. i.23, 24. 2 Cor. ii.16.
1 Cor. iii 6,7.
1
CHRIST and his cross are all our theme;
The myst'ries which we speak,
Are scandal in the Jews esteem,
And folly to the Greek:
2
But souls, enlightened from above,
With joy receive the word;
They see what wisdom, power, and love,
Shine in their dying Lord.
3
The vital savor of his name
Restores their fainting breath;
But unbelief perverts tbe same
To guilt, despair, and death.
4
'Till God diffuse his graces down,
Like showers of heavenly rain,
In vain Apollos sows the ground,
And Paul may plant in vain.
HYMN XXIII. Children devoted to God. Genesis xvii.7.10. Acts xvi.14, 15, 33. (For
those who practice Infant Baptism.)
1
THUS says the mercy of the Lord,
"I Will be a God to thee;
"I Will bless thy numerous race -- and they
"Shall prove a seed for me."
2
Abra'm believed the promised grace,
And gave his sons to God;
But water seals the blessing now,
Which once was sealed with blood.
3
Thus Lydia sanctified her house,
When she received the word;
Thus the believing jailor gave
His household to the Lord.
4
Thus later saints, eternal king,
Thine ancient truth embrace;
To thee their infant offspring bring,
And humbly claim the grace.
HYMN XXIV. Christ's Compassion to the Weak and Tempted, Heb. iv. 15, 10. and
v.9. Mat. xii.20.
1
WITH joy we meditate the grace
Of our High Priest, above;
His heart is made of tenderness,
His bowels melt with love.
2
Touched with a sympathy within,
He knows our feeble frame,
He knows what sore temptations mean,
For he has felt the same.
3
But spotless, innocent, and pure,
The great Redeemer stood;
While satan's firey darts he bore,
And did resist to blood.
4
He, in the days of feeble flesh,
Poured out his cries and tears;
And, in his measure, feels afresh
What every member bears.
5
Then let our humble faith address
His mercy and his power;
We shall obtain delivering grace
In the distressing hour.
HYMN XXV. Submission and Deliverance, Genesis xxii.6.
1
SAINTS, at your heavenly Father's word,
Give up your honors to the Lord;
He shall restore what you resign.
Or grant you blessings more divine.
2
So Abra'm, with obedient hand,
Led forth his son at God's command;
The wood, the fire, the knife he took,
His arm prepared the dreadful stroke.
3
"Abra'm, forbear, the angel cried,
"Thy faith is known, thy love is tried;
"Thy son shall live -- and in thy race
"Shall all the nations learn my grace."
4
Just in the last distressing hour
The Lord displays delivering power;
The mount of danger is the place,
Where we shall see surprising grace.
HYMN XXVI. Pharisee and Publican, Luke xviii.10.
1
BEHOLD how sinners disagree,
The Publican and Pharisee!
One does his righteousness proclaim,
The other owns his guilt and shame.
2
This man at humble distance stands,
And cries for grace with lifted hands;
That boldly rises near the throne,
And talks of duties he has done.
3
The Lord their different language knows,
And different answers he bestows:
The humble soul, with grace he crowns,
While on the proud his anger frowns.
4
Dear Father, let me never be
Joined with the boasting Pharisee;
I have no merits of my own,
But plead the sufferings of thy Son.
HYMN XXVII. Holiness and Grace, Tit. ii.10 -- 13.
1
SO let our lips and lives express
The holy gospel we profess:
So let our works and virtues shine
To prove the doctrine ALL DIVINE.
2
Thus shall we best proclaim abroad
The honors of our Savior God;
When the salvation reigns within
And grace subdues the power of sin.
3
Our flesh and sense must be denied,
Passion and envy, lust and pride;
While justice, temperance, truth, and love,
Our inward piety approve.
4
Religion bears our spirits up,
While we expect that blessed hope,
The bright appearance of the Lord,
And faith stands leaning on his word.
HYMN XXVIII. Love and Charity, 1 Cor. xiii.2 -- 7.
1
LET Pharisees, of high esteem,
Their faith and zeal declare;
All their religion is a dream,
If love be wanting there.
2
Love suffers long with patient eye,
Nor is provoked in haste;
She lets the present inj'ry die,
And long forgets the past.
3
She lays her own advantage by
To seek her neighbor's good;
So God's own Son came down to die,
And bought our lives with blood.
4
Love is the grace which keeps her power,
In realms of light above;
There faith and hope are known no more,
But saints forever love.
HYMN XXIX. Religion vain without Love, 1 Cor, xiii:1, 2, 3.
1
HAD I the tongues of Greeks and Jews,
And nobler speech than angels use,
If love be absent, I am found
Like tinkling brass, an empty sound.
2
Were I inspired to preach and tell
All that is done in heaven and hell;
Or could my faith the world remove,
Still I am nothing, without love.
3
Should I distribute all my store
To feed the bowels of the poor,
Or give my body to the flame,
To gain a martyr's glorious name --
4
If love to God, and love to men
Be absent -- all my hopes are vain: --
Nor tongues, nor gifts, nor firey zeal,
The work of love can ever fulfill.
HYMN XXX. The Death of a Sinner.
1
MY thoughts on awful subjects roll,
Damnation and the dead;
What horrors seize the guilty soul
Upon a dying bed.
2
Lingering about these mortal shores,
She makes a long delay;
'Till, like a flood with rapid force,
Death sweeps the wretch away!
3
Then, swift and dreadful, she descends
Down to the firey coast;
Among abominable fiends,
Herself a frightful ghost.
4
There endless crowds of sinners lie,
And darkness makes their chains;
Tortured with keen despair, they cry,
Yet wait for fiercer pains.
5
Not all their anguish, and their blood,
For their own guilt atones;
Nor the compassion of a God
Shall hearken to their groans.
6
Amazing grace, which kept my breath,
Nor bid my soul remove.
'Till I had learned my Savior's death,
And well insur'd his love!
HYMN XXXI. The Death and Burial of a Saint.
1
WHY should we mourn departing friends?
Or shake at death's alarms?
It Is but the voice which Jesus sends
To call them to his arms.
2
Are we not tending upward too
As fast as time can move?
Nor would we wish the hours more slow
To keep us from our love.
3
Why should we tremble to convey
Their bodies to the tomb?
There the dear flesh of Jesus lay,
And left a long perfume.
4
The graves of all his saints he blessed,
And softened every bed:
Where should the dying members rest,
But with the dying head?
5
Thence he arose, ascending high,
And showed our feet the way:
Up to the Lord our souls shall fly,
And hail the rising day.
6
Then let the last loud trumpet sound,
And bid our kindred rise;
Awake, ye nations, from the ground,
Ye saints, ascend the skies.
HYMN XXXII. A Morning Song.
1
ONCE more, my soul, the rising day
Salutes thy waking eyes;
Once more, my voice, thy tribute pay
To him who rolls the skies.
2
Night unto night his name repeats,
The day renews the sound,
Wide as the heaven, on which he sits
To turn the seasons round.
3
It Is he supports my mortal frame,
My tongue shall speak his praise;
My sins would rouse his wrath to flame --
And yet his wrath delays!
4
A thousand wretched souls are fled
Since the last setting sun,
And yet thou lengthenest out my thread,
And yet my moments run.
5
Dear God, let all my hours be thine,
While I enjoy the light;
Then shall my sun in smiles decline,
And bring a pleasing night.
HYMN XXXIII. An Evening Song.
^
DREAD Sovereign, let my evening song
Like holy incense rise;
Assist the offerings of my tongue
To reach the lofty skies.
^
Through all the dangers of the day
Thy hand was still my guard;
And still, to drive my wants away,
Thy mercy stood prepared.
3
Perpetual blessings from above
Incompass me around,
But Oh, how few returns of love
Has my Creator found!
4
What have I done for him who died
To save my wretchd soul?
How are my follies multiplied,
Fast as my minutes roll!
5
Lord, with this guilty heart of mine,
To thy dear cross I flee;
And to thy grace my soul resign,
To be renewed by thee.
6
Sprinkled afresh with pardoning blood,
I Would lay me down to rest;
As in the embraces of my God,
Or on my Savior's breast.
HYMN XXXIV. Lord's Day: or, Delight in Ordinances.
1
WELCOME, sweet day of rest,
Which saw the Lord arise;
Welcome, to this reviving breast,
And these rejoicing eyes!
2
The King himself comes near,
And feasts his saints today;
Here we may sit, and see him here,
And love, and praise, and pray.
3
One day amidst the place
Where heavenly glories shine,
Is sweeter than ten thousand days
In all the joys of sin.
^
My willing soul would stay
In such a frame as this;
And sit, and sing herself away
To everlasting bliss.
HYMN XXXV. Death and Eternity.
1
STOOP down, my thoughts, which use to rise,
Converse a while with death:
Think how a gasping mortal lies,
And pants away his breath.
2
His quivering lips hang feebly down,
His pulses saint and few;
Then speechless, with a doleful groan,
He bids the world adieu.
3
But Oh, the soul, which never dies!
At once it leaves the clay!
Ye thoughts, pursue it where it flies,
And trace its wondrous way.
4
Up to the courts where angels dwell,
It mounts triumphing there;
Or devils plunge it down to hell,
In terror and despair!
^
And must my body faint and die?
And must this soul remove?
Oh, for some guardian angel nigh,
To bear it safe above.
^
Almighty Savior, to thy hand,
My naked soul I trust;
My flesh shall wait thy kind command,
To mingle with the dust,
HYMN XXXVI. Frailty and Folly.
HOW short and hasty is our life!
How vast our souls' affairs!
Yet senseless mortals vainly strive
To lavish out their years.
^
Our days run thoughtlesly along,
Without a moment's stay;
Just like a story, or a song,
We pass our lives away.
3
God, from on high, invites us home,
But we march needless on,
And, ever hastening to the tomb,
Stoop downward as we run.
4
How we deserve the deepest hell,
Who slight the joys above!
What chains of vengeance should we feel,
Who break such cords of love!
5
Draw us, O God, with sovereign grace,
And lift our thoughts on high,
That we may end this mortal race,
And see salvation nigh.
HYMN XXXVII. Breathing after the holy Spirit.
1
COME, holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With all thy quickening powers,
Kindle a flame of sacred love
In these cold hearts of ours.
2
Behold us grovelling here below,
Engaged in trifling toys!
Our souls can neither fly, nor go,
To reach eternal joys.
3
In vain we tune our formal songs,
In vain, we strive to rise;
Hosannah's languish on our tongues,
And our devotion dies.
4
Dear Lord! and shall we still remain
In this declining state?
Our love so faint, so cold to thee,
And thine to us so great?
5
Come, holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With all thy quickening powers;
Come, shed abroad a Savior's love,
And that shall kindle ours.
HYMN XXXVIII. Christ's Intercession.
1
THE great Redeemer's gone
To stand before our God,
To sprinkle over the flaming throne
With his attoning blood.
2
No firey vengeance now,
No burning wrath comes down:
If justice calls for sinners' blood,
The Savior shows his own.
3
Before his Father's eye
Our humble suit he moves;
The Father lays his thunder by,
And looks, and smiles, and loves,
4
Now may our joyful tongues
Our Maker's honor sing:
Jesus, the priest, receives our songs,
And bears them to the king.
5
"On earth thy mercy reigns,
"And triumphs all above;
"But, Lord, how weak our mortal strains
"To speak immortal love!
HYMN XXXIX. Hell; or, Vengeance of God. --
1
WITH holy fear, and humble song,
The dreadful God our souls adore;
Reverence and awe become the tongue
Which speaks the terrors of his power.
2
Far, in the deep, where darkness dwells,
The land of horror and despair,
Justice has built a dismal hell,
And laid her stores of vengeance there.
3
There satan the first sinner, lies;
And roars, and bites his iron bands;
In vain the rebel strives to rise,
Crushed with the weight of heavenly hands.
4
There guilty ghosts, of Adam's race,
Shriek out, and howl beneath thy rod;
Once they could scorn a Savior's grace,
And so incensed a dreadful God.
5
Tremble, my soul, and kiss the Son --
Sinner, obey thy Savior's call;
Else your damnation hastens on,
And opening hell awaits your fall.
HYMN XL. Love to the Creatures is dangerous.
1
HOW vain are all things here below!
How false, and yet how fair!
Each pleasure has its poison too,
And every sweet -- a snare.
2
The brightest things below the sky
Give but a flattering light;
We should suspect some danger nigh,
Where we possess delight.
3
Our dearest joys, and nearest friends,
The partners of our blood,
How they divide our wavering minds,
And leave but half for God!
4
The fondness of a creature's love,
Allures the flattering sense!
Thither the warm affections move,
Nor can we call them thence.
5
Dea^ Savior, let thy beauties be
My soul's eternal food;
And grace command my heart away
From all created good.
HYMN XLI. Shortness of Life, and goodness of God.
1
TIME, what an empty vapor it is!
And days, how swift they are!
Swift as a feathered arrow flies,
Or like a shooting star.
2
Our life is ever on the wing,
And death is ever nigh;
The moment when our lives begin,
We all begin to die.
3
Yet mighty GOD! our fleeting days
Thy lasting favors share;
And still the bounties of thy grace,
Enrich the rolling year.
4
It Is sovereign mercy finds us food,
And we are clothed by love:
While grace stands pointing out the road,
That leads our souls above.
5
Thus we began the lasting song;
And when we close our eyes,
Let ages down thy praise prolong,
'Till time and nature dies.
HYMN XLII. God the Thunderer: -- Or, the last Judgment, and Hell. Made in a
great S^rm of Thunder, August 20th, 1697

1
SING to the Lord ye heavenly hosts,
And let the earth, adore:
Let death and hell, through all their coasts,
Stand trembling at his power.
2
His sounding chariot shakes the sky,
He makes the cloud his throne;
There all his stores of lightning lie.
'Till vengeance darts them down.
3
Before him rolls a fiery stream --
And from his awful tongue
A sovereign voice divides the flame,
And thunder roars along!
4
Think, O my soul the dreadful day
When this incensed GOD
Shall rend the sky, and burn the sea,
And send his wrath abroad!
5
What shall the wretch, the sinner do?
He once defied the Lord:
But he shall dread the thunderer now,
And sink beneath his word.
6
Tempests of angry fire shall roll
To blast the rebel worm;
And beat upon his naked soul
In one eternal storm.
HYMN XLIII. A Funeral Thought.
1
HARK, from the tombs, a doleful sound,
Mine ears attend the cry --
"Ye living men, come, view the ground
"Where you must shortly lie.
2
"Princes, this clay must be your bed,
"In spite of all your towers;
"The tall, the wise, the reverend nead
"Must lie as low as our's.
3
Great God, is this our certain doom?
And are we still secure!
Still walking downwards to the tomb,
And yet prepared no more!
4
Grant us the powers of quickening grace,
To sit our souls to fly;
Then, when we drop this dying flesh,
We'll rise above the sky.
HYMN XLIV. The Lord's Day; or, The Resurrection of Christ.
1
BLESSED morning, whose young dawning rays
Beheld our rising God;
Which saw him triumph over the dust,
And leave his dark abode!
2
In the cold prison of a tomb
The dear Redeemer lay;
'Till the revolving skies had brought
The third, the appointed day.
3
Hell, and the grave, unite their force
To hold our God in vain;
The sleeping Conqueror arose,
And burst their feeble chain.
4
To thy great name, almighty Lord,
These sacred hours we pay;
And loud Hosannas shall proclaim
The triumph of the day.
HYMN XLV. The Christian Warfare,
^
STAND up, my soul, shake off thy fears,
And gird the gospel-armour on;
March to the gates of endless joy,
Where Jesus went and claimed his throne.
^
Hell, and thy sins resist thy course;
But hell and sin are vanquished foes;
Thy Jesus nailed them to the cross,
And sung the triumph when he rose.
3
Then let my soul march boldly on,
Press forward to the heavenly gate;
There peace and joy eternal reign,
And glittering robes for conquerors wait.
4
There shall I wear a starry crown,
And triumph in almighty grace;
While all the armies of the skies
Join in my glorious Leader's praise.
HYMN XLVI. Salvation.
1
SALVATION! Oh, the joyful sound!
It Is pleasure to our ears;
A sovereign balm for every wound,
A cordial for our fears.
2
Buried in sorrow, and in sin,
At hell's dark door we lay;
But we arise, by grace divine,
To see a heavenly day.
3
Salvation! let the echo fly
The spacious earth around,
While all the armies of the sky
Conspire to raise the sound.
HYMN XLVII. Look on him whom they pierced, and mourn.
1
INFINITE grief! amazing woe!
Behold my bleeding Lord!
Hell and the Jews conspire his death,
And use the Roman sword.
2
Oh! the sharp pangs of smarting pain
My dear Redeemer bore,
When knotty whips, and ragged thorns,
His sacred body tore!
3
But knotty whips, and ragged thorns,
In vain do I accuse;
In vain I blame the Roman bands,
And more insulting Jews:
4
'Twere you, my sins, my cruel sins,
His chief tormentors were;
Each of my crimes became a nail;
And unbelief -- the spear.
5
'Twere you that pulled the vengeance down
Upon his guiltless head:
Break, break, my heart -- Oh, burst mine eyes,
And let my sorrows bleed!
6
Strike, mighty grace, my flinty soul,
Till melting waters flow;
And deep repentance drown mine eyes
In undissembled woe!
HYMN XLVIII. The Book of God's Decrees.
1
LET all the race of creatures lie
Abas'd before their God:
Whatever his sovereign voice has formed
He governs with a nod.
2
Ten thousand ages ere the skies
Were into motion brought;
All the long years and worlds to come
Stood present to his thought.
3
If light attend the course I run,
It Is he provides the rays;
And it is his hand which hides my sun,
If darkness cloud my days.
4
Yet I would not too far enquire,
Nor vainly long to see
In volumes of his deep decrees,
What lines are marked for me.
5
When he reveals the book of life,
Oh, may I read my name
Among the chosen of his love,
The followers of the Lamb.
HYMN XLIX. The World's Three chief Temptations.
1
WHEN, in the light of faith divine,
We look on things below,
Honor, and gold, and sensual joy,
How vain and dangerous too.
2
Honor's a puff of noisy breath;
Yet men expose their blood,
And venture everlasting death,
To gain that airy good.
3
Whilst others starve the nobler mind,
And seed on shining dust;
They rob the serpent of his food,
TO indulge a sordid lust.
4
The pleasures which allure the sense,
Are dangerous snares to souls;
There Is but a drop of flattering sweet,
And dashed with bitter bowls.
5
God is mine all-sufficient good,
My portion, and my choice;
In him my vast desires are filled,
And all my powers rejoice.
6
In vain the world accosts my ear,
And tempts my heart anew;
I cannot buy your bliss so dear,
Nor part with heaven for you.
HYMN L. Christ's Commission, John iii.16, 17.
1
COME, happy souls, approach your God,
With new melodious songs;
Come, tender to almighty grace
The tribute of your tongues.
2
So strange, so boundless was the love
Which pitied dying men,
The Father sent his equal Son
To give them life again.
3
Thy hands, my Savior, were not armed
With a revenging rod;
Nor had commission to perform
The vengeance of a God.
4
But all was mercy -- all was love
And wrath forsook the throne;
When Christ descended from above,
And brought salvation down.
HYMN LI. God glorified in the Gospel.
1
THE Lord, descending from above,
Invites his children near;
While power and truth, and boundless love
Display their glories here.
2
Here in the gospel's wondrous frame,
Fresh wisdom we may view;
A thousand angels learn thy name,
Beyond whatever they knew.
3
Thy name is writ in fairest lines,
Thy wonders here we trace;
Wisdom through all the mystery shines,
It shines in Jesus' face.
4
The law its best obedience owes
To our incarnate God;
And thy revenging justice shows
Its honors in his blood.
5
But still the luster of thy grace
Our warmer thoughts employs;
Gilds the whole scene with brighter rays,
And more exalts our joys.
HYMN LII. Circumcision and Baptism. (Written only for those who practice the
Baptism of Infants.)
1
ONCE did the sons of Abra'm pass
Beneath the bloody seal of grace;
The young disciples bore the yoke,
'Till Christ the painful bondage broke,
2
By milder ways does Jesus prove
His Father's covenant, and his love;
He seals, to saints his glorious grace,
And kindly owns their infant race.
3
Their seed is sprinkled with his blood,
Their children set apart for God;
His spirit on their offspring's shed,
Like water poured upon the head.
4
Let every saint, with cheerful voice,
In this large covenant rejoice;
Young children, in their early days,
Shall give the God of Abra'm praise.
HYMN LIII. The Example of Christ.
1
MY dear Redeemer, and my Lord,
I read my duty in thy word:
But in thy life thy law is best
In living characters expressed.
2
Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal. --
Such deference to thy Father's will --
Such love, and meekness, so divine,
I would transcribe, and make them mine.
3
Cold mountains, and the midnight air,
Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer;
The desert thy temptations knew,
Thy conflict, and thy victory too.
4
Be thou my pattern -- make me bear
More of thy gracious image here:
Then God the Judge, shall own my name
Among the followers of the Lamb.
HYMN LIVE. The Deceitfulness of Sin.
1
SIN has a thousand treacherous arts
To practice on the mind;
With flattering looks she tempts our hearts,
But leaves a sting behind.
^
With names of virtues she deceives
The aged and the young;
And, while the heedless wretch believes,
She makes his fetters strong.
^
She pleads for all the joys she brings,
And gives a fair pretense;
But cheats the soul of heavenly things,
And chains it down to sense.
^
So, on a tree divinely fair,
Grew the forbidden food;
Our mother took the poison there,
And tainted all her blood.
HYMN LV. Christian Virtues.
^
STRAIT is the way, the door is strait,
Which leads to joys on high;
It Is but a few who find the gate,
While crowds mistake, and die,
^
Beloved self must be denied,
The mind and will renewed,
Passion suppressed, and patience tried,
And vain desires subdued.
^
The love of gold be banished hence,
(That vile idolatry)
And every member, every sense
In sweet subjection lie.
4
The tongue, that most unruly power,
Requires a strong restraint:
We must be watchful every hour,
And pray, but never faint.
5
Lord! can a feeble helpless worm
Fulfill a task so hard?
Thy grace must all my work perform,
And give the free reward.
HYMN LVI. Communion with Christ and with Saints. 1 Cor. x.16, 17.
1
JESUS invites his saints
To meet around his board;
Here pardoned rebels sit and hold
Communion with their Lord.
2
For food he gives his flesh;
He bids us drink his blood:
Amazing favor! matchless grace,
Of our descending God!
3
This holy bread and wine,
Maintain our fainting breath,
By union with our living Lord,
And interest in his death.
4
Our heavenly Father calls
Christ and his members one;
We the young children of his love,
And he the firstborn Son.
5
Let all our powers be joined
His glorious name to raise:
Pleasure and love fill every mind,
And every voice be praise
HYMN LVII. The Memorial of our absent Lord, John xvi.^^ Luke xxii.19. John
xiv.3.
1
THE Lord ascends above the skies,
Where our weak senses reach him not;
And carnal objects court our eyes,
To thrust the Savior from our thought.
2
He knows what wandering hearts we have,
That lose the memory of his face;
And, to refresh our minds, he gave
These kind memorials of his grace.
3
The Lord of life this table spread
With his own flesh and dying blood,
We on the rich provision feed,
And taste the wine, and bless our God.
4
Let sinful sweets be all forgot,
And earth grow less in our esteem;
Christ and his love fill every thought,
And says and hope be fixed on him.
5
Whilst he is absent from our sight,
It Is to prepare our souls a place;
That we may live in heavenly light*
And dwell forever near his face.
HYMN LVIII. Christ Crucified; the Wisdom and Power of God.
1
NATURE with open volume stands,
To spread her Maker's praise abroad;
And every labor of his hands
Displays the wisdom of a God:
2
But in the grace which rescued man,
His brightest form of glory shines;
Here, on the cross, it is fairest drawn
In precious blood, and crimson lines.
3
Here I behold his in most heart,
Where grace and vengeance strangely join;
Piercing his Son with sharpest smart,
To make the purchased pleasures mine.
4
Oh! the sweet wonders of that cross,
Where God, the Savior, loved and died!
Her noblest life my spirit draws
From his dear wounds, and bleeding side.
5
I would forever speak his name
In sounds to mortal ears unknown,
With angels join to praise the Lamb,
And worship at his Father's throne.
HYMN LIX. The Gospel Feast. Luke xiv.16, etc. --
1
HOW rich are thy provisions, Lord!
Thy table furnished from above!
The fruits of life overspread the board,
The cup overflows with heavenly love.
2
Thine ancient family, the jews,
Were first invited to the feast:
We humbly take what they refuse,
And Gentiles thy salvation taste.
3
We are the poor, the blind, the lame;
And help was far, and death was nigh!
But at the gospel call, we came,
And every want received supply.
4
From the high way which leads to hell,
From paths of darkness and despair,
Lord, we are come with thee to dwell,
And feel thy gladsome presence here.
5
Our everlasting love shall flow,
To him who left his blessed abode,
And sought these darksome realms below,
To bring us wanderers back to GOD.
HYMN LX. Our Lord Jesus at his own table.
1
THE memory of our dying Lord
Awakes a thankful tongue:
How rich he spread his royal board,
And blessed the food, and sung.
2
Happy the men who eat this bread,
But doubly-bless'd was he
Who gently bowed his loving head,
And leaned it, Lord, on thee.
3
By faith the same delights we taste
As that great favorite did,
And sit and lean on Jesus' breast,
And take the sacred bread.
4
Down from the palace of the skies;
The King of grace descends!
"Come my beloved, eat (he cries)
"And drink salvation friends.
5
Hosannah to his bounteous love,
For such a feast below!
And yet he feeds his saints above
With nobler blessings too.
6
Come the dear day, the glorious hour,
That brings our souls to GOD,
Then we shall need these types no more,
But taste the heavenly food.
HYMN LXI. Grace and Glory by the Death of Christ.
1
WHILE sitting round our father's board,
We raise our tuneful breath;
Our faith beholds our dying Lord,
And dooms our sins to death.
2
We see the blood of Jesus shed,
Whence all our pardons rise;
The sinner views the atonement made,
And loves the sacrifice.
3
Thy cruel thorns, thy shameful cross;
Procure us heavenly crowns:
Our gain arises from thy loss;
Our healing, from thy wounds.
4
Not all the race of mortals here,
Who dwell in feeble clay,
For thee can equal sufferings bear
Or equal thanks repay.
HYMN LXII. Divine Glories and Graces.
1
HOW fair thy glories here displayed,
Great God, how bright they shine;
While at thy word we break the bread,
And pour the flowing wine!
2
Here thy revenging justice stands,
And pleads its dreadful cause;
Here saving mercy spreads her hands,
Like Jesus on the cross.
3
Thy saints attend with every grace
On this great sacrifice;
And love appears with cheerful face*
And faith with lifted eyes.
4
Our cheerful hope that waiting sits,
To heaven directs her sight;
Here every warmer passion meets*
And stronger powers unite.
5
Zeal and revenge perform their part,
And rising sin destroy;
Repentance comes with aching heart,
Yet never forbids the joy.
6
Dear Savior, change our faith to sight,
Let sin forever die;
Then shall our souls be all delight,
And every tear be dry.
HYMN LXIII. Our Savior present at his Table.
1
COME let us join the sacred song
To our ascended Lord;
Ye saints and angels round his throne,
And we around his board.
2
Though raised beyond the worlds of light,
His brighter glories shine,
Where purer souls enjoy the light
And presence more divine.
3
Yet here, unseen by mortal eyes,
The ^oundless God resides,
Renews the atoning sacrifice
And over the feast presides.
4
Let every hand that shares the food
And every heart with fear,
Feel the full presence of the God,
That spreads his bounties here.
5
But Oh, the love, the wondrous love
The bleeding Lord displays,
Shall earth's united songs improve,
And heaven's eternal praise.
HYMN LXIV. Invitation to the gospel-feast.
1
THE King of heaven his table spreads,
And dainties crown the board;
Not paradise with all its joys
Could such delight afford.
2
Lo, in the blood that Jesus shed,
To raise the soul to heaven,
Pardon and peace to dying men,
And endless life is given.
3
Ye hungry poor, that long have strayed
In sins dark mazes, come;
Come from the hedges and highways,
And grace shall find you room.
4
Millions of souls* in glory now,
Were fed and feasted here,
And millions more, still on the way,
Around the board appear.
5
All things are ready, come away,
Nor weak excuses frame;
Assume your places at the feast,
And bless the founder's name.
HYMN LXV. Innumerable mercies acknowledged.
1
IN glad amazement, Lord, I stand,
Amidst the bounties of thy hand;
How numberless those bounties are!
How rich, how various and how fair!
2
But oh, what poor returns I bring!
What lifeless songs of praise I sing!
Lord, I confess, with humble shame,
My offerings scarce deserve the name.
3
^ain would my laboring; heart devise
Some nobler gift and sacrifice;
It sinks beneath the mighty load
That I should render to my God.
4
To him I consecrate my praise,
And vow the remnant of my days;
Enlarge my soul with grace divine,
And make it worthier to be thine.
5
Give me at length an angel's tongue,
To sound through heaven the grateful song;
A theme so great, my voice shall raise,
And crown eternity with praise.
HYMN LXVI. For a vacant Congregation.
1
O GOD of heaven, whose gentle ray,
Illumes the worlds of light,
Thy wisdom rules the realms of day,
And leads the host of night.
2
Behold thy waiting servants stand,
And claim with feeble cries.
Some skilful guide with gentle hand
To lead us to the skies.
3
While absent from thy temple, Lord
Like wandering flocks we stray
We lose the memory of thy word
And waste the sacred day.
4
And when, within these walls of thine
We find our wonted place:
How faint our feeble voices join
To seek thy pardoning grace.
5
Almighty Savior, hear our prayer,
Some chosen servant raise.
For us the bread of life to share
And help our lips to praise.
6
Then in thy house, with joy unknown
We'll raise a nobler song,
Till we shall meet around thy throne,
And join the heavenly throng.
HYMN LXVII. For a New Year's Day.
1
ETERNAL Source of every joy,
Thy praise shall every voice employ,
While we within thy courts appear,
And sing the bounties of the year.
2
As worlds of glory round thee roll,
Thy hand supports the steadfast pole,
Directs the sun what hour to rise,
And darkness when to veil the skies.
3
The flowery Spring at thy command
Embalms the air, and paints the land;
The blazing beams of Summer shine
To raise the corn and cheer the vine.
4
Thy hand in Autumn richly pours
The copious fruits along the shores,
While wintry storms direct our eyes
With fear and wonder to the skies.
5
Seasons, and months, and weeks, and days
Demand returning songs of praise;
The opening light and evening shade
Shall see the cheerful homage paid.
6
And Oh, may our harmonious tongues
In worlds unknown pursue the songs;
And in those brighter courts adore,
Where days and years revolve no more.
HYMN LXVIII A Hymn for Marriage.
1
GREAT God, who formed for social joys
Our natures by thy power and grace,
And joined in blessed connubial ties,
The parents of our favored race.
2
Our Savior, our ascended Lord,
In Cana once a heavenly guest,
Whose bounty cheered the friendly board
Whose presence graced the nuptial feast.
3
Attend with smiles of heavenly love,
The pair thy sacred laws combine;
Their union bless, their vows approve,
And crown the rites with grace divine.
4
Let love assist their mutual toils,
And every social bliss bestow;
Increase each joy with friendly smiles,
And share and soften every woe.
5
While each a kindly aid imparts,
To run secure the heavenly race;
And make their dwelling and their hearts,
Perpetual temples of thy praise.
6
When death dissolves these sacred ties,
May each to happier realms remove;
There meet and range the peaceful skies,
In bands of everlasting love.
HYMN LXIX. Christ's Ascension.
1
HAIL the day that sees him rise,
Ravished from our wishful eyes;
Christ awhile to mortals given,
Re-ascends his native heaven;
There the pompous triumph waits,
Lift your heads, eternal gates;
Wide unfold the radiant scene,
Take the King of glory in.
2
Him though highest heaven receives,
Still he loves the earth he leaves;
Though returning to his throne,
Still he calls mankind his own;
Still for us he intercedes,
Prevalent his death he pleads,
Next himself prepares a place,
Harbinger of human race.
3
Master, may we ever say,
Taken from our world away,
See thy faithful servants, see,
Ever gazing up to thee;
Grant, though parted from our sight,
High above you azure height,
Grant our souls may thither rise,
Following thee beyond the skies.
4
Ever upward let us move,
Wafted on the wings of love;
Looking when our Lord shall come,
Longing for a happier home;
There we shall with thee remain,
Partners of thine endless reign;
There thy face unclouded see,
Find a heaven of heavens in thee.
HYMN LXX. The Pilgrim's Song.
1
RISE, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
Thy better portion trace;
Rise from transitory things,
Toward heaven thy native place:
Sun, and moon, and stars, decay,
Time shall soon this earth remove;
Rise, my soul, and haste away
To seats prepared above.
2
Rivers to the ocean run,
Nor stay in all their course,
Fires ascending seek the sun,
Both speed them to their source;
So a soul, that is born of God,
Pants to view his glorious face;
Upward tends to his abode,
To rest in his embrace.
3
Fly me, riches; fly me, cares,
While I that coast explore,
Flattering world, with all thy snares,
Solicit me no more:
Pilgrims fix not here their home,
Strangers tarry but a night,
When the last dear morn is come,
They Will rise to joyful light.
4
Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn,
Press onward to the prize;
Soon the Savior will return,
Triumphant in the skies:
Yet a season, and you know
Happy entrance will be given,
All our sorrows left below,
And earth exchanged for heaven.
End of the HYMNS.
ANTHEM, FROM JOB, VII.
^S there not an appointed time to man upon earth? (...) Are not his days also
as the days of an hireling? (...) made to possess months of vanity, and
wearisome ^^ghts are appointed to me. When I lie down, I (...), When shall I
arise, and the night be gone? (...) full of tossings to and fro, unto the
dawning of (...) day. My flesh is clothed with worms, and clods (...) dust; my
skin is broken, and become loathsome, ^loath it, I would not live always: let
me alone, for (...) days are vanity. My days are swifter than a ^^aver's
shuttle, and are spent without hope. O ^^member that my life is wind! mine eye
shall no ^^ore see good. As the cloud is consumed, and va^^sheth away; so he
who goes down to the grave, ^^all come up no more: for now shall I sleep in
the ^^^st, and thou shall seek me in the morning, but I ^^all not be.

ANTHEM. FROM SUNDRY SCRIPTURES.
ARISE, shine, O Zion, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is
risen upon thee: And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and Kings ^o the
brightness of thy rising. Sing, sing. O Heavens, and be joyful, O earth, for
behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ
the Lord. Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and his name shall be
called Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the everlasting Father, the
Prince of Peace. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.

ANTHEM. FROM PSALM CXXIV.
IF the Lord himself had not been on our side -- now may Israel say; if the
Lord himself had not been on our side, when men rose up against us; they had
swallowed us up quick; yea, the waters had drowned us; and the stream had gone
over our soul. Bu^ praised be the Lord, our soul is escaped, even as (...) bird
out of the snare of the fowler; the snare (...) broken, and we are delivered.
Our help standet^ in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

ANTHEM. FROM LUKE II.
BEHOLD I bring you glad tidings of joy, which shall be to all people. For unto
you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
And this shall be a sign unto you. You shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling
clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude
of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and
on earth peace, good will toward men. Hallelujah!

THE END.
