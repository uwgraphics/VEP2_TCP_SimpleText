MASONS SONGS.
I. The Master 's Song, by Dr. ANDERSON.
1.
WE sing of Masons ancient fame!
Lo, eighty thousand craftsmen rise
Under the Masters of great name,
More than three thousand just and wise.
Employed by SOLOMON, the Sire,
And general Master Mason too,
As HIRAM was in stately Tire,
Like Salem built by Masons true.
2.
The Royal art was then divine,
The craftsmen counseled from above,
The temple was the grand design,
The wondering world did all approve.
Ingenious men from every place
Came to survey the glorious pile;
And when returned, began to trace
And imitate its lofty style.
3.
At length the Grecians came to know
Geometry, and learned the art
Pythagoras was raised to show,
And glorious Euclid to impart:
Great Archimedes too appeared,
And Carthagenian Masters bright;
Till Roman citizens uprear'd
The art, with wisdom and delight.
4.
But when proud Asia they had quelled,
And Greece and Egypt overcome,
In architecture they excelled,
And brought the learning all to Rome:
Where wise Vitruvius, Warden prime
Of architects, the art improved,
In great Augustus' peaceful time,
When arts and artists were beloved.
5.
They brought the knowledge from the east,
And as they made the nations yield,
They spread it through the north and west,
And taught the world the art to build.
Witness their citadels and towers,
To fortify their legions fine,
Their temples, palaces and bowers,
That spoke the Masons grand design.
6.
Thus mighty eastern Kings, and some
Of Abraham's race, and Monarchs good
Of Egypt, Syria, Greece, and Rome,
True architecture understood.
No wonder then if Masons join
To celebrate those Mason-Kings,
With solemn note, and flowing wine,
Whilst every Brother jointly sings.
CHORUS.
Who can unfold the Royal art,
Or show its secrets in a song?
They Are safely kept in Mason's heart,
And to the ancient Lodge belong!
II. The Warden's Song, by the same Author
FROM henceforth ever sing
Famed SOLOMON, the King;
With poetry and music sweet,
Resound the harmony complete;
And with geometry in skilful hand,
Due homage pay,
Without delay,
To noble BEAUFORT, now our Master Grand*
He rules the freeborn sons of art,
By love and friendship, hand and heart.
Chorus of the Warden's Song.
Who can rehearse the praise,
In soft poetic lays,
Or solid prose, of Masons true,
Whose art transcends the common view?
Their secrets never to strangers yet exposed,
Preserved shall be,
By Masons Free,
And only to the ancient Lodge disclosed;
Because they are kept in Mason's heart,
By Brethren of the Royal art.
To the Grand Master.
III. The FELLOW CRAFT's Song
1.
HAIL Masonry! thou craft divine!
Glory of earth! from heaven revealed!
Which does with jewels precious shine,
From all but Masons eyes concealed.
CHORUS.
Thy praises due who can rehearse,
In nervous prose, or flowing verse?
2.
From scorching heat and piercing cold,
From beasts whose roar the forest rends;
From the assaults of warriors bold,
The Mason's art mankind defends.
CHORUS.
Be to this art due honor paid,
From which mankind receives such aid.
3.
Ensigns of state, that feed our pride,
Distinctions troublesome and vain,
By Masons true are laid aside,
Art's freeborn sons such toys disdain.
CHORUS.
Ennobled by the name they bear,
Distinguished by the badge they wear.
4.
Sweet fellowship from envy free,
Social converse of wise and good,
The Lodge's lasting cement be,
Which has for ages firmly stood.
CHORUS.
A Lodge thus built, for ages past
Has lasted, and shall ever last.
5.
Then in our songs be justice done
To those who have enriched the art;
From ADAM to great BEAUFORT down,
And let each Brother bear a part.
CHORUS.
Let noble Masons healths go round,
Their praise in lofty Lodge resound.
IV. The Entered 'PRENTICE's Song.
By Brother Matthew Birkhead, deceased.
To be sung after grave Business is over.

COME let us prepare,
We Brothers that are
Assembled on merry occasion;
Let Us drink, laugh and sing,
Our wine has a spring,
Here Is a health to an Accepted Mason.
All charged.
The world is in pain
Our secrets to gain,
And still let them wonder and gaze on;
Till they are brought to light,
They Will never know the right
Word or sign of an Accepted Mason.
It Is this, and it is that,
They cannot tell what,
Why so many great men of the nation
Should aprons put on,
To make themselves one
With a Free and an Accepted Mason.
Antiquity's pride
We have on our side,
Which makes men just in their station:
There Is naught but what is good
To be understood
By a Free and an Accepted Mason.
Great Kings, Dukes and Lords,
Have laid by their swords,
Our Mystery to put a good grace on;
And never been ashamed
To hear themselves named
With a Free and an Accepted Mason.
Still firm to our trust,
In friendship we are just,
Our actions we guide by our reason:
By observing this rule,
The passions move cool
Of a Free and an Accepted Mason.
All idle debate
About church or state,
The springs of impiety and treason,
Those raisers of strife
Never ruffle the life
Of a Free and an Accepted Mason.
We Are true and sincere,
And just to the fair,
They Will trust us on any occasion.
No mortal can more
The ladies adore
Than a Free and an Accepted Mason.
Then join hand in hand,
By each Brother firm stand,
Let Us be merry, and put a bright face on;
What mortal can boast
So noble a toast
As a Free and an Accepted Mason?
CHORUS.
No mortal can boast
So noble a toast
As a Free and an Accepted Mason,
V. The Deputy GRAND MASTER'S Song.
N. B. Every two last lines of each verse is the chorus.
1.
ON, on, my dear Brethren, pursue your great lecture,
And refine on the rules of old architecture:
High honor to Masons the Craft daily brings,
To those Brothers of Princes, and fellows of Kings.
2.
We drove the rude Vandals and Goths off the stage,
Reviving the arts of AGUSTUS' famed age*
And Vespasian destroyed the vast temple in vain,
Since so many now rise in great ATHOL's mild reign,
3.
The noble five orders, composed with such art,
Will amaze the fixed eye, and engage the whole heart;
Proportion's sweet harmony gracing the whole,
Gives our work, like the glorious creation, a soul.
4.
Then, Master and Brethren, preserve your great name,
This Lodge so majestic will purchase you same;
Revered it shall stand till all nature expire,
And its glories never fade till the world is on fire.
5.
See, see, behold here, what rewards all our toil,
Inspires our genius, and bids labor smile:
To our noble Grand Master let a bumper be crowned,
To all Masons a bumper, so let it go round.
6.
Again, my loved Brethren, again let it pass,
Our ancient firm union cements with the glass;
And all the contention amongst Masons shall be,
Who better can work, or who better agree.
VI. The TREASURER's Song
N. B. The two last lines of each verse is the chorus.
GRANT me, kind heaven, what I request,
In Masonry let me be blessed;
Direct me to that happy place,
Where friendship smiles in every face,
Where freedom and sweet innocence
Enlarge the mind, and cheer the sense.
Where sceptered reason, from her throne,
Surveys the Lodge, and make us one;
And harmony's delightful sway
For ever sheds ambrosial day;
Where we blessed Eden's pleasures taste,
Whilst balmy joys are our repast.
No prying eye can view us here,
No fool or knave disturb our cheer:
Our well-form'd laws set mankind free,
And give relief to misery;
The poor, oppressed with woe and grief,
Gain from our bounteous hands relief.
Our Lodge the social virtues grace,
And wisdom's rules we fondly trace:
Whole nature, open to our view,
Points out the paths we should pursue.
Let us subsist in lasting peace,
And may our happiness increase.
SONG VII.
N. B. The two last lines of each verse is the chorus.
BY Masons art the aspiring domes
In stately columns shall arise:
All climates are their native homes,
Their learned actions reach the skies,
Heroes and Kings revere their name,
While poets sing their lasting fame.
Great, Noble, Generous, Good and Brave,
Are titles they most justly claim;
Their deeds shall live beyond the grave,
Which those unborn shall loud proclaim.
Time shall their glorious acts enrol,
While love and friendship charm the soul.
To the lasting honor of Free-Masons.
SONG VIII.
A MASON's daughter fair and young,
The pride of all the virgin throng,
Thus to her lover said;
Though, Damon, I your flame approve,
Your actions praise, your person love,
Yet still I Will live a maid.
None shall untie my virgin zone,
But one to whom the secret's known
Of famed Free-Masonry;
In which the great and good combine
To raise, with generous design,
Man to felicity.
The Lodge excludes the fop and fool,
The plodding knave, and party tool,
That liberty would sell;
The noble, faithful, and the brave,
No golden charms can ever deceive,
In slavery to dwell.
This said, he bowed, and went his way;
Applied, was made without delay,
Returned to her again:
The fair one granted his request,
Connubial joys their days have blessed,
And may they ever remain.
SONG IX.
ONCE I was blind, and could not see,
And all was dark me round,
But Providence provided me,
And soon a friend I found;
Through hidden paths my friend me led,
Such paths as babblers never shall tread.
With a Fa, la, la, la, la, la.
He took all stumbling blocks away,
That I might walk secure,
And brought me long ere break of day
To Sol's bright temple door,
Where we both admittance found,
By help of magic spell and sound.
With a Fa, la, etc.
The curber of my rash attempt
Did then my breast alarm,
And hinted I was not exempt,
Nor free from double harm;
Which put a stop to rising pride,
And made me trust more to my guide.
With a Fa, la, etc.
With sober pace I then was led,
And brought to Sol's bright throne;
Where I was obliged to stop,
Till I myself made known;
With hideous noise I round was brought,
For to obtain that which I sought.
With a Fa, la, etc.
In humble posture, and due form,
I list'ned with good will;
Instead of mighty noise and storm,
All then was calm and still.
Such charming sounds I then did hear,
As quite dispelled all doubts and fear.
With a Fa, la, etc.
The guardian of this mystic charm,
In shining jewels dressed,
Said, that I need to fear no harm,
If faithful was my breast;
For though to rogues he was severe,
No harm an honest man need fear.
With a Fa, la, etc.
Bright wisdom, from his awful throne,
Bid darkness to withdraw;
No sooner said but it was done,
And then -- great things I saw;
But what they were -- I now will not tell,
They safely in my breast shall dwell.
With a Fa, la, etc.
Then round and round me he did tie
An ancient noble charm,
Which future darkness will defy,
And ward off cowans harm;
With instruments in number three,
To learn the art GEOMETRY.
With a Fa, la, la, la, la.
SONG X.
ASSEMBLED and tyl'd, let us social agree
With the Mason that sits on a throne,
For he charges a glass, and round let it pass,
To celebrate ancient St. John.
Though babblers may prattle in showing their spleen,
Their spite we compare to the drone,
For in sweet harmony in love we'll agree,
To celebrate ancient St. John.
The world is in pain our secrets to gain,
In ignorance let them think on,
For in sweet harmony in love we'll agree,
To celebrate ancient St. John.
With toast after toast let us drink, laugh and sing,
Rememb'ring the great WASHINGTON,
For his actions are rare, by the compass and square,
Thus celebrate ancient St. John.
Then join hand in hand, in a body firm stand,
Our cares and our troubles be gone,
Let us love, laugh and sing, and WASHINGTON bring,
To celebrate ancient St. John.
SONG XI.
A MASON one time
Was cast for a crime,
Which malice had put a bad face on,
And then, without thought,
To a gibbet was brought
The Free and the Accepted Mason.
And then without thought, etc.
And when he came there,
He put up his prayer
For heaven to pity his case on!
His King he espied,
Who in progress did ride,
Was a Free and an Accepted Mason.
His King he espied, etc.
Then out a sign flew,
Which the Grand Master knew,
Who rode up to know the occasion,
Asked who had condemned
So worthy a friend
As a Free and an Accepted Mason.
Asked who had condemned, etc.
He tried the cause,
And found out the flaws,
According to justice and reason:
He tucked up the judge,
And all that bore grudge
To the Free and the Accepted Mason.
He tucked up the judge, etc.
Though ignorant pride
Our secrets deride,
Or foolish conjectures occasion,
They never shall divine
The word or the sign
Of a Free and an Accepted Mason.
They never shall divine, etc.
May honor and honesty ever distinguish the Brethren.
XII. The SWORD-BEARER's Song
N. B. The two last lines of each verse is the chorus
TO all who Masonry despise,
This counsel I bestow:
Don't ridicule, if you are wise,
A secret you don't know.
Yourselves you banter, but not it,
You show your spleen, but not your wit.
With a Fa, la, la, la.
Inspiring virtue by our rules,
And in ourselves secure,
We have compassion for those fools,
Who think our acts impure:
We know from ignorance proceeds
Such mean opinion of our deeds.
With a Fa, la, etc.
If union and sincerity
Have a pretense to please,
We Brothers of Freemasonry
Lay a just claim to these.
To state-disputes we never give birth,
Our motto friendship is, and mirth.
With a Fa, la, etc.
Then let us laugh, since we have imposed
On those who make a pother,
And cry the secret is disclosed
By some false-hearted Brother:
The mighty secret's gained, they boast,
From post-boy and from flying-post.
With a Fa, la, la, la.
To all Masters and Wardens of regular Lodges.
SONG XIII.
YE thrice happy few,
Whose hearts have been true,
In concord and unity sound;
Let us sing and rejoice,
And unite every voice,
To send the gay chorus around.
CHORUS.
Like pillars we stand,
An immovable band,
Cemented by power from above;
Then freely let pass the generous glass
To Masonry, friendship and love.
The Grand Architect,
Whose word did erect
Eternity, measure, and space,
First laid the fair plan
Whereon we began,
The cement of friendship and peace.
Chor. Like pillars we stand, etc.
Whose firmness of hearts
Fair treasure of arts,
To the eye of the vulgar unknown;
Whose luster can beam
New dignity and fame
To the pulpit, the bar and the throne.
Chor. Like pillars we stand, etc.
The great David's son,
Unmatched SOLOMON,
As recorded in sacred page,
Through Masonry became
The first favorite of fame,
The wonder and pride of his age.
Chor. Like pillars we stand, etc.
Indissoluble bands
Our hearts and our hands
In social benevolence bind;
For true to his cause,
By immutable laws,
A Mason's a friend to mankind.
Chor. Like pillars we stand, etc.
Let joy fly around,
And peace, olive-bound,
Preside at our mystical rites:
Whose conduct maintains
Our auspicious domains,
And freedom with order unites.
Chor. Like pillars we stand, etc.
Nor let the fair maid
Our mysteries dread,
Or think them repugnant to love;
To beauty we bend,
And her empire defend,
Her empire derived from above.
Chor. Like pillars we stand, etc.
Then let us unite,
Sincere and upright,
On the level of virtue to stand:
No mortal can be
So happy as we,
With a brother and friend in each hand.
Chor. Like pillars we stand, etc.
SONG XIV.
We have no idle prating
Of either Whig or Tory:
But each agrees
To live at ease,
And sing or tell a story.
CHORUS.
Fill to him,
To the brim,
Let it round the table roll;
The divine
Tells you wine
Chears the body and the soul.
We Are always men of pleasure,
Despising pride and party;
While knaves and fools
Prescribe us rules,
We are sincere and hearty.
Chor. Fill to him, etc.
If an Accepted Mason
Should talk of high or low church;
We'll set him down
A shallow crown,
And understand him no church.
Chor. Fill to him, etc.
The world is all in darkness;
About us they conjecture,
But little think,
A song and drink
Succeeds the Mason's lecture.
Chor. Fill to him, etc.
Then, landlord, bring a hogshead,
And in the corner place it;
Till it rebound,
With hollow sound,
Each Mason here will face it.
Chor. Fill to him, etc.
To the memory of him who first planted a vine.
SONG XV.
1.
COME lend me your ears, loving Brethren, a while,
Quite sober my senses, though joking my style;
I Will tell you such wonders unknown to all those
Who flutter in verse, or who hobble in prose.
Derry down, down,
Down, derry down.
2.
While yet in confusion the Chaos it lay,
Ere evening and morning had made the first day,
And all the materials lay jumbled together,
Like so many Dutchmen, in thick foggy weather.
Derry down, etc.
3.
When to this confusion no end there appeared,
The sovereign GRAND MASTER'S word sudden was heard,
Who ordered materials to form and compose,
And thus the Grand Lodge of this world (...) arose.
Derry down, etc.
4.
Then heaven and earth with jubilee rung,
And all the creation with Masonry sung;
And then to adorn and complete the gay ball,
Old Adam was made the Grand Master of all.
Derry down, etc.
5.
But Satan met EVE, as she was a-gadding,
Which set her, as since all her daughters, a-madding,
To find out the secrets of true Masonry,
She eat of the fruit which she plucked from the tree.
Derry down, etc.
6.
Her head then was filled with many strange fancies,
As ever were young girls that deal in romances,
And being with knowledge sufficiently crammed,
She said to her husband, take, eat, and be d -- d.
Derry down, etc.
7.
Adam looked on her, as one struck with thunder,
He viewed her from head to foot over with wonder;
And since you have done this thing, madam, said he,
For your sake, no woman Free Mason shall be.
Derry down, etc.
8.
Then she did bewail in sorrowful ditty,
Till at last he beheld her, and on her took pity:
Free Masons are tender, so he to the dame
Bestowed his white apron to cover her shame.
Derry down, etc.
9.
Then they did solace themselves in mutual joys,
Till in process of time they had two chopping boys;
The priest of the parish, as gossips devised,
By name Cain and Abel the youths canonized
Derry down, etc.
10.
Next, old Father SETH, he mounted the stage,
In manners severe, though in Masonry sage,
He built him two pillars, so strong and so thick,
The one was of stone, and the other of brick.
Derry down, etc.
11.
But, in a short time, men turned past all enduring,
There was nothing but gaming, and drinking, and whoring,
Till Jove being wroth, rose up in his anger,
And said he would suffer such miscreants no longer.
Derry down, etc.
12.
Then from the high windows of heaven did pour,
Forty days, forty nights, one continued shower,
Till nothing but waters were seen all around,
And in this great deluge most mortals were drowned.
Derry down, etc.
13.
Sure never appeared such a very odd sight,
As to see the old world in this very sad plight;
For here in the waters all animals swimming,
Men, monkeys, priests, lawyers, cats, lap-dogs and women.
Derry down, etc.
14.
Here floated a debtor away from his duns,
There old father grey-beard, stark-naked, amongst nuns;
And here a poor husband, quite careless of life,
Contented in drowning, to shake off his wife.
Derry down, etc.
15.
A King and a cobbler were mingled in view,
Of rakes and young spendthrifts there were not a few;
A whale and a Dutchman came down with the tide,
And a reverend old Bishop by a young wench's side.
Derry down, etc.
16.
But NOAH was wisest, for Noah judged right,
He built him an ark so strong and so tight,
That, though heaven and earth were coming together,
He kept close in his Lodge, and stood buff to the weather.
Derry down, etc.
17.
And, after the Flood, like a Brother so true,
Who still had the good of the Craft in his view,
He delved the ground, and he planted the vine,
He founded a Lodge, aye, and gave his Lodge wine.
Derry down, etc.
18.
Let statesmen toss, tumble, and jingle the ball,
We'll sit here in our Lodge, and laugh at them all:
Let priests have their lawn sleeves, and Kings their anointment,
Free-Masonry sure was by heaven's appointment.
Derry down, etc.
19.
To our noble Grand Master, great FORBES by name,
Whose virtue and prudence the Craft does so fame;
That the Craft it may flourish, and constantly spring,
Which every true Mason will joyfully sing.
Derry down, etc.
SONG XVI.
To the tune of the Entered 'Prentice.
1.
COME are you prepared,
Your scaffolds well reared,
Bring mortar, and temper it purely;
It Is all safe I hope,
Well braced with each rope,
Your ledgers and putlocks securely.
2.
Then next your bricks bring,
It is time to begin,
For the sun with its rays is adorning;
The day's fair and clear,
No rain you need fear,
It Is a charming, lovely, fine morning.
3.
Pray where are your tools,
Your line and plumb-rules?
Each man to his work let him stand boys;
Work solid and sure,
Upright and secure,
And your building be sure will be strong boys.
4.
Pray make no mistake,
But true your joints break,
And take care that you follow your leaders;
Work, rake, back, and tueth,
And make your work smooth,
And be sure that you fill up your headers.
SONG XVII.
1.
WE Brethren Free-Masons, let us mark the great name;
Most ancient and loyal, recorded by fame:
In unity met, let us merrily sing;
The life of a Mason's like that of a King,
2.
No discord, no envy, amongst us shall be,
No confusion of tongues, but let us all agree:
Not, like building of Babel, confound one another;
But fill up your glasses, and drink to each Brother.
3.
A tower they wanted to lead them to bliss,
I hope there is no Brother but knows what it is;
Three principal steps in our ladder there be,
A mystery to all but those that are free.
4.
Let the strength of our reason keep the square of our heart,
And virtue adorn every man in his part;
The name of a cowan we'll not ridicule,
But pity his folly, and count him a fool.
5.
Let Us lead a good life, whilst power we have,
And when our frail bodies are laid in the grave,
We hope with good conscience to Heaven to climb,
And give Peter the pass-word, the token, and sign.
6.
Saint Peter he opens, and so we pass in
To a place that is prepared for all those free from sin;
To that heavenly Lodge, that is tyl'd most secure,
A place that is prepared for all Masons pure.
SONG XVIII.
1.
IT IS Masonry unites mankind,
To generous actions forms the soul;
In friendly converse all conjoined,
One spirit animates the whole.
2.
Wherever aspiring domes arise,
Wherever sacred altars stand;
Those altars blaze unto the skies,
Those domes proclaim the Mason's hand.
3.
As passions rough the soul disguise,
Till science cultivates the mind;
So the rude stone unshapen lies,
Till by the Mason's art refined.
4.
Though still our chief concern and care
Be to deserve a Brother's name;
Yet ever mindful of the fair,
Their kindest influence we claim.
5.
Let wretches at our manhood rail,
But they who once our order prove,
Will own that we, who build so well,
With equal energy can love.
6.
Sing Brethren then the Craft divine,
(Best band of social joy and mirth)
With choral sound, and cheerful wine,
Proclaim its virtues over the earth.
SONG XIX.
1.
HAIL! MASONRY divine,
Glory of ages shine,
Long may thou hold;
Wherever thy Lodges stand,
May they have great command,
And always grace the land,
Thou art divine.
2.
Great fabrics still arise,
And touch the azure skies,
Great are thy schemes;
Thy noble orders are
Matchless beyond compare,
No art with thee can share,
Thou art divine.
3.
Hiram, the Architect,
Did all the Craft direct,
How they should build;
SOLOMON, great Israel's King,
Did mighty blessings bring,
And left us room to sing,
Hail! Royal ART.
SONG XX.
1.
ATTEND, attend the strains,
Ye Masons Free, whilst I
To celebrate your fame,
Your virtues sound on high;
Accepted Masons, free and bold,
Will never live the dupes to gold.
2.
Great SOLOMON the king,
Great architect of fame,
Of whom all coasts did ring,
Revered a Mason's name:
Like him, accepted, free and bold,
True wisdom we prefer to gold.
3.
Since him the great and wise
Of every age and clime,
With fame that never dies,
Pursued the art sublime;
Inspired by Heaven, just and free,
Have honored much our mystery.
4.
The glorious paths of those,
With heaven-born wisdom crowned,
We every day disclose,
And tread on sacred ground;
A Mason, righteous, just, and free.
Or else not worthy Masonry.
SONG XXI.
1.
ATTEND loving Brethren, and to me give ear,
Our work being ended, let us lay aside care;
Let mirth and good humor our senses regale,
And mind that our secrets we never reveal.
And mind, etc.
2.
With leave of his Worship that here fills the chair,
Who governs our actions by compass and square,
We'll sing a few verses in Masonry's praise,
Not fond of ambition, we look for no bays.
Not fond, etc.
3.
Our ancient Grand Master, inspired by the Lord,
On holy Moriah, as in scripture declared,
The stupenduous structure began well to frame,
In the month called Zif, and fourth year of his reign,
In the, etc.
4.
With level and square the foundation began,
In length sixty cubits, breadth nineteen and one;
Here Masonry shined above all other arts,
So sublime the great secret the artist imparts.
So sublime, etc.
5.
Old HIRAM of Tire, King DAVID'S great friend,
Did fir, pine, and cedar, from Lebanon send,
To build the Sanctorum by Masonry's skill,
Subsequent unto the great architect's will.
Subsequent, etc.
6.
One hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred,
Employed for the temple, we find they were numbered;
With Crafts many thousands, and bearers of loads,
And Masters six hundred the text does record.
And masters, etc.
7.
Who formed themselves into Lodges they say,
Some east and some west, some north and south way,
In love, honor and truth, go successfully on,
In all well governed kingdoms now under the sun.
In all, etc.
8.
Now let the brisk bumper go merrily round,
May our worthy Master in honor abound,
May his instructive precepts to virtue us move,
To live like true Brethren in friendship and love,
To live, etc.
9.
Let moderns and critics, with impious rage,
Amuse the vain crowd, and against us engage;
Let Prichard and followers, apostates profane,
With false tenets puzzle each lethargic brain.
With false, etc.
10.
All health to our Brethren of every degree,
Dispersed round the globe, or by land or by sea;
Preserve them ye powers, their virtues improve,
When we part on the level, may we all meet above,
When we, etc.
SONG XXII.
1.
COME all ye elves that be,
Come follow, follow me;
All you that guards have been
Without, and served within;
Sing, let joy through us resound,
For all this Lodge is sacred ground.
2.
Guides too, that fairies are,
Come, five by five, prepare,
Come bring fresh oil with speed,
Your dying lamps to feed;
All trimmed in new and glittering light,
For welcome garments must be white.
3.
Come seraphs too, that be,
Bright rulers, three by three*
Attend on me, your Queen,
Two handmaids led between;
Whilst all around this health I name,
Shall make the hollow sounds proclaim.
4.
Whilst Sylvans and their loves,
Over mountains and in groves,
With brighter gems, and sprightly dames,
Of fountains and of flames;
With joyful noise of hand and feet,
Shall echo, and the noise repeat.
5.
Whilst we who sing and love,
And live in springs above;
Descend, descend, do we,
With Masons to be free;
Where springs of joy revive each face,
And streams of wine flow round the place.
6.
Whilst cherubs guard the door,
With flaming sword before,
We through the keyhole creep,
And there we deeply peep,
Over all their jewels skip and leap,
And trip it, trip it, step by step.
7.
Or as upon the green,
We fairies turn unseen,
So here we make a ring,
Whilst merry Masons sing;
Around their crowns we whirl apace,
And not one single hair misplace.
8.
And down from thence we jump,
All with a silent thump;
None hear our feet rebound,
Round, round, the table round;
None see us, while we nimbly pass
Thrice round the rim of every glass.
9.
But if any crumbs withal
Down from the table fall,
With greedy mirth we eat,
No honey is so sweet!
And when they drop it from their thumb,
We catch it supernaculum.
10.
Now as for Masonry,
Although we are not free,
In Lodges we have been,
And all their signs have seen;
Yet such love to the Craft we bear,
Their secrets we will never declare.
SONG XXIII.
1.
WITH plumb, level, and square, to work let us prepare,
And join in sweet harmony;
Let Us fill up each glass, and around let it pass,
To all honest men that are free,
To all honest men that are free.
CHORUS
Then a fig for all those, who are Free-Masons foes,
Our secrets we'll never impart;
But in unity we'll always agree,
And chorus it, prosper our art prosper our art,
And chorus it, prosper our art*
2.
When we are properly clothed, the master discloses
The secret that is lodged in his breast;
Thus we stand by the cause, that deserves great applause,
In which we are happy and blessed.
In which, etc.
Chor. Then a fig for all those, etc.
3.
The bible's our guide, and by that we'll abide,
Which shows that our actions are pure;
The compass and square are emblems most rare
Of justice, our cause to insure.
Of justice, etc.
Chor. Then a fig for all those, etc.
4.
The cowan may strive, nay, plot and contrive,
To find out our great mystery;
The inquisitive wife may in vain spend her life,
For still we'll be honest and free.
For still, etc.
Chor. Then a fig for all those, etc.
5.
True brotherly love we always approve,
Which makes us all mortals excel;
If a knave should by chance to this grandeur advance,
That villain we'll straightway expel.
That villain, etc.
Chor, Then a fig for all those, etc.
6.
So our Lodge that is pure, to the end shall endure,
In virtue and true secresy;
Then let us toast a good health, with honor and wealth,
To the blessed hands that made us so free.
To the kind hands that made us so free.
Chor. Then a fig for all those, etc.
SONG XXIV.
1.
GUARDIAN Genius of our art divine,
Unto thy faithful Sons appear;
Cease now over ruins of the east to pine,
And smile in blooming beauties here.
2.
Syria, Egypt, and proud Babylon,
No more thy blissful presence claim;
America now claims thy during throne,
Where myriads do confess thy name.
3.
The Sciences from eastern regions brought,
Which after shown in Greece and Rome,
Are here in many stately Lodges taught,
To which remotest Brethren come.
4.
Behold what strength our rising domes uprears,
'Till mixing with the azure skies;
Behold what beauty through the whole appears,
So wisely built, they must surprise.
5.
Nor are we only to these arts confined,
For we the paths of virtue trace;
By us man's rugged nature is refined,
And polished into love and peace.
SOLOMON's TEMPLE: AN ORATORIO.
As performed at the Philharmonic-Room, in Dublin, for the Benefit of sick and
distressed Free-Masons.

The Words by Mr. James Air Weeks.

The Music composed by Mr. Richard Broadway, Organist of St. Patrick's
Cathedral.

SOLOMON, the Grand Master. HIGH PRIEST. HIRAM, the Workman. URIEL, Angel of
the Sun. SHEBA, Queen of the South. Chorus of Priests and Nobles.
SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. Convened we are met -- chief oracle of heaven,
To whom the sacred mysteries are given;
We Are met to bid a splendid fabric rise,
Worthy the mighty Ruler of the skies.

High Priest. And lo! where Uriel, Angel of the Sun,
Arrives to see the mighty business done.
AIR. Behold he comes upon the wings of light,
And with his sunny vestment chears the sight.

URIEL. RECITATIVE. The Lord supreme, Grand Master of the skies,
Who bid creation from a chaos rise,
The rules of architecture first engraved
On Adam's heart.
Chorus of Priests and Nobles. To heaven's High Architect all praise,
All gratitude be given,
Who deigned the human soul to raise,
By secrets sprung from heaven.

SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. Adam, well versed in arts,
Gave to his sons the Plumb and Line;
By Masonry, sage Tubal Cain
To the deep organ tuned the strain.
AIR. And while he swelled the melting note,
On high the silver concords float.

HIGH PRIEST. RECITATIVE, accompanied. Upon the surface of the waves,
(When God a mighty deluge pours)
Noah a chosen remnant saves,
And laid the ark's stupendous floors.

URIEL. AIR. Hark from on high the Mason word,
"David my servant shall not build
"A Lodge for heaven's all Sovereign Lord,
"Since blood and war have stained his shield;
"That for the deputy, his son,
"We have reserved -- Prince Solomon."
Da Capo. Chorus of Priests and Nobles. Sound great JEHOVAH's praise!
Who bid young Solomon the temple raise.

SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. So grand a structure shall we raise,
That men shall wonder! Angels gaze!
By art divine it shall be reared,
Nor shall the hammer's noise be heard.
CHORUS. Sound great JEHOVAH's praise!
Who bid King SOLOMON the temple raise.

URIEL. RECITATIVE. To plan the mighty dome,
HIRAM, the Master-Mason's come.

URIEL. AIR. We know thee, by thy apron white,
An architect to be;
We know thee, by thy trowel bright,
Well skilled in Masonry,
We know thee by thy jewel's blaze,
Thy manly walk and air,
Instructed, thou the Lodge shall raise;
Let all for work prepare.

HIRAM. AIR. Not like Babel's haughty building
Shall our greater Lodge be framed;
That to hideous jargon yielding,
Justly was a Babel named:
There confusion, all o'er-bearing,
Neither sign nor word they knew;
We our work with order squaring,
Each proportion shall be true.

SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. Cedars, which since creation grew,
Fall of themselves to grace the dome;
All Lebanon, as if she knew
The great occasion -- lo is come!

URIEL. AIR. Behold, my Brethren of the sky,
The work begins, worthy an angel's eye.
Chorus of Priests and Nobles. Be present all ye heavenly host,
The work begins -- the Lord defrays the cost!

ACT II.
MESSENGER. RECITATIVE. BEHOLD, attended by a numerous train,
Queen of the south, fair Sheba, greets thy reign!
In admiration of thy wisdom, she
Comes to present the bended knee.

SOLOMON to HIRAM. RECITATIVE. Receive her with a fair salute;
Such as with majesty may suit.

HIRAM. AIR. When the Grand Master bids obey,
We with pleasure own his sway.
Enter SHEBA attended. Obedient to superior greatness, see
Our scepter hails thy mightier Majesty.
Thus Phoebe, Queen of shade and night,
Owning the sun's superior rays,
With feebler glory, lesser light,
Attends the triumph of his blaze.
Oh! all-excelling Prince, receive
The tribute due to such a King!
Not the gift, but will, believe!
Take the heart, not what we bring.
Da Capo.
SOLOMON. RECITATIVE. Let measures softly sweet
Illustrious SHEBA'S presence greet.

SOLOMON. AIR. Tune the lute snd string the lyre,
Equal to the fair we sing!
Who can see and not admire
SHEBA, consort for a King!
Enlivening wit and beauty join,
Melting sense and graceful air,
Here united powers combine
To make her brightest of the fair.
Da Capo.
SOLOMON. RECITATIVE Hiram, our Brother and our friend,
Do thou the Queen with me attend.

SCENE II. A View of the Temple.
HIGH PRIEST. RECITATIVE. Sacred to heaven behold the dome appears;
Lo, what august solemnity it wears;
Angels themselves have deigned to deck the frame,
And beauteous SHEBA shall report its fame.
AIR. When the Queen of the south shall return
To the climes which acknowledge her sway,
Where the sun's warmer beams fiercely burn,
The Princes with transport shall say,
Well worthy my journey, I Have seen
A Monarch both graceful and wise,
Deserving the love of a Queen;
And a temple well worthy the skies.
Da Capo. CHORUS. Open, ye gates, receive a Queen who shares
With equal sense your happiness and cares.

HIRAM. RECITATIVE. Of riches much, but more of wisdom, see,
Proportioned workmanship and Masonry.

HIRAM. AIR. Oh charming SHEBA, there behold,
What massy stores of burnished gold,
Yet richer is our art;
Not all the orient gems that shine,
Nor treasures of rich Ophir's mine,
Excel the Mason's heart:
True to the fair, he honors more
Than glittering gems or brighter ore,
The plighted pledge of love;
To every tie of honor bound,
In love and friendship constant found,
And favored from above.

SOLOMON and SHEBA. DUET. SHEBA. One gem beyond the rest I see,
And charming SOLOMON is he.

SOLOMON. One gem beyond the rest I see,
Fairest of fair-ones, thou art she.

SHEBA. Oh thou surpassing all men wise;

SOLOMON. And thine excelling women's eyes.

HIRAM. RECITATIVE. Wisdom and beauty both combine
Our art to raise, our hearts to join.
CHORUS. Give to MASONRY the prize,
Where the fairest choose the wise:
Beauty still should wisdom love;
Beauty and order reign above.

FINIS.
