THE RURAL HARMONY, BEING AN ORIGINAL COMPOSITION IN THREE and FOUR PARTS. For
the USE of SINGING SCHOOLS and MUSICAL SOCIETIES.

BY JACOB KIMBALL, JUN. A. B.

The man who has not music in his soul,
And is not moved by concert of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
And his affections dark as Erebus.

PREFACE.
IN a country where music has not yet become a regular profession, it cannot be
expected that a composition of this kind can stand a rigid criticism; but as
every attempt to subserve the interest, or to increase the innocent pleasures
of the community, deserves public patronage, the author of the following work,
without further apology, presents it to the public eye.

He has aimed at originality in his compositions, and endeavored to deviate
(as far as he deemed it justifiable) from the common style; where he has given
into it, he has attempted to improve it by a particular attention to the
harmony.

Those who have encouraged the work by subscription, are respectfully thanked,
and are assured that the utmost pains have been taken to render the work
correct; such errors as escaped observation in the execution of it, are noticed
in the errata.

The author sincerely wishes that the purchasers of the work may derive
sufficient advantage from it, to compensate them for their expenses; but should
the reverse be true, he will as sincerely lament that he and his friends have
mistaken his abilities.

TOPSFIELD, Novem. 1793.
INTRODUCTION to the ART of SINGING.
Of MUSIC in GENERAL.
"MUSIC consists in a succession of pleasing sounds;" -- As a Science, it
demonstrates and explains their true relation and just disposition; -- as an
Art, it teaches their proper expression.

All music is comprehended in melody and harmony. Melody is a single
succession of founds; or, in other words, is the air of a piece of music.
Harmony is the combination of several sounds at the same time. Modulation is
the just arrangement of the sounds both of the Melody and Harmony.

The primary and most essential qualities of musical sounds are, Time and Tune;
upon a due attention to these distinctions, and their judicious management,
depends all the pleasing and infinite variety of the musical art.

Of the GAMUT, or SCALE of MUSIC.
There are but seven distinct degrees of sound in the scale; five of which are
called whole, and two are called half, or semi-tones. Every eighth from any
given sound will be the same, and the degrees of ascent or descent from it,
will be in effect a repetition of the former sounds. These seven sounds are
represented on lines and spaces by the seven first letters of the alphabet;
their places on them are as follow: Bass.
B Mi. A -- La. G Sol. F * -- Fa. E La. D -- Sol. C Fa. B -- Mi. A La. G --
Sol. F Fa. Counter.
A La. G -- Sol. F Fa. E -- La. D Sol. C * -- Fa. B Mi. A -- La. G Sol. F --
Fa. E La. Tenor, or Treble.
G Sol. F -- Fa. F La. D -- Sol. C Fa. B -- Mi. A La. G * Sol. F Fa. E -- La. D
Sol.

THE scale is divided into three parts; each part, consisting of five lines,
with their spaces, and distinguished with a cliff, is called a stave.

The first division is called the Bass stave; its cliff is thus marked * and is
called the F cliff -- it is always placed on the fourth line from the bottom.

The second division of the scale is called the Counter stave; -- its cliff is
thus marked * and is called the C cliff. It is commonly placed on the middle
line of the stave. This cliff, however, is moveable, and may be placed on
either of the five lines or spaces; that line or space which passes between the
two transverse strokes, will be C, and all the other letters of the scale will
be in regular succession above and below it.

The third and last division of the scale is called the Treble or Tenor stave;
its cliff is marked thus * and is called the G cliff; its place is invariably
on the second line from the bottom.

There are but four names of notes representing sounds, viz. Mi, Fa, Sol, La:
of which Mi is the principal, and governs all the rest; and when Mi is found,
the order of the notes above it will be Fa, Sol, La, Fa, Sol, La; and below Mi,
La, Sol, Fa, and then Mi recurs, either way.

It has been before observed, that of the seven degrees of sound in the scale,
two are semi-tones; their natural places are between B and C, and E and F.
Their situation, however, is often varied by flats and sharps, which transpose
Mi from B, its natural place; in all which cases the semitones will be between
Mi and Fa, and La and Fa, as in the natural scale.

TABLE of the TRANSPOSITION of MI, by FLATS and SHARPS.
Mi on B, its natural place. B flat Mi on E. B and E flat Mi on A. B, E and A
flat Mi on D. B, E, A and D flat Mi on G. F sharp Mi on F. F and C sharp Mi on
C. F, C, and G sharp Mi on G. F, C, G and D sharp Mi on D. Tenor or Treble. * ^
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Counter. * ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Bass. * ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^

Mi may be transposed to other places by flats, and also by sharps; but the
foregoing examples, with a suitable attention to the following rule, will be
sufficient to illustrate the matter.

A flat must be placed a fourth above, or a fifth below the one last added; and
Mi will be a fourth above, or a fifth below that. -- A sharp must be placed a
fifth above, or a fourth below the one last added -- Mi is always on the letter
last sharped.

The MUSICAL NOTES, with their RESTS.
Semibreve. Minim, Crotchet. Quaver. Semiquaver. Demisemiquaver. Rests. 2 bars
4 bars 8 bars Notes. * * * * * * Rests. * * * * * * * * *

The following SCALE will show the Proportion of the Notes to each other.

1 Semibreve -- * -- Contains 2 -- ** -- Minims. 4 -- **** -- Crotchets. 8 --
******** -- Quavers. 16 -- **************** -- Semiquavers. 32
******************************** Demisemiquavers.


Rests are notes of silence. The semibreve rest is considered as a bar rest;
all the others are of the same determinate length with the notes by which they
are called, and which they represent.

MUSICAL CHARACTERS and TERMS, with their EXPLANATIONS and USES.
A flat A FLAT at the beginning of a tune regulates the Mi; before any note, it
sinks it half a tone from its natural pitch. A sharp This character also, at
the beginning of a tune, regulates the Mi; when it is placed before any note,
it raises it half a tone from its natural pitch. A Natural This character is
never used, unless to counteract the effect of one or the other of the
foregoing, and restores a note to its natural piteh. When it is placed in
opposition to a flat, it raises a note half a tone; but when it is placed in
opposition to a sharp, it finks a note half a tone.
These three are very important characters in music; and their effects and uses
should be carefully and critically explained to learners by every teacher.

Point of Addition. ^ This point, placed after a note, makes its sound half as
long again as it would be without it. Point of Diminution. 3 A point of
diminution placed over or under any three notes, reduces them to the time of
two of the same kind. Single Bars. * Single bars are perpendicular lines drawn
through the stave; their use is to divide the notes into equal portions of two,
three or four beats, according to the mode of time in which the music is
composed. Double Bar. * A double bar denotes the end of a strain. Repeat.:S: or
* A repeat directs that the music, from the note where it is placed, be sung
over again; when it is placed before a double bar or close, it is to remind the
performer that the preceding strain, or some part of it, is to be repeated.
Figures. 1. 2. These figures are used only when some part of the music is to be
repeated; the note under figure 1 is to be performed the first time; the second
time, it is omitted, and the note or notes under figure 2 performed; sometimes
they are connected by a slur, and then they are both performed. A Slur. A slur
is drawn over or under so many notes as belong to one syllable. A Brace.
{musical bracket} * A brace shows how many parts move together. A Hold. * A
hold placed over a note shows that it is to be sounded longer than its true
time. This character, though too generally neglected, when properly attended
to, produces a very pleasing effect. A Direct. * A direct placed at the end of
a stave points out the place of the first note in the next stave. Ledger Line.
Sometimes the notes extend beyond the compass of the stave; in such cases,
short lines are added, called Ledger Lines. A Close. * A close shows the end of
a piece of music. Trill or Shake. tr. A trill or shake is a quick and alternate
repetition of the note over which it is placed, and the note immediately above
it (from which the trill begins) so long as the time will allow; thus ^

A trill may be open or close; if the note immediately above that to be shaken
be a whole tone from it, it will be an open shake; if but half a tone, it will
be a close shake.

When the note immediately under that to be shaken is inserted just before the
conclusion of the trill, it is called a turned shake.

The trill is a very beautiful grace, but as it is very difficult to be
acquired, it may not be amiss to propose the following substitute for it, till
it can be perfectly learned, viz.

Example. ^

This manner of performing a trill, if the note be not a long one, and if the
note succeeding it be descending, produces a very agreeable effect.

Marks of Distinction, ''' or Stoccato. These imply that such passages must be
sung very distinctly and emphatically. Choosing Notes. ^ Choosing notes are
placed immediately over each other; the performer may sing which of them he
pleases; if there be several performers to the same part, all the notes should
be sung. Appoggiatura. ^ The appoggiatura is a small note added to the regular
notes in the bar to lead the voice more easily and gracefully into the sound of
the succeeding note; it should be dwelt upon according to the value of the
note; but whatever time is given to it, must be taken from the succeeding note.
It is often used as a preparation for a trill. Notes of Transitionn^ Notes of
transition are also small notes added to the regular notes, and usually slurred
to them; the time given to them is commonly taken from the preceding note, and
always from the note to which they are tied. Transition is considered as a
musical grace, and judicious performers may introduce it in many places where
the notes are not expressed in the composition; but young singers should be
cautioned against its two frequent use; for an unskillful introduction of it,
instead of gracing, will have quite a contrary effect upon the music; and
indeed this, and every other musical grace, had better be entirely omitted than
performed in an irregular manner. Piano. Directs the performer to sing soft
like an echo. Pianissimo. Very soft. Forte. Loud and strong. Fortissimo. Very
loud.
The foregoing terms are very frequently contrasted in musical compositions,
and ought to be strictly attended to, for otherwise the design of the composer
will be obscured, if not wholly lost.

Crescendo. This implies that the force of the voice must increase gradually
till the strain is ended. Diminuendo. Means the reverse of the foregoing, and
is sometimes set in opposition to it; when properly performed they make no
trifling addition to the beauties of music. Maestoso. Passages which have this
term placed over thern must be performed flow and with majesty and grandeur.
Con. Spirito. With life and spirit Vigoroso. With strength and firmness.
Vivace. In a lively, cheerful manner. Moderato. Somewhat slower than the true
time. Presto. Faster than the true time. Andante. Implies a moderate, equal and
distinct manner of performing. Adagio. Denotes the slowest movement; and is the
proper name of the first mode in common time. Largo. Denotes a movement some
faster than adagio, and is the name of the second mode in common time. Allegro.
Denotes a quick movement, and is the name of the third mode in common time.
Grave, or Gravement. Denotes a slow movement between Adagio and Largo; it
requires also a solemn manner of singing. Largetto. Is a movement between Largo
and Allegro.
A variety of other musical terms might be explained, but as they are not often
met within music books in this country, it may not be necessary to insert them.

Of TIME, and its various MARKS or MODES.
THERE are three kinds of time made use of in Music, viz. Common Time, Treble
Time, and Compound Time.

Common Time is divided into four modes. The first mode is called Adagio, and
is thus marked {common time (adagio)} This mode contains one semibreve, or the
value thereof in other notes or rests in each bar: -- The bar is usually
performed in the time of four seconds.

The second mode of common time is called Largo, and thus marked {common time
(largro)} It contains the same quantity of notes in the bar as the foregoing,
but is performed a quarter faster.

The third mode of common time is called Allegro, and thus marked {common time
(allegro)} This also contains the same notes in a bar as the first mode, but
the bar is performed in the time of two seconds.

The fourth mode of common time is marked 2/4 and contains the amount of one
minim in the bar: -- it is performed about one quarter faster than the Allegro
mode.

Treble time is divided into three modes. The first mode is marked thus 3/2 and
contains three minims in a bar, or other notes and rests to that amount. The
bar is performed in the time of three sconds.

The second mode of treble time is marked thus 3/4 and contains three crotchets
or their value in each bar, and is performed about a quarter faster.

The third mode of treble time is thus marked 3/8 and contains the value of
three quavers in a bar: This mode is performed about a quarter faster than the
second.

There are many modes of compound time, two of which only shall be noticed here.

The first mode is thus marked 6/4 and contains the value of six crotchets in a
bar. The bar is performed in the time of two seconds.

The second mode is thus marked 6/8 and contains the amount of six quavers in a
bar. It is performed one quarter fafter than the first mode.

It may not be unserviceable to observe in this place, that the first mode of
common time is the standard with which all other modes are compared, and by
which they are regulated. All modes which are marked with figures have a
primary reference to this mode, and are derived from it; -- thus, the mark 2/4
denotes that the bar must contain two fourths of a bar in the first mode of
common time, or (which is the same thing) of a semibreve; and all other figures
distinguishing different modes may be considered as fractions of a semibreve;
the under figure expressing how many parts the semibreve must be divided into,
and the upper figure showing how many of those parts are contained in a bar.

When the modes above explained are thoroughly understood, a proper attention
to the foregoing remarks will enable any one to acquire an idea of all other
modes marked with figures, without any further illustration.

Of BEATING TIME.
BEATING time is an artificial way of measuting the proportionate duration of
the notes; the common methods of doing which, are as follow, yiz. For the two
first modes of common time, which have four beats in a bar, 1st, let the ends
of the fingers fall; 2d, the heel of the hand; 3d, raise the heel of the hand;
4th, throw up the ends of the fingers, and the bar will be finished.

For the third and fourth modes of common time, and for the 6/4 and 6/8 modes
of compound time, which have only two beats in a bar, 1st, let the hand fall;
2d, raise it, and the bar will be completed.

For treble time, all the modes of which have three beats in a bar, 1st, let
the ends of the fingers fall; 2d, the heel of the hand; 3d, throw up the ends
of the fingers, etc.

faster or slower than their comparative length as explained before, when
musical terms expressing moderation or hastening are applied to them.

Of SYNCOPATION.
NOTES of Syncopation are such as have their sound continued through bars, or
are placed out of their natural order in them; very difficult examples of such
notes may be framed, but when words are applied to them, they induce a forced
and vicious pronunciation, and never occur in good vocal music; the common
instances are by no means difficult to be executed, and do not merit a
particular explanation.

Of ACCENT.
ACCENT is a certain modulation or warbling of the sounds, in order to express
the passions naturally with the voice.

Accented parts of the bar are, for common time, the first and third parts; for
treble time, the first part only; for compound time, the first and fourth parts
of the bar; and emphatical words should be set to those parts; but it will
often happen, that such words will occur in other parts, and the accented parts
have words of no emphasis; in which cases, every one must feel the propriety of
the music's bending to the words, and that the general rule for accenting must
be neglected; and from hence, may be inferred, that the doctrine of accent is
designed more for the use of the composer, than of the performer.

Of the KEYS of MUSIC.
THERE are but two keys in music, viz. 1st, the major or sharp key, and 2d. the
minor or flat key. The first of these is adapted to express the cheerful
passions, and the latter is expressive of the solemn, the mournful and the
pathetic.

The key note is that sound upon which a tune may be said to be built: -- It is
the predominant tone, to which all others have a particular reference; it is
commonly the concluding note of the tenor, and always that of the bass, In
reckoning from the key note, if the semitones in the octave be between the
third and the fourth, and between the seventh and the eighth, the tune is in
the major or sharp key; if they lie between the second and third, and between
the fifth and sixth, it is in the minor or flat key.

In the natural scale the key note of the major key, will be C; of the minor it
will be A.

EXAMPLES.

C, Major Key. ^ The regular places for the half tones are between B and C, and
E and F, an examination of the octave as laid down above, shows that they lie
between the third and fourth, and between the seventh and eighth, consequently
it is in the sharp key, etc.

A, Minor Key. ^ An examination of this octave shows that the semitones are
between the second and third, and between the fifth and sixth, of course it is
the flat key, etc.

No tune can be regularly composed on any other letter besides C and A, without
the assistance of flats or sharps; but, by a proper placing of them on the
lines and spaces, every semitone contained in the octave may be made the
foundation or key note of a tune: For in stance, if the letter C be taken for
the key note of a tune in the major key, one of the semitones will be between
the sixth and seventh, whereas it should be between the seventh and eighth;
now, by placing a sharp on F, the sound of all the notes on that letter will be
a semitone higher than in the natural scale, and consequently leave but half a
tone between the seventh and eighth from G; by which mean, G then becomes
regularly the key note for a tune in the sharp key.

It would be no difficult task to extend this explanation through all the
semitones contained in the octave, but perhaps it may be sufficient for
learners to be taught to distinguish the keys, in the first place, by the
following rule, viz. if the key note be the Fa immediately above Mi, a third
from it will be a major third, and the music will be in the sharp key; but if
the key note be the La immediately under Mi, a third from it will be a minor
third, and the tune will be in the fiat key.

N. B. A. major third contains two whole, or four semitones. A minor third
contains but three semitones.

LESSONS for TUNING the VOICE.
Lesson in the major key. ^

N. B. This lesson should be well learned, and the relative distance of each
note from the key note, (as distinguished by the figures placed over them)
understood so as to be sounded readily, before tunes in the major key are
attempted.

Lesson in the minor key. ^

N. B. This lesson also should be well understood before tunes in the minor key
are attempted. Whichever of these lessons a teacher chooses his pupils should
first attend to, it is recommended that they be made to practice upon tunes in
the same key, before they endeavor to acquire a knowledge of the other, etc.

PARTICULAR OBSERVATIONS.
IN the following work, when tunes have but three parts, the treble is placed
between the tenor and the bass; when they have four parts, the tenor is placed
next to the bass, the counter next to the tenor, and the treble next to the
counter.

Flats, sharps, and naturals, are not considered as having influence (excepting
at the beginning of tunes or strains) upon any note but that immediately
succeeding.

The pitch of all the parts should be taken from the key note.

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.
EVERY person should sing that part to which his voice is best adapted; to
determine which, learners should submit to the judgment of their teacher.

The tone of the bass should be full and majestic; of the tenor, bold and
manly; of the counter, soft yet firm; of the treble, smooth and delicate.

High notes in every part should, in general, be sung softer than the low.

In a company of fingers it would have a good effect for some of the performers
on each part to be silent when passages marked piano, occur; the additional
strength of their voices in the forte, which generally precedes or succeeds the
piano, would mark the contrast more distinctly, and give peculiar force and
energy to the performance.

The various inflections of voice and tone, which render one air more
expressive of one passion than another, cannot be taught by certain and
infallible rules; a performer should endeavor to form a proper idea of the
author's design in a piece of music, and his own judgment and taste must be his
principal directors in doing justice to it.

A good and graceful manner of singing is best acquired by imitoetion. A
teacher cannot by precept alone instruct his pupils in the art of modulating
different airs to express different passions; but by example he can.

Every note of every part of an excellent piece of music may be founded,
strictly speaking, right, and the composition, nevertheless, appear dull and
trifling. It is the expressive manner -- the realizing the passion -- and
giving particular emphasis to those words which contain the force of the
sentiment, which give rise to the inexpressible delight derived from hearing
good musical performances.

The voice, the looks, the gestures of the performers, are severally necessary
to give music its full energy, and are respectively the sources of pleasure or
disgust to the observing hearer.

Besides the artificial graces of music, such as trills, appoggiatura, etc.
there are innumerable others which never have been, nor ever can be, defined;
but must be learned (as was hinted before) by imitation, or suggested by a
discerning judgment.

Few graces, however, if any, are admissible in full chorusses, unless they are
expressed in the composition; in strains of two or three parts, they may be
frequently introduced; but solos are the proper field for their full display.

A vulgar, inarticulate pronunciation -- a heavy, lifeless manner -- sudden and
unmeaning explosions of sound, are totally inconsistent with good singing; on
the other hand, a clear and spirited tone -- a just and accurate pronunciation
-- and occasional swells upon the notes, judiciously introduced, are
distinguishing characteristics of an elegant performer.

In good music, as well as in good poetry, or in any other species of good
writing, there are different styles; some of which, though they may not, at
first hearing, command a very favorable opinion, upon being often performed,
and rendered familiar, will please more, and longer, than others which were
thought superior; hence, the impropriety and injustice of hastily rejecting, as
worthless and insignificant, such music as may be composed out of the common
style.

In composition, it is an essential point to adapt the tune to the subject of
the song. Subjects of penitence, prayer, sorrow, etc. require tunes in the
minor key; and those of cheerfulness, joy, thanksgiving; etc. the major key;
but this rule is often violated; and with the most unhappy and ridiculous
effect. Can that joy, or praise, or thanksgiving be thought sincere, the
expression of which is accompanied with sighs, and groans, and tears? Can his
sorrow or distress appear otherwise than farcical, whose relation of it is
interrupted by sallies of pleasantry, and peals of laughter? If this be not an
unjust representation of the effect of disregarding the foregoing rule, (and it
is presumed it is not) it must be considered not only a transgression against
all musical propriety, but an outrageous affront to common sense.

In churches and congregations this rule demands a still more particular
attention; for an injudicious application of tunes to the psalms or hymns, will
make the performance appear a profane burlesque upon a very important duty.

A decent and regular demeanor in a band of singers, adds much to the pleasure
arising from their performances; in worshipping societies, a contrary behavior
is altogether inexcusable, and well deserves the censure of every sober mind;
for it argues a total insensibility to those solemn impressions, which every
one should feel when in the more immediate presence of the Supreme Being, and
employed in one of the highest acts of his worship.
