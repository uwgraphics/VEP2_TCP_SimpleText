Scorpio the Secrets. -- Sagitarius, the Thighs. -- Capricorn, t^^ Knees. --
Aquarius, the Legs. -- Pisces, the Feet.

THE NAMES AND CHARACTERS OF THE SEVEN PLANETS.
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, or {salt} Sol, Venus, Mercury, or Luna.

THE FIVE ASPECTS.
Conjunction, Opposition, ^trine; Trine, Quartile, Sextile.

ALL the calculations in this Almanac are made for apparent time, or that
deduced immediately from the Sun, either by observing his passing the meridian,
his rising or setting, or by the time shown by a sun-dial -- This time differs
from that shown by well regulated clocks or watches, and the equation of time
is their difference, which is given for every third day; its title shows
whether the sun is too fast or too slow, etc. The equation of time is of the
utmost importance in regulating clocks and watches; so that a person setting
his clock or watch by the Sun, ^ther from his passing the meridan, from a good
sun-dial, or from his rising or setting, must allow for the equation of time,
otherwise his clock or watch is just so much wrong; this in some months of the
year amounts to more than a quarter of an hour; and of consequence a very
considerable mistake is introduced, where it is neglected. -- The Aspects
inserted are the Conjunctions, Oppositions, and Square or Quartile Aspects of
the Sun and Planets, as being the only celestial paenomena of any importance;
but the Sextile and Trine Aspects are omitted, as of no utility, but in
astrological imposition. The two inferior Planets Venus and Mercury are
vespertine (evening) stars after the superior Conjunction; and matutine
(morning) stars after the inferior Conjunction; when they have their greatest
elongation their rising and setting are at the greatest distance before and
after the Sun's; and this is the best time for observing them; especially
Mercury, whose motion is so rapid that he can only be seen for a few days at
that time. From the time of the opposition to the conjunction of the superior
Planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, they are vespertine stars, but from the
conjunction to the opposition they are matutine stars: at the opposition they
come to the meridian at midnight, and at the quartile aspects they come to the
meridian (...) 6 o'clock, either in the evening or morning according as they
(...) vespertine or matutine stars.

HOPE: An Ode.
COME youthful muse, my breast inspire
With sparks of true poetic fire,
To sing of Hope, the only cure
Of all misfortunes men endure:
The captive's liberty, the sick man's health,
The lover's victory, the beggar's copious wealth.
Thou blessing sent us from above;
Rich offspring of celestial love!
Fair Hope! thy presence let me hail,
When grief intrudes, when pains assail.
Over life's rough sea, amid the tempests roar,
Pilot my rolling bark, and set me safe on shore.
It Is thine, when troubles rack the heart,
Thy lenient balsam to impart,
This load of life, oh! who could bear,
Did thou not swage each galling care.
Thy frowns all human happiness destroy,
Thy smiles dawn peace and everlasting joy.
The wretch of every friend bereft,
By kindred scorned, by fortune left,
The orphan plunged in seas of care,
The widowed wife, the injured heir,
Through the dark cloud that interrupts thy blaze,
Perceive thy glimmering light, and own thy cheering rays.
Repents, gasping out their breath,
And struggling with convulsive death,
Friendly lift up their dying eyes,
While nature tells her pangs in sighs;
To thee their ardent genuine wishes lend,
Implore thy healing aid, and in thee find a friend.
Supported by thy kindly hand,
The patriot in a sinking land,
Anxious to prop the falling state:
Smiles at fatigue, serenely great;
Retorts the dart of malice, truly brave,
And boldly stems the force of faction's waves.
The laws delay the lover's pain,
Oppression's whip, confinement's chain,
The scourge of pride and guilt's keen smart,
Would soon subdue the laboring heart;
But thou steps in the drooping soul to ease,
And giv'st a future view of more delightful days.
The LAWYER'S PRAYER: A Fragment.
ORDAINED to tread the thorny ground,
Where few, I fear, are faithful found;
Mine be the conscience void of blame,
The upright heart, the spotless name;
The tribute of the widow's prayer,
The righted orphan's grateful tear;
To virtue and her friends, a friend,
Still may my voice the weak defend:
Never may my prostituted tongue
Protect the oppressor in his wrong:
Nor wrest the spirit of the laws,
To sanctify the villain's cause;
Let others, with unsparing hand,
Scatter their poison through the land;
Inflame dissension, kindle strife,
And strew with ills the path of life;
On such, her gifts let fortune shower,
Add wealth to wealth, and power to power;
On me may favoring Heaven bestow,
That peace which good men only know;
The joy of joy, by few possessed,
The eternal sunshine of the breast:
Power, ^ame, and riches I resign,
The praise of honesty be mine:
That friends may weep, the worthy sigh,
And poor men bless me when I die.
THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR.
AS rapid rolls the year away,
Down the swift current of the times,
A moment let the reader stay,
And mark the moral of my rhymes.
As rivers glide toward the sea,
And sink and lose them in the main,
So man declines -- and what is he?
His hope, his wish, alas, how vain!
Fast goes the year, but still renewed,
The ball of time knows no decay
Sure signal of that greatest good,
We hope in God's eternal day.
OF earthly goods, the best is a good wife,
A bad, the bitterest curse of human life.
LIBERTY AND SLAVERY.
DISGUISE thyself as thou will, still, Slavery! still thou art a bitter
draught; and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink of thee, thou
art no less bitter on that account. It is thou, Liberty, thrice sweet and
gracious goddess! whom all in public or in private worship: whose taste is
grateful, and ever will be so, till nature herself shall change. No tint of
words can spot thy snowy mantle, or chymic power turn thy scepter into iron.
With thee to smile upon him as he eats his crust, the swain is happier than his
monarch, from whose court thou art exiled. Gracious Heaven! grant me but
health, thou great bestower of it; and give me but this fair goddess as my
companion, and shower down thy mitres, if it seem good unto thy providence,
upon those heads which are aching for them.

A GENERAL DESCRIPTION of AMERICA.
THIS great Western Continent, frequently denominated the New World, extends
from the 80th Degree North to the 56th of South Latitude; and, where its
breadth is known, from the 56th to the 136th Degree of West Longitude from
London, stretching from between 8 and 9000 Miles in length, and in its greatest
breadth 36^0. It sees both Hemispheres, has two Summers and a double Winter,
and enjoys all the variety of Climates which the Earth affords. It is washed by
the two great Oceans; to the Eastward it has the Atlantic, which divides it
from Europe and Africa; to the West, the Pacific or great South Sea, by which
it is separated from Asia: By these Seas it may, and does carry a direct
Commerce with the other three parts of the World.

This great Continent is divided into two parts, one on the North, the other on
the South, which are joined by the Kingdom of Mexico, forming a sort of Isthmus
1500 Miles long, and in one part, at DARI^N, so extremely narrow, as to make
the Cumminication between the two Oceans by no means difficult, being only 60
Miles. In the great Gulf which is formed between the Isthmus and the Northern
and Southern grand divisions of this Continent, lie an infinite multitude of
Islands, many of them large, most of them fertile, and denominated the
West Indies, in contradiction to the Countries and Islands of Asia, beyond the
Cape of Good-Hope, which are called the East Indies. The variety of useful and
entertaining matter a publication of this sort ought to contain, the limits to
which we are confined will not admit of a particular description of all the
Countries contained in this vast Continent.

UNITED STATES.
THE United States of America, under the present government are eleven,
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia. Rhode Island and
North Carolina, no^ having ratified the Federal Constitution.

The Declaration of Independence, by which these States took an equal station
among the nations of the earth, is dated July 4, 1776. The Articles of
Confederation between said States were finally ratified on the first of March,
1781; and the territory granted to them, extends from Canada on the lakes to
Florida; and from the Atlantic Ocean, to the river Missisippi: It is about
fourteen hundred miles in length, from northeast to southwest; and from east to
west, its breadth at the northern extremity, is about twelve hundred miles; but
at the southern, not more than seven hundred.

The northern part of this land is called the Province of Main, and belongs to
the state of Massachusetts.

NEW HAMPSHIRE
Is a tract of land, originially carved out of Massachusetts. It lies on the
south side of the Piscataqua, between the sea and Connecticut river. Its form
is nearly that of a sugar loaf or pyramid, the base of which stretches two
hundred miles on Connecticut river. Is 180 miles in length, and 60 in breadth,
contained, according to an enumeration in 1787, 102,000 inhabitants; situated
between 4^ and 49 degrees North Latitude, and 67 and 72 West Longitude.
Attached to the Federal Government, and engaged in organizing her militia,
already the best disciplined of any in the Union -- encouraging the domestic
arts, and looking forward to the benefits which will result from the operations
of the New Constitution. New Hampshire, from her local advantages, and the
hardihood of her sons, may anticipate essential benefits from the operation of
equal commercial regulations. The principal towns are, Portsmouth, the capital
and seat of government, lying on Piscataway-Bay, where the largest ships may
ride in safety, and Exeter, a fine inland town, which was the seat of
government during the late war.

MASSACHUSETTS
Extends from the ocean on the east, to the bounds of New York on the west; it
has Rhode Island and Connecticut on the south, and New Hampshire and Vermont on
the north; is 450 miles in length, and 160 in breadth* contained, according to
an enumeration in 1787. 360,000 inhabitants; situated between 42 and 45 degrees
North Latitude, and 70 and 73 West Longitude. Since the tranquillity of the
state was restored by the suppression of the late insurrection, the whole body
of the people appear solicitous for the blessings of peace and good government.
If any conclusion can be drawn from elections to the Federal Legislature, this
state has a decided majority in favor of the New Constitution. The great
objects of Commerce, Agriculture, Manufactures, and the Fisheries, appear
greatly to engage the attention of Massachusetts. Fabrications of Cotton,
coarse Woollens, Linens, Duck, Iron, Wood, etc. are prosecuting with success --
and by diminishing her imports, and increasing her exports, she is advancing to
that rank and importance in the Union, which her extent of territory, her
resources, and the genius and enterprise of her citizens entitle her to -- and
although the collision of parties, at the moment of election, strikes out a few
sparks of animosity, yet the decision once made, the "calumet of peace" is
smoked in love and friendship, "and like true republicans they acquiesce in the
choice of the majority." The principal towns are, Boston a large and populous
city, situated on a peninsula, at the bottom of a large bay; it is elegant and
well built, and deservedly called the second town in the United States:
Newbury-Port, a flourishing seaport town; Falmouth, which was burnt by the
English at the beginning of the late war, and rising from its ashes: and
Charleston, which was also laid in ruins, is now entirely rebuilt. A bridge
covering Charles river, leads betwixt Boston and Charleston, is more than 1300
feet in length, and the noblest structure in America. The University at
Cambridge, is the first literary institution on the Continent. Its buildings
are large and elegant -- its literary and philosophical apparatus are the most
complete of any in America.

CONNECTICUT
Is bounded by Rhode Island on the east, by Long Island sound on the south, by
Massachusetts on the north, and New York on the west; is 81 miles in length,
and 57 in breadth, contained, agreeable to a census in 1782, 209,150
inhabitants; situated between 41 and 43 degrees North Latitude, and 73 and 75
West Longitude. Enjoying a fertile soil, this truly republican state is
pursuing her interest in the promotion of Manufactures, Commerce, Agriculture,
and the Sciences -- she appears to bid fair^ from the peaceable, loyal, and
federal character of the great body of her citizens -- from the enterprise of
her men of wealth, and other favorable circumstances, to attain to a great
degree of opulence, power, and respectability in the Union. The principal towns
are. Hartford, a fine inland town on Connecticut river; and New Haven, and
New London, two flourishing Seaport towns.

The inhabitants of New England are mostly the descendents of the first English
settlers; there is no French. Dutch, or Germans, and very few Scotch and Irish.
Including Vermont and Rhode Island (not in the Union) there is almost 10,000
inhabitants.

NEW YORK
Extends from the ocean to Lake Champlain and Canada, and has Connecticut,
Massachusetts, and Vermont on the east, and New Jersey and Pennsylvania on the
West; is 350 miles in length, and 300 in breadth, contained, agreeably to a
census in 1786, 238 897 inhabitants; situate between 40 and 45 degrees North
Latitude, and 74 and 76 West Longitude; enjoying a fertile soil. New York is
now rising greatly in her Federal Character, and in Manufacturing,
Agricultural, and Commercial consequence: Evidenced (...) Federal Elections --
her plans for promoting Manufactures, and the increase of her exports. The
principal towns are, New York, situated on New York island, at the confluence
of the East and North rivers, an elegant and populous city, with an excellent
harbor, now the residence of the Congress of the United States. Hudson, lying
on Hudson's river, navigable for ships of almost any size, about 130 miles from
New York, and Albany a city on the North river, about thirty miles above
Hudson, built by the Dutch, and carries on a great for trade.

Columbia College in the city of New York is well endowed and furnished with
able Professors; and the New York Chamber of Commerce is a very useful
Mercantile Society, instituted for the purposes of promoting and encouraging
Commerce, supporting Industry, and adjusting disputes relative to Trade and
Navigation. They meet once in every month, to transact such business as may
come before them, and establish rules for the order and good government of the
Society. There is also a Marine Society, for the purposes of improving Maritime
knowledge, and for relieving the Wives and Children of deceased Masters of
Vessels, not less worthy of imitation, that meet quarterly.

NEW JERSEY
Has the river Hudson and the ocean on the east, and the Delaware on the west.
It extends from Cape May at the entrance of the Delaware on the south, to the
limits of New York state, west of the Hudson, about twenty miles from the mouth
of that river; is 160 miles in length, and 52 in breadth, contained, by a
census in 1784, 149 435 inhabitants; situated between 30 and 42 degrees North
Latitude, and 74 and 76 West Longitude. The inhabitants of this state are
warmly attached to the New Constitution -- the blessings of peace and good
government, being properly prized by them. The Arts and Sciences are objects of
importance in this state* and many of her sons rank high in the republic of
letters. The principal towns are, Trenton, a flourishing town near the
Delaware; Burlington on the same river, in a healthy situation, enjoying great
commercial privileges; Amboy, a seaport town on Hudson's Bay, well situated
for trade; New-Brunswick a large inland town; and Princeton, a delightful
situation, the seat of a College, called Nassau-Hall, which has produced a
great number of eminent Scholars.

PENNSYLVANIA
Extends from the Delaware on the east, Maryland on the south, New York on the
north, and Virginia and Lake Eri on the west; is 288 miles in length, and 156
in breadth, contained by a census in 1787, 360,000 inhabitants; situated
between 39 and 44 degrees North Latitude, and 75 and 80 West Longitude. This
extensive and truly respectable state is making great proficiency in her
Manufactures. Agriculture, Arts and Commerce. Her attachment to the New
Constitution is unequivocal, and with a consistency highly honorary to her
national character she has lately made an effort (which though defeated for a
time, will undoubtedly be successful) to conform her state constitution to that
of the Union. The principal towns are Philadelphia the largest and most regular
city in America situate on the river Delaware, enjoying an extensive trade, the
University in (...) city, is well endowed with able Professors, as is also the
Protestant Episcopal Academy; and here the Philosophical Society meet in the
house of their President, the immortal Franklin. Carlisle, an inland town,
where a flourish-seminary of learning, called Dickenson College, has been
lately erected; Reading and York, are flourishing boroughs, as are also
Germantown and Bristol; Lancaster, another borough, is the largest inland town
in the United States, where is founded a German College called Franklin, after
its principal benefactor; and Pittsburgh situated on the confluence of the
rivers Alleghany and Monongahela, increases rapidly, and bids fair to be the
Emporium of the Western Country.

DELAWARE
Comprehends three counties only, which extends from Pennsylvania to the
entrance of the river Delaware; is 92 miles in length, and 16 in breadth;
contained, according to a census in 1787, 87,000 inhabitants; situate between
38 and 40 degrees North Latitude, and 76 West Longitude. This state though
circumscribed in its limits* derives great importance from its rank in the
Union; attached to the New Constitution, and having the honor to take the lead
in its adoption, there is no doubt of its giving efficacy to its righteous
administration. The principal towns are Wilmington situate on Christians Greek,
three miles from the Delaware; New Castle, a small town in the country of that
name; Dover, the seat of government, and Newark, where is a seminary of
Learning.

MARYLAND
Is bounded by Pennsylvania on the north, by the ocean on the east, and by
Virginia on the south and west. It is divided into two parts called the eastern
and western shores, by the great bay of Chesapeake; is 134 miles in length, and
110 in breadth, contained by a census in (...) 253,630 inhabitants; situated
between 37 and 40 North Latitude and 75 and 79 West Longitude. From its
favorable situation in the Union, this state bids fair for prosperity, wealth,
and eminence. Warmly attached to the New Constitution, and enjoying a central
situation. The principal towns are, Baltimore, which lies upon an arm of the
Chesapeake, is a flourishing seaport town, which rises in wealth and size with
amazing rapidity; Annapolis, the seat of government, an elegant town on the
river Severn; St. Mary's, which has nothing remarkable but having once been the
capital of the Province; Fredericktown, a fine flourishing inland town; and
George-town, situate at the head of navigation on the river Patowmack seems to
flourish in commercial consequence. They have erected a College upon the
eastern shore, called Washington College, in honor of that illustrious
character. There is also a College to be erected upon the western shore.

VIRGINIA
Is bounded by the Atlantic on the east, by Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the
Ohio, on the north; by the Missisippi and Ohio on the west, and by North
Carolina on the south; is 758 miles in length, and 2^4 in breadth, contained,
by a census in 1782, 567,614 inhabitants; situate between 36 and 40 degrees
North Latitude, and 75 and 90 West Longitude. From the natural ardour of her
sons in the cause of freedom, Virginia is frequently convulsed in her
elections, and has been torn by factions -- Possessing an extensive territory
and vast income, her funds are placed on a respectable footing; and as her
representation in the Federal Legislature, is decidedly in favor of the New
Constitution, there is now no doubt but that she will see her interest and
glory finally connected with a few temporary sacrifices upon the principles of
mutual concession. The principal towns are, Richmond, the seat of government,
situated at the falls of James' river, a flourishing town; Petersburg, a
flourishing town on the Appamattox river; Williamsburg, a fine well built city,
has an University called William and Mary, which is well endowed; Norfolk, a
port with the most commodious harbor in the United States, and the largest
town in Virginia, it was burnt by the English at the beginning of the war in
Virginia; and has now risen from its ashes, and carries on a considerable
trade; Portsmouth, is opposite Norfolk, and enjoys the same privileges;
Alexandria, another port on the Patowmac river, within ten miles of the seat of
the illustrious American hero, General WASHINGTON; Fredericksburg, another town
on the Patowmac; Staunton, a pretty inland town beyond the Alleghany mountains.
Virginia boasts of some of the largest and best rivers in America. On the
north, the Patowmac, which divdes that state from Maryland, rises in the
Allegany mountains, bend (...) course south east and falls into the Chesapeake.
It has eighteen feet water at Alexandria, about one hundred and fifty miles
from its mouth; and ten feet at George-town, eight miles higher. About five
miles above are the falls, which obstruct the navigation for fifteen miles. The
Rappahannock is a small river, but affords twelve feet water to Fredericksburg,
just below the falls. York river furnishes, at York town, a few miles from its
mouth, the best harbor in the state for vessels of a large size. It holds four
fathom water, twenty miles above York town. James' river admits vessels of two
hundred and fifty tons burden to Warwick, and of one hundred and twenty-five
tons to Richmond, about ninety (...) from its mouth. Nansemond and Chickahominy
affords water for small vessels, several miles into the country. Elizabeth
river affords an excellent harbor and large enough for three hundred ships. At
Norfolk it has eighteen feet water at common ^ood tide. The Roanoke runs
through part of Virginia, and is navigable for boats. On the west of the
Allegany mountains are the great and little Kanawa, which rise in the
mountains, and run north-west into the Ohio. -- The Monongahela is one
principal branch of the Ohio. The source of this river is separated from the
Patowmac by the Allegany Ridge. The distance is about forty miles. -- The river
Allegany is the other principal branch of the Ohio. The head of the river is
but fifteen miles distant from Presque Isse on Lake Erie. The rivers
Cumberland, Cherooke, and Kentucky, waters the western part of Virginia,
furnishing navigation for batteaux into the heart of the country. Virginia is
deservedly confessed without all manner of doubt, the most convenient country
in the world for navigation.

'PATOWMAC,' read on the 'RAPPAHANNOCK.'

SOUTH CAROLINA
Has North Carolina on the north, the ocean on the east, Georgia on the south
and Missisippi on the west; is 200 miles in length, and 125 in breadth*
contained by a census in 1787, 180,000 inhabitants; situate between 32 and 35
degrees North Latitude, and 79 and 90 West Longitude; an important member of
the Union, has appeared lately to vibrate between opposing sentiments -- her
attachment to national measures we doubt not will evidently discover itself
when all tender laws and pine barreus shall be done away. The prohibition of
the importation of slaves, and the provision lately made for the reduction of
her foreign debt, to which may be added, the determination of that state to
call a Convention to adopt their state constitution to that of the Union, are
truly Federal traits. The principal towns are. Charleston, the capital and seat
of government, situated at the confluence of the rivers Ashley and Cooper, it
is large and elegant; and Beaufort, another seaport town.

GEORGIA
Is bounded by South Carolina on the north, by the Atlantic on the east; by
East and West Florida on the south, and by Missisipp^ on the west; is 600 miles
in length, and 250 in breadth; contained, according to a census in 1787, 98,000
inhabitants; situated between 30 and 33 degrees North Lat. and 76 and 90 West
Longitude. This state has completed her Federal Character by conforming her
state constitution to that of the Union -- and being the youngest branch of the
Family, and a frontier, she will doubtless experience the supporting and
protecting arm of the Federal Government. The principal towns are, Savannah,
the capital, a fine commercial town on the river of the same name; Sunbury, a
seaport, very well situated for trade; and Augusta, situated at the head of
navigation on the river Savannah, one hundred and thirty four miles from the
sea, is the seat of government.

NORTH CAROLINA

Is bounded by Virginia on the North, the Atlantic on the East, by South
Carolina on the South, and by the Missisippi on the West; is 758 miles in
length, and 110 in breadth; contained, agreeable to a census in 1787, 270,000
inhabitants; situated between 35 and 37 degrees North Latitude, and 76 and 90
West-Longitude. This state has again called a Convention for the purpose of
adopting the New Constitution, nor is there now any doubt that when the mild
yet efficient operations of the New Government, together with the wisdom and
patriotism of the members of the Federal Legislature, are duly considered, it
will remove every doubt of those with whose opinions it may not entirely
coincide; and confirm the expectations of its numerous friends. And her
extensive frontier being obliged to export the greater part of her producttions
through Virginia, there is no doubt, has fully evinced the necessity of her
acceding to the confederation, as a depreciated paper medium is considered as
the principal cause of the anti-national spirit of this state. The principal
towns are, Newbern, Halifax, Edenton, Washington, Fayetteville, Wilmington and
Hilsborough.

RHODE ISLAND
Including the island of that name and Providence Plantations, is bounded on
the North by Massachusetts Bay, on the East by the Atlantic, on the West by
Connecticut, and on the South by the Atlantic; is 68 miles in length, and 40 in
breadth, contained, according to a census in 1783, 51, 896 inhabitants. This
state has refused to accede to a union with her sister states, and is now
almost wholly estranged from them; and from appearance will continue so, unless
the measure of the iniquity of her "know ye" gentry should be speedily filled
up -- or the delusion which has so long infatuated a majority of her citizens,
should be removed -- Anxious of enjoying the protection of the Union, the
inhabitants of Newport, Providence and other places, are determined to sue for
its protection, and to be annexed to Massachusetts or Connecticut. This
dismemberment of the state it is to be desired, may be prevented by her being
wholly graffed into that stock from whence through blindness she has been
broken off. The principal towns are, Newport, the capital, situate on
Rhode Island, which has an excellent harbor; and Providence, situated at the
head of navigation on a large river or arm of the sea, thirty miles from
Newport, at present in a flourishing condition. The business of this state
consists principally in the Whale Fishing and West India trade.

Extracts from the AMERICAN JEST BOOK.
SOME years ago, immediately after the shock of a tremendous earthquake had
alarmed the inhabitants of Grenada, the conversation turned at the governor's
table, upon the latent occasion of the above phenomenon; after every one of
the company had assigned it to a different cause, an old negro woman was asked,
what was her opinion on the subject; she replied, "she thought the great God
was passing by, and the earth had made him a curtesy."

A gentleman met another in the street, who was ill of a consumption, and
accosted him thus -- "Ah! my friend, you walk exceedingly flow" -- "Yes
(replied the sick man) but I am going very fast."

A gentleman and his man riding into the country, they met a fellow astride
upon a cow. The man calls cut to his master, O, sir, says he* yonder is a
strange sight! a fellow is on horseback on a cow. That Is a bull said the
gentleman. Nay, sir, said the man, it is not a bull, I know it is a cow by its
teats.

A person bought a pair of horns and brought them home; his wife asked what he
meant? he said to hang his hat on. Good lord* says she, cannot you keep your
hat on your own head?

Colonel Bond, who had been one of king Charles the first's judges died a day
or two before Cromwell, and it was strongly reported every where, that the
protector was dead; "No" says a gentleman, who knew better, "he has only given
bond to the devil for his future appearance."

If you marry (said a father to his daughter) you will do well; if you do not
marry, you will do better. If that is the case, replied the daughter, "get me a
husband as soon as you can, I shall be content to do well, and leave it to
others to do better."

A judge, suspected of bribery, checked his clerk, for having a dirty face. I
plead guilty, my lord, said the clerk, but my hands are clean.

The following example of laudable pride in a soldier, was mentioned in a
letter from an officer of the American army, written soon after the battle of
Monmouth. -- A soldier in that memorable action, fell into the hands of the
English cavalry, when one of them knocked him down, and attempted to pierce him
through the back with his sword, -- "Strike me in the heart," said he, turning
briskly about "that my friends may not blush for me after my death."

An honest clergyman in the country was reproving a married couple for their
frequent dissensions, which were very unbecoming both in the eye of God and
man, seeing that you are both one; Both one! cried the husband, were you to
come by our door sometimes when we quarrel, you would swear we were twenty.

A soldier in the late war having stolen a shirt from a farmer, to whom he
would not make restitution -- "Well, (said the farmer) if you keep it, you will
pay for it in this world or in the next. -- "Faith, (replied the soldier) if
you will trust so long, I will take another."

An honest Jack Tar being at a quaker's meeting, heard the friend that was
holding forth speak with great emotion, against the ill consequence of giving
the lie in conversation, and therefore he advised, when a man was telling a
tale, that was not consistent with truth or probability, to cry twang, which
would not irritate the passions as the lie would. After digressing into the
story of the great miracle of five thousand being fed with five loaves of bread
etc he told them that they were not such loaves as are used now, but were as
big as a mountain; at the hearing of which the tar uttered with a loud voice,
twang! What, says the quaker, do thou think I lie, friend? No, says Jack, but
I am thinking how big the ovens were that baked them.

Two gentlemen having a dispute about religion, one said to the other, I
wonder, sir, you should talk of religion, when I Will hold you ten guineas you
cannot say the Lord's Prayer. Done said the other. The money was deposited and
the gentleman began with, I believe in God, and so went cleverly through the
creed: Well said the other, I own I have lost; I did not think he could have
done it.

Dr. Sheridan* the celebrated friend of Swift, had a custom of ringing his
scholars to prayers in his school room, at a certain hour every day. The boys
were one day very devoutly at prayers except one, who was stifling a laugh as
well as he could; which arose from seeing a rat descending from the bell-rope
into the room. The poor boy could hold out no longer, but burst into an
immoderate fit of laughter, which set the others agoing when he pointed to the
cause. Sheridan was so provoked, that he declared he would whip them all if the
principal culprit was not pointed out to him; which was immediately done. The
poor pupil of Momus was immediately hoisted, and his posteriors laid bare to
the rod, when the witty schoolmaster told him, if he said any thing tolerable
on the occasion, as he looked on him as the greatest dunce in his school, he
would forgv^ him. The trembling culprit, with very little hesitation addressed
his master with the following beautiful distich: There was a rat -- for want of
stairs,
Came down a rope -- to go to prayers.
Sheridan instantly dropped the rod, and instead of a whipping gave him half a
crown.

with the advice and consent of the SENATE, to appoint,

RECIPES.
FOR A COLD IN THE HEAD.
PAIR very thin the yellow Rind of an Orange. Roll it up inside out, and thrust
a roll into each nostril.

FOR CONSUMPTIVE COMPLAINTS.
TAKE an eaqual quantity of White Pitch, or rosin, and yellow beeswax, and
dissolve them over a fire. The room, in which the fumegation is to be performed
ought to be closely shut up, and the person should walk about to suck in the
vapor by degrees.

FOR THE DROPSY.
TAKE one ounce of Saltpeter, and dissolve it in a pint of cold Water, of
which take a wine glass full every morning and evening. About five or six
ounces used in this manner, will generally perfect a cure.

FOR THE GOUT.
THE following prescription for the Gout in the Stomach, is translated from a
Recipe by the celebrated Dr. Hartley, and has been taken with great success by
several persons afflicted with that disorder; "Take Cardiac Confection, a
dram and a half; Aromatic Spices, the same quantity; Syrup of Ginger, six
drachms; Orange-Peel water, two ounces; simple Cinnamon water, six ounces; make
a mixture, of which take three table spoonfuls occasionally."

FOR THE MEASLES. This distemper is always preceded by a violent cough, often
fourteen days before the red spots come out.

DRINK only thin Water Gruel, or Milk and Water, the more the better; or Toast
and Water. If the cough be very troublesome, take frequently a spoonful of
Barley-Water sweetened with Oil of sweet Almonds newly drawn, mixed with syrup
of Maidenhair. After the Measles, for some weeks, take care of catching cold,
use light diet, and drink Barley-Water instead of Malt drink,

Sir WALTER RAWLEIGH's Letter to his Wife, after his condemnation.
"YOU shall receive, my dear wife, my last words in these my last lines. My
love I send you that you may keep when I am dead; and my counsel, that you may
remember when I am no more. I would not with my will, present you sorrows, dear
Bess; let them go to the grave with me, and be buried in the dust; and seeing
that it is not the will of God that I shall see you any more, bear my
destruction patiently; and with an heart like yourself. First I send you all
the thanks, which my heart can conceive, or my words express, for your many
travels and cares for me; which though they have not taken effect, as you
wished, yet my debt to you is not the less; but pay it I never shall in the
world. Secondly, I beseech you, for the love you (...) me living, that you do
not hide yourself many days; but by your travels seek to help my miserable
fortunes, and the right of your poor child; your mourning cannot avail me who
am but dust. Thirdly, you shall understand that my lands were conveyed
(bonafide) to my child; the writings were drawn at midsummer was a twelve
month, as diverse can witness; and I trust, my blood will quench their malice,
who desired my slaughter, that they will not seek to kill you and yours with
extreme poverty. To what friend to direct you, I know not: for all mine have
left me in the true time of trial. Most sorry am I, that being surprised by
death, I can leave you no better estate; God has prevented all my
determinations, that great God, which works all in all. If you can live free
from want, care for no more; for the rest is but a vanity. Love God, and begin
betimes; in him shall you find true, everlasting and endless comfort; when you
have traveled, and wearied yourself with all sorts of wordly cogitations, you
shall sit down with sorrow in the end. Teach your son also to serve and fear
God, whilst he is young, that

the fear of God may grow up in him; then will God be an husband to you, and a
father to him; an husband and a father that shall never be taken from you. Dear
wife, I beseech you for my soul's sake, ^ay all poor men, when I am dead, no
doubt you will be much sought unto; for the world thinks I was very rich: Have
a care of the fair pretenses of men; for no greater misery can befall you in
this life, than to become a prey unto the world, and after to be despised. As
for me, I am no more yours, nor you mine; death has cut us asunder; and God
has divided me from the world, and you from me. Remember your poor child, for
his father's sake, who loved you in his happiest estate. I sued for my life,
but (God knows) it was for you and yours, that I desired it; for know it, my
dear wife, your child, is the child of a true man, who in his own respect
despises death, and his misshapen and ugly forms. I cannot write much; God
knows, how hardly I steal this time, when all are asleep: And it is also time
for me to separate my thoughts from the world. Beg my dead body, which living
was denied you; and either lay it in Sherburne, or Exeter Church, by my father
and mother. I can say no more; time and death call me away. The everlasting
God, powerful, infinite and inscrutable, God Almighty, who is goodness itself,
the true light and life, keep you and yours, and have mercy upon me, and
forgive my persecutors, and false accusers; and send us to meet in his glorious
Kingdom. My dear wife, farewell; bless my boy, pray for me: and let my true God
hold you both in his arms.

Yours that was, but not now my own, WALTER RAWLEIGH.

ANECDOTE.
A very pious Gentleman, but rather worldly, who lives not many miles from
Boston, made it his constant practice to call up his family before day, in
order that they might attend prayers and be ready for their labor in good
season: One morning having mustered his family rather earlier than common, he
commenced family duties by prayer, during which he returned thanks to the Lord,
that they were brought to see the light of another day: an old negro standing
by, cried out, "Top, top, vate a bit, no day yet, massa, sartin, no day yet."

BLESSED be the man who early proved
And first contrived to make it clear
That Time upon a dial moved,
And traced that circle called a year;
Ere he arose, the savage, man,
No Almanacks nor seasons knew,
On Nature's book his reckoning ran,
And social festivals were few.
Peace, over the world thy wings expand,
And, Science, bless our favored land.
