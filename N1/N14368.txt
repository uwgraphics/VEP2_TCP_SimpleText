A DISCOURSE, etc.
FRIENDS AND FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN,
WHILE I vent the fullness of my heart in the sincerest congratulations of you
and myself, and our common country, on the arrival of the auspicious day, which
gives confirmed Sovereignty and Independence to confederate America, and pours
into her bosom the blessings of a safe, advantageous, honorable PEACE, the
charms of which are vastly heightened and endeared to us by the horrid contrast
of an eight years' cruel War; -- permit me at the same time to remind you, that
the professed design of this solemn assembly should give a religious direction
to our common joy, and consecrate it into the liveliest gratitude to that
SUPREME POWER, who at once styles himself a MAN OF WAR, and the GOD OF PEACE.
That the rapture of our hearts on so glorious an occasion may be thus guided
into a holy channel, and elevated into a pious transport of God-exalting
adoration and thanksgiving -- let us turn our contemplations to a noble pattern
of this kind in the grateful, exulting Jews, on their liberation from the
Babylonish captivity, as we have it exhibited in the 126 PSALM, 3 first Verses.
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said
they among the Heathen, the Lord has done great things for them. The Lord has
done great things for us, whereof we are glad.

AS the deliverance here celebrated by the church of God, was the most
illustrious of any in the Old Testament annals, and a most remarkable type of
our spiritual redemption by the Messiah; as many of its leading circumstances
bear a striking similarity to those which have distinguished and dignified the
salvation of united America; and as their sentiments and acknowledgments upon
it are such as remarkably suit and become every American heart and tongue on
the present occasion; -- let us therefore run over the affecting picture, which
they themselves give of the matter in the words now read: -- in which they
relate in the first place the pleasing, overwhelming SURPRISE that seized
their minds on first receiving the glorious tidings -- "When the Lord turned
again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream" -- As if they had
said, -- "The deliverance was so great and glorious in itself, so astonishing
in its circumstances, so sudden in its accomplishment, so unexpected and
improbable in every human view, so far above our highest ideas and hopes, so
opposite to our just deserts and apprehensions -- that we could scarce credit
the testimony of our own senses, and were ready to imagine the news of liberty
no better than the pleasing dream of a transported, deluded fancy, or the airy,
baseless fabric of a midnight vision." So Peter, when a celestial messenger
knocked off his prison-chains, and brought him forth to liberty, was at first
so surprised at the sudden, extraordinary deliverance, that he could not
believe it to be a waking reality, but only a visionary picture painted on his
imagination. -- And doubtless the first ideas and feelings of many an American
heart, on the news of the equitable, liberal treaty of peace, ratified between
Britain and these Sovereign States, were nearly coincident with this
description: -- for, the improbability of the haughty Monarch and Court of
Britain's ever submitting, (at least at present,) to such mortifying
concessions, especially of their adopting so generous a system of policy, so
contradictory to the narrow, deceitful, underhanded, cruel politics, which,
before, they had uniformly pursued toward this country; -- the disappointment
of our sanguine prospects of pacification, in some former stages of this
contest; -- the long continuance of our distresses; -- the visible growing
degeneracy and wickedness of America, under the judgments of Heaven, sent and
so long continued for her correction and reformation* -- these, and many other
discouraging ideas, combined their influence to render the glorious tidings of
peace a very surprising, unexpected, overwhelming sound in the ears of many
sober Americans -- a sound too grand, good, joyful, to gain their ready
confident belief -- "Their rapture seemed a pleasing dream, the grace appeared
so great."

"Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing" -- The
surprise of such a deliverance produced an ecstasy of joy; so that we could
scarce restrain our passions or our tongues within the bounds of decency or
decorum. "Then said they among the Heathen, the Lord has done great things for
them." Those Heathen neighbors, who had observed and insulted the distressed,
abject state of these captive exiles, were now constrained to own the
superintending, triumphant power, wisdom and goodness of Jehovah, in their
surprising deliverance -- in rescuing his feeble Israel out of the hands of
their mighty oppressors, when they were without friends, without resources,
without any enlivening hope or spirit -- in raising up for them in this
situation, and effecting their instant deliverance by a most unlikely
instrument indeed, a Pagan, idolatrous Monarch, a stranger and an enemy both by
nation and religion, the King of that very empire, which held them in servitude
as its legal, conquered captives, and esteemed and treated them as the lowest
dregs of mankind! -- that such a Prince, without any human solicitation,
without, yea, contrary to, any of the usual motives of human policy, should
proclaim the remains of poor, oppressed Israel, a free and independent nation,
and furnish them, out of his own treasures, with every requisite for the
re-establishment and secure enjoyment of their ancient privileges in their own
land -- this was such a spectacle of divine wonders in behalf of that people,
as extorted a confession from the most stupid idolaters, that Jehovah, the God
of Israel, was far superior to their idol-deities. -- Just so, my brethren, the
successful struggles of oppressed America, at first a feeble, naked, friendless
infant, against the gigantic power of Britain, a nation then respectable and
terrible to all the world for military prowess, strength and glory, -- have
displayed an august spectacle of divine manifestations in our favor, which
commands the admiring attention of the world -- All Europe, whether Popish or
Protestant, Christian or Infidel, has beheld the advancing stages of this
contest with growing astonishment: -- and while our wonderful success has given
a luster and dignity to our national character in the eyes of mankind, I doubt
not but all sober observers, and, one would think, all that are not abandoned
Atheists, are constrained to say, the Lord has done great things for America.
Even the poor Indian savages around us, could make this remark on some great
victory or deliverance granted to our pious, praying fathers -- "Your God must
be a very great and good Spirit, to hear and answer your prayers in so
surprising a manner!" -- If then Heathens, idolaters and scoffers are compelled
to own a Superior Hand in these great events, with what eager, grateful
transport should those, in whose behalf they are wrought, reply as in the next
verse -- "The Lord has done great things for us, whereof we are glad" -- He
has done great things FOR US -- Our Heathen neighbors are only cool
spectators, but we are the feeling, happy subjects of the surprising mercy --
"whereof we are glad": -- our neighbors are struck with amazement, and some of
them filled with rage and vexation; but we are filled with grateful joy -- a
joy proportioned to the greatness of the blessing, and the evidence we have
that it flows from a God that is reconciled, and in friendship with his now
penitent, purified, reformed Israel. -- As I mean to make the pious ascription
in this third verse, the principal basis of the ensuing part of my discourse, I
shall accordingly attempt to show,

FIRST, When the interpositions of Jehovah in favor of his people may be
styled great, or what it is that stamps them with this high character: which
will naturally bring into view the principal events which have introduced and
established the American revolution. And then,

SECONDLY, Point out and enforce the manner, in which the happy subjects of
such great divine manifestations, should entertain and improve them.

Respecting the FIRST HEAD, I would premise, that all the works of Jehovah are
great, as being the products and displays of infinite perfection, and designed
and adapted to some very grand and excellent end: -- particularly, all his acts
of kindness to any of our fallen species, are the fruits of a benevolence
infinitely great, prompting and cooperating with equal knowledge and power.
But though all God's benevolent works are in this respect equal, as proceeding
from the same efficient and impulsive Cause, yet the effects hereof, as
terminating upon, and displaying the divine goodness and other attributes to
the view of the creature, are almost infinitely diversified: and in this view,
some of the kind dispensations of Heaven are vastly, unspeakably greater than
others. For instance, those fruits of divine goodness, which have a very great
intrinsic worth -- which carry in them a deliverance, or security from very
great and terrible evils, and a complication of many positive blessings --
which promise very durable advantages, or draw after them a long series of
beneficial consequences -- which embrace great numbers of persons as
joint-sharers in the important benefit -- which triumph over mighty obstacles
that lie in their way -- which are conferred in an uncommon, unexpected,
sudden, improbable, or peculiarly seasonable manner; -- such operations or
effects of divine goodness, may be styled great in an emphatical and most
glorious sense. There was a signal concurrence of many of these heightening
circumstances attending the liberation of the Jewish captives celebrated in the
text. But the divine manifestations in favor of these United States, in which
we this day rejoice, are eminently marked with all these dignifying characters
-- For the benefits granted, possess a vast intrinsic (...) no less than
INDEPENDENT LIBERTY, both civil and religious; the confirmed power of choosing
our own government and worship, of enacting our own laws, of acquiring and
enjoying our own property, of regulating and extending our own commerce, and,
in a word, of securely and peaceably enjoying the most valuable temporal
blessings and spiritual privileges, in the greatest and best country in the
world! Will any son or daughter of America, in the view of these precious
gifts, now ratified to us by Heaven, venture to speak in a contemptuous or
murmuring tone, of the issue of our long struggle with Tyranny, as if we had
reaped no other harvest from it, than the loss of a great deal of our choicest
blood, and an insupportable weight of debt and of taxes for many years to come?
-- But what, my friends, are these sacrifices and inconveniences, compared with
those terrible evils, from which Heaven, by this conflict, has delivered and
secured us? -- compared with unconditional submission to a foreign legislature
in all cases whatsoever, which was expressly demanded by the British
Parliament, and attempted to be enforced by the whole military power of the
nation -- a demand, which, at one stroke, annihilated the very foundation of
liberty in this country, and placed her in the lowest, basest state of
vassalage, without leaving to her the least right or property in any instance
whatever! And as complete servitude must have been the immediate effect of a
passive, non-resisting submission to this despotic claim; so if Heaven had
permitted them to seduce or conquer us into this subjection, after resisting
them with our arms, the consequences must have been still more insupportably
dreadful: -- for a conquest would at once have made the Court of Britain both
lords and landlords of this whole continent: and while our principal leaders,
in the cabinet and field, would have been doomed to the block, or the gallows,
the rest of us, with our children, down perhaps to late posterity, must have
been humble, cringing tenants and slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water,
to the haughty minions of British power! Let us seriously contemplate, my
brethren, these tremendous evils, which we had so much reason to fear, together
with those we have actually felt from the disappointed ambition and cruelty of
our foes: -- let our thoughts take a range through their polluted prison-ships,
and other murderous places of confinement, which have slain so many of our
deserving sons -- let us visit the many populous towns wantonly consumed, with
the vast amount of property pillaged or destroyed, by their hands, with the
many other traces of a base, vindictive spirit, which has marked their conduct
toward us: -- let us cast a retrospective eye on the many awful scenes of
blood and carnage, of havoc and depredation, with the long train of evils,
both natural and moral, which compose War's gloomy retinue; -- and then say,
whether that event which puts a period to all these distresses, perils, and
fears, which anchors our political ship in the harbor of security and peace,
after having so long encountered the rage of so tempestuous a sea, -- is not a
very great and capital mercy of Heaven! -- a mercy unspeakably enhanced and
sweetened by the long and gloomy scenes of trouble which have preceded and
introduced it! -- A mercy too of a very complicated kind, not only as it saves
us from such a complication of evils, but as it carries in its bowels, or
naturally draws after it, a long chain of important positive blessings, of
extensive and permanent advantages. -- For besides the usual sweets and
benefits of peace, accompanied with freedom, in the full scope and animating
encouragement it gives to industry, to arts, to science, to every noble,
advantageous employment, improvement, and gratification of life -- besides
these, the peaceful establishment of our liberty and independence opens to us
far more extensive and glorious prospects -- it presents us with a fair
opportunity, with the noblest inducements and advantages, for converting this
immense northern continent into a seat of knowledge and freedom, of agriculture
and commerce, of useful arts and manufactures, of Christian piety and virtue,
and thus making it an inviting and comfortable abode for many millions of the
human species, an asylum for the injured and oppressed in all parts of the
globe, the delight of God and good men, the joy and praise of the whole earth,
soaring on the wings of literature, wealth, population, religion, virtue, and
every thing that is excellent and happy, to a greater height of perfection and
glory than the world has ever yet seen. -- It likewise opens a door for an
extensive commercial intercourse between us and all nations, and directly leads
to a rapid increase of it among the various parts of the world: which is not
only an inexhaustible source of wealth and opulence, but tends to expand the
human mind, to introduce a reciprocation of good offices and benefits, "a
general knowledge of wants, and the means of supplying them, an experimental
acquaintance with the necessity and beauty of hospitality, an universal
enlargement of the habits of thinking," more rational ideas and a more liberal
administration of civil government, a better knowledge and relish of the sacred
rights of humanity; all which directly conduce to humanize, refine, and exalt
the human mind and manners, and carry forward mankind to greater perfection and
happiness than have yet been attained. -- Our late convulsion, with its present
happy termination, tends to wake up and encourage the dormant flame of liberty
in all quarters of the earth; to rouse up an oppressed, enslaved world from
that stupor which has so long benumbed it -- to rouse it to a due inquiry into
the natural rights of men, and its own disgraceful and wretched situation in
tamely submitting to the deprivation of them; to open the eyes of kings and
subjects to the true principles of liberty and justice, and to the absurdity
and iniquity of tyranny and persecution in all their forms; and thus to lead
mankind to a manly assertion, and a happy recovery and re-establishment of
their civil and religious rights; and hereby open and prepare their minds for
the more easy reception of the truth and grace of the gospel. -- Accordingly,
every wheel of Providence seems to be now in motion to hasten on the downfall of
tyranny, of Popish superstition and bigotry, and promote the cause of freedom,
knowledge and truth: -- The destruction of the whole order of the Jesuits, who
were the main prop of the Papal power; the abolition of persecution in many
European countries, particularly in France, where the present truly great and
generous Monarch has placed the Protestants on an equal footing with his other
subjects; and in Germany, where liberty of conscience is granted to all
peaceable subjects, of every denomination; the downfall of the hellish
Inquisition in Spain, and the liberal institutions which begin to take place in
that country, so remarkable, hitherto, for a blind, narrow, furious,
persecuting bigotry; the secret contempt, in which almost all the learned and
more knowing, in Popish countries, are said to hold the absurdities and
fooleries of that religion; the rapid progress of knowledge, and a spirit of
free inquiry, of late years, over the earth; -- these and other similar events
form a grand chain of Providence, in which the American Revolution is a
principal link -- a chain, which is gradually drawing after it the most
glorious consequences to mankind; which is hastening on the accomplishment of
the scripture-prophecies relative to the Millenial State, the golden age of the
church and world in the latter days. -- How magnificently great do the works of
Jehovah toward America appear, when viewed in this light! What complicated,
extended, lasting advantages seem to be wrapped up in them, not only to many
millions in this Western World, but to countless multitudes, as we trust, in
various parts of the globe!

If we go on to apply the other characters of greatness enumerated above,
relating to the manner in which divine favors are conferred, or deliverances
wrought, we find them all emphatically verified in God's gracious
manifestations toward America. For was it not a very uncommon, unexpected,
unlikely spectacle, to see Heaven not only raise up and inspirit as it were an
infant from its cradle, to encounter a mighty, armed giant, but to guide, aid,
and succeed its untaught, feeble efforts, and infatuate, confound, baffle its
boasting, terrible antagonist, in a manner almost unparalleled in the annals of
the word? Was it not an extraordinary phenomenon in the political world, for so
many distinct and distant states, so different in many respects in their
education, laws, customs, manners, prejudices, and interests, -- not only to
unite in one common cause, but to preserve and even strengthen their union
amidst all the serpentine, unwearied artifices of a subtle enemy to divide
them; insomuch that the very measures they took to disunite and destroy us,
have uniformly operated to defeat their own designs and expectations? Was it
not a very unusual spectacle, to see so young a country produce such a number
of able, spirited statesmen and commanders, whose abilities and patriotism,
whose equally judicious and vigorous measures, have at once saved their own
country, and commanded the admiration and applause of the world? The late
celebrated Lord Chatham, speaking of our first general Congress, gives them
this very honorable testimony -- "I must declare and avow, that in all my
reading and observation, for solidity of reasoning, force of sagacity, and
wisdom of conclusion, no nation or body of men can stand in preference to the
general Congress at Philadelphia." And if we turn our eyes from the cabinet to
the camp, what an assemblage of wonders rises to view in our illustrious
military CHIEF! -- A General destined by Heaven for just such a period,
country, and cause as ours! -- whose judiciously cautious, defensive, delaying
mode of conducting this war, has at once saved his own army and country, and
weakened and worn down those of the enemy: -- a General, whose character
combines all the different qualities of coolness and spirit, consummate
prudence and proportionate vigor, the most generous tenderness and compassion
joined with the most firm, undaunted heroism, the most patient, unshaken
constancy under heavy discouragements and sufferings, joined with a noble
spirit of enterprise on all proper occasions! My friends, while we contemplate
this great character, placed at the head of our unexperienced forces, at such a
critical, seasonable juncture: -- when we survey the bright constellation of
heroes under him, the subordinate officers and soldiers, whose hardships,
toils, dangers, battles, victories -- whose triumphant patience, courage, and
perseverance, have instrumentally procured the blessings in which we now
rejoice: -- when we travel over the several bright stages of this contest, from
the bloody, yet victorious NINETEENTH OF APRIL, 1775, to the ever-memorable
preservation of our young troops, and destruction of the veteran foe, at the
battle of Bunker-hill; the brilliant, magnificent attacks and victories of
Trenton and Princeton; the glorious capture of two whole British armies at
Saratoga and Yorktown; the very critical detection and defeat of Arnold's black
conspiracy, by a train of nice and seemingly fortuitous incidents: -- when to
all this we add, the astonishing magnanimity, generosity, and fidelity of the
KING of France, the Cyrus of our Israel, whose paternal, liberal, effectual
aid, afforded to us in our low estate, so remarkably resembles the conduct of
that ancient, noble Prince, whom Heaven inspired, though an alien from their
religion, to proclaim and effect the great deliverance celebrated by God's
Israel in the text: -- when we further behold the top-stone of this grand
fabric laid, in the ratification of a treaty of peace, which establishes our
unconditional independence, enlarges our territories, and gratifies our highest
expectations and wishes: -- and lastly, when we reflect on the ill-deserving,
provoking character of the people, in a moral view, for whom Jehovah has
wrought all these wonders; -- are we not constrained to own with raptures of
grateful admiration, that the Lord has indeed done great things for us -- that
his perfections have triumphed gloriously in our favor, -- have triumphed not
only over all the hostile attempts of our foes, but over all our own increasing
and crying guilt?

What then remains but that we suitably entertain and improve these astonishing
and endearing divine manifestations in our favor? Which is the SECOND THING to
be illustrated and enforced.

It becomes us then, in the first place, to ascribe the whole glory of them to
God, in imitation of the pious pattern of the text. This is nothing more than
rendering to Jehovah his due: -- this is a debt, which every sacred motive,
every ingenuous principle, every tie of gratitude, decency, and equity,
forcibly urges us to pay. For, sound reason, as well as revelation, teaches us,
that all the abilities, prowess, conduct and success, which have guided and
crowned our long conflict, have been derived from above -- from the same Being,
who raised up Moses to lead his Israel from their Egyptian bondage, and Cyrus
to emancipate them from their Babylonian servitude. It was therefore a very
foolish, as well as impious speech of an European commander in a former war,
that Providence always favors an hundred thousand men; meaning, that
notwithstanding the influence of Providence, the strongest army may be sure of
success: -- for there are a thousand contingencies, which essentially affect
the health, supplies, counsels, courage, operations and success of an army,
which no human sagacity can foresee, or human power control, but which are
wholly determined by an omniscient, omnipotent Providence. To the God of
providence then let us cousecrate the gladness of this happy day -- let us
return back to him, in devout ascriptions of praise, that full tide of joy,
which He is pouring into our hearts -- let us say, in the language of
inspiration, -- "I will sing unto the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously"
-- "O sing unto the Lord a new song; for his right hand, and his holy arm has
gotten the victory" -- "The Lord reigns; let America -- let the earth
rejoice: let the multitude of the isles be glad thereof."

But while we religiously adore the governing providence of Jehovah, and
gratefully ascribe to him all those great events which swell our bosoms with
joy; let us beware that we do not impute these signal divine appearances in our
favor, to any peculiar excellence in our national character. Alas, Sirs, the
moral face of our country effectually confutes such a vainglorious sentiment.
Crimes of the blackest hue -- countless multitudes of abominations, mark the
visible character of this great, this highly favored community, and still
provoke the displeasure of Heaven; while they serve as a foil to heighten and
set off the triumphant freeness and riches of that goodness which has done such
great things for so unworthy a people: as on the other hand, the turpitude and
guilt of our national provocations are exceedingly enhanced by those glorious
manifestations of divine benevolence, against which they are committed. The
present occasion then loudly calls us to mingle the most humble penitence and
contrition with our joyful gratitude and praise: and, indeed, there can be no
truly grateful and holy joy in the goodness of God, without true humility,
repentance, and reformation, for its foundation, companion, and fruit: for
humble, godly sorrow, and thankful joy, mutually beget, and strengthen, and
keep pace with each other; and no people, however highly favored in external
respects, have any sure ground or warrant, or indeed any present moral capacity
or meetness, for the exercise of true rejoicing in the divine goodness, while
persisting in an impenitent course of rebellion against Him. These
considerations call upon us to rejoice with trembling, with humility, with a
sober, cautious, serious air, in opposition to all levity, pride, vainglory,
sensuality, carnal confidence and security. While we rejoice in the divine
beneficence, let us remember that for his own sake he has done these great
things; not for any righteousness in us; not merely that we might enjoy the
exultation of victory and peace, or the pride of independence and empire; but
that his own name may be exalted, that his own great designs, hinted above, of
glorifying Himself, and extending the kingdom of his Son, may be carried into
effect: and though he has been using us in the late revolution as instruments
of carrying forward this glorious and benevolent plan, yet if we ourselves mean
not so, -- if in our hearts and practice we are opposed to his interest and
glory -- if we as a people continue to fight against Him, after such great
displays as he has made of Himself before our eyes -- if we abuse the blessings
of returning peace and public felicity to greater wantonness in sin, to nourish
a spirit of pride, ambition, luxury, dissipation, venality, infidelity, and
other concomitant vices; in this case our very prosperity will finally destroy
us in the most aggravated manner; and God will promote the designs of his glory
in our exemplary ruin, as he has now been doing in our surprising salvation. --
These ideas may well give a solemnity to our joy, and cause it to flow in the
channel, and bring forth the fruits, of true holiness. O let us exhibit our
praises, not in word only, but in deed and in truth: let us testify the cordial
sincerity of our joys and thanksgivings on this occasion, by a practical,
steady conformity and obedience to that great and good Being, whom we profess
to extol: and let me add, by generous testimonies of our esteem and gratitude
for those, whose toils, dangers, and sufferings have eminently contributed to
our present security and happiness -- let our grateful love to the infinite
Author, flow down and flow out, in suitable proportions, to the honored
instruments of these inestimable benefits. Let those men who have stood forth
in the foremost rank of danger, and made the greatest private sacrifices to the
public cause, whether in the senate or in the field, whether at home or in
foreign climes, -- let these live in our hearts -- let their names and heroic
deeds live and shine in our grateful annals, till time shall be swallowed up in
eternity. Let us be eager to recompense their important labors of love for us
and our children, for the unborn millions of our future descendants. Let us
welcome the suffering soldier to the bosom of a free and peaceful country, with
tears of gratitude, and smiles of applause -- let us gladly divide with him
those sweets of independence and wealth, which his gallantry and wounds have
secured to us. Let us fly to sooth the griefs, and wipe away the tears of the
many widows and orphans, which this cruel war has made; and to relieve the
mortifying distresses of poverty, into which it has plunged many of our
meritorious citizens. Let us gladly contribute our share toward fulfilling the
engagements of the public, to all that have credited or in any way assisted it,
whether our own citizens or foreigners: and instead of complaining of the load
of debt which lies upon us, let us bless God, that the great object of our long
struggle is obtained at so cheap a rate; -- that our burden, however pressing,
is light, compared either with the value of the acquisition or with the
insupportable load which must have fallen upon us, and crushed us into ruin,
had we been reunited to Great Britain: -- let us be willing to sacrifice the
paltry, yet expensive pleasures and parade of luxury, prodigality, vain
magnificence, and other impoverishing, though fashionable vices, and practice
frugality, industry, humility, and moderation, with the whole train of private
and patriotic virtues: then, by the blessing of God, we may hope that our
country will ere long be delivered from every embarrassing difficulty, which
retards her progress toward the zenith of perfection, and will become an ample
theater for the last and most glorious displays of the divine benevolence to
the human species. Who, that loves his country or mankind, can help exulting in
so glorious a prospect, and wishing to see it speedily realized? That it may be
so, --

O Thou, GREAT ARBITER of the nations, who have done such great things for us,
still guard, maintain, and perfect the magnificent structure, which thy own
hand has reared in this western world! Grant that here may ever dwell the
uncorrupted faith, the pure worship, the benevolent, peaceful virtues of
primitive Christianity, extending their benign influences to the utmost bounds
of this vast continent, and causing the wilderness and waste places of America
to blossom like the rose, and flourish as the garden of God! May this
infant-empire, this newborn nation live in thy sight! May it grow and flourish
under thy almighty patronage, in every thing that is great and good and happy,
till all the states and empires of the world shall be absorbed in the
everlasting kingdom of thy Son! AMEN and AMEN.

A HYMN, Composed for, and sung on the Occasion -- and now published by Desire
-- entitled, A SONG of PRAISE to GOD from UNITED AMERICA.
1.
FROM all below these western skies
Let shouts of grateful joy arise; --
This newborn empire sound abroad
The honors of its GUARDIAN-GOD.
2.
Let our GRAND COUNCIL lead the song,
And roll the tide of praise along,
Till the fair current spread around,
From GEORGIA's banks to HAMPSHIRE's bound.
3.
When Britain, great in arts and arms,
Poured on our coasts war's dire alarms,
And mustered all her thundering power,
To crush our glory in an hour: --
4.
Our GOD with scorn her rage beheld; --
His own kind arm became our shield; --
Confusion on her plots he frowned,
And shook her Babel to the ground.
5.
Let LEXINGTON proclaim afar
The honors of the God of war;
While BUNKER-HILL and TRENTON join
To hail the guardianship divine.
6.
Let captur'd Burgoyne tell abroad
The triumphs of COLUMBIA's God;
While baffled Arnold owns the Power,
Which saved us in the dreadful hour.
7.
Let proud Cornwallis bend the knee
Unto the GOD of victory,
Who snatched the laurels he had won,
And gave them up to WASHINGTON.
8.
Hail, POWER SUPREME! whose outstretch'd hand
Has saved our threat'ned infant-land,
And led it through war's bloody race,
To glorious EMPIRE, FREEDOM, PEACE.
9.
While we beneath our fig trees sit,
And of thy riches taste the sweet,
O may our flaming hearts and tongues
Shout forth thy praise in endless songs.
