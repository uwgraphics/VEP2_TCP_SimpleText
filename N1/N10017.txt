THE CONQUEST OF CANADA: OR, THE SIEGE OF QUEBEC.

AN HISTORICAL TRAGEDY, OF FIVE ACTS.

BY GEORGE COCKINGS, AUTHOR OF WAR: AN HEROIC POEM.

ALBANY: PRINTED by ALEXANDER and JAMES ROBERTSON, at their PRINTING OFFICE in
PEARL-STREET. M,DCC,LXXIII.

TO THE PUBLIC.
ALTHOUGH the undertaking is great and ar^uous. for a person in my situation of
life (...) assi^ted, to dare attempt the sole c^m^osi^ion of a Tragedy; yet I
was incited to the ^ask, by ruminating on a rapid, and alm^st unin^e^rupted
series of success, in 1^59. and the great and ever memorable year of 1^58, etc.
the glorious ^ffect^ of the amicable and happy uni^n, which subsi^ted between
our gallant troops, and intrepid ^ars; who* with a true spirit of martial
bravery and emulation (never to be ou^done, or equalled ag^in, but by
themselves) ba^^^ed, bore down. and triumphed over all hostile opposition, in
every quarter of the glob^, both by land and s^a, which the united power and
policy of France, Spain, and their civilized and barbarous friends and allies,
could possi^ly exert.

At first* I thought to have made one entire Dramatic Piece of it, through the
whole course of the war, so gloriously successf^l to Great Britain, beyond all
parallel; rendering her terrible to the nation^ around, and so eff^^tually
humbling to France; to ally destroying her trade* (...), and overcoming all her
armaments, both by land and sea; that at length she could be scarcely said to
make any effort* deserving the name of resistance. Had I proceeded according to
the above design. I then intended to have named the piece, The Muchless Ae^a.
But when I came to reflect upon the transaction^ in North America; the great
and hazardous siege of Quebec, seemed to stand foremost, and claim my chief
attention: For there, near 120^0 veteran French, joined by Canadians, and many
savage tribes, lay entrenched at the only spot attackable; commanded by a bold,
experienced, enterprising, (and hit^erto) fortunate General, Monsieur de
Montcalm, and many other gallant leaders, with all the advantages of art and
nature on their side, to render their situation as formidable as possible, to
the most intrepid foe: Yet about 8000 of Britannia's troops, assisted by her
matchless ^ars, lead and animated by Wolf, Saunders, Monckton, Townshend,
Holmes, How, Murray, Fraser, and many other leaders brave, laid siege to that
strong and important fort^ess and capital; carried on their several attacks,
with the loss of about 3000 killed and wounded; and at last, on the famed
height of Abraham, with about 5000 men, gained a complete victory, and chased
in a total rout, to the garrison walls, French, Indians, and Canadians! The
glorious consequence of which was, the su^render of the city and garrison of
Q^ebec; and soon after all Canada submitted to the victorious troops of
Great Britain. So great, and many, were the remarkable transactions of that
si^ge, and so much worth, and bravery, was there di^played, I ^hought there
needed no additional aid of well wrought fiction, or fulsome adulation, to
render it worthy o^ a dramatic representa^ion. I therefore resolved to send it
^o^th into the world, dressed in the amiable ga^b of impartial v^rity, under
the title of The Conquest of Canada* Or, The ^iege of Queb^c; and d^sig^ed to
adhere strictly to historical facts, as much as a dramatic performance would
allow. Not being conversant with the stage, and consequently not well
acquainted with the rules of the drama, as a dramatic writer, perhap^ I may
have greatly erred in the comp^siti^n of the play, as to time, place,
circumstances, and many other minute particulars, which the most jud^cious and
nice critics in ancient literature, may think a work of this kind dese^ves. But
I write an historical tra^edy; and as a historian, have endeavored to displa^,
in the different scenes, a representation of real and genuine fact^, great in
themselves, as any in our times, and amply worthy of being registered in the
annals of fame, as rival actions of those patriotic deeds, of the so much
admired ancient Greeks and Romans! We read with pleasure and admiration the
sie^e of Calais, Aquileia, Addison's Cato and the gallant defense of the
Thermopylaean pass; where the regal patri^t Leonidas, with his few chosen, and
ever renowned Spartans, Thebans, and Thespians, nobly fell, in the defense of
their country, its privi^eges and laws. Yet at these places, n^n^ but Gauls,
Greeks, and Romans, were the worthy warriors, with whom we are so pleased.
Whilst Greece and Rome boast their patriotic warriors slain in defense of their
laws and liberties, and France trumpets forth the noble and praiseworthy
resolutions of her Burghers at Calais, who only offered themselves at the mercy
of the British royal victor, to save their country men, friends, and relat^ons
from ruin; yet providentially esc^ped the threatened fate, and lived very
justly revered by their grateful country.

I SAY, whilst all these states seem emulously to vie with each other for the
greatest honor in the records of patriotism, shall we be mute, nor give
deserved appl^use to these gallant country men of ours, who to save wives,
children, lands and laws, fought, bled, and died in the glorious cause of
freedom, and the service of their country, at Louisbourg, Quebec, etc. and
shall we not enjoy a more exquisite pleasure, when we read the scenes which
display the victorious intrepidity, warlike worth, or gl^rious deaths, not of
Greeks, Gauls, and Romans, (as of^ has happened, against rude, ba^barous, or
^ffemin^^ed troops* or at best if disciplined, not trained and a^med like
themselves, for offensi^e and defensive war;) but of Englishmen, Caledonians*
and Hibernians, who engaged against superior numbers, like themselves
civilized; who had a constant supply from large magazines of all the
destructive implements of death; trained, armed, and equally disciplined in the
art^ of war, and well skilled in every ma^oeuvre of the field; and were immured
in strong fort^esses, or advantageously entrenched; yet these they would often
attack, and fir^d by pa^riotic ardor* (with an impetuosi^y not to be withstood)
would ^out from trench to ^r^nch, chase from field t^ field; and drive from
garrison to garrison, the^e more numerous, well disciplined, and vete^^n
forces, till all retreat was cut off, and submission became the only resource
they had left for safety: Whilst the nations around trembled at Britannia's
name, and dreaded the u^ited thunder-storm of her ter^ene and naval warriors.

ACT I. SOPHRONIA's HOUSE.
SCENE I.
SOPHRONIA and WOLF. SOPHRONIA. THEN you resolve to leave me!


Wolf. Madam. I do --
Our ^^g^ and patriot Minister on me
Has h^'d his choice, to stand prime candidate
^or ho^our in th^s glorious enterprise;
Our martial King (well pleased) gave his royal
Assen^ to that choice, and glory calls me forth.

Sophr. Have not those British troop you have trained to war.
Given ample proof of skill and courage, in
The day of battle, and by their conduct,
Reflected ^o^ou^ on you their former
Chief? And Louisbourg bore dreadful witness,
To y^u impetu^us and u^hated
Fur^ in the siege: Why then should future
Fame engross the a^^ention ^f your soul?

Wolf. Those troops you're pleased to hint at; wh^^ they tought,
Were headed b^ another: Besides, it
Is too scant an honor to shine by their
Reflection, and borrow glory from those
Gallant s^ldiers deeds. --
At Louisbourg, I wa^ not first in the
Command, and cannot claim the foremost rank
Of fame: Then I only took a gentle
Sip of honor's cup, but was with held by
Destiny from draining it, which like true
Lovers kisses* (still raising new desires,)
Has set my thirsty soul in flame for more!
And being chief, I long to swallow down
Whole draughts of glory: like Philip's conquering
Son, I Would bathe in Seas of danger, brave all
The horrors of the sight, and with eyes of
Warlike jealousy, stand on the watch for
Some adventurous deeds, worthy of my King,
My country, and a British General

Sophr. Forgiv^, my son, a mother's fears:
I would not check you in your full career
To glory, nor from my country's service
Willingly detain a brave and useful leader: --
My heart distends with secret pride, and joy
Maternal fills my bosom, whenever I
Call you son: But oh! (sad thought!) I much fear
The impetuous fury of your soul, will
Greatly spur you on to wounds, and dangers,
And perhaps to death: --
Oh! think what I must then endure* --
You have already gained great honor; --
Be sedately brave, and cautiously
Intrepid; -- repress the furious ardor
Of your mind; -- be content; -- and --

Wolf. Madam, I guess your speech;
You Would say, and stay at home -- That cannot be.
Shall I, with a dull tortoise pace, set out
In honor's path, and at the sl^ghtest touch
Of danger, like him, shri^k back into my
Shell? No! -- let these resemblances of men,
Who outside wear the martial garb, and seem
To look the lio^ in their s^^l^ po^t.
Yet bee^ within a timorous deer-like soul:
(...) so (...) these (if such there are in life)
I^ gro^^^i^g sl^th receive their country's p^^.
Tremble at the thought of action! and when
The foe is named, start! look aghast! and grow pale!
The animating trumpets! the artiller^'s roar!
My soldiers ^teady manly looks! the drums!
The (...)! and all the grand apparatus
For the war have charm^ for me to rouse my
Faculties, and kindle up an ardor
In my soul, beyond wh^^ speech can paint! or
Any but a warrior (...)! --
Madam I am resolved.

Sophr. Since you will go, come to my arms and take
A mother's blessing. Embracing him.
Hear me all-suffici^nt (...)! inspire, and
Guard my son: Let him not seek danger for
The sake of danger, nor feel a coward's
Pang: Oh! give him victory, and to my
Arms, again restore the darling of my age.
Now, go my sor^: -- Deserve a Briton's name; --
With honor come; -- or, -- oh my fault'ring tongue!
I would say, come not ^ll; -- and yet a
Mother's fond anxiety, would make me
Say* at any rate return --

Wolf. Be pleased to wait with patience this event;
And during this intended siege I hope
All things will so concur together, that
I shall at last return with life and honor.

Sophr. Oh! direful thought! in battle felled you may
Be trodden under foot, in the purple
Stream, flowing from the fountain of your heart: Weeps.
Perhaps whilst bleeding, and ebbing life but
Tardily retreats from the weak shattered
Mansion, you may fall a prey to some fell
Savages, who stand insultingly over
Departing life, and and a racking pang!
(A pang!) more exquisite to manly souls,
Than glorious death could ever inflict.

Lea^e on his ^read, as if to faint, but recovers again. Wolf Madam, I beg
you would calm the inquie^udes
O^ you^ soul, and grieve no more at thoughts of
What may come to pass, but has no certainty:
Yet be assured, whatever shall hap, I Will bring
No st^in upon my family, or my
Country; what wounds I gain, shall be by me
Most honestly received, against my front
Shall ev'^y terror fl^, and I will face
The hostile th^ndring storm of death, and if
I fall, I Will f^ll at least with honor.

Sophr. At lenght my resolution, and a warm
Regard for Britain's welfare, seem to stand
Almost on an equality with my
Maternal fond^es; and now the intestine
Conflict in my soul partly subsides: --
Oh! poignant thought of deep distress! shall I
Ever spur my son to battle, and to death!
And yet, oh! keener thought of woe! shall I
Receive a dastard to my arms! and hear
My country curse the inglorious war he made!
Forbid it Heaven! -- avert it, oh -- my son, --
Another dear embrace before we part;
Embracing him, weeping: Perhaps to meet no more below. --
O^! cruel ^ar! -- oh! dear bought fame! --
Oh! wou'd'st thou co^^^ a gentler mistress than
Rough honor! -- but it is the will of fate, and thine.
Then go; -- thy King commands; thy country calls;
-- Forget not thyself! -- and guess the rest:

Wolf. You Would say return victorious; -- at least come
Home with honor; -- bring home no dastard looks
To me: -- Your fears are just; -- your caution's good;
I Will not forget myself. -- When in danger
Most extreme, I Will recollect the glory of
My King, Britannia's well, and what should
Be to every soldier dearer than his
(...) my own honor is at stake; with this
Threefold recollection backed, what horrid
Shape can death put on, to chill the ardor
Of my heart, or shock my steady soul?
Who would not fight in mighty George's cause,
When mothers pray, and sigh a fond applause!
Madam, farewell. -- Exit Wolf.
SOPHRONIA sola. Oh! it is hard indeed to root affection
Up in outward show, and bid a son go ^^ght!
None but a mother knows the bitter task,
To quell the tender yearnings of a parent's
Soul, and for a son so full of manly
Fortitude, and patriotic worth!
If he returns victorious, I Am blessed indeed!
If he falls, with him fall all my fond hopes,
And I am gloriously unhappy! Exit Sophr.

SCENE II.
SOPHIA's Parlour. WOLF solus. Now comes the time to prove my resolution;
I Am wrapped in amorous doubt, mixed with a sweet
Perplexity! Love's fierce desires inform
My glowing soul! the wished for malady
With ardent tremor rolls through every vital part!
The sages surely have mistook.
And Heaven ordained that darling sex, to rule
Superior here below: How facile to
Subdue they find our mighty boasted reason!
In every glance a soft inchantment's couched!
And their pretty prattling tongues are hung with
An harmonious magic! --
How potent when a^ray'd with each killing charm,
Is all conquering woman! --
The downy fetters which she throws around
The heart, when first laid on scarce felt; soon prove
More hard to break than links of stubborn steel,
Be firm my heart; and let me not be drawn
Like Anthony, by f^nd desire, to quit
Bright honor's chase* but let me run resolved
The race of glory, --
Now two great passions str^ggle for command;
'Twixt love, and glory* I suspended stand:
Born down by beauty's blaz^, my soul gives way,
Like mollien^ wax, in sol's refulgent ray;
At p^^r^'s call, again abdur'd I grow,
And ^up^d fl^^s before the martial glow;
Yet when returned, I shall my charmer meet,
And lay new lau^els gained at Sophia's fe^t;
Bright Sophia then shall here unrivaled reign,
And with one smile, shall overpay my pain. Exit.
SCENE III.
Scene draws, and discovers WOLF and SOPHIA, sitting. Soph. Then I find, Sir,
you prefer the noise and
Danger of the battle, and fatigues of
A foreign campaign, to the q^iet enjoyment
O^ your friends in s^^tey in your native
Country?

Wolf. Madam* you already know my sentiments:
Our Monarch* good, and gracious as he is,
In me reposes special trust; in me,
Great Britain, and her Patriots confide;
With joy, my faithful sturdy soldiers wait
To ha^l me General: N^ sluggish thought
Shall ever harbor in my breast, to cause
Me to recede from my firm purpose.

Soph. I think not of altering your purpose
For the war; perhaps that would be a task
Too hate: --
And yet methinks we might expect a more
(...) pleasure than ^e yet have had, in
(...) company, and friendship, that we mi^ht
(...) more esteem (...) heap (...) ^avou^s on
The man, (...) actions have rendered him so

Wolf. That rival mistress sho^tly must depart,
And you remain s^le charme^ of my soul.
No grea^er joy has sat in store! since you
Are pleased to give me but a distant hope!
To bid me conquer! and make my fame your
T^^me! and prom^se me you will smile applause on

S^ph. I (...) would I fain detain you here, and with
(...) strive to beguile your
Re^olution for this foreign war: But
Being (...) with (...) Royal confidence,
And public approbation, and drawn by
Glory's animating call, I cannot
Wish you to relinquish that high cl^im of
Honor which fires your soul: may ^our guardian
Angel go forth with you to the battle;
Avert each rapid bullet as it flies
And w^rd far off the mor^al steel: and oh!
May you return with victory crowned, to bless
M^ l^nging eyes again. --

Wolf Dear as you have ever been, this last kind speech
Makes you sh^ne more amiable; rend'ring
Y^u dearer to my soul, by sympathy
Of sentiment. -- Madam* I take my leave: -- Embracing her tenderly Embracing
her a second time.
Dear! dear m^id! Farewell!
Exit Wolf, Sophia attends him to the door; looking eagerly after him. SOPHIA
sola. He Is gone! [Weeps] and yet he seemed as if about
To stay; and often backward cast such tender
Speaking looks of sweet distress, as if ^is
Soul had been upon the wing to quit its
B^dy, and fix its habitation here.
The thri^ling eloquence so charmed my senses,
I thought my soul about to blend with his;
And such an unwonted pungent pang be
Gave my heart at parting! as if he there
Till then had grown; and thence was dragged by some
Superior force! Exit Sophia.

SCENE IV.
PORTSMOUTH POINT, or BEACH. Enter a LAND and SEA OFFICER meeting. Sea Off.
Good morrow ^'ye, Sir: What news is stirring?


Land Off. News, my friend? I can tell you such a piece
Of news* as once to hear it would make a
(...) sinner leap for joy! a soldier
Leave his wench! a sailor leave his slip! and
All France to tremble!

Sea. Off. The^ I Am sure it is warlike news:
^^me new expe^ition, spine siege, I hope;
For naught like that can make Britann^^' s^ns
Of thunder leave their wenches and their slip;
And nothing better suited to make the
Mons^^u^^ tremble.

Land Off. A siege it is:
Our good old King has doomed Quebec to fall;
Put longs to have an ampler vengeance;
And Wolf is nominated General:
Wolf! at whose name the French are thunderstruck
The in^repid M^n^kton is the second, and
The gallant Townshend third in the command:
Their presence* (as the sun gives heat and day
Light) can warm each soldier's heart for battle,
And spur an animated army on
full speed to glory.

Sea* Off. But who is the Admiral for this design!
I want to thrash their jackets once again.

Land Off. I hear it is the gallant Saunders, and
Holmes the second in command.

Sea Off. Just as I wished: -- I sail with Saunders*
He is a brave commander, and will soon
Give a convincing proof of it on the,
Frenchmen to their c^st. --
I th^nk now England has pretty well paid
Herself for the l^ss of St. Philip's. --

Land Off. I think so too: -- Yet between you and I*
They met no offenc'd Jack-^-Dandys there;
The brave old Blak^ne^ and his worthy ^ew
OF vet'ran troops, and new'y landed tars,
Were fierce as lions, and fearless as Job's
War horse.

Sea Off. There they got a sample of what they might
Expect* and since have had a full measure
Of vengeance p^^r'd out upon them.

Land Off. And more shall ^are or I Am mistaken.


Sea Off. With what tumeltuous joy, the burning scene
We (...)! when fi^score ships, with warehouses.
And stores were wrapped in o^^ fierce British blaze.
Whilst with accustomed shou^^ we frightened France!
Meanwhile, St. Maloe's thunder, silent as
The grave growl'd not the least defiance, as
If well pleased with Marlb'rough's vengeance.

Land Off. Their troubles, tears, and losses, only then began.


Sea Off. Right brother Officer! 'twas glorious sport!
Where pri^cely Edward ^ought on hostile ground;
And where the gallant How, and B^^gh engaged;
(And once more bore destruction to proud France:)
To see at Edward's feet, their stubborn ramparts
Kiss the ground! their empty plundered royal
Stores, and magazines, in flames! and then to
Crown the scene, to see the subterraneous
Ruin rise, and all disjointed fling their
Cherbourg's costly basin in the air!

Land Off. These were sights worth seeing!


Sea Off. Then to sail along their coasts, with Osborne,
Gardener, Hawke, and How; to take the O^p^ee and
The more dreadful Fo^droyant! (changing the
Expedition of D^ Quesne, to Britain's
Shore, instead of Louisbourg,) driving their
Fleets into neutral harbors, locking up
Their ports, and stagnating all their trade! then
To go with Rodney, and overturn all
Their flat bottomed war! to break their fine spun
Project of invasion, and ram their schemes
Down their throats wrapped up in smoke!

Land Off. This sport was chiefly on the element,
Where you sailors were the best actors, and
We soldiers had but little hand in it:
But we handled them a little roughly
At Senegal, and many other places
Of the torrid zone; where, with resistless
Fury, Watson, Saver, Barrington, Marsh,
Mason Moore, and Draper, with other bold
Commanders, swept all before them, in a
Deluge of repeated victories!

Sea Off. And amongst the rest, Keppel in a storm
Of thunder, beat Goree to the ground.
And as if the French had not had loss and griefs
Enough, how bold Boscawen mauled De Clue!
Scattering his fleet, and driving some on shore,
Taking, burning, sinking, at his pleasure!
And then it was, the French ocean, by the
Hardy De la Clue commanded, tumbled
On the shore to shun Boscawen's rage, and
Was licked up by English flame!

Land Off. And still to add England's glory, and
Their shame, to seize upon Cape Breton's Isle.
Oh! had thou seen that siege! it would have served
Thee for an age to come, whilst passing round
The flowing cann, to tell thy friends the tale.
Thus would thou say, invelop'd in a cloud
Of sulph'rou^ smoke, which broke in thunder from
The British fleet; with British thunderbolts well
Stored and through a mortal shower of shot, and
Shells, and leaden deaths, from cannons, mortars,
And French entrenchments sent Amherst, and Wolf,
Sedately warmed, and most Serenely bold,
(As if their presence victory insur'd)
With Britain's troops, plunged into the flood, to
Ravish mighty fate! to bid destruction
Defiance! and outface the grim king of terrors!

Sea Off. There England's troops and tars were nobly tried;
And there the Frenchmen learnt, how terrible
We are, when rushing on in dread union,
Thirsting after fame, and eager for the battle.

Land Off. The disposition for the siege was a
Most glorious toil: each soldier, and each
Sailor, strove t'outdo each other: --
Our cannons, mortars, echorns, bellowed loud
Against the place; defiance thundered from
The fo^ts of France; that like mount Aetna, and
Vesuvi^^, in convu^sive rage, both parties fought.
Foil against the town, and grand fort, Amherit
Beat his fury; whilst Wolf attacked, and sunk,
And burnt their ships, o'erturn'd the thunder of
Their Island fort, and from the base tore up
Their ramparts! battering the front before
His storm headlong into the sea! and now
Against Dauphin gate, his brazen engines yawn'd,
Pregnant with destruction, Drucour, amazed!
For parley called and gave up Louisbourg.

Sea Off. 'Twas high time to give it up; else Hardy,
And Bo^cawen, would soon have made the place
Too hot for him, and from their double tiers
Have sent him such a surly summons, as
Would have puzzled him, and nonplus'd all his
Troops ever they could recollect themselves, to
Remit them a reply of equal weight.
But my worthy friend, you forgot, or else
Omitted one great transaction of the
Siege; the ships, the ships, the boats took.

Land Off. Right: I had forgot indeed:
One night the fleet's boats, under the command
Of the bold Bal^our, and Laforey, rowed
Into the harbor of Louisbourg, and
Amidst all the terrors of a gloomy night,
In an unfriendly port, through a random
Strom of death, and under cover of their
Garrison, they bravely boarded, and took
Possession of two men of war at once,
A sixty, and a seventy four gun ship!
They burnt Le Prudent, (which stuck a ground,)
And from the harbor towed Le B^en^a^^ant
Away!

Sea Off. We generally go through with what we Take in hand.


Land Off A few words more before we part.
I wonder what posse^^'d the French nation
T^ kindle up a^resh the flames of war,
Or after kindling them, st^ll to carry
On the war, whilst Old England owned a Pit;
And for their terror on the land, a Wolf,
An Amherst, and a Granby, a Johnson,
Williams, Foy Phillips, Drummond, and Macbean;
A Fr^zer, Olive, Coo^e, a Townshend, Elliot,
And a Murray: With such a numerous list
Besides of worthies, in the triple union
Of England, that when all famed Homer's boasted
Warriors are compared with them, they seem a
Few, each of them an equal to Hector,
And a rival to fierce Mars.

Sea Off. And for their scourge at sea, a Hawke, a How,
A Saunders, a Pocock, and Boscawen;
A Gilchrist, Clements, Elliot, and Logie;
A K^ppel, Rodney, Lockhart, Tyrrel, Forest;
A Hardy, Holmes, a Langdon, and a Suckling:
With hundred^ more* all hardy tars and good
Commanders brave, each of whose names would sound
In a Frenchman's ears, like to a clap of Thunder!
[Going Off.] We Have whole fleets manned with brave fellows. Exit.

Land Off. [Going Off.] Whole reg'ments of heroes!


Exit. SCENE V.
Scene draws, and discovers JACK RATLIN, NED FORECASTLE and JEMMY CHAUNTER,
with several other sailors, in a drin^ing house. NED taking up the mug, or
bowl. Come here is success to Admiral Saunders,
And Admiral Holmes, and to our own ship's crew;
T^ ^y'^e a parcel of as good fellows as
^^er went between stem and stern of a ship. Drinks.
Jack Ratl. But now I think on it, give us that new song,
J^mmy C^aunter, that you got the the other day:
I ^ike it N^d. Turning to Ned.

Ned. Is it about fighting? If it is, let us have it.
[J^mmy rising.] With all my heart, brothers.

All rising. I.
Come on my brave tars! let us away to the wars,
To the siege of Quebec let us advance;
Our anchor's a trip, ^et's away to the ship,
And bellow defiance to France.
Brave boys, etc.
II.
We'll spread every sail, with a prosperous gale,
Through the kingdom of Neptune we'll roam!
If we meet the ^^ench fleet, in thunder we'll greet,
Well take 'em, or drive them all home.
Brave boys, etc.
III.
If they dare to engage, and meet British rage,
We'll bear closely down to the fight;
Yard arm and yard arm, their jackets well warm,
For that is the Britons delight.
Brave boys, etc.
IV.
When the fight is begun, lest away they should run,
Our grapples shall hold us together;
It Is a sport they don't like, we'll soon make'em strike,
And straightway bear down to another.
Brave boys, etc.
V.
Well range to 'em close, and a terrible dose,
For a sample, we'll send the Monsieurs;
If the fight does not end, then another we'll send,
From both of our thundering tiers!
Brave boys, etc.
VI.
On their quarters we'll board, with pike, pistols and sword;
Hawke like we will pounce on our prey;
We'll make them our own, and their flags we'll haul down,
For George shall be Sovereign at sea.
Brave boys, etc.
VII.
When our thunder shall break, over the walls of Quebec,
Monsieurs! your strong ramparts shall not save ye;
Your heads shall all droop! and your walls shall all stoop!
When shook by the sons of the navy!
Brave boys, etc.
VIII.
Though your towers should arise, over the clouds in the skies,
Let Saunders but say that we must
Pluck 'em up to the base, each fortress we'll raze,
And trample your pride in the dust!
Brave boys, etc.
IX
When we (...) shall unite, with our troops in the fight*
And emulous jealousy calls,
As hurricanes sweep through the land and the deep.
Well sweep to destruction the Gauls! Brave boys. etc.
Exeunt omnes, huzza^ng.

ACT II. POINT LEVI, OPPOSITE QUEBEC IN AMERICA.
SCENE I.
WOLF, LEONATUS and BRITANNICUS, in a T^^^. WOLF. GOOD Providence our purpose
seems to back;
Thus far with little loss advanced, we may
Expect success will crown the enterprise.
Joined by provincial troops (...) O^^eans,
And Point Levi, well secu^'d; and as our
Fleet in anchored in the river: and forms
A ^oari^^ bulwark 'twixt this and Montmor^nci;
We Have little and ^o fear a visit from
Our (...): Our next attempt must be
To bring them to a battle.

Leonatus. And that a glorious toilsome battle too! --
Their troops (...) ours by far. Strong are
Their e^trenchments, brave and experienced
Are their Generals, and other leaders:
A rough ^eep (...) leads to their trenches!
R^gged, f^^rce, and cruel are their sav^ges:
Regulars and veterans are their soldiers:
But (...) I know will stand the test, we'll have
A mortal struggle with them! and tug in
Earnest for the conquest!

Britannicus. I hope the wished for day is near at hand,
When we shall meet them in the field, and put
To noble proof* their boas^ed veteran
Thousands* and all their scalping b^nds, and prove
We have Britannia's welfare at our hearts!

Wolf. These resolutions I approve.
We came here to purchase warlike honor;
To fight and conquer, or h^: Britons fall;
And not to tell the dastard tale at home,
We durst not see our foes.
[ Enter a Sergeant, addressing himself to Wolf.] Sir, the officer and drum
are both returned, you sent
To summon the town and garrison of Quebec.

Wolf. Let him enter.

[Exit Sergeant, enter Officer.] Wolf, to the Officer. What answer give they
to our summons?


Officer. When I, according to your orders, Sir,
In George the Second's name, demanded both
The town and garrison, the Governor
And General, with others, formed to sneer
At my demand; had me advise you ^o
Return, and ask our Royal M^ster for
The keys, and a few m^^e troops (...)
T^^m to Quebec; Their situation, they
Likewise say, is strong, and lofty: they are near
Twelve thousand regulars en^ren h'd, and at
The only spot attackable, command^d
By their bold, enterprising, fortunate
General Montcalm; and in their wonted
Gasco^^ding boast, you cannot force the
Bar^ of their gates, not during t'approach near
Enough, since Monsieur M^ntc^lm occupies
The adj^cent plain, and around their ramparts,
Forms an impenetrable living outw^rk!
Too dreadful for your near advances! and
Before whose war you c^nnot stand, if he
Chose t'ev^cuate the trenches, and give
You battle!

Wolf Say they thi^?
They shall ever long* hear Britain's thunder roll!
And feel the bolt! Our troops and tar^ shall roar
Them such a concert, as shall shake the strong
And lofty base of their Quebec! and let
Montcalm take heed, or lik^ hu^gry lions,
Foaming for their prey, we'll overleap his
Breast works, and dr^g his Frenchm^n by the heels,
Out from underground, where like moles they seem
To have buried themselves, fearing to look
At us, a^ if like basilisks, our eyes would kill!
I cannot boa^^ twelve thousand regulars,
With many savage scalping bands; my troops
Will scarcely to eight thousand rise; but these
Are gallant fellows: and I have s^^^ them
Tried: They Are Britain'^ troops; and from Old England,
Caledo^ia and Hibernia drawn

Britannicus. They Are the descendants of those very men,
Who fought at C^e^^y, Po^^^iers, Blenheim*
And often marched victorious through the heart
Of France! and surely feel the ardor of
Their brave ancestors! But more than this, in
The last war, several gained great honor,
And many, we know, both officers, and
Soldiers at the late siege of Louisbourg,
Signalized themselves.

Leonatus to Wolf. I think Sir, we have enough;
Especially when I reflect* we lead
The triple union to the battle! all
Emulous of fame! most honorably
Jealous of each other! and firmly resolved
To bring to stain upon their mother country!

Wolf. This promises full well. --
I must to my repose; weak nature will
No longer hold: Be it your care, Gentlemen,
To see ^he order of the camp, and guard
Against surprise; too much security,
Has many forts, and many armies lost.
Pardon, Gentlemen, the liberty I take,
I cannot doubt your honor, courage, or
Your prudence: Fail not I beg of using
All your eloquence, to warm the hearts of
All our troop^, against the day, in which we
Shall attack the French entrenchments, which
I intend shall shortly b^.
That day will bring the bravest to the test!

Britannicus. All shall be done a man can do,
And if example wlll have any weight,
That shall not be wanting.

Leonatus. I join my gallant brother in command,
And promise on the honor of a soldier,
On my part, that nothing shall be wanting.

Wolf. My worthy sharers in command! my
Honorable partners of bright glory!
Adieu; -- and Heaven will speed you both.

[Exeunt omnes.] SCENE II.
MONTMORENCI; (MONTCALM 's Camp.) MONTCALM, LEVI, and BOUGAINVILLE, in a Tent.
BOUGAINVILLE to MONTCALM. So it seems Sir, the Britons demanded
The town and garrison of Quebec, and
Have sent three young Generals with eight thousand
Troops on the sleeveless errand?

Montcalm. Being this day, with some others, at the
Governor's convened, I heard the British
Officer when he made the proud demand,
Which we rejected with disdain, and sent
Him back with such a message to their camp,
As will give their enterprising boasted
Wolf, but little pleasure.
On our refusal, he denounced rough war,
And threatened devestation to the town
And garrison: --
And by a prisoner we have taken,
We learn that they intend shortly to storm
Us in our trenches.

Bougainville. These Britons would be thought invincible,
And dream of nothing else but asking for
Our forts, our towns and garrisons, as if
The mention of their names had a magic
Charm in it! would waste our troops! and batte^
Down our walls! but they are mistaken!
Whenever they land at Montmorenci, let
Us from our trenches pour down upon them,
And shouting loud as Niagara's steep
Cataract, with the like rapidity,
Bear all down before us! leave the straggling
Offals of destruction, as delicious
Morsels for our savages! and scourge the
Insolence of their young leaders!

Montclam. Be not too rash, good Sir.
We must not give them battle on the plain,
Nor carry on offensive war:
Though young their leaders, and their troops but few,
Their Monarch, and their Minister, are too
S^gacious to be deceived in this so
Critical a choice! (no Pompadour rules there.)
Whatever their years, and muster roll, are found
Deficient in, depend upon it, it is
Over balanced well, by intrepidity
Of soul! active resolution! a firm
Contempt of danger! and well tried vet'ran
Service!

Levi. Lead we not better troops than they?
Besides, our numbers, bating savages,
Are full four thousand more; we have every male
Inhabitant within the town to back
Us, they are some thousands; why should we then
Within our trenches sculk, as if afraid
To meet them in the open field? rather
Let us run them down by numbers! and as
The lordly lion serves the foremost hunters.
When they press upon him, sp^rn them to a
Knowledge of themselves! who fancy now they
^ise superior to the common rank of
^en! or else let us make them in a forced
^^treat, precipitate themselves into
^e sea!

Montcalm. Rather than dream of driving them before
(...) like a timorous flock of sheep, let us
^^^pare to stand their furious charge, when they
^e ravenous wolves, o'erleaping sh^^p-folds, shall
^unt our breast-works; and plunge into our treach!
^^ich if they should, they will not fail to make
(...) feel their mortal gripe!
I (...) repose but little confidence
In open field, in the rabble thousands
(...) Quebec, and less in our savage
Bands; the former, at the first on set will
Break and run; and the latter, before the
(...) British thunder, and the bright blaze
O^ northern ^^eely ^eath! flee horror ^^uck!
And yellin^, from the field.

Bougainville to Montcalm. You seem en^^^ur'd, Sir,
With Britain's troops.
And to forget the worth and bravery of your own.

Montcalm. Pardon me, Monsieur^;
I am not guilty of so gross a fault:
I know the worth and bravery of our troops;
And only speak the opi^ion of the wo^^d
Concerning our foes; their own achievements
Loudly speak the same! --
(Waving the exp^o^s of all former days)
Look back in our own time to Fo^tenoy's
Well fought! hard earned! and dreadful field to France!
(And that Te Deum'd field of Dettinger!)
Nay, bring the prospect nearer, and look back
To Louisbourg. (s^^king yet in ruin^!
The horrid (...) of the joint well tempered
Rage, of their Ulyssean Amber^^, and
Pe^^^ean Wolf!) there art! and nature!
And the blustering ocean, join'^ to obstruct
Their landing! yet, with what an amazing
Intrepidity did they come on! and
(...) ^midst the for^i^g surges on the
(...) choosi^g (...) death, amidst the fire
O^ thousands there entrenched! rather than be
Thought tardy in the r^ce of honor!

Bougainville. But what avails all this, concerning these
(...) forces at present, come against
Quebec?

Montcalm. To put us (...) serious on our guards.
(...) the (...) and leaders!
This some young General headed them! and with
A (...), and undou^ted fury.
Sp^rr'd them on to glory! so that by his
E^ample said, ^n ^rder ran through the
(...) quick as so many trains of powder
(...) touched by the ma^ch, and rou^'d them to
Such (...) rage! no obstacle
Could (...) the rapid progress o^ their troop!

Levi. All this is granted, Sir*
But (...) the case at present changed:
At Louisbourg, they had twice their present
(...), and then we sent not all our troops
To (...) their descent; but if we now
(...) our savage friends, we number twice
(...); our twelve thousand regula^^ are
Veteran French, and have been often tried
Th^^^ the continent; we, ourselves, have seen
Each other tried in bottle; why should we
Then not meet them in the field?

Montcalm That my resolve^, and arguments, do not
Proceed from any backwardness to fight,
(...) ^o^selves appeal. --

Bougainville Of that we must acquit you, Sir.
We know your courage and ability;
But (...) would have your private reasons for
Your ^o cl^tions.

Montcalm. Hear me then with patience.
That we, I think, will stand the test, is put
Be^ood (...): That we have good and well
Trained veteran troop^ I likewise grant, and
Thousands more than they; but our success must
Be the ch^^^ell hinge, on which the affairs of
(...) must turn: This barrier passed,
They Will sweep onward like an inundation!
And overwhelm each Gallie settlement
in undistinguished ruin! and as the
Event of war was ever dubious, and
Numbers have not always conquered Englishmen;
Why should we give them equal battle, and
Throw all at stake upon the uncertain chance?

Levi. I see no need to fear the coming to a battle.

Bougainville. Nor can I doubt of matching them, whom hand
To hand engaged: Eight thousand may begin
The attack, and break the fury of their most
Impetuous charge; should these be repelled,
A corpse de reserve of four thousand men,
By all our rough Indian tribes assisted,
May soon recover that first disorder,
Help them to rally, and with new spirits.
Face the sea: or at least they will cover their
Retreat (in safety) to their trenches: Then
Shall we prove ourselves true sons of Mars, and
Wipe away the scandle of a dastard name.

Montcalm. Our business here is to preserve Quebec*
And with as little l^ss as possible;
And if from numbers we may hope success,
Let us remain entrenched, and make the event
More certain. The sea^ now swarms with English
Men of war, who intercept our transports,
And our royal fleets, therefore we can have
But little hope of a supply of men
From France: As for our invading foes, all
Their attacks must be with loss attended:
They Are few already, and their troops will thin:
Perhaps being harrass'd, sickness may ensue,
And they will grow weary of the tardy siege:
Then, when their spirits shall be most depressed,
Rush we'll on them with our united force:
Beat up their sickly camp! and make them take
A bloody farewell! by which means, we shall
Preserve our troops, our honors and Quebec.

Bougainville. On cool reflection, I now see pla
What before did not occur: Since we are
The continetial b^lwark, and with us,
Quebec must stand or fall, I do submit
To lie before it^ walls, and only act
On the defe^sive side; since through our troops
A passage must be cut into the town.

Levi to Montcalm. To your superior judgment I submit,
And well applaud the plan of operation.
This method may perhaps be better than
Fitch'd battles, where one chance blow, a signal
Misapplied, or word misunderstood,
May turn the sway of action, subvert the
Best concerted schemes, and fling a conquest
Into the arms of those, who waited but
The signal to desert the field: And all
The world allows, that warlike arts and skill
Mature, (with policy applied) to save
The men, and gain the cheapest victories,
(If not the first qualifications, they
Are) to personal bravery, the next
Best requisite in any General.

Bougainville. to Montcalm. I Have nothing to object Sir,
To your opinion I Am entirely won.

Montcalm. Be it our chiefest care then to protract
The siege, and save our men: Behind us lies
Montreal, against which place, I learn the
Gallant and experienced Amherst, their
Sage prime chief, against Louisbourg, is in full
March, with near ten thousand forces, and with
Fierce Wolf, no doubt, intends a junction; but
In all human probability, they
Never can surmount each obstacle, and
Soon enough arrive with their expected
Aid: But should that reinforcement come, the
Less our present loss, and harrassment now
Is, the better we shall then receive them.

Bougainville Let us dam up the entrance into Quebec;
No landing place lies near the threatened town,
And parcticable, but Montmorenci's
Strand, below our camp, which place we'll guard full
Well, and render innaccessable, as
Art, and warlike terrors can. --
In these Northern climes, the winter will come
On apace, and frustrate every hostile
Plan; their thin remains the (baffled refuse
Of repeated skirmishes) will then return
With disappointed hopes and sullen shame.

Montcalm. But when they land let us be well prepared
For their reception; for they will compel us
To believe their leaders fierce! and all their
Forces brave! Exeunt omnes.

THE END OF ACT II.
ACT III.
SCENE I.
POINT LEVI. WOLF, LEONATUS and BRITANNICUS. WOLF. THIS distant battery
avails us not;
We waste our troops and harrass out our men,
And expend our ball and powder but to
Little purpose: I long to see our foes,
And graple with them in a close engagement.

Britannicus. In that let all our resolutions fix,
And let every movement center in that
Purpose, to Montmorenci let us tranfer
The war, and with all our force united,
Steadily pursue the end we have planned, and
Launch destruction amongst their troops.

Wolf. Your sentiments concur with mine:
Tomorrow we'll attack 'em; the Admirals
Have promised all the assistance in their power,
And I doubt not the hearty concurrence
Of their officers and the English seamen.

Leonatus. All our officers and troops seem well pleased
And cheerfully resolved; they only wait
The signal for the undertaking.
Betwixt the soldiers and the seamen:
T^^ (...) more support with cool
(...) each other's cause, no^ in
(...) disagreement jar: All seem
To ^^rive who shall be most alert to exert
Themselves to ga^n a glorious name; and like
G^lla^^ (...) faithful brothers in the war.
A^^ire to stand with the most intrepid
Souls* the greatest shock o^ danger.

Wol^e. We w^ll not ^ail on our parts to answer
Th^^^ ^^^^est expectations* and lead them
Or to take gigantic danger by the
Thro^^^ and though repelled, we'll force the Frenchmen
To confess we sought like sons of liberty.
Now let us hence to where our several
Stations call us:
Meanwhile* let us ^ot grow tardy, but with
R^^^^bled fury cannonade, and ply
Them with disploding storms of shells, as if
We meant to b^ry them in iron graves:
Perhaps some lucky shell, or shot, marked out
^y ^a^e, may do more than a^ other times.
A mo^th of to^l^^me siege. Exeunt omnes.

SCENE II.
The stage dorbe^ed* and two m^n placed behind the scenes. with speaking
trumpets, o^e at the form, and one at the inner end of the stage. A sh^p to
appear. FRONT MAN. Make a signal immediately for all the ships
Boats, and all the fleet to mann ship!

Inner Trumpet. Bear a hand! bear a hand my lads!
Mann the boats! and pull up!
The fire ships are coming down the stream upon us!
Boats^^^^ pipes forward in the ship. All hands, hoy!
Pipes a midship, at the middle or main hatchway.
All h^^ds, hoy! tumble up, tumble up; there below!
Pipes abast, or at the after hatchway.
All hands hoy!

A great noise within of long-boat-men; y^wlers, away, a running sore and as^,
and clattering of the ears. Out barge, hoy! a running, whurrow, whurrow,
Whurrow, whurrow, pipes to lower, pipes to stop.
Front Trumpet. Bargemen, jump into the barge, and wait further orders:
Get the fire engine in readiness there!
Cheerly my boys! Cheerly!
Three ^r four boats clap along-side of that
Headmost fire ship, and tow her ashore on the
La^board side of the river.

As he speaks, a light appears on the left side of the stage. After a pause.
Have you book'd the grapples men?
Sailor answers. We have her as safe as a thief in a halter;
But the tide runs strong.

Front Trumpet. Pull up briskly, half a dozen boats more there.
And ^ow her plump ashore!

After a small time, the sailors ^uzza; one bawls out, she is safely stowed
away. Front Trumpet. There let her grow;
She makes a fine illumination:
Clear your grapples, and get off in the stream
In readiness.

Inner Trumpet, Lieutenant Hatchway, Front Trumpet b^ll^^. Inner Trumpet.
Here Is a whole fleet of fire ships, and fire floats.
Coming round the point:
The French are trading with Lucifer I think,
And have borrowed the infernal coast of him
For this night's service.

Front Trumpet. If they have borrowed his imps likewise
To conduct the machinery, we have a parcel
Of brave hardy tars, that will play their parts
Manfully in the scene, and grapple with
Any terrors which can float upon the water!

Inner Trumpet. Order more assistance here;
They Are coming down upon us six knots!
And will be close on board of us in an instant!

As he speaks, a great light appears. Front Trumpet. Row up there one whole
division of boats!
My brave fellows! behave like British seamen;
There Is warm duty for ye!

A Sailor answers. Never fear, Sir!
We'll tow them ashore, if the grapples hold,
Or we'll fry like sausages in the flames!

All whurrow, whurrow. Front Trumpet. One whole division of boats; take up
That fire ship near the two decker, and tow
Her to starboard; and be sure mind to grapple
The floats which miss the headmost division,
And touch them ashore.

First Officer within. Be ready with the fire engine!
Get up oars, poles, and booms there!
And mann the starboard side well!

Second Officer. Brace all the yards; sharp fore and aft!
And mann the shrouds and yards with pole ax
Men to clear the fire ships grapples!

First. Off. Run both tiers of guns out double shotted,
And bring them all to bear upon the fire ship!
Carpenters! stand by to cut the cables!

Second Off. Pull up your starboard oars briskly my lads!
And keep her well to starboard of us:
Take care; don't fall athwart the ship's hawse
Astern of us.

Sailors b^^l out, Whurrow, whurrow: Never fear, never fear. Second Off. She
goes clear of us:
They have her under command.

Inner Trumpet, Lieutenant Hatchway, Front Trumpet, ball^^. Inner Trumpet. I
can perceive no more fire floats and fire ships
Coming; that whole division may be employed
In picking up such as passed the Point.

Front Trumpet. They are all clapped on board by this time,
And greatest part of them landed on Terra Firma:
The most mischief they have done us, was just
To singe one of the ships sides as they passed.
All the sailors within, Huzza! huzza! huzza! scene closes; lights descend.
SCENE III.
POINT LEVI: Sentinels call in this manner behind the scenes, going up the
right side thrice; that is in the front, center, and rear* All Is well: The like
on the left side, rear, center and front, all is well: At a distance, as on
^eard the fleet in the river, all is well; all is well; all is well; all is well;
different voices. WOLF Solus, in his Tent. The dreadful tumult of this horrid
night
Is over, and with its clamours are all its
Terrors vanished.
Stuck f^rm upon the shore, in harmless blaze,
These engines of destruction melt away.
Throughout the fleet the voice of safety runs*
And through the camp, from right to left, I hear
The sentinels revolve the welcome sound.
Enter a SEA OFFICER. WOLF to him, I congratulate you, Sir, on this night's
Success, and the safety of all our fleet.
We have luckily escaped the danger,
With which th^se fire ships threatened us.
Sea Off. They threatened us with no less than total
(...) in (...) relentless blaze! it was
A (...) of policy, and the
French had like to have raised the siege at one
Decisive blo^. We had warm and busy
Duty, and every boat belonging to
The fleet, was well employed.

Wolf. Upon this point, wrapped in suspense I stood,
To see the fiery ^^luge ^o^ling down
Upon us, nor sti^r'd from hence, until each
Flame was towed on shore, nor failed to mark with
Pleasure, the transactions of the boats, and
The activity of our ^ars.

Sea Off. They all behaved worthy of the fame they
Have 'midst fire and smoke, in naval battles
Gained: when first the alarm was given to mann our
Boats, to meet and stop the fire ships, and floats,
Turned adrift upon the stream toward us*
They never betrayed one token of base fear,
Or backward tardiness for duty, though
All a head appeared, as if the fiery
Phlegethon had risen from its burning
Bed, and from the hostile walls, was pouring
Down it is sulfurous torrent upon our fleet:
With all the speed that oar's could make, they rowed
Amidst the gloomy danger, surrounded
On each side by floating flame! and as they
Breathed drew in thick clouds of suffocating smoke:
Still, as fresh ships and fire floats, came pouring
Down, new spirits and new strength they seemed to
Gain! with busy anxious minds they boldly
Wrought, and clear from every ship they towed
The internal flame!

Wolf. Whilst they were busy in the burning war,
We in a vigilant suspense remained
For battle ready, we might repel the
Sudden onset expected from the French;
'Twas there they failed in policy.

Sea Off. Perhaps in courage, Sir: it is seldom known
They beat up English camps, or board a ship,
Except when they are greatly superior
In their force and numbers, and have a most
Convenient opportunity.

Wolf. England, I think is most peculiarly
Happy in her naval powers; I see
No cause to doubt their future conduct in
This siege; we have here, brave, vigilant, and
Hardy officers and seamen.

Sea Off. Their match in all his annual round the
Sun sees not, so capable of duty,
Or so agile in the working of the
Ship, and brimful of alacrity, when
Bearing down upon the foe to to battle.
On the mortal verge of close engagement*
I Have seen their souls overflow with joy! and their
Full charged hearts, like rivers rising over their
Bank^, pour out a flood of rough but apt and
Daring sentiments!
England exult! tell wondering nations round,
Thy freeborn tars mock at the name of fear!
Fear not my lad^ says every British tar,
And plunges through the thunder of fight!
Where ^lame and death, and war, rage in the most
Tumultuous manner, there shout Britannia's
Seamen, and with delight engage!

Wolf. I hope they will still deserve the name they have gained,
And live in friendly union with our troops:
To morrow I intend another rough
Trial of their b^^very and spirit,
When they shall launch our sons of Mars upon the shore.

Sea Off. I Will pawn my life our sailors will not fail,
I bid you, Sir, good night.

Wolf. The same to you, Sir. Exit Officer.


Wolf solus. O thou, whose never sleeping eyes pierce at
One ^ance through space immense, w^tch over our camp!
Retard all hostile ills! and shield us from surprise!

Exit Wolf, or the scene closes. SCENE IV.
The French Camp at MONT^ORENCI, MONTCALM. and BOUGAINVILLE. MONTCALM. Our
grand scheme is baffled, and all our hopes
From that quarter are frustrated.

Bougainville. I had such a firm reliance on it,
I thought it would surpass all human power
To baffle it: I expected no less
Than universal ruin to their fleet,
To have seen their powder blaze, and all their
Stores expire in flames, whilst from their ships they
Leapt by hundreds, and plunged to watery death
Below, t'escape the burning war above:
At least, I thought the greedy flame would have
Devoured several ships, and forced some others
On the shore, and some whole crews have perished
In the wild confusion!

Montcalm. But see how contrary last night's event!
Their sailors seem another race of men,
Whenever compared against other countries tars,
And like the water, sulpher, smoke and flame!
Seem almost to be their element! they
Laugh at threatening danger! and play with black
Destruction!

Bougainville. They Have done this night, what England may ever
Boast, what France will scarce believe, and other
Nations stand astonished at!

Montcalm. Ungrateful truth! How many of us from
Our different posts, marked with what unconcern,
And cheerful resolution, they met the
Flaming fleet! Oars mixed with oars, like persons
Striving for the goal! the sternmost drove the
Head most on! cheering each other with their
N^ise! all full of emulation, who should
Throw the grapples first! and thronging fiercely
To catch each flame, they formed (if I may use
The exp^ess^^n) a sort of n^val pha^anx,
(...) for any of our fire floats to
Pass, and do the wished for execution!

Boug^^v^lle. For the future, but (...) from the like
We can (...): they are so ^warn'd, and will
Not now be off their guard. Besides, it was
The chi^^est effort we can make, and they
Who ba^^led this, will s^ee^ at all our vain attempts.

Montcalm Next we may expect to meet them on the
S^^re; for flushed wi^h this success, and full of
Indignation ^ the great design, no
Doubt they will make some desperate push, by way of
Pierce retaliation. -- Let u^ expect
The worst, 'twill rouse us more! and if we can
Repel them now, perhaps they will raise the siege.

Bougainville. Let them come on! -- we fear them not!
We Are ready! -- They shall have a warm Welcome!

Montcalm. And such I hope, as will prevent their bold
Intrusion for the future. Exeunt.

Lady A^bess. Heavenly Father! -- [crossing herself.]
Such another night, for all the world I
(...) not choose to pass! --
And (...) the (...) of our own guns
In ^he garrison* (so near us) and the
Continual discharge from Point Levi, and
The Bri^ish sh^ps* of mortars and cannon,
The city seemed to r^el* nay, the very
G^ound trembled under us! whilst the whole ai^
(...) one unin^ermitted shock; and in
(...) und^^^ting space, long hung the hoarse
(...) sound* like distant thunder.

1 ^^ Nun. Good heav'n^! --
(...) was the scene within our walls!
(...) ^he cheering company of the
(...) intrepi^ sex, to sooth our souls and
Calm our ^eart* each si^ter gave herself for lost!

2 d Nun How shocking through the gloom of night, wou^d the
Di^charge of their artil^'ry, and mortars,
(...) like ligh^ning, against our walls, and gleam
(...) through the long range of all our
(...) and then to raise us from the trembling
S^^por into Which the sight had thrown us,
Instantly, the t^rrific roar rolled over head!

1 ^^ Nun. Methinks I yet hear the battering of
The balls! and see the shells* (like meteors)
With their flaming tails* descending through the air!

Lady Abbess. The shrieking sisterhood, (like a flock of
F^^ght^n'd doves, trembling! and scat^'ring from an
Eagle s^^^ng down) often as they heard the
V^ice; a shell! or flight of shells! in
D^leful accents pierce their ears* or saw the
^^ming shower aloft* fell prostrate! kneeled! and
Prayed! or ran almost each a different
Way, as fear suggested; seeking shelter,
And dubious of the event! -- and from our
Apartments, as they burst around us, broke
Forth a terrifying scream! --

1 st Nun. To this without our walls, in a dismal
Concert, rung the groans, and cries, of dying
People! -- Houses tumbling into ruins! --
Or perishing in flames: -- Fearful mothers,
With their children crying, and thronging in
Heaps; not knowing where to fly for present
Security, and calling loud on all
The saints for help.

Lady Abbess. Alas! in vain! --
For over head would rise another shower
Of shells, and send them screeching headlong to
A distant spot! -- many too slowly fled;
For death, with unrelenting have, followed
At their heels, and as a peasant cuts through
A grassy meadow, so he mowed down the
Crowd! --

2 d Nun. Oh terrible! -- if they should take the City
And we should fall into the hands of these
Rough Englishmen!

1 st. Nun. I Am shocked at the thought! --


2 d Nun. The very idea harrows up my
Soul! --
And darts a tremor through every nerve!

Lady Abbess. I hope it will not happen as you fear,
We have all the saints on our sides, to pray
For us: the bold General Montcalm, (who
Has often beat them) and twelve thousand French
Sold^ers, with a Canadian militia,
And some thousands of Indians, to fight for
Us, and they are not half our number.

2 d Nun. But still my good Lady they may beat us;
And then alas what may we expect will
Be the consequence!

1 st Nun. to Lady Abbess. Our Confessors, Father Dominic, and
Father Francis, have told us strange things.

Lady Abbess. Perhaps our good Fathers were a little
Too rash in forming their judgments, or were
Misinformed. What their whole nation is, I
Cannot say; but I Am told by a Lady,
Who was at Loui^bourg when taken by them,
That the officers behaved with the greatest
Civility and politeness to all,
But in a more peculiar manner, to
The religious Ladies, and orders, of
All sorts; kept the strictest decorum in
The town, among their soldiers, and stuck most
Honorably to their capitulation,
Injuring none, after the deliv'ry
Of the forts and town.

1 st Nun to Lady Abbess. I Am greatly shocked at what our Confessors
Have told us!

Lady Abbess. My dear children, discard these fears: I hope
The Governor will not give up the town;
But if he should, let this calm all our doubts:
These are the men, who treated their captive
Enemies with so much humanity
And good manners at Louisbourg.

2 d Nun to Lady Abbess How know you that, Madam?


Lady Abbess. From the same Lady, who informed me of
The^r former behavior. I trust we are safe
From personal insult: for where the true
Spirit of brav'ry inspires the breast of
Any Commanders in Chief, a manly
Generosity accompanies it;
(...) they will keep the troops under their command,
(...) order and discipline.

^ ^^ Nun. Heaven hear my prayer and grant they may!
(...) almost at my wits end! --

(...) Abbess. But for your further comfort, my ghostly
(...) tells me, we are by and by to
(...) a general solemn procession,
(...) of Misericordia, to
(...) the ruin which threatens us,
(...) invasion of our enemy.
Let us retire my children, and join with
Them in their petitions for victory.
This is our last, our best resource, in all
Our dangers. Exeunt omnes.

POINT LEVI: WOLF solus, in his Tent. The hour is near; and swift upon the
wings
Of time the minute rides, pregnant with (...)!
And full of dread decision; whether we
Rout them from their fortyfi'c entrenchments,
Or retreat with loss from Montmorenci,
The purple bed of honor will this day
Be thronged with British worthies.
[Enter an Officer.] Sir all the forces are embarked, the ships
Are station'd for their cover, both officers
And men are in high spirits, and all seem
To be resolutely ready to force
The Gallic lines, and make their landing good.
Wolf. The lover pining in the absence of
The fair inchantress of his heart, never felt
Such a flood of joy rush in upon his
Soul, when she returning, charms his ears with
The well known acc^^ts of her tongue, a^ I
Now feel, to hear the welcome tale; -- which tale,
Has roused me to the onset, and kindled
Every martial sentiment within my
Soul, I go, at honorable Freedom's
Call. To fi^ht my country's ba^^le. Exeunt.

'Till we in safety shall depose our charge,
Rese^'d from death, and far from scalping foes.

Ochterlony. My generous men, I ever thought you brave,
And worthy of the same our troops have gained;
I feel I have my mortal wound received,
Should I retard your quick retreat, you're lost:
I am not therefore worth the hazard of
Your lives, which yet may be of service to
Your country, and in future days revenge
My f^ll. Here let me lie, in painful joy,
Reflecting on my soldiers proffered love;
(...) b^ar the gallant Peyton from the field,
I know his valor, and I love the man!
Perhaps the foe may one day feel his worth,
And you his gratitude.

Soldiers. We'll take you likewise, Sir.


Ochterlony. Soldiers, no more: I will not hazard lives
So precious to Great Britain, and my king;
Nor at so great a price, will ^early buy
A ^ew short painful useless moments here:
But oh! fulfill my last my bent request!
Preserve my friend; defend his precious life;
And bear him safely hence!
Ochterlony (...) on a dead body. Soldiers move toward Mr. Peyton.
Peyton. Stand off soldiers! nor think to take me hence.
O can! can I bear the cruciating thought!
How shall I when amongst our troops arrived
Ever cast a look of warm reflection back,
And in idea see my gallant friend,
My Ochterlony! whilst alive forsook!
And by his Peyton! Oh, then to see him
Drowned in blood! by savage foes incircled,
Screaming aloud the infernal yell of joy;
Then see the toma^ sink into his head:
His body mangled; and his scalp torn off,
Whilst he perhaps is vainly calling on
His absent friend! --
No Peyton near, to dart like lightning on
Them! and with remorseless amicable
Fury, tread them down among their kindred
Fiends below!

Sergeant. Consider, Sir, reject not timely aid,
Though fractur'd be your bone, vigor remains,
And youth, and time may give that part new strength;
Besides you yet may serve your country.

Peyton. Sergeant, thou spok'st a dagger to my heart:
For safety, and for life, my country calls,
Then who shall Ochterlony save! pausing a little.
It is resolved: -- and here will I remain.
Speaking now in a commanding tone: Soldiers, with speed retreat while yet you
may!

Sergeant. Farewell, ye brave and much loved officers;
We'd gladly bear you hence, and with our lives
At stake defend you both would, you consent;
But here we can no longer safely stay,
Our duty to our country calls us hence;
For from their lofty trenches like a flood,
The Frenchmen pour over Montmorenci's field,
And like grim furies from the infernal coast,
The cruel savage bands are straggling round.
[ Ti^ Indians yell] Hark!
They yell the tranq^^^ which they will soon enjoy
Amidst the scalping scene! we promise this,
Our friends once more rejoined, we'll rouse them to
Avenge your cause. Exeunt soldiers.

SCENE III.
Ma^e^t OCHTERLONY and PEYTON. ORCHTERLONY. Oh, my dear friend, ever it is too
late, be gone.
Peyton* persuade me not, for I am fixed as fate!
Watchful and fierce, as is the dragon said
To stand, and guard the bright hesperian tree;
So will I guard thee from the savage foes:
Perhaps some foe of manly sentiment,
By Providence directed, may approach;
At least, before I die, amongst the scalpers
I Will so read a gloomy scene of slaughter, and
Fall with thee amidst a glorious ruin!
An Indian yell, Ochterlony attempts to rise, (...) Peyton begins to lead his
fusee; the scene cl^ses (...) the mean time.
SCENE IV.
Enter Captain MACDONALD, with a party of Highlanders, and a dead body.
MACDONALD. Yonder I see an English officer.
Toward him speeds a band of savages;
He seems designed to stand on his defense,
Too great the odds! --
Three thither haste, and to his rescue fly!
Exeunt three Highlanders with drawn swords. Now onward with our fallen friend.
Exeunt omnes.
Re-enter three Highlanders, with drawn swords, and Mr. Peyton on one of their
shoulders, with his (...).
Peyton. Soldiers, I thank you for this timely rescue:
To what officer owe I this obligation?

First Highl. Capt. Macdonald, of Fraser's battalion,
Whose frown against the French nerves all our arms
With strength, and edges every sword, to hew
Him out the path to glory; he sent us:
We slew with pleasure to your aid, and fleshed
Our steel in every scalper we could reach.
An Indian yell, they all face about, and Peyton claps his (...) in his
shoulder. The Indians halt.
Peyton. Dare (...) not come! then bear me onward:
(...) ambuscide and murd^^ (...)
They never could face the uplift^^ (...) steel,
Nor^land he lightning of an English eye. Exeunt omnes.

SCENE V.
The Camp on POINT LEVI: Enter a SEA OFFICER, and a CALEDONIAN CHIEF. SEA
OFFICER. So Peyton is returned? but Ochterlony's lost?


Caledon. Chief. That is not certain: Mr. Peyton says,
He saw him with a Frenchman, standing near
The breastwork, and therefore he has hopes.

Sea Off. Heaven grant his hopes are true. --
But tell me Sir, what passed while they remained
Upon the field of battle?

Call. Chapter Whilst Ochterlony's bleeding heart glowed with
Undissembled love, (which none but friends can
Feel) and poured out salutary wishes
For his friend, Peyton, (like a bear growling
Over her wounded whelp) was swallowed up in
Friendly rage* and fiercely meditated
Great revenge, if any hand should rudely
Touch his Ochterlony.

Sea Off. Well worthy they the names of soldiers and
Of friends: -- What ensued?

Call. Chapter Not long they lay in pain, 'midst blood and carnage,
Ever two feil savages toward them came,
Whose cruel meins, and ireful eyes, declared
Their rugged souls never felt a tender thought,
Joined by a Gaul, as savage as themselves;
Th^se wounded Ochterlony several times,
(...) he unfortunately was unarmed,
And sa^ no ^^ie^dly weapon in his reach,
With which to deal the C^l^donian blow,
And like a dying lion, fall am^d^t
The slaugh^er of his ^^n^ers!

Sea Of. On, barbarous and inhuman! to wound
(...) mercy, and a prisoner! --
(...) p^oceed.

Ca^. Chapter He of their outrage to his friend complained:
Q^^ck as a spirit answers Merlin'^ call,
The magic sound roused Peyton from the earth;
(Who in his friend's danger forgot his own:)
He frowned in flame, and sent the leaden fate!
Death seized a savage, and he groa^'d his last!
His mate upon the Hi^ernian quick advanced;
They both fi^'d, both wounded were, yet both stood;
The savage fleshed his bay^^et in his side;
His fractur'd leg, and loss of blood forgot,
Peyton's left hand his next thrust parry'd well,
And flung wide off the sanguin'd point! whilst from
H^^ side his right a dagger drew, so well
The bold Hiberman played the steel, he sheathed
I^ in his cruel heart! and spurned the vanquin'd
Savage to the ground!

Sea Off. You fil^ my mind with pleasing wonder!


Cal^^. Chief. I tell you naught but truth; and more can add,
How French artillery on Peyton played,
Thundering applause, and roaring loud acclaim!
What further happened you already know.

Sea Off. But think you not we made a fierce attack
Upon the French?

Ca^^d. Chief. We did indeed -- and a horrid
Scene it was!
The be^^owing engine of the skies began
To growl! over the summit of the hill a
^^^omy horror lowr'd! and ^own the clouds poured
Their liquid torrents, and sheets of surph'rous
Flame; a prelude to that storm, which from the
French camp seen after roared in ponderous showr's
Of l^^d! High over-head the ethereal
Frapors broke; against our front the Gallic
Artificial thunder rolled! ^on every
S^^e our friendly infantry, and cannon,
Helped to make the rattling concert up!
(Cel^^^ial and terrestrial lightning mixed.)
The French artillery, and small arms, swept
Whole platoons away, and cut wide lanes of
C^rnage! among the landing troops and boats,
In ^^^ming showers, the countless bombs came down,
And in displosion made promiscous havoc?
So that th^o' floods of flame, and deluges
O: death, our men rushed on to battle!

Sea. Off. And did like men full well acquit themselves:
As well they might, when they had such a bright
Example set by Monckton, Wolf and Townshend,
To ro^se a noble emulation in
Their souls; and their different corpse were headed
By many other leaders brave, old in
Renown, and well accustomed to look death
And danger in the face.

C^l^d. Chief. We made the attack to let the Frenchmen see
We tear'd not death in any form, but might
As well have thought of plucking mountains up
(...) the roots, as of dragging Mootcalm and
(...) per force, against their wills, out of
(...) subterraneous caverns, or else, to

P^^^^ices of the rocks, for trench on
T^^^ch rose, dreadfully beyond each other,
And made a terrible gradation
In the (...), as if they meant to sleep with
Clouds for curtains to their deep entrenchments,
And doubted the common surface of the
Gl^be too low for safety.

(...) Off. Our Generals, at the disappointment, seem
Chag^in'd, but undismayed, and wait with fierce
Impatience for an opportunity*
To wipe the memory of this foil away;
When, as the sun blazes from an eclipse,
They may rise more terrible in a storm
Of vengeance, from this disaster, run their
Gloomy courses and set in Gallic blood.
I understand, as soon as possible,
They are resolved to storm the town, or force
Them to a battle distant from their trenches.

Caled. Chief. These are the leaders for me, and these our
Country will revere.
Like the well-fed stallion in the stall, when
He scents the female, at the alarm of war,
Their active souls grow restive; disdain the
Bounds by nature circumscribed, would break the
Stubborn dam, and through the battle wing their
Way, to wed dame honor in the bloody field.
We came not here to sleep our time away,
And then return, and then tell our friends we saw
Quebec and Montcalm's camp, from Levi's Point,
Made one attempt (which, like a flash of powder,
Vanished into smoke) and then grew tired of the siege.
Looking on his watch: Let us be gone, our duty calls, and that
Should never be neglected by a soldier,
But especially on hostile ground. Exeunt

SCENE VI.
POINT LEVI. WOLF, LEONATUS, BRITANNICUS and two CALEDONIAN CHIEFS, sitting in
a Tent. Wolf, [ with a letter in his hand, speaking and looking, as if partly
reading the letter.] Gentlemen;
From our worthy brother Amherst comes this
Advice; that as the distance 'twixt us is
So wide, and Montreal well garrisoned,
Dams up the road through which he needs must march,
And with his ^ow'r unaided, force a pass
Through then e^trenc^men^^, amb^^c^^^s, defiles,

Most advantageous po^ts; being well assured,
He of necessity must sight through a^l
The co^gr^gated force of Canada.
^^er he can effect a ju^cti^n with us;
He therefore thinks it necessary to
Inform us, 'twill be full la^e before he
Comes, if he arrives at all; especially
When he considers, how necessary
His presence is, where he now remains with
All his forces: He therefore recommends
Us to the care of Providence, trusting
In the goodness of our cause, and concludes
With strong assurance, he will join us if
It Is practicable.
Call Chapter If Sir Jeffery Amerst cannot join
Us with those gallant troops he leads (which we
Indeed could wish) let us not waste the short
L^^'d season in fruitless wishes, and a
Distant war, or grieve because the French by
U^ are not out-number'^; but let us, as
Has (...) been hinted, by some means gain
The Height of Abraham, and in Montcalm's
Sight invert their walls; no doubt' will ^o^ze the
Frenchm^n to a battle; and when the^ shall
Advance to fight, we w^^l upon ourselves

Wolf. Gentlemen!
I ^eel a mighty pleasure in my mind,
To see the forward dispositions of
Your souls, Which I oftimes in our other
Leaders have observed likewise, nor do the
Soldiers seem to want the ingredient
Necessary for my plan --
This day I Will call a council, wherein I
Will propose (and doubt not but 'twill meet the
Wished For approbation) that our army
Be ever night embarked in boats, with every
Necessary disp^sition for a
Battle, which boats shall row some miles beyond
Quebec, upon the tide, and when that tide
Returns, then wrapped in silence, and the gloom
Of friendly night, we'll gently downward glide
Upon the stream, and at the foot of that
Rough precipice, whose top communicates
With Abraham's Height, we'll land unseen, and
Up the stony steep we'll climb, 'till we have
Gaind the level summit, and when Aurora
Ushers over the hills the car of day, all
Ranged in order firm, and dread array of
War, we'll shout her such a welcome, as shall
Make Quebec's rocky base to tremble! and
Wake each Frenchman out of his lethargic
Dream of vain security!

Leonatus. This project suits my disposition well^
Methinks I can already see both fronts
In battle joined; and every soldier
Pressing onward to the goal of glory!
Now their white ensigns beaten down, are all
Bestain'd with Gallic gore, and wear a purple
Dye! [recollecting himself] the thought transported me.
But here upon my sword [drawing] I swear [kissing it]
I from
That field will never return, till victory
Is ours, or I Am born off with bleeding marks
Of honor. --

Britannicus. And on my sword [drawing his sword]
I swear [kissing it] with heart resolved,
And resolution firm to struggle for
The palm of victory, and if we fail,
I Will not think life worth care, to save it by
A forced retreat.

First Caledonian Chief, [drawing his sword.] By this good ^^ade I swear
[kissing hi^ sword] which never proved
Unfaithful to my arm, nor failed me in
The greatest need; I Will put it once more to
The noblest test, and through the thickest ranks
Of Gauls, will hew my way victorious,
And make it blaze a bright example to
My corpse, or fall that day, to be enrolled
In future annals, among the worthy
Warriors slain on Abraham's Height.

Second Caledonian Chief, [drawing his sword] I kiss [kissing his sword] this
burnished steel, in token of
My great reverence for a soldier's name;
And promise by my hope of future fame
In war, to make the foes of Britain feel
Its mortal weight; duty nerves my willing
Arm, and honor gives the blade an edge; with
This I Will strive to rouse my troops to action,
And at the head of my battalion rush
Toward Quebec, leaving to conquest: But
If retained at bay, by groves of bay'nets,
And showers of s^ot, we bear not down the thick
Obstructing ranks of Frenchmen, retreat we'll
Scorn, deal death for death; and make them (as at
Fontenoy) purchase mournful victory.

Wolf. [drawing his sword] Mine be the task to ratify the whole:
I likewise swear [kissing his sword] upon my sword, I Will (...)
For conquest in the face of danger;
If human resolution can effect
The same, victory shall be ours: we'll ravish
Her my friends to morrow! for if she is shy,
And seems about to quit us, we'll summon
All our manly strength, and fortitude of
Soul, arrest her forward steps, and pluck her
Back again; at least we can do this, earn
Honorable deaths, and fall amidst a
Monumental pile of glory, which we
Ourselves whilst living raised around us! and
Sampson like, drag with us to the grave who^e
Cohorts of our foes!
For vanquished, I will never more return.
Mon^calm! I come, armed with angry Britain's
Vengeance, to scourge European scalpers,
And Canadian savages, and stand
Thy rival in the fierc^st shock of battle! Exeunt omnes.

THE END OF ACT IV.
ACT V.
SCENE I.
MONTMORENCI, the FRENCH CAMP. MONTCALM and LEVI. MONTCALM. I HAVE just received
intelligence, that all
The English army is embarked in boats,
And one division is already swiftly
Rowed beyond Quebec; the rest by all their
Motions, seem inclined to follow them.

Levi. Then doubtless they will attempt to land so near
As possible;
Should we not, Sir, endeavor to oppose
And repel them, or give them a baneful
Welcome?

Montcalm. Of that I Have taken care. --
I Have ordered Monsieur Bougainville
To draw out two thousand from the camp, and
Watch their motions: He marches this way,
And will soon be here for orders.
French drums beat a march. He comes with hasty steps and pleasure in his looks.
Enter Bougainville, addressing himself to Montcalm. Sir, your orders are
obeyed:
I Have marched two thousand from the camp, men well
Resolved and ea^^er to per^orm the duty you impose.

Montcalm. It Is well Sir; --
May they answer ou^ b^st expectations.
Proceed you now, and lead these men to the
Banks of the river, and wait in ambush
For the landing of the British troops, and
Choose your posts as time and circumstances
Will permit, to the best advantage.
As they row up the river, be sure you
Upward march likewise; whenever they stop, then
Halt; if they fall down the stream, retreat with
Them, that in every sh^pe (like their evil
Genius) you may keep pace with them; and on
Their debarkation, be ready boldly
To receive them, in a shower of leaden
Vengeance, winged with flame.

Bougainv^lle. Be not afraid Sir, but we'll receive them
As we ought; for though they land, clothed in all
The terrors their boasted dreadful triple
Union can assume, I doubt not but we
Shall bring back with us, a good account of
These few aud^cious Britons. Going.

Montcalm. But mark me well, Sir, should they downward bend
Their course, and row as if they meant to reach
Quebec, or L^vi's Point again, then
Dispatch me word imm^diately, and with
Your main corpse follow the messenger to
The camp, with all the speed you can.
Exit Bougainville bowing. French troops beat a ma^^^.
Levi. Think you, Sir, Monsieur de Bougai^ville
Has troops enough with him, to repeal all
The British forces, should they attempt to land?

Montcalm. All things together weighed* I think he has*
He and his corpse h^ve often trod the ground,
And in the darkest night can measure out
Its distance well: No thought of am^ush can
Alarm them, they tread on friendly ground, and
Are you know sustained by savages, tra^n'd
Up to night adventures, and to lurkin^ fights:
These Britons never saw the ground, but at a
Distant view; and when they land, will tread at
Each uncertain step a hostile shore, and
Must come on in dread of pitf^lls, breast works,
Entrenchments, batteries, and ambuscades;
And when they shall receive the fire from our
Two thousand, their own fears, and the horrors
Of the night (full of black uncertainty)
Will multiply them to ten thousand strong.

Levi. From which I may presume you would infer,
They Will soon retreat back to their boats, or fall
A daring sacrifice, by a brik fire,
Kept up by our troops and friendly Indians.

Montcalm. I do infer no less: --
Yet policy suggests I should not march
The main body thither, least they evade
Us, and in the night ^^^^^ing, make good
Their landing at Montmorenci, and seize
Upon our camp untenable by few.
You Have not forgot the fierce attack they made
On all our troops, in their first bold attempt.
And this I have to observe, should Bougainville
Be put to rout by rage unparalled,
And their rough impetuous charge, they know
Each avenue and path, and safely can
Retreat, whilst we to sustain them march out
With all our force, oppose rage to rage, check
The furious ardor of their souls, and from
Their weary troops, ravish with ease the infant
Victory.

Levi. I Am satisfied, and cannot doubt success.


Montcalm. Let us to the camp repair, and put all
In order for an attack upon us,
Or an evacuation; these Britons
Are not to be despised: they surely are,
I fear, meditating some grand design.
The gathering storm must ever long fall somewhere;
And on that dubious hour the Gallic
Honor, Cana^ia's well, our own bright fame,
Britannia's enterprise, and Wolfe's rising
Glory hangs.
Whenever it falls, I Will face the lowering storm,
Let death put on the most tremendous form;
With Wolf I Will grapple for the laurel crown,
Though mighty fate against my purpose frown:
Yet if I fall, in death, it is some relief,
Britons were foes I fought, and wondrous Wolf their Chief!
[ A woody scene, as if on the top of a bill, or precipice; and as near to the
scene as possib^e, to make room for the more ample scene of the Height of
Abraham soon After.] [Colonel behind the scenes.] Advance briskly on them, my
brave fellows!
Climb that precipice, and close with the enemy!

A discharge of small arms and a shout. Enter several French soldiers
retreating before an English Council, at the head of some ^ight infantry: As
they run across the stage, scene draws, and discovers a larger view of the
Height of Abraham. SCENE II.
The HEIGHT of ABRAHAM: WOLF, LEONATUS, and BRITANNICUS, at the head of the
troops; they all shout. WOLF. At length we have gained an ample sooting on
This Height of Abraham (to which my soul
With ardent wish has long aspired) and are
Advanced upon the glorious edge of battle.
I will not ask my gallant soldiers, if
You're ready; the al^crity with which you
Have explored the gloomy winding of this
Ascent, and the brisk manner in which you
Clamber'd up, surmounting all obstacles,
Declare to me with greater certainty
Than words, you're ready.

Britannicus. Each lowering brow declares the resolutions
Of their hearts, and indicates the heroic
Workings of their souls; in every face
I read a warm imp^tience for the onset
As if they would say, why stand we here in cool
Deliberation? Let us to closest
Fight advance, our foes may see us frown, and
Mark each litted arm descending with the
Mortal blow, that we may hew through the front
Of their battle, and trample down their rear.

Leonatus. Who falls this day, may well be deemed great in
His death; and worthy of a British Patrio's name!
How much our absent and worthy friends of
Freedom will envy us each gloriou^ wound we feel!

Wolf. Oh! wh^^ a beaming blaze of victory,
Love and never d^^ng fame, will crown each
R^ch survivor'^ head! who helps this day to
Rout the numerous French, and scourge their scalping
Friends, (those bands of human brutes,) back to their
Lurking, ^^ns and native wilds again!
Now beat our drums, and sound each instrument
Of war, whilst we march onward to the field
Of fame. [Drums beat, instruments sound.]
Exeunt, beating a march.
SCENE III.
Scene draws, and discovers MONTCALM sitting in his Tent. Enter LEVI. Levi.
Sir, there is a rumor in our camp, that all
The English troops are ranging on the Height of
Abraham, if so, we may soon expect them here.

Montcalm. It cannot be! -- would they dare attempt it?
They cannot have eluded Bougainville's
Caution! -- He has not inadvertantly
Let them pass; and surely all our out-guards,
And sentinels, have not been wrapped in one
Fatal delusion, all conspiring to
Reta^d a timely notice of their landing.
Perhaps a desperate few have straggled
Thither, in order to amuse our troops,
(...) ^^^ike an unexpected blow:
Draw out a small detachment from the camp
Aga^^^t them.

Levi. Nay, had they every man they have brought against
Q^ebec on Abraham's freight, I should esteem
It out the forlorn hope of Britain.

Montcalm. Let my orders be executed, and
Bring me word immediately how matters go. Exit Levi.

Montcalm solus. If all their troops are there, they will gives us work
Enough his day to drive them thence, and prove,
I fear, a dear bought victory to France.
Re-enter LEVI, in more haste. Sir! I fear it will require our u^most
Efforts to repel the storm which threatens
Us! There Is scarce a man of all the English
T^oops, but now treads Abraham's Height! with head long
Rage they stumbled up the prec^pice! and
With Herculean fury, their bombardiers,
And sailors, d^ag up the arti^lery, and
With their light armed infantry, in equal
Pace they roll the brazen thunder onward!
They have already taken possession
Of the forts which guarded the ascent, and
Turned the guns upon our flying parties,
Who as they mingle with our forces, in
The out lines of our camp, spread terror.
Montcalm rising, ^na crawing his sword. Then now it is time to rouse, and stir
ourselves!
Let the crumbs beat to arms! and call forth all
The power within our camp; we'll onward march
To meet them; and before our walls, in presence
Of our friends, shall both our battles close. Exit Levi.

Montcalm solus. These Britons will compel us to hazard
All on e^ual footing on the plain, or
Force us tamely to sit down entre^ch'd and,
See Quebec by them beleaguered; but ever
They shall do that, death or victory, shall
Be mine.
This day the fates weigh Britain against Gaul;
Wolf, thou must bleed, or flee, or I will nobly fall. Exit.

[The French drums beat to arms.] SCENE IV.
[ Scene draws, MONTCALM and a FRENCH Officer at the head of his troops; the
French drums beating a march.] Montcalm. Halt.


Enter LEVI. Montcalm. Are all our Indians disposed of to the
Best advantage?

Levi. They are, Sir; --
And as fierce tigers from their covert, eye
The approaching kids and couchant lick their chaps,
Anticipating the delicious banquet;
They in their close ambush lurk, with furious
Expectation viewing the British troops,
Waiting for the welcome signal to fall
Upon their broken rear, or else pick up
The scattered remnant of their flying forces.

Montcalm. Since they seem to like the chase so well, I
Hope we'll give them sport enough ever long.
turning to the soldiers. Now my brave countrymen, remember you
Are to fight in the cause of Lewis, the
Well-beloved of his people; you fight
Likewise your country's battle; and I may
Add, many of you here fight for wives, and
Children, and possessions; and if any thing
Can wake your dormant rage, and kindle up
A flame of valor in your souls, all these
Considerations can.

French Off. Although their army's greatly thinn'd, and they
Can scarcely number full five thousand strong,
And we, (excluding all our savages,)
Can muster twice their tale, yet think not they
May be easily repelled; although we
Have no room to doubt of victory, if
We behave like men of spirit, who have
Their country's good at heart, yet march into
The field forewarned thus, with courage firm,
Boldly prepared for the severest trial
Of your manhood, and meet resolutely.
Expecting the impetuosity of their charge.

Montcalm. If you would acquit yourselves as soldiers should,
Who wish their King and country well, and long
Have t^u^^ed for an opportunity,
To slaunch your bleeding mother's wounds, and to
Retrieve her long lost honor; you must not
Think meanly of them, but call up all the man
Within your souls, and bravely blaze, absorbed
In valor's fame!
Intrepidly resolved, and s^ilful, are
Their leaders, and commanders; rough, fierce and
Veteran, are their soldiers; and in their
Defeat, great w^^'d be our fame!
Let us march to meet them.

WOLF, as the head of the troops; a march beating; and opposite, as from
MONTCALM 's camp, enter an (...) Officer, addressing himself to WOLF. Sir, I
came from reconn^^t^ing Montcalm's
Camp* where with all the haste they are masters of*
They Are arming, evacuating the tre^ches.
And forming on the plain; they seem inclined
To save us the trouble of forcing their
E^trenchments, and in a few minutes we may
Expect them here. Wolf, turning to the soldiers.
Now the completion of your wishes is
At hand! you no more shall pant for war, and
With impatience glow, chiding the ta^dy
Hours which rolled inactively away,
Nor shall you ask indignantly again,
When shall we meet and rush upon our foes?
And battle with them, bay'net to bay'net,
Sword to sword, front to front, and man to man?
They all shout, and several call out. Lead us on to glorious death* or victory!
To glorious death, or victory! lead us on!

An Officer advances from the rear. W^lfe. Is the artillery well advanced?

Offi^er. They have already gained the rear,
And t'wixt the flanks of different corpse, they are
A^vanci^g to the front with intrepid
(...), and ready to eject their mingled
Storm of le^d and iron, to deform the
(...) of war.

Wolf. When they have gained the front, (pregnant with fate)
Let our fulminating engines bellow
Britannia' salutation to the French;
'Midst which we will advance, careering in
The thunder storm.
Are all the corpse disposed of as I ordered?

Officer. Col'nel ^owe, and his light infantry, are
Dra^n in a semicircle round our rear, and
Left fl^nk, and form an offensive moving
^ulwark against the incu^^ions of such foes,
A^ may be lu^king in the adjacent coppie^,
Where doubtless all their Indians sculk:
Every other officer, and corpse, fill their
Stations in the field.

Wolf. Then we are ready for the onset:
Good Providence! be^rie^d us.

Officer. Whilst taversing the field, from rank to rank,
I found a s^mpathetic resolution
Spread from man to man; each l^ader glowing
With an indignant noble emulation
For glory* (^ith sparkling eyes, brimful of
Fierce delight, and steady countenance) strove
To animate his corpse, who stood alert:
And when the drum^ began to beat, joined with
The sh^ill (...), when the brisk c^an^o^s of the
Tr^mpets echoed through the ranks, and the deep
Thro^^ed cannons roared a dread prelude to
The battle, their generous souls ^ilated
With a warlike p^ide! then (^^ke Jo^'s war-horse)
They bid adi^u to ^ear, and with genuine
Freeborn ardor, eager for close action.
Joined in loud concert with the m^rtial grand
Enlivening melody* sending ^^rth the^r
Wo^ted cheering shout^ of exaltation!

Wolf [ (...) to the soldiers.] In view, before us lies
the plenteous field
Of martial glory, in which this day we

Let glory warm our emulating hearts,
Like men in Britain's cause, to play our parts:

Gleam of terror round!
And see, where every other corpse with
Bayonets fixed* to close engagement throngs!
Let us my friend among'em speed, and in
Their front rush foremost to their goal of glory!

Exeunt, in haste. [A shout of battle, Indians yelling.] Scene draws. LEVI and
a FRENCH OFFICER in disorder. Levi. The battle will be irretrievably
^^st, without a sudden turn!
General Montcalm, and others are wounded!
The wings give way! the main body is broke!

Officer. The Indians faintly squall their horrid yell
Of onset! and in their thick abushment
Riveted agape, they gazing stand as
Thunderstruck!

Levi. Heavens! that such a handful of men should work
So much confusion!
Run!
Rally the broken troops, and make them stand;
Whilst I head and spirit up the main corpse,
'Till Bougainville's reinforcement arrives.

Exeunt severally, in haste. [Montcalm brought in by two, his thighs wrapped up
and bloody.] Montcalm. Each Englishman this day behaves, as if
He wore Medusa's head! with Gorgon frowns
They look some Frenchmen pale and stiff with horror!
Whilst with averted looks, others retreat
With a Mercurial speed!

1 st. Soldier. Wherever they face, our troops retreat;
Or else they pierce and hew a lane of caruage out.

2 d. Soldier. Our army dares as far as men can do:
But who can stand the charge of these
Impetuous Britons!
The day is the^^s! Quebec must fall!

Montcalm. And Canada is lost! -- Alas my country*
As the roaring thunder, on the rapid
Wings of keen lightn'ing, bursts resistless through
The sturdy oaken grove, scorches, and rives,
And lays its stubborn honors low, to the
Furious Britons break through our thickest c^^ks!
And as a cold blight nips tender blossoms,
The fierce Wolf blasts all the former honors
Of my life! he tears with greedy hand the
Fading laurels from my head! and ^ises
Into glory, whilst in disgrace I set!
Bear me into Quebec. Exeunt.

For though my spirit is resolved, yet the
Poignant torments, and expense of blood, roll
Cooling tremors to my heart, and weigh frail

For in a total rout the foe is fled:

Never was victory more complete!

S^e^e ch^n^es to LOND^N. SOPHR^NIA's House: Enter S^PHRONIA, and a GENTLEMAN.
Gentleman. Madam there is a report in town, Quebec
Is taken.

Sophronia. How comes the news?
I might expect to have heard as soon as
Any: Heaven grant all is well. --

Gent. I hear there is an expres^ arrived to
His Majesty.

Soph. An express arrived! [sighing] and is it possible
My son can have forgotten me! -- m^ heart
Forbodes all is not well with him -- [sighing] know you
The particulars? [ flutter'^]

Gent. Madam, I could not obtain a knowledge
Of them.

Soph. That was unkind indeed not to enquire;
The friendship that has so long time subsisted
Between you, and all the fond endearments
Of your youth together, methinks should have
Prompted you to gain a recital from
The messenger, of all concerned my son.
I should have had a thousand fond queries,
And dwelt with rapture on his bravery,
Listening with delight to the melodious
Tale of honor.

Gent. Too much I know. Aside.

To her. I have inquired, but could not get the whole
Intelligence.

Sophronia aside. His solemn looks, like to black gathering clouds
Preceding a thunder storm, seem to me
The dismal harbingers, to warn me of
The approaching storm of grief!
To him. Learnt you any thing, Sir! [eagerly.]
Oh! tell me, tell me! [sighing]

Gent. I learnt your son gave the Frenchmen battle
Before Quebec, in which he several wounds
Received, but still rushed fearless onward to
The goal of glory, heaping new honors
Upon those already gained, and at length
Obtained the hard disputed victory:
The dubious conflict en^ed, Quebec fell
To the conquerors.

Soph. Alas! there is more to follow; -- and I fear
This great encomium on his valor,
Is like an opiate that is given to a
Patient, to lull him to repose; but when
The dormiant draught is evapourated,
And the gentle slumber wears away, he
Awakes in torments exquisite again.
Forgetting the short respite of his woe.
Wounded you said! and slain I fear -- [weeping] could be
Not write to me?

Gent. His wrist was broken, Madam*

Soph. He had a tongue! -- [sighing] His secretary then
Could write. -- Aside.
He makes such vain evasions, surely my
My son is lost -- [weeping.]

To him. Will you go in and stay dinner with us?
Let me know the wo^^^, I beg Sir, -- for this
Anxiety is insufferable! -- Exeunt.
SOPHIA sola, in SOPHRONIA's Parlour. Enter to her a servant. Madam, my
mistress will wait on you immediately.

Exit. Sophia sola. A gloom hangs on the countenance of all
I meet here, and with a fatal presage
Fills my soul. -- Be still my heart, -- nor pine at
The decrees of fa^e: Now summon all thy
Resolution, to hear the unwelcome tale,
From whence to date the era of thy grief.

Enter SOPHRONIA. Sophia. Madam I took the liberty to wait
On you, in hopes of having the pleasure
To wi^h you joy of your good news from Quebec.

Soph. I Am obliged ^'ve M^dam, for this freindly
Visit. -- but have no room to hope for joy.
[Sophia* aside] Has she no room to hope for joy! -- then what
Have I to fear! [sighing]

To her. Pray, Madam, what intelligence arrived?


Soph. I have not seen the Gentleman who brought
The express, nor received a letter, but I
Have great reason to guess by what I Have heard,
Could the lofty sounding name of honor
Give a mournful parent any joy, from
The gallant expl^its of my son, perhaps
I might some pleasure feel, and boast he fell
A British Patriot.

Sophia. Is he then sl^in! -- Ah me! --
And was my happines^ so fleeting!

Soph. If your happiness, Madam* is centered
In my son, fleeting it may be; for I
Fear he is no more. [weeps.]

S^ph. Then farewell all the goodly treasure of
Felicity, which my fond soul had in
Expectation hoarded up. -- Oh how often
In fancy had I been clasped within my
Hero's arms! and dwelt with vast pleasure on
His tales of danger; whilst my listening ears
Methought, were sweetly ravished with the loud
Exulting shouts of his glade countrymen,
And friends: to welcome him victorious to
His native shore! -- But now sad reverse
Of fortune threatens me -- [weeps.]
Enter a GENTLEMAN, addressing SOPHRONIA. Madam, here is a Gentleman Officer
Without, from Quebec, desires to speak with you.

Soph. Be pleased, Sir, to introduce him. Exit Gentl.
A palpa^a^ion seizes on my heart!
A cold tr^mor r^ns through every vein; the
Direful agitation both of soul and
Body, boarders on a fo^d delirium.
Oh what tender anguish! what racking woe,
Unspeakable, careful timorous mothers
Feel for their dear offspring! Children of their
Youth; and sweet pledges of connubial love!

Enter OFFICER and the GENTLEMAN. Officer to Sophronia* [hearing and looking
serious] Madam* I am from Quebec.


Soph. So I learn, Sir* -- Is all well there? eagerly,


Officer. [ as^^^] She must know it.


To her. Madam* your son is co^q'ror; he has gained.
Universal love, esteem, and never
Dying fame!

Sophia [aside] That welcome sound would almost lift my soul
To heaven, did not his gloomy countenance
Fill it with c^bious fears and clog its flight.

Soph But does he live? -- Shall I again in these
Fo^d arms infold the staff of my age; and
To my bosom press the darling of my
Soul; bedew his manly cheeks with tears of
Joy; and listen with a parent's pleasure,
Whilst be recounts his wounds, his dangers and
His b^ttles? -- But oh! I tear such joy is
Not in s^ore for me -- [weeps.]

Sophia. aside, weeping My sad soul can sympathize with here is in
Silent sorrow.

Gent. I Have this to add, before the battle closed,
Your son was wounded in the breas^, and
Carried from the line.

Soph. [weeping] Too true my fears are come to pass: Go on.
Sir; for I am prepared to hear the worst.

Sophia. [aside, weeping.] My throbbing heart anticipates his tale.


Office^. The wound he then received was dangerous,
And your son is --

Soph. [ has^^^] Oh, say not he i^ dead! --


Officer. Madam he is -- and nati^n^ mourn his fall.

[Sophronia faints, and a^ls into the arms of the Gentleman, who sets her in a
(...), placed the^e for ^h^t purpose. Sophia seeming^y regardless of the whole,
and (...) in dumb sorrow.]
Gent. Who waits there!


Enter a woman servant to assist. Soph. [ ^ecovering after a short time] Cruel
generosity!
Oh! Why by your offi^ious ca^e have you
Awakened me from the sweet delusion?
My soul was on the wing into the world
Of spirits blessed, to meet and hold in an
^ternal clasp, his much loved filia^ sh^de.

Sophia. The ball which took his l^fe, consigned my heart
To woe.

Officer to Sophia. To say you should not grieve for such a loss,
Would be to change all nature's order.

To Sophronia. Not to sympathize with you, Madam, would
Indicate a most unfeeling soul: Your
(...) wa^ all a son^ mother could desire,
Or a tender virgin wi^h. -- Yet in the
^^ying v^ctor's fall, th^re's consolation.
Beyond the common rank of men his name
Shall live, and in Britannia's patriot
Let, ^ha^l sh^ne with a superior blaze: He
Nobly died! And as he for his country
^ell, he left you ^ull of honorable
Gri^f* arrayed with solemn dignity of
Gl^rious woe.
[Turning to the audience.] Should France again Europe in broi's engage,
And dare to rouz^ the dormant lion's rage;
Methinks I see your souls around me glow
With flame indignant, against ^h' infidious foe!
Like sons of freedom to maintain your cause,
Nobly to save wives, children, I n^s and ^aws,
To glory's goal what B^i^on would not fly!
To fall like Wolf, who would not ^ish to die!
Who would not fight the treaty breaking G^ul*
When George, and liberty, and martial honor call!

FINIS.
