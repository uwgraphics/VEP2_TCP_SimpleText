CHRISTIAN SONGS.
SONG I.
BLESSED be the day, Fair Charity,
When, with a SAVIOR'S name,
On earth with blooming grace adorned,
A heavenly guest you came.
2 Born of no man, to none on earth
Thy heavenly birth thou owes:
Sprung from thy GOD, in thy bright charms
His glorious image glows.
3 True as the object to the glass,
With him you wake your fire;
Frown when he frowns, hate what he hates,
And what he loves, desire.
4 On every chosen human breast,
Thou stamp'st with work divine,
The form of GOD, and bid'st a heaven
In every bosom shine.
5 The beggar basking in thy beams,
Forgets his miseries:
Hark! lonely widows sing to thee,
And shouts from orphans rise.
6 Diffuse thy beams, and teach my heart
With genial warmth to glow:
For lo, without thy heavenly aid,
In vain my numbers flow.
7 Could I with elocution speak,
Transcending human tongue;
And could I sing in strains more sweet
Then ever angel sung;
8 And did not Charity inspire,
And raise herself my voice,
My flowing verse were empty sound,
"My eloquence were noise."
9 Yea, had I faith to weary racks,
And pass unhurt through flame;
And did not Charity inspire,
My labors were in vain.
10 It Is love which plumes the wings of Hope,
And bids her strength exert;
Which brings our faith from sound to things,
From fancy to the heart.
11 A time shall come, when constant Faith
And patient Hope shall die;
One lost in certainty of sight,
"And one dissolved in joy."
12 But thou shall last, when these no more
Shall warm the pilgrim's breast,
Or open on his dying eyes
His long-expected rest:
13 Thy unextinguish'd ray shall burn
Through death, unchanged thy frame:
Thy lamp shall triumph over the grave
With uncorrupted flame.
14 The divine lover and his spouse
To rest thy lamp shall light,
Profuse with heavenly bliss divine,
And pregnant with delight.
SONG II.
BEHOLD divine free Grace arise,
Outshining all the thoughts of man!
Sovereign, preventing, all surprise
To him who neither willed nor ran;
2 Grand as the bosom whence it flowed
Kind as the heart that gave it vent,
Rich as the gift which GOD bestowed,
And lovely like the Christ he sent.
3 Did the imperial law of Death,
For one man's sin, his whole race doom,
And all who draw the human breath,
Though sinning not like him, inhume!
4 Even here the sovereign sway of Grace
Shines with superior power to save,
Than sin to damn, which doomed the race
To one wide universal grave.
5 Sin reigned to Death; but over Sin
And Death, with more imperial sway,
Grace spreads her more extensive reign,
And does eternal life convey.
6 Grace, by a righteousness, does reign,
Wrought in the bloody death of God;
Where Sin is spoiled; so Grace does reign
In all the worth of divine blood.
7 Since Sin first slew the human race,
An host of daily sins pursues
Man to a second death; but Grace
Steps sovereign forward, and rescues;
8 Life more abundant we possess
O second man! than Adam lost;
An earthly prospect crowned his bliss;
We reigning heavenly pleasures boast:
9 And as our GOD'S obedience, free,
And blood divine, excel by far
Man's due, abstaining from one tree;
So great's the life thy children share.
10 We, bowing, sing thy death, so strong
As all our souls from death defends:
Shout, ye redeemed; for hear your song
Begins, and never never ends.
SONG III.
SHALL earth-born man with GOD contend,
To him his parts display;
Hold his dim beaming reason up,
And rival his full day?
2 Formed by his hand, so might a bowl
Against the potter speak;
Ask why for baser use designed,
Why fitted up to break?
3 Did God thy reason frame, to tax
His attributes divine;
Or was it to insure his wrath,
And make damnation thine?
4 Do men presumptuous rush on God,
With guilt deformed, and foul;
Ask for that favor they deserve,
And bid his thunder roll?
5 Speak not of worth, nor cloud his grace,
But let his mercy shine:
Mercy's a stranger to thy worth,
All sovereign, all divine!
6 He wills, for why? because he wills,
To save the sinking soul:
Nor can the whole creation's pow
His sovereign will control.
7 Hail! sovereign Grace, divinely bright,
Beneath whose ample wing,
The guilty myriads raise their voice,
The angelic myriads sing!
8 Sin's in the picture, but the shade,
To make thy features rise
In all the charms of God, and show
The Almighty to our eyes.
9 When awful justice threatening, flames
With unauspicious ray;
Thou take the sinner by the hand,
And wip'st his tears away:
10 For thee a thousand songs await,
A thousand ages shine,
Start forth to view, and cry aloud,
Eternity is thine.
SONG IV.
PRAISE ye JEHOVAH'S love and grace
To Adam's guilty wretched race;
Sing of this love, the spring and rise
Of all his counsels, great and wise.
2 For all his works, his creatures all,
Their being and original
Owe to this love; and there, again,
They tend, as rivers to the main.
3 What else is evil but the shade,
By wisdom in the picture laid,
To make this grace arise, and show
Its brightest glory to our view?
4 Our GOD is love; his wrath, be sure,
Is flaming love, which shines most pure;
And stands opposed, as midday light
To gloomy darkness of the night.
5 This goodness, as a deep abyss,
All working outward, full of bliss,
Was making for itself a vent
Well suited to its vast extent;
6 By which it might with freedom flow,
And all its fullness there bestow,
Where it should have an endless rest:
God's wisdom here prevents our quest.
7 What is capacious to receive
Unbounded love, if bounds it have?
Or where is found an object meet
For grace and mercy infinite?
8 Not all the things which could be made,
A proper match among them had
For boundless love, which goes not forth
To objects limited in worth.
9 Neither can all created things
Pass for its fruit (the gift it brings)
When the intention is to show,
By giving, all that grace can do:
10 Nor yet could sin-forgiving grace,
Among all the creatures find a place,
While all was good, no room could be
For mercy's aid to misery.
11 But Love, which is the only God,
Had always being and abode,
Whole in each one of loving Three,
All blessed in Love's society.
12 One of these Three, with all his worth,
To union near with men goes forth;
So joined to them, that, in his name,
A right to all this love they claim.
13 But, first, they are doomed for sin to woe,
That he for them might undergo
Their curse, and so might fully prove
The infinite jealousy of Love:
14 And at the same time manifest
Mercy relieving the distressed;
Mercy, all sovereign, and all free,
Saving from boundless misery.
15 He Is unto them the fruit of love,
The gift which can its greatness prove;
And every gift which grace bestows
Is GOD-like as from him it flows.
16 And he is the object; it goes forth
On them made perfect in his worth;
All built in him, one mansion meet,
Where God's love ever dwells complete.
17 Let Wisdom, therefore, be his name;
The spring of wisdom him proclaim:
Call him the Word, who can express
God's goodness all, and fully bless.
18 Call him the Father's only Son,
Son of his love; in him alone
The Spirit's fullness all can dwell,
Who is our great Immanuel.
SONG V.
FOOLS worship gods who hate not sin,
Nor saving power have:
Our God, the living and the true,
Can both be just and save.
2 The just God and the Savior, is
His character alone:
His throne is fixed in righteousness,
And Grace reigns on the throne.
3 Man's life, which in God's favor lies,
Is stung to death by sin;
All his attempts to heal himself,
The deadly sting drive in:
4 That God who wounds, alone can heal
The mortal wound he gave:
In Jesus, dead and raised, we see
God's power and skill to save.
5 Have thou to buy the just God's grace?
Or know thou what to give?
First Justice slew his only Son,
Ere Grace could make us live.
6 Know, then, on no precarious ground
Stand Grace and Life to men;
For life now reigns in God's dear Son,
For us by Justice slain.
7 This is the only true God; this
Is life eternal, sure:
Then, little children, keep yourselves
From every idol pure.
SONG VI.
Part I.
ETERNAL love's the darling song,
Well-pleasing to JEHOVAH'S ear;
Attend, ye saved, ye pardoned throng,
With all your grateful harps drawn near:
2 It Is yours to sing the eternal date
Of love divine, and how it moves
To helpless man, with gladness great:
Sing loud, for God the song approves.
3 Hail, Bethleh'm! hail! that ruddy morn,
Whose rays adorn the infant God,
JEHOVAH of a virgin born,
Who righteousness and life bestowed.
4 For us salvation wide displays
Her ample all-refreshing wing;
Safe in the shade, that love we praise,
And all its peerless glories sing:
5 We sing the garden and the tree,
Red with the blood which cries for peace;
Heaven echoes back, I Am pleased in thee;
And Wrath to Mercy now gives place.
6 From this dread object flows our joy,
Here all the majesty and worth,
And love of God, without alloy,
In brightest splendour do shine forth.
7 We sing a note that high prevails,
Above the angels free from sin;
Who cannot taste the cure which heals
The deadly smart of wrath divine.
8 As food the hungry soul relieves,
As choice perfumes delight the smell;
So Mercy from the cross revives
Man sinking in the jaws of hell:
9 The wonders of Christ's blood arise
Bright in the drooping wretches view:
Astonished with the dear surprise,
His joyful transport who can show?
Part II.
THY love, O Jesus! is a theme
Which never never old shall grow,
All ages of the church proclaim
How sweetly did its numbers flow:
2 Down from the birth of infant Time,
Through Eve, Abra'am, and David's line,
Thy love does run in strains sublime,
And running with new glories shine;
3 Till thou wast sound a babe, O God!
When angels thronged to join our lay;
Until thy love, in streams of blood,
Did all its wealthy store display.
4 At thy ascent, the spacious heaven
All round re-echo'd with this theme,
When from the throne the word was given,
"Let all the angels praise his name."
5 At thy return, eternal fame
From all the saints shall sound to thee,
On banks of Eden's cheering stream,
Beneath the life-restoring tree.
Part III.
THY love makes us count all things los
To scorned poverty gives charms;
Makes martyrs bold even on the cross,
And, singing triumph, reach thy arms.
2 When thy love glows upon the heart,
Disgrace forgets her shocking name,
Afflictions lose their deadly smart,
And Patience smiles amidst the flame;
3 Salvation sounds from racks and stakes,
Hope blunts the sword's devouring edge;
Severest torture joy partakes,
Of heavenly bliss the welcome pledge.
4 Broad heaven and earth shall sing of thee,
And their melodious numbers raise:
We'll make thy name rememb'red be,
The eternal center of all praise.
5 Sing all ye bright angelic powers;
Ye sons of Mercy, praise your King;
The burden of the song is yours:
Let wide creation chorus sing.
6 And, O! to join that heavenly strain,
Admit poor us, who say no more,
But, Jesus died, and rose again;
And all our toil for life is over.
SONG. VII.
DESCEND, fair Hope (though heavenly born
Thou visit'st human race),
And let us in thy sacred glass
Survey our Savior's face.
2 Let songs for ever crown that morn,
When, new to life again,
Immanuel rose, and sent thee down,
Full fraught with life to men.
3 Though man, in Eden, was of old
With heavenly visits blessed;
More happy they to dwell with whom
Descends this heavenly guest:
4 For them a fairer Eden shines,
And on their wondering eyes
The riches of their smiling God
In larger prospects rise.
5 Led by thy hand, celestial Hope,
How often, at thy desire,
Has man encountered shame and want,
Nor shrunk to pass through fire?
6 See, gazing on the ample joys
Which wait a happier day,
How the pale famished visage smiles,
And poverty looks gay!
7 O happy they whose dying eyes
By thy blessed hands are sealed!
In hope of life they sleep, and wake
To see that life revealed.
8 Let others bound their life, and joys,
In what is to earth confined:
Take wing, ye saints, and soar with Hope
To pleasures more refined;
9 Where Jesus waits to crown your flight
With transport in his face,
And where the eternal arms unfold
To meet your dear embrace.
10 But what is Hope, and what is Faith?
But fainter stars of night,
To guide the pilgrim through the shade,
Till dawns the morning light.
11 O! let the morning star arise,
And usher in the day
With brighter beams; then paler lights
And shadows fly away.
SONG VIII.
WHERE shall the guilty who has lost
The divine favor by his sin,
Find worth, which he can safely trust,
A righteousness to glory in?
2 How calm his guilty conscience' fears?
What shall he work, what shall he feel?
He wearies heaven with prayers and tears:
But, ah! there is something lacking still.
3 Behold the cross! the blood divine
Which there for sons of wrath was spilt!
Here Is worth enough to glory in,
Enough to purge the foulest guilt.
4 When fond experiences are gone,
All frames and feelings blown to air,
The cross remains your boast alone;
For all your righteousness is there:
5 Is guilt your burden? from the cross
Springs glorious liberty to you:
Or would you worldly lusts oppose?
The cross victorious stands to view.
6 Would ye like Jesus shine, when he
In glory comes the second time?
Mark well his aspect on the tree;
Take up the cross and follow him.
SONG. IX.
MELCHIZEDECK, immortal priest!
Over peace and righteousness does reign,
O Most High God, before thy face,
And glory fills the blessed domain:
2 For now the strife is at an end,
'Twixt sinners, righteous God and thee,
How thou should make the guilty blessed
Yet just and righteous herein be.
3 To end this strife God interposed,
His dread and solemn oath: He swore,
To consecrate the only Son
Of God a priest forever more.
4 With sacrifice his hand was filled,
In God's own presence to appear,
With blood divine shed from himself,
Most precious, and forever dear.
5 No more a sinful mortal priest,
With dying breath for sin atones;
Nor stands confessing his own guilt,
Nor dies succeeded by his sons:
6 No more the blood of bulls and goats
Sprinkles the earthly holy place;
No more in tinsel'd glory stands
A sinful mortal begging grace.
SONG X.
TO thee, O Jesus! is my prayer
Who mankind by thy death have saved,
And to the holiest of all
A new and living way have paved.
2 Rescue me from myself, O Lord;
Break Satan's power within my soul;
And let not worldly lusts me rule,
But by thy spirit them control.
3 Though red as crimson are my sins,
Thy blood can make them white as snow;
If thou but speak the word, then straight
My soul shall vanquished see its foe.
4 Most precious Faith, thou purchased have,
And love which never fades away,
And Hope which soars on swiftest wing,
Breathing for everlasting day.
5 Teach me thou meek and lowly One,
To learn of thee this world to scorn,
Thy cross to make my only boast:
Humility let me adorn.
6 Let faith of things not seen as yet,
And fear of evils slow but sure,
And love of truth, and hope of bliss
Unmerited, my soul secure.
SONG XI.
THANKS to that love, which gave us God
To bleed, to purge our sin;
Who in the worth of his own blood,
The heavens has entered in;
2 And to the holiest of all
Has consecrate a way,
To enter through the rended vail,
And grateful worship pay.
3 Here ends all search, our God to please;
We'll work for life no more:
This blood gives every conscience ease;
It Is balm for every sore.
4 Blessed are the people who are taught
By sovereign Grace to stand;
In righteousness they have not wrought,
Nor touched it with their hand.
5 Turn, every wounded conscience, here
Our bleeding God survey:
God from the glorious sufferer:
Has turned his wrath away.
6 Here Is access to the Father's face
Through Jesus' wounds and blood:
At the blood-sprinkled throne of Grace
Adore the living God.
SONG XII.
PART I.
GOD's mercies we will ever sing,
And tell the wonders of his grace:
Eternal love, we'll view thy spring,
The marvels of that love rehearse.
2 Forever hallowed be thy name,
Fair Mercy in the blood of God;
Sweet to the soul which feels the pain
Of guilt, the intolerable load.
3 Sinners behold our suffering God;
See! with you cry his soul is gone:
View him, by wrath divine pursued,
Until he loudly cries, It Is done!
4 Extol that Grace, ye saints, which gave
The spotless holy one and just,
To devils rage and to a grave:
And mixed with blood of God the dust.
5 His soul with dreadful anguish filled
Unutterable torments felt;
His conscience pure became defiled
With sin, and made his heart to melt.
6 What wonder then, if through his love,
Our souls now purged from every stain,
Partake the peace of God, and prove
In us, that Christ died not in vain?
7 O Jesus! now how mercy flows!
What blotting out of sin is here!
God to thy wounded conscience shows
No mercy, till 'its fully clear
8 Of all our horrid guilt, made thine;
Until thy unexampled love,
Thy blameless innocence divine,
And bloody death that guilt remove.
9 Mercy was far, dear Lord, from thee,
When God frowned on thy parting soul;
When in thy latest agony,
His wrath into thy heart did roll.
10 O God! thy wrath o'erwhelmed thy Son,
And pierced that soul most dear to thee,
That sinners unto thee might come,
The chief of sinners such as we.
Part II.
SINNERS of every tribe behold
The price of every kind of sin,
God's various wrath and manifold,
For various guilt met all on him.
2 What millions' sins that death atones!
When God himself in blood expired,
A whole burnt-offering, at once
The whole of what our God required.
3 Behold ye hypocrites the man,
Even in the eye of God, sincere;
Ye covetous behold him, than
The fox have less, or birds of the air.
4 Ye who seek honor and a name
See Christ's mock-robe, and crown of thorn;
Whom angels worship filled with shame,
A mock-king, in contempt and scorn.
5 Proud self-conceited sinner see
His spirit lowly, meek, and mild:
Malicious, stand condemned, when ye
See Jesus made a little child.
6 Ye who love pleasures, hear his cries,
Behold his agony how great!
See falling from him to the ground,
Like heavy drops of blood, his sweat.
7 Backsliders wonder at this grace,
And blush to think how Jesus stood
Unshaken, crying in your place,
Why have thou left me, O my God!
8 He shrunk not in that fatal hour,
When our accursed backslidings all
Overwhelmed his soul replete with love,
And filled his bitter cup with gall.
9 MERCY's the guilty sinner's plea,
In its Almighty broad extent!
Sweet to our souls forever (...)
The grace, which gave that mercy vent.
10 O may that mercy to the end
Be ours, which all the saints do claims;
Which, how we share, is all explained,
When we O Jesus! know thy name.
SONG XIII.
WHEN this great world was framed of God,
And earth carved out for our abode;
When all these orbs their course began,
And in harmonious order ran;
2 When God had laid the cornerstone,
And rested in his works now done;
The morning-stars together sang,
The heavens with tuneful echoes rang.
3 The sons of God a shout did raise,
To see the fabric speak his praise;
The powers of fire, of light, and air,
Expressed his godhead every where.
4 But chiefly in the cornerstone,
In man, his image brightest shone:
A creature, fit to take delight
With him in all his works of might.
5 But, ah! this harmony ever long
Stopped short. -- Sin entered -- marred the song:
Infected first the corner-head,
Then quick through all the building spread.
6 No human skill could ever avail
This freting leprosy to heal;
No creature's blood, no mortal priest,
Could purge away the noxious pest;
7 Dread ruin, louring from on high,
With all her bolts of wrath, drew nigh;
Till that blessed day, decreed of heaven,
When from the dead to us was given,
8 The Lord in human likeness, made
More fit the works of God to head,
Then any being could be found
In all the wide creation round.
9 This glorious Immanuel
With wretched man vouchsafed to dwell,
Took on himself our leprosy,
And felt its worst malignity:
10 Shut out from God, and Isr'el's camp,
His spirit felt a fearful damp:
With our plagues filled, a loathsome cup
Was given to him; -- he drank it up.
11 This draught, envenomed with the curse,
Soon left him breathless on the cross;
The blood gushed from his peirced side,
And first himself it purified.
12 Then having sprinkled every stone,
He, as head-corner was laid on:
Thus, of God's temple every whit,
Speaks forth his praise, in Christ complete.
13 Two guiltless birds were captive led
To paint this truth; the one was bled;
One dipped in blood, to heaven let loose:
That blood restored the unhallowed house.
14 The whole creation evermore
Stands now more glorious than before,
Knit by a cornerstone, through which
No evil can the building touch.
15 Ye morning-stars renew your notes,
Triumphing over all Satan's plots,
In concert with the church of God,
Who show the worth of Jesus' blood.
16 Sin's but a pause put in your song,
To make the following notes more strong;
The Just, the Savior, shines more bright
Than in the fire, the air, the light.
SONG XIV.
THIS is the day the first ripe sheaf
Before the Lord was waved;
And Christ, first fruits of them who slept,
Was from the dead received;
2 In name of all for whom he died,
That after him they may
Rise when he comes, a harvest full
Of life that lasts for aye.
3 And, as the truth of the first fruits,
The Spirit came, this day
Of that glad feast, a comforter
With us on earth to stay;
4 An earnest of the inheritance,
Even that same heavenly rest,
Where Jesus entering, has from thence
Us with the first fruits blessed.
5 Then let us keep the day of rest:
Our works for us are done:
The seventh day Sabbath is no more;
The earthly rest is gone.
6 To the heavenly rest let us follow him,
Whose death has paved the way;
And, with the whole creation, groan
For that redemption-day.
SONG XV.
THY worthiness is all our song,
O Lamb of God! for thou wast slain;
And by thy blood bought'st us to God,
Out of each nation, tribe, and tongue;
To our God made us kings and priests.
And we shall reign upon the earth.
2 Salvation to our God, who shines
In face of Jesus on the throne,
The only just and merciful:
Salvation to the worthy Lamb,
With loud voice, all the church ascribes;
Amen! say angels round the throne.
3 To him who loved us, and washed
Us from our own sins in his own blood,
And who has made us kings and priests.
To his own Father and his God,
The glory and dominion be
To him eternally. Amen!
SONG XVI. This Song refers to the Lord's Supper.
.
IN this one act redemption shines!
In all its parts complete;
Eternal Love! all thy designs
Here viewed at once do meet.
This shows the covenant of peace
Firm sealed, and ratified:
Here opens all that store of grace
By which we are justified.
3 Here God invariably Just
And holy does appear;
Here he shines forth the Jealous God,
Who clearing does not clear.
4 Great God! did ever thy Justice shine
With such unsullied flame,
As when the Son of God for sin
A sacrifice became?
5 When we this broken body see,
And this shed blood behold;
Though vile, O holy God! to thee
Approaching, we are bold.
6 For now, thy throne, sirnam'd of grace,
No longer does affright:
Thy satiate Justice now gives place
To Mercy thy delight.
7 Because the all-worthy Son of God
His brethren's flesh put on;
And their whole guilt (a dreadful load)!
Accounted as his own.
8 Each sin of theirs' filled his pure soul
With agonies of shame;
To purge their souls, which were most foul,
And clear them from all blame.
What anguish must the Father's wrath
Give such a loving Son!
The blot of guilt was double death
To this most holy One:
Conscious of all his brethren's sins,
Before the righteous God
He groans: his sweat falls to the ground,
Like heavy drops of blood.
11 God saw our guilt collected meet
On Jesus in our name;
His fury burnt with fervent heat,
His jealousy did slame;
12 At once, to show his vengeance just,
He summoned all his wrath;
Indignant glory rose; he cursed,
And frowned the Lord to death.
13 This spreads our table, fills our cup,
Salvation without bound!
The frown is past! -- Now joy's laid up
Our suffering God to crown!
14 Shall ever the vilest sinner, clad
In all his worth, Great God!
Be damned? No. -- Thou can never forget
The cry of Jesus' blood.
SONG XVII.
SAY, Faith, who bleeds on yonder tree?
Know thou that visage marred and torn?
My Lord, my God! Ye angels, see
Your dread Creator crowned with thorn!
2 Step nearer; view these ghastly wounds!
See how his yearning bowels move!
See how his breaking heart abounds
With streaming pledges of his love!
3 Lord! what are we, that we are loved
Till wrath pour on thee all its storms?
Thou grasp'st us fast in death unmoved;
Nor hell can tear us from thy arms.
4 Hark! ah! that mournful loud complaint!
To his forsaking God he cries!
His horrors shake the earth! lo! rent
The vail! the sun in darkness dies.
5 With horror, nature, see thy God,
Who bade thee be, groan and expire!
Mourn sun; at his almighty nod
Thy beams shot first refulgent fire.
6 Astonished earth with trembling shook;
Rocks' dreadful bosoms burst and rend;
The holy elect angels stoop;
And all in silence wait the end.
7 Justice divine! for all we owe,
Though sums immense are multiplied,
A broad discharge, blood-seal'd, we'll show:
"'It Is finished!" Jesus said, and died.
SONG XVIII.
THOUGH loads of guilt oppress my soul,
And make me to complain;
Though floods of sorrows on me roll,
And cause me cry for pain;
2 Though wretched and distressed I am,
All darkness and all fear;
And though I see myself shut out
From life, and hell appear;
3 One ray of light, shot from the sun
Of righteousness, can warm
My frozen soul, restore the day,
And all my fears disarm.
It Is his to bring reviving warmth,
Where coldness sat before,
And usher in the day on those
Who mourned in darkness sore.
5 Thus light'ned, I lift my head,
And cast my eyes around,
With joy behold the glorious scenes
Which in the day abound.
6 I Am pleased, and happy, and lay down
To bask me in his rays;
And wish no intervening cloud
May hide him from my eyes.
SONG XIX.
WHILE I my merit all explore,
To ease my conscience wounded sore;
That fruitless task, thou say, give over,
And take up the cross, and follow me.
2 For I in place of sinners stood
A spotless sacrifice to God,
To purge their conscience, by my blood;
Then take up the cross, and follow me.
3 All righteousness is fully wrought;
The Ransom's paid, Salvation bought:
Partake rest to thy soul for naught,
And take up the cross, and follow me.
4 When guilt, with agonizing pain,
Thy conscience wounds, behold me slain;
Lo! I from death am brought again;
Then take up the cross, and follow me.
5 Fear not, over hell and death I reign;
Your griefs I bear, I feel your pain;
Because I live, your life obtain;
Then take up the cross, and follow me.
6 'Twas Jesus spoke; the thrilling sound
A balsam was to every wound;
Thy voice gave life, and power I found,
To take up the cross, and follow thee.
7 A flood of joy, till now unknown,
Overwhelmed my heart, and filled my tongue;
My soul dwelt on that melting song,
I Will take up the cross, and follow thee.
8 What glory saw I now in him,
Who shed his blood to purge all sin;
Salvation swelled my soul to brim!
I Will take up the cross, and follow thee.
9 By faith, O Jesus, let me rise,
And seek the things above the skies;
O let me never apostatize,
From bearing the cross, to follow thee.
10 Till with thy patient saints I sing,
Grave! where is thy victory? death! thy sting?
Thou make all conquerors to reign,
Who take up the cross, and follow thee.
SONG XX.
PART I.
YE nations hear, it is God does call:
Ye slaves, ye kings of every tongue,
Give ear; the theme concerns you all;
The great salvation is my song.
2 It Is not for this, or that realm, --
It Is no such mean contracted scheme, --
Let every tongue adopt the Psalm;
The common safety is my theme;
3 That grand deliverance then displayed,
By God's dear Son, the Prince of Peace,
When, rising from the grave, he said
To his elev'n, with lips of grace;
4 All hail! my brethren, peace to you:
That perfect bliss my Father has,
He gives to me, I give to you;
For I have turned away his wrath.
5 Your works are finished by my hand;
Your debt is paid, your sin forgiven;
And, lo! I now ascend to stand
Your ever-faithful friend in heaven.
6 Ye see I live, who once was slain:
Tell all the world the gladsome news;
That God is reconciled to men,
Barbarians, Greeks, as well as Jews:
7 In deserts, towns, to every kind,
Over every mountain, every plain,
Tell, my salvation's not confined
To any rank or sort of men.
8 Speak boldly in my name to all:
My word with equal force prevails
On wise, on fools, on great, on small;
The mountains level, raise the vales.
9 Regard not how the news may please
The sons of pride, who make their boast
Of wisdom, wealth, and worldly ease;
Nor think your labor will be lost.
10 Dream not in all the apostate race,
A well-disposed heart to find,
To welcome or improve my grace:
Hope nothing from the human mind.
11 The great reward of all my pain
Stands not on such precarious ground:
Thus not one soul should life obtain;
Thus all my pangs were fruitless found.
PART II.
HE who surveys the heart of man,
Who testifies it is only ill,
Would never have formed his saving plan,
On ought depending on man's will.
2 God, in his mercy, purposed has,
(And God's salvation stands sure)
To bless all nations; and my death
Has made their blessedness secure.
3 All my redeemed sure mercies boast:
For so his will who sent me is,
Of all I Have given let none be lost;
But raise them to eternal bliss.
4 The glad report, my soul, embrace;
The blessed decree, my soul, adore;
Here may I all my comfort place,
When heart and flesh can aid no more.
5 Away with that redemption lame,
Which with salvation is not crowned;
I scorn the narrow-bounded scheme;
My soul abhors the insipid sound.
6 How vain that universal grace,
Which does no certain bliss bestow;
Which leaves the universal race
Exposed to universal woe!
7 The grace of God in Jesus shown,
Most sure salvation brings along;
Salvation to our God alone,
Of every tribe shall be the song.
8 Is any heart so black, so foul,
Excluded here? It Is surely mine:
But who is that narrow-hearted soul
God's common safety dares confine?
9 Who dares confine it unto them,
Who boast a will disposed to embrace?
Who boast a mind of better frame
TO improve the influence of his grace?
10 Who can by merit God prevent?
Let him stand forth for recompense:
But, Lord, for ever, ever grant
Preventing grace be my defense.
11 Be that redemption mine for aye,
Which from the dreadful curse does free;
That, with the whole redeemed I may,
The praise of all ascribe to thee.
SONG XXI.
HE who would enter into life,
Must first himself deny,
As lost in Adam, self-destroy'd,
And justly doomed to die.
2 No prayers nor tears can aid us here,
All human worth must fail;
No godly thoughts, nor warm desires
Nor feelings ought avail.
3 God says in my beloved Son
I fully am well pleased:
The sinner hears, and credits this;
And so his soul is eased.
4 Then love to God in Jesus Christ,
To all his saints, and words,
Confirms, and proves unfeigned faith,
And joyful hope affords.
5 Thus, Lord, let us thy word believe:
Grant us the love of God;
And when our hearts and strength do fail,
With thee be our abode.
SONG XXII. ISAIAH, CHAP. xi. xii.
FROM Jesse's humble stem shall shoot
A glorious branch; but first lopt off
It shall be from its native root,
Then for an ensign raised aloft.
2 Upon Mount Zion he shall sit;
His voice shall reach remotest lands;
At hearing, nations shall submit,
And, listening, wait his dear commands.
3 His lips drop wisdom; righteousness,
And truth divine, begird his loins;
And which abundant peace, he will bless
The happy folk over whom he reigns.
4 No hurtful beasts shall then annoy, --
All jarring feuds shall melt away;
The child shall with the viper toy; --
The lambs with lions frisk and play.
5 Then shall he set the poor on high,
And part the righteous from the vile:
No gloomy storm shall rend the sky,
But an eternal day shall smile.
6 Thou prince, shall sing in that blessed age,
JEHOVAH, I Will thy praise make known.
Thy word's fulfilled; take up thy pledge,
And claim thy being as thy own:
7 Because thy wrath against me burned,
My folks' sins fiercely to reprove;
Because thy wrath away is turned,
And thou have me solac'd with love.
8 God my salvation is; behold,
And share with me, my ransomed throng;
Beyond all fear, I Will now be bold,
JEHOVAH is my strength and song.
9 Here let your feasted eyes remain;
See! God is my salvation;
Now I Am refreshed from all my pain,
To see his glory raised thereon.
10 His glorious perfections all,
So wond'rously summed up in love,
Now, to my soul, once served with gall,
An ocean full of pleasure prove.
11 Ye meek ones from the fount of bliss,
Which without measure in me dwells,
Draw now salvation to your wish,
As from so many living wells.
12 And ye shall sing in that glad day,
Praise ye JEHOVAH; let his name,
Who is the great I AM, your stay,
Be ever your delightful theme:
13 And make his works done mightily,
Among all people to be known;
And ever keep in memory,
His name exalted is alone.
14 JEHOVAH sing, the man of war,
Whose right hand has done valiantly,
Amazing deeds, excelling far
The wonders wrought at the Red sea.
15 And this in all the earth is known:
Rejoice with shouts, O Zion's bride;
For great is Isr'el's Holy One,
Within thy courts who does reside.
SONG XXIII.
LET the saints all rejoice and exult in their king,
To Jesus with shouting and melody sing;
For sinners' redemption his life's blood he gave,
And the faithful true witness will never deceive.
His blood's all your boasting, his blood shed for you
With confidence trust him, -- his words are all true;
For he sealed with his blood every promise he gave,
And the faithful true witness will never deceive.
3 He promised a crown, when he left you the cross,
And he with a kingdom rewards all your loss:
To glory he leads, while close to him you cleave,
And the faithful true witness will never deceive.
4 How glorious to follow our dear suffering God?
Through great tribulation, the path which he trod!
His faithful redeemed in that path followed have,
And the faithful true witness did never deceive.
5 When he calls you afflictions and sorrows to bear,
He feels these afflictions; he wipes every tear:
Through fire and through water he never will leave,
For the faithful true witness will never deceive.
6 He promised more grace, that you fall not away,
And his blood is plighted for your life for aye;
He lives wholly for you, what more can you crave?
And the faithful true witness will never deceive.
7 His word stands most sure, I come quickly again,
He now waits to hear you resound your Amen:
Of that hope of glory he will never bereave,
For the faithful true witness will never deceive.
8 That he will change your vile body he caused you to hope,
Like his glorious body he shall raise you up.
All shining in glory, redeemed from the grave;
And the faithful true witness will never deceive.
SONG XXIV.
AWAKE, O Zion's daughter! rise;
Shake off thy dust; no more repine;
Let gladness sparkle in thine eyes,
In all thy fairest garments shine.
2 Behold thy King, expected long,
In humble pomp at length appears;
Amidst yon praising infant throng,
His meek majestic head he rears.
3 No fiery steed he rides; he sways
No tinsel rod of earthly reign:
A colt, never used 'till now, conveys
To thee thy lowly Prince divine.
4 Here Is no vain crowd, no gaudy show:
Babes, taught of heaven, resound his praise;
His paths the Galileans strew
With branches of triumphing peace.
5 With ardent zeal to crown the law,
He enters grand! see there he is!
His presence strikes a general awe;
The wonder circles, Who is this?
6 He visits now his Father's house,
And shows himself the son and heir;
He frowns away all vile abuse,
Smiles on his babes who praise him there.
7 This first day of the week, he shows
A pledge of joys before unknown,
When he should rise, and wide diffuse
The oil of joy among his own.
8 The blind and lame by him relieved.
His saving light and strength proclaim;
His foes with shame and spite are grieved,
To see his works and hear his fame.
9 Hosanna! thronging myriads shout,
JEHOVAH brings salvation nigh:
Hosanna! every babe cries out,
JEHOVAH, send prosperity.
10 To him, who, in JEHOVAH's name,
Draws nigh to save, all praise belongs:
Peace reigns in heaven with every beam
Of glory in the Highest Ones.
11 Salvation unto David's son;
All blessing unto Isr'el's King:
His kingdom blessed be alone,
And blessed the people of his reign.
12 To praise the just and saving King,
How blessed to be a little child!
When he in glory comes to reign,
Then all his babes shall kings be styled.
13 In all the earth how worthy is,
JEHOVAH, our dear Lord, thy name!
From infant lips thou perfect'st praise,
Thy strength, to put thy foes to shame.
SONG XXV.
SEE yonder cross! come, turn aside,
And this great sight behold:
The veh'ment flames of wrath divine
On Christ the man take hold.
2 This bush did burn 'midst fiercest flames;
Yet unconsum'd it stood:
The man Almighty wrath sustains;
Because the man was God.
3 A while his body lifeless lay,
To show the flame was dire;
But uncorrupted soon it rose;
His body quenched the fire.
4 That hour, on all his church unite
With him, the flame did rush;
And not a branch nor twig was burnt,
For God was in the bush.
5 Though guilt, in all your sufferings, makes
You brambles for the fire;
Yet God, in midst of you, preserves
From all that wrath entire.
6 Then follow Christ 'midst floods and flames
With him go dauntless through:
Nor floods, nor flames, repelled the love
He, gracious, bare to you.
7 Are ye like Isr' el, well nigh crushed
With burdens, sins, and foes?
To clear your path, he will part the deeps,
And on your enemies close.
8 Shrink not although the furnace burn
With seven times heated flame;
The Son of God will tend you there,
Who suffering overcame.
9 He quickly comes, from all your pains
To give you blessed repose:
And then, with powerful hand he will turn
The flame upon your foes.
SONG XXVI.
WHEN to my sight, thou GOD, appears,
I Am filled with sudden fear:
Thy justice, with uplifted arm,
O'erwhelms me with despair.
2 The former signs of grace no more
Relieve my troubled heart;
And past experiences of love
Add torture to my smart.
3 What shall I do? my prayers and tears
Are impious in thy sight:
I am removed from thee as far
As darkness from the light.
4 Is there no room for mercy left?
Is grace for ever gone?
I Will mind the years of thy right hand,
And wonders thou have done:
5 How to be one with sons of men,
Immanuel did not scorn;
And how from Mary's virgin womb
The holy child was born:
6 I Will mind the greatness of that love
Which in his breast did burn,
When all the wrath of God for sin
Upon his soul did turn.
7 When God's own well-beloved Son
Went mourning to the grave,
And died accursed for sin, that grace
Might dying sinners save.
8 See from the dead the Prince of life
In glory bright appears!
No further proof of love I Will seek;
This quiets all my fears.
9 This stream of light within the cloud
Sure token is of grace:
Where wrath did frown, see mercy smiles
From lovely Jesus' face.
10 This sign of love my soul relieves;
It Is ease from all my pain:
I will not blush to see thee, God,
Because the Lamb was slain.
SONG XXVII.
HOW sweet's the grace that does appear,
In healing sinners strayed from God!
How often that sight may we behold,
Where JAH himself makes his abode!
His tender mercies, like himself
Our utmost stretch of thought surpass;
Where we expected wrath and frowns,
There he discov'reth love and grace,
Which shines to us in Jesus' face.
2 Thus, when the youngest son with shame
Seeks ways to plead his father's grace;
His father eyes him yet afar,
And meets him with a fond embrace;
His mouth he stops with kindest kiss,
With finest robe does him invest,
His hunger by rich food allays,
And mirth succeeds, to glad the feast.
Thus grace to rebels is expressed.
SONG XXVIII.
THE death of God, who death o'ercame,
Does fire our love, our lusts destroy;
The praises of the worthy Lamb
Our tongues shall ever speak with joy:
His blessed merit now does shine!
And we are possessed of worth divine.
2 Though floods of guilt our souls invade,
A wounded conscience pain us fore,
We'll say the ransom's fully paid,
And justice can demand no more:
Justice and mercy now do meet,
And our salvation is complete.
3 In midst of deepest grief we'll sing:
For boundless mercy swells the song;
We'll soar aloft on swiftest wing,
And join the heavenly choir among:
This blessed harmony alone
Holds heaven and earth in union.
SONG XXIX.
WHEN Jesus shall a second time
Appear, to judge the man of sin,
And to reward his faithful saints,
Whose joyful reign shall then begin;
2 The separation of the seeds
Shall then most evident appear;
No hypocrite shall then lie hid:
Take heed, for now the time draws near.
3 As from a rock's stupendous height,
The eagle does descry her prey;
She with her young sucks up the blood
And where the slain is, there are they:
4 So when the Lamb who once was slain,
And by his blood bought us to God,
Shall in his glory come again:
The saints shall flock to his abode.
5 Then they who feasted here below*
By Faith upon his flesh and blood,
Shall ever filled be with his love,
And fully see that God is good.
6 Then let us, patient, wait for him,
Say with the church, Come quickly, Lord;
To such the righteous crown he will give,
As promised in his faithful word.
SONG XXX.
LET Poets sing of base amors,
And all their airy fables tell,
Adorning shame with gaudy flowers,
And serving the designs of hell.
2 A nobler theme becomes the men
Who know the charms of divine love;
A graver style best suits their pen
Who have a taste for joys above.
3 The divine lover, and his spouse,
Their marriage is a lofty theme,
Meet only for the heavenly muse,
And those fired with the sacred flame:
4 They only can the beauties see
Which are displayed in him who chose,
Though he was God, a man to be,
That he might seek and find his spouse.
5 For him, who, in the form of God,
Had been before the world began,
And then in flesh made his abode,
And showed himself in form of man,
6 No match was found. But he to have,
By purchase dear his wished for bride,
His life for her most freely gave;
And she came of his pierced side.
7 Thus Eve from sleeping Adam's side,
A comely form was brought to him:
He waking, his own likeness spied;
And knowing well from whence she came,
8 Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh,
This is, said he, and let her name,
Derived from mine, serve to express
Her rise from me, another same.
9 For this, a man his parents dear
Shall leave, and unto one remain,
Joined as his wife, in bond most near;
One flesh they are, and no more twain.
10 A better source, Christ in his death
Of being, to his mate does prove:
And rising from the dead, he has
Found the fair object of his love:
11 Where sin and death's deformity
Had been, behold! a living form,
His image shows in purity,
And beauty such as does him charm.
12 From his great Father he came forth,
And left his mother church of Jews,
To join the church which has her worth
From him, and cleave to her his spouse.
13 The name he gave her, does declare
That she is of him, and with him one
In divine spirit, as they share
In flesh and blood; such nearness none.
14 A firmer band than mingled clay;
A tie divine knits the blessed pair,
In union which shall last for aye:
My soul, in this have thou thy share.
SONG XXXI.
O JESUS! the glory, the wonder, and love,
Of angels and glorified spirits above,
And saints, who behold thee nor, yet dearly love,
Rejoicing in hope of thy glory:
Thou only, and wholly, art lovely and fair,
Who robb'st not JEHOVAH, with him to compare,
JEHOVAH's own image glows in thee; shines there
In visible bodily glory.
Worth divine dwells in thee;
Excellent dignity,
Beauty and majesty,
Glory environs thee;
Power, honor, dominion, and life, rest on thee,
O thou chiefest among the ten thousands!
2 Where ever we view thee, new glories arise;
The man who is God's fellow, who rides on the skies,
Made flesh, dwelt among us: brought God near our eyes
And in grace and truth showed all his glory.
Thou spak'st to existence the heavens and their hosts,
The earth and its fullness, the seas and their coasts:
Time hangs on thy word, and eternity boasts
To crown and adorn thee with glory.
Worth, etc.
3 But how lovely do thou appear in our eyes,
When in childhood, thou meet'st us in that dear disguise
Thy loves, past all knowledge, with raptures surprise,
And ravish our hearts with thy glory.
In thy blessed body on the cursed tree,
Thou bar'st all our sins, while thy God frowned on thee,
Expiring in blood in our stead; and lo, we
Exult in thy merit and glory.
Worth, etc.
4 Thy blood all divine from the grave back again,
Brought thee, King of glory; thou Lamb who was slain!
Firstborn of the dead, crowned with honor supreme,
Thy throne is established in glory.
There reign in thy glory, O thou great adored!
Till thy foes, crushed under thy feet, be no more;
Thy throne shall triumph over all things restored,
And eternity blaze with thy glory.
Worth, etc.
SONG XXXII.
SAY, word of truth, why sin and death
Among God's works were found?
Why, by a law to sinners given,
Was sin made to abound?
2 Why were the highly favored Jews
Abandoned to fulfill
The things foretold of Christ, and so
The prince of life to kill? --
3 It was that mercy might triumph,
Where sin before did reign;
That, in the darkest wickedness,
The strength of grace might shine.
4 Why was that nation broken off?
The Gentiles grafted in?
And these again, like Jews, cast off
By following their sin? --
5 It was to stain the pride of all;
Pour shame on every face;
That all the elected remnant might
Indebted stand to grace.
6 And that they all might be built up,
Through faith, an house for God,
And grace might shine more bright to them,
When wrath pursues the proud.
7 O great the depth! O rich the store
Of knowledge all divine!
Most perfect wisdom, through the whole,
Surprisingly does shine!
8 Who can his judgments deep search out?
His awful steps pursue?
Who was to pry into his thoughts,
When first his plan he drew?
9 Who was upon his counsels, when
His great designs were laid?
Who has first given to him? -- it shall
Most surely be repaid.
10 For of him, through him, all things are,
And unto him again;
To him all glory be ascribed,
For evermore. Amen.
SONG XXXIII.
SEE Mercy, Mercy, from on high,
Descends to rebels doomed to die!
It Is mercy free which knows no bound:
How grand, who gladsome is the sound!
2 It Is grace by righteousness that reigns,
Where every God-like beauty shines:
So leaves no doubt from whence it came;
Then grace divine we dare it name.
3 First mercy favored mortal view,
When God's own Son an infant grew;
And in its full perfection shone,
When dying Jesus cried, It Is done!
4 It triumphed when from death he rose,
And broke the power of all our foes;
And since he took his seat on high,
Now mercy reigns eternally.
5 Grace down in showers of mercy fell,
Refreshing thousands ripe for hell;
Who lately filled with devilish wrath,
Had doomed the Lord of heaven to death.
6 It courts not men of mighty name,
But visits those overwhelmed with blame;
It makes the poorest wretch look gay,
And empty sends the rich away!
7 Let haughty mortals frown and fret,
Who sovereign boundless mercy hate;
Through all the mansions of the blessed,
That mercy only is confessed.
8 Until we join the happy throng,
Let boundless mercy be our song;
And may the mighty God confound
And all those who dare its course to bound.
9 Amen, the holy prophets cry;
Amen, the apostles loud reply;
Amen, through all the heavens goes round;
Amen, let us on earth resound.
SONG XXXIV. ISAIAH Chap. xlii. 1 -- 4.
BEHOLD, my Servant, whom I send
Down from the pure realms of light;
My chosen One, my darling Son,
In whom is fixed my soul's delight.
2 My Spirit's fullness ever dwells
On head of this anointed One;
By him my judgment, and my truth,
To lands remote shall be made known.
3 He shall not cry, nor lift his voice,
Among crowds to raise the loud alarm;
He Will shun all strife for kingly power;
No earthly grandeur shall him charm.
4 The bruised reed he shall not break,
His strength in weakness to display:
His lovely folk shall wear his yoke;
His gentle rod they will obey.
5 The smoking flax can never expire,
For he sustains the hidden flame;
The sinking sinner he relieves,
Who trusts for life his precious Name.
6 Yea, many waters cannot quench
That fire which burns with feeble ray:
His kingdom's light which dimly shines,
Shall blaze like noontide of the day.
7 He judgment unto victory
Shall bring, to put his foes to shame:
His brethren then triumphantly
Shall sing the glories of his name.
8 Arise, O Lord, victorious come,
In all thy Father's brightness shine;
O come to save thy saints! and, Lord,
Begin thine everlasting reign.
SONG XXXV.
THE Love which thought on helpless man,
Does angels tongues employ;
The grace which stooped to Adam's race,
The heavens does fill with joy.
2 This, from eternity, was hid
In divine Wisdom's breast;
The grand design of mighty Love
The church does manifest.
3 When we survey that stately dome,
Where heavenly beauties shine;
In wonder lost, we must proclaim
The Architect divine.
4 The depth's as low as JESUS lay,
When humbled to the death;
The height's above all heavens with him;
All things are far beneath.
5 All in the heavens, and on the earth,
The breadth well comprehends;
To every nation, tribe, and tongue,
With freedom it extends.
6 The length from Adam to time's end,
Through every age does reach;
The building shows the love of CHRIST,
Which does our ken outstretch.
7 The angelic throng with raptures view
Salvation's structure rise;
By it God's wisdom manifold
With wonder strikes their eyes.
8 From every tribe and tongue are made
Materials for the frame;
Here every kind of sinners join;
In CHRIST they are the same.
9 When the head-stone shall be brought forth
Redemption-work to crown;
The saints and angels then shall shout,
Grace! Grace! in high renown.
SONG XXXVI.
JEHOVAH the name is of our God alone;
Who was, is, and shall be, and change knows none;
In purpose, and promise, and deed, he is the same;
And where he is performing his word, there is his name.
2 He was Independent in purpose of grace,
Before any being besides him had place;
The source of all beings, depending on none;
I AM, THAT I AM, then he dares say alone.
3 He is Independent in that word of grace,
Which makes a distinction among Adam's race;
He will be for ever performing his word,
And so shall his name be for ever adored.
4 In JESUS the purpose of grace was sure laid;
In Jesus that purpose is manifest made;
In Jesus the promise shall surely be done;
God's name's in the slain Lamb, in midst of the throne.
5 He Is Alpha, Omega, the first and the last;
Divine grace, and truth all in Jesus stand fast;
The works of creation all on him depend;
In him their beginning they have, and their end.
6 And that new creation the church, that is the crown
Of all the divine works, him ever will own;
Its beginning, and ending; in him it stands sure,
And leaning all on him, shall ever endure.
SONG XXXVII. PSALM cxxxvii. paraphrased.
BY streams of rivers, broad and strong,
Which strength and pleasure do afford
To Babel, there we sat among
The proudest enemies of our Lord.
2 But when we Zion called to mind,
With Shiloh's streams which softly go,
No ease in Babel we could find,
And from our eyes sad tears did flow.
3 Our pleasant harps, in grief of mind,
We hung upon the willows there:
These instruments were never designed
In Babel's concert to have share.
4 Our captive-leaders, when they saw,
Said, why may ye not here take heart?
And sing to us beneath our law?
So in our mirth come take a part.
5 They made us howl, and yet forbade
Our groans, and mirth required thus;
Bring of the music Zion had,
Such part as may best (...) with us.
6 In decent uniformity
With ours, and no more from your mouth,
Complaints of sad calamity,
Nor antique songs to us uncouth.
7 How shall Jehovah's holy song
Sound from our (...) aliens' land?
And songs to Zion which belong
In Babel's concert be profaned?
8 Shall this fill Zion's place? shall we
Take pleasure here, and quite forget
Our native land, and thoughtless be
Of Zion's former comely state?
9 Or shall we never drop a tear
Upon her rubbish and her dust?
Shall we for Babel's hope or fear
Quit our regard to her most just?
10 Jerusalem! if in this land,
I lose of thee the memory;
Then, for thy sake, let my right hand
In play lose all dexterity!
11 Yea, unto my mouth's roof let cleave
My tongue, no more to move in song?
When, on my heart, I no more have
The rights which unto thee belong!
12 And if I do not still take care
To set Jerusalem above
The head of all my joy, that there
Its joy and crown she still may prove!
13 As Zion rises, so high slow
My joy, but still beneath that crown;
And as she is depressed, fall low,
And underneath be thou pressed down.
14 Remember, in Jerus'lem's day,
His children, Lord, who did despise
The birthright, and gave it away
For one poor morsel, to suffice.
15 These never could subjection bear
To Zion's laws and yoke most just;
That carnal race, void of God's fear,
Said, raze it, raze it, to the dust.
16 Ah! Babel's daughter, painted whore,
On many waters set in state;
Thou think not (for thou art secure)
Of him who brings thy dreadful fate.
17 All blessings on that righteous One!
The Lord's anointed Cyrus true;
Who, as thou unto us has done,
Comes to reward thee quickly now.
18 Yea, blessings on him; for he will take
The younger harlots by thy side,
And them in pieces, for our sake,
Dash shall the rock whom we confide.
SONG XXXVIII.
There Is no name among men, nor angels, so bright
As the name of Jesus, the Father's delight;
The joy of his children, who lisp out this name,
And sweetly its praises soon learn to proclaim.
2 The wonder of angels, whose choir sound it high;
The terror of devils, who far from it fly.
It Is great through the whole earth, and highly esteemed;
As ointment forth poured among the redeemed.
3 The serpent's seed hate it, while yet it is their fear;
By their spite against it, it shines the more clear.
In all gospel churches this name is adored,
As their shield and glory, with cheerful accord;
4 And there it is declared, the help of distressed,
The hope of the hopeless, and ease of oppressed.
The church of the firstborn, with angels of light,
Shall sound forth its praises in endless delight;
But fully unfolded it can be by none
But Jesus among them, who knows it alone.
SONG XXXIX.
BLESSED he! who chast'ned, and well taught of God,
To lead and love the heav'n-directed road:
Whose breast receives, by heaven's all-gracious plan,
A sober mind, God's greatest gift to man.
Like him who though the sovereign Lord of all,
Yet thus allured mankind to hear his call;
2 All ye who groan, with fruitless labor pressed,
Come see my labor, I will give you rest:
Take up my yoke, and learn the lowly part
From me, for meek and lowly is my heart.
Thus, only thus, your souls true rest shall find;
And know my yoke is light, my burden's kind.
SONG XL.
SINNERS, running from the truth,
May divert their fears a while;
And in crooked paths of youth,
Coming sorrow may beguile:
But, in search of future hope,
They must wander, and repine;
In thick darkness they must grope,
Till preventing mercy shine.
2 So, backsliding sinners, when
They from faith apostatize,
And to love grow cold again;
Awful darkness blinds their eyes.
Then, in search of vanished joy,
They may toil, and still complain;
Fruitless labors them employ,
Till that mercy shines again.
SONG XLI.
WHEN Israel marched through the sea;
Their way by heaven prepared;
Between them, and their foes, they had
JEHOVAH their rear-guard.
2 The cloud of glory moved behind,
And by its splendour bright,
Spread light, and joy, over all the host;
Dispelling far the night.
3 Yet that same cloud a gloomy side
Presented to their foes;
Height'ning the horrors of the night;
Presaging deeper woes.
4 So, that same glorious word of grace,
By which the Lord leads forth
From Babel's bondage, his redeemed,
To glory in his worth,
5 Spreads light before, and guards behind;
At once, a wall of fire
To shield them round, and in the midst
Their glory and desire;
6 Even that same word, spreads darkness wide
Over Antichrist's domain;
And, blasting all their glory, makes
Them gnaw their tongues for pain.
7 Then, fear them not, but follow on
Where that word points the way:
Soon comes the Lord to crush his foes;
And give his friends the sway.
SONG XLII.
NOW, throned on high, the humbled man
Over wide creation reigns:
That face, once dark with grief, now bright
With heavenly glory shines.
2 He Is now most blessed at God's right hand,
And crowned as God's own Son;
Determined King by God's sure oath;
Sure pledge his work is done.
3 Sent, by thy high command, he came,
And in the guilty's place,
Fulfilled thy law, and bore thy wrath:
O God! how rich thy grace!
4 How far above the ways of man,
O Lord, thy grand design!
To clothe the guilty sons of men,
With righteousness divine!
5 O! what but endless life and joy
Such worth was meet to crown: --
Away with every idol false;
This screens us from thy frown.
6 This ample shade can hide us from
The fury of thine ire;
When all the foes to this shall be
Consumed with flaming fire.
7 No more let want of righteousness
Our guilty soul oppress:
The righteous work of Christ's enough
To banish our distress.
8 O never let us grudge to stand
Indebted to this grace,
Which can direct our wandering steps
Into thy holy place.
SONG XLIII.
BEHOLD the Traitor is gone forth
To work his dark designs;
The Son of man's now glorified;
God's glory in him shines!
2 If God be glorified in him,
The sure effect shall be,
Him in himself he will glorify;
And this ye soon shall see.
3 Thus spoke the Lord, before his death,
To cause his friends attend
To that event, at which all heaven
Does wonder without end.
4 Thus said; -- his virtue stood the shock
Of darkness' powers combined;
Virtue was never so tried before,
Nor so triumphant shined.
5 Not heaven and earth, when all their host
First into order rose,
Obedient as commanded, could
So much of God disclose.
6 Their steady course while they maintained,
Or changed at his word,
Such glorious honor to his will
Never did, nor could afford.
7 Here, all the glories of that love,
Which all perfection claims,
He brought to view, here in its strength
Each Godlike beauty beams.
8 Sure, as foretold, the effect appeared;
Earth quaked; he from the dead
Was by the father's glory raised,
Over all things to be head.
9 His friends beheld him mount to heaven,
And as he pierced the sky,
The glory met him to conduct
Him to his throne on high.
10 He thence to them the Spirit sent
Himself who glorified,
That of his glory they might be
By sharing certify'd;
11 Among the nations to declare
How highly God did prize
That lovely lowly character
Which mortals did despise:
12 That all his chosen finding joy
Where God's good pleasure lies,
Weaned from the earth, might place their hope
With him above the skies.
SONG XLIV.
WHEN I my wicked heart survey,
And course of life from day to day;
There Is naught to meet my wretched view,
But sin, and death, its proper due.
2 My heart's a source of every ill,
Averse to all that is good my will;
And pride, by which the angels fell,
Proclaims aloud, I Am ripe for hell.
3 Oh! can a wretch, so vile, so blind,
So ripe for hell, forgiveness find?
There Is not a wretch who breaths the air,
Has stronger reasons to despair.
4 But honor, praise, and glory, rise
To him who reigns above the skies!
To pardon guilt of deepest stains,
Unbounded mercy ever reigns!
5 The mighty God, Immanuel,
Deigned on this earth with men to dwell;
That sinners might be freed from guilt,
The blood of God's own Son was spilt.
6 His chosen he redeemed from death,
When he for them resigned his breath:
Bearing the curse, the wrath divine,
That mercy might for ever shine.
7 See from the dead the firstborn come!
The Lord of life has burst the tomb!
To all the world, from this blessed hour,
Declared the Son of God with power.
8 When he had his disciples blessed,
Who worshipped him, their God confessed,
To his reward in heaven he rose,
In name and stead of all he chose.
9 At God's right hand most blessed made,
The man of sorrows now made glad,
His kingdom stands; his reign is sure;
His worth for ever does endure.
10 This is enough; -- it is all we need;
The Lord of life is risen indeed:
The vilest wretch who breathes the air,
Has now no reason to despair!
11 O may our joy and boasting be
In him, who died upon the tree:
May the redemption shining there,
For ever shield us from despair.
SONG XLV. ACTS Chap. i. ver. 9, 10, 11
WHY Galileans stand ye now
Up gazing to the sky?
The Savior's gone from mortal view,
To Zion mount on high!
You saw him slain a sacrifice:
He now High Priest is known
In heaven, to appear for you;
And send the blessing down.
2 Remember well his last adieu;
And often his friends remind
How you with lifted hands he blessed,
And showed his heart so kind.
How, as he blessed, he mounted up,
And met the cloud of light;
So be assured he will come again
In heavenly glory bright!
3 Then gaze not here, nor think till then
Your eves can see his face:
Keep his commands; go tarry where
Himself assigned the place.
They went; -- the promised Spirit came;
Their friends were multiplied:
'Midst all their sufferings gladness reigned;
And God they glorified.
SONG XLVI.
WHILE others glory in their wealth,
Their wisdom and their might:
O! let the cross of Christ be still
Our glory and delight.
2 The wisdom, wealth, and might of man,
All perish like to dross;
But everlasting fullness flows
To sinners from the cross.
3 The wisdom, and the power of God
To save, does shine therein;
In Jesus' cross we see how God
Can justly pardon sin.
4 How guilty rebels such as we
May, after all, find grace;
May still be reconciled to God,
And see his face in peace.
5 Through Jesus crucified for sin,
God smiling does appear
On guilty man, -- his precious blood
Does bring the vilest near.
6 It blotteth out the various guilt
Of all for whom he died;
There Is balm for every wounded soul
In Jesus crucified.
7 Then what though worldly men the cross,
The plain, bare cross despise;
And what though all who trust in it
Seem little in their eyes?
8 Let us, in face of all contempt,
Of all reproach and shame,
In Jesus' cross still make our boast,
And triumph in his name:
9 In view of his great love, let us
For him count all things loss;
And far let every glorying be
Save only in his cross.
SONG XLVII.
SING the praises of the Lord;
His great love to us record,
Who has made his grace divine,
Toward guilty men to shine.
2 When by sin we were exposed
Unto to death -- God interposed;
And did lay Our help upon
His own Son, the mighty One!
3 He through death destroyed the foe;
By his grief removed our woe:
Through his glorious saving might,
Life eternal brought to light.
4 He the curse bare on the tree,
That the guilty might go free:
And redeemed us from wrath;
Where is now thy sting! O death?
5 All our works for us he wrought;
Peace and liberty he brought:
Greater bliss, we have to boast,
Than the life which Adam lost:
6 For, he lives beyond the grave,
from death's hand us to receive;
Where eternal joys remain;
Where no sorrow is nor pain.
7 To the Lamb who died and rose,
And has conquered all our foes,
Glory be for ever given
By the saints, in earth, and heaven.
SONG XLVIII.
IT IS finished! THE SAVIOR cried,
When on the cross he bowed, and died;
It Is finished! all heaven resounds,
The Eternal's mercy knows no bounds! --
2 Let Us catch, my friends, the heavenly theme,
It Is finished! let us proclaim:
Justice divine is now appeased,
God rests in his own Son well pleased.
3 It Is finished! ye nations hear,
Your fruitless labor now forbear;
By Jesus' finished work alone,
There Is access to God's holy throne.
4 It Is finished! The work is done!
By God's own well-beloved Son;
His work most perfect is, and pure,
And shall eternally endure.
5 It Is finished! The Lamb once slain,
Is from the dead raised up again;
He has ascended up on high,
And captive led captivity.
6 It Is finished! Now may we sing,
Devouring death! where is thy sting?
O grave! where is thy victory?
Here Is life and immortality!
7 It Is finished! Here Is food for praise,
Here Is subject meet for heavenly lays;
And God's redeemed shall ever sing,
The praises of the Eternal King!
8 Then let us still, with thankful voice,
In Jesus' finished work rejoice;
It Is finished! Let us proclaim,
Eternal thanks to God's great name.
SONG XLIX.
WITH ravished eyes, Lord, we admire
These radiant curtains of thy throne!
Wide heaven, adorned with studs of fire,
Proclaims Omnipotence alone:
These shining watchers, in their silent talk,
Proclaim thy glory, proclaim thy glory,
In their evening walk.
2 The purple morn! with gilded ray,
Renews the day with glad'ning light;
The o'erjoy'd creation welcomes day,
With cheerful motion, till the night
To silent slumbers hush the laboring ball:
These preach thy glory, these preach thy glory,
Through the spacious all.
3 Arrayed with light, in silver streams,
Throned in his fiery tent, the sun,
Diffusing all enlivening beams,
Round heaven's extremities does run;
Swift as a racer, as a bridegroom gay,
In pride of glory, in pride of glory,
Constituting day.
4 His genial warmth, the world immense
Confesses, in each fruit and flower;
Thou make his brooding influence
Feast thy creation every hour:
Thou made him this great world's both eye and soul,
Sole vital spirit, sole vital spirit,
Known from pole to pole.
5 Art dimly paints that brilliant ball;
That Is but an emblem faint, to show
The sun of righteousness, where all
The beams of God shine forth most true.
With rays diffused, in healing words he glows,
And circling warms, and circling warms
The nations as he goes.
6 Though blinded reas'ners mark thee not,
In nature's wide amazing scene,
Where all thy labors point thee out,
And all thy footsteps show so plain
Thy power, and godhead, to earth's utmost line,
Where brighter rays, where brighter rays
Of God never deigned to shine;
Yet ravished, with sublime delight,
Believers view in every line
Of thy pure oracles, the light
Of truth, and mercy all divine:
Thy law, and law fulfilled, these testify,
Convert the soul, convert the soul,
And bow the heart to thee.
SONG L.
WHEREWITH shall I overwhelmed with sin,
Before THE LORD appear?
Or how can such a wretch as I
To the Most High draw near?
2 Where shall the conscience stung with sin
Apply, relief to find?
And where is the balm, whose healing power
Can cure a wounded mind?
3 Can all the power of man do ought?
Ah no! it is all in vain --
It Is God that wounds, and God alone
Can heal the wound again.
4 And lo! Jehovah's boundless grace
The blessed cure supplies;
To save his people from their sins,
See! Jesus bleeds and dies!
5 Yea, rather see he lives again!
And shall for ever live;
And will, to all for whom he died,
This life eternal give.
6 Then, what though in this vale of tears,
Our sorrows may abound?
And for affliction's mortal stroke,
No cure can here be found?
7 Our life is hid with Christ, in God;
When Christ, our life appears,
His people he will with glory crown,
And wipe away their tears.
8 Let this, my friends, be all our hope,
Let this, our thoughts employ;
Through this blessed hope, in death itself,
There Is glorious room for joy:
9 Filled with such hope, let this vain life
Evanish from our eyes;
Let solid, boundless, endless bliss
Before our view arise.
10 And let us, with one heart, and soul,
To God our voices raise;
By him this grace was purchased;
To him be all the praise.
SONG LI.
Who Is this, that from the desert does
Like smoky pillars rise;
Who, leaning on her dearest Lord,
All others does despise?
2 It is the Lamb's beloved spouse,
It is his virgin bride;
Who from the rage of Antichrist,
Did in the desert hide.
3 The Woman who to John appeared
Is clothed with the Sun,
The perfect righteousness of Christ,
Which he alone has done,
4 All earthly things beneath her feet
She tramples on, and scorns;
The doctrine preached by the Twelve,
Like stars her head adorns;
5 With antichrist she will not join;
No head but Christ her Lord,
And by no other rule will she
Be measured, but God's word.
6 Her doctrine, worship, discipline,
Must all conformed be
Unto God's word; and children dwell
In love and unity.
7 The Shepherd's voice she hears, and knows,
In it she does rejoice;
And cheerfully does follow him: --
-- She knows no stranger's voice.
8 The hireling Shepherd, will not stand,
To face the enemy;
And when the flock in danger is,
Does quickly from them fly.
9 But the Good Shepherd, for his sheep
Did give his life away;
That he might them redeem, who from
His fold had gone astray.
10 Let all his people, here below,
Join loud with all above;
And, in triumphant heavenly notes,
Sing his redeeming love.
SONG LII.
BEHOLD! what love the Father has
On guilty man bestowed!
That we, poor sinners, sons of wrath,
Should be the Sons of God!
2 O! how beyond expression great
The love of Christ does shine:
It Is like himself! THE ETERNAL GOD
Past knowledge! all divine!
3 Behold! for guilty, guilty man,
The Lord of glory dies;
Lays down his life, them to redeem,
A precious sacrifice!
4 And God the sacrifice accepts,
His wrath is now appeased;
He looks to his beloved Son,
And says, "I am well pleased."
5 Now, does the ever worthy Lamb,
Who for his people died,
See of the travail of his soul,
And is well satisfied;
6 Now peace and good will toward men,
In boundless streams do flow;
And joy, and hope of endless life,
Does God through Christ bestow.
7 O! let us then resound the note
Which still prevails above;
And ever sing, with joyful hearts,
The wonders of his love.
SONG LIII.
I HAVE seen the lovely garden flowers
In all their beauty glow:
I Have seen the stormy hail-stone showers
Lay all their glory low.
2 I Have seen the youth in beauty's pride
And highest health to day,
Before tomorrow's even tide,
A loathsome lump of clay.
3 Then what is our life? a vapor sure!
Away it swiftly flies;
The joys of life, how insecure,
How trifling such a prize?
4 How often this lesson we have been taught;
Yet still the earthly mind
Pursues its earthly hope full fraught,
To heavenly hope still blind:
5 That lesson which we now despise,
Presuming on our might,
Shall soon be set before our eyes,
Clear as the noonday light.
6 The hastening day shall soon arrive,
When awful death shall come,
And close the scene of this vain life,
In darkness and the tomb.
7 O! may the Living Word, the light,
Shine forth before our eyes;
In that dread hour dispel the night
With everlasting rays:
8 When in the dark and dismal road,
Which we are doomed to tread,
Our comfort be the word of God,
Our rock, our strength, our shade:
9 His word, who died upon the tree,
Can fortify the heart,
And, even in death, our minds can free,
And bid all fear depart;
10 For he is alive, who once was slain,
And reigns exalted high;
His word can raise us up again,
Though in the grave we lie.
11 The work he finished on the cross,
Does bring salvation sure;
And his unspotted righteousness
For ever does endure.
SONG LIVE.
HARK! the trump of God does sound;
The arch-angel's voice is heard on high:
Now the Lord himself descends,
With a shout that rends the sky.
2 See! his dead have heard the sound!
Spring immortal from the tomb;
And with rapture meet their Lord,
* Crying, Now the kingdom's come,
3 Lo! his people too on earth
In a moment changed all rise,
In the clouds caught up with them,
To meet their Savior in the skies.
4 See! mortality of life
Swallowed up eternally!
Death, O Death! where is thy sting?
Where, O Grave! thy victory?
5 Now, all tears are wiped away;
Free from curse, and free from pain,
All Christ's people, now with him,
Kings, and Priests, for ever reign;
6 Heirs of God! joint heirs with Christ!
All triumphant over their foes;
All God's fullness they possess,
And their cup still overflows.
7 In the hope of all this joy,
Let us, brethren, still be found,
Steadfast in the faith of Christ,
And in love let us abound.
8 Let his matchless love to us,
To his work our souls constrain,
Knowing, that our labor wrought
In the Lord, shall not be vain.
SONG LV.
TO guilty mortals why so kind,
So long indulgence shown?
So many bounties round the year
Thus copiously sent down?
2 Why does the sun renew the day,
With all reviving beams?
The skies, like breasts which never run dry,
Refreshment send in streams?
3 Does judgment sleep? Can God the judge,
On sin forget to frown?
Nay! Death devouring every hour,
In course all men (...) down.
4 But 'midst the rage of sin and death,
Proceeds a grand design;
The glorious light of endless life,
Across the gloom does shine.
5 The Lord is risen, the King of peace,
The King of righteousness;
He bare the curse, he reigns on high,
The nations he will bless.
6 He spares the world, till he complete,
His grand design of love:
For this he makes his sun to shine,
And rain sends from above.
7 For this are powers ordained of God,
To keep the world in awe;
That vi'lence may not overwhelm the earth,
Till thence his folk he draw.
8 Then let us raise our voice to God,
And daily praise his name,
Since all the bounties of the day
That mercy reigns, proclaim.
SONG LVI. EXODUS xv. Moses's Song.
UNTO Jehovah I will raise
My Song, and cheerful, shout his praise;
Divinely glorious he excels!
His mighty hand his grandeur tells.
2 The horse, and the proud rider down
Into the deep, his arm has thrown;
Jehovah is my strength and song,
Salvation does to him belong.
3 This is my God! to (...) great name
An habitation I will frame!
My father's God he is, and I
Will shout his praise triumphantly.
4 A Man of war, JEHOVAH is!
This glorious name is only his;
He Pharaoh's chariots and his host,
Has down into destruction tossed!
5 His chosen warriors all has he
Overthrown, and drowned in the sea;
Down to the bottom as a stone
They sank, -- the deeps have over them gone
6 In power thy right hand glorious shone,
Jehovah, O thou mighty One!
Thine own right hand the en'my all
O God, has dashed in pieces small.
7 In thy excelling greatness thou
All who against thee rose o'erthrew;
Against them thy wrath thou did prepare;
Like stubble they consumed were.
8 Thy nostrils' blast the floods uprear'd,
Astonished seas in heaps appeared;
Even as a wall on either hand,
The mighty deeps congealed did stand!
9 "I will pursue (the en'my cried)
"Overtake them, and the spoil divide;
"My lust of vengeance I Will enjoy,
"Yea, utterly I Will them destroy."
10 Thou with thy wind did blow, and straight
The deeps them covered from our sight:
They 'midst the torrent sank like lead,
And raging waves rolled over their head!
11 Among the mighty who is there
O God, that may with thee compare?
Who is like thee? In holiness
Thus glorious! Fearful is thy praise!
12 Thou wonders do! Thy right hand thou
Outstretched, and did sink them low;
Wrapped up in sudden ruin, they
Beneath the rushing torrent lay!
13 While in thy mercy thou did lead
Thy people, thus from bondage freed;
And in thy strength them guided have,
Unto thy holy place of rest.
14 The nations of thy works shall hear,
And tremble with foreboding fear;
While they of Palestina shall
With sorrow be o'erwhelmed all.
15 Then Edom's lofty ones shall quake,
And Moab's mighties trembling, shake;
The inhabitants of Canaan, they
With fear, like wax shall melt away!
16 Terror and dread shall on them fall,
And as a stone be still, they shall
By thy great arm, till every one
Of thine, Jehovah, over have gone.
17 Yea, till each one thou purchased have
Safely their land have overpast;
Thou Wilt bring them in, and plant them there,
They thine inheritance shall share.
18 Within the place ordained by thee,
Jehovah, thy abode to be:
The sanctuary which thy hand,
O Lord, established firm to stand.
19 For ever, and for ever more
The glorious Lord shall reign in power:
The Lord shall reign, -- the mighty One
Who all our foes has overthrown!
20 Proud Pharaoh's horse, and chariots strong
Rushed the divided seas among;
God spoke -- the waters backward came,
And swift destruction covered them!
21 While Israel's sons upon dry land
Securely passed -- on either hand,
The parted sea its billows reared,
And a defending wall appeared!
22 Raise then Jehovah's praises high;
He has triumphed gloriously!
The horse and his proud rider down
Into the deep his arm has thrown.
SONG LVII.
HEAR O heaven! O earth attend!
Creation hear the joyful sound!
Christ who died, is risen again,
And with endless glory crowned.
2 Hence flows hope to guilty man,
Hence our way is paved to heaven;
Jesus died for our sins, --
Now he lives! and we are forgiven.
3 What though we are worthless all,
Sinners against the richest grace!
Wrath divine is now appeased,
Boundless mercy now takes place.
4 See! our Intercessor lives,
Hear him plead before the throne!
Father, save my guilty flock,
Save, for now thy will is done:
5 These are they whom I have loved,
They whom thou to me did give;
These I purchased with my blood,
Since I died, O let them live.
6 Just, O well beloved, thy plea,
Just what ever, thy lips can crave;
Thou have died for guilty men,
Now I can be just and save.
7 Save then these thy much-loved sheep,
Save them all, for they are thine;
Bless as I have blessed thee;
Let them be for ever mine.
8 Blessed God! What grace is here?
How shall sinners grateful prove?
How that gratitude express
For thy rich preventing love?
9 How, but by their love to thee,
To thy people, to thy laws,
Daily taking up the cross,
Gladly suffering for thy cause?
SONG LVIII.
BEHOLD! the bright morning appears,
And Jesus revives from the grave:
His rising, removes all our fears,
And shows him Almighty to save:
How strong were his tears and his cries!
The worth of his blood how divine!
How perfect his sacrifice is
Who rose, though he suffered for sin!
2 The man, who was crowned with thorns,
The man, who on Calvary died,
The man, who bore scourging and scorn,
Whom sinners agreed to deride;
Now blessed for ever is made,
And life has rewarded his pain;
Now glory has crowned his head,
Heaven sings of the Lamb who was slain.
3 Believing, we share of his joy;
By faith, we partake of his rest;
With this, we can cheerfully die;
For with him we hope to be blessed.
This makes us regardless of fame,
And riches and honor despise,
We suffer for Jesus name,
And die, that with him we may rise.
4 We wait for his coming again,
To raise us in glory with him;
Then, gladness his saints shall obtain,
His foes shall be clothed with shame.
Then shall his afflicted, and poor,
From the dust and the dunghill, be raised;
Their wants and disgrace are no more:
By him they with princes are placed.
5 Then will he most fully reward
The kindnesses done to his name;
For faithfully he has declared,
He takes them as deeds done to him:
Ye blessed of my Father come near,
Sit down on my heavenly throne;
Inherit the kingdom prepared
For those who delight in his Son.
6 Then let us look forward to this,
And joyfully take up his cross;
His servants shall be where he is,
And all that we lose is but dross:
They Are honored whom he shall approve,
Their riches shall never decay;
Their joy is complete in his love,
Their tears shall be all wiped away.
SONG LIX.
HAIL glorious times of joy and peace,
When we'll be safe from every grief;
And this, our bosom foe shall cease,
This evil heart of unbelief.
2 Then safe from every dreaded ill,
Death never more shall break our rest;
Nor any breast with terror fill,
Forever in God's presence blessed!
3 And is the blessedness our choice
Which Jesus with his blood has bought?
Do we in him alone rejoice
Who all our works for us has wrought?
4 Why then of death so much afraid?
The gate of heaven -- our wished for home!
When he seems near, why shrink dismayed?
Why not with pleasure bid him come?
5 And do we, after all, then prize
This motley scene of grief and care?
Is heaven so little in our eyes,
We would not die though to be there?
6 When we survey the grizly form;
Does nature shudder at the sight?
The pallid look; -- the shroud; -- the worm;
And darkness of perpetual night!
7 The silent tongue, -- the fixed eye, --
The clay-cold hand, -- our long, long home! --
Are we afraid lest we should lie
Eternal tenants of the tomb?
8 Fear not: our great Redeemer lives,
And he from death shall set us free!
Though now we die, if we are his,
These very eyes the Lord shall see.
9 Dread we in death to lay us down!
Know Jesus in the grave was laid;
He made it easy for his own,
When he their ransom fully paid!
10 Are we afraid of racking pain?
O! think what pains our Savior bore;
He bore our griefs and sorrows all
When nails and thorns his body tore!
11 Or do we dread yet more to find
God's awful wrath upon us fall?
Here Is comfort to the guilty mind:
Our great Redeemer bore it all!
12 He bore the Almighty's frown, that we
Might never feel the wrath divine,
Behold him bleeding on the tree!
See Justice there, and Mercy shine!
13 "My God, my God, why have thou me
"Forsaken," The blessed suff'rer cried!
But, none of his forsake will he
(In death) who for their ransom died.
14 God now well-pleased for Jesus' sake,
Smiles on his people's parting hour:
Hence they of lively hope partake,
Though worms their body shall devour.
15 He ever lives, who was dead:
Of death he keeps the keys alone;
He Will say (when from the grave they are freed)
"Of those thou gav'st me I Have lost none!"
16 And when he brings them back again,
From worms and death a glorious prize;
They shall appear without a stain,
All lovely even in God's own eyes!
SONG LX.
WHEN Jesus comes again,
Faith shall be rare on earth to see;
And sin abounding, then
The love of many cold shall be!
Let us beware,
And watch with care,
And for the faith contend:
And jointly strive
To keep alive
Our hope, unto the end.
2 If we shall thus endure
With patience suffering for his fake,
His promise stands sure
That we shall in his joy partake:
Beyond compare,
The glories are,
Which then revealed shall be;
When clothed in light,
'Midst angels bright,
He Will shine forth gloriously!
3 See men (as he foretold)
Do put his coming far away;
They purchase, plant, and build,
As if this world should last for aye:
Yet soon shall they
In smoke decay;
O may our faith be strong!
What worldlings prize
Let us despise;
For Christ will come ever long.
4 We Have seen the man of sin
Revealed, and to his height arise:
And now consumed again
His kingdom almost ruined lies!
That power shall be
Crushed utterly,
Before Christ's glory bright:
Dire vengeance shall
Overwhelm them all
Who dared his grace to slight!
5 His enemies are reserved
To dreadful scenes of endless woe:
And have not we deserved
To be shut out from comfort too?
But blessed be he
Who set us free,
And bore himself God's wrath!
His work's complete,
Truth, mercy meet!
The sting is drawn from death!
6 What then though famines spread,
And pest'lence stalk, devouring round;
Filling each heart with dread,
While earthquakes rend the trembling ground:
Though nations are
Engaged in war,
And all is wild dismay,
We without fear
Our heads will rear,
And cry, Lord come away!
7 Blessed be his glorious name,
That we have his perfect work to boast;
That ever he did proclaim
He came to seek and save the lost!
His love shall be
Eternally
Our joyful theme of praise:
We will shout forth
His matchless worth,
And trust his boundless grace!
SONG LXI.
ALTHOUGH temptations threaten round
And feeble as the moth I Am found;
'Midst greatest dangers let me see
Thy grace sufficient, Lord, for me.
2 And when my faith is like to fail,
And doubts and darkness most prevail;
Hold thou me up, and let me see
Thy grace sufficient, Lord, for me.
3 When (Heaven forgot) my foolish heart
In this vain world would choose its part;
Call back the wanderer Lord to thee,
And let thy grace my safety be.
4 When warring passions vex me sore,
And I dare trust myself no more;
Thy strength, my stay in weakness be,
Thy grace sufficient, Lord, for me.
5 When all conspires to work my woe,
And in despair to plunge me low,
When terror takes fast hold on me;
Lord, let thy grace my safety be.
6 And when through death's dark vale I go,
O let me then my guidance know;
Then comfort send, and let me see
Thy grace sufficient, Lord, for me.
7 Thanks to thy name, that thou, O Lord
Help to the worthless can afford;
Lord help me then, and let me see
Thy grace sufficient still for me.
8 I have no claim for grace at all,
On me thy wrath might justly fall:
But Jesus died! -- His merit see,
And reach thy mercy Lord to me.
SONG LXII. HABAK. chap. iii. 17, 18, 19.
THOUGH the fig tree to blossom should cease,
And no fruit on the vine should appear;
Though the labor of the olive decrease,
And the fields with no meat crown the year;
From the fold though the flocks should decay,
And no herd in the stall should be found;
In JEHOVAH yet joyful I Will be,
In's salvation my joy shall abound.
SONG LXIII.
HOWEVER despised Christ's people be,
However 'midst desert lands they stray,
Them carefully seek out will he,
And cheaful they will his voice obey.
2 He Will like a faithful shepherd lead
Them safe, and keep with tender care:
With his life-giving truth them feed,
Where streams of promised comfort are.
3 Whatever dangers threaten round,
From dangers he will their refuge prove;
Thus strength in greatest straits be found,
And none shall tear them from his love.
4 Through life and death their guide he will be,
(His worth in life and death their boast!)
"Of these whom thou have given me"
(He Will say at last) Lo none I Have lost!
SONG LXIV.
HAIL! blessed scenes of endless joy,
Where Christ in boundless glory reigns;
Where nothing hurtful shall annoy,
But gladness fills the happy plains:
Free from sin, and free from fear,
None ever shall sigh, or shed a tear.
2 Ten thousand thousands there shall raise
Their glad notes, and sing this strain,
"Wake the song of grateful praise,
"To the Lamb; for he was slain!
"Hosannas, loud Hosannas sing,
"Hosannas to the Eternal King."
There in Jesus' presence blessed,
They fear no death, nor feel a pain;
They there shall smile in endless rest,
Nor dangers ever shall threat again.
For Jesus reigns, and they shall share
With him, in his own glory there.
SONG LXV.
GLORY unto Jesus be,
From the curse he set us free;
All our guilt on him was laid,
He the ransom fully paid.
2 All his glorious work is done,
God's well pleased in his Son,
For he raised him from the dead,
And he reigns his Church's head.
3 His redeemed his praise shout sorth,
Ever glorying in his worth;
Angels sing around the throne,
"Thou art worthy! Thou alone!"
4 He will soon return again,
And his saints with him shall reign;
In this hope they joyful say
Come Lord Jesus -- come away.
SONG LXVI.
O WHY so slow, ye simple, say,
The Savior's faithful words to hear?
Why put his coming far away?
Look up, for lo! the signs appear.
The time is short, when every foe
Shall vanquished lie, no more to rise:
For Christ shall tread his enemies low,
While shouts of triumph fill the skies.
2 See nation against nation rise;
Kingdoms and States for war prepare;
Distress, perplexities arise,
Men's anxious hearts do fail for fear:
Dire famines waste, and earthquakes rend
The ground, and desolation spread:
The pest'lence rage does wide extend,
And fills the trembling world with dread.
3 That Kingdom for the Clergy raised,
(Christians! yet strangers to the cross,)
Their former grandeur how debased!
Their pomp's brought low, their power is lost!
This power consumed, shall Christ destroy
When in His brightness he shall come:
His people all shall shout for joy,
While the loud voice declares, It Is done.
4 Men mock the Christians' hopes, and cry,
They Are idle visionary views;
They build, they plant, they sell and buy,
And each his favorite scheme pursues.
See how iniquities abound;
The love of many waxes cold:
Lukewarmness in the church is found,
And faith's a rare thing to behold.
5 When Lot from Sodom hasted out,
Till he was safe, God's vengeance staid:
Then ruin wrapped them round about,
And all the plain in ashes laid!
So, when each elect soul's brought in,
More dreadful vengeance shall devour:
And those who would not Christ should reign,
Shall feel the terrors of his power.
6 And sudden as the thief by night,
Christ unexpected shall appear:
But let his saints with patience wait,
For their redemption now draws near.
"Quickly I come," hear him declare. --
He comes to bring his people home,
Let Us join the church's ardent prayer,
Amen! even so, Lord Jesus come.
SONG LXVII.
WHY should we give way to vain fears?
Why ever ungrateful repine?
In God trust, and banish your cares,
At his word all your sorrows resign.
Should seas roar, and toss round the world,
And hills from their bases be torn,
Or stars from their orbits be hurled,
His people sure need never mourn.
2 The tempest which rolls at his word,
At his bidding sinks instant to rest:
Over creation's wide bounds he is Lord,
His people he will save 'midst distress,
Their rock and their fortress he will prove,
Their strength and their refuge he will be:
No dangers them ever shall move;
Their shield and their safeguard is he.
3 He laid the foundations of earth,
And daily upholds by his power;
He spoke, and the heavens had their birth,
By him they are upheld till this hour.
All these shall wax old and decay,
As a vesture be changed they shall:
At his presence they will vanish away,
And their glories before him shall fall.
4 But God from all changes secure,
No end of his years shall be known:
The same he will forever endure,
And eternity all is his own!
His glories all infinite shine,
In mercy and justice the same:
His goodness and love how divine!
O! (...) adore his great name.
5 All glory, all honor, and praise,
And thanks to JEHOVAH be given;
Ye saints your glad voices all raise,
His mercy is higher than heaven!
To Jesus the Lamb who was slain,
The redeemed ever raise their glad songs;
Salvation ascribe unto him;
For to him all the glory belongs!
SONG LXVIII.
WHEN God to sinners first displays
The glory of his sovereign grace,
So wonderful it seems to them
They almost fear it is all a dream.
2 Shall sinners, who from day to day
Have spurned his grace, and gone astray,
Yet in his boundless mercy share,
And find no reason to despair!
3 And has the Man, God's Fellow, died,
And all his justice satisfied, --
That mercy might flow free to those
Who, all their life, have been his foes?
4 Yes, God's well pleased in his Son,
Who all our works for us has done:
None may for want of worth complain,
Since Jesus died, and rose again.
5 What grace! what boundless grace is this!
Like God, and God alone it is!
(The vilest in his name may trust)
Whiles he forgives, divinely just!
6 Hence filled with rapture, we his praise
In grateful, joyful songs do raise;
And foes surpised sometimes exclaim
"The Lord has done great things for them!"
7 Yes, he has done great things for us,
Whereof we are glad, and glory thus;
And well we in his work may boast,
For Jesus died to save the lost!
8 O still from Satan's bondage, Lord
Do thou deliverance afford:
As streams enrich the barren ground,
So let thy grace in us be found.
9 And as we need it more and more,
May we still see unbounded store,
Grace, reigning through Christ's worth, may we
For us still all sufficient see.
10 For though we sow in tears, ere long
No sigh shall interrupt our song!
When Christ in glory shall appear,
We'll, joyful, reap without a tear.
11 For Christ the man, with power to save,
Did go forth weeping to the grave;
And in the earth this precious seed
Himself, the grain of wheat, was laid.
12 Now glorious fruit from him does spring,
Which he will returning, with him bring;
In that glad day his ransomed throng,
Full of his joy, shall come along.
13 He comes! let all his people say
Amen -- Even so -- Lord come away!
Soon may thy sheaves be gathered in,
And thy expected reign begin.
14 For thou shall reign on earth, and we
Hope Lord to reign as kings with thee:
O may we looking for that day,
Spurn every other hope away.
SONG LXIX.
MAN like a flower at morn appears,
And blooms perhaps a few short years:
The flatt'rer hope still leads him on,
Pursuing pleasure, finding none;
Or, if he finds it for a day,
It soon takes wing and flies away!
2 Often things which promise passing fair,
Deceive, and yield him naught but care:
Cares ever various, ever new,
Is all the happiest ever knew;
Comes joy, care with it comes along,
And spoils the syren's sweetest song!
3 See pleasure with bewitching charms,
Man grasps it in his eager arms;
The vision swift dissolves in air --
He grasps -- but finds it is not there!
The airy phantom still he views,
And still as vainly he pursues!
4 A better hope the Christian chears,
Which joyful through life's gloom appears;
Firm on a rock his hope he builds,
Which to no storm nor tempest yields;
Let earth dissolve -- he will not fear,
For why, his hope's not fixed here.
5 He looks to heaven, where every joy
Is pure, unmixed with alloy;
Joys such as mortals never knew,
Nor raptured fancy ever drew;
Joys which shall never pass away,
Though heaven and earth shall both decay!
6 Though here afflictions do annoy,
There sorrow shall be turned to joy;
Though troubles here the sigh do raise,
There Is nothing heard in heaven but praise:
Pleasures past utterance they share,
And face to face see Jesus there!
7 And shall the world's deceitful smile
Us of the glorious hope beguile?
Shall we earth's empty pleasures prize,
And heaven seem little in our eyes?
It must not be -- vain dreams away, --
Let Us look for joys which never decay.
SONG LXX.
THIS day, we call to memory,
That Christ the Lord for us did die:
He bore the curse us to relieve;
And died, that we might ever live.
2 But death no power on him could have;
For death he conquered and the grave;
And passed triumphantly on high,
Where now he reigns eternally.
3 This day, a sign to us is given,
That peace is now enthroned in heaven;
That grace, through righteousness divine,
Unto eternal life does reign.
4 Christ now is entered to his rest;
And we by faith in him are blessed,
With pardon free and heavenly peace;
All flowing from his sovereign grace.
5 By this, we hope a blessed release
From sin and death; and henceforth cease
To work for life, since Jesus said
With his last breath, It Is finished!
6 Then let us on this holy day
To him our grateful worship pay:
On his eternal worth rely,
And love and serve him cheerfully.
SONG LXXI.
HOW long shall it be, ever thy saints, Lord, with thee,
As kings and as priests exalted shall reign?
O when shall the time come that thou wilt bring them all home,
With thee in thy glory for aye to remain.
2 Here ills are abounding, and dangers surrounding,
And sorrows perplexing us, day after day:
But when Christ appears, he will dry up our tears,
O! Come then Lord Jesus, Come quickly away.
3 No sin shall prevail, no temptations assail;
No evils be found, no doubts shall remain;
But joys shall abound, and peace smile around:
And holiness flourish when Christ comes again!
4 No pain's there remaining, nor cause of complaining,
But pleasures unbounded shall flow ever there:
What eye has not seen, nor our thoughts can attain,
True lasting, and glorious beyond all compare!
5 They Will all join their praises, with joy there to Jesus
And all sing the worth of the Lamb who was slain;
They Will ever adore him, who loved and died for them,
And washed their robes white, that with him they might reign!
SONG LXXII.
HAIL! hail! the happy wished for time,
When Jesus shall appear:
When the last trumpet loud shall sound,
And all the dead shall hear.
2 They Will burst the bands of death with joy,
And loud Hosannas raise:
In him who loved them they will rejoice,
And glorious make his praise.
3 "Thou! Thou art worthy" still shall be
The burden of their song;
"For thou redeemed us, and to thee
"The glory does belong."
4 We hope to join the greatful note,
And with loud triumph sing,
"Where? where is thy victory now, O grave!
"O death! where is thy sting?"
SONG LXXIII.
WHEN pale distress o'erspreads the face,
And dismal fears of death take place,
What then shall soothe the troubled breast,
And give the awakened conscience rest?
When life is to a period brought,
And all its joys not worth a thought,
What is it then can calm the soul?
And what our doubts and fears control?
2 Men set our worth before our eyes,
And boast the comforts thence which rise;
A life well spent, they say gives joy,
Which death nor hell can never destroy.
But where is this well spent life they boast?
God's law once seen, man's worth is lost;
God's awful justice loud does sound,
And dash our boasting to the ground!
3 Not our sincerity of heart,
Nor works, nor worth, can peace impart:
At death all these dissolve in air,
Christ's worth alone's sufficient there.
Christ's blood, and only his can save,
And make us conqu'rors over the grave:
It death unstings, and shows us how
God can be just and gracious too!
4 Hence has the weak and timorous soul
Been seen to triumph at the goal:
And neither doubt nor terror show,
But joy'd to feel the pulse beat slow.
How have they joy'd in Jesus' name
His worth divine their darling theme!
Through that alone expect the crown,
Then smile at death, and mock his frown!
5 Thus when they pass through death's dark vale.
In vain do doubts and fears assail!
The Lord is with his people there,
His rod and staff their comfort are.
O when to us these shades appear,
May God our comforter be near,
Make strong our faith as life decays,
And tune our dying lips to praise!
SONG LXXIV.
WHEN God's own Son from heaven came down
And tabernacled here below,
He made his grace and mercy known,
Yet stood exposed to want and woe!
Despised and destitute was he,
He who the earth's foundations laid:
Beasts found a shelter, birds a shade,
He had not where to lay his head!
2 Yet man presumptuous dares complain,
When sorrows come, or wants assail;
The Eternal sovereign they arraign,
And think his tender mercies fail.
But why complain, is it not enough
The servant as his Lord appear?
Through suffering he was perfect made,
We (suffering too) his bliss shall share.
3 O ye of little faith look up,
See, careless, fly the birds of air,
Nor barns, nor storehouses have they,
Yet, even of those does God take care.
The very flowers which deck the field;
And shine more bright than kings ever shone,
Though soon they fade, yet God them clothes;
Is man forgot then, -- man alone?
4 When Israel out of Egypt came
By God's strong arm, and wonders great,
When hunger threatened, their faith failed,
"Can God, they said, give flesh to cat?"
Even Moses asked "where shall we find
"Food for the crowds which here resort?"
God checked his doubts with this reply
"Say, is your Maker's hand waxed short?"
5 Even while they murmured he them fed! --
We have been fed, and murmured too;
For food and raiment often repined,
Yet we have been fed and clothed till now.
And is his hand now waxed short?
Away our doubts and fears away;
The lillies grow and birds are fed, --
His people are nor less than they.
SONG LXXV.
WHEN Israel sinned against their God,
His awful wrath began to flame;
He sent his powerful word abroad,
And fiery serpents instant came;
Fierce pain assailed the guilty host around,
And all attempts of cure were fruitless found.
2 When God does wound, there is none but he
Relief can to the wounded give;
It Is he who sets the captive free,
And bids despairing wretches live!
He speaks; and peace, and gladness fill the soul,
And mercy flows to man without control.
3 He said to Moses graciously,
"Go thou, a brazen serpent make,
"And on a pole exalt it high,
"And let the guilty comfort take:
"Whoever looks to that shall quickly know
"'It Is God who wounds, and he does health bestow."
4 But ye redeemed, lift up your eyes,
And see, what Moses faintly shows,
Christ lifted up for sinners dies!
To save from death rebellious foes!
Whoever, believing, looks to him shall live,
Eternal life is his alone to give.
5 The world he came not to condemn,
As guilty mortals well might fear;
But peace and pardon to proclaim;
This was his gracious errand here.
Our works he wrought -- and justice satisfied,
For us he groaned, and in our stead he died.
6 Let the proud boaster vainly think,
By his own merit God to please;
Or that Christ's work is not enough,
To give the guilty conscience ease.
May that alone for ever be our boast,
Through life our glory, and in death our trust.
SONG LXXVI.
WHEN Christ in poverty appeared,
Was crowned with thorns, and scourged, and slain,
Man's understanding was declared,
And all his boasted wisdom, vain.
2 His haughty pride, alarmed, cried out;
"Shall this despised One, over us reign?
"By him, who thus inglorious died,
"Must we the divine favor gain?
3 "What, shall that worth all men admire,
"Which we rejoice to call our own,
"With God be deemed a thing most vile,
"And all who trust it be undone?
4 "Shall he who is all goodness, ever
"Our aims to please him thus contemn?
"Must we with thieves and murd'rers stand,
"As much obliged to grace as them!"
That boasted dignity of soul
In which man glories, shudders here;
Reas'ners, and Pharisees, take arms,
As if God would unjust appear.
6 Let them presumptuous still go on,
And glory in their fancied worth;
We'll boast the work which Jesus wrought,
And bearing his reproach, go forth!
7 However foolish God's way seems,
It Is wiser than Man's wisdom far:
More strong is his weak way to save,
Than all their schemes of safety are.
8 He scorns the things men most admire,
And chooses what they most despise:
The weak, the mighty to abase;
The foolish, to confound the wise!
9 The valleys raised -- the hills brought low,
Before him all men equal stand:
To whom he will, he mercy shows,
For none deserve it at his hand!
10 But Jesus dying said "'It Is done,"
And God approved -- this gives relief
Even to the vilest, -- for he died
For sinners, and of such the chief.
11 Here Is worth divine in which to trust,
Whoever will boast, come glory here;
Here God can boundless mercy show,
And yet divinely just appear!
SONG LXXVII.
THE victim's flesh, without the camp,
Was burnt, as stained with sin;
Whose blood was for atonement brought,
The holy place within.
2 So Christ, that by his blood he might
His people sanctify,
Loaded with guilt, without the gate,
Was led to groan and die.
3 Though his pure heart, when tempted much,
Never lodged an impious thought;
Yet sovereign grace, the sins of all
His people, on him brought.
4 The earthly church, though ill they meant,
Did yet conspire to show,
(By loading him with heinous crimes)
He was the victim true.
5 With crime's their own, not his, they did
The Just One villify;
With felons vile, they led him sorth,
A felon's death to die.
6 Thus the reproaches of our crimes
Against the Highest done,
Not whence they came, fell back; -- but fell
All on the Holy One.
7 But shall we, dare we, join his foes,
By lowering our esteem
Of him, because he stooped so low
Such wretches to redeem?
8 Nay, rather let us leave the camp,
And unto him go forth,
Bearing our honor, his reproach,
And glory in his worth.
9 Because the sovereign judge of worth
Has put the highest price
On his abasement, and has made
Him Lord of Paradise.
10 Deigned he to come so nigh to us,
As not to count it shame,
To call us brethren? Should we blush
At ought that bears his name?
11 Nay, let us boast in his reproach,
And glory in his Cross:
When he appears, one smile from him
Will far o'erpay our loss.
SONG LXXVIII.
COME brethren, lift up your souls, tune your voices,
And praise the author of your being;
The angelic song the heavenly host rejoices,
Swift to his praise, to his will still on the wing.
Hail! blessed throng,
For your tongue
Still is strung
To the song,
That his mercy endures for ever.
2 To him who made these glorious hosts, celestial habitants,
To praise him, and show forth his glory,
To minister around, as guardians to his saints,
Sojourning in this lower story.
Heavens resound
To his name,
With the sound
Of the theme,
That his mercy endures for ever.
3 To him who inhabits eternity, who made
This beauteous world, and yon glorious heaven,
Who bade to shine yon glorious orbs which roll around your head;
And measure out the morn and even,
Whilst ye gaze
On his ways,
Tune your lays
To his praise,
For his mercy endures forever.
4 To him who from eternity bore us upon his heart;
His love, like himself, is eternal;
Who bare all our sins, and felt the wrathful smart,
From God, wicked men, powers infernal.
For his love,
Most profound,
Still does move,
Knows no bound,
Yea his mercy endures for ever.
5 To him that united his godhead to our nature,
When wretched, accursed, abandoned, forlorn,
Still he is God, still he is man, (mysterious matter,)
Who to own his brotherhood does not scorn.
The curse he,
On the tree,
Bore that we,
Might be free;
For his mercy endures for ever.
6 Reviled, rejected, despised, contemned,
Afflicted, yea poor as a beggar,
Persecuted, perverted, arraigned, condemned,
His cordial was gall and vinegar;
Crucified
Twixt two thieves,
There he died,
Who ever lives;
For his mercy endures for ever.
SONG LXXIX.
WHAT the' these bodies shall decay,
And moulder into dust?
What though this world shall pass away,
As all its glories must?
2 Why let them pass, -- It Is naught to us;
In heaven our treasure lies;
Our hope is there -- there is all our trust,
Where joys unfading rise.
3 New heavens and earth we hope to see,
Where Jesus ever reigns;
Where nothing hurtful ever shall be;
No sorrow, -- sin, -- nor pains.
4 Our eyes no more then dimmed with tears;
No fear shall there be found:
Nor sigh be heard, when Christ appears;
But endless joys abound.
5 We'll cheerful bid these scenes adieu,
Which worldly men most prize:
We Have other glories in our view,
Glories beyond the skies:
6 Glories which never shall decay,
But evermore remain;
While endless ages pass away,
Beginning to begin.
7 These are the times when Christians yet
Shall bliss unbounded share;
Let all who for this mercy wait,
To meet their God prepare.
8 For lo! he comes! Loud anthems raise;
Be his great name adored:
May our last theme be Jesus' praise;
Our song, "Come quickly, Lord:"
SONG LXXX.
WE who need mercy every hour,
And by compassions stand,
Should show that mercy to the poor
Which Jesus does command:
2 In evidence that we have fled
For mercy to his blood;
To bow'ls of grace, which flow in the
Compassions of our God.
3 Think what your need of mercy was,
When all your merit vain
You saw, -- and all mere loss and dung;
How sweet was mercy then?
4 Show forth a sense of all that grace;
Regard the widow's plaint:
With mercy meet the hunger-starved,
Whose faces speak their want.
5 Christ in his members asks your alms;
Speaks in his brethren's cries:
The widow's wail his language is;
And orphans sigh his sighs.
6 The lonely widow, desolate,
With cheerfulness, relieve;
The fatherless commiserate;
Bread to the hungry give.
7 See! how the husbandman his seed
With liberal hand does sow,
In hope of gladning harvest, when
His barns with wealth shall flow;
8 So, we a glorious harvest hope:
Sow sparingly no more; --
We hope to reap eternal life,
A never failing store!
SONG LXXXI.
COME with united voices raise
Your cheerful songs of grateful praise;
And wide proclaim the boundless grace
Of Jesus, King of glory!
2 He bowed the heavens, and came down,
And left for us the eternal throne;
For all our sins he did atone,
That we might share his glory!
3 He who the heavens and earth did make,
Humbled himself even for our sake;
And did the human nature take;
Thus vailing all his glory!
4 A man of sorrows he became,
And bore for us contempt and shame,
While he salvation did proclaim;
And paved our way to glory!
5 For sinners destitute and poor,
He did God's fiercest wrath endure,
That he our pardon might procure,
And lead us into glory!
6 On him his people's guilt was laid;
For them he bowed his gracious head;
And divine justice frowned him dead,
E're we could share his glory!
7 Though well he knew the dreadful sum
That must be paid, he said, "I come;"
He shrunk not back, till all was done,
To bring lost man to glory!
8 His work's complete! naught wanting found!
Here mercy flows, and knows no bound;
And all his saints shall yet be crowned,
To reign with him in glory!
9 O! let us then with transport raise
Our loudest songs of grateful praise;
And evermore adore the grace
Which freely leads to glory!
SONG LXXXII.
THIS is the day on which the Lord
Who loved us, and gave
Himself a sacrifice for us,
Was raised from the grave.
2 He brought with him the peace divine
By his own blood procured;
The world can give no peace like this,
By his life well secured.
3 Death's pangs, about the prince of life,
As waves against a rock
Did dash themselves, -- and broken were;
For he could bear the shock.
4 Death could not hold the Son of God,
Nor could that Holy One
Corruption see, whose worth our sins
Could expiate alone.
5 The Father resting in his love,
To life the Son has raised;
As light from fire, so shined he forth
From wrath divine appeased.
6 His merit infinite prevailed;
His blood again him brought
From all the wrath our sins deserved,
And our redemption wrought.
7 The Holy Spirit quickened him,
The first born of the dead;
And all that power which works in us,
He showed first in our Head.
8 Then let us hate the sins which caused
The dying of our Lord;
Let us rejoice in him our life,
And in his praise accord.
9 God's mercies we will ever sing;
Good Will gave him to die;
Complaisance raised him again;
To reign eternally:
10 He lives for ever as our Priest,
Our Prophet, and our King,
On Zion mount, where glory shines;
And there he will us bring.
11 Through him our access unto God
By faith is bold and free;
Through him the Father's near to us;
His Sp'rit gives liberty.
12 His life on the right hand of God,
The pledge is of our life,
When he returns again, and ends
The long continued strife,
13 By putting death and all our foes
Beneath our feet, and us
Advancing high to reign with him
In life most glorious.
14 Then let us look for him with whom
Our life is safe and sure;
And let us die to this vain life;
And patiently endure,
15 Till he who is our life appear;
And then shall we with him
In glory shine; and endless joy
Shall fill our souls to brim.
SONG LXXXIII.
GLORY to God, now mercy reigns
For ever on the throne;
And grace flows free, through Jesus' worth,
To sinners, who have none.
2 His blood can cleanse from every sin;
His worth gives sure relief:
'Twas sinners whom he came to save,
And even of them the chief.
3 It Is not by any worth of ours,
Nor works which we have done,
That God is pleased; -- He Is pleased alone
In his beloved Son.
4 No sacrifice which man could bring,
Could calm the guilty breast;
But Christ complete atonement made:
This, only This, gives rest.
5 He is the rock established sure
On which firm hope to build:
Hell's utmost malice threats in vain,
While he is our strength and shield.
6 His work is perfect, and outweighs
Guilt's aggravating load!
Infinite virtue's in his blood,
For it is the blood of God!
SONG LXXXIV.
HOW glorious is thy name
Through all the ransomed host,
O worthy Lamb! -- who came
To seek and save the lost!
2 Thou art beyond compare
Most precious in our sight!
Than sons of men more fair;
And infinite in might!
3 Thy perfect work divine
Makes us for ever blessed:
Here truth and mercy shine;
And men with God do rest.
4 Thy ways are far above
The ways of men, O God!
Above their thoughts thy love,
In saving by thy blood.
5 Let us count all things loss
That Jesus we may win:
Let Us glory in his cross,
And leave the paths of sin.
6 In him let us rejoice!
Salvation he has wrought:
Be his commands our choice:
For with his blood we are bought.
SONG LXXXV.
THUS says the church's Head,
Judge of the quick and dead,
Quickly I come:
Let my redeemed pray,
O Lord! make no delay;
Hasten that happy day:
Lord, quickly come.
2 Let us, with one accord,
Shout our returning Lord;
Welcome him near:
Soon shall he come again;
Soon shall begin his reign;
Soon shall his foes be slain;
Soon he will appear.
3 Earthquakes and storms attend;
Rocks, hills, and mountains rend;
Who shall abide?
Heavens melt, and thunders roar;
Seas rage and rend the shore;
Hope sinks, to rise no more;
Rocks cannot hide.
4 See how the lightnings blaze!
Jesus his wrath displays;
Vengeance appears:
Lift up your heads with joy,
Ye suffering company;
Now your redemption's nigh:
Banish your fears.
5 Jesus who died for sins,
Now in his glory shines,
Claiming his own:
"Father, I will (says he)
"Those thou have given me,
"Should all my glory see,
"Sharing my throne."
6 Well may the ransomed throng
Make sovereign grace their song,
Mercy adore:
For all their works are done
By him who fills the throne;
Praise to the Lamb alone
For evermore.
7 Now shall the scarlet whore
Shed blood of saints no more;
Boasting her slain:
Now wrath has filled her cup;
Now she drinks vengeance up;
Torments, devoid of hope;
Endless her pain.
SONG LXXXVI. REV. xix. 16.
WHEN the King of Kings comes,
When the King of Kings comes;
We shall have a joyful day,
When the King of Kings comes.
2 We'll see the righteous cause prevail,
And all debates decided well,
And all mouths stopped which lies do tell;
When the King of Kings comes.
3 When the trump of God calls,
And the last of foes falls;
We shall have a joyful day,
When the King of Kings comes.
4 We'll see the saints raised from the dead,
And all together gathered,
And made like to their glorious Head;
When the King of Kings comes.
5 When the Lord from heaven comes,
And the host of heaven comes;
We shall have a joyful day,
When the King of Kings comes.
6 We'll see the nations broken down,
Even kingdoms now of great renown,
And the saints enjoy the crown;
When the King of Kings comes.
7 When this world's course is run,
And the judgment is begun;
We shall have a joyful day,
When the King of Kings comes.
8 We'll see the sons of God well known,
All spotless to their Father shown,
And Jesus his poor brethren own;
When the King of Kings comes.
9 When the foes distress comes,
And the Church's rest comes;
We shall have a joyful day,
When the King of Kings comes.
10 We'll see the man of sin destroyed,
And all his helpers sore annoyed,
And freedom full by saints enjoyed;
When the King of Kings comes.
11 We'll see the New Jerusalem,
It fullness, and its matchless frame,
Surpassing all report and same;
When the King of Kings comes.
12 We'll see all things by him restored,
And the Lord alone adored,
By all the saints with one accord;
When the King of Kings comes.
SONG LXXXVII.
WONDROUS patience toward them,
Who do still profane thy name,
Thou art showing; yet the more
Thankless we provoke! therefore
What is man that thou should mind,
Such a wretch in such a kind!
1 Abused patience, into wrath
Should be turned, all reason says;
And rich goodness still despised,
Should bring us to hell surprised.
What is man that thou should mind,
Such a wretch in such a kind!
3 Yet thy mercy ent'red in,
Mercy great, forgiving sin;
And when sin did much abound,
More abundant grace was found:
What is man that thou should mind,
Such a wretch in such a kind!
4 Where sin reigned unto death,
Conquering grace gives life and breath
To love divine, -- and Jesus reigns
Over the fruit of all his pains.
What is man that thou should mind,
Such a wretch in such a kind!
5 For his soul did travail sore,
To bring forth to God full store
Of living sons, that he the first
Born from the dead, should rule the rest.
What is man that thou should mind,
Such a wretch in such a kind!
6 Justice says that we should live,
And to our redeemer give
Tribute due of thanks and praise,
Singing in his righteous ways.
What is man that thou should mind,
Such a wretch in such a kind!
7 Is it not our service due
To his yoke our necks to bow?
After him the cross to bear,
Whose cross frees us from all fear?
What is man that thou should mind,
Such a wretch in such a kind!
SONG LXXXVIII.
WHEN I, a sinner, think on death,
It yields me great relief,
That Christ endured the cross, and died
For sinners, even the chief.
2 And that he rose, and comes again,
Full fraught with life and power,
To raise our bodies, that they may
Corruption see no more.
3 But I am puzzled still to think,
When all our members die,
How these our spirits, separate,
Can either live or be.
4 Since our souls' life consists in thought;
How can we further think,
When all our instruments of thought
Are utterly extinct?
5 Fear not, says Jesus, follow me,
I past that state before;
The glory round me to your souls
A clothing shall restore.
6 Your souls departing trust to me,
And to my care commend:
Death's keys I have; and from it is sting
I can your souls defend.
7 When this your house of earth's dissolved,
You shall not naked be;
A house eternal in the heavens
Shall cover you with me.
8 Abundant entrance I Will give you
Into my kingdom blessed,
There present to abide with me,
Of heavenly house possessed.
9 Think how the moon's opacous globe,
And how the planets bright,
A being have among the orbs
Who minister the light.
10 Do they not shine, by dwelling in
The bright, the living rays,
Which that refulgent orb, the sun,
Through all the world displays.
11 So you by me, the fount of light,
The sun of righteousness,
As lesser lights, with borrowed rays,
Shall shine in holiness.
12 Our body's absence is no loss:
For, says his faithful word,
That absence fully is supplied
By presence with the Lord.
13 Our mortal shall be clothed upon
With immortality;
Mortality shall swallowed be
Of life eternally.
14 And in due time, when loosed from death,
Our bodies also shall
Within these mansions, near the Lord,
Reside through ages all.
15 While in this house then, let us live
Unto the Lord, that when
He comes in glory, we with him
May ever live. -- AMEN.
SONG LXXXIX.
SEE the bright morning star,
Shoots his beams from afar,
And ushers the day from on high!
Now the night flees away,
Now the shadows decay,
And the morning of glory draws nigh.
2 O ye Christians keep guard,
That ye be not o'erpow'r'd,
With surfeits, and cares of this world;
Stand ye fast and be strong,
Midst the foes you're among,
Till vengeance on them shall be hurled.
3 Then exalted on high,
Like the stars in the sky,
In glory forever you will shine;
For the Savior you will see,
Who expired on the tree,
Even Jesus the man all divine.
SONG XC.
THE Lord, the Savior reigns,
Praise him in lofty strains,
He reigns above;
Naught can his kingdom shake,
Nor ever from it take
His Father's love.
The powers of earth and hell,
With wrath and anger smell,
Because his brethren tell,
Their Lord is King.
2 But all their mighty noise,
Cannot mar his people's joys,
In him their King;
Angels with them combine,
And all together join,
Of him to sing;
For he is their only light,
Of God the image bright,
And he shall rule with might,
Eternal King.
3 His foes do fret in vain,
His power he will maintain,
As Lord of all:
He soon will rend the skies,
With vengeance in his eyes,
And crush them all;
The saints shall then appear,
Their Lord's own likeness wear,
Delivered from all fear,
By Christ their King.
4 That day will soon arrive;
By faith then let us live,
In Christ our Lord;
Nor care for poverty,
But joy because that he
Gives us his word.
That when he comes again,
All who the fight maintain,
With him on earth shall reign;
For Christ is King.
ELEGIES.
ELEGY I.
WHAT is our life in this vain world?
At best, but as a taper,
Which shines away -- We blaze a while,
Then vanish like a vapor.
2 Vain are our cares, as vain our hopes,
And boastings of tomorrow:
We mind not, that, through sin, we are born
To trouble and to sorrow.
3 The breath of life is still exposed
To many thousand dangers;
And death is sure: the case know well,
Nor to the cure be strangers.
4 Incline the ear and come to me;
Your souls shall live in hearing:
Your life is hid with me in God,
Reserved to my appearing.
5 Fear not, I am that living One,
Who unsting'd death by dying:
Take up your cross, relieve the poor,
Me follow, self-denying.
6 For see, I live for evermore,
From death's hand to receive you,
To reign in endless life with me:
My word shall never deceive you.
7 Then, death, where is thy sting? O grave,
Where is thy mighty conquest?
Thy sting is sin; its strength (...)
The cross thy power has (...).
8 Our souls to thee we do commend,
Lord of the dead and living:
In life and death we'll cleave to thee;
None perish thee believing.
ELEGY II.
WRAPPED in the shades of death! no more
That friendly face I see;
Empty, ah! empty every place,
Once so well filled by thee.
2 What made thy comely presence dear,
My heart with sorrow swells;
Yet what endeared thee most entire,
With us forever dwells.
3 The truth divine did live in thee;
That truth shall never die;
What breathed sweet odor from thy lips,
Embalms thy memory.
4 He dwells in God who dwells in love,
Yet echoes round thy grave; --
Blessed they, who thee, eternal God!
Their habitation have.
5 Here Is room for us; we'll mourn in hope,
Lament with thankful voice;
Lo! quickly comes the Lord, to give
His church unfading joys.
ELEGY III.
AS billows roll to meet their fate,
And break upon the shore;
So rolls that billow, human life,
So breaks, and is no more.
2 Hushed in the grave, life's busy dream
Disturbs no more thy breast:
There empty glittering joys no more
Conspire to thwart thy rest.
2 Nor sin, nor future cares, invade
That land of long repose,
Where rest and mortals meet at last,
And are no longer foes.
4 Calm is the deep, and smooth the sea,
When hushed from every breeze;
So calm the mind, so smooth the soul,
When ruffling passions cease.
5 (...) in the grave, our last retreat,
You view at distance there
The vain pursuits of busy man,
And smile at human care.
6 Blessed be the grave whose earth contains
What Is dear to Jesus' breast:
Let every soul whom Jesus warms
Pronounce the relics blessed.
7 A time shall come, when life shall yet
Revive this mouldering clay,
And these closed eyes shall yet awake,
And Jesus' form survey.
8 The dead to flatter, would be vain,
Or speak in praise of dust:
For that is all that is found of man,
Or human pride at last.
9 It Is not my task with flattering tongue,
Thy virtues to commend:
The man whom never spot deformed,
Was never Jesus' friend.
10 Heaven in rewarding Jesus' worth,
Thy merits shall unfold;
Enough for thee -- that Jesus died;
And so thy bell is tolled.
ELEGY IV.
THOU sacred word of matchless might!
O Word of truth divine!
Blessed be the day when first thy light
Among men began to shine.
2 Aside from thee, where shall we look,
Whose lives are but a span?
Nothing is found in nature's book
Like hope for dying man.
3 Eternal darkness must have held
Uninterrupted sway;
Had not that darkness been dispelled
By thy all-chearing ray.
4 Why then is thy sacred light and bliss
Despised by great and small? --
Because the love of darkness is
The common taste of all.
5 But happy, happy it is for man,
Thy light still shines abroad;
That still thy page displays the plan,
And grand designs of God.
6 Then tell us, sacred word, when shall
The Lord's redeemed arise?
When shall they hear his powerful call,
To meet him in the skies?
7 When the arch-angel's trump shall blow,
His dead the sound shall hear:
And rising from the tombs below,
Shall meet him in the air.
8 But deign, O sacred Word, to say
If he Man's sorrows feels;
O what concern protracts his stay?
Why stop his chariot-wheels?
9 It Is a concern of boundless grace
And great good will to man;
Long suffering patience stops his pace,
'Till he completes his plan.
10 'Till all the many sons, with whom
The son of God took part,
Shall in the sight of faith, like him,
Learn lowliness of heart.
11 Conformed to him by his employ,
In shame, reproach, and thrall:
Like him, before the cup of joy,
First taste the cup of gall.
12 O then! quick as the lightning darts,
Shall Jesus soon appear,
And heal his people's aching hearts,
And wipe away each tear.
13 The man whose memory we revere,
Drank deep in sorrow's cup,
And learned by disappointments here,
Far better things to hope;
14 Like the first foll'wers of the Lord,
Whose lives and doctrines he
Admired and copied; and their word
To speak was bold and free.
15 This business made him many foes,
Few friends and scanty bread,
And scarcely found he at life's close
A place to lay his head.
16 Yet he complained not, nor repined,
But ever kept in view
That matchless humbleness of mind
Which God's dear Son did show.
17 Patience and hope on every side,
(His comfort and his stay)
Did surely join, his steps to guide,
Else he had lost the way.
18 But patience with the cordial word
Refreshed his memory,
He talked of joys with which the Lord
Rewarded his on high.
19 When hope and patience deign to guide
Man in the narrow way;
With ease they will in the path abide;
Far from it never stray.
ELEGY V.
OUR Elder and our faithful friend,
Who was by us so much beloved,
Death now, from all the ills of life,
To endless glory has removed.
2 To speak his praise is not our theme:
All praise and glory ever be
To him who taught his heart to know
God's boundless grace and mercy free.
3 Led by the unerring hand of him,
Who gives grace to whom he will;
He rose from Babel, to bring forth
Christ's captives, and his word fulfill.
4 Trembling at that enduring word,
The ancient Christian order he
Revived; and now, Christ's little flocks
In order, as at first we see.
5 Before these flocks he cheerful went
In faith and servent charity:
In patient suffering, joyful hope.
And self-denied humility.
6 No lordship over the flocks he claimed;
Their God he led them to revere;
To all God's words regard to show,
And of none else to stand in fear.
7 The love of Christ inflamed his breast
With love and tender care always.
To all who seemed to love that truth,
In which his joy and comfort lay.
8 Ost did his bosom swell with grief,
When he their wants and troubles knew;
And, like a tenderhearted friend,
His love in deed and truth did show.
9 The ease and pleasures of this life
And all its boasted honors vain,
With cheerfulness he did forsake,
The truth of Jesus to maintain.
10 Bold as a lion he appeared,
When for that truth he did contend;
For this no face of man he feared;
But would oppose his dearest friend.
11 Much, much contempt and false reproach,
He did for it with joy endure;
As knowing whom he had believed,
And that his word stands ever sure.
12 The blessed, heavenly, glorious hope
Of endless life, through Jesus' cross,
Was the great prize he had in view,
For this he counted all things loss.
13 Even in old age, when others fail,
He still in rich fruits did increase,
Until his course was fully run,
And then -- his latter end was peace.
14 The world was crucified to him,
And he to it was crucified;
By faith of Jesus Christ he lived,
And in the faith of him he died.
15 Let us, dear brethren, follow him,
As he the Lord did follow still;
And show that we remember him,
By studying his Master's will.
16 And though we mourn, let us mourn in hope,
Our friend, though dead, shall rise again;
Shall rise in glory, and with Christ,
Forever and forever reign.
