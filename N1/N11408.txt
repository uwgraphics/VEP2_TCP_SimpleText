Cruelty and Barbarity of the BRITISH Troops, by Destroying the above mentioned

BY ELISHA RICH, Minister of the Gospel.
I.
AMERICANS pray lend an Ear
And you a solemn Tale shall hear
'Twas on the seventeenth of JUNE,
Men were cut down all in their bloom.
II.
GOD grant it is memory may lie
(...) witness against TYRANNY,
Also against NEW-ENGLAND'S sin,
Which has let cruel TYRANTS in!
III.
Whose bloody minds are to devour,
For which they do Exert their power.
They would establish SLAVARY
Or else our Land in ruin lay,
IV.
Last JUNE, upon the seventeenth day.
These Troops for CHARLESTOWN made their way
For to resist our SOLDIERS there,
Who a strong FORT prepairing were.
V.
The SHIPS of WAR had gathered round,
To make our Soldiers quit the ground.
And though some Men by them were slain
Yet still their courage they retain.
VI.
But when those Troops had landed there,
Our Men to fight them did prepare,
And when our Men shot their first round,
Many BRITAINS gasped on the ground.
VII.
They Fought like brave MEN on both sides,
And many a valiant HERO died.
The Earth was soaked with their blood,
And wounded wallow'd in the Flood.
VIII.
So warm a Fight is seldom known,
Men were cut down like Grass that is (...)
And some say Gage who did them 'spie,
Said we that ground too dear shall buy,
IX.
Our Men that fought, they were but few,
Their POWDER being spent, withdrew,
And left the ground unto their foe,
And back again were forced to go.
X.
Though BRITISH TROOPS the ground did (...)
Yet many more of them were slain,
The best intelligence does tell,
One THOUSAND and near FIFTY fell.
XI.
It Is thought they lost five to our one,
Although our Men were forced to run,
They bought the victory so dear
It did not much increase our fear,
XII.
These Savage Troops CHARLESTOWN, did (...)
And it to Ashes did expire,
The TOWN now in destruction lies,
The sight affects our hearts and eyes.
XIII.
Why is this desolation made?
Why is the Tyrants banner spread?
Why is he suffered thus to reign
And so far Victory obtain.
XIV.
NEW ENGLAND search and know the cause,
Have thou not broken GOD's blessed LAWS,
For which thy GOD does thee chastize,
And turns thy Friends to Enemies.
XV.
Would thou obtain thy LIBERTY,
Then break all bands of slavery,
And do thou LIBERTY proclaim
To all that have a human frame.
XVI.
But if oppression here is found?
Can you with victory be crowned,
No, no, be sure this cannot be,
While thou thy neighbors do not free.
XVII.
O may we never forget the Day,
When Charlestown in it is ruins lay,
And many of our Sons did die
And ^^ed before their enemy.
XVIII.
MOTHERS Lament their Sons that fell,
And Wife's the loss of Husbands tell,
Their Cries may cause the hardest heart,
With their distress to bear a part.
XIX.
Come mourn with them and for them pray
That GOD would turn their night to day,
Make up their loss by special Grace,
That they with joy may see his face.
XX.
Let Us view the rod that GOD has sent
And for our many sins relent,
So that God's wrath again may cease
And may restore our land to peace-
XXI.
That TYRANTS may no more arise
And brand their Swords with haughty eyes,
May Heaven cause their pride to cease,
That so Christ's kingdom may increase.
XXII.
May GOD bring on the happy day
When carnal Swords no more shall ^^ay,
And CHRIST as Prince of peace shall reign,
And War be learnt no more again.
XXIII.
Then (...) shall lay oppression by,
Their neighbors good shall not envy,
Nor covet what is not their own
Nor tread the poorer people down.
XXIV.
That day will bring great joy to all,
That on the name of GOD do call,
When Wars and fightings shall no more,
Spread desolation as before.
XXV.
Then Nations shall together join,
And Kings their septres shall resign,
To JESUS as their Priest and KING,
And shall to him their honors bring.
XXVI.
Thus CHRIST shall have a large increase,
And shall his kingdom rule in peace,
The CHURCH in him shall rest secure
While SUN and MOON and STARS endur.
