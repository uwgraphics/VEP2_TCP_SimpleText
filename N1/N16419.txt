TO NURSE LOVECHILD.
DEAR NURSE,
YOUR Diligence and Tenderness in bringing up my Children, will always command
my utmost Endeavors to serve you. And as I cannot but approve, so I recommend
this your laudable Design, of compiling a Collection of Songs, so fit for the
Capacities of Infants. both in Words and Tunes, by which they are often, lulled
to Rest, when cross, and in great Pain. The first Songs are very suitably
composed for a Baby: but pray be careful, not to sing them too loud; lest you
frighten the Child, when you design to lull it to Sleep* or divert it: For you
know, great Care ought to be observed as to the early Sense of Children, some
arriving to a Knowledge, and Notice of Animals and their Sounds, much earlier
than others.

And now I am speaking of Frights, I will recommend a Method that is very
useful, to prevent them in some Cases, such as in making them familiar with
Domestic, or other Animals, as the Dog, Cat, Horse, Cow, etc. by persuading
them to stroke, or touch them, as they happen to fall in their Way, which will
make them as they grow up, bold in their Carriage, to all such Creatures,
otherwise timorous to a Misfortune.

But this in particular, I insist on, above all others, that you never mention
a Bull Beggar, Tom Poker, Raw Head and Bloody Bones, etc. lest you make such
frightful Impressions on their tender Minds, as may never be eradicated.

There is another Concern I mention as to their bodily Preservation; that is,
as many of the following Songs while the Nurses are singing them, are attended
with dancing, or exercising Infants, I seriously entreat all who have the Care
of Children, not to swing them by the Arms with their Heels backwards, lest
they dislocate their Backs, which has frequently been the Ruin of many a fine
Child.

I hope your experienced Sister Nurses will not be displeased, as my Design is
not to direct them: But as it very often happens, that young Girls are
entrusted with the Care of Children, I think these Precautions, and Songs, may
be of Use to them, as they have been to,

Yours, etc.

ARTIFICIAL MEMORY FOR INFANTS; WHEREBY They may Acquire THE Knowledge of
Animals, AND SOME Of their SOUNDS, BEFORE They can Go or Speak.
ALTHOUGH this Invention is calculated for the Diversion of Infants, yet it
will afford great Pleasure to the Parent, or Nurse, to observe the Progress,
and surprising Difference in the early Sense of their Children.

The Method I propose, is, that you first show the Child, the following Animals
one at a Time, and pronounce its Sound, as for Example,

Ask which is the DOG? Then point to it, then ask what the DOG says, then say,

BOW, WOW, WOW.

And so on to the rest, by which Means, the Child in a short Time, will be able
to do the same itself.

Bow, Wow, Wow.



Mew, Mew, Mew.

LITTLE BOY lived by himself.


WHEN I was a little Boy,
I lived by myself,
All the Bread and Cheese I got,
I hid upon my Shelf.
The Rats and the Mice,
They made such a Strife,
I was forced to go to London,
To buy me a Wife:
The Streets were so broad,
And the Lanes were so narrow,
I was forced to bring my Wife
Home in a Wheelbarrow;
The Wheelbarrow broke,
And gave my Wife a Fall.
The Duce take the Wheelbarrow,
My Wife and all.


An OLD WOMAN and she sold PUDDINGS.


THERE was an old Woman,
And she sold Puddings and Pyes,

And cold Pyes and Puddings to sell,
Wherever she goes,
You may follow her by the smell.
