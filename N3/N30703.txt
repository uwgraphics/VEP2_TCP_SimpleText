A Warning to Young and Old: In the Execution of William Wieer, at Boston, the
21st of November, 1754, for the Murder of William Chism, on the 6th of April
last.
I.
BEHOLD good People now I pray,
And give you Heed to what I say;
Your due Attention I do crave,
That you the Benefit may have.
II.
The Subject of my present Rhyme,
Is Will'm Wieer's wicked Crime:
A Crime for which he now must die,
By his own Act of Cruelty.
III.
Poor Chism he in Anger slew,
Without a Provocation too;
This poor Man's Life he took away,
Not having Time, one Word to say.
IV.
And now his Passion he witholds,
And to his great Surprise beholds,
The Wound was Mortal which he gave,
But hopes for Mercy yet to have.
V.
But where shall he for Mercy Cry?
But to the Sovereign GOD most high:
Who has in sacred Writ declared,
That such Men's Lives shall not be spared.
VI.
Ah! Passion now, that ran so high,
As to ascend the Clouds and Sky;
Where there is neither End nor Bound:
But Murder! It Is a dreadful Sound.
VII.
Now Wieer for this horrid Crime,
Is doomed to die before his Time;
He did not intend, (as he does say,)
To take poor Chism's Life* away.
VIII.
But whether he did or no, it is true,
By GOD's just Laws, he has but due;
For Murder is a dreadful Fact,
Which none I hope will dare Transact.
IX.
Here Is an Example for you all,
Both for the Great, as well as Small;
The Old as well as Young may be
Accustomed to this fatal Tree.
X.
That GOD whose Ways are just and true,
Does evr'y wicked Way pursue;
Therefore be always on your Guard,
In all your Doings please the LORD:
XI
Correct your Passions in due Time,
Lest you commit this horrid Crime;
The Crime of Murder, few's so great,
And you repent when it is too late.
XII.
Keep free from Slander and from Pelf,
And love your Neighbor as yourself,
Be thus to them both kind and true,
As you would have them be so to you.
XIII.
Let GOD's Commands be your Delight,
In all your Dealings be upright:
Be always careful to fulfill
The Sixth Command, ( Thou shall not Kill.)
XIV.
It Is GOD's free, rich and sovereign Grace,
That we are not in this poor Man's Place;
Then let us shun all wicked Ways,
Before the Gallows end our Days.
XV.
Happy they will be, and happy thrice,
Who will take Counsel and Advice,
From this poor Man's unhappy Fate,
To view their own most sad Estate.
XVI.
If GOD's Commands you do obey,
Depend on Him, and often pray,
He will in his abundant Grace,
Preserve you in your righteous Ways.
XVII.
His glorious Grace will then come down
And all your wicked Passions drown:
Then take the Wing, to JESUS fly,
And see thy GOD above the Sky.
FINIS.
