Advertisement.
THE two following Odes were composed on their respective Occasions, merely for
the Author's Amusement and the Entertainment of his Friends; but their
Importunity and favorable, not to say partial, Judgment of them, have induced
him to present them to public View, not without some Hope, that they may meet
with a kind Reception, if not by their intrinsic Merit, at least by their
Relation to those important and interesting Events which gave them Birth.

As the Life of Lord HOW was unspeakably valuable, so his Death is, and it
were astonishing if it were not, most sincerely and universally lamented: And
indeed I know not, whether the sad Catastrophe which succeeded his Fall, though
attended with the Loss of so many Lives, has occasioned more Regret, than the
single Fate of that illustrious and promsing young Hero. But the Reduction of
Louisbourg to his Britannick Majesty must needs give inexpressible Pleasure,
and afford a most delightful Prospect, to every one, in proportion as he
apprehends its Importance to, and prizes the Welfare of, the British Colonies
in America,

In this View of Things, and a critical Humor apart, the Author hopes these
Performances with all their Faults (which he is ignorant of) may afford a
pleasing Entertainment to his Fellow Subjects, even at this Distance of Time;
and if so, he would have been glad if his Distance from the Press, etc. had not
prevented their being somewhat more seasonable.

If the Character of Lord HOW be, as doubtless it is, incomplete it must be
considered that this Sketch of it was copied from the Voice of Fame; and if any
Gentlemen of the Army or Navy seem to be neglected, or not mentioned according
to their Rank, in the Ode on the Reduction of Louisbourg, I hope it will be
imputed rather to the Ignorance than the Partiality, of

The AUTHOR.

The Unfortunate HERO; An ODE.
I.
COME, weeping Muse, descend and bring
Thy well-known Lute, thy doleful Notes renew, Refering to some former
Compositions occasioned by public Misfortunes.

With trembling hand strike each complaining String,
(Thy drooping Brows crowned with funereal Yew)
And in soft plaintive Numbers sing
The hapless Fortune of the Brave,
The cruel Triumphs of the Grave,
And be the Tribute paid,
The Tribute justly due
To HOWE's illustrious Shade:
With pensive Strains attend his Hearse,
His noble God-like Deeds rehearse,
And crown his Memory with a grateful Verse.
II.
Come all ye generous Souls that know,
What it is to feel a patriot Woe,
Whose Countries Losses make your Sorrows rise,
Whose Bosoms bleed when Valor dies,
Deplore the Hero's Fate;
And while the Muse complains
And in funereal Strains
Describes a Loss so formidably great,
Lay every smiling Joy aside,
Let undissembled Sorrows flow,
And in a briny Tide
Give your soft Passions vent, and all disolve in Woe.
III.
From distant Lands the Hero came,
His heart all glowing with a sacred Flame
By Britain's Genius fired,
By no mean mercenary Hopes inspired,
Nor in pursuit of Fame;
But bent on a disinterested Aim,
A noble Aim, divinely great,
To save our sinking Country from the Jaws of Fate.
Lo! He spontaneous leaves
The Joys of peaceful Life,
To try the Chance of martial Strife,
Intrepid braves
The Winds and Waves,
And all the Dangers of the raging Main;
Danger and Toil in vain oppose his Way,
Our northern Regions to his View display
Then frightful Wilds in vain;
Their frightful Wilds beheld him nobly dare,
Bound forth impetuous to the War,
Nor dread the awful Horrors of the wild Campaign.
IV.
Noble without a Thought of Pride,
And great without Disdain,
HOW well could lay the Pomp of Life aside
(When for Deliverance his Country sighed)
And fare as meanly as the rural Swain;
Though bred in all the Elegance of Taste,
Inspired with martial Rage,
The heroic Champion well disdained
The unmanly Softness of the Age,
Nor would he be a Guest
Where fulsome Lux'ry reigned:
The British Interest all his Care,
His Patriot Soul
Could well control
The Appetites of youthful Blood;
Content with Soldier's Fare,
He lived on simple Food,
Refused the Pleasures of the sparkling Bowl,
And quenched his Thirst in the pure crystal Flood.
V.
Vice in our Army long had held
Her arbitary Reign,
And Guilt enormous with a fouler Stain
Defiled the Martial Field.
Than crimson Seas of Blood, or Myriads of Slain.
Virtue, celestial Maid,
Long, long concealed her Head;
Till, shocked by Crimes of monstrous Size,
The blushing Goddess, forced to yield,
Indignant left the guilty Field,
And fled, a ^erst Astrea, to her native Skies.
But when kind Providence from far
Called HOW, her Vot'ry, to the Field of War,
There she resumed her former Throne,
There, in the midst of Arms,
And with peculiar Charms
The lovely Goddess shone,
And clad the favorite Youth in glories like her own.
The favorite Youth himself obeyed
The Dictates of the heavenly Maid,
And taught his Legions to confess her Sway;
But Vice, infernal Monster, saw
Her Empire overthrown,
And, by his great Example struck with Awe,
Or trembling at his Frown,
Forsook the hallowed Camp, or shunned the Face of Day.
VI.
Others could plan the future War,
Threaten Destruction from afar,
And make a mighty show;
Vainglorious count a numerous Host,
Of mere ideal Vict'ries boast,
And triumph over the yet unconquered Foe:
Modest though valiant, and though youthful wise,
Young HOW could shine in Council too;
But he had Hands as well as Voice,
While others talked with mighty Noise,
The active HOW was formed to DO.
How glowed with Love and Wonder every Heart,
Ye Sons of Battle, say,
When in each Toil he bore a Part,
In every Danger led the Way!
How did his great Example fire each Breast,
When he abridg'd his Hours of Rest,
And in continual Labors worried out the Day!
Such were the Warriors of the Days of old,
Such Cincinnatus, such Camillus bold,
And the great Scipio's rose; -- duo fulmina belli
Scipiadas. --


Heroes like these extensive Vengeance hurled
On Rome's perfidious Foes,
Ever Luxuries pernicious Charms
Had spoiled the Temper of her Arms;
By Thunderbolts like these she once subdued the World.
VII.
And so perhaps had Thou,
If Heaven had deigned to spare
Thy useful Life, illustrious HOW!
Obliged Canadian Force to bow,
And put a period to the doubtful War:
We fondly hoped to see thy Sword
Deal sudden Vengeance on the Foe,
Their meritorious Doom,
By some important Blow
We hoped to see our Rights restored,
And shout thee living and victorious home;
But ah! our pleasing Dreams are over,
Our flattering Prospects are no more,
Our Hopes are buried in thy Grave,
Where is the Man, lamented HOW!
Like thee to head our Army now,
So active and so brave?
VIII.
But check thy passions, Muse, and tell
How closed a Life employed so well,
How brave the Hero fought and how divine he fell. --
Behold! with what a noble Mien,
All animated yet serene.
He meets the ambush'd Foe!
Warm in his Countries Cause,
And bold as the famed Marlbro was,
His Sword the ardent Warrior draws,
And aims the fatal Blow.
Intrepid lo! he stands,
And firm maintains his Ground,
Inspiring with new Life his martial Bands,
And scattering Fate around;
Till the dire Ball, aimed with delib'rate Art,
By some base Villain guiltier than the rest,
Impetuous penetrates his Breast,
And lodges in his Heart:
Expiring with the Wound,
Down sinks the Hero to the Ground,
And as he falls he cries,
"Fight on my Friends, and trust the Skies,
"Nor let your Courage languish, though your Leader dies;
"No; save your Country, and revenge my Death." --
He can no more. -- Fate stops his Breath,
Eternal Slumbers seal his Eyes,
His Spirit issues in a Flood of Gore,
And HOW, the great, the good, the valiant, is no more.
IX.
Curse on the Wretch, that aimed the fatal Ball!
And can ye, Britons, see your Leader fall
Alone* and fall in vain?
No, give the Wretch the Fate he gave,
Let him not triumph over the Brave;
But feel just Vengeance for an Hero slain. --
It Is done -- the righteous Skies
Forbid the rising Boast,
From the surrounding Host
His Crime recoils upon his Head,
The deathful Lead vindictive flies,
Quick stops his guilty Breath,
Avenges HOWE's untimely Death,
And down the Villain drops, to wait upon his Shade.
X.
But Thee, dear Youth, long shall thy Country mourn,
With grateful Tears bedew thy Dust,
And future Ages, to thy Memory just,
Shall dress with Glory thy distinguished Urn:
Long as these Regions know the insulting Gaul,
America shall still deplore thy Fall;
And while the historic Page
Transmits to each succeeding Age
B -- 's Disgrace and A -- 's Shame,
To future Times,
And distant Climes,
Loud shall resound thy Name,
And shine with Honor in the Rolls of Fame.

An ODE, On the Surrender of Louisbourg, July 27, 1758.
I.
IT IS done, it is done,
The Day is won,
At length the destined Blow is given;
Though long our Woes,
And strong our Foes,
Our Cause is still the Care of Heaven.
II.
What though the Field
Often saw us yield.
The Palm to the victorious Foe,
And tell-tale Fame
Revealed our Shame,
When Waves can roll or Winds can blow?
III.
Our ardent Cries
Have reached the Skies,
And gracious Heaven at length repays
Our martial Toils,
Propitious smiles,
And bids us hope for happier Days.
IV.
Ye Sons of Pride!
No more deride,
Nor vainly glory in your Towr's;
For to your Woe,
Ye Vaunters know,
Your boasted Louisbourg is ours:
V.
Ye Slaves forbear,
Nor longer dare,
With your bold Taunts insult the Brave;
Hear to your Shame,
The Voice of Fame,
" France in her turn has fed the Grave.
VI.
No more forlorn,
Ye Britons, mourn
No more regret our late Alarms;
In sprightly Strains,
Ye jovial Swains,
Now sing the Power of British Arms.
VII.
No more, no more,
As heretofore,
Shall Gallia uncontrolled destroy;
Then wipe your Tears,
Dismiss your Fears,
And give your smiling Country Joy.
VIII.
With Heart and Voice,
Let all rejoice,
And every loyal British Tongue
In Concert join
Its Shouts with mine,
And aid the Triumphs of my Song.
IX.
In thankful Lays,
First sing his Praise,
Who deigns to make our Land his Care,
Whole Breath inspires
Heroic Fires,
The Lord of Hosts the GOD of War.
X.
He fires the Zeal
Which Patriots seal,
It Is He that makes our Sages wise;
(...) feels the Flame,
Pursues his Aim,
And (...) the Counsels of the Skies.
XI.
Britons it is He
That rules the Sea,
He bids its raging Billows rise;
At his Control,
They cease to roll,
And all the mighty Tumult dies.
XII.
His sovereign Sway
The Winds obey
That sweeps along the watery Wasle;
He fills your Sails
With Southern Gales,
Or sends the furious Northern Blast.
XIII.
The Winds, his Slaves,
Across the Waves
Well wast our mighty Squadrons over;
Secure they sweep
The faithless Deep,
Hnd reach at length the hostile Shore.
XIV.
Safe in his Care,
Our Navy there
Rides out the Siege in solemn State;
While France, in pain,
Attempts in vain
To save her Louisbourg from Fate.
XV.
In vain she sighs,
In vain she tries,
By Force to ward the dire Alarms;
By Heaven detained
The Fleet ordained
To check the Progress of our Arms;
XVI.
But ours is seen,
Like Neptune's Queen,
The Sovereign Mistress of the Flood:
Nor France can brave,
Nor Tempests stave,
The Fleet that boasts a Guardian-God.
XVII.
Each martial Band
He guards to land,
And fires amid the wild uproar;
Over dashing Waves,
And gaping Graves,
Fearless they climb the rocky Shore*
XVIII.
The roaring Main,
And Rocks in vain,
In all their dreadful Horrors rise;
In vain our Foes
Presume to oppose
The Heav'n-directed Enterprise;
XIX.
Divinely led,
Our Soldiers shed
Fear and Confusion on the Foe;
Amazed they yield,
Or quit the Field,
And trembling dread the impending Blow:
XX.
The Blow at Length,
To Gallic Strength,
By Britain's awful Thunder given,
The important Blow,
For which we owe
Sincerest Thanks t'indulgent Heaven.
XXI.
Then Briton's join
The Work divine,
Come and address the Power supreme;
In humble Lays,
Your Voices raise,
And shout loud Honors to his Name:
XXII.
Nor let your Tongues
In thoughtless Songs
Prefer a lifeless Sacrifice;
From Hearts on Fire,
Let Thanks aspire,
Like Clouds of Incense to the Skies.
XXIII.
"Almighty Lord! Vid. Exodus xv.1 -- 19.

"Thy conquering Sword
"Has glorious but tremendous Charms;
"What Mortal dare
"With THEE compare?
"How dreadful is a GOD in Arms!
XXIV.
"What Arm but Thine,
"Thou Power Divine!
"Could humble thus the haughty Foe?
"Thy Arm we own;
"Thy Arm alone
"Could deal the dread avenging Blow:
XXV.
"Of Fleet or Host
"We dare not boast
"Lord we confess the Work divine:
"Thee we adore;
"For sovereign Power
"Thine is; and be the Glory Thine. --
XXVI.
Nor must my Song
Forgetful wrong
Our Chiefs, those mighty Bolts of War,
The Thund'rer chose,
To dash our Foes,
And save the People of his Care.
XXVII.
By Martial Skill,
And prudent Zeal, Unus qui nobis cunctando restituis Rem.

AMHERST has earned immortal Fame;
Let Glory shed
On BOSCAWEN's Head,
Such Rays as grace the Hero's Name.
XXVIII.
Be WOLF renowned;
Be LAWRENCE crowned,
And WHITMORE with deserved applause;
Let HARDY shine
In Britain's Line,
And all grow great in Britain's Cause.
XXIX.
Bold Sons of War!
Who nobly dare
Insulting Gallia's bold Alarms
At length repay,
And wipe away
Dishonor cast on British Arms:
XXX.
Through every Age,
The historic Page
Their Deeds with Honor shall rehearse*
And Bards unborn
Shall well adorn
Their Names embalmed in lofty Verse.
XXXI.
Mean while, ye Swains
On British Plains,
Their Praise in rural Songs begin*
Attend ye Fair,
The Wreaths prepare,
And dress their Brows in living Green.
XXXII.
Let Heaven's kind Smiles,
And Galli^ Spoils,
Your thankful Thoughts and Tongues employ,
Devoutly gay,
Those Spoils survey,
Britons, and give a Loose to Joy.
XXXIII.
Let Cannons roar
From Shore to Shore,
Heavens guardian Power aloud proclaim,
With awful Voice,
Express our Joys,
And far resound each Hero's Name:
XXXIV.
Let Gallia hear,
Canadia fear,
And savage Nations dare no more
Tempt Britain's Stroke;
But own her Yoke,
And trembling Britain's GOD adore.
FINIS.
