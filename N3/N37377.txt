Convivial Song, Sung at WINDSOR, on the evening of the FOURTH OF JULY.
Composed for the occasion -- by R. TYLER.
TUNE -- " Here Is to our Noble Selves, Boys."

COME fill each brimming glass, boys,
Red or white has equal joys,
Come fill each brimming glass, boys,
And toast your country's glory;
Does any here to fear incline,
And over Columbia's danger whine,
Why let him quaff this generous wine,
He Will tell another story.
II.
Here Is Washington, the brave, boys,
Source of all Columbia's joys,
Here Is Washington, the brave, boys,
Come tile and toast him standing;
For he is the hero firm and brave,
Who all our country's glory gave,
And once again he shall us save,
Our armies bold commanding.
III.
Here Is to the gallant Tar, boys;
Whole cannon's roar our foe annoys,
Here Is to the gallant Tar, boys,
His country's cause defending;
For warlike Truxton's noble name,
Like Nelson's shall extend his fame,
And loud through all the earth proclaim,
His glory never ending.
IV.
Here Is to our native land, boys,
Land of liberty and joys,
Here Is to our native land, boys,
Your grasses raise for drinking;
And be that will not drink this toast,
May he in France of freedom boast,
There dangling on a lantern post,
Or in the Rhone be sinking.
V.
Here Is to our Vermont FAIR, boys,
Pledges bright of Fed'ral joys,
Here Is to our Vermont FAIR, boys,
Fell high to Love and Beauty;
For while we toast their glowing charms,
Their virtue every bosom warms,
We'll die to guard them safe from harms,
It is a Fed'ral duty.
VI.
Here Is to Vermont State, boys,
And all her merly rustic joys,
Here Is to Vermont State, boys,
Columbia's (...)
For while our (...) ascend on high,
And while our (...) mock the sky,
Our Independence, Liberty,
We never will surrender.
VII.
Here Is on the ^^ge of Quincy, boys,
^
Here Is to the Sage of (...)
Who guards (...)
For while we quaff the boozy wine,
And sense and tipsy mirth combine,
With temperate head (...) sublime,
And for our good in thinking.
VIII.
Now come join hand in hand, boys,
M^^ic type of Fed'ral joys,
Now come join hand in hand, boys,
Like brother, brother greeting;
For while our union we pursue,
It Is I and he, and you and you,
Our pleasure all may yet renew
At our next Fed'ral meeting.
