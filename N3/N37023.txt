THE JOVIAL SONGSTER.
HARK! THE JOY-INSPIRING HORN.
HARK! hark! the joy-inspiring horn,
Salutes the rosy, rising morn,
And echoes through the dale;
With clamorous peals the hill, resound,
The hounds quck-scented scour the ground,
And snuff the fragrant gale.
Nor gates nor hedges can impede
The brisk, high-metled, starting steed,
The jovial pack pursue;
Like lightning darting over the plains,
The distant hills with speed he gains,
And fees the game in view.
Her path the timid hare forsakes,
And to the copse for shelter makes,
Three pants awhile for breath;
When now the noise alarms her ear,
Her haunts descry, her fate is near,
She sees approaching death.
Directed by the well-known breeze,
The hounds their trembling victim seize,
She faints, she falls, she dies;
The distant coursers now come in,
And join the loud triumphant din,
'Till echo rends the skies.
THE EARLY HORN.
THE early horn salutes the morn
That gilds this charming place,
With cheerful cries bids echo rise,
And join the jovial chase.
The vocal hills around,
The waving woods,
The crystal floods,
All return the enlivening sound.
COME, ROUSE FROM YOUR TRANCES
COME, rouse from your trances!
The sly morn advances,
To catch fluggish mortals in bed;
Let the horn's jocund note,
In the wind sweetly float,
While the fox from the brake lifts his head:
Now creeping.
Now peeping,
The fox from the brake lifts his head:
Each away to his f^^^d,
Your goodness shall lead,
Come follow, my worshipers, follow,
For the chase all prepare,
See the hounds snuff the air,
Hark, hark, to the huntsman's hallo!
See Reynard breaks over,
Hark Jowler, hark Rover,
The hunters fly over the ground;
Now they skim over the plain,
Now they dart down the lane,
And the hills, woods, and valleys resound,
With dashing,
And splashing,
The hills, woods, and valleys resound;
Then away with full speed,
Your goddess shall lead,
Come follow, my worshippers, follow;
Over hedge, ditch, and gate,
If you stop you're too late,
Hark, hark, to the huntsman's sweet hallo!
MY DOG AND MY GUN.
LET the gay ones and great
Make the most of their fate,
From pleasure to pleasure they run;
Well, who cares a jot?
I envy them not,
While I have my do^ and my gun.
For exercise, air,
To the fields I repair,
With spirits unclouded and light,
The blisses I find
No stings leave behind,
But health and diversion unite.
THE BRISK HORN.
SOUND sound the brisk horn,
'Twill enliven the morn,
And nature replenish with glee,
The valleys around,
Shall rejoice at the sound,
And join in the chorus with me.
Let ladies each night
In cards take delight,
And such dull amusements embrace,
At noon then arise,
Unknown to the joys
Of the health-giving, health-giving chase.
But while they are content,
Why let them frequent
The playhouse, the park, or the ball;
The pleasures I choose,
My time to amuse
Are greatly superior to all.
THE ROSY MORNING.
THE sweet rosy morning
Peeps over the hills,
With blushes adorning
The meadows and fields;
The merry merry merry horn
Calls come come come away,
Awake from your slumber,
And hail the new day.
The stag roused before us
Away seemed to fly,
And pants to the chorus
Of hounds in full cry;
Then follow follow follow
The music chase,
Where pleasure and vigor,
With health you embrace.
The day's sports are over,
Makes blood circle right,
And gives the brisk lover
Fresh charms for the night.
Then let us, let us now enjoy
All we can while we may,
Let love crown the night.
As our sports crown the day.
THE DUSKY NIGHT.
THE dusky night rides down the sky,
And ushers in the morn,
The hounds all make a jovial cry,
The huntsman winds his horn.
Then a hunting let us go.
Then, etc.
The wife around her husband throws,
Her arms to make him stay,
My dear, it hails, it rains, it blows,
You cannot hunt today.
But a hunting, etc.
The uncavern'd fox like lightning flies,
His cunning's all awake,
To gain the race he eager tries,
His forfeit life the stake.
When a hunting, etc.
Arous'd even Echo huntress turns,
And madly shouts her joy,
The sportsman's breast in rapture burns,
The chase can never cloy.
Then a hunting, etc.
Despairing mark he seeks the tide,
His art must now prevail,
Hark! shouts the miscreants death betide,
His speed, his cunning fail.
When a hunting, etc.
For lo! his strength to faintness worn,
The hounds arrest his slight,
Then hungry homewards we return,
To feast away the night.
Then a drinking, etc.
CONTENT.
NO woman her envy can smother,
Tho never so vain of her charms;
If beauty she spies in another,
The pride of her heart it alarms.
New conquests she still may be making,
Or fancies her power grows less;
Her poor little heart is still aching
At sight of another's success.
But nature designed, in love to mankind,
That different beauties should move,
Still pleased to ordain, none ever should reign
Sole monarch in empire of love.
Then lea^^ to be wise, new triumphs despise,
And leave to your neighbors their due;
If one cannot please, you will find by degrees,
You Will not be contented with two;
No, no, you will not be contented with two.
FAIR SUSAN.
ASK if you damask rose is sweet,
That scents the ambient air;
Then ask each shepherd that you meet,
If dear Susanna's fair.
Say, will the vulture quit his prey,
And warble through the grove?
Bid wanton linnets quit the spray,
Then doubt thy shepherd's love.
The spoils of war let heroes share,
Let pride in splendour shine;
Ye bards unenvied laurels wear,
Be fair Susanna mine.
OF WOMAN TO TELL YOU MY MIND.
OF woman to tell you my mind,
And I speak from the experience I Have had,
Not two out of fifty you will find,
Be they daughters or wives,
But are plagues of our lives,
And enough to make any man mad.
The wrong and the right,
Being set in their fight,
They Are sure to take hold of the wrong;
They Will cajole and they will wimper,
They Will whine and they will snivel,
They Will coax and they will simper --
In short, they are the devil;
And so there is an end of my song.
LET HEROES DELIGHT.
LET heroes delight in the toils of the war,
In maims, blood, and bruises, and blows,
Not a sword, but a sword not rejoices the fair!
And what are rough soldiers to beaux?
Away then with laurels! come beauty and lov
And silence the trumpet and drum;
Let me with soft mytle my brows bare involve.
And tenderly combat at home.
PRETTY PEGGY.
BELIEVE my sighs, my tears, my dear,
Believe the heart you have won:
Believe the vows to you sincere,
Or Peggy I Am undone.
You say I Am false and apt to change
At every face that is new:
Of all the girls I ever I saw,
I never loved one but you.
My heart was like a flake of ice,
Till warmed by your bright eyes,
And then it kindled in a trice,
A flame that never dies.
Then take and try me, you shall find
That I Have a heart that is true:
Of all the girls I ever saw,
I never loved one but you.
LOVELY MOLLY.
CAN love be controlled by advice?
Can madness and reason agree?
O Molly! who'd ever be wise,
If madness is loving of thee?
Let sages pretend to despise
The joys they want spirits to taste;
Let me seize on old time as he flies,
And the blessings of life while they last.
Dull wisdom but adds to our cares;
Brisk love will improve every joy;
Too soon we may meet with gr^y hairs,
Too late may repeat being coy:
Then, Molly, for what should we stay
Till our best blood begins to run cold?
Our youth we can have but today,
We may always find time to grow old.
CHLOE.
DEAR Chloe, come give me sweet kisses,
For sweeter no girl ever gave;
But why, in the midst of my blisses,
Do ask me how many I Would have?
I Am not to be stinted in pleasure;
Then, prythe, dear Chloe be kind;
For since I love thee out of measure,
To numbers I Will never be consigned.
Count the bees that on Hybla are playing;
Count the flowers that enamel the fields;
Count the flocks that in Tempe are straying,
And the grain that in rich Sicily yields;
Count how many stars are in Heaven;
Go number the sands on the shore;
And when so many kisses you have given,
I still shall be asking for more.
To a heart full of love let me hold thee,
A heart which, dear Chloe, is thine;
In my arms let me ever infold thee,
And circle thee round like a vine.
What joy can be greater than this is?
My lise on your lips shall be spent:
The wretch that can number his kisses,
Will always with few be content.
HANG ME IF I MARRY.
DECLARE, my pretty maid,
DECLARE, my pretty maid,
Must my fond suit miscarry?
With you I Will toy, I Will kiss and play.
But hang if I marry.
With you, etc.

Then speak your mind at once,
Nor let me longer tarry;
With you I Will toy, I Will kiss and play;
But hang me if I marry:
With you etc.

Though charm^ and wit assail,
The ^troke I well can parry:
I love to kiss, to toy and play,
But do not choose to marry:
I love, etc.

Young Molly of the dale
Makes a mere slave of Harry;
Because, when they had toy'd and kissed;
The foolish swain would marry.
Because, etc.

These fixed resolves, my dear,
I to the grave will carry;
With you I Will toy, and kiss and play;
But hang me if I marry.
With you I Will toy, etc.

PLACINDA's BEAUTY.
WHEN Placinda's beauties appear,
How enchanting then is her air!
Such a sine shape and size,
Such lips teeth and eyes!
So many darts who can bear!
Then her temper so good and so sweet,
Such her carriage and elegant wit;
Whatever she does or says,
We all in transport gaze.
Like young squires in the opera pit.
But to cut off all hopes of retreat,
There Is Eliza to captivate;
The mighty Hercules
With two such foes as these
Must have looked for a total defe^^.
FAIR KITTY.
FAIR Kitty, beautiful and young,
And wild as colt untamed,
Bespoke the fair from whence she sprung,
With little rage inflamed;
Infirm'd with rage and sad restrain;
Which wise mama ordained,
And sorely vexed to play the saint,
While wit and beauty reigned,
While wit and beauty reigned
And sorely vexed to play the saint,
While wit and beauty reigned.
Must lady Jenny frisk about,
And visst with her cousins?
At balls she must make all the rout,
And bring home hearts by dozens.
What has she better, pray, than I,
What hidden charms to boast,
That all mankind for her should die,
While I am scarce a toast?
While I am scarce a toast?
That all mankind for her should die,
While I am scarce a toast.
Dear, dear mama for once let me,
Unchain'd my fortune try;
I Will have my earl as well as she,
Or know the reason why.
Fond love prevailed, mama gave way;
Kitty has heart's desire,
Obtained the chariot for a day,
And set the world on fire,
Obtained the chariot for a day,
And set the world on fire.
FROM COLLEGE I CAME.
FROM college I came.
Full of spirits and flame,
Determined I never would despair;
I Will search the town through,
For the lass I Have in view,
She must have a delicate air.
I Will search the town through,
For the lass I Have in view,
She must have a delicate air.
There Is you, miss, and you,
Ay, and you, madam, too,
Who look so confoundedly sly;
You think I Will declare,
Now the name of the fair,
If I can, I wish I may die.
I Have searched the town round,
She is not to be found,
I find myself quite in despair,
There Is this thin^g and that,
Sets my heart pit a pat,
Whenever I speak to the fair.
Resolved then I am,
And blame me if I can,
If one of your hearts to ensnare,
In wedlock's soft chains,
I Will forget all my pains,
Live constant and blessed with my fair.
DEARLY DO I LOVE THEE.
AH! dear Margella! maid divine,
No more will I at fate repine,
If I this day behold thee mine,
For dearly do I love thee.
Thy ease shall be my sweet employ,
My constant care, my every joy;
May then no chance my hope destroy,
For dearly do I love thee.
Sweet is the woodbine to the be:
The rising sun to every tree,
But sweeter far art thou to me,
For dearly do I love thee.
And let me but behold thee mine,
No more will I at fate repine,
But while I live, thou maid divine,
With rapture do I love thee.
FIE FOR SHAME.
AS through the grove I chanced to stray,
I met young Philis on her way;
I flew like lightning to her arms,
And gazed in rapture on her charms;
Her looks revealed a modest flame,
Yet still she cried -- O fie for shame,
With eager haste I stole a kiss,
Which blushing Philis took amiss;
She pushed me from her with a frown,
And called me bold presuming clown;
While I confessed myself to blame,
But still she cried -- O fie shame.
In tender sighs I told my love,
And pledged my faith on things above;
But she, like all her sex, was coy,
And though I swore, would not comply;
Yet I perceived she met my flame,
But still she cried -- O fie for shame,
When this I saw, I quickly cried,
Will lovely Philis be my bride?
For hark! I hear the tinkling bell;
To church let us go -- it pleased her well;
And soon a kind compliance came,
But still she cried -- O fie for shame.
Now Hymen's bands have made us one,
The joys we taste to few are known;
No jealous fears our bosoms move;
For constant each, we truly love;
She now declares I Am not to blame,
No longer cries -- O fie for shame.
CELINDA.
BY a cool fountain's flowery side
The bright Celinda lay;
Her looks increased the Summer's pride;
Her eyes the bloom of day.
The roses blushed with deeper red,
To see their charms outdone;
The lillies sunk beneath their bed,
To see such rivals shown.
Quick through the air, to his retreat,
A be industrious flew;
Prepared to rifle every sweet,
And sip the balmy dew.
Drawn by the fragrance of her breath,
Her rosy lips he found;
Where he in transports met his death,
And dropped upon the ground.
Enjoy, blessed be, enjoy thy fate,
Nor at thy fall repine;
Each god would quit his blissful state,
To share a joy like thine.
MY LABOR WAS VAIN.
IN pursuit of some lambs from my flocks that had strayed,
One morning I ranged over the plain;
But alas! after all my researches were made,
I perceived that my labor was vain.
At length growing hopeless my lambs to restore,
I resolved to return back again,
It was useless I thought to look after them more,
Since I found that my labor was vain.
On this my return, pretty Phoebe I saw,
And to love her I could not refrain;
To solicit a kiss I approached her with awe,
But she told me my labor was vain.
But, Phoebe, I cried, to my suit lend an ear,
And let me no longer complain;
She replied with a frown, and an aspect severe,
Young Collin, your labor's in vain.
Then I eagerly clasped her quite close to my breast
And kissed her, and kissed her again;
O Collin! she cried, if you're rude, I protest
That your labor shall still be in vain.
At length by entreaties, by kisses and vows,
Compassion she took on my pain;
She now has consented to make me her spouse,
So no longer I labor in vain.
WOMEN ARE NEVER WRONG.
THOUGH women, it is true, are but tender,
Yet nature does her strength supply;
Their will is too strong to surrender;
They Are obstinate still till they die.
In vain you attack them with reason,
Your sorrows you only prolong;
Disputing is always high treason;
No woman was ever in the wrong.
Relief must be in resignation,
For if you appear once content.
Perhaps the dear fair in compassion,
May then condescend to relent.
THE SAILOR's ADIEU.
THE topsails shiver in the wind,
Our ship she casts to sea,
But yet my soul, my heart, my mind,
Are, Mary, moored with thee;
For though thy sailors bound afar,
Still love shall be my leading star.
Should landsmen latter when we are sailed,
O doubt their artful tales,
No gallant sailor ever sailed,
If love breathed constant gales;
Thou art the compass of my soul,
Which steers my heart from pole to pole.
These are our cares; but if you're kind
We'll scorn the dashing main,
The rocks, the billows, and the wind,
Till we return again.
COLUMBIA's glory rests with you.
Our sails are full, sweet girls adieu.
THE BLIND EAT MANY A FLY.
FROM sweet bewitching tricks of love,
Young men your hearts secure,
Lest from the paths of sense you rove,
In dotage premature,
In dotage premature.
Look at each lass through wisdom glass,
Nor trust the naked eye,
Gallants beware, look sharp, take care,
The blind eat many a fly,
The blind eat many a fly.
Not only on their hands and necks
The borrowed white you will find;
Some belles, whom interest direct,
Can even paint the mind, etc.
Joy in distress they can express,
Their very tears can lie:
Gallants beware, etc.

There Is not a spinster in the realm
But all mankind can cheat,
Down to the cottage from the helm,
The learned, the brave, the great, etc.
With lovely looks, and golden hooks,
T'entangle us they try:
Gallants beware, etc.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
Was earth of parchment made,
Was every single stick a quill;
Each man a scribe by trade, etc.
To write the tricks of half the sex
Would drain that ocean siry:
Gallants beware, etc.

CELIA.
WHEN first I sought fair Celia's love,
And every charm was new,
I swore by all the gods above
To be forever true.
But long in vain did I adore,
Long wept and figh'd in vain;
She still protested, vowed and swore
She never would ease my pain.
At last o'ercame, she made me blessed,
And yielded all her charms;
And I forsook her when possessed,
And fled to others arms.
But let not this, dear Celia, now
Thy breast to rage incline:
For why, since you forgot your vow,
Should I remember mine?
WHEN LADIES ARE WILLING.
DEAR madam, when ladies are willing,
A man must needs look like a fool;
For me I would not give one shilling
For one that can love out of rule:
At least you should wait for our offers
Nor snatch like old maids in despair;
If you have lived till these years without proffers,
Your sighs are now lost in the air.
You should leave us to guess at your blushing,
And not speak the matter too plain,
It Is ours to be forward and pushing,
And yours to effect a disdain.
That you're in a terrible taking,
By all your fond ogling I see;
But the fruit that will fall without shaking,
Indeed, is too mellow for me.
THE CHARMER.
YOU may say what you will, but Belinda's too tall,
And Stella's all bone, and her shape is too small;
Dear Chloe's my wish, though extensive her charms,
Though the front of her slays is too wide for my arms
It Is certain Miss Fanny's a sweet little dear,
And zephyrs bring odors when Lucy is near;
But Chloe's all sweetness by nature designed,
We might call her a hogshead of double-refin'd.
When she dances then leaps my fond heart like a frog;
When with rapture I press her, I Am lost in a fog;
I beg for a kiss, while my vows I renew,
And imbibe half a pint of ambrosial dew.
She frequently mention's young Strephon, the beau,
But why should I reckon my rival a foe?
Even let him proceed it will never give me pain;
We both shall find more than our arms will contain.
I Have often overheard the ill-natured expression;
That beauty so bulky must pall in possession;
In his notion the critic is surely misled,
Love's flame by her fat will be constantly fed.
Some nymphs have angelical sweetness and grace,
But Chloe has rather a cherubim's face;
She Is always good humor'd, facetious and free,
And only gives pain when she fits on my knee.
I start not, as timirous fribbles have done,
At the substance of three or four females in one;
First balance her weight with the mint's costly coin,
Then let the dear ponderous charmer be mine.
I AM IN LOVE WITH TWENTY.
I AM in love with twenty,
I Am in love with twenty,
And could adore,
As many more,
For nothing's like a plenty.
Variety is charming,
Variety is charming,
For constancy
Is not for me,
So ladies you have warning.
He that has but one love,
Looks as poor
As any boor,
Or like a man with one glove.
Variety, etc.

Not the fine regallia
Of eastern kings,
The poet sings,
But oh! the fine seraglio.
Variety, etc.

Girls grow old and ugly,
And cannot inspire
The same desire,
As when they are young and smugly.
Variety, etc.

Why has Cupid pinions,
If not to fly
Through all the sky,
And see his favorite minions.
Variety, etc.

Love was born of beauty,
And when she goes,
The urchin knows,
To follow is his duty.
Variety, etc.

BUY MY MATCHES.
BUY my matches, ye maids, I have matches for all,
I Have a match for the little, the lusty and tall,
All my matches are pointed, my brimstone is good,
And I know very well how to splinter my wood
Buy my matches.

There Is the parson who matches the young and the old,
Gives you brimstone enough when you're matched to a scold,
If your matches are made, as I fear they be,
You Have met with your match before you met me.
Buy my matches.

There Is the doctor so nice, and the lawyer so wise,
Are a match for you all, for none match them in lies;
Beware of them both be they ever so civil,
For a lawyer is only a match for the devil.
Buy my matches.

And now ye young men and ye pretty maids too
When your matches you make beware you don't rae;
Let your matches be pointed with honor and truth,
And in age they will retain what was kindled in youth
Buy my matches.

And now to sum up all the matches I Have named,
May this land be for commerce and liberty famed,
May her foes round the globe on her thunder be hurled,
And America ever prove a match for the world.
Buy my matches.

THE LAMPLIGHTER.
I AM jolly Dick the Lamplighter,
They say the Sun's my dad,
And truly I believe it so,
For I Am a pretty lad;
Father and I the world do light,
And make it look so gay,
The difference is, I light by night,
My father lights by day.
But father's not the like of I,
For knowing life and fun,
For I strange tricks and fancy spy,
Folks never show the sun;
Rogues, owls and bats, cant bear the light,
I Have heard your wise ones say,
And so, do you mind, I sees by night,
Things never seen by day.
At night men lay aside all art,
As quite a useless task,
And many a face, and many a heart,
Will then pull off the mask:
Each formal prude, and holy wigut,
Will throw disguise away,
And sin it openly at night
Who saint it all the day.
His darling hoard the miser views,
Misses from friends decamp,
And many a statesman mischief brews
To his country, over his lamp;
So father and I, do you take me right,
Are just on the same lay,
I barefaced sinner's light by night,
And he false saints by day.
SOLDIER DICK.
WHY don't you know me by my scars?
I Am soldier Dick come from the wars,
Where many a pate without a hat,
Crowd honor's bed, but what of that.
CHORUS.
Beat drums, play fifes, it is glory calls,
What argusies who stands or falls,
Lord what should one be sorry for,
Life's but the fortune of the ^ar,
Then rich or poor, or well o^ ^ick,
Still laugh and sing shall soldier Dick,
I used to look two ways at one,
A bullet hit me on the sconce,
And dows'd my eye, do you think I'^ wince,
Why, Lord, I Have never squinted since.
Some distant keep from war's alarms,
For fear of wooden legs and arms,
While others die safe in their beds,
Who all their lives wore wooden heads.
Thus gout or fever, sword or shot,
Or something sends us all to pot,
That were to die then do not grieve,
But lets be merry while we live.
THE RUSH LIGHT.
SIR Solomon Simons when he did wed
Blushed black as a crow, his fair lady did blush light,
The clock struck twelve, they were both tucked in bed,
In the chimney a rush light.
A little farthing rush light,
Fall lal lal lal la,
A little farthing rush light.
Sir Solomon gave his lady a nudge,
Cries he, lady Simons there is vastly too much light,
Then Sir Solomon, says she, to get up you cant grudge,
And blow out the rush light.
A little farthing, etc.
Sir Solomon then out of bed he pops his toes,
And vastly he swore, and very much did curse light,
And then to the chimney Sir Solomon he goes,
And he puffed at the rush light.
The little farthing, etc.
Lady Simons got up in her night cap so neat,
And over the carpet my lady did brush light,
And there Sir Solomon she found in a heat,
Puffed at the rush light.
Then she puffed at the rush light,
But neither of them both
Could blow out the rush light.
Sir Solomon and lady their breath quite gone,
Rang the bell in a rage, determined to crush light;
Half asleep in his shirt then up came John,
And he puffed at the rush light.
The little farthing rush light,
But neither of the three
Could blow out the rush light,
Cook, coachman, and maid, very near all in baff,
Came and swore in their lives they never met with such light,
And each of the family by turns had a puff
At the little farthing rush light,
The cursed farthing rush light,
But none of the family
Could blow out the rush light,
The watchman at last went by, crying one,
Here watchman, come up, then you we might on worse light;
Then up came the watchman, the business was done,
For he turned down the rush light,
The damned farthing rush light,
Past one o'clock!
So he put out the rush light.
PRETTY POLL.
COME, pretty Poll^ from tears refrain,
And, dearest maid, believe
It wrings my heart with cruel pain,
To see my charmer grieve;
Then dry those eyes, and ever I go,
Each anxious fear dispel
And bold I Will meet my country's foe
For you, my lovely girl.
For bold I Will meet, etc.
A sailor scorns the name of slave,
And when he is called to war,
Will teach the foe what it is to brave
A dauntless worthy tar;
Then bid, my life, those sighs adieu,
Those lucid tears farewell,
I fly to conquer, love, for you,
For you, my lovely girl.
The signal's sir'd, I Am called away,
It Is willed that we must part;
But though forbid with thee to stay,
I bear thee in my heart;
Then let not Polly be concerned,
For Hymen soon shall tell,
The sailor's safe from war returned,
For you, my lovely girl.
BONNY BET OF ABERDEEN,
JUST at the close of summers day,
How sweet the blooming blossoms seem,
So sweet the time I pass away,
Wi bonny Bet of Aberdeen.
CHORUS.
Whenever I sit beneath the shade,
Or wander over the lee,
To meet the charming village maid,
That kindly smiles on me.
She Is fresh and fair as the violet rose,
The blithest lass that sports the green.
I Will follow her wher'er she goes,
O bonny Bet of Aberdeen.
She vows she loves but me alone,
And I believe her sparkling even,
I long for to unite in one,
Wi bonny Bet of Abrdeen.
Our Wedding day we'll crown wi joy.
While the nymphs and swains dance on the green,
And I shall be a happy boy,
When blessed wi Bet of Aberdeen.
THE DRUMMER.
DAPPER-tit-tat-too is my natty name,
For roll or a trevally,
Among the girls loud sounds my fame,
When I their quarters rally,
For with sife and drum,
I smirking come,
Leer, cock my hat
Swear and all that,
Nor ever dread,
A broken head,
Where the cause of strife's a doxy,
But as for wars,
And wounds and scars,
And sighting foes,
And thumps and blows,
I Would rather fight by proxy.
When chiefs and privates mingled lie,
And gasp without assistance,
In baggage wagons perched on high,
Stand umpire at a distance,
And with fife and drum,
A smirking come,
Mong'st soldiers wives,
Who led merry lives,
Now ever dread,
A broken head,
Where the cause of strife's a doxy,
Let their husbands go,
And against the foe,
Gain glory's scars,
In honor's cause,
I Would rather fight by proxy.
Yet think I am not renowned
In foreign wars and civil,
Why, Sir, when safe and sound,
Rounds I could fight the devil,
And with fife and drum;
Can smirking come,
And cock my hat,
Leer and all that,
And ever dread,
A broken head,
When the cause of strife's a doxy,
Let others go,
And 'gain'st the foe,
Gain glory's scars,
In honor's wars,
I Would rather fight by proxy.
Thus through the world I make a nois,
Wherever I am a sojourner,
The mighty wonders and surprise,
Of every chimney corner,
Where with fife and drum,
I smirking come,
And rap out sounds
And talk of wounds,
Nor ever dread,
A broken head,
Where the cause of strife's a doxy,
They Are fools who go,
And against the foe,
In glory's wars,
Gain honor's scars,
I Am wise and fight by proxy
HAIL COLUMBIA!
HAIL COLUMBIA! happy land!
Hail ye HEROES! Heaven born band,
Who fought and bled in Freedom's cause,
Who fought and bled in Freedom's cause,
And when the storm of war was gone,
Enjoyed the peace, your valor won.
Let INDEPENDENCE be our boast,
Ever mindful what it cost;
Ever grateful for the prize,
Let its altar reach the skies.
CHORUS.
Firm -- united -- let us be,
Rallying round our LIBERTY;
As a band of brothers joined,
Peace and safety we shall find.
IMMORTAL PATRIOTS! rise once more,
Defend your rights, defend your shore,
Let no rude foe with impious hand,
Let no rude foe with impious hand,
Invade the shrine where sacred lies,
Of toil and blood the well-earn'd prize.
While offering peace, sincere and just,
In Heaven we place a manly trust,
That truth and justice will prevail,
And every scheme of bondage fail.
Firm -- united, etc.

Sound, sound the trump of Fame,
Let WASHINGTON's great name
Ring through the world with loud applause,
Ring through the world with loud applause,
Let every clime to Freedom dear,
Listen with a joyful ear --
With equal skill, with god-like power,
He governs in the fearful hour
Of horrid war, or guides with ease
The happier times of honest peace.
Firm -- united, etc.

Behold the CHIEF who now commands,
Once more to save his country, stands
The rock on which the storm will beat,
The rock on which the storm will beat,
But armed in Virtue, firm and true,
His hopes are fixed on Heaven and You.
When Hope was sinking in dismay,
When glooms obscured Columbia's day,
His steady mind, from changes free,
Resolved on DEATH or LIBERTY.
Firm -- united, etc.

MOGGY
YOUNG Mog arrived at woman's growth,
Felt something in her bosom move,
'Twas neither joy nor pain, yet both,
Young Ralph o'th woodland said 'twas love.
Ralph loved young Moggy as his life,
Was wealthy, warm, and well to do,
But Moggy saw the soldiers come,
Beheld the glittering arms so gay,
Was charmed with the loud trumpets bray,
Delighted with the sprightly fife,
And deafen'd with the thundering drum,
While the soldiers marched to the loud tattoo,
And though to honest Ralph still true,
She listened to the loud tattoo.
I Have said that Mog was dehonair,
Nor was her admiration small,
She was thought artless, young and fair,
By the regiment pioneers and all.
Each would have taken her for his wife,
Ala militaire as sodiers do;
The smock faced ensign named his sum,
The sergeant promised, swore, and prayed,
The trumpeter her praises brayed;
To charm her loudly squeak'd the fife,
The drummer braced his thundering drum,
To win her heart with a loud tattoo,
Thus strove to make young Mog untrue,
Pike, trumpet, fife, and loud tattoo.
Mog soon found reason to condemn
The nonsense of each blustering elf;
And looking with contempt on them,
Some little shame took on herself.
Determined now to be the wife
Of honest Ralph so kind and true,
Cried she to the ensign, child go home
To your mama -- for you, old bluff,
Your trumpet's like youself, a puff!
I Will not be whistled after fife,
Nor drummer, shall your hollow drum
To me beat wedlock's loud tattoo,
True to my Ralph, to honor true,
Hence trumpet, fife, and loud tattoo.
THE LASS OF RICHMOND HILL.
ON Richmond hill there lives a lass,
More bright than May day morn,
Whose charms all other maids surpass,
A rose without a thorn.
CHORUS.
This lass so neat, with smiles so sweet,
Has won my right good will,
I Would crowns resign to call the mine,
Sweet lass of Richmond hill.
Ye zephyrs gay that fan the air,
And wonton through the grove,
O whisper to my charming fair,
I die for her and love.
This lass so neat, etc.

How happy will the shepherd be,
Who calls this nymph his own;
O may her choice be fixed on me,
Mine Is fixed on her alone.
This lass so neat, etc.

I AM IN HASTE.
AS cross the field the other morn,
I tript so blithe and gay,
The 'Squire with his dog and gun,
By chance came by that way;
Wither so fast, sweet maid, he cried,
And caught me round the waist,
Pray stop awhile, dear sir, said I,
I cannot for I Am in haste.
You must not go as yet, cried he,
For I have much to say,
Come sit you down, and let us chat
Upon this new mown hay;
I Have loved you long, and often have wished
Those ruby lips to taste,
I Will have a kiss, well then, said I,
Be quick, for I Am in haste.
Just as I spoke, I saw young Hodge,
Come through a neigboring gate
He caught my hand, and cried, dear girl
I fear I Have made you wait,
But here is a ring, come let us to church,
The joys of love to taste,
I left 'Squire, and laughing cried.
You see, Sir, I Am in haste.
The four following Songs are sung in the "SURRENDER OF CALAIS."

MADELON -- A DUET.
SHE.
CAN you to the battle march away,
And leave me here complaining?
I am sure 'twill break my heart to stay
When you are gone campaigning.
Ah! no, ah! no, poor Madelon
Will never quit her rover,
Ah! no, ah! no, poor Madelon
Will go with you all the world over.
HE.
Cheer, cheer my love, you shall not grieve,
A soldier true you will find me,
I could have the heart to leave
My little girl behind me.
Ah! no, ah! no, etc.

SHE.
Can you to the battle go,
To woman's fear a stranger!
No fears my breast shall ever know,
But when my love's in danger.
Ah! no, ah! no, etc.

BOTH.
Then let the world jog as it will,
Let all our friends forsake us,
We both shall be as happy still
As love and war can make us.
Ah! no, ah! no, etc.

LERA LA.
LITTLE does the townswife know,
While at home she tarries,
What must be a lass's life,
Who a soldier marries;
Now with weary marching spent,
Dancing now before the tent,
Lera, lera, la.
In the camp all night she lies,
Wind and weather scorning,
Only grieves her love must rise,
And quit her ere the morning;
But the doubtful skirmish done,
Pleased she sing at fitring sun,
Lera, lera, la.
Should the captain of her dear
Use his vain endeavor,
Whispering nonsense in her ear,
Two fond hearts to sever;
At his passion she will scoff,
Laughing thus she puts him off,
Lera, lera, la.
CORPORAL CASEY.
WHEN I was at home I was merry and frisky,
My dad kept a pig, and my mother sold whiskey;
My uncle was rich, but would never be easy,
Till I was enlisted by Corporal Casey:
Och, rub-a-dub, row-de-dow, Corporal Casey,
My dear little Shelah I though it would run crazy,
When I trudged away with tough Corporal Casey.
I marched from Kilkenny, and as I was thinking
On Shelah, my heart in my bosom was sinking;
But soon I was fore'd to look fresh as a daisey,
For fear of a drubbing from Corporal Casey:
Och, rub-a-dub, row-de-dow, Corporal Casey,
The devil go with him, I never could be lazy,
He stuck in my skirts so, old Corporal Casey.
We went into battle, I took the blows fairly
That fell on my pate, but they bother'd me rarely;
And who should the first be that dropped? -- why an't please ye,
It was my good friend, honest Corporal Casey.
Thinks I, you are quiet, and I shall be easy.
For there you lie high and dry, Corporal Casey
WAR HAS STILL IT IS MELODY.
WAR has still it is melody; --
When blows come thick, and arrows fly,
When the soldier marches over
The crimsoned field knee-deep in gore;
By carnage and grim death surrounded,
And the groans of dying men confounded;
If the warlike drum he hears,
And the shrill trumpet strikes his ears,
Roused by the spirit-stirring tones,
Music's influence he owns:
His lusty heart beats quick and high --
War has still its melody.
But when-the hard-fought day is done,
And the battle's fairly won;
Oh! then he trolls the jolly note
In triumph through his rusty throat;
And all the story of the s^eife.
He carois to the merry fife.
His comrades join their teats to tell.
The chorus then begins to swell,
Loud ^^^tiall music rends the sky --
This is the soldier's melody.
HEAVING THE LEAD.
FOR our country when with favoring gale
Our gallant ship up channel steered,
And scudding under easy sail,
The high blue western land appeared,
To heave the lead the seaman sprung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
"By the deep -- Nine!"
And bearing up to gain the port,
Some well-known object kept in view,
An abbey-tow'r, an harbor-fort,
Or beacon, to the vessel true;
While often the lead the seaman flung,
And to the pilot cheerly sung,
"By the mark -- Seven!"
And as the much-loved shore we are near;
With transport we behold the roof,
Where dwelt a friend or partner dear,
Of faith and love a matchless proof.
The lead once more the seaman flung,
And to the watchful pilot sung,
"Quarter less -- Five!"
JACK IN HIS ELEMENT.
BOLD Jack, the sailor, here I come,
Pray how do you like my nib,
My trowsers wide, trampler on,
My nab and flowing jib:
I sail the seas from end to end,
And lead a joyous life,
At every mess we find a friend,
At every port a wife.
I Have heard them talk of constancy,
Of grief, and such like fun,
I Have constant been to ten, cried I.
But never grieved for one.
The flowing sails we tars unbend,
To lead a roving life,
At every mess we find a friend,
At every port a wife.
I Have a spanking wife at Portsmouth gates,
A pigmy at Goree,
An orange-tawny up the Straits,
A black at St: Lucie.
Thus whatsoever course we bend,
We lead a jovial life,
At every mess we find a friend,
At every port a wife.
Will Gaff by death was taken a-back,
I came to bring the news,
Poil whimper'd sore, but what object,
I stood in William's shoes.
She got high chest, and at the end
She loves me as her life,
And she has now an honest friend,
And I a loving wife.
Come all you sailors that do go,
The dangerous seas to rub,
You must work, love and fight your foes,
And drink your generous bub,
Storms that our masts in splinters tear,
Can take our joyous life,
In every want we find a friend,
And every port a wise.
WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE!
O DEAR! what can the matter be!
Dear! dear! what can the matter be!
Johnny's so long at the fair;
He promised to buy me a pair of blue stockings,
A pair of new garters which cost but two pence,
He promised he would bring me a bunch of blue ribbons
To tie up my bonny brown hair.
O dear! what can the matter be!
Dear! dear! what can the matter be!
O dear! what can the matter be!
Johnny's so long at the fair!
He promised to bring me a basket of posies,
A garland of lillies, a garland of roses,
A little straw hat set off whith blue ribbons,
To tie up my bonny brown hair.
O dear! see how he is running,
Dear! dear! see he is coming,
O dear! see how he is running,
Johnny's returned from the fair:
He has brought me a delicate basket of posies,
A garland of lillies, a garland of roses,
A little straw hat to set off with blue ribbons,
To tie up my bonny brown hair.
THE HIGH METTLED RACER.
SEE the course thronged with gazers, the sports, are begun,
What confusion! but hear! -- I Will bet you, sir -- done done;
A thousand strange rumors resound far and near,
Lords, hawkers, and jockies assail the tired ear;
Whilst with neck like a rainbow erecting his crest,
Pampered, prancing, his head almost touching his breast,
Scarcely snuff^ing the air, he is so proud and elate,
The high mettled racer first starts for the plate.
Now Reynard's turned out, and over hedge and ditch rush,
Men, horses, and dogs, who are hard at his brush;
Over heath, hill and mound, and led by their sly prey,
By scent and by view, cheat the long tedious way:
When alike born for joys of the field and the course,
Always sure to come through a flaunch and fleet horse;
And when fairly run down the fox yields up his breath,
The high mettled racer is in at the death.
Grown aged, used up, and turned out of the stud,
Lame, spavin'd, and wind-gall'd, but yet with some blood;
Whilst knowing postilions his pedigree trace,
Tell how his dam won the sweepstakes, his fire the race;
And what matches he is gained to the hostlers count over,
As they loiter their time at some hedge-ale-house door,
Whilst the harness sore galls, and the spurs his sides goad,
The high mettled racer's a ha^^ on the road.
At length old and feeble, d^^^ging early and late,
Bowed down by degrees, h^^ bends on to his fate;
From morning till evening ^^e tugs in a mill,
Or draws sand till the sands of hour glass stand still:
And when lifeless and cold he is exposed to the view,
In that very same cart which he yesterday drew,
Whilst a pitying crowd his sad relic^ surrounds,
The high mettled racer is sold for the hounds.
The two following Songs are sung in the "HIGHLAND REEL."

THOUGH I AM A VERY LITTLE LAD.
THOUGH I Am a very little lad,
If fighting men cannot be had,
For want of better I may do,
To follow the boy with a rat-tat-too;
I may seem tender, yet I Am tough,
And though not much of me, right good stuff,
Of this I Will boast, say more who can,
I never was afraid to meet my man.
I Am a chickabiddy see, take me now now now,
I Am a little merry he, for your row dow dow,
Brown Bess I Will knock about, oh there is my joy,
At my back a knapsack like a roving boy.
In my tartan played a young soldier view,
My phillibeg and dirk, and my bonnet blue,
Give the word, and I Will march at your command,
Noble Sergeant with a shilling strike my hand.
My Captain, as he takes his glass,
May wish to toy with a pretty lass,
For such a one I have a roguish eye,
He Will never want a lass when I am by.
I Am a chickabiddy, etc.

Though a barber never yet has mowed my chin,
With my great broad sword I long to begin,
Cut, slash, ram, dam -- oh! glorious fun,
For a gun, pip, pop, change my little pop gun.
My foes shall fly like geese in slocks,
F^en Turks I Will drive like turky-cocks,
And wherever quartered I shall be,
Oh, zounds! how I Will kiss my landlady.
I Am a chickabiddy, etc.

WHEN I HAVE MONEY I AM MERRY.
WHEN I Have money I am merry,
When I Have none I Am very sad;
When I Am sober I am civil,
When I Am drunk I Am roaring mad.
With my titol teedle tum,
Likewise fol lol feedle fum,
Fot forgetting diderum hi,
And also teedle tweedle dum.
When disputing with a puppy,
I convince him with a rap;
When I Am romping with a girl,
By accident I tear her cap.
Gadzooks I Will never marry,
I Am a lad that is bold and free,
Yet I love a pretty girl,
A pretty girl is fond of me.
With my, etc.

There Is a maiden in a corner,
Round and sound, and plump and fat,
She and I made love together,
But no matter, sir, for that.
If this maiden be wi' bairn,
As I do suppose she will be,
Like good pappy I must learn
To dandle Jacky on my knee.
With my, etc.

THE DESPONDING NEGRO.
ON Afric's wide plains where lions now roaring,
With freedom stalk forth, the vast desert exploring,
I was dragged from my hut, and enchain'd as a slave,
In a dark floating dungeon upon the salt wave.
Spare a fialfpeuny, spare a halfpenny!
Oh! spare a halfpenny to a poor Negro.
Tossed on the wild main, I all wildly despairing,
Burst my chains, rushed on deck with my eye balls quite glaring,
When the lightning's dread blast struck the inlets of day,
And its glorious bright beams shut forever away,
Spare a halfpenny, etc.

The despoiler of man then his project thus losing
Of gain, by my sale, none a blind bargain choosing,
As my value compared with my keeping was light,
^ad me dashed overboard in the dead of the dight.
Spare a halfpenny, etc.

And but for a bark to Columbia's coast bound then,
All my cares by that plung^ in the deep had been drowned then,
But by moonlight descried, I was snatched from the wave,
And reluctantly robbed of a watery grave.
Spare a halfpenny, etc.

How disastrous my fate! Freedom's ground though I trend now,
Torn from home, wife, and children, and wandering for bread now,
While seas roll between us, which never can be crossed,
And hope's distant glimmerings in darkness are lost.
Spare a halfpenny, etc.

But of mind foul and fair, when the judge and ponderer
Shall restore light and rest to the, blind and wanderer,
The European's deep dye may outrival the sloe,
And the soul of an Ethiop prove white as snow.
Spare a halfpenny, etc.

THE SAILOR'S CONSOLATION.
SPANRING Jack was so comely, so pleasant, so jolly,
Though winds blew great guns he would whistle and sing;
Jack loved his friend, and was true to his Molly,
And if honor bro't titles was as great as a king;
One night as we drove with two reefs in our mainsail,
And the soud came on louring upon a lee shore,
Jack went up aloft for to hand the top-gallant fail,
A spray washed him off, and we never saw him more.
CHORUS.
But grieving's a folly, come let us be jolly,
If we have troubles at sea, boys, we have pleasures on shore.
Whistling Tom, still of mischief and fun in the middle,
Through life in all weathers at random we jog,
He Would dance and he would sing, and he would play on the fiddle,
And swig with an air his allowance of grog;
Long side of a Don, in the Terrible frigate,
As yard arm and yard arm we lay off the shore,
In and out whistling Tom did so caper and jig it,
That his head was shot off and we never saw him more.
Bonny Ben was to each jolly messmate a brother,
He was manly and honest, good natured and free;
If ever one tar was more free than another,
To his friend and his duty that sailor was he,
One day with the david to heave the cadge anchor,
Ben went in a boat on a bold craggy shore,
He overboard tipped, when a shark and a spanker,
Soon nipt him in two, and we never saw him more.
But what of it all, lads, shall we be down hearted
Because that may hap we may take the last sup,
Life's cable must one day or other be parted,
And death in safe mooring will bring us all up.
But it is always the way on it one scarce sinds a brother,
Found a pitch honest hearty, and true to the core,
But by battle or storm or some d -- thing or other,
He Is popp'd off the hooks, and we never saw him more.
LA CARMAGNOLE.
LOUD thundering cannons rend the air,
Loud thundering cannons rend the air,
To march ye warlike sons prepare,
To march ye warlike sons prepare,
Heroes of patriot flame,
While rushing on to fame,
Dance oh the Carmagnole,
May cannons roar,
May cannons roar,
Dance oh the Carmagnole,
May cannons roar evermore.
In vain those millions of our foes,
In vain those millions of our foes,
In impious union leagued oppose,
In impious union leagued oppose,
But dangers, death, and fire,
No slavish fears inspire:
Dance oh the Carmagnole, etc.

The famous Brunswick's flaming arm,
The famous Brunswick's flaming arm,
It Is said will do us wondrous harm;
It Is said will do us wondrous harm;
To teach him his mistake,
Let our fierce cannons wake;
Dance oh the Carmagnole, etc.

Since Doumourier's a rogue, they say
Since Doumourier's a rogue, they say
Our blooming laurels must decay,
Our blooming laurels must decay:
But they who thus surmise,
Shall gape with wild surprise:
Dance oh the Carmagnole, etc.

TRIUMPH OF LIBERTY.
Sung at a meeting of the Friends of the People in Edinburgh, (Scotland)

COME cheer up my countrymen, never be dismayed;
For Freedom her banners once more has displayed,
Be staunch to your rights, hark to Liberty's call.
For Freedom, dear Freedom, stand up one and all!
With heart and with hand
Swear firmly to stand,
Till oppression is driven quite out of the land.
To redress all our wrongs let M^n's Rights be applied;
Truth and justice they snow, and by these we'll abide.
Luxurious pomp, which brings taxes and vows,
No more we'll maintain with the sweat of our brows.
But with heart, etc.

The bold Rights of Man struck such terror and fear,
That stern proclamations in all parts appear:
But deter us they cannot -- for as friends well agree
The state to reform -- and we'll die or be free.
Then with heart, etc.

So much tribute we pay, that we scarcely can live;
For the light of the sun what a r^nt do we give!
To be told we are happy! it is mere gasconade;
We are burdened like slaves, and like pack-horses made!
But with heart, etc.

Then to Freedom press forward, like men who are wise,
And accompany France out of bondage to rise --
Like America's world; let us with them agree,
And join the grand concert -- To die or be free!
Then with heart, etc.

MARSEILLES HYMN.
[Written as nearly in imitation of the original as possible.]
RISE, patriot sons! the morn appears,
The dawn of glory gilds the world,
Against us, dark kings -- the source of tears --
Their bloody standards have unfurled.
Hark, shepherds! how the demons roar,
The shouts of ghastly slaves arise;
They come like fiends before your eyes,
To quaff your wives' and infants' gore.
CHORUS.
To arms, my country! form your matchless band,
March, march, that despots' blood may drench your native land.
What mean those slaves that throng our plains,
Those kings combined of sanguine cast?
For whom are those infernal chains.
Prepared for man in ages past?
On us, brave Gauls, what tempests lour!
What tripple wrath should patriots feel!
To ancient glooms and clanking steel,
They Would chain the victims of their power.
To arms, etc.

Good Heavens! and would a foreign band
Ordain for us domestic laws?
Would menial foes, with stern command.
Abuse our heroes and our cause!
Great GOD! must we with fettered arms
Beneath the yoke of tyrants bend!
Would their dark fiats prove our end,
And fate decree such dread alarms.?
To arms, etc.

No! tremble, dastards, with dismay,
The cursed reproach of all mankind;
Your impious deeds that shunned the day,
Shall feel our utmost wrath combined:
Our sons are heroes, miscreants yield!
And should those patriot sons expire,
From earth shall spring a race more dire,
Prepared to crush you in the field.
To arms, etc.

Intrepid Gauls! let wrath inspire,
Let vengeance flame withold your rage,
Ah! spare those victims of your ire,
Whose h^nds reluctant conflicts wage:
But smite those sanguinary kings,
And Bouille's dark detested brood.
Those fiends that drink their mothers' blood,
Those monsters with envenomed stings.
To arms, etc.

Oh sacred patriotic flame!
Be thou the intripid patriot's shield:
Oh virtuous Liberty! proclaim
Thine armies victors in the field.
Where thy triumphant standard flies,
May bright plumed victory repose,
May thy relentless dying foes,
Behold thy infants glories rise.
To arms, etc.

TRUMPET OF LIBERTY.
THE Trumpet of Liberty sounds through the world,
And the universe starts at the sound.
Her standard philosophy's hand has unfurled,
And the nations are thronging around,
CHORUS.
Fall, tyrants! fall! fall! fall!
These are the days of Liberty!
Fall, tyrants! fall!
How noble the ardor that seizes the soul!
How it bursts from the yoke and the chain!
What power can the fervor of Freedom control,
Or its terrible vengeance restrain?
Fall, tyrants! etc.

Proud castle of despotism, dungeons and cells,
The tempest shall sweep you away;
From the east to the west the dread hurricane swells,
And the tyrants are chilled with dismay.
Fall, tyrants! etc.

The slave on whose head the proud despots have trod,
Now feels that himself is a man,
While the lordly usurper who ruled with a nod,
Hides his head midst his servile divan.
Fall, tyrants! etc.

Poor vassals, who crawl by the Vistula's stream,
Hear, hear the glad call and obey!
Rise, nations! who worship the sun's facred beams.
And drive your Pizarro's away.
Fall, tyrants! etc.

The cruel dominion of priestcraft is over,
Its thunders, its faggots and chains;
Mankind will endure the wild bondage no more,
While religion our Freedom maintains.
Fall, tyrants! etc.

Shall Britons the chorus of Liberty hear,
With a cold and insensible mind?
No -- triumphs of Freedom each Briton shall share,
And contend for the rights of mankind.
Fall tyrants! etc.

GOD SAVE THE RIGHTS OF MAN!
GOD save the Rights of Man!
Give us a heart to scan
Blessings so dear!
Let them be spread around
Wherever man is found,
And with the welcome sound
Ravish each ear.
Let us with FRANCE agree,
And bid the world be free --
While tyrants fall --
Let the rude savage host
In their vast numbers boast --
Freedom's almighty trust
Laughs, at them all.
Though hosts of slaves conspire
To quench fair Gallia's fire,
Still shall they fail:
Tho traitors ronnd her rise,
Leagued with her enemies,
To war each patriot flies,
And will prevail.
The world at last will join
To aid thy great design
Dear Liberty!
To Russia's frozen lands,
The generous flame expands;
On Asia's burning sands
Shall man be free.
In this our western world
Be Freedom's flag unfurled
Through all our shores,
May no destructive blust
Our Heaven with clouds over cast,
May Freedom's fabric last
While earth endures.
If ever her cause should fail,
Ambition's fiends assail,
Slaves to a throne;
May no proud despot daunt --
Should he his standard plant,
Freedom will never want
Her WASHINGTON! --
THE PRIMROSE GIRL.
COME buy of poor Mary, Primroses I sell,
In London's famed city I Am known mighty well,
Tho my heart is quite sunk, yet I constantly cry
Who Will buy Primroses, who will buy Primroses,
Who Will buy Primroses, who will buy, who will buy.
Friends and parents I Have none. I Am looked on with scorn,
Much better ^^r me had I never been born,
I Am poo^ but I Am honest, I constantly cry
Who Will buy Primroses, who will buy Primroses,
Who Will buy Primroses, etc.

My companions despise me, and say that I Am proud,
Because I avoid them and keep from the crowd;
From wicked temptations I ever would fly,
I Will live by Primroses, come who will buy Primroses,
Who Will buy Primroses, etc.

If pity to virtue was ever allied,
The tear of compassion never yet was denied,
Then pity poor Mary. who plaintive does cry
Who Will buy Primroses, who will buy Primroses,
Who Will buy Primroses, etc.

LILLIES OF THE VALLEY.
OVER barren hills and flowery dales,
Over seas and distant shores;
With merry song and jocund tales
My love has past his hours;
Tho wan^dring thus he never could find
A girl like little Sally,
Who picks and culls -- and cries aloud,
Sweet Lillies of the Valley.
From whistling over the harrow'd turf,
From nesting of each tree,
He chose a soldier's life to wed,
So social, gay and free.
Yet tho the lasses love him well,
And often try to rally,
None pleases him like her who cries
Sweet Lillies of the Valley.
He Is now returned, crowned with applause,
To use his native toil --
From fighting in his country's cause,
To plough his country's soil.
I care not which, with either pleased,
So still he loves his Sally:
The little merry nymph that cries
Sweet Lillies of the Valley.
FREEDOM OR THE GRAVE.
FILL high the animating glass,
And let the electric ruby pass
From hand to hand, from soul to soul;
Who shall the energy ^ontroul,
Exalted, pure, refined,
The Health of Human kind!
CHORUS.
Assert the hallowed Rights which Nature gave,
And let your last best Vow, be FREEDOM or the GRAVE.
Not now a venal tribe shall raise
The song of prostituted praise,
To sov'reigns who have seized their power
But at this gay, this liberal hour,
We bless what Heaven desin'd,
The Health of Human kind,
Assert the hallowed, etc.

We turn indignant from each cause
Of man's dismay; from partial laws,
From kings who vainly seek by flight,
To fhun the blaze of Mortal light;
We bless what Heaven designed,
The Health of Human kind.
Assert the hallowed, etc.

STAND TO YOUR GUNS.
STAND to your guns, my hearts of oak,
Let not a word on b^^rd be spoke,
Victory soon will (...) n the joke,
Be ^lear and be ready:

Ram home our guns, and sponge them well,
Let us be sure the balls will tell,
The cannons roar shall found their knell,
Be steady, boys, be steady.

Nor yet, nor yet -- reserve your fire,
I do desire,
Now the elements do rattle,
The gods amazed behold the battle,
A broadside, my boys.

See the blood in purple tide.
Trickle down her bettered side,
Winged with face the bullets fly,
Conquer, Boys, or bravely Die:
Hurl destruction on your foes,
She sinks, huzza, to the bottom -- down she goes.

ACROSS THE DOWNS.
Sung in the Opera of No SONG NO SUPPER.
ACROSS the downs this morning,
As betimes I chanced to go,
A shepherd led his flock abroad,
All white as driven snow:
But one was most the shepherd's care,
A lamb so sleek, so plumb, so fair;
Its wondrous beauties in a word,
To let you fairly know,
'Twas such as Nelly from the fire,
Took off not long ago.
This lamb so blithe as midsummer,
His frolic gambols played,
And now of all the flock a head
The pretty wanton strayed;
A wolf that watched with greedy eyes.
Rushed forth and seized the tender prize;
The shepherd saw and raised a stone,
So round, so large, I vow,
'Twas like the cake that Nelly laid,
Upon the shelf just now.
This mon'strous stone the shepherd flung,
And well his aim he took;
Yet scarce the savage creature deigned
Behind to cast a look;
But fled as swift with footsteps light,
As he who brought the wine tonight;
I tried to stop the thief, but he
Turned round in rage, good lack!
So mad the lawyer scarce can be,
That Is hid in yonder sack.
BONNY CHARLEY.
O Dearly do I love to rove,
Among the fields of barley,
'Twas there that Charley told his love,
The blithe the winsome Charley:
Then he sa'd, and he so wooed,
And marriage was the parley,
What could I do but backle too
With bonny, bonny Charley.
CHORUS.
O my bonny, bonny boy,
My bonny, bonny Charley;
O my bonny, bonny boy,
My bonny, bonny Charley.
I ken the lasses rue the day,
I sought the fields of barley;
And strive to win from me away,
The heart of winsome Charley;
But ah! how vain, they canna gain
His love by all their parley;
And now they see he woos but me,
My bonny bonny Charley.
O my bonny, etc.

O ilka blessi^g on the lord,
Who owns the fields of barley;
And ken I him alone regard,
For he is winsome Charley;
The gentle youth, with purest truth,
So woos me late and early;
I cannot withstand, to give my hand,
To bonny, bonny Charley.
O my bonny, etc.

LET THE BILLOWS ROAR.
WHEN whistling winds are heard to blow,
In tempests over the earth,
The seaman's o^t dashed to and fro,
Yet cheerly take his birth:
And as he fearless mounts the shrouds,
A while the vessel swings,
The skies are mantled over with clouds,
The gallant sailor sings. --
CHORUS.
It Is pretty Poll and honest Jack,
My girl and friend on snore,
Will hail me at returning back,
So let the billows roar.
When bending over the rocky yard,
While seas in mountains rise,
He takes a spell however hard,
And danger never defies:
The storm once over, the gallant tar
Let Us fancy freely roam,
And though from many a friend afar,
Thus sings of those at home. --
It Is pretty Poll, etc.

On burning coasts, or frozen seas,
Alike in each extreme,
The gallant sailor's ever at ease,
And floats with fortune's stream:
To love and friendship ever true,
He steers life's course along,
And wheresoever sailing to,
Fond hope elates his song.
It Is pretty Poll, etc.

CHASE OF THE HARE.
THIS morning Aurora peeped over the hills,
And the frost had deserted the meadows and rills,
And the heart cheering horn did enliven the hound
Who with nostrils extended, snuff'd over the ground;
We mounted our horses devoid of all care,
For no pleasure can equal the chase of the hare.
To the chase we have been unattended by fear,
For friendship was present when danger was near,
With joy and delight the fleet hare we pursue,
What music can equal the hounds in a views;
When shouts and rejoicings then rended the air,
With the cry of the hounds at the death of the hare.
When the morn it is past, in the evening we join
In mirth and good fellowship, freedom and wine,
No disputes at our meeting shall ever appear,
No scoundrel partakes of our temperate cheer;
But with hearts fall of joy -- we sing merrily on,
Success to our Country, and great Washington.
WHEN I WAS A CHIT.
WHEN I was a chit, just got into my teens,
And the men would be asking a kiss;
Thinks I to myself I scarce know what it means,
But I think I ought not to say yes;
To be sure it was fine
When they called me divine,
Though I Have simper'd and cried let me go,
O dear, sir, O la!
I Will acquaint my mamma,
If that you keep teazing and sqeezing me so.
Improving in skill as advancing in years,
Each lesson of love got by heart,
More eager my hopes, more decided my fears,
Pure nature sought refuge in arts --
At each swain that drew nigh,
I looked under my eye,
And loighter'd, pretending to go;
If pressed to sit down,
I exclaimed with a frown,
How dare you keep teazing and sqeezing me so.
Coquetting's now over, and settled for life,
Each feeling is fairly confessed,
Attached to the duties of parent and wife,
It Is nature still reigns in the breast:
To my heart's bosom friend,
I no coolness pretend,
Nor from him seem anxious to go:
Nor ever complain,
With affected disdain,
But doubt whether squeezing be teazing or no.
BLUNDER O'WHACK.
COME listen awhile, and I Will sing you a ditty,
Shall make every soul of you laugh till you cry,
And own you never heard of a tale half so pretty,
As what I Am beginning to tell by and by;
It Is all about Blunder O'Whack of Kilkenny,
Who took once from Dublin to London a trip,
For staying at home I thought it all blarney,
So set off and walked all the way in a ship.
With my whack, etc.

For I Would an old uncle I tell you my honey,
Who died in the morning one night the other day,
And he very civily left me all his money,
Because, why, he could'nt well take it away;
So when I had money I rode it in chaises,
And looked very big upon those who had none,
For he that has no cash may walk if he pleases,
Or if that don't please him, why then he must run.
With my whack, etc.

So to London I came, and I thought it so pretty,
To see the folks crowding along in the street,
Where a body may walk from the strand to the city,
And run up against every soul that you meet;
And then there is the gentry so nate and so nimble,
As if to the business they born were and bred,
Who can slip off a watch, or a purse, or a thimble,
Or your pockets can pick of the hat off your head.
With my whack, etc.

Then there is Hugh's and Astley's odd whimseys and capers,
Where horses have every perfection but speech,
And the jockies all ride as you read in the papers,
On three horses at once with a leg upon each;
And then there is your sieges (...) battles so clever,
Where wooden battalions all join in the strife,
And soldiers of pasteboard each other dissever,
And all the dead men look as natural as life.
With my whack, etc.

Then for Dublin I traveled all night and all day,
While the ship in the water was led such a dance,
That somehow we found she would mistaken her way,
And instead of dear Dublin we landed in France;
Where if a man dare his opinion to mention,
Before he can speak it they chop of his head!
For those ugly spalpeens that are called the Convention,
Never try a poor fellow till after he is dead.
With a whack, etc.

And so by my conscience I left them behind, sir,
And soon made the best of my way from the south;
For how did I know but they might be so kind, sir,
As to send home O'Whack, with his head in his mouth.
And to London returned, I was pleased do you see, sir,
To think from those blood hounds I safe had got back,
For if the had happened to Guillotine me, sir,
'Twould have spoiled all the singing of Blunder O'Whack.
With a whack, etc.

BONNY JIM OF ABERDEEN.
THE tuneful lav'rocks cheer the grove,
And sweetly smells the summer green:
Now over the meed I love to rove
Wi' bonny Jim of Aberdeen.
Bonny Jim of Aberdeen,
Bonny Jim of Aberdeen:
Now over the mead I love to rove
Wi' bonny Jim of Aberdeen.
CHORUS.
Whenever we sit beneath the broom,
Or wander over the lee,
He Is always wooing, wooing, wooing,
Always wooing me.
Whenever we sit, etc.

He Is fresh and fair as flowers in May,
The blithest lad of a' the green;
How sweet the time will pass away
Wi' bonny Jim of Aberdeen.
Whenever we sit, etc.

Wi' joy I leave my father's cot,
Wi' ilka' sport of glen or green,
Well pleased to share the humble lot
Of bonny Jim of Aberdeen.
Whenever we sit, etc.

OUR COUNTRY IS OUR SHIP.
OUR country is our ship, do you see,
A gallant vessel too;
And of his fortune proud is he
Who Is of Columbia's crew.
Each man, whatever his station be,
When duty's call commands,
Should take his stand,
And lend a hand,
As the common cause demands.
When any haughty enemies
Our Federal ship assail,
Then all true hearted lads despis^
What perils may prevail;
But shrinking from the cause we prize,
If lubbers skulk below,
To the sharks
Heave such sparks,
They Would assist the common foe.
Among ourselves, in peace, it is true
We quarrel -- make a rout
And having nothing else to do,
We fairly scold it out.
But once an enemy in view,
Sh^ke hands -- we soon are friends,
On the deck
Till a wreck,
Each the common cause defends.
WOMAN.
Sung in the Bagatelle of the "Lock and Key."
A WOMAN is like to -- but stay --
What a Woman is like, who can say?
There Is no living with or without one --
Love bites like a fly,
Now an ear, now an eye,
Buz, buz, always buzzing about one.
When she is tender and kind,
She is like, to my mind,
(And Fanay was so, I remember)
She is like to -- Oh dear!
She Is as good very near
As a ripe melting peach in September.
If the laugh, and she chat,
Play, joke, and all that,
And with (...) and good humor she meet me,
She is like a rich dish,
Of ven'son or fish,
That cries out from the table, come eat me!
But she will plague you, and vex you,
Distract and perplex you,
False hearted and ranging,
Unsettled and changing.
What then do you think she is like?
Like a sand? like a rock?
Like a wheel? like a clock?
Aye, a clock that is always at strike.
Her head's like the Isl^nd folks tell on,
Which nothing but monkeys can dwell on;
Her heart's like a lemon -- so nice
She carves for each lover a slice;
In truth, she is to me,
Like the wind, like the sea,
Whose raging will hearken to no man;
Like a mill,
Like a pill,
Like a flail,
Like a whale,
Like an ass,
Like a glass.
Whose image is constant to no man;
Like a flower,
Like a shower,
Like a fly,
Like a pie,
Like a pea,
Like a flea,
Like a witch,
Like the itch,
Like a thief,
Like -- in brief,
She Is like nothing on earth -- but a Woman.
EDWARD AND KITTY.
NED often had braved the field of battle,
Had often endured the hardest woe;
Had been where deep-mouthed cannons rattle,
And often been captur'd by the foe;
His heart was kind, to fear a stranger,
His country's glory was his pride;
He nobly scorned to shrink from danger,
And on a bed of honor died.
For, says Ned, what ever befalls,
A Freeman scorns to flinch or whine,
He Will cheerful go where duty calls,
And brave all ills but never repine.
Ned loved sincere his charming Kitty.
She saw with tears her soldier go;
She prayed kind heaven to led her pity,
And shield her Edward from the foe:
My love, he cried, thy grief give over,
Those tears disgrace a soldier's bride:
But hapless Kitty lost her lover,
Who on a bed of honor died.
For, says Ned, etc.

O PITY A MAIDEN.
YE youths wheresoever ye wander so free,
I pray give attention and listen to me,
For truly my case is distressing and hard,
If none of your sex will my counsel regard:
If you wish for a wife,
To be happy for life,
Here Is one that will sell you a heart for a heart;
Come, come, prithee buy,
Or else I shall die,
O pity a maiden and pray take her part,
An, do -- ah do --
O pity a maiden, and pray take her part.
Full seventeen summers have now rolled along,
And still I Am unmarried -- a little too long!
But, since I have waited the time I have said,
I Will tell you the husband I now wish to wed:
Good sense I must find,
In the youth to my mind,
Not a fop or a coxcomb can ever touch my heart;
No, no -- he must be
Good tempered and free --
O pity a maiden, and pray take her part.
An, do -- ah do, etc.
Should you turn in your minds now a virgin's advice
I charge you, ye bachelors con't be too ni^^;
Though for virtue, and so forth, I may stand the ^est,
O, you will find me no more than a woman (...)!
Indeed it is true,
So mind what you do,
Ere you dare for the temple of Hymen to start;
But should you incline
Hand and heart to entwine,
O pity a maiden, and pray take her part.
Ah, do -- ah, do, etc.
PADDY O'BRIAN.
Sung in the Opera of "Widow and No Widow."
WHEN first I was kitten'd, it was in Kilkenny,
Such a brat sure as me, oh! there never was any;
Nay, the truth is, my father suspected my mother,
For the dible a bit was I like one or the other.
Sing rub-a-dub, row-de-dow, Paddy O'Brian.
Sing rub a-dub, etc.
To be sure I Am by nature as tame as a lion;
Och! the world never saw such a Paddy O'Brian.
That my father was kind and my mother was tender,
By my shoul I Have more reasons than one to remember;
For to sharpen my stomach, and brighten my wit, sir,
Sure they left me to live upon what I could get, sir,
Och! rub-a-dub, etc.
Och! my daddy's a god, and my mammy's a lion:
Ay, and I am the devil, old Paddy O'Brian.
That my parents were give to living genteely,
By my shoul is no lie, so I tell you it freely,
That if one daddy dies I have Hill g^^^ ^other,
And so I Am the bastard of one or the the other.
Och! rub-a-dub, etc.
To be sure and my mother was rather a sly one,
When she got such a chicken as Paddy O'Brian.
MIND, HUSSY, WHAT YOU DO
WHEN I was of a tender age,
And in my youthful prime,
My mother often would in a rage,
Cry, girl take care in time;
For you are now so forward grown,
The men will you pursue --
And all the day this was her tone,
Mind, hussy, what you do!
Regardless of her fond advice,
I hastened over the plain,
Where I was courted in a trice
By each young sylvan swain;
Yet, by the bye, I must declare,
I virtue had in view,
Although my mother cried beware,
Mind, hussy, what you do!
To Damon, gayest of the green,
I gave my youthful hand,
His blooming face and comely mein
I could not well withstand;
But strait to church we tript away,
With hearts both firm and true,
And then my mother ceased to say,
Mind, hussy, what you do!
Ye lasses all attend to me,
And hence this lesson learn,
When to your mind a man you see,
Never look morose or stern;
But take him with a free good will,
Should he have love for you.
Although your mother's crying still
Mind, hussy, what you do!
THE DRUNKEN COBBLER.
SO, safe arrived at last; thanks to a strong brain and a good understanding;
-- yes, pox, on to dogs! they thought to have mastered me by plying this
leathern throat of mine with as much liquor, as though I had been an Alderman
at a city feast; but honest Crispin of Cripplegate bit 'em, and came away with
his budget full, and as sober as ever I Would wish to be. Betty, Betty, bring me a
pot of half and half, but be sure don't mix it. -- Let Us see, what have we got
here? -- Confound the backs of these chairs! they are always behind. -- Hum --
what a d -- mn'd candle's this, one can hardly extinguish the Argus from the
Daily Advertiser only by its crowing: -- Hah! (reading) Commercial Advertiser
-- It is said that the Doctor Banks and Mr Sal-a-man-der, will, by command of
her majesty, undertake a voyage round, -- hum -- the bum dress of the present
month, ah! and orders are received at the victualing-office accordingly, for
thirty-six months provisions. -- Hum -- we hear from Calisle, that as a great
personage was going in his carriage to Windsor, he fell asleep with the candle
burning in his hand, and set fire to the bed clothes: -- Aye, that might happen
through the carelessness of the driver. So, Whitehaven, -- Yesterday arrived
from Philadelphia, with dispatches on board -- the most violent storm of
thunder and lightning ever remembered: Pshaw! that is nothing but a bam upon the
ministry. Yesterday morning about three o'clock this afternoon, a fire broke
out in an empty house, and entirely consumated all the furniture; an elderly
middle aged woman, coming by at the same time, fell into a cinder-sieve and was
drowned. Saturday morning about four o'clock in the afternoon, a woman was
committed to Bridewell, for barbarously scraping her bastard child to death
with oyster shells; first murder of the kind I ever heard of. -- Domestic news.
August the 34th. -- Yesterday a woman was safely delivered of a fine boy with a
wooden leg. Oh! this is all d -- d lies, this can never be true. (Lights his
pipe) -- I went to see a friend of mine ^'other day; he is a coachman in a
gentleman's family, and he asked me to go to the play with him: Plays, s^ys I,
why what play is it? "Why, (says he) it is King Hamlet and the Prince of
Dunkirk." King Hamlet and the Prince of Dunkirk, says I, that can never be; for
I have got all the Roman emperors (...) up in my closet, and I am sure there is
none of their names begins with H, enless it is Titus Vasnpasion. -- So
presently the cock and coachman got quarrelling about who had traveled
farthest; and in the midst of the scuffle the cook tumbled the coachman into
the dripping p^n; now, says the coachman I may swear I have traveled farthed,
for I have traveled into Greece; indeed so he had for he was d -- 'd greasy.

I have three as fine children as any man would wish to stick a knife into:
There Is my son Tommy, he is a fine scholar; he writes two exceeding fine hands,
one he cannot read himself, and the other nobody can read for him. Now there is
my daughter Polly, she lives with an old parson; she was so d -- n'd cunning
the other day, as to mend the parson's black stockings with white worsted; so
that the poor parson was forced to hop to church like a magpye. -- Why, Betty,
Betty, this son of a whore of a maid goes up stairs forty times in a day, and
never comes down again. -- But it is all one to Crispin, -- let the world go as
it will I can divert myself with an old song.

Tol de roll lol, etc.
