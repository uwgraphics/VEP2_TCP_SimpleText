VERSES Occasioned by the EARTHQUAKES in the Month of November, 1755.
By Jeremiah Newland.
O God of Mercy thou art good,
Thou Care for us did take,
When by thy Hand thou did Command,
the Earth and Sea to shake.
What Heart so hard that cannot be jarr'd,
when thou the Earth does shake:
O Lord what Eye can then be dry,
in terrible EARTHQUAKE.
Thy terrible Hand is on the Land,
by bloody War and Death;
It is because we broke thy Laws,
that thou did shake the Earth.
Is ten good Men in each Town then?
because our Towns are spared!
Bless God that they have made a Way,
that God might us Regard.
God looked strait in Sodom's Gate,
but ten good Men were not;
But yet we see he did agree,
with Abraham and Lot.
God would be just if he had thrust
us in the gaping Ground;
When we did shake by the Earthquake,
clean is his guiltless Throne.
Come to the Lord with one Accord,
and forth his Praises sound;
For seeing he so kind to thee,
and not to sink the Ground.
For by God's Hand, New England
was spared from much hurt;
Though some buildings he down did fling,
and lev'led with the dirt.
We see O Lord, that thou have jarr'd
most every Habitation;
By that we know, you are strong enough
to sink the whole Creation.
Let every Tongue, both Old and Young,
and every Nation praise
The God of Host and Holy Ghost, for Christ, his Saints will raise.
By rending Rocks and by Earth Shocks,
graves open by Direction;
The Saints arose and that to see
our Savior's Crucifixion.
The old must dye, you cannot deny,
the young he does command;
The middle-age when death engage,
though strong, yet cannot withstand.
What Age or Sect will then neglect,
a Pardon for to seek;
When God has told the Young and Old
as plain as Words can speak.
Then do not say old People may
be ever too old for Death;
For it is sent in a Moment,
'twill snatch away their Breath.
Then O young Man, don't say you can
your self from Death deliver;
Your Fathers surely now are dead;
Can Prophets live for ever?
O how can we who sinners be
expect a dwelling here?
When God does call, both great and small
to Judgment must appear.
What shall I say, of Youth, I pray;
O! Can they Conquer Death?
For when it goes with deadly Blows,
'twill strike away their Breath.
There comes a Day, the Scriptures say,
when every Tribe must meet,
To see the Judge of Quick and Dead,
at his Tribunal Seat.
O what a Day the Scriptures say,
the EARTHQUAKE does foretell;
O turn to God, lest by his Rod,
he cast thee down to Hell.
Mountains like Rams and Hills like Lambs,
they Skipping till declined;
The Rocks then clifts so fast,
no Shelter could I find.
Where shall I run for Shelter then,
but unto Christ my Rock,
And pray that he will Shelter me
amongst his chosen Flock.
That I might stand at Christ's right Hand
the Day of Great Assize;
And sing most sweet and fly to meet,
my Jesus in the Skies.
O God of Grace shine on my Face,
The Beams of Glory shine;
That I might Sing to Christ my King,
when he says I am thine.
Then do attend, O Lord and send,
thy Jonah unto us;
That he may Preach and ever Teach,
and take away the Curse.
Then give us Space and give us Grace,
that we may give thee praise;
We know not but we shall be sunk
in less than forty Days.
Blessed be God that I have trod
the Earth that might have fell;
For it is he that makes me,
in Safety for to dwell.
Lord guide our Way in every Day,
and give us Hearts of Prayer;
That so we may not go the Way
into the Devil's Snare.
Pardon the Sin we was born in,
that is the Original;
And keep us from the Way that goes
into the Gate of Hell.
And let O Lord, thy Spirit guard,
our Bodies Day and Night;
Thou might most justly cut us off,
and cast us out of Sight.
The Lord has told he cannot behold,
the Face of a Deceiver;
But he delights and so invites
the penitent Believer.
If you deceive and cannot believe,
you surely then shall feel,
The Weight of Wrath the Curse for Sloth,
that God will then reveal.
Believe I pray what God did say,
the Words are of his Mouth;
For what he said he will make it good,
he swear it with an Oath.
Blessed three in one, Father and Son,
the Holy Ghost, thy Spirit;
Because that he is the way to thee,
though he is not our Merit.
And O therefore we must adore
our Jesus for his Merit;
For it is by the Eternal three,
the Father, Son and Spirit.
And pray that he would take from thee
if it should be his Will;
That heavy Judgment which he sent,
and send us Mercies still.
Let every knee, Lord bow to thee,
and every Tongue confess;
That thou art Lord, and by thy Word,
do Judge in Righteousness.
Take away Sin that cursed thing,
in which we did delight:
Make us a People near to God,
and form our Spirits Right.
Let us in Time, whilst we have Prime,
for to be getting Store:
Whilst in our Health, for to get Wealth
that last for ever more.
Don't covet more, nor cheat the Poor,
don't scorn thy Enemies;
For what you get, by false deceit,
wisdom calls vanity.
If you be great in your Estate,
'twill lead you in a snare;
The little that the poor Man gets
is Blessed, though he is Poor.
Don't think that we more Righteous be,
because we did Escape:
Although some Towns were tottered down,
when as the Earth did Shake.
Let us not stand at Babels hand,
Let Us not a Tower have;
Lest we come down unto the Ground,
and loose our Language then.
O Jesus! send Angels to tend
and fetch us home from far;
That we may run to that bright Sun
which is the Morning Star.
And so O Lord, send forth thy word,
into our inward Parts:
And write a Law of Gratitude,
and set it on our Hearts.
Don't when you look despise these Lines,
though you may the inditer,
Because my Tongue, is not like one
that is a ready Writer.
And do not look upon these Lines,
to make a merry Story;
But when you read do then proceed,
to give to God the Glory.
Then let us join with one Design,
our thankful Voices raise;
And sing to him that died for Sin,
who is worthy of our Praise.
For in his Face shines Beams of Grace,
a Pardon has in Store;
He died for Sin and rose again,
who lives for Evermore.
And don't I say forget that Day,
the Eighteenth of November;
On Tuesday Morn the Lord did warn,
let us always remember.
FINIS.
