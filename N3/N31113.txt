King AGBARUS's Letter.
I Have heard of thee, and of the Cures wrought (...) thee, without Herbs or
Medicines: For as (...) reported, thou restorest Sight to the Blind, makes the
Lame to walk, cleanses the Leprous, raises (...) Dead, casts out Devils and
unclean Spirits, and heals those that are tormented with Diseases of long
^ontinuance. Having heard all this of thee, I was ^ly persuaded to believe one
of these two Things, ^^her, That thou art the very God, and come down ^^om
Heaven to do such Miracles; or else, That thou ^^t the Son of God, and
performest them: Wherefore (...) have now sent thee these Lines, entreating
thee to ^^me hither and cure my Disease: Besides, having ^eard that the Jews
murmur against and contrive to (...) thee Mischief, I invite thee to my City,
which is (...) little one indeed, but beautiful, and sufficient to ^^tertain us
both.

Our Savior's Answer.
BLessed art thou Agbarus for believing in me, whom thou have not seen: For it
is written of (...), That they which have seen me should not ^^lieve in me,
that they which have not seen me should believe and be saved. But concerning
the ^atter thou have written about, th^se are to acquaint (...) that all Things
for which (...) sent hither must (...) fulfilled, and then I shall be taken up,
and return (...) him that sent me; but after my Ascension I will (...) one of
my Disciples, who shall cure thee of thy ^istemper, and give Life to thee, and
to them (...) are with thee.

LENTULUS's Epistle to the Senate of ROME.
THere appeared in these our Days a Man of Virtue, called Jesus Christ, and by
the People a ^^^phet, but his own Disciples call him the Son if (...): He
raises the Dead, and cures all Manner (...) Diseases: A Man of Stature,
somewhat tall and ^ely, with a reverend Countenance, such as the Be^er may both
fear and love; his Hair is the Color (...) Chestnut full ripe, and is plain to
his Ears, but from thence down somewhat curled, but more orien^ of Color, was
^eing about his Shoulders; in the Mid of his Head goes down a Seam of Hair or
parting like the Nazarites; his Forehead very plain an^ smoothe; his Face
without either Spot or Wrinkl^ beautified wi^h a comely Red; his Nose and Mout^
are so formed that nothing can be reprehended; h^^ Beard thick, the Color of
his Hair; his Eyes gray* clear and quick: In reproving he is severe, in
coun^seling courteous; he is fair spoken and pleasant i^ Speech, mixed with
Gravity: It cannot be remembere^ that any have seen him laugh, but many have
see^ him weep: In Proportion to his Body he is well shap^ed and straight; his
Hands and Arms are very de^lectable to behold; in Speaking very temperate,
mode^^ and wise, A Man for his singular Beauty, far ex^ceeding all the Sons of
Men.

HYMN of PRAISE to the Name of JESUS, the SAVIOR of Mankind.
AWake my Soul! my Glory, rise and sing!
Awake, and all thy sacred Ardour bring
While for unusual flight, I spread a towering wing
Let each harmonious String
Awake my lute! proud of the glorious theme,
Tremble with rapturous joy, and speak the might^ NAME
Assist me every gentle sound,
Which studious arts has found:
You, that speak with silver strings,
Or swell with tuneful breath,
And lend the coward wings,
To meet the face of death:
You, that in the rural strain,
Echo through the peaceful plain,
^elight the groves, and charm the guiltless swain*
With you, that various joys afford,
Touched by a skilful hand,
Which can the powr's of harmony comma^^*
^ad dance with graceful art along the tuneful ch^^d;
You that with vocal music please the Ea^
Your choicest strains prepare;
^he springs which move our inmost Though^s you
And can their fiercest rage control, ^how,
While from your lips torrents of pleasu^^ ^ow,
And overwhelm the soul.
^ith JESUS we begin, his charming (...)
Shall fill the spacious song,
And yield an endless theme,
To every note the joyful wo^^ we'll place,
Our soft preludiums this alone shall grace,
And every cadence artfully prolong.
New smiles already NATURE wears,
All blooming looks, and gay;
^he brightened SUN crown^ with fresh beams appears,
And darts a clearer ray,
T^ (...) NAME!
Who^e accents to the ransomed world proclaim
Salvation and immeausurable grace,
Peace and good will to all the human race,
A purchased heaven, an open paradise,
Unbounded joys and never-ending bliss.
^
(...) ^rove?
^
The martyrs glorious train,
Thy noble votaries of old,
In records of immortal fame enrolled,
Wore on their breasts inscribed thy might^ NAME.
By THIS, with sacred Fortitude inspired,
With heavenly zeal and transport fired,
They ran upon the pointed spear,
And leaped into the flame:
(...) death could in no shape appear,
(...) what with open arms they met
Despi^^^g all that rage could do, or proudest tyrant threat
(...) hell itself their constancy could shake:
(...) deepest stratagems they brake,
In mi^dest fury trample down,
And seiz^d with conquering hands the everlasting crown
JESUS, (...) signal for the FIGHT they chose,
And gave a glorious onset to their Foes:
In vain the powers of earth and hell oppose,
JESUS, our conquering chief, they cried;
JESUS, alone the sounding skies replied.
Exalted ^AME!
From THEE the bu^ning seraphs catch their flam^
JESUS, the GOD! it is (...) alone can tell
What treasures in that (...).
Ye happy spirits that feel its em^^^^s,
By this you stand confirmed in bliss,
And (...) what boundless joys are stored
In (...) ^^portant WORD.
The glorious (...) only suits
The high-strain (...) ^ortal lut^^
