A POEM, etc.
AWAKE, awake, my drowsy muse,
That has been slumbering long;
The great salvation of our God
This day demands a song.
2.
God is a refuge for his saints
In a dark stormy day;
His ear indulges their complaints,
He hears them when they pray.
3.
How vast is that Almighty power
That governs all below!
That rools the wheels of providence
Directs them where to go.
4.
When tyrants rise to vex his saints
By laws their mischief frame.
He makes their own devices prove
To their eternal shame.
5.
Proud Haman must be hanged upon
The gallows he had made;
And Burgoyne fell into the snare
That his own hands had spread.
6.
Britain the mother ^^^^^^y;
Our fathers cam^^^^ there;
Whose interest (...) did once defend,
With (...) prayer
7.
Had ^^r^d against her young as th^^
(...) never (...) own,
And (...) by a law,
(...) from the throne.
8.
(...) the second always strove
By who e^^me (...) to (...),
'Till be expi^^^ (...) lest the crown
In the hands of ^^^ol.
9.
Sure (...) a (...)
Pa^^^^^ (...) m^^d
To make his finger prove more thick
Than was his father's loin.
10.
Had George the third example took
By Rea boam's fall,
America until this day
Had served him, one and all.
11.
I will proceed firstly to ^^d
The history of his plan;
Tell how the knave though it to enslave
His subjects in this land.
12.
In order to lay down my plan
I firstly will go back;
Tell how he changed the parliament,
And sent us the Stamp Act.
13.
Convulsion seized this continent
When first the act came here;
Unwelcome news it was indeed,
From one they loved so dear.
14.
It threw this vast great continent
Into great consternation;
To heaven they send their timely calls
For succor and salvation.
15.
Her strength at that time being small,
(An infant at the best)
The Lord of glory heard her call,
And sends her quick redress
16.
America now though it that they
Had broke the tyrant chain:
A constant peace with good increase
They hoped from George's reign.
17.
God for a time from us conceals
The Counsels of his heart,
How that one day America,
And Europe both must part.
18.
For she no longer must enjoy
Protection from her brother;
She must be wea^^d, not such the breast
Of her once render mother.
19.
Now she is condemned to punishment,
Not for one single crime;
And doomed to be her mother's slave
Down to the end of Time.
20.
In order to effect their plan
They block up Boston port;
As Solomon says o^ a fool,
That "Mischief is his sport."
21.
They though it if they blocked Boston in,
And so^cely ga^e them breath,
That all this vast great continent
Would near be s^ar'd to death.
22.
Now having well block^d Boston in,
And fortified he^ shores,
The next sent out to Lexington,
For to destroy our stores.
23.
And thursting much for human blood,
Like cruel savage beasts,
'Twas there they shed the blood of war,
All in the time of peace.
24.
The God to whom reveng ^elongs,
As you may now well think,
Though It it high time for this great crime
To give them blood to drink.
25.
And while they boast of what they would done
Singing their savage song,
The neighboring towns repair to arms,
For to revenge their wrongs.
26.
By this time they rack all their wits
To gain a s^^e e^^eat,
But every where that they repair,
The musket ^^ls they meet.
27.
Many are sl^^n on the retreat,
And cast among the dead;
Summoned before God's awful bar,
To bear their sentence read.
28.
Others are wounded on the way,
And some get back again;
Perhaps they had not yet filled up
The measure of their sin.
29.
They blook'd themselves in Boston safe.
To screne their guilty head,
And escape the vengeance due to them,
For blood that they had shed.
30.
And having paid the price of blood,
Vengeance pursues them still,
Another sacrifice for them
There is at Bunker-Hill.
31.
Al though they had a victory,
And gained a little ground;
But yet near fifteen hundred men
Among the slain were found.
32.
Now near that number they have left
They sent to Lexington;
For murd'rers always must pay dear
For what their hands have done.
33.
Now having purchased Bunker-Hill,
And paid the price so dear,
They quickly fortified the ground,
And plant the cannon there.
34.
That so in Boston they might find
A refuge where to fly;
That such as shed the blood of man,
Might flee and might not die.
35.
'Twas there they hoped for quiet rest,
And there the tories fly,
And there most cruelly oppressed,
The sons of liberty.
36.
The wicked's triump^ is but short.
Precarious at the best;
They Are always like the troubled sea,
Whose waters cannot rest.
37.
For while they trust an arm of flesh,
And lean on Britain's power,
They are but like great Babylon,
Whose plagues come in an hour.
38.
Our troops advanced on Dochester;
Terrors do pierce them through
And now we see the wicked flee
When no man does pursue.
39.
But must they leave their pleasant home
And quit their peaceful shore?
Be carried to a foreign land
To see their friends no more.
40.
How are these wretches thunder struck,
Their hearts pierced to the center;
Now for the future let them pray
Their flight be not in winter.
41.
But woe to them that are with child,
And such as do give suck;
For how can they poor helpless souls
Endure the dreadful shock.
42.
And now to save a wretched life
They sail to Halifax;
Stowed in a ship heaps upon heaps,
Like fodder laid in stacks.
43.
God grant they may while on the way,
Seek mercy while they sail;
Toward his holy temple look,
Like Jonah in the whale.
44.
Should I pursue these wretches still
'Twold swell my subject long;
And tire the patience of all those
That read or hear my song.
45.
After a dark and stormy day,
The cloud grows often thin;
Sometimes a beam of shinning rays,
Then all clears off again.
46.
The God of armies on our side,
His banners does display,
Exerts his power on our behalf,
And drives these troops away.
47.
But oh! the wretched fruits of pride,
That bears the pisonous seed!
We though it our hand, and not the Lord's,
Had done this mighty deed.
48.
We did not render to his name
The glory that was due:
God shows an ang^y countenance,
Our troubles spring anew.
49.
Britain, with all their foreign powers
Against us now does join;
The Hessian or the German troops,
Together do combine.
50.
But while that they are gathering here,
They send to Maryland,
Hopeing to make that country feel
The weight of George's hand.
51.
We sent some troops to their relief,
Led on by General Lee;
A general action did ensue,
And they before him flee.
52.
And now once more the British troops
Do meet a dreadful shock*
They fall a pray like helpless sheep,
When wolves invaid the flock.
53.
Lord when I do of judgment sing*
I Will sing of mercy too:
For to thy name, thou sovereign king,
They both become thy due.
54.
Now British troops they have pers^^^^'^*
Great business of the sort,
And if it has not made them rich,
It must be their own (...).
55.
I leave them in their shattered ships
To follow General How;
Who said he came to pardon ^^ns,
Himself needs pardon now.
56.
Now British ships laden with troops,
Around Long Island swarms
As clouds that ^ather th^ck and ^^^^k,
B^^^^^ a dreadful (...).
57.
This is an awful fight indeed,
Alas! the dreadful day!
This day is great, big with the fate;
Of all America.
58.
The slumbering sons of liberty,
A^ now grown wide awake,
By this time they do plainly fee,
Their all does lie at stake.
59.
The dragon opens his mouth,
And pours out a flood:
Contending parties now do meet,
And blood it touches blood.
60.
But Oh! that Aaron would (as when,
The plague began to spread)
Firstly atone and stand between
The living and the dead.
61.
Methinks our troops they have this day
Now met with some disgrace;
An awful slaughter on both sides,
And they evacuate the p^ace
62.
And now it seems the British troops
Will soon perform their work;
For soon we hear that they have got
Possession of New York.
63.
The clouds they gather thick again,
Hide the maridian sun:
Another conquest they have gained,
They Have took fort Washington.
64.
When Moses's rod is lifted up,
God's mercy never fasts:
But when the rod of prayer sinks,
Proud Ameleck prevails.
65.
The wrestling Jacob's on this land
For mercy now are sueing*
That God would hear their humble groans,
And save this land from ruin.
66.
From this time forward we do (...)
^h^^ How begins to (...).
He loses men wherever he goes,
No conquest gains at all.
67.
The water turned from his course,
Though still it is descending,
It now and then may hurt a man,
But always keeps a spending.
68.
By Howe's long march the Jersey's through,
The most that he can glory,
Is now and then he robs a whig,
And now and then a tory.
69.
Brave Washington he now does feel
His blood begin to burn;
Tired of retreating, though it 'twas time
For him to take his turn.
70.
By this time How does plainly see
The hook is in his nose;
He turns his face and turns about,
And back the robber goes.
71.
He looses men on the retreat,
Which cost him many groans;
And all the way he sows the ground
With his own army's bones.
72.
Now he flies to the water side,
To rest his weary legs;
Quite disappointed, like a fowl.
That sits on rotten eggs.
73.
It seems this How is not a duck,
Nor yet is he an owl;
He is a very ravenous bird,
But yet a watery fowl.
74.
He does not ramble very far,
Like cruel beasts of slaughter,
Nor does he leap far in the deep,
But swims in shallow water.
75.
And now poor How must taste the gal^,
Instead of tarting honey;
For a long time does little else
But spend his master's money.
76.
At length he rouses up again,
Scours up his rusty gun;
Resolves that he will try once more
What farther might be done.
77.
And now I hear he is found his way
To Philadelphia town;
And there he lies all couped up,
Like ^attle in a pound.
78.
To leave him there till further news,
It Is now my next design
For to go on to write and read
The history of Burgoyne.
79.
Now the first news I hear from him.
He has got to Quebec;
Whose unexpected visit gave
Our troop a mighty check.
70.
Superior numbers teaches them
It Is prudent to retreat,
They flee before the enemy
Before that they are bea^.
71.
With many ha^dships and fatigues,
And with some loss of men,
(...) Ti^^nd ^oga fort
Th^^ come and make a stand.
72.
And qui^^ly there as I do hear,
The^ ^ortity the towers;
No, do^bting they should stand a fag
With Britains mighty powers,
73.
Infinite wisdom sees it fit
Our counsel^ should (...) crossed,
And afterw^^d^ to n^^i^e us gain,
For what to day we lost.
74.
Burgoyne advanced against the fort*
Against the ^^^r laid seige;
Our Gen'ral^s heart is filled with fear
At least he don't engage.
75.
This is a d^^k and gloomy day,
Our hearts are filled with fear,
Anxious for life and liberty,
To us equally dear.
76.
Sometimes the darkest time of night,
That veils all earthly things,
Is just before the dawning light,
When pleasant morning springs.
77.
Often in the summer at these hours,
Earth spreads her sable robe;
We cannot behold the pleasant showers,
That beautify the globe.
78.
Just such the case as it concerns
The providence of God;
Great threatening aspects it may wear,
With blessing in the rod.
79.
God's face seems covered with a veil.
His purpose does conceal:
We cannot see the mystery of
This wheel am^dst a wheel.
80.
But when his counsels come to light
We see the plan was wise;
These wings that seemed misterious things,
We see are full of eyes.
81.
But who can fathom these great deeps,
I find I Am qui^kly l^st*
Oh! may I trust God, mercy still,
Tho'^h my hopes seem crossed*
82.
T^^ on ^^^^ga is gave up,
Ou^ (...) ^^^ded to day;
Methinks that now America,
Thy glory fades away.
83.
O God that has rejected us,
Not with us army gone;
O gi^e us help for now we see,
Vain is the help of man.
84.
Burgoyne, a proud and wicked wretch,
Is pampered up with pride;
It seems he had Goliah's heart,
Who Israel's God defied.
85.
Where pride is rooted in the heart,
It does for ruin call;
A haughty spirit mostly goes
Before a dreadful fall.
86.
He tells his men the Americans
They are but Yankoies sons,
They cannot bear the powder scent,
Nor face the roaring guns.
87.
Methinks likes Cicero's mother now,
I hear him boast a while,
That he to Albany should go,
And there divide the spoil.
88.
To ev,ry man a maid or two,
That they should be his whore;
To cut and wound, to kill and scalp,
Almost at every door.
89.
Methinks I hear this wicked wretch
A boasting of tomorrow;
He little thought that fatal day
Would bring him so much sorrow.
90.
There Is not a promise of tomorrow
Recorded in God's law;
Besides, tomorrow is a day
No mortal ever saw.
91.
Whether we live to see the day,
Is what we cannot forsee:
Or If we do, much less can see
What its events will be.
92.
Many no doubt, while big with hope
Of finding Albany,
Are quick put down, and sent into
A long eternity.
93.
A fatal ball has seized them,
And plowed their bodies through,
Instead of finding Albany,
They bid the world adieu.
94.
Instead of joy and triumph songs,
Drinking each other's health,
Plund'ring and robbing, getting rich,
By their ill-gotten wealth.
95.
Instead of this, I say they have bid
The world along farewell;
And how their souls do fair to day,
No mortal tongue can tell.
96.
Their bodies serve no other use,
Now they lie in the dust,
But teach vain man he should not in
Uncertain riches trust.
97.
Instead of finding Albany,
Instead of wint'ring there,
Perhaps their souls they have gone down,
To darkness and despair.
98.
Good had it been for these poor men,
Had they but been so wise,
To learned those great important things
That are hid from their eyes.
99
And Oh! that we who living be,
Might lay these things to mind,
That so we may in the last day,
God's approbation find.
100.
But stay my muse, go back and trace
The footsteps of Burgoyne;
For I do hear he is upon
A very grand design.
101.
Methinks I see him marching on,
With a majestic grace;
Bending his way to Albany,
Quite certain of the place.
102.
Methinks I see that fire and cloud
That Israel once led,
Give light and vigor to our troops,
Darkness on Burgoyne's stead.
103.
And now the captain of God's hosts
His purpose^ reveals;
He leads the Egyptians in the seas,
Takes off their chariot wheels.
104.
Methinks I hear poor Burgoyne say
"We drag on heavily!
"Behold God fights for Israel,
"High time for us to flee."
105.
Burgoyne was not like old Baalam,
That could for see his fate;
But like a bird caught in a snare,
To fly is quite too late.
106.
The musk is crack about his ear^,
And cannons roaring louder,
By this time Burgoyne begins
To dread the smell of powder.
107.
Casting about his warry eyes.
He dreads this dreadful smoke,
While many of his men were slain,
And many more bef^^^ke.
108.
He must a hide the consequence,
For he began the play;
Fools that will never hear advice,
Are taught no other way.
109.
And now poor Burgoyne plainly seen
His nose is out of joint;
There Is nothing left for him to do,
But to give up the point.
110.
And now poor Burgoyne must lay down
His sword and swingling knife,
And cringe and bow, the Yankees to,
To save his wretced life.
111.
He Will want the money he has spent,
The Savages to pay,
For scalping his own men and ours,
His charges to defray.
112.
Now let him for the future learn
Never to play the fool;
May Britain see it is not they.
But it is the heavens that rule.
113.
In vain unjust and wicked laws
Came from a potent king;
If that the God of heaven and earth
Don't countenance the thing.
114.
And if God's word is such a thing,
A man may safely trust;
God never countenanced a law
That was not truly just,
115.
But O thou vast America,
O who is like to thee;
The shield of thy salvation's strong.
The mighty God is he.
116
This woman clothed with the sun,
That wears the starry crown,
That fled into this wilderness
The dragon for to shun.
117.
When storms of persecution rose.
In her own country,
God gave to her too eagles wings,
That she might hither slay.
118.
And here I humbly trust she shall,
By God's dear marcies kind,
For two whole times and one half time,
A strong protection find.
119.
This lovely vine God bro't from far.
Here planted with his hand;
He caused it deep root to take,
And it has filled the land.
120.
The dragon saw himself east out,
For his rebellious deed;
And being wroth now persecutes
This tender woman's seed.
121.
I humbly pray this woman may
Still put her trust in God;
Until the earth opens its mouth,
And swallows up the flood.
122.
Although she is in trouble now,
And feels her travel pains,
I trust God will deliver her,
And break the tyrants chains.
123.
Many a persecuting wave,
This woman may endure;
But still her firm foundation's
Supported by God's power.
124.
That God is in the midst of her,
Her enemies may know;
And God will rise up ^or her help,
And that right early too,
125.
This woman is weak in herself,

The wilderness her dwelling place,
