THIS Lottery is set on foot by a Resolution of Congress passed at
Philadelphia, the 18th day of November, 1776, for the purpose of raising a sum
of money (...) loan, bearing an annual interest of four per cent, which, with
the sum arising from the deduction, is to be applied for carrying on the
present most just and necessary war in defense of the lives, liberties and
property, of the inhabitants of these United States.

The fortunate adventurers in the first class, and so in the second and third,
who draw more than thirty or forty dollars shall, at their option, receive a
Treasury Bank Note for the prize or prizes drawn, payable at the end of five
years, and an annual interest at the rate of four per cent. for the preemption
of such tickets, in the next succeeding class, as shall not be renewed within
the time limited.

Every adventurer in the first class shall have a right to go through the
subsequent classes, but shall not be obliged to do it.

The drawers of twenty, thirty, and forty dollars, in the first, second, and
third classes, who do not apply for their money within six weeks after the
drawing is finished, shall be deemed adventurers in the next succeeding class,
and have their tickets renewed, without any farther trouble.

If any other shall neglect or decline taking out and paying the price of their
ticket for a subsequent class, within six weeks after the drawing is ended,
their tickets shall be sold to the fortunate adventurers in the preceding
class, or to such as shall apply for the same.

The fortunate adventurers in the last class, who draw fifty dollars shall,
upon application to the Commissioners of the loan offices; in the respective
states, where the drawers reside, receive their money without any deduction;
and all who draw above fifty dollars, shall receive in like manner, without
deduction, for the sums drawn, treasury bank notes, payable at the end of five
years after the drawing, at the loan office of the state in which the drawers
reside. The interest to commence from the last day of drawing, and to be paid
annually at the said respective loan offices.

As this lottery is established for the sole purpose of raising a sum of money
for carrying on the present just war, undertaken in defense of the rights and
liberties of America, in which every individual and posterity will be so deeply
interested, it is not doubted but every real friend to his country will most
cheerfully become an adventurer, and that the sale of the tickets will be very
rapid, especially as even ^he unsuccessful adventurer will have the pleasing
reflection of having contributed, in a degree, to the great and glorious
American cause.

The managers appointed by Congress are Sharp Delany, John Purviance, Owen
Biddle, David Jackson, Jacob Barge, Jonathan B. Smith, and James Searle, who
are upon oath, and give bond for the faithful discharge of their trust.

The drawing of the first class will begin at Philadelphia, the 10th day of
April next, or sooner, if sooner full.

The managers are instructed to sell the tickets for ready money only. Philad.
Dec. 6, 1776.

In CONGRESS, November 27, 1776.
Resolved, That it be recommended to the legislatures of the United States
respectively, to pass such laws as (...) most effectually tend to prevent the
COUNTERFEITING or FORGING the TICKETS of the public lottery.

Extract from the minutes, CHARLES THOMSON, Secretary.
