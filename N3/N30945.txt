1
WHAT Sounds are these of general Joy,
That on my Ear-Drums beat?
Each Face proclaims a merry Heart,
And Frolicks fill the Street.
2.
The Troops are come, Huzza! Huzza's
Is echoed through the Crowd;
Guns from the Castle flash and roar,
The Bells all ring aloud.
3.
Then to the lofty 'spiring Top,
of Beacon-Hill we went;
Thence took a View of Ships and Town,
a Show magnificent!
4.
Some with Laughing split their Sides,
others with Singing roar;
While some it is feared in Taverns drink
'Till they can drink no more.
5.
It Is hoped none stagger round the Street,
Nor dance nor caper high;
In Frolicks drink whole Bottles up,
Then toss them to the Sky.
6.
And thus with jolly Mirth they spend,
The twice, thrice welcome Day;
The Night in Town-House-Street some stand,
To see the Fireworks play.
7.
The next Day, was a Day of Joy,
It was a Thanksgiving:
The Forces land, and add new Cause,
For us aloud to Sing.
8.
The Tents around, most beautiful,
Form a delightsome Scene:
And thus they lie, all free from Care,
Quite placid and serene.
9.
The next Day, Sports of various Kind,
and Business filled their Hand:
And while on the Green Grass they lay,
Them Zephyrs gently fan'd,
10.
Some viewing were a Monkey Play,
and others a Baboon;
Such antic Postures pleased them so,
They missed to dine at Noon.
11.
Here some that left their Sweet-Hearts dear,
In doleful Dumps cried, "Oh!
"Pray little Cupid how could you,
"Pierce my poor, fond Heart so!"
12.
The Women mind their proper Work,
Though there were none a Spinning:
Yet they were looking up their Meat,
Or washing out their Linning.
13.
No Brauls or Fighting was there seen,
None wished his Brother ill:
Their Swords were made the French to cut,
And not each other Kill.
14.
Some listening were to Musick's Charm,
Which softly moved along:
It breathed inspiring over the Plain,
And pleased the attentive Throng.
15.
But now, the Day, the Day is come,
That They must take their March:
The Sun glows bright, and pours its Beams,
Through all the Heavens wide Arch.
16.
Busy as Bees, down go their Tents,
The Carts receive their Store:
To leave the Town themselves prepare,
To Victory to soar.
17.
Nor loitering in their Work are they;
But at the Hour of Six.
They all are ready for their March,
Not one Thing need they Fix.
18.
The Drum now beats, " Prepare to Arms!
They joyful at the Sound;
" We go to Victory," (they cry)
" And make our Name renowned."
19.
" Lo CANADA shall soon be our's,"
(They to each other say;)
Encouraging themselves in this,
They cheerful go away.
20.
The Streets all full to view the Sight,
Each Window crowded is;
While They majestic onward march,
Their Hearts are big with Bliss.
21.
See, all the Guns, they glisten bright,
At Distance seem to blaze;
While the soft Musick's gentle Sound,
In charming Concert plays.
22.
Behold them while they march along,
In dazzling Armor dressed;
True Courage shines in every Face,
Undaunted is each Breast.
23.
But now they are gone; O may Success,
On all their Ways attend!
May their bright Arms victorious prove,
And Conquests crown their End!
24.
With Pleasure they will hear the News
(...) we have won:
And with true Emulation fired,
Will scorn to be outdone.
25.
Relate, how FRONTENAC we took,
Down fell the high thick Walls;
The Inhabitants all wild with Fear,
Are scattered by our Balls.
26.
The Women out with Tongs did run,
The Cookmaids with their Spits;
Then from our Guns a Bullet flies
Which scares them into Fits.
27.
The Men are frightn'd and dismayed,
Some down the Cellars fled;
And there, for fear they should be scalpt,
Do feign themselves as dead.
28.
Some leave their Cannon, Fort and all,
And plunge into the Sea:
While others roar and cry aloud,
" What will become of We!"
29.
Such dismal Terrors were they in,
When marched our gallant Men;
They took their Fort and Plunder too,
And nothing let remain.
30.
Relate, how Daun with Army great,
Resisted PRUSSIA's KING:
HE took their Army, with Count Daun,
Who looked like any Thing.
31.
O, may our Forces all do thus,
Return with warlike Spoils,
And thus with glorious Fame we will
Reward them for their Toils.
SOLD at the Printing-Office in Newbury-street.
