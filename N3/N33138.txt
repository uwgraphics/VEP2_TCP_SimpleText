Poetess, in Boston, who came from ^frica at eight years of age, and soon became
acquainted with the ^^spel of Jesus Christ.
Miss WHEATLY; pray giv^ ^^ve to express as follows:

1.
O Come you pious youth! adore
The wisdom of thy God, Eccles. xi^.

In bringing thee from distant shore,
To learn his holy word.
2.
Thou might been left behind,
Amidst a dark abode; Psalm. cxxxv 2, 3.

God's tender mercy still combined,
Thou have the holy word.
3.
Fair wisdom's ways are paths of peace,
And they that walk therein, Psalm. i 1, 2, Prove. iii.7.

Shall reap the joys that never cease,
And Christ shall be their king.
4.
God's tender mercy brought thee here,
Tossed over the raging main; Psalm. ciii.^, 3, 4.

In Christian faith thou have a share,
Worth all the gold of Spain.
5.
While thousands tossed by the sea,
And others settled down,
(...) tender mercy set thee free, D^^th.

From dangers (...)
6.
That thou a pattern still might be,
To youth of Boston town,
The blessed Jesus set thee free, i Cor. v.10.

From every sinful wound.
7.
The blessed Jesus, who came down,
Unvailed his sacred face,
To cleanse the soul of every wound, Romans v.^1.

And give repenting grace.
8.
That we poor sinners may obtain
The pardon of our sin; Psalm. xxxiv.6, 7, 8.

Dear blessed Jesus now constrain,
And bring us flocking in.
9.
Come you, Phillis, now aspire,
And seek the living God, Matthew. vii.7, 8.

So step by step thou may go higher,
Till perfect in the word.
10.

And others left behind,
The blessed Jesus still adore, Psalm. lxxxix.1.

Implant this in thy mind.
11.
Thou have left the heathen shore, Psalm. xxxiv.^, 2, 3.

Through mercy of the Lord;
(...) more the heathen live no more,
Com^ magnify thy God.
12.
I pray the living God may ^e,
The shepherd of thy soul; Psalm. lx^x 1, 2, 3.

His tender mercies still are free,
His mysteries to (...) fold.
13.
Thou, Phillis, when thou hunger have,
Or pantest for thy God;
Jesus Christ is thy relief, Psalm xlii.1 2.3.

Thou have the holy word.
14.
The bounteous mercies of the Lord,
Are hid beyond the sky,
And holy souls that love his word, Psalm. xvi.10.11.

Shall taste them when they die.
15.
These bounteous mercies are from God,
The merits of his Son; Psalm. xxxiv 15.

The humble soul that loves his word,
He chooses for his own.
16.
Come, dear Phillis, be advised,
To drink Samaria's flood;
(...) nothing (...) that shall (...), ^

But Christ's redeming blood.
17.
While thousands muse with earthly toys,
And range about the street,
Dear Phillis, seek for heaven's joys, Matthew. vi.33.

Where we do hope to meet.
18.
When God shall send his summons down,
And number saints together, Psalm. cxvi.15.

Blessed angels chant, (triumphant sound)
Come live with me for ever.
19.
The humble soul shall fly to God,
And leave the things of time, Mat. v.3 ^.

Start forth as 'twere at the first word,
To taste things more divine.
20.
Behold! the soul shall waft away,
Whenever we come to die, Cor. xv.51, 52.53.

And leave its cottage made of clay,
In twinkling of an eye.
21.
Now glory be to the Most High,
United praises given,
By all on earth, incessantly, Psalm. cl.6.

And all the host of heaven.
