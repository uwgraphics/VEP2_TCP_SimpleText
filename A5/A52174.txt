LONDON: Printed for Tho. Parkhurst at the Bible and Three Crowns, at the lower
end of Cheap Side near Mercers Chapel, 1699.

THE PREFACE.
OUR Blessed Savior immediately before he went out to Suffer, Sung an Hymn,
and his Disciples Sung with Him; a^e to his Ascension into Heaven, the Apostles
S^ng the Praises of God, and Taught others to (...) so. After them, Primitive
Christians Sum, and so must the Christians of this time. (...) should hold
their Peace, the Stones would immediately Cry out: Should we be Si^^nt even the
Heathens might shame us. One (...) said formerly to his Friends, If I was (...)
Nightingale, I would Sing like a Nightingale; But now I am a Man. I will Sing
the Praises of God as long as I Li^e; and I would have you to Sing with (...)
Sing we then heartily to our good God as it (...) becomes us; so dear to us
should the Concernment of God's Honor be, that should Solemnly own his
Goodnes^ Power at Wisdom, even in those Works of His, where we have no special
Interest; For this we ha^ the Example of Holy David and others. B^^ if we have
not attained to so divine a Fran^ ^et we should at least praise God for our o^
Mercies; which are scarce Mercies scarce (...) if they be not Thankfully
acknowledge to Him that gave Them; some of which (...) taken Notice of in the
First Part of the B^^ But who can express the Noble Acts of (...) Lord, or show
forth all his Praises?

Solomon^ Song is an Heavenly (...) course betwixt Christ and his Church; and
how he loves Her^ How he extols H^^ H^^ he (...) Her! (...) be rejoice (...)
Her! It is a thing which cannot be duly tho^g (...) upon without an Holy
Astonishment; as is (...) Majesty^ so is his Mercy, so is his Love (...) Joy.
Hence it is that the day of his Espou^^ls, (...) d^y that (...) his (...) with
infinite Happiness) it is styled the day (...) Glad^^ss of his Heart, Chapter 5.
(...)

In the Version I Looked at the Words; In the Paraphrase at the Spiritual
Sense; In the whole at the Edification of those that Love our Lord Jesus Christ
in Sincerity.

Worthy is the Lamb that was Slain to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom and
Strength, and Honor, and Glory, and Blessing.

Let Heaven and Earth praise him, let Saints and Angels praise Him.

Let God's Holy Church throughout all the World praise Him; Let all the Tongues
and Tribes of the Earth praise Him, Let Time praise Him, Let Eternity praise
Him, Let our Lips and our Lives praise Him, Let our Souls praise Him; And O may
they be a Praise to the Riches of his Grace for ever!

Songs of Praise to Almighty God, upon several Occasions.
I. A General Song of Praise to Almighty God.
(1.)
HOW shall I Sing that Majesty
Which Angels do admire?
Let Dust in Dust and Silence lie,
Sing, Sing, ye Heavenly Quire.
Thousands of Thousands stand Around
Thy Throne, O God, most High;
Ten Thousand times Ten Thousand sound
Thy Praise; but who am I?
(2.)
Thy Brightness unto them appears,
Whilst I thy Footsteps trace,
A Sound of God comes to my Ears;
But they behold thy Face.
They Sing because thou art their Sun,
Lord, send a Beam on me;
^or where Heaven is but once begun
There Hallelujahs be.
(3.)
Enlighten with Faiths Light my Heart,
Inflame it with Loves Fire,
Then shall I Sing and bear a part,
With that Celestial Quire.
I shall, I fear, be dark and cold,
With all my Fire and Light:
Yet when thou do accept their Gold,
Lord Treasure up my Mite.
(4.)
How great a Being, Lord, is thine,
Which does all Beings keep!
Thy Knowledge is the only Line
To found so vast a Deep.
Thou art a Sea without a Shore,
A Sun without a Sphere,
Thy Time is now and evermore,
Thy place is every where.
(5.)
How good art thou whose Goodness is
Our Parent, Nurse and Guide;
Whose Streams do water Paradise
And all the Earth beside!
Thine Upper and Thine Nether Springs
Make both thy Worlds to thrive.
Under thy warm and sheltering Wings
Thou keep'st two Broods alive.
(6.)
Thy Arm of Might, most mighty King,
Both Rocks and Hearts does break.
My God, thou can do every thing
But what would show thee weak.
Thou can not Cross thy self, or be
Less than thy self, or poor;
But whatsoever pleases Thee,
That can thou do, and more.
(7.)
Who would not fear thy Searching Eye,
Witness to all that is true?
Dark Hell and deep Hypocrisy
Lie plain before its View.
Motions and Thoughts before they grow
Thy Knowledge does Espy.
What unborn Ages are to do
Is done before thine Eye.
(8.)
Thy Wisdom, which both makes and mends,
We ever much Admire.
Creation all our Wit Transcends;
Redemption rises Higher.
Thy Wisdom guides strayed Sinners home,
'Twill make the dead World rise,
And bring those Prisoners to their Doom;
Its Paths are Mysteries.
(9.)
Great is thy Truth, and shall prevail
To Unbelievers shame,
Thy Truth and Years do never sail;
Thou ever art the same,
Unbelief is a Raging wave,
Dashing against a Rock.
If God does not his Israel Save,
Then let Egyptians mock.
(10.)
Most pure and Holy are thine Eyes,
Most Holy is thy Name,
Thy Saints, and Laws, and Penalties,
Thy Holiness proclaim.
This is the Devils scourge and sting,
This is the Angels Song,
Who Holy, Holy, Holy Sing,
In Heavenly Canaan's Tongue.
(11.)
Mercy, that shining Attribute,
The Sinners Hope and Plea!
Huge Hosts of Sins in their Pursuit
Are drowned in thy Red Sea;
Mercy is God's Memorial,
And in all Ages praised;
My God, thine only Son did fall,
That Mercy might be Raised.
(12.)
Thy bright Back parts, O God of Grace,
I Humbly here Adore;
Show me thy Glory and thy Face,
That I may praise Thee more.
Since none can see thy Face and live,
For me to die is best,
Through Jordan's streams who would not dive
To Land at Canaan's Rest?
Another.
1.
WHat shall I Render to my God,
For all his Gifts to Me?
Sing Heaven and Earth, rejoice and praise
His Glorious Majesty.
Bright Cherubims, sweet Seraphims,
Praise Him with all your might.
Praise, praise Him, all ye Hosts of Heaven,
Praise him ye Saints in Light.
2.
Ye blessed Patriachs praise the Lord,
For his First Fruits are ye,
Blessed Prophets, who dreamt here of God,
Praise Him, whom now you see.
Offer to God ye glorious Priests,
Your Sacrifice of Praise;
Sweet Psalmists, now your Hearts are Fixed,
Your tuneful Voices raise.
3.
Yet twelve Apostles of the Lamb,
Who here proclaimed your King,
And Filled this World with holy Sounds,
Loud Hallelujahs Sing.
Triumphant Martyrs ye did Fight,
And Fighting ye did fall,
And falling ye took up a Crown:
Crown Him who Crowned you all.
4.
Praise, praise Him, all ye saved Ones,
From whom Salvation came;
Praise Him that Sits upon the Throne,
And Praise the Glorious Lamb.
Praise, praise him, all ye Saints below,
Praise him both East and West:
Praise him, all ye Baptized Lands,
Praise whom you have Professed
5.
O Praise Him, all ye Crowned Heads,
That own the Christian Name:
Praise Him, who is the King of Kings,
Raise and Enlarge his Fame.
Praise Him, all Christian Magistrates,
Gain Credit to his Ways:
Praise Him, ye Ministers of God,
Teach Others Him to Praise.
6.
Praise Him our Famous Christian Isle,
Praise him with one accord.
Let every Tongue, let every Tribe
Be taught to Praise the Lord;
Praise Him, my Friends and Kindred all,
O Praise Him all your Days;
My Mind and Heart, my Lip and Life
Join to advance his Praise.
7.
O Let me praise thee, whilst I live,
And praise thee, when I dye,
And praise thee, when I rise again,
And to Eternity.
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
The Father sent his Son;
The Son sends forth the Holy Ghost:
For Men's Salvation.
8.
Mysterious depths of Endless Love
Our Admirations raise,
My God; thy Name exalted is
Far above all our Praise.
III. A Song of Praise for Creation.
1.
THou wast, O God: and thou wast Blessed
Before the World begun;
Of thine Eternity possessed,
Before Time's Glass did Run.
Thou need none thy Praise to Sing,
As if thy Joy could Fade.
Could thou have needed any thing,
Thou could have nothing made.
2.
Great and Good God, it pleased Thee
Thy Godhead to declare;
And what thy Goodness did decree,
Thy Greatness did prepare:
Thou spak'st, and Heaven and Earth Appeared,
And Answered to thy Call;
As if their Makers Voice they heard,
Which is the Creatures ALL.
3.
Thou spak'st the Word, most mighty Lord,
Thy Word went forth with Speed,
Thy Will, O Lord, it was thy Word.
Thy Word it was thy Deed:
Thou brought forth Adam from the Ground,
And Eve out of his Side;
Thy Blessings made the Earth abound,
With these Two multiplied.
4.
Those three great Leaves, Heaven, Sea and Land,
Thy Name in Figures show;
Bruites feel the Bounty of thy Hand,
But I my Maker know.
Should not I here thy Servant be,
Whose Creatures serve me here?
My Lord, whom should I fear but Thee,
Who am thy Creatures Fear?
5.
To whom, Lord, should I Sing but thee,
The Maker of my Tongue!
Lo! other Lords would Seize on Me,
But I to thee belong:
As Waters haste unto their Sea,
And Earth unto its Earth;
So let my Soul return to Thee,
From whom it had its Birth.
6.
But ah! I Am fallen in the Night,
And cannot come to thee.
Yet speak the Word, Let there be Light;
It shall Enlighten me:
And let thy Word, most Mighty Lord,
Thy Fallen Creature raise,
O make me over again, and I
Shall Sing my Makers praise.
IV. A Song of Praise for Preservation.
1.
THou Lord who raised'st Heaven and Earth
Do make thy Building stand,
The Weight whereof does wholly Rest
On thine Almighty Hand:
Should thou withdraw thy Hand of might,
The Earth would quit its place;
The shining Heaven would vanish straight
Into mere empty Space.
2.
For as that Liquors Scent remains,
Which first the Cask did Fill;
So Feeble Creatures hold the Scent
Of their first nothing still:
Lord, what is Man, that Child of Pride,
That boasts his High degree?
If one poor moment he be Left,
He Sinks, and where is He?
3.
In Thee I Live and Move, and am,
Thou deal'st me out my days,
As thou renew'st my Being, Lord,
Let me renew thy Praise:
From thee I am, through thee I am,
And for thee I must be;
It Is better for me not to live
Than not to live to thee.
4.
My God, thou art my glorious Sun,
By whose bright Beams I shine;
As thou, Lord, ever art with Me,
Let me be ever thine.
Thou art my living Fountain, Lord,
Whose streams on me do flow;
My self I render unto thee,
To whom my self I owe.
5.
As thou, Lord, an Immortal Soul
Has;t Breathed into me;
So let my Soul be Breathing forth
Immortal Thanks to Thee.
V. A Song of Praise for Provision.
1.
COme, let us praise our Masters Hand,
Which gives us daily Bread;
Thy House, my Lord, is full of Guests,
Thy Table Richly Spread:
Earth is thy Table, where thy Guests
Do daily Sit and Feed;
Thy Hand Carves every one his part,
And suffers None to need.
2.
Naked came I into the World,
And nothing with me brought;
And nothing have I here deserved,
Yet have I lacked Naught.
I do not Bless my Laboring Hand,
My Laboring Head or Chance;
Thy Providence, most Gracious God,
Is mine Inheritance.
3.
Thy Bounty gives me Bread with Peace,
A Table free from Strife;
Thy Blessing is the Staff of Bread,
Which is the Staff of Life.
The People Sat in Companies,
My Savior Fed them all;
So all the Families of the Earth
Have Tables in Gods Hall
4.
The Vine and Olive Branches too
Are nourished by thy Care,
Mercies we Eat, Mercies we Drink,
Mercies we daily wear:
Shall I repine against my God
That kept me all my days?
Then let my Tongue forget to taste,
When it forgets to praise.
VI. A Song of Praise for Protection.
1.
MY God, my only Help and Hope,
My strong and sure Defense:
For all my Safety and my Peace,
I bless thy Providence:
The daily Favors of my God
I cannot Sing at large,
Yet let me make this Holy Boast,
I am the Almighties Charge.
2.
Lord, in the day thou art about
The Paths wherein I tread;
And in the Night, when I lie down,
Thou art about my Bed:
I travel through the Wilderness,
Free from the Beasts of prey.
The Wolves and Lions Mouths are stopped,
The Serpents creep away.
3.
In Preservation God Creates,
Delivers in Protection;
Lord, every Moment of my Life,
Is like a Resurrection:
^ thousand Deaths I daily 'scape,
I pass by many a Pit,
I Sail by many dreadful Rocks,
Where others have been split.
4.
I see blind People with mine Eyes,
To Hospitals I walk;
^ hear of them that cannot hear,
And of the Dumb I talk:
Lord, what am I that thou should show
Such Favor unto me?
My Bones and Senses, all must say,
Lord, who is like to thee?
VII. A Song of Praise for Health.
1.
HEalth is a Jewel dropped from Heaven,
Which Money cannot buy,
The Life of Life, the Bodies Peace,
And pleasant Harmony:
Lord who has Tuned my outward Man
To such a lively Frame,
Skrew up my Heart Strings all, to make
Sweet Melody to thy Name.
2.
Whilst Others in God's Prisons lie,
Bound with Afflictions Chains,
I walk at large, secure and free
From Sickness and from Pains:
Their Life is Death, their Language groans,
Their Meat is Juice of Galls;
Their Friends, but strangers; wealth, but want,
Their Houses, Prison-walls.
3.
Their earnest Cries do pierce the Skies,
And shall I silent be?
Lord, was I sick, as I am well,
Thou should have heard from me.
The Sick have not more cause to pray,
Than I to praise my King.
Since Nature teaches them to groan,
Let Grace teach me to sing.
4.
I see my Friends, I taste my Meat,
I Am free from my Employ:
But when I do enjoy my God,
Then I my self enjoy.
Lord, who do set me on my Feet,
Direct me in thy ways:
O Crown thy Gift of Health with Grace,
And turn it to thy Praise.
VIII. A Song of Praise for Family-Prosperity.
1.
THy Blessing, Lord, does multiply
One Jacob to two Bands,
One Person to a Family,
Which through thy Blessing stands.
On all my Flock both great and small
Thy Sun does Sweetly Shine;
Thy fruitful drops do gently fall
On every Branch of mine.
2.
Thy Blessing made the Loaves to grow,
And Multitudes were Fed.
My House is Filled and Feasted too;
It is an House of Bread:
How can I hear my Children Sing,
And not Sing unto thee?
Since they glad News from Heaven do bring,
My God must hear from me.
3.
Mine Olive Branches and my Vine
Thrive by my Tables Side,
Whilst others wither and decline,
Who in Deaths Shade abide.
With Covenant Blood my Posts are Red,
It Is on my Lintle found.
(...) Lo! the Line of Scarlet Thread
Is on my Window bound.
4.
It Is not, my God, my self alone,
But mine, to Thee I owe,
Thou made me many out of one,
So let thy Praises grow:
Whatever Lord is done to thine,
Thou count'st it done to thee:
And whatsoever's done to mine,
I Count it done to Me.
5.
Let me be ever good to thine,
Who art so good to me!
Let thine be mine, and mine be thine,
And they twice mine shall be;
Then shall my House a Temple be,
Then I and mine shall Sing
Hosanna's to thy Majesty,
And praise our Heavenly King.
IX. A Song of Praise for good Success in honest Affairs.
1.
IS not the Hand of God in this:
Is not this End divine?
Lord of Success, Thee will I bless,
Who on my Paths do shine:
I Reap the Fruit of God's Design,
By Him it was foreseen;
He thought of this as well as I,
Or it had never been.
2.
I Blindly guessed, but he foreknew,
I wished, he did Command;
Wherefore I praise his careful Eye,
And his Unerring Hand:
The Bow is draw by feeble Arms,
Aim taken in the Dark,
A Providential Hand does Guide
The Arrow to the Mark.
3.
Except the Lord the City keep,
The Watchmen will be slain;
Except the Lord do build the House,
The Builder Builds in Vain:
Buildings are Babels, Cities Heaps,
When thou send'st Curse or Flame;
And laboring Heads that promise Fruit,
Often bring forth Wind and Shame.
4.
But thou have Crowned my Actions, Lord,
With good Success to day;
This Crown, together with my self
At thy blessed Feet I lay:
Lord, who art pleased to prosper Me,
To bless me in my ways;
Prosper my weak endeavoring Heart,
Which Aims at thy Praise.
X. A Song of Praise for the Morning.
1.
MY God was with me all this Night,
And gave Me sweet Respose;
My God did watch even whilst I slept,
O^ I had never Rose:
How many groaned and wished for Sleep,
Until they wished for day,
Meas'ring slow Hours with their quick pains,
Whilst I securely lay!
2.
Whilst I did sleep all dangers slept,
No Thieves did me affright,
Those Evening Wolves, Those Beasts of prey,
Disturbers of the Night:
No Raging Flames nor Storms did Rend
The House that I was in;
I heard no dreadful Cries without,
No doleful Groans within.
3.
What Terrors have I 'Scap'd this Night,
Which have on Others Fell,
My Body might have slept its last,
My Soul have waked in Hell:
Sweet Rest had gained that Strength to Me,
Which Labor did Devour:
My Body was in weakness Sown,
But it is Raised in power.
(4.)
Lord, for the Mercies of the Night,
My humble Thanks I pay,
And unto Thee I dedicate
The first Fruits of the day:
Let this day praise Thee, O my God,
And so let all my days:
And O let mine Eternal Day,
Be thine Eternal praise.
XI. A Song of Praise for the Evening.
1.
NOW from the Altar of my Heart,
Let Incense Flames arise;
Assist me, Lord, to offer up
Mine Evening Sacrifice:
Awake, my Love; Awake, my Joy;
Awake my Heart and Tongue,
Sleep not when Mercies loudly call;
Break forth into a Song.
2.
Man's Life's a Book of History,
The Leaves thereof are Days;
The Letters Mercies closely Joined,
The Title is thy Praise:
This day God was my Sun and Shield,
My keeper and my Guide;
His care was on my Frailty shown,
His Mercies multiplied.
3.
Minutes and Mercies multiplied,
Have made up all this day;
Minutes came quick, but Mercies were
More Fleet and Free than they:
New time, new Favors, and new Joys,
Do a new Song require;
Till I shall praise Thee as I would,
Accept my Hearts desire.
4.
Lord of my Time, whose Hand has Set,
New Time upon my Score;
Then shall I praise for all my Time,
When Time shall be no more.
XII. A Song of Praise for the Birth of Christ.
1.
AWay dark thoughts; Awake, my Joy;
Awake, my Glory, Sing,
Sing Songs to Celebrate the Birth
Of Jacobs God and King:
O happy Night, that brought forth Light:
Which makes the Blind to see!
The Dayspring from on High came down
To Cheer and Visit Thee.
2.
The wakeful Shepherds near their Flocks,
Were watching for the Morn;
But better News from Heaven was brought
Your Savior Christ is Born.
In Bethlem-Town the Infant Lies,
Within a place obscure;
O Little Bethlem, poor in VValls,
But Rich in Furniture!
3.
Since Heaven is now come down to Earth,
Hither the Angels Fly;
Hark how the Heavenly Quire does Sing,
Glory to God (...) High:
The News is spread, the Church is glad,
Simeon, overcome with Joy,
Sings with the Infant in his Arms,
Now let thy Servant die.
4.
Wise Men from far beheld the Star,
Which was their faithful Guide;
Until it pointed forth the Babe,
And him they glorified:
Do Heaven and Earth Rejoice and Sing,
Shall we our Christ deny?
He Is Born for us, and we for Him;
Glory to God on High.
XIII. A Song of Praise for Christ.
1.
I HAVE found the Pearl of greatest price,
My Heart does Sing for Joy;
Sing I must; a Christ I have,
what a Christ have I!
Christ is the Way, the Truth and Life,
The Way to God and Glory:
Life to the Dead, the Truth of Types,
The Truth of Ancient Story.
2.
Christ is a Prophet, Priest and King;
A Prophet full of Light:
A Priest that stands 'twixt God and Man,
A King that Rules with Might:
Christ's Manhood is a Temple, where,
The Altar, God does Rest;
My Christ he is the Sacrifice;
My Christ, He is the Priest.
3.
My Christ, He is the Lord of Lords,
He is the King of Kings;
He is the Son of Righteousness,
With Healing in his Wings.
My Christ, He is the Tree of Life
Which in God's Garden grows,
Whose Fruits do Feed, whose Leaves do Heal,
My Christ is Sharons Rose.
(4.)
Christ is my Meat, Christ is my Drink,
My Physic and my Health;
My Peace, my Strength, my Joy, my Crown.
My Glory and my Wealth:
Christ is my Father and my Friend,
My Brother and my Love;
My Head, my Hope, my Counsell^
My Advocate above.
(5.)
My Christ he is the Heaven of Heaven,
My Christ what shall I call?
My Christ is first, my Christ is last,
My Christ is All in All.
XIV. A Song of Praise for Redemption.
1.
O That I had an Angels Tongue,
That I might loudly Sing
The Wonders of Redeeming Love,
To Thee my God and King!
But Man, who at the Gates of Hell,
Did Pale and Speechless Lie,
Must find a Tongue and Time to speak,
Or else the Stones will cry.
(2.)
Let the Redeemed of the Lord,
Their thankful Voices raise:
Can we be Dumb, whilst Angels Sing
Our great Redeemers Praise?
Come let us join with Angels then,
Glory to God on High;
Peace upon Earth, Good Will to Men,
Amen, Amen, say I.
(3.)
(...) Adam's Race was Satan's prey,
(...) And Dust the Serpent's Food:
(...) that were doomed to be devoured,
(...) naked and Trembling stood.
A Wise Eternal Pity then
Did helpless Man befriend;
Our Help did in God's Bosom Lie,
And thence it did descend.
4.
Love Clothed with Humility,
Built here an House of Clay;
In which it dwelt, and Rescued Man;
The Devil lost his prey:
The spiteful Serpent bruised Christ's Heel,
But then Christ brake his Head;
And left Him Nailed upon the Cross,
On which his Blood was shed.
5.
Sing and triumph in boundless Grace,
Which thus has set thee free;
Extol with shouts, my saved Soul,
Thy Saviors Love to thee:
Give Endless Thanks to God, and say,
What Love was this in thee;
That thou have not with held thy Son,
Thine only Son from Me!
6.
What were Ten Thousand Worlds to him,
Thine Image and Delight,
Had we been all cast down to Hell,
Justice had had its Right:
Thy Glory might have been distrain'd,
Our Torments should Express
Thy Pureness, Justice, Might and Truth,
And Everlastingness
7.
Thus, Lord, thy dreadful Attributes,
Man might have served to prove;
Thy Glorious Angels would have Sung
The Riches of thy Love:
Would thou have active Worshippers,
Besides the Angels Quire?
Millions had Issued at thy Word,
As Sparks arise from Fire.
8.
Man's Room had quickly been Supplied,
For, Lord, at thy Command
A New Creation should appear;
Thy Grace could make them stand:
Or would thou show thy pity, Lord?
Thou might have looked then
On Fallen Angels, Fallen Stars,
And not on Fallen Men.
9.
But fallen Angels must be left,
And Fallen Men must rise;
For this, the Son of God must Fall
A Bloody Sacrifice:
Thy Deep and Glorious Councels, Lord,
With Trembling I Adore;
Blessed, thrice blessed be my God,
Blessed for evermore.
XV. A Song of Praise for the Gospel.
1.
Blessed be my God that I was Born,
To hear the Joyful Sound;
That I was born to be Baptized,
And Bred on Holy Ground:
That I was Bred where God appears,
In Tokens of his Grace;
The Lines are Fallen unto me,
In a most pleasant place.
2.
I might have been a Pagan Bred,
Or else a Veiled Jew,
Or Cheated with an Alcoran
Among the Turkish Crew.
Dumb Pictures might have been my Books,
Dark Language my Devotion;
And so I might with blinded Eyes,
Have drunk a deadly Potion.
3.
So in a Dungeon dark as Night,
I might have Spent my days;
But thou have sent me Gospel Light,
To thine Eternal praise.
The Sun which rose up in the East,
And drove their Shades away;
His Healing Wings have reached the West,
And turned our Night to Day.
4.
England at first an Egypt was,
Since that proud Babels Slave;
At last a Canaan it became,
And then my Birth it gave.
Blessed be my God that I have slept
The dismal Night away;
Being kept in Providence's Womb,
To England's brightest Day.
5.
Blessed be my God for what I see,
My God for what I hear;
I hear such blessed News from Heaven,
Nor Earth nor Hell I fear.
I hear my Lord for me was born,
My Lord for Me did dye;
My Lord for Me did Rise again,
And did ascend on High.
6.
On High he stands to plead my Cause,
And will return again;
And set Me on a Glorious Throne,
That I with Him may Reign.
Glory to God the Father be,
Glory to God the Son;
Glory to God the Holy Ghost;
Glory to God Alone.
A Song of Praise for a Gospel Ministry
1.
FAir are the Feet which bring the News
Of Gladness unto Me;
What Happy Messengers are these
Which my blessed Eyes do see!
These are the Stars which God appoints
For Guides unto my Eyes;
To lead me unto Bethlem-Town,
Where my dear Savior Lies.
2.
These are my Gods Ambassadors,
By whom his Mind I know,
God's Angels in his lower Heaven,
God's Trumpeters below:
The Trumpet sounds, the Dead arise,
Which fell by Adam's Hand;
Again the Trumpet sounds, and they
Set forth for Canaans Land.
3.
The Servants speak, but thou, Lord, do
A hearing Ear bestow;
They smite the Rock, but thou, my God,
Do make the Waters flow:
They shoot the Arrow, but thy Hand
Does drive the Arrow home;
They call, but, Lord, thou do Compel,
And then thy Guests are come.
4.
Angels that fly, and Worms that creep,
Are both alike to Thee;
If thou make Worms thine Angels, (...)
They bring my God to me
As Sons of Thunder first they (...)
And I the Lightning fear,
But then they bring me to my Home,
And Sons of Comfort are.
5.
Lord, thou art in them of a Truth,
That I might never stray;
The Clouds and Pillars march before,
And show me Canaans way:
I bless my God, who is my Guide;
I sing in Sions ways;
When shall I sing on Sions Hill,
Thine Everlasting Praise?
XVII. A Song of Praise for Holy Baptism.
1.
LOrd, What is Man, that Lump of Sin,
Made up of Earth and Hell;
Not fit to come within the Camp
Where Holy Angels dwell?
Man is a Leper from the Womb,
An Ethiopian born,
A Traitor's Guilty Son and Heir,
Worthy of pain and scorn.
2.
And do thou ^ook on such a One?
Are not thine Eyes most pure?
(...) they are Eyes of Pity too,
Where (...) do beg a Cure.
This (...) Loathsome Sight,
But Pay casts an Eye,
And bids him wash in Jordan's Streams,
To Cure his Leprosy.
3.
This Ethiopian Skin is changed,
And made as white as Snow,
When dipped in wonder-working Streams,
Which from Christ's Side did flow:
As Adam slept, and from his Side
A Killing Eve arose;
From my pierced Lord (that smitten Rock)
A pure Life-Fountain flows.
4.
Ah what a Tainted wretch is Man!
And so he must have stood,
But lo! an Act of Sovereign Grace
Restores him to his Blood:
Save me, my God; for I am thine,
Lord, own thy Seal to me;
O wash my Soul till it be cleans'd,
And purified for Thee.
5.
Blessed above Streams is Jordan's Flood,
Which touches Canaans Shore.
I Will sing thy Praise in Jordan's Streams,
In Canaan evermore.
XVIII. A Song of Praise for the Lord's Supper.
1.
O Praise the Lord! praise him, praise him,
Sing Praises to his Name;
O all ye Saints of Heaven and Earth,
Extol and Laud the same;
Who spared not his only Son,
But gave Him for us all;
And made him drink the Cup of Wrath,
The Wormwood and the Gall.
2.
Frail Nature shrunk, and did request
That bitter Cup might pass;
But he must drink it off, and this
The Fathers Pleasure was:
Lo then I come to do thy Will,
His blessed Son replied;
Yielding Himself to God and Man,
He stretched his Arms and died.
3.
He Died indeed, but Rose again,
And did ascend on High;
That we poor Sinners lost and dead,
Might Live Eternally:
Good Lord, how many Souls in Hell,
Does Vengeance vex and tear;
Were it not for a Dying Christ,
Our Dwelling had been there.
4.
His Blood was shed instead of ours,
His Soul our Hell did bear;
He took our Sin, gave us Himself,
What an Exchange is here!
Whatever is not Hell it self,
For me it is too good:
But must we Eat the Flesh of Christ?
And must we Drink his Blood?
5.
His Flesh is Heavenly Food indeed,
His Blood is Drink Divine;
His Graces drop, like Honey falls,
His Comforts taste like Wine;
Sweet Christ, thou have refreshed our Souls,
With thine abundant Grace;
For which we magnify thy Name,
Longing to see thy Face.
6.
When shall our Souls mount up to Thee,
Most Holy, Just, and True,
To eat that Bread, and drink that Wine;
Which is for ever New?
XIX. A Song of Praise for the Lord's Day.
1.
MY Lord, my Love, was Crucified,
He all the pains did bear;
But in the Sweetness of his Rest,
He makes his Servants share:
How sweetly rest thy Saints above,
Which in thy Bosom lie?
Thy Church below, does Rest in hope
Of that Felicity.
2.
Thou, Lord, who daily feed'st thy Sheep,
Make them a weekly Feast;
Thy Flocks meet in their several Folds,
Upon this Day of Rest;
Welcome and dear unto my Soul,
Are these sweet Feasts of Love;
But what a Sabbath shall I keep,
When I shall Rest above!
3.
I bless thy wise and wondrous Love,
Which binds us to be free;
Which makes us leave our Earthly Snare,
That we may come to thee;
I come, I wait, I hear, I pray,
Thy Footsteps, Lord, I trace;
I sing to think this is the way
Unto my Saviors Face.
4.
These are my Preparation-days;
And when my Soul is Dressed,
^se Sabbaths shall deliver Me
(...) mine Eternal Rest.
XX. Another.
1.
Blessed Day of God, most calm, most bright,
The first and best of Days;
The Lab'rours Rest, the Saints Delight,
A day of Mirth and Praise:
My Saviors Face did make thee shine,
His rising did thee raise;
This made thee Heavenly and Divine,
Beyond the common Days.
2.
The First Fruits do a Blessing prove
To all the Sheaves behind,
And they that do a Sabbath love,
An happy Week shall find:
My Lord on Thee his Name did fix,
Which makes thee Rich and Gay;
Amidst his Golden Candlesticks,
My Savior walks this day.
3.
He walks in's Robes, his Face ^unes bright,
The Stars are in his Hand;
Out of his Mouth, that place of Might,
A Two-edged Sword does stand,
Graced with our Lord's Appearance the
As well as with his Name;
Thou may demand Respect from us,
Upon a double Claim.
4.
This day God does his Vessels broach;
His Conduits run with Wine;
He that loves not this days approach,
Scorns Heaven and Saviors shine:
What Slaves are those who Slavery choose,
And Garlic for their Feast;
Whilst Milk and Honey they refuse,
And the Almighty's Rest?
5.
This Market Day does Saints enrich,
And smiles upon them all,
It is their Pentecost, on which
The Holy Ghost does fall:
O Day of Wonders! Mercies pawn,
The weary Souls Recruit;
The Christians Goshen, Heavens Dawn,
The Bud of Endless Fruit,
6.
Oh could I love as I have loved,
Thy Watches heretofore;
As England's Glory thou have proved,
May thou be so yet more:
This day must I for God appear,
For, Lord, the day is thine;
O let me spend it in thy Fear!
Then shall the day be mine.
7.
Cease, Work and Play, throughout the day,
That I to God may rest;
Now let me Talk with God, and Walk
With God, and I am blessed.
XXI. A Song of Praise for the Patience of God.
1.
ALmighty God, how have thou born
Wrongs not to be expressed;
Daring Rebellion, Injured Love,
Light quenched in my Breast!
Man would be God, and down he fell,
To teach him better Skill;
Yet he lifts up his bruised Bones
Against his Maker still.
2.
Lord, what a Monster is base Man,
Thus given to Rebel!
O that thou do not cleave the Earth,
And send him quick to Hell!
His Sins for Wages loudly Cry,
Justice with dreadful sound
Cries too, Cut down this fruitless Tree,
Why cumbers it the Ground?
3.
But God waves his Advantages
Of Right and Vengeance too,
And by his single Patience,
Does daring Man outdo:
The Creature does disdain his God,
By whom he is Maintained;
Yet God Maintains this Rebel-worm,
By whom he is disdained.
4.
Fool, ask not where The Almighty is,
All Glory to Him give;
Is not his Power fully proved,
In suffering Thee to Live?
Was he not God, he could not bear,
Such Weights as on him lie;
VVeak things are quickly set on Fire,
And to their Weapons fly.
5.
Why should not Patience make me sing,
When Hell would make me roar?
Lord, let thy Patience end in Love,
I Will sing for evermore.
XXII. A Song of Praise for Pardon of Sin.
1.
MY God a God of Pardon is,
His Bosom gives me Ease;
I have not, do not please my God,
Yet Mercy Him does please:
My Sins aloud for Vengeance call,
But lo! a Fountain springs
From Christ's pierced Side, which louder cries,
And speaks better things.
2.
My sins have reached up to the Heavens,
But Mercies Height exceeds;
God's Mercy is above the Heavens,
Above my sinful deeds;
My sins are many, like the Stars,
Or sands upon the Shore;
But yet the Mercies of my God
Are infinitely more.
3.
My Sins in bigness do arise
Like Mountains Great and Tall;
But Mercy, like a mighty Sea,
Covers these Mountains all:
This is a Sea that is Bottomless,
A Sea without a Shore;
For where sin has abounded much,
Mercies abound much more.
4.
Manasseh, Paul and Magdalen,
Were Pardoned all by Thee;
I read it, and believe it, Lord,
For thou have pardoned Me:
When God shall search the World for sin,
What trembling will be there?
O Rocks and Mountains cover us,
Will be the Sinners Prayer.
5.
But the Lamb's wrath they need not fear,
Who once have felt his Love;
And they that walk with God below,
Shall dwell with God above:
Rage Earth and Hell, come Life, come Death,
Yet still my song shall be,
God was, and is, and will be good,
And merciful to Me.
XXIII. A Song of Praise for Peace of Conscience.
1.
MY God, my reconciled God,
Creator of my Peace,
Thee will I love, and praise and sing,
Till Life and Breath shall cease:
My Thoughts did rage, my Soul was tossed,
'Twas like a troubled Sea;
But what a Mighty Voice is this,
Which winds and waves obey!
2.
God spoke the word, Peace and be still,
My Sins, those Mutineers
With speed went off and took their flight,
Where now are all my fears?
The World can neither give nor take,
Nor yet can understand
That Peace of God, which Christ has brought,
And gives me with his Hand.
3.
This is my Savior's Legacy,
Confirmed by his Decease;
Ye shall have Trouble in the World,
In Me ye shall have Peace;
And so it is, the World does rage,
And Peace in me does Reign;
And whilst my God maintains the Fort,
Their Batt'ries are in vain.
4.
The Burning Bush was not consumed,
Whilst God remained there;
The Three, when Christ did make the Fourth,
Found Fire as weak as Air:
So is my Memory stufft with Sins,
Enough to make an Hell;
And yet my Conscience is not scorched,
For God in Me does dwell.
5.
Where God does dwell, sure Heaven is there,
And Singing there must be;
Since, Lord, thy Presence makes my Heaven,
Whom should I sing but Thee?
My God, my reconciled God,
Creator of my Peace;
Thee will I love, and praise, and sing,
Till Life and Breath shall cease.
XXIV. A Song of Praise for Joy in the H. Ghost.
1.
MY Soul does magnify the Lord,
My Spirit does rejoice
In God my Savior, and my God,
I hear his joyful Voice;
I need not go abroad for Joy,
Who have a feast at Home;
My Sighs are turned into Songs,
The Comforter is come.
2.
Down from above, the blessed Dove
Is come into my Breast;
To witness God's Eternal Love,
This is my Heavenly Feast:
This makes me Abba Father cry,
With Confidence of Soul;
It makes me cry, my Lord, my God,
And that without Control.
3.
There is a Stream, which Issues forth
From God's Eternal Throne,
And from the Lamb; a living Stream,
Clear as the Crystal Stone:
This Stream does water Paradise,
It makes the Angels sing,
One Cordial Drop revives my Heart,
Hence all my Joys do spring.
4.
Such Joys as are unspeakable,
And full of Glory too;
Such hidden Manna, hidden Pearls,
As worldings do not know:
Eye has not seen, nor Ear has heard,
From Fancy it is concealed;
What thou, Lord, have laid up for thine,
And have to me revealed.
5.
I see thy Face, I hear thy Voice,
I taste thy sweetest Love;
My Soul does leap; but O for wings,
The Wings of Noah's Dove!
Then should I Flee far hence away,
Leaving this world of sin;
Then should my Lord put forth his Hand,
And kindly take me in.
6.
Then should my Soul with Angels Feast
On Joys that always last;
Blessed be my God, the God of Joy,
Who gives me here a Taste.
XXV. A Song of Praise for Grace.
1.
O God of Grace, who have Restored
Thine Image unto Me,
Which by my Sins was quite defaced,
What shall I render Thee?
Thine Image and Inscription, Lord,
Upon my Heart I bear;
Thine own I render unto Thee,
O God, my God most dear.
2.
My self I owe Thee for my self,
Whom Thou did make of Earth;
But thou have made me over again,
Thou gav'st a Second Birth:
Twice born, and twice endu'd with Life,
I have to come to Thee,
To pay my Vows, my Thanks, my Heart,
With all Humility.
3.
O was I Born first from Beneath!
And then Born from above!
Am I a Child of Man and God?
O Rich and Endless Love!
When I had broke the Tables, Lord,
New Tables thou did Hew,
And with thy Finger did Engrave
Thy Laws on them anew.
4.
Earth is my Mother, Earth my Nurse,
And Earth must be my Tomb;
Yet God, the God of Heaven and Earth,
My Father is become:
Hell entered Me, and into Hell
I quickly should have Run;
But O! kind Heaven laid hold on Me,
Heaven is in Me begun.
5.
This Spark will rise into a Flame,
This Seed into a Tree;
My Songs shall rise, my Praises shall
Loud Hallelujahs be.
XXVI. A Song of Praise for Answer of Prayer.
1.
WHat are the Heavens, O God of Heaven!
Thou art more bright, more high;
What are bright Stars, and brighter Saints,
To thy bright Majesty!
You Are far above the Songs of Heaven,
Sung by the Holy Ones;
And do thou stoop and bow thine Ear
To a poor Sinners groans.
2.
God minds the Language of my Heart,
My Groans and Sighs he hears;
He has a Book for my Request,
A Bottle for my Tears:
But did not my dear Savior's Blood,
First wash away their Guilt;
My Sighs would prove but empty Air,
My Tears would all be spilt.
3.
Lord, thine Eternal Spirit was
My Advocate within;
But O! my Smoke joined with thy Flame,
My Prayer was mixed with Sin:
But then Christ was my Altar, and
My Advocate above;
His Blood did clear my Prayer, and gained
An Answer full of Love.
4.
It could not be that thou should hear
A Mortal sinful Worm;
But that my Prayers presented are
In a more glorious Form:
Christ's precious Hands took my Requests,
And turned my Dross to Gold;
His Blood put warmth into my Prayers,
Which were by Nature cold.
5.
Thou heard'st my Groans for Jesus sake,
Whom thou do hear always;
Lord, hear through that prevailing Name,
My Voice of Joy and Praise.
XXVII. A Song of Praise for Deliverance from Enemies.
1.
GReat God, who do the World command,
Thou check'st both winds and waves;
The Devils, which like Lions Roar,
Are thine Enchain'd Slaves:
The Sons of Rage are smoking Brands,
And Idols feared in vain;
Thou Lord, the only, only God,
Their Fury do restrain.
2.
Thou, Lord, did smooth fierce Esau's Brow,
And change his Murmuring Breath;
Thou gav'st to him a Brothers Heart,
Who vowed his Brothers Death:
Angels have Armed, at thy Command,
And Stars have shot their Dart;
Nature has fought, and Miracles
Have took thy Churches part.
3.
Thee, Lord, who still thy Church do love,
All Creatures must obey;
And when for Thine thou do arise,
Their Enemies, where are they?
I cried to Heaven in my Distress,
I to my God did flee;
He with Compassion heard my Cry,
He did Arise for Me.
4.
With humble Fear, and thankful Joy,
Lord, at thy Feet I fall,
Unfeignedly acknowledging,
That Thou alone do all.
Thou art all Power, thou art all Love,
And so thou art to Me;
Blessed be my God, now and henceforth,
And to Eternity.
XXVIII. A Song of Praise for Deliverance from Spiritual Troubles.
1.
I That am drawn out of the Depth,
Will sing upon the Shore;
I that in Hell's dark Suburbs lay,
Pure Mercy will adore:
The Terrors of the Living God,
My Soul did so affright;
I feared lest I should be condemned
To an Eternal Night.
2.
Kind was the Pity of my Friends,
But could not Ease my Smart;
Their Words indeed did reach my Case,
But could not reach my Heart:
Ah, then what was this World to Me,
To whom God's Word was dark!
Who in my Dungeon could not see
One Beam, or shining Spark.
3.
What then were all the Creatures Smiles,
When the Creator frowned?
My Days were Nights, my Life was Death,
My Being was my VVound:
Trtur'd and wracked with Hellish Fears,
When God the Blow should give;
^ne Eyes did fail, my Heart did sink,
Then Mercy bid me live.
4.
God's Furnace does in Sion stand,
But Sion's God sits by;
As the Refiner views his Gold
With an observant Eye:
God's Thoughts are high, his Love is wise,
His Wounds a Cure intend;
And though he does not always smile,
He loves unto the end.
5.
Thy Love is constant to its Line,
Though Clouds often come between;
O could my Faith but pierce these Clouds,
It might be always seen:
But I am weak, and forced to cry,
Take up my Soul to thee;
Then as thou ever art the same;
So shall I ever be.
6.
Then shall I ever, ever sing,
Whilst thou do ever shine;
I have thine own dear Pledge for this,
Lord, thou art ever mine.
XXIX. A Song of Praise for Deliverance from imminent Dangers of Death.
1.
LOrd of my Life, length of my Days,
Thy Hand has rescued me;
Who lying at the Gates of Death
Among the dead, was free.
My dearest Friends I had resigned
Unto their Makers Care;
Me thought I only time had lest
For a concluding Prayer.
2.
Me thoughts Death laid his Hand (...)
And did his Pris'n^^ (...)
And by the sound me ^^oughts I heard,
His Masters Feet behind:
Me thoughts I stood upon the Shore,
And nothing could I see,
But the Vast Ocean with my Eyes,
A Vast Eternity.
3.
Me thoughts I heard the Midnight Cry,
Behold the Bridegroom comes;
Me thoughts I was called to the Bar,
Where Souls receive their Dooms:
The World was at an End to me,
As if it all did Burn;
But lo! there came a Voice from Heaven,
Which ordered my Return.
4.
Lord, I returned at thy Command,
What will thou have me do?
O let me wholly live to Thee,
To whom my Life I owe!
Fain would I dedicate to Thee
The Remnant of my Days;
Lord, with my Life renew my Heart,
That both thy Name may praise.
XXX. A Song of Praise for the Hope of Glory.
1.
I Sojourn in a Vale of Tears,
Alas, how (...) sing!
My Harp does on the Willows hang,
Distun'd in every String:
My Music is a Captives Chains,
Harsh Sounds my Ears do fill;
How shall I sing sweet Sions Song,
On this side Sions Hill?
2.
Yet lo! I hear a Joyful Sound,
Surely I quickly come;
Each word much sweetness does distill,
Like a full Honeycomb:
And do thou come, my dearest Lord?
And do thou surely come?
And do thou surely quickly come?
Methinks I am at Home.
3.
Come then my dearest, dearest Lord,
My sweetest, surest Friend;
Come, for I loath these Kedar Tents,
Thy Fiery Chariots send:
What have I here? my Thoughts and Joys
Are all packed up and gone;
My Eager Soul would follow them,
To thine Eternal Throne.
4.
What have I in this Barren Land?
My Jesus is not here;
Mine Eyes will never be blessed until
My Jesus does appear:
My Jesus is gone up to Heaven,
To get a Place for me;
For it is his Will that where he is,
There should his Servants be.
5.
Canaan I view from Pisgahs Top,
Of Canaans Grapes I taste;
My Lord who sends unto me here,
Will send for me at last:
I have a God that changes not,
Why should I be perplexed?
My God that owns Me in this World,
Will own me in the next.
6.
Go fearless then, my Soul, with God,
Into another Room;
Thou who have walked with him here,
Go see thy God at Home:
View Death with a believing Eye,
It has an Angels Face;
And this kind Angel will prefer
Thee to an Angels place.
7.
The Grave is but a Fining-Pot
Unto believing Eyes;
For there the Flesh shall lose its dross,
And like the Sun shall rise;
The world, which I have known too well
Has mocked me with its Lies;
How gladly could I leave behind
Its vexing Vanities?
8.
My dearest Friends, they dwell above,
Them will I go to see;
And all my Friends in Christ below,
Will soon come after me:
Fear not the Trumps Earth rending Sound,
Dread not the Day of Doom;
For he that is to be thy Judge,
Thy Savior is become.
9.
Blessed be my God that gives me Light,
Who in the dark did grope;
Blessed be my God, the God of Love,
Who causes me to hope:
Here Is the words Signets, Comforts Staff,
And here is Graces Chain;
But these thy Pledges, Lord, I know
My Hopes are not in vain.
XXXI. A Song of Praise collected out of the Book of Psalms.
1.

Praise Him with one accord.
Praise him, praise him all ye that be
The Servants of the Lord.

Sing Praises to our King;
Praise to the King of all the Earth,
With Understanding sing.
2.

My Spirit shall do the same,
And all the Secrets of my Heart,
Praise ye his Holy Name.

Before him let us fall,
And kneel to him with one accord,
For he has made us all.
3.

For us he does provide;
We are his Flock, he does us feed;
His Sheep, he does us guide.

Because he has heard me,
And is become most lovingly
A Savior unto me.
4.

My Joy, my Mirth, my Song;
^s is become for me indeed
A Savior most strong.

And render Thanks to Thee;
Thou art my God, and I will praise
Thy Mercy toward Me.
5.

For gracious is He,
Because his Mercy does endure
For ever toward Me.
XXXII. Another.
1.

How great a cause have I!
My Voice, my Prayer, and my Complaint,
That heard so willingly?

O Lord, I sing to Thee;
Thou art my Fort, my Fence and Aid,
And Loving God to Me.
2.

But Thee in Heaven above?
And in the Earth there is nothing
Like Thee that I can love:

Does ever flow from Thee;
And in thy Light we are full sure
The lasting Light to see.
3.

This Hope is fixed fast;
The Lord God's good Grace shall I see,
In Life that ay shall last:

For evermore is He;
This God of ours even unto Death,
Our faithful Guide will be.
4.

In Righteousness thy Face;
And I shall be most like to Thee,
Even filled with thy Grace:

(A sweet and precious Store)
My God, at thy Right Hand there are
Pleasures for evermore.
5.

Praise Ye and bless the Lord,
Which to obey and do his Will
Immediately accord:

Praise ye his Holy Name;
My Heart, my Mind, and all my Soul,
For ever praise the same.
XXXIII. A Song of Praise Collected from the Doxologies in the Revelation of
St. John.
1.

And died to do us good;
And washed us from our scarlet sins,
In his own purest Blood.

His Father infinite;
To him Eternal Glory be,
And Everlasting Might.
2.

To have all Power and Wealth;
All Honor, Glory, Wisdom, Strength,
Thanks for his saving Health.

That on the Throne does sit;
And to the Lamb for ever, and
For ever, so be it.
3.

Which stand before their King,
With shining Robes, and spreading Palms
Loud Hallelujahs sing.

Who sits upon the Throne,
Thy Beams will make our Faces shine,
In Thee we will rejoice;
Thy Love is more to us than Wine,
Thou art the Uprights Choice.
5.
Ye Daughters of Jerusalem,
Though I am Black, yet Fair;
Like Kedars Tents, like Ornaments
Which Solomon's Bed does wear.
6.
Look not with a disdainful Eye
Upon my Sunburned Face;
My Mothers Children raged at me,
And wrought me much disgrace;
Such was their Envy, such their Grudge,
Their Vines must be inspected.
Whilst at their Vines I was their Drudge,
Mine own were quite neglected.
7.
But, O Thou whom my Soul does Love!
Tell me now from thy Breast,
Where feeds the Flock? where does it move?
Where is its Noon-Tyde Rest?
Why should I stray, and lose my way,
Till I at last do Fall
Among thy Fellows Flocks, as they
Themselves do proudly call?

Christ. 8.
O Fairest Fair! then go and Trace
The Footsteps of my Sheep,
And feed my Kids beside the Place
Where my good Shepherds keep.
9.
My Love, I have compared Thee
To those Egyptian Mares,
Which in King Pharaohs Chariots flee,
O Fairest of all Fairs!
10.
Thy Cheeks are comely to behold,
Which Rows of Jewels deck;
Large Chains of pure and shining Gold,
Adorn thy Royal Neck.
11.
I and my Father, we will make
Borders of Gold for Thee,
With Silver Studs for thy dear sake,
That thou may' st Richer be.

The Church. 12.
The King does at his Table sit,
And I that love Him well
Do pour my Spikenard on his Feet,
Which gives a Fragrant smell.
13.
My VVelbeloved is to Me
A Pomander of Myrrh;
Betwixt my Breast all Night shall He
Be Lodged and never stir.
14.
My VVelbeloved is to Me
Like Aromatic VVines;
Like Clusters of the Camphire Tree
Among Engeddi Vines.

Christ. 15.
Lo, thou art fair my only Love;
My Love, lo, thou art Fair;
Thou art my Love, thou art my Dove,
Doves Eyes in thee appear.

The Church. 16.
Nay, my Beloved, thou art Fair,
My Fairness is from Thee;
And thou art sweet beyond compare.
What a green Bed have we!
17.
The Beams are Cedars where we dwell,
So strong they will not stir;
The Rafters send a pleasant smell,
For they are made of Fir.

The Paraphrase. CHAP. I.
1.
Now will I sing of Christ the King,
And of his Church the Queen;
The Song of Songs to them belongs,
Where their pure Flames are seen.
[Dialogue.] The Church to Christ. 2.
LET my dear Saviors Love appear
By some assuring sign;
Thou, Lord, my sainting Soul do cheer,
When thou say, I am thine:
Let others on their Danties feed,
And drink the richest Wine;
My Feast do^^ all their Feasts exceed,
When thou say, I am thine.
3.
Thy Word which sounds thy mighty Fame,
And how good thou have been,
Does so revive, that for the same
Souls love Thee, though unseen;
Souls of an Heavenly make and frame,
The Joyful Heirs of Grace,
Do taste such Sweetness in thy Name,
They long to see thy Face.
4.
Fain would I, but I cannot move,
Sin has Enfeebled me;
O draw me with the Cords of Love!
I will run after Thee:
Thou hear'st, thou draw'st, I come, I come,
Thy Love (my God) is sweet;
Thy Presence Chamber is the Room
Where Souls and Joys do meet.
Our Earthly Pleasures we forget,
To think upon thy Love;
All upright Souls their Minds do set
On Thee, my Lord, above.
5.
Though I to Strangers black do seem,
And under Foot am trod,
Yet am I Fair in Heavens esteem,
I am the House of God.
6.
O do not scorn my outward state!
Ye know not what is within;
Whom God does love, how dare ye hate?
My Savior hides my Sin;
Professed Church Members should have brought
Some Comfort to my Mind;
But did they Treat me as they ought,
Alas! they proved unkind;
Their Anger did my words control,
They Bowed me to their Will:
And so my own immortal Soul
Declined and Fared ill.
7.
Pity my tempted state; O Lord!
Whom still I do adore;
O bring me home by thy good Word!
My Lapsed Soul Restore;
Since, Lord, thy Mercies still abides,
Shall I be lost among
False Flocks, false Doctrines, and false Guides,
Which do thine Honor wrong?

Christ. 8.
My Church, to Me the World is dross,
And thou a Pearl of Price;
And art thou Strayed and as a Loss?
Attend to my Advice:
Look back upon my Church of old,
And mark which way they went;
And let thy Childrens Eyes behold
The Pastors I have sent.
9.
As Pharaohs Horses ( Egypts Pride)
Is deemed the Choicest Breed;
So thou my Church, my Fairest Bride,
All Fair Ones does exceed.
10.
Man's Eyes the outward state behold,
Mine Eyes are on thy Heart.
Whilst other'S shine with Pearl and Gold,
Through Grace thou lovely art.
11.
My Soul that loves thee is so glad
Thy Stock of Grace to see,
I and my Father, we will add
A new supply to Thee.

The Church. 12.
My King does Sit in Heaven above,
Where Angels do attend;
And from below, my Faith and Love
Shall to my King ascend.
13.
My Faith ascends unto my Lord,
And brings him down to Me;
My Love a Bosom does afford,
Where he shall lodged be:
O the sweet time, as if I was
Reigning in Heaven above;
Whence once my Soul does Christ embrace
in Arms of Faith and Love!
14.
It is so sweet, when we do meet,
My Joys in Christ exceed,
The sweetest Smells, and Tastes, and Sighs,
Which can our Senses feed.

Christ 15.
My dearest Church, I do admire
The Beauties of thy Mind,
So Meek, so Harmless, so Entire,
So Faithful and so Kind.

The Church. 16.
My dearest Lord, thou art the Sun,
By whose bright Beams I shine;
And then my Glory first begun,
When thou becamest mine:
Since thou art mine, and I am thine,
A Numerous Race do flow
In every place, which to thy Grace,
Their Birth and Being owe.
17.
The dear Assemblies of thy Saints,
Where thou my Lord do dwell,
Are sweet and pure, and shall endure
Against the Gates of Hell.

I Am the Rose of Sharon-Field,
I am the Lilly White,
The Lilly, which the Valleys yield,
I am both sweet and bright.
2.
What are Thorns in the Account of Men,
Unto the Lilly bright?
What are the Fairest Daughters, when
My Love appears in sight?

The Church. 3.
What are the common Trees of the Wood
Unto the Apple Tree?
What is the Rich and Noblest Blood,
My lovely Lord, to Thee?
I sat Rejoicing in Times past
Under his cooling Shade;
His Fruit was sweet unto my Taste,
O what a Feast I made!
4.
Unto his Cellars stored with Wines,
He caused Me to remove,
Over my Head abroad he spread
The Banner of his Love.
5.
Give Flagons for a Cordial,
Bring Apples Me to cheer;
For I am sick, I faint, I fall,
I languish for my Dear.
6.
His Left Hand underneath my Head,
For my Support is placed;
His Right Hand over me is spread,
And thus I am Embraced.
7.
O Salems Daughters, you I charge,
Both by the Roe and Hind;
Ye do not move nor stir my Love,
Until it be his mind.
8.
My Welbeloved's Voice of Joy,
My Heart with Comfort fills;
He comes Leaping on Mountains high,
And Skipping on the Hills.
9.
My Welbeloved comes in have,
Like a swift footed Roe;
Nay, my Beloved flies so fast,
Young Heart did never so.
Behind our Wall, lo! he does stand,
He Is at our Windows seen;
He shows himself so near at Hand,
There Is but a Grate between.
10.
I gladly heard his gracious Tone,
Who thus to me did say,
Rise up, my Love, my Fairest One,
Make haste and come away.
11.
The Season of the Year invites,
The Winters gone and past;
Behold a Spring of new Delights!
No Rain, nor stormy Blast.
12.
The Flowers upon the Earth appear,
The Birds begin to sing;
The People of our Land do hear
The Turtles murmuring.
13.
Green Figs upon their Trees are grown,
Young Grapes their Smells display;
Rise up, my Love, my Fairest One,
Make haste and come away.
14.
O my Fair Dove, whose Fairness dwells
In dark Obscurity,
In cloven Rocks, and secret Cells,
Come, show thy self to me:
O let thy Face to me appear,
I (...) thy Voice answer mine,
Thy Voice is Music in mine Ear,
Thy Countenance does shine.
15.
Catch us the Foxes in a Toil,
The little Foxes catch;
For they our Fruitful Vines do spoil,
Their tender Grapes they snatch.
16.
My Welbeloved, he is mine,
And I am his indeed;
In Pastures, which with Lillies shine,
He makes his Flock to feed.
17.
Till the day break, and shades depart,
Beloved, have to me;
Even as the Roe and tender Heart
On Bether-Mountains flee.

SVch is the Power of my sweet Love,
My Church it sweetneth;
It sweetens Earth and Heaven above,
It sweetens Life and Death:
Such is the Beauty of my Face,
It Is with such Glories crowned,
That Solomon's Glory must give place,
To what shines me around;
As Lillies in the Valleys-grow,
So I the Valleys own:
The Humble are my Heaven below,
The Lowly are my Throne.
2.
No comely Persons can I see,
But whom my Grace adorns;
My Church a Lilly is to me,
And all the Rest are Thorns.

The Church. 3.
None but a Jesus, none but He!
He is the Chiefest Good;
My Jesus is an Apple Tree,
And others Barren Wood:
He is a Shadow from the Heat
Of Conscience, Wrath and Hell;
He is true Manna, Heavenly Meat,
Which feeds his Israel:
The Shadow of his Sacraments
Has been exceeding good;
Under that Shade a Feast I made
Upon his Flesh and Blood.
4.
My Christ is like a Cellar Stored
With sweet and precious Wine;
What Sweetness found I in my Lord,
When he said, I am thine!
As Soldiers to their Colors stand,
And after them do move;
So does my dearest Lord command,
And draw me by his Love.
5.
Nothing but Glory can suffice
The Appetite of Grace;
I long for Christ with Restless Eyes,
I languish for his Face.
O take me up, or let me Sup
On Promises Divine;
Those Apples from the Tree of Life,
Those Flagons full of Wine.
6.
How am I Born, whilst sick of Love,
In those blessed Hands of his?
His Left my Souls Support does prove,
His Right my Comfort is.
7.
And whilst his Love does me inflame,
Hear what a Charge I give,
All ye that own his Sacred Name,
Do not his Spirit grieve:
He is all Love, he is my Love,
O do not him abuse!
Do not again put him to pain,
Dear Christians, turn not Jews:
Lord, leave us not; yet if thou will,
With Tears we'll own thy Right;
But a Departure forced by Guilt,
Makes a Tempestuous Night.
8.
My dearest Saviors Voice I hear,
He comes on my account;
Nothing can stop his full Career,
No, not Corruptions Mount.
9.
My Lord makes have from Heaven to Earth,
And he himself presents,
To Men of a polluted Birth,
By Word and Sacraments:
Though, like a Wall, our frail Estate
Prevents a perfect Sight,
Yet through his Ordinances Grate,
Dart in some Beams of Light.
10.
My Lord to me did thus begin,
Arise, my Love, and flee
From World, Flesh, Satan, Self and Sin,
O come away to me!
11.
Time was when thou wast cold and dead,
An Heir of Wrath thou wast,
And Vengeance-Storms hung over thy Head,
But those sad Days are past.
12.
The Flowers of Grace begin to spring
In Thee so hopefully;
That all the Heavenly Quire does sing
Glory to God on High.
13.
My Church, thou art my tender Plant,
My Dews have nourished Thee;
Now thou art (...) mine, now thou must grant,
Thy Fruit, thy Self to Me.
14.
My heartless Dove, why do thou faint,
And hide thy self from me?
Thou know not how I love a Saint,
How welcome thou should be:
Come, come, before thy Lord appear,
Thy Person joys my Sight;
Let me thy Prayers and Praises hear,
Thy Voice is my Delight.
15.
Ye Men of God, whose Charge it is,
In God's Courts to attend;
Restrain those Enemies of his,
Which do his Church offend.
16.
Mine through my Faith is my dear Lord,
His through his Love am I;
He feeds his People with his Word,
Which tastes most pleasantly.
17.
He feeds them with his Word of Grace,
Till Glories Day appears;
Which all the Shades away shall chase,
Of Sins, and Griefs, and Fears:
Come Love, come Lord, come that long day,
My earnest Expectation;
Shovel these Days out of the way,
These Hills of Separation.

HIM whom my Soul does love, I sought
By Night upon my Bed,
I sought him, but I found him not,
My Souls Delight was fled.
2.
And slug I here? I Will now arise
And go about the Town;
I Will search the Streets and broader ways,
Until I find my own:
Up did I get, and out I went,
My Dearest to regain;
But when I had my Labor spent,
Alas! it was in vain.
3.
The City-watch did light on me,
Of whom I did enquire,
In any Street, pray, Did ye see,
The Man, whom I admire?
4.
'Twas but a little while that I
Had from the Watchmen passed,
But I did find my only Joy,
And then I held him fast;
I held, and would not let him go,
Till I had brought him home,
Into my Mothers House, and so
Into my Native Room.
5.
O Salems Daughters, you I charge
Both by the Roe and Hind;
Ye do not move, nor 'wake my Love,
Until it be his Mind.

What smoaky Pillar strait from hence
Out of that Desert Rises;

And all the Merchants Spices?

Such Ornaments his Bed do grace,
As Solomon's Bed commend;
Where threescore Men of Isreal's Race,
His valiant Guards attend.
8.
They all hold Swords courageously,
They all know how to Fight;
Each has his Sword upon his Thigh,
Because of Fear in the Night.
The Chariot of King Solomon,
Which for himself he made,
Was of the Wood of Lebanon,
Which Silver Pillars had.
10.
Gold was the bottom, and above
Rich Purple covered it;
The midst whereof was paved with Love,
For Salems Daughters Fit.
11.
Look, Virgins, on King Solomon,
His Crown so Rich, so Gay,
Wherewith his Mother Crown him on
His Joyful Marriage-day.

The Church. 1.
ONce did I seek my dearest Lord,
But with a sleepy Mind;
His presence he did not afford;
Slack Seekers cannot find.
2.
Shall I, said I; forgo my Christ,
And so close up mine Eyes?
No, no, he was so dearly mist,
I could not but arise.
My Bed was Thorus, no Bed for me,
Nothing could give me rest,
Till I my dearest Lord might see,
And can upon his Breast:
When private means could not prevail,
In public Him I sought;
I waited till my Eyes did fail,
Alas! I found him not.
3.
God's holy Watchmen did Me find,
Of whom I did enquire,
Pray, can ye help my troubled Mind,
Which does a Christ desire?
O happy Stars, if ye might be
My Guides to Jesus now!
Seers, did ye my Savior see?
Pray tell me where and how?
Means must be used, but cannot heal
Without a Sovereign Word;
Christ only can himself reveal;
And still I lacked my Lord.
4.
One dark Hour more I did sustain,
And then the Night was past;
Though I had sought so long in vain,
I found my Lord at last;
I found my Lord and held him fast,
And would not let him part;
My Newfound Jesus I embraced,
And Lodged Him in my Heart:
I would not lose my Christ again,
And gain a Second Hell;
My Prayers and Tears did him constrain
Within my Soul to dwell.
As Clouds are pierced with powerful light,
His Beams through me did shine;
His dear Assemblies saw this Sight,
And joy'd that Christ was mine.
5.
Christ's Love my Heart does so inflame,
This Charge I needs must give;
All ye that own his Sacred Name,
Do not his Spirit grieve:
He is all Love, he is my Love,
O do not him abuse!
Do not again put him to pain,
Dear Christians, turn not Jews:
Lord, leave us not; yet if thou will,
With Tears we'll own thy Right;
But a Departure forced by Guilt,
Makes a Tempestuous Night.

Weak Believers. 6.
What Heavenly Souls from Earth arise,
And do at Heaven aspire!
They mount, they soar, they fix their Eyes
On God their chief Desire:
Earths Wilderness they nobly scorn,
Whilst others Rake for it;
Heavens Graces them do so Adorn,
That they for Heaven are fit.

The Church. 7.
Admire not me, but my dear Lord,
Whose Bosom gives me rest;
Whose Angels watch with one accord,
That none should me molest.
8.
These Heavenly Guards are full of might,
And ready do they stand,
For to defend his Churches Right,
When he shall them command:
When Darkness breeds tormenting Fear,
Then help comes from on High;
A strengthing Angel does appear
Amidst that Agony.
9.
Heaven is the High and Glorious Throne,
Of my most Glorious Lord;
Who yet on Earth Rides up and down
In The Chariot of his Word.
10.
His Word is rich, and strong, and pure,
As all his Saints do prove;
Who of its true Intent are sure,
And find, it is Heart is Love.
11.
Go ye that own the Highest Name,
Behold a Glorious Show;
How the Almighty spreads his Fame;
And what his Word can do:
This mighty King Rides Conquering,
His Word goes forth with Might;
Which wooes and wins the Slaves of Sin,
Both by its Force and Light:
Those Slaves their Hellish Lords forsake,
And Christ do humbly own;
And as his Spouse, he them does take,
And wears them as his Crown:
Great was their Need; greater his Love
Than their Necessity.
As well they may, glad do they prove,
But not so glad as He.

LO, thou art Fair, my only Love,
My Love, lo! thou art Fair;
Thine Eyes are like those of the Dove,
Within thy Locks of Hair;
Thy Hairy Locks are like Goats Flocks,
Which from Mount Gilead look.
2.
So are thy Teeth like well-shorn Sheep;
Come from the Washing Brook;
They Pregnant are as well as Fair,
For Fruit as well as View;
For each of them her Twins does bear,
There Is ^ot one barren Ewe.
3.
Thy Lips are like a Scarlet-thread,
Thy Speech is sweet and fine;
Within thy Locks thy Temples Red,
Like broke Pomegranate shine.
4.
Thy Neck is like to David's Tower,
Strong built, and raised high;
A thousand Shields for Men of Power
Hang in that Armory.
5.
Thy two Breasts are like two young Roes
Well shaped and well agreed;
For they are loving Twins, and those
Among the Lillies feed.
6.
Until the Day have chased away
The Dusky Shades, I will
Betake me to the Mount of Myrrh,
And to the Incense-Hill.
7.
All over fair, my Love, thou art,
And so thou seem to me;
There is not one uncomly Part,
Not one dark Spot in Thee.
8.
Come, Love, with me from Lebanon,
From Lebanon, with me,
Since Thou and I are joined in One,
Thy Lebanon I Will be:
From Shenirs Top, from Hermon book,
And from Amana high,
Those Lions Dens must be forsook,
And where the Leoparc's lie.
9.
My Spouse, my Sister, thou have Gained
A perfect Victory
Over my Heart by thy bright chain,
And by thy Brighter Eye.
10.
How fair and pleasant is thy Love,
My dearest spause to Me!
O how I prize it far above
The Richest wines that be!
O how my Sisters Ointments smell,
What sweetness do they yield!
This pleasant scent does far Excel
The sweet Arabian Field.
11.
Thy Lips drop like the Honey comb,
There Milk with Honey Flows;
I smell the smel^s of Lebanon, from
The Garments of my Spouse.
12.
My Sister and my Spouse is Veiled,
That she may be supposed;
A Spring shut up, a Fountain sealed,
A Garden well enclosed.
13.
Thou have a pleasant Nursery,
Where sweet Pomegranates grow,
And Fruits which please both Taste and Eye,
Thereto the Spices flow.
14.
As Camphire, Spikenard, Calamus,
Saffron and Cynamon,
Myrrh, Aloes and Incense Trees.
With each Spice of Renown.
15.
A Garden Fountain is my Love,
A Living Well is She;
Like Lebanons Streams which swiftly move,
And down to Jordan flee.

The Church. 16.
Am I a Garden? Then, O North,
Awake, and on it Breath;
Thy quickening Breath will summon forth
The Odours from Beneath:
Am I a Garden? Then, O South,
Come, on this Garden blow!
One Sovereign Blast out of thy Mouth,
will make its Spices flow:
Then, then, into his Paradise,
Let my Beloved come;
And eat his Fruits, and get his Spice,
And count himself at home.

Mr Dearest Church, I do admire
The Beauties of thy Mind,
So Meek, so Harmless, so Entire,
So Loyal and so Kind:
Even thy Profession I esteem,
Because it springs from Grace,
Which makes Thee yet more comely seem,
As Hair adorns the Face.
2.
Thy Pastors which prepare thy Food,
Do in their Minds agree;
Their Lives and Doctrines both are good,
And bring much Fruit to me.
3.
Thy Speech so seasoned is with Grace,
That many Hearts it moves;
And Graces color in thy Face,
Its great Advantage proves.
4.
Thy Faith which joins thee to thy Head,
Does shield thine inward parts;
This Shield has often extinguished
The Devil's Fiery Darts.
5.
The two Breasts of thy Testaments
Most friendly do accord;
Which Nourishment and sweet content
To new Born Babes afford.
The Cries of a Distressed Soul,
These Breasts of Comfort still;
These Breasts make glad, whom Sin makes sad,
These Breasts the Hungry Fill.
6.
The Word is here the Churches Fare,
And Faith the Churches Light,
Till Shades give way to Glories Day,
Then shall she live by Sight:
Meanwhile my Gracious Presence shall
Her dear Assemblies fill;
Her Prayers shall be most sweet to me,
Sweet as the Incense-Hill:
Meanwhile my Glorious Presence shall
Fill Heaven, that Holy Ground,
Where Cherubims and Seraphims
Their Hallelujahs sound.
7.
My dearest Church, how clear art thou,
On whom no sin remains!
My Blood applied has purified
Thee from thy Guilts and stains:
Thou art to me as white as Snow,
And though thou finnest still,
Grace keeps thee in, thou can not sin
With full consent of Will.
8.
Let my Fair Glories thee entice
To come along with me;
Forsake thine Earthly Paradise,
Thy Paradise I Will be;
Birth, Pleasures, Riches, Friends and Fame,
Are all summed up in Me.
O that thou knew'st how good I am!
Come now and taste and see:
The World's an howling Wilderness,
Filled with the Beasts of Prey;
Whilst that they Rage, Roar, and Oppress,
On Canaan fix thine Eye.
9.
My Heaven-born Spouse, whom I embrace,
My Joy and Crown thou art;
Thine Eye of Faith, thy Chain of Grace
Have overcome my Heart.
10.
My Dearest Spouse of Heavenly Birth,
Thy Love is more to Me
Than all the Pleasures of the Earth,
And sweet thy Graces be.
11.
Thy Speeches in thy Heart are bred,
And sweetly do they flow;
Thy works do such a savor spread,
As Lebanons Spices do.
12.
Disguised to the World thou go,
Heaven in a Mystery;
To me thou Run'st, to me thou Flow'st,
None knows thy worth but I:
As thou art mine, so I am thine,
My Love does guard thy Heart;
Thy Heart's with me, my Love's with thee,
My Church, how safe thou art!
13, 14.
My Church thou art a Paradise,
Where Fruits and Spices grow;
Fair are thy Fruits, and from thy Spice
Thy sweetest Odours flow:
Thy tender Plants thy Children are,
Their Graces Fruits and Spice;
I am the Tree of Life in Thee,
My Church, my Paradise.
15.
Thou art a Spring, which to thy Plants
D^st thy pure Streams derive;
Under thine Eye and Ministry
Thy Blessed Assemblies thrive.

The Church. 16.
My Lord, if I a Garden am,
Then let thy Spirit blow;
And with its Gales refresh the same,
And make my Graces flow:
And when thy Spirit thus has blown,
And I do flourish most,
Then let my Dearest Lord come down,
And feed upon his Cost.
So poor I am, so great thou art,
The Lord, how can I Feast?
Furnish the Table of my Heart,
Then come and be my Guest.

I AM come into a Paradise,
My Sister and my Spouse;
I Have gathered of my Myrrh and Spice,
Which in my Garden grows.
My Honey Comb and Honey too
Have been my sweet Repast;
My Wine, my Milk which here do flow,
Have cheered my Heart and Taste:
My Friends and dear Companions,
Come, Feast your selves with Me;
Drink, O my Welbeloved Ones,
Yea, Drink abundantly.

The Church. 2.
I sleep, but yet my Heart does wake,
Hark, my Beloved One
Does Knock and Call. I cannot mistake
His Knock, his Tread, his Tone:
Open to Me, my Fathers Child,
Open to Me, my Love;
Open to me, my Undefiled,
Open to me, my Dove:
Open to me, that wait for Thee,
My Head is filled with Dew;
And all my Locks with Evening Drops,
Let Us have an Enterview.
3.
My Coat is off, and how shall I
Put on my Coat again?
Should I come over the Dusty Floor,
My washed Feet to stain?
4.
My Dearest then by the keyhole
His willing Hand did move;
Which when I did perceive, my Soul
Was touched with Grief and Love.
5.
Rowz'd by this Passion, I did stir,
And answered to his Call;
My Hands and Fingers dropped with Myrrh,
Which from the Lock did fall.
6.
Then did I open to my Dear,
But he (alas!) was gone;
He whom I did so lately hear,
Methoughts I was undone:
I sought him whom my Soul adored,
But him I could not have,
I called and cried, my Love, my Lord!
But He no answer gave.
7.
Then did the cruel City-VVatch
Smite Me, and wound Me sore;
The Keepers of the Wall did snatch
Away the Veil I wore.
8.
O Daughters of Jerusalem!
I charge You, if Ye find
My Glorious Dear, that he may hear
My Love afflicts my Mind.

The Daughters of Jerusalem. 9.
What Jewel is this Dear of thine,
O Fairest, let us know;
Wherein does thine Others outshine,
That thou do charge us so?

The Church. 10.
My dear Delight is Red and White,
The Lilly and the Rose;
So sweet a Grace adorns his Face,
Ten thousand he out-goes.
11.
His Head is like the Finest Gold,
And curled Locks does wear,
Which do the Ravens Color hold,
So comely is his Hair.
12.
His Eyes are like the Eyes of Doves,
Which on the Banks are met,
And do the streams of Water love,
Milk-washt and fitly set.
13.
His Cheeks are like a spicy Bed,
Where all Perfumes do meet;
His Lips like Lillies, whence is shed
The Myrrh that smells so sweet.
14.
His Hands are like the Chrysolite
In Rings of Gold displayed,
His Belly is like Ivory bright,
With Sapphires overlaid.
15.
His Legs like Marble Pillars are
On Golden Sockets set;
His Face, like Lebanon, is most Fair,
Like Cedars most complete.
His Mouth is most exceeding Sweet,
Yea, he is wholly so;
Down from his Head unto his Feet,
With Sweetness he does flow:
O Salems Daughters, This is He
Of whom ye did enquire;
This is the Friend that loves Me,
This is my Hearts desire.

MY Love, (my Dearest) has Me brought
Whither thou did Invite;
Thy Graces which my Hand has wrought,
Have been my Souls delight:
Thou art a Vine, which with thy Wine,
Both God and Man do cheer;
Feed on the Fruits prepared in Thee,
A constant Feast is there.

The Church. 2.
Such drowsiness does me possess,
I live, and yet I die;
Some Life I have, no Liveliness,
How dark and cold am I!
Here in the dark and deep I grope,
Who used to live above;
Where is my Faith? Where is my Hope?
Where is my wonted Love?
It is no Strangers Voice I hear,
I know it is my Lords.
He knocks both at my Heart and Ear,
These are his loving words,
Open to Me, my Fathers Child,
Open to Me, my Love,
Open to Me, my Undefiled,
Open to Me, my Dove.
My Gracious Patience has stood
Long waiting at thy Door;
Fain would I enter for thy good;
Slight not thy Savior.
3.
One would have thought such melting words
Should break an heart of Steel
But I (Alas!) so stupid was,
Their Force I did not feel:
My Answer was to this Effect,
Lord, now I am at ease;
And Lord, if I should Thee respect,
My Friends I should displease:
Thy Service, Lord, would cost me dear,
The World would me molest;
Thy heavy Cross how can I bear?
Do not disturb my Rest.
4.
My Lord to this made no Reply,
Only on Me he cast
A sad and a Rebuking Eye,
On which this sense I passed;
Do thou my Patience thus requite,
To make it longer bear?
Do all my Love and Sufferings slight?
I looked for better Fare;
This stirred my Love, my Grief and shame,
Which put me to such pain.
5.
That I resolved, whatever came,
To own my Christ again,
Accursed Temptations, be ye gone,
And do not me restrain;
Satan Avaunt, let Me alone,
I Will have my Christ again:
This Resolution gave some Ease
To my distressed Mind;
My Griefs did then begin to cease,
When I to Christ inclined.
6.
But when I did my self address,
My Savior to embrace;
Alas! for my Unworthiness
My Savior hid his Face:
For He is Great as well as Good,
And will not be disdained;
Then his kind words, which I withstood,
My Conscience sorely pained:
O then I wished a thousand times
That I had been so wise
To shake off my Security,
When Christ bade Me arise:
I sought him daily in his Word,
But him I could not have;
I called and cried, My Love, my Lord!
But he no Answer gave.
7.
Earth did oppress whom Heaven forsook,
Nothing but Griefs I found,
For they who to my Soul should look,
My Soul did pierce and wound:
Their words and deeds did both conspire,
To grieve my grieved heart;
Their Scorns and Jears were Swords and Spears,
Which did increase my Smart.
But still my greatest wound was here,
My Lord I could not find;
Had I my Lord, I should not care,
Though others proved unkind.
8.
Another Course I straightways took,
I did repair to those
Who Sion wards do often look,
And did my Case propose:
Blessed Souls said I who often attend
At the Almighties Court,
My Case to you I do commend,
That you may it report:
A Lord I have or rather had,
My VVelbeloved one;
His Presence used to make me glad,
But, Ah, my Lord is gone!
If when you pray, he should acquaint
You with his Love and Grace;
Tell him from me, my Heart does faint
And Languish for his Face.
9.
Who is, said they, this Lord of thine?
O Fairest, let us know;
Wherein does thine others outshine,
That thou do Charge us so?
10.
My dearest Lord is White and Red;
White through his Purity,
Red through his Blood which he did shed
For such an one as I:
Was he not Red, but only White,
The Lilly, not the Rose;
He might delight the Angels Sight,
But I am none of those:
Was he not White but only Red,
A Sufferer for his sin;
His Blood would rest upon his head,
Nor could I Joy therein:
But my dear Lord is White and Red,
This Mixture pleases me;
For, for my sins he suffered,
When he from sin was free:
What a reviving sight is this?
A righteous Savior's Blood;
The Bath of Sin, the Spring of Bliss,
Most pure, most sweet and good:
The fond enchanted World admires
Their Idols here below;
Their creeping, grovelling, poor Desires
Their Childish Minds do show:
Did but my Glorious Lord appear,
O did they him but know,
What formerly their Glories were,
Would be no longer so:
The lesser Lights all disappear,
When once my Sun does shine;
And though Ten Thousand Lords were here,
None could be like to mine:
My Lord, he is the King of Kings,
The Fairest of all Fairs;
Of all your fine and boasted things,
None with my Lord compares.
What Is your thick Clay? Your stones bring forth
Which ye your Jewels call;
My Lord, he is of real worth,
And goes beyond them all.
11.
His Godhead and his Government
Are infinitely pure,
Most Glorious and most Excellent,
And ever shall endure.
12.
His is a pure and piercing Eye,
Through all the Earth it moves;
Which the dark Hypocrite does spy,
And secret good approves.
13.
His Cheeks appear most bright and clear,
When he himself does show;
Methinks I in a Garden walk,
Where Flowers and Spices grow:
When he does my affections stir,
And speaks unto my Mind;
Methinks the Lillies drop with Myrrh,
Such Savor do I find:
So sweet a Grace adorns his Face,
His Face, like Heaven does shine;
And O what Music do I hear,
When he says, I am thine!
14.
His Hands are like to Rings of Gold,
The works of my dear Lord
Are bright and comely to behold,
His Works fulfill his Word.
The Tender Bowels of his Love,
How precious they be!
When I am Grieved, his Bowels move,
And loudly plead for me.
15.
The sweet Proceedings of my Lord
Are like his Purposes;
Holy and Pure, and Firm and sure,
Both Love and Stedfastness:
His Countenance Majestical
All Reverence does Command;
If he but Frowns on us, we fall,
But if he Smiles, we stand.
16.
His Mouth is most exceeding sweet,
All sweetness like an Hive,
One word of his like Honey is,
O how it does revive!
As I begun should I go on
My Dearest Lord to Limn,
You Would say, all sweets compacte^^^
And summed up in him.
My Lord is Larger than Desires,
Fairer than Words can show;
One comely part fond Earth admires,
My Lord is wholly so.
O Heaven-born Souls, This, This is he
Of whom ye did enquire;
This is the Friend that Loves me,
This is my Hearts Desire:

FAirest of Fairs, if thus it be,
O whither is he gone?
Tell us, that we may seek with thee
This thy Beloved One.

Down to his Garden he is gone,
Where Beds of Spices are,
That he may Feed and Feast thereon,
And Gather Lillies there.

I am my VVelbeloved ones,
My VVelbeloved's mine;
He Feeds and Treads in pleasant Meads,
Where the bright Lillies shine.

My Love, like Tirzah, thou art Neat,
And like Jerusalem,
And like an Army so Complete,
Men fly for Fear of them.
5.
O turn away thine Eyes from me,
Thy bright and sparkling Eyes,
To bear so great Felicity,
My strength does not suffice;
Thy Hairy Locks are like Goats Flocks
Which from Mount Gilead look.
6.
So are thy Teeth like Well shorn sheep,
Come from the VVashing-brook,
They Pregnant are as well as Fair,
For Fruit as well as View;
For each of them her Twins does bear,
There Is not one barren Ewe.
7.
As broke Pomegranate seems Red,
And shines exceeding clear,
So do the temples of thy Head,
Within thy Locks appear.
8.
Thrice twenty Queens together stand,
And fourscore Concubines;
And Virgins like the numerous sand,
Which to the Sea adjoyns.
9.
My spotless Dove, she is but one,
The Darling of her Mother,
Who loves and prizes her alone,
She knows not such another:
The Daughters saw her comely Lines,
And praised her Lovely Face;
Yea, all the Queens and Concubines
Admired her Beauteous Grace.
10.
What Morn looks forth? what Moon is there?
What Sun may yonder be?
Fierce Troops with Flags displayed appear,
O what a One is She!
11.
To the Nut-Garden down I went
To see the Fruits below;
Whether the Vines their Grapes did vent,
And the Pomegranates grow.
12.
My Soul gave me a sudden twitch
And made me nimbly slide,
Like those swift Chariots, in which
Amminadib did Ride.
13.
Return, Return, O Shulamite.
Return, Return Apace
That we may look with much delight
Upon thy Glorious Face:
What in the Shulamite I pray,
Do ye expect to see?
Two Armies set in good Array
Even such a one is she.

WHilst thus my dearest Lord I praised,
As I could do no less;
They heard, they looked, they stood amazed
At my great happiness:
And when I ceased they thus replied,
O Fairest we must needs
Congratulate thy Blessed Estate,
Which ours so far exceeds:
O that we were in such a Case
As we perceive thou art;
O that our Souls might find a place
In thy Beloved's Heart:
Whither is thy Beloved gone?
Pray, let us go with thee,
To seek thy Well beloved One,
Whose Face we fain would see.
2.
If you my dearest Lord would see,
Then go unto his Court,
Look where his Saints Assembled be,
Thither you must Resort:
For they his Pleasure-Gardens are,
Where he delights to be;
They are his Comfort and his Care,
There you my Lord may see:
Some Souls he breeds, and some he feeds,
Others he does remove;
Hence for his lower Gardens to
His Paradise above.

I am my Well-beloved ones,
My Well-beloved's mine;
To me his Love a Feast does prove,
Beyond the Richest Wine.

My dearest Church, on whom I see
A Fair and Royal Stamp;
All sweetness joined with Majesty,
Thou art both court and camp.
5.
Thy Prayers are arms, thy Praises charms,
Thy Love is like a Dart;
Thy Faith and Graces are so strong,
They overcome my Heart:
Thy Fair Profession I esteem,
Because it springs from Grace,
Which makes thee yet more comely seem,
As Hair adorns the Face.
6.
Thy Pastors which prepare thy Food,
Do in their Minds agree,
Their Lives and Doctrines both are good,
And bring much Fruit to me.
7.
Thy countenance so shines with Grace,
That many Hearts it moves;
And Grace's color in thy Face,
Its great Advantage proves.
8.
The World presents its glorious Shows,
But what are those to me?
In my dear Church, my only Spouse,
All Glories do I see.

Earths Pride would soon confounded be,
Should but my Spouse appear,
Who to her mother and to me
Is so exceeding dear.
Her Noble Birth and Real Worth,
Have gained her so much Fame,
The greatest Princes of the Earth
Have praised her worthy Name.
10.
Her Sweetness joined with Majesty,
Her Presence much Endeared;
Her Power with her Purity
Made her both loved and feared.
11.
I have been with my new born Saints,
I have been down to see
What Buds were on my tender Plants,
What hopes of Fruit for me.
12.
When my dear Church, I hid my Face,
Thou did thy self bemoan;
I did but prove thy Faithful Love,
When thou thought I was gone:
My Bowels yearn'd when thou did Cry,
My Love did me constrain;
To haste apace, and show my Face
To thy grieved Soul again.
13.
Return, Return my dearest Church,
Return, Return to me;

Thy Blessed Face to see:

My Churches State and Case;
She is another Host below,
And of an awful Grace.

With Liquor does abound;
Thy Belly's like an Heap of Wheat,
Which Lillies do surround.

Thy two Breasts are like two young Roes,
Well Shaped and well agreed,
Both which are Loving Twins, and those
Among the Lillies Feed.
4.
Thy Neck, like I vory is most Fair,
And like a Tower most straight;
Thine Eyes like beshbon pools, which are
Hard by Bath-Rabim Gate:
Thy Nose is like to Lebanons Tower,
The Tower which does Command
Damascus-Town, the Chiefest Flower
Of all the Syrian Land.

So sweetly Graced in every part;
Thou art my whole delight.

Whether the Vine does grow:
Whether the tender Grapes appear,
And the Pomegranates thrive,

O Daughter of the Mighty God,
How comely are thy Feet?
With Gospel-preparation Shod!

Great Numbers thou do Breed,
Which with good Meals, the Word and Seals,
Thou liberally do feed,

The two Breasts of thy Testaments
Most friendly do accord;
Which Nourishment and sweet content
To Newborn Babes afford:
The cries of a distressed Soul,
These Breasts of comfort still;
These Breasts make glad whom sin makes sad,
These Breasts the Hungry ^ill.

Thy Faith is thy strong Fort and Tower,
Thine Understanding clear;
Thy Judging and Discerning Power
Informs when Danger's near:
Thy Christ, thy Head of Eminence

When thine Assemblies Exercise
Their Graces freely given,
The King walks in those Galleries,
As in another Heaven.

How Dear art thou and Sweet;
In whom all Sweets compacted are,

The greater is thy growth:
The Breasts of thy two Testaments,
Like Clusters of the Vines;
Are full of Juice, which for thy use
Tield store of Heavenly Wine.
8.
When I perceived thy Soul to thrive,
Like to a Fruitful Tree;
Then I drew near, that I might cheer,
And joy my self in thee,
Nor did I empty-handed come,
But added to thy Store;
God's Word came then more near and home,
Thy Graces scented more.

So lovely and so strong;

And sanctifies his Tongue.

Of days and means of Grace:
Could I but see thy Children Spring,
And in an happy frame;
O how should I rejoice and sing,

Makes a Tempestuous Night.

Thy absence makes it Sick.
Should thou but seemingly disdain
My Heart so deep Engaged,
I should be Tortured with such pain
As could not be asswag'd.
O Love Me, Lord, or else I die!
Thee, Lord, my Love does crave!

My Love would be my Grave.
My Love does flame my Jealousy,
So burns my Heart and Eyes.
I must embrace my Lord, or I
Must be Loves Sacrifice.

Whole Seas of Trouble cannot quench
Loves everlasting Fire:
Though Hell oppose, whom I have chose,

My care and my Delight;

And watch it every Night:
Dressed by my Hand, watched by my Eye,
Its Fruit to me abounds;
The Praise of its Fertility
Wholly to me redounds.

My Dearest Church, who art composed
Of diverse companies;
Now we have both our Minds disclosed,
I Will end with this Advice:
As all thy Members give an Ear
Unto thy Gracious Strain;
So let Me often from thee hear,
Until we Meet again.

Ah my dear Savior! pity Me,
Preserve Me in thy Heart;
And Oh make have, make have, that we
May Meet and never part.

DIVES AND LAZARUS.
IN Judah's Vale a Man of Wealth abode,
Vile as a Beast, yet Worshipped as a God;
Who Tyrian Clothes, and Egypts Linnen-ware,
And on whose Table met Land, Sea and Air.
Beneath the Threshold of his Out-most Gate
A pale, deformed, horrid Carcass Sat:
Another Job. But of more Fixed Woes,
Who from his Dunghill never once arose.
The Eng. of Lazur^s.
God Help Me was his Name. God was his all,
Those few that knew him, Lazarus him did call.
Need, Pain and Scorn at once did on him lie;
His Bed was Earth, his Covering was the Sky:
Nothing had he to pay of Natures Scores;
Empty he was of Bread, but full of Sores.
Hunger (that Wrack) will make a Man confess,
What modest Minds endeavor to oppress:
Sharp Hunger whets the Wit, and mends its strain,
It hurts the Bowels, but it helps the Brain.
A Servant passed the Gate, where, lo! he found
This Ruful Odject grovelling on the Ground.
Said Lazarus, Sir, if Pity be my due,
Give to your Master what I give to you.
Lazarus his Petition.
MOst Noble Sir, I humbly crave
What Nature does exact from Me;
I am a Borderer on the Grave,
Half slain with sharp Necessity.
For Childrens Bread I do not Call;
I do not Ask you Servants Fare;
Only the Sweepings of your Hall
I Beg; and what your Dogs may spare.
Doom Me not, Sir, to perish at your Gate,
Who may Preserve Me, at so Cheap a Rate;
For Father Judah's sake some Fragments give,
I Will serve You at God's Altars whilst I live.
Dives his Answer.
WHat Dog is this that dares Presume on Me?
Accursed be all such Crawling Toads as He;
Pests of my Gate, Vermin that Creep so Nigh
-- I Hate'em; Let Him Rot and Die.
In vain the poor Man's thoughts pursued his Suit;
The Dogs were humane, but their Lord a Brute;
They left their Snarling to their Masters Face;
They Ran, and Lazarus gently did embrace.
He was the pitied Patient of those Hounds,
Whose lambent Tongues did cool his burning wounds.
This done, the squalid Vassals of the Times
Scorned ragged Virtue, Honored purple Crimes:
Things are mis-judged by the purblind Eye,
Which views their Posture, not their tendency:
Till Justice 'wakes to right its injured Laws,
Which does not weigh the Person, but the Cause.
Nor Rags, nor Sores, are Clouds that can disguise
A splendid Soul to Heavens Soul-searching Eyes;
Earths Laz'rus was Heavens Dives; Earths disdain
Was a meet Guest for Heaven to entertain:
Now comes the Golden Hour that sets him free
From his Apprenticeship to misery:
His Corpse (the Graves old Neighbor) long Uddrest,
At length is slip into its Bed of Rest:
A Treasure it is, though Funeral-costs it wants;
The Richest Mineral is the Dust of Saints;
He was his own (most serious) Mourner here;
He Mourned enough; He needs no Hired Tear.
The time is come, that Lazarus must be clad
With such fine Linen, Dives never had:
The time is come, that Lazarus must be Fed
With Heavens rich Juices, and with Angels Bread.
There is a Table richly Spread above,
There is an Everlasting Feast of Love;
A Feast which Friends and Friendship does mantain,
Pale Envy is not there, nor proud disdain;
They all are One; In One they all agree,
One is there all, which makes all one to be;
Here Is Height of Mirth, with Depth of Seriousness,
Plenty without the Hazard of Excess;
Here are full Joys in Hand, full Joys in View,
Here Wine and Appetite are ever new:
Ever begins their Feast and n're do end,
Whom growing Loaves and Living Springs attend;
Their Harps are well-strung Hearts, well-tuned
And Sacred Hallelujahs are their Songs; (Tongues)
Here sit the Saints, Here the Believers Sire,
Is Nobly Seated in his Rich Attire;
Hither the King of Heaven new Guests does call,
Nor can he come too late that comes at all.
The mighty One who dwells and rules on High,
Angels attend with an obedient Eye:
The Secrets of his Breasts they do not Skill,
But are the trusty Servants of his Will.
Thus charged he them, ' Bring Lazarus to the Feast,
'And let him take his Place next Abraham's Breast.
They heard with Reverence, and obeyed their King,
Joy raised their Hearts, and nimbly shook their Wing.
They fled from Heaven, yet Heaven was with them still,
It was their Heaven to do their Masters Will.
They stopped not at the Stars (that pompous show)
Who went to view a Brighter Star below:
The Point designed they well did understand,
Who had old Voyagers been to Canaans Land.
There they had been Lots Guests (who was their
There had they been Elisha's flaming Guard. (Ward)
In that Land chiefly lay their Lords Affairs (Wares)
They traffiqu'd there for Souls (those precious
Soon came they where Sick Lazarus had his Lare,
They stopped and waited for their Passenger.
No visitant found they with him, but the Lord;
No Nurse, but Faith; no Cordial, but the Word.
They heard him praying, 'Lord, some Mercy Show,
'For I can find no mercy here below.
This said, he sighed, and was of Life bereaved;
He gave his Soul, and they his Soul received,
With Shouts and Songs triumphant up they went,
And to the Company did him present;
They shouted all, and joy'd the New come Guest,
How gently stoops and leans on Abraham's Breast^
Whom Dives Cursed and stately Fools disdained,
How is he Blessed! how is he Entertained!
Though Virtue here on Earth neglected lies,
Yet Heaven will raise it, for it is born to rise.
Dives, that silken God, must never dye
Unless his Creatures and false Prophets lie.
He Is safe, if Death be cast as far behind
His Body, as it is below his Mind.
He Is always young; He learns it from his Glass,
Which smooths his furrowed Brow and paints his face.
But a Cold striking hand consutes the Lie.
Down falls his Flattering Glass, his Fancies dye;
His Garden-walks must him no longer know,
The Life-tree in his Garden does not grow:
His Palace must be changed for a dark Tomb,
That was his Inn, but this must be his Home;
He must no longer at his Table stay,
The Voider (Death) is come to take away:
Death, that abhorred (both Name and,) thing comes on*
And potently torments this Potent One;
It makes Amazing Breaches, and in short,
Has seized the Outworks, and attacks the Fort:
In what a wretched Posture does he lie!
He cannot live, and yet he dares not dye.
His Debt must be distrain'd; for he will not pay,
Nor yield his Ghost; it must be fetched away;
He sprunts, he struggles, but Death keeps him under,
And with one stroke tears Flesh and Soul asunder;
Then rang the House with his five Brethrens Cries,
Alas! our Brother; so they closed his Eyes.
His outward parts are washed, his inner Rooms
Stuffed with Arabian Sweets and rich Perfumes.
Now Death his Purple is, now he is allowed
Fine Linen too, but it is a Funeral Shroud;
Grave-fac'd Spectators with their Garments torn,
And Shrouded Lips attend, the Room does mourn.
Ah what a poor Revenge is this on Fate!
For him that cannot live, to Lie in State.
Amidst the Gazing Crowd the Bearers come,
With Pomp they bring him to his painted Tomb.
Minstrels and Trumpeters their Noises join,
And Women sell false Tears for Current Coin.
Now lest his Friends should in salt streams be drowned
The Cup of Consolation goes its Round.
But stay, my Soul; it is Death that thou must view,
Not shadows which dead Bodies do Ensue.
What a dark Notion and Abstrusity,
Is this to living Men, that they must die!
Grim Death on his pale Horse Triumphant Rides,
He strikes us through our nearest Kinsmans Sides:
Yet are we senseless, as the stupid Mule,
Live as Exceptions from the Common Rule;
We cast a Cloth over Death; it is soon forgot,
We charm the Serpent, and it stings us not.
Now might one let this pleasant Error pass,
If Death was all, but Death his Second has,
When once the Dissolution Hour is come,
Out goes the Soul to hear her Final Doom.
You who have slightly heard the Funeral Knell,
Now hear the Voice which dooms the Ghost to Hell,
For those whose hearts an Earthquake will not shake,
Through Heavens Loud-roaring Cannons may awake.
Dives black Ghost (all Horror and Despair)
Is from its Prison snatched to the dismal Bar;
Behind him the impatient Devils roar.
His Sins (those worst of Devils) stand before;
With Terrors thus besieged in every place,
He hears a Voice, but might not see the Face.
The Voice was roaring Thunder in his Ears,
The words were tearing Bolts and flaming Spears;
" Go thou accursed, vile Caitif, hence away
" To damned Ghosts, Come Devils, take your prey.
Struck with this Thunder, down he sunk, he fell,
And was a Triumph to the Fiends of Hell.
The ingenious Tyrants did a Council pack,
Their Malice set their Wits upon the Wrack:
When they had jointly studied to Torment,
For their pale Prisoner then in haste they sent;
They chained and staked him to a furious Flame,
Where constant streams of Brimstone feed the ^ame,
Behold Sins Martyr, and Hells Sacrifice!
He yells and howls, and vents unpitied Cries.
He finds no Friendly Ear, or tender Eye,
He feells a thousand deaths, but cannot die:
Like burning Brass he is Fired in every part,
A Vultur lives upon his living Heart.
God's gone, he is gone, and what an Hell is this,
To be deprived of everlasting Bliss!
O this Eternal Banishment is worse
Than all the Remnant of the Doomsday Curse.
This Hell of Hell may thus be understood,
No torments are so bad as God is good.
Besides, an Appetite in Man does lie,
Which nothing but a God can satisfy;
And though this Appetite be here deluded
By various Objects, in God's room obtruded.
Yet when at death all these are laid aside,
Then thirsts the Soul for God, but is denied;
This Thirst unquench'd is such an inward Flame,
An Hell in Hell is its deserved Name;
In Hell there cannot be an Atheist,
It Is Hell in Hell that God is dearly mist.
Poor Dives cries, The God for whom I starve,
" I cannot see, because I would not serve,
" I Bleed to think, (and thinking is my Fate)
" He often knocked at my Bolted Gate.
" Where are those Baits on which my Lusts did prey,
" The Price of which I cast my self away?
" Where Is now my Pomp and Pride, my Feasts and Sports,
" Whose Chains detained me from the Sacred Courts?
" O did my House so near the Temple stand,
" O did I perish out of Judahs Land!
" Might I be tried once more! But it is too late,
" Justice has locked the Golden Mercy-Gate:
" Now I believe, and tremble: I repent,
" But my Repentance is my Punishment:
" It is not Virtue, but Necessity;
" Alas, how miserable wise am I?
" Might I return now to that happy Night,
" Which veiled me er'e my Parents saw the Light,
" Ah me! must I lie here! and never come out,
He raves and flings his curses round about.
He cursed both Heaven and Hell, he cursed the Earth,
He cursed the Day that witnessed to his Birth:
But neither can his tears his Griefs assuage,
Nor does it cool his Heart to vent his Rage.
This Keen Reflection makes the Furnace Glow.
" It must be ever with me as it is now.
" Hells Flames no Ashes will produce: But I
" Must ever Dying Live, and Living Die.
" Souls for themselves the Balm of Patience bear,
" It Is the Poors Physic, but it grows not here;
" My Soul is filled with Homebred tears and taunts,
" It Is its own Fury, and it self it haunts:
" Pity was wont in Miseries House to dwell,
" But I am haled by the Hounds of hell.
" Time used to be a Surgeon good at wounds,
" But I am got beyond its happy Bounds.
" A Vessel charged with scalding wrath am I
" Hoop'd in the Circle of Eternity.
You who affect the pleasant Path to Hell,
And love Damnation in its Causes well,
Look straight before you on your Journeys End,
Do ye not see the infernal smoke ascend?
Have not some sparks into your Bosoms Flown,
Wh'reby the Neighboring Coasts may well be known.
Bold sinner, stop, no further progress make,
Lest your next step be in the Fiery Lake;
But, Oh! He ridicules his souls affairs,
And labors to be damned at unawares.
His Humor will not bear a Countermand,
Alas for them who hate to understand!
Who on their souls Experiments will try,
At the Charge of a sad Eternity.
Alas for them who never will awake,
Till they are plunged into the burning Lake!
Dives was hear struck blind with flattering Lies,
Now the Hell brand lifts up his flaming Eyes;
He spies the Region where the happy dwell,
But Heaven at distance is another Hell:
He spies a Canaans Feast, for chiefly there,
The Natives of his Country do appear;
He spies Blessed Abraham with his faithful Race,
And Lazarus sitting next to Abraham's place.
Oh! how it twinges and torments his Eyes?
His scorn to Envy turns, and thus he cries,
" This Scoundrel who lay Starving at my Gate,
" Is now a Peer in Heaven, an Angels Mate;
" The Beggar sits and feeds on Angels Fare,
" His Rags are Robes, such as Heavens Nobles wear:
" The Dog, whom in derision once I had,
" Is turned into a Star, which makes me Mad.
Now Dives is the Beggar, and applies
Himself to Abraham with his Mournful Cries.
Dives his Petition.
AH Father Abraham, Pity me,
Who with tormenting Flames am Stung,
For pity whither should I Flee
But to the Bowels whence I Sprung?
The Grapes Rich Blood I do not Crave,
waters Cheap Element will Suffice;
And though my Tongue thirsts for a vvave,
For one poor drop it only Cries.
By Lazarus ^^oist'ned Finger may you please
To give my scorched tongue one Moments Ease.
I dwell in Flames, and Flames in Me do dwell,
O for a Drop from Heaven to sweeten Hell.
Mark how the Wheel is turned, the time is come,
He begs a Drop who once denied a Crumb.
Right-thinking Judges then must needs approve.
The tart and equal Answer from above.
Abraham's Answer.
ARt thou forlorn of God, and come to me?
What can I tell thee then but Misery?
Remember, Son, the Heaven thy Feet have trod,
Earth was thy Heaven, and Pleasure was thy God.
Remember Lazarus had his Hell below,
Thou were the Devil which did cause his woe;
Now are his rags Heavens robes with glorious Beams,
Thy Purple, Flames, thy Juncats, Sulphrous Streams.
Is he thy Wish who was thy Scorn before?
Shall Lazarus now be welcome to thy door?
And do imagine some fair Bridge to lie,
Betwixt the White and Black-Eternity?
No there is a mighty Gulf which rends in twain,
The Fiery Region and the Aetherial Plain.
We are too happy to be dispossessed,
And you so cursed you can never be blessed;
We are so raised, that we can never fall,
And you so sunk, you cannot rise at all.
Once Angels went from Heaven to Hell; but first
They blackned were to Devils, and accursed;
Since those Stars fell none of the heavenly hosts,
Or did or shall visit the infernal Coasts.
To yon it is bitter, but to us it is sweet,
That we are parted and must never meet;
Heaven were not Heaven, if it near Hell was placed,
Nor Hell were Hell, if it of Heaven might taste.
Can our pure Light with Smoke and Darkness dwell?
The Poles shall sooner meet than Heaven and Hell.
Though Speech avails not, wracking misery
Extorts from him another fruitless Cry.
Dives his Second Petition.
IF such an Envious Gulf there be,
Yet, Father, lend an Ear to me:
From Earth to Heaven a way is Paved;
How else came Lazarus to be Saved?
Let me so small a Boon entreat,
That Lazarus may his Steps Repeat,
And that he may embodied go,
And tell the Stories of my Woe.
To my Five Brethen, who all dwell within
My Fathers House (Oh had he never been!)
Brethren in Bonds of Nature and of Sin.
O let him tell them that there is a God,
Whose Scepter is a Sin-revenging Rod;
And let him tell them that advent^rous Dr^lls,
Shall find unto their Costs that they have Souls.
Mine stuckt'th' Scabbard, till its angry Lord
Vnsheath'd it, and it proved a flaming Sword:
That Limbeck, Death, draws Spirits from our Clay,
To the Element of Souls they have away;
And let him tell them, that the Sadducee
Shall be Hells Convert, and Recant with me.
Whilst they lie Sleeping on the Brink of Hell,
The Smoke they fee not, nor the Brimstone smell:
There they will disport themselves with Golden Dreams,
Till they betray 'em to these burning streams:
But let him scare them with an hollow sound,
That they (like Lot) may flee their cursed Ground:
O send him quickly lest they tumble in,
And prove the flaming Records of my sin:
Can I no water get at my desire;
Yet, O, no more, no more, new Fleaks of Fire.
This Abraham heard with unrelenting Ears,
No pity's due to Hell Hounds Cries and Tears.
Abraham's Answer.
ONnce Heaven bowed down and touch'dth' Arabian Hill,
And gave a Sampler of the sacred Will
To Moses Hands, that chosen Man of God,
Copies were taken and dispersed abroad.
(So his kind Arms abroad the River flings,
So the free Sun extends his fruitful Wings;
As this most Sacred Light it self displays,
And Guilds the Tents of Jacob with its rays.)
For Saints to come from God there is no cause,
Himself came down and did promulge his Laws:
Needs Lazarus take a Journey from the Sky,
When wisdom at your Brethrens Gates does cry,
Let them hear Moses read by their Divines,
^'th' Synagogue to which their house adjoyns;
And let them hear the reverend Prophets next,
Those wondrous Commentators on the Text.
Dives his Reply.
MOses ('it is true) was an Unerring Guide,
So were those sixteen Prophets on his side:
This I as much believe, as if I saw
The flaming Mount, and heard the Fiery Law,
When every word was accented with Thunder,
Which Rent those Oaks, the Jewish hearts asunder.
It Is here as necessary to believe,
As it is Natural to feel and grieve:
I that am now a proof of sacred Writ,
Do argue backwards with my After-wit:
Hell in the threatenings though I did not see,
The threatenings are in Hell made plain to me.
I skowl'd upon the Heavens when they did Lowre,
The Clouds I feared not, but I feel the Shower.
Nothing will move my Brethren but a Sign,
Experience is the powerfulest Divine:
Faith is the Child of sense, whereas Report
Is entertained with Blasphemy or Sport.
They have a Sword to cut the Gordian Knot,
Moses says many things, but proves them not.
And though they hear substantial Proofs there be,
Nothing is Proof to them but what they see.
Had they an Emissary from above,
The very Sight a future state would prove:
Might he but tell them of your Heavenly Strand,
They Would all turn Pilgrims for that Holy Land;
Or might he preach the torments which I feel,
His words would (...) like burning Gads of steel;
His words would tear down all, like thundering Guns,
Beyond the faint Attempts of Levi's Sons.
O were I of this cursed Chain Released!
(With that he gnash'd his teeth and knocked his breast:)
Might I be to the Earth a Preacher sent,
I Would burn up sin like Stubble where I went;
I Would smoke away their Lusts and flattering Lies,
Or forth I Would drive them with my Glaring Eyes:
I Would blow a Trumpet which should Rend the Ground,
Their trembling Heart Strings should in Consort sound:
I Would teach the faithless Sadduces their Creed,
And make the Pharisees to pray indeed:
I Would tell the Ranters such a doleful Tale,
That they should mourn as in Megiddons Vale:
I Would unbewitch the sots and slaves of sin,
That such a Reformation should begin;
As in Josiah's time did not befall,
And the next Age should Canonize 'em all.
Abraham's Rejoinder.
A Preaching Apparition would confound
Heaven daring Giants with its dreadful found,
(None quake so soon as they who Heaven do dare,
Who fear not God, the greatest Cowards are:
But were the coast once clear, the shake once over,
The Lees would settle as they did before.
" It was a waking Dream they would conclude,
" A Juggle which our Senses did delude:
" Or did we something see? And something hear?
" Yet whence it came, it does not yet appear.
Nay, they would gravely reason out the Case,
" What we can grasp, we gladly will embrace:
" The rest we leave; to them let Children hark.
" And fright themselves with Fancies in the dark.
" What is a Spirit? What Is Infinity?
" What does the word [Eternal] signify?
Charmed are their Souls with this Oration made,
And now their fear shall vanish like the shade:
Thus Fools (though pounded) will not lose a Grain,
And Frozen snakes, when thawed, will hiss again.
Come now thou that Pretend'st to act the Man,
Something there needs must be, which never began;
If all were nothing once, so 'twould be now,
A Number from bare Ciphers could not grow:
Nothing's a Barren Womb; if that could breed,
To be and not to be were well agreed:
One Point is gained, that something ever was;
This hard word, Ever, you must let it pass:
Know thou how far this Ever does extend?
You must grant what you cannot Comprehend.
But what was Ever? This Imperial Robe,
Suits not the Azure nor the Verdant Globe:
One is a turning Wheel, that Spins out time,
The other Pools with spots of hardened slime.
Now mark the kinds of each, and you shall find,
Unto their proper Spears they are Confined:
Hereby is their Original Confessed,
There Is but a partial Goodness in the best:
This is the Voice of their Infirmity,
" Mere Beggars and Derivatives are we:
What Is of it self, that does its self suffice,
It Is from our Creatureship our wants arise:
What Is of it self, than in it self is Blessed,
It Is its own Center and at perfect rest;
Rich is that Being whence all Beings are,
And whence each Being has its proper share.
Nor is it a wonder of so high degree,
To make to be, as of it self to be;
Something then ever was, which needs must be,
From all the shades of Imperfections free.
Hence are we; and to think, in vain we are,
Is to condemn his Wisdom at our Bar.
As Men the Badge of their dependence wear
On their frail Flesh (the Graves probationer)
And on their hearts, whose restless Motions show
Something they want, which is not here below;
So must they own whom they are forced to know,
And pay themselves to whom themselves they Owe:
Neither would this their Light of comfort Dim,
But they should serve themselves in serving him.
When Graves upbraid proud Grave-stones with their Lies,
God's Servant is a Title nevers dies.
The thoughts in Man do prove his Soul to be;
His Conscience bodes his immortality:
This Bosom Magistrate his Facts espies
And binds him over to the last Assize:
He trembles at his Summons to appear;
His fear makes not a God, God makes his Fear,
Religion by Corroding does assay
Even through an Heart of Rock to force its way.
O might he to himself be so sincere,
To strive to please whom he is constrained to fear.
Yet will he be a Vagrant all his days,
Without a Method to direct his ways.
What Eye e're pierced the Almighties Sacred Breast?
Himself knows only what will please him best.
Since Man was made to serve his Makers will,
Which is an height transcending humane skill,
A Rule must needs be granted from on High
For him to regulate his Actions by:
This Heaven-sprung Rule that S^cred Roll contains,
Which in the Consecrated Land remains.
Its words and mysteries are all Divine,
And weighty Mountains Hang on every Line;
It (Sun like) Shines by its own Golden Beams,
And scorns its base Corrivals senseless Dreams:
Those Spangles which the Heathen Sages Left
Were from this Mine snatched by an Honest Theft.
Give me that hardy Brow, that dares deny
The Bible well attested History:
Moses said many things, and proved them too
With proofs which all Hells Magic did outdo;
God's power he carried in his Hands, to show,
That from his Mouth the Truths of God did flow:
And his Credentials on his Face did shine,
Which there were written by a Beam Divine.
The gazing Jews were struck, who plainly saw
That whence he had his Light, he had his Law.
Those Sections which the Sacred Code begin*
Were by an Age of wonders Ushered in.
The Prophets superstructure firmly stands
On two hewn Stones laid by the Almighties Hands:
They count the footsteps of their coming Lord,
They view the Mercy-seat with one accord.
One tells his Name, another tells his place;
Another writes the Beauties of his Face.
Thus is he Glanced at by their piercing Eyes;
The last of them his Harbinger espies:
And O the Brisk, the Charming Airs that Spring
From the consent of each Harmonious string!
He Is overwise who dreads Fictitious ^ines
From Hands unbrib'd, and Hearts without designs.
They wrote beyond themselves, which serves to prove,
Their hearts and hands were guided from above
The Worlds just Age, and what was done of old
Are in this Sacred Register enrolled.
Here may be seen the pristin state of Man,
And, that Niles Head, the Source where ills began.
Here may be seen what makes a second Spring;
Here is the ^est account of every thing.
The Wonders witnessed now by mortal Eyes,
Are but the products of its Prophecies.
The Scriptures rule the World: Till this shall burn,
All Ages on that Axle-Tree shall turn.
This Heaven-inspired Volume does avow
What reason may embrace, or must allow.
When God describes himself, it is such an height,
As far surmounts quick fancies highest Flight.
It Is Reason, Reason should be puzzled here;
Man should be God if he knew what he were.
To these vast heights thus sober Reason says,
I see the Seals: And yields the Chair to Faith.
Now the Almighties Word shall Vermin slight,
When Heaven and Earth bear witness to its Might.
Vast Numbers from his Word at first did flow,
And must his Word pass for a Cipher now?
Nay, his Commands at first Creations were,
And now his Word Commands; and give an Ear,
It is a Sun that gives both Light and Eyes,
A Voice that bids and makes the dead arise:
It makes Clouds, Stars; And sends them to the Sky;
And turns Heaven unto a Colony.
Unbelief is not Reason but a Lust;
God's Hand and Sword gives it its mortal thrust.
^he Law of the Two Tables will prevail,
When other (self-invented) means shall fail.
Whilst other Archers Level in the Dark.
The Arrows from Gods Quiver hit the Mark.
What Voices or what Visions would you have?
Gods Voice (or nothing) will your Brethren save:
New Methods of Salvation to contrive
Is fruitless Labor: Let 'em hear and Live;
But if they will not, their Mittimus is Sealed;
A stubborn Patient never can be healed.
If Preachers raised by God they will disdain;
Preachers raised from the Grave should preach in vain.
