A NEW NARRATIVE OF THE OLD PLOT. A SONG:
To the Tune of Russels Farewell.
I.
WHen Traitors did at Popery rail,
because it taught Confession,
When Bankrupts bawled for Property,
and Bastards for Succession:
When Tony durst espouse the Cause,
spite of his Pox and Gout,
When speaking Williams purged the House
by spewing Members out.
II.
When Hunt a Twifort Pamplet wrote,
the Emblem of his Soul,
When Oats swore whom he pleased in's Plot
and reigned without control:
When L -- -- ce Lampoon'd the Court,
and Libel'd Cats and Dogs,
When Witnesses like Mushrooms sprung,
out of the Irish Boggs.
III.
Then Perkin thought 'twas time to prove,
his claim to Kingship Fair,
And says it is fit the Peoples Son,
should be the Peoples Heir:
So filled with Zeal he and his Knight,
Carress'd and Court the Rout,
And my Lord Duke goes up and down,
to show his Grace about.
IV.
Though F -- d Lord G -- y would not engage,
upon that idle score,
For he would have a Commonwealth,
as well as Common Whore:
He envied his Old Friend a Crown,
but why I cannot devise,
For's Grace had graced his Lordships head,
with Horns of Noble size.
V.
Likewise his Patron Zeal grew high,
the Exclusion to advance,
And the Right Heir must be debarred,
for fear of Rome and France:
The Zeelous Commons then resolved,
and they knew what they did,
By whomsoever King should fall,
the Papists Throats should bleed.
VI.
So murdering Poniards often are slipped,
into a Guiltless Hand;
And Innocence is sacrificed,
whilst Malefactors stand;
By Hells assistance then they framed
their damned Association,
And worthy Men, and Men worthy,
divided all the Nation.
VII.
Fools often and Mad Men leave the less,
and choose the greater Evil,
Thus for fear of POPERY,
run headlong to the Devil:
At last these Loyal Souls propose,
to ease their Sovereigns Cares,
If he will sit down and first remove
their Jealousies and Fears.
VIII.
Just the Old trick and sham-Device,
of Beelzebub their Sire,
If he will fall down and Worship them,
they will grant his hearts desire;
Nay, Lives and Fortunes then shall be
entirely all his own,
If he will fairly once disclaim
his Brother and a Crown.
