A New SONG on the Arrival of PRINCE GEORGE, And His Intermarriage with the
LADY ANN.
To the Tune of, Old Jemmy.
I.
PRince GEORGE at last is come,
Fill every man his Bumper;
For the Valiant DANE make room,
Confusion to each Rumper.
And every prodigal starched Fool
Aspires unto a Crown,
By hopes of Plotting Knaves to Rule,
Who next would pull him down.
II.
Preserve Great CHARLES our King,
And His Illustrious BROTHER,
Whilst Whigs in Halter^ swing.
And hang up one another:
The joyful Bridegroom and the Bride,
Prince GEORGE of Royal Race,
Of all the Swains the Joy and Pride,
The subject of their Lays.
III.
Brave GEORGE He is a Lad
With all Perfections shining;
With every Virtue clad,
And every Grace refining:
But oh! of such a warlike Race,
So Conquering are His Charms,
No Mars in Field, but must give place
To His Victorious Arms.
IV.
Brave GEORGE, Great Denmark's Son
(A stout and warlike Nation)
By Birth to ENGLAND's Crown
A near and dear Relation;
But now the Knot is doubly tied,
Which makes Him still more near,
The Knot which Knaves would have destroyed,
By cutting off the Heir.
V.
But now the Tribe's dispersed,
Their Projects are defeated,
Which Walcot and the rest
Did hope to have completed:
And now they will pay for all their scores,
Who for that Interest stood,
And let 'em hang for Sons of Whores,
Who thirst for ROYAL BLOOD.
VI.
Poor Perkin! where is the hope
Of all thy high promoting?
No^, Bully Tom* a Rope
Must crown thy Cheats and Plotting:
Let Ferguson with Gray escape,
They safe are ev'ry-where,
If Murder, Treason, Lust and Rape
Can pass unpunished here.
VII.
Let M -- th for a Crown,
That hopeful Prince so Loyal,
Away with Rebels run,
To raise an Army Royal:
Brave George for England scorns to fly,
Old Jemmy stout as He,
Their Plots and Malice we defy,
And all their Treachery.
VIII.
Nay Heaven, which Him did raise
Of The Protestant Profession,
In His Immortal Race
Maintain the just Succession,
that no pretending Bastard bold,
In time to come, may dare
His lawless Title to uphold,
Against the lawful Heir.
Printed by Nath. Thompson, at the Entrance into the Old-Spring-Garden, 1683.
