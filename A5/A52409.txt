FAMILY-GOVERNORS Persuaded to Family-Godliness: OR, The Masters Charge opened,
and humbly offered, etc.
MY dearly beloved and longed for, That I may present yours perfect in Christ,
and persuade you to be not only almost, but altogether Christians among them,
is the only design of this Paper.

Being made of God a Watchman to you, necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe is to
me, if I do not give, and woe is to you, if you will not receive the warning at
his mouth, [ Ezekiel. 3.17, ^d 21. 1 Cor. 9.16.] I beseech you therefore,
Brethren, suffer the Word of Exhortation: And (...) there be any sense of sin,
any zeal for your Savior, any fellowship of the Spirit, any fellow-feeling
with the Saints, Let the glory of the great God, the Gospel of his Grace, the
good of Immortal Souls, both their and yours, awaken your uttermost Cares,
Kindnesses, and Compassions, and whatsoever is of God in your hearts, to the
advancement of godliness in your houses; That the Tabernacle of God may be with
you, and we may yet see Jerusalem a quiet habitation.

With how many clear Commands is this your duty enforced? [Reade Deuteronomy. 4.9, 10.
Chapter 6.7, 8 9. Chapter 11.19.20. Psalm. 78.5, 6.] And with how great a Cloud of
Witnesses are you encompassed? [See the after-mentioned] What shall I say? This
Paper would fail me to tell you of Gideon, and Jacob, and Joseph, of Elkanah,
Job also, and Samuel, and of the Prophets, [ Judge. 6.26, 27. Genesis 35 2. Chapter
43.23. with v. 16. 1 Samuel 1.21. Job. 1.5. 1 Samuel 7.17. 2 Kings 5.25, 26.] If
Examples before, under, or since the Law, and in the Gospel; if of great Kings,
General Commanders, holy Patriarchs or noble Peers; if of Civil Officers of
Military Officers, or of Church Officers; if of Magistrates, or of meaner Men
and Women; if any, or all of these may persuade any thing: Lo (...) you have
all these to induce and encourage you [ Psalm. 101.2, etc. Josh. 24.15. Genesis
18.19. Chapter 35.2, etc. Joh. 4.53. Luke 19.9. Acts 10.2. 1 Timothy 3.4, 12 Acts
18.8. Chapter 16.15, 34.]

Beloved, may I expostulate it a little with you, for and before the Lord?

Are you Christians? You have all a form of Christ, and Christ is verily formed
in many of you. O you that have received Christ the King into your hearts, can
you refuse the Kingdom of Christ, in and for your Households? What! Converted
your selves, and have Christ to dwell in you, and yet careless of having Christ
to dwell in yours! How can this be? [ Luke 19.5 6. Chapter 22.32.] What Christian
Master can you instance in, of the Household of Faith, who continued negligent
of making his Household faithful? [See Luke 19.9. Joh. 4.53. Acts 10.2. and
12.12. and 16 15, 34. and 18.8. Romans 16.5 1 Cor. 1.11. and 16 16, 19. Col.
4.15. Philem. v. 2.]

Are you Christians? What! and is your care no further extended, than to the
backs and bellies of yours, or bettering them in their Trades, etc? Do not even
the Gentiles the same? Are you no better than they? [ Matthew. 6.8, 32.] Nay,
they will teach theirs the worship of their false gods, which are no gods. Owe
not you, Christians, much more to the living God, than Heathens can to their
dead Idols? Need I mention the debt you owe to the house of Christ, and to the
house of the Kingdom? Are we serious, and in earnest for a Reformation in
Church and Commonwealth? Let us throw Salt into the Fountain, set upon the
Reformation of our several Families. Private Houses are the Hives and
Seminaries of all that are set, or swarm abroad into any Publick^ whether Civil
or Church-Employments.

Are you Christians? Oh! let the Example and Activity of the Jews under the Old
Testament, provoke you. [See the forecited Scriputures, Judge. 9.6, etc. and
Psalm. 101, etc.] We^^ they so abundant in labors herein, before the
manifestation of Christ in the flesh? and ca^ you abide slothful under higher
Motives, greate^ Means, and a better Ministration? Who have more Promises to
encourage, and pourings ou^ of the Spirit to enable? What! and dar^ such of
you yet profess, That Christ is yours and that you are his? Beloved, is Christ
no^ become less active in his? Christianity more abhorrent from him? or may the
care and co^^science of Christians be more abandoned, bot^ as for him and their
own? Is grace indeed now less diffusive? Are the gracious to be less dil^gent?
or are the heavenly glories of less dignity, and the happiness and good of
yours to be less desired?

Oh Christians! Do even the Sea Monster draw out the breast? they give suck to
their young ones; and shall Saints by Calling and Covenant, become cruel to the
better part of theirs, like the Ostriches in the Wilderness? Oh! where are the
yernings of your bowels! Hear you not the Souls of your Servants, and of the
seed of your loins (in effect) crying after you, Have pity upon us! have pity
upon us! The whole Head is sick, the whole Heart is faint: Where! O where are
your healing Medicines! Will you do no more for us, than for your Horse, your
Dog, your Swine? You look after the Bodies of these.

Beloved, for your own happiness sake, for your Households sake, I beseech you
be up and doing.

First, for your own happiness sake. Earthly happiness shall I mention? Verily,
there is no such way of having yours dutiful to, and observant of you, as for
you to teach them their duty to, and the service of God. [ Genesis 24.33, ad 50.
Prove. 15.20. Genesis 27.11, 12.] For if they obey not him the Lord, how will they
obey you his Stewards? [ Mat. 10.24. Ezekiel. 3.7.] Let them be but once pious
toward God, and they will soon be profitable to you: and how may God prosper
you for them? [See Philem. ver. 11. Genesis 30.27.30. and 39.2, 3.] Besides, what
know you, O men, whether you shall save your wives? You Houshold-governors,
those under your Houshold-government? [1 Cor. 7.16.] Oh! how happy! thrice
happy would your Families be, if you Husbands and Wives shall be betrothed to
the same God (...) you Parents and Children begotten of the same Gospel! you
Masters and Servants born Heirs to the same Glory! Oh! what little Churches;
nay, what lower heavens are such Households! But if your houses be not thus with
God, Let it not seem a light thing to you, if you have detained them but from
one sin, or but delivered your own Souls. Verily, you are a sweet savor,
though yours should perish. God does not reward according to the success of
your work, but the sincerity of a willing mind: [2 Cor. 2.15, 16. Isa. 49.5. 2
Cor. 8.12. and 1.12.]

Secondly, for your Households sake. He that provides not for his own, specially
for those of his own house, has he not denied the Faith, and is worse than an
infidel? [1 Timothy 5.8.] Is this true in Temporals and not much more in
Spirituals? Must you provide food, clothing, and cure for their Mortal Bodies;
[See Genesis 30.30. Prove. 27.27. and 31.15. Matthew. 8.6.] and be at no pains for
their immortal Souls? Must you give those Bread and Fish, and these only
Stones and Serpents? either no provision, or which is worse, poison? Does Faith
teach such care for the Trunk and Cabinet, and meanwhile to cast by this Jewel,
which a whole world cannot equal, much less exceed? Are Souls so little worth,
and States so much? [Remember Matthew. 16.26. 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. Luke 16.19. ad
29.] Can earth show you, or secure them such a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory, as heaven can and does? If you are in good earnest, when you
talk of their happiness, of Heaven, Hell, the Glories with Christ, and the
gaudy Vanities of the creatures; why do not you study to lay up for them the
best Treasures? a good Foundation against time to come, that they may inherit
Eternal Life? Do we indeed believe that Scripture, Mat. 6.33? Ah! my Brethren,
consider:

1. Do not your Families want it? In the first Family, was there not a Cain? in
the best, a Judas? and when there was but one only Family in the world, was
there not, even in that, a Cham? Think over the provoking Sins, Standals, and
Sinks of Defilements and Discord that were in Abraham's, Isaac's, and Jacob's
Families, of whom yet as concerning the flesh Christ came: and if ever you did
see sin sinful, or were sensible of Gods dishonor, judge this, ^^sk then
needless, if you can. [ Genes 16.4, 5. and 21.9. and 26.35. and 27.31. and ck.
30. chapter 34. chapter 35. chapter 37.]

2. Will not your Families else wreck it? How often have Families rued their
Fathers remissness upon Earth? and how many are now Roaring in Hell, because
they restrained them not, who knows? [See Exodus 20.5. Psalm. 109.9, ad 16.
Isa. 14.21, 22, 23. and 31.2. 1 Samuel 3.13, 14.] And is this of your iniquities
a small matter? even the blood of the Souls of poor Innocents? To make your
Children and Servants twice more the children of wrath, and drudges of Satan,
by your counsel, conversation, or carelessness?

3. Does not your Family-weal depend upon it? Is not godliness the great gain?
Has no^ this the Promise? What but Family-Piety, has the Entail of
Family-Prosperity? [See Job 22.24, to the end. Psa. 118.15. and 128.
throughout: Psalm. 37.25. Prove. 12.7. and 15.6. and 24.3, 4.] Why is Abraham
called out to be such a signal Monument of Gods special Mercy? but in that
Abraham will command his children and his household after him, and they shall
keep the ways of the Lord. [Reade Genes. 18.17, 18, 19.] Oh! Christians! if ye
would not consult shame to your houses, keep out sin from, and keep up the
service of God in your houses. Would you perpetuate a Family on earth? acquaint
them with him, of whom the whole Family both in Heaven and Earth is named. Ah
Friends! there is set before you life and death, blessing and cursing;
therefore choose life, that you and your seed may live for ever. [See Prove.
3.33. Psalm. 55.15. Job 18.15. to the end: and 11.14, ad 20.] If you will keep
up their dignity, or keep off these dangers, be conscientious, I beseech you,
of these your Duties.

Direction I.
You must know how to rule your houses. [1 Timothy 3.5.] Wisdom is the principal
thing, as for heart, so for house-work too. [ Pro. 4.7. Psalm. 101.2.] You
Householders should be treasuries of Instruction. [ Mat. 13.52.] You are to
teach others, and do you not teach your selves? [ Romans 2.21. Heb. 5.12.] You
should be to your Wives, Sons and Servants, as is the Sun to the Moon and
Stars; and the Master of the Ship to the other Mariners. They should all shine
from your light, and is this darkness? You are to be eyes to the blind, and
feet to the same; Souls in your Families: and is the eye evil? Verily, the
whole body will be full of darkness. [ Mat. 6.23.]

Direction II.
It Is not enough to know how to rule your houses, but you must keep up the Rule
which God would have you know. [1 Timothy 3.4, 5.] VVot you what Authority you are
vested with over them; and what awe they should stand in of you? [Consult Exodus
20.12. Levit. 19 3. Deuteronomy. 27.16. Ephesians. 6.5. Col. 3.22.] I^ you would rule with
Gods approbation, you must not remit this Authority: Are you not his Deputies,
Col. 41? Let pious counsels be backed with powerful commands: [See Genes*
18.19. Deuteronomy. 32.46, 47. Luke 7.8, 9.] Never think you shall behave your selves
unblameably, unless you do bear up this Authority given you* 1 Thessalonians. 2, 10, 11.

Says any, An^ but how shall I? This is my difficulty. I answer: 1. Bring thy
house as much as thou can under the authority o^ God, and bear up Gods
authority over thy own heart, before thy household. Exalt this in thy house, and
it will exalt thee unto honor. Thou have a double assurance: the fear of
godliness upon them, and the faithfulness of God to thee. [ Genesis 27.12. Prove.
29.15, 17. 1 Samuel 2.30. with 29. Joh. 12.26.] It Is worthy of thy enquiry: Has
not God let down my authority, because I let fall, or did not lift up ^is among
mine? has he not raised up evil against me, out of my house, because of the
reproach his Name has sustained by my evil, in and before my household? See
Sam. ibid. and 2 Samuel 12.11. Isa. 1.5. Lam. 1.8.] Let Noah and Lot, but in one
particular, intermit their Faith in God, and fear of sin; theirs will soon
arrive to both shamelesness of sin, and fearlesness of them. [See Genesis 9.21,
22. and 19 31, to 37.]

2. Bear a more even sail and rein of anthority over them. Not too remiss; how
shall they then give you reverence? [ Heb. 12.9. Prove. 29.15.] Remember David's
fondlings, who all either sought his death, or found their own [See 1 Kings
1.5, 6, etc.] Nor ^ay it be too rigid and restrained. How often does the string
break, by screwing it ^o high? In every capacity, as Husband, father, Master,
there are some Cautions given ^hee for allay. [ Col. 3.19. 1 Pet. 3.7. Ephesians.
6.4, 9. Col. 4.1.

Direction III.
Keep out Seducers and Soul-deceivers. Receive them not into your houses,
neither bi^ them God speed. [Consider 2 John 10.1^ 1 Timothy 65. Rom 16.17.] Oh!
how ready are such to creep in uncalled for! and how often subvert they whole
houses! if you cannot sto^ their mouths, yet may you shut your doors [2 Timothy
3.6. Tit. 1.10, 11.] The Thief come not, but to steal, or worse: And are not
the Souls of yours your best Substance? If you are good men, watch, Luke 12.39.
Will yo^ not keep the Plague out of your houses? wha^ are deceivers, and men
of debauched Principle or ^ractices less, whose words will eat as does a
Canker? [2 Timothy 2.17.] Ah! who should not say touching his household, as David
within his? I hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me,
Psalm. 101. compare (...) and 3 verses.

Direction IV.
Cast out sinful defilements, lest they cast out you, and cause the curse to
come in upon your dwellings. [See Jer. 6.11, 12, 13. and 9.15, 16, 19, 20, 21.
Psalm. 49.11, 12.] So dwell in your houses, as God may dwell with you. [2 Cor.
6.16, 17, 18. Psalm. 101.2.] Oh! learn from Jacob, to cleanse first your own
hearts, then your households. [ Genesis 35.2, etc.] Cast out sinful matters, the
reproach and ruin of any people, [ Job 11.14. Prove. 14.34.] and sinful, ^f
separable, Members, that being often reproved harden their necks. Out with such
Ishmaels, as ^coff at godliness. Did Sarah only suggest it, Genesis 21.9, 10?
Nay, the Scripture has said it, [See Gal. 4 30.] Consult no longer in it with
flesh and blood: but, come, read and resolve with David, Psalm. 101.3 ad 8.

Direction V.
Cause them to sanctify the Sabbaths of God. Is not the fourth Commandment for
you? even for you? And are not you charged with your sons, your daughters, your
man-servants, and your maidservants in it? Yea, and upon how many cogent
reasons? Exodus 20.10, 11. [Reade Levit. 23.3.] Has not God given you their six
days labor; and will you gradge him their seventh days rest? So you have
their service six days, matters it not whether God or the World, Sin and Satan
have the seventh? How unnatural and, unthankful would you thus be? Oh! command
them to cleanse themselves, and keep the Sabbath as did good Nehemiah, both
them and the Levites. [ Nehem. 13.19, 21] If yours shall now follow their
labors, or find their pleasures on this holy Day, must i^ not be said unto
you. What evil thing is this that Y^E do, and profane the Sabbath day? [Ver.
15, 16, 17.] Will you yet bring more wrath upon England, by profaning the
Sabbath? [Ver 18. Jer. 17.27.]

Direction VI.
Carry them abroad with you to the solemn Worship of God. Should not your
households arise, and go up to Bethel with you, to offer to the Lord? that they
may learn to hear, and fear the Lord our God, and observe to do all the words
of his Law: Verily, yes; if either Scripture-Patterns or Precepts may determine
it. [Consult Gen 35.2, 3. 1 Samuel 1.21. Exodus 10.9. Deuteronomy. 31.12. Josh. 8.35.
Deuteronomy. 29.10, 11, 12, 13] Would you not fain have them to heaven with you? why
then not to hear, etc. with ^ou? Can they believe in him of whom they ^^ve not
heard? or go to heaven without be^^ing? [ Romans 10.13, 14.] Henceforth then,
(...) with a multitude to the House of God. ^his will be your Crown and
Comfort, when ^^u can tell the Minister of God, concerning ^^th your selves and
households, We are ALL (...) present before God, to hear all things that (...)
commanded thee of God. [Psal. 42.4. Acts ^. 33. with 2.]

Direction VII.
Be careful to instruct them at home in the ^od Word and Works of God. Think
you it is the duty only of Ministers to their ^ocks? Nay, but of Masters
likewise to their ^milies. You are under as express Obliga^^ns, and have more
eminent Opportunities, ^o are with them at all seasons. [See Ephesians. ^4. Deuteronomy.
4.9, 10. and 32.46. Psalm. 78.5, 6. (...) 38.18, 19.] Yea, not only you Fathers
^^d Masters, but you Mothers and Mistrisses, ^ould instruct yours in the ways
of Righte^sness. [ Prove. 18. and 4.3, 4. and 31.1, 26. Acts ^.26.] Oh
Christians!

1. Be careful that the holy Scriptures be ^en read to, and by them. Has not
God commanded it both to you and them? [Tu^ to Deuteronomy. 11.19. and 6.7. Isa 34.16
Joh. 5.39* Are they not able to make you wise unto Sa^vation? and are
profitable to every thing [2 Timothy 3.15, 16, 17.] Oh! that this wo^ might dwell
henceforth richly in you, an^ among them! which is so much sweeter tha^ honey,
and more to be desired than much fir^ gold for them. [ Col. 3.16. Psalm. 19.10.
and 119* 72, 127. Prove. 8.19.]

2. Be not careless to repeat Scripture Truths, and Sermons among them. Wha^
God had spoken to Israel by his Minister a^ Horeb, each Master in Israel must
speak it ^ver again, talk of it in, and teach it diligen^ly to his house: and
there are no small Premises annexed to this thing. [Reade Deuteronomy. (...) 6, 7, 9.
and 4.9, 10. and 11.18, 19, 20.] Do n^ your selves need line upon line, who
ha^^ more quickness to receive, and capacious Memories to retain? And can it be
a needle work then among yours? Ah Brethren (...) Listen not any longer to
sinful, or sullen E^ceptions or Excuses. Oh! Let not this see^ grievous to you,
which is so good for them [ Phil. 3.1.]

3. Catechize them in the Principles of Religion: That your Children and
Servants may ^e like Abraham's [Eth-Chanican] Catechi^ed Servants. [ Genesis 14.14]
Should you not ^het or sharpen the Word of God upon them, as you sit in your
houses? [ Deuteronomy. 6.7. Margin] scil. by fetching the same Funda^ental Truths of
God forth and back, over and over, by Catechistical Questions and An^wers? Oh!
Catechize them betimes, in the ^ay they should go, and when they are old ^^ey
will not depart from it. [ Prove. 22.6. ^ee the Marginal Reading.] Think not
ei^^er your pains herein too much, or the pro^^ hereof to be but small.

4. Keep them close to the Practice of ^^ligion likewise. Must you to the
Solemn ^bbath-duties? and why not to Secret du^^s also? [ Exodus 20.10. See 1 Chronicles. 28.9. ^^cts 21.5.] Why should thou think, that (...) learn any from a
child the holy Scri^^res, Psalms, Prayers, etc. is but to lead ^^th into
Hypocrisy? Does Paul so harsh^^ censure? or commends he not rather the ^^e
pious care in Timothy's Mother and ^randmother? [Compare 2 Timothy 1.5. with ^hap.
3.14, 15.] Let the Scribes swell with ^dignation, at the little Childrens
singing ^sannah, a part of the 118th Psalm; (which it seems their Parents had
taught them) bu^ let Saints, as did our Savior, justify them [ Matthew. 21.15,
16.] It Is Pharaoh only tha^ will abridge the little ones from keeping (...)
Feast to the Lord: Moses will not accept l^ bertie from him for themselves,
unless he man have the young ones, as well as the old wit^ him. [ Exodus 10 8,
9, 10] Oh Beloved I No^ are the choice days; [ Eccles. 12.1. Hebr ^ Now, if
ever, to initiate and inure them (...) the remembrance of their Creator, and
exe^cises of Religion, while their hearts are y^ tender, and not hardened
against spiritual impressions. [See Prove. 4.3, 4. Isai. 28.9. Can you forget
young Samuel? Young O^ badiah, etc.? Is there no present efficacy^ yet may
their profitings be eminent hereb^ afterward, [Compare Joh. 2.22. with 19 John
12.15. with 16.] Do you not conve^ in any good? yet shall you hereby keep o^
much bad, [2 Chronicles. 24.2. chap. 25.2.^ If you will not learn them to bless,
they w^ learn to curse God. Why should they (...) be taught to cry Hosannah,
who witho^ teaching this, may perhaps otherwise cr^ Go up thou bala-head? [See
2 Kings (...) 23, 24.

5. Call them frequen^ly to account, how they profit in religion, and by
reading, hearing, etc. Ow you not as much to Gods truths, us to their, or your
own Trades? [ Prove. 23.23] Would you be so negligent, in asking after what
they do in your Shops, or among your Sheep, etc. as how they do in their Souls?
Oh! That we might learn of Christ to look better to our families! See what a
pattern he has left us of enquiring into their spiritual estates, whether and
what they understand, etc. Matthew. 13.51. Chap. 16.11, 13, 15.

6. Commune familiarly ever and anon with them, about both the principles and
practice of Religion. Deny them not liberty to ask, ^or disdain to answer such
questions, as may minister godly edifying. What but either hor^id pride, or
stupid ignorance, should hinder (...), who have such close engagements to it,
[See 1 Cor. 14.35. Exodus 12.26. Josh. 4.6.] and the unquestionable example of
Christ for it? [Peruse Matthew. 13.10, 36. Mark 4.10. Luke 2.46.] Are any of our
households more beneath ^s, then were Christ's Disciples below him, who was King
of Kings and Lord of Lords?

Direction VIII.
Call and keep them together frequently, for the Spiritual Worship of God. Let
J^shuah's purpose be each of yours; Let it seem evil to others: choose they
what and whom they list -- but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
[Josh. 24.15.] Do not only offer Praises and Prayers to God for them, but with
them also; to which adjoyn Fasting, as is occasion. [ Job 1.5. Esther 4.16.]

. 1.
Sing with grace in your hearts the Psalms of God in your houses. [ Ephesians.
5.19. Col. 3.16.] Judge it not a matter arbitrary, but a manifest duty. [See
Psalm. 135.19, 20 Psalm. 30. Title of the Psalm.] Are you righteous? and shall
not the voice of Rejoicing and Salvation be in the Tabernacles of the
righteous? [ Psalm. 118.15.] Be ye followers of Christ; [ Matthew. 11.29 1 Cor.
11.1.] whom in this likewise ye have for an example, of singing an Hymn with
his Family; sc. his Disciples, [ Matthew. 26.30.]

. 2.
Cease not to pray with them. Turn disputing into doing. Was it not better with
you, than now, when you prayed among them more, and puzzled your selves and
others less? I beseech you, Brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for
the love of the Spirit, strive together in Prayer for and with them. Consider,
Christians:

1. Are you not eminently concerned in it? Are not all things sanctified by
Prayer? [1 Timothy 4.5.] Does not the success of all depend upon Prayer? [Reade
Ezekiel. 36.37. Jer. 29.11, 12. 2 Samuel 7.29.] Is there not a singular efficacy,
and surpassing excellency in Prayer, especially joint Prayer? Josh. 10.12, 13.
Jam. 5 14, ad 19. Acts 12.5, ad 12.] And are not all Societies, that have an
hand in common Sins, Sufferings and Salvations, to have hearts concurring to
common Humiliations, Supplications, and Thanksgivings? [See 2 Cor. 1.11. 2 Chronicles. 20.4. Jon. 2.8. 1 Chronicles. 29.20. Acts 1.14, 24. and 4.23, 24. and 21.5.]
Ah beloved! may, yea must Cities, Churches, and Commonweals join? and yet may
not Families? whose Opportunities are far more, and Obligations never a whit
less? What! are you Governors of Christian Familles, and shall they carry the
badg and cognizance of heathens that know not God: Families that call not on
his Name? [Read and tremble at Jer. 10.25.]

2. Is it not by example commended to you? Need I tell you of Jacobs
worshipping with his household at Bethel? [ Genesis 35.2, 3] Could he, think you,
present Sacrifices, and yet pass by prayers, so prime a part of worship, which
even Nature suggests, and by which the rest is sanctified? Or can you have so
little charity for Saints, or Piety for our blessed Savior, as when you read
of so many households Christian, that were Churches of Christ, to retain still
your ungrounded prejudices; that there were no joynt-prayers, no not in any of
all those? Have you so forgotten how the primitive Churches continued
steadfastly together in prayers? [ Acts 2.42. chap. 12.7.] Besides, what did
Joshua, Daniel or Cornel us less then this, in and with their households? [ Josh
24.15. Dan. 6.10. Acts 10.30. with ver. 2. compared] Sure I am, that Jesus, our
great Master did as much and more with his family, who not only when he was
alone with his Disciples prayed with them, Luke 9.18. [compare Mark 4.10.] but
taught them also, how and what to pray for, as John also did his Dilciples, [
Luke 11.1, 2.]

3. Is it not in effect commanded you too? You are bound to pray always, with
all prayer and supplication, Ephesians. 6.18. By whom? by what? or where are you
more exempted from praying in your private families, then in the public
Congregation, or personally a^one in your Closets? Read and remember 1 Timothy
2.8. Besides, Are you not to watch occasions and improve opportunities unto
prayer? And that as may be best pleasing to and most prevalent with God? [
Ephesians. 6 18. 1 Pet. 4 7. Col. 1.10] And do not you see the preheminenty of, and
promise to united prayers? [ Mat. 18.19, 20] or durst you say, you have no
Family occasions, and opportunities for prayer? Oh! ^ow practically and
pathetically shall both these be owned, and penitently observed by fa^ilies
apart, at the conversion of the Jews? [Consider Zech. 12.12, 13, 14] Come
then, what meanest thou, O sleeper? Arise, Call upon thy God. In every thing by
prayer and ^upplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto
God, together with your households; [ Phil. 4.6.] and that dai^y, as you renew
iniquities, need and re^eive mercies, and therefore should return unto God in
Petitions and Praises, daily. [See Job 1.5. Mat. 6.11. Dan 6.10.] Oh beloved
how good a thing it is to show forth the loving kindness of God every morning,
and his faithfulness every night! [ Psalm. 92.1, 2.] Was there not to be morning
and evening Sacrifice under the Law? [ Exodus 30.7, 8. yea, and therewith,
morning and evening Prayer? [ Luke 1.9, 10.] An Friends! the Gospel, which is
more Spiritual, is it not withal as strict? Is our freedom from Worship? from
Prayer? or not rather to it? [See Romans 6.18, 22. Luke 1.74, 75. Heb. 4.14, 16.
and 10.19, 20, 21, 22.] Oh! therefore let your Prayers be set forth before God
as Incense, and the lifting up of your hands as the evening Sacrifice. [ Psalm.
141.2.] How can you begin or end the day, and the duties thereof better, than
by beginning and ending both, in and with him, from whom you, yours, and all
other things, both begin and end.

Direction IX.
Keep up a strict Discipline in and over your Households for God. Forget not
this Battlement for your Roofs, lest you bring blood upon your houses. Farewell
Duties, if ye let fall Discipline. What but sin against God, shame to you, and
sadness to your, will come in at that door, whereat this goes out? [Peruse
Prove. 29.15. and 10.1. and 17.21, 25.] Witness Eli's house. I beseech you
therefore,

1. Set up Family-order, else, never look for Family-obedience: [ Matthew. 8.9.]
Let not yours be like Eli's, Sons of Belial, i.e. without a yoke, [1 Samuel
2.12.] Let every Star know his Orb, each Member his Office. Here is the Beauty
and how often does God command his Blessing on such a Family! [ Mat. 24.45. 1
Kings 10.5, 8. Genesis 43.33. Psalm. 128.3.4.]

2. See there be Family-oversight. Must you be diligent to know the state of
your Flocks, and not of your Families? to look well to your Herds, and not to
their eternal Happiness? [ Prove. 27.23.] Does God take care for Oxen? [1 Cor.
9.9.] Shall Herod's Swine be more to him, than his Son? What less then this, is
employed of Job, or was the endeavor of Jacob? [ Job 1.5. Genesis 35 2, 3, 4.]

3 Let there be family correption or reproof. Not only should ye watch over
them, but warn those that are unruly among them, and rebuke them with all
authority. [1 Thessalonians. 5.14. Prove. 27.5.] Would ye not bear sin for them? Do you
not hate their souls? then in any wise rebuke them, who may otherwise curse you
if ye connive at them [See Lev. 19.17. Text and margin, Prove. 24.24, 25.]

4. Let there be Family-correction too, as is occasion. The rod and reproof
give wisdom. [ Prove. 29.15. Compare, 1 Samuel 2.23, 24, 25. with chap. 3.13.] Is
there not a servant that will not be corrected by words? [ Prove. 29.19.] If such
will not hear you counselling, they should feel you correcting, [See Luke
12.47, 48. Prove. 19.29.] Yea and in this, your child differs nothing from a
servant, though he be heir to all. Ah Christians! How many exceeding great and
precious Promises have you to, and Precepts for chastizing them with the rod?
And how has God prevented our fond objections? [See Pro. 13.24. and 19.18. and
22, 15. and 23.13. and 29.17] Durst you render all this in vain? Only remember,
when I press the rod, I persuade you not to rage. Do not you call cruelty
correction. [Read Ephesians. 6.4, 9. Col. 3.21. and 4.1. Exodus 21 20, 21, 26, 27.]

Direction X.
Commend and Crown the practice of all these directions with an Humble, Holy,
Courteous, and Convincing Conversation. Your carriage is like either to make or
mar all your counsels. One good work or gracious action, will go further, than
a hundred good words or the greatest Argumentations. Oh! how much readier are
ours to believe what they see us do, than what they hear us discourse of? Shall
it be said, my beloved, to yours, and of you, [Read Matthew. 23.3.] as Christ
said to the multitude, of the Scribes and Pharisees? No, so say, and so do. Let
your actions Comment on, and Commend your Advises. One sullen passion, or
scandalous passage, may prejudice all your other Pains and Prayers. You
Masters, and we Ministers, can never sin at the common, or at as a cheap a
rate as others. [See Romans 2.17. ad 25. ^.] Oh therefore take heed to your
selves first, and most! who have souls to be saved, sins to be subdued, a God
to honor an heaven to win or lose, a devil to tempt you, and a deceitful heart
to turn you aside, as well as have any of yours. Are you not men with them of
like passions? Let every man therefore resolve with Joshua, first for himself,
then for his. [ Jos. 24.15.] If you would have them indeed serve God; so do, as
they may second you. Be and do that for God which you bear them in hand they
must do, or they ^an never be saved. No exhortations will be so enforcing as
your own examples. See how it entailes a form of good or evil from generation
to generation, 2 Kings 14.3. chap. 15.3. with ver. 34.2 King. 15.9. chap.
17.41. Jer. 17.1, 2. Prove. 29.12. Oh Beloved, if ever ye would have your houses
walk with God, you must walk before God with a perfect heart, in and before
your houses.

And now, my dearest Brethren, what is our hope, or joy or crown of rejoicing?
Shall not even ye be in the presence of the Lord at his coming, if ye shall
fulfill with him? Yea, we live if ye stand fast in the Lord, who can have no
greater joy, then to see your selves and families fellow-Citizens with the
Saints, and of the household of God. Beloved your work is before you. Oh! let
not your houses be Beth-avens, houses of iniquity and vanity; but Bethels,
houses of God, and godly duties. Let it not be written of, or on any of them,
Such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knows
not God. But let all that pass by them be able to see, and say of them, The
Lord is in this place, this is no other but the house of God, yea in a sort
this is the gate of heaven, [Job 18.21. Genesis 28.16, 17.] So prays,

From my Study, April 6. 1657. A Remembrancer of your best welfare from and
unto God, JOHN NORMAN.

FINIS.
