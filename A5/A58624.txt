MAJESTY.

Their Letter to some Brethren of the Ministry there.

And their Commission to their Brother Master Alexander Henderson, January 1643.

EDINBURGH, Printed by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. 1643.

To the Kings most excellent Majesty.
The humble Petition of the Commissioners of the General Assembly of the Kirk
of Scotland, from their meeting at Edinburgh, January 4. 1643.
OUr silence and ceasing to present before Your Majesty our humble thoughts and
desires at this time of common danger to Religion, to Your Majesty's sacred
Person, Your Crown, and Posterity, and to all Your Majesty's Dominions, were
impiety against God, unthankfulnes and disloyalty against Your Majesty, an
indirect approbation and hard^^ ing of the adversaries of Truth and Peace in
their wicked ways, and a cruelty against our Brethren, lying in such depths of
affliction and anguish of spirit; any one of which crimes were in us, above all
others most inexcusable, and would prove us most unworthie of the trust
committed unto us. The flame of this common combustion has almost devoured
Ireland, is now wasting the Kingdom of England, and we cannot tell how soon it
shall enter upon our selves, and set this Your Majesty's most ancient and native
Kingdom on fire: If in this woeful case and lamentable condition of Your
Majesty's Dominions all others should be silent, it becomes us to speak; and
if our tongues and pens should cease, our consciences within us would cry out,
and the stones in the streets would answer us.

Our great grief and apprehension of danger, is not a little increased, partly
by the insolency and presumption of Papists and others disaffected to the
Reformation of Religion who although for their number and power, they be not
considerable amongst us; yet through the success of the Popish party in
Ireland, and the hopes they conceive of the prevailing power of Popish Armies,
and the Prelaticall Faction in England, they have of late taken spirits, and
begun to speak big words against the Reformation of Religion, and the Work of
God in this Land; and partly and more principally, that a chief praise of the
Protestant Religion, and thereby our not vain, but just gloriation, is by the
public Declaration of the Earl of Newcastle, General of Your Majesty's
Forces in the Northern parts, and nearest unto us, transferred unto Papists;
who although they be sworn enemies unto Kings, and be as infamous for their
Treasons and Conspiracies against Princes and Rulers, as for their known
Idolatry and spiritual Tyranny; yet are they openly declared to be, not good
Subjects, or better Sub^^cts, but far better Subjects then Protestants; which
is a new and foul disparagement of the reformed Religion, a notable injury to
Your Majesty in Your Honor, a sensible reflection upon the whole Body of this
Kingdom, which is impatient that any Subjects, but abhors, and extremely
disdaineth that Papists, who refuse to take the Oath of Allegiance, should be
compared with them in allegiance and fidelity; and, which as a strange
doctrine, from the mouth or pen of professed Protestants, will suffer an hard
construction from all the Reformed Kirks.

We therefore Your Majesty's most humble and loving Subjects, upon these and
the like considerations, do humbly entreat, That Your Majesty may be pleased in
Your Princely wisdom, First to consider, That the intentions of Papists,
directed by the principles of their Profession, are no other, then they have
been from the beginning, even to build their Babel, and to set up their
execrable Idolatry, and Antichristian Tyranny in all Your Majesty's Dominions,
to change the Face of Your two Kingdoms of Scotland and England, into the
similitude of miserable Ireland, which is more bitter to the people of God,
Your Majesty's good Subjects, to think upon, than death: And whatsoever their
present pretenses be for the defense of Your Majesty's Person and Authority;
yet in the end by their arms and power, with a displayed banner, to bring that
to pass against Your Royal Person and Posterity, which the fifth of November,
never to be forgotten, was not able by their subtle and under-mining treason
to produce; Or which will be their greatest mercy, to reduce Your Majesty, and
Your Kingdoms, to the base and unnatural slavery of their Monarch the Pope:
And next, that Your Majesty upon this undeniable evidence, may timously and
speedily apply Your Royal Authority for dis-banding their Forces, suppressing
their Power, and disappointing their bloody and merciless projects. And for
this end we are with greater earnestnes than before, constrained to fall down
again before Your Majesty, and in all humility to renew the Supplication of the
late General Assembly, and our own former Petition in their name, for unity of
Religion, and for uniformity of Church Government in all Your Majesty's
Dominions: And to this effect for a meeting of sound Divines to be held in
England, unto which according to the desire of Your Majesty's Parliament, some
Commissioners may be sent from this Kirk, that in all points to be proponed and
debated, there may be the greater consent and harmony.

We take the boldness to be the more instant in this our humble desire, because
it concerns the Lord Jesus Christ so much in his glory, your Majesty in your
honor, the Kirk of England which we ought to tender as our own bowels, and
whose reformation is more dear to us, than our lives, in her happiness, and
the Kirk of Scotland in her purity and peace: Former experience, and daily
sense teaching us, that without the Reformation of the Kirk of England, there
is no hope nor possibility of the continuance of Reformation here.

The Lord of Heaven and Earth, whose Vicegerent Your Majesty is, calls for
this great Work of Reformation at Your hands, and the present commotions and
troubles of Your Majesty's Dominions, are either preparations in the mercy of
God, for this blessed Reformation and unity in Religion, which is the desire,
prayer, and expectation of all Your Majesty's good Subjects in this Kingdom,
Or, which they tremble to think upon, and earnestly deprecate, are in the
justice of God for the abuse of the Gospel, the tolerating of Idolatry and
Superstition against so clear a light, and not acknowledging the day of
visitation; The beginnings of such a doleful desolation, as no policy or
power of man, shall be able to prevent, and as shall make Your Majesty's
Kingdoms within a short time as miserable as now they may be happy by a
Reformation of Religion. God forbid, that while the Houses of Parliament do
profess their desire of the Reformation of Religion in a peaceable and
Parliamentarie way, and pass their Bills for that end in the particulars, That
Your Majesty, the Nurse-father of the Kirk of Christ, to whose care the custody
and vindication of Religion does principally belong, should to the provoking of
the anger of God, the stopping of the influence of so many blessings from
Heaven, and the grieving of the hearts of all the godly, frustrate our
expectation, make our hopes ashamed, and hazard the loss of the hearts of all
Your good People, which next unto the truth and unity of Religion, and the
safety of Your Kingdoms, are willing to hazard their lives, and spend their
blood for Your Majesty's honor end happiness.

We are not ignorant that the Work is great, the difficulties and impediments
be many, and that there be both Mountains and Lions in the way. The strongest
let, till it be taken out of the way, is the Mountain of Prelacie: And no
wonder, if Your Majestic consider how many Papists, and Popishly affected, have
for a long time found peace and ease under the shadow thereof; How many of the
Prelaticall Faction have thereby their life and being; How many profane and
worldly men do fear the yoke of Christ, and are unwilling to submit themselves
to the obedience of the Gospel; And how many there be, whose eyes are dazelled
with the external pomp and glory of the Kirk, whose minds are mis-carried
with a conceit of the governing the Kirk by the rules of humane Policy, and
whose hearts are affrighted with the apprehension of the dangerous consequences
which may ensue upon alterations. But when Your Majesty in Your Princely and
religious wisdom, shall remember from the Records of former times, how
against the gates of hell, the force and fraud of worldly and wicked men, and
all Panick fears of danger, the Christian Religion was first planted, and the
Christian Kirks thereafter reformed, and from the condition of the present
times, how many from the experience of the tyranny of Prelates, are afraid to
discover themselves, lest they be revenged upon them hereafter: Whereas
Prelacie being removed, they would openly profess what they are, and join with
others in the way of Reformation; All obstacles and difficulties shall be but
matter of the manifestation of the power of God, the principal worker, and the
means of the greater glory to Your Majesty the prime Instrument.

The intermixture of the government of Prelates with the Civil State,
mentioned in Your Majesty's Answer to our former Petition, being taken away,
and the right Government by Assemblies, which is to be seen in all the Reformed
Kirks, and wherein the agreement will be easy, being settled; The Kirk and
Religion will be more pure and free of mixture, and the Civil Government more
sound and firm; That Government of the Kirk, must suit best with the Civil
State, and be most useful for Kings and Kingdoms, which is best warranted by
GOD, by whom Kings do reign, and Kingdoms are established; Nor can a
Reformation be expected in the Common and ordinary way, expressed also in Your
Majesty's Answer. The wisest and most Religious Princes have found it
impossible, and implying a repugnancie, since the persons to be reformed, and
the Reformers, must be diverse, and the way of Reformation must be different
from the corrupt way, by which defections of Kirk-men, and corruptions in
doctrine, worship, and Government have entered into the Kirk. Suffer us
therefore (Dread Sovereign) to renew our Petitions for this unity of Religion,
and uniformity of Kirk-government, and for a meeting of sound Divines of both
Kingdoms, who may prepare matters for Your Majesty's view, and for the
examination and approbation of more full Assemblies.

The National Assembly of this Kirk, from which we have our Commission, did
promise in their thanksgiving for the many favors expressed in Your Majesty's
Letter, their best endeavors to keep the people under their charge, in unity
and peace, and in loyalty and obedience to Your Majesty and Your Laws, which
we confess is a duty well beseeming the preachers of the Gospel: But we cannot
conceal, how much both Pastors and People are grieved and disquieted with the
late reports of the success, boldness, and strength of Popish forces in Ireland
and England, and how much danger from the power of so malicious and bloody
Enemies, is apprehended to the Religion and peace of this Kirk and Kingdom,
conceived by them to be the spring whence have issued all their calamities and
miseries: Which we humbly remonstrate to Your Majesty, as a necessity requiring
a General Assembly, and do earnestly supplicate for the presence and assistance
of Your Majesty's Commissioner at the day to be appointed, That by universal
consent of the whole Kirk, the best course may be taken for the preservation of
Religion, and for the averting of the great wrath which they conceive to be
imminent to this Kingdom.

If it shall please the Lord, in whose hand is the heart of the King, as the
rivers of waters to turn it whithersoever he will, to incline Your Majesty's
heart, to this through Reformation, no more to tolerate the Mass, or any part
of Romish superstition or Tyranny, and to command that all good means be used
for the conversion of Your Princely consort the Queens Majesty, which is also
the humble desire of this whole Kirk and Kingdom, Your joint comforts shall be
multiplied above the days of Your affliction, to Your incredible joy, Your
glory shall shine in brightness above all Your Royal Progenitors, to the
Admiration of the World, and the terror of Your Enemies; And Your Kingdoms so
far abound in Righteousness, Peace, and Prosperity above all that has been in
former Generations, that they shall say; It is good for us that we have been
afflicted.

TO THE HONORABLE HOUSES of the Parliament of ENGLAND.
The Declaration of the Commissioners of the General Assembly of the Kirk of
SCOTLAND, from their meeting at Edinburgh. Jan. 4. 1643.
THe weighty charge and trust put upon us by the General Assembly of this
Kirk, has given us, the boldness, in this time of so great danger to
Religion, to His Majesty's Person, Crown, and Posterity, and to all His
Majesty's Dominions, through the insolency and prevailing power of Papists and
the Prelaticall party, to represent unto His Majesty by supplication, our
humble thoughts and desires for a speedy remedy; By disbanding all Papists out
of His Army; by calling an Assembly of godly and sound Divines, unto which
some of the Commissioners may be sent from the Kirk of Scotland, that by the
blessing of GOD upon their labors, the so much desired unity in Religion and
Kirk-government, may be brought about and settled in both Kingdoms; and by the
faithful using of all good means for the Conversion of the Queens Majesty to
the profession and practice of the true reformed Religion, which we conceive a
principal part of the remedy.

This Kirk and Kingdom has the sympathy and fears, but the Houses of
Parliament, and the Kingdom of England have the sufferings and sense of these
evils; We are in the danger, they in the distress; The miseries are imminent
to us, but incumbent upon them: And therefore the Commissioners of the Assembly
do only represent their Brotherly and Christian fellow-feeling of the present
condition of that Kingdom, and their fears ere it be long, unless the
merciful and mighty GOD prevent it by his gracious providence, of the like
calamities unto themselves, Together with their earnest prayers for Englands
deliverance and their own safety: And do earnestly entreat, that the Parliament
may be pleased for their part, and so much as in them lies, speedily to apply
the forenamed Remedies; by disbanding Papists, if any be in their Armies, as
is alleged in diverse Declarations; by the full manifestation and constant
prosecution of their desires of unity in Religion and Kirk-government; by
their instant and uncessant dealing with His Majesty for calling such an
Assembly of Divines; and by their serious thoughts and endeavors about the
Queen her conversion, that the high provocation of Idolatry may no more be
tolerated in the land: For which ends the Commissioners of the Assembly have
sent up for the present with the Lord Chancellor, and others from the
Commissioners for conserving of peace, one of their number, a beloved and
faithful brother Mr Alexander Henderson, faith fully and fully to express
their meaning in the particulars, so far as the wisdom of the Parliament
shall judge it convenient to require or demand, and to make report to
themselves, and unto the General Assembly (which is to be called upon the
occasion of the present exigence and necessity through the danger of Religion)
of the principal letts and hindrances of Reformation and unity in Religion,
and where the work does stay. As they do above all other things desire, that
against all tentations and opposition, whatsoever may promove or conduce for
this blessed Reformation, may from the zeal and by the wisdom of the Houses
of Parliament be diligently gone about, without waiting for a more settled
condition of the State; so do they nothing doubt but this being done, wrath
shall be turned away from the Realm, the brightness of the presence of God,
accompanying the Reformation of Religion, shall scatter all the clouds of
differences betwixt His Majesty and them, and His powerful providence shall
both incline the Kings heart to the same Reformation, and to the establishing
of their Civil Liberties and Laws, and move the Houses of Parliament after a
special manner and in all cheerfulness to manifest their tender and dutiful
care of His Majesty's sacred Person, and of His Royal Greatness and
Authority, as a principal mean of the Greatness and Prosperity of that, and
other His Majesty's Kingdoms, that all bypast: miseries being buried in
oblivion, and the present distempers being perfectly cured, the Island of
Britain may be an holy and happy Land, wherein GOD may be served according to
His Word, the King obeyed according to His Laws, and the people live a quiet
and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty, to the Admiration of the
World, the envy of all wicked and Antichristian enemies, and to the comfort of
all that love the Lord Jesus Christ.

A. Ker Cler. Commiss. Genesis Ass.

The Letter of the Commissioners of the General Assembly, direct to the right
reverend their well-known and much approved Brethren of the Ministry of the
Kirk of England.
Right reverend and dear Brethren,
OUr earnest and uncessant desires of unity in Religion, the present distress
of England and Ireland, the danger to Religion in all His Mties Dominions, and
the fears we have of an universal combustion, universally deserved by our not
knowing the time of our visitation, and the things which belong unto our peace,
have constrained us with greater liberty then formerly, to solicit his Mty by
our supplication, and the honorable houses of Parliament by our Declaration,
which we have sent by the hand of our reverend Brother, and much approved
Commissioner, Master Alexander Henderson, who will also make known to you our
care and diligence to discover and remove such letts and hindrances of the
Peace and Union of the two Kingdoms, as by the subtlety and malignance of
some few bad Instruments have been cast in the way, that this whole Kirk and
Kingdom may be entirely kept in the prosecution of their desires of civil
peace and religious unity, wherein (by the mercy of God) we have the happiness
that the Lords of Privy Council, and the Commissioners for conserving the
Peace betwixt the two Kingdoms, have not denied their honorable help and
assistance. Your present sufferings, wherein we your Brethren cannot but have
our fellow-feeling, and the late experience of somewhat the like among our
selves, may teach us both, that Satan and his instruments, in whom he now
works, are in a rage at the Reformation of Religion; nor is it any new or
strange thing, that a time of Reformation be a time of trouble and difficulty:
But your comfort and ours is, that the Arm of the Lord is not shortened, and
that he who is in us, is stronger than he who is in the world. We make no
question of your vigilancie, circumspection and faithfulness, and that no
present nor future opposition will prevail so far, as to make you either more
remiss in your intentions and desires of ordering all things in the House of
the God of Heaven, according to his own will and commandment, or so much as to
lay aside so great and necessary a Work in expectation of a fitter opportunity,
and a more peaceable and convenient season. We are very confident, that ye will
be steadfast and unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as
much as ye know your work is not in vain in the Lord. We for our part shall,
through the Lords assistance by our prayers, with Fasting and Humiliation, and
by our best endeavors be helpers together for the wished end. At the first
Reformation of Religion in this Land, a very small number of Ministers, without
the help, and with the contradiction of the world, through the mighty presenee,
and blessing of God upon their weak labors, brought the Work at last to
perfection: And in the beginnings of our late Reformation, when we were
assembled at Glasgow against the Prelacie, the Ceremonies and Service Book, a
great part of the Assembly intended no such alteration in the Form of Worship
and Kirk-government, as they were moved unanimously to consent unto in the end.
When the time of Reformation comes, the wisdom and spirit of God in his
servants, cannot be resisted by the wit and power of man. What although ye
should sow, and the Posterity reap? Has not the Lord sent both you and us to
reap that whereon neither of us bestowed any labor? other men labored, and we
are entered into their labors? We of this Island are set upon the stage, at
this time, the eyes of all the Reformed Kirks are upon us, we are after a
special manner made a spectacle to the World, to Angels, to Men. Our cares
must be so to acquit our selves, that we make not our Friends; the followers
of Christ, to mourn; and our enemies, the favorers of Antichrist, to triumph
and rejoice: Which that we may do, is, and shall be the prayer of

Edinburgh, Jan. 1643. Your most loving Brethren and fellow laborers in the
Work of the Lord, the Commissioners of the General Assembly. M. Robert Douglas
Moderator. A. Ker Cler. Commiss. Genesis Ass.
