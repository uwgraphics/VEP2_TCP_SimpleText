OH YE HEADS OF THE NATION Who are set in the SVPREAM AVTHORITY Thereof, and
are at this time Assembled in PARLIAMENT, Hear ye the Word of the Lord, as it
came unto me the sixth day of the fifth Month of this present year, concerning
you.

LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1659.

THE Lord God Almighty of heaven and earth who reigns on high by his power and
strength, whose mercy endures for ever* Has now so loved the world that he
has sent his only begotten Son out of his own bosom for a light into the
world, that whosoever will receive, believe and follow him shall not perish but
have everlasting life.

Now it being the good pleasure of his heavenly will, first to visit these
three Nations of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and to send his Son into them
to seek and search out his sheep, (according to his promise made of old, Ezekiel.
34.) and to gather them from the mouths of the Idol dumb shepherds that has
made a prey upon them, which work is already begun, and many are gathered by
his right hand into his Covenant of life, and are taught of him, and
established in his righteousness, against whom no weapon formed shall ever
prosper, for whose sake the imediate hand of Gods eternal power has been often
seen to be stretched forth against his and their enemies (in diverse manner of
ways) who would not let his Seed go free to offer to him a sacrifice in
righteousness but laid heavy burdens upon his people which they have long
groaned under, and their oppressors were often warned as Pharaoh was by Moses
before Gods judgment came upon them, but when they still stopped their ears
and hardened their hearts from hearing the cry of the oppressed, then did the
Seed cry unto the Lord, whose complaint he has heard, and for its sake has
mightily appeared again and again, and has rebuked and overturned Protectors,
Counsels and Parliaments that he might bring to pass his noble acts which he
promised to perform in the days of old by the mouths of his servants the
Prophets; so let your ears be open if you do intend to stand.

And them which he has called and chosen in these three Nations of England,
Scotland and Ireland within this late years has not been wanting to lay before
Protector and Parliament (who then had the power in their hands the grievous
and cruel yoke of bondage which they were held under by the seed of evil doers
( viz. Priests and Lawyers) who had power given from them to lay more grievous
burdens upon the chosen of God then all the oppressors that ever was read of
before* except the blood suckers in Queen Mary's days, yea the Priests under a
color of Law from Protector and Parliament has far exceeded all the false
Prophets that ever was heard of before them, in cruelty, tyrany and oppression,
the which cannot be paralelled; which I hope you who now fits at the Stern of
these Nations are not ignorant of, therefore did the Lord suddenly appear,
(even when Protector, Parliament and Priest had joined together to take Counsel
against the Lord and his anointed) and in a short time rebuked and overturned
them and their Counsels who stopped their ears at the cry of the oppressed, and
would not regard the chosen of the Lord whom he sent often to them to try their
hearts and to warn them in love and tenderness while the power was in their
hands to take off the oppression and exactions from his people, but when they
had refused time after time, the Lord scattered them as chaff, and dashed all
their glory in one day, by bringing to naught all their Counsels which was not
right in his sight; and all this has been done by his right hand for the
establishing of righteousness in the land, and for the preservation of his
chosen ones whom the gates of hell shall not prevail against.

Theresore now be awakened and warned all you unto whom the government of these
Nations is now committed, let the dread and fear of God be upon every one of
you with whom there is no respect of persons or taking of gifts, take heed, oh
take heed how you tread in the steps of them that are gone before, for know
assuredly that God will not pass by that in you which he has condemned in
them before you; therefore has God chosen you, to try your hearts also,
whether they be right in his sight, which if they so be found, he will bless
and prosper you in whatsoever you take in hand, and your enemies shall dread
before you, and shall not be able to gainsay nor withstand you, but all their
Counsels and plottings against you shall be suddenly confounded and the Lord
will crown you with dominion over all your enemies.

So let this suffice you, oh ye Princes of England, remove violence and spoil,
and take the exactions from the people of God, and fear not man whose breath is
in his nostrils, for the earth is filled with violence and grievous spoilers
is, and has been in the Land, who has not spared the flock of God, yea they
who have reproved sin in the gate has been greatly made a prey upon by them
who are inwardly ravening wolves.

Now if these things be not removed by you (who now has power in your hands)
the Lord remove you and overturn you as: he has done them before you; for a
short work in the earth will the Lord now make and will overturn, overturn all,
till he come to reign whose right it is, who will break every yoke from every
neck and relieve the oppressed; for besides many great oppressions in this
Land, the oppression of Tithe is the most cruel and Antichristian, especially
to them that professes to live under the Gospel; what a violence and spoil has
been in this Land within this few years by upholding that oppression? how has
the ravening wolves made a prey upon the Lambs of Christ who for conscience
sake could not uphold that cruel oppression of Tithe? which all the Priests in
England is never able to prove by Scripture that ever Tithe was due to the
Ministers of the Gospel by the Law of God; for within this late days I had a
meeting with some of the highest of them, and it was desired of me and several
hundreds of the free born people of England, that they would prove by Scripture
that Tithe was due to the Ministers of the Gospel by the Law of God, and Tithe
should be paid unto them without any further ado, but this they were not able
to do, but laid aside the Scripture and the Law of God, and fled to the powers
of the earth, saying, that it was confirmed by so many Parliaments from age to
age, and so it was become a custom; this is the Priests plea, when they have
no Scripture to uphold their Autichristian practices, which the Lords hand is
against, they make the Parliaments a cloak for their wickedness; but take heed,
I warn you who now are assembled in Parliament, how this is covered any longer
by you, for they that cover iniquity shall not prosper, and he that sees evil
and consents to it, shall be confounded and brought to shame.

So beware how this iniquity is countenanced by you; let not the false Prophets
make you their cloak for their coveteous practices, for I believe there is few
so blind but they see tithes Antichristian under the administration of the
Gospel, unless it be the blind guides whose mouth is put into; yea, many of
them dare not to say that it is according to the Law of God, though for a long
time they affirmed it was, but now it begins to be so manifest to all, that
they are ashamed of that, and says it is given them by act of Parliament; oh*
away with this mire and filth, throw it out of your house, least it bring a
curse upon you and your posterity for ever.

For the spirit of the Lord will not always strive with you, nor the mouths of
his messengers always be opened to warn you, but the time comes suddenly (If
you will not hear and lay these things to heart to relieve the oppressed) that
you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord, and this is
the word of the Lord unto you all.

And furthermore what a talk has been, and care been taken for maintaining of
godly and painful Ministers, which if it had been so indeed, it had been well,
but the contrary is much manifested, as concerning godliness; if it be the
Priests that preach for hire, that is meant, their own mouths (within these
late days) has made them all Liars who calls them godly, For they have
confessed themselves to be wicked and ungodly in the hearing of many people,
and that the very sins of their prayers were able to bring the judgments of
God upon this Nation; this was at one of their fasts for the violation of
times, as they said, and confessed themselves, That they came together to pray
against sin, with as bad hearts as they did commit it, and spoke against the
present powers, and said, they tolerated deceivers, and prayed to put a curb
in their nostrils, and much more of their filthy stuff, which is too tedious
to mention. Now if these and such like be called godly Ministers, who then is
wicked and ungodly? let the witness of God in all consciences judge.

And it is not an unknown to many thousands of the good people of this
Commonwealth, the covetous practices, and ungodly deeds of these and such like,
that is, and has been called godly Ministers, how that they have caused many
to err by their unsavory conversation and unholy walking, living in all manner
of Iacivousness, so that none is able to turn from the evil of their ways. Oh
consider of it and lay it to heart, For the cry of the oppressed is great; my
soul is even loaded and oppressed to hear it, how great is the complaint in
every Town and City of the hireling Priests by all sorts of people? yet they
that work so much wickedness is set up and called godly Ministers, when their
daily practice shows the contrary to all that is not wilsully blind; and I
believe some of you are not ignorant, How that within these late days such were
joined together with the powers of the earth to bring the Nation into misery
and slavery, if the Lord bad not mightily appeared, and suddenly confounded
their counsels (for his chosens sake.) and ^tered the wicked as chaff; and
shall such always be set up and called godly Ministers, and be maintained in
deceit and wickedness? Oh I warn you once again to take heed what you do in
this thing; For the Lord will not always be mocked, nor suffer the oppressed
always to cry unto him and not lend his ear unto them.

Will not these company of Priests come cringing and bowing to you now for
their bellies, which is their god, and flatter you as they have done them
before you? and if you lend your car unto them, they will lead you to
destruction as they have done many before you; therefore let them he called
together and proved by the Scripture, whether they be godly or no before us and
you, and tried as Baals Priests were, and if they so be found in the doctrine
of Christ, they will be content with the same wages, which they who were sent
forth by Christ had, which I hope none that fears God will deny; but if they be
found contrary to the doctrine, and out of the true Apostles practice (as their
daily practice manifests) then let them be testified against and denied of all,
Least Gods judgment come upon this Land because of the iniquity of Priests and
people, for the land is almost full of adulterers, and because of oaths the
land mourns, and the pleasant places is dried up; For that which formerly was
in a measure dest oyed is now beginning to be set up again, both by Priests and
people; as Herbert Morley one of the Rulers in the County of Sussex, professed
openly upon the bench in Lewis, That he had rather that Prelacy were up again
then that the truth should appear, which he called bables; this was spoken in
the hearing of many witnesses: And John Fagg another of the Rulers of that
County (who formerly in the appearance stood for the Nations freedom from
Kingly power) has been known (within this late years) to have Cavaliers often
to resort to his house to gaming and sporting and Hunting, and feasting, and
rioting in the time called Christmas, which formerly was denied, this may be
witnessed by good testimony, which if these (and more which might be mentioned)
go on, the Nations will soon be brought to misery; therefore look about you
while you have time, for they are not your greatest enemies that deals most
plainly with you, The Lord give you an understanding to know the truth, and
your friends from your foes.

Another Priest whose name is Robert Baker of Rottingden in Sussex who has
received hire of that people near this thirty years, said in the Pulpit within
this late days in the hearing of several witnesses, That he and his hearers
were worse then the damned spirits that now lay roaring and yelling in Hell,
and that their sins did exceed many of theirs that were now in infernal misery,
and said that they were fruitless trees* yet not with standing, he the said
Baker has from year to year taken the peoples money, and has not profited
them at all, yet he is set up and called a godly Minister amongst the rest, and
had power given him within this late days to take twelve Oken, six Cows and a
Boll, worth near an hundred and twenty pounds for one years Tithe of land, that
the rent of that land is about an hundred pounds per annum from a friend, whose
name is Nicholas Beard, and returned nothing again.

Will not the cry of this and such like cruelty reach to heaven? Surely the
Lord will visit for these things, and his soul will be avenged on such a
Nation as this; Was not Zion ploughed as a field? And did not Jerusalem become
on heaps because of these things? Was ever any Nation so deeply involved in
iniquity by a company of hireling Priests, as this Nation? and yet these go
under the Sheeps covering and are called godly Ministers, Oh read the
Scriptures and be not wilsully blind, least it be said of England as it was of
Jerusalem, Oh how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a Hen
gathers her chickins under her wings (mark under her wings) but ye would not;
therefore shall your enemies cast a trench about you and compass you on every
side, because you have despised the day of your visitation, and rejected the
counsel of God to your own destruction.

Therefore with speed, Let all grievances be removed, and set men over the
people that will execute judgment in the gate, that the land may be cleansed
of evil doers, and lend your ear and show mercy to the poor and oppressed, who
has long laid under the heavy yoke of bondage; for if you suffer that
oppression to stand in the land, for which God overturned them bofore you, the
Lord will overturn you likewise.

So that which will make you truly honorable and truly noble, is to search out
every matter of wrong, without respect to any person, and to regulate these
things which has long been amiss, and to be a terror to all evil doers
whatsoever; and to set over the people men to rule that truly fears. God and
hates covetousness, that they may rule for God and not wholly for man, as it
has been this many years; for gifts and rewards has blinded both. Priest,
Lawyers and people, and has perverted the way of the just which has kindled
the indignation of God against this land, which cannot be quenched until the
streams of righteousness and true judgment run down this Land; so while you
have time and power in your hands, consider of the oregoing lines which is
written in true and perfect love to the seed of God in you all;

By a friend of the Commonwealth of England called A. R.
THE END.
