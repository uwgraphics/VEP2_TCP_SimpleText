Cheap Side, near Mercers Chapel, 1673.

A PROTESTANT Catechism for little CHILDREN, etc.
1. Q. WHat Miracles is your Religion confirned by?

A. Divine, Mark. 16, 17, 18.20. These signs shall follow them that believe:
in my Name shall they cast out Devils, they shall speak with new Tongues, they
shall take up Serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
them. And they went forth, and preached every where. The Lord working with
them, and confirming the Word with signs following.

2. Q. What confirmation has the Popish way?

A. Devilish. 2 Thessalonians. 2.9. After the working of Satan, with all Powers, and
Signs, and lying Wonders.

3. Q. Are the Apocrypha Books to be owned as Gods Word?

A. No. Pro. 30.5, 6. Every word of God is pure: add thou not unto his words,
least he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.

4. Q. Is the Scripture sufficient for us without unwritten Traditions?

A. Yes. 2. Tim. 3.16, 17. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
good works.

5. Q. Is it fit for the common people to read the Scriptures?

A. Yes. Acts 17.11, 12. These were more noble then those in Thessalonica, in
that they received the Word with all readyness of mind, and searched the
Scriptures daily, whether those things were so. Therefore many of them believed.

6. Q. Are we bound to own the Popes interpretation of Scripture?

A. No. 2 Pet. 1.20, 21. knowing this first, that no Prophecy of the Scripture
is of any private interpretation: for the Prophecy came not in old time by the
will of Man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

7. Q. Are all things necessary to Salvation plainly to be found in Scripture?

A. Yes. 2 Timothy 3.15. From a Child thou have known the holy Scriptures, which
are able to make thee wise unto salvation.

8. Q. Is the Church of Rome Mother and Mistress of all Churches?

A. No. Gal. 4.26. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the Mother of
us all.

9. Q. Ought we firmly to receive and embrace all customs and constitutions of
the Roman Church?

A. No. Acts 15.28, 29. For it seemed good unto the holy Ghost, and to us, to
lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: that ye abstain
from Meats offered to Idols, and from blood, and from thingsstrangled, and from
Fornication.

10. Q. Ought all things delivered by the council of Trent to be undoubtedly
received?

A. No. 1 Timothy 4.1, 2, 3. The spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter
times some shall depart from the Faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and
doctrines of Devils; speaking lies in Hipocricy, having their conscience seared
with a hot Iron: forbiding to Marry.

11. Q. Is outward prosperity a note of the true Church?

A. No. 1. Cor. 15.19. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of
all men most miserable.

12. Q. Do you not dread the Popes Bulls?

A. No. Mar. 16.16. He that believes, and is baptized, shall be saved.

13. Q. Has the Pope Authority to depose Kings?

A. No. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14, 15. Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for
the Lords sake; whether it be to the King as supreme, or unto Governors, as
unto them that are sent by him, for the punishment of evil doers, and for the
praise of them that do well. For so is the will of God.

14. Q. May the Pope absolve us from our Oath of Allegiance?

A. No. Ecc. 8.2. Keep the Kings commandment, and that in regard of the Oath of
God.

15. Q. May the Pope dispense with Gods Commands?

A. No. Mat. 5.19. Whosoever shall break one of these least Commandments, and
shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven.

16. Q. Have Peterpence their Original from Peter?

A. No. Acts 3.6. Peter said, Silver and Gold have I none.

17. Q. Is the Praelate of Rome Peter's Successor?

A. No. Gal. 2.7, 8, 9. But contrariwise, when they saw, that the gospel of the
Uncircumcision was committed unto Me, as the gospel of the Circumcision was unto
Peter: (for he that wrought affectually in Peter to the Apostilship of the
circumcision; The same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles.) And when James,
Cephas, and John, who seemed to be Pillars, perceived the grace that was given
unto me, they gave to Me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we
should go unto the Heathen, and they unto the Circumcision.

18. Q. Is there on Earth, one visible head of the Church?

A. No. Ephesians. 4.4, 5, 6. There is one Body, and one Spirit, even as you are
called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God
and Father of All.

19. Q. Is the Popedom an office in the Ministry?

A. No. Ephesians. 4.11, 12. He gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some

for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.

20. Q. Is the Pope rightly termed His Holiness?

A. No. 2 Th. 2.3. That man of sin.

21. Q. Is the Popes power from God or from Satan?

A. Satan, Rev. 13.2. The Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great
Authority.

22. Q. Are the Clergy exempt from under the civil Jurisdiction?

A. No. Romans 13.1. Let every soul be subject unto the higher Powers: for there
is no Power but of God.

23. Q. Is it fit that Ministers should be Married?

A. Yes. 1 Timothy 3.2.4. A Bishop must be blameless, the Husband of one Wife,
having his Children in subjection.

24. Q. Do you approve of munkish Vows of single life?

A. No. 1 Cor. 7.9. If they cannot contain, let them Marry: for it is better to
marry than to burn.

25. Q. Are the Popish Festivals to be approved?

A. No. Gal. 4.9, 10. How turn you again to the weak and beggarly Elements,
whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? Ye observe Days, and Months, and
Times, and Years.

26. Q. Do you forbear flesh Meats on the Popish fasting days?

A. Nay. 1 Timothy 4.4, 5. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be
refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the Word
of God, and Prayer.

27. Q. May we worship Angels?

A. No. Rev. 22.8, 9. I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel,
which showed me these things. Then says he unto me, see thou do it not: for I
am thy fellow Servant, and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep
the sayings of this Book: worship God.

A. No. Ex. 20.4, 5. Thou shall not make unto thee any graven Image, or any
likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath,
or that is in the Water under the Earth. Thou shall not bow down thy self to
them, nor serve them: For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the
iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation
of them that hate me.

30. Q. Do the Papists well in leaving out the second Commandment?

A. No. Deu. 4.13. He declarded unto you his Covenant, which he commanded you
to perform. Even Ten Commandments, and he wrote them upon two tables of Stone.

that Language?

A. No. 1 Cor. 14.14, 15. For if I pray in an unknown Tongue, my Spirit
prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is it then? I will pray with
the spirit, and will pray with the understand also.

we love the brethren.

38. Q. Is salvation to be attained by the Merits and Grace of Saints departed?

A. No. Gal. 6.4, 5. But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he
have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. For every man shall bare
his own burden.

39. Q. Are the souls of the deceased helped by the suffrages of the faithful?

A. No. Luke 12.58, 59. When thou go with thine Adversary to the Magistrate;
as thou art in the way, give diligence, that thou may be delivered from him,
lest he hale thee to the Judge, and the Judge deliver thee to the Officer, and
the Officer cast thee into Prison. I tell thee, thou shall not depart thence,
till thou have paid the very last Mite.

40. Q. Are there works of Superrogation.

A. No. Mat. 22.37, 38, 39, 40. Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy

great Commandment, and the second is like unto it. Thou shall love thy
Neighbor as thy Self. On these two Commandments hang all the Law and the
Prophets.

44. Q. Can we deserve Salvation?

A. No. Romans 3.27, 28. Where is boasting then! it is excluded. By what Law of
works? Nay, by the Law of Faith. Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified
by Faith, without the deeds of the Law.

A. No. 1 Pet. 1.18. For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
corruptible things, as Silver and Gold.

are sanctified.

49. Q. Ought they which have right to the Lords Table, to partake of the Cup,
as well as of the Bread?

A. Yes. Mat. 26.26, 27. As they were eating, Jesus took Bread, and blessed it,
and brake it, and gave it to the Disciples, and said, Take, Eat, this is my
Body. And he took the Cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, drink
ye all of it.

50. Q. Does the Bread in the Communion remain Bread after the words of
Consecration?

A. Yes. 1 Cor. 11.26, 27, 28. For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink
this Cup, ye do show the Lords death till he come: wherefore, whosoever shall
eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthyly, shall be guilty of
the Body and Blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him
eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.

51. Q. Is Rome styled Babylon in the Revelation?

A. Yea. Rev. 17.3.5.9.18. I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet-colored Beast,
full of names of Blasphemy, having seven Heads: and upon her forehead was a
name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and
Abomination of the Earth. The seven Heads are seven Mountains, on which the
Woman sits; and the woman which thou saw, is that great City which
reigns over the Kings of the Earth.

52. Q. May we join with Rome?

A. No. Rev. 18.4, 5. I heard a voice from Heaven, saying, come out of her my
People, that ye be not partakers of her Sins, and that ye receive not of her
Plagues. For her sins have reached unto Heaven, and God has remembered her
iniquities.

FINIS.
