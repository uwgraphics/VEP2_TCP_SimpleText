ORDERS To be ^^^^^^ved at the CORONATION OF THE KING and QUEEN. Published by
Order of the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England, etc.
THese are to give notice to all the Peers, and Peeresses, that are to Attend
in the Proceeding at the Coronation of the KING and QUEEN, on the 23d. day of
this instant April, That it is His Majesty's pleasure, that They, and every of
Them, forbear to set, or use, any Jewels, or precious Stones, in their Coronets.

And whereas Coach-makers, Carvers, Embroiderers, Painters, or other
Artificers, do presume (both upon Coaches, and in making the Coronets for this
present Coronation) to raise the Pearls of the Barons and Baronesses Coronets,
upon Pins, or Spikes, (whereas they ought to lie flat upon the Rimm, or Ring,
of the Coronet:) This is to warn all such Workmen from the like Error, and to
Enjoin and Order them to take care to make all such Coronets exactly as they
are allowed to be worn, (by the Grant from the late King CHARLES the Second of
Blessed Memory) as they will Answer the contrary at their Perils.

And it is also Ordered, That no Person whatsoever (that shall be present at
the said Coronation, either Attending the Proceeding, or as Spectators,) do
appear in Mourning Habit for that Day.

I do appoint these Orders to be Printed.

Given under my Hand the 7th. day of April, 1685. Norfolk and Marshal.

London: Printed for John Smith, Bookseller in Covent Garden, 1685.
