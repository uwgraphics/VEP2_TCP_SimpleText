Religious Relics, Or, the SALE at the SAVOY; upon the JESUITS Breaking up
their SCHOOL and CHAPEL.
[1]
LAst Sunday, by chance,
I Encountered with Prance,
That Man of Upright Conversation,
Who told me such News,
That I could not choose
But Laughed at his sad Declaration.
[2]
Says he, if you will go,
You shall see such a Show
Of Relics Exposed to be Sold,
Which from Sin and Disease
Will Purge all that please.
To lay out their Silver and Gold.
[3]
Straight with him I went,
Being Zealously bent,
Where for Sixpence the Man let me in,
But the Crowd was so great,
I was all in a Sweat
Before the Rare Show did begin.
[4]
The Curtain being drawn,
Which I think was of Lawn,
The PRIEST Cros'd himself thrice, and bowed;
Then with a sour Face,
Denoting his Case,
He addressed himself thus to the Crowd.
[5]
You see our sad State,
It Is a folly to prate,
Our Church and our Cause is a-ground;
So in short, if you have Gold,
Here is to be Sold
For a Guinny the worth of Ten Pound.
[6]
Here Is St. James's old Bottle,
It holds just a Pottle,
With the Pilgrims Habit he wore;
The same Scollop shells,
As our Holy Church tells,
Who denis it is the Son of a Wh --
[7]
Here Is a piece of the Bag,
By Age turned to a Rad,
In which Judas The Money did bear;
With a part of his Rope,
Bequeathed to the POPE,
As an Antidote against all despair.
[8]
Here Is a Rid of St. Lawrence,
It Is also at Florence,
And it may be in France, or in Spain;
It Cures Stone and Gravel,
And Women in Travel
It delivers without and Pain.
[9]
Here Is St. Joseph's old Coat,
Though scarce worth a Groat,
Its plainness does show he would no Pride;
Yet this he had on,
For besides it he would none,
The day that he Married his Bride.
[10]
His Breeches are there,
A plain Leather Pair,
Come Buy the whole Suit, if you please;
They Will defend you from the Itch,
From Hag and from Witch,
And preserve you from Bugs and from Fleas.
[11]
Here Is the Gall of a Saint,
For such as do faint,
Or are troubled with Fits of the Mother;
Nay, if your Breath stink,
Worse than Close-stool or Sink,
It will Cure you as soon as the other.
[12]
Here Is a Prayer of Pope John,
The like to it is none,
If you say it but three times a year;
Three hundred in grace,
And three hundred 'twill place
In Heaven, if they ever come there.
[13]
Here Is our Lady's old Shoo,
Which in Old-time was new,
It will Cure all your Kibes and your Corns;
With the Coyfe of St. Bridget,
To be worn by each Idiot,
Whose Head is tormented with Horns.
[14]
Here Is Bottle of Tears,
Preserved many years,
Of Mary's that once was a Sinner;
Some of the Fish and the Bread
That the Five Thousand fed,
Which our Savior Invited to Dinner.
[15]
Here Is St. Francis own Cord,
You may take it on my word,
Who dies in it cannot be Damned
Do but buy it, and try,
If I tell you a lie,
Many Thousands of Heaven are shamm'd.
[16]
Here Is his Holiness's Bread,
Of whom you have heard,
That the Heretics called Pope Joan,
Yet this I dare Swear
Was his natural Hair,
Or else I Will be Sworn he had none.
[17]
Its Virtue is such,
That if it does touch
Your Head, or your Face, or elsewhere,
It does strait-way Restore
More than e're was before,
Though by Age or by Action worn bare.
[18]
Here Is St. Christopher's Boot,
For his Right Leg and Foot,
Which he wore when he plied at the Ferry,
When on's Shoulders he bore
His Blessed Lord over,
For the Poor Man had never a Wherry.
[19]
Such as Sail on the Seas,
I am sure it will please,
For its parrallel never was found;
Neither Tempest nor Storm
Can e're do 'em harm,
Nor is it possible they shoul'd be drowned.
[20]
Here Is infinite more,
I have by me in stone,
All which lie concealed in this Hamper;
Either buy 'em to day,
Or I Will throw 'em away,
For to morrow, by Heaven, I Will scamper.
[21]
Our Marker is done,
We must Shut up at Noon,
We expect 'em each hour at the Door;
We are Hanged if we stay,
And we cannot get away,
For none will, nor dare carry us over.
[22]
But by the Faith of a PRIEST,
This is no time to jest,
Since we are Balked in our great Expectations;
Before I will Swing
Like a Dog in a String,
I Will Renounce the Transubstantiation.
