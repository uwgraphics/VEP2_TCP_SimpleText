A PARLIAMENT OF LADIES: WITH THEIR LAWS NEWLY ENACTED.



Printed in the year 1647.

A PARLIAMENT of LADIES, with their Laws newly Enacted.
PApirius was the name of diverse noble Romans: one whereof had to surname
Praetextatus: the reason was, because in his youth he had the understanding of
an Elder; who being a child, and carried by his Father into the Senate, where
they were to debate and determine of weighty Affairs concerning the State of
Rome: his Mother at his coming home, asked the Boy what was the cause of their
so often meeting, and what was concluded in the Senate that day? which he
apprehending, that he was not to reveal, remained silent; but his Mother
further importuning him, and threatening him, with the rod, that unless he
would acquaint her with all their proceedings, she would whip him soundly: both
to avoid the prejudice that might happen, if he should have revealed the
Secrets of the Senate, and to satisfy his Mother for the present, he told her,
that they had made a Decree, and established it, that it should be lawful for
every man to have two Wives. Upon which, she presently without any more ado,
sent to the chief Matrons in Rome, that it would please them to vouchsafe to
come to her house, and she would acquaint them with such a Project that her
Husband and theirs had done in the Senate House that day, and to their
prejudice, as wanted president or example.

At which Summons, many or most of them gave her a Visit, where she reveaied
unto them the whole Business, as it was repeated by her young Son Papirius,
and desired their assistance how to prevent it, and for that, to enter into
present Consultation how they might abrogate that Law, and instead thereof,
that every woman might have two Husbands: this was no sooner noysed in the
City, but it was presently bruted in the Suburbs, and before they could propose
any thing to be concluded, there was a great noise of rapping at the Door; they
sending to know the cause thereof, answer was returned them, that there were a
great many of Tradesmens wives, who understanding the causy of that meeting,
desired to have their voices in the Counsel; alleging withal, that though
the Matrons were Noble, and they but Mechanics and poor Tradesmens wives, yet
no Parliament could be held, but there must be a Lower House, as well as a
Higher, and Speakers for both: and further, that nothing could be concluded in
the higher, but it must first be debated in the lower: Upon which reasons they
were admitted, and a great Parlour serving for a Parliament House, every one
took their places according to their degrees: and which was a wonder among
Women, they suffered one to speak at once, which was the Mother of Papirius,
who said as follows.

To you, as well of the Manufacture as of the Matronship, I speak to all in
general, I have known a Lord contented with one Lackey, a Master with one
Man, a Tenant with one Landlord, a Bird with one Mate, a Cow with one
Milk-maid, and shall a man desire to have two Wives, that (alas) with all he
can do, can hardly please one? nay, grant them two, in time they will grow to
ten, from ten to twenty, and then what a racket there would be, who should rule
the Roast? nay, I have heard of one that had once a thousand Wives and
Concubines: Now out upon him for a Jew (said a second) and taking the tale out
of her mouth, thus proceeded: Methinks they should have consulted, that women
might have had two strings to their Bow, that if one slipped the other might
hold; one for week days to drudge within doors, another for holy days to walk
abroad with her, and usher her in his best clothes; keeping one for delight,
the other for her drudgery, to which motion, they with an unanious voice
consented. Then up starts a third, and said, our Sex is now of late grown
Cowards, carpet and curtainehearted: Where be those magnanimous and Masculine
spirited Matrons? those valiant Viragoes? those lusty Ladies: those daring
Amazonian Damsels, Orithena, Penthisilaea, Thalestres, and the rest, who made
Coxcombes of Keysars, Puppets of Princes, Captives of Captains, Fools of
Philosophers, and Henchmen of their husbands? but though we want weapons, and
are abridged of their arms, yet they shall know, that we have the Law in our
own hands, and in our own cases we will be our own Lawyers, and plead our own
rights. For we have tongues to tell our own Tales, and our Tales shall be
heard and handled, when some of theirs shall not: What, give these Cocks leave
to crow, and we shall have the Ravens follow after.

These words were spoke with such an Emphasis, that there was a general hum
throughout all the Parliament parlour: then there was a motion made, that every
one for the present should put in a particular of their own grievances: First,
upstarts one Mis. Rattle, a Tailors wife, and said, I think the Proverb may be
very well verified in my husband; which is, that many Tailors go to the making
up of one man; for he has no more mettle in him then a Mous, he works
altogether with hot needle, and burnt thread; for nothing he does prospers with
me. I think the reason is, because he uses an unlawful Yard, and wants that
handful which belongs to the City measure, or else because he sits cros-legd
on his shop-bord, like a dead Hare on a Poulterers stall, and no good work can
be done that way. If at any time he make me a new Peticoat, he will threaten to
sit upon my skirts, and that's all: He will sow and sow, and yet when he has
done all he can, it proves but so and so, and with that she put finger in the
eye and wept.

Nay, another Gossip seeing and pit^ying the poor puling creature, rose up, and
said, I take it, your best course Mistress Rattle, is to acquaint your self
with some Courtier his Customer, and when any Masque or show is to be presented
at Court, he may help you to a good standing. Then another starts up and said,
my name is Frank Fal-down, a Felt-makers wife, and know no more from my husband
of the three parts that belong to a Noun-Substantive but the first, and that is
felt, and nothing else worthy to be heard or understood. Sisly the Sadlers wife
sat next. Nay, you may take me too in your number, for my case is as much to be
condoled as any's who have a very pea-goose and Patch-pannel to my good man:
well his girths or latchets may pass for current, but I could never see a good
stir-up from him since he was my husband: I confess he is saddle-nos'd and
saddlebackt too, but never could set the saddle on the right horse since I knew
him; to whom the Hors-coursers wife called Hairbrain, replied, my good man in
his customer, who keeps the saddle to himself, but gives me the bit and the
bridle; he can teach his horses to pace as he list, but for himself he has
neither good amble, trot, nor gallop.

After them Grace the Goldsmiths wife, Sarah the Silkemans, Kate the
Comfit-makers, Beatrice the Brasiers, Parnell the Apo^^^caries, Maudlin the
Masons, Winifred the Wyre-drawers, Dorothy the Drapers, etc. every one laid
down their several grievan^^^; which as they were attentively heard, so they
were much to be commiserated (I am loath to insist on too many, therefore for
brevities sake let these suffice for the rest) then consulation was had how to
rectify what was amiss, for the general good of their Sects, how to rest the
power in men from wronging their wives, that thenceforward they might live in
the more ease, pride, pomp, and liberty; for which they thought fit that good
and wholesome Laws should be enacted.

The fifth was Mrs. Tattle-well that spak, who said, that it was not only
fitting but necessary, that every woman should have two husbands; for said she,
was not every woman born with two legs, two hands, two eyes, two ears; and
every deep Well ought to have two Buckets, while one is coming up, the other
going down: have not most great houses two doors? likewise have not most
Tavernes a fore-door and a back-doore, with two signs and two bushes, every
ship a Foremast and a Mainmast; most Cities two or three gates, and every
gate three or four Watchmen; and every Beadle three or four men every night
in his Lanthorn, or else their money? has not every stool or chair three or
four legs, and every Bed stead two posts (and three or four Curtains) the
better to support the other parts of them; and therefore in conscience every
Woman may have two husbands; for have not we women six Senses, and men but
five? the major part we know includes the minor; therefore the case is clear on
our sides; for we have nothing to offend and defend our selves but our tongues,
which we bring in for another sense; for the tongue tells what the ear hears,
what the eye sees, what the hand handles, what the palate fasteth, what the nose
smeleth; therefore the tongue ought to be the six Sense* which we must maintain
for our own safety* though woman was taken out of the side of man, yet let, men
know, that they cannot, nor shall not always keep us under.

I put the case to you, suppose a handsome Less marries a Seafaring man,
perehance his occasions call him to go a long voyage to Sea, as to the East or
West Indies, or to the straights of Magellan, the reed or Red Sea, or to the
Persian gulf; he is bound to stay a year, two or three, before he can
return; do you (nay prithee good sister, let me not be interrupted in my
speech: pray silence, or I will say no more; for I now speak to the purpose) as
I have said do you think it convenient such a pretty soul should lie alone,
having been wedded so short a time, and only tasted of you know what, and
having been a fellowfeeler and helper in most cases, for the Commonwealths
good, that she can be content to lie alone tumbling and tossing in a good
featherbed, sometimes to the wall, sometimes to the door, sometimes of one
side, and sometimes of the other; sighing and groaning, as if her very
twatling-strings would break; making her moan to the curtains, fumbling and
biting, or tearing the sheets, and by that means ease her oppressed body and
mind; nay, I should not say oppressed body, for there I was mistaken, there my
tongu went too fast* I should have said her troubled and perplexed spirit,
heart, on what you term it, ought not* I say, such a woman to have two
Husbands? Yes, yes, said they, being always provided, and for the good of the
Commonwealth: So likewise the Soldier and Captain when they are gone to the
Wars, the Merchant, the Factor and the Mariner when they are gone to Sea, a
foolish Plaintiff and his Defendant that will come up Post two or three
hundred miles to spend his money, and stay a whole Term before he return to
his beloved: ought not these (and many more which I could name, which for
brevities sake I omit) to leave one Husband at home, while the other, being at
Sea; looks to the maine boling, and that the foremast, and main-yard, and all
other tackling be fit and complete for his occasions: The Factor while he looks
to cast up his Accounts abroad, she may look and cast up here at home: The
Plaintiff and Defendant while they be spending money at Law, she may get some
at home by Love. All these cases are to be considered; for every Musket must
have a Scouring-stick, and every Gun must have a Rammer, and every pen must be
dipped in Ink before it will write: Has not every Constable his Beadle, every
Sergeant his Yeoman? has not every Officer in a Ship his Mate? as the
Surgeon he has his Mate, the Master his Mate, and the Gunner his Mate: It
is good to have two strings to ones Bow, if one break the other may hold: that
if one be dogged and surly, the other may be pleasant and joviall; that while
one be off the hooks, the other may be on the hinges: Upon which motion it is
fully agreed upon by us Women, who are here present, which find i^ better for
us women to have 2 husbands, that if one be sick, the other may be well, one
abroad, another at home: and this was Mis Tabitha Tireman, and al giving out it
may be a great means to abolish the old custom of making cuckolds: ere she
could proceed, they all cried it up for eurra^t. But let me tell you one thing,
which might put a rub in our way: what if our husbands object and say, that we
promised to love and obey them at the time of our marriage, and that we must be
tied to that promise? By our Lady that is true, said they, what must be our plea
for that? I Will tell you, said Mis Tatle-well, let us answer thus much in that
behalf; that we had a mental reservation, when the wisest of us said so; for
though our husbands expect it at our hands all our lifetime, we must say, that
we meant it only for that day and the first night, and no longer; and therefore
by this means we may wave the business, and repeal that Law: whereupon they al
agreed to it by general consent, and a great commendation bestowed on Mis
Tatle-well for finding out this mystery and evasion, which was set down at first
by these men by way of error and mistake. Then Mis Prudence Prate-al said, let
it be likewise enacted, that since Maids for the most part marry in haste, and
repent at leizure, that we may be hasty also in our own houses, that if our
husbands be peevish, we may pout; when they are harsh we may be humorous; they
cursed we crabbed; and when they think to make us melancholy, we in requital
strive to make the^ horn-mad* by making our peticoats our purlewes: at which if
they grudge or grumble, we may find answers by looking on our apron-strings;
knowing by experience that most men are of a strange kidny, and will never be
quiet full nor fasting; this also past among the rest. The next that spoke in
court was a mad wench, called Besse Blue, or Blot-book a Scrivners wife, who
also desired, that one thing might be rectified concerning her husbands trade,
that in all Contracts, Covenants and Jointures made betwixt bachelors and maids,
widows and widowers the often word Notwithstanding, may be razed out, and
instead thereof, Always provided as often put in: the want of whch reformation,
said she, I have endured to my prejudice: to this they generally consented and
desired it might be pricked down with an Imprimimis. In then comes Mi Elenor
Ever-crosse with her five eggs, and said, she desired to have another added,
which should not be addl'd: my husba^nd, said she, in anger said, he would thump
me; to wh^^^ answered, thump me? where will thou thump me? thump me but where
th^^^ should thump me, or i will make it the dearest thu^ping that ever thou
d^^^ thump in thy life: and I think I hink I hit him home, which was more th^^
ever he did to me, and then I had him on the hip: and you should have kept him
so when you had him there (replied Mary Malepart) if you had bin wise: But
concerning your great thumpers, concerning him who said that a Law might be
made, that no woman should suffer her self to be thumpt but as she ought to
be; to whom the whole Court willingly condiscended.

Thus said Mistress Dorothy Doe-little, I hold it requisite also, that every
woman of sense should take delight to please her eye with the most curious
objects, either of such pictures as we like, or such men as we love: Her ear
rather with curious and choice Music, or have some Courtship that may content
her, or somewhat published in her praise: Her smell rather with sweet and
redolent flowers at home, or precious odours and perfumes fetched from abroad:
Her touch either with the Pluch and Taffates of her own gay garments, or by
the griping of his smooth and soft hand whom she most dearly affected: Her
taste with all dainty and dear fare, with either Fowl or Fish, with sweet
Wines and sweet Meats, Banqueting and Junkets, and every variety that can
taste the appetite, or please the palate. And for our more ease, let us lie a
bed till ten of the clock, and then have a Caudle brought to our bed side, for
our breakfast; and be ready by Dinnertime, and then walk abroad to take the
air till Supper-time; and so spend the week about and if they ask the reason
thereof, tell them it must be so, because it must be so; and let them
understand, that Monday is Sundays brother, and that Tuesday is such another;
Wednesday they must go to Church and pray and Thursday is half holy day;
Friday it is too late to begin to spin, and Saturday all the world knows is
half holy day again.

You speak well in that, said Mistress Bridget Bold face: for why should we
toil and turmoyle for our horn-headed and hard headed husbands, and not taste
of the sweet as well as of the sour, of the gain as the pain, the pleasure
as the puzzle. If the Husbands be ours, then be their goods ours, their Lands
ours, their Cash and Coin ours, and all their movables, (howsoever seldom in
motion ours too) and at our command; then why should we be niggards, and not
spend freely of our own? or why, when they be prodigal abroad, should we be
penurious at home? nay, let us eat good fare, keep good fires, want nothing
that Women should have, good cat^s after good company: we can then bid any God*
speed without good gossips. It is fit we should be merry, so it fall within
compass of means: and for my own part, I make use of the old proverb;

Every good huswife, as soon as she is up*
Has her hand in the Cup*board* her nose in the Cup.
Which also was agreed upon with such an unanimous consent, that this Law above
the rest should be writ in great Letters, to distinguish them from the rest, as
best corresponding with most of their conditions. Further let it be enacted,
said Anne Ever-Crosse, that whosoever shall hereafter take a Wife, shall do it
with the intent to please her, serve her, and obey her: and the first day of
their Bridals, as a sign and token of duty to her, and all the rest, place
her at the upper end of the Table; or if she like not that place, put her in
the middle, and with his hat in his hand wait on her till she has half, or at
the most three quarters dined; and then (if he have leave) to sit down, which
must be done by her license* that he place himself at the lower end of the
Table, and make a short meal till they be ready to take away; and that at
Supper he do the like: and after that she go to Bed first* and rise last; and
not attempt any thing, but that stands with her good liberty and liking: and
this past amongst the rest for current.

Then rose up one Mistress* Rachel Rattlebooby, and said, I entreat that I may
have a finger in the pie too as well as the rest; a fools bolt (like my
husbands) is soon shot, and so is mine: When I was as well in health as any
here, I complained to my good man of my Heart and Head, my Liver and my Lungs;
and ^indeed) I know not of what: who coming home, said, Wife how do you do?
I answered, Sick, good man, very sick: then the fond Coxcomb bid me speak for
any thing I had a mind unto; for, says he, no question*but thou do breed: I,
I, said I, I do breed, but you never get me any thing: no* says he, who gets
it then? I told him again, that it was no matter to him who gets it; for sure,
said I, I may long and long, but shall be sure to come short of what I long for:
why, what do thou long for, said my husband? For that (quoth I) which is
beyond your reach, ywis: Silk Gown and Satin Petticoat of the fashion, an
Italian cut-work Handkerchief, and a black Bag, with all the appurtenances
thereto belonging. I but, said he, sweet Wife, these are above my Calling: Why
then, said I, mine own Calling shall serve, for the next gallant Player I will
call in, who, what he cannot add to the happiness of your memory, shall
strive to augment in your honorable state of Matrimony: And this she desired
to be registered amongst the rest; at which, some were unwilling that it should
pass, yet the major part were so fully bent, that it was set down by the
she-Scrivener in Paper, and after in Parchment, to be endorsed.

Mistress Tabitha Teare*sheet then stood up, and began to puff and snuff, and
said, she wondered why men should take so much upon them, when one woman is
able, upon her own knowledge, to bring ten of them, and take them one after
another, upon their knees: therefore, said she, add this to the other; let
women from hence-forward, if they be sh^eerish or shie, try it out with them
at sharp; or if beetle-headed and blockish, with blunter weapons.

But Mistress Dorcas Doe-little was out at that, saying, she loved her ease and
quiet, and said, that the safest way (as she thought) was to sleep in a whole
skin; yet, says she, my husband is a Gamester, and as he games abroad, so I
play at home: if he be at bowls, and kiss the Mistress, I can for recreation
play at Rubbers with his man: when he has bin all the day at Passage, and
Hazard, at night he comes home and plays with me at Doublets, Barrames-ace,
and Back-gammon: but I am sometimes even with him; for when he with his
sweet-hearts ventures his state at the hole, with his servant can pass away
the time at In and In.

After spoke Mistress Rachel Rattle-a-pace, and said, as I hold Mistress Dorcas,
that lawful which you do, so I hope, that I bringing my sack to the Mill, it
may be ground among the rest; that is, when our Husbands trouble us, we may
likewise torment them: if they fret, we frown; they grudge, we grumble; they
prate, we glout; they cross, we cursed; if they bend their brows, we may bend
our fists; and be they never so outrageous, we to carry no coals in any case.

But let it then be added (says she that sat next) that no reconcilement
without some reward, and no pardon may be granted without a new Gown and
Peticoat, which if demur'd upon, at the first or second demand, it shall be in
her choice to ask him the third: and if he cog and ofter to kiss you, and
tell you that he will kiss you, bid him take you about the middle and kiss
the heaviest end: or if he fail, she may read him a Juniper Lecture, as far
as the scope of her invention, or the scarcity of breath will give her leave.
Or if he, notwithstanding all this, be peevish and perverse* she may also
continue proud and peremptory, till she raise him into reconcilement* and make
him provide a Feast to entertain her Gossips, and make his peace that way.

And then said another, taking the tale out of her mouth; if she have a mind to
take the air, or walk to Green*goose Fair, or to any merry meeting, or
Market; if she desire his company, that he new black his shoes, and put on his
best Hat and Cloak to wait on her thither, ushering her before, or take her
gently by the arm, and lovingly to lead her: or if (for some reasons best
known to her self) she would have his absence, that be patiently put money in
her purse, and stay at home without grumbling.

All this while good Orders and Decrees with a general silence was observed,
which after grew to a mere confusion: for the rest having much matter to
utter, some got up to the tongues end* and had not the patience to stay the
time, and take their turns: but all of these who had not yet spoke,
tumultuously breaking out into clamor, every one desiring to be heard first,
and the more they were heard, the less they were understood: one cried out,
let not Maids stay from Marriage till they are troubled with the
greensicknesse: another said, that if their Husbands revelled in the Hall, they
might rule in the Kitchen; and if they offered to domineer, they might spoil
their meat in dressing; a third, that if their husbands came home drunk, they
might lock them out of doors, and whilst she took her rest in her Cabin,
leave him to take up his lodging in the kennell: a fourth, that if they prated
to be heard, they might pour a pisse-pot on their heads* and if after
complaint were made, they might answer, they meant neither murder nor
manslaughter, but what they did, was se* defendendo: with many others, to as*
little or no purpose* by reason of which acclamation and noise, the Session was
for that time to be dissolved; but after an O yes, silence being made, it was
concluded amongst them, that with those Articles agreed upon, they should
presently pass from thence to the State-house, and deliver up their grievances
to them.

But one thing we have forgot, said they, which is a main matter, that is, to
seek out cure for any old or young Cuckolds: then spoke Mistress Dorothy
Do-little, and said: my good man came home drunk the other day, and because I
should not see him in that manner, he hid himself in the house of special
Office, and there he began to ease his stomach, and lay about him like a Hog,
when he has eaten so much that he is ready to burst: and because I should not
hear him; he thrusts his head into the hole, and whether it was his large
Asses ears, or his Bull neck, I cannot tell, but he looked as if he had bin on
the Pillery. Upon which relation they all fell into a great laughter, and
withal concluded that it was his Horns.

For Acteon, said they, put his head out of the window well enough, but could
not get it back again, which was long of his Horns: this, said they, is your
husbands case. I pray you Mistress Tattle-well, said she, tell me, and the rest
of our sisters the cure and remedy for it. Thus you must do (said she) my dear
and loving sisters, because the effect lies at the heart, and the cause in the
head, you must first remove the cause, and the effect will follow. First, you
must carry down the grief by his Posteriors, which must be done by a medicine
that will both purge and comfort him at one and the same time; for desperate
diseases must have desperate cures: get I say, (I speak to you all, as well as
to you Mistress Doe-little) a gallon of the best Pump-water, such as will bear
the Patentees Crown-soap, that will scour well, then set it on the fire in a
brass Skellet, and put therein a good large bed-post, and let it boil till it
be dissolved to a jelly, then take it off the fire, and put three or four
sorts of spices in, as Cloves, Mace, Nut-megs: then take two or three ounces of
Suger-candy, two ounces of the Sirrup of heartsease and dainty Content, with an
ounce of Candid Forgetfulness, and Better Conceit, all this is cordial: then
when it is cool, put in a little Rubard, a little Coloquintida, a little
Stibium, and some gross and Long white Pepper, then let it boil softly, and
when so done, the next morning let the patient man drink it next his heart, and
keep him warm: but you must be careful that it be given him when the Moon is
near the full; not when she is forked or horned, lest you lose your labor and
cost: for the Moon loves horned people, which are sometimes like her self:
but when she is near the full, she is then indifferent, whether horned or not
horned, all is one to her, and therefore may then best be performed.

Now the inward remedy being applied, he must then observe the outward means:
he must conceit himself a Batchelour or Widdower again, as he was at the first
state when he came a wooing to her: then must he make himself a mourning suit
and cloak, and walk as demurely and as sad, as if his wife were dead indeed: he
must likewise be so well conceited of himself, as if no such thing had ever
been or thought of* then he must refrain her company; and the house where she
is, eight or ten days together, then begin to inquire of her, as if she were a
stranger to him, afterward visit her, and then send her presents, and make
much of her, then make good cheer, and when you are in a merry vein, ask her
if she can love you? then will she say presently, yes, if you can affect her:
then get a license, and forthwith marry her: that being done, see then if any
dare so much as point at you with their fingers, or call you Cuckold as
formerly they did, if they do, then have you the civil Law on your side to
punish them there, and an action at the Common Law for defamation, and their
punish their purses and body too; and this is the only cure for old and new
Cuckolds: and withal take notice, that this must be done when the Moon is
increasing, and in the second quarter, for it will help their business
forward, and cause them better to conclude their intended purposes: and this
being done, it was approved for a certain and approved remedy; and so they
both joining their hands and their hearts, as no doubt they had done before, he
promising that she should (seeing so great a cure had been wrought upon him,
with the regaining of his crdit and honesty) once again be received into his
love and favor; and she on the other side promising him to be obedient to all
his demands, and never again to pollute the Marriage Bed: striving to vilify
the old Proverb, Once a whore, and ever a whore.

And now (with no common pace) trudge these Parliamenters toward the
Senate House to have their grievances there known; who rapping at the door
where the Conscript Fathers were then in Council: the mother of Papyrius was
presently admitted, to deliver unto them the minds of the rest, which were
fairly written; which when they had read and understood, they were greatly
amazed; but after more narrowly sifting how all this business came about, some
laughed, some lowred, some it served for pleasure, to others for perplexity; but
in conclusion, they greatly condemned their wives levity and inconstancy, but
indulgently commended the Lads silence and taciturnity.

The chief Heads of the Ladies Laws.
FIrst, that instead of allowing men two wives, women, especially the stronger
and greater vessel, should have two or three husbands.

That women might vex, perplex, and any way torment their husbands.

That women may twang it as well as their husbands.

That women may feast, banquet and gossip, when and where they please.

Likewise it is thought fit and convenient by us* that all rich and stale
Batchelors do forthwith marry poor Widows that have no means to live on,
and so become Fathers the first day.

Item, That it is thought (...), that rich widows shall marry Gentlemen's
youngest sons that have no means to maintain themselves. Item, It is concluded
and fully agreed upon, that all women shall have their husbands Tenants at
will; and that* they shall do them Knights service, and have their homage paid
before every Sunrising, or at every weeks end, or at utmost between the
quarters, not a day longer to be deferred, unless it be in the Dogs days.
Item, Let our husbands remember, though it be a trick of them to forsake our
beds in the Dogs days, yet let them take notice their is no dogs nights, and
that it was at the first but a trick of their own invention to save their
labor and money too: which act we disallow of for ever. Item, That no Yeoman
or Husbandmen shall keep, or suffer to be kept in their house, Barn, or
Stable, any Cock or Cocks* that will not tread his Hens: especially, when the
Hens thrust their heads under the Cocks neck, etc. Item, That that man which
promises a pretty Maid a good turn* and does not perform it in 3. months, shall
lose his what do you call them. Item, That if any Jesuit return into our Land
again, being once banished, that he shall be gelt or libb'd, to avoid
jealousies of our husbands.
FINIS.
