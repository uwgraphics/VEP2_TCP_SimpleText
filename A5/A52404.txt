The Norfolk Gentleman his last Will and testament And how he committed the
keeping of his Children to his Brother, Who dealt most wicke ly by them: and
how God plagued him for it.
To the Tune of Rog^ro.


^^ ond^r well you parents dear
^^^ ^^ords that I shall write.
(...), story you shall hear,
^^ time has brought to light.
^ ^man of good account,
^ folk lived of late
wealth and riches did surmount
^^en of his ^ state,
^ he was and like to die,
^ that he could have,
^ by him as make did lie,
^^h possessed one grave.
^betweene these two was lost,
(...) to other kind,
(...) lid'd, in love they did
(...) babes behind.
(...) pretty Boy,
(...) ^eares old,
(...) ^ung then her,
(...) mould
(...) little son,
^
(...) ^ould come
which might not be contrould:
But if there Children chance to die
ere they to age should come,
Their Uncle should possess this wealth,
and so the Will did run.
Now Brother said the dying man
look to my Children dear,
Be good unto my Boy and Girl,
no friends I else have hear
To God and you I do ^ commend
my Children night and day,
A little time be sore we have
^ within this world to stay.
You must be father and mother both,
and Uncle all in ^ne,
God knows what will become of them,
when we are dead and gone,
With that be spoke their mother dear
O Brother mine (quoth she)
You are the man must bring my Babes,
^o wealth or misery.
If you do keep them carefully,
then God will you reward,
If otherwise you seem to deals
your deed God will regard,
With lips as cold as any day,
she ^^st her Children small
God bless ye does my little lambs,
with that the tearis did fall.
These speeches then their brother spoke,
to this sick couple there,
The keeping of your Children young*
sweet sister do not scare.
God never prosper minor mine,
or ought el'e that I have,
If I do wrong your ^hildren small,
when you are laid it grave.
Their Parents being dead and gone,
the children home hi takes.
And brings them ho^e unto his house
and much of them he makes.
He had not kept these pretty Babes,
a ^^^lue month and a day.
But for their wealthhe did deu^^,
to make them bothaway.
He bargained with two ruffians ^^de,
that were of furious mood,
That they should take the children young
and stay them in the Wood:
And told his wife and all the ^st
he did the Children send,
To be brought up in fair Lond^,
with one that was his friend.
The second part,
To the same tune.


A Way then went these pretty Babes
rejoicing of that tids,
Ang smiling with a merry mind,
they should on cockhorse rive.
They prate and prattle pleasantly,
as they rode on their way,
To them that should their butchers be
and work their lines decay.
So that the pretty speech they had,
made murderers hearts relent,
And that they took this beed to do,
full fore they do repent.
Yet one of them more hard of heart,
did vow to do his charge,
Because the wretch that hired them
had paid them very large.
The other would not gree thereto,
so hear they fell at strise,
With one another they did fight,
about these Childrens life.
And he that was of mildest mood,
did kill the other there,
Within an unfrequented Wood,
while ^ Babes did quake for fear,
He took the Children by the hand.
when tears stood in their eye,
And bade them come and go with him,
and look they did not cry.
And two long miles he lead them thus
when they for bread complain
Stay here (quoth he) I Will bring yon ^ead
when I do come again.
Those pretty Babes with hand in hand
went wandering up and down,
But never more they saw the man,
approaching from the row^e.
Their pretty lips with blackberries
were all besmeat'd and died,
And when they saw the dartsome night,
they sat them dewne and cry de.
Thus wandered these little B^bes
till death did end their griese,
In one another a^mas they di'de,
as Babes wanting relief,
No burial these pretty Babes
of any man receives,
Till Robin Redbrest painasvlly,
did cover them with lea^es.
And now the heavy wrath of God,
upon then Uncle sell:
Yeasearefull fiends did haunt his house,
his conference felt a hell.
His Barns were fir^d his goods consumed
his land was barren made.
His cattle di'd within the fields,
and nothing with him staid
And in the voyag of Portugal,
two of his sons did die,
And ^o conclude himself was brought,
to extreme misery.
He pawnd and morgag^ all his land
ere seven years went about,
And now at length this wicked act,
did by this means come out.
The fellow which did take in hand
the Children for to kill,
was for a roberyin'd to death,
as was Gods blessed will.
Who did conses the very truth,
the which is here expressed,
Their Uncle died, while he for debt,
in prison long did rest.
All you that be Crecutors made,
and overseers eke,
Of children that be fatherless,
of infants mild and m^ke,
Take you example by the same,
and yield to each their rig^^,
Left God withsuch (...)
your wicked^n (...)
